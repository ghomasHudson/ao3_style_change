Quickly, wildly, he pumped himself, watching the way his arm had to reach around the full weight of his belly. He watched himself struggle to stand, barley able to breathe, the way his belly hung over his hand as it flew over his erection, flushed and pink, rock hard, building and building the pleasure in his cock, tightening the painful skin of his belly, filled with building pressure.
Sherlock bit his lip and held in a desperate moan as the man stopped half-way through the soda and looked down at himself again. He rubbed his palm over his entire belly again, over the full bursting curve.
“Sherlock –” John warned.
John cupped his belly in both hands, looking down at it helplessly as it stretched and heaved with his breathing. He held it like he would burst, shivering at the slow heat of Sherlock’s hand on his cock.
Then it ended.
John knew he would have to go into the bathroom soon for a piss and a shower, but before then, he slowly walked away from the mirror and crawled onto his bed. The cool sheets caressed his hot, naked skin. He rolled onto his side, slowly so the liquid in his belly wouldn’t cramp, and he cradled the curve of his full belly in his hands. It rested warmly against his thighs as it spilled before him onto the mattress. The skin expanded as he breathed.
Sherlock didn’t touch his belly, waiting until John felt ready. There were some nights where John couldn’t go on past this point. Where the shame of knowing what he must look like, swollen and round and filling his skin, would become too much to bear. When he would slink away and throw on a giant pullover and lay on his stomach with his eyes shut tight until he knew he could sit up and not look down at a huge belly hanging off his front. And on those nights Sherlock would leave him alone for a while, just long enough for John to feel like “John” again. And then he would come to him and lead him back out into their flat, where they’d go about their business and watch a good movie and neither one would touch John’s stomach again.
John was stroking his thickening cock again with his hand through his pants. The tip of it pressed up against the underside of his belly, trapped beneath the weight. The video was going to end soon, he knew.
He gasped as his fingernails scratched his sides, causing the skin to stretch tighter over the full curve. “Gave myself this huge belly . . . can’t even hold it. It’s growing . . .” He stifled a burp and caressed his stomach, trying to soothe it as it churned and ached. The cola was still fizzing inside of him, expanding. “Fuck, it’s getting bigger,” he whispered. “Getting even bigger –"
He clicked it, and he put his earbuds back into his ears with shaking fingers. He looked quickly left and right, even though he was sitting alone in his flat in the middle of the night. Just as the seven-minute video finally loaded, he sat back against the hard wood of the kitchen chair, silently loosened the belt in his trousers, then gently placed his hand between his legs over the expensive wool cloth. He told himself he was simply sitting with his hand in his lap.
Sherlock couldn’t believe the stillness in the man’s body – the way his spine stood ramrod straight and yet soft. The way his legs planted him firmly into the earth where he stood in a three-quarter view to the camera. The way he didn’t flinch away, or curl into himself. The way he radiated calm.
John grunted and threw his t-shirt back down to cover himself, then pulled on another large jumper before walking out into the living room, making sure his steps weren’t too heavy so his belly wouldn’t move.
John looked down at the sight of himself, straining out underneath his jumper and hiding his legs from view. Sherlock’s hands disappeared beneath it, holding it up. It was an incredible relief to feel his skin stretch outward. To feel like his body was finally the right shape.
“God, I can’t . ..  I’m too . . . Fuck, look at me –”
Sherlock helped him to haul himself up to his knees, so his belly hung full and heavy out in front of him, no longer with the support from his thighs. He leaned forward and grasped his stomach as the food and water resettled, causing pain to radiate through his massive gut. He moaned as the pain peaked and then passed, then looked back towards the ceiling and took another full, deep breath, willing his muscles to loosen and stretch. He held his sides as he breathed, feeling his belly stretch fuller beneath his hands.
John shivered. They never did this. Usually months went by in between nights like last night, and they had never ever done it during the day. Sherlock continued to cup the bottom of his belly in his hands. “Please, John,” he whispered. “Just let yourself be.”
“Water first.”
He fed him the warm pasta bite by bite, and John left his hands to gently rub down around the lowest curve of his belly as he chewed and swallowed. He could feel the curve of his stomach against his forearms, and when he looked down his packed upper stomach came to a point below his chest. The food joined the water already swelling his stomach and started to gradually settle lower in his gut, pushing out the bottom of his belly further and further into his waiting hands. The only sounds in the room were the quiet noises of his chewing, and the slight moans and gasps for breath John made as each bite of food forced itself into his already packed stomach.
For the first time since he had ever tried stuffing, he saw his face.
Focusing hard, Sherlock could see the tiniest nub in the center of the man’s belly from his navel, pushing out against the thin fabric. The man brushed his thumb over it once, twice, then paused from his swallowing to gasp out loud, letting out a little moan as his thumb rubbed over the sensitive bump. He looked down again at his belly, his back now curved to press his stomach forward to try and get more room. His legs were spread where they stood planted on the floor, and his belly started to hang heavily in the space between his hips. Again, he watched his own hand stroke over the curve, rubbing the heavy underside of his belly before holding the side and breathing so that his belly stretched into his palm. His arm was starting to have to reach forward to touch the farthest tip of his growing stomach, and Sherlock suddenly desperately wanted to know what that stomach looked like from above – what the man himself saw when he looked down at his huge, ballooning body.
John woke in the morning to an empty bed. He was curled on his side under a mountain of covers. He gently moved his hand down towards his middle, and felt with a grimace how far out his belly spilled before him onto the sheets, still hard and round and bloated the morning after. The bottom part of his stomach was firm and warm as it tried to digest everything from the night before, and the top part of his stomach was starting to grow puffy and soft.
“Yes,” Holmes said at last.  “You do truly have a storyteller’s gift.  That is the word, for lack of a better.  I was moved.”
At first I did not quite understand.  Then I remembered.  Crocker had told us he said those words to the lady when the pain of loving her so without speaking of it became too much for him.
As I talked, I kissed down his fingers, and the shell- no thicker than a hair to begin with, I assure you- of aloofness Holmes had managed to cover himself in began to crack.  Soon there were gaping chasms in it, whatever lay beneath pouring out of his eyes.
I swallowed.  I knew we had understood each other, and that if I said so aloud he would as I had suggested never speak of it again.  “Yes,” I whispered.
Despite my exhaustion, sleep did not find me quickly that night.
He said, “I assure you, the only time wasted was what I spent arguing with Mrs. Hudson when I arrived.”
He had interrogated his own motives to me in this way before.  It was rare enough to rouse me from my exhaustion with curiosity, but not so rare that I thought much about it beyond the intellectual problem.  “I supposed you moved by Crocker’s story,” I said.  It seemed to me that some unusual sympathy between large souls must have occurred.
“Yes.  I still hope you will.”
What I could see of his face remained blank, but his grip on the mantle tightened further.  And then his lips twitched, softened almost, and flattened out again.  His other hand, a pale slash hanging freely against his side, fluttered almost imperceptibly and then stilled again.  I had a fancy that if he hadn’t been aware of me watching him Holmes would have touched his mouth.  But that was a fancy only; all I knew for sure was that it affected him physically.  “You did not,” he agreed faintly.  I awaited some further break in the silence that was long in coming, but I had the patience to wait him out.  “You kissed me.”  His brow lifted.  “Did you imagine that was somehow illuminating?” His tone utterly failed to be scathing, imperious, or any of the other things I had no doubt he wished it to be.
As I said, it had been some months since it happened, and things had settled between us into such an easy normalcy in that time that it actually took me several moments to realize what 'agreement' he was referring to. The one in which I agreed to enjoy his friendship while he ignored my love.  I need hardly add that I was stung by the implication that I could not keep to it under the circumstances.  “Do you think so little of my medical skills?” I asked.
“Let me question him,” Sherlock demanded, standing in Lestrade’s office at the Yard.
“Coerced?” John interrupted, his voice cracking.
Sherlock watched as John left, letting him go without another word.
“Do you want to—,” but before he could finish, John responded with a grin.
“We didn’t bring any of that stuff in, it was all already here,” Lestrade informed him.
“What are you doing here Mycroft?” Sherlock kept walking determinedly.
be sent. He imagined Sherlock clearing his expression, instantly resetting it to a blank slate. Could he really expect Sherlock to see through another instance of John’s betrayal to save him? It hadn’t happened the first time, there was no reason to expect any different now.
But he couldn't leave the flat in case John showed up.
Sherlock absorbed the information, and it easily slid in. Things were becoming clearer and clearer with every passing moment.
He had air, but no clue how long it would last before the ceiling that was above him was pulled down and took him back under with it.
“Worried about him? He’s been working with Moriarty! He’s an accessory to murder!”
Moriarty looked like John had slapped him, once again rearing back from John, but he quickly regained his composure.
Sherlock was reasonably surprised, which was something that rarely happened to him.
And then that’s where things started to get interesting. Mrs. Huxley’s son, Michael, was apparently not just some kid who felt lost, fell in with the wrong people, and then royally fucked up. Rather he was a genius. Not quite like Sherlock was, but he was very, very good at maths and had apparently been contracted to work with the government regarding something top secret and dangerous. Sherlock of course hadn’t wanted to ask Mycroft on his own. He was not particularly up to asking his brother for anything ever again after all the babysitting his brother did for him to keep him from accidentally killing himself out of grief and ambivalence for life. But ultimately he deigned to, only to receive nothing more than a confirmation that Michael Huxley had had some government involvement. It was completely unhelpful.
“I don’t know. Maybe something scared them.”
John steadied his breath and stepped out from the alley, turning in the opposite direction from the way that Sherlock and Victor had gone. He’d made it a few blocks before he heard another familiar voice.
When he woke up again there was a familiar beeping sound and he felt a bit like he was floating. Judging by the firm partially inverted bed, the white walls, bland curtains and tile, observation window, and beeping equipment, he was in a hospital. He opened his mouth to try and say something but instead he found himself coughing. His throat felt raw. At least he hadn't been intubated.
“There was a collision.”
They were back at their old flat, which was caked in a layer of dust but otherwise eerily the same. What kind of money did their man have to pay eight months of rent in London rather than have to deal with the minor inconvenience of moving it in and out of storage? Were tax dollars being spent on this?
“We came to pull you out of the river. Sorry it took so long, but Holmes was watching and we couldn’t exactly let him see us.”
He started tidying up the flat, for John.
Sherlock took off running, but was quickly caught in his brothers arms.
“Who is this government official? If even Mycroft has been on Moriarty’s tail and hasn’t been able to do much to help in getting any closer to bringing him down, I can’t imagine your guy is any better.”
And then they were kissing again, and John carefully guided Sherlock backwards towards Sherlock’s room, trying to keep their mouths locked together while also avoiding tripping over the carpet, or chair, or random pile of books, or anything else that could lead John to spending the afternoon with Sherlock at A&E with a concussion instead of in his bed.
” John spat, using the rage surging through him to heave himself off the floor and into a seated position.
“You know that’s not what I meant.”
But John though had found nothing in any of the papers. Every crime reported in all the newspapers, even the ones that weren’t local, seemed to have been solved already. And he and John had already both came twice that day and had gone out to pick up biscuits and orange juice, despite the fact that they didn’t really need them. So Sherlock was unfathomably bored.
“No, Johnny, you don’t, do you? I’ve broken you and I hardly even had to try.”
“Irene Adler."
He didn’t know when his sense of purpose in life and his value in the world had become so tied up in Sherlock. Perhaps it was because Sherlock had come waltzing into his life at the same time he was seriously considering firing his Browning into his brain. He was sure his old therapist would have had something to say about how Sherlock was an unhealthy coping mechanism.
"John thinks I hate him, doesn't he?" was the first piece of clear deduction that came to him.
They were sitting in the small living room, with Victor and Mary on the couch pouring over files spread out on the coffee table. John sat delicately in an arm chair across from them. He was still fighting to manage the pain in his back, the wounds would like take a while to heal completely, plus his side often ached but John wasn’t sure if that was psychosomatic or not at this point. His limp was back and his hand had a near constant tremor now a day, so he imagined it could be.
“Vic, our only objective was to keep them alive through this. That’s all it’s ever been. That’s the only game plan. Everything else that’s happened is just coincidence. I had no idea I’d spent a year parading around the globe like we did,”
Ms. Hudson made him three meals a day, and lots of tea. Sherlock ate some of it, but most of it went cold.
“DMJS probably stands for something, right? Nothing comes up in a basic google search. Probably initials then, something more generic, harder to search. 12.11 could be a date, the 12
John got his eyes to focus, and he realized that Sherlock was sitting on his waist and had his arms pinned on either side of his head in order to prevent John from thrashing.
John could only stare at Moriarty in horror. What was the madman going on about?
John woke up to notice that the clock had ticked its way down the 42 hours. He quickly shut his eyes and tried to stay still, hoping not to alert Moran to his return to consciousness. He wondered what Sherlock was doing right now. Had he already figured out that John was the doctor? Did he hate John for giving into Moriarty and doing something so awful instead of trusting Sherlock to get him out of it? It didn’t matter anymore, John supposed. He imagined that he would spend the next 42 hours drifting in and out of consciousness as his body shut down in response to the torture Moran would continue to inflict. Then the boat would sink into the Thames and water would fill his lungs and it would all be over with.
"I need you too."
“Did you get a pulse yet?”
of November. Or perhaps December 2011. Or December 1911 or 1811 or so on. So I’m running the dates to see if there are any events that might correspond with the initials DMJS,” Sherlock rattled in explanation, using his ‘you’re being thick and dragging me down with you’ voice.
“Don’t you dare, you know nothing of our relationship! Don’t pretend that you do. I’ve been around Sherlock long enough to know that half of his deductions are just guesses. Don’t pretend for a second that you were ever even remotely a part of that part of our lives.”
John sighed in defeat and managed to shimmy the thoroughly mussed duvet down far enough that he could slide his bare legs and hips under it.
It was then he realized that the boat was moving. Moran must have been moving the boat into position. Moriarty had mentioned that John would die in the river, and while the water surrounding Canary Wharf did belong to the Thames, it didn’t exactly have the dramatic image of a boat sliding under the water line with Parliament in the background that John had imagined when Moriarty had first described his fate. The man after all was all about theatrics. He also then realized that the clues Moriarty said he’d left for Sherlock probably had to lead somewhere, and again, for theatrical purposes, that probably wasn’t the docks. For a moment hope surged through John. Even if it wasn’t Sherlock, maybe if the boat went down publicly, he’d stand a chance at rescue. But he quickly stamped the hope away. If there was any hope, he’d rather be pleasantly surprised then disappointed.
Everything, then, in Sherlock's mind settled into place.
So he began searching out a hit. He’d be out with Victor one night and began searching out the usual spots where one could find dealers, the toilets of clubs or tucked into alleyways, but Victor would show up, usually with a girl on his arm, and demand Sherlock come for a round of shots. Or he’d claim to have run into someone that Sherlock would just
He frantically looked around, trying to see through the dark and murky water. He could only make out the vaguest of shapes and a flashing red light of the expired timer. The water quickly started to sting his eyes and he had to shut them. The door had been right in front of him, hadn’t it, just to the left of the timer? He swam forwards and groped until he found the door knob, pulling open the door. How long could people hold their breaths? The world record was something like ten minutes maybe he’d read once? Which meant what, he had probably all of about a minute at most before his untrained-for-forcing-yourself-to-hold-your-breath-until-right-before-you-go-brain-dead body would demand that he breathe or go unconscious.
"Mycroft? What on earth are you doing here?" Sherlock sputtered.
“We don’t know that for sure,” Lestrade said.
“I’m not--,” Sherlock started, but was once again cut off.
And there was nothing that he would ever be able to do about it, no matter how much time he spent in his mind palace or how intelligent he was.
The ride to the crime scene was silent. Lestrade had given Sherlock the address and had taken his car and John and Sherlock sat alone in the back of a cab. Sherlock racked his brain trying to figure out reasons why John was behaving so oddly, but none of the data pointed to any sort of conclusive answer, or even a reasonably good guess. Sherlock had always liked that John was unpredictable. The fact that he didn’t follow the usual patterns of human behavior all the time, but not in a way that was the typical deviant either, had always made him interesting to Sherlock. But now it was driving Sherlock insane.
So John stepped forwards, grabbed Sherlock and kissed him. Sherlock eagerly returned the kiss. After a few moments John decided it was his turn to go exploring, and he began to undo the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt and run his hands slowly down Sherlock’s pale chest. Sherlock shrugged the shirt off, and it fell to the floor. John continued to let his hands roam.
And then Sherlock was walking. He didn’t quite know where, but he had to look for John. He walked down to the water and made his way along it, looking for a narrow boat, texting the locations of every single one to Lestrade, hoping that he could check them out, get warrants to board them if any of them came back looking like they could possibly be connected to Moriarty.
“Anti-criminal mastermind, eh? So you admit it?”
John found himself breathing heavily, like he’d just been in pursuit of Argentinian arms dealer who had somehow manage to scale a six story building, free climbing. Of course Sherlock was upset about the existence of the Peacemaker. Of course Sherlock had thought that The Peacemaker was competition. John couldn't help but roll his eyes. Some things never changed. God, if only Sherlock knew. John could imagine coming out from behind the wall right then and announcing that he was not only alive but the legendary Peacemaker and Sherlock would be more mad at him for his vigilante efforts than he was about lying about his death or working with Moriarty. It was a comforting thought, although John feared that unfortunately he'd burned far more bridges than that with Sherlock.
It had now been months since the existence of The Peacemaker was brought to Sherlock’s attention, and he knew nothing definitive about the man’s identity. He seemed to have gone abroad and an array of awe-inspiringly ‘coincidental’ arrests had been left in his wake as he circumnavigated the globe. But other than that, Sherlock knew nothing. The only thing he was convinced of, however, was that Victor Trevor knew more than he was letting on.
“The friend even acquired a bit of a nickname, you know. He was so shrouded in anonymity, people had to invent a new name for him. Do you know what they called him?” Moriarty asked.
It’s not, of course, that London was free of crime. People still murdered their exes and their business associates. Money was still being stolen by employees from their companies. People would still go missing. Children were still molested by their coach or their babysitter. But there was no
Sherlock swung the door shut behind him and it closed with a click.
Lestrade was insistent that there was nothing that pointed anyone towards the existence of some sort of vigilante, nor that this was a move of Moriarty’s. Sherlock knew that the Yard wasn’t thick enough to think that this was just some sort of coincidence. What Lestrade meant when he insisted that there was nothing to investigate was, “Sherlock, don’t be a bloody idiot and go prodding somewhere you don’t belong. If we get a definitive lead, we’ll take care of it, and call you when we need you.” Lestrade may have been a man of few spoken words, but he had always had a habit of silently telling Sherlock off.
He rounded a corner to face and alleyway just in time to see a man standing over another mans crumpled body. Before Sherlock could think he found himself crying out. Later, Sherlock would kick himself for not remaining quiet, not taking more time to observe the crime scene, not taking a moment to text Lestrade to report the homicide. But in that moment he would only notice the way the man froze at the sound of his voice and then without even a glance backwards, would take off running down the opposite end of the alley.
What he saw however, was not a wounded Michael Huxley. What,
“Mycroft! What are you doing here?” Sherlock snapped, walking over to his arm chair, stepping up onto it, and then crouching down to sit with his arms wrapped around his knees.
"He's healed well. The broken bones have been set. The gunshot wounds been stitched up."
Sherlock sprinted, not caring about the people he was bumping into, until he was parallel to the boat from the bank of the river. He held himself against the railing and caught his breath, trying to figure out how to get out to the boat. Festival Pier was just on the other side of the Golden Jubilee bridges, maybe he could commandeer a boat there to take out to the yacht.
The second he’d agreed, the second he hadn’t told Sherlock everything once he was away from Moriarty, he’d transferred his life from Sherlock to Moriarty.
“If we’re going abroad, will Victor at least meet up with us again?” John asked. John hadn’t heard anything about Victor since the collision. Mary hadn’t mentioned him again, and John was never one to pry unless he thought something important was being kept from him. But he trusted Mary to tell him the things he needed to know when he needed to know them.
tie you up Johnny-boy!” Moriarty giggled ferociously while Moran took a step towards John. John raised his hands in the air and bowed his head, letting Moran attach leather cuffs to his wrists, tugging the chains through a pulley so that John was left dangling, arms wide in a spread eagle crucifixion-like sort of position, bound wrists nearly against the ceiling, his toes just barely scraping the floor as his body stretched to fill the space between low ceilings of the narrowboat. Moriarty was lucky that John was below average height.
“Call me Jim, James if you prefer,” Moriarty corrected. “Too many syllables in my surname, don’t you think? Sounds intimidating, but too rough in the mouth for friends. And we’re going to be great friends now, aren’t we, my dear Johnny?”
him and that
Apparently Sherlock had taken a case.
“So, we leave Victor, he’ll be fine,” John said, sounding resigned. “But we still need to deal with the gang.”
“Victor, don’t you think we should at least wait until John gets out of hospital? He needs to rest.”
It was over much too quickly and John was dropped back into reality, panting as Sherlock pulled away. Though Sherlock’s lips were no longer on his, he was still close to him, head nuzzling the crook of his neck.
“I feel like I’m working an office job,” John groaned.
“Well, we can’t be positive at this stage, but six text messages from Mycroft encouraging my participation, and Lestrade reluctantly bringing us onto a case that they’ve been trying to keep quiet after two other matching murders in addition to this one, it has to be Moriarty’s doing,” Sherlock knelt down before John, grasping John’s hands, which remained limp as he squeezed them. “You must come along, John. You have more experience with Moriarty than I do, even if only by a few minutes. Plus, the case has a medical aspect to it.”
Sherlock said nothing.
John stayed silent, horrified that Moriarty’s words were mimicking his own previous thoughts.
"Please. Come inside," he begged.
He was strung up exactly like he was the last time he had met Moriarty.
An hour later he’d gotten to Westminster. He pulled his jacket tighter around him as the evening grew cold and the sun began to hang lower in the sky, golden light reflecting across the river.
He tried to hurry as he made the transfer at Waterloo, but his leg had been acting up again since the incident with Moriarty. He’d been trying his best to hide it from Sherlock, and had by no small miracle succeeded. But right now his leg was aching horribly as he limped along. At least his tremor hadn’t come back, thank God. He wasn’t sure what he would have possibly done if that had happen.
It was all too much so fast. He was supposed to be dead. Taking a nice eternal nap. Instead, he was being briefed on secret missions.
, besides me, or at least I thought but suddenly I’m not so sure. Why did he take anyone that day, the old woman, the child, they didn’t mean anything to you, did they? Maybe that’s what Moriarty was getting at when he chose me! Who should he have taken, anyway,
A fog began to cloud in his mind, but John tried to ignore it as he willed himself to take slow steps forwards. He was careful to keep his bleeding shoulder angled away from Moran, just in case the man dared to make a glance away from his current target and to check on John.
John groaned.
“I just thought, John,” Sherlock’s voice was softer now, and John’s name on his lips now sent a shiver down John’s spine. “That Moriarty, for all he claims to be, would manage to know something I didn’t know. I know that I care for you, John, which something that I have been informed of enough times now that I acknowledged it as the truth a long time ago. But I imagined a mastermind like Moriarty would be able to come up with something a little less cliché than kidnapping a targets partner to upset them," Sherlock said gently with a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
“I’m going to the pub with Mike tomorrow,” John announced. Sherlock deflated.
The pain in his shoulder quickly became worse than that inflicted by the blow torch, and after an hour he started screaming.
Or, more likely, been done to him.
“Apparently, the opponents friend was smarter, stronger, better than either the man or the opponent had realized. He rose from the dead, and launched a counter attack on the man, all while keeping his friend in the dark.
"I worry that he poses a threat to himself if he believes his life no longer had purpose."
The words echoed in John’s mind as he regained consciousness. They were followed by a panicked stream of one conscious thought of his ex-lovers name.
“The point would be that Moriarty has nothing left, Mar, you know that. He has nothing in the world right now but the very tool we built to destroy him.”
On the third day Molly texted him, asking him if he was alright, that Lestrade had come to the morgue and told her some troubling things.
"Sherlock, I'll work as fast as I can," Mycroft began, gesturing to the bright screen of his mobile for effect, but Sherlock had already stopped listening, and was opening the door of the car and flinging himself through traffic to get to the side of the bridge. He took off down the side walk, trying to figure out how to get closer to boat as soon as possible, shoving through crowds of tourists trying to take their picture in front of the Eye.
“Sherlock, that boat is 50 meters away from you, and your eye sight is not superhuman.”
“What?” Sherlock paused, retracing what he’d said. “Oh, yes, well doctors being moral and all that, but also Moriarty’s want for the best. I imagine that the doctor was threatened, and even then could have likely only have agreed once he learned that his patient would already be dead. The pool of doctors who would fall to blackmail or threats is far larger than that of doctors who could be paid off to commit such a crime or do it for fun. Someone involved in the study could have been approached as well, someone who had desperately wanted human test subjects. But that still confirms the need for this murder to involve at least a pair.”
Sherlock cried out as his orgasm suddenly exploded from his body, coating his stomach and hand with his semen. He lost all control, mind racing and pulsing at the thought of coming with his erection pressed to the man’s belly, with the huge, heaving weight of it between his hands as he grabbed it to rub, as he sucked at the bursting navel and felt the taut, full skin struggling to breathe beneath his lips.
He nodded at Sherlock. “Ok.”
John moaned and finally let out his stomach, groaning as it ballooned under his shirt and expanded beneath Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock watched his belly grow from over John’s shoulder and let out his own soft moan, rubbing slowly over John’s heavy, low curve.
“So big,” he moaned, rubbing over his stretched stomach. He closed his eyes and focused on the feel of his hands tracing his over-sensitive skin. “I’m too full,” he breathed. He pressed hard against the tight skin, feeling no give. “Stuffed myself too full, too huge . . .”
There was only a minute and thirty seconds left in the video. Sherlock’s mind raced. He wondered how he could possibly pack anything else into his aching belly. It must be painfully stretched and taut now, bloated and heavy, making the man have to whine and gasp for shallow breaths as it pressed up on his lungs and hung huge between his hips.
he uploaded them hundreds of times, and the only answer he could ever come up with had been that other people did it, so why not him? After all, it was only due to stumbling across another person’s similar video that John realized this was even a thing, and then went out that same evening to guilty buy his first liter of soda from the corner store. Something about the risk of it, the shameful thrill . . . Something to make him feel physically alive after months staring blankly at his own white walls.
The man paused for another moment, holding himself in his hand and taking a few deep breaths, then he raised the liquid and again started to drink. He drank more slowly now, pausing after every few swallows to arch his back even further, and press his belly into his hand. Sherlock could see beneath the shirt that the skin at the top of his swollen stomach was stretched tight and hard, struggling to rise even more each time he tried to breathe.
He lifted the full jug with a completely steady arm, tipped back his head, and, without a word, began to drink.
He lazily wrapped his other arm around the bottom of his belly and pushed it up, rounding it out even more as he filled himself with more long swallows of milk. Sherlock’s breathing quickened behind him. He began to whisper in John’s ear with a deep voice. “Think of how heavy you are,” he said, clutching John’s heaving belly as he drank. “You’ve never gotten so huge in your life. Never been so full for so long.”
Sherlock realized, all at once, that he was half-hard beneath his own palm. He froze, unable to decide whether to move his hand away, or press down to rub friction over his swelling cock. Whether to slam his laptop shut or turn up the volume of the man’s breaths.
He groaned. He realized he’d never seen his belly this hard and swollen before. The skin was pale white, and was starting to itch where it stretched the most along his sides to accommodate the heavy weight of his growing belly.
And he would be hoping that the he didn’t again see the shadow on the wall from the cane.
The man stood there for another moment looking down at his feet. His toned arms flexed, revealing hard lines of muscle under suntanned skin. He ran one of his palms slowly up his other forearm, trailing over the soft bed of blonde hair, and he took a deep breath through his nose which lasted a few seconds before letting it out in a long exhale. Sherlock couldn’t see his eyes beneath the shadow from the cap, but he knew without a doubt that they were softly closed.
Ten seconds left.
John forced down the last swallow of milk and threw back his head, groaning at the sharp pain as his belly continued to bloat. He looked sideways at himself and gasped.
The comments coming in were the usual fare. Most of the time, John barely even glanced at them. They weren’t the reason why he uploaded the videos, not really. Those comments were all about “Username999”, not actually about him.
Everyone was focused on the last few seconds of the video, the part where John let himself moan freely and stroke his erection through his jeans. John blushed reading the filthy words appearing on his screen – asking him to smear his semen over his belly, telling him he looked pregnant, ripe and ready to burst, telling him they’d get themselves off rutting against his tight stomach. And those were only the ones that he could get through reading without looking away.
Sherlock’s mouse had been hovering over the ‘x’ to close the window when the soft sounds of the man’s pained breathing, followed by a long groan, had oozed through his earbuds. And then he’d frozen.
He’d asked himself the question of
Sherlock’s hand flew over his cock. The clock of the video was like a countdown to his orgasm – to the moment that he himself would finally burst.
John dipped his finger into the dip of his navel and groaned at the pressure. He needed this. Badly. He nodded yes leaning back against Sherlock, and Sherlock leaned down to kiss him on his cheek with a grin. “Excellent.”
He’d never walked around his small flat before after a stuffing, and certainly not with his shirt still off. He felt dangerous and obscene. He knew, obviously, that no one could actually see what he was doing. He was completely alone in his set of rooms, with all the blinds shut, and yet the thought still remained - that he was waddling around, stuffed, looking pregnant with a rounded belly, walking around his flat in the light of day, away from the safety of the one white bathroom wall where he’d always restricted his stuffing sessions to before.
“Yes, well clearly none of us knew John as well as we had thought.”
And with the realization, John knew he had won. He wasn’t sure if Victor, Mary and himself would get out alive, but Sherlock would, and that had always been the main objective. Moriarty was defeated. Whether or not, or in what fashion, the former mastermind's body would be dragged into the morgue or prison was only a technicality.
They sat in silence as they watched as police and coastguard boats began to swarm the steadily sinking vessel. Sherlock sat very still, back erect and hands gripping his thighs, like he was physically trying to hold himself together. Mycroft slowly raised his hand from his own lap and placed it over one of Sherlock’s.
“Cruel? You want to talk about cruel? John has betrayed me! He led me to care about him, when the whole time he was working with Moriarty. He hid himself from me entirely, mutilating corpses into a way in which they were specifically designed to taunt me!
Distantly, John thought he heard a noise that sounded like am alarm going off, but then again he also thought he could feel Sherlock nuzzling his neck.
“One day, he heard tales of another man, a man who was like him in his genius, but used his powers for good instead of evil,” Moriarty paused, as if contemplating something, “Good and evil are of course complicated and relative concepts, but I’m sticking with the archetypes," Moriarty said as an aside. Then he continued: “And so, thinking he had finally found an opponent worth engaging with, he began to challenge him. And this new opponent rose so wonderfully to the challenge. They fought, and it was like a dance. A splendid dance.
John considered for a second taking another pause, as much as he hated the concept, to remove some more clothing, but then felt Sherlock’s hand dive through the slit in the front of his pants and grasp his cock, causing John to gasp. When Sherlock had gotten his trousers unbuttoned John wasn’t sure, but he didn’t care.
"John Watson was an accessory to murder. In the few months alone he has killed eleven people and injured dozens more. Several people, including the man that Michael Huxley was put away for killing, killed themselves rather than be brought down by him. None of this was his fault?"
“Sherlock,” Lestrade gasped.
He had always known that Mycroft’s habit of barging in unannounced was a habit born specifically out of checking up on him post rehab to make sure he wasn’t high or otherwise gone AWOL. Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade at the heart of it probably came around unannounced for much the same reason, but they at least usually came up with other excuses that were occasionally not completely irritating. But now Trevor had taken up that annoying habit of crashing on Sherlock’s couch whenever he didn’t feel like going back to his own less centrally located room or would pop around after work to drag him out to anything that he could come up with in terms of entertainment.
“The hair removal is probably a bit overkill,” Anderson said, appearing out of nowhere, much to Sherlock’s displeasure. Sherlock saw John startle in surprise out of the corner of his eye and his desire to strangle Anderson increased tenfold. “There are other ways to get DNA. The whole body is made of it.” Anderson finished haughtily.
“Oh, about two weeks ago.”
good. So the man decided to use friend to his advantage. He kidnapped him and gave him a mission. He turned this friend into a butcher of sorts, or maybe a tailor, and it was marvelous. The work he did, the trouble he caused. All while the opponent knew nothing about the betrayal of his friend. But soon enough, the friend stopped being of use to the man. But of course, you already know this part. You know what the friend did, you know that when he ran out of usefulness the man drowned him in a river. Or tried to anyway.” Moriarty paused, waiting for Sherlock to process the news.
He briskly continued north, trying to take in anything and everything along the way. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but there had to be something that screamed John.
Sherlock felt his heart stop at the implication of her words.
John lay still under the covers, with Sherlock curled into his side, feeling the other man’s breath against his neck. He felt heavy with contentedness, and allowed his eyes to fall shut. He quickly forgot about the fact that he was still wearing his jumper, that Sherlock was still wearing his trousers, that he was caked in sweat and desperately in need of a shower, and the fact that it was likely about dinner time and he shouldn’t let Sherlock get away with skipping yet another meal. Instead John drifted to sleep.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. They were talking to him like he was a child. But Sherlock stopped and traced through the deductions that he’d made yesterday at the crime scene, until he remembered.
He believed in love, in the sense that love didn’t exactly have a set definition so if someone said they felt it than they probably did. He had been beginning to think that he could be one of those people who claimed to be in love.
“Well, I mean it’s not, technically, I suppose. If he confessed to a specific crime, or any series of documented crimes that he may have committed as part of gang involvement, then that’s one thing. But that’s the point, we arrest people for committing crimes, not for claiming to be a type of person who historically commit crimes. And the only reason I could imagine him admitting anything is if there is something that he’s been involved with recently that he feels is highly likely to get him caught, then he might vie to make a deal or something in exchange for information. But again, that’s a theoretical scenario, and we’re working with what we actually know, not things that could possibly be the case.”
"It would do no one any good for you to find him right now. He's not the same as he was the last time you saw him all those months ago. And he's a bit indisposed at the moment."
John, for a second seemed unsure, but after a moment he opened up, letting out a sob like whine.
“You’re just jealous,” Trevor rolled his eyes and Sherlock scowled at him. “Drop it Sherlock, I have nothing to do with this vigilante you’re obsessed with, alright?”
It wasn’t signed, but Sherlock supposed it didn’t need to be.
But after their fight, he became quick to make sure he didn’t try to take things too far again, and he and John quickly fell back into their rather domestic pattern.
“No. Throwing yourself into the river is only going to cause you to get hypothermia and ruin that expensive coat of yours, best case scenario. Properly equipped rescue units are already on their way, and there is no conclusive evidence that anyone was even on board,” Mycroft reassured as he let his brother go and left him sprawled on the pavement. “And I never want to hear you make another goddamn comment about my weight again,” he added.
“Okay, if you say so. But I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that framing a hacker with ties to Moriarty to the mugging is a bit of a challenge. I mean he was a hacker, John. Tech-y little nerd types don’t usually go around mugging people. Plus, Sherlock almost caught you that night as well.”
"Of course I do!" Sherlock burst out. Then he stilled, and much more quietly said, "It wasn't his fault."
Sherlock pulled away.
He came back to his senses when he realized that Sherlock was grinding himself against his hip as he pleasured John. John was a very proud man, and he was far too proud to leave Sherlock to get off by dry humping him like a teenager, doing all of the work on his own. He managed to get between Sherlock’s groin and his hip, and Sherlock obliged to stop rutting against him for long enough for John to undo his trousers and shove his hand down his pants to grasp his cock.
“Smile for the camera, Johnny!” Moriarty sang, then raised a foot and smashed it into John’s skull and John saw no more as he lost consciousness.
There had been a couple more hackers in France who had been pretty easy to shut down. It turned out that these bigger fish kinds of operations were easier to take down than John had initially thought because while the people involved may be been busy and strong enough to not be completely owned by Moriarty, they were also heavily sought after by governments in their own country. All he’d have to do was help Mary with a bit of tailing and leave the information somewhere the French government would stumble upon it and think it to be their own intelligence and they arrested the group of hackers without John having to meet any of them face to face.
“Come on John. Come on. Breathe John. Come on.”
“I haven’t been to the pub with John in months.”
“Just moved recently,” Sherlock couldn’t help but feel the corner of his lip twitch in satisfaction. He’d gotten something right.  “I’m kind of in between places, actually, looking for a flat of my own or at least a not completely weird flat mate. I don’t know how long I’ll be in London though, anyway. But, you know, London real estate is tough and hardly affordable. I’m currently renting a room from an older couple in Crouch End. I’ve been helping them out around the house as well as part of an unofficial part of my let agreement to keep the rent down. It’s not exactly close to work, but it is allowing me to even save up a bit,” Trevor supplied in that casual way that was driving Sherlock mad. “Where have you got yourself set up?”
“Half seven. There are going to be tourists buzzing about soon down here and we can’t have you lying here like a bum. What were you hoping to accomplish anyway by sleeping rough?”
“It may lead to a new inference, I suppose.”
Sherlock Holmes fell into a period of low spirits shortly after the Abbey Grange case which I was initially at a loss to explain.  As the night wore on he only spoke to me when I asked him a question, or when something he saw on my face or in the way I sipped my brandy struck him as an unspoken question which he was nevertheless obliged to answer.  I may have had my doubts about his handling of the matter- I almost always did when he judged what he knew not to be for the police, though I had never yet absolutely disagreed with his reasoning- but I did not think he had.  Thus it did not occur to me, at first, that there could be any specific disturbance on his part at all.
No, jjust because his stomach had twisted awfully when Sherlock had rejected him the night they met, and had twisted just as bad every time since he had to brush off a joke or a misunderstanding about their partnership since then, it did not mean that he and Sherlock could ever be anything more. Just because his denials were growing increasingly terse and violent out of frustration of seeming to have to repeat it all the time, did not mean they were destined to be together.
“Oh, been bouncing around a bit, you know. Serious jobs turned out to not be for me. Just kind of make money when I need to or get too bored. Mostly when I get bored. Could probably live off family money if I wanted to, but it feels good to earn your money. I’m not quite as good at turning hobbies into full time jobs as you appear to have been,” Victor shrugged.
“Okay. Fine. I still don’t understand exactly what you want me to do,” he said after a moment.
Finally Moriarty moved, going over to look out a window. The glass was dirty and warped, impenetrable with the eye, but yet Moriarty stared, enraptured.
John’s eyes followed Moran as he came into his line of vision. He followed Moriarty’s finger to the small rolling table that he pointed to, which had a small metal tray on it which had some unidentifiable objects resting on it. John fought down the panic that instantly welled up inside of him. It was all too familiar, little metal tray, the kind that held scalpels and other medical tools. Medical tools he'd used to maim, to butcher. All this time, and John was still faced with a reminder that he would never be able to be a doctor again. He gasped sharply as he began to panic and cringed in agony. He tried to catch his breath, but couldn’t figure out how to without the pain.
“Did you make noises like this for Sherlock, Johnny? I know we haven’t talked about that aspect of your relationship with him before, but we all know you were fucking,” Moriarty remained grinning, but his eyes grew dark. “Or were at least building up to it anyway, you sweet innocent things.” John felt a rush of cold on his back and realized that Moran must have dumped water on it in a less than halfhearted attempt to wash off the chemicals. But John was having an easier time ignoring the searing in his back since he was beginning to feel rage boiling in the pit of his stomach.
“No,” he scoffed. “He’s made it very clear he needs nor wants anything from me.” Sherlock folded his arms across his chest and sat down in his arm chair with a huff, casting a glare at John’s chair across from him.
choice?” John slammed down the medical journal onto the table between them.
His name slid across an LED message display board that was hung around the first floor window of one the towering, dark buildings, It was the kind that probably was usually used to list off changes in the stock market, certainly not the names of London based detectives.
“Yup,” Victor confirmed. “Then we move onto the next one.”
” Mycroft had shouted at him by only the second day. With the insult to the chair, Sherlock had found enough anger to power himself upwards and to the toilet before coming back to the chair and collapsing into it, burying his face, all without even a glance at Mycroft.
“It’s Moriarty,” Sherlock felt like all the air had been sucked out of his lungs at the mention of the name. “He knows. He knows about everything, and he’s got him and he’s fucking going to kill him and I can’t risk a one man rescue mission. I need all the help I can get, Vic. If we lose him, then what was even the point?”
"Oi! Watch where you're going!" the person, the man, that he had run into shouted. But Sherlock was frozen at the familiarity of the voice.
“So we’re going to assemble this file, deliver it to someone, and then Irene Adler will spend the next year at least sorting herself out legally and unable to aid Moriarty or um, play, with Sherlock.”
He found himself on his feet, stepping around John’s chair and reaching out to pick up the skull. He smoothed his fingers along it. “
Faintly, Sherlock heard the vibrations of a phone, but couldn’t bring himself to really process much of anything.
Moriarty groaned, “I don’t care about Sherlock anymore. He's so. Boring. With you and Seb by my side he’d hardly be a threat, would he? No, when you left, he broke. That friend of yours, Trevor, he’s done a decent job replacing you for now, but he’s not exactly really Sherlock’s friend. He care’s because he’s paid to, it’s just another job to him. Sherlock’s adoring brother dearest might be able to keep him around for a while, but not forever. He’ll get bored, as well, playing babysitter. And he’ll leave and how long will Sherlock last after that? We could place bets, if you like.”
“What do you want, Holmes?” Victor called out to Sherlock, but Sherlock stood frozen.
In a neighborhood that had previously been occupied, coincidently, by the very gang that Roger’s led that had more or less completely disappeared from. In fact, there was more or less no major organized crime going on in the city right now. Maybe Roger’s gang had found new leadership and was making a comeback, or maybe it was merely a boring domestic disturbance. But as Sherlock ran hope bloomed within him that maybe, just maybe something interesting was going on.
“That big yacht that’s parked in the middle of the river. I didn't notice it earlier. Or if I did I deleted it. It has a little garage at the base,” Sherlock said distractedly.
“I felt the same this time last year. Me tied up just like this, you thinking you owned the world. But I rebuilt,” John murmured, not bothering to look up at the other man. He kept his head hung and his eyes closed.
Before Sherlock or anyone else could question Huxley more on The Peacemaker, some men in dark suits had shown up with a file of paper work allowing them to take Huxley away, probably to some bunker somewhere for all Sherlock knew or cared.
“Alright. I’ll set a timer then. Sherlock has 48 hours to figure it out, and decide whether or not he forgives you are wants to rescue you. I think that that’s plenty of time, if Sherlock really
“You have done so well, Johnny, but unfortunately your usefulness has almost run out. I only have one more thing I need from you,” Moriarty said. John said nothing. There wasn’t anything to say anymore. There hadn’t been since that night three weeks ago. Moriarty had been right.
After finding out that apparently been Michael Huxley was in fact not some saint caught up with a gang, but rather someone who had stolen highly classified intelligence and had proceeded to go rogue. For some reason MI5 had not thought to inform the Met of this when they opened an investigation into Huxley. The flash drive he’d been carrying around was the intelligence in question, and Huxley had been hoarding it hoping it to use it in whatever scenario proved to be most to his advantage.
, was apparently all it takes.”
He was going to be successful today. Full stop. Today was the day.
His fingers grazed something smooth. Glass. Some of the paper must have fallen off in the water. Glass meant windows. Glass meant a way out. Before he could even think about it, he pulled his arm back and slammed it through the window, shattering the old glass of the weathered boat. He thanked God that the windows of the old nearly dilapidated boat were made of thin glass rather than plastic or something else sturdier. He then threw himself through the space that was created. It wasn’t much, the window wasn’t very big and he hadn’t managed to take out the entire pane. It certainly wasn't safety glass either, and he could feel his skin being grated on the glass as he shoved his body through the opening. But then he broke the surface of the water and frantically gasped for air.
“Alright, I know I’ve already mentioned it, but this body, it’s incredibly, well, creepy. Feels like what you’d get if you mixed a horror, espionage, and and alien film together.”
And wrong Sherlock was.
“Yes, but to dim witted criminals it’s like handing them a fucking business card.”
He heard Mycroft calling after him, but Sherlock just began to run, back across to the South side of the river and down towards South Bank.
“Honestly though John, with the beard and the sunglasses and the new lithe figure of yours you look like you could have been pulled out of some high budget American thriller movie if it weren’t for the fact that you’re so vertically challenged,” Mary laughed, reaching over to him and swiping her hand over the top of his head for effect.
“John,” Sherlock said from his perch on the armchair.
Sherlock couldn't help but grin. Moriarty. Lestrade may not have said anything about the man, but what he did say was more than enough of a confirmation for Sherlock.
It didn’t matter though, he had a case to solve, and he was going to prove to himself that he didn’t need John to do it. He had made a mistake, a horrible mistake, but he refused to make another one.
The brush continued to dance along John’s jaw, occasionally dabbing at it to accentuate some of Moriarty’s words.
Sherlock heard his brother’s words and found himself nodding slowly. Then he stood up and turned to look down at his brother and Lestrade.
Perched was the best way to describe it, John thought, as he looked up at the other man from the medical journal he was reading. He was squatted with his feet on the seat of the chair, elbows resting on his knees, and his chin resting against his steepled fingers. He managed to look both like someone who was in a pose for meditation and like panther, albeit a gangly one, ready to pounce. But then John supposed that being anything but a contradiction at all times would be far too boring for Sherlock.
But, Sherlock
He paused on the sidewalk to observe the other man that was now speaking to Trevor. He could only see the man’s back from where he was standing, but the man was well dressed in comfortable but expensive looking boots, dark but well-fitting jeans, and a leather jacket that hugged around muscular shoulders and tapered over a compact back. He had blond hair that was slightly shaggy looking but not particularly long. It appeared to be kept in a style similar to Victor’s, but a bit less extreme to suit someone who was likely closer to middle aged than Victor was.
“Okay,” Lestrade broke what seemed to be the thousandth round of silence that fell that afternoon. “But what about the face. I mean, he doesn’t have one!”
"It's sunny today, people would be on deck," Sherlock defended.
He hoped that by hanging around he would see someone interesting brought in. Very few of the new arrests fell into Lestrade’s division anyway, since no more interesting major crime appeared to be occurring, none the less a homicide.
All at once his restraint collapsed. Any thoughts he may have had about how seeing John for the first time would go flew out the window, as he stepped forward and grabbed John's face, and pulled him into a kiss.
The next day Mycroft came to Sherlock’s flat to find him sitting across from a plain looking middle aged woman. She was sniffing. Sherlock was handing her a tissue.
Perhaps my lack of observation
, or by Crocker, or by... something else.
Holmes did not look at me openly, but I knew he caught me with the corner of his eye.  “And you have all your facts in order now, Watson?”
"And when you spoke as you did, I thought you meant me.  I thought you meant my feelings, thought I was... giving you a-” I inhaled against his pulse-point- “benediction, I suppose.  To ignore that I loved you so long as I could stay with you.  I thought I was telling you that you did not have to worry about me thinking that a man like you could ever come to feel that way for a man like me.”
When I returned to his side Holmes was on the sofa, his shirt fully removed.  It could not have been easy for him to do that in his condition, but knowing how he loathed being dirty I said nothing.  I sat beside him, cleaning the wound and preparing to stitch it shut.  “I do wish I could have got to this a bit earlier,” I said.  I kept my tone light, for if I was accusing him of something not even I knew what.  Not taking me with him, when he went wherever it was?  Not coming to me at my patient’s club, dripping blood all over the carpets like a ghoul?
“Two?” I did not feign the mild surprise.  I did not, in fact, feign anything.  Holmes’ imbalanced state was almost certainly worsened by my apparent equilibrium, but I assure you I did not play at aloofness to pay him back for all the times he was so with me- or indeed for any reason.  I was simply in the grip of the kind of calm which- in my experience- comes of knowing one’s future is entirely out of one’s hands.  The moment I felt something more definite I would show it to him without hesitation.  “I would think there was only one.”
“You entice me into dangerous enterprises on a regular basis,” I reminded him warmly.  I lifted our joined hands and kissed the back of his, as he had kissed mine that night.  Even now that I had had his lips on mine every second of that touch was emblazoned on my brain.  “Though I wonder that you risked saying as much as you did, if you could see no good end.  If you truly thought I would either refuse you or accept you more out of friendly regard than passion.”  The last thing in the world I had ever known Sherlock Holmes to be was afraid of the truth- but understanding why he had been, I did not know why he had put it to me at all.  I was glad he had, infinitely glad, since it was distinctly possible things would not be as they were now otherwise.  I nuzzled his knuckles to let him know how glad I was he had spoken, even if I had taken the long way around to hearing him.  “I am not sure I would have had the courage.”
happy then.  I was almost relieved when it seemed you could never love me, so long as it also seemed you believed friendship would be enough for me, for it meant I would not have to worry about you giving yourself to me for the wrong reasons.  Or so I thought until you kissed me.”
very great, but looking back on that first night what was most odd was Holmes’ listless yet undeniable desire to make things not odd.
Perhaps what Crocker said should have made a greater impression on me at the time- as it must have on Holmes- for it was quite a neat encapsulation of my own existence.  Perhaps it did not because for all I loved him, for all I wanted things which could never be mine, I often forgot to be discontented for days, even weeks, at a time.  Crumbs from Sherlock Holmes were, I felt, a feast from anyone else.  But in the moment I was unspeakably grateful to our friend the captain for saying and meaning what I could not.  “You... think it possible, yes?”
Until, one afternoon, he noticed me passing through the parlor and roused himself with a small smile.  “You’ve marked this concert, Watson,” he said.  He brandished the paper in which I had done so, not sure as I marked it if he would rouse himself in time for us to attend.  “Should you like to go?”
It had been good of Holmes to say- and gratifying, for me, to hear- that I was not so dense as he sometimes claimed.  Nevertheless, I had been very stupid about this.  I had done precisely what Holmes most often warned against.  I had made assumptions, drawn conclusions in advance of facts.  I had seen... not what I
a cold man, undoubtedly- but just as living things can still dwell beneath a frozen lake in winter, so too was there a greater capacity for sympathy, and more, in Holmes than I was capable of admitting when piqued and with a pen in my hand.  Nevertheless, he was right- and
My primary consolation on the subject was that Holmes must have made a similar mistake.  And from him, being who he was, the error certainly seemed the greater- but I still felt I bore the lion’s share of the blame.  His every move since the Abbey Grange case, when considered through the lens that he was not confronting me about my feelings but attempting to discover what I knew of his own, made as much sense as the opposite- more, in fact.  It was not like Holmes to come at an answered question so obliquely.  Oh, he kept his plots to himself before a case was resolved, and sometimes kept the full resolution to himself even after, but he hated not to have all laid bare somewhere in the middle.  It was difficult, in hindsight, to imagine him dancing so delicately around a question when he was sure of the answer- even if the answer was my entertaining certain softer feelings from which he held himself aloof.  If, on the other hand, the softer feelings were his and he thought them as unreciprocated as I had... that was something else.
It was during this period of domestic joys- for it
He made a disgusted noise and threw up his hands, dashing over to his chair suddenly and sprawling out upon it.  His dressing gown fell apart enough to give me a tempting view of pale skin which I would have dearly liked to touch for no medical reason whatsoever.  He must have felt my eyes on him.  He
“I know,” I replied easily.  I took him as he was, and would do for as long as he was available to me.  I had resolved that long since.  But that did not mean his efforts to mitigate the effect of his actions on me, when he made them, were wasted.  “Your interview with Hopkins was only... rather what I feared when we embarked on this course.”
I attempted to steer the conversation in a safer direction without appearing to do so.  Otherwise I would only sharpen his interest.  “I mean that he was sure of her- or thought he was sure of her- and we cannot actually presuppose that she loved him then after all.  Perhaps he was right and she saw him only as a friend.”
“And this new information?”
This aversion to the softer feelings in him had been my sentence to purgatory ever since that very uncommon occurrence had happened to me, but it had also been my shield.  At one time it had been easy- too easy, in hindsight- to convince myself that my fascination with Holmes, my affection for him, my whole-hearted need to watch him, to see all of him, so much so that if he was the last thing I looked upon in this world I would be content, was simply his due as the most extraordinary man of my acquaintance.  But it is only possible to follow the line of a man’s wrist so many times with a hungry gaze before it becomes obvious that there is desire in play.  And this self-knowledge, once attained, was difficult to ignore; it had become doubly so after I thought him lost to me, and then had him back.  If he did not see that I desired him it was because- as he would say, were these feelings of mine some minute trace of a horrible crime- he was not looking for it.
I winced a little at that.  I did sometimes get carried away with my descriptions of his coldness- but my editors liked them, liked this brain without a heart.  Holmes
“These new men have a habit of hiding their spoils to come back for them later.  Half the plate they stole has been found littered about the property they took it from.”
Odder still was his behavior after we had ostensibly parted for the evening.  Having risen so early and stayed up with him so late, I was very tired by the time I took myself to bed.  I was only beneath the sheets for a few moments when I began to drift, and I only drifted a few moments more before there was a light tapping at my door.  “Holmes?” I said, for though he rarely took it upon himself to knock it could only be he.
*   *   *
“Yes.”  I swallowed.  I had led him to this very question, and now... well.  Now I had to answer it.  “Because an advance cannot be rebuffed if it isn’t made.”
“I thought I might send for another doctor.”
When he was gone, I sat back in my chair.  “That was a stroke of luck,” I said.  “Though of course, once these men
“I should be gratified,” Holmes said.
It was indeed enough.  When I believed him dead, I thought a thousand times over that I would give anything to have him back.  A few sleepless nights and restless days were nothing.  The dull ache I felt knowing it would bring him no comfort if instead of pressing his hands I pressed his lips instead was less than nothing.  The affection, however distant, in his eyes as he pressed my hand in turn was an embarrassment of riches.
“I know,” I replied, holding him more tightly to me.  “That is... I have not expected you to turn out to be a different person all this time, Holmes.  This is shock enough.  In a way, I suppose I shall have to learn you all over again."
For that morning Holmes read to me from the paper; that evening he was almost killed.
“But what business is it of mine, if matters are set aright between them?  I had it clear in my mind what must have happened.  They might never have seen each other again.  What business is it of mine, to see it otherwise?”
"Yes," I agreed, a little breathlessly.
- Holmes had not the energy to try to appease me.  Indeed I sometimes fancied I might be a piece of furniture for all he considered my opinions at such times.  I do not describe it thus out of bitterness- it was difficult for me to see him like that and expect more- but only to make clear how unusual it was to see such a concerted effort on his part to converse naturally.  He must have known by then that I would bear silence from him just as well.  I had borne it for some time, after all- and the silence of him there but unable to speak to me was still so markedly different from the silence of him
“Nonsense,” Holmes said lowly.  “I hold your medical skills in the highest respect.  However should that help?”
“Yes.”  He sighed.  His sleeve tickled the back of my neck.  “But they may not be arrested.  And, if they are, they may be able to prove that they were not there at the Abbey Grange without interference from me.  And either way Hopkins probably has this idea of a second gang firmly enough in his mind that without fresh evidence or pressure from the family nothing will dissuade him.  And this death will join the ranks of the unsolved.”
I behaved instead as if the stability Holmes sought was already attained, and this seemed to soothe him as much as anything did- at least until Inspector Hopkins came to call.
“I’m not sure I understand,” I admitted.
could not love
But then he patted my foot once more and rose.  “I shall be myself again before too long, Watson.  Thank you.”
That made him laugh, though he choked on it when I let my hand move over his, fingertips tracing the fine bones of his hand and threading through his fingers.  I did not know what more I could do, just then, to convince him he did not have to worry about something I might well have done under other circumstances.
I do not exaggerate when I say that for a moment, then, I stopped breathing.  The notion that Holmes wished to comfort me by suggesting that he might one day requite me was nearly ridiculous- and yet it was not ridiculous, for nothing ridiculous could have filled me so to the brim with pained tenderness.  As gently as I could, for I didn’t wish him to think me ungrateful, I said, “That cannot be considered precedented.”
He did not say more, and I wondered if it would be wise to press him further.  Eventually I could not help myself.  “Is it how near two people who loved each other came to a lifetime apart?”
My own thoughts echoed back to me as Holmes regarded me in the easy silence of a man who does not believe he has said anything odd.  He looked at me with such undisguised affection.  He looked at me with fascination, and with something like surprise too, as if he could hardly believe, at times, how much of interest he still found just watching me.  I thought I recognized the expression because I had worn it many times.  And then I thought I must have convinced myself that I saw what I would give the world to see.  But...
“Fine,” I said, releasing him.  “They look fine.”
Holmes set his paper down, slow.
“Thank you, Watson,” he said at last, chin resting on my fingers.  “I think everything is clear to me now.”  His lips moved again, definitely an attempt at a smile.  “Would you... say the same?”
The second came two days later.
It really was all.  I did not see him for most of the day, and many times over the course of it I thought it was absolutely ridiculous- on both our parts- to imagine that silence would do any good whatsoever.  Such feelings, even unspoken, could not be unknown.  But Holmes returned that night, and he smiled, and he told me what he had been doing- looking into young Hopkins’ progress, which was nonexistent- and I could breathe again.
I went to the chair across from him, where his clients- our clients, as he always insisted on calling them, even when I had about as much involvement in the case as the chair itself- often sat.  He regarded me with a strange expression, such that I could not tell if he was glad to have me there for his perusal, or if he wished I would take myself off somewhere else- to the other side of the world, perhaps.  It was possible that he could not tell either.
“How could we be expected to save you?” Victor supplied. “Don’t worry, it’s not an insult to Sherlock’s intelligence. It’s just a matter of his positioning. Sherlock is in the center of things regarding Moriarty. And as you surely found out, tearing down Moriarty’s web from the inside, while seemingly the only way to do it, is a hopeless pursuit at this stage. But we have a theory. If we weaken Moriarty’s web from the outside, then Sherlock will be able to cast the final blow from within. But in order to do that, we need to stay out of the world Sherlock and all your little crime fighting buddies are currently occupying.”
Sherlock left John’s lips again in favor of his neck, and John took the opportunity to gasp as Sherlock’s hands slipped themselves under his jumper, those marvelous fingers dancing along his stomach and then to his back along his spine.
“And now, so will I,” Moriarty whispered. John could feel that he was close again, but kept his eyes closed and head down, not in defeat but because he knew that Moriarty would be frustrated by John's refusal to engage. “But you rebuilt by tearing down didn’t you Johnny? And so I must do the same, shouldn’t I? You tore me down and climbed atop the pieces. So it only makes sense that I’ll have to do the same.”
He felt his voice beginning to grow horse when finally the door of the room slammed open and Moran came storming in.
A black car had pulled up beside him and the window had rolled down.
“Well, shouldn’t he come with us then, get as far away from Sherlock as possible?”
He did however have one lead, kind of anyway. He wasn't sure what this lead could well, lead to, but his old university friend, Victor Trevor, was definitely suspicious. But Trevor had disappeared after he was released and Sherlock didn’t have any way to find him. He even went as far as contacting Oxford to see if they had an address or any contact information on file for Victor Trevor just out of hope that perhaps maybe he was an active alum, despite Sherlock’s strong doubts that such would be the case. But he, like Sherlock, appeared to have more or less disowned the university the second he’d earned his degree.
John opened his mouth to protest, but before he could, Moriarty continued.
It wasn’t until John found himself chained to a wall in Serbia that he realized that this wasn’t going to be as easy as he for a moment had allowed himself to hope. John had spent twelve hours being tortured before Mary was able to stage a rescue. It had been the first time either of them had killed in the name of bringing down Moriarty. John had known that Mary was more determined to keep John’s hands clean of blood than her own, but when Mary made her way through the hovel of a building that John was being held in, taking out ten men with ten bullets, all shots to kill, a wave of the reality of what they were doing overcame John.
Sherlock didn’t have the slightest of leads as to what was causing this supposed miracle. None of the influx of criminals pouring in to be processed had a single thing to say about what led to their arrests. They all were quiet. Too quiet. The worst thing though was that there was some sort of look in their eyes. It was the same look every time. Fear. Or maybe it was relief. Sherlock saw it, but he couldn’t deduce anything from it. But it was there, again and again with every new arrest.
He couldn’t take it anymore, his mind was overloaded, constantly. He’d voiced his frustrations to his brother, not intentionally mind you, only in a fit of frustration after a great deal of probing on Mycroft’s part. He’d been told that it sounded like what Sherlock was experiencing were panic attacks. He knew about panic attacks. He’d seen John have far too many. But the thing about panic attacks was that they were supposed to end. Fifteen minutes of feeling like the world is collapsing in on you and you’re dying, and then you catch your breath and start to move on.
At that time, Holmes was involved in a case he had more than once claimed would be a waste of my talents.  I had- also more than once- argued that what would be a waste of my talents would surely also be a waste of his, but it is true that what I knew of the case suggested it to be simple enough while he was still embroiled in it, and looking back it was indeed of little interest beyond what came of it with regards to relations between Holmes and myself.  He had taken it on only because of the importance of the client; that rather scandalous detail, and what passed between Holmes and I in the aftermath, would combine to make the story unfit for any but purely private recollections even if it had been more dramatic in other respects, but it was not.  It was nothing at all, and it could have cost him dearly.
“It pains you, I’m sure.”
“Yes?”
“Let me get my bag,” I said.  He nodded and sipped his brandy.  To another I would have offered something stronger- but Holmes’ tolerance for pain was high and his tolerance for morphine and laudanum was even higher.  The brandy would have to do.
Holmes hummed.  “Mmm, no.  Either you desired it or you did not- it is no help.”
.  If he had misread my regard from early on, much as I myself once had, time could certainly have compounded the error.  Even he made assumptions sometimes and went astray because they were wrong.  But now... He steepled his fingers.  “You kissed me,” he said again.
I was glad of it when he was finally still, peaceful, and free of care- for though I would have cheerfully kissed him all night I needed time to think.  I had been sure of what Holmes was trying to tell me or I would not have kissed him; I had been right or he would not have kissed me back.  But the fact remained that I had misunderstood him badly before.  Reflection was required if I was to make sense of when and how- and more importantly make sure it did not happen again.
He smiled then, sharply, as if I had spoken his very thoughts aloud for him.  It slashed like lightening across his face.  I think I could see it a thousand times and never grow tired of that look.
I had spent so much of the night before wondering how it was possible that Holmes did not know I loved him- if not because I
But Holmes did not throw me off.  He remained very still beneath my hand, watching me with that same heavy-lidded interest I had found so compelling on countless cases.  But, of course, there was no expression his face could take on, no minute corner of his being, that I did concern myself with most highly.  Even so I did not flatter myself that I knew everything, but I felt I knew enough to think all might still be well between us.
I was, of course, keenly aware that Holmes and I needed to talk.  Likewise, I was aware that I would need to begin.  None of my reflections the night before had led me to a good opening in that regard- because, I suspected, there was none.  I could see a clearing between us in my mind’s eye, but first there were storms to be got through, and I could see nothing for it but to leap out into the rain.  “How do you feel?” I asked.
The first was a visit from Stanley Hopkins.
He was lying back, watching me with softly lidded eyes.  “It should be easier if it was not you.  With regard to... well.  The stipulations of our agreement.”
“Because we were neither of us in full possession of the facts when we made it.”
Threatening me with other doctors was sufficiently of a piece with Holmes' usual sourness when he appeared weak that I would normally have been able to ignore him.  But he had lost blood, he was tired, and he was in pain.  He had also already consumed more brandy than I would have prescribed for purely medicinal reasons.  It all conspired to put a dreaminess in his tone, a kind of tender frankness so sweet that I could not ignore even the smallest twitch of his eye, let alone
I don’t know if even Holmes could read all of that from my expression, but he certainly read something that softened his smile, melted it into something liquid and warm.  I could see that look a thousand times and one, and never grow tired of it.  "I shall have to learn you too," he said, hand sliding backward into my hair.
“Our client should have no more trouble,” Holmes said.  I do not know if I had mustered the wherewithal to ask him about the case, or if he had merely elected to tell me in hopes of lightening the atmosphere.  He succeeded, a little.  Even when he had kept me from much or even most of a case he always said
“You remember the last thing I said to you?”
“I had heard something of it,” Holmes said.  I was at the table in our rooms, Holmes’ forearm resting at the back of my chair.  His voice was perfectly calibrated; it was not too disinterested- as far as Hopkins knew, he had still believed it was the Randalls that night, and he hated to be wrong- but it was not too intense either.
there that I did not have it in me to resent it.
“Victor!” Sherlock cried out. Victor suddenly was caught up with another man, spinning the other man towards a wall, making it so Sherlock couldn’t see the other man's face. The other man made a gesture in the process as if to pull something from his side, but Sherlock couldn't see enough to see what that was. The whole affair looked as if it was made as part of a friendly greeting, but Sherlock couldn’t help but be suspicious that Victor was purposefully hiding the other man’s identity from Sherlock.
After a few minutes he spoke.
“Are you sure?” he whispered. Sherlock’s excitement faltered when he noticed that terrified look in John’s eyes.
Eventually though, he let his mind wander and it ended up on Sherlock.
“What?” John gasped.
“Long time no see Watson,” Victor smirked and John found himself lowering his weapon after Victor released him. They stepped away from the wall. “You really shouldn’t be here. You look like shit, by the way. I mean, in kind of an overworked action star kind of way, but still shit," Victor grinned. "But I supposed I’d have fared worse if I’d spent the past year building a reputation as the most feared man in all the world.”
“I’ve got it!” Sherlock declared. “Dan Morris and Jenny Stevens drowned in a narrowboat accident November 12
“But then maybe you’re a special case.”
“I only smoke menthols when Harrison’s around because they piss him off, even more than regular ones. The man is obsessive with his health and the health of everyone around him. Won’t shut up about all the ways I’m killing myself when he only needs to focus on how the victim was killed, mind you. I usually don’t let him on the scene until after I’ve left, but I can’t do that because of the nature of this case. But if I have to talk to him face to face rather than just read his report, I might as well try and give him lung cancer while I’m at it,” Lestrade shrugged. “How you knew that before I even stepped into the room, I don’t even care to know anymore.”
in any sense of the word, he felt repulsed at the idea of letting someone like Irene Adler anywhere near Sherlock.
“Oh I would. I’m sure your entire social circle will know by the end of the week,”
“I’m sorry, I don’t take demands from children,” Victor responded.
“Yes, alright, your metaphors mean little to me and are not getting me any closer to bringing down Moriarty,” Sherlock said, trying to peer past Lestrade into the building.
Moran may have taken those men’s lives, but John had to carefully rip away the rest of them.
“Yes, thank you Molly. I deeply appreciate it. If we’d had to wait for the Met to get the results it would have taken days,” Sherlock had hung up the phone and turned back to the woman,
“Yes. Both of us. Unless I’m misunderstanding the situation, but I am, as you’ve stated, a genius after all," Sherlock grinned at John, but his smile did't quite reach his eyes. "But there is a criminal mastermind, although apparently one who is much more boring than I initially anticipated, loose in London imminently causing chaos so I really think that it would be best if we stop being held back by repressed emotions.”
John’s hands dropped from his face and he looked at Mary in alarm.
“Shit,” John collapsed onto the sofa, holding his head in his hands. “What do we do?”
Huxley had adamantly denied that he was the one who had killed the assassin. He continued to claim that while he did in fact possess a weapon, the one that had been recovered in the abandoned flat he had been squatting in was not his. Sherlock had half the mind to believe him, but as far as what the evidence pointed to, manslaughter was added to Huxley’s apparently rather long list of charges.
“What happened?”
He pulled back from Sherlock and looked him in the eyes.
“So you do have suspects! Why are you always so slow? Have you brought them in for questioning yet?” Sherlock asked, stopping his pacing to climb up into his chair like a cat and perch, hands steepled to think about the new information.
“So are you just completely useless to me?” Sherlock snapped. He began pacing back and forth across the room, wishing he could get himself to
“The--? Look Sherlock, if you take a moment and explain I’m sure we can get a whole team of people together to research whatever it is you’re after.”
“But Moriarty is active again, John, that puts you at risk! I said I wouldn’t let him hurt you again and I meant it,” Sherlock said in exasperation.
John looked down at Sherlock who was gazing up at him with confusion.
The conversation had gone nowhere helpful. Victor reminisced about some incident from university that Sherlock had deleted involving Sherlock stealing a car to drive out to a local farm to “borrow” a pig carcass to run experiments on. Apparently, the corpse had experienced some sort of rupture and intestinal fluid and blood left a massive stain in the trunk of the car. The car, as why would Sherlock steal the unlocked 1980 Citroën 2CV that Victor had apparently suggested when he could steal the Jag, had belonged to the son of some politician with an OBE. Apparently, the twat had become convinced that someone had been murdered in the back of his car. A full investigation was immediately launched, but came to a screeching halt when the results came back from the lab and pig’s blood was found. Sherlock was never caught. Oh, how the tabloids had been in an uproar when they found out, Victor told Sherlock, laughing uproariously
“Ah, yes. Lovely seeing you again,” Sherlock muttered shoving his hands in his pockets defensively. They ran across something fine and jagged. A business card. John had printed a bunch up a while ago and had taken to sticking them in Sherlock’s pockets when he thought Sherlock wouldn’t notice him lingering by the coat stand. Sherlock himself of course never gave anyone a business card, but he kept them stored in his pocket because even before their official dalliance began, Sherlock had to admit he had gotten off a bit on the feeling to John’s fingers brushing across his hips through the lining of his jacket whenever John would reach into his pockets to extract a card to give to a potential client.
"Damn it Mycroft," Victor muttered. "He really didn't tell you anything."
But John wasn’t the same person he was back then. That John’s eyes twinkled at the mention of danger. That John would follow Sherlock to the ends of the earth and couldn’t live without him. That John wanted to be consumed by the Sherlock bubble, that infamous space that John had spent the past year avoiding. Victor had been lucky enough to get sucked back into it when a part of John still wished somehow it had been him instead.
“Yes, of course, I’m just a person. Nothing like you. You know what, Sherlock, I think maybe I need to take a break from this, from all of this. Maybe, maybe I’ll go see if Harry’s in one of those rare clean periods and is feeling generous enough to let me crash on her couch. Or is pissed enough not to notice, doesn’t really matter. I just feel like I’m slowing you down. ”
“Yeah,” John responded lazily, looking back down from Sherlock to his reading. There was a report on new advances in skin grafting. The advances were mostly cosmetic, nothing about the time it takes to heal, lowering the chances of graft-versus-host disease developing, or anything else that would seem more medically pertinent. But John knew that people, of course, did care about their looks, and skin grafts that looked more like there had never been a graft at all would mean a lot to burn victims, and the quality of life they would feel that they could have after their injury. John had to admit that if the scars he bore could have been healed so there were no traces of them, he’d be more than glad to not have to unearth unwanted memories every time he looked in the mirror.
. Why couldn’t he have water? Was he expected to need surgery?
“You care for me as well,” Sherlock said far too simply. The implication of his words hung in the air though, and suddenly London felt so small, like it was closing in on him.
Mycroft was silent.
Sherlock collapsed back into his seat.
“He’s right, or that was at least the case with the other two,” Lestrade confirmed. “How did you know?”
