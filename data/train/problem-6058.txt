“Aw, don’t be jealous. Love you too babe,” Tony said. He gave Steve’s hand a quick squeeze before planning a kiss on his cheek.
Tony walked behind the prisoner like a lion stalking his prey. He held his bloody hands loosely behind his back. His smile was relaxed and easy as if nothing was wrong. But Steve could sense a cold anger hidden underneath the surface. It was something about his eyes. Something about the Cheshire curl of his smile. Something about his posture that screamed ‘boss.’
Tony grinned as he pushed Steve’s hand away. “Well, he’s going to hear it soon anyway. What’s the harm in starting early? ‘Tony, you’re so tight,’” Tony quietly moaned as he walked his fingers up Steve’s chest. “‘I love how your tight ass squeezes my dick.’ ‘Feels so good ramming my cock into your hole.’ ‘I’m going to fill you full of come you dirty slut.’ And don’t forget my favorite, ‘Sit that slutty ass on my lap and fuck yourself on my cock. I want to see your dick bouncing up and down as you take it like the hungry bitch you are.”
Natasha sighed. The same type of sigh adults gave their children when telling them there were no monsters under the bed. “I told you Steve, don’t worry about it. I got information from a reliable source that the owners won’t notice a thing.”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Tony said with a disgusted smirk. “Who knows? Someday you might be a better liar than Loki.”
Bit of housekeeping; I spent some mones during the Stony Trumps Hate auction and I got you guys some art. It's not directly from the fic, but I specifically requested this scene and Domon did an amazing job. Go check them out. Leave a like, reblog, or shower them with love.
Steve shook his head, but the smile remained on his lips. “What I’m trying to say is, I love every part of you. Even your crazy early fanboy days. You don’t have to worry about him doing or saying something that embarrasses you. It’s not going to make me stop loving you.”
Steve started with Tony’s balls, teasing him with quick kisses from soft lips and hard teeth. He moved up Tony’s shaft, kissing his way up until his lips were only a hair’s breadth away from Tony’s head. Tony gasped as Steve blew a warm breath of air over the damp sheet.
“So what’s shakin’ bacon?” asked Natasha, handing out the hot dogs in her hands. “Sam told me a little bit before I had to get up and get some dogs.”
“Mister Stark,” Natasha said with an equally polite curtsy as she closed the gate behind her black lace dress.
Rumlow chuckled as he cracked his fingers. “Well, no matter. I know your name and I know your face. It’ll only be a matter of time before I ruin you both. Maybe I’ll start with Rogers and work my way up. Hear the fuehrer is always looking for people to experiment on. Aryan or not, bet he’s got some good screams in him. He’ll make a fine test subject.”
“Keep the door open, please,” Tony said with a knowing smile. “I want to see if our guest is dumb enough to make a run for it.”
Steve backed up a few paces, murderous rage in his eyes. He shook off the pain and ran toward Iron Man again, screaming for blood. Steve made contact with the suit shoulder first, but the suit was stronger than mortal flesh.
He dug his palm into his shoulder and rolled over on his injured side, trying his best to put pressure on the injury and lessen the blood flow. Bright sparks from following shots danced by his face as he tried to plan his next move. He curled in on himself and tried to drag his injured body to safety. A few bullets leave burning grazes through his clothes and on his naked skin. He cowered behind a wooden crate and soon enough, the shots of gunfire had stopped, and the sound of breaking bones replaces the silence.
Across the aisle separating the two families, Steve screamed bloody murder. “I’m gonna make your rich ass face lick pavement when I’m done with you.”
“I have you,” Tony said with a grin. He let out a big yawn as he sank into the covers. “That’s all I need.”
“Why not Obie?” Tony almost yelled in untampered rage. “Should I wait for more innocent people to die because of me? Or should I just start a gun racketeering business to get the job done faster. Maybe I’ll start an all-out war with the criminal underground just to get my point across.”
“Things are better. People are happier. Town’s safer. The future’s looking brighter than ever. But to me, everything looks dimmer since you left, and I don’t know what to do to make it better,” Tony says, swirling the amber liquid around in his hands.
“That’s why I didn’t tell you I was Iron Man,” he admitted, pulling the rope tight, not caring if the harsh abrasions gave the man a wicked rope burn. “Everyone who’s affiliated with me ends up getting hurt in some way. I just- I just didn’t want you to be another causality.”
Tony looked up and his jaw dropped at the same time as Bucky swung himself over the fence and down into the werewolf enclosure.
“My workshop,” replied Tony with a complicated look. “But my new one is currently under construction right now, and the one at work has people that I’d rather not see.” There was a story behind there, but Steve didn’t push. “You should come and see it some time. Got all the latest toys. Can’t promise anything, but should be a fun time.”
Steve gulped. This dame really seemed like she knew her stuff. “Tony. He said he worked here as an engineer. He gave me his card.” Steve reached into his back pocket and felt the tip of a thick piece of paper. He almost yanked it apart as he thrust the crumpled up business card, still warm with his body heat, into her manicured hands. She looked at in in silence.
The grunt hissed through gritted teeth. “Not sold. A gift so Hydra can peruse our righteous purpose.”
Tony tried to push himself up, but his arms flailed about like overcooked noodles. “Shit. What’s wrong with me? I should be able to do this.”
Steve licked his lips at the sight of Tony’s dusty nipples pebbling up in the cool air. But something was wrong. Tony’s chest was riddled with scars, but none of them made any sense. Raised flesh branched out from the center of Tony’s chest like tree roots searching for water. But the area over Tony’s heart, the place the scars should have been thickest, was completely smooth.
could look at other men that way without having to worry about getting fire and ostracized. Sure, Tony was fine with sex behind closed doors or blowjobs in back alleys. He could make do. But it would be nice to enjoy the simple things in life. Nothing big, Tony wasn’t that delusional, just small, simple gestures. The stuff girls took for granted; awkward flirting with someone you like, holding hands, standing under the moonlight wrapped in each other’s embrace, those type of things.
“Hey, Steve. How’s it going? I heard you had a shitty date,” Tony slurred, a tray of raw meat balanced precariously against his hip.
Steve let up on the pressure on the guy and took the card with his blade wielding hand. He blinked in confusion. This side was blank. He turned it over and that side was blank too. Quickly, he moved to try and get better lighting on the card. Maybe it’s in that really fancy ink that only shows up in certain light. He spun it, and again nothing.
Tony just stared wide-eyed at Steve. “They’re not going to report me?” he said, feeling like someone had just knocked the air out of his doughy heart.
"What?!" Steve could hardly believe his ears. Did Tony know what he was agreeing to? This wasn’t as easy or innocent as a walk in the park. They could all go to jail for this.
“Uh… because they’re your friends,” Steve offered because only a dead man would not see the obvious connection. But considering the hours that Tony kept during these last two weeks of hell, he might be a lot closer to passing out and sleeping like the dead then Steve would like to admit. What did Tony say he was on? Thirty-two hours and his fifth cup of coffee. Not the best recipe for sanity. “And why didn’t you tell me you were friends with the Iron Family?”
It was a nice day at the park. Birds chirped in the fresh spring air of the Lower Eastside. Children amused themselves with a game of kick the can. Schmidt screamed at people in a heavy German accent to join the FONG (Friends of New Germany) and preached about the God-like savior of Germany, known as Hitler. Well, aside from the verbal assault on American values, nice day in the park.
Something on Tony’s end fell to the ground with a loud clatter. “I’m not,” replied Tony, his voice slightly higher pitched than normal. “It’s just a casual association. Pulled a few favors for the boss. Nothing big.”
Steve desperately wanted to say no. He could find another way. Would find another way, but they were out of time and at the end of their resources. They were at the end of the line. Begrudgingly, Steve gave nodded in approval. “Let’s just get what we need and get out of here.”
“But how?” asked Steve. Why would a beautiful Russian angel bless them with her presence now of all times?
Tony groaned as he plopped down next to a table and buried his head in his arms. That’s it. He was ruined. Leave it to Barton and his big mouth to make a whole lot of nothing out of a little event. Not being het was fine in private (Tony and his lieutenants grew up in the 20s where freedoms of all kinds were welcome. Hell, Tony encouraged any show regardless of type or orientation as long as all parties were of sound age and consent). But in the cutthroat business world, it was hide or die. For the most part, Tony could care less what the media or other people thought of his "unconventional hobbies." But with Obie in the mix, that changed everything.
Bruce clipped the end of the last stitch and Tony rubbed at the sore injury. “I hate you,” he grumbled.
Tony gave a breathless nod. “Well!” Tony asked between shorts gasps of air, stretching his arms wide as if to say ‘look at all this shit I have to deal with’. “Now do you feel like an idiot?” Tony threw his helmet to the ground with a resounding and satisfying clunk.
Natasha hushed his with a pointed look. “See. Captain America eats his strawberries. You should have some too.”
Tony took the box and gingerly pushed back the lid. Inside was a large, gold band. Perfectly measured to fit around Steve’s ring finger. The arc reactor was engraved on the inside of the band along with the words, ‘Protector of my heart.’ It was corny and sentimental, but it made Steve smile every time Tony said it to him.
. Pepper called it was mindless noise. Rhodey, who absolutely loved jazz, called it cats on a keyboard. “Aint’ no way that stuff could be popular,” he once told Tony. But Tony loved it. Musical chaos Tony often called it. It had just enough of a beat that it didn’t dissolve into discord and just enough crazy that it pissed everyone else right the fuck off.
That is if Steve ever forgave him. Once Tony got his revenge, he could become that type of mobster easily. Using his money and resources to help those less fortunate. Steve would like that. Tony swore, in his muddled state of sleep deprivation, that he would do all that for Steve in a heartbeat. That is, if Steve ever came back.
Iron Man batted away the gun like it was nothing before landing a punch right in the kisser. Steve went down like a ton of bricks, shocked that he hadn’t been knocked out by the intensity of the hit.
“But you’ll still wear the engagement ring, right?” asked Steve. “I want to see the guys lose their shit when they find out I proposed.”
In the back of his mind, Tony heard metallic panes of the garage door rolled up with a loud ‘rata tat tat.’ He turned his attention just in time to hear a sharp hiss filled the tense air as gas flooded out and up the garage door. The same garage door right where Tony had left Rhodey and Pepper to fend for themselves.
“I’ll be going out to buy those modified suits you ordered special from the Van Dyne’s while you have a meeting with General Ross and Captain Blonsky,” Pepper reported from the schedule on her clipboard.
“Do the rest of you understand?” Iron Man said, turning his attention to the cowering children.  “My men of Iron will protect you from anything. But if you so much as utter a word of treachery to anyone, you better pray to whatever Gods you have that fate intervenes. Because I will not be as merciful. I know what it means to be in pain,” he said, tapping the glow in his chest. “Now, imagine my pain transferred tenfold to you.” His voice began to rise with the gravity of the warning.
Tony pushed through the crowd, trying to part the Red Sea. He paid no mind to the grunts of annoyance and complaints of inconvenience coming from minions in suits. He had to get to Steve. He had to explain everything and he didn’t have much time. A finger’s length away from the blond man, Tony reached out and grabbed at the bare bicep.
In Schmidt’s hands was a weapon Tony swore he had taken off the production line weeks ago. The prosthetic arm Tony had designed and sent off with Obie as an afterthought was now in Schmidt’s greedy hands; bigger and stronger than any sketch Tony had sent down to R&D. The fingers on the hand had been altered and reinforced with a heavy metal; now made for breaking necks and spilling blood. The sight of shoddy workmanship, exposed gears, pistons, and metal gleaming in cold in the light, sent shivers down his spine. What was this monstrosity?
Natasha feigned annoyance. “Please. I’m a big girl Steve. Found myself a real job and everything. Pays well too.” she said with a smile, as if finally settling into her own skin.
“If you don’t have any objections,” Steve murmured as his eyes fluttered shut. “I’ll just help myself.” He drifted forward into Tony’s space and Tony, not really able to think of a reason not to, leaned in to meet Steve halfway.
“That’s what I came to talk to you about,” Steve interrupted, as if explaining would make everything better. “We got jumped real bad today. Guys had Tommy guns and grenades that did damage like I’ve never seen. Almost collapsed a whole building on top of us. We need arms from the Iron Family to protect ourselves.”
Rumlow’s face flushed beat red with anger. He raised his gloved hand, charging up the energy for a point blank blast. “Why you little-”
“Watch me,” Tony said defiantly as he walked toward the elevator. As much as he wanted to chase after Steve, that would have to wait. If he wanted something as massive as shutting down his company, he needed to do it himself and it needed to be done yesterday. Yes, it would be bad for business and the stocks, but if he could pull it off-
“Aw, Steve. You’re going to give me cavities with how sweet you are,” Tony say, wrapping his arms around the back of Steve’s neck.
Steve agreed with Bucky. The corporate feel radiating off the military rows of warehouses didn’t bode well in his gut. Place was too clean. Not a patch of red rust in sight despite the drops of Atlantic water spraying across the cement dock. Plenty of shadows to hide in, but not a single light in the row of lampposts flickered from shoddy filament.
Tony kicked the man in the side to test if he was alive. Nothing. A little more brave, and a lot more angry, he stabbed the heel of his foot into a dark red tinted wound. The inhuman cry as the goon cried out, his eyes rolling up into his head, was beyond satisfying. Absolutely worth the green Tony would have to fork over to get rid of the blood off his shoes.
. Seeing Steve like that; knuckles covered in blood, teeth bared, veins popped and tinted blue, it made Tony’s heart skip a beat every time Steve landed a hit. Never in his wildest dreams would Tony have though to describe a man kicking the living shit out of another man to be arousing.
Steve slung one of Sam's arms over his shoulder to help him with the pain and give the guy a moment to catch his breath. “They ain’t messing around no more,” gasped Sam.
“Right,” Tony said, shifting himself a few steps away from the deadly woman. Natasha was a good person and Tony trusted her with his life, but sometimes when she smiled, a voice in the back of Tony’s head told him to run away as fast as he could.
When Steve found out Tony was Iron Man, the first emotion he felt was relief. Now, having had time to think about it, Steve’s feelings were more complex. Relief was still there but so was confusion, fear, anger, and sense of betrayal.
But someone else had other ideas. A gentle kiss on his cheek pulled Tony away from his extra five minutes.
‘Maybe there’s another way,’ he thought, ambling over to the large plush couch in the corner of the workshop. He flopped down face first, allowing the makeshift bed to swallow him up in a warm embrace. The perfect mix of soft and firm reminded his fatigued brain of a certain angry someone.
This couldn’t be Tony, and yet the heartbreaking look on Tony’s face told him that it was. The man that Steve had grown to love was a farce. A façade for something Steve always wished he could have, but when presented with the glimmer of hope, crushed the too good to be true dream with a dirty, sullied reality.
Steve kissed like he fought. Each touch oozed confidence and precision. He knew all of Tony’s weak points and exploited them at will. Steve’s right hand cradled Tony’s unshaven jaw, gently coaxing his head up and out of the pillows. His left hand snaked around Tony’s waist all the way down to his ass. Strong fingers squeezed the supple flesh. Steve’s tongue,
Steve’s heart skipped a beat as a lovesick grin spread across his face. Goddamn, Tony was beautiful. How had Steve gotten so lucky?
Joe shrugged his shoulders in passive interest. “Enough to keep you alive, if that’s what you’re concerned about. But not enough to get you into trouble. And I assume, from the size of your street gang and the size of your pocket book that you’d like to stay out of trouble.”
Steve’s shoulder slumped over in despair. He held his head in his hand with just enough support to keep his head above water. “I think he’s a part of the inner circle,” he mumbled in confession.
“Get ‘em out quick.” A muted voice crackled over the radio. Behind the firing squad, familiar forms scurried in and out of the cars.
“Absolutely not,” snapped Tony. “We’re putting that thing right back where we found it. Give it here, kid.”
A breath caught in his throat. Steve tried to swallow it and push it down along with the horrible truth, but he couldn’t bring himself to lie. Now not. Not to Sam. He squeezed his eyes shut, forcing through the pain. “Tony is part of the Iron Family,” he said, hanging his head in shame.
“Uh huh,” Tony nodded. “I wanna hear about what you did during the war. The comic dad keeps in his office says you did some really neat things, but he also says they’re just an exaguration and I shouldn’t fill my mind with such nonsense.”
He didn’t look the least bit attractive, yet Steve’s hands turned clammy as he took in the sight of his boyfriend. His heart beat loudly in his chest and his lips suddenly felt dry. That confession must have done something to him, because Steve felt like he was falling in love all over again. “Good morning Tony.”
“Pepper, I’m not going back," he said putting his foot down. How many times did they have to have this conversation? "Blood for blood. That’s how it works. You come after the boss of the Iron Family with his own weapon, don’t expect to get away with it. What happened to me, with the shrapnel bomb, I’m damn lucky to still be walking around let alone be alive. Yinsen and Bruce patched me up, helped me recover enough to build the arc reactor, but there are people who weren’t as lucky as me. I saw them Pep. I saw their pain. I watched them die and there was nothing I could do about it.”
“That’s okay,” said the kid as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. “I’m sure I’ll like anything you pick out.”
A wave of relief washed over Steve. “Thank goodness,” he said, barely able to contain tears from running down his face. He held Tony’s face between his hands, not wanting to look away even for a second. “I was afraid I lost you both.”
The armor. If only they had the armor. But it wasn’t ready. Heads were safe. But bodies… The idea was tangled up in his head, tangled in wires and logistics. He need more time, more space to work, but that was an impossibility now. The code dictated a return hit, within twenty four hours was more effective. Too soon. His men weren’t ready. The gifts were far from ready. The world was crashing down on his shoulders once again and he wasn’t fucking ready to deal with it yet.
“I’m good. I like spending time with you,” Steve said in a voice so soft Tony wanted to wrap himself up in it like a blanket.
Tony cradled the memory close to his chest, trying his hardest not to cry. Would Steve ever look at him like that ever again? Maybe, if he was really good. Tony could be good. He really could, but if he couldn’t? Tony clung to the memory, changing it into a dream as he imagined what could have happened next. Steve moving preciously into Tony’s space. Tony brushing his knuckles against Steve’s jawline. Steve’s breath hitching as Tony leaned forward. Beautiful blues engulfed in black desire. Soft lips grazing against each other at a teasing distance.
“You’re seeing things again, Jan,” said Tony because someone had to stay grounded in reality. “There’s no way he’d be looking for me.”
For a moment, Tony had thought Steve had given up like any sane person. But Steve reached behind him and pulled something out of the shadows. He charged again, sharp shovel expertly raised in the air and aimed right at him. “Like hell we will!”
Tony would have been offended if the captain wasn’t so cute. And yes, Tony did stare at that ass for longer than necessary as he walked away. But that didn’t mean Tony was stupid enough to hope.
No talking about how his feelings for Kevin should have set off some alarms that he wasn’t straight. No advice about how he should have accepted his sexuality years ago instead of repressing it well into adulthood. No words of warning about how Steve’s voice made his heart melt and how Tony had used it as an excuse for so many things. No talking about his falling out and reconciliation with Steve. No details about his now very full life with Steve. Not a word about their relationship.
“What the hell are you trying to do?” asked Stane, removing the needle off the record before removing a hand from his ear.
Right. Possible death. No time for flirting. “Well I don’t hear any better ideas coming from you, smart guy,” said Tony, feigning annoyance.
But Tony understood. A friend got hurt. Tony would do the same if he was in Steve’s position. Acting overprotective about the littlest thing.  Hell, he did that and more after the attack in Boston.  Tony waved it off. “No, it's okay. Just got an idea for some stuff at work. We're square.”
The smile disappeared from Tony’s lips. He ran a hand through his dirty hair and let out a heavy sigh. “Don’t know,” Tony said. “Bucky didn’t get a chest full of shrapnel like me, so he might be okay. Then again, Bruce is the only doctor here. Last time Bruce
“Maybe you should be dating him instead of me,” Steve said, the beginnings of a smile flickering in the corners of his mouth.
And just like that, they did. Thor hopped down to Steve and gently took the unconscious Barnes from Steve’s weak grip. He moved Barnes’ arm close to his chest, trying not to jostle the limb, and then lifted him up to the gurney Sam and Bruce had waiting.
The white noise of his frenzy began to dissipate. “What?” he asked, voice somewhere between hysterics and a cautious whisper.
She had that look on her face again. The one that looked like all the energy had been drained from her body, and not in the post sex type of way. “Tony-”
Tony was offended, not that he had any ground to stand on with his own history escaping medical facilities. Tony wanted to say that money wasn’t an issue. He could take care of everything and Bruce would probably waive any fee anyway when he found out ‘grease monkey’ here was a friend of Steve’s. But he couldn’t. It wasn’t his place. He liked what he and Steve had right now and didn’t want to mess it up by bringing money into the mix. Especially the amount of money he made. Money always made everything messy. And that last thing he wanted or needed right now was chaos in his private life.
“I can’t say for sure, but I have a hunch,” said an unfamiliar voice. An average Joe stepped out from behind Clint. An unassuming suit with a receding hairline and a simple smile. He was very well put together despite the prior fray. “I saw some cars parked on the side of the road before I came in. Didn’t think too much about it, but I’m pretty sure I saw a few faces belonging to the Hydra gang.”
His body had been doing that a lot lately, feeling things for people he had only just met. But Steve was different and it bothered him. Like a twitch in his leg that he just couldn’t shake off. Tony needed Steve like he needed air to breathe. Not that it was a bad thing. Steve was very attractive. His blue eyes were mesmerizing, his smile, absolutely dazzling. The very firm muscles under a too tight shirt were an instant plus. But there was something more to him. This wasn’t just lust. Tony’s interest in Steve went beyond skin deep, and that bothered him.
Slowly realizing where that thought process lead, Tony scrunched his face. He must really be tired if he was thinking of Steve after all that had happened. He flipped over on his side and tried to look at the other options. However, as hard as he tried not to think about it, the haze of physical and emotional fatigue slowly began to infect his brain with sappy and sweet thoughts of impossible possibilities.
Tony frowned in disappointment. Bruce shrugged, but Tony refused to acknowledge Bruce’s doubt. He looked away, deciding to focus on comforting the still shocked Steve.
"Yes!" said Tony enthusiastically. He looked like he was about to take off for the moon. "Well, not literally, but the idea is still the same. See-"
Tony puffed his chest, face becoming blotchy and red with anger. “Well, I think it is my damn business when you come asking for something like that. It’s my family you’re asking!”
“Yeah,” Steve huffed in agreement. “Had a picture of their first hit here hung up like a fucking trophy. Basically admitted that I helped spark the flame that hit the Hydra base a few weeks back.”
"Don't know," admitted Sam. " But here's what I figure, this isn't some new group trying something big to make their mark. All that damage in one night, someone's gotta be rolling in green for all the manpower and munitions required for the job."
From within the ice, a pair of ocean blue eyes stared into his soul. A small breath passed Captain America’s lips, through it was hardly strong enough to be called a breath. His eyes were hazy and unfocused, but his gaze never faltered as Tony flitted back and forth in the water. The captain looked at Tony almost as if he could see him. His half-lidded eyes pulling Tony in like a silent siren’s song, asking him for help. Begging Tony not to turn away.
“Right.” Time and place. Time and place. “Point is, somebody has been stealing some big, really dangerous items from my company. On record, we’re missing grenades, semi-automatics, military grade stuff.”
Steve was about to ask what happened, but Tony shook his head. He wasn’t done yet. Brown eyes locked in blue, Tony fingers drifted to the center of the flawless skin. He rubbed small circles into the flesh until something crackled underneath his fingers. Steve’s mouth dropped open as some sort of fabric or plastic covering fell away under Tony’s touch. As Tony pulled away the wrapping, a hypnotizing blue light filled the room.
“Wow… um… thanks,” Tony stammered. Very much at a loss for words. His entire face felt sunburnt. “You’re pretty swell, too, Steve.”
Before he realized it, Tony was rushing over to Steve’s side. “It’s okay Steve. I’m right here,” Tony said, trying to console his friend with a reassuring touch.
He started swimming back to the ship, darting behind the occasional ice floe or glacier to help hide his presence from the ship’s radar. But just as the ship’ anchor was coming into view, Tony spotted something out of the corner of his eye. Something small. Something blue. Something that didn’t belong in the ocean.
The ceiling in the living room cracked. Dust and bits of insulation rained down on their heads. Furniture jumped up and down with each wave of energy. Something large shattered in the kitchen as the entire facility was engulfed in a blinding flash.
Fast as he could, Tony made his way back to the garage door. Finding adequate cover, he ducked down just in time to hear the screams of repulsor blasts. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Rescue and War Machine doing the good work and punching those cards.
“Tony, I…” Steve stammered. He knew what he wanted to say, but he just couldn’t fine the right words to express it. “It’s just... I want to but… Bucky is…”
Steve hummed. “Never thought about it before. Always thought I’d die from sickness or from the war before I ever got hitched. If I did think about it, I always thought it’d be quick. Need to be. Didn’t want my partner to have time to second guess themselves before hitching themselves to a mistake like me.”
Rumlow’s eyes raked over the weapon suspiciously. Squaring his shoulders, he looked up at Schmidt, a small smirk lifting one side of his face. “Sure is a pretty doll you got there boss. You sure you trust me with her?”
‘Ms. Potts’ gave the card a disinterested once over as if she was examining the finish on her nails. “What was your name again?”
Steve’s happiness level dropped. His sad puppy eyes Bucky always talked about were out for sure. “Don’t tell me that they haven’t done anything to congratulate you yet?”
“Yay! Pancake party!” He skipped down the hallway, holding Steve’s hand all the way to the elevator.
There will be no update next week because I'm going to visit family for Golden Week. (Guess which country I'm in.)
Pepper sighed. “I thought-” She stopped midsentence, trying to figure out the best way to say what was on her mind. “You’ve been so stressed the last couple of days. I thought bringing Steve up would help. Whenever you had a spare second, you’d go on and on about him. When I found him in the lobby, I thought-” Her voice died out, running out of ways to say what she felt.
Steve gave an affirming nod and both Bucky and Sam, holding a bottle each, moved to the bar to prepare so Thor could pour the drinks. Steve stayed back to keep an eye on the operation. If the Iron Family insisted having extra eyes on the lookout for trouble, woe be it to the Brooklyn Boys if they didn’t follow suit.
“So by all means,” she said, with a careless air. “Open a random box. Just don’t come to me when your face melts off because you get a glance of some experiment gone awry. You never know if the stuff here is just put away for later or put away for good.”
With hesitant eyes, the associates turned their eyes toward the scene. Centimeters away from Clint’s intact head, was a fresh hole and a still red hot bullet embed in the wall.
Even if Thor was a fob (fresh off the boat immigrant) he knew some American mannerisms. Enough to know that kissing another man like that was not appropriate. But, being boisterous and lovable Thor, he picked and choose what rules to follow. Partly because he was basically a big blond puppy dog that loved to love others in a very skinship sort of fashion. Mostly because people didn't expect him to know any better and just went along with the charade. And a little bit was because it pissed off Bucky. But Bucky's reaction made the grand gestures of familiarity all the more enjoyable, so who could blame them.
“Hell yeah I do!” said Tony, almost jumping up from his spot in the sand. He raced over to Steve’s bench as if Steve had fresh baked cookies and a glass of warm milk.
Tony shook his head, hair fluffed up from hands frequently running through the dark follicles. A dark grease stain ran along his temple. “Nothing important. Just that starving artist is a good look for you.”
Hawkeye came out of the shadows, a confident smirk plastered on his face. “I wouldn’t have to do this if you didn’t keep running off on your own all the time. I know you’re stressed, but damn, that kiss.”
Steve snapped to attention. Tony? Was it really Tony? Steve had been absentmindedly scanning the park, but Tony was the last thing he expected to see out here. His clothes were to nice to fit Steve’s original profile. But the distinctive facial hair,  Steve would recognize that anywhere. He was dressed to the nines compared to when Steve saw him last. Bright red dress shirt and pressed pants made him stick out in brown neighborhood. Couldn’t be Tony. Could it? What was Tony doing here of all places?
“Will he be okay?” Steve asked. His voice sounded weak. No wonder considering as his mind and body were still in shock.
“Which reminds me,” Tony jumped flawlessly on the tangent.  “I should get a present for him. I haven’t had such a good plan for a hit in a long time.”
"You sure we can trust him Steve?" asked a voice from the catwalk that ran the length of the warehouse. Knowing Bucky, he was already laying down like a cat with the crosshairs of their only rifle focused in on Tony’s head.
“Hey, big guy. I brought breakfast,” Tony said, showing off the tray of meat pressed against his hips.
Steve pursed his lips. His hands gripped the mug until his knuckles turned white. “I guess, you could say that. Yeah, we were lovers. We never said anything to make it official, but I loved you. And you loved me. That’s all there was to it.”
In his gut, Steve wanted to reach out and reassure Tony that everything was okay. He had just met the guy, but he wanted to touch him and take some of the pain away. Any part of it. Even the smallest bit would help. A juvenile part of him wished could kiss it and that would make it all better.
The tension in Steve’s body melted away. Tony wanted to see him. He came all this way in the middle of the night, just to say ‘hi.’ He felt like a fool for feeling this way, but knowing that he was special enough for Tony to come out of his way to visit, it made all the troubles in his life slip away for a second.
“I thought so, but he just looked so sad. I couldn’t just leave him alone,” Steve said, running a hand through the kid’s soft hair.
Steve frowned. He didn’t like being treated like this. Steve wasn’t useless. He could take care of himself. He could clean his own damn hands if he really wanted to. But the longer Steve waited to voice his opposition, the more he thought about how nice it would be to feel Tony’s fingers caressing the back of Steve’s hand. How gentle those rough fingers would be against Steve’s damaged flesh. How intimate and quiet something like this could be.
War Machine gave them a quick murderous glare before retorting, “Tell your Captain to keep his mitts off our Engineer and there won’t be anything to discuss.”
Two sets of footsteps thundered up behind him, and then skidded to a halt. “Holy shit,” Sam loudly swore in shock. “What happened?”
Tony shook the thought from his head. He didn’t have time to think about that now. He had to focus on getting back to the ship and making himself presentable.
The covering fools slowed their attack. Frequent “pings” of bullets were now one every few seconds. Perfect.
Steve inspected the stranger. Basic observations, nothing more. Average height for a male. Steady scruff of hair along the jawline (ruled out mafia. Mafia weren't allowed facial hair). A little shifty, but didn’t look like the trouble makin’ variety. Shifty like those who just came off the boat lookin’ for a better lot in life.
“Tony!” yelled Rhodey as he clomped out of the cockpit, still clad in his War Machine suit. He saw Steve holding Tony’s hand and glared at the man. “What’s going on back here?”
Rhodey had a very satisfied look on his face. Like the cat that just caught the canary, he had it all figured out. “But you’d like that, wouldn’t you.”
He could trust his lieutenants and butler with just about anything. Obie, well, Obie’s approval meant more to him than anything. He couldn’t find out that Tony was bi. Or that he was a mob boss. Or that he lost his virginity at the age of 13 while under the influence of four different types of narcotics. Important things like that.
He waited on pins and needles, preparing himself for a shit storm. Who could it possibly be at this time of night? Insomniatic inventors looking for a late night muse? Late night sea hands checking for anything out of the ordinary?
Rumlow gave Tony a wide, toothy smile. “Every single word,” he said, punctuating each syllable. “Well, every word that was important. Kept going in and out of consciousness. Do you know how hard it is to try and play possum while a couple of cake-eaters fuck their brains out in front of you?”
Steve didn’t give him the chance. He rushed at the goon hard and fast. Left hook to an eye. Upper cut to the jaw. Elbow to the gut. Heel dug into toes. Reopening wounds until the cement floor was a sea of red. With each hit from Steve’s fist, the goon looked less like a man and more like a worn punching bag.
Steve had never met this guy before, but he knew that Steve was part of the Brooklyn Boys gang. That bit of information wasn’t common knowledge. Steve’s breathing slowed and his focus narrowed. This guy clearly wasn’t another Joe and Steve needed to be ready for whatever Joe threw at him. With a low, threatening voice, he tried to get to the bottom of it all. “What do you know and what aren’t you telling me?”
But he didn’t say any of that. Obie didn’t need to know about that part of him. Just like he didn’t need to know about the ever expanding list of ‘things Obie doesn’t need to know.’ He settled on, “What do you want Obie?” as he tugged at a few loose wires.
“Bruce said we can’t touch or else the world will explode,” the kid said, peeking out from behind Steve’s back. “If you try to take Cap away from me, I’ll… I’ll…”
Tony spared a glance down at the half empty bottle and took a final swig. “Sorry to disappoint you, Steve. I’m not strong like you. Never was. Never will be. Maybe tomorrow I can pretend to be strong, but not today. I can’t do that today.”
Sam slouched over. “It’s either that, the black market, or death by slow extermination. Your choice Steve, but I don’t see many other ways out of this.”
As they slowly walked back to their hideout, Sam kept sneaking Steve a look. “You should tell him,” he said, voice low and comforting against the white noise of the neighborhood.
"Whatever their reason, that's none of our concern," said Steve, trying to bring back the group's focus. He could easily see how information about the "new kids in town" could cause panic in the group if the mulled over long enough. Of all things Steve needed in his life, an out of controlled distraction was the last thing he needed. Things were finally coming to a head and he didn't need an extra player stepping into the mix when it wasn't necessary or relevant.
The kid’s mouth twisted into a deep frown as he inspected the adult man in front of him. “You’re old,” he said.
The answer was on his lips before Steve finished. But as easy as it was to say, it took a few tries before Tony finally got it out. “Yes,” Tony said through a smile so big and a heart beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst. “Yes, I will marry you.”
Tony almost lost it. “You let them touch my stuff!” he yelled into the phone. “You know I hate it when R&D touches my stuff. They always add things that are a pointless waste of space and take away things vital for effective operation.”
“Please, Jan,” Tony begged. “I don’t want to get kicked out of the Red Cross for being gay. I can’t go back to making weapons with my uncle. I just can’t.”
“Obviously. Who wouldn’t be hungry after not eating for five days,” Tony said, answering for the wolf. “But now that I know you like fast food sausages, what do you suggest I do? I can’t keep
“For taking care of that guy downstairs,” Tony said casually. “I couldn’t do it as well as you. I’m better at getting into their heads. Use their own thoughts against them as opposed to brute force. I usually let Bruce rough ‘em up, but desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Quick thanks to my beta kuailong. They're in the process of moving, so we may or may not have a betaed chapter 8.  Chapter 9 is still in the works and Chapter 10 does't even exist yet. So if I have to miss a deadline or two, you kinda know why.
“I know Obie, we’re a weapons company, but how many times do I have to tell you we aren’t at war? There’s no rush.”
A deep laughter erupted from the radio. “These mortal men are no match for the mighty Thor! They are unskilled in combat and fall like puny flies. I could take them down with my eyes closed.”
Tony let out an annoyed huff. He stuck his tongue out at Steve and sank down into the beach chair. He crossed his arms and did everything he could to look as ugly as possible. Try drawing him now, Steve. Bet it’s going to be a lot harder, huh? A moving model is a pain in the butt. That’s what he got for being right.
“What the hell are you thinking boss?” Pepper demanded, joining him behind the assortment of crates acting as cover.
Bruce looked over at the older Tony. He played with his glasses as he tried to come up with a solid answer. “Weeks if we’re lucky. More likely months if not a year. We don’t want to cause a paradox.”
See, only a few people knew that Iron Man was piloted by the infamous Tony Stark. And of that number, even fewer knew of Tony’s unique “physical” needs. No, he wasn’t talking about his proclivity for sex. Yes, he could be talking about the RT device permanently wrapped around his torso, but that wasn’t what Tony was thinking about as he stripped down to his birthday suit in negative temperatures. No, he was thinking about something else.
“What?” asked Tony, very aware now of the eyes on him and the heat racing up to his cheeks. “I was just making casual conversation.”
“I’m kidding,” Tony said with a lighthearted chuckle. “I put it on a hanger this morning. Should be in your closet.”
Steve let out a frustrated groan. “Marriage is more complicated than that. And you have to be at least eighteen in the state of New York before you can get married.” Not to mention the age difference. This Tony was cute, but he wasn’t Steve’s Tony.
“Just the opposite,” said Steve, expecting the reply before it left the doctor’s lips. “We want your silence. The Iron Family has run into a few disagreements with some of the local gangs-”
“I swear, I’m fine,” Tony insisted. He tried to step around the wolf, but Steve just hugged his side.
And yet he had to. If he didn’t take it, he would die. It he took it, someone else might die in his place. It wasn’t that he needed it more than them, whoever ‘they’ were, but he needed to do what was necessary to protect his people. It was days like today that he hated that the world was such a cold and unfair place.
“Not this guy,” Jan insisted. “Natasha, Carol, and I all had our turns working by the window. He barely looked at us. But now, he’s clearly checking you out.”
Was if it was true? Was Tony keeping Steve around just because he was useful? What about the flirting? Tony flirted with Steve like it was second nature. Had that been a lie too? Some weird sort of ruse to keep Steve a compliant and willing puppet? It didn’t feel like a lie. The way Tony’s lips curled when he smiled, the way his eyes sparkled when he looked at Steve, the brightness in Tony’s voice when he laughed, that wasn’t a lie. Was it?
Natasha did that little half smile thing that she did whenever she was being clever. “And what if it is?” she asked, an amused lit in her voice. “We redheads have to stick together.”
“Good point,” said Tony with a smile. Steve ducked down into a cabinet to pull out the bottle the gang had opened up last night. They always tasted a bottle of the product before they shipped it out. Didn't mean they always finished off what they opened.
“Funny, ain’t your name on the check,” called back a familiar voice. Within seconds, Rhodey appeared from the secret back of the shop, a white cloth drenched in red wrapped around his leg. His hands were bloody, but it was too much to be his own.
The late winter sun peeked over the horizon and into Steve’s room. It washed over his nose, then his eyes before Steve had enough. He let out a heavy sigh as he stretched out his sex sore muscles. The welcomed ache in his hips and back were much better than they were the night before. Shame he would be back to peak health in a few hours. Steve rolled over to the center of the bed so when he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was Tony. He smiled, drinking in every detail of Tony’s sleeping face as the world welcomed them to a new day.
Steve pulled his arm out of Sam’s grasp. “Maybe not,” he muttered, “but I bet it’ll help me feel better.”
“I didn’t put our picture there. Peter Parker did,” he said, pointing the credited name at the bottom of the picture. “I’ll give him credit, he makes it look much nicer than I expected.”
“No! Neither. It just is,” Steve sputtered.  Tony obviously care for the place, but for Steve- “I’m guessing it’ll look nicer when it’s all complete, but for now it looks like a confused mess. Like some of that modern art stuff you would find at a rich person’s house.”
A violent shiver ran down the were’s body. Steve let out a sad howl and a layer of fur rolled off his body like the worst shed of the season.
Tony snapped out of his trance. Oh right. They had left the shop and had pulled into a back ally to change personas again. He’s breath, free of the helmet, was heavy and haggard against the roof of the limo. Most of his clothes had been discarded haphazardly through the open car door, leaving him with a dark set of dress pants and a red dress shirt with the top buttons open to the spring breeze. He tried to shake the cold panic from his system.
“It’s a very simple concept Rhodey,” Tony turned around once more to face his best friend. “I see him tonight, say goodbye, and move on with our lives. We focus on the mission, kill the sons of bitches that did this to me, and ride off into the sunset like the badasses we are.  Look Rhodey, I’m trying to do what’s good for the family. For once, I’m trying to be the responsible one. Can’t you support me in that? I’ll even throw in a smoking hot babe for you to fly into the sunset with. You okay with blonds?”
Her breath hesitated before she spoke again. “But not in the way you want me to," she said, pulling away from his grasp.
They stood at looked at each other for a moment. Neither of them knowing who should start and with what. Steve gulped. He really wished Ms. Potts had stayed to moderate. Or that there was a colored entrance so Sam could break the silence. Bucky was a pal, but Sam knew how to handle delicate situations like this.
Stane’s face darkened. His voice came out low and threatening. “Tony, I didn’t come here to waste time on pointless pursuits.”
“Yeah,” Tony tried to play it off as casual conversation. Steve didn’t need to know that the friend he was speaking of was Iron Man of the Iron Family. See Pepper, aliases are useful. “One of my friends is opening a new business in a couple of weeks, and they asked me to look into some local providers to help them celebrate. You wouldn’t happen to know any, would you?” he heavily hinted.
The door to the lab slammed open and a very angry Pepper Pots stormed into the room. She shoved a bolded headline into Tony’s face.
Tony smiled. He liked that about Steve. Steve was just so easy to talk to. Didn’t matter that Tony was essentially flirting with a person of the same sex, Steve took it all in stride. He didn’t yell at Tony for being a ‘goddamn fairy’ even though he didn’t mean it. Well, maybe he did mean it a little. But it was refreshing all the same. There were very few people that lit up Tony’s world, and Steve was slowly working his way into becoming one of them.
“I thought we agreed to keep it low profile. This picture. This mark! It all screams you!” she shook the morning rag at him.
“I’m… actually interested in something else,” he said, the nervous energy around him suddenly coming off in waves.
There wasn’t a moment to spare. Forget the port authorities. Forget the Avengers. Forget SHIELD. Captain America was alive and Tony needed to get him out. Now.
“And? Thoughts?” Tony acted as if he could care less, but the nervous fidget of his hands gave him away.
“Three crates. Less we get someone interested in our ‘less than legal’ juice, we’re going to be in the red.”
“Yup” Tony said, swinging his legs back and forth in the air. “Honestly, I’m surprised he can cook. Uncle Obie says, only women need to know how to cook.
“There is no other way Steve. You saw what that weapon could do. Either I take ‘em down now, or we duck into the nearest safe house until all this blows over.” Tony said, shoving the wires back into the glove with a frustrated grunt. The gauntlet was too damaged to fix. Tony couldn’t make lemonade out of lemons after all. He didn’t have the tools to fix it on such short notice, so he would have to make do with just one. Odds in his favor were getting smaller, but at least he had a blunt object to hit people with.
Tony offered Steve a reassuring smile. “No big deal. I'll see you around Steve.” Tony patted Steve on the shoulder as he left. "Go play doctor. I can see myself out."
“Yeah,” Tony rasped. His heart beat like a drum in his chest as a dormant heat warmed his entire body. “Really good.”
Steve’s pulse raced with adrenaline. Breaking lights and gathering an army right outside a warehouse of discarded technology; that definitely didn’t seem like the type of thing a person on the straight and narrow would do. Crooks shattered lights to hide what they were doing and to make a statement. Whoever was on the other sided of the door, shattering the fragile filaments, Steve had no desire to meet them face to face.
Rhodey awkwardly shuffled the armor around so Tony could see the sincerity in his friend’s dark brown eyes. “You’re not just our boss, you’re my best friend Tones. So forgive me if I had no desire to make it any worse.”
Ms. Potts stared her down with the help of her black heels. “And I will tell you the same thing that I have told you before; I can do this job just fine without Obadiah Stane breathing down my neck every five minutes.”
Something low, needy, and sinful pulsed below his gut. His mouth watered in anticipation, and Tony decided for one stupid moment that he would take the plunge and do something not responsible. With a low suggestive voice, he took a step closer to Steve. “And, just for the record, when I want something, I usually get what I want.”
Tony conceded with a grunt as Clint swung a supporting arm around his shoulders. Tony hated getting up on that ice cold table that Bruce always said was ‘room temperature’, but he needed to get fixed sooner than later.
Steve grabbed a rag and started scrubbing the blood off his hands. It took some effort but within a few minutes, large chunks of blood and puss ran off his knuckles and down the drain. When the white material was completely stained red, Steve tossed it into the basket. He snatched a clean one off the shelf, got it wet, and began dabbing at his shirt. Some of the blood came out, but it mostly just made his shirt wet and stick to his skin.
The warning resonated in his head like an annoying echo that wouldn’t shut up. Was anything Phil said true? Had to be. If it wasn’t, why would he seek Steve out in the first place? But that would be insane if what Phil said was true. Tony was an engineer fresh from another state. It would be impossible to stir up trouble within the few weeks Tony had lived in New York. Wouldn’t it? Of course it would! Tony was an amazing guy, so why would Phil of all people care to say anything? This wasn’t his fight and his people weren’t on the line. It would be Steve and Tony who would be the center of any fallout, so why should Phil care?
Tony had only seconds to realize his mistake when a small disk embedded itself into the left arm of the armor. A familiar tick, tick, boom and wave of exploding heat sent Iron Man stumbling back into the dust-covered boxes.
He pulled a bottle of whiskey out of his bag and popped the top. He reached back into his bag to grab a tin cup, but when his eye caught the name on the gravestone, a wave of sadness washed over him.
“Hey kid, think fast!” yelled Clint as he threw the doll like a football right into the kid’s hands.
“Oh for the love of god, shut up!” yelled Steve. Others objectors in the crowd quickly began to raise their voice. A rock flew through the air, pelting Schmidt in the head, and that was the end of that. Schmidt tried in vain to protect himself from the rain of rocks, trash, and insults thrown relentlessly at him from the crowd. He tried to continue on, but the animosity from the crowd was too strong.
“You sure these things are going to be safe? Doesn’t look safe.” Rhodey asked, examining a print. Only half of the engine-like piece was present on the paper. There were holes and pieces missing in the design, enough that if constructed by itself, it would explode when activated.
A sharp crack from the catwalk above their heads broke Steve from his panicked haze. He looked up toward the noise just in time to see a flash of something silver fly past his cheek and bury itself into one of the dust covered wooden box behind him.
Tony grinned in victory, giving Steve a strange satisfaction in his chest. When he opened the folded paper, his mouth dropped. “This is amazing!” Tony’s face glowed with wonder.
“Water then,” Tony said, pulling out a second glass. “Need to stay hydrated after a show like that.”
“But right now we’re surrounded by ears eager for gossip. A lot of bad things could happen if the wrong person finds out that I like men. So, can we please not talk about this until after we’re on the road?”
“Because,” Tony said in a calm voice. “I remember waking up in my toy room sad that everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours was just a dream.”
“One lucky shot!” yelled Tony. “It took one lucky shot to knock him down and that’s exactly all it will take for you to wind up dead. I refuse to take that risk.”
Natasha smiled, but the light didn’t reach her eyes. “Christmas is a difficult time for me. Just here to give my late husband the Christmas dinner he deserves, now that his killer is finally dead.”
Tony frowned. Red, white, and blond was looking for him? Really? Why would he be looking for Tony? He didn’t like Tony. Or at least, Tony didn’t think he liked him. When Tony offered him a donut to say thanks, the blond barely said anything. He just took the donut, muttered a quick ‘thanks,’ and walked to the other side of the truck without another word.
The sound of slow confident steps from the dark of the alley brought him back to his painful reality. He tensed and tried to right himself. Had the person seen it? Was he ousted as gay for good? Tony blindly reached for something to defend himself. His hands clenched a small, well weathered, rock and he held it up toward the oncoming person.
He reached down once more, confident that Steve wasn’t going to pull him down again. (Though in different circumstances, the idea of Steve pulling him down and stripping off his armor in a darkened warehouse was quite tempting.) Instead, he said with an amused smirk, “Come here you asshole.”
Head still facing down, Tony looked up at Stane through desperate eyes. It had always been like this, as long as he had know Obie. Through the years of his childhood, through thick and thin, Obie had been the one good constant in his life. Helping him up to his potential. Being there when Howard never was. Advising him on what was best in life, but only if his ideas weren't stupid. Tony relied on him just as much as he relied on Pepper, but even Obi could come up with some very stupid ideas sometimes. “And what do you suggest I do?” he asked.
Tony raised a questioning eyebrow. He didn’t think the interrogation would get that rough. “Hulk get to him?” he asked.
Bucky covered his head, holding Steve’s face to the ground as long as he could. Steve tried not to move, but survival instincts were screaming for him to get out of there as fast as he could.
“Don’t worry. You’re not the only one who could be doing more for this relationship,” Steve said with a reassuring smile. “I could try harder, too. Sometimes I think we’re too alike. We’re workaholics. We’re both prone to tunnel vision and with everything that’s been going on in politics, new heroes and villains popping out of the woodwork left and right; not to mention the calls for extra security and non-life-threatening emergencies, it’s hard to maintain a relationship.”
“More like a German pain in my ass,” Steve swore under his breath. “These guys are Hydra; the same guys who gift wrapped me that grenade.”
“Steve, you were holding my hand when I woke up. You held onto it until Coulson brought us to this safe house. The only reason you let go was because I noticed it. Whatever happened, whatever you’re trying to say, I can take it. I want to know.”
“Brought you a pig,” said Tony, tossing the charcoaled carcass onto Steve’s grave. “It’s all that’s left of those bastards that did this to you.
Three groups of two split off and stalked into maze of the warehouse. They weren’t heavily armed, but they were packing much more heat than any
of a car speeding off faded into the distance. Grey and brown dust floated around, suspended in the tense atmosphere.
He landed on the floor, the chair only a few inches away from his back, and immediately curled his body into a fetal position. His fingers wrapped around the chair leg for dear life, but it was no use. Tony yanked the chair away from the man’s grasp and sent it flying into the wall.
The blond man cleared his throat, looking just as uncomfortable as Tony. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to... Thank you but...I’m not interested in ‘that’ kind of company.”
Steve felt the heat of the explosion before he heard the click of dangerous chemicals mixing. He threw his arms up for protection at the last second, but it did little good in terms of protection. Heat from the explosion singed the palms of his hands. The sheer force of the blast threw him off his feet and into a tower of containers, knocking the wind out of his lungs.
A man Tony didn’t recognize appeared opposite Carol. He had a bowler cap on his head and smug grin on his face. Both reached up and took hold of the metal awning over the service window.
“Hey, Fluffy,” Tony said as he gently shook the fence. “You got visitors. A human and a werewolf. Thought a visit from your pack might jog your memory.”
“What the hell were you thinking boss?” yelled Rescue over the high pitched cries of her repulses. “Get your ass over here!”
The heat from the graze still stung his cheek. He ran a finger over the inflamed flesh. No blood, that was a good thing, wasn’t it? With one hand, he covered his cheek, whirling around to see what sort of thing could have hit him in an almost pitch black room.
Eventually, time ran out. The full moon was sinking into the west and the barest hints of daylight began to kiss the eastern sky. The Avengers would be waking up soon and Iron Man would be expected to join them for the morning meeting.
Steve groaned, holding his head in his hands. What a stupid idea. Metal absorbing an impacting force was one thing. Metal against bone and pure stubborn stupidity was another.
“Shut up Tony.” Steve used his Captain voice. He whirled around to face Tony. “We are going across the river to my apartment, and we are having a drink. If you want to leave after that, you can. But there’s no way I’m leaving you to celebrate alone, and I don’t have the cash to go to a speakeasy.” Desperation clung to his voice. This was something special, something that should be celebrated. Tony needed this. He needed this.
Steve let out a heavy sigh as he watched the two Tonys bicker. How was this his life? After everything he’d been through, how was it possible as heartwarming and ridiculous as this?
“Feds ain't gonna show,” Sam yelled back. “That car belongs to Hydra. And they've got the commissioner in their pocket.”
Tony smiled. "Tony Stark," he said with a devilish smile. “I’d shake your hand, but I don’t like being handed things.”
He could hear that distinct single eyebrow raise she did whenever he was being stupid or cryptic. “About what?”
“I’ve seen worse,” he said, as they walked out to a familiar black limo. “You’re engaged?” he asked, holding the door open for Pepper.
“Oh, right. I remember that. I thought my comm was broken because there was no way in hell you would ever ask me out.”
Steve tried to stay skeptical. As long as congress sat around did nothing, nothing would happen and his people could get paid. Once legislation passed to allow alcohol once again, well, Steve didn’t want to think about that. There was no money in any account for an official business license. The Brooklyn Boys would be out of a job and out of income. The people who needed the extra income from the booze would have to find other ways to make ends meet. What were they to do then? Steve could always try his hand as a literature artist once again. People were always saying the soap advertisements were crap.  Or he could try to join up with the army again. But what about everyone else?
