missed her, he realises, and it’s as if a small part of the universe clicks back into place at that realisation. The world hasn’t turned completely upside down.
“I understand why you’re listening to him. A drowning man will clutch at a straw, isn’t that the expression? But we both know you shouldn’t do this. What is it you’re trying to achieve? Do you want to be better, smarter? You are clever, Sherlock. We are clever. But the kind of clever you aim for, the incandescent… it’s just a dream. Nobody could be that clever.”
body. It’s just
Mycroft continues unperturbed.
I'm so sorry it's been such a long time since the last chapter, but I had to take some time off from writing to focus on moving to the UK for my Master's degree. And then I was really unhappy with the way the chapter turned out and decided to rewrite more than half of it. So here we are, two months later, with chapter 25.
But then his gaze finds John. His pupils seem to narrow as they zoom in and focus, and Sherlock locks eyes with him with considerably more determination than he’s been able to muster on the previous occasions. For the first time since he’s woken up, he looks as though he’s actually able to identify what he’s looking at.
Back when they first met, Jim had told him that they were made for each other. Sherlock has been a blind fool not to see it before now.
limits.”
The white world floating above him slowly comes into focus. And with it, a familiar face.
Sherlock scoffs, but his gaze remains on the floor. “Oh, don’t be so dramatic. I’ve decided nothing of the sort.”
Realising that it might be a while before Sherlock is ready to do any talking again, John gestures for Mary to accompany him back to the living room and leave Sherlock to think/rest in peace.
It takes a moment. Then Mary’s arms are around him, steadying and comforting, and she runs a hand over his hair, letting him hide his face against her neck like a child. “Let me help you,” she says, her mouth so close to his ear that he registers her voice mostly as a breath caressing his earlobe. Her voice sounds like a safety net and her words offer a lifeline for him to cling to. “Let me help you," she repeats. "We’ll fix this. I think we’re strong enough. I love you too, I want this to work and I believe it can. I believe you called me today because you wanted to give us a chance and I appreciate that. If you want to stay a couple of days longer, I suppose you can, but I don’t think it’s a good idea. Sherlock doesn’t truly need your help anymore and we both know it. I think you should come home. Then we can talk it through and put it behind us. It’s what you need. It’s what
“I’m alright, John.”
“I think you should leave,” Sherlock repeats harshly and gestures towards the door as John has so often seen him do with uninteresting clients. As though that’s all Mary is.
The air between them ignites once again, an electrical current passing from one to the other and back.
John is completely taken aback. He has, of course, told Mary about his previous relationships. He told her about them all the way back before it got serious between them, almost as a sort of disclaimer. A warning. But he hasn’t told her why his relationships the past years all had been relatively short-lived. Not once has he as much as hinted to her that he might not be quite as straight as he always portrays himself. Has she known all along? Has she really been able to add all the missing pieces to the puzzle she’s just presented him with?
Neither of them speaks for the better part of an hour. Sherlock can be silent for a plethora of reasons – chief among them is deep concentration, closely followed by stubborn sullenness – but it doesn’t feel like any of the usual tonight. It’s not easy, it’s not companionable, it’s stressful and uncomfortable and almost oppressive in its intensity. But John doesn’t dare to break it.
Well. At least the living room looks the same as alway,s with no visible scatters of syringes or lighters on any surfaces.
things. When I’m there… it feels real. I have a perfect replica of the flat with everything in its place…” Sherlock lets his arms flare out, indicating the living room around them. “It’s all there, everything. And it feels real. I can run my hand over the sofa…”, his hand traces the outline of the armrest by his side, “… and it feels the same as in real life.”
Sherlock raises the violin and plays through his composition one more time.
Sherlock is out cold again as quickly as he woke up. It frightens John to witness just how rapidly the switch is flipped. But his doctors, who've kept a respectful silence during Sherlock's bout of consciousness, are quick to explain that it's only to be expected. His brain will require a few days to recuperate after his prolonged unconsciousness, there's nothing unusual about this. There’s still a danger of more severe, permanent damages to his brain (a possibility that John cannot even begin to entertain at the moment, so he doesn’t), but it’s too early to tell. For now, what matters is that he woke up and will wake up again. That is all John needs to know and all he wants to hear.
“I didn’t know it wasn’t real. It wasn’t because I couldn’t tell something was wrong. But my brain didn’t put two and two together. It was as if I was dreaming. You know weird things are happening, but your brain doesn’t allow you to understand that it’s a dream. It was the same. I was here, in Baker Street, but… I couldn’t get out. The door was… not locked exactly, I would have been able to pick the lock if that was the case. It just couldn’t be opened. No matter what I did, I couldn’t open the door, I couldn’t open the windows, I could shout for people, Mrs. Hudson or people down on the street, but… but no one could hear me. No one came. No one down on the street reacted in the slightest way. It was just a backdrop, a moving picture, they weren’t
. Yes, perhaps there is still a part of John that would like to be married. He has a daughter, he’s raising her with a partner, he should marry said partner, it’s what people
But Moriarty does nothing wrong. He isn’t bothering him, isn’t mocking him or belittling him. He doesn’t even appear to be condescending towards him. He just sits in John’s chair, easily reclined against the backrest, legs crossed casually in front of him and a small smile that might be a smirk seemingly permanently plastered on his face. Sherlock would describe it as
Perhaps it’s simply because, for as untraditional as John prefers his life to be and for as anti-traditional a partner as the one he’s chosen to commit himself to, when it comes to the concept of
Sherlock is still looking at him, probably waiting for a continuation. John needs to say something. The silence between them is honestly getting uncomfortable. Not unlike when John asked Sherlock to be his best man. Talking about emotions really isn’t their strongest side, not for either of them.
“No, but seriously. When you were dead, I went to your grave.”
John lifts him up, supporting him to the best of his ability as Sherlock half-walks and half-drags along behind him to one of the chairs. John deposits him there while he sets about making the couch ready for him, stripping off the pillows and stuffing a sheet down around the edges before fetching Sherlock’s duvet and pillow from his bedroom. It’s not the most pristine sleeping arrangement John’s ever made, but it’s passable. Sometimes three years in Afghanistan does come in handy.
“You don’t want to go. I heard you. You don’t want to go home, John, so I don’t think you should. If you really wish to, that’s your choice, but it
Flashes of bright, white lights assault his inner eye. He’s already picturing transparent tubes, hearing the steady beeping of a heartrate monitor, smelling the stale hospital air. He doesn’t stop to think about what might have happened. He doesn’t consider that Sherlock might have had a relapse in his absence. He doesn’t feel guilty that he wasn’t there. Because he’s too fucking frightened to think. It happens too quickly and it’s over before his thoughts have time to settle.
“Yes. Yes, of course.”
“No, it’s not!” John finally shouts, slamming his hand on the table beside him because that’s the only way he can think of to just make her listen for two seconds. “It’s not as simple as that, it just isn’t!” He stands up, turning his back, but has to concede to meet her gaze when he hears Mary begin to speak again. “It’s not that simple, alright? Look, I love you! I married you because I wanted to and you know what’s changed in the way I feel about you since then? Nothing, that’s what! But something has changed in the way I feel about him. He almost died, Mary! He could have, easily. I thought I had lost him for a second time! You know what it did to me the first time. Did you really think I could live through that again without it changing anything? I need time, Mary, time to think things through! I can’t just say yes or no! I know that’s what you want and I know it’s only fair of you to ask, but I can’t give you an answer! Not now!” John pauses for a moment. He has to force himself to continue. “I can’t give you an answer now. You can accept that or you can’t… and believe me, I would understand if you couldn’t. But it’s not what I want!”
The frown between John’s brows deepens. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Sherlock looks up from his task, raising an eyebrow in place of a verbal inquiry.
Passcode accepted.
“I think you did the right thing. For both of us.”
And Sherlock isn’t looking his best either. He should have slept, but he stayed awake to listen in on their conversation, interrupting when he heard it go off the rails. He needs to go back to bed. Despite what Mary (and, indeed, Sherlock) might think, he’s far from back to his former self. Right now, it’s as though someone has pulled the drain on what was keeping all the energy he’s just displayed in his confrontation with Mary inside of him. It’s practically spilling out.
John and Sherlock have always had and still have many, firmly established traditions: John making two cups of tea in the morning (a ritual so deeply ingrained in his subconscious that it had taken him months to get rid of it after he’d moved out of 221B following the Fall – a constant reminder and one of the most frequent causes behind his flashbacks in the early days of his life post-Sherlock - but now he gets to do it again and he’s finding that it works better than any therapy he’s ever gone to), Sherlock making deductions about the characters (and often about the actors and actresses) in John’s favourite series on the telly, John hiding the remote control whenever said favourite series is on in order to prevent Sherlock from changing the channel (which Sherlock will inevitably do if John forgets about the remote, the bloody bastard), John always bringing his gun on even the most mundane-sounding cases because he knows that Sherlock will have forgotten all about personal safety the moment he gets the bit between his teeth and Sherlock ultimately allowing John to take care of any injuries he might have sustained while on a case despite vehemently objecting to the procedure all the way through.
Reluctantly, Sherlock unwraps himself and gets up from the sofa, crossing over to the door. The carpet is soft and accommodating beneath his bare soles, almost tickling him a little. He pushes the handle down… and nothing happens. The door doesn’t budge. It doesn’t even rattle when he shakes it. It’s not locked, he can tell it isn’t when he inspects the locking mechanism. It just doesn’t open. It doesn’t move. Not an inch.
“Doesn’t seem all that worried to me.”
And Mary is not like that. Mary is here beside him, holding his hand, letting him sit in silence, understanding him with little fanfare and even less need for recognition.
“Vite, vite!”
Weirdly, Sherlock finds himself blushing. He doesn’t do that very often and certainly not like this, sitting fully dressed in the living room with Rosie in his lap and Mrs. Hudson on the couch. John notices, of course he does, and his smile deepens impossibly further before he has to return to the punch.
The bit John is reading about Alice McKenzie is found on page 134 of "Jack the Ripper", a part of All About History's bookazine series written by Paul Begg, John Bennett and Richard Jones and published 2015. All credit for that segment belongs to All About History.
Sherlock is eager and pliant beneath him, his long limbs wrapped around John’s frame with an almost desperate earnestness. His lips are close to John’s ear. John feels rather than hears his heated gasps, feels rather than hears the deep rumbles in his chest when John accidentally brushes against something that causes him to let out a long, drawn-out moan. It goes straight to John’s own groin. Sherlock feels thin and concerningly bone-y, but John’s doctor side is pushed increasingly further to the back as his instincts take over and his mind is filled completely up by
He can’t stop thinking about John. He can’t keep his mind from reproducing the look in John’s eyes as he finally looked up long enough to understand that Sherlock was there. The shock had been just as grand as Sherlock had anticipated. But he’d hoped to find the shock replaced with warm recognition and perhaps a slight crinkling at the corners of the eyes, which Sherlock recognises as a sign of joy or content in John. To see it replaced with hurt and disbelief instead had been infinitely more painful than anything else John had dealt him in the course of the evening.
And so John tries to clear his mind of all thoughts of intense looks, intimate touches and forbidden fantasies as he lets himself into 221 with the key he still possesses at Mrs. Hudson’s insistence and his own reluctance to give it up. He ascends the seventeen steps.
Within ten minutes, he finds he’s leaned his head against John’s shoulder. Being close to John somehow makes everything a little less unbearable. His presence is soothing somehow, much better than Sherlock’s recently acquired self-stimulatory habits.
The angle is far from perfect. Sherlock is reclined in his chair, Jim is bending over him from behind. They’re upside down in relation to one another and Sherlock can’t see much more of Jim than his neck and the top of his tie. It’s still the most intimate moment that Sherlock has experienced to date. And it’s quickly becoming a strong contender for the best.
With a bit of effort, the padlock is removed and the door swings open on creaking hinges. Behind it, a poorly illuminated staircase leading downwards. Cement walls. Bare lightbulbs momentarily blinding him as he looks at them. When they don’t flicker. He really should get some of this fixed. Install new appliances and maybe give the whole thing a fresh coat of paint. He just can’t find the energy to get it done. It’s so cold down here.
Perhaps he’s being paranoid.
“Oh.” He quickly searches for a simple way to explain what a hexagon is, but comes up emptyhanded in the face of the fact that the most complicated geometry in Rosie’s current vocabulary is the triangles and squares of her block box, which she either way continues to refer to as “tree” and “flat”, respectively.
“Thought we’d lost you for a moment,” Mycroft continues, seemingly unperturbed. “May I just check: is this what you mean by
So they try. Slowly but surely, step by step and, after fiddling with angles and positions for a moment, inch by inch.
But that someone else… John had been secured to a chair and Sherlock had stood before him as his judge, but the executioner had been behind him. In the shadows, obscured, holding a gun to the back of his head. Sherlock hadn’t thought much of that person at the time, wholly consumed as he had been by the horror of what he believed to be his reality. He’d barely been able to see more of the figure than that hand on the gun and he hadn’t cared about the identity of the figure at all at the time.
Sherlock smiles, but doesn’t say anything in response. It’s rare for him to proclaim his love like that and John doesn’t expect him to. What Sherlock has just said… the words “I love you” were clearer between the lines than they ever could be if simply said out loud.
A heartbeat of silence. Then…
It sounds heroic when it’s other people. When it’s you, it’s just a defeat.
Another seconds-long pause.
“What a shame. John and Mary will be extremely…”
Rosie looks solemn for a moment, her small lips puckered in a grimace of concentration. Then she beams brightly at Sherlock and stretches her arms up towards the skies.
He places an open-mouthed kiss against Sherlock’s earlobe, then lower, mapping his neck and shoulder with lips and tongue. Sherlock just exhales shakily, a slight shiver running through his frame as he slowly loosens his crushing grip on John’s hair and shoulders. He lets himself relax back onto the bed, releasing John’s hips and letting him pull away for long enough to leave his body. John all but falls down on the bed beside him and Sherlock immediately turns towards him, nudging his head against John’s shoulder impatiently until John spreads his arms for him and he snuggles into John’s warmth.
“We did.” Sherlock chuckles softly. “And round and round we went in there. We were halfway out on the street before Rosie remembered that she’d like to see the swans, so we had to go back. Which is how it ended up being dark before we got home.”
They look at each other then, sharing a meaningful moment of silence. Then John laughs.
He lets it go.
Again, thank you so much to missdaviswrites for the challenge and the prompts, thank you so much for reading and Merry Christmas to all!
It’s not that Mary is doing anything wrong. Mary is nothing but sweet, quiet, calming, understanding… everything that John could possibly ask for. As always, Mary understands what he needs without having to ask. She takes care of all interactions with the staff and then simply sits beside him, hand is his reassuringly, without pressing for any form of response. Mary does nothing wrong.
“Either I’ve caught you in a compromising position or you’ve been working out again. I favour the latter.”
“Mary…” John tries to interject, but she waves him off with a hand.
“Are you alright? Look at me.”
John isn’t quite sure what he should say either.
Sherlock looks at him and it’s the most pained, pleading expression John has ever seen on the face of another person before in his life. Sherlock is in pain. Agonizing over his loneliness because it amounts to feelings and weakness in Sherlock’s mind. Agonizing over his desire for human contact, the most natural thing in the world in John’s mind, but an unforgivable transgression in Sherlock’s. Perhaps John understands, perhaps he doesn’t. And Sherlock is pleading. Pleading with John to… to do what exactly? To comfort him? To be with him? To satisfy his desire for human contact or to take it away from him altogether?
It’s a mistake.
Doused in ice water sounds like about the right description. Still… it’s warmer than his tea, which he swiftly discovers upon lifting the cup to take a sip.
“Anything else?”
So he still doesn’t actively consider it an option. But it’s there, subconsciously, no matter how hard he tries to suppress it. It’s been growing in the past few days and it seems to advance by a league every time Sherlock kisses him. Every time he leans his head against his shoulder. Every time he looks at John in that way, as though John’s the only fucking thing that matters. John is fairly certain that Sherlock has never looked at anyone else in that way. Not even Irene Adler. The pleasurable tingling John experiences when he thinks of it is somewhat perverse yet utterly irrepressible.
Then, suddenly, a sound. A slight creak. Unmistakably a floorboard. Right here, in his room, with him, right now. The relief seems to explode in Sherlock’s chest. If someone has come up here then the door isn’t locked and he isn’t up here all alone and the world hasn’t shut him out and he’s just been imagining things and
John feels the need to swallow again. What Sherlock is suggesting… it shouldn’t be possible. Replicating the laws of physics when running a simulation as a mental experiment within his own head, his arse. It sounds absolutely preposterous.
That John has chosen differently from him doesn’t come as a surprise either. Sherlock has been different, always, for as long as he can remember, but he’s always worked
So John doesn’t say anything.
with it. No one has ever been as important. Girlfriends were people John visited in between his life with Sherlock, whenever Sherlock was busy or in a bad mood. Sherlock’s work has always taken centre stage. John can’t count the number of times he’s had to sleep-walk through a day at the clinic after being out and about with Sherlock well into the early hours of the morning. Even now, even with Mary, even though John has fought his emotions with much more vigour than he has ever spent on acknowledging them… even now, he’s still the most happy and sad and angry and jealous and
Thank you all so, so much for all your support and for sticking with this story as it enters its second year of publication!
With Mary, it’s easy. John knew where he had her and understood what she was thinking from day one. There were no uncomfortable what-ifs. It all went as smoothly as a well-oiled machine and perhaps that’s what John should be aiming for. Stability and security. That’s what anyone would choose.
Worst of all, though, is the knowledge that this has all been for nothing. Allowing his emotions to crowd out his reason, filling up his brain with the most boring, useless information, breaking every rule he ever established to keep himself sane, to stop this
The thing is, though, that small acts of defiance, putting on a show of indifference, acting childishly and lashing out is all part of their dynamic. It’s part of what they’ve always done, partly to rile one another up and partly to amuse one another. It’s an aspect of their dynamic that has always been distinctly different from the one Sherlock shares with John.
He doesn’t mention Mary. Perhaps he’s made up his mind that he isn’t going to tell John about his suspicions, not now that he has John’s assurances. Perhaps every thought of Mary is simply swept away by a wave of emotion so strong it’s nearly choking him.
Sherlock purses his lips, caught between relief that John isn’t apparently angry and insecurity at failing to provoke any clear reaction. He isn’t quite certain how to interpret that.
What John wouldn’t give to have Sherlock sit up right now. Sit up, smirk at him in that infuriating manner that is his custom whenever he’s done something terribly clever yet utterly scandalous and proclaim it all a big joke. John wouldn’t even get mad, not really. Whatever anger there’d be would drown in his relief.
He has to force his voice out when he replies. “I wasn’t busy with anything more important than this.”
He continues.
“No…”
Still… there’s no denying that the thought is tempting. Sitting here in John’s lap with John's strong arms around him, feeling perfectly at ease for the first time in… well, for the first time. And yet he still fears that it might all be ripped away from him again any minute. Good things have rarely lasted for him in the past and this is the best thing that’s ever happened to him. If he messes this up…
Sherlock virtually jumps. Scans the room for any sign of an intruder. There’s nothing.
The last thing he hears is Jim shouting his name as the door closes behind him.
But God, that noise! Sherlock can’t even pinpoint where exactly it’s coming from, only that it sounds like nails dragging over chalkboard amplified by a factor ten. The likely point of origin is behind one of these doors, but Sherlock isn’t quite sure which and that makes him hesitant to explore further. He doesn’t know what’s behind these doors, he doesn’t know what he might find. That’s the whole point of the basement: storing things away that Sherlock either can’t seem to get rid of no matter how hard he’s tried or knows he might need for a later date, but has no desire to engage with on a daily basis. It could be anything from any period of his life. A truly discouraging thought.
John is still there when Sherlock’s eyes reopen, leaning in over him and smiling reassuringly. His mouth is moving, he seems to be speaking, but Sherlock can’t make out the words. It’s not that he can’t hear him speak, not per se, but the sounds all seem to morph together into one steady hum. The words themselves are completely lost on him.
It's still only ten in the morning.
John chuckles. “Can’t be that bad. You were going to tell me of your own accord before. If it was something horrible, you wouldn’t have tried to say it.”
“What the bloody hell was that all about, Sherlock? What the
if it wasn’t so cheeky as to not look out of place on the face of the Cheshire Cat.
glad to see him fail to miss. It’s not even that exciting, pretty straightforward case of false identity solved by Sherlock in a record three hours and forty-two minutes although he claims that he had the answer all figured out way before that on the cab ride back to Baker Street. Still, it very much is just what the doctor ordered, although the doctor’s recommendations in this case has nothing to do with the fresh air and everything to do with the company. Being just the two of them again, being out and about solving cases again, even the more mundane ones… it feels better than John would like to admit.
John should have been able to predict that things wouldn’t be as good in the morning. It starts even before John has gotten out of bed with one missed call and a text from Mary, stating “I just called to hear how you’re both doing. Have a nice day.” The chilliness of the cold water as the bucket is emptied over John's head is strangely almost enough to make him cry. He has to let the phone slide onto the nightstand and return to the safety and darkness of his duvet, drawing a few steady breaths before emerging into the world of the living anew.
how it feels.
“Hm?”
think anymore. In behind all of that shit, I
So as John settles down to watch the nine o'clock news with a cup of tea and half a scone from yesterday and Sherlock slides onto the couch beside him, leaning back against the armrest and propping his feet up on John's lap in a gesture that's slightly too intimacy to be entirely friendly, John realises that it's been three whole days since the kiss and he's no closer to knowing whether to push Sherlock's feet away or pull him closer.
There’s a snort from the kitchen.
If what Sherlock is now at last confiding in him is true, Sherlock is not only motivated by a need for mental stimulation and a constant search for novelty and excitement. He’s been searching for a way to eliminate his own feelings. It sounds preposterous to John’s ears, but then again, many things that shouldn’t actually be possible are possible where Sherlock is concerned. Sherlock doesn’t abide by the general laws of the universe. He makes his own rules. That aspect of him has always stood for a great deal of the attraction John feels towards him. But if it has hurt him, too… if it has caused him to believe that he might be better off not feeling anything at all, that he might be a better version of himself if he wasn’t quite as human… John can barely wrap his head around it, so wrong does it sound to his ears.
“No, of course you’re not. Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock.”
Sherlock falls silent again and John can’t bring himself to inquire further. He’s a doctor, he’s been doctoring in war zones. The scars spreading out over Sherlock’s back like an entangled cobweb are lash marks. Perhaps that’s all John needs to know. Although his subconscious is certainly more than eager to supply his inner eye with imagined glimpses he doesn’t wish to see.
Her voice is still mild, non-confrontational. Her eyes are suddenly anything but. They seem to light up, digging into John with resolve.
to John and John is under the distinct impression that Sherlock not only has full knowledge of this, but commonly uses it to his advantage). Anything edible is off the table given Sherlock’s notorious disregard for sustenance to his transport. John would have liked to give him an experience or holiday as a present – he saw an advert for an inn a couple of hours outside London that he’s been dying to take Sherlock to for a while now only this morning and almost booked a weekend for the two of them right away – but that sort of long-term planning rarely works out for them with both of them often called out on cases on very short notice and then there’s also Rosie to consider.
Mycroft seems to be characteristically indifferent to John’s presence, which seems almost absurd in the face of such an uncharacteristic action. Perhaps he’s experiencing the same as John: focusing every inch of his attention on Sherlock to the point where everything else fades into insignificance. John wants to ask, but he doesn’t. He wants to offer some form of comfort as one normally would to a man holding the limp hand of his unconscious little brother, but John doesn’t do that either. There is no normal where the Holmes boys are unconcerned, this John knows, and Mycroft might not take too kindly to being called out on what is obviously a very rare moment of sentiment on his part.
So of course, inevitably, Sherlock just can’t help himself. He has to see if their dynamic is intact and Moriarty’s expression is as he’s imagining it. He has to check. So he turns around after only a couple of minutes and just manages to catch that the familiar smirk widens impossibly further.
“I’m not sure. It’s just… you know how everyone has that one thing they always argue about? That pops up again and again in various disguises and you’re just never able to put the bloody thing to rest? Well… I suppose you might not know, but then just think of us, yeah? How we always argue about the same things. Your exasperating violin crescendos at 3 AM, the eyeballs in the microwave, your general disregard for even the most basic safety precautions…” John chuckles again, almost fondly, and Sherlock finds himself responding in kind.
) closest friends. John even phones Mycroft, though the call doesn’t go through. Then he slumps down in his by now rather worn and increasingly uncomfortable hospital chair, settling back to his vigil by Sherlock’s bedside with more peace of mind than he’s felt since Sunday (
With much trouble and plenty of curse words, John makes it into the hallway and painstakingly begins to ascend the stairs. It says a lot about his level of experience with Sherlock that he doesn’t even attempt to shout for help, but just takes care of what needs to be done as well as he’s able to on his own. Using his elbow to push down on the handle and his right foot to nudge the door open, John enters the living room, groceries balanced precariously in his arms.
“You don’t tell him what to do, Sherlock!”
. Just no. And yet in that simple, short word lies a world of meaning.
Why they always have to do this… open up only to hurt each other and then immediately close off again… John really can’t tell and it’s been going on now for longer than he wants to admit. That age-old frustration builds up again and it’s more than John can take right now, with everything else in his life feeling just as confused and uncertain and
He fights for two seconds. That’s the time it takes for whatever they’ve injected him with to take effect and for his muscles to start relaxing, growing sluggish and useless. Within ten seconds, he’s lying on the pavement, breath heaving out of him and blood rushing in his ears.
Behind him, Jim’s voice. Loud. Panicked, almost.
It’s too much. This whole day, all this pain and grief and loss and heartbreak... it all collapses on top of him in that moment. One more stab of pain and then those creaking doors are blown wide open.
So, too, is the desire to get rid of a love that can’t come to fruition.
Mary watches him with a neutral expression. “Do you think you understand him?”
“What do you mean?”
“Sherlock… these people that you… that you recreate… is it just for cases? I mean… is it just victims and potential criminals and… I don’t know, mafia goons?”
"What's the final problem?"
had only existed in his own head at the time, why should it be a problem that Jim had done the same? Sherlock had
Sherlock’s words fail him, and he falls silent, anticipating John’s response with trepidation. He should never have said it like that, should never have emphasised his desperation so much, it’s not fair, what is John supposed to say to that other than to agree, and then Sherlock will be no better than Mary, what has he done, he never should have…
“Hm?”
Sherlock lets his breath out through his nose, a sound midway between a scoff and a sigh. He seems to debate with himself whether to speak at all.
do. And it shouldn’t have to be.
In the end, John decides on putting the kettle on and making himself a cup of tea, which he justifies through a similar process of comparison, arguing to himself that there’d be nothing weird in making himself a cuppa at Lestrade’s either.
“I think you should leave, Mary.”
“But your back, Sherlock… your back and I… fuck, I’m sorry, I’m so…”
“You say his brain is showing clear signs of neural activity. You say it’s as if he’s asleep. That’s it, is it? He’s asleep.” He nods in the stiff, awkward manner he only uses when he’s two seconds away from exploding in seventeen directions. His lips are pressed tightly together.
“Why couldn’t I just be…” Sherlock continues, his usually impeccable vocabulary all but gone in his pain. “What I wouldn’t give to not have this mind, to not think like this, to just be normal! Or to not have these emotions, to not feel like this, to be just my brain and nothing else! Why must I be this way? Why must I be trapped in between, always and always and always? I don’t want to be this way, John! I never asked for this, I never wanted this, I don’t want to be this way! I don’t… I don’t..."
It’s torture. And if he stays one more second, hears one more word out of Jim's mouth...
“Sherlock?”
And he’s just about to wreck it beyond repair.
“No, you don’t understand!” Sherlock’s voice rises. “It is real! It’s… just because it’s a simulation I do in my head instead of on a computer doesn’t mean it works any differently. I run experiments in my head as I run experiments in my lab. I go into it with a blank mind, I set everything up precisely as it was in real life and I run my experiment completely objectively. I factor in every possible determinant, I replicate the laws of physics, I take care to simulate the behaviours of others based on every piece of information available to me! My simulations are better, faster and more accurate than anything you can do on a computer!”
is that doting parent.
Sherlock has never been a particularly astute user of body language, at least not outside of cases – his ability to gauge hidden motivations and secret feelings seems to decrease in near-perfect tandem with the level of criminal intent involved – but now he’s counting on body language alone to communicate to John all that he feels.
And yet.
His eyes stay on the cup as he plays through his freshly composed piece once again and tries to decide whether or not the second stanza is too fast to be used in a traditional waltz. Mrs. Hudson’s vacuuming of 221A below, clearly audible through the floorboards, isn’t helping his concentration, but then neither is the incessant creaking that seems to have replaced John as his live-in companion lately. Indeed, it seems to only ever give him a break when John is around and then returns to reclaim his attention as soon as he’s left to his own devices. It’s more than a little disturbing. But the only solution seems to be a return to the basement of his mind palace and Sherlock is somewhat less than motivated to do that considering how well it went the last time around. Besides, there’s no time now. The wedding is in four days. Sherlock can’t afford to get side-tracked, auditory hallucinations be damned. Surely it won’t hurt to postpone the operation just a few more days until everything is nice and settled and John and Mary are off on their obligatory post-wedding sex holiday. Then Sherlock will have more than enough time on his hands to fix any problems that might arise.
have been in and out of 221B continuously, inquiring about Sherlock’s health, fussing about the state of the flat (which is admittedly a little less than pristine at the moment – John has had other things on his mind) and offering to help with anything and everything that might need doing. But most of them mainly seem to tire Sherlock out. Even their (well,
loneliness.
Meanwhile, in Sherlock's Mind Palace, Sherlock finally reflects on why he's attempting to find a way to suppress his emotions in favour of his brain. In the last chapter, Mind Palace!Mycroft (i.e. Sherlock's logic) tried to dissuade him from attempting this, but failed to understand why he wanted it. Mycroft/Sherlock's logic, only able to process things from a logical perspective, thought that Sherlock wants to suppress his emotions because he wants to enhance his brain power and accused him of recklessly risking everything. Sherlock knows the risks involved and isn't doing it just to be cleverer. He's doing it because he can't stand to feel lonely anymore. When he was with John, John gave him a sense of completeness that he'd never experienced before. Now that John is gone, the loneliness is infinitely worse for Sherlock and he can't live with it anymore. That's why he's doing this.
The combined guilt of neglect, adultery and confusion is slow to settle, but damning when it does. He truly is a rotten person. Everything he’s done, every step he’s taken, they all seemed perfectly reasonable in the moment, and every decision he’s made seemed justified when he made it, each decision built on the ones that came before it. But when all of it is taken together, there really is no excuse. He’s acted atrociously, mostly to Mary, but to Sherlock as well. What he’s put Mary through, what he’s still putting her through, is frankly unforgivable. Leading Sherlock on, encouraging him to step increasingly out of his comfort zone, when John is married and unwilling to change that, all for the sake of John’s own gratification… it’s repulsive at best and sickening at worst.
Sherlock’s expression softens, if only slightly. He looks at John with the same deeply intense concentration as he uses on a specimen pinned underneath the microscope, as if he’s trying to read a deeper truth than the one John has just shared of his own accord from his face and posture.
When they’re in their chairs, Sherlock refusing to sit like a normal human being and instead lying down sideways, his legs over the armrest. And they talk of old cases. The big ones with press outside trying to catch a glimpse of them and the newspapers full of speculations the following day. The small ones where only the client knew and paid them with Victoria Sponge. The difficult ones that saw Sherlock at his most brilliant, working tirelessly for days on end and shaking like a leaf at the conclusion from a combination of sleep deprivation, malnutrition and caffeine overload. The simple ones that saw Sherlock at his most infuriating, snapping at police, victim and John alike for being slow and generally throwing as many insults at the world as possible until the formalities could finally be wrapped up and John would reluctantly contend himself with having to listen to Sherlock’s rants until a new case came along. And John wishes for the last three years and everything they’ve brought with them to all be undone just so they could return to the times of those cases.
“What do you mean?”
John finds himself matching her bright, eager smile. He’s still bloody tired, but it’s tough to remember that when Rosie’s practically bouncing with glee on his lap.
It takes him almost a second to find the right tone for the mood.
They end up each in their own chair talking of nothing in particular for the remainder of the afternoon. Just like old times.  John tries to bring up their previous conversation several times, looking for just some sort of confirmation from Sherlock. An admission that he acknowledges the severity of the problem and isn’t going to just let it continue. But Sherlock is clearly not interested in having this conversation. Whenever John strays too close, he immediately changes the subject, and when John tries to approach the issue more directly, he simply shrugs him off and tells him to stop fussing. Which causes John to get frustrated and Sherlock to get cheeky and then they’re back to square one.
And it’s true that attempting it is likely very dangerous. Not only is the actual process completely obscure. How could he know how to alter the way his brain works? How does one go about repressing one’s own emotions, subduing them beneath a stone cold logic? Sherlock is feeling his way through this. The irony of which is not lost on him. But the real concern is the final result. If he should succeed, what he will end up with is completely unpredictable. Does Mycroft really believe he does not understand what Moriarty is – a genius mind turned into an unstoppable, uncontrollable force because of a lack of respect for human moral and empathy, answerable to no one but himself? Does Mycroft really believe he does not realise he could end up just like that – or worse? Does Mycroft really believe he does not have the brain to fear what he would be if he was nothing
So how to proceed? Going down here has evidently done little to appease the problem. If anything, going by the now amplified creaking, it might actually have worsened. Proceeding further seems a leap of faith that Sherlock isn’t quite sure he dares to take. Still, submitting to his own gut feeling is not a step that Sherlock takes easily no matter the circumstances. That’s not how this is supposed to work. This is supposed to be logical. He is supposed to be logical. But he’s… God, he’s scared, isn’t he? Isn’t that what he’s experiencing? Fear?
It’s driving John up the wall. If only Sherlock would confide in him instead of confining him to this perpetual state of nervous anticipation. He may be watching over Sherlock, taking care of his physical needs, but Sherlock obviously isn’t back to his usual self and he’s apparently not willing to let John help him with that. There’s something going on, right underneath his nose, and he knows nothing about it because Sherlock refuses to tell him.
John sighs. “I can’t say, Mary. As I said, you never know with him.”
“I don’t want you to be alone. I know what you say about me and Mary is true, but… but I don’t want you to be alone.” John hesitates a moment. He has to swallow before he continues. “When I chose Mary… it wasn’t just because I like her. I mean, I do, I love her… but it wasn’t just that. I chose her because I was lonely too. So lonely without you…” John doesn’t know what he’s going to say before he says it. The words are not coming from his brain, but from somewhere much deeper inside of him. “I thought I’d lost you. And I thought… I thought I had lost you before I had a chance to… to talk properly with you like this. It was… it was bitter and lonely. Mary was there, as the only one. So I chose her. Perhaps… if things had been different… I would have chosen differently.”
But tired though he may be, John can’t deny that it’s actually also quite nice when he hears the front door downstairs a couple of minutes later followed by some awkward shuffling as Sherlock collapses the stroller and stores it away in the entrance hall. Then there’s Sherlock’s unmistakable stepping pattern on the stairs and the next moment…
good enough.
I’d come home. But to leave like that, under those assumptions, and not having seen you at all, not having actual first-hand proof that you were, you know,
But the time isn’t for that either. As surely as the past three years can’t be undone, what has just happened can’t be undone either. This is not the time to pretend like nothing has happened and go on as usual. They’ve turned their backs on this enough times already. And if there’s one thing the past three years has taught John, it’s that chances like this don’t last forever. They’re gone before you know it. And once lost, they can’t be recovered.
With one glaring difference. It’s quiet.
It’s a heartbeat before he feels capable of speech and what comes out is barely coherent.
Once again, thank you so much to missdaviswrites on Tumblr for the challenge and the prompts and thank you all so, so much for reading!
He doesn’t stop to think about his sexuality. He doesn’t stop to think about Mary. He doesn’t stop to think about Sherlock not feeling things like that, because now he knows he was wrong and he will not be able to question that ever again.
, his brain seems to say.
“John…” he says, but then hesitates. He needs to say this. And he needs to say it right. With horrible clarity, he sees that there might never be a second chance if he messes this up now.
Still, the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant than it has been for months. In a sense it’s the calm after the storm of this morning. They sit together, talking of anything and everything, just the two of them, just like they used to. It feels comfortable and safe and warm and John can feel the anger drain out of him by the minute, relaxing him more than anything has in God knows how long. Which brings up a lot of issues that he would rather not contemplate. Like why it doesn’t feel this way when he's with Mary. John tries to tell himself that it’s just a matter of settling down and getting intimate. He has, after all, known Sherlock several years longer than he’s known Mary. But really, it’s just something he tells himself because that’s what you’re supposed to tell yourself in that sort of situation and he knows it. He’s married to her, he lives with her, he’s been with her in every sense of the word. It’s difficult to get more intimate than that. And yet it’s still with Sherlock and Sherlock alone that he feels this deep sense of comfort, as thought everything that's troubling him is going to be alright and he hasn't just been on the edge of a full out angry explosion for the past several hours because his best friend has relapsed on drugs.
With Sherlock safely settled in the couch, reclining with his head against the armrest, John steps back to survey his work. He shakes out his shoulders a little restlessly, feeling strangely motivated to go and do something. He can’t just stand here, can’t just sit down and turn on the telly. But Sherlock has closed his eyes, apparently drifting off to sleep again, and John doesn’t quite know how he feels about the prospect of rummaging around a flat that is no longer his own, tidying and organising and pretending that he still has the right to feel indignant about Sherlock’s poor use of space and general disregard for potential health hazards. Would he feel justified in taking a look around Molly’s flat and moving things around while she was asleep?
On the other hand, perhaps God
And again, just as a quick and shameless self-advertisement, if you would like to talk with me or see some of my other Sherlock-related musings, please feel free to have a look at my tumblr, which is also called the-signs-of-two.
And still Sherlock’s mere presence had made him feel
“Your exhausting safety precautions and tireless devotion to societally sanctioned yet logically irrelevant behavioural patterns?”
“Look, I know I have no right to expect… and I don’t want you to share something you don’t want to share. Really.” John tries to emphasise with his eyes, although Sherlock is notoriously challenged when it comes to nonverbal communication. Outside of cases anyway. John soldiers on. “But I have to say, I’m getting a bit worried here. I’m not the world’s only consulting detective. I can’t tell what’s going on inside someone’s head at a glance. I’m sorry.” He smiles a little, meaning it to be sheepish. It probably turns out much too sad for that. “I don’t think you owe it to me to share whatever it is. But I can tell you’re… hell, I don’t know. Worried. Sad.” He shrugs helplessly. “I don’t know. But if it has any relevance to your unconsciousness and recovery, I need you to tell me. As your doctor.”
bloody right.”
John vaguely recognises his own words from the evening in question and internally shrinks just a little bit further. He really said that, didn’t he? And at the time, he’d meant it.
Now it’s John’s turn to bite his lip. “Serbia?”
They make it in record time and John shuts the door behind them.
“That’s the thing about Sherlock.”
Sherlock. So who the hell fucking knows? Sherlock does at least three things a day that sound preposterous and shouldn’t really be possible. Why the fuck not this?
Sherlock nods slightly, his jaw moving over John’s hair.
Her chest rises as she inhales.
In his heart of hearts, perhaps Sherlock still feels there are things he ought to tell John about. Most of the things he needed to say have been said, about Moriarty, about John, about those two years following the Fall and about those days in the hospital.
Sherlock has had a taste of what real happiness is like, which makes the
“Look, I understand that what I’m saying isn’t fair. Alright? It’s not. But it’s the best I can do right now, Mary, so I’m asking you to accept it. And I understand if you can’t, I do. Don’t think I don’t feel like shit to ask this of you. I love you! I just…”
But there’s no time. Mary is waiting for a reply and John is afraid what she might glean from his long silences.
be. And honestly, I don’t think those three things are the same. They feel… I don’t know… incompatible somehow.”
He keeps looking at his fingers. Watching the way they bend. Back and forth.
“I can’t.”
It had lasted no longer than a couple of seconds, three to four in John’s estimation, but it had felt considerably longer. Then Sherlock had turned around and headed outside, the moment broken.
So yes. It had been a bit of a relief when she went home yesterday. Which only makes John feel even worse.
Maybe he should be counting down the hours until Christmas Day, properly committing himself to this whole festive ordeal, but that has struck him as a tedious and pointless exercise in futility ever since childhood and there are limits to his enthusiasm for the yearly round of Christmas phone calls, friendly well-wishes and uninspired presents.
… John had never once taken the time to really think about what exactly Sherlock meant to him. All he knew was that no one mattered as much. None of his friends, none of his family, none of his girlfriends had even come close. Next to Sherlock, the rest of the world had simply left him feeling… uninterested. For a while, John had tried to maintain some sort of social independence, flirting and going on dates as often as he deemed it necessary for a single man of his age to do. He’d stopped when he realised that he actually didn’t care enough to put any real effort into making those relationships work. Though he’s reluctant to admit it, it had been as difficult for him to tell his girlfriends apart as it had been for Sherlock. That still makes John chuckle, though those memories are now mixed in with a good dose of pain.
“Try harder then. It’ll reassure him, I promise.”
Now it’s John’s eyes that blaze.
A long, uncomfortable silence.
The best thing to do would probably be to come clean, but John just doesn’t dare. It would cleanse the air, yes, and move everything out of this horrendous state of uncertainty and unspoken feelings. But to tell Mary would be unbelievably cruel. What would he say anyway? That he loves her for who she is and is eternally grateful for what they have, but he only really got together with her in the first place because he badly needed someone after Sherlock’s supposed death? That now Sherlock is back and it’s possible for John to compare them, it’s getting increasingly obvious that Sherlock must and always will be the single most important person in John’s life?
In fact... why not rid himself of the pain? Pull it out at the root? Now that John is gone, once and for all, what’s the point of all these feelings? They’re only slowing him down. Preventing him from becoming everything he could be, from releasing his potential. Making him slow, stupid, pathetic. A weak shell of his former self, trapped behind all his pain, all his despair and frustration and jealousy. All his love. Love that he never wanted to feel, but now he does and it’s worse than he ever could have imagined. Going back to the way things were with John is an impossibility. Going back to the way things were before John is an option. And surely a better one than feeling this miserable all the time. He could do it. So easily, he could do it. His mind palace is already leaking, in tatters, infested with the seep-out from those hidden basement rooms. Why not seek it out and be done with it, once and for all? Just one little prick and he'll be able to find his way down to the deepest levels of his mind palace. Confront the voices that haunt him and rid himself of the emotions that plague him. Just one little prick and it can all be over, right here and right now.
It’s actually quite nice to have the flat to himself for once.
He looks just as Sherlock remembers him. Expensive suit. Slicked back hair. Eyes positively glittering with Sherlock knows not what. Mirth? Sarcasm? Insanity? Geniality? Sherlock’s brain is working on overdrive and the processing time is long. It takes him painful eight seconds to locate his voice again.
, repeated over and over again like a steadily accelerating mantra. This is a cruel resemblance of a nightmare, being unable to move away as the flames creep ever closer. Unfortunately, the roar in his ears, the sharp tang in his nostrils and the steadily increasing discomfort from the heat ensures that John can’t possibly dismiss this as just another bad dream. Certainly not one that he can wake up from.
He isn’t trying to hurt himself. It isn’t some misguided attempt to make himself suffer for his failures or pay for his weakness. It’s just soothing. But of course, such experimentation is strictly limited to whenever John isn’t here. Sherlock is certain that this is one of those things John wouldn’t understand.
His voice sounds small and cowering even to his own ears.
and it’s almost more than John can handle, knowing exactly what bad thing Sherlock’s eyes are referring to, what bad thing he always does and the consequences it has had for him this time. For all of them.
John doesn’t reply. He doesn’t want to do as Mary says, he wants to stay with Sherlock and look out for him. He isn’t even sure that Mary is correct in assuming that Sherlock doesn’t need help anymore. But how can he say no when Mary phrases it in such a way? When everything is said and done, it’s probably true that he needs to get some time away from Sherlock if he wants to give his and Mary’s marriage a chance. Being around Sherlock… while it feels as though it’s doing wonders for his soul, it isn’t doing anything positive for his conscience. Nor is it setting him on the path to happy matrimony, quite the opposite. A part of him knows that Mary is right: if he stays with Sherlock now, will he really be able to go back to Mary later? And even if he should, would it be reasonable to expect that Mary would still be there when he finally decided to go back home?
in his eyes intensifies.
Sherlock and Jim arrive at Battersea Power Station. Jim has, without Sherlock knowing it, arranged for John to be brought there. John represents Sherlock's emotions, so Jim tells him he must rid himself of John to rid himself of his emotions. It's the final step of his transformation, but Sherlock can't do. Even though he knows that leaving Jim means going back to his lonely flat, in the end he would rather sacrifice himself than John. He decides to turn his back on Jim and leave.
Sherlock has been left with his emotions. In theory, they should be positive as well as negative. But without John, there’s no one to unleash those positive emotions. That leaves him with 38 years’ worth of problems and emotional baggage to pick through and, seeing as no one is coming to see him, an endless amount of time in which to do so. As an added bonus, his intellect is in ruins and his mind unable to function the way it used to, overcrowded by emotional responses as it is.
Here he lies, this sad little nonentity that he’s turned into between Moriarty’s visits, curled up on the sofa in his pyjamas, week-old dishes in need of cleaning stacked in piles a mile high all over the flat, tea growing cold in his cup, thinking of John and just
Sherlock shifts slightly. Jim is obviously talking of the Fall, which has always made Sherlock feel deeply uncomfortable. It brings old wounds to the surface. Old wounds and the memories of everything that followed, culminating in a second Fall onto a recently scarred back and the sight of a person Sherlock had walked through fire and water to save getting into a cab with someone else. It opens up all the guilt and regret of his most excessive failure to date.
John can find neither head nor tail in Sherlock’s explanations. “Know what?”
Sherlock can’t remember the last time he felt this cold. Sherlock can’t remember
miss how hateful he's finding the whole ordeal and what a nightmare it all is for him to endure. But truth be told, John finds he doesn’t much care.
Sherlock shifts uncomfortably. Avoids John’s gaze.
The blinding light is partly obscured by a familiar dark shadow. Sherlock tries to focus his gaze, make the shadows coalesce into a face. But his eyes feel a bit wrong also, a bit foreign. He’s scrambling about within his own head, little pieces of himself scattered all over the floor.
“Right,” he says. What more is there to say?
”Sherlock? Did you eat the last…?”
She giggles in what John takes to be relief as well and he inevitably finds himself joining in with her laughter, placing his arms around her and pulling her into a firm embrace. Her arms come up to wrap around his neck, her fingers protruding into his hair and caressing the back of his head. She exhales loudly, turning the sound into a placating hum as she cups his scalp.
”You don’t know why he doesn’t wake up.”
When exactly did he decide that tonight would be the right time to have a
No. John forces him to face reality with a promise to make it better.
“I know I did and you’re doing a great job. Better than I expected, really. I’m just saying, you don’t have to wait around. If you want to go on a case, just go on a case. I’m sure we’ll manage,” John tries to explain, immediately regretting that last bit as he sees Sherlock entering full pout mode. John has witnessed that numerous times before, when he makes a joke on Sherlock’s behalf at an inopportune moment or a stranger comments on Sherlock’s lack of social skills. It looks downright adorable, a grown man pouting like a five year old, and John used to be more amused than anything else. It’s taken him a long time to realise that Sherlock is actually hurt in these situations and only pouts to hide behind a pissed-off expression. If only Sherlock didn’t have such a godawful problem admitting that he does actually have feelings like a normal human being, maybe John needn’t have been friends with him for years before grasping what ought to be a quite central part of any friendship.
That voice telling him to watch out sounds disturbingly like John’s. But it’s getting weaker. Sherlock finds it increasingly easy to ignore it whenever it rears its ugly head in between longer and longer intervals of silence. It doesn’t bring him anything, only a deeply irrational, emotional longing for John that Sherlock does his best to suppress along with the advice itself. He doesn’t need John. If John had wanted to continue being a part of Sherlock’s life, he should have shown it a long time ago. As far as Sherlock is concerned, John relinquished any form of say over Sherlock and the way he wants to lead his life the moment he decided that he was more interested in his happy, domestic home life with Mary than in being Sherlock’s friend when he needed him the most. Sherlock is done listening to him. Done forcing himself to bend over backwards and tie himself up in knots just to gain John’s approval. Done fighting to become something he’s not, something he was never meant to be, just for a smile and a few words of praise.
This isn’t going to escalate. John is here while Sherlock is recovering. It’s only reasonable, he has every right to do this. It’s a completely understandable and fair course of action and Mary is just going to have to live with that. She doesn’t truly have anything to complain about.
John swallows uncomfortably.
But John doesn’t say anything. He just follows Sherlock’s example, looking back at the screen.
The only word that John is able to think of to describe the situation is
it’s more important that John is helping a friend in need than that they sleep together at night right now when they have so many other nights ahead of them. The incessant gnawing of guilt in John's stomach reaches its apex as Mary ends the call by asking him to say hi to Sherlock from her. Not knowing what he’s supposed to reply, he just asks her to take care and ends the call.
“I don’t know what to do,” he admits, and though it costs him a considerable amount of effort to say it, it’s an immediate relief to let it out.
“Sherlock?” John must have noticed his brief second of hesitation. When their eyes meet, John’s are full of mild enquiry.
But that voice drowns in the ear-shattering cacophony of voices screaming at him that this is
He hazards a glance up at Sherlock’s face. Sherlock is looking straight back at him, but there’s no reading his expression.
Jim chuckles breathily. “And pretty grim ones too.”
“I’ve been warning you for ages, sweetheart, I really have. The Brother’s Grimm, the breadcrumbs, the witch’s house, Hansel and Gretel, the burnt gingerbread man, Sir-Boast-a-Lot, all of it. I tried to tell you. To let you know the name of the game. But would you listen? Now, finally, a bit of response from you.”
, as you so poetically put it.”
“I thought I’d invite Mary over today.”
John is a doctor, and an army doctor at that. He’s used to dealing with medical situations in high pressure environments. The second he reaches Sherlock’s side and lifts him from the floor, John instinctively checks for restrictions to his airways (of which there appear to be none), makes sure that he is breathing (which he is, thank God, though it’s shallow and hectic) and takes his pulse (absolutely hammering). He does it so quickly and so methodically that he barely has time to register it, relying as he is on an immediate, subconscious activation of his medical training. But once he has checked Sherlock’s vital statistics and had Mrs. Hudson call the emergency services, there’s heartbreakingly little that John can do. His expertise lies in the battlefield. He’s used to administer combat casualty care for Christ’s sake, not treat what appears to be a life-threatening drug overdose on a living room floor!
“It’s alright, Sherlock.”
. Not really. Not objectively.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. Perhaps John’s stalling is as obvious to him as it is to John.
John fights with his tears. He doesn’t feel as though he deserves to cry. Mary is the one who should be crying, but she’s calm and cool as ice.
His shoulders sag a little, some of the tension draining away. Exasperated is something he can do. Being a doctor is something he can do.
Now’s the time to ignore the nonsensical, messed up problems he has made for himself in favour of the actual problems that are actually happening around him. And that involves giving Sherlock a smile and a nod and squeezing his hand without thinking too hard about anything other than what John might do to make Sherlock feel comfortable and reassured. Everything else must wait.
He loves Sherlock.
“How do you do it? How do you not fear it?”
Christ. If John isn’t just about the most ungrateful bastard that anyone could possible have the misfortune to meet. A lovely fiancé, soon to be wife, and a best friend who is willing to pause what seems to be his entire life just to make sure that the wedding will be a success. Really, not a lot of people have that. And yet John can barely even pretend to concentrate on that for all the confused thoughts and feelings churning around inside of him.
been John?
“How long had it been? When we met, how long had it been since Serbia?”
Finally, after ten minutes of complete silence, there’s a stir from the other chair. A simple movement. No grand gesture, no declaration of love or care or concern. A simple movement, yet it seems all the more poignant for it.
What he
Thank you so, so much for reading and following, for leaving kudos and for writing comments! I treasure each and every one.
He needs to go home, to Mary. But he can’t just do that. Sherlock still needs him and as much as John might resent Sherlock for cocking everything up for him, at least he has enough clarity of mind to recognise that none of it is actually Sherlock’s fault. Sherlock didn’t mean for John to think of him in this way, to notice the things he notices and feel the things he feels. Sherlock is just being himself. He is the unwilling, and most likely unknowing, catalyst of John’s forbidden desires. That is no fault of his own, indeed, it is no one's fault but John's. For John to abandon him when Sherlock needs him the most, all because of an entirely self-made dilemma that he’s only facing because of his entirely self-made problems would not only be unfair. It would be being a bad friend.
The older Holmes raises an eyebrow, settling for their usual petty quips as an opening move. “Really, Sherlock? A few days on your own and this is where you’re at? While I fully agree that Baker Street does leave quite a bit to be desired, I’m not sure inviting one of England’s most prolific criminals inside helps to improve the ambience.” He leans against his umbrella, neatly folded together and gradually releasing its water content into the rug. Sherlock watches it happen, raising an eyebrow in turn, but he still doesn’t say a word. It appears to be Moriarty who’s doing the talking.
“When I was there this time… it was different. I know why, you don’t have to say it.” He takes a deep breath and looks up at the ceiling. “It was dangerous and foolish, but I needed it and I wanted… I wanted out! And I took a risk and it backfired and I’m…” Sherlock stops again for a moment, worrying his lower lip with his teeth. He seems to gather momentum before he’s able to look John in the eyes. “I’m so sorry, John. I know… I know what it did to you. I understand it better now than… than last time. And I’m just so… so sorry, John…”
, executed with inexperience perhaps, but with an enthusiasm perfectly matching John’s own. Sherlock raises both hands, sliding his fingers through the hair just behind John’s ears on either side of his head and pulling him closer.
He glances briefly towards the kitchen and, to his surprise, finds John looking back at him. He’s smiling. Smiling in that fond, relaxed manner of his that does something to Sherlock he can’t quite understand. It’s like suddenly being enveloped by a blanket, comforting and soothing. Warming him up on the inside.
When Sherlock wakes, he finds John on the couch, elbows on his thighs and hands gathered in front of him. He’s looking straight ahead, unseeing, eyes empty and focused on nothing but his own pain. It’s nauseating to witness.
None of those things that have kept him back for years give him pause now, but Sherlock’s startled gasp spurs him on. He has such sinfully soft lips. And when those lips begin to respond after a brief moment of hesitation, something inside of John seems to coalesce. Five years of unreleased longing, of forbidden fantasies and racing heartbeats, all seem to melt together in this moment. The last of his worries, fears and concerns go down the drain, allowing his brain to focus all of its energy on simply experiencing this and committing everything about it to memory. The softness of Sherlock’s lips, the warmth of his breath, the smell of his skin, the feel of his hair brushing against John’s forehead.
A perfect little pair of cufflinks, each elegantly shaped like a small bee with the wings held down along the body. They’re not coloured, which is good too. John has the feeling that Sherlock would never wear a bright yellow cufflink, bee-shaped or otherwise. They’re just done in this exquisitely detailed gold that will look quite fetching beside Sherlock’s delicate violinist fingers, perhaps as an accent to John’s favourite shirt of his (Sherlock refers to it as dark aubergine – John just calls it purple), oh, they’d look positively incredible with that. John is admittedly getting rather ahead of himself, but can’t a man be allowed to indulge in a little self-congratulatory wishful thinking?
It’s like being seventeen again, except Sherlock didn’t have any friends when he was actually seventeen. It’s like the carefree, happy seventeen one sees in movies but can never quite replicate in real life.
“John… would you rather have gone with her? Should I… should I not have said anything? I didn’t mean to… I just wanted to help,” he says, helplessly.
Sherlock nods, but then he hesitates a moment, trapping his lower lip between his teeth the way he sometimes does when he isn’t sure how to approach a potentially sensitive topic.
“I see. I respect that, John. But I’m not going to pretend that I’m ignorant of what’s really going on or of what’s actually at stake here. So I’m just going to be as honest as I possibly can with you in the hope that you’ll be equally honest with me in return.”
familiarity and an equally distinctive masculine novelty. It’s sensual and intense as John’s previous kisses have been, yet both sensuality and intensity are amplified by the unpredictability, the danger, the forbidden nature of this kiss… and by Sherlock himself, who is every bit as passionate as John has oftentimes accused him of being cold. John can tell he’s not that experienced, there’s a nervous, almost stumbling undercurrent to his movements and he doesn’t appear to be quite in balance. Yet what he lacks in skill, he more than makes up for in enthusiasm, and there’s a not insubstantial part of John who delights in knowing that he is the first and only person to have ever tasted this.
Sherlock’s eyes are slow to find his. John just keeps holding him until he manages.
“It’s not true.” Jim’s smile is understanding rather than condescending. “What matters to ordinary people is how far you’re willing to bend to conform to their normal, ordinary yet completely arbitrary and ultimately misguided standards. It’s the only thing that matters. Accepting the lie that the morals of society are better than the individual morals of you and me. Bending your will so you can stand to live by that lie. And for a man as exceptional as you… well, that’s a whole lot of bending that’s required to conform there. You didn’t want to do that. And so you were punished.”
And struggle he does. It’s painful, every word of it. Seeing John’s reactions, all of them easily readable from his face, when Sherlock tells him about Jim. About how he had suddenly just been there. About how Sherlock at first had mistrusted him and tried to make him go away. About how he’d slowly become accustomed to his presence, then begun to accept it, then eventually come to rely upon it. It had been the only company he’d had. He stresses that point over and over again. He hadn’t chosen for it to be Jim, it was just how it had turned out, and without Jim, he would have been utterly alone. He stresses that point too.
John stops himself.
“We’ve only known each other for three years…”
“This is what people do, Sherlock. They get married. I warned you. Don’t get involved.”
He’s almost tempted to throw a nasty comment about the time he spent sleeping right up and down on a hospital chair right back in Sherlock’s face, but thinks better of it at the last second and shuts his mouth, simply motioning for Sherlock to continue in his own time.
The next thing Sherlock knows, John has shifted, and Sherlock finds himself on his back on the sofa. John crouches above him, smiling. But it’s a dangerous smile, the one Sherlock usually associates with all-night stakeouts and encounters with notoriously dangerous criminals. It’s a predatory smile, meticulously calculated, and matched by an intensely fiery gaze.
Recently, though, Sherlock has noticed that a few of the doors now have a noticeboard beside them saying
“No.” Sherlock returns his eyes to Mary, matching her expression with complete mastery. It’s been years since John last saw Sherlock like this. “You're right. I don’t tell him what to do. I remind him what he told you that he wanted to do, because it seems as though you didn’t hear it the first time!”
John’s grip on Sherlock’s hand is now so ferocious as to be almost painful for both of them. But Sherlock isn’t likely to feel it. Nor is he likely to hear the insistent screech of his heart monitor.
He calls.
And just like that, sidestepping everything he just said, she's backed him into that same damn corner he just tried to escape from.
Sherlock shrugs slightly. “It’s a long story.”
“Alright. First thing in the morning. You stay off the sweeties until then, do you hear me?”
His voice is as smooth as silk. As always, Sherlock finds himself all but entranced. Somehow, even if he tries not to listen, Jim’s voice has always been able to find its way in. Now Sherlock isn’t even trying to deny it access. He’s listening.
And Sherlock isn’t done.
“But Sherlock, you can’t… What do you mean, rid of them? Rid of your emotions, how? That’s not…”
Moriarty makes it go away, if only temporarily. Figuratively speaking, he cleans the dishes. Tidies the flat and creates paths through the mess. But when he leaves, it’s less than ten minutes before everything is back to the way it was. It’s
It all should be so simple, so straightforward. But here Sherlock is once again, intruding on John’s life and turning it all on its head. Making the traitorous, irrational side of John’s brain flare up like a broken power cord. After everything Sherlock has done and everything Sherlock has failed to do, John hates himself for even considering any of this. For even thinking about Mary and Sherlock and what he feels and what he should do. It all should be so simple. But Sherlock complicates everything.
“You alright?”
It’s the lack of malice that's throwing Sherlock off. There is none of that usual coldness to Moriarty now, not to his eyes, not to his smile, not to his voice. Maybe there’s even a hint of warmth. The sort of warmth that comes from the Sun on a cloudy day: it’s not there, but it’s not
It’s not because they necessarily need to be “a proper family”. Hell, that battle was probably lost a long time ago and John doesn’t really mind. He’s lived with Sherlock on and off for more than half a decade by now and he’s learned the hard way that Sherlock and
Jim opens his mouth to speak. “Sherlock.”
Sherlock nods and John immediately lets it pass, smile returning to his face. “I got some beans too, and some eggs. I thought I’d make a bigger breakfast tomorrow if you’re interested. Well, as interested as it’s possible for you to be when it’s about food.”
That’s the moment John silently vows to never again withhold any praise of Sherlock for fear that it should come across as a bit too much.
“Come again?”
He sounds panicked. Is he in a panic? Why would he be in a panic? Is he worried about John? That must be it, John can’t think of any other imminent crisis. But he’s seen Sherlock pull poisoned children out of abandoned warehouses and remain calm. That Sherlock sounds panicked now testifies to the fact that he cares and John can feel just a slight bit of that all-encompassing hurt in his chest evaporate as those two puzzle pieces click.
But today, in this very flat, very much in the real world… Mary had helped John put Sherlock to bed and Sherlock had caught a glimpse of her hand as she was adjusting the duvet that had sent cold shivers down his spine. He hadn’t been able to sleep after that. He’d been lying awake, trying to deduce, trying to remember, trying to make things make sense.
Incredibly, the feeling seems to be mutual. Because John is smiling at him. And not the stiff, forced
“Anyway, Mary thought it might be a good idea for us to go on a case.”
Jim gives his hand another squeeze in response and urges him forward.
John is accustomed to anger.
This though… it doesn’t feel normal. There are times where Sherlock thinks he’s hearing someone else, where his mental voice sounds barely recognisable, puts on a foreign accent or a strange speaking pattern. He usually talks to himself in the second person, but there are times when he switches back and forth between the first and second person as though he’s actually having a conversation. There are times where the sounds become so real that he almost feels the need to physically cover his ears. As though that would make any difference.
“Clothes could easily be British.”
“You were gone,” he finally says, as though confessing a sin.
Jim purrs softly. There’s an almost animalistic side to him, apparent in both his playfulness and his flirtation. Sherlock finds it completely irresistible.
John pinches the bridge of his nose.
And Sherlock is growing desperate for more.
And after several days with Moriarty… there’s no telling how much damage has been done.
That John is not like other people, fundamentally and deep down where it counts, Sherlock has always known. He can’t imagine he would have been very interested in John if he hadn’t been able to sense that.
John tries. The following days, he makes a real effort to keep his thoughts strictly where they need to be.
But it’s more than that. Apart from those few moments of desire every now and then, Sherlock genuinely has no want to indulge.
And John is completely disarmed. He can’t stay mad at Sherlock, not when he puts on a smile like that. Not when he lets John see that slightly insecure, fiercely hidden side of himself that John finds impossibly endearing in a decidedly bit-not-good way. Not when he sweeps all John's concerns under the imaginary rug in one fell swoop and changes the mood in a way that John can't possibly hope to undo with the way he feels himself reacting to it. So John just sighs, shakes his head and accepts that that snide remark is the closest thing to an actual acceptance of his help that he’s likely to get.
Nothing she knows of, at any rate.
He just can’t leave it at that and that’s the pain of it.
John resists the urge to ask any sarcastic questions about why that may have been the case. He asks another question instead. “How was it different?”
“He’s good. Well… getting better, at least. But you know how he is. Isn’t always easy to tell. He prefers to be a mystery.” John feels himself smiling.
On second thought, though, perhaps he isn’t dying after all. Unless an annoying, mechanical beeping of what is undoubtedly a heart rate monitor is part of the hallucination, which in that case might better be classified as audio-visual.
His mind isn’t what it used to be. Maybe John is right. Maybe he has finally destroyed something important in his brain through his continued substance abuse. Or maybe it’s this infernal noise, tearing through layer after layer of his mind with a sound and sensation not unlike nails on chalkboard. Does it matter?
Well, it’s messed up and he’s messed up along with it.
“Of course you can, Sherlock.”
And John would rather be engaged in this constant inner struggle, feel all this guilt and regret and confusion, fabricate excuses for himself and try to convey his sincere albeit strained regrets to Mary than be a bad friend to Sherlock. It seems there is nothing for it but to grit his teeth, endure, attempt to keep his thoughts on track and hate himself a little bit more every time he fails.
But for now, at least, things seem to be mostly back to normal between them, if there ever even was such a thing as
a physical attraction. If it had just been physical, John probably could have put it all down to PTSD and an identity crisis in the wake of his time in Afghanistan. Just a couple of odd erections and inappropriate fantasies about a flatmate every once in a while, that’s quite normal. John is a doctor, he knows about these things. But he also knows that this is not the case here. Not when it’s all taken together. There are too many clues so to speak, all pointing in the same direction. If Sherlock could hear him now, he would say that the conclusion is inescapable. An admiration for Sherlock’s intellect and a fondness for Sherlock’s personality, that can be friendly. Platonic. But a physical desire for Sherlock? A look that lingers too intensely on his lips or a hand that stays too long on his shoulder? Jealousy in the face of competition, regardless of his own relationship status? A certain disinterest towards anyone else when Sherlock is in the room? That’s not just a physical thing, a strange anomaly in his sexuality.
“Yeah, I’m trying.”'
If there’s a slight hesitance in John’s kiss as he registers, decides and files the information away, Sherlock either doesn’t notice or doesn’t respond to it. His lips don’t pause for a moment, exploring John’s with all the fervent curiosity Sherlock always exhibits when encountering a new and unexpectedly delightful phenomenon. It’s almost akin to a deduction, the way Sherlock’s attention is focused squarely on John and on nothing else, and it provides John with a strangely intense satisfaction to think that he’s able to spark that kind of interest. Of the two of them, Sherlock is usually the childish one, at least by John’s estimate, but there’s no denying that a certain part of John preens to feel so at the centre of Sherlock’s unyielding attention.
“Vite, vite!”
“You can’t!”
John is the first to break the silence. “So… you want to tell me why exactly you’ve decided to kill yourself?”
“Please.”
In truth, he doesn’t deserve either of them.
He didn’t ask to be this way and he wishes that he wasn’t. But then, there never has been a particularly succinct connection between what his brain tells him to want and what he
Sherlock is on the couch, fingers steepled in front of his lips and eyes closed. He’s searching. Searching for the hatch, the backdoor, the shortcut into his mind palace. He’s never searched with a fervour such as this. He pictures himself upending one box of handy reminders after the other, pacing back and forth in his living room, one moment here, one moment there, up and down and round and round… but it’s just in his mind’s eye. It doesn’t feel as it usually does. He isn’t
It had been different with him right from the beginning. Sure, Sherlock had met attractive men before, some of whom he’d seriously considered getting more familiar with. But that had just been brief, easy-to-ignore infatuations, usually fading rapidly by the time the man in question opened his mouth to speak. John was different. It had not been the too-familiar sharp and sweet pang of desire, burning itself out in a matter of moments and leaving only a slightly acidic bitterness and self-reproach in its wake. Instead there had been a slow but steady build-up of tension, an accumulation of interest teetering on the edge between the friendly and the decidedly not. It had lasted for about two days, evidently due to the distraction provided by the case of the taxi driver and the poisoned pills. At its conclusion, John had saved his life. And Sherlock’s initial interest had sparked into a full-blown obsession that had not been the slightest prone to cooling, not the following morning nor the morning after nor three years later. John had given him all sorts of thoughts and desires that he’d never experienced before. And if John hadn’t been
“No, this… this is not under control, Sherlock. I can tell you right now, this is not what ‘under control’ looks like and I haven’t even seen the bloody bedroom yet!”
Sherlock turns his back and heads for the door at the opposite end of the room.
“Did he ever truly see you, Sherlock? Did he ever understand who you are and what you have been struggling with?”
“Yes, it’s snowing.” He gets up from his chair and sits down beside her at the window. “Do you see the snowflakes?”
John is watching him now, all intensity and sincerity and
“What’s tonight?” John is momentarily stunned as the potential humiliation of having to remind Mary that they have a dinner date tonight at an extremely expensive restaurant in the Marylebone Road that John would never ever dream of entering under normal circumstances and has spent weeks planning flashes before his mind’s eye. Then Mary starts to laugh at his flustered expression. “I know, I know. The Landmark, eight o’clock. I remember. Unlike some people, I don’t forget my appointments.” Her tone is kept light and teasing and she gives him a quick peck on the lips as she passes him by. John briefly closes his eyes, pressing his lips together. “Right,” is the only response he can come up with and he leaves it at that.
Mary looks at him, listening with rapt attention, and John is suddenly struck by the realisation that he’s never really done this before, talked to her about Sherlock. Talked about the episodes that happened before she came into the picture and how they affected the way John sees Sherlock.
And yet the second he sees John’s face, he regrets it. Sherlock wishes fiercely to categorise the expression John sports as jealousy, but he’s afraid it might be disgust. And if it is, who could blame him?
“What are you thinking of?”
. John feels the weight of that word even without speaking it aloud. Yes, he loves Sherlock. He loves him fiercely and always has. Just because he’s never acknowledged it aloud doesn’t mean he hasn’t known it. It’s been there somewhere in the back of his mind right from the first time they met. He can try to deny it, has tried to deny it, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s there and it’s there to stay. It’s as simple as that.
“Nothing!” Christ, no one can sound insincere as Mycroft can sound insincere.
He wasn’t really aware how fiercely he wanted it to be Sherlock or how quickly he had convinced himself that it would be en route from the bedroom to the front door. He and Mary’s next-door neighbour Kate, dressed in little more than a pyjamas and a cardigan and sobbing her heart out on their doorstep, is a rather poor replacement. John just stands there for a moment, watching her puffy eyes with not a hint of basic neighbourly decency. It takes Mary to get him moving again, get him to wipe the disappointment (mostly) off his face and invite her in. Though he opts for leaving Kate to Mary as quickly as possible and make coffee for all three of them rather than be a part of the heart-to-heart that she so obviously needs. There are limits and John knows when not to push his luck. He can’t get that damn dream off his mind.
“Involved? I’m not involved!”
Back when he thought that he’d lost Sherlock for good, he might have been able to fool himself into thinking that all he wanted was to have that friendship back. But now Sherlock has given him his miracle. Now John does have him back, and with Mary by his side too. The two people who matter most to him in the entire world are right there by his side and,
“Alright. No hospital. But let me get you off the floor at least. You want me to put you in bed or should I make a bed for you on the couch?”
If John’s mind wasn’t decidedly elsewhere, perhaps Sherlock’s obvious weight loss would concern him more. He puts much too little weight on John’s legs for his size. John’s arms encircle him too easily and with too much length to spare. His buttocks are much too pointy, digging into John’s thighs – or at least they would if Sherlock had been able to muster enough weight behind them to actually dig into another being. His fingers feel long and spindly at the back of John’s head. It doesn’t fully register. But John is a doctor and, no matter how distracted, he can’t help but notice and respond with worry. Still, he tucks the thought away. There will be plenty of time to discuss this later and plenty of meals to correct it.
this. And yet there are times when it feels as real as a pinch.
Then a dam bursts open.
No one ever said that Sherlock was good at faking normality. If he was, he would probably not have ended up in this situation to begin with.
, it just isn’t enough! It’s not the way he wants it to be, not deep down. Like a spoiled brat, he has it all and yet he just isn’t satisfied. Mary is every bit as caring and lovely as she was the day they met, but no matter how hard John tries to focus on that, tries to drive all the unwanted thoughts out of his head, it just doesn’t work. It’s the same old story all over again. Next to Sherlock, everyone else just seems… boring.
He enters the living room and sits down in his chair opposite Sherlock’s, glass of punch balancing precariously on the armrest.
John relaxes inwardly, breathing an inaudible sigh of relief.
Oh dear... So. Here we are with chapter nine. And things are getting grimmer.
This is not the same as Sherlock’s silence or the ghost of his drug abuse or whether or not he loved Irene Adler. This is not some personal aspect of Sherlock’s past that John feels he needs to know but knows that he doesn’t. This is not some part of Sherlock’s inner world that John has no right to demand knowledge of and must instead resign himself to only being able to glimpse on occasion. This is actual, physical trauma on the actual, physical body of his best friend which has been kept a secret from him for at least a year.
Sherlock manages to stand his ground, albeit not without a few crises, until John and Mary have to dance the waltz. As soon as Sherlock picks up the bow and John picks up Mary, it becomes horrifyingly apparent that no amount of rehearsal on Sherlock’s part has been sufficient to prepare him for this moment either. With no more need for his logic mind, Sherlock’s emotions sneak back up on him and overwhelm him completely. Witnessing the actual marriage was bad enough. Seeing John guiding Mary along through the traditional first waltz as a married couple is a whole new level of torture rivalling even the worst moments of his time in Serbia. Sherlock can’t help the comparison, can’t help picturing the way John would hold
An annoying beeping sound as Mycroft ends the call. Once again, Sherlock can’t help but picture that 12 year old sending him back out to his bullies with
Watching John greet his previous commander, or his ex or whatever John wants to call him… the way his face lights up in a smile and the way they salute each other, reminding Sherlock that there are parts of John’s life of which he is not a part and never will be… and then feeling Mary lean in beside him, her arm around his as she remarks with a grin that “neither of us were the first, you know” when it’s her Goddamn
Moriarty arrives shortly thereafter. At least he doesn’t bother Sherlock with expectations.
For his part, Mycroft doesn’t look particularly impressed either. It’s with a deep sigh that he turns back towards his brother. “Where are your supplies? We will need to confiscate everything you have in your possession and it will all be over so much quicker and easier if you just tell us where we should be looking.”
I am so sorry that it has been such a long wait! But, well, life happened and it was pretty bad and needed to be dealt with and it has been and now we're here. I really hope you enjoy this next installation. Please, please feel free to comment and/or leave some kudos, it really does mean a lot to me and is a great motivating factor.
They still haven’t talked about Sherlock’s time abroad. Sherlock himself hasn’t brought it up again and John doesn’t feel like it’s his place to ask. But he doesn’t seem capable of stopping his thoughts from returning to it, over and over and over again, thinking, wondering and imagining. Spinning all sorts of nightmares out of the scant information Sherlock has been willing to provide him with. The only perk John can think of is that if and when Sherlock does eventually decide to tell him about it, at least it seems unlikely that whatever he will say can possibly be worse than what John has already been imagining. The things he’s seen play out before his inner eye in graphic slow motion the past couple of days are bound to be worse than the truth.
a couple of weeks before during their half-hearted attempts to not break down laughing while Sherlock tried to teach John how to dance. He doesn’t feel like laughing now. Like with everything else today, he just isn’t ready when push comes to shove. From control to panic and back again. From hurt to pretended indifference and back again. From logic to emotion and back again. All of it blowing in the wind. All of it laid bare for all to see.
Still, John can’t quite find it in him to agree with Sherlock on this one. How exactly Sherlock’s parents ever managed to produce Sherlock and Mycroft are one of nature’s unsolved mysteries to be sure, and Sherlock’s mother might have some of those aforementioned Holmes family traits, but it doesn’t mean that they don’t love him and John can’t help but smile at the sight of Sherlock’s father ruffing Sherlock’s pillow while his mother tries to get him to agree to a phone call later in the evening. John’s own parents are nothing like this and Sherlock doesn’t seem to have the first idea how lucky he actually is.
needing to pay a visit. Mrs. Hudson comes up with some spaghetti carbonara which John gratefully accepts with a half-hearted promise to return the favour at some other time. Other than that, it’s blissfully quiet all evening. They eat the spaghetti carbonara whilst watching some news and half of a baking contest on the telly that neither of them even pretends to care about. No more than nine or ten words pass between them. The silence balances precariously between suffocating and companionable. It shouldn’t be possible, but it seems to be what happens when you stick a consulting detective who’s only talkative half of the time under the best of circumstances together with his best friend with too many inappropriate fucking feelings and too much emotional baggage in a quiet flat on a Thursday night with nothing on the telly, adding in a pinch of a recent two-week stay in a hospital due to said consulting detective’s unexplainedly long and alarmingly causeless unconsciousness, a good dose of undiscussed past conflicts and betrayals and half a tablespoon of poor decisions.
puts a damper on John’s anger to the point that he almost doesn’t feel insulted. He can still hear himself shouting though.
… that’s the last straw. Neither of them might be the first, but one of them is bound to be the last. And that one is not Sherlock.
“Probably are. But his debit card is not.”
“I never said it was funny…” Sherlock tries. His voice sounds so small. Vulnerable. Right now, that's not enough to quench John's anger. “Yes, Sherlock, you did. In every way short of actual speech. Now let me just tell you, it’s not. And I will not stand here and pretend just so you can get away with this way cheaper than you should, like you always do!” His voice rise to a shout on the last words.
“Hm?”
John throws a glance in the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom. There seems to be no escaping this part of their daily conversations. There’s no reproach in her tone, it’s a genuine inquiry, but it just… Every single phone call, at some point, the same question. And he only ever has one reply for her.
Sherlock sags slightly, partly from relief and partly from something that’s anything but.
But it’s one thing to think it and another to say it.
The second of this five-part short but sweet Christmas extravaganza, using the prompt "Winter". This one is from Sherlock's POV.
But this doesn’t sound like any of that.
John looks down. For some reason, it’s easier to say things that matter if he’s not looking into Sherlock’s eyes. Illogical human nature. He’s getting better at noticing it when it crops up, but he’ll probably never be able to tamp it down like Sherlock does.
feel oppressive in his chest, stretched to bursting with nowhere to go. A river lapping at the top of the dam meant to contain it.
Sherlock just keeps looking at him. John breaks within seconds.
“I think I do.”
Why hello there. Long time, no see.
while relaxing.”
It takes a moment for the words to register. Then John veritably explodes.
Jim’s hands feel impossibly warm on skin that’s rapidly growing slick with sweat, but there’s no accompanying sense of discomfort. His hands are warm without being clammy, strong without being limiting, a far cry from Sherlock’s previous experiences. He might be a virgin, but he’s still a man in his thirties  and he’s frequented his fair share of places associated with a high risk of being on the receiving end of sexual advances, from gay clubs to seedy back alleys designated for shooting up. He is not wholly unfamiliar with the feeling of hands on his skin and lips on his face. But nothing has ever felt quite like this before.
After a while, John begins to undress him again, sensing that Sherlock’s thoughts are back on track. When he gestures for Sherlock to get rid of the dressing gown and shirt completely, it causes yet another momentary lapse until Sherlock gathers his courage and does as John asks, baring his back.
Slowly, hour by hour, feelings and concerns other than just plain anxiety begin to creep up on John. He’s starting to look at Sherlock in a particular way again, one that he hasn't experienced in years. A
At long last, a touch of the Jim Moriarty Sherlock has gotten to know over the past days. The Jim Moriarty who is his lover and his friend. The Jim Moriarty who seduces and comforts him with every word. Sherlock all but melts into it, desperate for something to cling on to in his free-fall.
Sherlock sighs softly and shakes his head, stretching his arms overhead. “Mm, can’t say that I have. Which was the reason for, you know…” He gestures towards the microscope half-heartedly.
“When Mycroft advised me not to tell you, it was after the fact! That day at Bart’s, there were people standing by, snipers, professional, Moriarty had placed them there, they were… they were waiting to see me jump and instructed to take you out, you and Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, unless… Do you think you could have faked watching me commit suicide? Do you think you could have done that convincingly enough for them not to…” Sherlock shakes his head. “I couldn’t risk it, John, I couldn’t risk it and I had no time! I had no time…”
The floor sways. The windows vibrate. The doors rattle. Or it might all be in his mind palace.
… well, that seemed even worse to me. So I did it. So I know. And even before that, it wasn’t as if I thought it was all a big joke to you, but again it was the lesser of two evils and when I came back and saw you in the restaurant, I didn’t know how to… how to say that or any of it and I needed it to be okay, but it wasn’t and I messed it up and I’m sorry, John, I’m sorry, I’m so
In the bag are two books.
to your face… are you offended then?”
Here I am at last with the third chapter of Icebergs! That whole posting a new chapter every month thing died pretty quickly, didn't it? I'm sorry about that, new semester can be a bit of a b-word.
“Get. Out.”
It’s not malice now. There’s delight in Moriarty's face, but it’s not a cruel delight. There’s amusement, amusement at Sherlock’s expense, but it’s not the condescending amusement Sherlock remembers from the pool, from the courtroom, from the flat, from the rooftop, from nearly every encounter they’ve ever had face to face. It’s a relaxed amusement. An unproblematic amusement. If the person sitting across from him were anyone but Jim Moriarty, perhaps Sherlock would even have called it a normal amusement. The sort of amusement old friends get when they meet again several years down the road and discover that they haven’t changed at all and still know each other inside out. But it is Jim Moriarty sitting across from him, smiling like the cat who got its cream, and he’s supposed to be dead and none of this is normal and
He’s the one person who hasn’t abandoned Sherlock up until now. Maybe Sherlock can allow himself to hope that Moriarty will prove to be the one person who will not turn his back.
John is trying to catch his gaze now, let him know that they’re about to start and he’s expected at the table.
From: Sherlock. Time: 3:24 PM.
But he
“I couldn’t… It was all just… too much, John.
“What’s it like then?”
do. Sometimes it’s not all that easy to figure stuff out, you know.”
Sherlock’s voice sounds abnormally high in the ringing silence of the flat.
And so he replies, if only to drag out a moment that he should be trying to put an end to. He doesn't even lie.
His mouth opens.
John and Mary are getting married. It’s a marriage. It’s not the end of the world. And even if John should have much less time for him from now on, why should he care? He’s been alone before, he can be alone again. What exactly is John anyway, other than a little follow-along for Sherlock to impress during his deductions? Why should it even matter if he’s there or not? It’s not as though he’s much of a help when it comes to solving a case. He’s never been the most luminous of people.
He can't hear this.
Sherlock falls silent, his gaze sliding to the floor.
, that it can’t be right. Sherlock can feel something clicking into place in his mind, a deduction he desperately doesn’t want to make. He rushes to the window, ripping the curtains apart, and there is old familiar Baker Street, everything in its place, people and cars passing by as always. And yet. The window doesn’t open either, no matter how much force he puts into pushing it. He bangs his hands against it, frantically hammering his fists into the glass while shouting at the top of lungs, and no one seems to hear a thing. People just keep on walking.
Sherlock’s eyes are cold when John looks up in surprise, matching his tone of voice.
It’s quickly developing into John’s standard shorthand for conveying to him that Rosie is unlikely to be able to understand what he’s saying to her.
Gradually, the heat of emotion gives way to a frenzied desire. It starts at the tips of Sherlock’s fingers where they run through John’s hair and make contact with the skin at the back of his neck. Spreads from those initial points of contact up his arms where it makes the hairs stand on end. Continues towards his chest, and lower. From what he can sense with their bodies partially pressed together, the feeling is far from one-sided. That revelation only makes the electrical wiring in his nerves flare up brighter.
Jim continues unperturbed.
Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa or just a joyful time of year whatever you do or do not celebrate to everyone! I hope you have a wonderful time and wish you all the best for the New Year!
John sips his wine slowly, letting the flavour swirl around his mouth. He had been wrong about himself. He had thought Captain John Watson was as close to his core being as he could come. But he had never fully felt himself until he met Sherlock. It was as simple as that. Sherlock had drawn out all of his truest sides, both the good and the bad, in a way that nothing and no one had ever done before or after. John Watson only became John Watson after Sherlock Holmes. But if that’s true, then can there even be a John Watson without a Sherlock Holmes? It’s a question John has often asked himself and he still isn’t sure. He has undoubtedly improved his ability to be John Watson without Sherlock Holmes during the last two years. He has managed to get hold again of some of those pieces of himself drifting around, especially since Mary entered his life. Still it’s true that much of John Watson lies buried with Sherlock Holmes. That’s who Sherlock Holmes was to John Watson. While Sherlock was still…
John takes a deep breath before he even tries to begin, thinking his thoughts through to the end before he dares to voice them.
“I wanted to say… to ask… to say,” he begins, mentally cringing when he hears what’s coming out of his mouth. His hard drive and his transport clearly share a bad connection at the moment. He takes a deep breath. “I’m glad you’re here, John. And if you want to stay, you’re more than welcome. Even if you want to stay… permanently. Your room is upstairs, your chair is still here. W-we could… it could be like old times. I… I’d like that. Very much.” He pauses for a heartbeat. “
“It’s a quote from the Zhuangzi, an ancient Chinese book of philosophy.” Sherlock keeps his eyes strictly on the window.
Which is why John doesn’t feel particularly charitable towards the higher powers at the moment and why he isn’t exactly in a repentant mood about it either. If Sherlock was alive and well, no
“Right,” she says. “Well… you better get back to it then, don’t you think?”
“You know… alright?”
Several seconds pass before his brain starts working enough for him to understand where he is. He’s in a bonfire, that’s what he is. He’s still too sluggish to even begin to wonder why or remember how he got here, but the feel and smell of wood and pine needles combined with the sounds of people talking on all sides of him is at least enough to clue him in to his current position. He wants to shout, but the rest of his body is even less functional than his brain at the moment and he can’t manage to engage his vocal chords. He wants to move, the instinct to
It’s in that moment that the last bit of reserve concerning Sherlock’s ability to care for him evaporates. There’s simply no way of misinterpreting Sherlock’s embrace for anything but what it is.
But that’s where the difficulty arises. Mary isn’t a passive participant, a presence unfelt. She makes herself very known and, though Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind and John doesn’t feel that he should either, it isn’t the same as before. They’re doing exactly the same things as they used to do two years ago, but Mary’s presence has altered their dynamic in a pretty drastic way, one that John is having a very hard time ignoring. John isn’t able to give Sherlock his undivided attention for hours as he used to. Sherlock no longer directs all his inquiries towards John. (Does Sherlock talk to Mary too when she isn’t there? That thought leaves John with a bad taste in his mouth.)
Sherlock realises with a start that they’re not alone in here. Someone is there behind John, obscured in the shadows of the room, but steadily moving closer, closer…
And no matter how badly Sherlock wishes he could fall apart without Jim, no matter how badly he just wants to fuck it all and cry and scream and do drugs and possibly even go back into a coma if that’s what it fucking takes to return to Jim, there John is and there John remains, by his side, stubbornly refusing to let him fall apart.
All of it for a fool’s hope that John might… that he and John could…
But there’s something else too. There’s always been something else. And as John brings up one forbidden image of Sherlock hidden away in the deepest, most private recesses of his mind after the other – Sherlock lying prone on the couch with his dressing gown slipping off, Sherlock straightening his suit in the mirror before going out, Sherlock rustling his curls to make them appear more luxurious, Sherlock looking up from his microscope to meet John’s gaze with that intense expression of excitement - there’s little doubt in his mind what that something else is. Sherlock is beautiful. He always has been, with his slender built and rich curls, his sparkling eyes and perfect cupid’s bow. John has always seen it. And if John had been… overtly… interested in the same sex, then he would have acknowledged to himself a long fucking time ago that Sherlock overshadows everyone else in that department as well. That’s why John could never keep his girlfriends for long back then. Next to Sherlock, they just left him feeling utterly disinterested, physically and emotionally.
Sherlock mounts the seventeen steps up to 221B with something resembling pain. The weight he’s been carrying for so long has returned to weigh down his steps. He closes the door behind him, not bothering to check if it locks. Maybe it’s because he doesn’t care. Maybe it’s because he’s confident that it was never, in fact, locked, and it was all just in his head. Sherlock favours the latter despite its troubling implications for his sanity. Rather a fool before and a genius now than an uncaring existence throughout.
the one person.
Sherlock briefly considers delivering a five-minute crash course in geometry, but one glance at Mrs. Hudson and that idea is quickly scrapped in favour of the easy route.
Sherlock takes a long time to reply. John gets the impression that there’s a very long way from Sherlock’s ears to the interpretational centres of his brain and an even longer way from those to his vocal cords. It’s a far cry from Sherlock’s usually so precise and rapid comebacks. A stark reminder that he is still very much not alright.
Sherlock whips around to face him, breaking him off before John can question him. A moment ago, they were laughing, but now Sherlock’s eyes are hard as flint and glistening with what looks alarmingly like yet more unshed tears. The sudden change leaves John reeling, struggling desperately to catch up. The unspoken things coalesce into a tightly wound up little ball of…
There’s a slight twist on one side of Moriarty’s mouth as it’s lifted into a mixture of a smirk and a smile. “I told you, Sherlock. I want to solve the problem. Our problem. The final problem.”
He wants out.
What was the point of all of those events and emotions and situations playing out just so, leading from one to the other? Leading John and Sherlock together, leading them away from each other, leading John to Mary, leading Sherlock back to John and finally… finally this. If this is what it was all leading to… well, what the hell did any of it matter then?
In front of them, Battersea Power Station rises up in an imposing, and some would say defacing, manner. It sends a cold shiver down Sherlock’s spine, filling him with a foreign sensation that he isn’t quite sure how to process. His stomach is twisting and turning. His hands and feet feel cold and numb. His head is woozy. As though all the blood in his body has rushed to his strangely accelerating heart. There’s something he’s struggling to remember, but it remains tantalisingly just out of reach. Like a quote you keep thinking of, but you can’t remember who said it. Like a melody stuck in your head, but you can’t recall the next line.
any further.
“Well… both, I suppose.”
Sherlock is pale. His skin seems whiter than usual, thinner somehow, stretched out over his already too fragile frame. Bone china: untarnished, delicate, breakable. Breakable more than anything. It appears translucent in places, almost purplish in others. Sherlock looks exactly like what he is: a man who almost died of a drug overdose less than an hour ago, yet somehow, miraculously, pulled through to live another day. His steadily rising and falling chest is evidence of that, evidence that John’s eyes feel glued to. It’s almost as though it's his own chest he's looking at. He only breathes himself once he’s made sure that Sherlock is still doing the same.
John smiles comfortably.
“But, Sherlock, that’s… you can’t do that!" John bursts out. "Your brain, it… just because you set everything up to look like real life doesn’t mean you can actually perform legitimate tests that way. How a blood splatter looks, it’s just going to be your brain projecting your ideas about the case onto an imaginary wall. It’s not real!"
He used to be so clever, didn’t he? Back then when he and John had just met each other and everything was new and exciting because Sherlock for the first time in his life had someone who didn’t make him feel as though he was alone in a crowd. Someone who would listen to his deductions, smile and say
Anyhow. Sherlock is on his best behaviour. He does his best to not let his exasperation show when his mother asks him for the fifth time to come with his parents back to Sussex while he’s recovering or when Molly asks him how he’s feeling in so timid and lengthy a fashion that John feels his own patience wearing a bit thin just listening to it.
“Yes and no,” he replies cautiously, letting it hang in the air for a moment to judge John’s immediate response. Apart from a slight movement of his throat and Adam’s apple as he swallows and an almost invisible tightening around the mouth, he keeps quiet and still.
Sherlock’s phantom body pulls away, shrinks back into the sofa cushions and curls in on itself there. A tightly contained supernova.
Of course Mycroft doesn’t stop where Sherlock wants him to. That would be uncharacteristically generous of him.
Mary swallows slightly. Then she sends Sherlock one glance so acidic that John, had it been levelled at him, would have been forced to avert his gaze. But Sherlock merely accepts it, calmly holding her gaze until she marches to the door, throwing it open and slamming it shut behind her.
John hesitates. He thought he'd stay the night. He really doesn’t want to leave. Didn't he tell Sherlock earlier that he wouldn't walk out that door until he's absolutely certain Sherlock won't find his needles again the moment his back is turned? Is this a ploy to get rid of him? Sherlock looks okay for all intents and purposes, relaxed and mostly comfortable in his own skin. He hasn't given any indication that he's in need of a new fix all afternoon. There's nothing dishonest or frantic to trace in his eyes. It’s more of a feeling, really. A vague insecurity and a not-so-vague desire to stay. On the other hand, both Sherlock and Mary seem to be urging him to go home. Neither is directly shoving him out the door, that’s true, but Mary is clearly expecting him to come home tonight and Sherlock seems downright dismissive. Will Sherlock consider it an indication that John doesn't have any faith in him if he stays anyway? Maybe it would be better to leave the decision to Sherlock. To show him that John trusts him and fully believes he can do this.
Also, I don't say this enough, but I would like to give a big thank you to everyone reading, bookmarking, leaving kudos and commenting! It means so much to me!
think something, but what the hell I think, I don’t even fucking know anymore.”
Sherlock’s head has snapped towards him the moment John forced the door up, but now he’s not moving a muscle. He’s watching John, sadly and silently, not attempting to cover what has already been revealed, letting him look his fill.
he shows up. And either way, cocaine has never solved any of his problems. It’s just a pathetic escape, a temporary reprieve. The weak man’s way out.
John’s eyes have begun to sting. It’s with some surprise that he recognises the feeling as a precursor of tears. John hasn’t cried in years. Strangely appropriately, he doesn’t remember having cried since he stood alone by Sherlock’s grave after the funeral. Those tears had been an admission of care, even of love, in the face of utter defeat. That those tears had all been for nothing had been one of the hardest pills for John to swallow.
! And John can stay at home with his pretty blond nurse of a wife who has all the right curves in all the right places and always knows the correct way to act and speak, who doesn’t come packaged with any questions for John to struggle over in his own utterly constipated, ineffectual manner.
“I’m… sorry?”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. He’s mortified to discover that any sound he makes probably has a high chance of coming out as a sob.
John isn’t angry. It’s just about the only feeling he isn’t currently experiencing, which is odd to say the least when he considers how powerfully his anger and frustration had overwhelmed him yesterday. Now he isn’t angry, apart from the anger he feels at himself. He’s angry at himself for having left when he should have stayed, for missing the signs that Sherlock was not as okay as he let on, for letting himself be talked into leaving Sherlock’s side just to spend another ordinary, meaningless evening with Mary. But even that anger, as enormous and all-consuming as it might turn out to be at the end of the day, is simply too taxing for John to bother with right now. Nor is he angry at Sherlock. Maybe it will come later, just as it did after Bart’s. Maybe the anger at Sherlock for toying with his life in so nonchalant a fashion, for not asking for help when he needed it, will come sneaking up on John in a few hours’ time and choke him. For now, he feels no anger. Just a burning desire for Sherlock to be alright, for him to pull through and open his eyes and look up at John and smile and assure John that he’s absolutely fine even when he quite clearly isn’t so John can call him a git and they can laugh and John can feel confident that it’s all going to be alright.
They relapse into silence.
As though he doesn’t exist.
“Is this just an excuse for an overuse of expletives and f-words or do you actually have a point?”
him come, he just turned up. And he was the only one who did,” Sherlock adds, almost accusatorily, as if John could have just decided to show up in Sherlock’s Mind Palace if he could have been bothered to do so.
Mrs. Hudson’s patience is unending. It’s actually quite nice to have her up here in their flat for Christmas Eve. She’s endlessly indulgent when it comes to Rosie, which takes some of the pressure from Sherlock’s shoulders while John is being creative in the kitchen. As far as Sherlock can understand, he’s trying to prepare a final batch of cookies while deciding on how much alcohol to put in the punch. He looks a tiny bit stressed, shoulders tense and hands flexing restlessly. Multitasking has never been his strong suit. Neither has cooking, though Sherlock will be the first to admit that, of the two of them, John is by far the better cook. Perhaps Sherlock shouldn’t leave it all in his hands when he so obviously can’t manage it, but they seem to have arrived at a sort of mutual silent agreement over the years that Sherlock is not of much help in a kitchen. Truth be told, he’s mostly just in the way. So Sherlock doubts that John would even want his help if he were to offer it. Instead it’s his job to look after Rosie, but Mrs. Hudson is mostly managing that by herself.
John grins up at him. “I’m sure you don’t.” Then he gets up, feeling considerably less worn-out than before Sherlock and Rosie’s return, and helps Rosie get her snowsuit, shoes, scarf, hat and mittens off. It’s almost as though he’s unwrapping her, revealing her brightly grinning person layer by layer.
“Shut up!”
“It’s snow. At this temperature, the water in the atmosphere never gets above 0 °C, which is the melting temperature of water, so the precipitation that would normally fall as rain falls as snow instead. It’s basic physics.”
A muscle twitches along Sherlock’s jaw as he grits his teeth and suddenly the words come pouring out. “I wanted to be just the brain, John! All these emotions, I don’t want them anymore! What good are they for? They’ve done me nothing but harm and they distract me from doing something I’m actually able to derive just a modicum of pleasure from! So I wanted rid of them!”
The mind palace is meant to be a memory technique. A mental landscape for Sherlock to move through in order to locate information. It isn’t meant to affect him physically and it isn’t meant to take any effort to get out of. Although Sherlock emerges himself on a much more fundamental level than what you’re generally advised to do, he’s not completely dislocated from his own body while in the mind palace. He’s always aware that what he’s seeing is not real. He’s always aware, however faintly, of what’s going on around his real body. Which is to say that Sherlock is always aware that he isn’t actually locked in anywhere and can just open his eyes whenever he feels like it. Primary conclusion: The mind palace is still functioning accordingly and everything is under control despite a failure to properly locate and fix the leakage. Secondary conclusion: How exactly he just managed to experience claustrophobia in his own mind palace is a bit unclear at present.
emotions piling up have nowhere to go. This gradual loss of control over his mind palace seems to be the result. His increasingly obsessive inner monologue is pulling him apart, giving him headaches and depriving him of his sleep.
This time, John at least lets Mary talk him into following her down to the cafeteria for a cup of coffee.
Moriarty strolls into Sherlock’s flat as though he owns the place. The Sun is barely up yet, only just beginning to peek over the horizon.
Very little response. John has never met anyone able to look so completely disinterested and yet so thoroughly unimpressed as Mycroft.
Mycroft scoffs derisively, mirroring John's sentiments. "Do you honestly think anyone in here is willing to believe in you? Doctor Watson might be gullible, that's true-" John makes a mental note to bring this up with Mycroft later, "but he's a doctor too. And I regret to inform you that there are decided limits to your credibility in this situation. You restricting your substance abuse to the occasional night out on the town when you have the entire flat to yourself isn’t really a believable scenario, wouldn't you agree?" He hesitates a moment, clearly picking out a point of attack. "Your bedroom door is shut, I see." Sherlock stirs at that, raising his head just the slightest millimeter from the armrest, and Mycroft pounces immediately. Like a vulture descending on the prey. "Why would a man who has never knowingly closed the door without the direct orders of his mother bother to do so on this occasion?” He straightens up, crosses the living room in one, two, three steps, arrives at Sherlock's bedroom door, closes his hand around the handle and...
He pauses, debates with himself whether it wouldn’t be more strategic to just leave it at that. But this isn’t about strategy.
But the John who had said
Mary hangs up.
John is taken completely by surprise, so stunned that he momentarily forgets how he’s supposed to feel disconnected from everything and just stares instead. He almost feels bad for witnessing this. Feels as though he ought to look away. John may be Sherlock’s best friend, his flatmate of five years. A man who’s witnessed just about every major altercation between the Holmes boys during that time span and even participated in some of them. Yet somehow, this feels just a tad too close, too private, too intimate for John to be watching. As though he’s peeping in on a scene that he has no right to know about. A connection that runs so deep and is usually so well hidden that John feels like an intruder just for being here, getting a glimpse of an affection that was never his to glimpse.
He’s ready.
Why shouldn’t he make it stop? John isn’t here anyway, so what’s the point? What’s the point in sitting here, feeling guilty and hurt and pitiful all on his own, when he could easily make it all go away?
He leans forward, hiding his face in his hands. He doesn’t quite sob. He just shakes.
“It’s always the unexpected. You know, people think they’ve got him figured out in two minutes flat when they meet him. That he’s an addict or a psychopath or a freak. Or all three.” John shrugs and shakes his head. He’s never been able to let the standard assessment that most people come to where Sherlock is concerned go without expressing his opposition to it. He doesn't really know why he's saying this. “They’ll never really understand him, I don’t think.”
There are no words to describe the impact of that realisation.
Sherlock is startled out of his reverie by Jim’s hand on his thigh. “We’re here, sweet thing,” he explains. Sherlock hadn’t realised he was drifting, letting the London landscape pass before his eyes without taking in any information on landmarks or directions. Still, as Jim gestures imploringly out through the car window towards an industrial factory on the riverbank, their current location is not a very difficult deduction for Sherlock to make.
A heartbeat of silence.
Sherlock looks at John honestly and John holds his gaze. He looks pained, but there’s a certain almost wondrous bafflement in his eyes too. He seems confused.
John decides to just get it over with. Procrastinating like this is just dragging everything out unnecessarily, making this feel ten times more awkward than it has to.
Mary is his wife, but Sherlock is his best friend, so what of it? Sherlock had looked almost happy when he had finally accepted John’s proclamations. His lips had drawn up in a small smile, there had been a slight wrinkling at the corners of his eyes and he’d looked at John in that rare, soft way of his that John has never quite figured out how to properly respond to.
“Hm. I suppose you’re right. In any case, I would have solved the whole thing in a couple of days at most.”
And Christ, John has no idea what to get him. Sherlock is an exceptionally difficult person to shop for because his tastes are so stupidly specific and impossible to figure out. John can’t get him books because Sherlock doesn’t read fiction and already owns a huge collection of non-fiction books on every topic under the sun, which means that John has absolutely no chance of figuring out which he might already own and which he might consider too simple and basic for him. John can’t get him any clothing items either, what with Sherlock’s ongoing accusation of him having bad taste and John having to admit that he hasn’t the faintest idea about the kinds of styles that Sherlock seems to follow with diligence (although that doesn’t stop him from noticing when Sherlock has gone the extra mile with his appearance, much to Sherlock’s delight; there are certain items of dress in Sherlock’s possession that does
John still catches him every once in a while, deep in thought and completely uncommunicative, frustrated and uncomfortable when disturbed, but lacking the necessary energy to display any actual anger. He just wraps his arms around his legs, looks into a wall and shuts up like a clam, physically and, it seems, mentally as well. Whatever was haunting him before their long overdue heart-to-heart a couple of days ago is apparently still there although there’s no doubt that their talk has cleared the air quite a bit and returned relations between them to a more than tolerable state.
But not about Mary. There are still things Sherlock feels he ought to say about Mary. Things he was preparing himself to say and might still say if John should decide to go back to her. Perhaps that’s slightly underhanded, withholding potentially damning information until he might need it to tip the balance in his own favour. The way Sherlock sees it, though, there’s no reason for John to know if he isn’t going to go back to her anyway. And in either case, Sherlock has no proof. It’s not even something he knows for certain. It’s an inkling and a suspicion, something he isn’t quite certain how to put into words. Something his brain has been trying to tell him for a long time now.
think. And not only is it frankly
A small voice chips in that that’s the pot calling the kettle black, but John tries to ignore that.
Despite John’s further questions, Sherlock will say no more on the matter. Indeed, it seems he’ll say no more on any matter. He's completely silent and uncommunicative on the rest of the ride back to Baker Street. John offers a hand to help him get out of the cab, but he ignores it. Mrs. Hudson comes out to fuss and see if she can assist him with anything, bless her sweet soul, but Sherlock ignores her as well.
Who else strolls into Sherlock’s room before any of the people John has called but the British Government himself? Looking for all the world as though he not only owns the place, but that
He can’t keep going back and forth.
. Sherlock fights hard to control the confused tangle of emotions welling up in him, the result of which is evidently unsuccessful. Moriarty, predictably, seems to notice despite Sherlock’s best efforts, smirking as he pulls John’s chair over to the sofa and settles down.
. Work or no work, John has been awake for well over 30 hours by now - if one doesn’t count a truly excruciating 20-minute power nap right here in his chair that left him feeling sore in just about every muscle conceivable. John is a doctor, he knows what lack of sleep can do. He knows that his current level of sleep deprivation isn’t doing him any favours. In combination with the stress and anxiety he’s been experiencing since last morning, it’s positively detrimental to his ability to cope with the situation.
