But he doesn’t. He teases again, dipping his cock into just Bucky’s upper half before pulling out again. This time, a bead of precum slips down his head and along Bucky’s front. He’s leaking already and he hasn’t even made it in yet.
Sometimes Steve reaches his hand down his boxers first thing in the morning and jacks off without even remembering Bucky’s in there until after, when there’s come sloshing down his entire front and he’s gasping out a soft
“I bet that’s great,” Sam says, eyes on Steve but hips still rolling back and forth to absently fuck the guy beneath him.
Maybe it was the wrong thing to say, because as soon as it’s out of his mouth some blood flows south into Steve’s cock - it twitches to life, and his fingers curl up a little around it.
It shouldn’t be that hard to wake his brother up, in theory. Standing next to his ear and yelling his name, even at an inch tall, ought to be enough to wake him. It’s not, though, and maybe Sam can blame the six or eight beers Dean had before falling asleep. Whatever the case may be, all it results in is a frustrated, enormous hand descending upon him and slapping down onto him like he’s a snooze button. Thank god the pillow’s soft, otherwise Dean would have inadvertently crushed him like a bug.
It isn’t the first time Bucky’s been interrupted from whatever he’d been doing for Steve’s personal enjoyment, and it’s far from the first time he’s wound up flat on his back staring up at the underside of his fat cock, though usually it’s not flaccid at the start. He’s expecting the usual litany of dirty talk Steve murmurs that gets him hard as hell, but this time there’s nothing of the sort. There’s just his soft dick, two fingers wrapped around the base of it, and then the slow lift followed by a sudden
The way Natasha likes to sleep (when she’s got the security and the comfort to choose how she does so) is perhaps a little unusual. She sleeps with at least one arm under her pillow, she sleeps with a thicker, firmer pillow between her thighs, and-  perhaps most notably- she sleeps naked.
He got used to it eventually. Started feeling comforted by the weight of half a guy on top of him, bare skin to bare skin, pinning him protectively against the mattress. Puts him out like a light these days, deepest sleep he’s gotten in years.
Cas moans again at the sensation. He stopped just so he could lift up and work his trousers down a few inches, but he doesn’t even get the chance to remove his underwear before heat and pleasure spark at the stimulation.
The divots disappear with that same rushing, deafening white-noise, and then above him the heavens open up. Where there once was darkness, now a slowly widening gaping light streaming in, blocked in the middle by a god-like face larger than any moon  in the night sky. Bucky’s face blown up times a million, every detail enhanced from his bright blue searching eyes to the little chapped wrinkles in his lips.
Dean tentatively thrusts, twice, and has to stop again because coming after two thrusts is just… it’s just pathetic.
it so that the base nearly touches his feet. Bucky’s fingers loosely grip himself, absent and unconcerned. A glance up shows the twitching of his stomach, the slight bulging that must be his bladder, and then the
She was already feeling a little claustrophobic, being pinned between the underside of Clint’s dick and the unforgiving material of his underwear and pants. There wasn’t enough room above or below her to shift around, no real repositioning any way that would help, and to top it off Clint just keeps twitching, gently shoving her back-first into his underwear as hot throbs of blood and arousal pulse against her.
Inside, Steve feels everything. Every pass of Bucky’s hand sliding up and down his shaft, tightening up where Steve is and then loosening as it coasts up. He feels every sharp throb, every rolling twitch of pleasure, and it’s an honest to god fight to keep himself from drowning on the precum that just keeps leaking up around him, lubricating the way down.
Plucks her out with flesh fingers and lowers her down, down, down toward his already hard cock. Metal fingers gently press at the head until his slit opens, and he begins to work her in head-first.
His index finger glides down from stomach to thigh, to the edge of where her tiny pencil skirt nearly hits her knee. Fingerprint whirls and gentle callouses catch on the fabric, and he reverses the movement to cleanly push it
And then he peels back, and thrusts forward again. The second time, the sheets beneath Bucky feel wet. Not hard to guess the source, Steve’s started leaking and soaking the sheets beneath the head of his cock, then ramming Bucky through the slick of it as he ruts.
On every up stroke the balls lift up off of him just a little, and on every down stroke they slam back into him. It’s slow at first, with Cas breathing softly, taking smooth and circular motions.
Seemingly satisfied, the tongue moves to drop heavily onto him, shrouding him in heat and darkness, trapping him beneath it so that he can only barely see the influx of light from Bucky’s parting lips. Another chip passes through them, and this time Bucky’s mouth closes completely before he chews - the tongue thrusts the chip up with great force into the roof of his mouth, cracking it and breaking it at the center so saliva and gentle guidance steer it in uneven halves toward teeth on either side.
, and if anything they only drove home what a great decision this was. Later on when Bucky comes to his senses and realizes Steve’s only keeping himself from the enormous outside world, he’ll accept the apology.
Going straight would be faster, but it means scaling up the navy-blue seam of Bucky’s boxer briefs, and while the thought makes him tremendously uncomfortable, well…
It’s thoughtful, and as he considers it a thumb lifts up to start circling the head around Bucky like a looming shark circles prey. It drops down so Steve can start stroking properly, a little breathless as he stares down at Bucky.
Bucky’s thumb smooths over the head of his dick, and Steve drops into a hot, tight, pulsing chamber. He can see out the top when he cranes his neck back, he can see light that pulses open, closed, open, closed in time with the shifting of pressure as Bucky’s hand works himself up and down. He can hear Bucky’s heartbeat, his reverberating moans. Can feel Bucky’s cock twitching and throbbing in sheer pleasure at the feeling, and he fights to make his way back to the top.
it. Within ten minutes, Sam was hard again, and sweating. His muscles shook with the intense feeling rocketing through him, cock almost burning with sensation, groans of both pain and pleasure tearing their way out of his throat as Dean relentlessly rubbed.
He rolls forward again, and Steve can feel the rhythm pick up the pace. The sweeping dread in him probably matches the sheer heat running through Bucky as he thinks about the prospect. Waking up beneath them, trapped in cotton underwear, struggling to try and climb them. Crushed under them when Bucky sits, sweating his ass off when Bucky runs, falling asleep down there just to wake up under them again. Every minute of every goddamn day, with Bucky leaving him underneath his balls to make him feel good– or just because it turns him on knowing Steve’s under there.
“I’m so sorry, Dean, I didn’t see you there,” He says, flushing with guilt, shame, and… the smallest bit of regret that he stopped things so soon. It really had been quite a nice sensation.
Bucky isn’t listening, he’s half-lidded, drunk, gone on lust, and he raises Steve up to his mouth to wrap plush lips around his one-inch cock. His entire package fits on Bucky’s lips, he licks and sucks Steve so warm and so unbelievably well that before Steve knows it he’s moaning, thrusting into Bucky’s lips and tongue, giving in to the pleasure he’s never felt before.
.” He murmurs, hissing something hot and approving through his teeth. His legs spread more widely, knees splayed, hips rocking back and forth, pelvis rocking into the heat behind him and then down into the pillow again in thumping thrusts.
For Bucky, it’s rigid and ungentle fingers digging around through the cloth until it finds him, smashing him up against the underside of a dick and dragging them both into position to be restrained by boxers and trousers.
The skyscraper that is Steve does not acknowledge him. He moves around the room taking his boots off, shedding clothes layer by layer, sighing so loud it sounds like the wind. It’s clear Steve doesn’t hear them when even his boxers come off, and his massive naked body looms over them without thought nor care.
glide. On instinct, she reaches her tiny hands up to grab at either of his fingers, her face still a mask of unflappable, unimpressed annoyance.
, it’s just when she’s smashed chest-first into the head of her partner’s soft cock it’s a little hard to be logical.
And how in the hell is he supposed to do that? He peels back, looking left then right. Either side framing him is just smooth, hairless inner thigh. Trying to climb them would be fruitless and time consuming. His eyes land on Steve’s testicles again, the easy hand and footholds they’ll make, and he sighs to himself.
His eyes fall on a crater in the floor, and that’s when he knows. The ground gives way to a smudge of yellow, of the guts and gore in the seat of a car. The crater is perfectly circle, fringed and black at the edges. He knows it because he’s stared at it almost every day for his entire life.
It opens again on the down-stroke, and Steve’s moaning down at him. The space around him flexes, and as the hand passes over him he feels himself slipping a little deeper down. It earns another sharp
,” he says, and it nearly blows Bucky’s eardrums out. He can feel the heat of breath coasting over him, and his eyes sting with the sharpness of fresh mint from his toothpaste. “It’s temporary. Called in a favor with a couple of wizards. Think about this the next time you wanna go stirring shit, huh?”
having to stare straight down at a drop toward the floor. On the other, as it’s gotten harder it’s also gotten bigger, longer, filling with blood to the point that his arms no longer fully reach around it.
“Fits like a glove, it’s uncanny,” she muses, and he can hear her voice all around him rolling muted through her body until it’s almost distorted too deeply for him to understand -
him up the shaft all the way up to the head, skin bunching, his own head peeking over the tip of dick long enough to see the span of blazer, white dress shirt, tan trench coat, and then Castiel’s face. He’s reclined back on the pillows, hair tousled, eyes closed, lips parted,
It goes like that for six or eight rounds, the slowest and most deliberate fucking possible, until it becomes rhythmic again. Bucky’s back slides up and down tight, wet muscle that grips at him and clenches at him, grinding the breath out of him. Steve’s dick is absolutely loving it, he can tell by all the pleasurable throbs rolling through him. He goes back to deliberately angling his cock so that it grinds against Bucky on every thrust, battering his muscles and stealing air from his lungs.
They’re back in the motel. The jacket’s fanned over Dean’s hips, and he gets now why the tapping was so strong. He wasn’t more than six inches from Dean’s pelvis. A glance over has him freezing, eyes wide, at the sight of it. Dean’s cock is a monolith, six or seven times taller than him and four or so times wider, real-time HD
when Steve strokes up his dick. The pressure becomes immense, and the window over his head closes up to blot out all light.
During this alone time, he makes it clear what he expects of Dean. He’s to stimulate on command, and he’s to work as many orgasms out of Castiel as the angel decides. There are times when Dean goes still and unmoving inside Castiel’s boxer shorts, but all it really takes is to reach down and roughly squeeze himself (and Dean) through his clothes or, at worst, manually massage himself with Dean’s body.
That was the left foot. The right one is next, another feeling of soaring, a little raise to the testicle on that side, and then a punishing
And it didn’t stop. It was agony, too sensitive, too much, too soon, and he was getting raw. He managed to come twice more before the night was over, dick used and battered like it hadn’t been in ages, and only when Dean’s soaps were over did he take his hand out of his pocket, never the wiser.
The captain is last, this man from the bridge that he knows. He’s plucked up off the asset’s balls and held in the curve of flesh fingers that pass over his leaking head, then pressed against the sensitive underside of his cock. He can feel the captain squirming on the outside in almost the same place the redhead squirms on the inside, and he throws his head back at the sensation.
He has to blink and squint to clear his eyes, and even then everything’s still a little blurry for being so, so big. He sees the wide head of Bucky’s cock stretching out several feet in either direction, filthy-slick and shiny from semen. He feels it gently smush him in an embrace a a massive hand strokes up it again. In the far, far off distance he can see Bucky’s slitted eyes staring down at him like some kind of god. He’s vast, enormous, everywhere. He is foreign and almost unreachably alien at this scale.
“Maybe we should get you one of those fidget spinners,” she volunteers dryly, a hint in her voice like she’s chastising him.
Dean goes faster, his gasps filling the air, his cock pulsing and throbbing over his brother. Sam can feel how close he is, he can feel through the pulsing and the twitching that Dean’s really enjoying himself. He can feel rolling throbs running through it, and he knows Dean’s chasing an orgasm no matter how loudly Sam begs him not to.
The moaning becomes a constant. The grinding becomes nonstop. It’s like he’s looking for Bucky with each punishing thrust of his hips.
, he thinks. No point in saying it, neither of them are gonna hear him through his rubber prison walls. He’s secured firmly, encased in something he knows Steve doesn’t even really need to use - which means he’s just doing it because of Bucky. He doubts it’s for Bucky’s safety, for any kind of consideration on his part, and…
She shoots one self-satisfied look back at him when the bus reaches her destination, then slips away without a single word.
And then he leans forward, rolling his balls over Dean’s face and jerking a few times before he leans back again. It makes Dean squirm beneath them, which feels really pleasant, so he does it again every so often, rolling forth so Dean can’t breathe, jerking faster, then rolling back to look at his gasping face as he works his cock.
She slams her fist into his vein, a desperate last ditch effort to communicate. It sparks, setting off the gasoline fire, the catalyst that triggers Clint’s orgasm. It gushes, floods with hot and wild jerks as Candi moves chaotically around him for it, and sheer fucking pleasure rolls through Clint’s dick. The first wave of semen mostly lands in the tip of the condom, but some escapes and begins flooding the front of her, trapped by the condom. She thrashes to try and avoid it, but it’s mid-orgasm for Clint and all it does is pull a louder, more desperate groan as his dick responds with enthusiastic approval.
He slams the fleshlight down, Sam stuck to the bottom of is cock head, and COMES in thick, pleasurable rolling throbs. Semen oozes from him and fills the floor of the thing, coating Sam in the process, nearly drowning him in it.
The longer Bucky stays hard, the more his balls swell up and start to fill. It’s tolerable at first, but after hours of what amounts to edging, Steve’s seriously starting to get concerned. He’s got to palm at the walls to keep his chin above water. Pounding on the walls of his prison just seems to cause a fresh new flow of it into the room with him, and he’s been yelling at the top of his lungs begging Bucky to cum him out off and on for hours.
The sensation was startling, a deep and indescribably pleasurable pressure not unlike the unfurling of lust Dean gets when watching porn, and it hits him in his sleep, making him shift and groan, hips pumping into the air a little. His dreams take a turn for the pleasant, but Sam’s nightmare heads in the opposite direction. As Dean shifts, the world around him shakes like an earthquake, sending him slamming into the round wall before him.
Sam, not like that, and it’s all Sam can do to keep going on the hope that Dean will look down again when his wave of pleasure passes. He moves through the cropped hair at Dean’s cock, moves toward the line where pelvis meets stomach, moves away from the leaking head Dean’s rigorously rubbing behind him, and tries not to look.
The world around Bucky gets almost crushing. There hadn’t been much space to begin with, but with Sharon’s walls tightening up on Steve’s dick, with Steve’s dick responding by contracting, throbbing, pulsing with blood, it’s like he’s being buried alive in a flesh coffin. It’s like the cock itself is using Bucky’s body, contracting and squeezing around him to milk out pleasure of the sensation of him being inside it. Over his head, when Steve pulls out for a second a little light streams in - just enough for him to see the slit wink closed again, and then the return of that great force crushing him - the pulse of pleasure it brings, the surge of new precum.
, though, Dean winds up in it just as Sam’s tugging it up the skyscraper length of his legs. His cry of protest goes unheard as his brother’s balls settle over his chest, waist, and legs. He squirms, struggles, but there’s really no moving- the cup does as advertised, and Sam’s junk remains firm. Dean can only be glad that his flaccid dick is a solid inch away from Dean’s face, or he’d be
Steve’s got a hand on his dick the entire way home, like hanging onto it makes it any better. Like it makes up for weeks of being stuck there. As soon as they get in, Steve heads straight for the bedroom and strips. He lifts his soft cock up so his fingers can start unhooking the restraints keeping Bucky there, and when he sets Bucky down on the chin-high dresser he can see nothing but remorse on that massive face.
He sort of didn’t think it through. At two inches tall, no matter how much weight he put into it he barely felt like more than a fingertip, and aggressive grabbing really just felt like gentle stroking, teasing, tingling. He realizes his mistake, in hindsight.
thigh and slams her fist into it a couple times. The first one garners no response, but the second gets a full-thigh twitch and then a new horror - it pushes
The good news, though, was that slipping and sliding and decreasing in size dislodged him pretty effectively from the way he’d been trapped under Dean’s dick. With a little wriggling, he tugged himself out from the rim of the head and pulled himself to his feet, standing in the pocket of space beneath Dean’s hips and above his cock head. The pillow was firm beneath his feet, and he searched the darkness looking for an exit. Miles and miles of flesh were his ceiling, miles and miles of semen stained fabric his floor, and who even knew the threats that lay beyond that?
Castiel’s moans are practically deafening.The sheets add even more to the experience, they eradicate the friction from his own hand and give him a silky-smooth backdrop to this warm and squirming thing he doesn’t even realize he’s holding. He barely even realizes he’s jerking off, most of his brain still offline and refusing to turn back on – he’d just been so fucking
Cas nods, eyes dropping to Dean’s swollen and aching member. Long fingers dip down, skip the foreplay, and wrap right around it. Dean moans his encouragement, and Cas begins to pump slowly.
Two of them drop, their knees buckling, skittering back in terror at a hand that must look to be nearly the size of a house. The man from the bridge, the Captain, remains standing. Defiant, jaw set, wide blue eyes staring up.
There’s a breathy exhale above him and the hands begin to slow, milking out the last droplets of it over Harry’s head. His robes, his hair, his face, they’re all soaked with his godfather’s semen.
He figures stupidly, that he’ll be safe on his own bed - even though the blankets are rumpled and in disarray, and he’s hard to spot sprawled out as he is among the white sheets.
It’s a little bit of a roller coaster as Steve reels his dick upward, and then he’s left staring up at his best friend from waist-height, trying to hang on to velvety-soft skin while pressure and gentle suction pull at him from below.
Deep inside Dean’s dick, Sam’s struggle was fruitless. The relaxing muscles, the downward force, the gentle suctioning throb inside his groin lead Sam to a fleshy wall that he struggled to grip for purchase. It was the wrong choice to make, because it flapped open to a sharp drop into Dean’s sagging, relaxed balls.
phenomenon goes, they really missed a great opportunity,” He muses, stopping her movement but still pinning her effortlessly down with his middle finger.
And this time, he sweeps her around with his fingertips and presses her directly against the head. He doesn’t pull away this time, but instead his fingertips at her back force her entire front against the head of his dick and circle it with her, rubbing her clockwise around the leaking slit.Then up and down. Then they start to force her
“Feels kinda good with you in there, pal, but I guess we’re gonna have to get you out,” until the old alarm clock starts ringing across the room, the little hammer smacking back and forth on the bells, startling him. “Oh hell, I’m late for work. Sorry, buddy, you’re gonna have to sit tight in there for a few hours.”
Not only is he embarrassed, he’s terrified. He knows Bucky can’t even hear him, no matter how loud he calls, not through the walls of flesh and the thunderous sound of his hand sliding up and down slick skin - let alone through his own ragged breathing and muttering. Steve can hear everything around him reverberating with moans and low, rumbling, “God, Steve, you feel so fucking good.”
“This was your decision,” Cas reminded him empathetically, guiding his left hand closer to where his right was working so that Dean was side by side with it- or, sort of. Too small to really be compared, probably.
, jutting up from neatly trimmed pubic hair and cut, defined hips. His sac lay heavy beneath it, round mounds each larger than him as well. They bounce a little with the motion of Dean’s hand, which he can’t help but watch. It’s
Dean realizes rather abruptly what part of Cas is pinning down his thighs; mostly because it gets warmer, firmer, and starts to creep up his thigh toward his pelvis. It pushes itself up between Dean’s legs, thick but still soft enough not to crush his junk, thank
it. Thrusts his own cock up into the soft silicon, rutting against the inside of the toy like he can somehow hit the prostate he sees Bucky driving the head of his toy against over and over.
Something about that little guy taking a beating and getting back up… Something about it never really went away.
“You two are doing a really- really great job, I appreciate this more than you know. I think- what if maybe we leave you like this? No more hunting, just… making me come. I keep you safe, you keep me happy. I think that’s the best strategy.”
In response, Cas’s hips twitch- a barely there in and out of his own fist, grinding Dean into his palm.
"You know how Bucky has really pouty lips? Imagine tiny Steve staring longingly at them as Bucky eats his cereal, wanting nothing more than to disappear along with his breakfast, See the power behind those teeth, feel the squeeze of the esophagus. He’s a super soldier, he’d survive it, but he’s also awkward and doesn’t know how to bring it up. Thankfully, Bucky is observant, and those pouty lips twist up into a smirk..."
Dean let out a sleepy murmur, and shifted his hips. It happened in what felt like slow motion, one moment the world was stable for Sam, and the next it was an earthquake. The slightest movement shook the ground beneath his feet, knocking him onto his back. Dean’s hips shifted upward an inch as he realigned his back, and his cock came soaring forward as a result, wide open and sliding up the length of the pillow where Sam lay. On instinct, Sam kicked out wildly, trying to scurry back. All he accomplished was getting his legs stuck up to the thigh in a slit that closed as quickly and thoughtlessly as it had opened, clamping down on Sam’s lower half.
Some more rolling, chaos too hard to perceive as a thigh shifted on the left and on the right, clamping down more tightly on the pillow between them and then shuffling down so that it pressed nicely against her pubic bone and waist
has his limits and he’s got to admit he doesn’t have it in him for another night of borderline crushing.
A new weight presses down on her from above, enormous and all-encompassing. It’s hot, it’s heavy, and it grinds Natasha face-first into the malleable skin of Clint’s dick. Velvet wrapped steel, now complete with a couple hundred pounds of pressure forcing her against the nerves and just getting worse every time one of those throbs runs through him. She can barely breathe, she’s being crushed straight into his erection, her chest barely manages to rise and fall sandwiched in between these two forces.
When she was younger, it used to give her great dreams. She’d wake up from them and just lazily hump into the pillow, grinding both her sex and her pelvis into it - something about the push against her outer pelvic wall and the contraction of her muscles engaged nerves probably around her g-spot, and she could even bring herself to orgasm through a steadily rougher series of humps and grinds against it.
She can barely hear what any of them are saying anymore, but she sure as hell feels something happening.
He’s got to grip on tight to the imperfections in his chip as it tilts up nearly vertically, just shy of a 90 degree angle. It’s at the top of the bag, at least, so he won’t be buried.
That’s when the running stops. Dean’s right to be suspicious of it, because suddenly it’s not just a pressing weight pushing down on him, but a
Lips close, meaning Bucky’s top lip presses down onto his bottom. As it descends, he sees every uneven bit of texture, every plump piece, every crumb still caught and still larger than him. He sees it coming down on him unrelentingly, sealing together on his left and his right until finally it seals
That’s how Dean sleeps for HOURS, fingers curled around himself, Sam pressed against his radiating heat. Every once and a while Dean’s cock twitches and grows, just a little, just an inch. Half hard on top of him, Sam’s terrified to move in case he makes things worse. Every once and a while Dean’s fingers twitch too, like he’s gripping himself a little more tightly, like he’s dreaming of touching himself.
Except next time, he’s less careful. Next time is intentional, and he’s been waiting for the opportunity ever since the first. Sam disappears, Dean sprawls on the couch on his back watching TV, and Cas changes into a pair of the thinnest boxers he owns.
Steve pauses, circling a hand around himself and around the passenger just beneath the head of his dick. It twitches at the thought. Bucky can’t see the way they’re looking at each other, he can barely really hear while Steve’s hand is gently stroking and manipulating himself – skin on skin and idly crushing him into vein tends to sort of drown the world out.
It takes about four drinks for Clint to start thinking almost entirely with his dick. He’s going a little crazy with it, actually; Natasha’s been rubbing at his slit and hugging his dick and wriggling around along the sweet spot on the underside. Top that off with the fact that there are a pair of perfectly round breasts literally right in front of him from a girl called Candi that’s clearly angling for something and...
It isn’t that, though. It’s just one bicep and one thigh expanding outward by inches and then by feet.
His breath heaves, his muscles are sore, and he’s got to say it’s a really good thing this lifestyle’s prepared him for some hard work, because he’s winded and he’s not even half way. A glance down shows Dean’s lap, legs sprawled apart, disappearing miles away under the dashboard. A glance up gives him an angled view of Dean’s face, the place under his chin, an Adam’s apple bigger than Sam is tall.
For example, the one he just gave Steve while Steve had him in his fist along with his cock, jacking himself off furiously with the knowledge that Bucky’s serum leaves him practically indestructible so Steve’s free to be as rough as he wants as long as it feels good on his cock. He comes with a choked sound, shooting hot all over his own stomach, milking himself through it by grinding Bucky into his sweet spot for several minutes while Bucky obligingly rubs and licks it, sending shivers up Steve’s spine.
His godfather’s hand flies a bit faster, and he sounds distracted when he says, “Give me just a minute, Harry, I’m a bit too far along now to stop. Whatever you need can wait until after I’ve finished, alright?”
She just holds him there, head in and nothing else, muscles tightening and relaxing for long, long seconds. Long enough to hear him beg,
He might have been anyway, if he thought it through. A cup can only mean one thing. Sam puts his earbuds in, and begins to jog.
He licks his lips, hot tongue bigger than Steve is passing over them, wetting them down, and then he presses them down on Steve’s middle. Holds him there in plush softness for a while like he’s trapped in a kiss, feeling little legs kicking against his teeth and hands curling against his lips. He passes his tonge over them again, and this time Steve under it. Licks him like he licks his own lips, then uses his tongue to drag Steve into his mouth proper. Rolls him under hot tongue and keeps him there.
Cas had been stranded on the bathroom counter for a while until one of the brothers passed by. Dean settled in front of the mirror, naked as the day he was born, leaning forward to floss into it and more or less ignoring the tiny angel trying to flag him down. He’s got a busy day, he’s got stuff to focus on, whatever Cas’s problem is can wait until after the hunt.
from his perspective that if it weren’t for his super soldier eyesight they’d start going blurry before he could ever land his eyes on their face.
This whole process takes nearly twenty minutes, and then she notices that the jiggling, bouncing, shaking has stopped and they’re standing still. She can hear the sound of loud conversation, of laughter, of clinking glasses.
doing him some good. He rolls his pelvis forward, nudges into the pleasing pressure of his athletic cup, and resolves to reward himself with some
Feeling the movement is different in here. The bag itself is presumably soaring through space, but it almost has its own gravity at this point. What he’s got to look out for is the way the chips rearrange themselves - tectonic plates shifting, the one he’s on suddenly
And he rolls over to lay deliberately on his stomach – before he settles fully, his hand snakes down to move his cock, to make sure the underside is pressing against the sheets. Gives his hips an experimental roll to make sure everything’s lined up to hump him properly overnight, and then he settles down again.
It’s around this time he can feel the Captain desperately scaling his balls trying to get to her, and he allows it. It feels nice, and there’s nothing he can do anyway.
In the morning, Steve wakes up hard as a rock. His mind is his own again, but just like he hadn’t remembered why Bucky was off his dick overnight, he doesn’t remember putting him back on there.
The first day he spends attached to Steve is a frustrating and boring affair. He spends all of his time more or less hugging the underside of Steve’s dick just beneath the head, and his only mental stimulation comes in the form of walking (which jostles Steve’s entire package), pissing (which results in a hand dipping down, wrapping around his legs, tugging him out, the humiliating experience of watching him pee, the
“Steve,” he warns. Too low for the girl to hear, but thanks to the serum he knows Steve picks it up just fine. “Take me off before you put it in her.”
He shoves himself forward, tumbling down the slick leather of Dean’s jacket and onto the exposed skin of his upper thigh. Dean at some point shifted his jeans down several inches, so where there should have been denim, there was pale skin and sparse hair. Sam gets his bearings and
He strokes his hand forward again, and while it’s inaudible to anyone other than her, she can plainly hear the filthy sound of sticky, wet skin pumping hard cock. At the top of that stroke the slit above her squeezes shut, then slowly opens again as he peels back - sticking to itself a little like dry lips that only reluctantly pry themselves apart again.
The folds above him dip precariously, but Steve’s cock curves toward his stomach so there’s no real chance of penetration. She does, however, settle her wet length over Steve and roll her hips forward, so that she’s dragging every bit of her sex up Steve’s length - and up Bucky’s back, nearly smothering him between the two bodies and absolutely soaking him to the bone. Steve’s cock throbs hard beneath him, slamming him up into labia. He doesn’t get the chance to yell for nearly five minutes, because she keeps gently passing herself back and forth along the underside of Steve’s dick - from the wet sounds he’s hearing presumably they’re making out.
“Beg me not to, Steve,” he gasps, rolling them forward just for an instant and then back again. “Ask me not to do it.”
Bucky’s speechless. Sam’s determined. He’s jumping up and down, screaming so loud his voice tears his throat, and when Steve turns toward the bed finally Bucky can’t help one optimistic second thinking
And, of course, with Pepper. That massive wall that makes up the soft flesh of his left thigh goes a little firm as he engages the muscle, and it presses up against her in a way she knows he probably thinks is gentle but in reality is encroaching on enough force to squeeze her breath from her. Beyond that, he
They sag again, settling on top of his thighs and pushing him snug against the wall of fabric behind him. He doubts Bucky even knows they did that, that’s just an automatic involuntary instinct that comes from sensation. Hell, he doubts Bucky even knows Steve’s thigh-deep under his sack right now. He only has a second to look up.
His voice is more like a sleepy whisper right now, muffled as it is by distance, skin, and pressure. It lacks urgency, and it evokes only a soft hum and a murmur of, “Dean…”
Even before today, Dean’s made it a habit to walk around the bunker in his robe. It’s not a surprise to Sam to see him prowling the place in it, so he doesn’t have a singular reason to think twice - let alone investigate the contents inside of it. It’s made of thick material that muffles all sound, but Castiel largely gave up yelling after the first fifteen minutes.
The good news is that the growing seems to have stopped for the moment. The bad news is that Cas’s arousal hasn’t waned in the slightest over the last half an hour. Dean’s been pressed into the mattress so deeply by Castiel’s rigid erection, the sides of it actually kind of come up around it and ergonomically cushion it to make a pleasant hugging sensation for Cas to fuck into.
That hand detached too quickly, and it became instinct to wrap his arms and legs around it tightly to keep from plummeting headfirst to the floor below - without his grace or angelic strength, it’s questionable whether or not he’d survive the fall.
I saw you’d consider doing HP stuff! I was wondering if you’d considering doing Harry being shrunk and Sirius declaring he’s going to keep his tiny godson safe, by putting him somewhere he won’t get hurt. In his pants. OR if you’re not into that, maybe Ginny being a loving girlfriend keeps Harry close to her in her panties or bra somewhere she’ll be able to feel him at all times? Or both if you want! Love your work!!!
Only once it’s done does he shake Steve out, half a centimeter tall and moaning through his own orgasm in the tidal wave of Bucky’s sperm along the couch.
And quickly before he can allow the hunter to respond, he descends onto the mattress. He’s flush with his victory in an instant, feeling like a predator having caught his pray, feeling a tiny body lined up between his cheeks and partially beneath his balls. He exhales slowly, rolling his shoulders and doing his best to relax into the sensation, quietly palming his cock.
as his whole package jiggles one direction and then another and then back and then the other and then and then and then, never giving Steve enough time to recover. He grabs wildly at skin, scrambles to try and stay above them, gripping and climbing and losing his footing and yelling at the top of his lungs.
that Cas might finally come and get it over with. He never does, though, and they slow down to nearly a stop as Castiel’s dreams and sleep cycles change. At one point his dick, hard as a fucking rock, just settles over Dean’s entire body and sits there unmoving. No reprieve to the pressure, no change to move his own body, crushed into place by rigid dick that throbs periodically against him. That lasts maybe another twenty minutes before Cas starts up again, drenching the sheets and wearing him out.
He glances over his shoulder toward the exit, and he sees the vacancy of freedom through the slowly closing frame of teeth and gums and lips.
Dean’s balls are really stealing the show right now. He abandons the soft fondling of his cock to instead drift his hand lower, cupping and massaging his aching testicles. It just feels so fucking
It isn’t that, though. It’s just one bicep and one thigh expanding outward by inches and then by feet.
when a particularly hearty throb rolls through the dick above him. Dean can practically tell each wave of peaking pleasure by it, by the throb and the tight grip that follows, jerking through the wave of feeling he must be having.
. He’s not sure where they’re going, but he does know Dean won’t take that long to get there. Especially not if he thinks Sam is missing. He’s got to get Dean to
So he grips, grabs on to Bucky’s cock with everything he’s got, squirming against gravity and against lubrication.
She is, it seems, trapped here for the next half an hour  or more - she can hear voices so loud they’re practically thunder overhead, coming from several different points in the room. Deafening in their intent to speak up loud enough to be heard, ironically rendering them incomprehensible to her down here.
Dean, on the other hand… Well, he can’t seem to take his eyes off of what’s going on above him. For the briefest of moments his eyes go from Cas’s cock up, up, up, to his face- and that’s when he realizes blue eyes are staring at him from over the tip of Cas’s dick. Cas stares directly at him as he works himself, jerking off before a tiny Dean like he’s getting off on Dean being stuck down there watching him.
It’s just Bucky loosely cupping and bouncing his balls in his hand experimentally. They haven’t even started yet.
He slips again. He’s gotta be five feet down now, too low to see anything but Steve’s enormous eyes – unfocused, because they can’t see him in there anymore. That doesn’t seem to matter; the stroking gets faster, becomes a sort of
From the end of his tip to the edge of the seat is only about another two inches, followed by a steep, lethal drop to the floor below - and the unfeeling shoes that live there, capable of thoughtlessly breaking her without the owner feeling anything through the soles.
The thing about being in Castiel’s care is that he has totally different definitions of propriety than a human might. The three of them sit on a recliner watching television, with Sam and Dean between Castiel’s enormous thighs and the footrest propped up. It’s peaceful, for a while.
A second later, Cas eases off again, and slowly pulls out. Dean’s hips shift back again, and his cock inches down the entire length of Sam’s body until his head is exposed, and he can breathe again. ‘Thank
Finally, the pressure’s too much. Finally, Sam shoots out of him with a particularly furiously strong burst, and Dean collapses onto Cas, forehead sweating with effort, chest heaving, cock throbbing now with exhaustion, too sensitive for him to even pull out just yet.
He gets about a second or two to see it pressed against his knees and thighs, slit gaping and weeping, before Cas rolls his hips up again and he has to watch it plow over his entire body until it forces his head to the side. It drags all that precum with it, too, constantly smearing it over his skin, keeping him wet and slick.
There’s no denying it, not in the slightest; Sirius is masturbating. Harry’s never felt more humiliated or awkward in his entire life. Somewhere above him is a gruff, rumbling murmur. Before him, his godfather’s cock is suddenly slickened perfectly with some kind of lubricant that allows his hand to pass smoothly up and down, and following it is a thunderous, reverberating mmm.
Lesson officially learned, he goes still. Too little, too late - Steve’s already aroused, extremely asleep, but his body moves on instinct. He humps the mattress beneath him.
He tries, he tries to pull his legs out, tries to ram his fist into the space above his head. Two seconds later, the world shifts again and Dean thinks he’s going to get pulled out like the first time.
Meanwhile, on Bucky’s end of things - the world’s not all that great. He may be small, but the serum’s still there. The one upside to this is it means his shoulders don’t ache and the muscles in his arms don’t get sore, but that’s… the only silver lining to be found. His entire visual range is reduced to just the inches of Steve’s cock; the soft skin directly in front of him, the ridge of cock head directly above, and if he twists his neck far enough in either direction he can maybe sort of see around Steve’s thigh to the fabric of his underwear.
And then there’s a gentle southward rush of blood, making the weight against Bucky go from soft and malleable to semi-firm, a little thicker, a little warmer.
He is not used to whatever this is - it’s heavier, it’s ten times warmer, and it’s only the gentle give or the ergonomic shape of it that straddles Steve’s dick rather than crushing it that keeps him from being pushed past the point of breathing.
A few people run, but the space they clear is so minuscule compared to the apocalyptic event above them it’s not even worth the time. Dean prays for him to stop, but Cas just moans - too small for even prayers, apparently.
A few seconds later, he feels the entire room begin to slowly bounce, rocking and tossing him softly against one wall and then the other as Bucky gently plays with his balls inside his underwear.
The movement of force and pressure against the fabric behind him forced him in further, clean up to his waist. Thank god, the ceiling overhead broke open with flooding light and a massive, descending hand to wrap around the dick holding him.
Bucky breathes heavy, groans, and Steve can feel it reverberating even through his testicles. It’s an overwhelming sight, thick calloused fingers, enormous dick above him, the shaking over top of him that simultaneously crushes him and also arouses him. In spite of himself, Steve finds his own cock hardening beneath Bucky’s sack - and the bouncing stimulates it, leaving him moaning and trying to hump upward in vain.
It’s a long time after puberty that Bucky finds out about Steve’s little condition. About why he’s still a virgin. About why he seems to slink away whenever a pretty girl comes around the corner. One time, he catches Steve eyeing a mouthy brunette and before his eyes Steve drops an entire foot.
What matters is what’s in front of her; there’s a slit as wide around as she is directly over her face; it’s leaking beads of precum that cling to the fleshy head and gently coast down to the ridge, where the droplets drop down stickily onto her chest. It’s
That’s when the fun begins. The guy starts jerking himself nice and slow, not dragging Dean up and down but rather gripping him tight in that one special sweet spot and slowly jerking him and the skin around it, rubbing it out nice and easy, taking his time with an arguably loose hold. Precum slips through the slit above him, rolls down the tip and coats his face and chest. He does his best to spit it out, to squirm and struggle to get a hand to his mouth so he can wipe it away.
Natasha doesn’t know what’s happening, but she can guess. Beneath her under the gently malleable skin she’s smashed into, the hard line of Clint’s cock shifts. It’s minute to him, but it’s enormous to her, driving itself up and down her body, pressing into her front as it greedily rubs off on her. Fucking her into the steely wall behind her. Clint’s fucking humping her into concrete, it feels like. Unabashedly stimulating himself on her tiny body, and based on the pearling precum starting to slip down above her he’s enjoying it way more than just a lap dance.
Steve doesn’t even bother looking down; Bucky can hear the clack of keys and the clicking of a mouse. “Nope. Not right now, buddy, I’m busy. I’ll try to get you out when I’m done if I remember.”
Not until an attractive brunette takes the last remaining few inches of space before him, curls her hand around the same handrail, and relaxes gently into him so that her backside brushes against the undeniably hard line of his erection - and, of course, Dean plastered against it.
It’s been an ordeal, and it isn’t often that Steve Rogers gives up. Lord knows he’s tried with every ounce of gasping, wheezing strength a one hundred pound asthmatic can muster, but coils of hair like wires twist around his ankles, his wrists, even his waist. He’s screamed his lungs hoarse and nearly suffocated himself in the process, and all for naught. At one point a set of fingers came looming in like slow-motion, nails the size of mattresses slamming down into the hair around him and scraping so intensely, so loudly, so rigorously that Steve knows if they’d been over him they’d have ground him into nothing.
He settles on a threadbare mattress and drops his toys between his legs again, but not for idle fun. He takes Wilson (he hates Wilson) in one hand, lifts up his balls, and presses Wilson beneath them. Lets them settle on him experimentally, testing out the feeling.
By the time Bucky pulls them off of him again, his vision is spotting and he’s lightheaded. When he can see again, the first thing he notices is Bucky’s hand wrapped around his cock, absently stroking.
Writing prompt: Giant Steve getting a cock piercing, and the tiny ended up being tied to and wore like an accessory, provide constant stimulation for the giant
Frustrated, outraged, wanting to express her extreme displeasure with the situation she marches up to Tony’s
. Judging on what they knew about the curse, his size was determined by his health. The strenuous nature of what he’d been put through was worse on his cold, and as such, he dwindled from a small two inches to something even tinier. Slipped below an inch, and stopped shrinking at just about half an inch tall.
Bucky tucks himself away, seals Steve in place, and goes on with his saturday morning. Steve doesn’t know the details of it. Voices are so loud they’re distorted past the point of being understandable, the world is deafening, the sights obscured by the weave of fabric that’s just enough to let in light for him to see and not much else.
clean over it, slit sliding along his nose and mouth. Sam rises, and the rubbing relents. He lowers, breathing out, and it resumes. Dean splutters, shoving at it, struggling to keep sweat from his mouth, pushing the intrusive head from his face.
, he just knows that in the span of a couple seconds he’s gone from six to midnight, full-on hard, and his dick just keeps
To stand. To stand, allow his ass cheeks to come together again and firmly settle around him, and know that Dean is completely engulfed in the mass of them. He can vaguely, vaguely feel squirming. His cock goes rigid. He takes a single step, testing - then another. Left cheek slides against him, then settles back again. Right cheek rises and falls. Dean’s still firmly wedged, and he gives his glutes a little flex to clench down on him. Dean starts kicking up a fuss immediately, writhing in response to the tight grip, and Castiel has never been harder in his life.
His knuckles tighten again, lift the cock up a foot, and thrust it back down again two times in quick succession as Sirius finishes shaking.
It tapers off slowly, and he catches his breath as his hand slows down too, gently stroking out the last of the sensation through soaking wet come that erases any friction and makes the lazy jacks glide sweetly.
He walks into Dean’s room careful to keep his eyes above bed-level, calling out gently, “Dean? I need to talk to you.”
He hopes she figures it out soon, because her pussy’s been slowly pulling him in and no amount of flailing seems to help him stay out for long. In fact, pushing against her clit or pulling himself out only makes the flexing muscle spasms stronger.
drags Bucky along with it - until the restraints at his wrists prevent him from moving, at which point the hand continues on without him, gliding over his body, keeping the pressure on his shoulders but still stroking his cock the rest of the way. Same thing on the way down, dragging him about an inch along the underside until his arms are taught and the backs of his fingers continue on their merry way to finish out a satisfying stroke.
In his mind, he’s being soothing and comforting by dragging his hips up and down again. Giving Bucky a reassuring little gift by rubbing himself off. It’s an apology.
He starts walking those bow-legged steps toward his room, heedless of the movement and without stopping to pluck Castiel off his cock. Why bother? It feels kinda nice.
Liquid presses against his feet, blocked by Bucky’s body, holding it back like a dam. Steve’s moaning like a goddamn lunatic as his orgasm builds but can’t release because Bucky’s holding it back, keeping him on edge until it builds up and builds up and builds
In terms of what Bucky’s dealt with so far, this isn’t the worst. The fabric and cushion beneath him is soft, it rises up on either side of him like a hill, and Sam doesn’t crush him with his dick like Steve does. He just sort of absently humps, passing his dick back and forth over Bucky’s body, slow but constant strokes that seem more bent on enjoying the little thing beneath him than rushing to make himself come.
Sirius has a tendency to bark with authority, and it seems to end the argument once and for all. He glares down any interlopers, and they trickle out one by one until only Sirius, Remus, and Dumbledore are left.
Shoving him under there while he’s running becomes sleeping with him under there, too. He’s hard nearly every minute in either case, but he doesn’t actually act on it at first. Not until one day when he steps out of the shower, starts drying off, and sees Steve standing on the counter about waist-height.
She can crane her neck up, though, to look past the crown of his cockhead and hundreds of yards up into the sky where Clint’s chin tilts down in slow motion to look at her. His pupils are enormous, even for this scale, and his lips are parted as ragged breaths pass in and out of them.
As much as he doesn’t want to, he has to swim toward it - kicking and writhing through thick liquid before it drowns him, throwing his arms out to catch himself on the landmass of Steve’s cock so he can exhaustively pull himself out of the swimming pool’s worth of jizz. There, he catches his breath and waits for Steve to pull out.
"Ooh, I have an idea! Dean intentionally (and with consent) traps his mini-angel boyfriend in his pants and goes about his day as normal. They figured that the secrecy would add an extra thrill, and they were right. (bonus if Dean has to do a thing that prevents him from being able to check on Cas.) -- bitty"
They advance, and they don’t stop this time. The tight ring of muscle passes over Bucky’s head, sealing his upper half in, the back of his head coated again with spit as Sam’s tongue circles Steve’s cock head over and over again, catching Bucky in the process. Steve’s dick jolts again,
That would be a terrible time for Sam, but the best blowjob Cas has ever felt. It’s unfortunate that he didn’t notice the hunter in time to save him, unfortunate that he went tumbling from Dean’s shirt onto Cas’s swollen and sticky head.
Lips part slow, and he can hear the sound of the skin unsticking, tacky with saliva. He can hear the almost velcro-like sound of the middle of Bucky’s tongue peeling away from the roof of his mouth, and then he’s soaring through the air toward the light again - then
He got used to it eventually. Started feeling comforted by the weight of half a guy on top of him, bare skin to bare skin, pinning him protectively against the mattress. Puts him out like a light these days, deepest sleep he’s gotten in years.
when Bucky occasionally decides to reach down and give his balls a little attention. Other than that, it’s just gentle swaying.
, leaving him spluttering salty taste out of his mouth. It was a single bead of precum, and it’s the precursor to a hell of a lot more. Cas starts leaking like a fucking tap, bead after bead of it traveling over bulbous head, down the crown, and dripping onto Dean just in time for him to ram himself through it.
The world around him pulses, and he can hear Cas groaning, reverberating through his body. Something about this BJ is different, better than the rest. Something about it feels REALLY GOOD, and his hand fists in Dean’s hair to keep his mouth firmly on Cas’s dick. A sweet, tickling sort of sensation slides down his shaft until it’s on the other side of that bundle of nerves that feels the best, and god- he’s so close but he never wants it to stop.
relents and keeps on slowly coasting inches up until Bucky’s entire body is immersed and all light disappears.
He never comes. This lasts for hours, off and on - he’ll hump for nearly twenty minutes, then go still. He never goes soft again, he stays rock-hard and thumping pulses onto Bucky for another twenty or thirty minutes in between his dreams - then the humping starts up again, the moaning, the leaking, and Bucky swears he gets close to coming at least three times throughout the night.
It’s just... Bucky’s got perfect lips, perfect teeth, a plush pink tongue, and every time Steve sees him toss something into his mouth and start crunching it up he stares a little too hard and gets a little too hot in his face.
Bucky’s careful to hold him deliberately in place as cereal works it’s way to his back teeth, and Bucky chews with his mouth open so Steve can see in vivid daylight the way they gnash and grind cereal to a pulp in any direction. That they could easily do that to him, too. He can’t help the way he rocks his hips into Bucky’s hot, wet tongue.
Before him and rapidly sailing in his direction is a smooth, pink head clearly hard as hell and without a single speck of awareness that it’s chartering a course to line its slit up perfectly with Bucky’s body. By the time Bucky starts yelling again, the condom slams onto its target. It’s got a reservoir tip, but rolled up in those beginning stages it’s almost perfectly taut - not enough to crush him, but enough for only a foot or two of space before a slit the size of a window. Light streams in, filtered, from the clear latex behind him. He does his best to cling to it, but after Steve finishes rolling it down his length, he allows his entire dick to spring upright again.
that rams him breathlessly into the wall behind him. Sam struggles, shoving at the thing, trying to make room. Trying to drag himself
The world tilts down as Bucky bends forward, and Steve gets a view of the drop should his restraints give way. A thousand stories down, and absolutely no way to survive the fall. The world tilts back again and a shadow looms, the waistband of boxers rising up over his head and snapping around the bottom of those abs, sealing him inside.
He spent the first five minutes spinning in circles in his chair. Pepper stood on the table watching him, arms crossed, shaking her head at the absolute irreverence and unmitigated energy of a bored Tony Stark who
like this,” Meg teases in her sardonic sing-song, impossible to tell if she’s being sarcastic or genuine - either way she’s enjoying it. “Itty bitty little dolly, used to be a hunter. Not so scary are you now, huh, Dean?”
It’s like demolition. It’s like watching a skyscraper get quarantined and then ritually exploded, thousands of tons of mass falling in on itself - just to stop abruptly because Bucky’s stopped squeezing his fingers shut.
There’s also no denying she’s not wearing any underwear, and the skirt she’s got on rides up as she settles into place. She wraps her arm around his shoulders, presses her chest against his, and says, “Don’t worry young blood, I’ll make sure you’re comfortable.”
And then the weight on him shifts, lifting up a little at his thighs, cock reeling down his body roughly -- silver lining, it lets him suck in a breath of fresh air.
The thing is, a man can only keep himself from acknowledging that kind of stimulation for so long, and against his will Sam started to get hard. No amount of kicking or flailing was strong enough to get himself out of the hold, there was no pushing back or forward to get away from the pressure, and soon Dean’s rubbing thumb got him hard and aching. Sam’s hands gripped the ridge of Dean’s fingernail, clinging tightly as his head fell back.
It slows down eventually. Calms down. Eases off - but not completely. Little hot zings of aftershock keep coming from his testicles, and when he can finally crack his eyes open to search his come for Steve, Steve’s not in it.
They come down on him again, but this time they grind down on him as Bucky rolls gentle circles over his body. He’s there longer this time. All Steve can see is wrinkled skin, velvety-soft but a couple hundred pounds, melding around him in a way that almost feels intrusive. Intimate, for how they press into every square inch of his figure. The grinding feels like it pushes him inch by painful inch up the counter a little, pushing down so hard any air in his lungs is forced out.
The crotch of his briefs reach their destination. He’s carried up into them until they’re settled on top of him; extremely pliant and wrinkly skin like dough, malleable and drooping around any section he manages to push up with his hands. Pushing at the heavy weight doesn’t seem to accomplish anything, it almost feels more like he’s kneading into the soft flesh than actually moving it in any discernible way.
Bucky pauses here, blood rushing down to his cock, and Steve hears a low, thickly rumbled, “Oh, god.”
The asset doesn’t kill them because he appreciates having something to occupy his time. In between missions when not frozen, he has nothing. The walls of his cell are empty and bare, there is no form of electronic to keep his mind stimulated. No book, no television, nothing.
“Who?” Steve asks, and then, “Oh. Yeah, it doesn’t matter, he feels really good on there no matter what. Ignore him, just suck me off-”
“You can go straight to hell,” Dean rasps out in answer, though there’s a waver there admitting the first traces of uncertainty. He can’t be
Above him, Steve rumbles - Bucky doesn’t know if it’s to him or the girl, but it doesn’t particularly matter. It’s, “Feels so fucking good,” and then his world is moving again, affixed to Steve’s cock as he pushes back into that heat. He’s inside another second or two, not nearly as long, before he’s pulled back out again. Steve pulls out only to just above Bucky’s head so that he gets a burst of fresh air and light, the perspective of two titanic bodies moving what looks like slow motion, and then he’s thrust back into crushing darkness.
He’s expecting freedom after that. Expecting Bucky to slip his fingers in and clean them both off, but instead ticking seconds pass and then the bouncing starts again. Bucky’s already drenched in sweat, his cum doesn’t even register as a dark spot on the fabric. He’s leaving Steve in there with it, covered and disgusting, to go back to work.
By the end of the night Steve fills that condom almost full, and Bucky nearly passes out half a dozen times trying to survive it.
There is no face, nor chest, nor ceiling. There is only one thing completely obstructing all view, unavoidable and impossible to ignore.
"steve being so weak that he gets tangled in buckys pubes and cant get out?? maybe bucky knows hes there and maybe not"
way he’d be of some value in any capacity. If he isn’t capable of performing a job, he can at least perform a service as a toy, or a tool.
The world goes still like that, and Dean begins to sweat. The fabric above him gets moist with his own and with the sweat from Cas’s balls. He can feel the angel’s heartbeat through them, a steady but quick constant pounding. Every once and a while he’ll try in vain to pull his legs out again, and almost like Cas is responding to an absent itch, he
forget about her, he’d shoot off carelessly in a burst of manic energy, and he might not even notice until later if he were to accidentally do something terrible.
“Please, man, I really don’t wanna go in there. Please don’t fuck her with me,” it’s lamented to an unsympathetic dick, which - as though by direct response - tips in another half inch so Bucky’s upper half is surrounded by black and then
“I gotta be honest with you, I’m not seeing the problem,” Sam says, standing a mile high over where Bucky’s been placed on the kitchen table. Steve stands beside him, both of them with their hands on their hips studying him like a specimen. Bucky saw it take Sam over in real time, this subtle red wisp of something pass from Steve’s lips and into Sam’s, a contagious breath that had him shuddering for just a second.
“Bucky, I can’t… We can’t. I’ve never been able to- to come before, I get so small, I just…” But Bucky isn’t stopping still, he’s just working his hips steadily up and down in a delicious friction-y rhythmic drag on Steve’s crotch, milking out the pleasure that keeps centimeters falling off Steve regularly.
"Sam and Dean get shrunk, a worried Cas gets drunk. And Drunk Cas means horny Cas. So, putting one boy near his asshole, and one on his balls, he asks them to help him out."
Steve spills into the girl, down the slit and head of his own cock, and down onto Bucky as well. Not that it matters too much, he drags his hips back and then thrusts them forward hard to drag Bucky through his come. It pulses again.
Sam is engulfed for long, long seconds until his hips roll back that subtle inch, and he sucks down air. Bucky’s forced to cling more tightly, hanging on for dear life lest he wind up in the same place as Sam - squirming fruitlessly underneath them.

Frustration runs through Bucky like a river, and he drives his elbows into the head of Steve’s cock with renewed effort. Plants his feet and does his best to
, and spills hot seed slick down his hand and Dean’s front. He’s got to fight to keep from drowning in it. He’s got to kick and squirm and struggle within the skin to get a hand to his mouth and frantically rub the sperm away. He twists, he smears his face along the skin of the dick beneath him in his struggle against the spilling seed.
. Once again, those hips peel back so that the head of his dick passes down Dean’s front, down between his legs, nearly off the mattress entirely == and then quickly shoves back up again, passing over stomach, chest, face, all the way up to the top of the mattress. Belatedly, Dean realizes he’s had another growth spurt. He knows it, because he can feel rock hard length from head to toe with no reprieve. The mattress must be perfectly aligned under Cas’s pelvis, cushioning his dick to keep it from hitting rough ground.
He pulls back the waistband of his briefs, curls a hand around the base of his cock to point it upward, and there’s half a goddamn person sticking out of it. Bucky, in up to his waist, arms grabbing at the head of his dick while his legs kick and move inside it. Explains the pleasant sensation.
Candi hums her approval, pulling Clint’s other hand up to place it on her chest. From behind her, Stefan clears his throat to say, “I’m going to give you the night. We’ll meet first thing, yeah?”
She spreads her legs a little more, scooping up as much of her pillow between them as she can before closing them again and
Not the case. Cas breathes heavy and slow above him, going boneless, lazily grinding his hips into the couch, and by extension

to do. It means that the wall of cotton-blend behind him may as well be steel, and that steel pushes him face-first into the seam between Bucky’s testicles.
Tony’s an engineer. He works with his hands. His fingers are constantly engaged, always moving, and so probing her quickly is as natural to him as breathing.
He comes silently, a small choked noise, a hot rolling throb that goes from Bucky’s toes all the way up past his head, and then he spills hot and wet down the front of his underwear, and all over Bucky’s body in the process. Those fingers work him through it, smearing him through slickness against his dick, milking out every bit of it and coaxing himself into afterglow.
Since obtaining the angel tablet, Castiel’s had to stay constantly on the move. If he stops for too long - even minutes - it’s likely that one of his brothers or sisters will pick up on his whereabouts and descend upon him to rip the tablet from his body. He’s gotten around this the same way he tends to get around everything - using loopholes.

himself clean and dry - no need to even go to the bathroom to clean himself off. No chance to discover Dean, and firmly assuming that any struggling sensations he feels mean it’s time to jerk off.
Above it, though, he can hear a long, relieved sigh. It continues on for thirty or forty seconds as Sirius empties the entire contents of his bladder before Harry’s eyes, an up close view of it whether he likes it or not.
Outside of this place, Castiel sits on a motel bed squirming. It’s just a little at first, with his brow screwed up in concentration and his fingertips probing absently at his crotch. It’s about
Harry spends two or three minutes utterly dumbfounded here, lying half-under his Godfather’s resting sack, staring up at the head of his dick. Wondering deliriously if he’s allowed to move, if he ought to, and then forcibly reminding himself that this is Sirius, of course he’s allowed to pull himself out from under his balls.
The world goes from a wide open table or a hovering face to high, high walls of blue trouser fabric on her left and her right, coming together in nearly a v behind her.
in come. Her arms flail, struggle to break the surface, but the head of Tony’s dick pushes her back down again to keep her under while the third and fourth rounds surge forth from his balls and onto her.
“Stop calling me that,” The asset mutters, and even as quietly as he says it, it still reverberates through all of their ears like rumbling thunder, godlike, almost ear-splittingly loud.
brief instant the entire weight above him lifts off. Dean feels two seconds of fleeting hope before it
at the head of Clint’s dick, trying to steer it away from her face - it works, but not necessarily the way she intended. Another twitch, this time a heartier throb, and it swells against her, grinding up her face as hard as it can before it has to start curving up, climbing up her body like a vine and dragging her with it a little until she’s pinned just beneath the head against the wall at her back.
This time, he gets back a long minute of breathy silence and twitching, shaking hips that stop only right above Bucky’s head.
Sam switches legs. Rolls, rolls, rolls slowly forward and his nuts follow suit, roll, roll, roll over Dean’s top half and
When he meets Dean’s eye his hand goes faster, lips parting, eyebrows knitting like he’s in pain. He must be close, and breathlessly he asks, “DEAN, MAY I FINISH ON YOU-”
annoying, he’s taken up Pepper’s least favorite. He descends a massive arm down onto the desk on either side of her, either surrounding her with forearms like a pen or propping an elbow up on either side so that her entire point of view becomes a massive wall of ceiling, chest, arm, and- at the very top- a massive face peering down at her with scrutinizing brown eyes that observe her every move. Every part of her. There’s no avoiding the awareness of it, and he shrugs off her discomfort in that same casual way he
Tony makes it about fifteen minutes through the feeling of tiny hands stroking and caressing his dick under the table before he knows he’s gonna come. All eyes are still strictly devoted to the presentation at the end of the conference room, so he feels brave enough to sneak a hand down around himself again. He inches back just a little from the table, enough that he can peak down between his legs and see his cock pointed at Pepper’s tiny form.
as Dean’s fist pounds the desk on accident, struggling to choke down a noise as heat and lightning uncurl, and as he comes hot, wet, thick into his underwear and all over the tiny angel that strokes him through it - the entire way, all the way through to afterglow.
It’s a cock head. It glides smoothly forth like a predator, clearing an insane amount of distance in almost no time, and for a startling second Sam thinks it’s going to crush him against the back wall.
He can’t hear Steve yelling, Steve knows he can’t. It’s impossible. He pounds his fist on that flap, scrambles and tugs at it wildly to try and get
, which might’ve worked if it didn’t send a surge of blood to Steve’s dick from the pleasurable feeling he causes. It makes the whole thing twitch, lifting off of Steve’s stomach and slapping back against it again. He loses any progress he may have made.
He can hear the groaning, though; it seems to be coming from everywhere around him, source-less, reverberating the guttural pleasure Steve’s feeling from this.
all of a sudden, crushing Steve into the couch as Bucky grinds on him and spills hot, hard, wet over the fabric of his briefs. His chest rises and falls quickly as he strokes out through the afterglow, absently muttering, “God this was such a good fucking idea.”
He says it breathlessly, jerking his hand a little faster, staring straight down at Steve as he does so.
It earns him some looks. He offers a watery, distracted smile and clears his throat. Shifts in his seat. Cas can feel his hips flex and gently rock forward into air. The twitching grows more frequent, the flesh beneath him hard enough to pound nails, the head so swollen and engorged with blood it almost seems angry, and he redoubles his efforts.
“Buck…” He gasps uncertainly, when the pressure starts to be just a little too much. Bucky holds him there, right on the edge of what he can stand, and his tongue slides in sopping wet along Steve’s face, his side his arms.
So a story where Cas starts growing to giant size in his sleep. Initially he and dean were sharing the bed til dean got shoved out by his growing boyfriend, now face to face with his boyfriends giant crotch. Dean yells but cas stays asleep, murmuring in pleasure as something (someone) is rubbed pleasurably between his crotch and the wall as he continues to expand
--” He wheezes out, writhing desperately. The cock on top of him responds appreciatively, filling out and flushing, forcing itself up past Dean’s stomach and finally settling fully-hard on his ribs, just a few inches beneath Dean’s chin. Jesus, it’s covering him thigh to chin, it’s
It’s fruitless. The weight comes bearing down and he’s got just enough foresight to roll to the ground, flat on his back to keep his spine from getting snapped.
in an up and down rhythm. It’s only when they start to pull up tight and drag Dean with them that he realizes what’s happening.
Climax hits, and it hits so hard he goes white-out for a second, head tipped back, hand furiously working himself through it,
He slams his book closed, drags it up to his chest, and snatches his keys off the table. “Tell you what, I’m just gonna… head to the library for a couple of hours. You… jerk off or whatever it is angels do, get it out of your system, and then
“Hey, pal, what are you doing up there?” His too-loud voice sounds confused, amused, and gives no time for Bucky to answer before thick fingers descend against his will to grip him tightly by the stomach.
down harder than before, grinding her into pillow, shoving pelvis into her face and clit into her chest. That’s not the end of the sequence - from there, thighs and glutes tighten to tilt that pelvis
An hour passes like this, an eternity, stillness punctuated by grinding, until something starts to change.
?” He gasps, brow screwed up in incredulous confusion, green eyes wide and uncomprehending in the face of what has to have been the best orgasm he’s ever had. Which is saying something, considering how things felt last night.
At the very, very limits of his vision, he can see the cut of Bucky’s chin. It’s pointed up and out, it gives way to the curve of a cheekbone, and that’s it. He can’t see eyes, nose, nothing. Bucky doesn’t even so much as glance down.
Today is the day of mistakes, evidently, because that’s when Sam begins to do squats. As he drops, that cock that was a safe inch from his face nudges downward, slams into it with unrelenting force and
Bucky tosses him to one side of his mouth with ease, shoves him between his back teeth with a forceful tongue, and slowly presses down. Steve’s trapped between molars, hard white enamel above and below him as Bucky bites down a little harder with every passing second.
, and as he fights to breathe, he drags Dean’s orgasm out longer than it’s ever been. He’s gripping Cas’s hips tightly as he throws his head back, his vision’s going white and he’s got no discernible rhythm as his hips stutter, rocking desperately into Cas’s hole as he cums, as he just
. Dean can feel his heartbeat, can feel him twitch, and then with a voice like rumbling thunder, another soft, “Dean.”
, Buck-” under his breath as Barnes idly nudges just the tip in and out like some recreation of the teasing Steve does to him when they’re intimate.
his work out. It’s doing wonders for his libido, it must be the adrenaline that’s getting him all worked up, it
“Yeah, I think I wanna feel you in there,” he decides, and the pad of his thumb pushes down, shoving Bucky in the rest of the way. His vision is obscured on most sides by darkness, leaving only a tunnel of light at the slit of Steve’s cock and the blurry sight of his face beyond it, staring down into his hole. He can see Steve’s pupils blown wide, his lips parted in what looks like pain, but he can tell by the sudden constricting throbs that it’s anything but.
The steady, sea-sick tide of back and forth subtly rocking him becomes faster, incomprehensibly shaking his entire being.
The only warning he got before this particular exercise was a smirk, a green-eyed glint, and a cheerful, “Better hold on tight, Wingless.”
He moans again softly, gently releasing his balls and bouncing them a little to confirm - yeah, still in there.
Bucky takes his first step, and all that progress is almost gone in an instant. It feels like a swooping rush, the weight above him lessens just a little, and then it
“God, sweetheart, thank you so much. I knew you’d wanna make me feel good. Treat me real nice all day, alright? Then tonight we’ll get you out.”
They both have time to catch their breath. Any hopes Steve had that all if it had been dirty talk to get himself off are promptly shattered when Bucky hoarsely says, “Grab onto them,” and starts to stand.
They press down softly onto her stomach, and they cut off her view of everything beneath his shoulders - but his eyes and his smirk are still clearly visible as her only sky. He’s leaned in
“So I’m thinking… how ‘bout one more day, huh? You got plenty to eat in there I bet, you got nothing else to do, you could keep me company. Kinda feels fair, right? I’m working, you’re making me feel good while I work.
It isn’t all that incredibly difficult really, considering the new space sitting opens up at the front of Sirius’s underwear. He grabs the fabric, grounds his elbows into the seat, then slowly pulls himself out from under them. A movement catches his eye - just one small bob in the cock above him, and it stills again. There’s some loud creaking, harry can see the skin on either side of Sirius’s private parts get a little farther away – apparently spreading his legs a bit – and then everything settles back down again.
Cas sleeps like a god damn octopus. It took Dean a lot of getting used to, given his previously solitary lifestyle. Six or eight months of sleepless nights while an angel plastered himself half on top of Dean, arm over his chest, leg slipping between Dean’s. Thank god he wasn’t still at angel strength, or Dean never would have been able to shrug him off.
There’s one hard, solid thump of blood with so much intensity it actually cracks his back under the pressure - and then a
The fingers of his right hand twitch, lifting the dick and then nudging it down into a sort of soft slap. At least, to Castiel’s perspective it was just a gentle tap, to Dean the full weight of it smacked him down in an instant. All three or four times his length, two or three times his girth, thrust down onto already sore muscles and knocking him flat on his back beneath the thing. He grunts out of sheer soreness, stiffness, and weakly pushes at it trying to get it off him.
It makes him stop abruptly mid-spin, gravity carrying the chair forward another inch or two with the flex of his legs until he swivels back and promptly looms in, filling her entire world with his upper body again.
It seems like the farther Dean walks, the harder he has to grip Dean’s cock to keep from falling. The harder he grips, the better the pressure feels to Dean - almost like a hand softly squeezing him. He hums his approval, then sets out half-hard through the bunker toward the kitchen to make coffee.
like something’s stimulating it. He’s breathless as he walks, quick and jerking steps toward the nearest restroom, hand dipping to discreetly grind into his erection over his jeans. He’s got no idea he’s grinding
Upon the minimalist metal desk within his cell are three naked figures, each less than two inches tall, each wide-eyed and craning their necks up, up, up at him. He recognizes them, of course he does. The man who kicked him, the redheaded woman he’s met more than once, and the man on the bridge who seemed so familiar.
“M’gonna push you in, Stevie, you better fight,” He teases, lowering an enormous thumb to hover over Steve’s head. He can feel, distantly, the increase in sudden squirming and it brings another moan to his lips. His thumb dips just enough to ruffle Steve’s hair, and then backs off again. “God, you feel so good Steve. Christ, I’m gonna push you in, you ready? Keep squirming like that in there, okay?”
Muffled from above, he hears a deep, “Night, pal,” which is followed by a little squeeze from fingers that push him into soft cock flesh.
The kicker, the real kicker, is when he feels the angel start gently moving around on his over-sensitive flesh to start lapping up and cleaning the mess he made. After all, this would hardly work if Dean had to go through his entire day in cum-soaked pants.
He didn’t thrust this time, instead he did everything he could to postpone orgasm, but since he couldn’t get a hand down between the pad of Dean’s thumb and grip the base to keep himself steady. No amount of unsexy thinking, no amount of straining, no amount of groaning and panting and begging could free him from the torturous pleasure of the
Before long Steve’s only a foot tall, and all he can see is Bucky’s stomach as the heaving weight of him pushes him into the couch, stealing his breath. He feels like a child, and pushing against Bucky’s stomach and rocking hips accomplishes almost nothing. There’s no running from the constant friction that works his dick, no running from the way Bucky hovers over him, humping him mercilessly into the couch cushions. Bucky grips the arm of the couch above him, lets his legs stretch out along the couch, and soon enough it’s just Bucky’s pelvis that’s on top of him entirely like he himself is a pillow meant only to support Bucky’s hips while he works himself.
…” The sound of his own name from a voice that big is unsettling, but it has to mean Bucky’s spotted him, right? He doesn’t know, he can’t see Bucky’s face over the curve of his dick.
“Cas–” he croaks, voice sleepy and strained from the weight on his chest. He wriggles his shoulders trying to push up, to no avail. “
Sam’s still lodged there. Cum is everywhere around him, struggling to get past him, coating him as he stoppers things like a plug, as he makes things about a hundred times more intense just by
He catches his breath, his cock slowly softening and his eyes peering into his slit. He can see Bucky’s face among the last bits of semen gently leaking out.
The sky is nothing but miles of crotch, wrinkly balls that lead way to the curve of a shaft where the sun ought to be. Hands so bafflingly large that a single fingerprint could snuff the city from existence. They can’t even see the person behind the cock, and a collective city’s screaming isn’t even a blip on the radar for whatever god or monster it is - practically continent sized.
Maybe it’s just that Harry’s so starved for this kind of overt male authority figure that he can’t find it in himself to argue, and when Sirius closes his underwear around Harry again he’s left feeling incredibly conflicted. Burning with embarrassment and confusion, oddly comforted by being so close and so vigilantly looked after by his Godfather, frightened at his situation and... Really, he cannot overstate how embarrassing it is to be in here.
The only potential drawback is the utter boredom, but he’s found a loophole around that, too. Dean, admittedly, was not very fond of his decision. He tried to position it as an appeal, a request, pointing out that at his current size he’s of no use to Sam or anyone else, and at least
And then those fingers open up, too quick for him to grab to keep from plummeting. He drops through the air into the dark maw from twenty feet up. Smacks onto steeply sloping cotton, and goes tumbling end over end down, down, down until he reaches the bottom. His side is what stops him, cushioned by the blockade of soft and fleshy skin. They’re testicles, both of them individually three times bigger than he is. They move like they’re alive, hugging up a little toward Bucky’s body so that he slips down on his back another couple feet.
Sure enough, right on the mark, he can hear the thunder that probably comes at the end of the world. A sound so loud and so deep his eardrums can’t properly perceive it. It’s followed by a rush of air, and then his eyes lift up to the metallic paper walls above him. One of them bends in with a sound so loud it’s like standing at the bottom of Niagara falls. Four more fresh dents appear in the walls around him, then
After several minutes of steadfast jerking, Bucky finally feels the pleasant, tingling, squirming sensation beneath his balls. His rhythm falters and his chin tips down, down, down, until blue eyes lock onto Steve’s gaze.
The closer Cas is to coming, the farther down his shaft Sam finds himself falling until his soaking feet hit some sort of flap. It closes around his foot and he squirms, kicks, fights-
Steve doesn’t think they even land on him before the other hand slowly closes the exit above him, sealing him in and allowing the fabric-elastic to firmly settle back into place. They’re snug, they hug his privates because that’s what a jock strap is
As soon as Cas is sure Dean can take him, he shifts the rest of the way onto the bed and slides his knees between Dean’s splayed legs. A gentle nudge later, and the head of his cock breaches. He slides slowly, agonizingly slowly until he’s fully sheathed, and collapses down onto his boyfriend with a muffled groan. The added weight and pressure force Dean’s hips forward, and his cock slides up Sam’s face, clears his head by an inch or two and
“Dean- Dean stop, Dean, you’re gonna- I’m gonna- Ffffuck-” He moaned, giving in finally to the unrelenting, tortorously slow rhythm that refused to speed up when he wanted it to. It was all he could do to thrust his hips against Dean’s thumb, that slow pace driving him step by step, little by little toward the finish line. He could feel himself just about to cross it, and the steady
For Sam, the voices are distorted. They’re deep and low, they rumble through the bodies above him, but he can’t even concentrate on understanding them with the barrage of hot cock fucking over him thrust after relentless thrust. Dean’s

He does alright while Bucky walks around the apartment, a lift-tud, lift-thud boob-boom-boom jostling shaking nightmare.
And the annoying, uncomfortable realization that there’s almost nothing she can do if he makes that decision regardless.
Her hands shoot down immediately around that middle finger, pushing fruitlessly at her rumbled clothes caught up under his nail.
until finally, finally, Steve’s hand wraps tight around the top half of his cock, encasing Bucky in darkness, jerking him back and forth fast and hard and then a shuddering
What wakes him up is when Cas sleeping pulls him in more, unconsciously trying to settle on top of him like he does every night. Unfortunately, that means actually reeling Dean underneath his hulking mass so that his clavical settles on Dean’s head and Dean’s hips wind up pulled between Cas’s legs.
“Oh– sorry about that, did I get a bit on you?” He asks, chest rising and falling as he stares down. “I did say lookout, but I suppose it’s a bit difficult to dodge down there.”
He can’t stop it. Bucky keeps bouncing, shaking, forcing him to fall and slam into the flap, then tumble through it.
twitches against her, presumably with a fresh pulse of blood from the pleasure of feeling it. She can also loosely feel his heartbeat through it, and the way that it’s picking up a little.
Steve’s cock jolts, and Sharon’s hips line up overhead. They descend rapidly, and the slippery passage beneath Bucky’s feet slickens up with  a sudden trickle of precum that coaxes itself out behind his back. He dips another six or so inches, tugged down by a rolling pulse of muscle that seems almost intent on dragging him in. He’s down up to his chest, nearly his collarbone when Sharon descends enough that Steve’s tip makes contact with her folds. They roll all over the ceiling above him, they press down with unrelenting force, pushing his head and his shoulders down, down, down while Steve softly teases himself on her pussy.
Steve’s hand moves in his peripheral vision, gliding through space and landing at the back of Sam’s head to gently encourage him.
he understands, and he stares in horror at the pulsing head above him, already beading with precum. “No, no, nononono- Dean-
His fingers dip back into the confines of his boxers. Without the trousers blocking out all light, Dean gets full vision of the area around him streaming in through crosshatched fabric. He sees looming fingers dive in and start touching the head of a cock that curves up now that it’s only trapped by soft cotton. He sees them dip down and tries to scramble, but he doesn’t manage it before they’re pressing into his back and smashing him into semi-loose skin at the base of a dick, rubbing him in circles around a thick vein, and an echoing moan follows it.
sends him sliding down, down, down beneath Bucky’s sack. He has to turn his head to one side to even be able to breathe, and that’s about all he manages. They’re everywhere. They’re everything, they consume his ceiling and his walls. They press down on his entire body, heavy as hell, pulling him in, slamming down onto his body over and over and over again. There’s no reprieve, no quarter, he has to push and knead them like a fucking kitten to keep skin out of his mouth.
He drags himself back down again and braces at her entrance. Bucky watches it get closer to his head by slowly creeping inches, just to have it pull away again and another roll up between her lips. Even this is a brutal amount of pressure, and he’s still sore as hell from the day before.
around the bundle of nerves right under his cockhead. No more sliding Steve up and down, no, he grips and jerks so tightly Steve’s smashed into skin and is rigorously shaken along the same two or three inches of space. From tip to sensitive nerves and back again, rough unforgiving tugs of his cock.
The tip of it sweeps just low enough that it passes over his face, soaks his chest, and then Bucky slides him all the way back down to the base again. And then back up, then back down, loosely jacking himself through a daydream or fantasy. “
Bucky’s always had a thing for Steve, he thinks, is the problem. Ever since they were in grade school and they first met. Steve was there, an entire foot shorter than everyone else in his class, standing up to a bully who was a whole head
Sam kicking up a ruckus wasn’t doing any favors. Dean hummed again, sleep fading for the second time that night as his morning wood grew inch by steady inch. He yawned, shifted beneath the arm Cas had thrown over his waist. His legs stretched out, arms soared over his head, and he cracked his back with a lazy pop. Taking his weight off of his limbs meant his cock slammed back down into the pillow, leaving Sam gripping tightly and screaming a sound too small for either of them to hear. Light began to pour in as he soared through the air, and he could see distant, blurry, colorful shapes. He couldn’t tell what they were, everything was too far away save for the skin stretching out in either direction like a mountain- hell, he couldn’t even make out his brother’s face anymore. It was just cock, miles of it, a distant thicket of hair, and nothing else. He was so fucking small.
He realizes suddenly that Sirius is sitting down in either the kitchen or dining room, having conversation with a few people with his godson just settled in front of his cock and balls. Nobody asks about him, Sirius doesn’t reach for him, he’s just left there with Sirius’s dick to keep him company.
Castiel can feel her startlement, he purses his lips apologetically and braces himself for an apology - but when she turns around to eye the man behind her, she seems incredibly pleased by what she finds. She turns back toward the front without a word, but steps her right foot back to more firmly push herself against his crotch.
“Don’t worry, Harry, we’ll get you put right,” Sirius’s near deafening voice reassures him, peeling him slowly away from his chest. His face is absolutely massive; Remus and Dumbledore join him in leaning over a bit to observe him, positively blotting out the sky with their bodies. “Here you are, I’m going to put you somewhere you won’t get hurt while we figure this out.”
Another growth spurt hits, and Castiel’s head presses against one wall while his feet hit the other. He grumbles sleepily, stretching his body out and absently ramming a heel through the wall. It cracks plaster, breaks drywall, and the whole damn thing gets punched out. Cas apparently doesn’t notice, he just ducks his head and shifts himself so that the bed -- and Dean -- are tugged more firmly downward beneath his hips.
They make it, though, is all that matters - standing on top of a mattress staring out at the world at ½ inch tall is an alien and unsettling experience. Everything is magnified, all sensations are greater, and it means that their entire bodies feel the tremor of the bed when Steve’s footsteps become audible. It’s a tiny little earthquake, a gentle shaking of their feet the closer Steve comes until he’s in the room proper, so large the two of them can only really stop and stare for a long minute.
based on the way he seems to aims his dick, seems to seek Sam out, seems to pointedly pass his most sensitive places over Sam’s chest and face with every slick nudge. He can hear bitten off moans that seemed to tear into sound exactly when he starts to squirm to get away again, and it doesn’t take him long to realize
Bucky teases himself with the head of it, clear enough that it’s almost transparent, just shy of frosted glass. Gets so hard he’s got to start palming himself, murmuring a soft, “
Cas doesn’t protest. He’s on his back and ready to go in seconds, and Dean groans as he braces the head of his dick at the entrance.
Castiel isn’t thrilled that Sam chose to wander away during his session. Once Dean is set aside to recover, Cas is content to reach down past his now-soft cock, between powerful thighs, and pluck up Sam who struggles in his grip.
, settled there in the driver’s seat. He’s huge, surreal, larger than life, so big Sam’s vision can’t comprehend all of him at once. It goes blurry at the edges like a mountain, like looking up toward the top of a skyscraper.
He shifts back a second later, curling his hand around his dick once again to start jerking off properly. It shakes the weight on Steve, lifting up off his chest enough to breathe during the upstroke and then crushing back down again on the downstroke.
Barnes bolts for him, clearing those minimal feet of distance to grope around beneath Steve’s folds to try and find an arm. Steve hums above them, and his eyes tear away from Sam to look straight up.
“Maybe I can get you inside it, Stevie. Bet you’d feel real good in there, squirming around trying to fight your way out. Bet I could get you all the way in before I came,” He murmurs, shifting to wrap Steve’s arms and legs around his shaft. Lining Steve’s little erection up so that as Bucky jerks himself off, Steve’s getting friction from the underside of his hot, slick cock.
The ceiling overhead slopes at an angle toward Sirius’s waist, and that avenue is closed as well. There’s just Harry, his little bit of standing room in front of it all, and Sirius’s cock and balls.
He can feel Bucky’s heartbeat though the vein on the underside, picking up and hammering fast. He can feel rolling throbs start to take hold, can feel it when Barnes starts to toe the line right before orgasm, desperate and scrambling and chasing it.
Bucky’s run lasts half an hour, and by the time he’s done he’s rock hard at the feeling of those squirming little kneads between his balls.
different, just that he’s already chasing the line, already tingling and twitching, fire riding through his veins and pleasure ripping through his cock.
“Yeah, I mean… sure, that’s great and all, but after last night… Man, I’m sore from head to toe,” Dean admitted weakly, shifting back in the angel’s palm, trying to look at
Sometimes she’ll roll from her side to her stomach in her sleep. This results in her thigh pillow sort of spreading her legs a little, getting tucked up under her belly and pressing rather nicely into everything from the top of her pelvis down her sex and between her thighs.
It gets tighter. His hand goes steely, tightens up around himself, speeds up, but Dean’s caught in the curve of a knuckle without escape. He’s shaken, absolutely
He thought this was a joke at first, and his annoyed yell of, “Dean, this isn’t funny-” went entirely unacknowledged as Dean took his first step. It booms through the hunter’s leg, impact juggling up his thigh and then gently to his cock, barely shaking and bouncing the thing upon which Cas is clinging for dear life. His arms and legs grip on more tightly, clamping down in a vice around a dick that twitches beneath it.
“How about you let me come right now, but I don’t let you out just yet. God, it just feels so fucking
And just as abruptly he’s up, the weight’s lifted and Steve’s lifted shortly after, just over eight inches so Bucky can grab him like nothing around the waist. He’s been this small before, but only once- secretly, in the privacy of his own room as a teenager, jerking off and hoping beyond hope he could come before he got any smaller.
gushing, so he has to constantly move and squirm to keep from drowning in it. The pressure around him, the shaking-stroking-squeezing, becomes too fast for him to even comprehend. The light at the end of the tunnel is distant, nearly entirely blocked by precum, It’s too dark to tell how deep he’s fallen in Steve’s cock.
Shortly after, a massive hand looms, shadow visible from the light that filters in through the weave of his trousers, and it grips down on both Steve and Bucky’s junk. He bounces it, wiggles it, readjusts himself, probing fingers smashing his face deeper into the velvety soft skin of Bucky’s cock. A reprimand.
The sudden rumbling of a zipper precedes the gaping hole that manifests above him, courtesy of Steve shucking his boxers down a few inches to allow his dick to spring up. Above him he can’t see Steve’s face, or the ceiling, or anything so comforting. Above him is pink, soaking wet flesh. The biggest pussy he’s ever seen in his entire goddamn life, hovering like a fucking UFO above him.
It’s fortunate that Sam doesn’t notice something’s off right then and there, he just reaches out to crank up whatever tape Dean left in and starts staring out the window in his own moosey world. Which is… a freaking miracle, because it feels like Cas has wrapped his arms around every bit of what he could reach, straddled him with his legs, and has begin inching his way up it toward the head.
By the second hour, Dean is obediently compliant and Cas has the opportunity to sit back in the plastic seat and softly sigh, relaxing into the window and staring out while he gets his cock played with. He doesn’t necessarily expect Dean’s full energy at all times, but every 40 or so minutes he’ll dip his head and softly order, “Make me come, Dean.”
What he’s not counting on is the force of the swallow, the way it drags him backward, the way he lands plastered to the bottom of the tip of Bucky’s tongue.
“No, Dean, no, no, no-“ The car shuts off despite his protests, and suddenly, the world is moving. Dean’s body is everywhere around him, shifting through the air, leaning and rocking and slamming the door. The motion turns rhythmic, the ride, thud, ride, thud, ride, thud of walking. With every thud, every fallen footstep, the world jerks a little, dislodging him from his place. The final straw is when Dean brings his hands up, the size of a school bus, and shoves them down into his pocket. It jerks the entire coat with him, and Sam loses his grasp.
Quite suddenly, she can see it wrinkle, then become framed by more pink, loose skin and a row of knuckles right behind it pushing it forward. As they squeeze up toward the head, they force out a little more semen in a gush. They pull back slow, dragging the excess skin away and leaving the underside of it visible instead; one pulsing, thick vein that jerks within the confines of Tony’s fist.
against the balls above him to try and stay above them, to try and stay on the upper curve of his sack instead of being swept beneath it.
He’s all the way hard when they finally arrive. He waits for Sam to get out first, then hurriedly shoots a hand down into his boxers to arrange his dick - and Cas - to a more upright-position so that the belt holds him in place and keeps him from sticking straight out. After that it’s a matter of buttoning his blazer, which stretches down just past his erection to help mask it.
at the same time, roughly jerking himself off through the clothes and inadvertently finding incredible sensation at all the places Bucky’s stimulating him just by being there.
And then they move, writhing and rising and falling like a ship at sea, tossing in a jiggling bouncing sway that he’s helpless to fight. Something rolls them in a circular motion, too deliberate to be anything but a hand manipulating them. They separate again at the behest of two probing fingers that dig in around Steve and pinch-squeeze-grab him through rough cotton. Bucky inadvertently saves him, pulling him out from between his balls because he’s correcting a weird little itch.
The world from Dean’s perspective is a hell of a lot less carefree. His stomach filled with a swooping dread the second he saw perfectly round globes coming down, down, down. Plaid, thin boxer briefs descended like in slow motion and he tried, he really did. Tried to run, heading for the front of the couch, thinking if he could just dive between those massive hairy thighs…
He drags back down, he braces again, he breaches just an inch… and pulls out  again. He can hear the girl moan above him, he can see her flex and try to pull. Steve pushes in that inch and then
gently up and down as Cas’s fingers wrap around himself from outside of his pants and gently jostle his package, feeling it out. Probing fingers massage into his hardening length, kneading it onto a furious Dean who scrambles all the harder to shove the thing off of him.
Steve can hear him through the fabric, and he slams his fist to indicate a hell no as best he can. He can see Bucky’s stomach muscles contract in tight, though, and fingertips appear again form nowhere to grind him into the place he’d just hit approvingly.
her hips a little harder into it. Little micro-humps with her clit grinding up and down, and up and down, and up and down.
Stops inside her, with her come and his come all flooding down Bucky’s form, and Steve’s cock his only companion twitching gently on top of him.
he got here, but he can tell he must’ve been gone at least throughout the night if Dean’s this worried.
After that hour’s up, the atmosphere changes. With no warning, gravity starts tugging him to the right, one massive hip rearing up overhead like a tidal wave, Steve’s dick and balls bounce and jostle and move around - then lift, and then all of it falls onto him at once. Not just Steve’s cock now, which pins him to the sheets, but the weight of his hips and the flesh above it. He almost can’t breathe, and it’s in this panic that he starts writhing against the underside of Steve’s cock. Kicking, trying to get his attention to wake him up.
Sam saw the hand. He saw it enter his field of vision, saw it loom in slowly, and it wrapped around the flesh beneath him. Things began to shift with the harsh sound of skin on skin, and as Dean’s hand slowly made it to the top of his cock, the slit around him closed
When he finally tears his eyes away, it’s to glance up Dean’s chest at his face. He’s staring, not at the porn on the television, but at his own dick. Biting his lip as he watches his own hand trace over it, a low moan rumbling through the back of his throat and filling his ears.
Steve winces, eyes ducking down for a long moment before they lift again to appeal pleadingly to Bucky.
Sam lays there winded, chest heaving, eyes pinpricking with blackness. He’d nearly passed out under the crushing weight of what must have been Dean barely scratching an itch, barely
“Really?” she calls, and it makes his lips twitch up higher, his eyes sparking. That dangerous game of flirting he always tries to play with her is now spinning out of control, and it’s as though he’s taking her rebukes as a challenge or as encouragement to get progressively more bold.
They begin to walk again, Harry grabs onto the balls before him to ride them, and they enter a new place with new chatter. He can hear voices that would be deafening if it weren’t for the insulation of Sirius’s clothes and body, and he’s absurdly grateful for his massive godfather protecting him from the deafening cacophony without even realizing it.
The stillness is broken suddenly, with a mile of flesh dragging up and up and up his body while Steve pulls him out. All the way, until it’s just the head of his dick again, and Bucky’s flooded with cold and air and light and vision. He takes this opportunity to yell, “OFF, OFF NOW-”
Prompt: Giant Steve repeatedly slamming his dick on the table, with the tiny underneath it, as his dick slowly gets harder and harder with the stimulation underneath
Steve can feel Bucky’s dick start to twitch. Precum oozes down over the top of him, and above him Bucky gets vocal, moaning his name, groaning, thrusting into his own hand.
the more “vanilla” partner,” and he does those tiny god damn air quotes up at him and everything. Dean pulls a disgusted face, mumbling under his breath about needing to get Cas the hell away from the internet.
At the end of the day, Castiel has to change buses. Dean is not permitted to leave his underwear at that stop, or the next – or for the foreseeable future, so long as his existence in them makes the rides more pleasurable. He spends the time Castiel walks down underneath his balls, he spends the time Castiel sits gently rubbing delightful feeling into him, and when he gets hungry - well, there’s an abundance for him to eat, if he works for it.
Steve’s fucking sick of it soon enough, and commits every ounce of his super soldier strength into squirming, pushing, writhing, anything and everything he can to get Bucky’s attention. It pulls a full-on
“Huh,” Dean says, then lifts his eyes back to flossing. “I’ll get you off in a minute, just hold your horses.”
With no small amount of searing anger, she reaches out both hands to start rubbing them against the head of his dick of her own volition.
Dean doesn’t seem to notice or care. He continues, idly stroking it and Sam over his softening cock.
They do it for him by themselves when he works, hauling boxes over head, jumping up onto a plank, hopping off a ladder - anything that gets him moving gets that zing straight into him, and he spends the entire day at least half hard.
hits just as come starts streaking out of his cock and striping over Bucky’s everything. His eyes, his mouth, his chest, his entire body just
But it hasn’t been that bad in a decade or so, Steve’s stayed more or less at five feet tall on account of his asthma. Bucky can’t help but wonder how big he might’ve been at full health, at least another foot and another hundred pounds of muscle, he’d wager.
they grab. Fingertips press him face first into the head of his brother’s cock, then shift, shake, drag until he’s upright and pinned roughly to the unforgiving denim of Dean’s jeans at his back by the sheer weight and force of an erection five times bigger than he is.
into his boxer briefs seemingly without a second thought, pulling them up snug against his body while he stands to walk to the bathroom. Bucky’s never been in here before, almost can’t fathom what’s happening at first - a pair of heavy balls at his back, flacid cock pinning him to them, neck bent a little against the fabric of the underwear creating a sort of hammock behind his head, and the entire assembly jiggling back and forth as thunderous footsteps sound on either side of him.
He tumbles down, down, down until his back hits something hard, and then he’s rolling at an angle down a steep hill, shrouded suddenly in the dark, somewhere warm and black and on top of something soft.
The world angles back up to level again, and Harry gets a two or three second glimpse of Sirius’s face. It’s the backdrop to his hand and his cock, the far closer environment, but all the same he can see the absent look Sirius shoots down as he tucks himself back into his pants right over Harry’s head.
Things slow down. The pressure eases off. Steve keeps stroking himself self-indulgently through the after-shocks, irreverent of Bucky’s condition, rolling his hips up into his own hand a few more times before it falls away.
The tongue flattens out again, sealing him in, sandwiched between muscle and cock as it lathes, twirling and rubbing around him and the sensitive spot on Steve’s dick that he’s attached to.
, fingertips pressing into his shoulder blades and his spine so hard they’re practically crushing. They make it to about mid-shaft before they start pressing him in again, rubbing out circles
But the experience isn’t over, and Steve watches another chip pass over his head like a UFO, soaring slow motion into the cavern behind him.
, before he even realizes what’s happening, Dean’s hand is off his cock and tugging his underwear back up.
“i really don’t think you’re gonna make it out before I come, Buck. I’m about to start jerkin’ harder and you just keep slipping. I’m sorry, buddy, but I think you’re gonna fall in my cock.” The flesh around him pulses hard in approval, and Steve’s thumb starts circling him again. “Can’t believe you wound up in it right before I started doing this. Probably couldn’t have picked a worse time to be in there.”
The wall opens, a sudden vacuum that sucks him down as sperm surges up past him. He’s drawn into the empty space beneath, and the wall closes up again.
"While Sam's in his pocket, Dean is doing something sexual; masturbating, out at a strip club, etc. How it all ends doesn't really matter. Like I said, this is more of a direct request than a prompt, and I'm REALLY sorry if you don't do those or these messages seem really rude. I can't write, and I'd love to read one story that caters to that prompt because it's a Macro!Wincest fantasy of mine. I love your writing so I thought maybe you'd be up for it? If you're not, no harm done!!"
“See what?” he croaks, and she only smiles coyly before dragging his hand up to place it deliberately on her breast. He swallows hard, hand moving automatically to gently squeeze and massage her tit. He gently hefts the weight of it, rolls it in his palm, and he can feel the first tiny damp patch starting up from precum gathering at the tip of his dick.
This ain’t part of what they agreed on. Bucky’s never been quite so thoughtless, quite so careless or dismissive of Steve’s autonomy before. They’ve been getting gradually more fast and loose when they play, but abandoning him in his own sack without being able to hear Steve screaming through his flesh is a new low.
All that jolting is a chaotic mess for Bucky, who’d been sound asleep right until Steve snapped himself out of bed and started jostling him all around with his panicked, thoughtless moving.
The wizarding world, he supposes, is far less concerned with things like incest — let alone a non-blood relative. It’s also far more open about sex, with wizards and witches having relations with any number of people or creatures. That, he supposes, may be why nobody’s batting an eye about being kept with his Godfather’s cock inside his underwear. Nobody except Harry, who couldn’t have even fathomed this would happen, nor prepare for the next two days of life up close and personal with what Sirius does with and to his privates regardless of Harry’s presence in them.
Pepper’s world begins to shake. Walking is a rhythm that disrupts her tiny room with mini earthquakes, they knock her off her feet over and over again until she resigns herself to sitting down in a small puddle of warm semen, doing her best not to get seasick or overheat from the sweltering body heat coming from all around her. To herself, she mutters an annoyed, “Just hurry up and get me out of here.”
He does not hurry up. He can’t, in fact, because he’s dragged to a lab where six geeks need him to solve something for them, and he’s plunked down into a chair - his balls sing at the feeling, and he thinks
They slide under the waistband of Dean’s boxers and wrap around his soft cock, his brother sandwiched in between it and the insides of his knuckles. He’s clean at least, overpoweringly smelling like soap, thick soft cock moulding against his tiny body even though it weighs what feels like a couple hundred pounds.
They’re still in unmoving for a long minute - at least from their perspective. Even without pulling out the world is still organic and pulsing for Bucky. Her walls clamp down and go soft, clamp down and go soft, and in response Steve’s cock thumps with pleasure inside her. It’s like they’re speaking a fucking language, and every word grips Bucky so tight he can’t breathe.
thing she wants to do is give him the satisfaction of a good little twinge of pleasure through his pants, so in her last possible act of defiance she goes completely stone-still.
By the time it’s finished brewing, Dean’s gone from six to midnight - fully erect and curving up toward his belly instead of town toward the floor. This is good and bad - on the one hand, the curve of it takes some of the strain off of Castiel’s arms, and he much prefers
a v, because now that she’s down here it’s very, very clear where his interest was going. The outline of him is visibly hard at the top of the left leg of his snug suit pants, reaching nearly down to the edge of the seat where he’s perched on it rather than settled back.
As though Bucky can hear him, he goes faster. Harder. Doubles down, grips tight, and comes with a tremendous gushing of hot wetness and rolling throbs, ones that he shoves Steve into with every pulse, rubbing him in a way that almost feels deliberate on that glorious fucking spot.
He humms absently and settles back into the couch until he’s comfortable, sprawled out, wriggling a little so Dean’s a bit further in. He’s breathless in seconds, rock hard shortly thereafter, and palming himself over his boxer shorts.
“Buck…” He says meekly, like an apology- or maybe like a request to stop, but Bucky disregards it in favor of shifting atop Steve, pinning his four-foot body down by straddling Steve’s hips with his own and ducking in to seal their lips together again. Beneath him, he can feel Steve’s cock stirring, twitching-
I've only seen like nine episodes of supernatural, so I'm mostly only familiar with the characters via fanfiction and don't know much about Jo or Meg... but could you write something where one of them has a Winchester bro stuck allll the way inside? -- bitty
He’s got enough room to stand up at least, to stretch his legs and not actually be touching any of the flesh before him. Granted it’s less than a foot away, but knowing he doesn’t actually have to be pressed against it all day is a relief. He’s just… Stuck looking at it, really. Keeping it company, because the fabric clings to Sirius’s thighs and spans up on either side with no exit. Not that he really thinks he ought to yet.
And then his entire body turns, irreverent to the shockwaves it puts Castiel through, and he hears only, “Sorry man, I’m late, no time. Better hang on.”
The next upward pass has Steve caught in the curve of knuckles, which leave the boxers entirely as Barnes stuffs his hands beneath the waist. All too soon Steve finds himself pressed to skin, soft velvety skin that covers utter hardness. Bucky grips himself loosely, enough that his cock slides up and down Steve’s front like he’s being fucked.
” and on instinct alone, Bucky shoots his left hand down to grab and squeeze at his balls. The ceiling above Steve crumples a little, blocking access to his escape hatch, right before orgasm
“Holy jesus-“ he muttered, hand dropping away, head bowing over the table as he breathed. Eyes opened slowly as he took in the mess in his jeans, so wet a damp patch seeped through the denim, and he groaned softly. Yeah, no, he was so going to have to wash those before Sam came back.
Steve doesn’t know that, and he scrambles at his chance - pushes, pulls, grabs at the walls in a way that has Bucky moaning in his sleep. It’s just that he’s face down, and his scrotum’s at a bad angle, and Steve’s all twisted around from it - so when orgasm strikes his sleeping best friend, it does so suddenly and without preamble. It gushes from some place over Steve’s head, forced up over him while Bucky’s balls tighten and seize, throwing him off his footing and slamming himself hard down onto the ground beneath him.
And that’s the only warning he gets before Bucky starts walking out of the bathroom. The world passes by in a blur of color he only catches out of his peripherals. Every step sends a tremor to the flesh he’s hanging onto, and his grip becomes an absolute death grip.
He likes it. He likes looking down from his full height, staring straight down his chest at the table, at his half-hard dick in his hands, lifting it up to see the breathless thing underneath it and then bringing his dick back down onto it in a little jerk. He likes the feeling of the thing under him reacting to it, the way it cushions his cock as it lands, the little twinge of pleasure at each slap.
A hand works up and down in ways that seem slow motion to them, sliding up miles of dick and then back down again, clearing so much space it’s almost hard to understand.
From his place in the curve of Castiel’s fingers he doesn’t have much else to look at. Straight ahead is neatly groomed pubic hair, giving way to a smooth stomach and the flat plane of abs. To the right, the fuzzy outline of furniture so far away they’re like the fading ridgelines of distant mountains.
When it reels back and the light filters in again, Bucky looks up to see the wide plane of a lower lip stretching around the head of Steve’s dick, and the it starts advancing toward him. Everything him seizes up with fear, but it stops about an inch above his head to reel back.
Castiel, as he is wont to do, gets impatient with Dean and leans forward the sparse two or three inch gap between himself and Dean’s stomach to angrily pound his tiny fists - only to have Dean pull back just a half an inch on accident. Castiel overbalances, loses his footing, and plummets - only catching himself on the head of Dean’s heavy cock, gripping onto it for dear life.
Squirming beneath his fingers was, evidently, an equally awful idea. Struggling to pull himself out from them only resulted in them curling around him and holding on tight, eradicating any hope for escape.
He had a spike of fear for a second that they wouldn’t stop rolling, that the weight would just keep mounting, but instead they settle still and only a little heavy on his torso. Sort of like having a person lay on top of him – the same body heat, a similar weight distribution, but the actual sensation is wildly different. It’s one firm bit surrounded by a ton of otherwise loose and movable skin, and it’s utter dead weight on top of him most of the time. They will periodically remind Harry that they’re part of a living body by hugging up a bit toward Sirius’s body, or by sagging down a bit again in that involuntary thoughtless way testicles typically do.
It’s been hours, it feels like, since Dean’s been trapped inside Jo’s underwear. She seems to go from walking to sitting - and that’s particularly rough, the way it pulls the fabric taught against her and melds him into her folds. He’s been pressed up against her labia so tight he almost couldn’t breath, and no amount of squirming seemed to get her attention.
It’s the same story again tonight, with Bucky’s balls full to the goddamn brim and the world shaking furiously around him as he jacks and jacks and jacks himself to the feeling of Steve inside of him.
Dean is permitted to rest after that, and he gently tucks the hunter between his flaccid member and his balls to enjoy the warmth and pressure of him when he sits again.
He’s gotta get out from under them. He has to. Instead of pushing, he opts to try and drag himself out. He reaches up as high as his arms will allow, grabs on tight to folds of skin, and
Something feels nicer about that now than it has before, and so Steve does it again, relishing in the soft lick of heat up his spine and into his dick which quickly pumps up to half hard. His hand dips down to absently massage his balls and, by complete accident, catch Bucky in the curve of his finger at the top knuckle joint.
Just as abruptly, his thighs part - and then Pepper sees those two massive hands descend beneath the table to
“Jo…” He starts, a desperate plea, a warning. As though she hears him (but she doesn’t) her finger begins to work faster, and an enormous feminine moan reverberates all around him. “Jo… Jo, don’t you come on me- Jo, I’m down here, Jo- please-”
exploring the cramped area he’s in. They don’t pull him from his place between cock and balls, not yet, in fact they dip around him and start massaging balls, pressing them up and rolling them so that they practically consume Dean within the sagging skin. They smash him into cock, seal him in between the two places, they erase any space and air and movement in teasing, absent rhythm.
“Bucky…” It’s a soft plea, one he’s not even sure Bucky hears. He expects fingers to reach in and pluck him back out again any second now.
If he has business to attend to, if he’s got a long train ride, if he’s got a meeting, Bucky’s there for it - and Steve’s gotten into this habit of absently nudging him through his pants. He’ll shift his legs into a wide and comfortable spread, absently adjust himself so his dick’s pointed up and laying across his belly rather than hanging down, then poke Bucky until he starts moving around. Gets Steve hard without fail, and he suspects the guy’s only doing it because he’s bored. Bucky’s become his default ‘feel good’ entertainment, his absent pleasure to make the world feel nicer.
He steps back just an inch so he can furiously fuck his fist, filthily jerking it and aiming it down at Bucky’s red, angry skin. A long, low, needy moan escapes Steve right before he
, god damn it, squirm- right there, you’re hitting my fucking-- Oh god, if you don’t make me come I’m gonna crush you, you understand?
down into him and grinding him back and forth against the surface of Bucky’s molar. It’s wet, there are long strings of saliva that cascade off of it as it moves, working and shoving Steve out of his tiny divot.
It passes over her head, and immense pressure bears down on her shoulders, her back, her hips, her legs, her everything as it swallows both her and Clint’s dick whole. There’s a thunderous groan outside, a massive jerk and pulse on the fact cock she’s wrapped around, and a corresponding lockdown-knead of muscle and barely-giving flesh behind her.
. Dean can feel his heartbeat, can feel him twitch, and then with a voice like rumbling thunder, another soft, “Dean.”
His face seemed to slacken for a second, and when he looked down again it’s with that same cavalier expression one might wear if they were a little amused by something but otherwise completely unconcerned. “When you texted me I thought it was gonna be about saving somebody from something, but I’m pretty sure you’re using this thing right.”
when he pushes at it. Something tickles the back of his neck and his ear, he swats at it and catches it, hand curling around it and feeling out the texture to try and blindly figure out what it is. It’s rope-like, wirey,
These steps were experimental, but judging by the slow movement of blood southward Dean is pleased by his results.
There’s a sudden rush of gravity that Steve belatedly realizes is Bucky sitting, and there’s no time to move even slightly before the weight of them comes down on him again, pinning him to the chair from feet to chest. Bucky rolls his hips experimentally, shifting forward just an inch or two so his balls roll over Steve’s face and bury him completely.
The sounds are distorted, louder and lower than usual, echoing like a cave, but one is pretty much impossible not to distinguish. It’s the high pitched sound of a woman moaning, biting out a gasp. There’s a rhythmic, slick slapping sound somewhere much closer, and Sam bleats incredulously.
He plants himself inside of Bucky’s favorite brand of chips while Bucky’s away at the gym, because he
In answer, Steve slaps his palm against the wall hoping to convey his frustration. All it earns is another
The balls above his head lift off of him, then slowly roll back down over his face again. He squirms, and they lift off. He catches his breath, and Cas shifts his hips back until the entire top half of Dean’s waist is beneath them.
So he doesn’t, and there’s a long, concerned pause where he waits to see if their agreed-upon safe-”word” happens: tiny teeth sinking into his flesh. They tested it the night before, the sensation’s akin to a very uncomfortable
Hey this is the anon that ask this prompt. "Maybe you can write about Steve masturbating with Sam and Bucky shrunken and getting caught up in it?" I meant it as Steve is unaware of them and they're accidentally at the wrong place at the wrong time trying to get his attention. Sorry, English is not my first language.
Dean groans, finds a sweet spot, a particularly good angle that he’s never found before in this thing. “Damn, baby, whatever that is, that’s amazing…”
All the while, without a hint of any of this going on above the table, he talks with a steady voice that she
It all changes one night after they both head back to their apartment after the bar, a bottle of whiskey in one hand that they pass back and forth until they’re both hammered and staggering in the doorway together. They collapse onto the couch laughing, Bucky leaning heavy on Steve, Steve looking up at him with glassy eyes and parted lips, and for a second they seem… so close. A foot away maybe, probably less. Close enough that he can feel Steve exhale onto his lips, can smell the alcohol and cotton candy on it.
It’s been a while since they’ve had any time. It’s always some case, some mission, some war, and Castiel resolves not to let this opportunity go awry. Carefully, in the dark, he strips away his coat and his suit. His shoes are tucked away in a corner, and with a single touch of his hand, his boyfriend is also naked- and still completely unconscious. Waking a sleeping Winchester is a precarious thing indeed, unless one knows the right way to handle it. Waking Dean up with sex? Always a sure-fire good idea. He moves across the room silently, bracing a knee on the mattress and reaching up to tug a free pillow down from the head of the bed.
late for work. Cursing under his breath, he slings on pants and a shirt that are rumpled and unpressed, tugging on one shoe and then the other before bolting out the door toward the supermarket where he runs the register.
, adding a whole new sensation to the mix. His cock never even gets the chance to go soft, he barely even flags a little after the orgasm.
shaking the massive shaft beneath him. It nearly made him motion sick at first, this constant forward momentum, this thrust of just his best friend
In all actuality, what she’s grinding her clit and pelvic mound into is a pinned, struggling Maria Hill.
Loud, reverberating thumps shake the world that he’ll later realize are footsteps. He sees clear ridges, soft silicon swirls and rings, and an opening to the tunnel at the very end. Shortly thereafter, dark fleshy-looking masses wrap around the tunnel and then the world shakes, throwing him back against the far wall.
beneath his feet that propels him back up Steve’s shaft and into a pool of sodden latex, a blanket pressing down on him, trying to do its best to bury him in the flood of cum that threatens to drown him. What little he can make out outside of that are kneading walls of flesh, pink and grinding and gripping anything they can greedily.
They move of their own accord, pulling up a little around him. They take him with them, swallowing him between them and surrounding him in a cocoon of elastic skin.
He’s settled back on the couch, legs propped up on the coffee table, television on, and Steve in his new home beneath Bucky’s balls. They settled on him heavily when Bucky sat down, and he’s done absolutely nothing to aid that. He can feel little limbs thrashing, pushing, inadvertently massaging his testicles in a fight to keep them off of his chest and out of his mouth. He likes that.
seem to me movement. It’s a weird sensation, a sort of twitching that comes from higher up in the jacket, like he’s being shaken.
“Huh,” he murmurs, releasing is dick to settle on his stomach again. “Sorry, man, I really thought that would work. I tried my best. Guess you’re on your own.”
And then from somewhere around him, above him, everywhere, he hears an absent, “Hold on tight down there, buddy, I’m not stopping if you slip.”
Steve doesn’t wake up until it’s too late, and when he does he’s just a couple inches tall on the couch cushion. Too small for Bucky to notice before his perfect ass descends through the air and settles heavily
Suddenly, very abruptly, the sound of footsteps and the jiggling of a door handle invade the room. In a rough and unexpected
“No. Tony, don’t. Do not. Don’t you dare-” She warns, her voice stern, and it’s like deja vu because she’s
The redhead is next. He traces her body with his tongue, brings her in between his lips and prods her with the tip of it to try and taste her. Licks his lips and drags her into his mouth, rolling her in saliva. He can feel her squirm, and knows his idea for her is going to be good.
Another disembodied pelvis encroaches in his territory, pressing up against him and grinding him into Bucky’s pubic mound. As distorted as voices are, it doesn’t take a genius to recognize a moan. Minutes later the world shifts, the girl’s hand disappears, and Steve stops being vertical. Bucky lays down meaning so does Steve, and he stares up, up, up at what would probably be a gorgeous pussy if it weren’t so goddamn alien at this scale.
Cas started to “forget” how hard he was jerking off with Dean sandwiched in between his hand and his cock, which was hot as hell in the beginning until that grip got more and more crushing, until Cas started moaning so loud he couldn’t even hear Dean calling out to him, until he felt every single twitch and pulse of blood during Cas’s orgasm, every throb pushed the last of his air out of his lungs and he nearly passed out.
“Jesus- Buck, I am so sorry, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know what that was, There was something in my head–”
weight, coupled with the movement, is enough to get him shaken awake. He tries to flail on instinct, but his arms are pinned down by one left bicep and Castiel’s entire right side. Sleepy confusion lasts two or three seconds -- long enough for another growth spurt to hit, stretching over Dean so that he’s stuck under Cas from sternum to knee. Castiel’s legs are more than off the bed now, hell, his knees are resting on the floor. Dean’s got no idea how in the hell
it, and soon enough it isn’t flaccid anymore. Pants get shoved down and soon Steve is exposed to the world again, but he wishes he weren’t when he realizes what’s happening.
“Hey,” Sam says raspy-throated, absently gripping Steve’s dick and kneading Bucky into it. “You ever heard of cock warming?”
“Cas--” he croaks, voice sleepy and strained from the weight on his chest. He wriggles his shoulders trying to push up, to no avail. “
behind him. He’s lucky not to get squashed, but not as lucky as he could be. Bucky’s heavy balls settle like a crushing weight on his chest, covering him from shoulders to toes and smashing him immovably into the couch.
back down on top of him with the weight of gravity. He notices those probing digits right before it happens again, the fabric beneath him and the flesh above him shaking and bouncing brutally, jostling him against them and then burying him into them.
Evidently that promise gets forgotten two weeks later when Steve finally secures that date he’d been talking about.
face, and leans forward to just smoosh her lips against his face in a kiss. He splutters, pushes at her plush lower lip, but she doesn’t seem to care. When she pulls back, he hears a door slam shut almost deafeningly. “You might wanna watch it, kid. At your size I might just eat you up.”
The light widens even farther, peeling down, down, down, as Sirius pulls his cock out and over the opening. Harry takes a few moments to squint, and then realizes what’s happening. Over a couple of feet of bunched up fabric, beneath the wide set of knuckles precariously close to Harry’s head, past the round head of a cock Harry can just see the profile of, he spots the background. It’s the loo.
It’d be all the worse if Steve knew Bucky knew he was there. That he’d been dreaming about this whole thing for weeks, that he set it up, and that he paid the girl to ride him just so he could curl up and watch Steve stare up at his dick the whole time.
As Dean stared up, movement in his peripheral caught his attention. Over to his left, Cas’s hand began working himself. Already half hard and rapidly growing, jerking steadily beside him like he was supposed to
It’s heavy, it’s as big as he is, so it’s sort of like a person falling and landing on top of him from a few feet up. Nothing the serum in his blood can’t handle, barely even hurts, it’s just
It feels good. Knowing Steve’s down there, feeling him squirm around under Bucky’s balls, knowing he’s smothered beneath them and there’s nothing he can do about it. Bucky’s dick starts filling up in no time, further eradicating the space and steepening the slope behind Steve.
They rolled him over, spun him around, poked and squeezed naked Sam until he felt battered and bruised, and after minutes that seemed like hours, they finally settled with him loosely in their grasp, his back pressed against a forefinger and middle finger, a thumb pushed up between his legs, the pad of the thumb spanning from his thigh to his chest.
“Sit tight, buddy,” is the only warning Bucky gives before the world starts rushing up around him. Above him -- so damn far above him he has to crane his neck back -- he stares up at Bucky’s face. It’s enormous, it’s a mile up and his eyes are so large it almost feels like it’s impossible to make eye contact with them. Like he’s looking into a pupil but instead of connecting he’s just seeing the black while Bucky’s seeing all of him at one time.
Another growth spurt hits, and Castiel’s head presses against one wall while his feet hit the other. He grumbles sleepily, stretching his body out and absently ramming a heel through the wall. It cracks plaster, breaks drywall, and the whole damn thing gets punched out. Cas apparently doesn’t notice, he just ducks his head and shifts himself so that the bed – and Dean – are tugged more firmly downward beneath his hips.
There is no gun to be found, though, and despite flicking his eyes over several feet of the room around him, he can’t seem to pin down where he is. It’s bizarrely familiar, the texture of this floor. Soft but sturdy and unyielding, like laminate or…
Steve hums unperturbed, his hand venturing down to curl around his dick and Bucky, giving it a thoughtful stroke. “I was, I really was, but damn I’m glad I didn’t. Buck, you feel
, don’t get him wrong, but it’s a little disconcerting having no idea what’s pressing a little into the slit of his cock – no matter that it’s sort of turning him on.
finish biting, but Steve’s made himself so small that even with his teeth really and properly shut they don’t crush him into nothing. He has one second to experience being pinned between upper and lower molar, the platform he’d been on cracked beyond repair, the enamel grinders around him merciless.
And he rolls his hips into his fist again, squeezing the air out of Bucky’s lungs every time he pushes into that tight ring. He slows down again, breath going short, cock angry-red and  pulsing hard.
He’s got the Pym particles, a custom suit, he’s got the whole damn thing planned out. It’s perfect, it’s safe beyond all measure. Two backup fail-safe options just on the off chance that for whatever reason he can’t zap himself out of it once he’s done.
it happens, a heavy throb, a hitch in Dean’s moaning, a pointed thrust over Sam’s face through the slickness of it, a pull back, a gush- three, four times as seed spills out of him, slow and pointed nudges to drag out his orgasm.
Frankly, it’s starting to feel like Bucky is just synonymous with dick to Steve. Like he belongs there, and what effects Steve’s cock just effects Bucky by default.
Upon the screen, a pair of breasts bounce up and down as a woman takes it from behind. That combined with the constant stimulation is all it takes, and an angel gets an erection.
Steve gently releases his cock, half hard so that it’s propped up by the muscles of his barely-reclining stomach. “I got stuff to do, I’m sure you can figure it out.”
start to hurt; it’s twice as big now, twice as thick around, heavier with blood, and Steve’s jerking it down onto him like a hammer, absolutely battering him with the underside of his cock.
It’s survival instinct that has him thrashing, an animal part of his brain forgetting that he’s secured into place and convinced for a second Sam is about to eat him.
“The hell are you doing in there?” He asks, amusement in his voice and his features as he stares down at his dick.
Just the little thing on his kitchen table, who he tries out something new on almost daily. Today he’d been walking naked through the apartment, spotted the little guy, and turned over in his head not for the first time that even his
, he fucking humps and humps for what feels like eternity. He must not be awake enough or close enough to spill over, it’s just minute after ticking minute of back and forth and back and forth, friction-dragging himself over Dean’s body, rolling his pelvis into an entire soaking wet king sized mattress.
Bucky lifts off again. Steve sucks in a breath, pushing up onto one elbow and staring up in disbelief.
He picks up speed once and a while, fucking him with a quick rhythm that makes Dean think – actually start to
again. Minutes of this pass, a flawless rhythm of Steve jerking and smacking him with his cock, little moans escaping his throat until finally the last brutal
With a sigh, her finger retreats and her waistband snaps back into place. She doesn’t change, she doesn’t take them off, she just leaves him trapped there in her soaked panties.
