Dean wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, Charlie bent down with her arms wrapped around him, his face buried against her shoulder. It was long enough that Charlie winced when she straightened up and her back popped loudly, and there was a sizable wet patch on the shoulder of her shirt. “Sorry,” Dean muttered.
“Yeah? What d’you got, kid?” Dean asked. He tried to make his tone sound unaffected, but was pretty sure he failed. Jack’s smile didn’t give anything away, though.
Watched the Other Dean look from my brother to the hallway and back again. As. Climbed the stairs behind Dena, I thought that was it.
Sam pulled back, smile wide and eyes as bright as young as the days before—before everything in their lives had gone to shit. “Has it? Feels like I just got here.”
She only left him alone sparingly that day. Alone in the bathroom, splashing water on his face and half expecting to see an angel in the mirror when he opened his eyes, was the first time Dean thought about praying to Cas. He wouldn’t hear him, Dean knew that. Cas was in the Empty. No angel radio there. Still, he almost did. What would he even say? I’m sorry? Fuck you for leaving?
“I don’t want it,” Dean snapped. “Sam wanted it. Sam should have a normal life. He should be here. I should’ve died in that fucking barn—Not him!”
The thought wasn’t a fair one, he knew. Sam missed Cas, and Jack missed him, but it wasn’t the same.
Charlie put a finger to her lips, waving for Dean to move out of the room as she and Stevie left the boys, and joined him in the hallway.
He heard soft footsteps, then the scrape of the chair behind him. Charlie’s arms wrapped around his shoulders from behind, and he put a hand over hers. As soon as she adjusted her grip so that her fingers wrapped around his, the tears he’d been forcing back poured from his eyes. His chest racked with sobs he’d spent too long forcing down with stubbornness and alcohol. He tightened his grip on her hand, tugging wordlessly at it until she got the hint and moved around in front of him so he could hug her properly.
Sam’s hands fell away from Dean’s arms, and he felt himself stumble a little as he tried to catch his balance. To catch his breath.
“Hang—fuck,” Dean tried to call out to her, but his throat felt like sandpaper, and his own voice sounded like a sledgehammer inside his head. He stumbled a little, trying to get to the stairs, but the pounding on the door, the pounding in his head, her yelling—it was too goddamn much. He picked up an empty bottle and threw it at the door. Even hungover, his aim was dead on.
If she heard him puking up the toast and the last week’s worth of alcohol in his system, she had the grace not to say anything when he emerged.
“Ours,” Dean corrected him without thinking. He felt his cheeks flush, and determinedly did not look at Cas to see him reaction, though he felt the Archangel squeeze his hand gently in response.
The day Jack woke up, he disappeared almost immediately, leaving behind Sam and Eileen worried, and Dean cursing under his breath. He had hoped to talk to Jack. To find out if he…If the Empty might like him better than Chuck. If he could do anything to bring Cas back. But he left.
“Because Michael liked them,” she said, her gaze softening. “I did things that he liked, that he would’ve done, if he was still around. I did things for him for a while, until I remembered how to do things for me.” She shrugged, smile widening a little. “Eventually I realized that he knew I hated cigars, and cheap beer. And he would want me to do things I liked. Now I do things for me, and occasionally I’ll smoke a cigar in his memory. I drink better beer now, though.”
“I thought the Empty couldn’t come to earth unless it was summoned,” Jack said, looking curiously at Dean. His eyes shifted to Cas.
“Never claimed to be,” Charlie said, offering a bright smile. “You could do with something besides cars to take up your time. You’re not hunting anymore—“
When he pried his eyes open though, the pounding wasn’t just inside his head. And it was accompanied by a voice. Dean sat up, shoving an empty whiskey bottle that he’d somehow ended up using for a pillow, out of the way and clambered to his feet. It took him a few minutes to separate the voice from the pounding in his head and the pounding on the door, but he recognized the voice as soon as he could distinguish it.
Dean was on the tail end of a late night shift, riding shotgun in the ambulance while his partner, a younger guy with about a decade more experience named Jonathan, drove them back towards the hospital. Dean’s phone pinged with a new text and he pulled it out of his pocket.
“I’m trying to roll balls of cookie dough so we can get these things in the oven. I want homemade chocolate chip cookies yesterday, so help me,” Charlie said forcefully. Dean cracked a smile and copied her movements, dusting his hands in flour, then scooping some dough into his hands and rolling it into a ball before placing it on the baking sheet.
“One more job before we pack it in,” Dean told Jonathan, already tracking the GPS location on Eileen’s phone. “Left up here.”
The Other Sam and Dean, the ones of this world though—they seem to just go. Not necessarily with a direction or a plan. They just go. It sounds too much like everything can go wrong at a moment’s notice. But then, it seems some things go right too. Or at least, more right than they did for Dean and I.
“Dean, stop,” Sam said, exasperation clear in his tone. Dean stopped moving towards the door, though his back was still to his brother, hand clenching the beer bottle so tight his knuckles were turning white. “It’s okay. You and Cas. You deserve to be happy, just like I am with Eileen.” Dean didn’t respond, he wasn’t sure how to. After a moment, Sam laughed a little, and Dean turned around to shoot a glare at him. Sam only held a hand up in innocence. “Sorry, I just. I’m surprised I didn’t figure it out sooner.”
"Dean?" he asked, immediately realizing something was wrong. Dean's chest was heaving and he was sure he'd heard a groan just as he was shaken awake. "Are you okay?" he asked, bolting up quickly in panic.
"Oh thanks!" Gabriel perked up at the chance to talk about his cooking again.  "It's a blend of spices.  Rosemary, thyme, sage, black pepper, salt, garlic, basil, and just a touch of oregano."
Pensively, the doctor stared at him, long enough to make him feel a bit self-conscious.  "I'm trying to decide if a little time off would be beneficial for you," she explained.  "On one hand you wouldn't have the stress of work while we adjust your medication.  You know the side effects can be harsh at first sometimes... And on the other hand, that gives you more time to hide out in bed, which I don't want you doing either.  Let me hear your thoughts.  Do you think some time off would be good for you?".
"Taking care of me there.  For calming me down.  You just sprung right into action.  Thank you."  He nuzzled Cas's forehead and gave him a gentle kiss.
"Where are we going?" Cas asked. "Coffee? A restaurant? Can you at least tell me that?"  He really needed to break down and tell Dean he wasn't good at spontaneous plans. The anxiety was gnawing at him stronger now, but he was trying hard to keep it under control.
"Wha... Um.  Thanks, I think? Cas?" He gave him a quick pat on the back, trying not to hurt his feelings, but also feeling pretty damn awkward. "Did you take something?"
Cas turned around and stared at himself, still not totally convinced. "The sleeves are kinda short..."
"Hmm," Cas hummed, looking deep in thought.  "That's good.  I enjoyed the sensation of being drunk.  I think I would like to be drunk right now."
Cas huffed, his breath loudly echoing over the phone line.  "Of course we are.  Why would you say..."
"Relax your throat for me," Dean whispered, as he shoved into him until Cas's nose was buried in a thick tuft of curls.
"Okay," he said, exiting the bathroom and grabbing a bottle from the refrigerator.  "First, drink some more water." He strolled back and handed Cas another cold bottle and waited for him to drink.
"I get that a lot," Sam laughed. "Nice to meet you too, Gabriel. Thanks for the invite. Merry Christmas," he said, handing him a fancy box of chocolates.
Cas anxiously chewed his bottom lip,  considering this.  The shirt was the worst part.  And as long as he kept his boxers on, it didn't matter much.
Dean sighed heavily as he rubbed at his temples.  "Remember when I was a demon, and I was kinda buddy-buddy with him?  Well early on, before I got
Cas smiled, a bit sheepishly.  "He is. I've always had Gabe, so I'm pretty lucky.   But Dean has been good to me too, I think."
Tiny little tremors shot through Dean's body and his hands suddenly gripped at the sheets.  "What the fuuuck?" he wailed. He was pretty sure he had just jizzed a little but he was still freakin'
"Dee," he said sternly.  "Put the toys away.  We can leave the castle set up for tomorrow.  Right now, it's time for bed."
"Dean?  Cas?   You here?"  Sam had taken the car, but there was always the possibility that Cas had zapped them somewhere.  It still felt strange seeing the two of them together.  For as long as he had suspected, he should be over it by now, but it was still a bit of a shock after years of Dean's denial.
Usually, Dean wouldn't let anyone dote on him like this, but the constant caresses against his bare skin were strangely soothing. He felt a weird combination of relaxed and...
“Biological father,” Charlie cut in quickly. “We would be the parents listed on her birth certificate. You’d have no responsibilities or anything. Promise we won’t ask for child support,” she added in a lighter tone. Dean’s mind was spinning.
They had said he wouldn’t have any responsibilities, at least not on paper, but if he did this—hell, he was actually considering it—he didn’t want to be absent form the kid’s life either.
“Hey,” the Other Dean called out, stopping us both halfway up the stairs. When I looked back at him again, he looked like he was still uncertain, but also like he’d figured something out. Or perhaps like he’d discovered a missing puzzle piece, only to figure out that it didn’t fit in the puzzle he was currently working on, and was trying to figure out what to do with it. I expected he’d figured out that Dean and Castiel in our world hadn’t been friends. I expected him to ask, to make certain of his mental discovery, but he didn’t. “Take care, guys,” was all he said.
“Yeah, you did,” Charlie said. “What about all that stuff you told me about family not ending in blood? What about me? What about Jody and Garth? What about Claire? We’re your family too, and we’re worried about you. Sam and Cas wouldn’t want—“
“Every time we lost Cas, you were always—you were devastated, and it was worse every time. Especially this last time, I thought—Dean, I honestly, if he hadn’t come back, I wasn’t sure we’d had ever gotten
“Shit,” Dean breathed out. His hands pulled back, palms held up in front of him. “Cas, I’m sorry. I didn’t—I misunderstood—Shit, I’m sorry.”
Except that when Dean felt numb, that was when he felt the most. He felt anger, he felt betrayal. He felt tears burning his eyes and took another swig of whiskey until his throat burned more. He felt a tugging pain in his chest. He felt the strange mixture of trust and abandonment when he’d watched Jack walk away. He felt the pain of failure that had gripped him when he watched the light leave his brother’s eyes, felt his body go limp. He felt…whatever he’d seen in Cas’s eyes when he’d told Dean—He took a longer pull from the bottle and laid on the unforgiving concrete floor.
"No," Dean snarled.  "No excuses. This has been going on for years, and I've finally fucking snapped.  If you want me, you tell me right
“Why? They have good chemistry.” Cas privately marveled at the way he’d gotten emotionally invested in a primetime medical drama. If any of his siblings could see him now, tucked up under a quilt with a bowl of popcorn, texting another man about a character named
So he waited, patiently, watching Dean and Cas flirt with each other like middle schoolers with a crush, always in each other’s space but too afraid to hold each other’s hand in public.
Heat rushed to Dean’s cheeks. He cleared his throat and kept his gaze solidly on the ocean. “You’re such a sap,” he grumbled weakly.
“It’s burning,” Cas says, looking torn between relief and disappointment as he watches the flames. Dean understands the feeling.
“I dunno about you, but I’m gonna sleep like a log tonight,” he said with the most casual tone he could muster as he grabbed the weapons bag off Cas’ shoulder and deposited it on the duvet. “What about you? Think you’ll need a couple z’s?”
"I dunno," Dean says with a shrug as he passes Jack the bottle of syrup. He grins. "I kinda like mornings."
“Sam thinks pickles are gay,” Dean says to Cas with the same sort of smug glee of the teacher’s pet tattling about note passing in class.
Dean scratched the back of his neck and took another step forward. “Yeah well…What else was there to say? You said you, you know,
“Salt,” Dean barked. “We need salt!” Except all of theirs was now two stories below. Dean silently cursed. “The kitchen! Go! I’m right behind you!”
The fork they were holding clattered to the floor as Cas threw his arms around Dean with reckless determination. Dean’s bubbling laugh interrupted their kiss, but only for a moment. He gripped Cas at his waist, using the tie strings of his apron to pull him forward until their bodies were pressed together.
Cas can keep him impaled on his cock with just one arm. Dean is still riding that wave of awe-inspiring desire when Cas presses his hand to Dean’s chest.
It wasn’t long before Dean saw the devastatingly handsome man with a funny name again. As he turned from the counter with coffee in hand (large, black, absolutely not flavored or latte’d or mocha’d, the way coffee
"His birthday!" Jack's expression was too damn excitable for this early in the morning. "I was telling him about how we celebrated my birthday after Mrs. Butters left, and I asked him about his birthday, and he said he'd never celebrated one before!"
The statement caught Dean completely off-guard. His hand stilled as he gaped at Cas. “What?” he rasped around the ghostly hand on his throat.
“Like what?” Cas still isn’t touching him, which is bothersome, because Dean very badly wants Cas to start making his hands useful. Which...he thinks is only half the amulet speaking. That’s a pretty common thought for him without magic, at least.
Dean put on his best people-pleasing smile. “Yes you can. Hi, I’m Dean, and this is my, uh…” Dean glanced over to Cas and his eyes crinkled in delight. “Cas. This is my boyfriend, Cas.” Just the word caused a giddy bubble of effervescence to float inside Dean’s chest. After all this time, they were really here. This was real.
Dean relaxed and smiled. “Isn’t it past your bedtime?” he said as he swaggered into the kitchen. Cas jumped, sending a canister of spices toppling over and spilling on the counter and across his apron. Correction,
Cas nodded. He let his hand rest on the table next to Dean’s, barely brushing his pinky finger against Dean’s. Dean hooked their fingers together. “There’s this new restaurant I want to go to. I hope you’re not as picky about food as you are about coffee.”
Jack brightened. “Great! Come on, Dean. Let’s go!” He practically skipped toward the kitchen, radiating enthusiasm with every step. Dean sighed and followed after him, already anticipating the huge mess at the end of all this. At least it was just box mix. That was easy enough to handle.
Minutes later he was seated at his desk, waiting for Dean to answer his Skype call. He chewed on his lower lip, and when a familiar face popped up on his screen, he had to bite down to subdue the wide grin that threatened to overcome his cheeks.
“Yeah, well, they’re for my friend Charlie. She was supposed to make them, but she broke her finger and she can’t do them all herself, so these nerds are gonna hafta deal with whatever I can churn out.”
He made a move for it, but a figure flickered into being in front of him. She was wearing a torn, bloody sundress. Her long, straw-colored hair was plastered to the half of her gaunt face where it was smashed in, blood staining it crimson. The ghost took a step toward Dean. Thick, dark blood dripped from her head but never reached the floor.
--cheerfully and confidently marched because he was feeling pretty damn good about his plan--down the hallway toward the kitchen. If anyone asked, he was telling this to Sam, because he was on speaking terms with Sam, but he didn’t even bother poking his head into the library to make sure Sam heard him.
Oh yeah, this is definitely the better option. Dean fell ass-backwards into a conversation he’s been dreading for months, and the only person feeling awkward and miserable here is Sam!
“Alright, alright, c’mere you big sap,” Dean grumbles before they get too far into chick flick territory and Dean’s terrible self-esteem. He pulls Cas back down to his chest and resumes stroking his hair. “Man, I had no idea you were such a pervert.” He chuckles under his breath. “You gonna tell me about anymore of your awesome sex fantasies or do I have to track down another witch amulet?”
“Only when I want to be.” Cas realized he was positively beaming at his phone as he texted Dean. He cleared his throat and tried for a more neutral expression before giving up. No one was looking, anyway. “Do you wanna try just calling? Like in the before times?”
to you?” Cas yells back, and it’s the note of hysterical bitterness darkening his words that makes Dean snap and say what he’s been hiding for far too long.
. “Not the wings you had in the barn,” Dean said. They were incredible. The inky black wings Dean had seen only a flash of in the barn, they had been powerful, terrifying, the wings of a soldier. These were—
Dean tossed the college ad in the trash again. “You’re not subtle,” he told her when she came into the kitchen a few minutes later.
It could’ve been worse. Dean made sure it wasn’t. He put his keys on top of the upper cabinets in the kitchen because he knew when he was drunk, he wouldn’t be coordinated enough to reach them. He texted Stevie to come by in the morning. He didn’t open the bottle until Samantha was safely asleep in bed, and then stayed in his room. It could’ve been worse.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas said, his words no less painful to hear than the silence. “I didn’t mean to make you angry or—“
“No, no, no,” Dean muttered over and over again. He let Jonathan pulled him back onto the sidewalk, his entire body shaking and tears blurring his vision. “Not Claire. Fuck, not Claire.”
“Can we stay a bit longer?” Dean asked. Not me, of course. He asked the Other Dean, who shook his head. “Come one, we could all live here, in the bunker. There’s enough space for all of us.”
Not just for hunters, either. He was something in the community. He was a part of a non-hunter community in a way he couldn’t ever remember being. People saw Dean’s uniform when he went to get food off duty and smiled at him. He’d found a purpose that wasn’t hunting. And though he’d only partially done it for Cas, for Sam, some part of him was proud, knowing they would be proud if they knew.
If Sam noticed that Dean held on to Cas a little too long, he had the decency not to mention it. Once Dean felt like he could breathe again, he pulled back. The smile that stretched across his face pulled at muscles sorely used over the last few weeks.
It wouldn’t matter. It had been a year. Cas was gone, Sam was gone. Cas couldn’t hear him, Sam couldn’t hear him. Jack could probably hear him, but he’d said he would be hands off, so either that meant he wasn’t listening or wasn’t answering. It meant about the same to Dean.
“I know, I know, we will,” Sam cut him off quickly. He crossed the distance between them, leaning down to put his hands on Dean’s shoulders and look him in the eyes. “We’ll figure it out.”
He felt a hand on the back of his neck, another gripping his arm, tugging, holding him closer as Cas’s lips moved against his.
“Dean, we should get going,” I said, trying not to sound rushed, but I knew we needed to leave. We’d stayed long enough, and our presence—or our realities in another world—shouldn’t intersect with this one anymore than it already had.
“No more deal.” Dean could barely hear Jack’s words over the sound of his heart pounding in his ears. His determined stare never left Cas as he walked past Sam and Jack. The angel didn’t look happy about the news, or in any way like he cared at all.
“This is a stupid and unnecessary risk,” Cas said, his voice holding the same cold tone that had been more frequent as of late. Dean tore his eyes away from Cas when Sam held a beer out to him. “The Empty can’t collect on the deal, so what does it matter if it ever gets broken?”
The welcome home party for Samantha Mary Winchester was everything Dean had come to expect from his family. Every hunter he knew in the area was there, and a few that had gone out of their way on drives to or from a hunt to make it there for a few hours. He was most grateful to see Eileen there, if he was being honest.
“It’s okay,” Cas said again. “You kept me here, with you. And we’re free—really, truly free now.” Then Cas’s lips were on his again, and maybe Cas was right. They were free, and more than that, they were free to be happy. That wasn’t a freedom Dean was every certain he’d be able to afford, but with Cas pressed against him, a strong and constant presence, he entertained the thought for the first time that maybe he could.
At the mention of Jack, Dean finally loosened his grip a little and pulled away, though not far. He kept one hand on Cas’s shoulder, the there on his arm. The fear wasn’t entirely gone, and he didn’t want to risk letting go, in case the Empty would come back, in case he would disappear again. He couldn’t let that happen. Not again.
“I’m sorry if my words made you uncomfortable, Dean. It was never my intention,” Cas answered, his voice low and dejected in a way that made Dean feel like the bad guy. But he wasn’t. Cas was the one that left—what right did he have to make Dean feel guilty over being upset with him for leaving?
“You want to tell me why you’re ignoring everyone’s calls? You’ve got everyone worried sick. And where’s Sam?” Something must’ve shown on his face because her expression softened for the first time since Dean had opened the door. “No,” she whispered.
“Why didn’t you come back?” Dean asked quietly. “I thought you were dead. For decades, Cas—Its been fucking
“Absolutely,” Charlie answered. She squeezed Stevie’s hand in hers, and Dean felt a smile pulling at his lips.
Pounding in his head woke Dean. It was usually what woke him up the last few days, or week, however long it had been. It was always the hangover that woke him. Reminding him that the alcohol level in his body was getting dangerously low, and he needed to wake up and rectify the problem immediately. Lest he start to think—And thinking was strictly forbidden.
“You should be,” Charlie replied, though there was no venom in her tone. She pulled her chair around so she could sit facing Dean, the chair where his leg was still propped up on the chair beside her. “But not for this,” she added, gesturing to the wet patch on her shirt. “You should be sorry for scaring the hell out of us. Jody called, thinking I might’ve heard from you. Her and Donna are pulling their hair out.”
Looking at Cas though, his hands still resting on the angel’s shoulders, he knew he should say something. He had to say something, but no words came out. His smile faded a little, though Cas was still beaming at him.
“Dean,” Cas cut him off, and Dean finally took a breath, eyes registering the soft, hopeful smile stretching across Cas’s lips. “It’s okay.”
Besides that, Dean found that he didn’t have time for much outside of work and Samantha’s ever growing schedule. Middle and high school became a blur of juggled schedules that even three parents had trouble managing, but they did. Between Michael’s football and Sammy’s basketball practice, Jacob’s piano lessons and karate classes, they managed to work out a pickup and drop off schedule. Only to flip it on its head when the season changed, but at least Sammy and Jacob both got into the spring musical, so that made scheduling a little easier, just working in the addition of Michael’s baseball practice.
"Just take a break from being an adult for a while.  Let me take care of everything," Cas said solemnly.  He shot him his best imitation of Sam's puppy eyes, which, he had recently learned, Dean had a hard time saying 'no' to.
"Must have been really difficult, growing up like that..." Dean mused.  "Fuck, when I hit twelve, I swear I locked myself in my bedroom and jerked off every damn day," he laughed. "My dad gave me 'the talk', but they were really open and realistic about sex-stuff.  I'm sure they knew what I was doing in there, but they gave me space."
The sound of flapping wings and wind blew into the receiver again and Dean held it away from his ear as he cringed.
"Oh my god." Cas felt his face flame red as the lyrics to Britney Spears' 'I'm a Slave 4 U' played atop a mixed background Dean had created.
"So, what are you up to today, Cas?  You're welcome to come along if you want," Sam asked, stealthy changing the subject.
about it gave him so much anxiety, it wasn't worth the hassle.  Still, he couldn't shake those few moments of calm he'd had with Dean, and the surprising comfort of human touch.  He
Nervous laughter escaped Dean's throat and he pulled back a bit to get some space between them. "Yeah," he choked.  "I know it does. But it's kind of inappropriate."
"Cas, you know thats not true," Dean huffed. "Of course I want to.  But earlier you got all anxious when I told you to spread your legs."
an ass." Gabriel shook his head and picked up a slice of garlic bread, then flung it at Cas's chest.
"I...I can't," Cas faltered.  "We're really shorthanded.  I'm already covering for someone who got sick and..."
"Depends on your alcohol tolerance I suppose, and if you overdo it...  and how fast you drink, whether or not you've eaten... I usually get a wicked headache if I overdo it, and I just feel shitty. Some people vomit."
I'm not always good in social situations, Gabe.  And I know that I'm not always in the right state of mind, so I get it.  I admit, I was a nervous wreck most of the time he was here.  But I could still say no if I wanted to."
He was giggling for no good reason as he danced, hyper-aware of his own body, but also of those around him.  Anxiety had always made him feel self-conscious, but this was totally different. He was
"That's a good choice when you're feeling low.  It's good to reach out.  Much better than hiding in your bedroom like a hermit, right?  Who did you text?"
"What?" Dean frowned.   "A guy can't slay a dozen vamps without something being wrong?"   They'd come to town seeking a possible restless spirit, but that ended up being the least of their worries.  As Sam was asking around town about other suspicious activity, it became glaringly obvious there was more than one creepy crawly lurking, and by the end of the night, they'd not only taken care of the spirit, but an entire nest of vampires as well.
"Then there's this weirdo," he said, tilting his head toward Sam and handing him the bag. "Who gets fruit and oatmeal from a fast food joint?"
Dean flipped through his book and settled on a picture of Oscar the Grouch.  As he snatched  up the green crayon, he his mind suddenly wandered to all the times he'd slip a coloring book into the grocery cart for Sammy when they were kids.  Dad always left him a little money for groceries when he went away - there wasn't much extra, but coloring books were cheap, and it was something for Sam to do while they bounced around from one crappy motel to the next.  He tried so hard to give Sam some sense of normalcy, even though he barely knew how to be a kid himself.  Dean finished coloring Oscar's face, suddenly feeling the slightest bit nostalgic.
After quickly inhaling their luke-warm food,  Dean grabbed him by the hand again and led Cas for just a few minutes more.
"Cassie, tea with honey. Dean, coffee, black. Help yourselves, kids," he said, setting the tray on the coffee table.
Dean smirked. "Ah yes.  Speaking of which... I'm going to go to the bathroom. When I come out, I want you completely naked on your bed," he said matter-of-factly.
. I'm not... Dammit," Dean grumbled. He muscled Cas onto his back, pinning him to the bed. "I'm not fucking you like this."
"Wow," he muttered. The snow that he assumed had drifted against his windowpane wasn't so much drifted as it was deep.
"Okay." Dean's voice had slipped down an octave, and he knew he was eye-sexing him like crazy, but he didn't care. "Still want help?"
"Dean," Cas panted.  His gravely voice seemed deeper than usual as he finally pried himself away.  "Take me home."
"Nothing.  I'm okay, really.  Gabe made me eat, and I'm hanging out at his place.   Not that I had a choice."  He rolled his eyes at Gabriel.  "He keeps forcing me out of bed."
Dean nodded. "You know this means you can't keep being so shy around me now, right?" he teased.  "I've seen your 'O' face."  He rolled off onto his side and pulled Cas in close to his chest.
"No, no.  Don't stop on my account," Gabe grinned.  "I know I should be kind of weirded out, but that was the cutest thing I've ever seen. Soooo," he said, flopping down in the chair across from them, "what are you watching?"
Dean stared at him for a long minute, his features softening into an uncomfortably tender gaze that made Cas's arms tingle with goosebumps.
"Besides, he's right, you know," Dean continued.  "We couldn't wait to get our hands on each other."
"Dean... I'm..." He was trying so hard to form a sentence but the words kept slipping from his mind. All he could think of was
"Um..." Cas thought for a moment. "I love it. Most of the time. I like helping people find the information they're looking for. Sometimes I help out with the kids' summer reading program, and I organize guests, and community programs, and author signings.  That's fun. I really just love being around books in general."
"Pizza's here," Dean said cheerfully, placing a huge box and some paper plates on the coffee table.  "Did you text your brother?"
A heavy sigh met him in response. "I guess. Just fucking embarrassed," Cas said, still burying his face in Dean's chest.
"Well don't worry, it's not just you.  But she's going through everyone's shelves and if a single book is out of place... Well shit, see for yourself."
"You're extra cute when you're sleepy, you know," Dean said, nuzzling his hair. "And shirtless tonight?"
"Hey Cas!  Just coming to borrow something," Gabriel's voice rang through the house, waking Cas from his nap on the couch.  He sat up groggily and rubbed at his eyes as his brother entered the living room.
"Okay," Dean sighed.  He hurriedly colored the rest, because he was freakin' starving, and he sat down at the tiny dining table.  "What's for dinner?"
Cas arched his back as a firm hand began stroking up and down his spine, reaching further each time until his fingers slipped underneath the waistband of Cas's boxers. As Dean dug his fingertips into the tight curve of his ass, Cas growled and inched closer to give him better access.
Cas nodded.  "For a while I just felt numb, but I'm starting to feel a bit more, anyway.  Although two nights ago, I just felt overwhelmingly sad.  I don't know why, I was just miserable."
"F-fine, Cas," Dean panted.  "Go back to sleep," he said, trying to disguise what sounded like a sniffle.
beautiful. I wouldn't change last night for anything. I feel so much closer to you. I can't believe I made you wait so long. I can't believe
Sam walked away in stunned silence, wondering what the hell he was thinking.  Was he really going to do this?
Cas rolled his eyes. "It's not. But some people prefer this version because it feels more like the tail is a part of you.  Easier to wag, that sort of thing. It helps a lot of people get into that headspace.  I was just giving you the option. This one attaches to a harness and goes across your lower back," he said, holding the other one up. "Since when are you afraid of having something up your..."
Dean smiled and strategically sat down in the middle of the couch, rather than giving Cas the empty seat between them, which he expected. "You know, Cas, you're very passionate about things once you get talking.  I'm sorry I make you so nervous," he speculated, watching for Cas's reaction.
.   He wasn't lying when he told Sam that this wasn't just about what Dean needed.  But what he didn't tell him was,
"Wow," Cas nodded in awe.  "That's actually really cool.  And it explains why you're always impeccably dressed."
"Hi again," Dean said politely.  "I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I'm not a very good morning person.  I'm Dean," he said, holding out a hand to Gabriel.
"Don't be shitty," Gabe rolled his eyes.  Gabriel was an extremely patient man, but Cas could be a bit of an ass when he wanted to be left alone.  Fortunately, Gabe could take it just as well as he could dish it back.  "
A comfortable hush fell over the room as they busied themselves with eating.  Gabriel's meal left lots of room for second helpings, and it wasn't until they were comfortably full that the conversation really began flowing again.
Cas frowned, not entirely believing Dean's words, but appreciating the sentiment anyway. "You're sweet... and
"Yeah, well, I figured you'd tear my place apart looking for me if you came down and I was gone," Cas frowned.  "See ya in a while."
"...until you're so horny you're begging me to fuck you," he finished.  He delighted in Cas's surprised little gasp, so he leaned in for a quick kiss, but wound up tongue-fucking his mouth instead as Cas's fingertips dug firmly into his back.
"Sure thing!"  Dean waved the waiter back over. "We'll each have the carbonara, maybe the bruscheta to start," he looked at Cas for confirmation, and Cas shrugged noncommittally.  "And do you have anything in a Gavi?"
He took a long, deep breath as the shorts slipped away, his cock springing free of the fabric that had been restraining it, and Cas took a shuddering breath of his own.
"Uhhh. Yeah.  Hi," Gabe said awkwardly.  "I'm Cas's brother, Gabriel.  Sorry to interrupt you. I'll talk to you later, Cas."
But as he looked around, he was surprised to see that no one had even flinched. People were still dancing, some were singing along... It was almost as if they
Dean's chest was heaving as he tried to catch his breath.  "Cas," he huffed. "C-come here," he motioned, pulling Cas's sweaty body on top of his. "That was amazing, sweetheart," he gushed as he kissed him everywhere he could reach. His arms and legs wrapped around him, clutching him tightly. "Thank you, baby," he whispered, a bit more misty-eyed than he'd like to admit. "Thank you."
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. "Good."  He carefully removed his t-shirt and wiped off his hand, then gently wiped Cas clean.  "Ugh.  Good thing we just did laundry, huh?" he teased. He tossed it across the room to the empty laundry basket.
Gabriel stood and began clearing their plates from the table. "Yeah, Cassie. Even when you're a pain in my ass," he smiled, giving Cas's hair a quick tussle.
to watch you. That last time, the way you just climbed up on me and rode me like a fucking jockey... Holy
"Baby," Dean warned as he began grinding him into the mattress. "You'll get off like this or not at all, understand?" he growled firmly.
"I have some angel business to attend to.  I'll be back this evening.   But call me if you need me."
Dean nodded again.  Hell, like he could turn down an offer of free, no-strings-attached action?  He knew better than to look a gift horse in the mouth.  Besides, this was like...
"You did," Dean smiled. "And you did really well, for what it's worth. That was great for a first time."
The doctor nodded sympathetically.  "Any changes in your life lately?  Anything that may have triggered the change in your mood?"
"Dogs don't wear clothes, Dean.  You're a carefree pup, you can't be encumbered by clothes.  You'll wear this," Cas reached into the bag he'd set on the bed earlier and held up a set of black trunks. "Just enough to cover yourself."
Cas nodded, his eyes meticulously scanning every millimeter of Dean's newly-mended torso.  "But there's something else, isn't there?  What happened tonight?"
Cas stood in stunned silence for a moment, panting heavily as he watched him walk away. He had no idea what Dean was suggesting, but he certainly wanted to find out. Quickly, he tossed the stick aside and hurried outside.
As Dean finally stilled, Cas kissed his way back up his body and lay down next to him, watching Dean struggle to catch his breath.
Dean glanced up and tried to stifle a sigh.  He was so fucking tired of teaching Cas how to do things, but it was the least he could do.  After all, it was his fault he was in this predicament to begin with.  He tossed the remote control aside, and took a final, wistful glance at the television before standing up and marching Cas into the laundry room.
"Mmmhmm. That's the point," Dean said, lowering himself back down for a kiss. "Relax and let it go," he whispered, burying his face in Cas's neck and sucking a wet trail of kisses there.
Dean grinned, slapping a hand to his face in surprise. "I bet they do too. You're lucky. I can't keep it up if I take E."
Cas glanced away shyly, feeling his face burn a bright shade of scarlet. "Maybe." He subconsciously licked his lips as Dean coaxed his chin back toward him.
"You almost ready, Dee? " he asked.  "I've got a lot of research to do today, and you two probably want to get home."   He motioned for the waitress to bring their bill as Dean nodded uncertainly.
this.  What the hell was Cas talking about?  Just because he never really had parents didn't mean...
"That's it, baby.  Show me how you get yourself off," Dean breathed.  Gently, he began moving his finger in and out as Cas's eyes rolled back.
"Is this because he called you my pet?  Because fuck that!  You're no one's pet.  He was just fucking with your head.  You're not,  Cas. "
For good measure,  Cas healed Dean of his bumps and bruises too, then sat down to watch them eat.  While they were physically healed, they both looked so drained and broken-down, it almost hurt to look at them.
"Anyway, I'll be okay. I'm just not ready yet. And then the whole going back and having people asking why I was off and stuff... I don't want to talk about it."
Cas sat up, wide-eyed and oddly aroused at the thought of wearing the collar again. He tried to swallow, but his mouth had gone dry at the icy intensity of Dean's stare. As the strap of leather fastened around his neck, a whimper rose up in his throat and he felt his entire body go submissively slack.
Dean spends most of the night staring at the ceiling, thoughts racing through his head at a hundred miles an hour. This time tomorrow, he could have Cas back. This time tomorrow he can--Dean is almost afraid to think it, afraid that giving form to what he
the ocean later, Dean and Cas pulled into a parking space for a charming bed and breakfast painted in a lovely pale--
Susan curled her hands around her mug, staring into the steaming coffee with a far off look in her eyes. “I was afraid. Of my own feelings. Of opening myself to getting hurt. So I...When Marcy needed me to be honest about how I felt I...I let her down. She got mad...We fought...She ran off. There was an accident, and...Well...” Susan took another deep breath. Her eyes were glassy with tears and heavy with regret. “Today is the anniversary of the day she died.”
Dean tries not to think about what a big baby he’s being by ignoring this golden opportunity. “He just tastes stuff different as an angel. He’s learning how to pick out the nuance.”
Dean chuckles and flashes her his best charming, but chagrined smile. He feels a little guilty for leading her on, and he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings. “Oh sweetheart, if I were single, I’d gladly take you up on that offer, but I’ve already got my special someone.” Dean nods to the honey booth next door.
They fell back into easy silence while Cas carefully lined their pie tin with pastry. Dean spooned the filling into the tin, packing in as much as he could. While Cas carefully laid the top crust over it and finished things off, Dean helped himself to the leftover slices of crunchy, spicy, sweetened apples.
Silently, Dean takes a single step forward. Cas is frozen on the spot, staring at him like he doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He takes another step, and another, until he’s close enough to reach out and tug Cas into an embrace.
Their eyes met, and Dean realized he was staring. He also realized from Cas’ arched brow that Cas knew he was staring. Dean forced a quiet chuckle while his heart skipped a beat. “I mean, I like to experiment as much as the next guy--” He didn’t miss the way Cas’ eyebrows rose up his forehead and flashed him a playful wink--“but I draw the line at messing with my caffeine.”
was why they couldn’t hear each other. Sadly, logic kicked in, reminding him that he’d hear Dean’s television in the background if he had sound. He sighed. Technical issues were definitely the more likely explanation.
Dean tries to laugh at the dutiful concern on Cas’ face, but he can’t catch his breath enough. He nods weakly and manages, “No words,” before he drops his head back against the wall while his brain finishes rebooting.
“Narratively, someone had to mess it up because the television show wouldn’t survive without its lead actor.”
There was a longer than usual pause between messages. “Okay look. Don’t make fun. We’ve all been there…”
He stays there for a moment, gasping for air, his cock still deep inside an angel who doesn’t need to breathe. His fingers card through Cas’ hair.
Dean silently laughed, and Cas couldn’t help but stare at the way his entire face lit up when he was happy. “Takes one to know one.”
And once his project was done, Dean started to message Cas for no reason at all. Sometimes it was to complain about work, sometimes it was to share a funny story about his day. Cas’ favorite messages were when Dean provided live commentary for whatever dramatic television show he was watching. Cas found himself settling in front of the TV those nights simply to follow along with Dean.
weren’t any buckets in the open steel shelves, he made an exaggerated show of bending over to check, ass high in the air and just a scant few feet away from where Cas was seated.
Cas rolled his eyes. “I said ‘isn’t cute,’” he clarified, air quotes and everything. But his lips twitched upwards with the ghost of amusement, and Dean carefully filed that information away for later.
Dean tightens his grip on his angel blade, his jaw set, his eyes determined. He’s ready to get his angel back. “Yeah. I do.”
The inside was clearly the result of a scandalous love affair between a Jimmy Buffet concert and a Hallmark store--All tacky tropical themed furniture and a dizzying array of porcelain figurines.
“Don’t worry,” the ghost said to Cas, and the venom in her voice dropped into twisted sympathy. “I’ll take your pain away soon.”
...But also pretty lame.” A pulse of fondness shoots through Dean’s heart, and before he can even think about it, he’s adding, “Though I’ve gotta be honest, I love how into me you are.” Dean’s eyes widen. Well
Dark thoughts still swirled in Dean’s head as he returned to the bed and breakfast and marched up the stairs.
Cas’ entire face lit up. His eyes were brighter than the sky outside, and Dean was momentarily awestruck. “Good. That’s…” He laughed a little, and Dean’s smile warmed at how endearingly flustered Cas looked. “Good. Great!”
Cas was grinning wider than he ever had in his life. His cheeks ached. Dean, beautiful Dean, was here in front of him, and he was even more stunning than Cas could bear. His eyes almost immediately found the smattering of freckles across Dean’s cheeks, something he couldn’t see through a grainy webcam, and his heart leapt in delight.
“A guy can’t grab a bite from his own kitchen?” Dean advanced on him, and Cas pressed up against the counter. Definitely trying to hide something. “Whatcha got going on over here, Julia Child?” Dean tried to lean around Cas, who tilted right there alongside him, but Dean could see flour, butter, brown sugar, and a big bag of apples.
The next morning, they’re both expecting some sort of bump in the road, some rare ingredient or some missing incantation that will set them back even longer, keep Dean from seeing Cas again for God knows how long. But fortune is on their side, and Sam executes the spell flawlessly.
"You did it," Dean smiled, wrapping his arms around him.  "Let's go sit down and relax." They teetered carefully back to their bench and Dean helped remove Cas's jacket. "Sit," he said softly.  "Just keep breathing for me while I get your skates off," he murmured. "What was it you use?  Oh! Smell the rose, blow out the candle. Deep, slow breaths, sweetheart. Do you have a pill with you?"
He was gradually starting to fall back into his normal routine. Usually at this time he'd be starting dinner, making sure Cas was eating and taking his meds, and generally just keeping him company. However, since Dean had been around a lot lately, he had a bit more free time.
weird.  Maybe Cas was right.  They definitely weren't as close as he and Dean were.  Maybe they couldn't pull this off after all.
nice," he said, nodding his approval.  "I would drink this almost any time.  I never even heard of a... What did you call this?".
Gabe had been neglecting himself for a while in favor of taking care of Cas - staying up too late, not getting in his usual exercise.  Gabriel was a social guy, but he hadn't been going out lately or participating in any of his usual hobbies. Hell, he hadn't even gotten laid in months.  Not that he minded, of course; Cassie was more important than all of those those trivial things.  Still, he was starting to experience a bit of caretaker burnout.
nervous.  Cas was naive and a little skittish, and Dean was constantly second-guessing his actions; he didn't want to push him too far, too fast.  Maybe it was time to admit he already fucking liked this guy.  How could he not?  He was
"Uh.  I'm a Slave 4 U..."  Cas squeaked, cringing in shame.  "I know!  It's awful!  I can't help it!"
"You're so good at building, Sammy!" Cas praised.  "Tell you what.  You keep working, and I'm going to go see if I can get Dee to come downstairs, okay?"
Dean grinned and reached over to the nightstand.  "Give me your hand."  He pumped a few squirts of lube into Cas's palm, then slicked up his fingers again.  "Knees up."
Cas shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "Yes. You're right, most of it does apply to me. We were very repressed in a lot of ways. I-I don't like thinking about it too much, because I loved my parents..."
Gabriel flicked through the channels for a few minutes, and finally stopped on an action movie they had all seen a dozen times.  "So, you think you're gonna go this weekend, Cassie?"
Cas took another shaky breath.  "I guess I haven't mentioned... My parents were super religious.  Almost fanatically so.  Dad was an Evangelical preacher, mom the typical preacher's wife.  Hell, they named my brother and me after archangels," he chuckled.
"Why wouldn't it?" Dean rolled over onto his back and pulled Cas into his side. "Someone so horny and hungry for you they want to taste you?
"Hmm. I don't remember, actually. I was really young. We used to live close to an indoor skating rink when I was a kid, and my Mom used to take us skating every weekend."
ball. So it's a game of angles, okay? You should be good at this. You're good with numbers and shit."
," Dean grinned, waggling an eyebrow.  "Okay, okay.  I'll wait. Go get dressed.  And think about what you want to do today. Are we going out or staying in?"
"Shhhh," Dean commanded.  "Be quiet. Don't say a damn word."  He tilted his victim's head toward him so that he could get a good look.
"Aw, I'm sorry, Cassie," Gabriel said, coming up behind him.  "Group hug! I was just busting your balls. That was too far though.  I'm sorry.  Seriously, good for you. How long have I been saying you guys need to just bang already? Now," he said, pulling away. "Have a seat.  Let's dig into the crudités while we wait, huh?"
said that.  Sorry, I'm an idiot." He shifted awkwardly as his face reddened, and Cas couldn't help but think how cute he was when he got embarrassed.  Ninety-nine percent of the time he seeme calm and collected, so the little reminder that Dean might be a bit nervous too actually made him feel better.
Sam immediately grinned.   "Thundercats.  I loved it.   He thought they were creepy," he laughed.  "Creepy Cat People, he called them."
"There he is!  Welcome to the real world, bro.  It's not so bad here - we have lasagna and cheesecake!  Or at least we will in a bit." Despite his best efforts, Gabriel's cheerful greeting did nothing but grate at his nerves.
Cas slumped down into the nearest dining chair and took a long, deep whiff.  "That smells good.  Thanks for dinner.  Again."
Cas rolled his eyes.   "You're so repressed.  Sorry to drag you out of your space here," he said, glancing around at all the other people. "Figured it was better than doing it with Sam in the bunker. "
"It's actually very common among people with your type of upbringing. I'm going to send you home with some homework.  A book on purity culture.  Now, admittedly, a lot of it pertains to women, but there are a few chapters I want you to read.  I'm also going to give you a list of websites for people coping with sexuality and religion.  There's one there called the No Shame Movement that I want you to check out."
"Yeah," Gabriel grinned.  "I was always a bit of a rebel. Look, I know it's hard, but if you want to talk about it... "
A little huff escaped his throat and Dean froze at hearing the old familiar nickname. He hadn't heard it in so many years, it came as a shock.  "Sammy used to call me that," he finally managed.
"I thought I'd come by to help translate that book Sam was talking about yesterday," Cas said, running his fingers through his hair as if air travel had mussed it.
Gabriel smiled. "I already said I don't hate you, so you don't need to suck up. So... Is this your main job?  Or do you have a day job too?"
." He walked to the other side of the room and opened a door, exposing an adjoining bedroom.  "So I thought it should be nice."
"Good. In that case, you'll be wearing it a lot more," Dean winked. "You're going to wear it until we leave the house tomorrow, understood?"
"A '67 Impala.  She's my baby, but she doesn't do well in these New York winters, unfortunately. Totally impractical, I suppose, but I drive her as often as I can.  Sentimental attachment, I guess.  She was my dad's."
Sam pointed him in the direction of the restroom and Cas hurried off, sticking to the outside perimeter of the room so as not to get swept up in the pulsating sea of people. It wasn't until he reached the relative quiet of the bathroom that he finally realized just how tense he had been. Looking at himself in the mirror, he looked like a pale, scared little kid.
Dean opened his eyes, squinting tiredly at Gabriel and the blinding white snow outside. "Um.  Hello?"  He tightened his grip around Cas's waist as he lifted his head.
Cas took a deep breath.  "N-not yet.  Just the anticipation. I-I've tried and it always h-hurts. A lot."
So here they were, Cas slowly but surely sliding Dean's pants down his legs. He yanked them off over his feet, and his fingers gripped the waistband of his boxers, making Dean tense up. He may have been too drunk last night, but he was way too damn sober today. Cas had insisted he not drink so that his judgement wasn't clouded, and for whatever reason, he'd listened.
practically a damn dog collar, after all. Maybe it was the taboo, or the slight naughtiness of it that was exciting... The thought of being 'owned' by Dean was a major turn-on.
Dean raised an eyebrow and grinned, waiting for a moment to see if Cas would put the pieces together. When he just continued to stare, Dean finally spoke again.
"How does it feel to know I'm inside you, Cas?" he said, kissing a line up his shoulder blade.  He knew he should be taking it slow and sweet right now but he'd waited too fucking long for this.
Dean turned to him and gave him a sincere but sad smile. "Yeah," he said, giving Cas a little peck on the cheek. "Thanks, Cas. C'mon. There's a bench up here if you want to sit for a minute."
"People don't quit jobs, they quit bosses," Gabriel sighed. "You could always come work in the bakery with me," he winked. "I could use your pie making expertise. And I'm a great boss."
Dean didn't even flinch.  "Yeah?  I can't draw to save my life.  What kind of stuff do you read and watch?"
"I have something tentatively planned.  But if it's too overwhelming, we can grab takeout and come right back here and watch a movie, okay? "
you got the sexy voice.  I'd kill for those pipes!  And that shit doesn't even matter, because you are honestly one of the most amazing people I know. If he doesn't like you, he's an idiot. Don't underestimate yourself, man."
He'd seen both Sam and Dean cry on occasion, but he'd never done it himself. He wasnt even sure angels
"Good.  Now let's start fresh. Take a step toward me. You can still reach the railing, and I have your other hand, okay?"
Dean shoved a hat and a pair of gloves at him and Cas tugged them on as they hurriedly fumbled up the slick pathway.  "I guess neither of us wore the proper footwear for an expedition today," Dean said, chagrined.  "Well, we won't stay too long.  I don't want to give you frostbite."
Cas couldn't even think straight.  He felt so hot and lightheaded, his vision was blacking out around the edges, and he briefly thought he might pass out.  "Dean!" he yelped, gripping him tighter. "Dean?"
Cas stared up at him, eyes pleading as he whimpered, and Dean melted a little inside.  He was so beautiful and trusting.
Cas was quickly reaching his limit.  His legs were feeling weak and heavy both from Dean pounding into him and from the awkward position he was in. Despite his attempt to stay silent, little moans and squeaks kept coming out of his mouth anyway.
"Wha... Oh!  Fuck, why didn't you say something?" Dean asked, shoving the tools aside.  "Uhh..." he cringed right along with Cas.  "Yeah, that doesn't look comfortable at all.  Jesus, how the hell did they tie that thing?"he murmured as he began working the knots out of the ribbon.  "I have a knife, but frankly, that makes
Cas opened, his dark blue eyes trained on Dean's, and in one swift motion, Dean lunged forward, sliding his cock into Cas's waiting mouth.
"Mmmhmm."  Cas nodded tiredly, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him close. "I don't think I've ever, um,
Sam was in his usual spot in the library, tapping away at his laptop when they finally came fumbling down the stairs. He glanced up and stared for a moment, cautiously deciding if he would be dealing with Dean or Dee before speaking.
"Cas.  Sweetheart.  Come home with me. We can dance there if you'd like, and we'll cuddle on the bed.  Please."
"Cas, you are so damn adorable... Come here, sweetheart," Dean said, nuzzling until Cas lifted his chin to kiss him, at the same time coaxing him to straddle his lap.
Dean shrugged. "I don't know anymore.  I used to be.  I was obsessed with skating when I was a kid; played hockey a few times a week. I was so sure I was going to be a professional hockey player," he laughed. "Then when mom died, I kind of lost interest. Haven't skated since."
He stood there staring at the phone for a minute, not quite sure what had just happened.  "Guess I'm going out," he muttered, a perfect mix of dread and excitement gnawing at his stomach.
Cas rolled his eyes and grinned. Gabe had been giving him tiny tasks to do when he came over lately. He didn't mind, of course, but he knew it was his brother's little way of making him feel useful when he was feeling like shit.  To be honest, it usually worked.
Gabriel smiled into the phone. "Alright. I'm kinda glad you're getting out. Thanks for telling me.  Call if you need anything."
"Okay." Cas headed into the bathroom and set his bag on the counter. The anxiety was increasing now as it was nearly time to go to the club, and every possible awkward scenario was playing out in his head on a loop: panic attacks, fainting, being awkward in front of Dean's friends. He just hoped he could survive the night.
"Pssh," Cas snickered.  "He does that to me too.  We pick on each other.  It's what we do!  It's how we 'show love; if you will," he grinned.  "I know he's a total pain in the ass, but if he's teasing you, he's okay with you. Trust me."
Dean continued licking a path down his stomach, finally stopping when his nose was buried in a soft tuft of curly dark hair. Cas bucked his hips again in frustration, but only managed to hit Dean in the forehead with his cock.
"We're down front," Dean said, tugging him along, and Cas blushed as he suddenly realized they were still holding hands.  Sitting down in the first row, Dean helped him with his coat and stowed all of their winter gear under the seats.  "So.  We're here. Is this okay?"
"Mmm. I can do that." Cas grinned and raised his chin to mash his lips roughly against Dean's.  What started as a few innocent pecks slowly turned into long, deep kisses, and within seconds, Cas was squirming and shamelessly rutting against him again.
Cas scanned the mostly empty room, wondering what in the world he was so nervous about. The club was nothing special - a large room with a fancy bar along the back wall, a few tall tables for standing, and a slightly elevated stage area at the front; nothing out of the ordinary.
"It's like that in a way, except there's nothing kinky about it - It's like I'm playing the Dominant and your brother is the submissive.   Both partners try to get into the mindset of someone else.  And sometimes, you get so into it that it becomes... like an alter-ego.    It's a fantasy world, where you're still yourself, but maybe focused on one or two exaggerated aspects of your personality.  You're still cognizant of everything that's happening, and at the same time, you give in and let the other persona take over.  It's very freeing."
Sam caught Dean's attention and motioned toward the dance floor, and Dean beamed at them. He led Cas to a spot nearby, rejoining his group of friends, which had increased by a few women since he left.  Almost immediately, one of them zeroed in on Sam and began dancing, rather provocatively in front of him.
"How are you feeling?" Dean whispered against his ear. He pulled out for a quick second, just long enough to apply some more lube.
, he scoffed to himself.   Sure, he had tested it himself with a finger from time to time, but a finger was much smaller than...
"You hardly have to force me to converse with Dean," Cas muttered, perplexed by the entire situation. "Why go to such lengths to kidnap me?"
"You're squirming an awful lot," Dean hummed.  "Getting a little restless, baby?  You want me to hurry?" he taunted.
Dean chewed his sandwich, silently looking back and forth between the two of them, happy that they seemed to be getting along.  "You know," he said, choking down his last bite, "You and Cas are a lot alike, actually...  He's into the same kinda music too, Sammy."
"Yeah.  That makes sense," Cas muttered, feeling a bit hot and flushed at this all-new level of embarrassment.
Sam nodded, relaxing now that he had got that off his chest.  "Suppose I shouldn't go raining on your parade.  Two nights in a row, huh?  Bastard," he grinned.
"No!" Cas yelled.  "I mean... I don't blame you if you want to go. B-but I'd like you to stay," he uttered weakly.
Dean's jaw clenched and he swallowed hard, the truth of Cas's statement bitter on his tongue.  "I still don't know exactly what it is you're suggesting.  It's a weird sex-thing, right?   Like... you're supposed to be my dad, and yet we fuck?  Because I'm pretty sure I can't get into that."
.  But dammit, he really needed to stop looking at him like that. "Cas..." he started, but it came out more like a whimper.
"There.  Good as new," Dean said as he straightened his shirt collar.  "Much bet..." He paused, suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious.  "...whaaat?"
Henry shook his head, tears filling his tired eyes. "Thank you," he said, struggling to find words. He sat down on the ground again and opened the styrofoam container.
"Did you see my car?" Dean suddenly asked. He was looking up at Sam expectantly as he held up his mini Impala.
"M-maybe I'll have to start being even braver," Cas stammered, timidly reaching over and ghosting his fingertips over Dean's groin.
Dean's demeanor softened as he stared at him. "Don't you dare hide from me now," he said, spooning up behind him. "Look, if you want the honest-to-God truth, I asked you out at first because I thought you were smokin' hot."
.  Together.  He had no idea how they'd managed to spend an entire night in each others' arms without
"No," Cas said quickly.  "No, it's fine.  I guess I'm just kind of new to all of this.  What should we talk about?"
"Few months," he said, slamming back his drink and motioning for another. "Just keep striking out with the ladies lately. I don't get it. I'm charming, right? "
"Not too bad," he said thoughtfully. "Better overall. I still have panic attacks, but they're mostly situational... I'm not feeling anxious all the time anymore like I was."
"Okay, okay. So you just kinda... rubbed it raw," Dean cringed.  He gently took Cas's cock into his hand and gave it a little squeeze, feeling Cas shudder beneath his touch.
Dean chuckled sheepishly.  "We've all got guilty pleasures I guess.  Well, hey.  I surrender with these tacos.  If I eat any more I'm going to explode.  How you doing over there?"
Cas smiled. "Yeah. Just finished. I always make the desert at Christmas, but since we're not big on cookies, we do pies. I just put the last one in. Cherry."
"I've noticed.  And I'm glad," Dean smiled, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek.  They sat in silence for a while, watching person after person skate by at all different skill levels.
"Shhh. Don't fight it. It'll help you relax," Ryan said, calmly pressing a finger to Cas's lips. "Just close your eyes and listen to the music."
"Oh my god, what have I gotten myself into?  I don't even know what half of those things are!" Cas yelped.
Gabriel stopped stirring the pot on the stove and wiped his hands on a towel before reaching for the bottle. "Oh, thanks," he said cheerfully, eyeing up the label.  "You have good taste.  This will go great with dinner. Let's pop this open. You a wine guy?"
"No!  I'm at work!  I just risked my ass to get here!  It took forty minutes, and I passed two accidents and three cars off the road.  That freakin' bitch!" he yelled.  It wasn't often he used that word, but today he was
"I want to," Cas said, taking a deep breath.  "Teach me.  How do I lace these things?" he said, picking up the skates again.
"Smartasses," Dean muttered. "Alright, let's just eat already." He dug into the greasy paper bag and handed out their food. "I got you a breakfast sandwich meal, Cas. Hope that's okay."
Cas gathered his prescription and his homework and stepped back into the lobby where Gabriel was waiting for him.  He had planned on going alone today, but his brother insisted on taking him to his appointment as usual. Gabe was such a damn mother hen when he was sick.
"Thanks, Gabe," Cas said sheepishly. "I don't know how I'd be surviving right now without you.  I owe you."
It didn't matter how many times Dean had lived it, winter in New York still held a certain charm - the crisp, clean smell of freshly fallen snow on the pavement, holiday decorations in every storefront window display, a bell-ringing Santa on every corner, and best of all, the Rockefeller Christmas tree overlooking the quaint skating rink.
"Yeah," Cas sighed.  He pulled the blanket off the back of the couch and shook it out, pulling it up to his chin.  "For what it's worth, you do pretty well."
"Fuck, Cas," Dean panted as Cas came up for air.    "I'm...  Uhh..."  Hell, he didn't know what was happening.  He was hot.  So fucking hot, and his blood pressure felt like it had gone through the roof. His dick was leaking like crazy, and he felt on the edge of orgasm, but he couldn't come just yet.
Slowly Cas calmed, and minutes later he was happily snuggled up to Dean's chest.  He sighed and closed his eyes.   "You smell good, " he murmured. "And your body is still warm."
The shorter man began cutting the ropes off of his legs and arms, and Cas attempted to stretch just slightly as he was made to stand, the cuffs still digging into his wrists behind him.
"Yeah. Guess I'm just used to most people not coming back. This is for me?" he asked as Cas handed him one of the bags.
. But you should know by now that I'm not going to force you into anything you're not comfortable with."
He didn’t feel normal. He didn’t feel good. Not by any definition. But he felt…Okay. As okay as he could, anyway. He felt like he wasn’t alone, and that was a dangerous feeling, but he let himself indulge in it, just for a little while.
“What do you mean what the hell?” Charlie hissed at him. He could see now that tears glazed over her eyes, even as she glared daggers at him.
It was a win. On some level, Dean knew that. On a logical level, maybe. The entire population of the world had been returned. Sam had Eileen. Charlie had Stevie. They were worried about Dean, of course. But they were also happy. They won.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said quickly, squeezing Cas’s shoulder again, as if reminded himself that he was here, alive and in one piece.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said. He didn’t have anything else to offer, but he knew from experience there was nothing else to say. No words made it better or easier.
The familiar voice, the familiar greeting, the way Cas’s lips formed the words, it broke something, and Dean lunged forward, throwing his arms around Cas and pulling him tight against him. He knew he was shaking, knew he was holding on too tight, knew tears were starting to form in his eyes, but he couldn’t be bothered to care. Not when he felt Cas’s arms wrap around him, hold him tight and warm and
“Good to see you too, Winchester,” Charlie said. There was no warmth in her voice or truth audible in her words. Dean didn’t particularly care. He turned and started to try and storm downstairs, only to stumble and catch himself on the banister, hissing in pain as the glass twisted in his foot. “What the hell?” Charlie’s voice held more concern this time, and Dean was even more annoyed at that.
No last words, no mystery. No redemption or attempts to save him or get him back. It was just over. He was gone, and Dean felt numb all over again. He wondered if he could’ve saved Garth if he’d been there, if he’d known, if he could’ve gotten there in time. Samantha kept him from spiraling. Some days, she was the only thing that kept him holding on.
“Yeah, no. Fuck that,” Dean muttered. Not that he really had anything against baths, but he was losing every battle so far with Charlie. He at least wanted this one, stupid as it may be.
“Save it,” Dean snapped. He stood from the floor, forcing himself not to look at Cas as he walked past him. “How the hell could you make a deal like that without telling me and Sam?” He asked, turning in the doorway to look back at Cas.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered under his breath. “Can it wait, Sam?” The words came out sharper than he’d intended.
His knuckles showed the wear of the losing fights he’d gotten into more than the brick walls he’d fought against. All those showed were dried smears of blood that he didn’t care enough to clean off. Beer bottles littered the table, until he ran out. Then a couple whiskey bottles joined them.
“I don’t need a business degree, and I don’t need to open a garage. I’m doing fine. If you want me out, I’ll get a job in town, find a new place—“
“I know,” he said quickly. “I just. I want more, I think. And you—I know you’d wanted to carry a child too. They wouldn’t—I mean you’d be their mother as much as I’m the twins’ father, but…” He trailed off, shrugging helplessly. They had talked about it after the twins were born. She and Stevie had wanted two kids. Stevie would carry the first, and Charlie would carry the second. They hadn’t counted on twins, and didn’t think they were equipped to care for three kids.
“You won’t let me,” Dean interrupted her again. It was half true. She wasn’t keeping him on lockdown, but she’d tried her best to keep him sober, and help him through the steps—the fucking steps—and he wasn’t about to let her down. He couldn’t do that to her.
“So why not get a business degree and open your own garage?” Charlie suggested. “Or at least like, take a few classes in management or whatever. You probably don’t actually need to finish the degree to open a garage. Just know how the business side of it works.”
I could practically see the gears in Dean’s mind grind to a halt. He opened his mouth, tried to say something, but nothing came out. I reached out to squeeze his shoulder, offering a smile to the Other Castiel. “Nothing, nothing at all,” I assured him. He turned to look at the Other Dean, eyebrows raised. Even with different demeanors, different expressions they used, I could recognize the silent conversation they were having. Though something was…different. Everything was different that their old world, than Dean and Castiel. But there was something particularly different about the Other Dean and Castiel.
His throat closed up, and he couldn’t even form his brother’s name before their arms were wrapped tight around each other.
“It just does!” Dean snapped at him. He stormed out of the room at the risk of saying any more. Jack had only just left with Chuck, powerless and weak, to go to the empty and try to swing a deal. Dean hoped beyond any kind of rational hope that a powered down former God was enough for her to release Cas from their deal.
“You sure?” The Other Dean asked, his tone harsh and cold. It wasn’t a tone I was used to hearing in my brother’s voice, even if I knew it wasn’t him. He wasn’t Dean, not really. And that angel wasn’t Castiel.
“I don’t like the sound of eventually,” Dean said, picking at the last few fries on his plate. And he wouldn’t see them again. Cas wouldn’t be there. But he didn’t say that. “Feels like wasting time down here, when I could be there with Sam.”
“At least that’s the last bottle I’ll have to clean up,” Sam said. Dean heard the sigh, but he wasn’t looking at his brother, just using to storm past him and go get another beer. It was early, before noon, and he hadn’t been awake long enough to build up anything stronger than a light buzz, and that wouldn’t get him through the day.
Sam didn’t look convinced, but he agreed, and Dean didn’t push the issue. He knew they had a bigger problem in Chuck, but he wasn’t about to let this deal get swept under the rug either. And if Dean knew anything about his brother, it was that he wouldn’t let it go. That was all Dean had been counting on.
“The deal he made with the Empty to save me,” Jack answered. He was still watching Cas, eyes curious and uncertain. He knew the terms of the deal, Dean could see it in his eyes. He was trying to figure out how Cas had summoned the Empty without being taken along with Billie.
“Michael,” a voice said from the other side of the porch. Dean turned a confused look towards Stevie.
Everything still hurt, but nothing was numb. The pain was worse, but the emptiness wasn’t. It was the worst of being drunk and the worst of being hungover combined. Charlie was there, and that helped, even if he didn’t want to admit it. He knew she would leave too, soon. That made it worse, but it was also almost a comfort, in a way. There was comfort in familiar pain. It wasn’t a surprise. It would never be a surprise anymore. People left him, they always did. So he didn’t get attached. He didn’t speak more than was necessary, and stayed in his room mostly.
A small smile curled her lips and she walked towards him, sitting down on the steps beside him. He considered getting up, saying he didn’t want company, and going for a drive, but found that he didn’t mind her company much. Her presence didn’t require as much emotional investment as Charlie’s did. He loved Charlie, no question. But when he didn’t have much energy even for himself, he definitely didn’t have enough for her. Stevie though, he had just enough for her.
“Jack made me an Archangel when he pulled me out of the Empty,” Cas said. Where there had been pride in his expression when he showed Dean his wings, now there was only shame and remorse in his voice.
“There’s a baby monitor in there,” Charlie reminded her, holding up the other half of the set. “Let them sleep. They’ll be awake again soon enough.”
"It is," Cas agreed.  "But I can see that this was important to you, so it's important to me too.  I'll try. I mean, I'm probably not going to be any good at it, but..."
Dean's eyes rolled back and his jaw dropped momentarily, and he quickly tried to reel himself back in.  "I-I'm fine.  Gonna have a shower.  Go to bed."
"Just talk to me for a minute, okay?  Did you hit your head?  I heard a nasty thump as you went down..."
"Yeah," Cas sighed. "I'm sure it will be fine. So, um. What do you like to read?" he asked as he turned to Sam, struggling to make small talk.
For a brief moment, he almost forgot where he was, and as they pulled away, Cas hurriedly hid his face from a dozen pairs of curious eyes. They were the focal point of the room, at the front of the club, but even though he was embarrassed, Cas secretly felt a little thrill kissing Dean in front of all these people.
"Well come on up.  I'm making dinner tonight.  You can nap in my bed or on the couch.  I brought your favorite chocolate-peanut butter cupcakes home from work," he bargained.
"Fuck.  Yeah, Cas," Dean growled against his ear.   "Just let it happen," he purred as he pumped his fist faster.
Dean sighed and shuffled off to the bathroom.  He sighed again as he picked up the clothing on the counter. Well, it looked comfy enough, anyway, he supposed.  He stripped off his shirt and pulled on the bright blue t-shirt, groaning as he looked in the mirror at the cutesy panda and fox hugging on his chest.
"It was like I was still partially in littlespace!" Dean groaned. "I... I don't know how to explain it!  It was weird!"
A million worst case scenarios were already running through his head when he suddenly realized his entire body was warm and tingly. To his surprise, it didn't feel scary; it felt... well, it felt pretty
"Good boy, " Cas whispered. "Come lie down."  He pulled him down onto the bed and wrapped his arms around Dean's trembling body.  "Shhhh, it's okay."
Cas took a deep breath and sighed. "Well... I did okay. I mean, I did alright for an hour or so. Then I started getting really anxious, and I thought I might have a panic attack. So I went to the restroom to calm down."
In the solitary quiet of a bathroom stall, Sam sat and rubbed at his eyes, trying to stop the tears before they could start.  He failed miserably, and two hot tears welled over, starting a chain reaction as they spilled down his cheeks.  Sighing, he blotted them away with a scrap of scratchy toilet paper.   When he was sure they had finally stopped, he stepped out and splashed his face with cold water at the sink.  Checking to make sure he didn't
The stress of losing his wife was too much for the oldest Winchester, and he took his own life soon after.  Dean and his younger brother Sam were placed in state custody, and eventually bounced between a few different foster homes when the first family couldn't handle Dean's anger issues, and a family friend got a little too handsy with Sammy at the second home.
Cas nodded breathlessly. Dean tenderly cupped his balls as he wiped him clean, and just that tiny gesture had Cas ready to explode. When he wrapped his cloth-clad fist around his cock, Cas let out a long, low moan.
"Huh," Dean sighed.  "It's still fuckin' weird.  But I guess we can try it, if that's what you're into."
"If you don't mind... Hey Gabe?  I think I have a date tomorrow," Cas blurted, his face flaming red at the awkward admission.
Cas smiled and shook his head, and selected the movie before settling down onto to the bed next to him. "Can I get you anything else before we start? Do you want popcorn or..."
Cas momentarily lamented the fact that he knew nothing about the sort of music Dean made for a living. Still, music was one thing he was passionate about.  "A lot of things.  I think my tastes are kind of eclectic.  Believe it or not, I listen to a lot of punk music.  The Ramones, Black Flag, Bad Religion, Rancid..."
Cas narrowed his eyes in confusion as he pulled the CD out of the glove compartment.  "How did you get this?" he asked excitedly.  "It doesn't come out for a few weeks yet."
"Of course you did. That doesn't make them bad parents. They were doing what they thought was best for you. Unfortunately it gave you a lot of severe, and in many ways, unrealistic views on sex and relationships. When you start learning these concepts as a child, it forms your entire belief system. So when you get to a point where you start having doubts, or start thinking 'okay, maybe I don't believe that anymore', it can really cause a mental and emotional crisis. It's hard when you realize that what you've been taught all your life isn't necessarily true. For some people, it takes a complete mental breakdown and years of therapy to work through things. All things considered, you're doing very well. I'm very proud of your determination and the steps you've taken. I know it's not easy to do anything at all when you're depressed."
"Oh shit," Dean breathed. He glanced over at the little door, which suddenly looked miles away.  He couldn't ask Cas to skate that far.  "Umm. Alright. Grab my hands," he said, moving in front of him.  "Just keep your body loose and balance, okay?"
The waiter nodded.  "A fine choice.  I have two Gavi de Gavis you may enjoy.  The first is a very refreshing frizzante, very citrusy and light. Quite nice for a casual dinner.  I also have an Etichetta Nera from the La Mesma Estate that is a bit more mature.  It's more acidic and and intense on the palate with some lovely citrus and sage notes."
"I was just headed to work when you pulled in.  Figured I'd harass you first," he grinned, green eyes sparkling in the moonlight. "Alright, I gotta go.  The doughnuts won't make themselves. See you for dinner Thursday, yeah?"
"I'm sure you've heard of Klonopin? And I think you'd benefit more from a daily dosage rather than as needed."
Dean slowly began removing his shirt,  his fingers fumbling over each button as Cas watched intently.  He balled up the sopping shirt and tossed it behind him.  He did the same with his jeans, which he struggled to remove now that they were soaked, and finally, his boxer briefs.
"S'okay, sweetheart," he soothed. "Breathe in deep for me.  Breathe out.  Good.  In... Out.  Good.  Almost there." He continued on a few more feet until the door was within reach."I need you to let go for just a second so I can get the gate," he said softly. "You want the railing?"
Cas reluctantly smiled.  "Yeah, he's alright I guess.  He can cook, so that's a bonus...  How are things there?"  He paused, suddenly shocked at how easily the words were coming for a change.  "When do you get back?"
"And sex isn't dirty.  It's fun and totally normal.  I know you're shy and all, but there's no shame in sexytime between consenting adults.  Nothing wrong with exploring your own body either, FYI."
"Little anxious tonight?" Cas asked as he closed the door.   "I just can't tell which thing you're in the mood for..." he pondered.  "Hmm.  Is it littletime? "
Dean laughed as he began setting up. "Oh, you'll see. Why don't you go grab a drink while I get set up?  That's Sara, the bartender. Just tell her you're with me."
"A little bit," Dean grinned. "Once you're rested up and feeling better, I'm going to demand a private show."
"Mmm," Cas grinned and bit his bottom lip .  "Dean... I don't know what happened earlier today. With uh.  The collar and stuff. I'm not really scared of... I mean, I'm pretty comfortable with things now and I
Dean might be resistant, but Cas knew what was best for his boy.  And tonight, he decided, he'd had enough.   Dean was going to swallow his pride and submit one way or another.
Dean nodded sympathetically.  "It can be a little overwhelming. It's fun though.  If you ever decide you want to go, tell me and we'll go together."
are earplugs?" Cas held up one of the tiny, rubber-tipped metal plugs on a cord that looked more like a set of earbud headphones than the foam earplugs he was used to.
"Good," Dean whispered.  The sight of Cas stark naked and standing in his bedroom was almost overwhelming, and his dick was already weeping with precum. "Tell me your safeword again."
"Good.  I want you to feel good tonight.  But I also don't want you to forget who you belong to," Dean purred.
"Wanna be inside you, Cas," Dean purred as he knelt between Cas's legs, bending his knees and spreading them wide.  He slid his hands firmly up and down his inner thighs and Cas began writhing on the bed. "You look so good right now. Love watching you get all hot and flustered and horny for me."
.  Jesus!"  His face reddened as Cas stared at him, dark blue eyes seemingly boring through to his soul.
"That's it.   Just relax for me.  Take a deep breath, " Dean  insisted.  "No more bad thoughts tonight."  He worked his thumbs into the knots near his shoulder blades, eliciting a loud moan from Cas.  "You're not a fuck-up," he murmured.  "You make good decisions.  You are selfless, and kind, and..."
Immediately, Dean pulled back in abject terror, nudging him to turn over and look at him. "Oh god, what happened? I'm sorry, you okay?"
"Not much... Hey, I know I told you I'd be out of town the next few days, but I was thinking -  if you're not busy, maybe we could grab dinner?  I know it's kind of last-minute, but I wanted to see you before I leave."
"Oh!" Cas jolted in surprise as Dean's hand slipped around his cock, and his back arched involuntarily. "Dean... Why would you want to...  Oh!"  He jerked again as the damp heat of Dean's mouth enveloped him. "Dean!"
Dean pressed a finger to his lips and smiled.  Watching Cas come apart like this was ridiculously sexy, and knowing he could
Cas's breath caught in his throat for a moment, and his face burned with embarrassment. He still felt a weird sense of guilt and shame over being off work for the next few months, and he just couldn't mention it to Dean just yet. "Um.  Yeah.  I'm off today," he murmured.
Still unable to look him in the eyes, Cas shook his head angrily.  "I-I don't know.  I woke up here. Crowley.  I think he's using me as bait to get you here, Dean.  Did you scour the house?"
"Ohh god," Dean murmured, burying his face in Cas's neck.  "I don't know what's worse - you talking to him, or him wondering for the rest of his life."
Dean wasn't sure what to make of this admission.   Cas was still clinging to him like he was never letting go, and it frightened him how fragile he suddenly felt.  He was always so stoic, even in the face of tragedy, and this clingy, weepy side of him was startling, to say the least.
.   Within seconds, his heart was racing so fast it felt hard to breathe.  He closed his eyes and leaned against the counter to steady himself, taking some long, deep breaths.  Almost immediately, sweat began pouring down his face and he was starting to feel faint.  In desperation, he picked up the phone and buzzed Charlie's extension.
"Dean?  What's going on?" Sam asked from his usual spot at the library table.  He was buried among a stack of papers and books, and he looked alarmed as Dean thundered past him.
I know, I know.  It's been forever.  Life has been kicking my ass. On the bright side, the chapters for this one are 8-10x longer than my usual, which is why they're taking longer these days. I never intended for this one to go on so long - hell, I think I've hit 'novel' status with this one - but here we are!  I haven't responded to the comments on the last chapter yet, but each one damn near made me cry.  So glad you're all still liking it. Thanks, all.
Laughing, Dean gratefully accepted his drink. "Just frustrated, " he muttered. "Uh, sexually.  It's been a while. But let's not get into that," he said, rolling his eyes at his own whining.
Dean grinned and nuzzled against his cheek.  "Mmmhmm.  And there's lots more where that came from..." He rested his head on Cas's shoulder, and possessively ran a hand up and down his torso.  "...Cas?"
Dean's knees buckled as Cas began kissing up the side of his neck. He'd been with a lot of women, but he'd never felt so helpless as he did with Cas.  Even though he was still navigating his way through this new territory, all Cas had to do was suggestively wiggle an eyebrow at him and Dean was ready to throw himself at his feet. It was disconcerting, in the best possible way.
"It's all so pretty," Cas sighed as he looked out at the sparkling tree and dozens of skaters making their way across the ice. He shed his black peacoat and wrung his hands in an attempt to warm them up."I didn't think they'd have skating hours this late," he pondered.
"I know. You're pretty headstrong. I love that about you," Dean smiled. "But I also love when you go all soft and submissive for me..."
The thought echoed through Cas's head as he kicked the blanket off and stared at his alarm clock.  It was already two in the afternoon, and after tossing and turning all night, he'd slept most of the day away.   He must have looked pretty pathetic this morning, because even Gabriel had suggested he go back to sleep.
"So, Dean," Gabriel said as he set plates of spaghetti and meatballs down in front of him and Cas, "I've met you a few times, but I don't really know you." He turned around to grab his own plate and returned to the table. "You met Cas at the library, huh?"
"Being human is really scary sometimes," Cas blubbered aimlessly.  "There are things I never had to think about before..."
"Yeah, well, you're not bad yourself.  So uh.  Are we really doing this?" he asked again, making absolutely certain that he wasn't totally confused by this new arrangement.
Dean looked over at Cas, still grinning from ear to ear. "You're amazing, you know that?" he whispered.
Dean was tearing up a bit himself now.  "Cas," he said gently, lowering himself onto the floor.  "Look, I know you feel bad right now, but this feeling will pass.  We've just been through so much in the past few years..." he fumbled.   "It's okay to cry it out, but you can't just give up."
"He won't."  Cas slipped his free arm around Dean's waist and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.  "Come on." He took his hand and led them back to the library.
"Holy shit," Dean panted.  "I haven't had this much fun in a long time, Cas," he gasped, struggling weakly to sit up.
Sam and Dean arrived home late as usual, and Cas was sure to have pizza waiting when they arrived, kept warm with the help of a little angel mojo.
"Shhh. Breathe.  Imagine you're smelling a rose," Cas said, using one of his favorite visualizations.  "Good," he said as Dean took a deep breath in through his nose.  "Hold it.  Now blow out the candle." Dean exhaled his breath through his mouth.  "Again.  Smell the rose. Hold. Blow out the candle." He continued on, stroking his hair and whispering little affirmations as Dean tried to gain control of his racing heartbeat.  As he sat there, doing his best to comfort him, his hand brushed against his cheek, and he realized that Dean was crying big, silent tears.  He frowned, but said nothing, continuing to focus on his breathing. God, how he wished there was something he could do.
