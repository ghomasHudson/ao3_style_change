They sink back into a twitching, sticky tangle, panting and smiling at each other with a perfect mixture of delight and embarrassment. The storm has taken the heat with it and skin that is exposed to the cool air of John’s bedroom is quickly drawn back under the duvet where it is cosy. Unwilling to make a dash for the bathroom quite yet, John dozes with the grounding weight of Sherlock comforting against his side.
Of course, there’s nothing there, only crisp, dark pillowcases and, rolling his eyes at himself, John closes the drawer. Opening the top one, John finds the infamous sock index and pulls it out for a better look. It is a precision system, all the pairs are folded to the same size and laid on end, in rows. The vast majority of Sherlock's socks are black, fine knit and probably stupidly expensive. There are a few dark navy pairs for variety (except not really because John can only tell they are blue because they are lined up next to the black ones, other than that they are just as dark.) Feeling justified, he picks up a pair of the blue socks and a pair of the black socks and swaps them over, enjoying what he hopes Sherlock will interpret as chaos.
Mrs Hudson must have picked up on the sudden quiet, and she changes topic, turning to John. “Did you find something for Sherlock’s parents, dear? I know you were looking.”
happening, and John cannot squash the sensation. It lodges under his ribs and flutters in his stomach.
"I was counting on being home in time to surprise you," Sherlock says softly, his voice going low already.
John sleeps better than he thought he would and wakes with a feeling of calm contentment. He often has morning wood first thing, so isn’t concerned when he’s already aroused as he drifts towards consciousness, but as soon as he remembers where he is it’s an altogether more delicate matter. He can’t just take care of it this morning as he can at home, either in the shower or, if all is quiet downstairs and he feels he has the time, in a leisurely and indulgent manner on his bed. A quick glance across to Sherlock’s bed confirms that his roomie is already awake and they smile awkwardly at each other. He feels refreshed and alert after a deep, dreamless night, but unavoidably attuned to the proximity of Sherlock and it’s going to take John some time to will the damn hard-on  away.
John finds a long-fingered hand cupping his jaw and lifting his face so a determined looking Sherlock can take a kiss from his lips. Sherlock kisses with intent, focussed and grave. And if this is his choice, then John needs to show him at once what this can be – what they already are and more.
“Well if you drive me to distraction in pyjamas and wild with the urge to mess you up when you’re in a suit, I’m only giving you more ways to make you irresistible to me.”
It’s still an utter disaster. It’s the last moment of his life with John and the first without him. It has to be.
Sherlock looks up at him and wonders at the miracle of John Watson. A chance encounter in a chaotic universe had put them together – provided the answer to each other’s questions, the fulfillment of each other’s shortcomings. The odds against meeting the one person on the planet who can see beyond the persona and recognise his hidden heart despite the deflections and the obstacles are incalculable. For that person to then love him in the same way that he is learning to love John is nothing short of miraculous.
“Sir, you shouldn’t be here,” says the older woman in an odd voice that isn’t quite a whisper, but will brook no argument.
how it was and pointedly put her coat on. “I’m off out for a couple of hours then,” she said, opening the door. “Will that be long enough?”
Sherlock doesn’t need to dig for that memory at all, or any memory so closely linked with John. It was the first time they’d shared a meal although, being on a case, he hadn’t actually ordered anything. John had surprised him with his willingness to be placed in unknown danger and with his direct approach to finding out the things he wanted to know. It had been… refreshing. He’d asked if Sherlock had a girlfriend and when he’d replied in the negative, had gone on to ask about a boyfriend. And Sherlock, being the idiot that he is, had made it uncomfortable and embarrassing with a terse response and an awkward rebuff of John’s naive (and instantly denied) advances.
She picks up their cups and carries them to the sink to wash later. For now she puts on her coat and scarf, fetches her handbag and makes a mental list of what she will need for this evening.
Sentiment is making a fool of him. He is at the mercy of John’s words, this strange evening and his own long-ignored attraction. He fights for some semblance of control as John continues.
The mantel clock ticks out ninety interminable seconds of quiet and Sherlock concludes that John’s piece is said.
Not that this isn’t a brilliant place to wake up, but John feels he might benefit from a few moments of quiet to balance himself and to start thinking how to get Sherlock here in his bed again, but in better circumstances.
Other people might not catch the sarcasm in Mycroft's tone, but John has lived with Sherlock long enough to understand the other level of this conversation and decides to brazen it out. (After he has finished blushing about thoroughly debauching Mycroft's little brother while everyone was arriving, that is.)
Surprised and pleased, John settles into his chair and stretches his feet to the fire. They watched this film last month and John thought that Sherlock had slept through most of it, but apparently he’d been listening. John cannot stop his contented smile, as happy as he’s been in months. This might not be what he’d imagined for his life as a younger man, but it’s immeasurably more than he’d expected after his return from Afghanistan.
“John is invaluable to my work,” Sherlock corrects Crispian coolly, surprising John who was expecting to have to field that one. “More than that, he is invaluable to me personally.”
He barely had time to take in the leather upholstery or the tasteful décor before Sherlock had slammed the door behind them and was on him, crowding him, stalking him further into the vehicle.
"Hold still, you daft bugger, " John growls and finally Sherlock catches on, sliding ungracefully but safely down John's body.
It never snows on Christmas Eve in England. The white Christmas that everyone sings about is practically a myth; something that happens once in a lifetime if at all, and John cannot even remember more than a hard frost or a spell of sleety rain that had filled him with hope as a child before disappointing him. Not only that but he has never seen such a lot of snow, already making it hard to see far, the house and the church indistinct shadows betrayed only by their lights. It is settling already, turning the path and the grass verges to sparkling white. Perhaps this is the feeling that John has been having for the last two days. Perhaps the anticipation of this perfect sight has been what has made him so certain that something was going to happen. Perhaps he'd subconsciously heard a weather report or seen a headline that, while it hadn't stuck in his mind, had registered enough for him to expect this.
Sherlock takes a tiny peck at the fragrant red sauce that coats the spoon held to his mouth. John looks at him expectantly and Sherlock slowly licks all traces of it from his lips and lets the complexity of the flavours develop before he swallows. Tomato, balsamic vinegar, onion – no, shallots – and tarragon.
This time it was unmistakably Sherlock’s neck with the scatter of moles that John could still feel the texture of on his tongue. And draped around that perfect throat were his army identity tags that
And suddenly they cannot hold it back any longer ; they are giggling like idiots - knowing they shouldn't, but unable to stop the swell of mirth that bubbles up and causes them to shake with inappropriate laughter. Every time one of them manages to stop, the other grins and off they go again. Mummy and Father are looking at them with mild alarm, which sets off another gale of chuckles until they are both breathless and teary, at which point Mummy informs them that she had no idea that donkeys were so amusing and that they need to be ready in ten minutes.
Sherlock jerks at John's arm again. This wasn’t in any of the recounts he’s seen, not in this context at least. There’s more to this, but John’s eyes skitter away and Sherlock growls in frustration, his breaths hitching as he tries to howl past the stupid, irrational idiocy that prevents him from questioning John more closely. That it’s his own mind that is stealing away his words is humiliating and infuriating.
John finds himself at the door, his presents and Sherlock’s safely in a carrier bag to take upstairs. Mrs Hudson indicates the mistletoe pinned above the threshold to her flat since he was in here earlier and pointedly presents her cheek for a kiss, which John is happy to oblige her with.
The smell of baking, which has been distracting him all afternoon with hints of sweetness and spice is stronger here outside Hudders’ door, but still not overwhelming – strange as it’s been creeping into the very furthest corners of their flat. For a former exotic dancer and a daytime television aficionado, Mrs Hudson does know her way around a kitchen, Great British Bake-Off not withstanding.
John fucked him as slowly as he could stand to, but still found himself about to come within a couple of minutes. He crossed his arms over Sherlock’s waist, pulled him upright on his lap and pushed up into him with trembling thighs as he came deep, sweet and gasping inside him.
"Ah, John. I was just looking for Crispian." Mycroft looks between John and Sherlock and raises his eyebrows in something that looks surprised and pleased for a second before it's gone and his familiar supercilious expression reasserts itself.
“Okay, let’s go and meet the programmers now – these guys are the brains of the company and they are all very focussed on bringing our latest projects to the marketplace, so we mostly just let them get on with it,” Steve smiled as if he’d made a clever quip. “Just be warned; their workspace is rather, uh… individual.”
The first image was a little dark and it was hard to see in the artificial light of Tesco’s biscuit aisle. John tipped the screen this way and that before he recognised the edge of a lampshade, which made that their bedroom. So why was Sherlock sending him photos of his…shoulder and throat… except what was he wearing around his…?
The bitter wind is making the bare branches whisper, dry and staccato as the strings of light bounce and bob and John's shoulders are hunched against it.  His face is so familiar and dear to him and he never could hide an emotion, so Sherlock sees all too easily the self-recrimination in the line of his lips, the regret in the tilt of his chin and the hope in the flicker of his eyes. They both stand with their hands pushed deep in the pockets of their coats and their gazes locked. John shifts his weight but refuses to look away. His bravery in this is breathtaking - Sherlock knows how uncomfortable he is and that he doesn't enjoy talking about his feelings any more than he does himself, but he is unwavering in this. His contradictions confuse and fascinate Sherlock - they always have. Here is a crack shot who has taken lives, who is also a former trauma surgeon dedicated to saving the injured and broken. Here is an army veteran who believes in the process of diplomacy and conversation, however hard he finds it himself. Here is a solitary man who longs to make a life with another, a private man who stands for Sherlock's scrutiny and a man who has spit venom at any who dared to question his heterosexuality, now asking his former, very male lover for a second (third, fourth, fifth) chance.
“I’ve had worse,” Sherlock assures him, so John accepts that and just concentrates on how, despite all the discomfort, he’d stay here forever if he could find an excuse to.
With his back to the door, Sherlock finds himself edging away until he's far enough from John's gravity. He turns, his coat flicking out dramatically in his haste to leave. He doesn't look back for fear of what he might see, or what he might do on seeing it.
John shifts his knees and flops back onto the bed, wiping the incriminating evidence off on Sherlock’s posh bedding. Covering his eyes with his clean(er) hand, he laughs between gasps for air. His heart hasn’t even stopped trying to beat its way out of his ribcage yet.
Hitching his thumbs into the waistband, John paused to appreciate the true beauty that was Sherlock Holmes’s arse in jeans. Only the fact that he knew what lay beneath the denim caused him to cut short his ruminations and draw them slowly down over Sherlock’s hips and tug them to sit snugly under said gorgeous arse.
What else can John do? He nudges forward and presses his lips to Sherlock’s who freezes for a second, and then parts for him with a soft breath, letting John slip the tip of his tongue along the slick silk of his lower lip. It's a rush, it's intoxicating and John wants to spend years cataloguing the differences between Sherlock's lips and the smooth heat of his tongue. But first...
John clears his throat and he’s wearing the hesitant smile that means he knows that something is going on but hasn't actually caught the message yet.
Sherlock startles; he stumbles back and into the kitchen, the present intruding on the impossibility before him.
“You don’t look tired. In fact… ahhh,” Sherlock breathed, a dark smirk tugging his lips to the right. “The jumper. This is another one of those normal people clothing things – you really do like me to dress down, don’t you?”
The night of John's wedding had probably been the lowest point of his life, and that's from a man who has overdosed three times. He'd buried everything that day behind the veneer of being Sherlock Holmes - it was what everyone had expected to see, so that part hadn't been hard. But earlier that day he had been the Sherlock Holmes watching the dawn creep into his room like a thief, stealing the last minutes that John could ever conceivably be thought of as his. He'd been the Sherlock Holmes looking into John's eyes when he’d woken with a brief soft smile on his lips before he'd registered the time and the day and the circumstances of him being at Baker Street in Sherlock's bed.
He shrugs into his coat with a quick, painful smile, loops his scarf around his neck and pulls on his gloves. It's ridiculous, but he feels better, more like himself. Now he looks like Sherlock Holmes - Consulting Detective again, recognisably a genius, high functioning sociopath with an attitude problem. No one would believe, looking at him now, that he could also be the man he was with John. Unguarded. Vulnerable.
Sherlock says nothing, watching his reaction then turns to pick a new spatula and take a scoop from the second jar, a much paler offering. John breathes it in and smells floral, herbal and medicine notes. The flavour is brighter than the other two he has tried. He can still taste the herb notes, but there’s a dried fruit element that is delicious.
John quirks a smile when he hears the toilet flush a minute later and feels a little sorry for whoever is on surveillance duty today.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at the obnoxious smirk that his cousin wears for his benefit. The man is a complete idiot and his subtle implication that this was Sherlock's plan to woo John is both insulting and largely correct.
Mummy, Father, Mycroft, Uncle Oswin and Crispian are already at the kitchen table with cups of coffee and tea. Odelia and Robert complete the house party, walking in behind them. Predictably they are all smiles and Sherlock's eyes can't help but drift to the direct look on Crispian's face as his gaze bounces from him to John and back again.
They arrived to stay with Hugh and Violet (as they insist he call them) yesterday. Sherlock drove them down to the family home in Dorset in a hired car. There’s to be some kind of family party, John is given to understand. That’s why he and Hugh have been sent off to the local town to collect flower arrangements while Sherlock, Mycroft and his mother organise caterers, chairs, garden lights, bottles and glasses. When the Holmeses throw a party, they really don’t spare attention to detail, it seems to John, which makes it all the more surprising that Sherlock agreed that they would come.
"Ah, what a shame," Mycroft says with no glimmer of sympathy or honesty. "Mummy was hoping he would be able to join us for carolling tonight."
"That's why humans invented questions," John growls. "When humans want to know things about other humans they bloody well ask questions. They don't wait until they're alone and then riffle through the other human's stuff.”
His orgasm is a tangible impending event, he can feel it already begin to uncoil low in his belly, but there is no hurry, no urgency to it when they share like this. It’s why Sherlock loves to wake up early, like this. He hums his pleasure and…
"You know, they invented ladders thousands of years ago. There's probably a reason for that," John sighs almost convincingly, but complies, guiding Sherlock's waving boot to his shoulder and taking his weight again as he stretches up, and with a sickening ratchetted snip he cuts a chunk out of the mistletoe.
"It is quite possibly the best idea I have ever had... and that is saying rather a lot... I have an extensive history of good ideas." Sherlock tells him, losing track once or twice as he finds a particularly arresting piece of John to nibble or kiss.
Or perhaps, and somehow this is worse, Sherlock is indeed John's greatest friend, but perhaps Crispian has something that Sherlock lacks; some undefined quality that makes him a potential mate and that forever relegates Sherlock to the role of quirky best friend. Looked at objectively, it is easy to see that Crispian with his easy charm and his good looks, not to mention his international musical reputation and lifestyle, make him a much more attractive potential partner for a man like John. The fact that John has insisted on several occasions that he was not gay does not negate the truth that he does find men attractive and has simply not acted upon it. Perhaps what Sherlock has been interpreting as John's growing awareness of himself is actually John learning to understand his own sexuality and become comfortable enough with it to experiment with it a little. Of course someone uncomplicatedly gay but not at all camp like Crispian would appeal to a recently confirmed bisexual man like John.
"You should try having my birthdate. I was born on the 6th of January; twelfth night. It's the date..."
This is not turning out the way Sherlock had planned at all. First his parents have changed the large double bed in his old bedroom for two tiny twin beds, neither of which is large enough for two grown men to fit in, regardless of whether one of them is more diminutive than the other, so even if he did engineer some mishap that rendered one of the beds unusable, it would just mean one of them spending a night on the sofa or on the floor - neither of which coincides with Sherlock's aims. And now his dreadful, tedious cousins have commandeered John and they have him cornered by the terrace windows, probably telling lies about Sherlock's childhood.
For a man who has been trapped inside one room for as long as Sherlock thinks he has been, John has been the single variable and, as such, has become the most interesting and vital thing in Sherlock’s life. The John outside these four walls is already his closest friend, a confidante, an aberration in a history of people who have endured him or valued his mind while rejecting his oddness, or, worst of all, pitied him. For this reason, John is already hugely important to Sherlock’s work and fascinating to him on a personal level. But it’s as if he has never
Sherlock blinked up at John tiredly, before his lips slowly creased into a smile. He contentedly dipped his head back down and fell back to sleep.
Just as Sherlock was hurriedly smoothing down his hair in the mirror, Lestrade’s gruff voice could be heard climbing the stairs.
He had argued half-heartedly with John about burning the thing instead, but ultimately they had managed to struggle through without killing anyone. It was quite humiliating to be reduced to throwing an instruction manual out the window in frustration, and then sheepishly going all the way outside to pick it up and bring it back, when one was supposedly a genius. John had almost collapsed in his amusement, as Sherlock fought a smile tugging at his lips. The feeling of pride when they had observed the finished thing was surprisingly satisfying, though.
“Yes, yes, I’ll get to that. But can you see anything medically wrong with this skeleton? How did the child die? Was there a struggle? Was he ill?”
“So Euros somehow happened to find a 125 year old skeleton at the bottom of a well near your house, and pretended all these years that she had drowned Victor in it, giving you clues to find it?” John said doubtfully.
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John laying opposite him, watching him with a small smile. His greying hair looked golden in the morning sunlight peeping around the blackout curtains.
“Sherlock… Are you okay? What if Victor isn’t actually dead?” John asked tentatively, concerned but trying not to make the situation worse.
John’s footsteps came down the stairs heavily, obviously carrying Rosie with him. His murmuring became more distinct as he reached the foot of the stairs.
“I do, but I want you to interpret it however you see fit. You can modify it, shift it around, whatever you’d like.”
He unbuckled the chinstrap of his helmet and stored it in the side bag. As he crossed the street, John peeled off his gloves, biting the tip of his middle finger and pulling the rest of his digits out. He jogged into the café just a block from Marylebone and purchased two hot drinks – three shots of espresso in his and an earl grey with two sugars for Sherlock. As he paid and kindly thanked the barista, his nerves began to twist up. Was this idiotic? How unattractive was it, to have someone want to watch you dance? Would he make Sherlock uncomfortable?
“Bet you everyone thinks I want to marry you instead. Pretty sure I sobbed like a child when you and Jane took the aisle.”
“Yes, obviously, except you were in the middle of the desert and had no form of tracking device on your person. It proved to be much more difficult… I’m sorry for the delay.” Though his words were structured, John could feel the self-loathing making its way out into the open. Finding his footing, he stepped forward and stood in front of the tall man. John studied his face; he was exhausted, furious with himself, but underneath all of it, the doctor could see the faintest bits of joy and relief. “I do not deserve you, Sherlock Holmes.”
A weird sound came from Sherlock’s mouth and John thought it might have been a chuckle. A small smile took John’s face.
“The dancing was incredible. He’s so fucking talented, Jane. I can’t get past it. I cried for two hours straight.”
He had an inkling that Sherlock responded unreasonably well to praise. While he had never applied it in a sexual scenario like this one, he could recall from previous conversation the way Sherlock’s demeanor shifted when words of a complementary nature came into play. John was also quite aware that Sherlock enjoyed being taken more than he did taking, though he was truly delectable in either case.
She knew these days. They were cruel and bitter; the tiniest thing could set one in motion: waking up late, foul weather, an argument with a significant other, another bill she couldn’t pay. Normally, she could talk herself out of it. Most days that started poorly got better the minute her feet hit the stage. But if it wasn’t “most days,” the frustration mounted and echoed in every muscle, every thought, every movement, and magnified that thought. It no longer felt like one tiny thing, but a million gargantuan, impossible threats. Those sorts of days were a nightmare; she had never witnessed Sherlock having one.
“I’d like to think so, yes.” He padded softly into the living room, extending a cup of tea. “To take the edge off….” Sherlock smirked, and then gestured towards a chair. John turned towards it and realized it was his chair. Red, and so perfectly worn in. A Union Jack pillow sat in it, dead center. Queen and Country. Tears stung his eyes. He wouldn’t go back. He couldn’t leave this place. This is where he should have been, all along.
Sherlock was following Jim’s every move across the stage. His technical abilities were damn near perfect, as much as he hated to admit it. But he was cold on the stage, and Sherlock could not move past it. He was sterile, feeling nothing, all form and no passion. While the skills were remarkable, he couldn’t picture Moriarty working with Molly, or anyone for that matter. He was a one-man show, and that was not what Sherlock was looking for. He closed the file towards the end of Jim’s dance and, reluctantly, let it sit next to Bill and Soo Lin’s. He would mull over it tonight in his hotel room, with an adult beverage and sweatpants.
Watson chuckled, more to himself than aloud. “It isn’t good for you to be up and out with your arms so fresh. Last thing we need is a newly agitated set of wounds.”
“Honestly, John. Relax.” Sherlock ran his hands across the shoulders of the suit, dismissing tiny bits of lint. “You look great.”
“Hold this?” Sherlock whispered. John reached out and took the bundle of wool fabric. Sherlock began to walk away and John raised his eyebrow, befuddled. And then Sherlock turned round to face him. He was certainly facing only John, as his eyes were boring into his: pale, devious, flirtatious. John licked his lips.
John rolled his eyes and popped the cookie into his mouth. “Your go.” John muted the telly and stuffed his hands into his pyjama pockets as Sherlock opened his fortune cookie. The tiny paper was unfolded in his fingers and the detective froze.
It was impossibly unhurried. John’s heart was steady and strong in his chest. Everything was perfectly in focus and simultaneously blurred around the edges. The cream fabric hit the floor and Sherlock was moving away from him, looking over his shoulder, beckoning John to follow. Sherlock toed out of his trainers in the sitting room on the way to the hall, the sleeveless shirt flung carelessly in an open bedroom, and as he arrived at the bathroom door, he held John’s eyes as his hands addressed the button and zip of his denim. Sherlock tugged his feet from the tight jeans, his whole body standing and filling the frame of the doorway.
Molly stepped onto the stage dressed in practice garb: a loose gray sweatshirt and pale pink tights. “You wanted to see me, Sherlock?”
Sherlock felt the air leave his lungs. He stood, running the heel of his hand across his hard on. John’s eyes were on fire. He waved Sherlock to the bed and pulled the now warm seat across the room and settled into it, prepared for a show. John sat lax in his chair, knees lazily spread, arms crossed around his chest, his face smug as hell. Sherlock could eat him alive, if only Watson would allow it.
John’s boots crunched onto the sand of the Afghanistan tarmac. A heat wave welcomed him, hovering feet above the cement, distorting the landscape. Or maybe not. Maybe nothing had to make sense anymore. Maybe the hard substance could dissolve and erode away under enough heat. John hoped he would.
“God help me, Sherlock.” John’s breath ghosted across Sherlock’s lips, his left hand now wound tightly in the shirt under Sherlock’s jacket. “You were perfect.” He dropped a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s mouth. “You are perfect.”
John sat in the center of the bed, wearing only his pants and a thick, military inspired watch on his left wrist. His hands were clasped and resting in his lap, his eyes glinting. Sherlock had insisted on cleaning the kitchen and shooed John upstairs. For that, he would be punished. Or rewarded. Either way, the end result would essentially be the same. He rubbed his wrist along the stiffening flesh of his cock.
“Yes ma’am… I am.” Jane reached for the woman’s hand and felt the burn of tears welling at the corners of her eyes and the flinch of her throat closing, stinging. “I am so sorry, Mrs. Evans.” She felt John next to her, strong and comforting, as he clutched her shoulder firmly. The woman across from her returned the gesture, gripping at Jane’s hand until the skin at her knuckles turned white. The smile on her face was small, defeated.
Sherlock laughed. “He is the best Scotland Yard has, but he acknowledges my skill set and is wise enough to remember he needs me. More often than not, he is accommodating.”
Sherlock knocked on John’s door, three raps evenly spaced. He took a step back and typed out a message on his mobile. He heard the heavy shifting of the door opening, and glanced up. He felt his chest collapse at the sight of John, awkwardly hovering inside the door.
. Soon his eyes were wet with mirth. “No, Cap. Seriously. You are seeing him? Damn. DAMN.” Rhys paused for moment. “Think you can get me in with the girl?”
“This is our life.” John stated matter of factly. “There is nothing safe about it. I’m a retired solider, you’re a genius who solves murder cases. Tell me why it’s fair for us to expect an ordinary, peaceful life.”
“Yes, actually. Damn good. Probably better than me, but don’t you dare tell him that.” John took a sip of his soda and set it down on the coaster, tugging some of Sherlock’s blanket over his knees.
“Yeah, I recognized him. How’d you drag this guy here, Shezza? Tie him up in the boot?” She stuck her hand out after wiping the sweat of her palms on her pants. “Pleased to meet the best looking hooker I’ve ever seen.” John chuckled, Sherlock blushed, and Chachi gave a stern and strong handshake.
“Sherlock’s Night Out, a tale narrated by John Watson.” The blonde gave a gentle laugh and winked at the man across from him.
John turned to his taller half and smiled. “I’m glad you could make it out, too.” Without thinking, he reached up and gave Sherlock’s right arm a squeeze, just below the shoulder. It was an oddly affectionate gesture for John, and his eyes widened a bit at his own action. Sherlock’s expression shifted to one of curiosity and amusement.
The steam poured out into the warmth of the hallway, and John led the way to the bedroom. The worn, Persian rug was soft beneath their damp, bare feet. John gave Sherlock a gentle push onto the bed. He placed one knee between Sherlock's two, and pressed his hand flat against his chest. Sherlock smiled, a different one tonight, a new one, soft and encouraging and brave. John felt warmth blossom deep in his ribcage. His hands bracketed Sherlock's tangled hair, nearly long enough now to fan out across a pillow. John's arms bent at the elbows, lowering to kiss Sherlock's Adam's apple, the sharpest line of his cheekbones, the soft, fluttering skin of his eyelids, the red, swollen warmth of his lips. He felt Sherlock's hips rock up against his thigh. Sherlock kissed the gasp straight from John’s mouth, his hands untamed and wandering across all of John's flesh.
John had grown accustomed to wandering around the desert again. The numbness he felt when leaving London rolled over easily here, like unused mobile minutes. He felt little and said even less.
Callum trotted up the stairs, resting his freshly-shaven chin on Molly’s shoulder. “Yes, we are, in fact. Particularly me!”
“Well, yeah… he doesn’t have many friends, you see, or family, so he stays quite busy with other things.” John found that hard to believe. Sherlock didn’t seem particularly off-putting. Why didn’t he have friends? “He solves cases for NSY. Sometimes. If he’s available.”
Inside the envelope were three Polaroid snapshots. John thumbed them lovingly, in complete awe at the raw, sentimental punch these gave him. Sherlock had taken photos… just to remember something that had happened. Not only that, but all three were photos of John, and they were stunning. Not in reference to looks or appeal, of course, but in the way Watson had been captured.
John's words tumbled around in his mind. He imagined Harriet to be a great deal like Jane: someone gentle, loving, kind, strong. A woman with a fire in her eyes and ferocity in her heart. An overwhelming sense of "yes, this is me, hope that's quite alright. And sod off, if it's not." Someone with a good reading voice and when the sun hits their hair, it glitters like the sun and those eyes. Those oceanic, penetrating eyes. Harry would have been the female version of John.
Molly leaned in and kissed Callum on the cheek. “Please be safe, my love.” She nuzzled her cold, red nose into his neck and wrapped her arms around his neck. He gave her a tight squeeze, lifting her slippered feet off the ground, and kissed her fully on the mouth. Callum gave her a wink, stroked the side of her face with his fingers, and headed toward the bus. “Love you, Mols. See you soon.”
The phone rang. And rang. And rang. B didn’t answer. She ended the call, sighed, and dialed again. After four failed attempts, she slammed the cabinet door shut and grabbed the Makers from the top of the fridge. “Of all the times to not answer your fucking mobile, B,” she muttered as she changed into a pair of TARDIS pajamas, taking a swig of whiskey between each article of clothing shed and replaced.
Holmes turned on his heels to face his friend. He was beautiful on a stage; his height and dark features were a lovely contrast to the openness of the auditorium that surrounded him. His chin rested in the navy holster that joined with his violin. There was something so calming, so submissive about this stance for Sherlock. The expanse of his neck was left vulnerable and unprotected. It was so different from his normal body language. His eyebrows were bowed in curiosity.
He reached out and traced a strand of her hair between his fingers. “Your hair is straight. I like it.”
What was my speech again? Shit. He took the mic, and Jane gave him an encouraging smack on the ass as he stood from his chair. She passed him the telegrams first:
Sherlock closed the curtain and returned to his shower. John stood in awe a few moments longer, then left the bathroom, trousers a bit tighter than before.
“Morning.” Sherlock drawled from behind the shower curtain. John’s face was greeted with a blast of hot and sticky air.
“Well I want to know when you do. And tell me when the tickets for his next performance go up. I don’t want to miss that for anything.”
“Most certainly not. I would never do such a thing, would I Callum?” Callum chuckled behind them on the couch, where Molly was wrapped up next to him.
John glanced up from arranging rice on their plates to find Sherlock studying him. John thought by now the detective would be biting back laughter, but he looked perplexed and curious.
John woke in a fit of tears, his heart thudding recklessly in his chest. He panicked, unfamiliar with his surroundings. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to control his breathing. Opening them again, he realized he was in 221b, wrapped up in his own flannel sheets. They felt too luxurious against his skin… too soft, too kind, compared to the rough canvas of his cot back… home? No, that wasn’t home. He felt a stab of sickness at the fact that he had even rolled the word over his tongue. He shed the covers and lightly stepped onto the hardwood, deciding on making a cuppa until he could settle himself again.
John tips his chin up and purses his lips. Mycroft has outstayed his welcome, such as it was. And now he is stepping dangerously close to the limits of John’s patience.
He wants to say more because there is so much to say if he could only say it safely, but these seem to be the only words that he can speak with any confidence. Tears prick his eyes but don’t fall as he presses the words into the air around John’s sleeping body hoping that some of them might break through into his dreams.
A week later and Sherlock is intent on overcoming his lapse in good sense, Mrs Hudson’s wistful smiles notwithstanding. Now that John has seen him and apologised, just as his therapist suggested, Sherlock considers it most likely that his part in John Watson's life story is at an end. John has what he needed - absolution through his sorrowful words. He didn't even want Sherlock's hollow forgiveness, for what it was worth. John is free of Sherlock and Sherlock is as free of John Watson as he will ever be. He is focussed on relearning how to be alone since the short, ill-judged trip to the nondescript cafe undid much of the progress he had made since July. He is trying to fill his days and his attention to stop his mind straying into old patterns.
“Too much?” John whispered, bravely preparing himself to ease out of the tightest, hottest most fuckable place he’d ever been.
"I... I don't deserve a second chance, I know that and... If I knew then what I know now, if I had faced up to all the lies and the shame and the justifications I fed myself when I was with you..." John sighs and tips his head back to face the sky.
“What? And risk another put down? Besides, as I got to know you, I thought that maybe you weren’t into anything physical. All that stuff about transport and chemical defects.”
At last the song is done and Martha watches as the last phrases of it dissipate, trickling away like sparks along the ceiling, fading into the shadows of the corners of her sitting room and sinking trills into the floorboards, leaving an echo singing down through her skin and into her bones, warm and comforting. It wasn’t a summoning she’d sung before and it had taken very easily, which probably had more to do with the two idiots who lived upstairs than with the complexity of the charm. Half of it had been common sense, with hardly a hint of craft to it. Put any other two people who had shared so much and who obviously loved each other as deeply as John and Sherlock did and she wouldn’t have needed to do anything – they would have sorted it out for themselves. But if there was a way of making his fate difficult, then her Sherlock could find it. She’d expected better things of John Watson though – he’d seemed such a practical chap. But they’d both turned out to be woefully dim in this case.
There are shelves at the top of one side and there's something in here that smells woody and spicy; John recognises it from the scent of Sherlock himself. Under the shelves, which seem to be filled with elements of Sherlock's disguises (a high-vis jacket, some chef's whites, a pair of jodhpurs and a pro polo shirt for starters) are some drawers similar to the ones you used to find in old-fashioned menswear shops, more dark wood and strong shapes.
“We could,” Sherlock agrees and sounds ridiculously pleased at the idea, “but let’s light these candles first.”
“Wear the suit, wear your bathrobe, wear your most horrific cardigan, wear nothing at all, I couldn't care less,” Sherlock says, gesturing to the room at large. “But if you would be so kind, I would like to marry you, if you’ll have me - later on today if convenient.”
It's too much, and having been somewhat keyed up already, it isn't long before John is rising onto his toes, trying to force more of himself into Sherlock's firm fist. He's so close,
“Sherlock would say anything if he thought that was what you wanted, dear,” Martha says, softly now.
"Apparently so. Hateful isn't it?" Sherlock says with a slow, self-deprecating smile. "You bring out my inner romantic, it would seem."
“Look.” John’s voice is beginning to lose its patient smoothness. “This isn’t you,” he asserts. “We’re close, best friends and you’re confusing that with… I don’t know…” John can’t find the right word and gestures towards the bed in frustration. “It’s not your fault. Your injury…”
Ripping his lips from Sherlock’s, who was panting very prettily now, John reached down to undo the offending garment. Once again, the material thwarted him, folding and sagging unhelpfully as John tried to work the zip.
Sherlock waits a few beats, his eyes sliding from left and right when John doesn’t leap in to fill the conversational gap.
Sherlock looked up and just for a second as he came to stand in front of him, John got a glimpse of the pain and confusion in his eyes. It was an expression he'd rarely, if ever, seen on the brilliant, assured man's face before, so it took John a few seconds to place it. But by the time he had, Sherlock had recovered his cool reserve.
John is still asking banal questions of his cousin when Mycroft takes a seat at the piano. He looks across to Sherlock, his eyes flicking to John and Crispian for a split second before coming back to rest on Sherlock to greet his gaze with his blandest expression. Mycroft's lips quirk slightly as he tilts his head, inviting Sherlock to join him.
Shivering, Sherlock began to rock again, pushing himself through John’s fist or driving John’s cock deep within him. John scissored the fingers of his other hand and rubbed them against Sherlock’s hole where he was impaled on John. The slight prickle of the wool on his forearms and chest was like tiny, hot sparks against his oversensitive skin.
"Can we sit? Just for a minute? I'm making a right mess of this," John asks, as Sherlock knew he would.
"I wouldn't miss it," John smiles, still scanning the garden for Sherlock as politely as he can. Molly is a good friend and John somehow feels that he has a lot of making up to do for how Sherlock used to spurn her advances - he clearly had no interest in her in that respect, but he had been so blunt about his lack of interest.When it became common knowledge that he and Sherlock were together he had half expected Molly to cool towards him, but she hadn’t and John is grateful for that.
“Right, well, thank you for being so understanding about this, Sherlock. And I assure you that I don’t expect anything to change between us…”
Finding it increasingly difficult to contain his low mood, Sherlock comforts himself by standing too close to John when he knocks on Mrs Hudson’s door that evening, berating himself for his weakness even as he relishes the brush of John’s shoulder against his own. The last four months have been a similar sweet torment, having John back at 221B, sharing space again without the complication of the wife to be placated or considered.
“Because I know that I would rather die myself than ever lose him again and whatever place in my life he chooses will be
When the dessert has been cleared, Sherlock's father stands up and makes a very pretty speech about spending his birthday with so many people he loves and with such a talented group. John smiles and feels increasingly out of place as it becomes clear that Sherlock's dad is, in fact, a very highly regarded musician and that many of the people who he is sharing a table with are famous names in their respective fields. If they are not family, then they all seem to be involved in the performing arts in some way; a couple of opera singers, a specialist in medieval music, a composer - the list goes on, all the information provided sotto voce by Sherlock or Crispian.
Equally, of course, he hasn’t made any mention of wishing to stay or having had a change of heart about his marriage despite their difficulties in the aftermath of the Leinster Gardens revelations.
“I understood that you appreciated our partnership, but despite what I thought, your reasons were never stated. I don’t mean to sound callous, but you would never let anyone labour under the misapprehension that we might be…more. So if I wondered, on occasion, if what you felt for me might be something other than you had admitted or even realised, I accepted that it wasn’t something you would ever want to explore in any way that might lead to…”
And surely there was only so much that a red-blooded man in his prime could be expected to take? So when Sherlock’s thumbnail grazed the inseam of the denim all the way up to where the tightness of the material left very little to the imagination, John pounced. He wasn’t proud, but no man should have to endure such torment.
"Just give him a minute. Since when are you so keen to do chores?" John laughs. He seems happy and relaxed and Sherlock doesn't know if that's the Christmas spirit making him so cheerful or something else; possibly the inordinate amount of time he took in the bathroom that morning which had inevitably lead to Sherlock having to forgo washing his hair in favour of...other things that needed to be taken care of. Sadly, before he can come to a conclusion, Crispian comes out in a sweater, jeans and boots with a knitted hat covering his curls.
“John Watson, you cannot ask an old lady for help with sweets to woo your love and not expect to have to report on it later!” she scoffs.
John mutters about the bad things he would like to do to Sherlock's stupid bloody sock index, pushes open the posh twat's door and stamps inside.
In the end it is the insistent and uncomfortable pulse of his dick that makes up his mind. He pushes his pyjamas off his hips, down to his knees and shuffles forward, forcing them further down his shins where he can reach back and pull them off altogether.
He takes a resigned breath before slicing into the tape and uncovering her latest scheme. He reaches in and retrieves books, but it’s not psychological claptrap this time - these are gardening books aimed at beginners and those interested in self-sufficiency. Beneath that are many packets of seeds, a trowel, a fork and some tools he doesn’t even know the name of let alone the reason for. There are tags, string, seed trays and plastic cloches, a journal to record his planting and some wicked looking secateurs.
John can see that his boyfriend should be with someone as graceful and smart and refined as he is, but Sherlock has never once given any indication that he sees that. He’s never before made John feel inadequate or less, but in all the years they have been together, Sherlock has kept family and John separate. John, being an idiot, thought that was down to Sherlock being averse to family reunions, but now he’s not so sure.
He reaches up while Sherlock frowns at him and pulls him down into a bristly kiss that quickly deepens into soft, slow, lingering kisses that seem to soothe some of his impatience.
"If you had a flatmate who regularly went through your stuff, you wouldn't leave anything so incriminating as lube around either."
"Well, you may have noticed that the house isn't decorated for Christmas yet. It's a bit of a tradition in the family to save it for Christmas Eve and after Sigger's birthday,” Mummy explains to John whose eyes, miraculously, do not glaze over.  “Could you take the wheelbarrow down to the woods and find us some evergreen? There are several holly trees down there and the ivy is positively rampant. If you could cut a barrowful then we can spruce this place up a bit for Christmas," Mummy tells them.
“Of course not,” Sherlock agrees just to see John’s pleased little nod, knowing that the likelihood of him still being on this time thread by the time dinner is ready is minimal.
John listens as Sherlock thumps his pillows into place and lays down. The little noises of his body settling into the mattress, the scritch as he tackles an itch on his jaw, the sweep of the material of his pyjamas against the sheets are a comfort and torment. Despite the cold air coming in through the cracked open window, familiar scents come to John's attention; shampoo, toothpaste and something that stokes that warmth in his belly into a brighter, hotter flame, something that is unmistakably Sherlock. It seems to be hard wired into John's subconscious - it used to mean
And then John's hand is on his jaw, gently tipping his head, so he can get a different angle. It's even better. John is brilliant. Insightful. Smiling? He can feel John's lips stretch into a grin against his mouth (the sensation is delicious), but then he cups Sherlock's cheek and disengages, dabbing one, two, three smaller kisses as he steps back.
"About seven - nothing flashy." John even manages a cheeky grin when his mouth's as dry as Sherlock’s humour.
He is clearly a genius as the next few minutes are spent very contentedly rolling against each other with a slow, easy swell - enough to feel good but not enough to bring either of them beyond a certain point of arousal. Sherlock's cheeks are pinkened and his hair is insane when he lifts his head and smiles into John's equally goofy grin. Naturally, within seconds, Sherlock's grin has become sly and challenging, and John grunts when he feels long fingers slide between their bodies and work to lower his zip.
John thought about this for a moment. It was a nice day, the sun was shining, London was doing its thing outside the window of 221B Baker Street and currently had no need of the world’s only consulting detective and his sidekick – he had time to consider his response.
Singing under her breath as she checks her Oyster card and snaps her purse shut, Martha closes her front door behind her. She has shopping to do.
Sherlock doesn’t react to that, only asks his next question in the same, level tone, establishing facts and testing theories.
“Forgive you?” John reads. “Sherlock, there’s nothing to forgive. That’s what I’m saying. You’re not thinking straight right now, so I have to be the one to keep a level head. I wouldn’t want you to do something you’ll regret when you’re completely recovered. Your friendship means too much to me to…”
Sherlock is holding back and John, who couldn’t look away if he tried,  knows it. He can see the tell tale tightness around his eyes and the clench of his jaw. His hand is lighter on his cock now, teasing himself, making it last. The ache in John's groin throbs in time with Sherlock's flexing arm. If the wind blew across the bed just right, John thinks he would come all over himself.
"Sorry. I didn't mean to... I just wanted you to understand that my problems with who I am didn't start with you. But you've had the brunt of my... issues... because you're the first one that... that has mattered."
The guests break up into smaller groups as more drinks are served, and Sherlock would be lying if he said he hadn't noticed John, accepting a glass from Crispian and moving to the side of the room to talk.
Sherlock reaches up a hand and lays his palm to John's cheek. He leans up and kisses him with a sweetly swollen pinkened mouth, soft and fleeting, then nudges John off his chest and rolls off the bed. He turns back to John , sprawled across the messed up sheets. His face is clear and certain, and he holds a hand out to John in invitation. The honey light of the afternoon creeps through the messy curls, lighting them up like a halo of gold. John has never seen anything more spell-binding, soul-binding and if he could say, "I do," right now, he would. No-one has ever seen this Sherlock, no-one even suspects that he exists. He is John's, completely and utterly, free to be himself, as difficult and demanding as he can be, and as gentle and adoring as John knows him to be. He doesn't fear rejection, he never needs to pretend - he knows that John loves him. God knows he's told him often enough but once more cannot hurt.
Sherlock. Suddenly it’s John who believes Christmas must have come in the night – he has that same feeling of warmth and peace and safety along with a happy champagne bubble thrill in his chest. He has no idea what is going to happen – maybe nothing, maybe something wonderful – but at this split second he is happy, perfectly happy in a way he knows he will remember long after the outcome has unfolded.
He’s lost count of the number of ‘pleases’ he has asked Sherlock for over the years, some out loud and some only in his mind, but John wants to put his lips to Sherlock’s skin and speak every one of them into his flesh – layer them, overlap them until they cover him completely like bandages.
Now their relationship (if that’s what this is, John cautions himself) has moved on somewhat, John thinks that they won’t be able to postpone some serious conversation for very long. Clearly they both come with some serious baggage and it wouldn't be fair for either of them to pretend otherwise.
The speech is warm and well received and then, at Mycroft's prompting, everybody toasts the birthday boy and they all retire to a room at the opposite end of the house that John has not seen so far. It's a large sitting room, going by the sofas and side tables, but there is a baby grand piano in pride of place. A roaring fire at one end of the room is lit, giving the place a cosy warmth and a homely scent. John takes a seat on one of the sofas and Sherlock perches himself on the arm beside him leaving Crispian to sit on his other side once more.
His mind was whirring through a meters long to-do list. The next show was beginning, and the indefinite future was filled with composing, auditions, choreography, and rehearsal after rehearsal. It was the best and worst time of year – too busy to think, and too busy to think. He watched the sunlight reflecting off the wet rock, tiny starbursts against the earth tones, and witnessed a red leaf drift down until it met the water. The river was kind – it would carry it gently it for a while before submerging it into absolute chaos.
“The bullet they just dug out of the wall is from a handgun. A kill shot over that distance, from that kind of a weapon, that's a crack shot you're looking for but not just a marksman, a fighter. His hands couldn't have shaken at all so clearly he's acclimatized to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger though so strong moral principle. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service and...” Sherlock saw John, standing stoic and blank outside the tape, as if he had been there waiting all along. Realization crept in. “Nerves of steel— Actually, do you know what, ignore me.”
to be expected. The guy was an absolute creep and Sherlock was having none of it. Jim’s voicemail was just a number and series of pips. Sherlock had left a message on the machine, thanking him for his time, but
Molly watched as Sherlock struggled through his seventh Battement en Rond. They had scheduled rehearsal together, but now she felt tempted to walk out of the theater and let him have the stage.
John stirred, rolling over onto his back. He wiped the sleep from his eyes with the heels of his hands and searched.
John slipped his practice bag over his shoulder and arranged the strap across his chest. He made for the door, grabbing his helmet and keys on the way out. It was still the color of midnight on the steps of his apartment, the lampposts casting eerie shadows along the sidewalk. He mounted his Triumph, giving a strong kick to the start and buckled his helmet at the chin strap. The bike idled with a low growl before she roared to life as John gripped the accelerator. His chest dipped to meet the handle bars as he veered out into the street.
“Sherlock.” Her voice mocked his in its depth and firmness. He felt the corner of his mouth pull up in a small smile.
He slowly rose to his feet, black dots prickling softly at the edges of his vision. As John made his way into the kitchen to top off his glass, he heard movement from the bedroom. He hoped Sherlock was still here, still in this godforsaken, lonely as fuck flat. All John wanted was to see his face, to apologize for being such an insecure imbecile,
John considered as he peeled off his socks. He licked his lips as he reached for a new towel. “Alright. Yeah.” Callum pumped a fist into the air, and as John headed towards the showers in nothing but his pants, Everett popped a sweat drenched towel across John’s left ass cheek. With a hiss and a middle finger, John turned the corner. “You ungrateful prick!”
Molly nodded, stepped to the curb, and with a sassy wink, shrugged her bare shoulder out of her silk shawl. A cabbie screamed to a halt and Callum rolled his eyes.
The boys pushed their way close to the edge of the quickly expanding ring. Someone was in now, moving quickly to the pulsing bass lines and techno lined choruses. Sherlock wrapped his arm loosely about John’s waist, and turned his attention to the people taking turns. He observed the choreography, collecting data on what was trending, what looked best when properly executed, and how often people actually kept time with their music. Not many, he found.
John originally believed him to be. To sit and watch him dance for hours on end would be a most excellent way to spend his free evening, especially compared to rotting in front of the telly or purchasing another book on his kindle, only to crash ten minutes into it.
Sherlock stewed over John’s reaction. Normally when he went prima donna, the victims fell silent, or apologized, or retracted their previous statements. John Watson had stared him in the face and had not only been totally and completely unnerved, but also spat his words back in a most clever and concise manner. And the composed bastard had a point, damnit. How rotten he had seemed, whining about self-inflicted injuries when several of these men have been wounded during battle, risk being killed every day, or save the lives of others and have seen wounds far worse than those of a bored, high-functioning sociopath. The captain had not even flinched. And that infuriated Sherlock all the more.
“May I go ahead and stuff the chicken?” Sherlock called from the kitchen. He hated having to yell over the obnoxious whirring of the vacuum. John shut the power off.
Sherlock cautiously approached the hospital bed. He was horribly thin, his eyes dark and so tired. He folded into himself, even whilst standing. The same fingers that addressed his stubborn, interfering hair now reached out, slowly, to touch John’s. They were cold, as always. John knew, even if he pulled from his best memories, he could not recreate that feeling in his head.
“I’m off today. I apologize, Molly. I did not intend to waste your time.” Molly pushed the damp hair from his forehead and gave him a small smile.
John gave Sherlock a watery smile, and closed his eyes, leaning into Sherlock’s touch as he gently swiped away John’s tears.
Here is the fourth chapter! A Sherlocked Girl has requested I post correlating songs to each chapter, so visit Chapter 1 to find my Playlist link. Here are the declared jams for chapter four:
Sherlock saw him walk through the door, cheeks flushed red, at the cold or too much alcohol consumption, he could not be sure. Sherlock watched him peel out of his jacket in an oddly attractive way, tugging logically at each sleeve first, then pulling his left arm out of the sleeve as his right hand held it steady behind his back. The result was a broadening of John’s shoulders and the slow reveal of two beautifully tattooed arms, full sleeve complete on the right and an in progress on the left. Sherlock looked down and took a quiet sip of his hot toddy, headphones still laced in his ears as his compositions played. He had come here in hopes of being able to plot out the next bit of choreography, but he knew now he would be fatally distracted. John draped his coat over a rack and pulled his cuffed sleeves back down over his elbow, covering the majority of a beautifully rendered lion and Union Jack flag that had spanned most of his elbow and forearm. Sherlock watched him dutifully as the rugby player approached the bar, seeming a bit more steady now. He plucked the headphone closest to John out of his ear in order to listen; invasive, he knew, but his curiosity had gotten the best of him. What did he sound like?
John shrugged and gave a quiet chuckle. “Of course. He may be my best mate, but we are competitive as hell. We both have to be just as good as the other at anything and everything.”
“Just here, on the left!” Sherlock yelled through the whistling air and the plastic of their helmets. John signaled and parked, swinging out the kickstand and shutting the bike off. He turned to face Sherlock as he unfastened his helmet, and felt his stomach dip at the sight of Sherlock grinning obscenely, ruffling his hair in an attempt to reshape it.
Sherlock stood and walked around, picking John’s plate up from the table. He walked to the sink without a word. John felt his stomach nose dive, likely straight out of his arse. He followed Sherlock into the kitchen.
John scoffed, wiping his nose stubbornly with a crumpled napkin. He then placed his hands palm up and shrugged his shoulders:
“Quite nice is nothing. I know that much.” John took the first crunch of his sandwich. An oregano covered cucumber slipped from between the bread and plopped onto the wax paper. He raised his eyebrows at Jane expectantly.
. John found that every time Sherlock’s body touched his, a tiny flame lit there, burning out until his flesh was nothing but smoldering embers. Sherlock’s hand laced around John’s neck, fingers carding through the silvery blonde at the base of his neck; they swayed side to side, rocking on their feet. John stepped to the side and laughed aloud, in pure awe of Sherlock’s ability to predict his every movement. They faced opposite walls, and for every swing of a leg or folding of an arm, the other had a counter gesture that balanced it perfectly. John felt something break free in his chest; a bubble of elation, at the discovery of this man, the pulse of this fantastic song, knowing they had onlookers, being associated with him: Sherlock and Shezza alike, the look on Sherlock’s face in response to John feigning ignorance in the center of the dance circle, at his ability to let the fuck go and just
The next letter was different. Sherlock’s handwriting wasn’t as easy to read, though it never really was, and he had given no regard to the lines on the page. He also signed his name…
“There’s something you all don’t know about Callum. Before Molly, there was someone else. A first wife, if you will.” The room was flooded with whispers and raised eyebrows, and Jane swatted him hard on the leg. Callum was covering his mouth, in a horrible attempt to stifle laughter and Molly looked appalled. “Don’t fret, really, the first wife was hardly worth mentioning; he reminds me of it all the time. Turns out the first wife just didn’t cut it: Something about being too childish, never being able to clean up their own messes, and never remembering to switch the towels over. Nothing worse than soured towels. Am I right?” Everyone stared wide-eyed and John chuckled to himself. “Before Molly came along, Callum was stuck with me, the first wife.” Fits of laughter erupted throughout the room, Jane’s eyes were wet with mirth, Molly’s father finally relaxed and Sherlock’s mouth was twisted into a quirk of a smile. “Apparently I make a shoddy companion; ladies, you have been warned. Callum Everett…” John plucked up the courage to look to his best mate, sitting at his left. Callum was beaming up at him, clearly already pleased. “You have saved my life, figuratively and literally, nearly a hundred times over.” He paused to still his raging heartbeat. “We have known each other our entire lives. We have overcome the most ridiculous of scrums, on the pitch and off, we have dated some truly atrocious women, we have developed bad habits and broken bad habits. We have cultivated an amazing team of men, we have pushed our way to victory at an International Cup, we have danced and drank far too much and we can barely remember the time when we were able to share our wardrobes. We have laughed, we have cried, we have fought, and we have endured a hell other people can only imagine in their dreams.” The room was silent now, and John was speaking directly to Callum. “I don’t deserve a best mate like you. In fact, I deserve little in comparison to the spectacular character you possess. You and I both know I would not be standing next to you, witnessing this incredible union, rambling like an idiot if it were not for your kindness, understanding, and unwavering loyalty.” John swallowed the lump of emotion lodged in his throat.
A soft whimper left the back of John’s throat. Sherlock hummed in response, earning him the gorgeous sight of John opening his heavy eyes to look at him. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s drying hair, and Sherlock felt emotion, heavy and thick, fall like a blanket around them both. John blinked, appreciation and surprise swimming in his eyes.
After a shower and meager dinner in mess hall, the doctor pulled out paper and a pen. He had developed a bi-weekly ritual. The letter would arrive. He would read it first thing in the morning, mull it over and concoct a response whilst at his post, and then wrote said response in the evening. He had also grown fond of writing his letters with Collective Soul as company. He set the pad of paper and a pen on the bed between his knees, hunching over in a near fetal position as he wrote.
“Fuck you, John. You’re such a prick.” She grabbed her heels from the foyer, and John gave her a two-fingered salute, though she only deserved one, certainly, as she slammed the door behind her.
“Yes, that’s where your room is located.” John’s heart skipped. His room. He opened the door, feeling Sherlock close behind him. The walls were a mossy green. The bed had been made; a gray duvet with green, flannel sheets. There wasn’t much in the way of furniture: a dresser, a side table. But it was perfect. Sherlock stepped in next to him and set his duffel on the bed.
“You will be the death of me, Sherlock. I swear to god. You can’t waltz around pretending you can escape everything!”
John sat on the edge of the stage, legs dangling and twitching with nerves. His hands clutched his knees and he was counting to ten. He had not yet successfully made it past six before having to start again.
“Exhilarating. You’re a decent driver.” Something in Sherlock’s expression changed, and John raised his eyebrows in curiosity.
“John Watson. Keep that mouth clean in my sanctuary. And yes, it’s an immense amount of work. Now shush, the curtain’s going up soon.”
“I’m Tito,” the olive-skinned man offered, grinning, short dreads pulled up into a knot on the top of his head, the sides undercut like Kirsten’s back at the high school, punked out and precious with her glimmering tongue ring, “and this is Izzi.” Izzi was of Asian descent, dark haired and warm skinned. He was tall and thin, and wore black, thick-framed glasses.
He heard a soft, throaty chuckle come from the bed. Sherlock froze, though he wasn’t sure why. It wasn’t as if his mental pacing had been the thing to wake John. He heard the covers rustling, and saw the outline of John walking toward him. Clothes were being taken from his hands and dropped to the floor. A warm mouth found his and gave him a slow, sated kiss. “Stay,” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips. His voice was like a storm; low, strong, and unfazed. It crashed over Sherlock and wrapped him up tight. Sherlock walked back into the hall and returned, moments later. He found John in the dark and pushed him onto the edge of the bed. He took a warm, damp flannel to John’s skin, and tossed it to the floor as John pulled the covers back. John slipped in, moving over to make room for Sherlock. As soon as Sherlock was horizontal, John leaned up on an elbow and hovered over him, fingers trailing along his arm. Sherlock tilted his chin up, in search of John’s mouth, and he eventually found it.
Her blue eyes went wide. They shifted back and forth between his own, revealing confusion, frustration, and fear. Slowly, though, the hard edges faded as she dropped her gaze to his chest. Jane placed her hand across the warm fleece of his pullover and found the steady heartbeat. She closed her eyes; her lips pursed together and then, moments later, quirked into a small smile. “I want this,” she whispered, eyes still closed, hand still splayed across his chest, “I want you.” Jane chuckled softly, pressing her palm against B’s ribcage. She opened her eyes and found his. “Your heart is beating faster.”
“Hmm?” John didn’t know if he meant the movie or the living space. He was beginning to acknowledge that somehow, Sherlock had the ability to read minds.
“Those words, identical phrasing, crossed my mind the night you found me at the pub.” He said it so nonchalantly, plucking a disc from the selection. John stared, mouth agape.
Sherlock was torn between chuckling and bristling. It was a loaded statement, and he knew what Watson meant: you’re too good for this life, aren’t you, Mr. Holmes? You aren’t a fighter for others, are you, Mr. Holmes? You couldn’t live this way for years at a time, could you, Mr. Holmes? You’re a selfish, spoiled bastard, aren’t you, Mr. Holmes? Sherlock felt a heat find his cheeks. Well. That was completely unfamiliar. He was embarrassed. God only knows what of.
“Right.” Mycroft replied, “So at what point did you decide to pretend the skeleton was Victor’s body? Why didn’t you just tell Mummy or Daddy and forget about it?”
John appeared by his side with Rosie propped against his hip. “Here, I’ll do it, don’t worry.” He said, pressing against his side and touching his hands as he reached for the bottle. Sherlock momentarily froze, before handing the warm bottle over to John so he could feed Rosie.
Sherlock rose from the bed and padded out of his room as swiftly and silently as possible, closing the door behind him. Gone were the days where he worked until he collapsed, then slept for three days straight – he had responsibilities now. He had Rosie now.
“Da-da-da-da!” Rosie garbled delightedly, causing Sherlock to whip round to see John stumbling through the kitchen doorway, rubbing his eyes.
“Before puberty it’s very difficult to distinguish a male from a female skeleton, but the shoulders are slightly broader than would be expected for a girl… The jaw bone is quite defined. Um… Maybe Molly could help?”
Sherlock shifted underneath the covers, turning to face John sleepily. He breathed in deeply, relishing the smell of John’s warm, tea-stained scent. He sighed contentedly.
When Sherlock felt tears sting his eyes, he grunted in distaste. What had he become, crying and kissing and just generally being a slave to his emotions? Mycroft would be disgusted. Sherlock was, in a small, quiet part of his consciousness, disgusted with himself, too. Sentiment is a defect found on the losing side.
The motion caused his old army t shirt to lift above his waistband, and Sherlock distractedly tore his eyes away from the tanned skin beneath.
“Mycroft, Lestrade has just arrived with some puzzling news.” Sherlock began as soon as he answered.
Sherlock hummed in agreement, shifting Rosie so she leaned against the pillow so he could get up, too. John had already started padding down the stairs to get the door.
Sherlock smiled, and sat down beside John. The air was charged with words unspoken, but when John gently took his hand, and wordlessly put the One o Clock News on, the restlessness in Sherlock’s head ceased, and he relaxed against John’s side. Maybe Mary was right. They could get through this. *
She dragged herself closer to Sherlock so she could nestle against his chest. Sherlock automatically wrapped his arms around her small, warm body.
“Oh it’s all coming together now! You see? I never confirmed nor denied your conclusion that I killed your friend. So what does that mean…?” Euros trailed off meaningfully, touching her lower lip with her finger in a traditional ‘thinking’ pose.
John sat on the sofa and leaned forward with Rosie on his lap, his open-book face displaying the whirring mind within as he searched for an explanation.
“She’s my daughter, Sherlock. It’s fine,” John replied, “Hello darlin’!” He cooed to Rosie as she stuck her arms in the air, wanting to be picked up. “Is Uncle Sherlock making you some milk, then?” He jokingly asked her, as though she would answer. He took her gurgle as confirmation. “Ah, I see.” He chuckled.
“Lestrade, you head back to the yard, try and speak to the archaeologist and find anything you can about who the skeleton may belong to, why he died, why he was never found. Is the skeleton at Bart’s?”
“I can’t hold you and make milk at the same time, Rosie!” Sherlock explained. Not that Rosie could understand him. God, what had he become. He rolled his eyes at himself. Looking round in desperation, he spotted her teddy giraffe, and sighed in relief.
John nodded slowly, seriously. “That’s okay, Sherlock.” He said quietly, looking into Sherlock’s multi-coloured eyes.
“What’s woken you up then, sweetheart?” Sherlock cooed. He patted her nappy inquisitively, and breathed a sigh of relief, “Don’t need changing then.”
He stared at John, unable to communicate his feelings. John smiled knowingly back at him, and smoothed his small, rough hand against Sherlock’s bicep which peeked above the covers.
John scrubbed his hands over his face. Sherlock was already more irritable than he had been even since Rosie was born. He seemed to have endless patience for her, no matter how loud she cried or for how long. But this case, this is what was crumbling that hard-earned self-control.
“I am lost. Help me, brother. Save my life before my doom. I am lost without your love. Save my soul. Seek my room.”
He had spent many hours researching how to comfort babies in preparation, and with the added experience from the past two weeks of living with a toddler, Sherlock had perfected the art of soothing her. He placed one hand on her bottom (babies found that comforting... for some reason), and one between her shoulder blades, and rocked back and forth slowly. Rosie saw his thick black curls, and smelled his clean, familiar scent, and immediately quieted down.
“Hiya, baby girl. It’s me.” Sherlock whispered to the struggling Rosie, pressing her soft, warm head beneath his chin.
“Seems that way, however improbable. But that means Victor’s body must still be somewhere. And that she knew we would discover that the skeleton in that well is not Victor’s.”
John leaned forward, fidgeting with his face mask to make sure it was fully over his face, and trying to separate himself from the situation as the individual bones of an 8 year old boy, or girl, really, lay slotted next to eachother like a jigsaw puzzle.
“Right. Okay. So we’ll create Missing Persons posters for a 42 year old male, blonde hair, English-speaking, no known history before the age of 8,” Lestrade sighed, “We’re not gonna get very far with that. He could be anywhere.”
He blushed furiously, angry at himself for reacting in this way. It was John, who he’d known for years. They hadn’t yet discussed what was happening between them, but they were definitely developing.
Taking the stairs two at a time, Sherlock swept into the slowly-awakening toddler’s room and reached straight into the wooden cot.
Molly believes the skeleton (believed to be male) has been in the well since the child died, as there are signs of slow decay of the flesh, and the colouring also suggests it has been kept in a non-fresh water source for some time.\\
She turned her head so that her lips pressed against his neck, breathing heavily. Her little hand fisted in the soft collar of his pyjama top, and the other lay against his bare bicep, contracting occasionally. Sherlock had of course researched these basic reflexes, and he smiled down at her. So vulnerable still. As he looked down at her, her brow dented and her eyes screwed up.
The snuffling noise emerging from the baby monitor woke Sherlock instantly. He lifted his head and listened carefully for any further noises; sure enough, the sound of wet sniffling and increasingly heavy breathing permeated the dark, thick atmosphere of Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock looked over his shoulder, and saw John breathing slowly and calmly beside him. Best to get to Rosie before she started crying and woke John.
He lifted his hand to touch him, but pulled away. What happens when he does? John imagined breaking a spell: Aurora waking up, confused and uncertain. Why was he in his bed? Oh, but John liked him here… Loved those long legs hanging over the foot board, one arm folded up under the pillow, serene face directed at the window. The moon kissed Sherlock in all the best places. His cheeks, his full, pouty bottom lip, his shirtless shoulder and muscle of his oblique, and two, sweet dimples dead center in his lower back, right above the elastic band of his cotton pyjamas. Watson loved the way he fit next to him in the bed. He had kicked the covers down to the foot board. John silently watched his back move with his breathing. He was the most beautiful thing John had ever seen.
The cab ride was silent. John was overwhelmed; he had been practically dead three weeks ago, his father died only days before, and now he was sitting next to the only man that gave two fucks about him, heading to a flat he’d never visited in a city that felt foreign. How could home feel foreign? Had it already been an entire year? Kind faces passed through the windows, young children in scarves and silly hats, clouds of smoke rising from chimneys.
John was beaming up at him, thrilled at the excitement plastered on Sherlock’s face. Had he never ridden a motorbike before?
Wind surrounded him on all sides, pulling him in all directions. His body was warm and wet, his mouth cracked and dry. Darkness was better. He looked for it, and eagerly rejoined his familiar friend.
“Start what? I’m not starting anythiiiing.” Jane knew the second the sing-song voice came out, she was absolutely plotting.
Molly dropped to her knees at the edge of the stage, wrapping her arms around Callum’s neck. “Depends. Don’t you think I need more practice?” He leaned forward and kissed where her right hip bone protruded through her clothes. Callum wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off the stage.
Sherlock hummed, pretending to be interested. John squelched the chuckle rising from his chest. He watched the man intently, roving over the features exposed to him. His dark hair was pushed back and away from his face, his black suit making it appear even darker than it did on the stage at Marylebone. He held his drink steadily in his hand. He was not an easily shaken man, nor a man with many fidgets. John looked down to see a slight bounce of his knee and smiled to himself. Not many. Sherlock’s eyes were bluer in the lighting, sharp and analytical. He was frightfully intelligent. John felt his lungs constricting as he glanced at the pale expanse of his neck, focus falling on the beautiful pulse point below his ear. His skin looked cooler there, the veins and arteries melding together underneath his flesh. John was so tempted to take a gentle and tentative step forward and caress the soft skin behind Sherlock’s ear with his thumb. Sherlock turned and his eyes bore into John’s, flicking back and forth. His dark brows were furrowed together in frustration, and John felt himself being plucked apart piece by piece, and did not know whether he loved it or hated it. Wesley had been summoned elsewhere, but John hadn’t noticed.
Doctor Watson stared back at him, eyes wide and at full alert. The blue was as far from ice as it could be while still living within the same hue. His brows were furrowed enough to show worry, but not so much to look worrisome by nature. His mouth was firm, pulled up only a minute amount at the right corner. His whole head was shifted slightly to the right, cocked as though he had heard something off, something odd. He looked expectant. Watson’s shoulders were squared, braced for impact. Sherlock exhaled. That. That tiny deduction, just there. Watson knew. He had read. Sherlock puzzled, brows furrowing and eyes burying themselves deeper into Watson’s. The doctor showed no sign of fear or recoil. He maintained the contact. Behind the kindness and the worry was acknowledgement, and a tinge, just a little bit, of acceptance. Familiarity. Interesting.
Sherlock stared at the page. Several minutes passed. He ran his hands across the water stained pages,
“I do, in fact. It was a big step, you know, being twenty-eight and all, but I have a nightlight, so it’s been okay.”
“Tito, will you take a photo for me?” Sherlock turned to look at him, eyes curious and brow furrowed.
“Hey,” he murmured, “just talk to me. I just want to talk. I don’t know where you stand or how you’re feeling, and I know the idea of being with someone so soon after everything else that has happened overwhelms you a bit. Nothing to be afraid of.”
John’s mouth fell into a small oh. His eyes were blinking at an alarming rate and Sherlock raised his eyebrow. “John? Is that such a surprise?” The detective looked mildly offended.
He felt a new pain bloom in his chest, sharp and rigid against his sternum.In an attempt to see if anything had been written recently, he turned the page. The date was only a week prior. It was the first thing John had written in nearly two years.
Jane chuckled as she opened the fridge, plucked another Oktoberfest from the six pack, and twisted off the lid with her flannel. “Here ya go, sunshine. Let’s get down to business.”
Irene gently shook her head back and forth, befuddlement still written across her eyes and furrowed brow. “No. That isn’t it. I just… how can I help? What can I do?”
“Alright. I was only asking.” He closed his book and set it on the small table next to him. “I guess I’m going to turn in. A good night of sleep should clear my grumpy head.” He stood and headed for the stairs. He paused in the doorway. Sherlock was covered in the gold light of a tungsten bulb, his hair reading almost burgundy in some places. John could count the vertebrae through the back of Sherlock’s white shirt and watched his fingers run madly across the keyboard. Smiling to himself, he headed upstairs.
Sherlock chewed the words. John Watson knew nothing of his life, past his medical records and obviously self-destructive tendencies, and yet…
“Yes.” John whispered. Sherlock felt the follicles on the back of neck prickle; not in dread, but in desire. John’s voice was so tender. Sherlock turned, before giving himself time to process, to face him.
Sherlock walked through the door, sliding a wet hand through his frizzed, curly hair. He headed toward the closet, unbuttoning his cuff sleeves when his eyes found John. His left eyebrow inched upwards, and a smirk spread across his clever, pouty mouth. John squared his shoulders from his sitting position on the bed and raised his chin a bit, and after blowing Sherlock a flirtatious and over-exaggerated kiss, moved his hands to rest behind his head. John watched as Sherlock’s eyes scanned his body until they came to rest between his legs. They were no strangers to admiring each other, from a distance or up close, and they had become fantastic at stripping one another down to the skin with their eyes alone. Sherlock continued to unbutton his sleeves, eyes unmoving from John’s, and once those were free, he’d turned his attention to the line of them running down his front. John gave a cheeky smile as Sherlock paused at the third button to come undone, fingers moving agonizingly slow. He instead turned his attention to the black leather belt laced through the loops of his trousers, unbuckling it slowly and smoothly. John caught on and sat up straighter against the pillows, his right hand now cupping the erection pressing against his green cotton pants. “Ah. Going to put on a performance for me, then?” he asked, his voice quiet and murky in the silence of the bedroom. The only other sound was Sherlock’s belt sliding out from under the restraint of each loop.
