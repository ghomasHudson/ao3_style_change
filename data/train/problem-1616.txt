Sherlock glared.
After a moment of panic, he felt John’s focus on him and he slowly turned his head to meet his soft grey eyes. Sherlock noted an undercurrent of solemnity in John’s expression despite the smile on his lips and crinkles at the corners of his eyes. With just a look, it felt like John was trying to bolster him, metaphorical hands reaching across the space between their bodies to prop him up as he wobbled. It was as though John could sense, and somehow understood, this torrent of emotion that was tumbling through Sherlock’s mind and John, strong, determined, unassuming John, was undaunted in the face of it. Reacting calmly when presented with crises was only natural for an accomplished Army medic, Sherlock reminded himself, but he was surprised at how grateful he was to find such a skill employed on him. Normally, he would scornfully brush off anyone’s concern for his well-being.
“Right, well, this week has been total shit at work.  There’s an impossible case that we just can’t seem to crack and the Chief Constable is breathing down our necks about it, especially mine after I fucked up an interview, so now I’m worried about getting a demerit.  Plus, I was a total arse to my best friend earlier tonight and I still feel like awful about that.  Sorry again, Johnny,” he says, tipping his glass in my direction.  I wave him off.
“Lead the way, handsome.”
He did appear exhausted, dark circles under his eyes and a slow gait; he would, most likely, prefer to be anywhere else than partaking in breakfast at the palace, but Sherlock thought that his continued presence may make John feel more comfortable at the royal breakfast table so he was grateful that the Major was joining them.
“Congratulations on making your first cup of tea, Your Highness.”
One second the paper cup is in my grasp and the next it’s been knocked out of my hand and there is coffee everywhere.  Including on the person I’ve just run into.
He turned right, anticipating that his pursuers – surely his absence had been noted by now – would guess he had made a break for the shortest path to freedom, and Sherlock thought it best to avoid the front of the hotel where he might risk being seen by someone who knew him.  The lane was dark and damp, old crates and bits of rubbish lined the walls.  There were two other exits from the hotel leading out onto it, but they looked rarely used.  Sherlock hurried to the end of the lane and turned left at the junction, leading him away from the Ritz.
My heart thuds in my chest at those words -- I’m certain Sherlock can hear it where his ear presses against me -- and just like that my happy little bubble pops.  He obviously didn’t heed my warning not to snoop.  Irritation ripples through me as I imagine him poking around through every drawer and cupboard in the flat, pulling out the pieces of my life and inspecting them at all angles, judging.
“You have been successful thus far.”
Eventually, they found a clear table and Sherlock quickly claimed one of the chairs before it was taken. John settled next to him, close enough that their elbows bumped together. Sherlock pressed his arm into John’s and John pressed back in response, and Sherlock had to smother a grin at the touch. It was innocent enough, easily passed off as a result of crowded space, but after their kiss, it felt downright illicit. However, he knew no one would notice, even if they had not been so wrapped up in their own revelry to pay attention to them.
John paid very little attention to what Private Meeks was actually saying, focusing instead on continuing his secondary assessment in case there were other injuries of note. As it turned out, there were none, and Meeks’ story was much as Sherlock had predicted. The injured man, Private Sampson, was prone to becoming excitable when drunk, and in the midst of telling some tale or another, lost his balance and tumbled arse over teakettle over the railing. Sherlock seemed almost disappointed by the fact that it had happened much as he'd said, but it helped clarify John’s picture of the man’s fall and resulting injury.
“Okay.  Anything else you need?”  I’m just fussing now -- I’m loath to leave him on his own.
“You’re hearing things.”
Turning back to where he had last seen his friend, Sherlock was dismayed to discover that John and Molly had been swept farther away, into a more direct path of the Colonel. Sherlock scrambled towards him, knocking into dancers on both sides and stumbling over an outstretched leg.
“How did he seem?  Is he holding up okay?” Mike asks.
There’s a war going on inside me - the rational versus the emotional, head versus heart.  What I want to do is crawl across the sofa and be wrapped up in his arms.  But I know I can’t do that, mainly because I need to go shower and get ready for work, but also because it’s too damn soon to be seriously contemplating starting up whatever this is again.  And with all the gossip in the papers, it can’t be good timing for Sherlock -- his priority certainly should be his career.
“Okay, let’s finish getting you ready.  Should I call Armon back in?”
“It’s the polite thing to do, no, when someone lends you one of their belongings.”
“Nothing!  Just that I think this needs to be your decision.”
Following the carriage bearing the body of the King, came two riders, sitting tall and stoic in their saddles, and John’s breath caught as he recognised the Princes Henry and William.
“Major Lestrade, thank you for joining us.  You were recommended most highly by General Erskine and I appreciate you putting aside your own celebrations to accompany the Princes Henry and William tonight.” His father’s slow speech still managed to command the room and Sherlock’s brain stuttered to a halt.  Accompany them?
“Ah, yes.  Well, this is what he does, no?  He makes sure people are okay.  Did you know he got me my big break?”
After pushing into my flat, I shuck my jacket and hang it up on its peg next to Sherlock's long coat.  I follow my nose into the sitting room, where I find Sherlock lounging on the sofa in studied nonchalance.  He’s wearing jeans and a dark green cashmere jumper.  “New clothes?” I ask, taking in his outfit.
“Good,” Sherlock says roughly, clearing his throat.  “That’s. . . good.”
“Fine, draft something, Sally,” Sherlock waves a hand at her and then sits up straighter on the sofa, “but let me see it before it’s released.”
Note: If this story was a film, I think
John stared at him, open-mouthed. He’d always thought that he had game, after all he’d pulled any number of women on nights out at the pub, but John was pretty sure he was being swept off his feet by Sherlock. It was totally unexpected, really. He assumed Sherlock was too uninterested or inexperienced to put in the effort with anyone, but here he was being all openly sexy and romantic, like it came as easily to him as deducing.
Together, they turned south and headed for Sloane Street, which would take them to the heart of Chelsea. It appeared that John was familiar with Chelsea Barracks, so Sherlock trusted that he would lead them there without issue.
As they neared the mouth of the alley, Sherlock exclaimed, “John!” His voice was tinged with excitement, and an odd undertone of panic.
“How could you possibly know that?”
He tried again.  “Germany has surrendered.  Papa is busy preparing his address to the nation, Churchill is currently...” Sherlock gestured vaguely, “negotiating a treaty, and the people have taken to the streets of London.  The world is experiencing a profound sense of happiness following years of horror, chaos and death, and I want to be a part of it.”
The thought caught John by surprise, and he remembered he hadn’t needed his cane for any of tonight’s hijinks. It was odd to feel sure of foot. This confidence in his body and himself was unfamiliar as of late but a relief.  With his next few steps, John almost felt like he was dancing.
I take my sandwich and coffee from him.  “Thanks, Anderson.  Can you watch the till for a minute?  I need to make a call.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The request comes out of nowhere.  Does he not carry a mobile?  Is he texting for a lift?  Dumbly, I fumble in my pocket and pull out my mobile, handing it over to him as my brain tries to make sense of what’s happened.  I fail -- I’m properly confused about what’s going on just now.
With a nod, I bustle into the kitchen to prepare two cups of tea.  As they steep, I pick up the envelope Harry passed over to me yesterday and pull out the pages.  In my excitement (and dread) to get back to the flat, I hadn’t even opened it to look at her most recent work.  I pull out the drawings now and read them through quickly.  We’re nearing the end of the volume and it’s thrilling to see it come together fully.  I tuck them back into the envelope to finish preparing the tea -- sugar in one, milk in both -- and then, tucking the envelope under my arm, I pick up the cups of tea and walk carefully back to the bedroom.
“Do you think people actually use these gardens?  Or are they just locked up as a sign to the rest of the world that we’re not good enough?” I ask Sherlock, gesturing to the fence on my left.
John watched in fascinated horror as people began to genuflect, one after another, either saluting, bowing or curtseying in Sherlock's direction. The Colonel's expression showed a combination of outrage and shock, and over his shoulder, Molly and Irene were clutching at each other’s arms, while whispering furiously. He kept waiting for someone to contradict Sherlock, to call him out for the bold-faced lie, but the longer he surveyed the silent room, the clearer it became that wasn't going to happen.
His fingers fly over the screen, tapping away at a message to some unknown person.  I feel horribly awkward standing there, watching him text someone else with my mobile.  Not sure what to do with myself, I look away and scuff the toe of my shoe on the pavement.
⟪Come onn, I want all teh details!!⟫
The door was opened by a footman, who looked enquiringly at Lieutenant Glover.
“It can be.”
And with that, Sherlock Holmes whirls out the door, out of my shop, and out of my life.
A bright smile unfurled across Sherlock’s face. “It was quite a night, wasn’t it, John?”
He stands quietly by the counter while I ready the shop to close for the evening, cashing out and putting the deposit in the safe in the office to deal with tomorrow, closing down the till, and places the bags of rubbish out on the pavement.  I can feel him watching me and it makes me hyper-aware of my movements as I go about these familiar tasks.  Finally, jacket on, I’m ready to leave and nod towards the door.
⟪I am convinced that only the most mindless people go into entertainment journalism. These interviews are torture. SH⟫
Thanks again to my lovely betas @shylockgnomes, @eternaljohnlock and @zigster-ao3 - you are all wonderful!
They were approaching the roundabout where Piccadilly spiralled off into various posh neighbourhoods in which John had never set foot.  The taxi would carry onto Grosvenor Place, then wind its way over Chelsea Bridge before depositing him amongst the identical row houses of Ingelow Road.  At this pace, however, it’d be nearly half an hour before they would arrive at his destination.  John was grateful for the travel allowance he’d been granted by the Army due to his injury.
It’s like ice running through my veins.  I don’t know how he knows who I am or about my injury, but I immediately square myself up, shoulders pulled back in a defensive posture, my fists clenched.  I grit out, “I don’t need to sit down.”
John could hear the patter of raindrops hitting the windowpane as he lay in bed, anticipating the harsh ring of his alarm. Outside, the darkness would linger for many hours yet.
I grunt and adjust him so his bony arse isn’t digging into my thigh.  “Hello,” I say, grinning up at him.  “You excited for tonight?”
“Not that they’d be interested in you, Benton, with someone like Cheekbones here about!” The tall soldier gestured to him and then grabbed the flask from Barnes, unscrewing the cap and taking a pull, before passing it to Sherlock.
“Yeah, okay, sorry!  I just don’t want you climbing the walls from boredom or anything!”
“Oh, how boorish of me, please let me introduce ourselves. I am Sherlock Holmes and this is my friend Captain John Watson.”
“Enter,” he called out.
As embarrassing as it was to admit, John found this song rather...sexy.  His hips began to sway, remembering (vaguely) those late nights in sweaty clubs back in his uni and army days, how strangers’ hands had traveled over his skin and gripped his arms, his abdomen and, daringly, his bum.  John giggled at the thought - that felt like someone else’s life.
“Oh!  Ha.  I woke up yesterday to a barrage of texts from all of them.  They were definitely curious, to say the least.  You were a big hit at Harry’s birthday, but I imagine you draw attention wherever you go.”
John had just taken a sip and startled at Sherlock’s loud and urgent question.  It was now his turn to splutter and cough. He blinked up at Sherlock.  John’s lack of response made Sherlock suddenly uncertain.  Had he been too forward?  He shifted his weight to his left foot, away from John, and cut his gaze out over the crowd before glancing back at the man on his right.
God.  He feels so fucking good, and I still can’t fully believe that I get to do this with him.  This could all end rather suddenly if I let myself get caught up in it.  I could come from the friction alone, and I absolutely refuse to let that happen.  Come on, Watson, hold it together.
“That doesn’t matter!” John erupted, voice bouncing off the stone walls surrounding them.
Sherlock shrugged.  “Do you actually believe what the King was saying in his speech tonight?  Did no part of it seem false or hypocritical to you, considering the difference between his station and that of those people in the pub?”
“It’s not much, but it’s home.”  He raises an eyebrow at me and I force my lips into a smile.  “Loo’s down there on the right.”
She looks a bit startled by my response.  “Hey, I know I can be a horrible cow most of the time, but honestly, John, you’ve been so good for him, and I think he’s been good for you too.  Just wanted to say that in case you needed to hear it -- I know this whole secret relationship thing must be hard sometimes.”
“Mmm, yes.  We’ll see how long that lasts.”
Finally, John pulled himself together and sighed. “I’m to be on parade in an hour. I should probably get moving if I want to make it in time.”
“Lieutenant-Colonel, this way, sir.” Lieutenant Glover was surprisingly young, but he had an air of indefatigable confidence as he led John to a door across the courtyard. Opening the door, he gestured for John to precede him into a luxurious vestibule. A grand staircase rose in front of them, covered with plush red carpeting, up which Lieutenant Glover led him. Just down a short corridor, they stopped outside an ornate door and the lieutenant raised his hand to knock, a succession of three quick raps against the paneling.
Received 13/5/2018 10:21
Since I was just planning to go back to my flat to spend the evening on my own, the possibility of a little company sounds wonderful.
John shook his head. “No, Sir. They listened quite respectfully—” He cut his eyes to Sherlock and Sherlock flushed at the memory of his behaviour in the pub, all the more embarrassing now that John knew he was speaking of his own father. John continued, “—and they liked it very much. I think they were grateful to you for your resolute leadership during the war. It helped a lot of people, Sir.”
Sherlock’s baritone rumbled near his right ear and John sucked in a gasp.  Distantly he heard the song still playing, but he was unable to move.  Embarrassment and arousal were at war within him.  When he didn’t move, Sherlock’s hands began shifting his hips for him, finding the rhythm, although rather disjointedly as John’s limbs no longer felt connected to his body.
John’s skin broke out in goose pimples, a shiver running down his spine. He felt slightly lightheaded.
And so I go.  With a new sense of determination, I push my way back out of the pub and stride along the street, back the way I came.
Shit.  I completely forgot about blocking it.  I really am a mess.  I text an affirmative to Greg and then spend five minutes trying to figure out how to block the number.  Bloody smartphone making me feel like an idiot.
“Well, fuck, mate.  I think you win the brownie tonight.”  Greg exclaims, blowing his breath out in a huff and shaking his head.
“Who’s that?” I ask Sherlock, wondering if he was expecting anyone to pop over this morning.
I slip on my trousers -- some rusty brown chinos that the lady in the shop convinced me to buy -- and do up a simple brown belt.  I forego my usual scuffed brown shoes for the only pair of dress shoes I own, a pair of deep mahogany Oxfords.  I deliberated for ages about taking a jacket, but couldn’t decide on one, so opted to go without.  Thankfully, it’s warm enough today for just a shirt.
Instead of shaking it, I place the rose between his fingers.  “For you.”
Papa paused his cutting of the ham on his plate and set down his cutlery, eyes trained on John. “Did you indeed? I presume that everyone was too occupied by their celebrations to take much notice.”
Despite the previous threats from his creepy brother and the fact that I’m completely furious with him for lying to me, I’m suddenly reminded of the fact that Sherlock is going through a shit time at the moment and is, apparently, being torn apart by the press.
“Shut up, Mycroft,” Sherlock shouts and then steps closer to me.  “John, please allow me to explain.”
He’s quiet for a few minutes.  I watch him, but he doesn’t seem to see me.  His brain is processing, sorting through the relevant details and solving the problem in front of him.  I wish I could be inside his mind to witness it, to see how he does it and I feel a pang at the realisation that such a thing will never be possible.
My throat feels strangely tight, so I just nod and ring it through, adding it to be bag containing the rest of his purchases.
With an elbow, Sherlock nudged John in an effort to get him away from the Colonel, with whom he was still engaged in a battle of wills.  When the stubborn man did not budge, Sherlock leapt down the stairs in a swirl of coat, ignoring the gasps and murmurs from those in the queue, and grabbed John by the arm, all but dragging him along.  “Have a splendid evening, gentleman!” he called over his shoulder with a laugh and started down the road.
“On the house, gentlemen!”  He sets it in the middle of the table and then glances knowingly between us, causing me to blush and Sherlock to roll his eyes, but we dig into the dessert once he leaves, giggling around each bite.
“He’s your brother?” I ask, my voice coming out sharper and higher pitched than normal.
- And the ‘Tom’ that Armon refers to is Tom Ford because his suits are amazing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The man designs a good suit!”
Sherlock gives me a knowing smile but thankfully doesn’t ask any more questions about that blasted book.  “Yes and no.  I will be travelling soon, but unfortunately it is for business and not pleasure.  I have a project starting next month and filming will take me to a few different locations.”
Sherlock stood next to the taxi, waiting for John to exit, and then he strode over to the gold-tipped, wrought iron gate and spoke quietly to one of the guards on duty. There was a flurry of activity behind the gate and a door was promptly opened to allow them through.
John H. Watson, former soldier turned hopeless bookseller turned man with no prospects.  Failure at life.
“Oh.”
“Okay, well. . . what now?”  John asked, slight confusion tingeing the question.
“He did.”  Sherlock’s tone is icy.  I’m reminded of how he reacted to Anderson the first day we met, and I want nothing more than to head off any altercation.
, which I’m embarrassed to admit to have watched.
No one asks me about my experiences in Afghanistan because I’ve made it clear to those who know me that it is off limits to them, an area of my life where they’re not invited.  Sherlock, however, seems to have invited himself right in and has no qualms in talking about it.  I’d say he was guessing, but he’s not been wrong about any of it, and I’d marvel at his incredible ability to read my life by simply looking at me if I wasn’t so thrown.
Sherlock shakes his head and says, “No talking.”  His voice is rough and even deeper than usual.
“What did it say?” Greg asks.
“‘This stops now.’”
What will the autumn winds stir up in John's life?
“Ah, of course,” the man says, lips pulling into a pursed half-smile.  “Some might call you brave, but I have found that the bravest of men can be the stupidest, especially when it comes to self-preservation,” he pauses as though gauging my reaction, and I try to keep my face blank.  “Mr. Watson, you have not heeded my warnings thus far so I thought it might be better to deliver another in person.”
It was broken a few minutes later, unexpectedly, by John.
I shrug, unsure of how to answer that question.  “Sherlock, do you know what’s going on?  I just. . . well, this is all a bit crazy.  Not just because a strange man turned up in my shop, but it also means that someone is interfering in your life and that’s just not on.”
“That’s brilliant!” I enthuse and Sherlock looks embarrassed by the attention, so I nudge his toe with mine and smile, causing him to blush even more.
John thought this seemed rather over-the-top considering the occasion. When all of Britain was celebrating, why was it necessary for Sherlock to be chaperoned home right now?  “What’s the urgency?” John asked.
“Sherlock, shut up,” John hissed, keeping an eye on one man who looked big enough and drunk enough to crush Sherlock.
Perhaps John deserved to hear the truth, no matter how much the idea of admitting it to him filled Sherlock with fear. He sucked in a fortifying breath and said, voice strained, “I did not wish to return quite yet.”
~~Nine-thirty in the evening~~
Their silent standoff tips me over the edge.
- Funny story - I was choosing the route of Sherlock and John’s walk at random just using the aerial Google map of Notting Hill and decided they’d jump the fence into the garden from Rosmead Rd. because it was slightly removed from any of the main thoroughfares.  After choosing this spot, I zoomed in and was disappointed to see that there weren’t trees overhanging the gate like there are in the movie but decided to just keep it and claim artistic license.  THEN @zigster-ao3, marvel that she is, digs up a list of filming locations from Notting Hill and it turns out that I randomly chose the EXACT SAME STREET and EXACT SAME GARDEN ENTRANCE that they used in the film.  What are the chances?! They’ve remodeled the gate since the film was made, so it now looks like this:
“Fuck me.  You’re Sherlock Holmes!”
He jerks his head in an abrupt nod, long fingers playing absentmindedly with the denim of his jeans around his knee.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, John, I can see that they are dancing, I have not lost my mental acuity in the last twenty minutes.” Turning his head, lips brushing against John’s ear, he whispered, “Although it was a near thing when you kissed me.”
“Hello?” I ask like an idiot, as if I don’t know who it is.
He hesitated, cheeks heating up. “I owe John some money.”
Sherlock squirmed but refused to let his discomfort reign. “Congratulations on your extensive knowledge of London geography, Papa.”
By Lauren Trevelyan
A whistle pierced the air and, passing Sherlock a tea towel, John said, “The handle will be hot. Now just fill up the teapot and we’ll let it steep for a few minutes.” John yawned. “The stronger the better.”
“It’s V-E Day and we will be celebrating.  Out there.”  Sherlock pointed towards the windows.
Sally has disappeared and Sherlock is now laying on the sofa, eyes closed with his hands pressed together under his chin in what I’ve come to recognise as his ‘thinking pose’.  He’s dressed in black trousers and a grey shirt, but the effect is marred slightly by the tatty dressing gown he’s thrown over the ensemble.
Sherlock and John, 1961. “Sherlock planned every detail, despite it being quite a modest affair. He insisted that we wear matching suits and chose a song for our first dance, which we had that evening alone in our drawing room. He was much less enthused the second time around, however.”
Sherlock harrumphs.  “No, I bought our dinner.  Sally just ensured that the order wouldn’t be traced back to me.”
With that, John’s lips had pressed to Sherlock’s again. It had felt like an eternity since they had last kissed. Sherlock had clasped John’s hand in his own to keep him close, allowing himself to be swept away by the feel of John’s mouth.
Well, he’d seen Sherlock do any number of ridiculous things, including whipping a corpse and taking the tube with a harpoon while covered in blood.  Sherlock could just piss off.
Perhaps if the t-shirt had been black he would have looked casually elegant, but as it is, he has a half-dressed look about him in his fine wool trousers and my basic white t-shirt bought in a multipack at Sainsbury’s.  Not to mention the fact that the t-shirt is far too small, the sleeves are stretched around his biceps and the hem barely meets the waistband of his trousers.
John was on his feet immediately and moved behind Sherlock’s chair.  “He’s just has a few too many, lads.  Doesn’t know what he’s on about.”
Captain John H. Watson wants nothing more than to spend VE Day in the peace and quiet of his sister's home. However, the night has other plans for him...
From across the table, Sherlock shot his brother a bright smile before Mycroft turned and strode from the room. Then he turned to Lestrade and said, “I am terribly sorry that you had to deal with him all evening, Major. He is such a bore.”
“It is obvious, John.” Sherlock sighed, maintaining a neutral tone of voice despite the excitement he felt at being proven right.
With a wave of his hand, Sherlock replied, “Mycroft has been ready to be king since he could first say the word. If I had not spent my childhood with him, I would think he had been a dull old man for the entirety of his life.”
“I demand you release him at once!”
Sherlock huffs a bit.  “You’re always thinking about food.”
Greg sighs.  “Fine.  Johnny, listen, since you met him, some really weird shit has been going on  -- things that don’t normally happen to you, military experience aside.  While I’m concerned about all that because I’m your friend and I care about you, I also know that I haven’t seen you so alive in all the time I’ve known you, even with Mary.  And I know it’s scary to think about jumping into this with him, but there’s something there and. . . I don’t want you to miss out on being happy.”
Below him, the private groaned and John quickly refocused his attention on the injured man, leaving Sherlock to prowl around the shrubbery and flowers on the other side of the railing.  John rolled the soldier into the recovery position, lest he be sick and start to choke on his own vomit, and began taking his pulse.
Greg shrugs.  “It’s not gossip though, is it -- it’s your life.”
Sherlock is standing in the corridor, watching me as I prepare to leave the flat.  I try to ignore the weight of his gaze as I gather up my jacket and keys.  Finally, I meet his eye and say, “Well, I’ll see you later, then.  Um. . . text if you want me to pick anything up.  I’ll be home about half-six.”  It feels oddly like a daily routine -- Sherlock sending me off to work in the morning, discussing our plans for that evening.  Stop it, Watson, you romantic git.
John and Sherlock reach Trafalgar Square - what adventures await them there?
John laughed. “Seven pounds, eleven and four pence.”
On my way out of the office, I grab my lunch - a meal deal from Boots -- and return to the counter.  I slide over the stack of new guidebooks about Senegal to ensure they remain unmarked by any flying bits of food.  My sandwich is rather limp and unappetising, but seeing as I can’t go out to find a replacement meal unless I want to close the shop, I push through and finish it.  I’m just reaching for the packet of crisps (should have gone for the fruit option really, not getting any younger, but I’m a sucker for crisps in any way at any time -- total guilty pleasure), when the bell above the door rings to announce a customer, or perhaps just a lost tourist.
- The BBC Breakfast Show is actually broadcast from MediaCityUK at Salford Quays in Greater Manchester - something I learned while researching for this fic because I assumed they still filmed in London.  Anyway, we’re going to pretend they never made the move so that Sherlock can simply go across the city for his interview and be back with John in as little time as possible.  It used to be broadcast from Television Centre in White City, West London which is just a couple miles from John’s flat, which works much better for my purposes.  Everyone cool with that? Okay, good.
From where they’re sitting, John can only make out an odd phrase here or there.
I pause in my reading, mark my place, and wiggle my toes where they’re wedged under Sherlock’s thigh (who is still only covered in the bedsheet -- Sally seems used to this behaviour, but to me it’s just distracting), which prompts him to shift the papers in his hands and grasp my ankle lightly, all while continuing to dictate a revision to Sally about one of the documents.
“What the bloody hell are you doing in my flat?”  I demand, pulling my shoulders back to square up to this vile man once again.  After so many months, the incident in the shop had started to fade and I was able to go through my days without looking over my shoulder anymore, but now he’s standing in my flat and it’s as if no time has passed.  I’m shocked, obviously, but I mainly feel angry that my space -- first the shop and now my home -- has been invaded by Sherlock’s stalker.
Caught up in his mind, Sherlock had allowed the dull noise of conversation to wash over him until he was interrupted by the mention of his name.
What does he mean he didn’t know where else to go?  A rush of panic zips down my spine like I haven’t felt since the incident with the strange texts.  I scan the street behind Sherlock, wondering if we're being watched again, but nothing unusual catches my attention.  While I don’t know what it is that has Sherlock worried, I also can’t leave him on the doorstep with that look on his face.  Stepping back, I push the door wider so that he can enter and proceed to lock it again behind him.
.  It’s one of my absolute favourites -- such a beautiful film and your performance was amazing!”
Shaking himself of that niggling worry and with a burst of false determination, Sherlock strode across the foyer and came to a stop at the foot of the stair, John close behind him.
“It does not matter.”
Reminding himself that it was all an act, he schooled his face back into his fake smile and turned to the woman in the green dress. “And you are?”
After one final door, Sherlock and John entered a bright antechamber, the wood panels having been removed from the windows that surrounded the first floor the previous day, allowing the early morning sunlight to stream through them. Across the way, a carpeted staircase rose to meet the balcony that surrounded the room, and Sherlock was horrified to see Papa and Mummy waiting for him at the top. He had hoped to slip into the drawing room with some time for John to acclimate before being forced to deal with meeting the King and Queen. Apparently, it was not to be so. They must have been alerted the moment he and John turned up at the gate.
“Would you care for another cup?” Sherlock asked, gesturing to the teapot. He seemed oddly eager to pour again and John wasn’t going to deny him.
John drew himself up, suddenly self-conscious in his civilian clothes. “Lieutenant-Colonel John Watson here to see Prince William.”
I suddenly can’t be in the same room as Anderson a moment longer. “I’m going for a walk - you man the shop. Cheers for the coffee.” I tip my cup at him and make my way out the door to get lost in the thrum of the city.
Standing inside the foyer, I lean against the door and pull out my phone, swiping it unlocked and frantically opening Messages.  There, at the top of the list, is Sherlock’s name.  I click on it to reveal the message he sent.
Collecting rogue Chinese takeaway containers and a few old newspapers, John tipped the lot into the bin before sweeping the sitting room and kitchen for dirty teacups and dishes, fishing a butter-smeared knife from between the sofa cushions and a dinner plate from where it was shoved under Sherlock’s chair.
She just shushes me and opens the door wider so I can pass through.
Sherlock glanced away, his cheeks pinking up even in the dim light. “It was a gamble. I was hoping that by making reference to two high ranking officers, the doorman might be persuaded to let us in.  However, my assumption that a connection to the General would be enough to grant us entry into the Curzon Club was, as you have just witnessed, woefully misguided.”
“No, William,” Prince Henry barked.
“Where are we going?”
Sherlock grinned. “This is me taking it easy.”
No, it’s best that we remain friends.  Less messy that way.  I can be there for him during this whole drama with the press, and then afterwards we can continue to see each other and chat but with no pressure for it to be anything more or to attempt to merge our worlds.  It makes sense.
Actually, business has been better over the last few months and now I open QuickBooks without the sense of dread that had accompanied the task for so long.  Amazingly, we’re in the black and I’ve been able to pay the bills, our wages, and build our reserves without worry.  Maybe I’m not so rubbish at this whole small-business owner thing.
Sherlock doesn’t answer and he doesn’t move.  It only lasts for a moment, but it’s like his hard drive faltered briefly before continuing to function as normal.  “After I left Switzerland, I dedicated myself completely to every project I was attached to for nearly ten years -- I was, to put it colloquially, married to my work.  I don’t think I realised how transitory and. . . precious everything is until recently, but I have been reminded of what is truly important and I feel more grateful now for the opportunities that have been afforded to me.”
We’ve just had a major sales push for books about Southeast Asia, the hot new travel destination according to some poll Anderson found on the Internet, and I am attempting to square the books to see how we’ve done. Double-checking the figures I’d entered on the calculator, I hit the equals button and close my eyes for a second, sending up a brief prayer to whatever god is up there, and then look down --
Sherlock scanned the crowd and it appeared that all women in their vicinity had already been claimed, but he spied two brunette women making their way over from the bar. Before anyone else could swoop in, Sherlock slipped past John with a muttered “wait here” and approached the women, one taller in a green dress with a sleek updo and the other in yellow with her hair curling over her shoulders.
He needed to move quickly.  Once it became clear Prince William was missing, every single officer inside would snap to attention.  He spied a door on his left, along the exterior wall, and pushed on it, stumbling a bit as he emerged in the close lane behind the Ritz.  The heavy door swung shut but he caught it before it slammed, gently closing it with minimal sound.  To his right, a perpendicular lane continuing off in either direction with a brick wall rising up straight ahead.  To his left, Sherlock could hear the main road and see pedestrians passing by, oblivious to the man observing them down the small lane.
“Yes, get out of here because then we can finally talk about you and Sherlock!” Harry says with a devious grin.
Raising an eyebrow, he opens the door and asks, “Shall we?”
“Just in time to join the bloodborne pathogen chat,” I tell Mike as I send them into the sitting room so I can hang up Nicola’s coat.  There is an eruption of voices as introductions are made and drinks orders are placed.  I’m secretly glad to be avoiding this part but also feel bad leaving Sherlock on his own to be introduced to my friends.
“Hello, John,” he rumbles, stepping closer to the counter.
“I am sorry, John. It was not my intention to deceive you.”
With a salute, Captain Ashford departed, closing the door behind him and trapping John in with the ever-growing stack of papers on his desk. The administrative hassle of managing a hospital was his least favourite part of the job. He was rubbish at it, to be honest, and was grateful for the assistance of the secretary that had been assigned to the hospital when the British Army joined the war in Korea. Despite her help, John was still burdened with seemingly endless accounts, patient lists, reports of supply levels and order forms, enquiries from families, and on and on. The sight of all the paper made him yearn for active duty just to escape it.
“My therapist suggested writing as a creative outlet for exploring. . . stuff, and I showed a few pages to Harry and it just sort of grew from there.  She’s illustrating it now.”
Sally is making notes on her phone again, nodding as Sherlock speaks.  “I’ll write up a strategy for these interviews and brief you on it later.”
Sherlock could tell that John was overawed by being in Buckingham Palace. Most commoners were. Despite his outwardly calm appearance, John was breathing harshly through his nose, as though high on the adrenaline of battle. John’s distress caused Sherlock to also feel a pang of guilt for thrusting this upon him, but it was necessary. The only way to ensure John did not experience any repercussions for their adventures tonight was to have him here and grant him the protection of his family.
In a way, I’m glad.  I don’t want to involve Anderson in this mess, even if he does annoy the shit out of me sometimes.  I’d rather keep it contained and get it over with as soon as possible.  And thank god for CCTV.  With that thought, I realise I should call Greg.
Sally finally clocks me and she bustles over to where I’m hovering near the doorway between the kitchen and sitting room.  “Hello, lover boy,” she purrs with a smirk, unable to resist an opportunity to take the piss.  “He’s in the shower.  I can distract the others if you want to slip in there with him.”
Sherlock watched as Barnes sputtered and shoved Ste in the shoulder.  “Yer one to talk, mate.  I need more booze if I’m gonna have to look at your face all evening.”  With that, he pulled a flask from his pocket and waved it at the group.
“Crazy about Sherlock Holmes, isn’t it?” he asks, mid-morning when we’re between customers.  He’s flipping through a tattered copy of the Metro, where Sherlock’s face is, of course, splashed across the front page.
He had only ever looked out on it from a chauffeured car, so to be amongst the crowd of revellers was like nothing he had ever experienced.  Sherlock could feel the energy of it thrumming across his skin, lighting up each nerve with a delicious need to see, touch, and taste.
Despite the weariness in his bones, and the old ache in his shoulder, he couldn’t fall back asleep. His exhaustion was compounded by the sense of grief that had swept the nation over the last week. The melancholy darkness of the early morning was fitting for the occasion really.
John was livid, and he was also suddenly exhausted. He had no desire to go anywhere with them, but he also wanted to be as far away from the Colonel and his redhats as possible. Leaving now would allow him to scarper as soon as he got outside the barrack gates. His sister’s flat wasn’t too far from here and if he got away quickly, he could kip for a few hours before he needed to be on parade at Woolwich Common.
John had been focused on Sherlock’s hands, where he held them awkwardly between their bodies, fingers still pressing to the closure. With surety, John had reached out to grasp Sherlock’s right hand and rubbed his fingers over the fine taupe leather. The motion had been mesmerising to Sherlock, and he had tracked the movement across his knuckles in a sort of daze.
Sherlock released an undignified snort of laughter before he could catch it. John was wonderful.
"But I did see him. He still doubts it, even if all these years," Sherlock says with the air of someone repeating an old argument. "And I told John when we met again that I would know him anywhere." John shakes his head and says, "If I didn't know what happened next, then I would think it a tall tale indeed. I still find it hard to believe."
At some point the song ended, but neither John nor Sherlock registered it, lost as they were in their own dance of slow hands.
Setting the paper on the table in the kitchen, I fill the kettle to prepare myself a cup of tea and pop some bread in the toaster for toast with jam.  Breakfast made, I plop down in my chair and open the paper to the puzzles section.  Usually it’s just a half-hearted attempt to fill in the Sudoku puzzle for me, but today I look at the clues for the crossword puzzle instead.
John gets his act together.  Finally.
“I would disappear into the labyrinth of London,” Sherlock stated definitely. “I want to get to know the truth of this place, breathe it in—feel every quiver of its beating heart.”
After long minutes of navigating the masses, they reached the base of the monument.  Sherlock turned to look out at the sea of people, and John came to a stop in front of him.
Greg’s booming laugh echoes off the kitchen cabinets and I giggle along with him.  Eventually we pull ourselves together, collect the wine glasses from the counter and make our way back to the sitting room.
When we’d exchanged numbers yesterday, this is not quite what I expected.  His disdain for normal social conventions, his demands, and his random asides via text are wonderful.
A grin creeps across my face.  “I think I have, Greg.”
“No one’s gonna take away from tonight, we’ve waited too bloody long for it, especially a little gobshite like you.” The man closed in on Sherlock, looming over the table.
Mike adds, “Why the hell are you here, mate?”
Beside him, John was happily tucking into the remaining portion on his plate. After taking a large bite, he set down his cutlery, glanced across the table and then at Sherlock, shooting him a covert wink.
“I think it’s time you left, as well.  Goodbye, Sally,” Sherlock says as he starts to herd her out of the flat.  She grabs her handbag from the floor next to the coffee table as she passes, stumbling slightly and Sherlock only just lets her regain her balance before she’s pushed into the corridor and towards the front door.
I set Sherlock the task of dicing an onion as I pull out a saucepan and add a dash of olive oil, instructing Sherlock to toss in the diced onion to saute, and then move to preheat the oven and retrieve a baking tray for the salmon.
“Perhaps it would an opportunity to put some of those books in your shop to use?”
Despite this being my home, I feel like I’m intruding, and I’m not sure what to do with myself.  Do I demand that they leave?  Should I go into the kitchen to give them some privacy?  Uncertain, I sit awkwardly on the arm of the sofa and sip my coffee, attempting to simultaneously stake my claim on the sitting room, feed my own curiosity about the details of the situation, and be a silent support for Sherlock, especially when faced with these two overbearing people.
I think about him at odd times nearly every day, especially when I see something that reminds me of him or when Anderson does something stupid and I know it would make him laugh or when I simply wish I could hear his voice.
“Cease your flailing.  It is only me.” His captor snapped in a harsh whisper, warm breath fluttering against the back of John’s ear.  The deep baritone and precise elocution was instantly familiar to John.  “I shall release you if you promise to not draw attention to our position.”
As always, thanks to @eternaljohnlock and @zigster-ao3 for helping me get this ready to post! x
- Printworks Coffee is actually the name of a coffeeshop in Edinburgh, not London, but I walk passed it every day on the way to work and just wanted to use the name in the story.
With a flourish, Sherlock produced the flask from his pocket and handed it over to John.
.  Once this silent conversation has ended, I flick my head towards the kitchen,  “I’ll go help him with the drinks.  No fangirling while I’m gone, okay, Mols?”
“Isn’t it? The tea is in the tin just there and the teapot is on the draining board. This seems like a three-scoop night - don’t tell Harry.”
Sherlock took a moment, considering. “The Ritz was so terribly dull, Papa.”
Sherlock is standing so close -- I’m not sure if he moved or I did, but he’s closer now and my hands are itching to reach out and touch him.
Sherlock’s hand tightens briefly on my arm and he turns his head to nuzzle into my chest, coming slowly awake.
“Bye, Greg.”
⟪Called Sally to sort out.  Ignore previous message.  Dinner should be here by the time you get home.  SH⟫
I shovel another forkful of rice into my mouth, and then ask, “So how did the story leak, do you know?”
Sherlock hums, thinking.
Sherlock may be nervous, but John could handle being thrown into this world, of that he was certain.
Embarrassment and anger bubble up inside of me and I clench my fists as if to physically restrain myself from responding with equal venom.  It’s a challenge to stay quiet, but I force myself to remember that this is his night and that this is not the time to start a fight.
No one speaks up immediately and I’m sure as hell not going to explain.
⟪It’s come to my attention that you’ve made the acquaintance of Sherlock Holmes. I strongly suggest you sever your connection with him immediately.⟫
“Thanks for that.  What the fuck do I do, Greg?”
“. . . still surrounded so you’re best staying away for awhile, and maybe don’t go out at all, at least not for a couple days, if you can avoid it.  Let us handle it from the office -- don’t give them any other ammunition to use against you,” she tells Sherlock and then she turns to me, adding with a wink, “I assume you’re happy to share your bed for a few more days, hm, John?”
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed with a sigh.
John found himself unceremoniously released, the redhat next to him snapping, “Show some respect for your Princes, Captain.”
“And I you, for honouring me with your company.”
~~Eleven o’clock in the evening~~
I realise I’m smiling at my phone and quickly slip it into my pocket before Anderson notices anything unusual in my behaviour.  I focus on tidying the shop and then, when the clock strikes six, flip the sign to ‘closed’ and lock the door.  As I’m cashing out for the night, my phone buzzes again.
Sherlock meets my eye for a moment, a glint of hardness there.  “The fame thing isn't really real, you know.”
“Mmm.”  Which is most definitely not the reply you want to hear from a famous actor who may or may not be judging you for knowing about 50 Shades of Grey.
“Sherlock, who told you were behaving recklessly?”  Even though I already know, I ask anyway.
Sherlock looks pleased by my response and continues his lecture.  “In the centre of Holyrood Park in Edinburgh, there is a hill, part of an ancient volcanic chain, called Arthur’s Seat -- the name’s a trifle fanciful, if you ask me, and inaccurate considering the legend of King Arthur is so closely tied to Wales -- but when you walk through the park you get the sense that you could be in the far reaches of the Highlands instead of in the city, due to the rocky outcroppings that formed as the glaciers pushed across the land.  One can breathe there.  And if you walk just fifteen minutes up the crags, you overlook the city and can see for miles on a clear day, across the water and into the lower hills of the Highlands.”
“You find my mouth distracting?” I ask, aiming for sultry, but it sounds ridiculous to my own ears and I end up giggling.
Sherlock poured the water with the concentration of a professional chemist and carefully carried the full teapot over to the table as if  it might explode in his hands.
The doorman looked up, startled.  “Are you on the list, sir?”
But Sherlock did not appear remotely intimidated. Instead he seemed to grow more sure, more...powerful. It was a strange juxtaposition, comparing this Sherlock to the one who’d trembled in his arms after they’d kissed. (The kiss itself was too big, too wonderful and too scary to fully inspect right now. John packed it away in his mind.)
At half-past seven in the morning, while I’m just boiling the kettle for a cup of tea, Sherlock lets himself into my flat.  I had keys cut for him last week after realising the odd hours he kept during a press tour and it’s so much easier now that we’re not trying to coordinate our schedules -- he can just let himself in when he needs to, instead of waiting for me to get home.
Breakfast at Buckingham Palace was usually a family affair, so it was curious to have other people join them. The space to his left was typically unoccupied, as was the one directly across from him, leaving Sherlock to often feel like the odd man out of his family, not included in the inner circle of the King, the Queen and the dutiful heir. John’s presence next to him here made him feel less alone, and he brushed his elbow against John’s, much like they had while seated at the small table at Chelsea Barracks, just because he could and he wanted to.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.”
“People do little else.”  Sherlock’s eyes are gleaming in the darkness.
And yet.
He’s still naked and burrowed under the duvet, so that leaves answering the door up to me.  I fish out a striped, long sleeve t-shirt from my dresser, pulling it on as I go to open to the door.
After waiting an age for the barkeep to serve him, John made his way back to the table to find Sherlock sprawled in his chair, tapping incessantly at the table, unaware of John’s approach.
“Oh, and you do?” I stare the man down for a few seconds before continuing, “He’s a grown man, who is clearly intelligent and talented.  I’m fairly certain he can make up his own mind about what’s best for him, and if that includes me, then that’s up to him.”
Military officers in their dress uniforms, medals shiny against Army green or Navy blue, gathered in groups, some accompanied by women in evening gowns, pearls, and gloves.  Sherlock spied a particular General with his arm around a woman who was most definitely not his wife, his cheeks reddened from laughter and alcohol.  A few minor nobles were present as well, Sherlock recognised them from tedious events he was forced to attend throughout the war, where they bemoaned the loss of life on the battlefield while being perfectly aware of the fact that due to their status, they, nor their sons, would have ever ended up there.  Hypocrites, Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes.  Waiters rushed back and forth, fetching empty glasses and delivering new drinks before the guests even realised theirs were empty.
While this letter is undoubtedly a surprise, I very much hope you will join me for tea tomorrow at two o’clock at my apartments in Kensington Palace.
“Yeah, how did you meet?”  Greg asks.
“Good morning,” I say, pressing a kiss into his hair.
“Yes, well, your hair still has that too short and too neat look: a cut of habit. Your posture, once you’re not slumped over your desk, screams soldier - even now you’re standing at parade rest - and when you mentioned the book about conflict and military history, it was clear that it was a subject you knew well.”
John glanced at Sherlock and opened his mouth to reply that he had no power to force Sherlock to go anywhere against his will, but Sherlock beat him to it.
It’s dark outside and I can only make out an outline of the person standing on the other side of the glass, but I’d know that voice anywhere.  I’ve spent the last three months listening to it -- I know how it sounds in different accents, when it whispers and when it shouts, and, from a memory, when it rumbled right next to my ear.
“William,” Papa scolded, turning an unimpressed gaze on his younger son.  “I am granting you permission to take in the atmosphere outside the palace because of the importance of this day.  However, you are still my son and a crowned prince of this realm.  I will not see you disgracing your name or this house by gallivanting through the crowds in the streets.  You go to the Ritz or you remain here.  Those are your choices.”
From what John had experienced of the elder prince, he knew this was not a compliment. Even so, he felt like he had a duty to return Sherlock home.
Sherlock was so earnest and yet so frustrated at the same time, and John found it all so bloody endearing, God help him. He smiled, a small, secret smile just for Sherlock.
Today you'll get a special treat - the final chapter and the epilogue!
“You want to feed the beast.”  The expression on Mycroft’s face is one of extreme disgust and animosity.  “I have always wondered why Sherlock was so adamant about keeping you around -- your decision making is clearly questionable.  But then, maybe that’s what attracts him to you?  You are kindred spirits.”
“Bloody princes. Just my sodding luck,” John muttered under his breath.
“Bleeding’s stopped. How does it feel when you move your nose?”
As he neared the corner, he allowed himself to glance at the wing mirror, catching sight of John still standing in the road. Sherlock saw him smile as he lifted a hand and waved.
“Sir,” he said, nodding to Sherlock, and then addressed John. “Captain.”
“Oh, sod a dog.  I’ve made the wrong decision, haven’t I?”
Sherlock laughs, delighted.  “You’re not wrong.”

(See the end of the chapter for
“We heard your speech, Sir. We were in a pub and they had the radio turned up so everyone could hear.”
They watched the taxi pull away, make a slow turn in the roundabout up ahead, and then drive past them in the opposite direction, towards Westminster. Sherlock had an impish smile on his face and John couldn’t help but laugh.
Papa was seated at his desk, writing, as they entered the library.  Mummy closed her book and rose from her chair, moving to stand in front of them.  She took in Sherlock’s outfit with a look of vague disapproval and confusion, but before she could ask the question he could see in her eyes, there was a knock on the door.
“Very,” Sherlock says with a smile, and he leans in to kiss me again, softer this time.
In what seems to be a pattern, I’m caught off guard by him and have trouble formulating a response.  I settle on “uh huh”, which is the opposite of how I’d hope to handle this moment.  Not that I truly thought I’d be running into Sherlock Holmes for a second time today.
With a roll of his eyes, looking every inch the annoyed younger brother, Sherlock said, “Mycroft, I cannot return in this state. What would Papa and Mummy think? And it is possible that the good Major Lestrade would be punished for allowing harm to come to me. I shall go with John to make myself presentable and then return to the palace, all shiny and new.” He turned to John, “Is that all right? Will your sister mind?”
Angelo hands me a menu while Sherlock just waves him off and requests his “usual”.  Angelo bows his head in acknowledgement and then asks, “Would you like anything to drink besides the wine?”
From there, the camera zeroes in on the presenters, cutting Sherlock from the shot, as they segue to the next segment on honey bees.  I breathe a sigh of relief that it’s over.  It was hard enough for me to watch so I can’t imagine how Sherlock feels after having to discuss his personal life on national television.  It must be the absolute worst thing about his job.
And then Sherlock’s pocket chimes.
As Woolwich Common drew nearer, Sherlock slowed the car in an attempt to draw out these last few moments together.
After watching them go back and forth, John burst out with “Chelsea Barracks!”
“That was ridiculous.”
Sherlock watched as John gave her a comforting smile and offered her his arm. “I’m hoping you know how to do this dance because otherwise we’re in trouble,” he said, turning to walk Molly out onto the dancefloor.
I look at him for a moment to see if he’s joking.  From most people, this question would indicate that they were fishing for compliments, but from Sherlock, despite his celebrity status, it seems genuine.  Where to start with my answer?
Sherlock appears to be holding his breath.
Because we all know things didn't end with a slow dance in the kitchen...
We rush ahead.  I stumble slightly on a root as we slip behind the tree and into the darkness to be hidden from view.  My right shoulder is pressed firmly against Sherlock’s chest, but I’m afraid to move.  The footsteps on the gravel are nearer and I can hear voices -- two of them, one male and one female.
“I told you it was someone horrible,” he responds, his voice carrying clearly from the bedroom, and Sally smirks like the cat who got the cream.  My cheeks burn.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, propelling himself to his feet, all cat-like grace and intent with purpose, and begins clawing at his tuxedo, pieces falling inelegantly to the floor.  I watch him while I kick the duvet away, glad to be free of it.  More quickly than I expected, considering the number of layers he was wearing, he’s naked and back in my arms, kissing me everywhere wildly and pulling at the t-shirt and boxers I have on.
God.  The shift from imperious to uncertain happens so suddenly, I can feel a lump forming in my throat.  Sherlock is simultaneously a powerful force of nature and the most fragile vessel of pure emotion.
“No, I think it’ll be fine.  Anderson is back now, and I think he specifically waited until he was out for lunch before coming in.  It’s me he wants to threaten, but I don’t think he wants anyone else to know, which is fucking nuts.”
“What's on today, then?”
Ten minutes later, I’m at my door.  I take a deep breath before putting the key in the lock and pushing into my flat.
Thank you so much to everyone who's read, left kudos and commented on this fic so far.  It's been so much fun to write and I hope you continue to enjoy it!
I wander for a few minutes until my phone alerts me to his response.
While my brain is buzzing along in a state of simultaneous contentment and excitement, Sherlock sleeps on, every once in a while snuffling adorably in his sleep.  He’s sprawled on his stomach, one leg thrown over mine, left arm draped across me and his long fingers curled around my right bicep where it rests against the duvet.  Every inch of him is gloriously naked and my fingers itch to explore the soft expanses of skin again, our exploits of last night already feeling long ago.  I trail my left hand across his shoulder, over the planes of his back, dipping into the dimples at the bottom of his spine, and then retrace the journey back up until my fingers are buried his tangled nest of curls.
Sherlock is starfished across the bed on his stomach, arms tucked up under the pillow, duvet bunched around his waist.  He looks gloriously warm and sleep-rumpled and I’m overwhelmed by the magnitude of the feelings swirling around in my chest.  I just want to stay in this little cocoon of ours forever and ignore the world outside.  I don’t get to observe him for long because he’s heard my approach and peels his eyes open.  Sluggishly, he props himself against the headboard, settling the duvet around him, and reaches out for the cup of tea I’m holding out.
John pressed on either side of the bridge of his nose and moved slowly downward, keeping his touch gentle but firm enough to feel the bones under the skin. Sherlock flinched minutely when he pressed near his nostrils - bruised, most likely. John continued his examination along Sherlock’s sharp cheekbones, just to ensure there was no underlying fracture, but Sherlock did not react negatively to any areas of pressure.
In front of him, the Colonel was ranting about John's earlier conduct, spittle flying out of his mouth as he spoke. While John usually deferred to those who outranked him without question, something about this officer made his hackles rise. Despite the desire to tell him off, he opted to keep silent until the Colonel finished his tirade, focusing on not letting the irritation show on his face.
Sherlock shook his head.  “No, I shall leave the flag-waving to you.  You are so remarkably good at it.  And besides, I have a different mission.”
It is what it is.
“Well, drink up then.  Don’t want that pint to go to waste.”
Like he could ever say no to Sherlock. Despite feeling a sense of inevitability, John attempted an ambivalent shrug. “No, it’s okay. Let’s get you cleaned up.”
I take the cup with a grimace and glance to my left, at the customer, ready to apologise for my arsehole of an assistant. The man is holding two of the books I had recommended - the ones about Afghan history and military interventions, I am strangely pleased to note - and is gazing at Anderson with distaste.
“No.”
Sherlock’s eyes crinkle as he smiles up at me.  “You’re hired,” he says with a laugh and then we’re kissing again after so long, and it feels so bloody right, despite the awkwardness of my position,  leaning over Sherlock like I am. I’d suggest moving elsewhere, but his mouth is far too tempting to pull away.  Sherlock’s hands drift from my arms to my ribs down to my waist and the back of my legs and I suddenly find myself unceremoniously pulled onto his lap, knees wedged tightly between his hips and the chair, and I let out an ‘oomph’ of surprise.
But then he shakes his head and smiles softly.  “I can’t, John.  I’m sorry.”
“It’s not quite six yet -- are you going to close up early?”  He asks this so earnestly that it shakes the nervousness from me and the excitement takes over.
Out of everyone here, John deserved to be celebrating - not only was the war over, one in which he had fought at the western front, but he also survived a grievous wound.  It struck Sherlock as highly unfair that John was uncomfortable amidst such revelry.  Sherlock himself was not always comfortable amongst large crowds, but it felt right to be out here tonight, and he would do his best to tolerate annoying, simple-minded people if it meant that John was happy.
I twist out the cup marked for Sherlock and set it on the table next to him and deposit the bag of sweet pastries beside it.  Grudgingly, I take sip of the drink for me and nearly groan at the taste.  It’s cappuccino perfection.
The rain hasn’t let up all day and Sherlock arrives with his coat collar turned up against the weather, his curls limp and dripping.  My heart rate speeds up at the sight of him, but I’m also nervous.  Things have been odd since we spoke last night.
Sherlock’s shoulders lifted in an awkward shrug.  “As you might have gathered, John, following the events of the evening so far, I cannot say I have much of a plan.”
John felt dazed, and it must have showed on his face because Sherlock’s expression shifted and he set down his teacup.
It's time for the premiere of Sherlock's film -- oh, the excitement and the stress!
John’s heart clenched at the idea of Sherlock desperately wanting to dance, to be intimate, to share his heart with someone and holding himself back for years. He wished he’d known so he could have….well, he doesn’t know what he’d have done. Probably panicked again and insisted that he was ‘not gay’, but that was never really the truth.  He can accept that now.  After all, he’s wrapped up in Sherlock’s arms like he belongs there.  Not exactly something mates do.
Harry’s flat was a series of small rooms - a sitting room with an old settee and a few odd side tables, a bedroom with barely enough room for a bed and a bureau, a kitchen with a tiny table and two chairs, and a washroom no bigger than a cupboard. Harry loved it, and it was more than John had to his name. Sherlock looked around, taking in the state of the flat, and John hoped he wouldn’t judge the Watsons too harshly.
And so begins a new habit -- whenever I can’t sleep, which is often, I watch something else from Sherlock’s filmography.  I start with his earliest work and then over the weeks, progress through his entire IMDB page.
I even practiced saying it out loud a couple of times just to see if that helped make sense of it.  It didn’t.)
“No, John, but thank you.”
At the thought, John said a brief prayer, as he had done frequently since the news of his death had been announced, in memory of the King and for Sherlock in his mourning.
The one in the green dress looked him up and down before turning to her friend and raising an eyebrow. Her friend smiled and nodded shyly, which Sherlock counted as a success.
As Sherlock watched John walk away, he found that dancing suddenly lost its appeal, but he turned his attention back to Irene, saying, “Shall we?”
They were followed by a contingent of Calvary riders, at least thirty of them in formation, the clip-clop of horses' hooves the only sound to be heard in the echoing square. Then came the Royal Scots pipe and drum corps, silent and carrying their instruments. Perhaps they would play once they reached the station to send the King on his way to his final resting place at Windsor.
A bit of foam trails down the side of the pint glass, I mark it’s progress until it reaches the bar, leaving a wet ring on the wood.  While it would be a simple thing to raise the glass to my lips, beer suddenly seems wholly unappealing.
“Very.”  And I am.  His lips are exactly in my sightline and I can’t stop watching the way they move when he forms each syllable, and my own tongue darts out reflexively to trace the path of his thumb across my bottom lip.
Like Saturday, I find myself counting down the minutes until the end of the workday but this time trying to hide my excitement from Anderson.  Thankfully he’s as observant as a spoon.
“John!”
His tongue frequently got him into trouble, but he knew he was still safely within the limits as his father just looked at him, eyes hardening slightly, before deciding it was not worth the fight and instead turning to Mycroft and Major Lestrade to discuss the details of their outing.  Sherlock didn’t listen.  If he was going to be forced to attend a sanctioned party at the Ritz under the annoyingly watchful eye of his brother and this Army yes-man Lestrade, then he would need to be exceedingly clever in how he gave them the slip.  Best to lull them into a false sense of security beginning now.
“Would you have understood?”
Well, we’re halfway there!  I honestly can’t believe I’ve made it this far -- a multi-chapter fic was, and still is, a daunting prospect, but I’m so proud of what I’ve pulled together and it’s been a joy to experience your reactions to each chapter.  Thank you so much!
With a smirk, Sherlock said, “Wait here,” and leapt down from the lion statue.
“Wait, what?”  I’ve clearly missed something here.
.  I wake up squinting on Saturday morning, glaring sunlight shining on my face because I forgot to close the curtains last night and my shoulder and back are stiff from spending the night passed out in the armchair.
Sherlock’s head was a whirlwind of irritation and panic, neither of which he would have admitted to if asked. Seeing as he was alone, at least for the moment, having abandoned John to finish the conversation with Lestrade, he took a pause to address them directly.
A second voice joined hers.  “Doesn’t quite know how to the wear the crown, does he?  Not like his older brother.  Prince Henry has such a sense of duty.”
With reluctance, John took the envelope.
“Yes, thank you, Sally,” Sherlock retorts, and then turns back to me.  “Thai?”
How dare that man tell him anything about his limp - he had no idea about the injury John had sustained and the months of painful rehabilitation he’d gone through.  To stand there, so full of himself and unmarked by the war, and tell John that it was all in his head!  It was too much.  Half of him wanted to storm into the pub - John had finally noticed the sign hanging above his head - and tell him off, perhaps take a swing at that smug face.  The other half wanted to stomp away into the night, cursing the nameless man until his temper had diminished.
Sherlock took a deep breath, allowing the sweet, warm air to pass through his lungs and ground him in the present. All around him, people were waking to a brand new world, one in which they could grieve their losses, nurse their wounds, and celebrate what still remained.
“Enough already.  Go get our food.”  If he could flop back in his chair, I’d think he would.  As it is, he has to pretend sulk without any additional dramatic flair.  Angelo booms out a laugh, slaps Sherlock’s shoulder once more and then disappears into the kitchen.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “My obnoxious brother.”
~~9th April 1952~~
He panted out a few breaths and looked at John, who seemed strangely out of focus, but he noticed that John’s lips were red and he had a starry-eyed look about him too.
“Sherlock. . .” she says, a warning edge to her voice.
“Um, did you find everything?”
~~Two o’clock in the morning~~
“Oh, John!  This is for you!”  Harry rushes into the hall and passes me an A4 envelope, before giving me a final hug and whispering loudly, “I’m sorry if I embarrass you, Johnny.  Love you!”  She goes to rejoin the others, and then pauses at the door.  “Oi, Sherlock!  Marry Johnny so we can be sisters!” she shouts, cackling as she escapes back into the sitting room.

The man nodded perfunctorily. “I have a message for you, Sir.” Without further ado, he opened the messenger bag hanging over his shoulder and removed a cream-coloured envelope, stepping forward to hold it out to John.
With that, I am certain I am gaping at him in the most unattractive fashion, but I can’t help it.  For months, I daydreamed about him saying words like this, hoping he’d recognise his error and try to win me back.  But now that he’s here and it’s actually happening, it suddenly feels like too much -- the rooms seems warmer, my pulse ratchets up, and sweat breaks out on the back of my neck.
It’s Sherlock.  Thank god.
While Sherlock had been worried about how this experience would affect John, John himself was clearly enjoying himself. He was relaxed and cheeky, despite the unfamiliar, ornate surroundings, and the fact that he was so effortlessly himself, when Sherlock frequently felt awkward and out of place, caused him a small amount of jealousy, but mostly he was delighted.
His eyes snap to mine and his expression shifts from surprised to flattered in split second.  It transforms his face -- there’s a warmth in his eyes and his mouth seems even poutier, if such a thing were possible.  I lick my lips and take another sip of wine.
A few seconds later, the white door opens to reveal Molly, looking flushed and harried.  Some misadventure in the kitchen, I assume, based on the splattered apron she’s wearing.
I pull him in tighter.  “Sherlock, it’s going to be amazing precisely because you care about it so much.  I can’t wait to see it.  Multiple times.  In the cinema.”  It’s a poor attempt at lightening the mood, but I can sense he needs to be pulled out of this vortex of worry and nerves.  Thankfully, Sherlock huffs out a bit of a laugh and then turns in my arms, his hands settling on my chest, where he proceeds to fiddle with the buttons of my shirt.
“Not long. I moved in just before Christmas,” he answered, bypassing the sandwiches and selecting a raspberry-topped petit four. “After Mycroft’s wedding, it seemed expedient to find my own quarters, since he would one day be king and Buckingham Palace would be his. Little did we know that day would be quite so soon.”
“No.  No, absolutely not.”
Sherlock made a face, a small wrinkle appearing at the bridge of his nose.
“Thank you,” he says, kissing me once more before taking the comic book gently from my hands and sitting back against the headboard.  My left hand drifts to my just-kissed mouth as I watch him study the first page.  He glances up, eyes soft with understanding, the he winks and turns his attention back the comic.  I realise I can’t sit there while he reads -- it’d be far too anxiety-inducing, so I grab my tea and mumble an excuse about making breakfast so I can flee to the kitchen.
On screen, Charlie continues, “Hello, Sherlock, thank you for joining us.  We wish it could be under different circumstances, but we’re pleased to chat with you nonetheless.”
After a moment, during which silence reigned and Sherlock avoided John’s eye, John finally said, “To Chelsea, then?”
He wasn’t so lucky. He could still hear Prince William following behind him.
Sherlock sat on the only free sofa, leaving space for John to join him. However, John and Lestrade remained standing, sipping their tea, looking out of place and uncomfortable in their slightly rumpled uniforms. He wanted to ask them to sit, but they would almost certainly refuse, and no permission to be seated seemed to be coming from Papa or Mummy either. Suddenly, he felt awkward himself, wanting to stand back up to alleviate the strain between the royal family and the officers.
⟪JOHN! Where are u????⟫
After making our escape, Sherlock and I step out of Greg and Molly’s house, jog down the five steps, and by some unspoken agreement turn left, setting out at a leisurely pace through the streets of Notting Hill.  While it’s cooler now that the sun has set over London, the night air is inviting, and maybe I’m imagining things, but it feels filled with a sense of anticipation.
Harry
He was proud that his hands remained steady as  he cleanly sliced open the envelope, removing the letter and unfolding it in one smooth motion. He did, however, give himself a moment to breathe, closing his eyes and gathering his courage, before looking down.
Charlie nods approvingly.  “That seems like a very positive outlook to have when details of your personal life have been spilled to the public.”
“They’re not as resplendent as in early summer when every bud is in bloom, but you get a sense of the garden. This was my favourite part of visiting this house as a child; the gardens were always mine.”
Overnight, Sherlock’s world had changed, too, and although there was a deep ache in his chest, he felt at peace.
Harry pushes her plate away.  “Glad I was nearly finished eating!  Mols, your stories are always disgusting.”
I shake my head and huff out an endeared laugh.  ⟪Have a safe flight and I’ll see you in the morning. xx⟫
“I think goodbye is traditional,” Sherlock says, he reaches out a hand as though to comfort me or shake my hand and then withdraws it quickly.  With a small nod, he adds, “Goodbye, John.”
The man’s pulse was slow and weak, which worried John. He seemed to be coming around a little bit, but with the gash on his head and all that alcohol in his bloodstream, things could take a turn for the worse rather quickly. Fishing his handkerchief out of the inside pocket of his jacket, John located the wound and applied pressure, hoping to staunch the flow of blood as much as possible while crouched on a dark, dirty bit of pavement. The man groaned again.
“That’s true, but that’s also why I came back.  I realised I didn’t want to hear about it from anyone but you.”  After a pause, I add, “If you want to tell me.”
John, the Colonel, the two members of the Military Police and all those on the dancefloor in their immediate vicinity, including Molly and Irene, turned to look at him. The Colonel looked him up and down with disgust, but one of the soldiers holding John asked, voice snide, “and who are you?”
Received 14/5/2018 23:15
“Capable?  Sherlock, of course you’re capable of it, but that doesn’t mean I want you to have to do it.”
As if on cue, another young soldier hurdled around the corner from Hyde Park and he skidded to a stop at the sight of John and Sherlock. He looked panicked, shaking slightly and breathing hard. “Is he alive?”
Peace.
“You could help,” John muttered, looking down at Sherlock as he pushed some beakers farther up the table so they were out of reach. The movement caused John’s groin to drag deliciously along Sherlock’s body.
I don’t say anything to Greg, Harry or the others, and except for one outburst full of expletives from Harry just after Sherlock left, they don’t bring him up.   I’m sure they know I’m being pathetic and pining over him, but they’re kind enough to leave me be, not even a mention of him when we next play Brownie of Despair.  (Of course, the name has stuck, which seems rather ironic now.)
Fumbling, I rummage through the drawer in the bedside table for a condom and lube, finally locating them and shifting back next to Sherlock again, nervous with anticipation.  If I’m completely honest, it’s been a damn long time since I’ve done this, long enough that I feel like an inexperienced teenager at the prospect of being the one to give Sherlock what he so desperately needs in this moment.
“If we can just keep calm, I am certain we could come to some arrangement that suits us all.”  The man said this like someone who was used to getting his way.  His accent and his clothing were clear indicators that he came from money.  The observation made John’s irritation prickle again.
“Before they descended upon you for all the trite gossip?”
The next time they surfaced, John queried the hour, murmuring gently against Sherlock’s mouth. As tempted as he was to ignore their appointed meeting time at the barracks, Sherlock fished out his pocket watch. It was just after half past one and John determined that they best “head out”, so they pulled themselves together and, with one final, brief kiss, re-emerged from the shadows out onto Sloane Street.
When neither of them move, I bark, “Now!”
“I do so hate when people get things wrong or when problems remain unsolved.”
A few minutes later, the door opened again. “Follow me, Sir,” the footman said, stepping back against the wall to create space for John to enter the room.
Instead, John turned to the front of the car and strolled around it, only to come to a stop at Sherlock’s door and held out his hand. Sherlock looked at it stupidly, taking in the short but graceful fingers and neat fingernails, before recognising the gesture as a request to shake hands. Instead of moving to grasp those fingers, Sherlock hastily removed the driving glove on his right hand and held onto it tightly in his left. Only then did he reach out for John.

“Who are you?”  The inflection implies a question, but it comes out as a command.  I’m used to giving orders as well.
I shrug.  “Well, I didn’t exactly warn you or. . . ever say ‘oh, by the way, I’m bisexual’, so I guess I’m not surprised that you’re surprised.”
While the tea steeps, I lean back against the counter and attempt to make conversation, although I’ve proven to be rubbish at that.  “Are you thinking of doing some travelling?”
“I'm at home.  Why?  What’s going on?”
He picks up a book about Afghanistan and turns it to read the blurb on the back.
“Hey, boss,” Anderson’s head pops around the office door, “I’m gonna go grab some lunch.  Want me to pick something up for you?”
Sally smirks at him.  “Well, that was last night.  Set your sights higher tonight maybe?”
“Well, you’re finally here.  Now what?” John asked, casting his eyes around.  Although he had a benign smile on his face and did not look, at first glance, out of place, Sherlock could see the tension in the way he held himself that belied the truth.  Despite the sharp lines of his uniform, Captain Watson’s shoulders were slumped, like he was drawing in on himself, attempting to blend into the crowd.
“One of the unintended perks, I suppose, of me accompanying John tonight.”  Sherlock says, sounding amused.
The weather invites people to wander through the streets of Notting Hill, like it’s the set of a romantic comedy and they’re falling in love amidst the market stalls and coffee shops.  It’s constantly busy and the bell over the door chimes more and more often as more people filter in to peruse the shelves, so I can’t begrudge them their happiness.
He huffs slightly.  “Oh, you know what I mean.  I am very aware of the fact that this is asking a lot of you, how it will open up your life to intrusive media speculation and public curiosity that being with me will inevitably bring.  I am used to it, but I would protect you from it if I could.”
John stared at the letter, shocked not only by its lack of insight into why Sherlock was suddenly writing to him but also by the very prospect of seeing the man again after so much time had passed since they last met. What the hell could this possibly be about? Why was he being contacted and why now?
“What’s your name, Private?” he asked sharply, attempting to get him to focus and calm down.
And one final thank you to my amazing betas for their continued support, encouragement and advice in shaping and finishing this story - @zigster-ao3, @eternaljohnlock and @88thparallel you are wonderful and I'm so grateful!
I’m wandering through the section of the shop dedicated to the Mediterranean, left index finger running across the spines of the books, contemplating the possibility of going to Greece or Tunisia, when I register the bell ringing in the distance.  Assuming it is Mr. New Zealand leaving with his purchases, I continue my little middle-of-the-day travel fantasy, envisioning myself with a book on a warm beach or walking through a bustling market.
I draw myself to my full height, what there is of it, and glare a him.  “No.  Just no, Sherlock.  You do not get to use people like this.   Jesus, I can’t believe you.  I want you and your brother out of here.”
John found himself with a hand over his mouth again.
That prompted an image of John dancing to flicker through Sherlock’s head. He very much doubted that John was terrible; after all, he had demonstrated excellent fitness, coordination and spatial awareness throughout their exploits thus far (limp and cane aside), so perhaps it was a lack of experience and confidence rather than a lack of skill that made John doubt himself.
Sherlock looked at John, wondering what he could have possibly forgotten.  The two men were glaring at each other, John’s eyes steely.  Slowly, John brought his heels together and raised his right arm in a salute, flicking his hand towards the Colonel and cocking his head in a show of defiance.
Papa, eminently capable of smoothing over any awkward social interactions in a way that Sherlock was not, moved the conversation on quickly. “Where did you meet my son, Captain? After his escape from the Ritz, no doubt,” he asked, a twinkle of good humour in his eye.
There’s nothing for it, I’ll just need to go home.  I rush back to the office, grab my keys to lock up and then head back to the flat.  I fire off a text to Greg as I walk, informing him that I'm bringing someone to dinner.  Seems rude to show up with a date unannounced.
John seethed.
“Wine is fine, Sherlock.  Thanks.”  He looks relieved.
“Good manners,” I say after a while, referencing our earlier conversation, and Sherlock lips quirk into a half-smile.  “You ready to go?”
“And I should ask why you are dressed for hiking in the hills around Balmoral,” Mycroft shot back, signalling for his overcoat.
“Papa!” Sherlock called as his father moved from the table.
“Look sharp!” he ordered the soldiers around him, and the ranks shifted to attention, a ripple of movement emanating away from him.
“Well, see ya.”
“In that case, we shall take our leave so you can commence your gossiping,” Sherlock says.  Considering our earlier conversation this could have been bitter, but he sounds genuinely entertained.  He rises from his seat, everyone following his lead, and so begins a loud and confused process of saying goodbye, including  too many comments laced with innuendo, nudges and winks for me to handle.  I finally escape Molly’s clingy hug and start towards the front door, ushering Sherlock in front of me.
right here.”
“Eight hours and 19 minutes,” he declares, just a touch smug.   His lips curl up into a smile as he gazes down at me.  “Hello.”
Disappearing into the office again, I text Sherlock.
“Stop trying to gain extra sympathy because it’s your birthday.  It’s not gonna work, Harry,” Greg says, toying with the springy bits of her fascinator.   She bats his hands away and then reaches across him for the wine.
While all this is going on, I perch at the other end of the sofa, now fully clothed after having thrown on some jeans and socks, listening to them strategise.  I’d offered to make myself scarce earlier by either reading in the bedroom or leaving the flat altogether, but Sherlock had just scoffed and said “Eat your breakfast, John” -- the put-on abrasiveness tempered by a soft hand on my elbow.  So that’s what I’d done.  Sherlock had on two occasions asked my opinion, mostly to prove Sally wrong about something, but otherwise I’d been rather superfluous to the ongoing negotiations.
I can hear Greg cursing faintly on the other end of the line, like he’s pulled the phone away for a moment.  “Do you think this guy’ll come back?”
“Possibly.  But only if you follow through on that kiss.”  Before I even realise what’s happening, he’s snaked out one of his long arms and closed his fingers around my wrist, tugging me down to him.
“Perhaps,” John agreed and then lapsed into silence. After a second, he added, “But for the moment, I have to focus on being an Army medic.”
January 23, 2006
We walk together down the path, Sherlock with his hands clasped behind his back, our shoulders brushing occasionally.  He breaks the silence and says, “Beautiful, isn’t it?  What a lovely thing a rose is.”
Sherlock cut him off.  “Then you did not ask properly!  You can’t have done!”
And then he’s gone.
“Keep dancing.”
Greg exhales deeply.  “Have you heard from Sherlock since you left him tonight?”
Sherlock stopped short. “You were at the Palace?”
“You are very loyal, very quickly, Mr. Watson.”
Then there was a clatter and John realised that the mess he’d been tidying earlier was still covering table.
Some distant part of his brain was trying to tell him to slow it down, but then Sherlock tipped backward onto the table so that John was sprawled across his chest, hips rutting reflexively. Oh, Christ, Sherlock felt far too good beneath him.
“Sherlock,” John whispered again.
Sherlock and the Major were still talking when the ambulance arrived, a small off-white vehicle branded with a red cross. John was quite happy to pass care of the unfortunate Private Sampson off to the rather harried medics, who, undoubtedly, had had a busy night. After a few cursory questions directed at John, they lifted the injured man into the vehicle and gestured to Meeks to get in as well.
The crowd of revellers parted like the Red Sea as their small group made its way to the exit. Embarrassed by the attention, despite knowing they were gawking at the bloody royals and not himself, John kept his head down. They quickly passed through the hall, down the corridor and out through the main door, fresh air smacking against John’s anger-red cheeks.
“Nothing!”
“So you like to help people, hm?” I ask.
“What, really? You don’t have to do that.”
There’s a knock at the door.
With the rest of the crowd, John turned and saw a man walking quickly through the hall, tailed by Major Lestrade. And this, thought John, must be “Mycroft,” or Prince bloody Henry. He arrived at Sherlock’s side and Major Lestrade came to a stop at his opposite shoulder, fishing in his pocket and offering a handkerchief to Sherlock.
“Erm, no.  Think I’m okay,” he says and then pauses, looking awkward but determined.  “Unless you need to talk about it?”
Across from him, Sherlock shifted in his seat and adjusted the leg of his perfectly-pressed trousers, recrossing his legs slowly and avoiding John’s gaze. Finally, he looked up, a faint flush colouring his cheeks, and said, “I saw you. During the funeral procession. I saw you and needed to write to you.”
Five minutes later he joins me, sitting at the far end of the sofa as if he thinks I need as much distance between us as possible.  He opens his mouth to start to explain, I assume, but I cut him off.
Your suggestions and comments helped me pull this bit of the story together after being very nervous to approach it!  <3
On my walk home, I had planned what I was going to say to him, something sweepingly romantic to explain my change of heart, but all those words escape me at the moment, and for some reason what comes to mind is a quote from the Peanuts.
A small nod.  Then Sherlock mumbles against my neck, “I wish you had been there.”
John groaned.  Oh, Jesus, Sherlock really didn't know when to keep his mouth shut.
I force myself into uttering a greeting.  “Hello, can I help you find something?”
that John had been dancing around the flat by himself like a teenage fangirl.
Received 13/5/2018 09:34
I clear my throat and try to figure out how to respond.  There are things I won’t talk about, but my journey to opening the bookshop seems like it is distant enough from the memories of the Army that I may be able to discuss it.
Behind him, Sherlock heard John’s uneven footsteps echoing down the alley, and he took a deep breath to calm his racing heart before turning to face John.
“Major Lestrade, I am perfectly fine!” Sherlock yelped, his voice higher than usual, which made John frown and cut his eyes to his friend. He looked like a spooked horse, ready to bolt at the slightest sound or movement. John nudged him aside to keep consistent pressure on the wound himself.
“On what charge?”
While I’m sure he intends this to be a positive or at least a neutral statement, it comes across like a bit of an insult.  “Erm. . . right.”
If he knew that his brother was harassing me, and yet pretended it was just some crazy fan, then I can only assume he was seeking a reason to end our relationship and his brother provided a convenient excuse.  Instead of being an adult about his change of heart, he allowed me to feel terrorised by this man and now has the audacity to turn up at my flat and expect me to help him.
