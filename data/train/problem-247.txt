Then, John leaned a bit to his right ear and paused. He opened his mouth to talk but couldn't. He sighed and lifted his head a bit.
Mrs Hudson’s steps on the stairs were slower than years ago, but they were just as firm and energetic as always. The bathroom had no windows, the only light that came in was through the frosted glass door to Sherlock’s bedroom.
Lestrade smiled and took one of Sherlock's arms firmly; giving a nod to John and making Sherlock to walk back to his bedroom, almost lifting his feet from the floor.
"Well John," Sherlock's facial expression was between a suppressed laugh, a grin and a smirk. All at once, John smiled just by looking at him, "today I met a lovely lady who was waiting for her son. I'm a gentleman you know, so I kindly offered to take his place... each passing day, sons are more and more unattached to their mothers, it's a shame!" but Sherlock's smiling face said otherwise.
? That's what they told everyone? He was always very aware that she was a woman, but there were times when he wanted to throw out all of his morals and give her a good punch. But then there was Lestrade, he could never forget what Greg told him on the Study in Pink case
One of the first times they talked, John took a hold quickly on how Sherlock's voice variations said a lot. Almost as much as actual words. Now Sherlock was talking in that purred, throaty voice, letting him know that he had something important to say, but didn't want to rush the issue. John didn't know how to explain it. But most of the time, he could figure a lot from the man in front only through his voice. If Sherlock did it on purpose or not, he never knew.
Sherlock smiled at this text, a bitter, sad, but satisfied smile somehow. His face contorted for a minute as a child who is about to cry. He swallowed then and his frown returned to his face immediately.
Sherlock let out a throaty sound when John's hands moved to his collarbone. The doctor saw how his friend's hand slid all the way from its position at the back of the sofa to the front of his trousers in a lazy movement, how he accommodated the erection forming down there. John gulped again, but didn't say a thing about it.
“Calm down, Watson!” That was Sherlock’s voice again. A pause and then, calmer, “He’s going to come up, let’s…” The rest of the sentence was lost again, and then, “Smell this, what do you think?”
be. There was so much about you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought
"John... come for me..." he said in a very low voice, "I want to see you come..." he added as he kept on stroking. John snapped his eyes open at that phrase.
Sherlock seemed a bit uneasy, John knew what was going on inside his head, and they really needed to talk about it.
With a frustrated groan, Sherlock released a bit the grip on the man, who took the cosh and gave him a blow behind his knee, making him fall hard on the cement. He was about to give Sherlock another blow, this time directed to his head, but he managed to roll around the floor just in time. Sherlock rolled over the cement a few more meters until he could stand. He fought his attacker until he could finally pin him against a wall, the attacker’s chest pressed tightly against bricks. The detective took both of arms behind the small of the man's back, making pressure with his own stomach. He patted the sides of the man until he found the wallet inside his trouser's pocket, he opened it helped with his teeth, checking its contents immediately.
There was a knock on the door and Sherlock tensed, automatically. That was part of the plan, too, but he didn’t imagine it was actually going to come to him as natural as it was.
“Tonight, if you want. The leaf is already cut so I should think… where’s the leaf?” John looked around the kitchen.
. It was the same with Donovan. Why had he beaten that man, he only knew that he needed to pull the pressure off his chest when hearing that... in that despicable tone... as if they totally forgot Sherlock was a human being too. They didn't understand Sherlock was like that just because he was repelled by the idea of people – a young woman, in this case – giving herself to someone she doesn't belong to, as if sex was something so irrelevant.
"No, I came here because I didn't hear you snoring. I thought you were awake, so maybe you could help me with the code. It's good to know you took my advice, though."
Almost immediately after, Sherlock came too and, at the sensation, his finger entered a bit and John's jaw clenched as he let out a long and low moan by both; the feeling of watching Sherlock come – and oh God he was gorgeous. His deep indecent growl, his neck thrown back, his fist grabbing the sheet, his hips jerking still shortly and erratically, his jaw clenched but his lips parted and all of the muscles of his body tensing at the unison – and the feeling of that invasive finger entering rapidly and going completely away almost immediately.
“You can call me Bill,” Sherlock said with a wink, now trying to disassociate them from the heavy atmosphere that they had somehow created. John laughed briefly and cleared his throat.
The pressure of Sherlock's head over his chest made him sit on the bed, a rush of fear passed quickly by his mind when he realized that he, out of instinct probably, had opened his legs and now Sherlock's knees were in between his tights, he looked up, panting heavily. Sherlock was in the same state of arousal he was. He pulled a bit Sherlock's shirt and the detective took it off.
"What." Sherlock turned and stopped, his face back to normal, John battled internally with himself. What could he say? Distracted? No, definitely not distracted. Alert? Sherlock was always alert.
He was drained and happy at the same time and of course a bit shocked by the coldness of the case. Happy because they were able, with Armand's help, to stop the black market; a case he couldn't post on the blog, even when he thought at first that Irene's case was far more complicated since it threatened national security. Was this case so important? Last thing he knew this afternoon was about the bust they had to do at the port thanks to the dates on the laptops’ files. But the case was now under the status of
John..." Sherlock gasped out as he came, stilling over the doctor. He moved his finger out and collapsed over him, he felt John kissing his cheek, muttering how much he loved him, how fantastic he was.
" the loud, unexpected shout coming from the detective made John step out from his thoughts, and Armand to jump on his chair with a start. Soon both of their attentions were directed to the long figure moving to the other extreme of the room. There, Sherlock took his violin, tuned a couple of strings, faced the window and started to play. Armand got closer to John and asked in a very hushed voice, "What... had... just happened?"
"Sherlock... I am perfectly capable to kick the shit out of you if I want to. I'm not a fine china you have to take care of, you know...? I'm strong. I've been in the war. I've seen..." he gulped and cleared his throat, Sherlock's grip on his arm tightened a little in a silent support, "God if only you knew... if only you
"I think either of us could tell how Sherlock feels." John exhaled, "I think we discussed this already with Irene Adler's case." The doctor's expression was a serious one now, time for playing innocent was over.
Mycroft lifted himself from the chair taking his umbrella and walked to both of the laptops on the desk. John stood up as well and crossed his arms over his chest as he watched Mycroft.
– even though John was not looking, all of the nervous energy Sherlock displayed earlier was now replaced with boredom. “The best part was Mrs Hudson listening to the commotion and coming up to offer tea and biscuits to celebrate. How
"Oh." Sherlock frowned again, "I collected your data." He said with a shrug, as if it was the most natural and normal thing to do.
Before Sherlock could get a hold of the little book, a very old man in a suit appeared. He had white beard, long white hair that rested on a pony tail over the back of his neck. It gave him a very distinguish look. He stretched John's hand in silence and Sherlock's before claiming the empty chair next the detective.
"Yes! In a restaurant. As a couple. Going to lunch. I think it would be very normal if you did. That's it!" John was whispering desperately.
John couldn't help it again, he leaned to Sherlock, who just frowned a bit and waited for John; who observed his face for a couple of seconds. He was fascinated once more with those eyes, those lips, that skin, the faint morning stubble on his chin and jaw, those manly features, reminding him of his previous thoughts.
yourself because we're both males. Oh you still don't see it, don't you? It must be so placid in there!" Sherlock waved his hand in John's direction, "The numbers, John! The third option we had was to talk to a woman or a man according to the ages, that option only had three numbers.
He braced himself for the worst; he stilled his hips and sighed loudly, his body sagging a bit on the stretcher. He didn’t dare open his eyes, not yet, lest he sees John’s regretting face. He could hear his own soft breathing and John’s steps.
It had been two days since John and Sherlock's little conversation about the latter's sexuality issues, and neither of them wanted to bring it up again.
Sherlock acknowledged this by nodding once, then he circled around in the spot he was to take in the room, checking for details. When he got closer to where John and Chloe were he couldn’t help but notice how John tensed. He took a step back. Of course, John had noticed as well - the bulge in his trousers. With the lights on it had to be clearly visible. Just because he was doing his best to ignore it didn’t mean it wasn’t there.
Elsie had started to cry and Martin put two fingers over her neck, then gave a look to Chloe over his shoulder. “If my experience is of any use, I’ll say she needs this ambulance more than Chloe does. She’s tachycardic while Chloe’s breathing looks just fine.” He moved his hand to his pocket and handed Sherlock a green disposable mask. “I know it’s a bit late, but use it anyway. I asked for another ambulance for you and Chloe. We can’t have these two together now, either.”
And after that, Sherlock had complied to everything this morning; he had allowed John to take his temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturometry. He had eaten a normal meal – finally – and then he even drank tea. John found it really odd at first but then he decided just to enjoy it and not give it extreme thought. It was not like Sherlock never do this kind of things once in a while anyway.
Sometimes he detested it. He wanted Sherlock to be his old self, leaving John the responsibility of being the well-behaved of the duo. Now that Sherlock was the one in focus, where did that leave him? Two years – almost three – of a life without Mary and he was still self-loathing. He wondered if people noticed how infuriated he was with himself at times, even if he tried to hide it. The last two years he had been generally happy, and therapy helped him a lot, but every few times there was a case, a woman, a colleague, Sherlock’s odd behaviour that
Sherlock’s eyes locked with John’s for a moment – or two – and John could clearly see that Sherlock was deliberately trying to calm his breathing. John’s eyes went to Martin, but as he was turning his head, he could see Sherlock licking his lips, swallowing and straightening his spine in the chair.
Sherlock had to fight the impulse to remain silence and run when hearing John's call. "Yes" he said as he opened the door.
He wanted those fingers to go lower, wanted John to be bolder, wanted to be bolder himself... if there wasn’t so much at stake maybe…
“Wrong: that’s a word you can say without a problem,” John said between roars of laughter. “Wonder why,” he looked at Sherlock who just shrugged and returned his gaze to his phone, but there was a small smile still playing around his lips.
Sherlock smirked, trying for humour, he took John’s wrist with his hand and purred, low and slow, “I doubt William would want to behave, considering the circumstances.”
and inside, there were lots of different shelves with ordered stuff. He tried to look in there for the connection between that room and the room
“Ha-Hamish,” Sherlock said, William’s personality coming easily to him. He cleared his throat and added, “You look good, today.”
“Seriously? You didn’t…” John turned around to look at him from head to toe. Sherlock felt like squirming a bit in place.
I can. I hope I can share what his father left for her, even though she hates  him. He really wanted the best for her although he was ignorant of his daughter’s happiness. We fought over that so many times, him being a criminal and me in the force.” He shook his head and turned to Sherlock. “You’ve become a good man, my old friend. I hope we can stay in touch, I barely have anybody to talk to. How’s Martha?”
"No, you probably didn't. Your hands are never dirty, Phillip. I admire you for that." Mycroft exhaled slowly, the smoke around his face gave him a somewhat dangerous aura, even more than normal.
"Sherlock, stop it now, would you?" He said with a firm tone, making pressure on the back of the detective's skull with his fingertips.
That particular little fantasy always made him smile. He had imagined John searching for him under every possible pebble in London.
“Mr Watson. The client for six o’clock is here,” Miss Eldridge’s voice came through the speakers of the computer and John stood up carefully. Sherlock washed his hands in the sink.
“Yes. I know. Let me…” John’s jaw moved, the same movement he always did when making a decision. Sherlock waited but turned his torso away from John. “Tonight.”
In the front of his mind, Sherlock felt the compulsive need to praise John, to tell him how amazing he was, how good he smelled, how sweet the vibration of his vocal cords felt against his eardrums. And in the back of it, he was completely aware of how intense and long this orgasm had been, if John was awake, if his bed had creaked, that it was a cold night, that his legs were trembling, if his heart would ever calm down today.
"Yoo hoo!" She called and stopped when she saw John standing awkwardly next to Sherlock who was still sitting on his chair, they moved their eyes away from each other's faces. "Sherlock, dear..." she said, her composure back to normal in seconds, John frowned, sure Mrs. Hudson knew already. It's not like the walls were soundproofs after all... at his own thoughts he took a hand to his temples, rubbing them. "There is a man with a dummy downstairs, he says-"
“My back is kinda killing me.” It was a known fact that talking about a common problem - especially if you use enough mannerisms - led to chatting. Chatting leads to distraction. “Hamish is a great therapist. I’ve been in therapy with him for months,” he added as he committed the software to memory, “All day in front of a computer does that to people, don’t you think?”
"A lot." Armand pulled his chair closer to the detective, sitting right in front, noticing the nervousness of the man. Their knees were touching, but Sherlock didn't move back.
Even though John was used to Sherlock being close, always around good fifteen centimetres between their faces, this hadn’t happened in a while. He was tempted to take a step back, but he stood his ground, his eyes inevitably going to Sherlock’s lips and back to his eyes.
When he was fully inside the flat, he sighed and walked to the skull on the mantle. It was staring at him with his immobile grin. He lifted it upside down and smiled when he found his secret cigarette, scotched at the bottom, near the forehead. He took it off and felt it in his hands. He moved it around his fingers and smelled it, taking a big gulp of air. A couple of seconds later, he was throwing it in the trash, crashed, but he didn't light it.
“I mean… we can take the chair downstairs to Mrs Hudson’s garden and open the hose, let it dry a few days outside.”
"Sir, this is the last time I'm going to say this. It is not a good idea! We've been in the track of this painting for only one week, and I'm sure..."
Yet again, John was fascinated; Sherlock usually asked him – ordered him – to get out of the room if he was going in there, but there were sometimes when his thoughts were so strong that John's presence didn't disturb him. And again, John felt
He cleared his throat again, not trusting his voice anymore. "Like this?" he asked. This time, John removed his knuckles and replaced them with his fingertips. He ghosted over that same spot and he heard Sherlock mumbling something like
He took a book from his drawer, took off his headphones and paced to a spot behind his seat. A red curtain fell and he sat in front, turning on the camera with a remote control.
"Thanks man," he said to John, "I could never do that since I'm in charge of the place, but really. Thanks."
"What's wrong?" Sarah asked concerned and amused. She had never seen John's mood switch so quickly when they were dating, she visualised him as a quiet and pacific man, utterly serious, with bit of a temper even, but also with a light sense of humour.
The detective smiled at her, a fast gesture, but he didn't say a word. Instead, he positioned himself behind Lestrade and eyed the papers in the folder over his shoulder. The girl never stopped her staring. John got closer to her.
Lestrade released his arm, making a frustrated sound in his throat. Sherlock made his way out, following John into the chilly night air. The lights were on, and there were just few people walking by. John put his hands inside his pockets and started to pace, Sherlock walked next to him on his left.
, don’t you see?” Sherlock waved the photo of the kiss and pointed at the necklace. “She had said that it was a family relic but she
John was listening to Sherlock's conversation at the phone with Lestrade, but he wasn't paying attention to it. Sherlock's words were tattooed in his brain now. At the same time he was thinking about the people's market. He had seen it in Afghanistan; women obligated to leave their families behind, after the promise of a better life quality for them and their families. John had memories for a life time with the war and all he had to witness.
John tapped pause on the phone and looked over at Sherlock, who was now staring at his half-full cup. John’s cup was mostly empty.
John let out a sigh, resigned. "And before, Sherlock..." he took Sherlock's hand in his, away from his upper arm, moving it almost to his eye's level, examining it. He ran his fingers over the palm. Sherlock didn't attempt to move it away, "...when we..."
"A dull case, yes." Sherlock moved the book in his hand to another pile of books next to him, before turning his attention completely at the tired man who still sat at the edge of the bed. "An infidelity case, John. A woman, Christine, came in today and asked for help. She is under the suspicion of her husband cheating on her."
As a doctor, he was interested in the drugs and the effects they have in the human body. It seemed like ages he last read a medical book. The familiarity of the action made him feel at peace. He felt a bit like a teenager again; when those books were still a mystery and he had to spend long, sleepless nights trying to figure them all out. He had to read them aloud, have three or four extra books on his lap, a medical dictionary always at reach. Now he didn't need that anymore, he understood every word there, and could follow the book with ease, even when it was from an area that wasn't his expertise at the medical field.
Armand walked to the door intending to leave, but Sherlock stopped him. "I still need to know the codes." He said, a frown still fixated on the screen in front. "I can't find anything on the internet; I think you might be of help. I suppose you weren't followed."
"I can stand by myself... I dun need yar help!" Sherlock tried to stand up again just to fall back over poor John. This time, he groaned loudly at the pain at his lower belly. His face was red and contorted between pain and embarrassment.
John forced the paper on his lap again, his face pure incredulity. He pointed his index finger at Sherlock, opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. “Never mind.”
"The game, Angelo! The game has just begun!" Sherlock exclaimed taking Angelo by his arms and giving this loyal man one soundly kiss on each cheek and he was off, entering a black car that was waiting for him outside.
Lestrade rubbed his temples, he had to play fool in front of Donovan. He took his phone and dialled a number. "Are you sure?" he asked to Sherlock as he waited to be attended. Sherlock just smirked with a light lift of his shoulders; a clear expression of
, then John's voice talking to Lestrade, asking about Armand. Suddenly Armand's voice resonated inside his mind palace, it was dark, John sleeping beneath him, a soft caress on his scalp.
“Oh my God…” She huffed a laugh. “In the mornings. She usually has a horrible temper when she wakes up, but now she’s... let’s say her mood has improved which in turn improves mine if you catch my drift.”
"Now I'm serious Sherlock..." he said, Sherlock didn't have to look at him to know he was smiling, "I
"Do you think he has something to do with the brick this morning? Maybe it wasn't an accident after all..." he said pensive.
"Sherlock..." John got up from his usual armchair and took the laptop to Sherlock's lap. There was a site with the prices for the supplies for cancer treatment, a big list of plants based chemicals. He sat down next to Sherlock and he moved himself closer to the screen.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes briefly and just turned, he was about to hail a cab when a raspy voice called from the Yard's entry.
“Even with a little of it, I’m sure his wife is going to be very happy,” John smirked, his eyes settling back on his book.
And his stimulated mind could perfectly invoke a much-wanted mouth, right there on his neck, panting. If so, John’s nose would be pressed against his jaw, and his own nose would be pressed against a cheek. He could easily make his way to John’s nose with his own.
"So, you can't imagine me, John, with anyone? You think I'm incapable of any kind of sexual activity?"
John’s internal voice urged him to leave Sherlock alone, to go and wait for him with the Constable guarding the front door. He even knew the bloke - Miller was his middle name - they could even spend the time chatting. But he walked a few steps closer instead, approaching the bathroom. The adrenaline felt like an invitation, like all those years ago.
"Who do you think you're talking to, Mr. Groundsel? Of course everything is confidential. You know me well enough."
John took his hand from Sherlock's firm grip and eyed around. Sherlock looked down at him still with a very serious expression. It took only a couple of seconds for them to burst into laughter.
"Hm?" John returned his attention to his right, looking at Sherlock who never unlocked his gaze from the device in front of him, he actually never heard the phrase. "That... is not your phone." He added getting closer to the detective, trying to read the contents of it as well.
"Nature... has so many ways to tell us humans to stay away from the things that are not within our reach."
Sherlock smiled to himself. He had sent the smiley to cheer John up a bit. He knew his friend would be down. It was good to know how the simple gesture had its desired effects. He had spent several seconds staring at the smiley before convincing himself to press the SEND button.
Sherlock snorted and stopped in front of John. “Relax. You still have some years before she learns how to use a gun,” he wore that lopsided grin he often had after a joke and John, smiling, couldn’t look away if he wanted.
Mycroft frowned, his mind trying to connect the dots quickly, as he saw the man hanging up, he felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. Making an apologetic gesture with his face, he picked his phone.
"John..." Sherlock changed his position on the bed, imitating John's, placing both knees in the mattress. "Remove this." He purred, pulling at John's cardigan. John took it off with a sigh and tossed to a side of the bed. "Your shirt, too."
He continued his thinking, when he felt how John's fingers started to move in little circles over his inner ankle bone, his little finger was brushing the base of his toe and ran all the way to that bone. After a couple of seconds, John's fingers ghosted by the rest of his feet and started to tap lightly. Then he nailed a bit. After some more minutes, he toyed with the fabric of the border of his trouser and nailed it too. Then he went back to the tapping. It was almost a nervous gesture John had, but he seemed so concentrated on the book that Sherlock knew for sure he wasn't aware of his actions.
"No problem." John and Lestrade opened wide eyes and they eyed each other. Were they hearing right? No objections? What was the whole talking for, then? "If that's all, Lestrade, either please go away or give me a new case."
"I'm really flattered by your hospitality... I don't know what to say..." Armand said as John finished checking the injury, "but I don't want to impose... you've been very kind, Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes..."
Lestrade made a gesture to the other two, there was a room with a crack at the door right next to the last step of the stair. From there, they saw a blonde woman with headphones, facing the wall, which let them only see her back. Next to her there was a big man, who was playing with a gun in his hands, facing her.
He turned to go back into the kitchen to get some water and aspirins - but a single word made him stop.
There was a moment where their eyes met for what seemed hours. This time it was Sherlock looking down at John’s lips and back to his eyes. John cleared his throat and turning around, asked, “Did you... uh... recognise the text?”
He closed his eyes and entered his mind palace. He lay down on the mattress and evoked last night's sensations. They were all there; his mind had placed them all in a very organized way inside his palace. He realized there was a whole new room called
But no matter the version of John he imagined; Sherlock was still aroused in all of the scenarios. Better to test the waters, then. He sent a text:
John entered the room and a quick deduction told Sherlock that John had definitely been on his surgery office, sitting in front of the computer going by his trousers at the back of the knees and his red eyes (he needed glasses) and had taken the tube, going by his shoes and jacket.
Again, a loud click. He saw, without lifting his eyes, how Sherlock pressed F5, rolled his eyes in a humorous way and typed again.
"I love you." John's statement was followed by Sherlock's expression; it was dead serious, a bit confused, even. He kissed John again, the doctor's hands roamed around Sherlock's back, buttocks, neck, everything he could reach. Sherlock positioned himself between John's legs, John opened them, welcoming the detective between them.
sociopath."He corrected, his voice not sounding convincing at all; he mentally cursed. John didn't show any sign of being perturbed.
Abby had keys to the house. John made an incredulous noise when the cameras in the kitchen showed Abby taking a glass from a cupboard. She poured something from a crystal bottle and waited patiently sitting on a chair at the dining room, one leg over the other and occasionally watching the way to the stairs as she sipped away. All this just a few rooms from where they were watching the whole scene.
They were very close now, his noses centimetres from brushing, so he didn't need to talk that loud. "I needed to think, I needed time to myself." John added.
There was a silence over the phone. Sherlock frowned and turned his face to John, who replied with a shrug.
"Hello there!" the voice was friendly; it made Sherlock's frown disappear almost instantly. The voice wasn't deep but wasn't high either. It reminded Sherlock of those infomercials with a friendly man with a friendly, smiling voice, telling you to buy a product, not those deep voices, but definitely masculine. "What can I do for you?" he asked.
Mycroft's words flowed into his mind, like sticky honey, and suddenly, he understood the first warning that was the stab in Sherlock's arm. According to Mycroft and calculating a bit, it was the time he had been a bit absent from their lives for almost a month before The Netherlands' case. It was the time, John concluded, in which Moriarty had been interrogated by Mycroft and he had sent the gang to warn him, to warn
“Hm? Who?” Sherlock turned to look at John, and gave him a quick once-over, something that lately he found he did way too much. John didn’t seem to mind or notice, but to Sherlock, it was obvious yet irresistible. Each time he turned and really found John entering the flat – one of his favourites sights – he couldn’t help the smile, his eyes dancing from John’s shoes, knees, strong thighs, torso, neck, lips, nose, eyes, and the lovely –
Soon Sherlock was entering the room again, tossing him a wet cloth, he was perfect again and John shook his head,
"It is a big thing... I mean the drugs dealing, Sherlock... it might not be the last time we hear of it..."
And, as if by command, John came hard, Sherlock's middle finger stroked the entrance as John's quivered beneath him. His orgasm hitting him hard, he rocked his hips against Sherlock and the movement of his lower half made the sensation all the more enticing. Sherlock was still rock hard and his hips moved rapidly as well as his finger, John found himself pressing his hips up against Sherlock's; his back arched and his grip on the detective's skin was almost impossible to abide. He was pretty sure he would leave marks afterwards.
John's breath got trapped in his lungs as Sherlock parted a bit more his lips above his own, closing them again, repeating the process until he darted his tongue out, barely touching John's lips. John answered the kiss properly, slowly, languidly, moving his tongue to touch Sherlock's tongue, Sherlock's lips, tilting his head to deepen the kiss.
John's lips curved up and went down back just as quickly. He gulped the beer he ordered before Sherlock arrived.
"O-Okay…" the childish voice was timid, it was frightening, disturbing. Sherlock put the phone back inside his pocket, connection still on, but he clearly didn't want to hear it; John didn't miss this detail, or the gesture of disgust on Sherlock's face. They kept on looking for the source of the voice, examining every spot their eyes could reach from their strategic location at the stairs.
“Is that so,” Sherlock’s fingers brushed John’s nape by accident when John’s hands moved to Sherlock’s collarbones over his shirt.
At the thought of The Woman, there was a knot in his stomach; he couldn't quite place the feeling. He posted the entry and kept on thinking about all of the times he’d seen Sherlock behaving like a human being. Surprisingly, there were a lot. John had seen Sherlock doubt, he had seen him hurt, nervous, gentle, loving, caring… and he had even seen him… aroused.
"You go first, Sherlock. Why did Lestrade need you in the Yard? You said something about a black market's…?"
Sherlock snorted, his shoulders moving with the sudden effort. “I have an eight gigabyte SD in my wallet.”
And today, he had followed John to his grave. John had gone with Mrs. Hudson and there was the moment, the moment in which he had heard John say things to his grave, things about believing in him. The last words from John's lips were strong, a strong belief between the two of them and Sherlock felt his strengths restored.
"You can take the sofa for tonight and leave tomorrow morning. Or my bed if you will, I barely use it anyway."
The pillow on his face turned into a toned and salty shoulder. His hand clenching the abused fabric would have been right between two shoulder blades. If it went down it would have touched the small of a back shorter than his and – who was he trying to fool, anyway – he would be touching John’s buttock, now, pressing on it so his groin would be right next to Sherlock’s.
"How did you get the answer? Did you call?" John questioned, taking the card and looking at it, but there was nothing on it that could make him understand what Sherlock was talking about.
After a long pause, Sherlock whispered "Alright". He lowered his sight to the floor, knowing John was right. He didn't trust his body now, even when he felt his mind slowly going back to normal.
Sherlock watched John's profile intently. He could hear the whispers and groans coming from his companion "Oh Sherlock... Sherlock...!" John came with a growl, it was muffled by Sherlock's skin, in the juncture between neck and jaw, rocking his hips onto his hand.
. He would have never imagined Sherlock would appear in the pub, being there just to listen, for once. Sherlock was unpredictable, and that's what he both; loved and hated about him.
"You can deduce, John. Go ahead and try. You know what I do; you've learned quite a bit." Sherlock didn't move, the corner of his lip just curved up a little, defiant eyes staring intently.
Sherlock pressed two. If he was talking to someone, he thought that the voice of a more mature woman could sound better.
But he never anticipated the need he was going to feel as soon as he was close to the other man. It seemed that after having had a taste of John’s skin and smell, he was never going to have enough. He distracted himself by grabbing plates and cups to put them in the cabinets, moving the photos on the table to the side, some of himself on awful green and red on display. He felt his cheeks turn pink. The leaf of aloe vera was something he didn’t even want to look at.
John noticed Sherlock sighing deeply and giving Rosie a small smile. He said something that sounded important – everything Sherlock said sounded important – but he didn’t hear it. There was that irrational anger again, this time pointed at Sherlock. If Rosie ever called Sherlock
When Phillip finally hung up the phone he snorted and hissed at the ashes of the forgotten cigarette between his fingers.
"I was like this, correct?" Sherlock motioned to his body with his hands and John tried to suppress the heat running over his cheeks.
"I'm not sleepy, John." Sherlock said, his voice was almost teary and broken. John sighed deeply and Lestrade passed a hand over his face, confused.
to talk about embarrassment, Sherlock..." he handed the cup of tea, Sherlock took it, his smile in perfect place.
!" Sherlock threw the door of his room open, abruptly pulling John out of his thoughts. The detective was walking barefoot only in a shirt and trousers. John had helped him out of the excessive items of clothes earlier.
There was a very visible – according to Sherlock – jump inside the towel at those words and touch. The texture of it felt soft against his testicles and in contrast felt rough against the tip of his sensitised penis. Even the seam of it felt incredibly sensual as it skimmed the skin over the bones on his hips.
The twitch of his penis did move the precariously placed towel, this time. The head was left exposed to the room.
"What? Wait…" John stopped and looked at his friend. "Why? How can you tell?" Sherlock lowered his gaze to some spot behind John's head and made a noise with his tongue.
Sherlock was on the chair in front, a concentrated expression on his face, his index and middle fingers massaging his temples, his bare feet tapping the rug below. Armand was in the kitchen, browsing the phone Sherlock had returned.
“All right,” John blinked several times as he watched Sherlock, who was now staring at the photo of the kiss.
John predicted what was expected for tomorrow: Sarah and he would apologize to each other; they would say it was only the heat of the moment and everything would be fine again. He knew that.
"You see, the black market's head you tracked down wasn't the main leader there..." Lestrade handed a few papers to Sherlock; photographs of the 'new homeless gang' "...see that man in the bigger one, he is one of the guys working for the government."
Sherlock sat on the edge of the tub again and John took the notepad he usually had in his pocket and started to scribble what Elsie was doing and the time as he usually did when stalking a suspect. He knew the notes would help later.
"Really? Awesome!" the face of the handsome man lit up again. You could easily say John had injected adrenaline right into his veins with that phrase. He lifted himself from his chair almost with a jump and took a couple of papers from his jacket. He handed it to the doctor. "This is my phone and my address. My complete name is in there. There are also the addresses of every facility the company owns; Xavier gave them to me. Do you think you are going to need anything else from me?"
"I don't think so..." the young man said scratching his head, "I ran a lot, really, and hailed at least four cabs to distract them. Then I walked in every possible direction until I got here." Armand searched in his jacket's pocket and he passed Sherlock a card, the detective motioned to a chair near the window making him sit, John sat in his usual chair. Sherlock placed the laptop aside and joined in the conversation about to begin.
He had to. It was easier this time because only his face and part of his torso would be visible on the photos. He could ask John to turn around. He had headphones in his pocket just in c–
With a last sigh and a headshake, trying not to think, he stood up and walked to the bathroom. The shower was running and he placed his hand over the door handle. Why was this so difficult now? He was used to enter the bathroom sometimes to release his bladder when John was in the shower and John did the same. And now, his bladder was hurting and the semi erection wasn't helping, and some sort of force was holding him out of the bathroom.
“Don’t touch her!” Elsie screamed between heavy breaths and mucus, her voice high-pitched and desperate in the middle of the quiet room and then told Martin: “I’m not leaving her alone! Not with two men in the house! Not in the state
With Sherlock shirtless, John had to concentrate all of his will power so not to kiss the creamy, soft-looking flesh of Sherlock's shoulders and neck. Sherlock lowered his chin, allowing John the easy access to the back of his neck. So John complied, massaging there carefully, drawing little and long patterns over the flesh. John's fingers touched lightly the base of Sherlock's scalp and a sudden need to run his fingers through that soft-looking hair possessed him. A bit unsure, with gentle pressure, he entangled his fingers in the curls and gave the scalp a soft but firm grip.
Sherlock opened the exit door and waited for John to go through, he was waving an awkward goodbye to Lestrade and Amanda, who was silently trying to fight her tears.
The soft groan that escaped his mouth sounded loudly in the silent hallway as he pressed his hand to his left pectoral, his nipple there sending electric waves to his penis. Sherlock bit down on his bicep, hard enough to evoke a massage done there, testing if that part of him felt as erotic as it did yesterday. It did.
"Whatever you want to do to me is fine, John." Sherlock felt something in his stomach as soon as the name escaped his lips.
"He's talking to my brother." Sherlock said as soon as they got out from the car Lestrade had sent to pick them up in the morning. John just eyed him, still surprised on how the DI followed every little desire of the consulting detective, to the extent to send Sally driving his own car and not the police's.
Sherlock faced John and focused in the deep blue eyes of the doctor. He scanned John’s face, but found nothing there that might be of help. John was genuinely worried about him.
"I'm right behind you, Sherlock..." the man began, Sherlock closed his eyes. His mind was trying to replace the bloke's voice with John's, but he couldn't. He tried to feel something, but couldn't. Yet it was an experiment, and he needed data to compare. "I am going to touch your shoulders now, over the sheet. I'm going to massage you a little."
But it was also likely that the reason for his cheerful mood was a call from Lestrade; he had a new case for them... even if Sherlock considered it a five. John couldn't believe how easily he was pulled into Sherlock's game sometimes.
"You did it on purpose, Mr. Detective inspector." Sherlock said slowly and quietly, stopping at the exit of the alley and turning to look at both men behind him. "You knew it was difficult to get here. You know I don't like riding police cars, but you also knew you were going to rent a car to get here, you just
And if he was right, if the chess game was planned as he and Sherlock had talked about several days ago, an evening when sharing a coffee and a cigarette in this very same very room, talking about childhood and work, about plans, government and cases, John had to know.
Now there was a shiver down his spine, his eyes moved frantically under his closed eyelids. "And you, Sherlock, are going to remember this night, the night when you slept together. You're going to remember how he touched you, how he smelled... you're going to remember how his neck tasted, how that filthy finger of yours touched him where no other man had touched him before..." now he felt a tongue all the way from his shoulder to his ear, a bite on his earlobe "you're going to remember his voice, the way he talked to you, and you, my dear, are going to get aroused, but you are going to
"You actually noticed how hard I was that time, didn't you, John." Sherlock kept on talking with the purred tone, sent shivers up to John's spine, "...just feeling your body pressed against mine... I also observed how agitated you were; I took your pulse when you touched my face."
“Stop.” John fisted the fabric of Sherlock’s open shirt. He closed his eyes when he noticed he was as attracted to that chest as he was a few minutes ago.
He was securing the towel around his hips – no pants, he was too decided by now – when he heard the first click. The place it was coming from was different from last time, it was on the ceiling, above the head of the stretcher, pointing down. Odd. It wasn’t there before.
Sherlock stretched on the couch and regretted it immediately; the blanket slid to the floor and he could feel the chilly air all over his torso. It felt as if he’d been thrown a bucket with cold water; his shirt was wet - not dripping wet - but still, the contact with the cool air, without the blanket on, gave him chills up his spine. He tilted his neck slowly, the movement made him aware of the bad position he had been sleeping in. Still half asleep, he heard a vibrating noise over the coffee table. His eyes got bigger when he saw it was a text from Lestrade.
The detective lifted his head slowly to look at him. There was a side smile on his lips, he stared into John's eyes again. "Yes." Sherlock said, his voice throaty and almost whispered "You put up with me just fine."
Sherlock lifted his stare from the cup and cleared his throat. "Look, John uh... if it's about the other day, I can completely understand if-"
"Were you aroused?" John smiled at the tone in which it was asked; as if Sherlock was asking about something as trivial as the weather.
Just then John realised the enormity of the implication of what he had just said and the way Sherlock could have read into it. Just when he was about to try and clarify, the corners of Sherlock’s mouth went down and he nodded once.
"But we are still talking, aren't we?" The comment and the tenderness of his voice made John look up and stare into Sherlock's clear eyes. The white glow from the window at his right gave him a phantasmal aura; his eyes were too shiny and... he really had to stop staring.
John shut his eyes closed again and bit his lower lip, he frowned. He didn't know how to take the news. Just the image of Sherlock's mouth circling his cock was enough to wake up his libido again, he tried to avoid the thought. "What else?"
"Last numbers: o, one. One is for the 'a' in Armand's name, nineteen is for 's' in Smith; the nineteenth letter in the alphabet... and the last...o, one..." Sherlock put the card between the table and his own large hand with a loud thud, "...still trying to figure it out."
"If we were to repeat the experience," Sherlock said in a whispered tone, intimate tone, "I'm afraid you would be the one enjoying it the most."
John was sporting a huge grin on his face; listening to Sherlock and Rosie’s exchanges wasn’t at all new, but it still shocked him somehow. Even when Rosie was very small and Mary was alive, Sherlock would take care of her with an efficiency that left even Mrs Hudson as a novice.
His mind palace started to fill up with new data about this, especially when John told him exactly what he needed to hear.
“And why…!” There was Sherlock’s low rumble, barely audible. The rest of the sentence got lost in the distance.
"I would never ask you that. I want you by my side, I'd be lost without my..." he sighed, "I'd be lost without you, John."
There was noise downstairs; Mrs Hudson’s greetings and a soft voice asking for Mr Holmes. A few moments later Chloe Hilton sat in their client’s chair.
Sherlock rolled his eyes a bit, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "I wanted to learn the reactions in the body to certain stimuli when I was younger, so I tried reading." He shrugged, "Reading stimulates the mind by default, so I thought it would stimulate my body as well. It was only dull data anyway, but I only saved a little amount that might come in handy with cases containing any perform of rape."
be mad at the situation, but the expression on the man's face didn't let her. He was expressionless. There was no judgment in there, as she feared, but only knowledge of the circumstances, nothing else. Christine's hand searched blindly for the arm of the chair next to her. She needed to sit down, her knees were failing her. Sherlock reached for her arm and pulled the chair closer to her.
"Alright..." Sherlock still had a little smile on his face, "I promise not to be so loud this time." They laughed again.
"It's nature, John. Easier way to explain it." Sherlock smiled and sipped his tea as well. John glared at him playfully and smiled. Sherlock instinctively got closer to his companion and moved a little, making himself comfortable.
“Good. Do you have the slides?” Sherlock asked. He looked in the mirror once again only to discover he was still blushing. He frowned at his own reflection.
She got closer to him and trapped his hand between hers and the table. She wasn’t strong but her grip was determined, he didn’t dare to draw his hand away. You never knew with her.
So Sherlock rocked her softly, talking in hushed tones, making up a story that he could barely remember, something about a prince and a homeless man that looked exactly the same. Well, in his version, the prince was an idiot called Mike and the homeless was an abandoned genius called Billy. He laughed with Rosie when she repeated ‘
Sherlock opened his eyes for a bit when he felt the movement over the couch and observed his friend. Unconsciously, he made a little tiny grin and his face softened. It was normal for him already to soften his face's muscles when it comes to the doctor in front; he had noticed this, of course. He remembered the first case they had together; John made his features soften that time. Sherlock used to look at people with his brows down, but he found himself smiling when looking at John. Maybe that was the reason behind the constant teasing from people around them. His brother teased him about John and even the homeless did now. Angelo was the first to do so, probably because he saw his relaxed expression that day.
impulse. But there was something about being William Scott, Hamish’s client, that for some reason, Sherlock wasn’t about to give up now.
John knew that, if he wanted to leave this behind them, he had to do everything just like last night, even the whispering in Sherlock's ear. If he was asking to this level of detail he had to be very cautious. Any little thing out of place would have Sherlock doubting the authenticity of the nightmare tale. Then he would ask and ask until he had a satisfactory answer... then maybe John would have to explain something going along the lines of '
Indeed, Armand was a mess; his clothes were drenched, his hair was plastered to his face, his right cheek had a bleeding cut the rain had taken care to clean, but the trail of blood was still visible and lost inside his shirt.
family... in the justice I mean; my grandfather, my father... and I didn't follow. That's the only thing I always try to hide but... but you saw it right through me..."
"Mycroft..." John frowned, again, not completely following the man in front. "What is that Philip can't know?"
"Yes, Lestrade, I need to know only the location of the vehicle I described, but please, don't send incompetents; all I need is to know where it is, then leave the rest to us."
Sherlock smiled, blinking slowly. He looked down at himself and then back to John's eyes with a deeper frown now, "After all we uh... did. Is this normal?"
John had to turn to the opposite way to avoid a laugh. Donovan's eyes were huge, she looked over at Lestrade who remained silent.
John couldn't say anything else. He was feeling how, just like the sun was fading in the horizon, so were the walls separating the little sanity he had left around Sherlock. His own messed up feelings and self control.
He cursed his own body that wasn't letting him have a good night's sleep. He stroked himself for a few seconds and stopped. He felt like an arse, almost as if he were defiling Sherlock's friendship. He almost felt as if he were imposing on the other man. Again, two voices were nagging inside his head; one telling him Sherlock was his friend and he shouldn't do this; it's not right to wank whilst thinking about your male best friend. The other telling him, to hell with it, who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes, but his body had needs and he might as well satisfy them.
Mrs. Hudson's steps up the stairs were like a knife cutting the silence and the kiss, despite being slow and silent. Sherlock withdrew his hands quickly from John and John did the same.
John took the phone and walked to the kitchen with the paper in his hand. Sherlock heard how John gave him the instructions and he also asked about Armand and Xavier for some reason. The detective tried to move himself from the sofa but he felt weak. It was as if all of his strength had decided to go away. He eyed around the flat and saw the stack of psychology books he had left next to his armchair. He recognized his body reactions as the drugs were slowly fading from his system. Uncontrollable shudders ran up his spine and he found himself shivering.
than that. He remembered the times he had seen him fight. He wasn't strong and rude but his style was closer to martial arts. He recalled the punch he had given him when they were about to go to Irene Adler's. It was quite the punch. He smiled at the thought of the little wrestle they pulled. He remembered then again Irene Adler's words
Sherlock noticed that John didn’t want to laugh but he couldn’t help it. Sherlock stood carefully with a groan. He stretched his hand to help John up. John took it, hard, and it slipped away with the oil. He fell flat on his arse. Again. A new fit of laughter enveloped them.
He smiled again. He was actually surprised how those two times with Sherlock had no comparison with any other partner he'd ever had in bed. And he laughed a bit thinking how they ended
"Pieces of the chess started to move, the king has to fall... we are all part of the game, Sherlock." And Sherlock started the game. He knew what Mycroft meant. He was the king since Moriarty, the other king, wanted him destroyed. The only way to achieve that is to fall into his doom. Mycroft knew about it, he made the same logical assumption.
Sherlock's lips were on his neck, licking and nibbling there, his hand was still stroking slowly, at his own rhythm.
Silence. Sherlock was right. He had forgotten that you have to keep your mind working at two hundred percent to deceive Sherlock.
Walking out of the hospital, he found a pretty woman at the waiting room, apparently waiting for him. A phone in her hands and she seemed to be texting something all the time. John recognized Anthea, even though he hadn't seen her in a while. She took him to Mycroft's.
It's unbelievable how small details says so much about someone's personality. I actually like Lestrade a lot. In the book too, he's a gentleman, but his backgrounds, knowledge and education are limited. But he has this... thing... He always wants to be the best in everything, but he also recognizes Sherlock Holmes as a superior. I kind of like that. He has a good sense of humour too, which is also reflected in BBC version. And the actor, Mr. Graves, is perfect. "Meretricious" "And a happy new year!" (Oh, how I laughed with that.)
Sherlock wasn’t one to masturbate regularly. He often did quickly and efficiently but there were times when he really, really wanted to. This was
not believe me. I suspected it at first, by observing how she talks about her daughter. Even though, these books are very clear. There are some parents blinded by the love they profess to their children. They won't believe anything out of place their child do, so in order to her to acknowledge it's her daughter, the girl has to tell her herself or... the mother has to see the proof with her own eyes. And! If she fits this profile..." Sherlock lifted a book with an open page and handed it to John, "...even that way, she still wouldn't believe me."
John kept his gaze locked on Sherlock's eyes for a moment, but the detective broke the stare to look down at the violin in his hands. Silence was good with Sherlock. Those peaceful moments they had after a case were not the kind of awkward silence, but a nice, comfortable silence. John knew this time it was different though. Several times he had caught Sherlock re-reading Irene's phone, and seen Sherlock with a lost look in his eyes more than once, and the weirdest of it all: looking at him, as if searching for something.
"Sleeping... sleeping is tedious, John." Sherlock took the phone from his pocket and started to browse over police station's sites, probably searching for a new case.
“Okay, then,” John turned in the middle of his way back to Abby’s office when the woman passed him and put a hand on his forearm, stopping him. Craig was still inside with Sherlock.
, he corrected himself – since the man wasn't a touchy person at all. Even though, after some recent events, John could tell how Sherlock actually liked to be touched a little, even if he would never acknowledge it openly. He liked to be admired, to receive affect; he liked to be... stimulated, in body and mind, as he had stated himself. It was just he had never felt very comfortable with it.
John was entranced. He was trapped once more by Sherlock's observing process. He felt naked and exposed – literally – with the intense stare. But he was far more curious about Sherlock's behaviour.
He remembered, on one conversation he and Mycroft held, how the older Holmes seemed convinced to ask for John's advice when dealing with anything that had to do with Sherlock's sentiments.
" he lowered a little his voice for it was getting louder with every word "... that bitch calls you that, too. I've been willing to...
"Sir, your bags this way, please." John got a bit startled when he heard the voice of a young girl taking his bag; he put the phone aside and passed through a metal detector. His gun didn't sound. 'Mycroft' he thought immediately. He checked the phone as he slowly walked to the stairs.
John's face contorted with several different emotions; he turned to look at Sherlock again and frowned, then he furrowed his lips to a side and closed his eyes lifting his brows. Finally, a quick smile crossed his lips. "I think you know what's bothering me."
"I came to ask you to uh... retrieve... from this investigation." Lestrade scratched the back of his head waiting nervously for the answer. Sherlock glared at him humorously. Then his expression changed to a rehearsed smile very fast.
After a couple of seconds, John felt a known heaviness on his lap and he allowed his hands to rest over the new welcomed weight over his thighs. This time, he found curls around his fingers and he noticed Sherlock had switched his position. John was taken aback by his companion's unusual action, but he was almost sleeping now, so he just restrained himself to stroke the soft hair with his right hand, and rested the left one someplace over Sherlock's chest. Last thing he heard was a soft groan, a whisper forming his name and then chilly fingers over his left hand.
The first time he'd imagined that, his captors poured ice-cold water over his head. He'd never truly believed in God, but in that state of mind, he'd believed it to be a sign; a voice in the shape of cold water telling him to stop thinking stupidly, that it couldn’t be possible. The second time his mind palace showed him that reality, he'd seen himself in his coat like a shadow, getting closer to a lovely little house, a big garden, John in the middle of it smiling to a small blonde child and hugging a faceless woman from behind, laughter and laughter until it turned into the laughter of his current captors.
She checked her shirt once again. She was happy she had chosen this attire today; a white shirt exposing a generous amount of skin below her neck and shoulders, her hair was down and she knew, if the looks from the few people outside and the men inside the cafeteria were anything to go on, she must look pretty good.
Surely Sherlock's marks on his collarbone would itch in the shower as well. He surprised himself as he smirked in front of the mirror; he never knew his face was capable of such a lascivious expression.
"Oh, and may I know, what is a seven to you?" John crossed his arms over his chest, giving him a side glance look.
His mind replayed John walking downstairs with Mycroft and Rosie to the car last night and how John had the time to go to Mrs Hudson’s to ask for the sandwiches tray and the aloe. After all what had happened between then and now, was there the possibility that John had changed his mind? Would he feel uncomfortable to give him a massage?
Lestrade laughed again. He was having way too much fun with these guys. Last time it happened, Sherlock was blabbing nonstop about the car that backfired,
He knew that if he wanted, he should be able to control his body; all he needed was a minimum amount of concentration. Soon he realized he didn't want to. He welcomed the sensations, he wanted to feel more... like that night, when he allowed his body to do and react the way it wanted, according to the natural drugs it was releasing.
. I talked to you... oh my God, I can't believe it..." Sherlock's frown got deeper if possible. The young man continued, "I could recognise that voice anywhere! Man..." he got closer and lowered his voice "I've been dreaming about that voice and that face for weeks...!"
The DI explained to both of them about a couple vehicles they had found; they had no documents and the plate number was gone. The methods they had to find the owners were ineffective, erasing every trace of what was done in the vehicle or whom it had belonged to.
A sleeping Sherlock was something rare to observe, and soon John found himself staring at him as well. It lasted just a couple of seconds though. He cleared his throat to get Armand's attention.
Sherlock frowned. "How can you possibly know, or imagine, for that matter, that I am a handsome man?" Sherlock asked, experiment already going.
"I know... it itches." Sherlock's voice held a little amusement, his lips curved in a gently smile, oblivious on purpose to John's change of topic.
"You can count on that!" with a smirk and a gesture from Louis, the gang disappeared as fast as they've appeared.
’. He turned to Martin and the old man and said in a low voice, “Don’t let Miss Eldridge call Abby Slaney, she doesn’t know we’re after her.”
something the great Sherlock Holmes can't actually do correctly..." John sat himself in front of Sherlock, on the coffee table, their knees close. He continued in a very teasing tone, "...and it's to put on a band aid, no less." John had a devilish smirk, Sherlock's expression was very close to a pout.
"Delete it; he wants to know if we took the case..." Sherlock was typing on his laptop as he spoke "he only does that to spite me, he could've simply asked Lestrade."
When he had gotten closer to John, every time they shared the same space, he felt something in his mind palace. Mentally, he imagined the walls getting thicker around them. Sharing moments with the man in front of him seemed far from pointless. He enjoyed when John did something out of character, or how he could be worried about trivialities but at the same time, be focused on the deeper things around him. Of course, if John learned how to stop thinking about trivial things all the time, he could be a genius, even. But again, he wouldn't be here. He would have gotten himself killed after one day only in Afghanistan, and he would have never met him.
?” Sherlock asked all serious again and John let out a silent giggle, it wasn’t loud but he put his hand over his mouth anyway. Sherlock smiled. “Don’t worry, John.” He showed John his phone with a constant red dot over the camera in the hallway. “They’re being louder than 60 decibels.”
“Your software. I’m a programmer,” he lied with a casual smile, adjusting his glasses (how were people able to wear them without feeling their weight during the day, was certainly a mystery left for later).
“Craig sent me a text last night with the names of the cameras. Each camera was named so if you rotate it 90 degrees…”
John stayed quiet for longs minutes, just staring into Sherlock's eyes, returning Sherlock's hard gaze.
He moved his hand carefully from Sherlock's chin and the other man tossed a bit in his sleep, John felt a tug at his shirt below his jumper when Sherlock grabbed the fabric there, his hand moving over his waist and hipbone, his fingertips resting there lazily. It was such a simple and naive movement, but John felt all of his alarms sounding inside his head. He needed to get out of there, but he didn't want to wake Sherlock up. He threw his head back on the armrest and exhaled, his furrowed lips forming a never-ending "u". He stayed there, looking at the ceiling for who knows how long, his mind battling internally between the feeling in the lower part of his stomach, his heart about to break his ribcage and his mixed feelings with all the variants. Unconsciously, John lifted a bit his hands so they weren't touching Sherlock anywhere, and his fists began to clench and unclench in a rapid movement.
When using nicotine patches, he felt his mind stimulated; the stimulus helped him to think faster and to make ideas materialise on their own, then he could contemplate them in awe, almost like it wasn't even his own mind. He felt the mindquake – equivalent to earthquake inside his mind – in the mind palace and he could see how the disaster left the answers there, in plain view. Now, with these other drugs, his mind felt the mindquake too, but this time he found the effect reflected all over his body. He didn't know if it started in his body and then it expanded to his mind or vice versa;
“Had. Exactly,” Sherlock smirked and got up from his chair, his camel dressing gown making a flourish as he gestured in the air. “She took the necklace off two months ago. She informed Miss Hilton that she had lost it, but that’s the
his voice cracking up a little. He passed his legs over Sherlock's thighs and he supported his back on the armrest of the couch. He moved Sherlock's head and carefully positioned it over his chest. Sherlock shivered a bit more, his throat making a very strange and desperate sound.
“Sherlock, let me…” John felt those legs opening again, completely understanding what he wanted. John’s mind bizarrely conjured an image of Mary; all of those times when he wanted something in bed and he had to explain because she couldn’t read his mind as Sherlock could.
With a hint of humour, John placed his index finger on Sherlock's shoulder and pushed him back, and then he whistled as he fell, lifeless-like, over the mattress. The doctor threw a blanket over him and gave him a friendly pat on the back. Lestrade also turned to leave.
“Well,” he said, still blinking and waving a hand, “you never know and there it is.” He cleared his throat and added, “I’m going to see Abby tomorrow with Craig… As William.” He added as an afterthought, he took the phone from inside his pocket. “We’re going to see the databases and all we can get from the cameras.”
He was recalling over and over about yesterday's events, almost getting himself into a depressed state. He had finished his shift at the hospital earlier than expected, had talked to Sarah, since they stayed friends – not that they have much of an option, either – and they'd had a little fight. John had been distracted doing his job, and Sarah told him he had to
"I can only imagine how it must hurt, Sherlock... I can apply some cream over, if you want." John said.
“And cinnamon! Anything with cinnamon will do!” More of Rosie’s laughter and squealing and then her voice screaming, too. “Mrs Hanson! Ginga! Digimon!”
"I know. John. Please..." at this point, John touched a spot near Sherlock's collarbone and Sherlock let out a throaty groan and he tilted his head back, watching John's face upside down right above him. Under this perspective, John could watch Sherlock's shirt, unbuttoned to mid-torso, the injured arm out of it, the other arm remaining inside the shirt. And for some reason, that arm was extremely annoying to John right now.
"The two numbers! They are the number of the facility! Xavier told me something about an order..." Armand closed his eyes again and wrinkled his nose, clearly trying to remember. John was still looking the scene, they weren't even that close, but in his mind, John saw them closer.
Sherlock stilled as his climax hit him with force, painting the sink and part of the mirror with gushes of white. John was breathing hard, harder than he should have. He quickly put his phone in his pocket to avoid it getting messed up and pressed two fingers against Sherlock’s neck. Their reflections met again but now John’s eyes were serious and concerned.
"John...?" he asked, John was about to answer but stopped when Sherlock hissed as soon as he spoke. He blinked a couple of times more and let his forehead fall over John's shoulder, letting out a pained moan. The headache was still there, a little more tolerable than last night, but still there. He rubbed a bit his face against John's shoulder in an attempt to ease the pain. John was almost petrified at Sherlock's action, but soon he knew that he still might be in pain and was just regaining consciousness; a combination he knew wasn't gratifying at all.
His mind supplied an image of John massaging his body, his hands sticky fingers with aloe, and there was skin, fingers pressing flesh, a wet noise, John’s breathing mingling with his own.
John turned to Sherlock and pointed an accusatory finger at him. “Ye- So you knew the man. That’s why the old man taken into custody was so quiet… I had been wondering the whole time.”
Sherlock eyed around the ceiling and Lestrade took the opportunity to close the laptop with the map, he took his handcuffs and walked to the woman.
Sherlock's eyes flew open, he stared at John like looking for something, his eyes wandered all over the doctor's face. He tried to read him but his mind seemed blocked. The only thing he could feel for sure was his own state of arousal, John's eyes over his, there was an odd sense of familiarity, concern and curiosity. He felt his erection being pulled out and he kicked his shoes, and after a while of awkward movement over John, pressing their chests further together, he was completely naked over the doctor.
She was obviously used to the attention; even Sherlock recognised she was an attractive woman, attractive as in Janine kind of attractive, about thirty-two – thirty-five. Not really his thing.
Sherlock’s arms were up, unsure of where to put them. He closed his eyes and, after a few seconds, moved his right hand to the back of John’s neck and his left arm slowly around John’s shoulder blade. He fisted the fabric of the jumper in the middle of John’s back and pressed his face to his shoulder and neck. He inhaled deeply the scent he found there, his mind felt disassociated from his body as he tried to make sense of what was going on. He had the feeling of moving underwater.
“Have you washed your hands with anything else today?” Sherlock asked in a hurried tone, his face inches from the surprised man. All Martin could do was to shake his head. Then Sherlock looked at John. “John?”
"It's Armand's" Sherlock answered, tilting the device a little, giving him space to watch the screen as well.
He started to spread the rest of the oil on Sherlock’s right bicep. It was a firm rub, detached. Still, Sherlock could feel John’s fingers as if they were entering his skin, he could have sworn that his breathing was audible three blocks away.
"Brilliant." Both of them exclaimed at the unison, they looked at each other in shock after that. Sherlock just lifted his smiling eyes from his cup and eyed both of the men in front. A weird feeling took place in his chest, listening both voices exclaiming the same, his musical ear took a hold of what just happened; Armand's voice held a baritone undertone, it wasn't a low voice but it was lower than John's, while John's voice was a tenor's one. The chord they had created was unique, out of tune, but unique.
Sometimes, John felt his mind playing tricks on him... sometimes he couldn't even believe it was his own mind he was dealing with, for the things it came out with were... frightening and absurdly comical. In a flash, he saw Sherlock making breakfast; tea being served in beakers, toasts being made in a lighter with that pink alcohol beneath, and jam being measured by a pipette over the toasts. Suddenly, phrases from last night's conversations flashed around his head, something about a gland-talk. He couldn't really recall if that was a dream or not, it seemed very real at least. He would have to ask Sherlock about it later. But soon he realized; Sherlock's hair was wet. He felt that very vivid in his fingers... so it
John didn’t move that much. He took a step back, seriously doubting his own intentions and disentangling his arms from Sherlock. There was a voice nagging at the back of his head telling him what if it was the aphrodisiac making him do all this, making him feel tachycardic and bothered? Because Sherlock’s sweat was making him crazy, he wanted to touch, to smell, to bite, to lick.
“Oh?” Sherlock lifted his brows when Martin left the photos back on the desk and placed his elbows on his knees, all business-like.
"Carry on." Sherlock made his voice to sound aroused, it held a breathy undertone. The guy groaned softly when he heard him.
There was something in the Yarder that John found fairly familiar. He was in his early thirties and a bright-looking bloke with cheerful eyes, broad shoulders and thin waist, things that John noticed first. The ratio between waist and shoulders should have been completely anti-aesthetical but for some reason, it wasn’t. “Oh, Ham- Dr Watson!”
"Of course it is, John." He opened his eyes and added defiantly "Want to prove it?" John threw Sherlock a very grave expression and prepared to stand up.
the right to know..." John's tone was a bit harsh and demanding in contrast with his actions, he still massaged Sherlock's hand and fingers one by one.
He led the way this time, his phone still in hand. He heard simultaneously the answer in the phone as well downstairs.
. And that's what John felt worried about. He was trying to keep his mind busy with work and helped Sherlock when he got home, mostly bringing him food and fixing them tea.
"Sherlock..." the guy lowered his voice. He seemed really enthusiastic with this "...what do you like?"
John had to blink a couple of times. Even he had to admit it, the bloke in front was a little too much. The voice reminded him right away of an infomercial. It wasn't a deep voice, but it was utterly masculine and it suited perfectly into the canon of the man.
"I'm trying the numbers the man gave us in the restaurant…" Sherlock also moved closer to John, closing the few inches separating them. Their sides were completely lined up. "Whom do you want to talk to, a woman? A man?" Sherlock grinned as he questioned.
Sherlock also imagined once a reality in which he came back with John being married and having a one-year-old kid.
“Yes. She moved to Chicago where Abby is from. I have to assume they met there. After that, Elsie moved back to her flat in Brooklyn around the time Abby moved to Huntington.” At John’s confused face Sherlock added, “It’s just one hour or so by car, do you see?” John nodded and Sherlock continued, “Something happened in 2008 that made Elsie return to Chicago. Abby remained in Huntington. Then
"Damn..." he muttered. Sherlock's face got closer to catch it, never moving his gaze from his own glass "...it's extremely warm now. Bloody awful."
John moved both of his hands to Sherlock’s chest; the heartbeat he found there was so fast it was a bit alarming. They were so close together they were sweating and their hips had found a rhythm so natural it was almost like a dance against the table.
“Sorry, what?” Miss Eldridge looked up from the computer, really looking at Sherlock – William – now.
“I can’t believe it,” John said with an amused smile as he and Sherl- William walked into a small massaging room; it was completely white with a wheeled small table, a bunch of massage oils, skincare creams and oils on top. There was also a stretcher at the centre of the room, a big plant next to a red bench near the door and a sink on the other side. A computer screen with the name ‘William Scott’ and a countdown from thirty was clearly connected to the reception desk. “You were outside twenty minutes and you had her practically on your lap, with access to the whole database.” John shook his head. “How the hell do you do that?”
“Keep telling yourself that, young lad.” She stood and patted Sherlock on his forearm, taking the tray with her. There were a few biscuits left on it and Sherlock grabbed them quickly and put them on the table. “For Rosie,” he said. She laughed all the way to her flat.
"You're right, dear... I'm just worrying too much. I will bring you boys some cakes from the cafe later in the evening." She said standing up and walking to the door.
Sherlock found himself running to their flat in a hurry. He needed to find John. He hadn't seen him all day, and knew John should be there. Lestrade had informed him, in a weird voice, that he had to find John... soon. Nothing made much sense.
"Shut up." John gave a friendly punch with his elbow on the other's stomach. "I find that incredibly dull now."
“Hang on,” John said, completely oblivious to his effect on Sherlock, a frown on his face, his hands soft over Sherlock’s thighs, his eyes on the door. “Sherlock you know, this is
"You're right." Sherlock moved quickly, sitting in the leather chair in front of him. John opened wide eyes and sighed, rubbing his temples again.
Mycroft knew he had to be careful with this man, the name Sebastian already rang a bell. He watched silently as he heard the other's conversation. Italian names rang a couple of bells as well, being
“Shlok,” she said, gesturing as if explaining something to really thick people, “Daddy looks!” she repeated, this time clearly talking to Sherlock but her tiny index finger pointing at John.
“Yep,” Sherlock leaned in his chair to point one of the names on the paper. “This one, it was the hallway camera, with this, the letters were, in order: A-R-D-E-I-P. Turn them and you get
Despite his good mood, he needed a shower, and he knew he needed to think. There were so many things he ought to sort out; Sherlock's words from last night were haunting him, even in dreams.
"I wish I knew." John answered with a shrug. He was grateful she didn't ask about anything. Hell, he was sure she heard something – perhaps everything. Or probably she was used to it, even he had heard Mrs. Turner's married ones a couple of times.
Sherlock took a wet cloth and wiped his face fast, he took a bandage that Molly and him had prepared the night before – just in case – and he wrapped it around his head to prevent blood and his hair to be seen. He put on a light blue cap then and a mask. Molly looked at him and frowned. Sherlock's expression was completely non-Sherlock. With such small elements, he was part of the hospital's staff. She couldn't help an amused smile and a headshake.
, as you call it." Sherlock added with a chuckle of his own and turned around to keep on walking to the exit of the alley.
John noted how every time Sherlock arrived to any place, the man appeared to float around the crowd, around tables and chairs and the very air. Sherlock soon was sitting in front.
John shook his head with a smile, Sherlock never failed to surprise him. "You are amazing." The words escaped his lips before he could realise it, he was about to regret it but he felt a puff of air coming from Sherlock's direction.
"It's cold in here…" Sherlock said, turning to Lestrade and eyeing an open window "…and he was cold. Don't you get it? Cold!"
“Yeah. Well,” John took a deep breath, his amusement from before completely gone, “I saw you just got in for arm massage, though.”
He lifted the spider with care and saw, below it, a folder paper. When he unfolded it, he couldn't help a snort that was followed by a loud laugh.
“I was just checking the database, John. Promise.” If there had been a time where Sherlock had dreamed of hearing John jealous… “I was able to check the eight cameras of the eight therapists that work here; yours included, obviously. They are named in a strange pattern whatsoever.”
Sherlock gave a full-body shiver. His back bent as he leant his forehead against the mirror. John moved a bit to Sherlock’s right side and dared to look up but could only see Sherlock’s hair. He stopped reading but gave the moving arm a firm squeeze. Sherlock moaned and looked up at John’s reflection, panting hard and expression pained but clearly trying to restrain any more noises he could make.
“How long?” Sherlock whispered, his eyes trained on the door. “Thirty seconds!” Craig answered as he wrote something on a black screen.
to talk to him. There were so many things he wanted to check, to confirm. Why didn't he feel anything with Armand? Was it because he only felt things with John? Or was it just because his pituitary gland... got screwed up after releasing so many drugs with John? Can it
You've been terrific and I really appreciate you are reading this A/N. It means the story was good enough to keep on reading, I believe. So thank you, thank you for reading, thank you for putting up with this, thank you for your appreciations and criticisms.
“Well, we won’t be hearing much from him now.” John got up from his chair and headed to the kitchen. “Thanks for coming over. Are you going to Slaney’s tomorrow?” he asked over his shoulder.
Sherlock lifted his face fully to look at John and tilted his head with a frown, confused. Clearly the detective didn't know the word
Sherlock smirked above him, curls falling over his forehead and the fist over his chest was replaced now by his palm. John's heart skipped a beat and started to pump rapidly again. The detective stared down directly into John's eyes, and his smirk was slowly replaced by a serious expression, the face John already knew, it was normally used when Sherlock wanted to say something nice, even though most of the time it didn't come out the right way. Sherlock inhaled deeply and then exhaling slowly he let out a quiet "Thank you."
“I see,” John said, “Is there a time of the day when it’s more noticeable to both of you?” Sherlock’s spine went visibly rigid, but John’s voice was gentle, completely in doctor’s mode.
With a swift move and a groan, John managed to roll them. He kissed Sherlock's neck as he moved his fingers as gently as he could. Sherlock was relaxed, he trusted John and John knew it. Soon the taller man was reaching for the little bottle of lotion, placing it in John's hand and John understood what Sherlock wanted now. Immediately and with unusual nervous movements, John coated his shaft with the lotion and placed the tip right outside Sherlock.
John snorted "If I liked it... well you certainly took me by surprise with that thing... with your..." he cleared his throat, "...finger."
There was a pause in which he saw everything that had happened, a movie playing in front of his -now closed- eyes. There he saw John, saw that time when he was willing to give his life for Sherlock's.
“Ah, well…” John giggled, his high pitch dangerous in the dark and the cameras, he let go of Sherlock’s arm and he sat back quietly.
"No, no. I couldn't sleep... what is it, Sherlock?" John flopped back on the bed, putting his hand over his forehead, relieved. He was trying to calm down his heart; it was now racing inside his ribcage with fear.
Sherlock woke up earlier than usual. After last night's massage he could barely get a good sleep. It was almost a miracle to see Sherlock going to sleep in his bed, and surprisingly, he actually wanted to. He had been feeling sore, even after John's massage.
Sherlock entered the fake ambulance and Louis drove away to Angelo's place. Sherlock took off his mask and eyed around. Moriarty could be anywhere now.
“I should probably apologise, though,” Sherlock said solemnly. His hands went to his lap beneath the table and John lifted his brows in confusion. “I should have known what was going to happen, but then I found the phenethylamine…”
"What the hell are you doing?" John passed his fingers over his head and let them rest on the back of his neck, moving his fingers there, trying to soothe a little his tiredness. He was very sore. He had been at the clinic from seven am until two in the morning and his body wasn't up for those prolonged activities anymore. At some point in the afternoon, he even found himself stroking his leg; the one with the psychosomatic pain.
"Alright. Visualise, John, that I'm naked in front of you... so you can do whatever you want to me."
They finished their tea in silence until a text alert took them from their reverie. Sherlock’s smile grew wide while he read it and showed the screen to John after.
“Just half an hour, as you asked,” she replied, waving a can of beans and making a small triumphant sound. John smiled up at her and made a mental note to buy Mrs Hudson that magazine she liked. “My hip is so much better, dear. When this case is over, you
Sherlock took a hold of what he was doing that last time he looked up. He had been lost memorizing every bit of John, remembering every feel, every texture, storing it all up carefully. He was breathing heavily and noticed John was in the same state. Something close to a smile crossed his lips when he observed John holding that last stare. He took a deep breath and returned to look at some point behind John's head, towards the kitchen.
Sherlock's deep chuckle resonated in the quiet room, there was almost no rain outside now. He walked to John's bed, but left door open, letting the faint light in. Even when John was sleepy, he translated the action as Sherlock wasn't staying for long.
"How can you be so sure?" At the question, John had to make every mental exercise he knew to remain calmed, he counted to ten. He was certain that even a flinch in his eye would let him exposed. Again, he took his time to answer.
When Rosie turned to look at him with a frown, offended, John howled, laughter from so deep his stomach Sherlock started to giggle softly, too.
John took the papers and eyed them as he spoke. "I doubt it. This is good enough. But since I have your number, I will contact you as soon as I have news, okay?"
“Let me get this straight,” John said, reheating rice from yesterday’s lunch and opening the can of beans. “You are making Rosie smell the things you brought home from the spa?”
"Of course your beer is too warm, your hands are burning up." He took John's glass away from him and stood up, he got closer to Jack. He was a big, muscular man, taller than Sherlock even, John noticed. Then he saw how Jack gave him a new glass with dark beer. Sherlock made his way to John gracefully. "Here" Sherlock placed the new glass in front of John. "This brand is way better than the one you had. No wonder you couldn't drink it."
That was something odd for both of them. John felt how Sherlock's heartbeat increased and he was pretty sure Sherlock could feel his too. They stayed like this for a while, just breathing, breathing in the other's scent. Both of their faces were buried in each other's juncture between neck and shoulder. "I reeeeally hope nobody sees us now..." John's spoke softly, his voice muffled by Sherlock's skin. John heard – and felt – a short deep giggle, his whole chest resonated at the sound.
"Well, he hit his head on a desk, I didn't think it was serious until now." Lestrade informed him, putting his hands on his hips and eyeing around the place. They couldn't hear more gunshots, but Lestrade knew they were going to be chased. "We need to get out of here quickly, before they come for us."
After a few minutes shifting and tossing between his sheets, he came to the conclusion that it was pointless. He lifted himself from bed, quietly put on his slippers and opened his door, not making any sound. In case Sherlock had fallen asleep on the sofa he didn't want to bother him. There was nothing but silence and a faint light leaking from downstairs.
"You like that, uh?" he asked casually, his own voice was a throaty mumble. His thumbs still massaged there, softer this time.
John was petrified. He didn't know how to take that last statement. He wanted to ask, but he decided against it. There were more important things at hands now, for example... he opened his mouth to ask about Greg's whereabouts when they heard a very loud thud, Sherlock startled, alarmed, eyeing around frantically and grabbing John by the arm, pressing both of their backs against a brick wall. Sherlock placed his arm in front of John's chest, letting him know with that gesture to stay still and quiet. John slowly moved his hand to his waistband, brushing his gun, ready to take it at any minute. Both of them were breathing with difficulty but soundlessly. John turned his head and looked everywhere.
"Whoo-hoo!" Mrs. Hudson called quietly in a high pitched voice, entering the flat with a tray in her hand. Mycroft was walking behind her, chatting friendly with the old lady and gentlemanly carrying a couple of her bags from the grocery store.
“Well, you see, Ha- Dr Watson, sorry, got a bit used to it…” Martin said with a little grimace, “I am working undercover in the Spa, only Mr Holmes and DI Lestrade know about this. We were asked by the Health Department to go investigate since they found irregularities in the water supply and water wastes. I asked Mr Holmes for help…” He gave a little laugh as he looked over at Sherlock. It looked more like a once-over. “People in the Yard are always going about how fast Mr Holmes is, better and faster than any lab, so I thought about to give it a go. Thank heavens, he agreed, nobody wants to alert the press about water testing by going to a lab full of nosy idiots.” Sherlock snorted at that. “He has been checking if the components of the products are any match to those of the water.”
John stood up from his sitting position and supported himself with one knee over the mattress, one foot still on the floor. He spread the lotion over shoulder blades and pressed his knuckles there. There was a very ugly sound when he made more pressure. Sherlock whined with an
Doctor Watson was lying in bed, awake. It had been a long day... and it felt strange to be in the dark, in silence, without Sherlock.
, Sherlock... I've gone through things you can't even fathom to imagine. You have no idea of what I used to dream of, no idea of what I wanted..."
"Outside, so keep it down. He wants to see you, I can't convince him otherwise. The guards had to take him down... Sherlock, you've got to tell him."
Sherlock took his phone back from John’s hand and they saw in silence another camera showing Elsie Patrick walking to the kitchen and to the backdoor, every light still off. They heard her yell a greeting to Hilton to the second floor and the cameras turned on; a small red light on Sherlock’s app warning the cameras had been triggered and soon they were off again. They could see her standing in front of the camera at the back door and applying another stop motion to it.
"Sherlock... your bloody... curly hair is tickling my nose..." the voice was sleepy and Sherlock could tell John was smiling lightly. The detective didn't move but a little snort let John know Sherlock was smiling now, too.
As he kept on walking to the Diogenes Club, he noticed someone was following him, a cosh hanging from his belt. He could be a police officer undercover but the face wasn't known. Sherlock turned into a corner and he heard the steps and the cosh hitting some part of the jeans of the tall man as he walked. Sherlock gave another turn and found a confined space between a ladder and a wall. He couldn't help a smirk as his mind flashed the feeling of John next to him, trapped between his body and the wall.
John's eyes snapped open at the question. It was difficult to find his voice back. "Uhm… sure, yeah, why not." He opened his arms to welcome Sherlock and the detective hugged him slowly, circling his arms around the doctor's neck and shoulders, taking his time adjusting to the embrace. He inhaled deeply, smelling John's aftershave. Even with the awkwardness of the unusual action, it was still a friendly hug; both were smiling in the other's shoulder.
The shower turned off and he froze. He gave a last look to himself and realized that his cock was still emerging from his body almost gracefully. He coughed against his will. Just how long was he standing there just holding the door handle?
" [Lestrade!] Sherlock yelled, turning around almost completely and trying to fight the firm grip on his arms. "Desrrad, what happened to the laptops? I didn't catch what you said..."
"Sherlock... we seriously need to stop." John said, Sherlock frowned a bit, but he noted a smile behind the words so he didn't say anything, "how can it be possible that, you and me, at our age, can't even kiss properly! We always end up..."
His phone remained on his lap, below the table, his thumb ready to receive another text. Sarah continued "Thank God you could make it today. Imagine! Even without the multiple collision we were short in staff..."
The photos were composed of a whole gamma of purple, red, blue and green. John got to one which clearly showed Sherlock, various images in which his hair was completely noticeable in an alarming green, his mouth open in mid-speech was black and red, his exposed neck was completely red, his nose a bit purple, and a few things green in the back. The photo was dated to today in the afternoon, almost six pm. John could feel his own blush creeping up his collar.
He moved down, as soon as he did that John shivered, a light tremor that ran from his legs all the way to his torso, finishing at John tilting his head further back sinking in the pillow, it concluded with a heavy exhalation of air through John's mouth and Sherlock nearly thought John would wake up. He waited expectantly, not moving a muscle as John tilted his head a bit again.
It wasn't frenzy as the other times before; it was slow, sensual, Sherlock's soft moans filled the room as he moved over John, his erection moved down and it rocked a bit around John's entrance and the doctor lost it, he groaned around a kiss he was planting on Sherlock's neck and Sherlock pushed further. It was a bit clumsy but John let Sherlock to do whatever he wanted. Sherlock straightened his back and his length was pressed below John's scrotum, he took John's into his hand and began to pump him, slowly, John circled Sherlock's waist applying pressure on his own entrance with the base of Sherlock's length.
"What happened to the lab?" John asked, never leaving his firm position, still looking and taking in every detail of the surroundings. The canal was not that far away now, John noted that it was closed by a little dam made of stones and concrete, he also observed, at the distance, a red sign with white letters and another sign with a skull with two bones crossed below.
In Christine's house, a couple of beeps could be heard from Sherlock's pocket. He just kept on talking to her, not paying attention to his phone.
Of course, sentiments were not his area at all, even if he knew the basic chemistry of them. He was aware but was he supposed to change because of them? John knew he needed to think, he had told that earlier and John respected that.
Sherlock disappeared to the bathroom and the doctor was left with the book over his palms. He rolled his eyes and, giving an infuriated sigh, he read the contents of the marked page of the book; there it was explained the reaction of a parent: rage, self-blame, disappointment, frustration... it also explained how a parent could have a severe long lasting depression, and then the way to let it out. There were people who threw objects against walls, others who screamed. Then it was compared to another situation, when people tends to introspect; people with anxiety for eating, or talking, or neither... it even explained about suicidal tendencies. He closed the book, hoping Christine weren't one of the last.
“You’ll probably feel something later,” Sherlock started to say, trying to sound casual through his heavy breathing, his knees straightening up as if to put some distance between them with his full height. “But it’s not going to be so strong as this one. I told you my coat had some of the liquid, which was a concentrate. You probably inhaled or touched some of it in the car. It’s going to be-”
There was noise downstairs and Sherlock got to his feet. Abby’s face was down, her eyes fixed to the ground and her stance defeated with tears falling from her eyes. Sherlock held out his palm to John. For a moment John felt like taking it but then he understood what Sherlock wanted and handed over her gun with the handkerchief.
A short throaty giggle resonated in the quiet space, the showery background noise became a little more intense. The lights at the street and in the port went on so the little drops were visible against the orange blur of the lights.
Sherlock chewed slowly and carefully. He swallowed, needing time to answer. Thousands of replies passed through his mind, each with a different outcome. But there was nothing to hide anymore, was there? He couldn’t remember a time in which he didn’t have to hide anything from John. He was always careful with his words; one or the other flirting was allowed, but now? What could he possibly say?
but now... now he wouldn’t change this bliss for anything. He loved Sherlock, and after this, all of his doubts dissipated into nothing. Probably Sherlock would never say anything, probably he would never say his feelings out loud and John was fine with that for now. He had learned that more important than words were the facts, as Sherlock had demonstrated oh so many times.
"Now what?" John asked. The wind was strong too, so he had to raise his voice to be heard by the taller man next to him.
John was still with a knowingly smile on his face. He had to admit, even if he complained about it most of the time, he utterly enjoyed when Sherlock was an arse with Lestrade and to his own brother. He knew the detective meant no harm about this, but the acid comments, the behaviour and body language never failed to bring this grin to his face. Most of all, because it never failed to exasperate Mycroft, and Lestrade was always acquiescent about it, even if he complained afterwards. A conversation from many months was always present when something like this happened. The deep tone of voice used by Sherlock rang in his head
John lifted himself quickly off the bed and went downstairs wearing his pyjama pants and a sweatshirt. When he got to the kitchen, the view almost gave him a heart attack.
He walked closer to Sherlock and placed his palm on Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock unconsciously tilted his head to it, seeking the caress. John slid his thumb over Sherlock's lips. At the same time, he got closer to his ear and said softly, "Sherlock. I'm right here."
John clenched his eyes and gasped through the laughter and curses. His agitated state slowly subsided, being replaced by a slow and steady breathing. He closed his eyes gently now, as if to prove he was relaxed enough. When he did that, he immediately noticed how silent the flat was. The only noises that could be heard were his own breathing and Sherlock's calmed one.
"Sherlock…" John's voice was merely a whisper. Sherlock moved apart from John a little so he could observe the doctor's face. Slowly, Sherlock brought both of his hands to cup John's jaw and pulled him closer, closing the space between them.
“Oh! I could spill it on the floor!” Mrs Hudson said with obvious glee; Rosie clapped and Sherlock snickered. He secretly enjoyed to see her so joyfully cooperating with their cases.
“I see,” John moved his face closer to Sherlock’s shoulder, still massaging. Sherlock desperately missed the
“God bless, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock breathed, his whole demeanour never showed how fast his blood was pumping. Oh, how he loved this. 99%.
"Cheap prices... John... you're brilliant!" Sherlock placed the laptop on John's lap and got up quickly. He took the papers given to him by Lestrade.
There was a pregnant silence. Sherlock swallowed and bit his lips from the inside, fumbled with his phone, cleared his throat again and said, “Did you notice every room is marked with a letter?”
Lestrade noted this and quickly ran to help him out, leaving both laptops inside the pickup. Sherlock seemed drunk. Which John also noted, getting out from the pickup to help Sherlock back on his feet.
His thoughts wondered to Mycroft again, he thought about the woman, about Armand, about the cases he couldn't write in his blog.
“You’re not convincing either-” The words died down on Sherlock’s lips when John’s hand slapped over his mouth and the other pinched one of his nipples. Hard. Sherlock’s grip on John’s air tightened and John groaned, laughter completely forgotten when, with all the sudden movement, one of John’s fingers went inside Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock had to struggle to keep the laptop over his knees.
Feelings he didn't held towards the people on the phone. There was no other possible explanation, he knew he felt something strong for John, he knew and was well aware of the fact that he actually...
Sherlock stood from his sitting position and started to play a lovely melody. Again, his eyes were fixed on John's; two pale pools of energy staring at the doctor. John smiled lightly and his eyes immediately closed, tilting his head back, sighing silently. Yes. He was enjoying the peace.
After several minutes of silence, John stood up, decided. He extended his hand to Ella and the therapist understood that was perhaps the last time she was going to see him.
“Unless you need another reason for the leaf to be on your bed.” Sherlock tried for light teasing but it came out as thick flirting instead. “Which is, you know… fine.”
"Molly, Molly... if you hadn't dump me we could be having so much fun right now..." he smiled. "You look so bored after all, so ordinary... oh well! I have a DVD to record..."
He was back a few seconds later with Inspector Martin, who just grabbed everything Sherlock put in his hands, he barely managed a hello before he was barraged with Sherlock’s enthusiasm.
The scene she found was very picturesque; a semi dark flat, semi naked Sherlock over the sofa. John on top of him, one of the long arms up in the air, and John supporting himself on Sherlock's back. And to add a little touch, Sherlock's had a hard grip to one of the cushions next to him and he was somewhat panting.
"John..." Sherlock moaned, "God, John... John!" The slow pace they held slowly went to a crescendo, John couldn't take it as Sherlock pressed his buttocks further against him, he buried his face below Sherlock's jaw, the taller man felt his whole body burn but specially that part as John's stubble rubbed the juncture between neck and shoulder, hot breath was falling over his skin there.
Sherlock looked where John’s hand held his upper arm, in fact, the muscles and now the veins were visible, too. What could he say? He relaxed, but he still felt his stomach tensed up. His penis had – to his mortification – completely firmed up as well.
After a couple of seconds of sweet self-torture, he brushed a bit more Sherlock's lips, giving a soft kiss over the detective's upper lip. He moved back a little and couldn't help a little sigh "Sherlock..."
"Can I...?" John motioned to the bathroom behind her, his voice broken. She nodded slowly, her sympathetic smile widening. John entered the little bathroom and washed his face. He stood there some extra minutes, trying to regain his composure back. He looked at himself in the mirror, his attire completely black. John squared his shoulders and exhaled heavily through his nose, returning completely back to normal to the chair in front of Ella.
way…" she turned to look at Sherlock again, he seemed absorbed in a paper in his hands now. “Is he single?” John couldn't believe it. Another girl at Sherlock's feet and the detective seemed unaware of it!
"Well..." Sherlock got closer to John's ear again, "...I just told her that a woman so beautiful like her; with beautiful face, healthy skin, nice body, legs, and all... shouldn't be flirting around with a man like me."
"Ah, that one... yeah, I was running with a bloke over my shoulders and a bomb exploded. I fell over that rock, it wasn't even that big but with the weight I got that scar."
"Good. What else?" John lowered his sight to Sherlock and took a real hold on how close their faces were. He smiled shortly.
Sherlock placed his other hand over John's. It was a nice feeling, he felt then the pulse below the thumb of the doctor.
"It is embarrassing, Sherlock." he started, at the same time he placed loudly the two cups on the kitchen table. "I knew my father was involved somehow but I only thought it was because of my aunt. I had my suspicions since she was the only one offering me her help when she knew I had gone away from my parent's home. It seemed suspicious and I thought my father had sent her, but then I realized that she knew an awful lot about my job. After talking about it with Xavier my suspicion rose, but I never imagined..." at this point, Armand's voice trembled. The usually low and calmed voice had now a little tremor and it slowly high pitched with every word. Sherlock looked at him expressionless, waiting for him to finish.
John took his jacket off and moved closer to Sherlock, making the taller man face him, he carefully raised his hands around his neck and wrapped him in a tender hug.
It made the doctor to come back to reality. He felt the sticky liquid on his hand and he noted how some of it had somehow landed between his and Sherlock's chests and stomach. He was feeling his own climax closer. He, not even caring of wiping his hand, positioned it over Sherlock's over his own member, stroking him again, steady and firmly. Sherlock complied the silent order and, without thinking about it, squeezed one of John's buttocks in his large hand. John opened wide eyes at this, but had to bury his face in the space between Sherlock's neck and shoulder. That action brought new sensations to him, making him moan deeply. Sherlock kissed his shoulder, working with his lips, tongue and teeth every bit of skin he could reach. Slowly, he moved his lips from John's neck to his jaw, he licked there and soon he was nibbling at John's earlobe.
John was nervous. He knew it was all a natural and a normal process of the body repealing the drug, but despite of all of his medical training, he wasn't mentally prepared to see his – usually composed – friend like this.
"Yes! Yes, we do. There is something I uh... need to recall from the nightmare and for that, I need you to do exactly what you did last night."
But John didn't move, he watched in awe in between their bodies, his own semen was falling slowly from Sherlock's arse and he swallowed, his face lost in thought and realisation.
"You mean, if we get old and grey and we couldn't be able of...? I guess it will be okay, too." He snorted and felt Sherlock do the same. "Do you realise..." he added, lowering his tone and his volume, "I'm a grown up man?" the doctor added using his most normal voice.
"I have never held a grudge to them. I've heard some from the homeless and of course, I have to fit in and tag along when I'm in disguise. Sexual jokes don't alarm me the slightest, John. I can even tell you a few."
And then there was Armand. At the thought of the young man he couldn't help a sympathetic smile. The bloke had feelings for Sherlock. It didn't need a master in deductions since it was as clear as water. But the reason of why the bloke was so friendly towards him as well was a mystery... maybe there are still people out there believing in justice, people with a noble heart, with a pure heart... something he was pretty sure couldn't brag about himself.
John just sighed and fixed his eyes at some point in front of them. He saw how a couple of guys were looking at them suspiciously but he didn't mind that much, really.
He touched himself slowly at first; he couldn't recall when the last time he did this was. He took the base of his erection and stroked up slowly, making it last, he tilted his head back with a muted moan. He cupped the head then, moving his thumb over the fluid accumulating there. It was sticky by now, which only meant he’d been hard and wet for quite a while. His memories from earlier replayed; Sherlock had told him to imagine. He could only catch a few phrases '...
"What." Sherlock turned to John with a confused frown. The light outside was still enough to read, even, so Sherlock had a really good view of his friend with the little distance separating their faces; the doctor was flushed and was still giggling uncontrollably.
"You don't fool me, Sherlock..." the soft masculine voice cut the silence like a blade, Sherlock just looked up to the man in front "I know it was you."
"Dunno what you said, Lestrade but I didn't like it..." Sherlock tried to spell out. His attempt at glaring only made Lestrade laugh harder.
“Her father made her do that!” she exclaimed. “We didn’t… it was never our intention to kill anyone with PIEDRA, we only wanted to make them realise how it felt to be in love!”
; now every time they got close he felt both his and Sherlock's pulse rise a little higher. Neither of them said or did anything though. It was abundantly clear that neither of them wanted to do anything about it… at least for now. Last night, for example, John was about to start writing the Hound of Baskerville case and couldn't; Sherlock was staring intently at him and that, of course, was very distracting. John opted to get up and escape to his room.
“I wouldn’t want to ruin the fun for you.” Sherlock smirked and John lifted his free hand in the air, sighing an
Hours later in the evening, around 8 pm, John had to stop as soon as he entered their flat in Baker Street.
"Sherlock, you need to calm down. You've lost some blood besides half litre I took from you last night. Here-" She walked to a desk nearby and handed Sherlock a cup, it had a clear liquid inside.
"You're right..." Armand whispered, "When I turned thirty last year and changed my section they gave me a new card... I got surprised how only a couple of numbers changed."
Sherlock turned to look at John and he managed a weak smile, remembering immediately Molly's words. '
Sherlock nodded as well and continued, "Well, he started his politics career when he was very young, so I guess he was a good prospect. I used to look up at him. One day, I entered the living room in our house and there was this girl all over him. He was almost giving in."
"Very. It was incredibly chilly outside and I had to wait a long time for a cab..." Sherlock sighed and proceeded, "the cabbie who took me in was returning to his home, so he left me around five blocks from here..." the serious tone in which Sherlock was talking seemed incredibly humorous to John, who was visualizing an over grown kid sulking.
"... a bit cockier than usual." He said tossing the phone back to Sherlock, who just caught it and saved it in his jacket's pocket.
Mycroft sighed as he recalled the report Greg Lestrade had given him at the end of the Dartmoor case. The DI had been casual about that, not paying attention but simply almost as a joke and anecdote '
matter. He couldn't involve his agents, since it has something to do with the government. He thinks it's about the plants' black market. Do you see now?" he said, gesturing a circular movement with his fork in the air.
The detective smirked at him as he hailed a cab, once John got in Sherlock couldn't help but reach for the other man. John gave him his hand and it slipped through Sherlock's fingers. The taller man felt something go up and down inside his stomach, he told himself that he shouldn't be worried about John. Immediately after he thought how he really should be paying extra attention at the actions his body was doing without his mind's permission.
He moved the fabric down, sliding it slowly and carefully, pants and trousers together. He had to remove himself from the bed to slide them completely from John's body.
It was too soon when John received a call about Mrs. Hudson being shot. Sherlock felt how all of John's rage somehow surfaced at that very moment, calling him a '
He moved around the slow-paced scene and observed himself with John again. Now he was grabbing John’s hand and it was sliding through his fingers. The sound of the slippery product was loud in the silence and he fought the need to clear his throat. He moved to the sink. In the background he heard John’s voice, ‘
!” and a little horse was dancing around the website. She snickered at the same time Craig said “Yes!”
The detective sipped his coffee silently now, victory dancing in his eyes. John and Armand looked at the man in awe.
Sherlock walked to her, took the cup, closed his eyes and drank it all in one gulp. Molly looked somewhat satisfied, despite the pain her eyes held. Once Sherlock was done, he placed the cup back into Molly's hand. He exhaled as one of John's shouts could be heard from outside the morgue, as he tried to get in.
Sherlock seemed to calm down a little, he took his left hand off the wall and covered John's hand on his cheek with his own. It wasn't cold like this afternoon –
And that night, in Sherlock's bed, the detective had been insecure about John's feelings, it was all the same but this time translated to a physical and sexual context.
to this, Sherlock did as he was told with a frown. He didn't understand what John was up to. He trusted him completely though.
Sherlock came with a low, almost silent moan. John heard gasps and felt the erratic jerks in his hand and Sherlock's hand squeezing his own.
“Shh…” John placed his hand over Sherlock’s mouth, conscious of the noise and Mrs Hudson downstairs. He moved his other hand to Sherlock’s broad chest and pressed his palm hard against the flat muscles, feeling almost in a trance by looking at his own fingers opening one, two, three and four buttons of the white shirt, the scarce hair he found there was awfully tempting and he wondered how it would feel under his lips. He looked up and saw sweat on Sherlock’s neck, so the most logical thing right now was to lick it; his tongue firm and hard against the skin.
“You were brilliant today, Sherlock,” John pressed himself closer yet, a hand on Sherlock’s lower back. He lifted his face a bit to be heard. “The way you uncovered everything was... amazing.”
know many things about it, but never experienced it yourself. You probably think it's just an act for procreating, and deleted it from your hard drive. Or maybe you think you're
Leaning forward, he really considered waking John up, but there was something he wanted to try he had read in the psychology book; being in a slumber, responses are not filtered by the brain since the body just feels and acts accordingly to a stimulation, raw feelings. John was responsive even in his sleep, he noticed by the shivers. He wanted to make John
There was something about John’s voice that clearly affected Sherlock’s erection a bit more, since he had gone from partially to fully erect in two minutes, if the countdown on the screen was to be believed.
"The... case..." Sherlock repeated absentmindly. When he finally reached the last page he read aloud, "passionate crime, hot line facilities, people with accent... really John..." he added looking over at his friend, "I wasn't lying when I said you should become a professional author..."
"Mr. Holmes..." the man continued in the same hushed voice, "I have the feeling that, whatever you're going to find in this case, might really compromise the integrity of my employer. Please, under any circumstance, never mention I was the one who gave you this information."
There was a loud deafening noise and James had to take his headphones off in one swift, fluid movement. "Ouch! That wasn't nice!"
"Why are you turning it off? I thought we were watching the news." John asked. He surprised himself at how calmed his voice sounded.
John supported his back on the couch but Sherlock stayed in the same position, staring at some point in front of him again. After a couple of minutes, in which John struggled to keep his calm, his thumbs rubbing lovingly the other's hand, he dared to speak.
"I am aware of that, yes, but that's not what brought you here, is it?" Trying to change the topic, Mycroft offered him a cigarette; Phillip took it and toyed with it between his fingers. The gesture somehow annoyed Mycroft.
He knew he had to get out of the situation. Fast. Sherlock wasn't moving from his position and was still staring at him. John just smiled weakly.
the best for the job?" Armand's voice echoed in the dark place. He was questioning to a figure in front, somewhere in between many shadows. He was mad, he didn't like to be treated like this, he was a free man, always have been.
Without words and without moving his body, John roamed his fingers from Sherlock's chest to the buttons of his shirt, he toyed with them for a moment. After a couple of seconds, he slipped his hand to entangle his fingers on Sherlock's curls in the back of his head, keeping Sherlock there. John rested his cheek over his soft hair. It felt like a hug. Slowly, Sherlock wrapped his right arm around John's shoulder. His left hand still supported him on the armrest next to John. The position was comfortable; their bodies seemed to mingle together. As John regained consciousness, his senses filled with the usual smell of Sherlock's perfume and his own scent, combined with something else.
“People need to feel good,” the record – Abby – continued, “when I opened this spa in London I wanted people to feel good in every aspect of their lives. You know sex is an important human feature; having someone they can rely on and a place they trust when they are alone and need a release – there was more paper noise – here. This is the erotic spectrum of our spa and here… are the services provided and the price for each. We have colourful names for the service and they’re always gender-free. You can pretty well bring a woman to orgasm or a man, it doesn’t matter. As long as it’s sanitary and the two parties ag-”
“She wakes up in the morning with the after-effects of an aphrodisiac. You heard she’s thirsty, her libido has gone up… she wakes up with a sour taste in her mouth-” Sherlock’s phone lit up with a new message and he hurried to check it. His face broke out into a soft smile and John’s curiosity was piqued.
happened in 2010 when she moved to a temporary home in Cherry Hill, Philadelphia. She stayed in a charity home and then she came to London. Why charity? She’s a chemist, she had plenty of job opportunities but she preferred to keep a low profile. Then she met Hilton, they moved in together and, well,” Sherlock made a gesture with his phone in the other room direction, “you know the rest.”
The pause that followed had John awake for the best part of the night: Sherlock breathed, just breathed. Deep, slow, deliberately. John was stuck there, his presence known but not acknowledged, soldiering on again through Sherlock’s small breakdown.
"I don't think so... I know the bloke at the financial department. They were even thinking about expanding!" Armand brushed his fingertips to his lips, thinking, remembering, "There was a little company they wanted to buy, so they could merge them together. The rumour was strong among us, workers. And soon Xavier confirmed it to me. Oh, by the way, Xavier is the financials' headmaster I was talking to you about before…"
After hours comparing data – John had seen it coming – from both lists, Sherlock got to the conclusion that they were selling non approved drugs for the hospital. They were keeping somewhere, somehow, the original ones.
” Sherlock could hear some brakes. Small car, careless driver, not strong enough to control the wheel. He rolled his eyes and shook his head. “
The cab had stopped in a lonely wide alley and Sherlock quickly stepped out of it, John gave more money than needed to the old man. There were no souls around in the street, there were no sounds either; like a ghost town.
Sherlock smirked again, the same gesture John had come to get so used to when Sherlock found a new challenge. He placed the cup on the table. This time, the deduction was not spoken frantically like he was accustomed to; it was calmed, his voice throaty and low.
"Really, John. Try to concentrate." Sherlock had to speak louder now if he wanted to be heard by John. Then he moved his teasing fingers in a slower way, "If you do, it can come really in handy. If there's any case of pain, for example, to be able to control your body with your mind. Breathe!"
"Dear! I thought you were coming home later!" She smiled tenderly and helped him out of his jacket. John smiled back and gave her a brief hug as a greeting.
They followed her to a very big square room with high ceilings like the rest of the house but it had a huge picture window on one side facing the front yard and garage. The curtains were made of tulle so everything outside was visible from any part of the room without having to move the curtains to the side, but it also meant that any light in the room could be seen from the outside as well.
Armand's lips barely touched the cup in his hand, his eyes were fixed on the detective sitting in front. John was really enjoying the breakfast, eating pieces of everything on his plate. Sherlock's coffee remained intact and the toasts Armand presented on a plate in front, untouched.
As John felt the familiar weight over his own thighs, automatically, he rested his wrists on them, book still in his hands. Sherlock's lips lifted a bit when, after a couple of minutes, John started to scratch lightly on his trouser. Minutes after that, he was tapping, probably he was following a melody. Sherlock concentrated on the tapping rhythm, just out of curiosity, and discovered it was the Italian melody they were playing at Angelo's.
“Relax,” John said, firmly. Only then Sherlock noticed that his hands were tightly closed on his sides and that he had been holding his breath. “Breathe,” he added.
Sherlock sighed, stood up and walked to the door surprisingly calm. Once there he dipped part of his scarf inside a glass with water and put the wet cloth around his neck, John started to follow right away.
"I do!" Armand ran his fingers through the long locks falling over his eyes. "It was the way I got to your blog in the first place! Really nice move there, by the way... the pictures for the criminals to tell you apart from Mr. Holmes..." Armand chuckled.
“Oh my God, what are they d-?” John couldn’t finish his sentence, Sherlock’s voice resonated around the flat again.
Sherlock and Lestrade got inside the facility through a window at the second floor, they walked quietly by some corridors. No sound could be heard inside, which alerted them greatly. John followed shortly after. It seemed that they were not expected after all, since the only security they had was the camera at the front door.
Sherlock frowned again. This was all too predictable. There was no surprise, no... Nothing. He'd predicted somehow that the girl was going to say something along the lines of
Slowly Sherlock lifted his eyes. When they locked their gazes they chuckled shortly. "I hate them." He said softly.
John asked for a miracle. A miracle that he, deep inside, just proved how much faith John had in him, he asked for the only thing he knew Sherlock could do. He didn't pray to God, even if John had done that before, he didn't do that, he asked for a favour, a personal favour, for him alone. From Sherlock to John.
John sighed then, since he really needed this night out, needed to clear his mind. Away from 221b. Away from Sherlock.
John stood slowly and carefully from Sherlock's bed and smiled when he turned to see the mess of sheets and blankets over the mattress they shared. He eyed the closet, it was still open and the clothes were still spread all over the floor. He couldn't help a silent laugh as he recalled Sherlock falling on his arse.
"No. Sherlock..." John didn't know what to do. His state was precarious. And what was that sound? Was Sherlock touching himself, right now, on the phone, talking to him? Sure, the conversation had varied a little – a lot – from its original purpose, but to come this far. John was going crazy with the sound and the deep, throaty voice at the other side of the line.
John knew Sherlock didn't like the idea, but he also knew his pride could wait. He guided Sherlock to the large sofa and the detective sat there, throwing his head back and coughing a couple of times.
"No, not really..." Sherlock rolled his eyes, "but wasn't Mycroft who gave you the case in the first place?"
They both snorted and the silent that followed was filled up with their eyes. They observed each other faces, their breathing were normal now. John's face changed its expression several times, Sherlock knew John wanted to ask but he waited. He was getting good at it, after all.
“It’s brilliant, isn’t it?” Martin repeated, “They are testing products according to the reaction of the patients…”
Sherlock smiled back, he knew it was that goofy thing that made him look like a child, only one side of his mouth going up and his teeth showing up. He laid back in his original position on the stretcher and added, still smiling: “Do your worst”.
"It's alright Sherlock." John showed him the cloth with a faint stain of red, Sherlock smiled. "Please. It's alright. I
"Sherlock…" John got closer to his companion and made a gesture tilting his head, making the taller man to follow a couple of meters away from Amanda and Lestrade. Sherlock still held a photograph in his hand, but he walked away with John. "It's bloody obvious. Don't tell me you didn't notice it."
"Mycroft...?" Sherlock shook his head and chuckled lightly after his warning tone, "you're assuming too much, you're losing your touch, dear brother."
"I have the records of every text I’ve had with Xavier, some mails, some documents of money transfers... you might find them useful... and I just erased our phone call, it was an mp3... the phone is unlocked."
“That’s Elsie Patrick,” Sherlock whispered over his shoulder, his body covering almost the bathroom door completely. He was talking very quietly and John didn’t dare to lift himself off the closed lid. “Here, look at the cameras and tell me if you see any change on them.” Sherlock passed John his phone with two cameras on display on the screen: the front door and the back door from which they had entered. He moved to look outside the bathroom window.
it's going to be on the news soon, send miss Hickey to report about the tale and once the article is ready and the case is solved, leak it out to the press... yes of course, the Daily Star as always..." there was irony and a grimace behind some of the words, as if Phillip was joking, he rolled his eyes a couple of times at Mycroft as he spoke, and the iceman just smiled a couple of times and shook his head, almost a clear '
Reluctantly, he walked to take the headphones again, plugging them back to the little wireless modem device.
John froze. He felt how his soul left his body slowly. He felt himself going stiff and suddenly he had no control over his facial expressions... or body language. He didn't want to turn to look at the DI, but nonetheless, his words brought him back.
like this one.” And he winked, without a second thought. He winked at Sherlock, using Sherlock’s masturbatory text. God, had he just… And only a nanosecond after he realised what he had done but it was too late.
"Well, there is this blog, written by an army doctor, John... Watson I believe. I love detective stories, so I got hooked into that. He writes about a super cool detective, Sherlock Holmes. He lives right here in London."
He exited the cafe with a satisfied smirk, looking up to the sky, smiling at the sun, taking his phone from his pocket and sighed, it was the first time talking to the DI after all, they didn't talk at Sherlock's funeral either.
He walked quietly from one side of the room to the other, his military training never lost, noticing how the curtains moved when he passed close to them. He walked to the opposite corner of the room, in which he found five medium-sized boxes of a brand he had seen before - but couldn’t recall where - and a convenient hiding spot behind them just in case.
“The nervous state in which I had been these last days rendered me ever so much the more excitable.”
Sherlock had heard the steps too so his breathing was deliberately slow and calmer, the hand on John’s arse moved slowly to the lower part of his back. The hand on his neck was still caressing John’s nape and hair. John moved his hand from Sherlock’s mouth and placed it on his neck and slid his nose to Sherlock’s jaw, unable to let go just yet.
John’s face went scarlet when, even with the commotion, he remembered what that hand had done earlier in the night.
"No, no... You're right. I've been willing to say that too, but you know... I'm a lady." She eyed the place and whispered. "But that
Sherlock's head faced the door, his bare torso sprawled over the cushions. John looked down, still hands on his hips, next to him.
"Oh, Lestrade also told me Sherlock knocked himself out on a desk..." Mrs. Hudson made a flinch and he smiled to give her assurance, "it's nothing serious... there was some blood, but there's only a little cut under the cheekbone, nothing else."
The Knee Grope (Sherlock couldn’t name it any other way if he wanted), that small touch that had sent pinpricks high up his thigh, and had Sherlock thanking a God he didn’t know existed for booze and its ability to put down unwanted casual cock reactions (but sometimes he scolded himself for unwanted brain-to-mouth reactions that had him saying “
Lifting his arms to Sherlock's shirt, he grabbed the fabric there and felt the pressure of long fingers on his jaw, moving his face to close the space between them, Sherlock's expression was utterly serious and concentrated, his lips were parted seeking the much needed air. Then suddenly everything was turned upside down.
"Do you even realize how awkward this situation is...? You and me, hiding in a little secluded space, rain outside... it's almost... I don't know."
"Yes, I know. No control over them, there is no way to know when they're going to happen and even if you did know, there is nothing you can do about it." John sighed and took a sip of his tea, settling into the cushions, next to Sherlock.
Before taking the paper off the ground, Sherlock looked at her with his eyes piercing and she gulped, her chin raised in defiance.
the sound in his body, but Rosie and John’s comfort were always above his own, now. Still, his body was throbbing, aching, vibrating in mute. A particular high note made him bit his lower lip and flop onto the arm of his chair, crossing his legs so he could feel a bit of much-needed friction. The vibrato that came from that made his arse cheeks clench tightly and that simple and involuntary movement made his penis throb inside his pants.
When Mary died two years ago and John had accepted the offer of his old room at Baker Street with Rosie now a toddler and the nursery (thanks to godfather Sherlock), these moments were more and more frequent between them. John always brushed them off as if they were nothing important. Maybe they weren’t. Important. But sometimes, like now, Sherlock’s voice would go low, his demeanour carefree, as if he never imagined that these small comments could pass as flirting in other people’s eyes.
"What do you want to know?" Sherlock's tone was cold, bitter. He was walking faster now and John had to jog a bit to follow.
"Oh but you like it, Sherlock... you love it when you see him. Oh well!" there was a pause and then only breathing. "It's normal you know," the voice continued, "when you own a pet, you are happy just when you see it moving its tail, don't you think?"
There was a thud sound, some panting and James lifted his brows in surprise, his jaw moving as he chewed on his gum.
"What happened in the lab?" John asked curious. Sherlock was about to answer when, unconsciously, John moved his thumb behind Sherlock's ankle. The detective startled and stiffed in his sitting position.
When he was 14, he had said something to a girl and he could still remember it clearly. And sometimes, when he recalled the whole scene, even now with 42, he would still groan in agony and shut his eyes tightly in embarrassment.
"How was NOT?" John proceeded, trying his best to sound serious. "If you'd saved your stupid comment last night, we wouldn't be in this ridiculous situation!"
John composed himself, taking deep breaths just like Ella had taught him. When he finally processed the question, he snorted and added, “I should be the one asking that.”
Sherlock stared down as John slowly opened his eyes, he was panting hard, his lips parted and his expression contorted in pleasure, the pleasure that Sherlock had brought alone.
"Well..." Sherlock let out a little chuckle, "let's just say Stamford was very lucky to be there right at the moment. He has certain favouritism on her for a time now, despite being married, I must add. He’d got to take her home in a very compromising state."
face. John was walking over to them when then the girl gave Sherlock a loud slap on his face. Sherlock just looked at her and smirked arrogantly. Of course he knew she was going to slap him but he let her do it. She walked away fast and, as she passed next to John, she gave him a hateful glare and thumped him with her shoulder. John's curiosity grew when he saw her expression.
, " he pointed to the card Sherlock was playing with between his fingers "is my member card, it has my number."
"The idea is appealing, yeah." John answered giving a light tilt of his head as well, his face was also very serious.
.” Sherlock’s hips moved closer to John’s in a movement so forceful that John lost a bit of his balance. His left hand grasped the edge of the stretcher, Sherlock supporting the small of his back there.
John looked doubtful for a second, his eyes scanning Sherlock’s body but then he turned his gaze on the still sleeping Chloe. He rushed towards her and put his ear above her mouth to check her breathing, his doctor mode coming back right away.
John entered his room, put some pyjamas on, gave Rosie a kiss and got under the covers. His mind was still tormenting him with the wink. The Wink.
As Sherlock went deep into his thinking, it had occurred to him this morning, how maybe all of this was necessary to stop Moriarty. It wouldn't be the first time Mycroft thinks faster than himself; he had been deceived by him twice, even... perhaps what Mycroft had told them was the real concern about his conclusions of all of the criminal's actions. Moriarty was playing a game that involved even The Woman. And Sherlock was the main part of it; a white match against the black one. A chess match; no matter how much the black pieces moved around the board, there was no use if the white pieces didn't move to attack – or to defend, for that matter – as well. The only way to stop the white pieces was to make the main piece, the king, to fall.
He had gotten a call from Lestrade because he needed to find John. Again, he felt the fear of going upstairs, Mrs. Hudson wasn't there. He hid a pepper spray, John was in the flat, he'd felt relief, he had hugged John and then he had kissed John.
There, at the inn, Sherlock had made clear John was his only friend. Even when John had been angry – and he had the right to be – he was incredibly happy. The feeling was mutual, and he knew it for sure at last. Now about the other feeling…
What really caught Sherlock by surprise was the sight of Elsie’s hands being forcefully grabbed by an old man. He started to walk to help her but a younger man assaulted Sherlock from behind.
"Drugs." Sherlock interrupted. "It's a whole new group of drugs dealers... a big one, John." John nodded and Sherlock continued. "They are trying to go undercover and they were deliberately changing the drugs in the hospitals. Now the drugs are the usual ones though, but they lowered the price to rise up suspicions from the dealers, so they can lower their facade when they start to look for the guilty that is selling the
It was true he wanted to be touched by John's hands, it was also true his body's quick and strong reactions when it was about John. It was true about the phone experiment that proved his arousal state being null when there was this lack of...
Sherlock opened his eyes and, even only having the light of the kitchen, saw the proof that John had been in the bathroom this morning, the facts as clear as a film in his eyes: John taking a shower, his towel around his hips as he shaved, brushing his teeth, taking his towel off and leaving it hanging right there, and had walked nude – passing close to the frosted door to Sherlock’s room – and crouched a bit to retrieve his pants from above the toilet lid.
"I'll make sure you enjoy it, Sherlock..." Armand kissed his neck again and ran his lips to the detective's collarbone, slowly. When he got there, Sherlock took Armand's hand from his neck and planted it over his trouser, right above his cock, making pressure, with a firm grip on the man's wrist.
day – he had slept most of the morning – and Sherlock was on his laptop on the desk by the window, refilling his glass of water every few hours. They had asked Mycroft to bring Rosie tomorrow evening – aware of the possible remains of the liquids – so the light was dim and there was an unusual silence for this time of the evening.
"Each one of the employers has a unique code," Armand spoke looking intently at the detective, "I never really thought so much about it, but you get one the first time you have a call. You introduce the code in the phone you're going to use, just then you can get clients. So, they record the conversation, they follow your progress and then they pay you according the length of the call."
Sherlock was still blinking and John was left in doubt if the colour across Sherlock’s face was that of the lamp, the reflection of the red mug or something mundane like blushing.
"Hi!" he started, friendlier this time, "you can call me... John." Sherlock was about to say his real name but he stopped. Maybe his name wouldn't be good for the experiment. He had to include
Sherlock's mind raced with all kind of wonders when he slept like this. Especially now, when his body was betraying him way too often if John was around. There was a phrase coming often to his mind, the one John had written on his blog, at The Hound of Baskerville case:
"You okay?" the doctor questioned from the sofa after half an hour of imperturbable silence. He observed Sherlock, who just played with the item sitting on his usual chair.
The ID was blank and the face of the photograph was a mask. He wasn't recovered of his surprise yet when he heard steps and was about to leave the man there when he realized it was Louis.
In the kitchen, with a hand over the handle of the fridge, John was getting mentally prepared to open the appliance and find a head staring at him, when he heard a noise from the sofa area.
"Molly." She said quietly, Sherlock lifted his eyes for a second to look at her; he frowned then quickly returned to the microscope.
He was quick to get out of John and bedroom (however, in a second he still got a glimpse of John’s watch on the side table, of Rosie’s pink jumper in the crib, of John’s military habit of making the bed without a wrinkle).
"No, of course you haven't. You couldn't sleep that night, could you?" there was a dark chuckle, "that night your pet killed my cabbie. He was going to die anyway, oh yeah, I almost forgot about that! You loved to deduce that, even if it was a
Without much thought, Sherlock moved his own hand and positioned it over John's. John felt his heart swell at the gesture and stayed quiet, looking at Sherlock's hand over his own. His hands were large and strong and… ice cold.
"I'm sorry..." John muttered before closing the remaining millimetres between them. At first it was a soft touch. They both pressed their lips together, it wasn't really a kiss. Sherlock moved back a little. He opened his eyes and searched for any sign of regret on John's face. "Sherlock..." he said opening his eyes and then rolling them at him "Stop. Stop... this. Stop worrying about me. Please." Then he lowered his voice and added with a faint smile. "Really, doesn't suit you as much as you think."
Scenes from the night before replayed immediately in his mind. "Oh God..." His voice was hoarse and throaty and he couldn’t help a furious, quick blush at the memory and felt a tingle in his lower belly. He chuckled silently with a light headshake.
Lestrade stood there for several seconds, obviously thinking about something else as his eyes darted between Sherlock and John; they remained silent, their expressions unchangeable.
Buttons got opened one by one by Sherlock's fingers, using only one hand with secure but quick movements, not frantic, but not soft or slow either. His other hand still caressed John's. Once the pyjama top was completely open, Sherlock noticed a shiver; fair tiny hairs on John's chest and the lower part of his stomach rose up with goose bumps, the light coming in from outside the window allowed them to glow golden, Sherlock’s fingers brushed around them causing John to sigh and arch his back in a heavier shiver than before.
After breakfast, John was sitting in the chair in front of Sherlock, trying to figure out the last two codes. For some reason, John sensed that they were the key to solve the case but how? He was browsing for the owners of the facilities of the hot lines, there were three of them.
Sherlock observed John's erection almost touching his navel, the tip was glossy and he couldn't help but lick it, it was tentative at first, but then he moved his hand to tamp from the base, grabbing it. John moaned when he did that, tilting his head further back in the pillow, the sound went directly to Sherlock's erection but he had other things in mind. He licked softly and then tasted, moving his tongue along his palate again. The taste was incredibly raw and it made Sherlock feel something very strong at the bottom of his belly. What was that, but just a flavour? He parted his jaw and sucked at the tip, looking for more. It was sour and salty and held a bit of vinegar too.
Sherlock's voice did things to him. It was a known fact, the breathy tone, the security that it held now was nothing compared to the two previous intimate nights. Now Sherlock was secure and, for the first time, John felt as if he could demand more from this man above him, he wasn't looking at the oddly young Sherlock now; he was looking to a secure, completely manly, grown up man.
“Okay.” John cleared his throat again. “Good.” He started to serve the food and Sherlock put the kettle on.
Sherlock read carefully the list and he recognized the plate number of the white pickup and the date they had been in the port.
Sherlock gradually lifted his face, his eyes big as dinner plates and his pupils so small he looked a bit alien. He swallowed and exhaled slowly. “What are you waiting for, John?”
Louis sighed too, his eyes darted to Sherlock for a second, the detective's profile was hidden. He was reminded once again about that time in the alley. Despite everything, Sherlock was quiet, calmed to plain view, his facade impeccable, except for his throaty voice. "Where are you going now?"
Later in the privacy of his room, he clenched his fists and teeth so hard he thought he was going to break either a finger or a tooth.
John thought for a moment about putting his arms around Sherlock, just like as Sherlock had done a couple of years back with himself. But for John, the cards weren’t over the table just yet. He wanted to ask more, like how/when/where did Sherlock get those scars? How long were they infected and why? Were all of them done by the same people? Where did that long one finish? The people who did this, were they all dead? Hell, they better be.
John frowned. He was tired, damn it, even Rosie had noticed. Massaging other people left little energy for yourself, so he thought about just denying for a couple of seconds. Why would Sherlock want to talk about this with him, of all people. He looked down, at his empty cup. He could feel Sherlock’s sharp eyes on him like a force of gravity.
Sherlock was showing the same emotions he did at the end of The Hound case. John was beginning to understand this new part of Sherlock. A time ago, Sherlock would consider a case solved as soon as he found the answer. Now, as well as the end of The Hound case, he wanted the mother to know, like when he made Henry to look at the dog's corpse, so he could have some peace of mind.
. He ran to the bathroom again and this time he followed the pattern of the sweat, bringing the magnifying glass from his trousers' pocket to his face, observing himself carefully on the mirror. The pattern wasn't obvious to a normal naked eye; it was just a change in the way the drops should have fallen normally, going from his lower lip to his jaw. He swallowed nervously. He could only imagine the way John had touched him, he felt something fast going down his belly again.
“You see, I really need a chemist in the opiates’ area. I didn’t want to open any vacancies without trying to cajole you first. If you want the stable job it’s one of the best paid in our division and I really need someone trustworthy and brutally honest to work with me. And the second,” Martin smiled and looked around but he held himself confident. “I’ve been working on this and I know body reactions pertaining drugs. If you want to change the masseur, I could help with your investigation too, from here on.”
At the Yard, in Lestrade’s office, the DI rubbed his temples with an untouched cup of coffee in front, Donovan sitting right across him, her breathing heavy from the discussion they just had.
With a smile coming just out of morality, John walked outside and stretched his back, put his jacket back on and walked to 221B. Once there he didn't go upstairs. He waited outside for Mrs. Hudson. The last time he had been there had been that same day, the same day of "The Fall" as he called it in his head and after that day, he knew he couldn't come back.
Sherlock moved his hand to Armand's arm, he wanted to be released from the embrace, but then, this could lead to another little experiment.
John supported his head on his arms folded over the lab's table. He closed his eyes, thinking about the conversation with Mycroft before. He felt useless, now he knew it was Mycroft's information leaking now but the facts were still floating around his head, not really connecting all of the points. Even though it was clear now, as Sherlock had stated as soon as he got to the lab, that they had to find the code Moriarty had left in their flat.
to let us know that you actually want to find an ideal partner, you don't want to take it lightly like most people do. You are waiting for… how do they say... Mrs. Right. Which of course, could be an issue from youth, most likely a girl, or a boy for that matter, who used the word 'love' with you, when you knew they didn't feel it... probably she... or he, even tried to get physical with you, making you actually think the way you do now about sex. Am I wrong."
"Sherlock." John heard panting at the other side of the phone, he quickly supported himself on an elbow, frowning. "What is it, everything okay?"
"What were you thinking about?" she asked, supporting her chin on her palm and smiling, she even seemed a bit flirty. Surprisingly, John didn't like that now, he even found it...
John made a little smile. "That I'm not going to leave you... leave Backer Street..." when he saw Sherlock smiling too, he added almost in a whisper "That sounded much less lamer yesterday..."
“Jes – Fine! You know what? Whatever, I don’t mind. Turn around before another click goes off. We’re already in the last half of the session.” At Sherlock’s incredulous face, John added, oddly calm, “I had to sign a fucking contract that very clearly stipulated that if I do not keep with the session lengths, products or any material in the spa, they could – and I cite –  take
John remembered that impulse to run when there was a situation of danger, but then, the bloke in the original narrative was a painter whereas he’s a soldier. He doesn’t run when there’s danger. He goes for it. He remembered how he wanted to fly from the bathroom earlier but came a step further instead, transporting him to one of the most memorable nights of his life. He thought of Sherlock panting, of his moans, of that
There was noise upstairs; a few bangs as if someone had fallen, a muffled scream and a thud and then silence. Two, three, four seconds…
She took the opportunity to plant her foot over Sherlock's chest and threw him backwards, giving herself the impulse she needed to get to the other side of the wall, but Sherlock managed to get the laptop and get back to his feet quickly, helped by Lestrade, shaking his head and making an aggrieved face.
With a slow movement, he slipped his hands down to Sherlock's shoulders and upper arms. Even in this situation, he was being careful with the healing injury there. Sherlock's breathing was heavy, puffs of air coming out from his parted lips one after another. His forehead was still pressed to John's. His hands still on John's jaw line, his shaky fingers stroking lightly below his ear. Their noses were almost touching. John tilted his head a bit and slowly closed the inches between their lips.
And now, John was gasping, alone in bed. Only with the memory of those events his body was reacting again.
John couldn't help it. He was giggling like a kid in his bed, his tiredness was long gone and you can blame Sherlock for that. He didn't turn off his phone, but he decided for silent mode again. He remained several minutes staring at the ceiling. He'd used the same word,
John snorted. “I appreciate the offer but no, I have had enough of that these past few days.” He thought for a while and then asked, “What about the products, though? I am looking for that cannabis soother, is it legal?”
The man in front didn't answer but stood up quickly, took one of the books beside the chair and opened it in a marked page. He handed it to John.
"I know. Normally when I have this kind of nightmare, I usually hear you snoring upstairs, it eases my mind a bit." John heard a deep small laugh and he couldn't help but smile.
“No. I think she perfected the formula. PIEDRA formula had the victim feverish with a stomach ache first caused by the change of the pH of the gastric acid. Now the victims are just thirsty…”
“I’m not, you berk!” John couldn’t help but give a little laugh and a headshake, “I understand close to nothing of what’s going on. What happened to… Toby? And what is that about the cameras?”
A couple of minutes passed in which Mycroft just stared at his phone and the golden wrappings. He threw them to the trash can under his desk. His mind was in pause, in a strange state of blank. He startled when his phone vibrated in his hand before emitting the message tone.
When he was about to smile again, he became conscious of his facial expression; still there was this big, goofy grin plastered to his face and he frowned. Interesting. He texted back.
"Lestrade, we're on our way now, there is nothing more to do here. I give you the lead and you follow it as usual. Do not mix family interest here, tell my brother he can stop worrying now, would you?" he said to the DI as he walked away nonchalantly, followed by a confused John.
Sherlock snorted. "Alright, but be careful not to fall asleep in there." He added casually stepping out from John's room and going downstairs to the living room.
Sherlock lifted his spoon and stopped right in front of his lips. “No, not a coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy.” Sherlock smiled that smile that reached his eyes, that teasing smile that could easily pass for flirty. It was a bit of an inside joke, whenever he repeated one of Mycroft’s slogans.
Last night John was feeling devastated. Of course, Sherlock never failed in comforting him, on his own way. Just being next to the detective was good and enough. He knew that.
His right leg suddenly hurt but he was so convinced of what he had to do that he just stepped firmly his foot on the floor, kicking the pain away. A little scene made its way into his brain, the first day he had spent with Sherlock.
John gulped, wetted his lips and inhaled; the air was retained in his lungs for a couple of seconds longer than normal before being exhaled. Sherlock's voice was a trigger in his body, he knew, his plan of keeping himself under complete control was slowly failing. Perhaps it is pertinent to mention once again he regretted enormously not attending his body needs in the shower that morning.
"I'm solving a problem. I need to find a way to lure the daughter to tell her mother and the case would be solved."
She handed Sherlock a glossy paper; it had the list of a dozen kind of different massages, the length in minutes of each at the side (what kind of massage lasts an hour and a half?) and the price at the end. Sherlock smiled and took it, scanning and committing it to memory.
. Sherlock had excellent cicatrisation. In the early days, he would cut himself and the spot had been completely healed in three to five days. That’s why, when Sherlock turned his back to John with just his T-shirt on, John braced himself for what was coming.
He was now very aware of the sensations the younger man was awakening in his body and mind, and with such simple acts; his cold fingers intertwining with his owns, or at the alley, the way their bodies touched... the way Sherlock's body reacted to his closeness. He had felt, very well, the aroused state of the detective pressed against his hip. He had felt the heat of Sherlock's lips over his palm, the hot breath over his neck, the warmth of his body and arms around him as they had hugged this morning. He could almost feel the desperate way Sherlock had wrapped his arms around him last night...
“Have you considered the possibility that she might be having sex with someone else?” Sherlock asked and then bit the inside of his lips when he saw, out the corner of his eyes, John’s eyes grow large and his jaw drop down, looking at him with obvious disapproval.
Sherlock felt when they both were close, he moved over John again, pressing their erections together and reached down, behind John's balls with his hand. John opened wide eyes and shivered in anticipation. Sherlock moved his finger on his entrance, circling, he pushed the tip of his finger inside, much like that one time. John groaned loudly as he felt the dry intrusion but he encouraged pressing Sherlock's body closer to his own with his legs. Fuck, he wanted it, he wanted it badly and Sherlock knew it.
“You’re just assisting me, Watson,” Sherlock said, serious. His voice nearly a purr and eyes still on his phone.
Soon they were kissing; Sherlock cupped John's jaw. The kiss was a slow, gently slide of tongues, John leaned over Sherlock, his hands supporting himself at the sides of the taller man's torso. Sherlock rolled them and soon the kiss grew urgent, John's room was silent except for their breathing.
Having seen it all, John touched the gun at the back of his jeans, checking it was still there even though he felt it against his skin, and walked to the bathroom where Sherlock was still looking at his phone with a frown. The bluish light made his cheekbones stand out. He looked young even though his eyes revealed lines and creases that weren’t there before and which John had been noticing far more often than usual. For some reason, John’s heart gave a little twist.
John frowned and looked down. He looked angry but Sherlock stood his ground. He knew he could blame the aphrodisiacs later, he could also apologise. It wasn’t even that terrible, was it?
“You like me being dramatic.” As soon as the words were out of his mouth he looked down and cursed internally.
Sherlock moved his head so their cheeks were touching now. It was stimulating. John felt a weird state of contentment despite his memories; it was the first time for them to talk about such matters. Even if the growing sensation in his pants told him otherwise, he wanted to hear Sherlock, he wanted to tell him everything. The feelings? A mixture between sexual arousal, friendship, unconditional love, tenderness, frustration, understanding, longing... all of that in a simple hug. And he loved it, he felt alive.
"You do have to know a couple of things, John." Sherlock's tone lowered, "we're in a new case... and confidential. You can't post this on the blog."
Sherlock finished the button John had missed and removed his shirt completely. John was being observed, and he was observing back the process of that. Sherlock still brushed his fingertips around his shoulders. He was clearly trying to deduce every scar he was seeing. He moved his hands to the doctor's upper arms. Then he pressed his elbows' bones, touched all the way down to his wrists. He ghosted his fingertips over John's hands, following with his gaze every place his hands were touching. He moved his hands then to John's abdomen, recalling what Armand said over the phone
Mycroft grabbed the front of Sherlock's coat and roughly pulled him closer for a hug. Sherlock hesitated for a couple of seconds before returning it. After a while, both brothers were holding each other for dear life. It was brief but intense, a firm grip and suddenly, without a word, they separated and rearranged their shirts, shared a last smirk and Sherlock was off, back to 221b.
John had no idea what they were doing or what kind of picture they were making. He only knew of friction and shushed moans, of Sherlock’s open mouth against his neck and nose pressing somewhere against his jaw. He also knew that all of their weight was against the door as they moved together once more. The crude thought of his penis hitting someplace close to Sherlock’s balls and the implication of the movements made him want to moan aloud. Sherlock must have thought something along those lines if the sound coming from his throat was any indication.
The bag with items was next to Abby’s feet, her right hand holding its handle and her left moving occasionally as she responded to whatever Elsie was saying. Even though the image was only the size of Sherlock’s screen, they could clearly see when Abby’s free hand opened the lid of the jar in Elsie’s hand and the liquid spilt on the floor. Abby grabbed Elsie’s shirt, kissed her again and left the house with the full bag as quietly as she had come.
