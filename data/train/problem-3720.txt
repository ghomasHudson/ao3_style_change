Dean was suddenly uncomfortable in his seat. The muscles in his back ached like they did after he’d been driving for hours. He twisted and shifted in his chair, trying to work out the tightness he suddenly felt pulling between his shoulder blades.
Something wooden dragged across the ground behind him. Slow and steady, he could hear soft footfalls accompanied by the gentle scrape of a long, heavy scythe along the stone floor.
Dean couldn’t speak – any motion involving his head sent a spike of crippling pain through his body.
“I—fuck.” Dean gritted his teeth as a new wave of pain surged up his arm. Fuck, this was a lot of blood. “I was going to – I
And Dean, already lost before he even stepped foot onto this land where nothing grew and nothing ever would again, never stood a chance. The old, empty god whispered sweet promises into Dean’s ear and wrapped its thorny, parasitic vines around his soul, and Dean wrapped his finger tight around the trigger of his gun in agreement.
“You know,” Dean held up his palms and walked his hands around an invisible wall. “The weird clowns who don’t talk?”
it!” Sam pointed the tip of the machete at Jenny, who was now rocking on the floor, sobbing and clutching her the shredded remnants of her knee.
carried out my ritual.” The Empty leaned forward with a toothy sneer, the dark of its eye sockets seeming to stare straight through Dean. “Curious. No tongue-cutting required.”
They soaked some bullets in dead man’s blood, since there was a good amount of evidence in Dad’s journal to suggest this really was a bunch of vamps who were just inexplicably extra freaky on the side. Dad had hunted down a few of the fuckers from this nest before, and decapitation worked just fine – so Dean didn’t think they needed to prepare much else. But they doused their machetes in holy water, just in case.
All Dean could do was grin and blink back the tear that threatened to fall and spoil the moment. “Yeah,” he choked out.
“Yeah they have dozens of pie shops from all over the state, there’s even a ticket for all-you-can-eat, and—“
“Where to now?” Sam asked. The drive until then had been mostly quiet, aside from Tommy mumbling out directions and Dylan fidgeting in the backseat.
Dean took the chance to duck and roll, picking a new corpse to hide behind from several feet away. He didn’t want the Empty to hone in on him just yet.
“You’re gonna have to be more specific for me, buddy. If it ain’t Orion’s Belt or one of the spoons, I’m just lookin’ at air.”
Just like this wasn’t Dean’s memory, this illusion wasn’t built for Dean either— and so it flickered and melted into what it
Dean shook his head slightly. “That’s not true.” For most of Dean's life, Bobby had been a home. A safe haven. The first person he'd felt safe to utter words to after nearly a year of silence as a child. And now, the first to hear his deepest truth spoken aloud.
Dean tuned in and out as they chatted about the ethical quandaries and challenges Jack faced. He marveled in how much Jack had grown up, but was also struck with sadness as to how fast he’d been forced to. Dean sat quietly, giving only a few nods of acknowledgement as he nursed a much nicer beer than Bobby had offered him at the celestial Roadhouse. It was a last-second decision to purchase a nicer brew – he deserved it, after all.
“Don’t listen to him, Cas!” He swore he could feel the Empty snap its hateful stare in his direction, but he didn’t risk looking.
“I mean it, Cas,” Dean said. “I don’t—“ He rolled over to face Cas, though he could just barely make out his features in the dark. “You’re practically human now.”
Dean blinked. The world didn’t seem to make sense. All signs pointed toward them being in the absolute
He took a sip, sitting sentinel at the gate toward a dark and torturous unknown. And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, he felt purpose again. He felt hope.
Dean pulled Cas in close. “You were wrong,” he whispered into the crook of Cas’s neck. “About what you thought you couldn’t have.”
Sam suddenly froze, his body pressed rigid against the seat. His gaze was fixed on the stereo, where static was rising from the speakers. Dean punched the button to switch it off, but it was no use – it was never on to begin with. Dean glanced at Sam out of the corner of his eye, and
“It’s good to have you back, kid,” Dean said, clapping a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “I’d offer you a drink but, uh,” he gestured to the six-pack he and Cas were nursing. Only beer.
Dean’s eyes widened as he saw a silver blade slide out of Jimmy’s sleeve. “You insufferable gnat,” Jimmy’s voice dripped with venom. “I’ll enjoy silencing you.”
Dean spun on his heel and sprinted, sprinted through the once-peaceful garden, pushing past a man blissfully flying a kite, his feet kicking up the ashes of burned wings as he wove through the celestial mass grave.
Dean carefully unfurled his wings, hesitantly peering out through the spaces between the tips of his feathers.
. He bit his lip in a smirk as he looked up at the man who’d raised him better than his own blood could, who’d accepted him as his own son, and he knew, here, he was safe to accept himself too. “Yeah. We do, don’t we?”
Hell, didn’t they make quite the pair. The angel who had learned to love, and the man who would never deserve it.
The grace inside the vial pooled down to the bottom of the glass, and pulled Dean’s grace down with it. He could feel it nagging in the base of his skull, the undeniable feeling he had to
Dean tilted his head forward, and though there were only a few inches between them, it felt like it took an eternity for their foreheads to touch, for their noses to brush. They hung here for a moment, their shared breaths mingling, with Dean still hesitant. Still working up the courage.
“The Old Death once promised me your soul,” It said, its voice hollow and cold. “Promised to banish you to the void so you could never resurrect. But
“I mean,” Jenny said, baring her teeth in an uncomfortable grin. “Unless you don’t mind me having a midnight snack.”
feel the Empty turn its rage on him. The concrete floor of the warehouse flickered and bubbled, the illusion around him retracting as the Empty seethed. Dean retreated, turning on his heel and sprinting through the rows of bodies, trying to loop around back toward Cas.
Cas, thankfully, didn’t intervene. He tilted his head curiously and leveled a look at Dean that Dean took as a “go ahead, but be gentle” kind of warning. Back in the bunker, the day after returning from the Empty, Dean had told Sam and Cas about his conversation with Bobby in Heaven. About how it all worked now.
“I’m not sure I have a word for this,” he said softly. He ran his hands through Cas’s hair in adoration as he wracked his brain for something that felt worthy enough describe this.
The Empty bared its endless rows of teeth inside its thousands of mouths, flexing its expanse of needles and thorns and claws. The ooze it rose from boiled with a primordial rage as it turned toward the source of the noise, a harsh and grating discord in the distance. The Empty tore toward it, rising and rolling in a tsunami of frenzied blades sharpened with hatred.
“You’re incredible,” Dean laughed, pressing his forehead to Cas’s. “But please, don’t ever call it that again.”
Dean was suddenly very glad he’d stuffed that gun into his jeans now that his machete was gone. He had a clip of seven rounds, with an extra loaded into the chamber for luck. He wasn’t the quickest draw, but he could at least cull the playing field down to a much fairer fight.
Dean yelled and sprang out of his bed, chucking the blankets as though they’d burned him. He instinctively clutched his chest, breathing hard and fixing a vacant stare at the handgun he’d left half-disassembled on his desk.
Sam didn’t have to know all of that, right? Maybe he’d leave some of that out. He’d certainly try, at least, so as not to fry the kid’s brain. But Dean’s verbal filter was tuned with the precision of a shitty gas station sink – it was either a glacially slow trickle, or way too much, way too fast. There was really no middle ground.
He heard the slow, climbing cacophonous static rising between the gnarled trees, growing louder and louder like someone had cranked a dead signal up to 10 – and this time, he knew it wasn’t the wind.
He rested his face in his hands, all the fight draining out of him. He felt like he had nothing left to give.
The thing he’d once mistaken for Cas reached toward him with a piecemeal hand made from a thousand other corpses, and it began to bleed. Blood dripped from between the hundreds of teeth protruding from its face, smeared across its hands, seeped from between all the grotesque stitches of its fleshy jacket.
Jack sat up, clutching his highlighter-pink soda and nodding solemnly. He took a deep breath as he processed it. Processed what it would mean to give up this power for good, to trade it for the freedom he’d ensured for everyone but himself.
Somewhere along the way, the story of what had happened to this farm, and what now inhabited it, were lost. There was just one unspoken knowledge passed down quietly among all those who were born here, a knowledge as intrinsic as how to blink and how to breathe.
It was buried deep in an old playlist, one he rarely heard unless he put his entire iPod on shuffle, and it was even rarer for him to listen to it in its entirety. It was upbeat in its own odd kind of way, somehow both wistful in the lyrics and bright in the tempo, but it still carried too many memories.
“My grace is waning,” he said matter-of-factly, eyes still closed. “I’m still an angel, but I seem to have human needs. Not unlike you.”
Dean coughed both from the impact and from the shroud of dust that billowed up around him. The vampire descended down on top of him, ferocity lining her every feature. She pressed her forearm down on Dean’s throat, pinning him to the ground and cutting his breath short. The vampire grabbed his face under his chin, digging her nails into his cheek and forcing him to look at her. “Remember me, Winchester?” she snarled.
Dean’s fist closed around the metal object in his pocket. He yanked it out, flicked the switch, and shined the flashlight’s bright UV bulb right in Jenny’s face.
“I’ll be fine,” Dean had promised, though he only half-believed it himself. He finally had a purpose again – and he knew if this didn’t work, that it was over: over for him, over for Cas. There was no other way, and he couldn’t keep on like this. Dean knew that for certain; losing this battle would break him. It was a surety set deep in the marrow of his bones.
, his disjointed thoughts offered as they scrambled to make sense of the world around him. That was odd, he wondered. He wasn’t expecting anyone.
“I—" Dean started. And where a defense would usually force its way out of Dean’s lips came a breathy sigh of acknowledgement.
He stretched out his other wing, testing the movement, flaring them out to the side, then up, furling and unfurling them separately at first, then together. He marveled at the way the feathers folded and splayed with the movement, the way they ruffled in the breeze and glimmered in the sunlight. They were stunning. He distantly wondered what Cas’s wings had looked like before he’d fallen, and now deeply regretted not getting the chance to see them. He was sure even his wings, as sleek and beautiful as they were, wouldn’t hold a candle to Cas’s.
The air in late November in the Midwest should be crisp and sharp and fresh – but here, in this long-forgotten pocket off the edge of a deteriorating highway, the air hung heavy and stale. In the distance, he could hear the slow, climbing static of wind rustling through the trees, though it didn’t occur to him that there was no breeze at all, no hinted breath of any movement, no source for the noise.
A hesitant hand reached up and pressed against Dean’s chest. Dean pulled back just enough to see that Cas was staring at him in disbelief. They paused there, somehow both out of time and suspended in an endless moment together, Cas’s hand splayed over Dean’s heart for several beats.
Deep down, Dean hoped his reaper would guide him to the Empty like Billie had promised. After what he’d done – his inaction and avoidance leading to Cas’ sacrifice, and now his own self-destructive grief leading to Sam’s pain – he figured he deserved an eternity of torture at the claws of the entity he’d just royally pissed off.
“Your mom lives down the road,” he finally said, lifting the bottle to half-point out at the gravel.
Dean didn’t fight him on that. It didn’t feel right to reward himself while two kids were still missing. And honestly, Dean hadn’t wanted to break away from the case. He’d been burying himself in it, focusing only on the task at hand, and it was a welcome reprieve from all the intrusive thoughts that flooded in during downtime.
“So what, that’s it?” He didn’t feel very different than he had before, though it was hard to tell considering a few moments ago he was wracked with excruciating pain. His baseline was skewed; his nerves hadn’t quite calmed down just yet.
Dean shouted in surprise. Sharp barbs punctured his skin, and he could feel the sear of blisters bubbling up from around the wound. Vines of darkness he couldn’t see tangled around his wings.
It was the same gun he’d carried for at least a decade, always keeping him and Sam safe on their hunts. And yet, the second he’d turned it onto his brother, it backfired – and destroyed itself instead. Dean dropped to his knees next to the wreckage of his gun and clutched his shredded hand to his chest.
“I’m so sorry he did this to you,” Dean cooed to the Impala, pressing his cheek to her roof. “Never again.”
Bobby didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. He turned back to the Roadhouse, taking the few short steps back to his patio chair and his cooler of endless crap beer. He heard a rustle of feathers, the flap of wings, and by the time he turned around, Dean was gone.
Every one of his nerves screamed to be able to cradle this soul to his chest and convince it that it deserved the world. Castiel had walked the earth since the dawn of time, since the Sahara was flooded and teeming with life, since the first fish defied the natural order and dragged itself out of the ocean, risking death in search of some freedom greater than itself. He’d seen the first moments of creation and death, bore witness to the birth of joy and betrayal. He’d observed countless stories of love and loss through the eternal tides of time and yet – nothing compared to this.
Now it was Dean’s turn to flinch. “Dammit, Cas,” he growled, feeling the words like a punch to the gut.
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay,” Dean mumbled, the reassuring words just tumbling out of his mouth after an entire childhood, an entire lifetime of practice. The man who’d been trained to be a killer, whose every nerve had been broken and reshaped in the art of taking a life, had words of comfort arise as his deepest instinct. He reached out his hand, palm up, unthreatening into the stall. The two boys recoiled, the older one curling protectively around his brother – an act that sat all too familiar with Dean.
It was a sigil an endless number of corpses forged in his image now bore. Each one burned exponentially brighter, building into a blinding light that tore holes into the Empty’s very darkness. An agonizing scream ripped from the Empty as the light grew white-hot, searing into Dean’s eyes. Dean clenched his jaw and squeezed his eyes shut as every muscle in his body tensed around Cas, the heat of the sigil’s activation burning around them as though they were in the very pits of an inferno. Dean felt the fire of the banishing sigil course through his body, singeing his feathers, burning into his palms.
had been snuffed out, through luck, no less – the waking angel had fallen silent, and the Empty could return to its preferred stasis of silence.
, his mind overenunciated, tasting the word as though it were an interesting new food, full of nuance and odd flavors. He poured all of his focus into conjuring the image of his hands, but all he could see was dark.
Cas was sitting rigid in the chair, all his muscles tensed as if he were frozen between fight or flight. He didn’t seem to notice Dean. Instead, Cas’s gaze was locked on a long, dark, needle-sharp vine that descended from the ceiling and hung just millimeters from Cas’s eye.
Just a few yards away from the entrance, Dean stiffened and threw up a hand to Sam’s chest, stopping him in his tracks.
Dean compromised with the arbitrary rules of time by making an egg and bacon sandwich since it was now after noon (though vehemently refused to call it “brunch”). He made Cas coffee, stirring in a little milk and a dash of honey.
Dean plunged his arms into the swirling, murky depths of his most damaging thoughts and let wave after wave of guilt crash over him until it dragged him under. He was hit by a fear of disappointing a father figure he no longer respected, struck by every time he’d let Sam get hurt, tumbled through the undertow of losing Cas over and over, every time more and more his fault. A riptide of a thousand hands of those he’d failed – failed to help, failed to make proud, failed to save – grappled at his legs, his arms, his throat, their nails piercing his skin like fishhooks until one finally clasped over his mouth.
He knew this wasn’t Cas. But if something was possessing him, or if it really was Cas calling out to him, he’d never forgive himself for standing by once again and letting the angel die. With a surge of resolve, Dean gripped the doorknob, which was fuzzed with moss and mold.
Dean shrugged, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips. He leaned in and brushed his nose against Cas’s temple before laying a gentle kiss just above his ear. “I don’t know,” he said, pulling back to watch the colors dance off of Cas's face as the sun dipped low beneath the water. “I figured we could make it up as we go.”
“I said, drop it.” Dean’s voice was steady, but he felt entirely unhinged. His heart threw itself against his ribs and he could hear every beat reverberate in the static in his ears. A static that seemed incredibly pleased he was threatening to take his own brother’s life, to destroy the only family he had left, to sever his oldest tie and send that sacrificial blood pouring into the desolate, drought-cracked earth.
“D-Dean,” Cas stammered, sputtering and coughing through a mouthful of oil. The hand on his shoulder gripped him tighter, and Cas’s pupils blew wide with fear. “
That’s the world the Empty inhabited. Its consciousness webbed through all the minute spaces, a fungal hypha weaving through the forgotten expanse, a mycorrhizal network festering in the wounds of the in-between. An incomprehensibly vast biome branching into a single consciousness.
It spoke no words, for it had no mouth to speak from in this realm – but Dean’s eardrums pounded with the reverberations of a sound at a frequency he could not hear, but knew was a scream. He wrestled in its grasp, desperation rising in his throat. With one, pained and defiant scream of his own, something sharp slid down his forearm.
” Dean barely recognized his own voice, as the name ripped from his chest with a sob sown with desperation. “Cas, are you in there?”
“His angel blade is already hidden,” Cas said, squinting, as the joke soared over his head. It was no wonder his hair was so ruffled.
Hell, Sam hadn’t heard Jason Manns’ voice drift out of that old iPod in more than a decade. Not since…
He’d sown a path paved with the stones of self-loathing, and dragged Cas and Sam down with him. And he was too fucked up to even notice.
There were no voices, no lights, no high-frequency souls buzzing blindingly fluorescent. There was just … dark. Like there always had been.
Castiel was materializing into something whole once again, the pain and hurt and memory of it all stitching his physical form back together from where his consciousness had been adrift.
That’s the first scent that came into Dean’s consciousness. There was no rot, no putrid decay, no hint of humidity wafting through the air. Just the cool breeze of a late summer’s night drifting through his feathers as he laid in the grass, his wings wrapped around himself and Cas.
“Cas, listen to me,” Dean said, concern lacing his voice with an urgency he hoped would reach Cas. “We have to move,
He didn’t know how long he stood there, teetering on the edge of panic. He was half-expecting Sam to knock on his door, or for Jack to poke in and ask some inane question, or for a certain angel to make a poorly timed entrance and utter a gruff hello.
“What do you mean? Dean was possessed?” Sam studied Dean’s face for a moment, and Dean felt like Algernon in that lab. “It can’t be a demon, what about a ghost?”
“You deserve to be happy, to be free,” Dean gasped, blood soaking into his flannel as he dragged the point of his blade through his skin. He stepped forward, needing to close the gap, needing to be close to Cas again, needing to stop the Empty. He was just a few steps away now. “You showed me that. Let me show you it, too.”
Its sheer presence hiked an anxiety up Dean’s spine. It was akin to the memory of stumbling drunk and alone and vulnerable in an empty bar’s parking lot long after closing time, and hearing the sound of an approaching car slowly sliding stopping behind him – but he’d turn to see the street is dark and empty, stretching into nothing.
“The most important part is cutting out the parent’s tongue,” she nodded. “It has a thing about silence.”
“Alright, alright,” Dean waved his hand dismissively. “Do I need to fill out an application?” He snorted.
As far as he knew, he was alone in the bunker. Eileen had taken Miracle, who’d become a makeshift alert dog for her, to run backup with Claire on a ghoul hunt in Missouri. She wasn’t due back until at least tomorrow. And though she normally played her music loud like this, Jason Manns was hardly her style. Not enough bass.
Dean scrubbed his face and dug his fingernails into his scalp, silently begging his world-class ability of repression to kick in and lock this away for good.
The humid air grew thicker and thicker as they approached. The dilapidated barn loomed over Dean with a sneer, and he felt his pulse quicken with every step. The combination was making it difficult to breathe.
Dean spun, ripping the blade through the vines that trapped his wings. The grace around his neck was crying out, begging him to move forward – but he couldn’t. The Empty’s thicket of razors and teeth and blistering branches was far too dense.
The second he heard something crack, a sharp, searing pain spiked in his ribs – as though he’d cracked his
And Cas was still staring back with that same expression, that same one Dean didn’t know how to read, that made the edges of his nerves feel like he’d stuck a fork into an electrical socket. But despite the live wire of his nerves, he’d found something to ground him. Some
“An’ I could tell you all the ways you’re wrong, but I don’t got forty years to prattle on about it,” Bobby grumbled. “An’ that’d only scratch the surface. Besides,” Bobby said, stepping off the patio toward Dean. “This ain’t just a second chance for you.”
He was listening, keening to dial into the Empty’s frequency. To welcome it back in. To put it down, for everything it had stolen from him, from Cas.
Bobby’s hand fell away and he shrugged. “The Empty is an endless void. There ain’t exactly any maps for it. You’re gonna need something of Cas’s to track him down. Somethin’ significant.” He paused, trying to remember what he knew of the angel. “You got an old jacket or a tie or somethin’?”
Dean lowered the phone and took a hesitant step forward, his bare foot sinking into the damp, rotting carpet. “Cas, what’s wrong? I don’t … You’re not making any sense.”
Hearing the name spoken aloud turned Dean’s grief and fear into a defensive ferocity he didn’t realize was simmering just below the surface. He whipped around with something akin to a snarl.
one of them carry with them on hunts for precisely this reason – and wrapped it tightly around Dean’s hand. Luckily, he didn’t lose any fingers – but this was gonna be a bitch to heal.
“Don’t,” he said, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath to ground himself. “We’re gonna end this. And then you’re gonna get me that pie you promised, alright?”
Jack’s shoulders dropped with relief. He turned to Cas, brimming with excitement. “The system works!”
He froze. An urgent, rough whisper arrowed through his thoughts, piercing through his frustration and panic.
The air around it fuzzed in tune with the static they heard. Not-Cas halted in the weak pools of light given off by the Impala’s headlights. The static grew louder, and louder, Jenny breaking her ties and clamping her hands over her ears and whimpering, Dean revving the Impala’s engine in panic. But it was no use, Baby wouldn’t move, her tires screeched in a futile spin in the thickening glaze that now churned like deep sludge onto the pavement. Smoke rose from her tires, and the smell of burning rubber mingled with the stench of the Thing’s putrid rot.
Sam’s scowl quickly fell into a smile as he breathed a small laugh. “It’s good to have you back, man. Both of you.”
Dean curled his injured hand into a fist, sinking his own nails into the wound, and could feel the Empty hiss and recoil, just for a second.
“But it’s getting late, and Dean no offense but you look like shit,” Sam said. “You should get some sleep— wait, do you sleep?”
Dean floored it. And this time, Baby’s tires found purchase. The car tore forward, ramming into Not-Cas with enough force to shatter its spine. Dean heard the crunching and snapping of bones as The Empty buckled forward over the hood, its fingers smearing dark pus across the Impala’s glossy finish.
Like the road that led to it, nature was trying to reclaim this barn; the building wasn’t going down easily, but nature was patient. It would outlast every futile attempt to fight against it – it just had to wait.
,” the word sounded like acid on its tongue, “is gripping to the headstone Billie left for you like an insolent little insect yearning for a flame.” Its voice dropped low, threatening. “I didn’t come here to feed. I came here to break you. To crush your soul into the stardust it came from and scatter it into nothing.
Sam tapped the pen against the Impala, and it took every ounce of Dean’s self-control to not snatch it out of his hand.
The impossibly wide grin fell from the thing’s face, its jaw falling slack, and its eyes snapped open.
The soul’s light flared like one last, stuttering breath, one last act of defiance, before being extinguished along with the exhale.
And somewhere along the way, Dean’s months of running away from the nightmarish echo of the Empty, had turned into him running toward something better.
“Jimmy,” Cas said, his voice low and rasping with pain. With regret. “What happened to you, what happened to Claire—“
The words felt wrong in his mouth – it was an old ending he’d convinced himself was written for him long ago. Somehow, despite how much he yearned to escape the brutality of this life he was forced to live, telling himself he knew how he was going to die was comforting. It felt like he could control at least one thing.
“Dean.” Cas stiffened in Dean’s grip. There was a shuffling, a small sound echoing hundreds of times over, bouncing off the cavernous walls of the warehouse and rolling into something much louder. Cas took an instinctive step back, throwing a protective arm in front of Dean’s chest.
Dean followed the vine with his eyes, glancing up to the source. Thick, oozing tendrils of darkness coiled around the rafters, slowly winding down the pillars and toward the multitude of dead bodies. Toward Cas. The vines throbbed, swelling and compressing as though they were alive. As though they were all breathing in unison.
Sam backtracked. “I mean, how did he summon the Empty? I must’ve read Rowena’s grimoire and the Angel Tablet a thousand times and I’ve never seen any spell that would do that.”
The breath Dean hadn’t realized he was holding gushed out of him. He hunched over, pressing the mouth of the bottle to his forehead and squeezing his eyes shut. He felt Bobby clasp a hand on his shoulder briefly while he collected himself.
And then it hit him like a ton of bricks. Reality came rushing back, like it always did – and this time, it carried the weight of immeasurable loss. A grief that damn near pinned him to the mattress. Dean’s shoulders suddenly felt far too heavy to be in any position but lying down, and he sank back down and squeezed his eyes shut.
By May, Dean visited the bunker less and less. He’d stopped in for a few days for Sam’s birthday before heading back out to go visit Jody and Donna up north. They’d celebrated Sam’s big day, Dean grabbing Eileen’s wrist and pointing to the ring on her finger as she handed him a slice of cake. He’d laughed as they told the story of Sam nearly botching the proposal and dropping the ring down the sink, while Eileen said “yes” with a wry smile and signing “fuck you” for old time’s sake before they’d kissed.
“I’m lettin’ you say goodbye,” he said, as Dean slowly took the pen and paper out of his hand. “Make it count.”
The thing pretending to be a stand-in for Cas was just raw and rotting flesh packed together into the shape of a man. Its trench coat was just skin,
“Don’t be shy.” Something akin to a laugh gurgled in the back of the throat of the Thing That Wasn’t Cas.
“That’s alright,” Cas shrugged, far too casual for the next thing he was about to say. The bomb he was about to drop and simply stroll away from without looking over his shoulder. “I was planning on sleeping in Dean’s bed.”
this chapter lowkey tried to kick my ass. i'll get my revenge in the next chapter, which will finally have some soft moments, don't worry! i won't torture our boys for much longer <3
Dean stood and spun slowly around, coming face to face with seven monsters in in skull-clown masks. They were wildly outnumbered.
” Dean snapped his fingers in front of Cas’s unblinking eye, the one that didn’t have a sharp needle in front of it waiting to strike. Cas said nothing. “Please, buddy.”
“You’re back,” Dean said, grinning. He stood and pulled the kid into a hug. “How’s everything, uh, y’know, with the other channels?”
One word, one promise, and the last of Dean’s tension began to ebb away. He closed his eyes as Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair and leaned into the touch.
“How many times are you going to make me do this before you’re satisfied?” He snarled. “Is 1,746 not enough for you? If you think one more will tip the scale, maybe it’s
And as Dean pulled away from that goddamned barn, he swore he could see black vines pushing through the wooden planks and winding up the doorframe out of the corner of his eye. But when he glanced into the rearview mirror, there was nothing but night.
“We last put it back to sleep a little over a year ago,” she went on. “We were supposed to have more time, but we didn’t. I started seeing Kate again, the others saw their own demons, and we panicked. Accidentally picked a family with two kids. The mom got away and we snatched the two kids instead, thinking that would work. But it didn’t.”
“I’m fine,” Dean said, shrugging Sam’s hand away. “I just—I’m gonna go eat in my room. I gotta finish putting the Ruger back together.” Dean scooped up a plate and nearly bolted out of the room before Sam could argue, Bud hot on his heels.
Dean stooped and set down his machete. The two kids watched cautiously as Dean kicked the blade far away, the machete skidding across the ground in a spray of dust. He held up his palms to show he meant no harm. Sam backed off, unwilling to drop his blade, and looked around for the vamps. After all, this
“I didn’t start seeing her outside of my dreams until I got to Canton. And at first, I thought it really was Kate,” Jenny said. “It sounded exactly like her, and saying things only she would know. But everything about her was just …
The angel was facing away from him, clad in that unmistakable trench coat. His shoulders were slumped, defeated, as he stared at…
“I have an idea I believe you’ll enjoy more,” Cas said, his voice dropping low. And with a nip to Dean’s throat and a hand tangled in his feathers, Dean moaned and melted into the touch.
Dean knew this was a possibility. That the plan to banish the Empty by drawing it completely into himself and dying to slingshot it away from the mortal plane was reckless; made even more so by the fact they didn’t have enough serum left to stop his heart on its own. Jenny had to weaken him for it to work. But it worked a little too well.
Dean jolted up with a start. He scrambled to get his bearings, and it took a minute for him to realize he was folded into the passenger seat of the Impala. He glanced frantically at his hands. No blisters. Just a nightmare.
Dean shrugged on a flannel he’d pulled out of what he thought was probably the “kinda clean” pile (but it passed the sniff test so it didn’t really matter where it came from) and a pair of jeans he’d half-kicked under the bed.
Dean hadn’t expected the script to flip so suddenly. To go from undeserving knight in borrowed armor to a goddamn damsel in distress, but he didn’t let his anxious pride pull him away. This time, he let himself be held.
“It wasn’t long after Kate died,” she continued. “Luther was super broken up about it. The two of them had been together a really long time, I guess. He was desperate to bring her back. Like, really desperate. It was scaring some of the nest, people were talking about leaving and then…” Jenny trailed off, her voice wavering. “I saw her. In my dreams.”
, Sam! Look!” He grabbed a fistful of Sam’s jacket and yanked him forward, pointing. He could feel his frustration curling down his arm and into his fingertips, tightening his grip. Dean could hear his own heartbeat now, every rhythmic pump of blood echoing in his ears and pounding in his jaw.
before you read this chapter, please just remember that -- without me spoiling anything -- this was tagged as having a happy ending. i didn't lie. that hasn't changed.
“I know what you mean,” Jenny piped up from the backseat. Sam and Dean both jumped, for a brief moment forgetting she was even back there until she spoke. “It did the same thing to me.”
Dean sat up and reached for his phone, squinting as the sudden brightness of his screen stung the back of his eyes.
The vampire reveled in the way Dean scrabbled at her grip, sputtering and desperate for air. “Well?” she asked, leaning in closer. Her lower jaw quivered and clicked her fangs together as she drank in the scent of his fear. She took a long breath, and an envious rage unfurled deep in Dean’s chest. “Do you?”
Maybe it was the fact he hadn’t gone on a hunt like this for a while. Maybe it was the way the briars and underbrush reached thick, dark vines like fingers of an outstretched hand toward the road, toward their tires. Maybe it was the quiet, lingering voice in the back of his head mocking him for not being as good as he thought he was now that God’s storyline wasn’t on his side.
The pen ran out on the last word, and Dean knew his time was up. He folded up the note and tucked it into Sam’s jacket pocket just as his brother stood and lifted Dean’s dead body into his arms.
Sam opened his mouth to object, but thought better of it. He eased the Impala onto the shoulder and shifted into park.
Dean had been wary about going somewhere so sprawling and dark, without any source of light – it reminded him too much of the dark of the Empty. Anything that seemed endless and devoid of life still made fear twine around every one of his nerves. He gripped the steering wheel tight, Baby’s engine rumbling as she idled, waiting for Dean to work up the courage to shut her headlights off and plunge them into the dark.
The Empty seemed to be coming after him for revenge, not realizing the very same motivation now coursed through Dean’s blood. If he could do one thing worthwhile in his life, he thought, it’d be flipping the script.
“Clearly.” A small, tired smile tugged at Cas’s lips. Cas had drifted through a timeless eternity of horrors and, despite sitting in a room littered with a thousand corpses of his regrets, Dean’s smile was infectious.
“I think I’ve got something,” Sam said as Dean stepped into the library. He’d been squinting at his laptop for a few days now, desperately searching the feeds to find something to get Dean out of the bunker.
!” Dean spat through a mouthful of blood. He fell to his knees, clutching his own jaw as an agonizing heat pulsed beneath his skin. He struggled to control his breathing, taking in deep breaths through his nose to get a grip on the pain.
Dean watched as Sam rocked back and forth on his heels and tapped his fingers against his thumb in thought.
“Then we have to pull him out,” Dean said, feeling the most alive he’d had in months. Years, maybe. The anger and self-doubt in his veins was overrun as his heart began to beat pure determination and resolve. He coaxed the Impala onto the sunken, long-neglected road toward the barn. “And we’re gonna make this son of a bitch think it’s got home field advantage.”
Just before he could lay a hand on Cas’s shoulder, the grace in the vial around his neck suddenly burned white-hot on its chain. Dean winced and stuttered backward, pawing at his chest to stop the pain—and that’s when Cas turned around.
, he pleaded in his mind. His other hand was still sunk deep into something rotting, and the now all-too-familiar reek of decay stung his nostrils.
The vial didn’t answer, of course. But with one deep breath – one that stung of copper and rot – he squeezed his eyes shut, flared his wings and plunged down into the murky depths of blood.
He needed to stop thinking about this so hard – and whatever Cas was doing here, running the pads of his fingers down his wings, pressing them ever so slightly between his feathers, was doing just that. Dean leaned into the sensation, letting the touch muffle his panicking thoughts. Dean slid his hand around to the back of Cas’s head, running his fingers through Cas’s dark hair, and finally closed the gap between them.
The darkness poured down from where it had pooled itself in the rafters, a steady stream of black ooze slowly taking shape as it touched the ground. And out of the viscous, oily black – a shade so dark it swallowed any shred of light that came near it – stepped the visage of a man that cut Cas to the core. Cas flinched, stumbling back until he collided with Dean.
“Hey,” Dean waved through the window. The little boy nearly jumped out of his skin, but instantly relaxed when he recognized Dean. Dean walked around the Impala and slid into the driver’s seat. “Good job keeping your brother safe,” he said, nodding at where the other boy was sprawled out, still asleep.
Sam figured he’d cover his bases for whatever it was. He grabbed what he could from the kitchen to arm himself – a cast iron pan, a pocketful of salt packets from the drive-in theater, and a flask of what he hoped was holy water and not whiskey – and stepped tentatively into the hallway.
“That’s alright!” Jack said, and with a snap, a bottle of bright pink strawberry soda appeared in his hand. “I brought my own.”
Dean bit back a shout. The greeting poured out of Cas’s mouth thick and heavy, like he’d spoken it through a mouthful of oil.
Dean nodded. He was pretty sure he was still human-adjacent. At least, he felt like he was. Sleep sounded
But he’d had more family who’d died, who’d hopefully gone to Heaven. Dean chewed the inside of his lip. A question pressed heavy on his shoulders. Bobby watched him carefully.
Bud barked. Case closed. Dean threw up his hands in a shrug at Sam, who rolled his eyes and turned backed to the stove.
“I don’t know exactly,” Jenny said. “But in all of my dreams, it seemed to lure me to Ohio. Specifically to that barn. Like it wanted me there. I think it can only show itself in person near here for some reason.”
He gripped Cas tight as the world rippled and wavered around them, and with one final powerful beat of his wings, a single triumphant phrase reverberated across every wavelength of angel radio before everything went dark once more.
. Death themself had come for him. He should’ve expected that. He was VIP after all. A bitter honor, but one he’d graciously accept.
With one final slash, Dean burst free, and with an urgent and broken whisper, apologized to the vial.
bones, just not his. Dean slipped, falling flat on his ass in what felt like wet grass, but he knew was anything but. He made the mistake of glancing down at his hands and confirmed what he already knew was true.
And there it was. The question Dean had been half-hoping for, and half-dreading at the same time. And it was one he realized he had no idea how to answer.
Sam just jutted out his chin and gave Dean a haughty look, unconvinced Dean could’ve done any better.
Dean suppressed a snicker as he pressed a kiss to Cas’s temple. “I’ve got a better way to shut you up,” Dean mumbled into Cas’s hair, his voice dropping low.
Dean gripped Cas’s arm, and with only a brief moment of hesitation, brushed his fingers down Cas’s sleeve until his hand found Cas’s. He laced his fingers in between Cas’s and squeezed. “He’s not real,” Dean leaned forward to murmur in Cas’s ear. “That’s not Jimmy.”
“Mmh. Too early,” Cas protested, but loosened his grip just enough for Dean to tilt his phone screen up.
“It like … oozes,” she said. “Like oil. Right before it shows up you just see … black. And wet.” She scrunched up her face. “And the
“Yup, nothin’ matters without an expiration date. You spend a few decades, hell, maybe a few hundred years with your loved ones, but after that?” He shrugged. “Ain’t no point to much up here.”
it. The heaviness of the Empty pulsed from within every rusted nail inside the barn, and every eye burnt into the wooden beams turned its petrified glare upon him. He could sense it whispering beneath his footsteps in the dust, slipping through the spaces of his exhales, winding and writhing into his thoughts with every aching breath.
Dean’s heart sank. His vision swam, but it had nothing to do with a loss of blood. He didn’t ask who the hell she was talking about – it didn’t matter. It wasn’t Cas, it never was, Cas was gone.
That is, until something shuffled in one of the stalls. Dean’s hand instantly fell to the handle of his machete. He jolted up just as Sam whirled on his heel to face the stall door.
“A crude name for my vastness,” It said, tilting its head piteously in Sam’s direction. “But I wouldn’t expect such simple creatures to be able to fully comprehend what I am. So that’ll have to do.”
Something wild glinted in Dean’s eyes. He rose to his feet, this time turning the barrel of the gun on his brother.
And for once, in the stolen spaces between breathless kisses, in all the empty pockets of discarded clothing and ruffled feathers, there lurked nothing ominous. Instead, they let themselves reach past the in-between, past its terrifying uncertainties, and when they reached with clasped hands into the depths of the unknown, they only found faith in each other.
The air became suffocating, weighed down with rot and decay. Dean could feel it gathering in his lungs and pressing down on his shoulders, trying to force him to his knees. The sludge had started to pool around the desolate, cracked ground of the barn, and Dean knew it would eventually spread to where they were standing. It felt inevitable.
for a way back to Cas. “Chuck controlled everything, he pulled every string, except for you. You didn’t just invent free will, Cas. You
The vamps stood there in a semi-circle, watching them. None of them moved to follow the kids. Really, none of them moved at all. Honestly, it was terrifying. But Dean knew a surefire way to deal with his fear: bury it.
“Mmm, I wouldn’t be so sure,” Jenny offered. “It may have let you go for now, but it’ll come back. It always does.”
Dark forces have a way of controlling the mechanics of flesh and blood and bone, but their reach does not extend to the deadly forces forged by human hands. And a lot can go wrong with homemade bullets, crudely crafted by hands shaky with the fog of alcohol, and a mind too grief-stricken to notice it’d poured far too much powder into the cartridge.
They poked around one of the tourist trap shops in Buffalo so Dean could pick up some gifts for their visit. Some maple syrup and lavender for the adults, a small stuffed black bear for Little Cas, and a stuffed moose for Sam (the kid had some big shoes to grow into). He snatched up a postcard to send to Big Sammy back in Kansas for good measure.
Dean wanted nothing else than to tell Cas it was okay. That he didn’t blame him for this, that he knew this wasn’t him, that he knew he’d never hurt Dean on purpose. Dean wanted to chip away at all the regret that strung this memory up in Cas’s head until it finally snapped free and tumbled out of his consciousness forever. Fuck it, he wanted to
“Huh,” Sam said, finally letting go of the bookshelf. He surveyed the state of disarray the library was in, with dozens of books strewn across the floor, as if he were seeing the mess for the first time. “You couldn’t have proven you were an angel in a less … dramatic way?”
He heard the faint splash of the thing clambering after him, but it couldn’t sink into a different plane like Dean could. For the first time, Dean was grateful for his wings.
It was too late for Sam to stop – he was in mid-swing, the machete blade just inches from severing Dean’s only real connection to Cas for good.
He could feel it toying with him. The Empty dangled Dean’s soul in front of Castiel like an anglerfish, drawing his delicious anguish up to the surface only to sink its parasitic teeth in and take its fill.
He swung open the door and almost tripped over a scruffy yellow dog that’d been curled up right outside.
“What is?” Sam asked. He didn’t turn around, instead focusing on getting Dean’s hand to stop bleeding. Sam pulled a roll of gauze out of his pocket – something Jody had
“You know,” the stolen voice of Cas drifted out from somewhere behind him. Dean spun around on his knees, eyes searching. But there was only darkness.
The next morning came all too quickly. Most nights for Dean were a few fitful minutes of sleep at a time, spaced out by even longer periods of uneasy wakefulness. Some nights, he’d give up on lying there in the dark, getting up to take apart and clean his gun just to give him something mechanical to do to distract him from his nightmares.
She shoved his head into the concrete. Dean’s vision swam. His head ached and his lungs burned, and the ringing in his ears started to sound a lot like radio static. He could feel his hand in his pocket, could feel the cool metal of something he was reaching for – something he couldn’t quite remember now.
It took all of Castiel’s waning strength to grit his teeth and hold on to the flickering light. He dug the tips of his fingers into the soul –
The thought sparked a shiver of rage through the Empty. The damp pool of black oil he’d been standing in churned into a thick, angry mud, roiling and pulling him down and away from the ball of light. The briars turned into a thousand claws that raked down Castiel’s body, shredding his skin and spilling a blood that carried no more secrets.
That was the last time Dean had let himself even entertain the idea of a relationship. Dean knew he’d loved Lisa, but she was his only baseline. And this thing with Cas – whatever it was – felt so incredibly different. So much more intense.
“You— Dean— wh-what,” Sam stammered, the gears of his thoughts audibly grinding as they tried to remember the rules of syntax. “Y-you two… Good for— I mean, it’s about ti—“
, the static seemed to say. Its intention came more as a feeling, an innate knowledge, than as words.
Dean squeezed Cas’s hand back, took a steadying breath, and killed the engine. But where the Impala’s lights went dead, the field itself came alive with a light of its own, as thousands of fireflies danced through the wild grass in a hopeful search for love.
The Impala roared into life under his hand – Baby was gonna be a bitch and a half to drive one-handed, but he’d made do before – and he (awkwardly) shifted her into drive.
“I can’t imagine this would be a regret of mine,” Cas said softly. There was still some hesitancy in his voice, a minor inflection that would’ve been easily missed by anyone but Dean. They hadn’t quite cleared up what exactly
Jack laid back between them on the stony ledge overlooking the river, and sighed as he stared up at the darkening sky. “This is harder than I thought.” He rested the bottle of his strawberry soda on his chest and spun it as he fidgeted in thought. “I thought by fixing all those worlds … I’d know what I was doing.” He turned his head to look up at Dean. “Like you.”
The vampire’s head tipped back and tore free, tumbling to the floor with a heavy thud and sending a spray of blood through the air.
Dean shuddered and doubled over as the burning between his shoulder blades turned to an inferno beneath his skin. Just when he thought the fire would consume him, he flexed his shoulders and a thunderous
“I’m not goin’ anywhere, sweets,” the pet name surprising Dean with how easily it slipped off his tongue. “Just checking the time.”
Dean’s spiraling train of thought immediately derailed the second he felt Cas’s hand press against his cheek. “I would do it all again, for you,” Cas whispered. “I’ll always have you.”
soul – and choked out the only word he could muster, hoping his urgent warning would somehow worm its way into Dean’s consciousness.
Dean groaned, tipping forward out of his chair and landing hard on his knees on the wood. He barely felt the impact. Every nerve in his body was thrumming, vibrating so loud, Dean pressed his palms against his temples as if to try and shut them out.
He stood in the doorway, relishing in the gust of fresh air that wasn’t heavy with whatever the fuck was going on in the motel room. He’d been through this before, he thought. After he’d made it out of Purgatory without Cas. He’d started seeing things, hearing things, things that weren’t there. He’d chalked it up to guilt and loss – and this time seemed no different.
“Hate to interrupt what seems like such a lovely moment,” Jenny interjected. “But aren’t there like, two traumatized kids hiding in your car or something?”
He’d swiped it off a seat of that haunted school bus back in Indiana all those years ago. It was the one good thing to come out of ever stepping foot there.
The vial around his neck hummed in tune with his thoughts, thrumming softly against his chest. He was close. He could feel it reverberating within his own grace. Dean picked his way through the bodies, breaking into a light jog. It was as fast as he could move, given there wasn’t a lot of floor space to work with. Dean didn’t quite know where he was going – as far as he could tell, this room had no doors, no windows, no hint of a way out.
“Ah, I see,” the Thing leaned forward to peer at Sam. Black pus dribbled out of the edge of its mouth and nose, and leaked from the empty sockets where Cas’ eyes should’ve been. It raised its blistered, bleeding hand to point at Dean. “The crux of your guilt is still alive.”
He flicked his wings forward, and the gust of wind from even that slight movement nearly knocked Bobby on his ass from where he stood on the steps. The wings felt powerful.
“Cas,” Dean’s chest heaved with a sob, relief rushing through every vein in his body. He brought another hand up to cradle Cas’s face – a hand that instantly blistered. Dean barely felt it.
“You’ve been gone for quite some time now,” Cas offered. “Everything you’ve done, all the changes you’ve implemented, this seems very self-sustainable.”
It was a thought he’d normally choke down. But here, at the edge of it all, his pain laid bare, the truth bubbled up in his chest not with guilt – but with power.
And there, in a carefree pocket of suburban Minnesota, high above the lifeblood of the Midwest, Dean and Cas found God.
He stretched his legs out, burying his toes in the hot late-summer sand. Sure, it was October, but fall didn’t really exist this far south in Florida outside of a handful of cool days around Thanksgiving time.
“And yet,” The Empty mused. The voice was now coming from the dark space in front of him. “None of it has been as facile as you.”
Begrudgingly, Dean let Jenny out of the trunk and – making sure her wrists were still bound – let her take the backseat. Thankfully, she’d taken the hint and kept her mouth shut while the kids were in the car.
his suggestion they bring the shurikens. They both opted for machetes instead. On a whim, Dean tucked a gun loaded with dead man’s blood-soaked bullets into his waistband.
an “up” here – but he laid his trust in Cas’s grace to guide him. This place was endless, dark and devoid of hope – and he couldn’t let go of the nagging fear that it would be so, so easy to get lost in this labyrinth of empty. He steeled himself, focusing only on
, boy?” Bobby dropped his empty bottle back into the cooler and sifted a new one out of the ice. “I’m Death now,” he said as he cracked open the beer with his scythe again. “This shit ain’t just a fancy bottle opener, y’know.”
“A-a man,” she was trying to get her voice under control. “A man in a trench coat. For Eve’s sake, did you kill an auditor?”
The boy visibly relaxed a little, his shoulders dropping. He nodded and let go of his little brother, who lurched forward and tackled Dean in a hug. Dean smiled – the first genuine one in what felt like eons – and patted the kid on the back.
Dean swayed on his feet a little – desperately needing air but struggling to breathe – and tried to focus. He pressed two fingers gingerly against his side, and in a flash of heat, the pain was gone. He straightened up, looking down disbelievingly at his hands. That angel mojo was good for something after all.
“What do we do?” Dean asked Sam, lowering his voice. He staggered to his feet. “We can’t leave her here, we can’t kill her… yet. She knows something,” Dean glanced up at Jenny, who waggled her fingers in a tauntingly gleeful wave. She wasn’t even pretending like she couldn’t hear them.
Castiel’s eyes snapped open. The soul he cradled that was brimming with light and a steely resolve to do right by a world that never would do right by it, now flickered and faded in his grasp. Thick, dark tendrils of shadowy briar slowly unfurled and reached their gnarled vines like clasping hands around the light, intent on snuffing out this stubborn match of a soul.
The slow, building static that masked itself in the background of the stereo, as the rising breeze rustling the final autumn leaves in the trees, within the folds of true silence. The static now muffled by the idling engine of the Impala until it was too late to run.
The music seemed to be coming from the library. He crept forward, cast iron pan raised to his chest, moving as quietly as years of practice had trained him for.
“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Dean muttered, skimming the pages of the weathered journal. They hadn’t cracked open the book in years, but the surviving vic – the mom whose tongue was cut out – had given the cops a drawing of the masks the monsters were wearing.
The scars of this land bore all the hallmarks of what a farm shouldn’t be. Of one that ended more life than it grew; of one that spilled more blood into the ground than it did water, and sowed its fields with gristle and bone.
“Let’s see. It’s dark, creepy, and looks like something straight out of Wes Craven’s erotic fantasy? Yeah, it’s a hundred percent the place.” Dean shrugged off the uneasiness, rolling his shoulders and feeling the weight of his jacket ground him in the moment.
“Yeah,” Bobby said, a small half-smile betraying how much he knew. “I reckon that’ll work just fine.”
bones. He cried out in pain, wrenching his eyes shut and clasping a damp, filthy hand around his side.
“That tracks,” Sam hummed in agreement. “Or maybe,” he shot a hopeful glance at Dean, “maybe it still can’t sleep. Maybe Cas is still fighting. Maybe he’s awake.”
Cas handed him a napkin, though Dean wiped his hands on his jeans anyway. “You run across a vamp named Jenny?” he’d asked, off-handedly.
“This one,” Cas said. He laced his fingers in between Dean’s and lifted Dean’s hand in his. He pointed at one star, and traced their hands along the constellation’s length, across the sky, then doubling back and down. “Aquila.”
Cas’s skin hung loose on whatever this thing was, like a suit three sizes too large. The hand on Dean’s shoulder was speckled with gaping sores that oozed a viscous black liquid, and smeared a dark, damp handprint into Dean’s shirt.
Dean leaned over and dropped a kiss to the hand-shaped scar on Cas’s shoulder, distracting him just enough to swipe a forkful of his pie.
An answer formed in Dean’s throat, a word he gasped and stammered to get out. “G-j… e…” She backed her arm off enough for him to speak, and the air – the thick, humid, reeks-of-decay air – came rushing back into Dean’s lungs.
Dean kept one hand on the vampire’s arm at his neck, and walked the fingers of his free hand slowly down to his pocket. The vampire didn’t seem to notice.
“I thought you said you weren’t gonna ‘let me die,’” Dean said. “Besides. I already won the ‘be Death for a day’ raffle prize once. I’ll pass.”
The Empty looked startlingly like Cas, which only twisted the knife deeper into Dean’s chest. There was only one, grounding, gruesome difference: where Cas’s brilliant soulful blue eyes should’ve been was nothing but empty sockets.
The vampire screamed and recoiled, leaping off of Dean like she’d been burned. She threw her hands over her eyes, and shuffled backward. Dean scrambled to his feet, keeping the light squarely on Jenny.
The kitchen fuzzed at the edges, the smell of grease making the air feel thick, too thick to breathe. He gasped and gripped the edge of the table until his knuckles turned white.
The Empty’s thousands of tendrils, smeared with blood and pocked with weeping blisters and barbed with thousands upon thousands of teeth reared up around them.
He heard Not-Jimmy snarl something else at Cas, but its words had garbled and slurred into a language he didn’t understand. But he knew that tone, that vicious, gut-wrenching tone he’d so often heard from one particular man hell-bent on cutting him down. One that had woven itself into his mind over the years. One that had grown into his own self-hating inner voice.
The sun felt warm on his face, and he closed his eyes and savored a deep breath of sweet summertime air. There was a peace here, but a fleeting one. An undeserved one. How could he rest when there was so much unfinished, so much unsaid?
“C’mon,” Dean said, helping Cas to a stand. “We gotta bolt. You wouldn’t happen to conjure up a memory of a big emergency exit door or—“
A few painful moments stretched far longer than they should have, with Sam’s jagged breaths the only thing to break the stillness.
Sam looked at him warily. “Hang on, Dean,” Sam said, keeping his voice steady as to not provoke him. “Didn’t Cas wake it up and really piss it off?”
This somehow didn’t feel like the worst thing he’d seen. Even as he scanned the room – a cavernous steel and concrete warehouse – and his eyes fell on body after body, all bloodied and lifeless Dean Winchesters laying crumpled in decomposing heaps, it didn’t bother him as much as he thought it should have.
His shout came just a second too late. Cas launched his fist at the thing’s face, clearly no longer held back by the fact that these
right. He didn’t say it, but the way Dean exhaled a breath of amazement spoke volumes to Cas anyway.
Dean felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders, one he didn’t even know had been pressing down on him.
“Kintsugi," he said, repeating what Dean had shouted to him in the Empty. "The art of repairing pottery with gold. Not broken. Beautiful," his voice dropped to a whisper. "Still beautiful.”
!” They were running out of time. Dean gritted his teeth and lifted his blade to his chest, as Jimmy lurched forward with his own blade raised toward Cas. Dean’s blade sliced easily through his own undershirt, and he held his breath as he began to carve. And not for the first time, his blood – and the blood of hundreds of bodies around him – slid down to join the blood of the Empty.
like Dean. He knew who the real Dean was, and every ounce of his trepidation had vanished. Cas’s fist connected with its jaw, and with a sickening crack, the thing crumpled at his feet.
She wasted no time in analyzing him back. The vampire hissed, baring her fangs and shoving Dean to the ground. His head snapped back, grazing the dusted concrete foundation, and he caught a glimpse of Sam wrestling with the one remaining vampire he’d yet to kill. The other one’s severed head lay a few feet away from Dean’s face, its jaw still reflexively snapping at the air as blood pooled around it.
wings. He knew the angels had them, but had only ever seen hints of what they’d left behind in shadows and scorch marks. Even when Michael had possessed him, Dean had been kept locked away in the recesses of his mind. He’d felt them, sure. But he’d never
“There are a thousand forms of those you’ve lost,” Not-Cas said. “But there is not a single one you feel deeply enough to see. Old wounds, only, too scarred for me,” it hummed, almost whimsically. “How monstrous of you.”
