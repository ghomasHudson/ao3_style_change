A thought occurred to Sherlock. Was it a special event? John’s birthday? Rosie’s? Molly’s? Greg’s? Not Mycroft’s. He squinted a bit as John paid for the cakes, and headed out with his boxes. Sherlock reached for one box, carrying it close to his chest, frowning.
John gave the sniper a look. “I don’t think they bite.”
“Lost lives can be.” John mumbled, looking up to squint into the morning haze of light.
He let out a puff of air as Jim's phone went off, then blinked as Jim started to shout. He stood, picking up his gun, glancing to John and Sherlock. He frowned as Jim snapped his phone shut, relaxing. It was dealt with. He slipped away, and de-assembled his gun and tucked it into a bag.
“Told you it was fascinating. Two war heroes, two different paths, two…conclusions, Sherlock.”Jim said, pressing his face harder against the glass. “Will John kill him? Will Sebastian kill John? Or…?” Jim looked to John as he started to speak.
The sharp sound of glass breaking caused John to pull Sherlock down away from the windows, then a stream of very colourful curses came from the doctor.
The sniper frowned as he thought about why he was there. Someone had planned this attack...that much was obvious now he looked back at it. Captured four soldiers. Two snipers, a boulder for a man, and an intelligence man. Sebastian frowned. Key players on a field of battle? Maybe...They had taken out the Captain...he would have been more useful to them in the long run...knew more. Sebastian turned his head to the door, having heard footsteps. He frowned as a key scrapped the lock somewhere down the hall and door was yanked open. It rattled and protested slightly under the force. The soldier heard the crack of a whip and a sharp cry.
John blinked, blushing a bit, then nodded. “Yeah…I’ll do my best, Sebastian.” He said.
“Yah ruined your suit.” Sebastian said, hosting the bag up on his shoulder. Jim gave him a look, glaring. Sebastian fell silent, waiting for Jim to let his seething take the better of him.
It stops on three when a black curly hair with a handsome face stands up and he said the amount loud enough to let the crowd hear.
Sherlock traces his index finger to John's thigh on the side, he is already planning on how to make John moan and scream beneath him in pleasure. A plan to see him begging for more.
Sherlock take his fingers out and John misses the sensation, he wants to be filled up again. Sherlock lined himself to John's hole then he put the head of his cock, inside first then slowly putting it whole.
"BE Patient Sherlock, and stop commenting on the slaves you are not interested," the Older said with calm, for other people think it is. Sherlock only grins when he knows that it irritated his brother more.
"You have never been with a man, not even once, that is interesting. Sailing on the sea could be months or weeks, Man has their. . . "
"John Watson," John said with determination in his tone. Sherlock let him go and let John sits properly on the seat. John look at Sherlock properly now, seeing his skin is pale and the lovely black curls, he realized that Sherlock is not thin or lanky at all. There are muscles that fit on his tall frame, now thinking on it, he really is a handsome man.
"Be Specific," The man said with irritation in his tone, knowing the slave-good-for-nothing is nervous in its voice.
Sherlock hides his smirk because it is not only John's dignity he is going to take but his virginity as well.
"We just have intercourse yesterday, there is nothing to feel embarrassed about to see each other body." He said it blunt and gently put his palm on John's shoulder.
Wincing, John closed his eyes. He wasn’t a virgin. His previous experiences, however, had been what he thought of as typical for a teenager: a quick handie from his current girlfriend after their date ended but before her curfew started. Furtive over-the-clothes frottage in the basement of the library during a free period at school. Those times with James - no. No, that wasn’t good to think about right now.
John’s hand inched under his boxers, and he made himself a promise - just tonight. He’d just think of Sherlock one more time, and then he’d put off all thoughts of sex or romance or whatever out of his mind for good.
John could admit that Sherlock was dangerous and often a bit of a prat. But he was also fun and
Sherlock took John to bed.
John cleans himself quickly in the bathroom and then brings a wet town back to Sherlock, who hasn’t moved at all. He gently wipes Sherlock’s chest and stomach and then between his legs, huffing a little with laughter as the other man grunts and turns over, blindly grabs a pillow, and pulls it to his chest.  John tosses the towel in the direction of the bathroom and walks around the hotel room, feeling decedent in his nakedness. There are too many windows, and John spends a moment hoping he won’t be seen. But then again, he thinks to himself feeling chuffed, all anyone would see is a very satisfied man. He rolls his shoulders and enjoys the gentle aches making their presence known in his body. In the following days, this soreness will serve as a reminder of what he and Sherlock just did.
He’d bring up Lestrade’s failing marriage. Yes. That always worked to sidetrack the man. He’d be cross, but not worried, and not so annoyed that he’d stop tolerating Sherlock’s presence at crime scenes.
He was dimly aware that he was alone, even though he was in the dark, and he couldn’t determine the time of day or how long he had been unconscious. His hands were bound in front of him, the rope painfully tight. He suspected he could break free of the binding when his brain started to work again, but right now he couldn’t even process what material restrained his wrists. He could only appreciate that the soft skin of his wrists was aching and raw, and he was completely alone and without data.
Without even thinking about it, John reached out and gently rested a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock became unnaturally still, like a startled horse, and then slowly his head came up. He looked at John, and John looked right back at him.
Not mine, he reminds himself. He made that very clear the first night.
Sherlock shuffled back, plucking at his clothing and frowning down at the mess. After he was sure his feet could hold him, John moved away from the wall and found his backpack. He dug into its front pocket and drew out a small pack of tissues. He handed two to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes, those strange pale eyes, were intent on his face. His eyebrows were drawn down, his full lower lip caught in his teeth. His gaze moved constantly over John’s form, as though he could tease out the solution by looking closely enough.
When John pulls away, Sherlock’s eyes are closed, and he remains frozen for a few heartbeats before his eyes languidly drift open. His gaze is piercing. His eyes are more grey and green in this lighting. They were more blue this morning. He licks his bottom lip and continues to stare at John, but there’s no expression on his face.
“I’ll just…” He trailed off, not sure what to say next, and shoved his wand back into his pocket. “I’m back to my paper.” He turned away, unable to bear Sherlock’s gaze any longer. “Try to keep the dangerous incantations to a minimum, if you don’t mind. At least for the rest of today.”
John slammed his tray down a little harder than he meant to and both girls jumped.
THUMP. THUMP. His feet slammed against the metal.
“A moment,” Sherlock said. He set down one bottle, grasped another, and with a soft “aha!” began to tap its contents into the cauldron. He held his wand high and Latin words spilled from his lips like poetry.
“What the hell, Watson?” Anderson snapped as he scrambled to his feet.
And just like that, John was overcome by the ridiculousness of the situation. Last year, if a friend had asked John where he’d be in one year, he would never - not in a thousand years - have been able to imagine this.
When he got home that evening, the flat was empty. There was a note on the fridge in his mum’s neat handwriting: “Called in for an extra shift. Leftovers in fridge”
When he opened his eyes again, the room before John was blurry with his unshed tears.
The third time Sherlock startles himself awake, John reaches over and tugs on his arm. Sherlock is too surprised to fight, and he slumps against John, his right cheek coming to rest on John’s left shoulder. John shifts a bit to relieve the pressure on his bad shoulder and glances down. Sherlock’s eyes are wide, and he’s staring up at John, but he doesn’t move.
Greg grinned. “Brilliant. Their loss is our gain.” He clapped John on the shoulder. “I’ve seen you around school. You’ve been hanging out with Mike Stamford and, uh, Molly Hooper, yeah?”
Sherlock’s laboratory moved from the kitchen to the upstairs bedroom, and while Mrs. Hudson still occasionally needed to be evacuated when a potion went awry, John felt a little better knowing that the danger was no longer directly over her head. The downstairs bedroom became their bedroom. On nights in which there wasn’t a case, they fell into bed together, sometimes with passion, sometimes with laughter.
John had never felt more useless.
Sherlock nods only once, but it’s decisive. “Okay.” He then surges forward, and his lips clash against John’s.
“Sounds lonely,” he said quietly.
“How do you know I plan to stay in London? We just moved here.”
Sherlock was studying his face, his expression filled with suspicion and a not small amount of fascination.  Finally he simply said, "I see," and he returned his gaze to his phone. John didn't miss the splotches of pink on his cheeks.
, maintained both your weapon and your mobile phone, single-handedly immobilized our imprisoners, called Lestrade for back up, and now you’ve come to …
Bevel up. Insert. Draw back on the plunger and check for blood. Perfect - he was in the vein.
Sherlock frowned, his eyes flying across John’s face, and then he sat back a little. He hummed to himself, his lips twisting. “Fine,” he finally said, and he returned his attention to his phone.
“So you’re one of the smart ones,” Greg said with a good-natured smile.  He stretched his arms over his head. “We’ll have to try and protect your skull during the season.” He turned to consider his team, scattered across the sidelines in varying degrees of rest.
John surged forward, wrapping his arms around Moriarty’s neck, pulling him close. He knew that the hex might go off then, but at least it would take Moriarity with him, he thought, and give Sherlock a chance to escape.
With their hips locked together and their breath hot in each other’s faces, John could imagine it was just the two of them on the floor. The other dancers were little more than scenery, an oscillating mass surrounding them and walling them off from the rest of the world. Strobe lights and pounding music added to the sense of unreality. Alcohol buzzing through his blood and into his brain, John felt his entire world shrink to the lithe body in his arms.
Sherlock knew that Victor liked him. He just didn’t know
Quite suddenly, Sherlock squared his shoulders and spun in place. Suddenly he was crowding into John’s space. His face was no more open, but it was so close to John’s own that John could see a small spot of brown in the right iris of Sherlock’s otherwise pale eyes.
This was the other reason John had been so drawn to the Weasley boy. Charlie had never cared if John’s magic obeyed him, only if John could stay atop his broom and beat the bludgers away. He cared about what John could
The room was covered in spells. Overlying concealment charms made it almost impossible for John to see them, but this was clearly a trap, and Sherlock had walked right into it …
John’s new ambition became finding ways to draw the taciturn boy into conversation. Sherlock was surly and silent in the morning, but if John was clever, he’d stumble upon a subject matter that perked Sherlock’s interest. In those rare instances, Sherlock would surprise John with his ability to monologue on eclectic subjects or with his salacious observations about their teachers and classmates.
nightclub, holding a boy like this.
“Yes,” he said, coughing when he noticed how dry his throat was. “Well, your spell worked. Good job, that.” He frowned, looking for the remnants of his own protective spell. It was completely gone, blinked out of existence.
“They’re tossers. They shouldn’t have touched you.”
, sure. He’s a normal, hot-blooded man. But the flirting, the tricky dance of the first date, trying to figure out if a cup of coffee is just a cup of coffee or an offer for something more - John feels exhausted just thinking about it.
“Wow,” Mike said. “I mean, you’ve been sitting with him in biology every morning, but I didn’t know you were … friends?” He said the word cautiously, as though unsure.
John didn’t want to think about James. He didn’t want to think about Chelmsford, which his brain still tried to insist was “home”, even though he knew it wasn’t anymore and would never be again.
“John.”
It feels like forever, but it’s probably only been fifteen minutes when two men maneuver a stretcher into the dank little room. John feels like he can finally take a deep breath. “Over here,” he calls. “I have a 34 year old male status post contusion to the right temple. LOC was approximately twenty minutes. One episode of vomitus, and he’s suffering from vertigo.”
Chests heaving, they remained tightly pressed together. John’s brain felt fuzzy and disconnected, and it was as though his mind was wandering somewhere outside his body. He was aware of Sherlock’s heartbeat - fast and steady - against his own, but his mind was slow as though filled with treacle.
. John thrust his hips upwards and grinned into Sherlock’s mouth as the other man’s groan reverberated through both of their chests. John reached down, finally able to put his hands on the arse he had been trying (and failing) not to stare at for months.
John thinks he would be offended by Sherlock’s poisonous tone if it weren’t for the hint of apprehension he can see in those pale eyes. Over the months, John has come to recognize that Sherlock is at his most awful when he’s feeling insecure about something, and for all of Sherlock’s posturing, John can see the doubt beneath.
Harry made a shooing motion with her hands.  “Go!”
Feeling ridiculously pleased with himself for having caused such a reaction, John asked, "So a crime spree? That's a good thing?"
A potential problem came to his mind, unbidden. He looked up at Sherlock and asked hesitantly. “Um.  Do you have…?”
But it was also a little intriguing. Why did he keep trying? What did he want?
“I … will return momentarily.”  Sherlock pushed away from the DI’s desk. The grey continued to permeate his vision, invading from the periphery.
John from a year ago, John from Chelmsford who had a mum
John would stand just out of touching distance with the other man, and Sherlock Holmes, who had once been known to be a clever wizard but not a particularly powerful one, would spin spells with magic deep and powerful, and John would close his eyes and feel that magic throb through his veins.
. Mummy had called it a holiday, but how could it be a holiday if he wasn’t allowed to do a single thing that interested him? Spending even one tedious afternoon trailing behind Mummy as she meandered through countless stores had been almost more than he could bear.
He didn’t feel his right hip or head hit the ground.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was little more than a whisper.
Sherlock studied his face and then slowly - so slowly it was almost painful - reached out, and he took John’s offered hand.
the city. It’s … a lot.”
The other boy raised his eyebrows - oh, there, that was definitely the start of a smile - and he turned suddenly. A very firm and shapely arse pushed against John’s lap, and he felt his body begin to react. He had a moment of panic, wondering if this was over the line, but then the other boy peered at him over one narrow shoulder.  He bit his lower lip and rocked against John, and the challenge was clear.
Fine, John thought. Two could play this game.
When the song changed again, the other boy abruptly stepped back. John was left bereft. He didn’t want their moment to be over.
“You always get your way, don’t you?” John asked, leaning forward and speaking almost directly into Sherlock’s lips. “Posh name, posh clothing - you’re all public school.”
Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed and his lips swollen from kissing, but he still managed to affect a haughty drawl. “I imagine they would say that I was being quite clever. They often said that about me.”
John snuck a look at Mike, but he was looking away, an uncharacteristic frown on his open, friendly face.
“Sherlock,” John whispers against Sherlock’s wet lips. “I want you so much. I’ve wanted this for a long time. But we don’t have to do anything else tonight. I need to know what you want.”
Sherlock knew he was beautiful. He had no interest in the plebian mating rituals of his classmates - not the public hand-holding in restaurants, nor the private fellatio in the dusky corners of the university. But objectively, he knew that others found him striking. He knew he turned the heads of men and women alike, and he knew that this was because of the graceful line of his neck, the set of his blue-green eyes, the sharpness of his cheekbones.
He had woken up.
Since the other men weren’t paying attention to him, John peered around the large pool area, unable to shake the feeling that he was missing something. It nagged in the back of his head, and made his eyes blur and blink, but he could feel it - he could practically
John didn’t know which of them moved first, only that their lips were soon pressed together, morning breath sour but forgotten, and he answered Sherlock’s mewling gasp with a throaty growl of his own. Sharp teeth nipped lightly at his lips, and then Sherlock’s mouth, hot and wet, moved to his chin and down his throat. John reached an arm around Sherlock’s narrow waist, and he pulled the other man on top of him. Their groins pressed together, hardness sliding against answering hardness through pajama bottoms, and John thought he could become lost under Sherlock’s roving hands, wet mouth, and lean muscle.
And now it was terrible.
Panic began to seep into his veins, but before it got too bad, his stomach rioted and he coughed up a mouthful of vomitus.
Sherlock Holmes should never make that sound, John thinks.  He finds himself running his fingers through Sherlock’s dark curls, and with both index fingers, he begins to rub circles over the parietal regions. “Come on, Sherlock,” he says, and a plaintive note enters his voice. “Will you stop fighting me?”
“JOHN!”
Sherlock raised his hand, neatly cutting John off. “Don’t.”
, not what he couldn’t.
“You should come.”
Another girl was standing beside Molly, her light brown hair pulled into a high ponytail. John had seen her around school - she was in his physics class, he thought - but he didn’t know her name.
it - and there it was.
“This is who I am.”
Sherlock was suddenly at John’s side, his graceful fingers running across John’s face. His right hand pushed hard into John’s chest as though to feel the heartbeat beneath.
John breathes deeply. He smiles and nods. He moves the blankets into a corner where no one can trip over them. He smiles reassuringly at the registrar and rolls his eyes at the charge nurse in what he hopes is a conciliatory fashion. He snags Sherlock’s raised hand, stopping him from throwing his water cup in a fit of pique when he’s told the wait for the CT scan will be another twenty minutes.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded, gesturing in a way that suggested get-on-with-it. “From Chelmsford. Moved here this summer after your parent’s divorce.”  His teeth clashed as he closed his mouth forcefully, as though stopping himself from speaking further.
But John’s blue eyes were clear and warm, and they met Sherlock’s own with such clear love that Sherlock’s breath was taken away.
“Not an unreasonable bit of logic,” Sherlock admitted. “But completely wrong, of course.  My patronus is a bee.”
With his attention on his watch, John did not see the door directly to his left open, nor did he see the hands that emerged until they had snagged the sleeve of his jacket and gave a mighty tug.  John tripped over his feet, fell sideways through the now open door, and collided with a warm body.
Sherlock, once again quiet and standoffish, froze in place from where he was half bent over his bookbag. His head turned towards John slowly, his gaze suspicious as he studied John’s face. Dark curls almost obscured his eyes. He finally said cautiously, “That’s not what people normally say.”
Sherlock is brilliant. He should never look like that, John thinks. He should never curl into himself. He should
His breath caught when he saw an email from James in his inbox.  For several long moments he sat, his cursor hovering over the ‘read’ button.  Finally he clicked delete and closed the machine.
paperwork.”
He’s pretty sure he loves everything about Sherlock.
“And if it makes you feel any better, Sherlock,” John went on, his voice now taking a conciliatory tone. “They weren’t very competent criminals.” His smile was crooked and he seemed almost embarrassed for the counterfeiters’ failures..
“You've never been the most luminous of people, John,” Sherlock said, “but as a conductor of magic, you are unbeatable.”
John’s face crumpled and Sherlock wished he knew what the expression meant. Sometimes John’s face did this when Sherlock had said something that made him sad for other people, but sometimes it meant he was sad for Sherlock. This face could make its appearance before fierce anger or before long silences in which Sherlock would rather John yelled. At least when John yelled, he told Sherlock how he felt and Sherlock didn’t have to try to figure it out from his expression.
John dropped his hand.  With that movement, Sherlock turned sharply to stare at John. His eyes flickered across John’s face, and John wondered if Sherlock was expecting something from him. He didn’t know what it could be.
“I’m John.” His voice sounded weak even to him.
Dark eyebrows rose incredulously.
to be kidding me.”
Frowning, John reached into his front pocket, in which he was surprised to discover a small slip of paper, folded over once.  He opened it cautiously and immediately recognized Sherlock’s loopy handwriting.
There is a heavy clunking noise from just outside the door, and John’s thoughts are scattered. His head jerks up and his fingers automatically still. But then Sherlock makes an unhappy sound, and without thinking about it, John continues to gently run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
“Hey,” John said, forcing himself to keep his tone light. “I’d like to see you again. Maybe I could get your number?”
Sherlock didn’t look up from his notebook, but he stopped writing. He stared intently at the pages of his notebook, his pen frozen above the paper. John made no attempt to hide the fact that he was studying Sherlock’s face as he slowly ate his sandwich.
Harry cut him off with a dramatic wave of her hand. “I’m not Mum - that’s not going to work on me.” When John opened his mouth to argue, she talked over him. “I may not be future-doctor smart like you, but I’m not
John immediately knew that he’d do anything to find out more about who this real Sherlock was.
Sherlock sighs heavily through his nose.
Over the next hour, he checked a few of his favorite websites, scrolled through the news, and finally opened his email.
“I’m not a total idiot, you know.” John crossed his arms and frowned heavily, watching Sherlock mix and measure with practiced ease.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, and it looked liked he would respond, but then he buried his nose in his chemistry book. The gesture was rude, but as John took in the slightly hunched shoulders, the way Sherlock worried his lower lip between his teeth, and the sharp movements of Sherlock’s hands as he turned the pages, John revised his earlier opinion.
“Is that a lock pick?” John asked. “Are you actually picking the lock?”
By the time Sherlock is allowed to examine the corpse, his fingers have begun to twitch and John can tell he’s seconds from coming apart at the seams.
Harry let go of him and returned to the sink, picking up the saucepan again. “I’m taking a human psych course this term.”
“Are we still studying together today?”  John asked. “Rugby starts tomorrow, so this is the last time I can come immediately after school. We’ll have to figure out a new meeting time in the future.”
John studied the angular lines of his face. “That’s lonely,” he said finally.
Sherlock continued to play with his phone. He was pulling up a website that seemed to be for a neighborhood watch. John had the impression that he was stalling before answering.
He kicked more forcefully against the door.
“Yeah, well.” John climbed onto the stool next to Sherlock. “This time you got me.”
This was club-Sherlock.
It hurt to use his voice. But he continued to call out.
“I did. I texted him before we entered the building.”
Sherlock’s face could have been carved from marble, it was so cold. His eyes, always intense and penetrating, bore into John’s with a fervency that was almost painful. John felt caught in their beam.  Deep emotions, fury and betrayal, radiated from Sherlock and slammed into John like a hammer to his chest.
John briefly considers the wisdom of his next move, decides he doesn’t care, and reaches out to scratch Sherlock’s head. His thumb comes to rest just below the collar of Sherlock’s fine shirt, and he’s momentarily surprised by how warm and smooth Sherlock’s skin is. It’s not an entirely appropriate way to touch one’s flatmate, especially when said flatmate’s scary older brother is present, but the touch works its magic. Sherlock’s violin grows silent and the man melts into his chair, eyes closing.
John felt his ears turn red. He supposed ‘friend’ wasn't the best way to describe someone he had snogged.  And with whom he had dirty danced.
John giggled, the sound high and a little hysterical, and he leaned forward. He wasn’t sure what he planned to do - maybe just rest his forehead against the forehead of the man who had rescued him. Who had fixed his psychosomatic limp. Who had given him purpose and laughter and finally a place where he felt like he belonged.
One corner of Sherlock’s lips twitch. “If it quacks like a duck, and in three continents no less…”
Sherlock stared at where their hands met, looking for so long that John began to get nervous. Then Sherlock turned his wrist so that just their fingers were touching. They weren’t quite holding hands, and it was hardly the most intimate thing the two of them had done, but John felt his heart give a mighty heave. He had to remind himself to breathe.
With a groan, John set the lab notebook aside and lay back on his bed.
John felt a smile begin to form on his lips. Sherlock had come to his game!
“It’s late,” Sherlock said, his voice still unsure. “She’ll have gone home.”
“Seriously?” John asked him, and he heard a quiet mutter in response that did not sound flattering.
“Oh, God. It’s so good.”
“Oh, brilliant!” John said, smiling widely.
Sherlock drank more of his soft drink, careful to sip from the side of his mouth without the injury. His eyes didn’t leave John’s.
Rolling his eyes, John took another sip of his drink. It was the winter holiday, John’s last at Hogwarts, and he was staying on campus like he always did. The castle was empty, but somehow still felt warmer than home, what with a dad who had set aside his wand for a bottle of whiskey and a sister who had never forgiven John for receiving an invitation to Hogwarts when she hadn’t.
John took another sip of beer. Supper had been hours ago, and with a half-empty stomach, he was beginning to cultivate a nice buzz.
at the non-magical parts of healing. Besides, there was always another wizard around who could provide a spell if John’s didn’t work.
He’d get up in thirty seconds. He just needed a few more moments alone, reminding himself that no one cared. They tolerated him, and this was enough. Alone protected him.
John had never danced like this before, with a partner who seemed to predict his every move, who didn’t just follow John’s actions, but reciprocated them. It felt like they were one body with two parts, winding around each other. It was categorically the sexiest dance John had ever shared with someone else. A flash of joy spread through John, and he couldn’t stop himself from laughing out loud.
The words are devastating, and John’s brain is overcome by white noise. Sherlock is moving against him, but John’s thoughts have become soupy slow, and he has to open and close his mouth several times before he can get the words out. “You .. want…”
Molly nodded. “On the first day of Year Two, he told our teacher that her husband was having an affair. The rest of the day was, uh, exciting, I guess?”
The current song began to fade out, and a new one began. John didn’t recognize the tune, but he knew it must be something popular - the crowd cheered and began to dance with a rejuvenated vigor. Bodies spun around bodies. Spotlights attached to the ceiling roved across the crowd, painting the dancers with color and light.
“Look, Watson,” Charlie went on, his voice uncharacteristically soft. “Those of us who work with dragons, we’re in near-constant need for healing. And there’s this chap - his name is Sholto. He’s a real solid sort, and he could be working at any hospital, but he’s with us. And he’s always going on about how much healing can be done without spells. He’d like you. And I think you’d like him too.”
.” Harry’s voice was gentle.
He didn’t even know what he and Sherlock
Sherlock’s face took on an expression John knew quite well - it was the one he made when he thought that John was being particularly dense and he was eager to enumerate the reasons he had come to this conclusion.
“They didn’t check your pockets?” Sherlock asked incredulously.
Two days later, John couldn’t find his mobile in his backpack. Grumbling to himself, he began to check the smaller pockets with increasing panic.
Sherlock lets out another long sigh, and John lets his hand drift lower. His touch slips down the bony knobs of Sherlock’s back, and he thinks about what he’ll feed Sherlock the next day. The man’s lost half a stone during this case and it’s not weight he can spare to lose. John’s hand settles between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and he begins to rub the tense muscles. The air from the open window is cold, but Sherlock is warm.
Brilliant Sherlock, who was now aglow with power, charms dripping from his fingers and spells flying from his wand.
His circadian rhythm is off kilter and it’s 3 AM. It’s eerily quiet in the flat. He stays in bed for several minutes and lets himself mourn for a life cut short. He wishes the kidnapper had fought back so that he could have transformed his hopeless sorrow into something concrete. Sore fists would feel more useful than the current ache in his chest.
finally happening ....
They were standing in the shadows of a building across from the Leaky Cauldron. A gang of humans and goblins had been counterfeiting galleons, and Lestrade wanted them caught yesterday. Sherlock was certain they planned to meet tonight.
A case goes bad.
John stared, and Sherlock stared back. As John watched, two spots of pink appeared high across Sherlock’s impossible cheekbones, and his plush lips drifted apart. He gaped at John, and John stared at his lips, remembering where they had been the night before.
“I wasn’t flirting with her,” John finally said.
Sherlock had no compunction against testing cursed items on his unsuspecting flatmate, and John supposed he was lucky that Sherlock only did so when he was sure - mostly sure - that they wouldn’t cause any permanent damage.
John pulled the lower part of his jersey up so that he could wipe the sweat from his face. As he tucked his shirt back into his running shorts, he felt an odd prickling sensation on the back of his neck. He suddenly knew, without looking up, that someone was watching him. He raised his head slowly, eyes skimming across the pitch and then to the nearby buildings.
That afternoon, Greg came up to John in the cafeteria.
Sherlock was still holding onto his shirt.
With Sherlock, John spent hours investigating illicitly cursed items, trolling through the magical nooks and crannies of magical London, and interrogating humans and the more advanced magical creatures alike. As the months went by, John grew more comfortable talking to other wizards, but he still felt like an interloper amongst them.
He doesn’t get a chance.
He didn’t see Sherlock’s thoughtful expression watching him leave.
Fingers brushed his knuckles, and only then did John see how white they were as he clenched his beer bottle.  He looked up and met Clara’s gaze.
“Wait!” he said, ripping his mouth away. “Just give me a second.”
The potion started to emit an eerie trill.
But John couldn’t bring himself to be upset. As far as he could tell, Sherlock wasn’t intentionally being rude. And, John could admit, his observations were amazingly accurate.
It works, John thinks giddily, and he can’t contain the grin that takes over his lips.  He glances up, wanting to share his spectacular discovery with someone - Sherlock’s not the only one who can propose a hypothesis and run an experiment after all. He locks eyes with Lestrade, who is staring at the both of them with his mouth gaping like a fish.  John becomes aware of the marked quiet from the Yarders around them.
Sally grabbed a cookie and turned to face John. “Sherlock Holmes. You shouldn’t hang out with him.”
Sherlock is standing at the kitchen table delivering a blistering monologue on what he perceives is poor training in the blood-spatter experts of the NSY. He’s gesturing a bit too cavalierly with his knife - he had been cutting up a pig spleen earlier, but John doesn’t know why - and it’s easy for John to grab his narrow hips and bodily move him to the side when he needs to get by. Sherlock’s speech falters, just for a second, and then he’s off and running on his next point of contention.
“You have
He had survived. He wasn’t sure how. He supposed he was glad he still lived. Sherlock didn’t want to die. Not exactly. It wasn’t quite that he wanted to be alive either, but he was fairly certain he didn’t want to die.
It didn’t.
It was still just as likely to find a poison in their kitchen as jam. Sherlock mistakenly turned himself incorporeal for an entire weekend, couldn’t work out the reversal spell, and eventually John was forced to owl Mycroft for help. One morning John wandered into the living room to find that the sofa
“What a wanker,” Greg groaned. “Whose dad buys him a car every year? And in London?”
Turning, he led John down the hallway, maintaining his grip on John’s belt loop. They passed the first three doors without pausing, but stopped at the fourth, which looked no different than the others. The stranger let go of John and knelt gracefully in front of the door, fiddling with the lock. For a moment John wondered if he had the key - maybe he knew someone at the club, John thought, and maybe they were allowed to be back here, but then-
John leaned in closer, his chest brushing against Sherlock’s, and he dragged his tongue over a prominent cord of muscle in Sherlock’s right neck. “Lovely,” he said, his voice little more than a hiss of breath, and he bit down, just hard enough to hurt.
Waking up was a rambling project. He first became aware of a terrible pain in his left wrist, so fierce and sharp that he could not feel anything else for several long moments. Sherlock was still surrounded by blackness, and it took him an embarrassingly long time to realize that this was because his eyes were closed.
And then he heard a sound. It was soft at first, barely a scratch and almost impossible to hear over the pounding of his heart. It came again, and he recognized it for what it was - someone was slowly, painfully slowly, unlocking the door.
Voldemort came back.
“Well, yes, that was rather my point,” Sherlock manages to say while John does his best to kiss the words out of his lips.
“That’d be great,” John said, and he found that he meant it.
To recover from his concussion, Sherlock is prescribed brain rest. His lingering headache blunts his manic energy, but it is hardly enough to keep him sedentary. John splurges on expensive headphones and fills Sherlock’s phone with rare recordings of classical concertos from online music libraries.  He spends more money on digital music in those three days than he has in his entire life, but if it keeps Sherlock from harrying off to injury and second impact syndrome, John decides it’s worth it.
Sherlock’s spell, suddenly and cleanly, caught. The fire under the pewter snapped out, yellow smoke raced downwards like running water into the cauldron, and the deep purple potion paled to a pretty lavender, smooth, viscous, and inert.
“Sherlock,” John said, and he knew it sounded like a caress in his mouth. It must have sounded that way to Sherlock too, who suddenly grinned lasciviously.
The memories came back slowly, and John remembered the kiss.
Even Constable Lestrade - dull, annoying, but not the worst of the lot - agreed. When Sherlock turned up at the murder scene anyway, Lestrade pulled him aside and kindly, but firmly, warned him off.
Sherlock eventually returned to his potion, making more noise than seemed necessary, but for the rest of the morning, John would catch Sherlock sneaking glances at him.
Sometimes, when Sherlock was far away in his Mind Palace and John was left alone with his own thoughts, he’d feel a hint of old bitterness, lurking stubbornly under his skin. He’d run into an old friend from Hogwarts, and he’d see the thoughts they didn't voice: “Oh, there goes poor John Watson. Poor chap. Barely more than a Squib.”
Sherlock’s head shoots up and he stares at John with wide eyes. He blinks a half dozen times and then collapses back again. Chuckling, John leans down to lick a nipple and he pulls his thumb back before pushing in again.
John released Sherlock’s cock, and it only took another five hard pulls before John was coming as well. He slouched into the wall. It was hard against his back, and Sherlock was hot and heavy against his front, and he could barely get in a deep breath. He had never felt so good.
Syringe - draw up the solution. Check for air bubbles.
In the first month of the war, John took a hex to the leg. It didn’t do any permanent damage, but John would never be able to forget the searing pain when it had first hit him.  He spent the remainder of the war with a limp.
"I find crime interesting," Sherlock finally said.
John frowned, “Lost it?”  He glanced at Molly and saw that her face had turned red. She caught John’s eye and gave a minute shake, her lips pursed tightly.
“John.”
It was the Tuesday of the second week of school. John had spent every lunch period so far enjoying Mike and Molly’s easy camaraderie. They had accepted him into their friendship without fanfare. Molly was shy and often more than a little awkward, but she was genuinely kind. Hiding behind her blushing cheeks and stammered sentences was a sharp mind. Mike was no less intelligent, but he possessed a far more easy-going attitude that served as a necessary balm to Molly’s more nervous energy.
The sun was still there, as was the warm summer breeze, and he thought probably the goshawk was still there as well. But otherwise he was alone. And no matter how much he liked to think himself beyond silly childhood trivialities - he couldn’t even remember the last time he had cried, and had he ever believed in Father Christmas, the great imposter? - he was caught in an intense wave of fear and cresting panic.  He had fallen, he had been knocked unconscious, he had clearly hit his head, his wrist was broken,
So Mycroft made the decision to run for help. He arrived at a nearby road within minutes and was able to return to his brother’s side within the quarter hour, this time followed by a good Samaritan who had been out for a Saturday drive.
Sherlock’s expression gave nothing away. “My lips become chapped very easily.”
He would have liked to accompany Father to his conference. That might have been interesting. But apparently nine year olds couldn’t be trusted to sit quietly during lectures on new methods of indirect volatilization.
, John realized. The dark wizard’s laughter filled the room, echoing against the water. Sherlock, for his part, was slowly turning in a circle, his eyes racing over the spells, the emotionless mask completely gone from his face so that John could see only despair.
For thirty seconds, John could only stare at the piece of paper as his brain stumbled to accept what had happened: this was Sherlock’s mobile number.
“What’s up with him?” John frowned at his sandwich and wondered if he was pulling off a nonchalant air. The way his friends were peering at him, he was pretty sure that he wasn’t.
“Nice to meet you, John,” Sherlock said, and he dropped to his knees. He lifted the waist of John’s pants, carefully freed the head of John’s erection, and then tore open the condom packet. Then in a move that John thought existed only in porn, he popped the condom between his lips and rolled it onto John’s cock with his mouth.
His paralysis shattered, and John blinked back into the present. He turned to Harry and Clara, both of whom were watching him with identical all-knowing expressions.
When they were finally alone, John had to take several deep breaths before the adrenaline waned enough that he felt like he could face Sherlock. His shoulders relaxed first, then his fists, and finally he closed his eyes so that he could take a deep, cleansing breath.
“Sherlock, run!” John pulled Moriarity close, gritting his teeth. “If the hex triggers, we both go up.”  He spared a glance at Sherlock and was gutted to see the fear - fear for
That night after rugby, when John showered at home, he broke his promise and took himself in hand while thinking about long fingers and pale grey-green eyes.
“We’ll have more time later,” Sherlock said between kisses. “We’ll have all the time in the world. Right now, I need you.” He braced himself up on his left forearm, holding his body a few centimeters above John then, not quite touching. John heard him mutter a few words. Suddenly the hand that held both of their cocks was coated in slick.
Wondering who Greg was and still curious about the forbidden toilet, John nodded and did his best to keep up.
The four of them ate for a few minutes, talking about upcoming assignments and gossiping about their classmates.
Groaning, Sherlock shuffled upwards slowly, noticing that the white of his fingertips almost matched the floor below in color.
, however, have a healthy sense of outrage, especially when Sherlock noted his impotence. The man charged Sherlock with his machete raised high, and it was only by employing a fancy bit of bartitsu that Sherlock was able to escape any serious harm.
Sherlock hummed in response and then let out a shaky breath.
“I don’t think he can help it,” Molly said, looking down at her hands. “He’s brilliant and just  … well, he’s Sherlock.” Her cheeks pinkened before she visibly shook herself free from her thoughts. “Anyway, he used to argue with the teachers, and he’d get in fights with the other kids. But then a few years ago, he suddenly didn’t come to school for, like, two months. When he came back, he was quieter.”
Sighing inwardly, John returned his attention back to Sarah, who was chatting about her older sister. As she spoke, she slowly drifted closer to John’s side. Every few steps, her upper arm would brush John’s.
"It was nothing," he said, softly and just to himself. He pretended that he couldn't feel the burning sensation in the back of his eyes.
Sherlock continued to study him with a pinched expression for another moment, and then his mouth softened. “Yes, well.”  He turned back to their lab set up, and John didn’t miss the way his chest puffed out, just a little.
The pit in John’s stomach was growing. “You don’t have to be mean.”
“Nah.” Mike rejoined the conversation. “He wants to be a chemist. He used to do experiments in the chemistry lab after school. He’s not allowed any more - not after he blew it up.”
It was like remembering when he was a child and magic had no rules, but had simply just
John nodded and then winced as Sherlock grasped a leaf in long fingers, frowned at it, and then gently touched it to his tongue. His lower lip gleamed with saliva, and John found himself staring for several long moments. He tore his eyes away, and reached for his crossword and found himself saying. “Makes sense - that rumor’s true then.  Good to know.”
He snuck a look at Mike and Molly from the corner of his eyes. They seemed nice, he thought. He could see himself studying with them in the upcoming weeks. Rugby practice started next week, and he looked forward to getting on the pitch. He wanted to feel the wind at his back, hear the shouts of the crowd, and feel the burn in his legs as he ran.
“His name is Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock blinked several times before he finally managed to softly say, “Oh.”
John smiled back.
Day after day, Victor spoke to Sherlock. Every day it was, “That problem set was difficult, huh, Holmes?” or “I’ll bet you’re ready for the next quiz on Monday?” And so forth and so on.
Magic was necessary for most healing work, but there were some things that needed to be done manually, and for the first time, John found something that came easily to him. He was
The answering silence was a little too pointed.
“Too bad, mate.” Lestrade’s smile was friendly enough, but Sherlock didn’t trust the glint in the other man’s eyes. “Consulting detectives do paperwork.”
Suddenly Charlie’s green eyes saw too much. John looked down, studying his hands, and he thought about the rejection letter from St. Mungo’s shoved under his mattress in his dorm room. It had been a stupid dream, he thought. What use could St. Mungo’s have for a broken wizard like him?
Sherlock’s smile turns soft and lovely, a delicate thing. “Yes,” he agrees, his voice a whisper. He rolls toward John, and John turns on his side to meet him.
Most of the time it didn’t.
John felt his face flush. “You know,” he said, trailing off and looking at Sherlock meaningfully. The other man’s expression barely changed, but his eyes narrowed impossibly more.  “That, uh, everyone who goes to Beauxbatons is quite, you know, fit.”
“Mycroft?” he asked, hating how small and scared his voice sounded.
John hesitated a moment and stared at Sherlock’s flushed face, feeling a little dismissed and also a little hurt.
Nausea began to build. It was the next step of vasovagal syncope, Sherlock knew, precipitated by hypoglycemia, lack of sleep, and probably a touch of dehydration as well.
Home was now London, he told himself. Home was a crowded flat with just him and Mum, and soon home would also be his new school ... John took another gulp of beer and tried to ignore the clenching in his chest.
John chuckled. “I feel like it was my fault. I told you about the robbery. Anyway, you’re my friend, and I wanted to know what I had said that got you all hot and bothered."
John only vaguely remembered Harry Potter, a first year with too much temper and not enough sense of self-preservation, from that ordeal with the Philosopher’s Stone during John’s seventh year when he was busy not studying for his N.E.W.T.S. and desperately pretending that he didn’t care.
Sherlock turns his head away, his brows drawn down. When he turns back to John, his expression is hesitant. “John, you put me on a pedestal. You always have.” He frowns and sits up, resting his folded hands on his lap, and John doesn’t miss that Sherlock is using both words and his body to shield himself. “You see things in me that don’t exist. I’m flattered, of course, but it means you sell yourself short.” He grimaces. “I’m difficult and brash and not a kind person. I am the fortunate one that you see past these flaws and still … desire me.”
John grinned. “Okay.”
John looked away, unable to bear the eye contact.  He felt Harry’s hands tighten.
John raised a single eyebrow.
“Shit!” John said again, and he rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. When his vision finally cleared, he saw that he was surrounded by strangers.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said slowly, buttoning his jeans. He was studying John with his piercing gaze, eyes flitting across John’s face. John wondered what he could see.
Molly and Mike had been right, John thought with an inward grin. Sherlock Holmes
John licked his lower lip, wondering the same thing and questioning his own sanity for what he was about to ask.  “It’ll be fun. Mike, Greg, Molly and I were going to get burgers afterwards. You could come with us.”
, John! I did do something wrong.”
And he texts back, "luv u 2 qt, 5eva, xoxo"
“It's about what you said some days ago, John,” Sherlock starts off.
,” Sherlock continued, “that today is the day of love.”
should be bought and what should
Finally, his head breached the water and he smelled air, and flowers, and water, and so much more than he had ever imagined.
"Yes," replied Sherlock with a steady voice, ready to do anything for John.
John can't hide the smile that tugs at the corners of his mouth and he just gives in. He smiles warmly at Sherlock, but it falters soon enough.
John just blinked confused. "That was a joke, Sherlock, I know you're -" He interrupted himself. Touched his ears. Looked at Sherlock. Opened his mouth. Closed it again.
With a kiss to Sherlock's navel, John straightened up and shifted backwards on the bed. He knelt between Sherlock's spread legs, the toes of his bare feet already curling, his usually pale skin rosy, and his chest heaving with a quick rhythm. John smiled, leaned forward and whispered into Sherlock's ear, "You're beautiful." He hoped it hadn't come out blurry.
. John was his. Oh, he loved him, and how he loved him.
Sherlock was naked, however, and quickly stole into the hospital to find something to wear. When he was fully clothed he turned around to find John standing in the middle of the room—eyes wide, mouth open.
Then Mike suggests that John should get a flatmate, and John agrees, and then he meets the most brilliant man ever and his world is turned upside down.
During the whole ride to the St. Bart's Hospital, Sherlock held John's hand.
Occasionally, John's finger would flip up to his right temple, moving them quickly as if he was brushing off dust. He then connected thumb and the other fingers to a triangle.
He gave John the book and tented his fingers beneath his chin. He really was horribly sorry for putting John into this situation. If only he had thought a bit more they wouldn't be here now and John wouldn't be deaf.
"But if you take my violin," said Sherlock, "what will be left to me?"
Sherlock nods as a sign of understanding. “Go on.”
He laid the young man down on the beach, in the exact same spot where he had been when they met those many nights ago, taking special care to pillow his head up high. Sherlock located some seaweed and made a tight bandage out of it. It wasn't great, certainly not, but it would help staunch the bleeding, at least for a little while. No, the human should not die! Sherlock knew, however, that he could do nothing but wait.
“No,” Sherlock says, shaking his head thoughtfully, “we would always find each other, John. No matter where or when. Because we belong together. Because a Sherlock Holmes and a Doctor John Watson
"There you have the effect of cuddling with me. I'll make you human."
He didn't know how long this took and he couldn't be bothered to care. It was wonderful, it was perfect, and he could spend the rest of his life cuddling with Sherlock.
He never got an answer.
Soon John's torso was bare as well and he lay down upon Sherlock, chest to chest, heated skin to heated skin. They shared another loving kiss before John let his hands wander deeper, teasingly tickling Sherlock's sides and laughing at how adorable a giggling Sherlock was, and then grabbed the hem of his trousers.
“You – you like it?”
"That was brilliant," a voice suddenly whispered behind him, and Sherlock jumped and turned around to see a human being behind him who was smiling with a dazed look on his face. Sherlock didn't hesitate long and jumped back into the sea as quickly as possible, never turning back and never emerging from the water again. He was relieved when he lay in his bed at home in the palace, safe and sound, and he cursed himself inwardly for being stupid enough to let a human see him.
"Sherlock," he said and his voice broke, "this is not legal but I have no other choice. I love you, more than I could ever love somebody else and I owe you my life. Will you marry me?"
"Who are you?"
He assumed he had hurt John with his last text. In retrospect, it really had been a bit not good. Sherlock had wanted to write something else entirely.
Just before Sherlock tripped over the edge, John let go of him, causing an almost frustrated whine and a look that resembled one of a lost puppy. John gently threaded his fingers through Sherlock's damp curls, kissed the tip of his nose and positioned himself so that they were pressed together from head to toe.
He stole out of the palace where everyone danced and sang gaily, and he sat down on a rock in the palace garden, thinking of John.
“Irrelevant,” Sherlock scoffs. “I want you to know that I have been thinking about that matter and I have come to a conclusion.”
, Sherlock remembered and realised that the human was hurt—that he would drown because only sea folk and fish could breathe underwater. He sped up and dived through the waves, riding their crests until he reached the human, pulled him into his arms and swam up to the surface with him.
Sherlock spent this night in John's bed.
.” And with that, he gently touched his lips to Sherlock’s, eyes fluttering close, lips gently pulling and caressing. “I love you,” he whispered as Sherlock’s hands slid down to his neck. “I love you,” he uttered as he dropped to the floor to be closer to Sherlock. “I love you, Sherlock,” he murmured when Sherlock pulled him close and held him in a tight embrace.
“You're the best thing that could have happened to me!” John finally blurts out, eyes wide, mouth open. “Don't you
Sherlock couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment in his chest.
But simply thinking about all scenarios was enough for him. Knowing that his other self would sit at home, peacefully reading a book, maybe playing with his children in another universe, made him happy and gave him the strength to endure another day at war.
, absolutely not!” He blinked once, twice. His vision had gone blurry.
The man, for it clearly had been a male human, wasn't afraid of him, and he hadn't been surprised – just happy. His violin playing had apparently caught the attention and the admiration of the blond man who was shorter than the other human beings Mycroft had told him about. Sherlock knew he should be afraid and hiding from mankind, yet there had been something special about the young man. His appearance… his eyes, of such a deep, deep blue, just like the blue when the sea was troubled during a storm. His mouth so thin and yet so friendly and open. His hands so small and strong at the same time. His posture confident and brave.
. John has given up on protesting, it would be of no use anyway.
John smiled softly and whispered "Sherlock". He would have loved to hear his flatmate's voice but it wasn't possible.
“Oh Jesus.” John sank down against the sofa’s backrest and ran a hand over his face. “I thought… I thought you didn’t care much for this sort of stuff. Sentiment and all that.”
We understand each other without words – isn't that what people find so romantic? Isn't that what everyone tries to get and sometimes need years in order to achieve? SH
And Sherlock whispered "I do" while a tear rolled down his cheek, and his heart felt better and the pain in his legs lessened. John got up and cupped Sherlock's face gently, pressing his lips to Sherlock's mouth and together they stood and held each other—kissing until dawn.
, and it makes Sherlock incredibly angry.
Sherlock hesitantly opened the door.
they have one of those rare arguments, John can get very angry. And by
Everyone calls him war veteran – but he knows he could be dead. It is not a nice feeling.
John simply felt worthless without his hearing.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I don’t, that is true. However, everything is different when you are concerned.”
John signed when they were done: right hand spread out flat above his heart. Sherlock answered by placing his right hand over John's.
So he set out from the garden toward the whirlpools that raged in front of where Irene dwelt. There were no flowers or seaweed, and no fish passed by. It was grey and bare place and Sherlock had to be careful not to fall into one of the whirlpools.
. But before he has a chance to do so, John will start to giggle, and Sherlock will join in, and peace has returned to 221B.
"John," Sherlock breathed, knowing that John couldn't hear him but his breath on the doctor's neck was enough to make him shiver.
Sherlock stared at his mobile as if he had never seen it before. John's text had put him into a state of speechlessness that he wouldn't emerge from any time soon.
Gently, Sherlock took his friend's left hand and guided his fingertips to the neck of the violin, shortly above the corpus. He put slight pressure on them to show John that he should keep them there. A slight nod against his back made it clear that John had understood. John's right hand was still resting on Sherlock's belly, clutching the bow. Sherlock took it and raised it, grabbing the bow himself and putting it on the strings. He then turned his head to one side so John could see his mouth: "Try to feel the music." From the corner of his eyes he saw how the doctor blinked in confusion but then nodded.
“But we aren't in that universe, now, are we?” Sherlock argues.
When the surface was so, so close, Sherlock spread out his arms next to his face to quicken up his speed and reach his goal faster.
“It certainly wouldn't be good for your health,” Sherlock agrees, hesitating shortly.
"Wake," he pleaded, "wake and live," and he bent down to kiss the man's forehead tenderly. He looked at the human's hair, sandy of colour yet so different from every grain on the beach. Sherlock lay down and picked up a bit of sand, holding it close to the man's head, marveling at the different colours and the softness of his hair. It was too dark, however, to see properly and Sherlock decided to conduct this experiment later, in daylight.
Just then, the siren of an ambulance resounded and turned around the corner soon after. The paramedics rushed towards John and Sherlock, heaving the injured doctor onto a stretcher. One of the medics climbed into the car with him to disinfect the wound and bandage it properly while Sherlock was discussing with the driver whether he was allowed to ride along with John. He was his flatmate after all and more or less the person closest to John. After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing he was finally granted permission to sit next to John's stretcher.
The more he heard, the more his patience decreased and the young prince couldn't wait to see gold glowing heavens, green hills and trees, animals, people, and breathe the air over the sea.
"I know exactly what you like," said the sea witch, "and I can assure you that it is a very foolish idea. But you shall have your wish fulfilled for it will bring you grief and unhappiness and this is what I want. You want to get rid of your tail and have to legs instead so you can walk like a human, and have that doctor fall in love with you." Irene laughed out loud, and Sherlock was terrified of her for a bit.
But what if... what if Sherlock Holmes and John Watson had never, ever met?
Sherlock swam closer to the shore. He was alone again so he eventually left the water, with only his fins in the waves, and his upper body on the soft sand. It was a nice feeling, and it was both new and exciting to feel the texture of the beach on his skin. Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed the air into his lungs that were made for living underwater, yet they worked just fine when he was outside. After a while he blinked once, twice and then sat up. The sun was now just a mere line on the horizon and Sherlock picked up his violin he had taken with him. He began to play a soft tune until the ball of fire had disappeared completely and welcomed the night with a melody so melancholic and sweet that no creature would have been able to think ill of it.
Sherlock looked up and fixed John with his gaze for a while. Then he put down the paper and held up his hands to answer in their sign language.
Blinking. Frowning. No answer.
A pleasing pressure pooled in Sherlock's groin so that he wasn't able to kiss John back anymore. John increased the pace between their bodies, swiping their thumbs over their tips and peppering Sherlock's temple with kisses until Sherlock was reduced to a trembling mess in his arms, barely able to form a coherent thought.
It was as if Sherlock's heart broke into two and a single tear rolled down his cheek. The pain in his legs increased, and he was reminded that by the morning, he would be sea foam and John would be with someone else.
Sherlock said with his hands and John nodded resignedly. He probably felt even more useless than back when he still had his cane, and apparently he had accepted that. Something about John's sad attitude made Sherlock's chest clench painfully.
There would be no 221B, no murder chases, just boredom,
"Your doctor," Irene said, her eyes glinting dangerously. "Whom you can captivate with your legs, your voice, your eyes."
Happiness.
Sherlock came back to the surface every night after his first experience with the world up above him, and he looked and examined and learned. After a fortnight, he got braver, and emerged from the water just as the sun went down. The sky was tinged in a warm red and the water glimmered in the last rays of sunshine.
The fingers in his jumper tensed, then relaxed, but Sherlock's breathing was still a conscious effort. And yet John noticed how much Sherlock paid attention to everything: the texture of his lips, the movement of his pupils behind his closed eyes.
He traveled the kingdom, to cities far and near, and played for the sea folk who lived there. They admired his music, and they admired him, and Sherlock soon became the most famous merman in all of Baker Kingdom.
The stars were shining down upon him, and Sherlock wished he could fly to explore the sky, but he was content with being on the surface for now. He gently flapped with his fins and swam closer to the shore, carefully looking around. He didn't want to be seen by anybody although it was highly unlikely that there was a human out on the beach at this time of night.
it, Sherlock!” John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s nose. “Just as I love
Gently, he rolled Sherlock and himself over so that he was hovering above Sherlock, kissing him on the forehead. "Trust me," he whispered, and Sherlock nodded.
They could talk about those two perfectly in their sign language.
However,
"Where am I?"
"Run away with me," Sherlock pleaded and John held on even tighter and after what seemed to be an eternity, he nodded. He pulled away and looked up at Sherlock, before kneeling down and grasping his hands.
find its way into the trolley
"Are you okay?" John asked without a sound by just forming the words with his lips. Sherlock nodded once, hesitantly, then once again with a bit more certainty, grabbing John's wrist with his free hand. His thumb wandered to the pulse that was beating quickly under John's skin. Sherlock's own pulse mixed with John's, evidence of them being alive, of this being real.
"Well, you are one lucky man," Irene said with a wicked smile. "I will be able to help you, and here is what you have to do. Swim to the shore with a draught I will brew you before the sun rises, and then drink it on the beach. Your tail will divide and shrink and it will become a pair of legs. But be aware that it will hurt, a sharp pain when you walk and sit, like a knife pushed into your legs. Are you willing to suffer this?"
John does the same and turns to properly look at Sherlock.
"John?" Sherlock squeezed his flatmate's shoulder but was ignored. John got up, looking straight ahead, and slowly left the living room. He ascended the stairs, trailing his right leg behind him – had his psychosomatic limp returned? Sherlock stood in the room, violin in his hand, gazing after John. He didn't know what to do. Would it be useful to follow his friend and try to get some information out of him? Would John prefer to be left alone?
The music transported them to heights they could never have reached on their own. To stand so close and trusting with each other was something they had never imagined. Sherlock who ignored feelings, and John who knew how Sherlock thought about this – but here they were, body to body, heart to heart. It just felt so
Sherlock comes to a conclusion. He calls upstairs for John, and he immediately comes into the living room. As expected.
John beams at him. "Look, Sherlock," he says, "I catched the moth you were so afraid of."
Finally, he couldn't bear it any longer and told his secret to Mycroft. He was very considerate about it, not being mad at Sherlock for stealing away at night to go to the surface, nor for revealing himself to a human. As it turned out, he knew who that man was, and he knew where he lived. He had once known his father when he was younger and so he took Sherlock's hand and rose from the water with him to show his little brother where John lived and worked. Mycroft told him the human was often seen in a hospital where people were healed and Sherlock spent many a night and many an evening outside the hospital where it was connected to the shore and looked up through the windows and the shadows behind them. Whenever he saw John, his heart would beat a little faster.
it in his hands? He shivers. He really doesn't want to throw a tantrum right now, he doesn't want to appear weak, so he does the only thing he can think of to feel confident.
He genuinely hopes it isn't because Sherlock has deleted who Mike is.
He pulled Sherlock into a hug and kissed him on the mouth. Sherlock cupped his neck and pulled him down into the pillows.
The young merman submerged immediately, swimming to the place where he had seen the vessel before and there the human was, sinking lower and lower—red liquid leaking from a hole in his left shoulder.
You are there for me, no matter how terrible I act. SH
, Sherlock decided.
But whenever he gets a text saying, "luv u sherly bby xxxx", he can't help but smile.
John's lips on Sherlock's middle between his legs almost drove him over the edge. His breathing, his heart beat, everything was moving too fast to be possible. John's tongue pleasured him, John's lips closed around him as if they were made for this. His hand, which he locked with Sherlock's again, gently caressed the soft skin between thumb and wrist. Sherlock shivered, trembled, moaned, cried and enjoyed. John was perfect. John was
And maybe it was the song, perhaps it was coincidence, but John did feel better after a while, and he smiled—the blue of his eyes so warm and soft that Sherlock felt he could swim in them just like he could swim in the ocean, his home. Looking into John's eyes felt like returning home, and Sherlock found this to be a peculiar feeling.
The detective felt so much in this moment – happiness, joy, passion, pleasure, arousal and love. Especially love.
Sherlock stares at him, mouth opening and closing twice before he actually says something. When he does, it is merely a whisper. “Me too, John.”
Sherlock curtly tensed in John's arms but relaxed eventually, playing with John's tongue.
Of course he didn't really have anything to do in the household; he simply wanted what was best for Sherlock and if that meant to make up excuses for not going to crime scenes he would happily do that. He didn't want to slow Sherlock's thoughts down. His smile was partly genuine, anyway, because Sherlock would be able to continue with his beloved work without John being a burden.
