Of course, that didn’t come without challenges. Dying over and over and over again, being tortured and cut off from his power, spending over a year in purgatory, losing his memories; every obstacle he faced shaped his decisions and his future.
Just a fancy car
And you started it
Claire Novak was resigned to the fact that, in order to be a hunter, she had to give up her family. Her emotions. It’s what Dean and Sam did, every hunter really, time and time again. Why would she be different?
“Cas, man, it’s me again.” Dean sighed, resting his forehead on the steering wheel. Hey, it’s not like he can die again, what’s the harm in a little reckless behavior?
I had a feeling so peculiar
Dean strode into the kitchen and grabbed a beer. Leaning his forehead against the closed fridge, he exhaled, a sigh that originated deep in his body. He opened the fridge and took out a second beer.
Cas looked at Dean, who fell asleep on the couch in the ‘Deancave’ in the middle of one of the Stars Wars movies. Cas wasn’t sure which one. He looked so peaceful when he slept, all the worry and fear melted off of his face. He looked like the man he could have been, if his life had been easier. If he didn't have the weight of the world on his shoulders.
He especially loved when Dean would pull into a gas station, leaving Cas in the car, to grab whatever junk food he decided to introduce the angel to, no matter how many times he explained that “Dean, I can’t taste the food like you can.” He treasured those happy memories, Dean smiling and throwing his head back, full belly laughing at something Cas said, or pulling Cas into his room because “What do you mean you haven’t seen Star Wars?! That’s just not allowed, get over here.” Game nights with Sam on their days off, co-raising Jack together.
Clearing his throat, Sam looked down at his note cards, before looking back at the couple. They smiled back at him.
“Forget I said anything Rufus, Jesus.”
Hannah was one of his closest (and only) friends, who later turned on him, trying to convince him to kill Dean! Naturally, as all of his friendships go, she died helping him.
And how you left them all to me
Dean heard nothing but the soft chirping of crickets and birds nearby, and his own breathing.
I should've asked you questions
He was doing worse than he let on.
+1. Sam
I wish to know
It was just utterly broken. Dulled down by the years of torture he endured and had to doll out. It caught Castiel’s eye almost immediately. The brightest, most beautiful thing in all of Hell.
‘But Cas changed all of that,’ Dean thought one day. ‘God is impartial to sexual orientation, my God.’ What a relief it was to hear from one of God’s messengers that Dean wasn’t… he was never… wrong. He wasn’t broken or disgusting. It was okay.
Dean imagined Cas driving along a rural, quiet road, blasting his songs out of the speakers of the Continental. Maybe his tie was loosened, maybe his elbow was slightly out of the window. Maybe he was humming along, a big grin on his face.
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
Slowly, however, he began to see the good in Jack. Castiel. All he saw was Cas. And then Cas was back and life was as peachy as it could be when you’re raising a teenaged(?) Nephilim who’s powerful enough to destroy the cosmos if he gets angry.
So everytime he caught the angel staring into Dean’s eyes, standing a little too close for it to be strictly platonic, rebelling against fuckin’ Heaven for Dean, he didn’t really give it a second thought.
Long story short, I survived
From the moment he met Dean Winchester Castiel was doomed to fall. He was once one of Heaven’s most loyal angels, but the human changed him. Everyone saw it, every angel knew the effect Dean had on their brother in arms. He wasn’t very popular with the Garrison, before or after he slaughtered half of their numbers.
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
“It’s okay though,” He blinked rapidly, trying to keep tears from falling. “I just hope he figures it out soon, before he loses him.”
When he died in Apocalypse World, protecting Jack and Kelly and Dean and Sam, Dean felt like he lost one of the most important people in his life. And he did. All because of his Nephilim kid, the son of fuckin’ Lucifer! And he was expected to take care of him because ‘that’s what Cas would want us to do.’ Bullshit.
Cas does what he says, bringing the car to a surprisingly smooth stop in front of the light. Then he looks up at Dean, and he
”Stoplight,” Dean warns. ”Let go of the gas, let the engine brake until-- now, start carefully pressing down the brake pedal.”
He can feel Cas watching him, but at first he almost thinks he’s going to drop it. The weird contradictory mixture of relief and disappointment that that stirs up lasts until Cas asks, “What happened?” And that’s the second attempt at getting Dean to open up, so, alright. Fine. They’re doing this.
“Fine, you try getting impaled and see how you feel about your survival rates.”
“It tickles,” he complains—so, naturally, Dean grins and digs his fingers into Cas’ sides to tickle him for
,” he manages to say, despite the fact that his soul has ascended from his body.
. But he’s a little, maybe a lot, more fuzzy on the aftermath.
He gets out of the driver’s seat and rounds the hood, handing his keys over to Cas who reluctantly accepts them when they cross paths, and then he gets in on the passenger side instead.
“To change the afterlife,” Billie adds, and Dean hasn’t even begun to approach processing why she would possibly even be here. Last time he’d seen her she’d also been taken away by a fucking cosmic entity, immediately following her trying to kill him and Cas.
Eventually, he does spot an exit sign with an additional sign for some shitty fast-food chain, and his stomach growls urgingly, so he shakes himself out of his minor funk and says, “Hey, turn off here.”
He starts walking toward the entrance, but Cas stays put behind him. When Dean turns back around to ask what the hold up is, Cas says, “You’re good at this,” something in his tone that Dean can’t place.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I must have misheard you,” the Entity says. “I thought you said you were here to get the angel, but you couldn’t have, because he’s
Sam stays thankfully quiet, and Dean doesn’t look at him. He keeps going. “Then… I mean. I fucked up. And Billie was coming after us, and we were locked in the archive room and she was going to break in and kill us both, and then Cas said. Uhm. Well. He invoked the deal, or whatever, and the Empty came, and it took Billie and it took him.”
He considers whether or not he should take a bow now and fuck right off the stage. He could just go straight to his room and lock the door and stay there forever and not even acknowledge that Sam is still sitting here. Exit, pursued by the terrifying prospect of having to talk even more about how he’s feeling.
”Dean, you wanted to die.”
Until Cas puts a hand on Dean’s forearm and finally pulls out the face that somehow always works wonders to make Dean want to tell him things, all tilt-y and soft and caring, and, well—that’s just cheating.
. There are other ways to improve the fucking afterlife, to—to--”
“Because what?” Dean frowns, the easiest part to process so far.
Then he remembers that if Chuck was to be believed, this might be the only universe—out of however many there was—where Cas loved him back. He’s really not sure what to do with that thought.
--” Dean starts. This is
Forth, and now back again.
“Yeah, like what?”
-- hm. Yeah, that’s not a show he’s going to be referencing.
His body hurts even through the morphine. He’s annoyingly nauseous the whole time before the anesthesia fully wears off, but even once he’s out of post-op and has been wheeled into a regular hospital room, he feels like shit.
Dean’s pretty sure his heart is going to beat out of his chest at just the
Jack nods, and then he suddenly moves forward to hug Dean again. Dean strokes his back, lets him cry into his shoulder, like he used to do for Sam—like he hasn’t done since Sam was still at least a head shorter than him.
One of Cas’ hands drops down to the hem of Dean’s shirt. “Can I see?” he asks, and Dean feels like he’s in a haze when he nods a

“I’m sure it is, buddy,” Dean replies, “but it turns out we might’ve some other stuff to deal with first. Like,” he pauses, looks around, then tries, “What’s that sign?” pointing at the closest one he can see.
deserved
”Right, so,” Dean says. He moves into Cas’ space and stays there, too busy to overthink it, and points out everything that’s especially vital for now. ”Brake and accelerator. Use your right foot for both. Gear shift. Speedometer. Turn signal. Don’t wanna be the asshole that doesn’t use the turn signal.”
Dean’s been quiet for too long, he realizes suddenly. He’s not sure what his face has been doing but Sam is looking at him expectantly, maybe a little concerned. Dean settles for saying, “What?” again, just verging more on disbelieving rather than suspicious, this time. Sam doesn’t even

What he ends up settling for is, “Dude, I actually don’t wanna talk about it.” Back to what comes naturally, the previous part of this conversation just a momentary lapse. Cas being dead, and whose fault it was or wasn’t, doesn’t even explain why he’s having a breakdown right
“I know you’re still going to make my terrible tofu scramble,” Sam says, but his face still shifts into something softer. “You okay, Dean?”
“That, and a tiny regime change,” Billie agrees.
Dean opens his mouth, about to go for a witty retort or a bad joke, and comes up with nothing. All he’s ever had is hunting, living out of the car, his little brother. And Sam might have dreamt of other things, but Dean never got to.
When Dean wakes up it’s past lunch, and Cas is still right next to him. He doesn’t sleep, but he figured out pretty quickly that Dean likes having him there for now—and it only took one mishap where Dean woke up to a cold bed after a nightmare that reminded him way too much of black goo and bloody handprints. Dean’s working on it, but Cas doesn’t mind staying with him.
“It’s okay,” Cas says immediately. Dean’s really been treating Cas wrong, if he’s so sure Dean can only say this when they don’t have to look at each other. It’s true, too, but Dean doesn’t want it to be. He shakes his head, maybe a
“Shut up,” Dean says. “It was the first psychiatrist I could think of.” Then he turns his head away again so he doesn’t have to look at Sam when he says, quietly, “And I know.”
Dean starts looking for cases again, even if he doesn’t feel up to it yet. Things are going to go back to normal—the kind of normal they were right before he almost died, at least—so it’s time to start acting like it. It looks like there might be a shapeshifter killing people in Provo, but when Dean suggests it to Sam all he gets is a look and a, “Dude, you’re still healing,” which is fair enough—so he forwards the link to Claire.
“Oh, then, by all means,” Dean says. He’s been better at not getting angry, or at least at not blowing up, but it’s starting to build up underneath his skin.
Dean eases back into hunting by ganking a couple of ghouls in Topeka with Cas, and it’s a quick enough hunt and short enough drive that they skip out on checking into a motel and instead make it back to their own bed by early morning.
He says, frustratedly, before he can overthink it, “And you—you can
"I do not understand."
“What did you remember?” Cas asks, stepping into the room. The door softly shuts behind him.
“Dean!” Castiel called, waving.
"Very pretty." Dean commented. He smirked at Castiel. "It's nice to see you here for dinner."
Dean ran his hands down Castiel’s legs to the inner side of his knees. He lifted Castiel’s legs, then slipped underneath so Castiel’s legs were over Dean’s shoulders.
"What?" He asked.
“Dean?” Castiel approached the other man and touched his shoulder gently. “Are you alright?”
"Congratulations." Castiel told Jess.
The next game was ‘Guess the Baby Food.’ Ellen set up bowls of various flavors of baby foods and everyone sampled each flavor. They wrote down their guesses on what type of baby food it was, and at the end the person who had the most correct would win.
Dean walked with Castiel down the stairs and to their bedroom.
"I'm surprised you didn't notice." Dean bit out. "I'm a bit of a trophy." Castiel frowned, his eyebrows furrowing.
Castiel broke many,
"Because." Claire said.
Unfortunately, he could already feel his brother’s words twisting in his chest and making him feel
“Who waited with me in the hospital room for fourteen hours while our surrogate labored with our baby?”
"Dean, don't-" Castiel was cut off with a jab to the stomach by a demon guard. He gasped and doubled over, caught unaware. Alastair and the demons hackled.
“Yeah, I think I will,” Dean said. “The way you explained all that graphing crap made it seem really straightforward.”
long-eared owl: wisdom, inquisitive, contemplative individual, another secret one :)
He collapsed onto the couch with a drawn out sigh. Immediately, Claire jumped up beside him. She tentatively placed her front paws on his leg and began to knead. Castiel winced when her claws pricked through the fabric of his pants, but he didn’t push her away. Claire climbed onto his lap and circled a few times before she curled up into a ball and started to purr. Castiel brushed her head lightly and she pressed into his hand. His eyelids were drooping before he realized it, too engrossed in petting the purring cat in front of him, and soon they were hardly opening at all.
Castiel sighed. “I guess you’re right.”
"What about you, Cassie?" Gabriel pried. "Did you have an enjoyable night?"
"Are you fucking with me?" He demanded.
Dean bites his lip to hide his grin as he replies.
Naomi blinked, her smile tightening. "Come, Castiel, we should get seated. Goodbye, Gabriel."
Castiel hummed and kissed him. "Neither do I."
want."
Castiel handed him the keys and got in on the passenger’s side. Dean slid into the driver’s seat and gripped the wheel of the Impala.
"I'm sorry to hear that." Charlie said. Her tone was all sympathy and no pity, for which Castiel was grateful.
"Hmph." Dean hummed and looked at his hands. "Your wards any good?"
A hand clasped gently around Dean’s wrist, drawing his attention.
Castiel relaxed.
Dean swallowed, his shoulders and jaw held stiffly.
Still
In the picture, they all had their arms in the air, except Cas. Charlie’s eyes were closed and she seemed to be mid-scream, but she was still obviously smiling. Sam and Jack also had open-mouth smiles, probably they had been shouting too. Dean’s eyes were closed and he was grinning with closed lips.
Hey a little late but better late than never right ?
"I missed you, jerk." The man said.
Jack continued to cry for a few minutes before Castiel was able to shake himself out of his thoughts. He immediately felt guilty for neglecting Jack, and he hurried to go tend to his pup. It was lucky that Jack only needed a diaper change since Castiel had not prepared a bottle.
“Dean, I’ve seen the way he looks at you, and I can assure you that he’s into you.” Charlie said. “And I promise that even if he wasn’t into you, which he is, he wouldn’t mind if you were into him. Besides, I gave him those Mickey Mouse ears for a reason.”
“I’m not.” Dean argued. “Cas ‘n I are gonna have a grand ‘ol time. Right, Cas?”
“So you’re not going to ask him out because you think you’re not smart enough for him?”
“Hey, I’m sorry, we’re a little backed up today.” Dean says, taking out a pencil and his notepad. “What can I get you?”
"My boss forgot." Dean said with a sigh. "He was supposed to meet Claire 'n me at the zoo, but he didn't. Claire was super bummed."
"So while we were still in that fucking place?" Dean spat.
“I set it up.” Castiel told him, chest puffed.
"And he watches Adam?" Castiel guessed. He was unprepared for the flash of guilt that crossed Dean's features.
His guard.
"When we get ice-cream, what flavor can I get?"
“Jack, you look so handsome.” Ellen said, her vice pitching into baby-talk. “How has your day been?”
"I left him outside." Castiel answered. "I do not think I'm well enough to carry him anywhere."
"Wings down, slowly." Alastair steadily ordered, eyeing them.
It was absolutely abhorrent that witches were allowed to treat Dean, or any familiar, in that way. Familiars were not meant to be forced into bonds and used against their will. He could only imagine how horrible it must have been for Dean to experience it first hand. With just the short amount of time Castiel had known Dean, he knew that the familiar was stubborn and independent. No witch should have taken away his choice.
“What?” Dean finally asked, after about the tenth time Sam had glanced at him.
Castiel blinked through his tears.
Castiel frowned and shifted in his seat. He reached over and took Dean’s hand.
“I missed you too.” Dean replies.
“I am aware.”
"Hurry up!"
"I slept well." Castiel softly replied. He glanced at the clock and saw that it was just past six. Still early. "Would you like breakfast?"
Castiel fell silent and stilled, his mind turning over Alastair's poisonous words. He clenched his jaw and glanced back up at Alastair. He wouldn't let the demon manipulate him like this any longer.
“Yes, a coma. I know this is a lot to process. Would you like some time with your mate before we continue testing?”
Castiel still in the living room for a few moments until he was able to get his brain up and running again. He went to Claire's room to check up on her.
Castiel cleared his throat and stepped back, arms at his side. “I should go.”
Castiel’s heart clenched. He felt guilty, which was absolutely ridiculous because Dean should know better from his own merpeople customs.
“Dean,” Sam sounded disapproving (surprise, surprise), “there’s children around here.”
Jack continued to sniff the air, then he started to squirm. Castiel swallowed past the lump in his throat as he approached Dean. Jack started to struggle even more in Castiel’s hold, so, very carefully, Castiel placed Jack on his belly on Dean’s chest. The nurses had told Castiel that it wouldn’t hurt Dean at all for Jack to be there, but Castiel still eyed the machines nervously. When they continued their steady rhythm, he exhaled.
Dean scowled at his plate until he felt Cas squeeze his hand.
“There’s plenty of salad for you, Sam.” Ellen said kindly. “Don’t listen to your brother.”
Dean liked to appear as a macho-man type. Dean had nothing against girls or women, he had no problem with dominant, alpha females, but Dean just wanted to make it clear to everyone around him that he too was an alpha male. Sam said it was because he had grown up in an environment with toxic masculinity (thanks to John). Dean didn’t know if what Sam said was accurate or not (and he didn’t want to know), but what he
Dean stared at him, looking just as confused as Castiel felt. "What do you mean you don't feel your grace?"
“Should I give you two some space?” Balthazar teased.
Sam went to buy the picture, and Dean was practically hopping by the time he got back because it was their turn to go to Star Wars Land.
Castiel stopped laughing and bit his lip, “Yes, he was implying that you and I would have sex.”
The omega's chest rose softly with each breath. His expression was content and relaxed, which made Castiel happy. Dean's back was pressed against Castiel's chest, and Castiel had an arm wrapped protectively around Dean. It was all very domestic, and he didn't want to move.
“What?”
“Did I hurt you?” He asked, alarmed.
“Oh.” Castiel breathed.
Castiel grew angry. “That was a really terrible thing to do! You scared my friend and me, and for what?”
He wanted to save Dean. He wanted to hold the omega next to him and cradle his face and heal him of his wounds, inside and out.
"Goodbye, Dean." Castiel said.
"Wait."
They’d fallen far back enough that Castiel’s view of the stern was blocked by the bench. He was shaking as he approached it. He needed to see if that thing was still there.
Dean's reserve poured into Castiel, soothing his aches and refueling his magic. He forced his wards to stay strong.
"Probably not." Dean averted his eyes. "I gotta get home."
Castiel slowly reached up to touch his hair, then he brought it down and looked at it.
Castiel blushed. “Well, I wouldn’t say I’m awesome-”
Castiel and Dean stared at one another for a moment, rather awkwardly, until Castiel swallowed and turned to start cooking. He was hyper-aware as he got the eggs from the fridge and started up the stove. It wasn't often that he had company, and Castiel didn't think that he had ever made someone breakfast.
Somehow they end up with Dean straddling Cas’s lap and Cas’s hands on Dean’s hips. It’s fucking hot and it feels fucking perfect.
Castiel gritted his teeth against the onslaught of a forming migraine.
The air flew by them, whipping at their hair. The familiar drop of his stomach made Castiel more nauseous than normal, but that was to be expected since he hadn't flown in a while.
Gabriel glanced at the doorway. “I’d have to ask a nurse and they’d probably check to make sure you’re not in pre-rage or anything, that you’re really good, and then they’d probably let you out. They might bring your pup here, though, so that you don’t upset any of the other pups.”
They went straight to the hotel and Castiel led him to their room. Standing in the elevator together was another test of their wills. It felt like ages before the elevator dinged and the doors opened.
* * * * *
“You’re thankful for the dynamics?” Dean asked, stunned.
Dean groaned.
“Who helped me give Jack the Talk?”
Adam’s classroom looked as one would imagine a first-grade classroom to look. There were tiny desks and chairs set up in clusters towards the front of the room. The front wall had a large whiteboard and Lisa’s desk to the side. In the back was a bookshelf with many kids’ books and several colorful bean-bag chairs. There were a variety of arts and crafts pinned carefully to the wall, and above the bookshelf was a poster with the alphabet and an item for each letter that started with that letter.
Castiel glanced over his shoulder at his brother as he walked to the bedroom door. "Gabe?"
When the doorbell rang, Claire joined Castiel in opening the door.
Just as Castiel was about to call for a nurse, the vibrations stopped and Jack let out a cry. Castiel tried calming him, but Jack wiggled in Castiel’s hold, his nose twitching furiously. His pup-scent went bitter with frustration and need. His eyes darted around the room in a way that Castiel hadn’t seen before.
Dean took his hand and led him to the nest. They got in together. Castiel waited patiently as Dean adjusted all the blankets and pillows into a way that he liked. Dean brushed his hand against Castiel’s chest and then reached for his hand.
Charlie whirled in her seat and leveled him with such a ferocious expression that Dean had to take a step back.
“How long was I asleep?” Castiel asked, rubbing his eyes. He was still very tired, but he felt more rested than he had been for a while.
"Dean, I need to ask you," Ellen looked uncomfortable, "have you been intimate with Castiel?"
His eyelids slipped shut and stayed that way, and he fell back asleep.
A breeze flitted through the trees then, and Dean was assaulted with the smell of ozone and rain. It was so strong it was almost tangible, and Dean blinked and looked up, sure it was about to rain. The glimpses of the sky through the treetops were blue and cloudless.
"Thanks, Cas." He said softly.
Finally, the ferret settled down on Castiel's shoulder. It pressed itself against Castiel's neck, small claws digging through the thin pajama fabric.
The photo there showed the whole family: John, Mary, Dean, and Sam. They were sitting outside on the grass on a blanket. Mary was holding Sam and Dean was sitting on John's lap. John and Mary were sharing a tender look.
“So, I’m sharing with Cas.”
Shaking, Castiel picked up his phone and called the first person he thought could help - Ellen.
Dean squints. “How the fuck do you know my name?”
“No, I asked Gabriel to watch Claire.”
“Primary genders have nothing to do with your designations, Dean.” Charlie said.
"As do I." Castiel tilted his head and then took a gulp of his wine. Gabriel had always said he was a bad liar, but Castiel thought himself decent at the very least.
The demons chuckled to themselves as they shoved Dean back into his cell. Castiel couldn't see him much through the shadows, and that irritated him. The demons still laughed as they left.
“I’m not an idiot. I know how you and all the other jocks are, arrogant and entitled. Everyone loves you because of your capabilities and not your actual personality.”
Dean would have been touched if he wasn’t so excited to write a letter to Sammy. He was going to tell him everything.
Things were finally starting to feel like they were going in his direction.
the man was an employee of his, but he wasn't completely sure. His clothing suggested that he didn't work here, but maybe he took the day off and he had forgotten something.
Castiel started jogging down the hall until he reached Dean’s room. The door was shut, but Castiel peeked in anyways.
Dean shook his head. "I trust you to be professional as well."
“Yeah,” Sam answered, “It’s not nearly as reliable, though. Plus, there’s way less stuff. Some people claim to encounter creatures, but it’s pretty obviously fake.”
“Oh.”
“No, it’s not.” Castiel argued.
, but brainy’s the new sexy.”
Gabriel looked at him just long enough to make Dean start to squirm before he replied. “I know that the feeling is mutual. Anyways, I must be going now. I hope to see you again soon, but I’m rather unpredictable so there is no knowing when that will be. Pleasure meeting you, Prince Dean.”
“So alphas do the protecting and the fighting, omegas have kids, and betas just do whatever?” Dean said.
“Hm, something about that suit,” Dean said, pulling back, “I love it on you.”
. He jogged after Cas, completely forgetting Baby’s open doors, and grabbed Cas by his shoulder so he could spin him around.
"Don't know. Probably Ellen or Bobby. We visited them sometimes, I think."
That week’s family dinner was one of the best. With Dean back, everything felt more cheerful and genuine. While the majority of their family members cooed over Jack or caught up with Dean, Castiel spent most of his time simply taking it in.
The other man blinked several times, also stunned by the surprise encounter.
Castiel raked his brain for the name 'Winchester.' He knew he had not heard of it. It did not make sense that someone of that family would have critical knowledge. Why choose to have the family outside of heaven, too? Surely, if the family was that valuable, they would avoid earth and demons at all cost.
"Dean." Castiel gestured to Dean, still in his koala form.
“Why?” Dean asks. “I asked you, Cas, if you knew me. Why would you lie?”
"Claire have you had dinner?" Castiel asked.
"This is cookie dough." Dean told Castiel. "I used an egg substitute, so you can eat it raw. I know it's the week, but in case Claire earns herself some dough or some cookies."
Dean moved away from Castiel's neck and settled on his lips. Their first kiss was rough and rushed, barely lips and mostly a clash of teeth. Dean was desperate, and, apparently, so was Castiel. They kissed again, slower and more passionately. Castiel did his best to drown out the demonic background noises. He moved his hands to stroke through Dean's wings, making the omega moan and shift against him.
“Hey, he was keeping me, his very pregnant mate, company.” Dean protested.
The demons returned Castiel to his cell without another word. They seemed to be satisfied from his beatings.
Castiel sucked his breath in sharply. He ran his hands tentatively over the lock again, just to be certain that they were truly bigger.
“He’s going into Alpha-rage, we’re going to need to get the guards.”
"Dean, what the hell is going on?" Ellen demanded. She did not lower the rifle.
“Fuck, I had no idea that you had a twin,” Dean pressed his hands against his face. “Why the hell didn’t you mention that?”
“Herm?” Cas murmurs, fighting sleep.
"Here," Castiel said, "if you sit next to me you will be able to receive some of my body heat." Castiel could feel Dean's hesitation.
"Cas?" Dean's voice called tentatively before the familiar stepped out of the shop to join Castiel.
"I was wonderin' since it was a male omega angel," Bobby said, his voice faint, "but you didn't say it was him."
There was a beat of silence.
Something tickles at the back of his brain. A memory.
"Yes." Castiel gently moved Claire back and sat up. "I'm getting ready."
“I think you are in heat.” Castiel repeated. “I can scent it.”
He hissed and drew his hand to his chest.
Dean looked incredulously at him. "Have you never played?"
“I’m -  I’m scared.”
As much as Dean enjoyed the rides, they were far from the highlight of the trip.
. Dean yelps and tightens his arms around Cas’s neck as his legs wrap around Cas’s waist.
The room suddenly smelled sharply of shock. The humans stared at them, their jaws slack.
The office had two desks against one wall, each with a computer, and bookshelves against the other wall. There was an armchair in the corner, next to a lamp. Dean went straight to the books. He normally hated research, but he was very eager to get home to a universe where weird things like alphas and betas and omegas didn’t exist. It frustrated him a little bit that Sam seemed to have given up already. It wasn’t really like him, but he had been here for already a week.
“That is a much better idea.”
“Hey, alpha.” Dean purred in his ear. “You look sexy like this.”
“We pick things up, I guess.” Dean said. “Other merpeople spend more time with humans, so they kind of bring back human culture. I’ve been watching humans for years, but today, for the first time, I decided to investigate.”
gaze.
Y'all can probably tell, but I'm not very experienced at writing intimate / heated scenes so it's a bit of a learning process here... bear with me as I start trying new things lol
“I told you, you stupid fuck. You fucked up my son.”
Instantly, Ellen was aiming a rifle at he newcomers. Castiel had no idea where she'd gotten it, but he found his respect for her increasing.
He moved forward without registering it and pulled Dean into a possessive hug. He slipped his hands down to Dean’s hips and stroked at the bare skin there.
Dean shifted. “Cas, I know we haven’t talked about it a lot, and I’m sorry if it’s not something you want right now, but I think that this is something I want and-”
"Oh, you're awake."
“Thank you.” He murmured. He longed to fall into Cas’s hold again.
“This Ms. Braeden’s room?” A voice called out. Dean glanced over at the doorway, his nerves practically ricocheting. An alpha stood in the doorway, his arms crossed.
Dean nodded at him. They stared at each other, awkward again, until Dean left the library.
"He's your family." Ellen said sympathetically. "You can be upset."
“Sorry.” He says quickly.
"Not really." Dean said.
A sudden crack of leaves from behind Castiel had him whirling around to face the new intruder. The sulfuric scent had returned and it was stronger than before.
Despite Castiel’s original anxiety about meeting with everyone, the lunch went very well. It was more subdued without Dean there, and Castiel knew that he was on everyone’s minds, but they managed to enjoy themselves anyways. Jack got a lot of attention, too, which he didn’t appear to mind. It made Castiel a little protective to watch Jack from afar as the others fawned over him, but he reminded himself that these people were his family and that the pup wouldn’t be safer anywhere else.
“Get him something with bees.” Charlie said. “Maybe a new shirt?”
"Sorry, man." Dean sighed. "I wish I knew what they thought I knew. I want to get out of here."
Dean hurts.
In the worst of his dreams, Dean watches Cas get hurt, and even die, over and over in various ways. When he wakes up he feels relief. At least he knows that those dreams aren’t real.
“I'm very sorry.” Castiel said, wanting to bury himself under his covers, “I’m so embarrassed.”
"Mr. Novak?"
The thoughts kept coming back.
He was sitting on a soft cot in a small room. There was only a tiny oil lamp in the corner. Across from Castiel was another cot with a blanket covering a winged figure.
Okay I absolutely love isolated/powerful Cas and injured Dean who's still super cool and I also love writing dean as a ferret because I think ferrets are adorable
“You’re looking well. Your nanny was free, then?”
Anyways... let me know what you think (I really loved Castiel's nail polish idk about you guys but it made me so happy... is it too obvious that I made it rainbow???)
There was a beat of silence.
“Nah, don’t sweat it. We’re just glad you’re finally getting some food and some rest. You need it.”
Castiel put Claire to bed and then got ready for bed himself. By the time he had showered and changed, Claire had somehow made her way to Castiel's bed, even though he had been certain she was asleep. He sighed and made himself comfortable on his side of the bed.
“Lovely to have you.” Mrs. Kelly said, smiling sweetly.
Castiel visibly swallows, and his voice cracks as he answers, “Nice to meet you too, Dean.”
* * * * *
"Sheesh. Good luck with that. But anyways, I'm happy for you." Gabriel said. "Claire deserves stability and so do you."
It was one of the loveliest days that Dean had ever spent with Cas. They didn’t speak much, but Dean found comfort in Cas’s company alone.
“I see. Is it just your brother you miss?”
“Stop.” Sam says. “You’re being weird, dude.”
Dean nodded, eyes downcast.
Damn, if that wasn’t hard to unpack.
"If I recall correctly," Castiel growled, no longer in the mood to play nice, "the reason you are looking for work as a nanny is because you were fired from your position as an elementary teacher."
Castiel glanced over his shoulder and found that Dean looked every bit uncertain and curious as Gabriel felt.
“Babysitter for you or babysitter for Jack? ‘Cause I’d actually love to be that pup’s sitter.”
"No." Dean answered. "My dad got mad every time I mentioned my mom after she died, so I only know what I remember from before."
"Up and at 'em, little birdies." One demon said. Castiel glared and glanced at Dean. The angel beside him was pale in the morning light. He had dark bags underneath his eyes and dirt smudge on his cheek. Castiel thought he looked breathtaking.
Claire was nearly done with the salad Dean had given to her.
Maybe he'd been running from the demon.
Castiel dropped his head. “Yes, you do. I didn’t want to lie to you, Dean, that hadn’t been my intention. My uncle, King Charles, died in battle against Hell’s forces. Michael was slain as well, and Lucifer went missing. Though we weren’t sure whether or not he was dead, the Council urged me to uphold the alliance. They said that if Lucifer turned out to be alive, he would go through with it too, and if he didn’t turn out to be alive, at least our wedding would already be set in stone. His body was never found, but he was decreed dead two weeks after he went missing, the very day that you and I met.”
Dean relaxed and then jumped up onto the couch near Castiel. He kneaded a pillow a couple of times before laying down and making himself comfortable. Castiel couldn't help the quirk of his lips at the sight.
Castiel was watching him with a thoughtful expression. He squeezed Dean’s hand softly.
Not this.
Dean was only given a few more minutes of quiet contemplation (moping) before he heard a knock at his door.
Charlie blinked, her eyes widening.
“Cool.” Dean looked away.
Castiel flapped, testing the strength in his wings.
"Good." Dean said. "You're too young to die."
Part of Castiel was concerned that something had happened. A much larger part was already cursing and swearing because of what was about to come.
"Oh." Dean said. He sounded more subdued.
Castiel woke with a start, his heart racing.
"No!" Castiel shook his head vigorously. "It's not about me! It was for Dean!"
"Yeah, that's fine." Dean nodded.
“Yeah! Thank God Sam knows how to check vitals, otherwise I woulda thought you were dead.”
"Really, guys?" Sam asked, sounding exasperated.
“Not that I don’t appreciate bees, Dean, but I’m afraid I don’t understand.”
But his chest aches and his head is spinning and he can’t for the life of him figure out why Cas would lie to him about this.
“Joanna Beth, don’t be rude to Castiel,” Mrs. Harvelle scolded. She nodded at Castiel. “You go ahead, Castiel.”
“Dean!” One of Dean’s friends waved from the other end of the library and pointed at her watch. She looked sheepish when the librarian shushed her and glared.
"Oh?" Castiel couldn't help that he was interested, and his scent changed accordingly.
Dean looked away before he retold everything he'd said to Bobby. Sam was quiet throughout Dean's explanation, but he looked sad at the end.
big." Claire said, stomping a foot. "I have big-girl books!"
Castiel’s tongue felt thick in his mouth, “Of course, Dean, it was no problem. I’m glad to have gotten to know you.”
“Good! So, you’re eating the food we brought and you’re going to let us help you take care of Jack. Okay?”
"Thank you." He said, ducking his head. He cleared his throat. "What are you getting?"
"You'd come too, wouldn't you, Castiel?" April asked.
“Thank you.”
"Hello, Dean." Castiel said.
Castiel pursed his lips in concentration, then gave a quick shake of his head. “No. In fact, I cannot reach my grace.”
"He's gone." Castiel said. "Dead."
“Good.” Castiel nodded to himself and led them towards Dean’s room.
This time, though, instead of simply sitting down on a chair on the other side of the room, Dean stood next to Castiel. Castiel looked up at him and cocked his head.
"Pizza!" Adam said, as he always did.
Castiel’s stomach fluttered anxiously as Castiel entered his room and sat down on his bed. The conversation at dinner had left him feeling uneasy.
“Can you guys not make out for five seconds?”
"Word gets around." Garth shrugged. "Most of us humans know what's going on in Heaven."
“Do you like it?” Dean asked, borderline desperate.
None of these names fit the name he’s thinking, longing for.
"Dean!" Charlie exclaimed, standing. "What are you doing here?"
"If you want, little man." Dean said.
"Okay!" Claire hopped down from her chair and started looking in her closet. "I'm choosing my outfit!"
Much to Castiel’s frustration, with every tutoring session it became more and more obvious why Dean was such a well-liked student. He was annoyingly charming and pleasant to be around. He would always ask Castiel about his day and his favorite classes. Sometimes he brought Castiel leftover cookies he’d made over the weekend. He was attentive and polite during their tutoring sessions, the perfect student.
"He's really responsible." Dean said. "I talked to him about it before decided to take the job."
“Explain!” Dean snapped. He could already feel his eyes filling with tears. “I need you to explain right now! I deserve that much!”
"Claire is usually well-behaved, but even then it can be overwhelming." Castiel replied. April's scent filled with sympathy.
"Hi, Sam!" Adam said, grinning cheerily up at Sam.
"Hey!" Gabriel protested.
“Okay.” Castiel says, and that’s it.
"Okay, enough of this sissy, chic-flick crap." Dean said, stepping forward and waving his hands. "What's been up with you two?"
Dean looked to the entrance of the kitchen. “Yeah, buddy?”
“I didn’t do anything to Dean,” Castiel growled past the bitterness in the back of his throat.
The movie was about mid-way when Castiel entered the living room. He sat next to Claire. Their positions were similar to Tuesday, when Dean and Castiel had watched Phineas and Ferb with the kids, except they were closer.
“Sam, I’m going to slap you.”
"Thank you, darling." Alastair purred, sauntering away.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!" Dean snapped. He marched up to Castiel and glared at him with his hands on his hips.
"Yup."
The angel was much too careful as he tore the wrapping paper. He frowned at the white box that was revealed, probably curious as to what it would be. He opened the box and moved the additional tissue paper to look at the material inside.
. He licked his lips.
"Well," Gabriel said slowly, "That is kind of a lot to process."
"I'll get it!" Claire yelled from the other room.
Dean stared back at him with half-lidded eyes and nodded.
also I took some liberties when describing heaven... I've decided that Center Heaven is the exact center of heaven (obviously) and as you go out you reach the next levels or rims of heaven (sort of like lord of the rings with Gondor) in Center Heaven that's the capital and all and as you go out you reach the farmland and stuff so that's why there's more nature n stuff
“Coma?” Dean asked, his face pale.
"Oh." Dean looked back to Gabriel, who smiled smugly. "Er, okay, I guess. Just let me get my clothes on."
Too many times, Castiel found himself laughing against his will. Dean always had the most entertaining stories or jokes that he bombarded Castiel with, despite Castiel’s protests that they had no time to do anything else but study.
wanted to leave Dean, but he had to be responsible for Jack’s sake.
Castiel smiled.
Gabriel puffed out his chest. “I just wanted to say that I am happy to be alive and I am happy to be back with you fabulous people. Well, most of you. I’m grateful to be doing the horizontal tango with Sam.”
to see Castiel.
“No, it’s not your fault, Dean. You couldn’t have known.” Castiel sighs. “I do want you, I just don’t know…”
"Takes one to know one."
"Even better than me?" Castiel teased.
He knew Cas loved bees and gardening.
Castiel glanced down at himself, then back up at Dean. “I believe that I am well.”
Instead, Castiel settled for reaching across Dean's chest and settling his hand over Dean's heart. He could feel the beat rhythmically against his injured palm, though it was worryingly slow.
“Hm.” The waitress hums.
wow guys it's been a while... hopefully with quarantine and spring break I'll really be able to get this fic up and running
Castiel had dropped his baby bag by Dean’s bed when he’d entered, and he turned to get it. Abruptly, Jack’s scent calmed and he stopped squirming. Castiel paused, already bent towards the bag, and straightened. He watched Jack carefully and noticed the pup’s eyes were fixed.. Castiel followed the pup’s gaze to Dean’s still form. Slowly, it clicked.
Some of you guess Dean’s predicament, so good job lol poor Dean bean and I love protective and caring Cas
Sam looked back to Dean. "Why'd you leave, man? What happened?"
Castiel tried not to let his sorrow show. Fading was something he'd never really dealt with. It only happened in extremely rare cases when an angel was absolutely finished with life and longed for death. Castiel supposed it made sense, but it hurt to hear.
"Were you playing with them?"
"You gotta brush from the bottom up." Dean explained as he stood back and let Claire admire herself in the mirror. "Get the tangles out at the bottom so that the higher ones can just slide all the way down. Otherwise they get all clumped together and you've got an even bigger mess."
* * * * *
They weren't even a quarter of the way in when the horns sounded, this time no longer echoing against the gorge walls. Castiel risked a glance back and nearly tripped and fell.
Often, Castiel found himself worrying about when Dean would leave. He'd already adjusted so quickly to the familiar's presence, it would be difficult to get back to normal without Dean. But Dean never gave any indication that he wanted to leave. He never said anything about his past or his future. Castiel was a bit curious, but he respected Dean's privacy. The last thing he wanted to do was scare Dean away by asking too many intrusive questions.
"Did you get into a fight or something?" He questioned. He knew he was pushing his boundaries, but Dean had hardly spoken of his past since arriving.
"I will!" Claire said cheerfully. She skipped back to Gabriel. Castiel waved at them once more before he turned and left.
“Chill, man, it’s just a little cut.” Dean tried to move around Cas, but the angel blocked him and held out his hand.
"Bye, Mr. De!" Claire said. She hugged him and then they both watched the omega leave.
Magic flowed from Dean in just a small trickle. It was almost gone.
"Oh," Castiel said, taken aback, "thank you, Dean. That was very thoughtful of you."
They headed out of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge and into FrontierLand. The only ride they went on was the Great Thunder Mountain. Unsurprisingly, Dean was paired up with Cas in the rollercoaster’s train. The Great Thunder Mountain was another ride that Dean enjoyed, though not as much as Indiana Jones. Dean had thought that FrontierLand would mean cowboys, so he was disappointed when he didn’t see any.
The tall man marched forward in two powerful strides and enveloped Dean in a hug.
"Dean, no." Castiel turned to his familiar and grabbed onto his shoulders desperately. Dean met his eyes, but already Castiel could see that he had made his decision.
"Mr. De?" Castiel asked, an eyebrow quirking.
He felt his magic flare angrily and suddenly his hair stood on end, static sparking at the tips of each strand.
“Alpha, you need to stay calm.”
“Well, I’m not the one forcing him to run two-hundred miles a day.”
It wouldn't have been a problem, except Castiel still found Dean incredibly attractive (and more so now that they were friends) and now he knew Dean could potentially reciprocate his feelings.
Apologies for not updating last week... for summer break I'm surprisingly busy thanks for you patience!!!
Castiel nodded.
“What’s your name?” The merman asked.
"I'll see what I can do." Castiel answered, his mind already whirling. He could ask Dean if he was available, but he doubted Dean would be able to stay the entire weekend. Now that Castiel knew about Dean's pup, it was easier to understand why the omega would be busy.
“Something's clearly bothering you,” he insisted.
"Does that make you feel better?" Castiel asked, voice low.
Dean was surprised to receive a text from Charlie the next evening that said she had given his information to her boss who was looking for a permanent nanny, and that he was interested despite Dean's secondary gender and lack of higher education. Dean tried not to get his hopes up too much. There was always a chance that Charlie's boss just wouldn't hire him.
“What happened?”
Dean blinks at him. “So… does that mean you
EDIT (4/9/20): I put the wrong age here for Dean (he's twenty-seven) but thank you to Ettelven for pointing it out :)
“Hm. Interesting.” Dean said. “And you’re okay with holding a dude’s hand?”
Dean smacked his lips and hummed. “Why not? Tastes salty.”
"You sell any produce?" Dean asked. He was looking around the garden with an impressed expression. It made Castiel proud.
“You don’t gotta patronize me, Cas-”
“What are you doing here?” He asked again, trying to keep his voice from wavering.
"Ohhh." Dean hummed. He met Castiel's eyes briefly and winked,
Dean made a show of rolling his eyes and holding his hand out for inspection. Cas stared at the cut on his finger, his mouth pulling into a somber thin line.
“Oh, Dean,” Charlie’s voice softened, “Is that what you’re worried about?”
“I’m going to fucking kill that nurse. Just breathe, my ass. Fuck!”
"You're not naming them Po?"
Castiel focused his attention on keeping them steady and above the clouds. It was beautiful up in the sky. Castiel had missed this feeling. He felt free.
“No, he’s a beta.” Castiel corrected.
“This decision is final, Dean.” John snapped.
Castiel slammed himself aggressively against the bars of his cell, snarling as hissing as he did, his wings splayed out wide and aggressive.
“Brother?” Cute Guy quirks a brow. “So you two aren’t dating?”
“What do you mean?”
"I think so." Castiel answered. "Claire likes him."
Dean ducked his head like a scolded child. "Yeah, yeah."
Castiel ducked his head. "I'm sorry for springing this on you."
Male omegas were not exactly common, so it took Castiel by surprise a little. He didn't have anything against male omegas, though (as some people did). Castiel did not think that the fact that the man was an omega would really make a difference, even though it may not be the more traditional route.
"What do you need?" Castiel asked.
He'd failed.
"You're not out of the doghouse yet." Dean said sternly. "But you've made a start."
Cat-Dean closed his eyes and began to shimmer once more. Then, the cat was replaced by a large German shepherd.
Something was wrong.
yellow warbler: diversity, freedom, energy, progression, power
Castiel cleaned up the dishes after dinner since Dean had cooked, then he retired to the living room to read. Dean often sat with him without speaking. Castiel had asked him before if he got bored, but Dean insisted he did not.
Castiel hummed and pressed a fond kiss to Dean’s face.
“Then what was that blush about?”
He shakes his head. “I don’t
"You will regret this!" He spat, glaring darkly at the demon guards who watched him with disgustingly amused and smug looks.
Sam and Gabe told Castiel all about their new puppy. Apparently, they were at odds when it came to raising it.
“Where’s the kid, then?”
"You'll be fine, Sammy, okay? Let's just get back, there's a lot to talk about."
"Where have you been?"
“Me neither.” Sam admitted. Dean wanted to be able to tease him about it, but he felt too sick to do so.
Castiel knocked again.
“You don’t truly love me, do you?”
“Hey, time with family is awesome. No shame in spending time with your brothers.”
"I gotta lot of shit in my past, man." Dean said guardedly. "You okay with that?"
“Good morning.” His guard greeted. He met Dean’s eyes, then tilted his head and frowned. “Is everything alright?”
"Fuck, this is bad." A voice cursed from above.
"I said I can turn into any animal." Dean said, sounding annoyed.
“You big baby.” He said. “I’ll be gone for, like, two minutes, at the most.”
Dean’s house was a smaller size, but the front yard was large. There were several large trees, one of which had a rope swing. A few baseball bats, baseballs, and gloves were strewn around the lawn. Castiel was careful not to step on anything as he approached the front door.
Today was not any other day, though.
Dean received an email from Charlie's boss (it took him an embarrassingly long time to figure out that 'novakind' was for 'Novak industries' and not 'Nova kind.') later in the evening and he sent one of his own.
His voice was somewhat awed, but that made sense. Castiel had been trying out new things ever since Jack had forcefully broken his deal with the Empty. He was excited to be happy again.
"Oh." Jo said, eyes squinting. "Could have fooled us. Your scent is all over him."
"It's obvious." Dean replied. "And it's clear that you're doing a great job with her."
Castiel thought he could fill a book with poetic descriptions of Dean's beauty. His eyes drew Castiel's attention first, with them being bright and clear and as green as a forest. His other features, though, they were lovely too. His nose and cheeks were sculpted, and his lips were pink and perfect. Light freckles dotted over Dean's cheeks and nose, a gorgeous dust against his skin.
He melts against Cas and Cas holds him together.
“Claire, we do not know why Amelia never returned.” Castiel said bluntly. “I choose to believe it’s because she knew that you would get all the love you needed right here with your dad and me. You can choose to believe whatever you want, Claire, but what you should always know is that your dad and I love you so,
“A month and a half, huh?” Dean asked.
"Something with broccoli." Sam said.
“Don’t worry, Dean. Is there something specific that you had in mind for today?”
Castiel's phone buzzed in his pocket, shaking him from his thoughts. He glanced at it and saw that Balthazar had texted to ask where he was.
"It is a pleasure to meet you, Samuel. I've heard about you from Dean. I am glad I could assist him in escaping."
Dean stops having nightmares on Thursday nights, but they return with a vengeance right after. It’s really starting to weigh on Dean’s mind because he suspects they’re more than figments of his imagination.
Castiel was unable to maintain the spell anymore and it dropped. He fell to the ground, strength leaving him quickly and leaving him sick and shaky.
"Nope." Dean said. "The demons are assholes."
-cap out-
"Thank you, Dean."
"Okay." Claire said. "Why is he busy this weekend?"
"Fuck off, buddy." He said, teeth bared.
Castiel dutifully followed his mother into the massive house. They walked through the entrance way to the dining room, where everyone was already seated.
"He doesn't, at first." Dean shrugged.
"It is." Mr. Kelly answered. "But it won't be too cold, and the tourists will be gone. Liliane and I enjoy spending the holiday there. Perhaps we should go for a weekend though?"
"Did Castiel do the same in return?" Michael asked. "Did he tell you that he's scared of himself and so he hides in the middle of nowhere like a coward?"
Dean was so distracted and amused by the family of ducks that he did not really register the family sitting at the table next to Dean’s until the daughter, a young blond toddler, gasped loudly in delight.
none of my business. My apologies." He looked back at his book and pointedly ignored Dean.
No matter what his son claimed, Dean definitely did not know Hank. He looked to Cas for help.
"Okay."
“There’s a picture here!” Charlie shouted when their log paused. “Make sure you smile!”
"Papa!" Claire yelled. "Someone's here!"
Sam was last again.
Castiel and Dean practically jumped from ledge to ledge for the rest of the way, both stressed and terrified. They were weaponless and it would still be at least a week until Castiel could try to fly again.
"Yup." The woman pushed herself off of Castiel and brushed herself off. Then she reached down to take Castiel's hand and pull him up.
"I did not force him into anything."
Damn, Cas’s eyes were so blue.
Castiel smiled. “I hope so too, Dean.”
Castiel kept his face and scent neutral. He did not want Alastair to have anymore ammunition.
could you tell I was attempting to describe Castiel smiting Michael? probably not - but at least Michael got what he was due
Castiel only had one number on his phone, but he did not hesitate to press on the contact and dial the number.
Castiel snarled.
"My, um, my brain is big." Gabriel said.
"Incredible." Castiel breathed, crouching to get a better look. Dean stared back at him impassively. He sat down and curled his tail delicately around his paws.
Angels hardly ever got sick, though they could if they were weakened, so it wasn't unlikely that Dean was just sick.
“If you’re asking if I’m attracted to men, Dean, then the answer is yes.”
"I don't know, Cas!" He said, hands raising up placatingly. "I swear, I have no fucking clue!"
"Uh-" Castiel broke off, panicked and stressed, "I'll do it."
"Nice to meet you, Dean." The man said. "I'm Castiel."
Let me know what you think & I love y'all :)
“What?”
Thanks to everyone who waited patiently and continued to read when I missed my post dates and also thanks to everyone who read this fic in general lol
"It's hard to say." Castiel mused. "A couple of days to Earth, probably. But I'm not sure how quickly we'll be able to get to Heaven from Earth. If we spot an angel patrol, then much quicker. If not, then I don't know. A week maybe."
Dean's hands felt amazing as he made his way through Castiel's wings. The ache in Castiel's oil glands finally eased. His wings get much better with the oil. They felt powerful again. Not nearly as strong as he once had been, but still strong.
Castiel moved to their bathroom and started up the shower. Dean joined him as the water was heating.
Castiel could not explain the relief he felt knowing that Adam was Dean's brother. It wasn't that he thought less of Dean for having a pup, but it made Castiel feel good to know that Dean wasn't in a relationship with someone. Although, it was still possible that Dean was in a relationship, even if Adam wasn't his biological pup.
Tentatively, Dean opened his eyes.
After lunch, Castiel spent time restocking his store. Dean sat on a chair in the corner and fiddled with his thumbs. He seemed to be drifting off, his head would bob up and down ever-so-often, like he was trying to stay awake.
Silently, Castiel mourned the loss. Dean was a charismatic character, one of the only nannies that Castiel had actually enjoyed the presence of. It would be a shame to never see him again.
Dean’s lips parted. His eyes were searching. “Why?”
“So, if it had been you that I was asking, would you have said yes?” Dean questioned.
I thought this was a cute idea so hopefully I executed it well lol
"He didn't pick up." Dean said. "I'm sure it won't be long. You want to go see some moose?"
“Fuck. I should get amnesia more often.”
“You want
Dean had always been a brash man, first as a pup and then as an omega, which had been far less acceptable in Winchester. In any way, Dean hadn’t cared for sitting around and waiting for something to happen, he liked to take charge and do things. With so little time left, Dean figured that it was time to make a move, damn the consequences.
“What can I do to help?” Charlie asked, her voice softening.
"What?" Castiel felt his face scrunch up. He was utterly baffled. He had never heard of an angel that hadn't been to heaven before. "Then, where were you born? Where did you grow up?"
“What about April?” Charlie asked, and Dean immediately darkened at her name.
“I did.” Castiel stood. “I have to go.”
the appetite last night so I am starving."
So... how did y'all like that?? >:) hehe I'm not sorry
"You like this angel, baby?" He teased. Dean looked away. "You want to keep him."
The boy rolled his eyes and waved his hand at the other end of the library where a group of students were sitting. “My stupid friends bet me twenty bucks that I wouldn’t hold your hand. I’ll give you half, if you want.”
“I told you there was something in the water!” Castiel cried out in reply.
The first of the two big drops came in the middle of the ride and it was
“Contraction.” The nurses said knowingly. “Just keep breathing.”
"I'm sorry to hear that." The man said, his voice sympathetic. "I know the feeling."
Dean only whined pitifully from his corner and shuddered.
This wasn't at all how Castiel expected the day to go, but he was far from complaining.
Slowly, Castiel bookmarked his page and put his book down. “Oh?”
“I guess I forgot,” Dean answered, smirking. “C’mon, let’s go.”
Castiel blinked at his brother. He looked back at his legs, still tied up in the blanket.
Dean felt his heart catch in his throat as he stammered out a reply. “Ye-ah. That sounds good.”
He had no idea how long they stood in their bedroom, hugging, but Dean thought it was probably the safest and happiness he’d felt in a very long time.
“Well, yeah,” Charlie said, “But I meant the other thing.”
I don't own Supernatural
John crossed his arms. “What? You going to make me?”
Castiel did not resent it or hold it against Gabriel at all. He knew that Gabriel had his own problems to deal with and having someone as miserable and cynic as Castiel around only served to trigger Gabriel, so he had needed to put some space between them. Maybe it would have been different if Castiel had taken Gabriel's advice and seen a psychic-witch.
“No, I should apologize. I was kind of a dick to you after class today.”
“I need help.” Castiel said, not waiting for her to say hello. “I can’t remember how to make the formula.”
“You can try, Dean, but I don’t think it’s going to help much. There’s not really any valid sources.”
"I remember enough." He said, not meeting Castiel's eyes. "I'm feeling a little under the weather."
No longer fearful or panicked, Castiel leaned forward so his nose nearly brushed Dean's.
"You're his witch?" Bobby questioned, his voice a growl.
"Pizza?" Gabriel gasped. "On a Monday? Who are you and what have you done with my brother?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The ferret sneezed. It shook itself off, sending droplets of water flying. Its fur stood up on end, rather cutely.
Castiel found Dean in a stall leaning over the toilet, his wings taut behind him.
“Let me go so that I can get my own suit on.”
“Where are we?”
Have fun :)
“Yeah, you’d better not. Cassie was an absolute mess.”
"By the way, I would know the difference whether we watched or not. This way is more fun for me."
Castiel blinked, his heartbeat quickening.
“If it works we won’t have to explain.” Cas points out.
Around noon the trees thinned excessively until they came to a tree line and a wide field lay in front of them. Past the field was a gorge, and past the gorge was another field that led to a different forest. The rocky gorge lay that in front of them separated Hell from Earth. To get to Earth they would have to travel down into the gorge and then climb back on the other side. It wasn't terribly deep or wide, but it would still take much of their time and energy to get across. Wooden and stone remnants of long-destroyed bridges could be seen along the edge of Hell's side, a harsh reminder of the demons' multiple attempts to make their access to Earth easier.
“You don’t know that.”
Jimmy made a thoughtful noise. “So Dean’s never actually done anything to you, personally, but you don’t like him because he’s a jock and all jocks are jerks?”
“Are you mad at me?”
have blood on my hands. Some days I can’t stand to look at myself in the mirror, ‘cause all I see are bodies.”
love me some jealous cas and families of choice
As Castiel ran to the hospital from the car, he fumbled for his phone and pressed on Sam’s contact.
Dean shifted and averted his gaze. "Yep."
“Right.”
“Hey, man. Sorry I’m late. Got caught talking.”
“Well, why are you doing it to me?”
They walked down to the library entrance together, shoulders nearly brushing. Dean gave Cas a smile and a wave as they started to part their separate ways.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice shook. “Has it really been, God, a month and a half?”
Castiel went back to his room and got a few of his older pajamas, just some sweats and a soft shirt.
Hedgehog Dean^^^
"Dean, hurry and open mine." Castiel looked down the hallways of the dungeons. He didn't see any demon, but better safe than sorry.
“Not at all. I’m flattered, actually.” Castiel shook his head and ran his thumb across the back of Dean’s hand.
“Mary. Yeah.” Gabriel finished, tone solemn.
A second later, there was a man with bright green eyes straddling Castiel's chest and pinning Castiel's arms down.
“It was nice seeing you, Dean. Have a great break.” Castiel said.
(also, I did not proof read this, because I guess that's not something I do anymore lol)
-cap out-
He looked around, expecting to see a boatful of laughing idiots, but there was no boat in sight.
Something like adrenaline flooded Castiel's veins and he breathed in deeply. He really hadn't expected Dean to be okay with it. Castiel never thought he would have the chance to have a familiar, even with just a temporary bond, and he was
“Sweetheart,” Dean took a step towards her, “look, I know that you’re upset. It’s perfectly fine to be upset. But you can’t go taking it out on your dad like that. It’s not fair to him or you. Maybe if we just take some deep breaths-”
?" Dean repeated. "Shit, I don't know a lot about this war but I do know that you should not be here."
"Yes, I suppose." Castiel sighed. "Mother dropped by."
"Indeed." Castiel agreed, sighing in resignation. The angels would not save them now.
The familiar stood in the doorway and shifted. He radiated discomfort.
Castiel kept going.
"Not at all." Castiel said.
The only parts of his days that Dean actually looked forward to were the times that Dean got to speak with Castiel.
"Yeah, of course." Dean said. He stood and took Adam's hand as he faced Mr. Novak again. "Adam, say hi to Mr. Novak."
“Alright, that’s enough.” Dean interrupted. “Charlie, no fighting the kid over a dumb game.”
Unless, Dean was a really strong angel. Perhaps on the level of an archangel. An angel at the level of an archangel seemed absurd.
Gabriel's wings (yellow warbler) ^
“I am,” He said, internally bracing himself.
“There you two are!” Charlie said. “You made us do all the work! Not you, Dean, of course.”
"Mhm." Claire hummed.
Naomi slipped her arm under his and elegantly led him to their table. It was to the front and near the center, of course.
: Employment
Squirrel Dean^^
"Bitch." Dean replied, but Castiel knew he was feeling emotional.
“I know, Cassie, but-”
Dean paused briefly in the doorway, still unused to seeing Charlie, original Charlie, alive and well. She was another byproduct of the Jack versus Chuck debacle. There had been a blinding flash when Jack finally Kirby-ed Chuck, and then Charlie was standing in front of them, just as shocked as they were.
“No! You should not be listening to him. Listen, lil bro, you’re probably the best thing that happened to Dean.”
"Papa, let's go!" Claire shouted. Castiel nodded to Dean, hoping that showed his appreciation, and left to get the last of his things ready.
Castiel nodded. “Jimmy is my
It was heartwarming to see all of Dean’s and his friends and family sitting together.
The rollercoaster started up. It moved to the beginning of the track and stopped, then jolted forward with a sudden burst of speed that made Dean feel like his stomach was left behind.
“Jack.” Castiel softly corrected.
Castiel had to turn away and grip at the counter.
He knocked on Claire's door softly and then waited. When no reply came, Castiel hesitantly opened the door and peeked inside the room.
In general, Castiel didn’t really think much about sex. He enjoyed it, sure, but it hadn’t been something he or Amelie had actively sought out. April was a very beautiful omega, but Castiel at this time Castiel wasn’t sure what he wanted from her.
Dean shuffled forward until his arms were wrapped around Castiel’s shoulders and Castiel’s hands slipped all the way down to Dean’s waist.
About three weeks into his stay, Dean decided he was tired of moping around his bedroom and he wanted to do some exploring.
“But anyways, let’s get back to you and Castiel.”
Castiel went back to working, very aware that Dean was staring at his back.
powerful."
to, but I wanted to help him because I knew that some other witches wanted to force him to bond. He knew that Jess and I actually wanted to form a bond, so he said no whenever I offered. He's selfless like that."
“Is it?” Castiel looked at Dean. “Why?”
to angels like you."
?” Castiel asked, ignoring how stupid it sounded.
“Remember to keep your eyes down as you walk down the aisle, you’re not supposed to see another alpha until you see your Intended.”
“Yeah.” Charlie nodded. “For what it’s worth, I think that you’ve been very brave and strong all these years, raising your brothers.”
When Claire's eyes started to get droopy and glazed over, Castiel figured it was time to call it a night. He picked her picked and carried her to her room. He got her ready for bed and tucked in. He didn't read to her, she was already asleep.
Gritting his teeth, Castiel flapped his wings with as much strength as he could spare. They rose higher in the sky, wavering slightly.
He grabbed Dean by the hand and started leading him to the kitchen.
“Yes, of course!” Castiel interrupted. He threw out his hand. “I’d love to hold your hand, and to go out with you.”
Thank you again to everyone who read this and I truly hoped you enjoyed this final chapter
* * * * *
“But alphas are the manly ones!” Dean protested.
“Thank you for taking over.”
“I think human anatomy is way different from mermaid anatomy.” Dean said.
“Not at all, but because no member of the royal family has ever had a consort.”
name is Dean Winchester.”
"I'm not twelve!" Claire exclaimed, snorting out a laugh and shocking Castiel. "I'm four!"
“Uh huh.” Dean shot Cas a look. “How long has Hank been missing?”
"Thanks." Dean said. "We'll see you later."
Dean watched the alpha leave, heart in his throat. He felt a little better because he’d finally said to Cas exactly what he’d been thinking for weeks. Mostly though, Dean felt worse because he now knew that Castiel returned his affections, maybe even loved him, but there was nothing they could do about it.
"That is very kind of you to say." Castiel chose his next words carefully. "I am happy to discover that you are more down to earth than other omegas I've met."
“Ah, geez. ‘M sorry, Cas. Didn’t mean to make you feel bad.”
A sudden and hard shove against his back had him toppling over the side of the boat and into the water with a shout.
"You don't know what the Sickness is?"
At least the zoo with Claire would be nice.
"I'm going to read some books, see if there's anything I can find to help the Dean situation. I don't think there's healing spells that would help with magic depletion and broken bonds, and if there are they're probably temporary and dangerous, but I'll look into it. You take it easy and let me know if anything changes, okay?"
“Ellen told us that you were having a hard time. We wanted to come and give you a hand.” Sam said.
“Thank you. We’re at the hospital now.” Castiel said.
After staring into the fridge for fifteen minutes, Castiel gave up. He never seemed to have an appetite anymore, and he knew he’d lost more weight. Ellen was worried, she’d said so multiple times, but Castiel couldn’t bring himself to eat when he wasn’t hungry.
be there." Castiel said, completely lost. "What do you mean?"
"Dean, we did it!"
Dean had completely ignored him. And not just that, Dean had been
“I can only imagine.” Castiel said, his voice softening. “I’m sorry you had to go through that, Dean.”
"I want to see that!"
Two and a half weeks went by until Castiel actually saw Dean in person. He caught sight of the blonde rushing through the halls after class.
The two had just made it to the gorge when the distant sound of horns echoed from behind them, causing both to freeze.
"So he's still available as a sugar daddy?" Gabriel asked, winking suggestively.
Castiel sighed. "I believe my brother is dead." He looked at Dean and could just make out the whites of his teeth when the omega gave a bitter smile.
“This is delicious.” Castiel said, his voice rough.
A squirrel.
legs.”
Castiel paused, unsure of what to say in order to comfort Dean.
“Date mate?” Dean laughed. “Never heard someone call it that before. No, I don’t. I was dating Lisa Braedon last year, but I haven’t really been interested in anyone since.”
"Once again, I did not realize you were a familiar. I believed you to be a normal animal spelled by a magical being. I wanted to make sure that the reasoning behind the spell would not bring you harm."
“Anytime, Dean.” Castiel replied, his voice just as soft. “Would it be okay if we go out to the gardens today?”
Another man, though a beta this time, stepped in with his son in tow.
Castiel straightened at the dismissal.
Castiel easily sidestepped John and shoved him to the ground when John lost his balance. John went tumbling down. Castiel leaned over him.
One last walk together in the garden.
"Castiel," she greeted, her eyes glinting, "How are you?"
an omega? I kill shit for a living.”
"I don't know if he is, Claire, I'm just saying that he might be. I don't know why he would be, it is not my place to inquire about it."
Dean thought it was hilarious.
Dean chuckled. "Nah. I'm just visiting a friend during her break. She didn't have a chance to buy coffee, so I brought her some."
“Aww.” Charlie cooed obnoxiously. “He’s so protective and cute.”
"Best if I don't." Dean answered, as if his response truly cleared anything up.
Bobby looked taken aback for a moment. "Why?"
Mr. Walker glared at Dean for a second more, a glare that Dean icily returned, then he sat down.
"Hello." Castiel said. "I'm Castiel."
Castiel sucked in his breath, stomach flipping. “Did you have another bet?”
Jagged, shark-like teeth shone in the sunlight.
"Excellent." April's eyes were practically glinting. "I look forward to it."
When the doorbell rang, Castiel realized he’d made a mistake. He should have started with the dishes because they needed dishes to eat the pizza with. It was such a small, stupid error, but it made Castiel feel horrible.
“I need you to know that I’m sorry.” Castiel said. “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Much of this fic was written before the series finale, so there is a lot of canon divergence (Cas was never taken to the Empty, Alternate Charlie is not a thing, etc)
Dean flashed him a grin. “You mind watching the kiddo as I get ready?”
"Yes." Alastair said. "You didn't think I'd just leave, did you? Gotta make sure you actually diffuse the situation like you said you would. Wouldn't want you skipping out on it because you think I won't know the difference.
“So, I’ve been gone for a whole month and a half. Fuck, Cas I’m so fucking sorry.”
"What is it?" Castiel asked. The bushed swayed around, but that may have been because of the winds.
“Like what you see?” Dean teased.
“Papa!” Dean heard Claire exclaim. He finished quickly with the dish in his hand and then went out into the living room.
“Oh. Er, yes, of course you may.”
Dean looked sweaty and shaky when Castiel re-entered his room. Well, more sweaty and shaky than before. He did not hesitate in taking his spot next to Dean and holding out a hand for Dean to hold onto.
They had to stop for the night once more. They spent it the way they had the other, cuddled together during diligent shifts.
Castiel frowned. The thought did not sit well in his stomach, but it was likely correct. Alastair had never caught a garrison leader before. At least, not that Castiel knew of. Alastair had been surprised to see Castiel, too, so Castiel hadn't been expected. Maybe the demons would end up moving Castiel somewhere different, and he would never know what had happened to Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can you leave us alone for five seconds? God!”
"Wedding's going to be in the summer." Sam said. "You up to being my best man?"
“You are a relatively safe and sane driver, as safe and sane as anyone would expect us to be with a career such as our own.”
“What are you doing here, Billie?” Cas interrupts.
”Alright,” Sam says faux-easily, and then they both let it go for now.
Dean--
Dean attempts a shrug. “I mean, not all of it. I remember being impaled pretty well.”
The Entity shoves him over on his back to grab his collar and haul him upright to his knees. “
It’s also not the only thing that needs to be said. It might be the biggest one, though.
Then suddenly Cas reaches out and hugs him, and it’s a reunion hug. Like they haven’t already been around each other for the better part of a week, like they didn’t already do this when Cas came back. They’re still sitting next to each other at the table so it’s a little awkward, but it’s warm, and Cas doesn’t pat him on the back; just holds him. Dean follows his lead.
The corner of Cas’ mouth lifts, but he quickly goes back to looking a little more somber. “I thought I was going to die in Purgatory. I was waiting for you by the rift and then I heard your prayer, all of it, and I thought hearing it would kill me, and I’d never even get to see you again. Or tell you what happened.”
, and he would have thought there just wasn’t any light, if he hadn’t been able to see Jack perfectly well in front of him. How are they even going to find Cas here?
Dean forces a smile. “Feeling’s mutual,” he says, and gets another hit for his troubles. Then the Entity straightens up, letting go of his shirt. He crumples back to the ground, barely able to hold himself up.
. Out loud, he only says, “You’ve thought about this.” If it sounds accusatory, he’s not going to read into it. He’s reminded of when he’d just gotten Sam back. When they were in their 20s and the biggest problem they’d tackled was Dad going missing, and Sam told him he wasn’t going to stick around when they were done. That he had other plans for his life.
“Fuck,” Dean says, and looks up. “Okay, I kinda need you not to say anything about this part. Like, at all. Like, don’t even breathe. Maybe turn around, actually.”
The day after that, he settles down with his laptop in the library to start going through his Google Alerts emails again, when Sam comes in and interrupts him.
. He vaguely remembers bleeding all over the upholstery in the backseat. Then he wakes up in a hospital, one emergency surgery and many blood transfusions later, and he’s still alive. Not the first time he’s had a near-death—or full-death—experience he wasn’t expecting to survive only to find out he did, but this is one of the least fun ones.
“I’ll be here when you get back,” he says, like that was a concern he knew Dean had. Dean realizes it was.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks, and when Dean says, “I don’t know,” he pulls him in closer, kisses his forehead in a way Dean won’t ever admit is soothing. And as Dean starts drifting off to sleep, he lets himself consider it. Consider living somewhere else, consider not hunting. Maybe he’ll ask Cas about it someday.
He thinks about the fog that was the majority of the year before Purgatory; about standing hungover as hell in Billie’s reading room and having her tell him she wasn’t going to let him die yet; about bleeding out in a barn. He’s never told Cas about any of that before.
, or maybe more accurately throw in yet another
Dean hesitates. Takes a breath that comes out a little shaky. ”It was kind of bad,” he settles on after another awkwardly silent moment.
want, now. I know we said it after Chuck, but things still kind of went back to how they were before. And that’s not how it has to be.”
know how to drive. “That’s okay, Cas, I’m here to teach you.”
Sam is still not making a sound, or any noisy expressions that Dean can discern. Dean is starting to regret telling him to be quiet, it might have been easier not running this whole thing by himself. He’s also aware that he’s not even really saying anything that Sam doesn’t already know. It’s the same story he told Sam back when it had just happened, only in a few more words. And it might have to be enough for now, he realizes, because it turns out he might not be ready to talk about it after all.
Cas hugged his legs tighter, since the cold started to get to him, and he didn’t want Dean to found out. “When I was little, my father used to tell me a story about two brothers hunting paranormal things in America. As I grew older, and my father didn’t tell me anymore stories before bed, so I decided to continue the story. Personal work. I added an angel to the story, and turned out Gabriel read that I made myself as the angel, and he was love interests with the older brother. So … that was how Gabriel found out. I didn’t even realised that my writing had that effect.”
suspicious at all,” Castiel grunted as his back was being pushed to the wall and a pair of soft lips crashed to his. The kiss was rough and wanton, and he loved it. Castiel hissed when the librarian ran his tongue on his neck. “Oh, fuck, yes.”
The summoning process was familiar to Dean, but he didn't recall what came after. He didn't remember the thick black smoke coming and started to surround them. He
His body language betrayed his cheerful voice.
Dean nodded at the answer and called a waiter to order their drinks. And dessert.
He smiled when he felt a twitch on his thigh that came from Cas' hardened member that was pressed to him, "Oh. Well, rise and shine, Castiel Winchester."
“Yes, Sir?”
“Getting possessive, are we?” Benny chuckled, earning a death glare from the younger man before him. “What? You are. You tend to when you’re attracted to someone. And you’re clearly attracted to this dentist. What’s his name, by the way?”
the shit out of someone who tried to do anything funny in his bar. And Dean Winchester would love to
Well, they can always make everything up as they go.
The man on the phone cringed when he heard the woman’s voice. He never meant to be cruel, but somehow Castiel could never get used to his new secretary’s voice. It was as if there’s something vicious behind the voice that he could never explain.
The huge black dog suddenly sit still and bent down to the mattress.
it was that Christmas when Castiel went home to spend it with his family, and it was then when Crowley called him to let him know that Balthazar was in a pub with a freshman and they were getting too cosy with each other. It took Castiel two months until he finally confronted Balthazar, and they had the major talk about their relationship, and decided to end it.
Jo to meet Cas as well. But not in near time, he would frightened the poor dentist.
"No," Cas replied shortly, "do you mind if we moved to your room?"
This time, there was a hint of trauma on Sam's face when he started to talk about the watch, "Chuck used that to show me the future. You remember when he got Eileen and me at that casino, then you and Cas came with that ball that I had to crushed, but I didn't."
“Castiel.”
“Are you gonna bring them out or just standing there?”
A laughter came from Dean, “He might got a point there. Anyway, I want to complain about Balthazar.”
“Great. You’re on your way yet?” Dean took a left turn and lowered his speed when he saw a kid on bicycle was going on the side of the road.
"What?"
While they enjoyed their meal, Sam and Jack talked about the possibilities of power downgrading. Whether Amara might have taken all of Jack’s powers with Her as She ascends as the new God? Although Jack mentioned how he tried to cut his finger a bit last night, and it still recovered. It seemed like he still had a little bit of grace in him.
“Of course you’re here as well, Misha,” Castiel rubbed the jet black head of the feline, whose purr just became louder and there were some sharp sensations on Castiel’s chest. “Ow, watch those claws, will you?”
"I-I thought you told me not to change, Dean," the angel finally answered playfully. An answer that brought a sniffled chuckle from Dean, before he pulled Cas again to a hug.
“I’m sorry, I guess I was nervous,” Cas took a sip of his wine, before continued, “So, this is your Saturday night thingy, Dean?” Cas finally looked up to Dean and smiled. “What are the odds?”
"Dean, I'm-I'm close. I'm gonna come on you."
Jack quickly swallowed to answer Dean, "Don't worry about that, Dean, we understand. Actually, last night Eileen and I had a discussion about The Empty's origin. Eileen seemed highly interested in it."
Dean was about to laugh at Rowena’s comment but had to stop abruptly when Jack cut in with a piece of brand new information. Something that could lead him to have the same reaction as his brother.
The bitter laugh that came from his big brother made Sam (finally) hesitated to console him. However, he knew that Dean was on the edge of his emotions. All it took was one
And, as expected, he overslept. Now he only had fifteen minutes to get to his workplace.
“He’s … stunning. Have you seen him?” Dean suddenly felt like a teenager when he felt his face heatened as he saw Benny shakes his head slowly. “I don’t know, man. I’m quite sure his eyes are hypnotic, that’s how he lured patients.”
A smile was formed on Dean’s face when he heard the easiness in Cas’ voice when asking that. He really didn’t have to worry about Cas and Balz. “Yeah, would like to take Benny, but the man’s a bit challenged in art or anything like so.”
“Bye, Baz. Love you too.”
near perfect!"
"Dean-"
“No,” the man chuckled at the question, “but you girls so happen to visit on a weekend, so ...”
The smile on Crowley’s face went wider when he saw Castiel rose from his seat and takes his jacket with him. “That’s my boy.”
Dean enjoyed seeing the man sitting next to him shifting sheepishly with a bottle of beer in his hand, and the answer that came from Cas totally amused him. “I think I’d go with
“Just … there,” he pointed to his motorbike, not far from Dean’s Baby.
“Hey, Cas, come on in,” Sam looked at him with a boyish smile. “Hey, look, look … Juliet, stay.”
Cas made an oath to himself that he had to find more ways to see Dean laughs like that.
“Thanks, Sammy,” he replied shortly. “I, uh, I'm probably gonna head up to the kitchen first. I’m hungry. You guys just go if you want to take a rest. It’s been a long day, a long week, for us.”
“Sure. Thank you, Dean.”
“Hey, I got you pie for dessert,” Samuel Winchester, a statuesque man who owned a body movement as graceful as a new-born giraffe had stood next to the couch where his big brother is and lifted up his arm proudly, showing a paper box with a logo of a well-known bakery in town.
"Castiel?"
It was so
Dean smiled, “Not your fault, Cas. Well, it was their mother who lost her life in the fire. Anyway, the boys lived here and there with their father, until a friend of the family took them in, and their father went off. Leaving the boys only with phone calls or messages that came once a month. Dean Winchester had a foster sister from the elderly couple. The three of them were a menace to the neighbourhood,” Dean chuckled to the memory where he, Sam, and Jo stole Ellen’s neighbour’s apples, so they can have Ellen made apple pie for dessert after dinner. The poor neighbour never knew why her apple tree suddenly ran out of fruits that season.
Cas pauses for a moment, and then he says, carefully, “Do you ever… think about therapy?”
“Congratulations, you passed your exam,” Dean says, before tapping the gear shift. “Now P for park.”
”Sam,” Sam corrects automatically, and that’s how Dean knows he’s won this round.
So it’s a long time coming, whatever after-school-special talk Sam is going to spring on him, is Dean’s point. That’s why he’s so surprised it never happens.
Cas and Sam finally look up at that. “You alright?” Sam asks, with genuine concern that just serves to make Dean feel even more pissed.
Dean laughs humorlessly. “Bet you thought you’d live forever,” he says, ignoring how it makes his chest tighten.
. And Dean really just can’t have that. It doesn’t matter that Cas is an angel, or that there’s an apocalypse looming, or that the only one alive besides Dean allowed to touch his baby is Sam and even he is on thin ice—this is something he has to remedy.
They go back to comfortable silence, until Cas speaks again, asks, “Did you stop drinking?” apropos of nothing, like it only just hit him.
Billie seems to realize that’s what he’s thinking of, because she then smirks and says, “Hello, Dean. Castiel. My apologies for our last encounter.”
Dean moves away from where he’s been standing by the wall, stops by the foot of the bed. Cas crawls forward, kneels in front of Dean to cradle his face in both hands. He wipes his thumbs over Dean’s cheeks, they come away wet.
—but Dean doesn’t even want Sam to infer any of that.
is upset, especially, so no matter what Dean had imagined their reunion could have been like—though he hadn’t imagined it, no way he could have—it’s all put on a back burner, to never be acknowledged again, probably. It’s whatever. Cas died—Dean took care of his body, burned it, picked a nice place to spread his ashes, tried to kill himself—and now Cas is back, and Dean is fine. Story arc wrapped up, onto the next one.
Dean is prepared for some shit like
He avoids every room that could possibly contain alcohol, and somehow ends up in the garage without really thinking about it. At this point he’s already starting to breathe steadier, but Baby could use a wash, anyway. It’s methodical, it puts everything else out of his brain.
,” the Entity suddenly shouts, and then it turns into black sludge.
“Dean… I’ve been working on something for a while,” he says slowly, carefully.
Then he’s on a roll, so he keeps going. He picks up the bottles from his room; the decanter in the library; the beer in the fridge—pours it all out. He changes his mind as soon as he’s calmed down, and he gets all the way to the driver’s seat of the Impala, about to go to a bar or a liquor store, before he catches up to what he’s fucking doing. This is a lot, even for him. He weighs his keys in his palm and the decision in his mind, and then he gets out and slams the door harder than necessary—sorry, Baby—and goes back inside.
“Oh, yeah, Sam didn’t tell you? She’s Death now,” Dean plasters on a grin, it feels about as fake as it is. “You know, that didn’t help. Figured she’d throw me in the Empty the second she saw me in the Veil,” and then his heart stutters a little again. So close to something like
Cas looks incredibly
Dean turns back around again, mouth already open on a customary answer, but then he feels himself deflate. He looks down at his feet and smiles a little bit, then nods, admits, “Better now. Fucking exhausted, but better.”
He starts by looking for Cas in the library, then the kitchen, then the Dean cave, even though he knew he was going to find him in his room. He finally knocks on Cas’ door and lets himself in to see Cas sitting on his bed, fully clothed—trenchcoat and everything—reading a book that looks suspiciously like something that went missing from Dean’s collection of old stolen library books ages ago. It’s
-- and hey, that’s actually kind of funny, how it kind of ended in a barn, too.
”Okay, man, forget I asked. Can we do this when I’m less hopped up on pain meds?” He gestures at the IV in his arm for emphasis. ”Just. Let’s just rain-check this.”
He’s pretty sure Sam almost flinches in the chair next to him. “...You don’t remember?”
Dean looks away, but he can feel Cas watching him still. They’re both quiet for a while, until Cas finally says, “Come here.”
“I’m not gonna…” Sam starts to say, then pauses, tries again. “Like, I don’t mean anything by this, I’m just--. Saying. That you can tell me anything, Dean. You can always talk to me.”
going over his head right now. “How did you even spring a deal with the Empty?” He turns to Jack. “I’m assuming it wasn’t very happy with you.”
Or maybe,
Billie smiles—except it’s a little bit more of a smirk. “Well, I was dying. And I have once again had a change in perspective. With God gone now, there are bigger things to take care of. The world is in desperate need of a revamp. Jack came and talked to me about it, and we happened to share similar views.”
“‘Course. Just, you know,” he says, and makes an almost flapping gesture with his hand that doesn’t even come close to its intended meaning—
No, not just a bright light, Dean realizes. It’s Jack, glowing. Growing bigger and brighter, until Dean can no longer make out Jack at all, until he has to look away. He covers his eyes, thinking about true forms and burned out eyeballs, so he doesn’t see what happens before everything goes dark again.
