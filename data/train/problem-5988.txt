“You know, you’ve ruined me for dirty talk forever, I hope you know that, I used to be so blase about the whole thing,” he grumbled, pulling Steve’s belt free with a twist of his wrist.  “Suck this, slap that, yatta yatta yatta.”
Hammer blinked at him.  “Where am I going to go?” he asked, his voice perplexed, and Steve didn’t bother to answer.
DJ nodded, his eyes locked on the hinges of the range door.  "Yes."
Rhodey nodded.  “But you’re okay with it.”
She winced.  "Well, he wasn't.  Didn't.  But he kind of-" She stopped, took a deep breath.  "He kind of thought they were dating?"
Laughing, Tony stroked his hair back from his face.  “Have you looked at yourself?” he asked.  “It's not surprising at all.  So, okay, you love me, and you really love sex-”
“And that's the response that we've gotten from anyone competent, and anyone incompetent would just make the situations they get themselves into about twenty times worse,” Maria said with a faint smile.  “Luckily, for the most part, they are decent people.”
“Yeah,” Tony said.
“Bruce, did you have a chance to look at the-”  Tony stopped short, peering over the top of his tablet.  “You’re not Bruce.”
He could hear a rhythmic tapping, what he suspected was a pen against the top of a desk or maybe a fingernail against a coffee cup.  “So…”
“I mean, yeah, that’s true,” Rhodey said, wobbling a hand through the air.  “But I think every one of us that gets a new hair cut or tries a new way of dressing or, you know, gets a piercing or a tattoo, we all do want approval on that, don’t we?  We want someone to tell us we made a good choice, that we’ve got good taste, that we’re smart and classy and stylish, right?”
Steve looked over to find Tony coming up behind him, a warm smile on his face.  He was dressed in a perfectly tailored deep crimson shirt, his vest and tie a dark green that should’ve clashed but somehow didn’t.  He took Steve’s plate out of his hand, ignoring the way Steve tried to grab it back. “What is this, pastry penance?”
“I seem to recall you giving that to me more than once when I was his age,” Tony said.  His fork hit the bottom of the bowl, and he looked down, surprised to find he’d finished it.  “Did you like it, DJ?”
Steve jerked back, his hand falling to his side, caught off guard by the unexpected voice.  He'd seen Tony Stark before, waving at the camera in newsreel footage, grinning out from the full color covers of magazines and the stark black and white of newspaper pages.  Handsome and charismatic, he drew press coverage without even trying.  Steve knew what Tony Stark looked like.
Her chin came up.  "Unlike you, Mr. Stark," she said with a smile, "I'm always quiet."
“Shall be served on the patio,” Jarvis said.  He gave Tony a slight smile.  “Would you care to join us for lunch, sir?”
Tony signed.  “Steve?” he asked, grabbing hold of the hem of Steve’s shirt.  He pulled it off, and Steve let him, raising his arms so Tony could wrestle the shirt free.  He tossed it over his shoulder.  “This relationship is hanging by a thread,” he said, bracing his arms on Steve’s shoulders and crossing his wrists behind Steve’s head.  “So it would behoove you to show some appreciation for my ass right now.”
Steve considered telling him, in no uncertain terms, what he could do with his very generous offer.  Instead, he took a deep breath.  "Mr. Stark, I don't think-"
“I mean, we could-” Steve rocked forward, pressing him up against the wall, his weight pinning Tony in place. His shoulder bounced against the wall, and it protested, the skin going white hot for an instant, just long enough to clear his head..  Tony wrenched his mouth away from Steve’s, sucking in air like he was drowning, his vision going a bit blurry on the edges.  All of a sudden, Steve seemed perfectly content to stay right where he was, his hands tight on Tony’s ass, his face buried in Tony’s neck.  “Bed,” Tony managed, his fingers digging into Steve’s shoulders.  “Let’s-  Bed.”
“In retrospect, it's pretty clear-”
“I'm doing my job here, I don't know what you expect from me, Banner, but-”
“In general, no,” he agreed.  “What are you all-”
“No,” Steve told him, but he was smiling.  He offered Tony his sandwich.  Tony picked a sausage out of it, popping it into his mouth.  Steve did the same, licking his fingers clean.  “I did the one with the King's office, or maybe it's the Prime Minister's, I don't even know-”
“Well, it's their fault for being openly female in the current political and social climate,” Tony said.  Steve ducked his head to hide his smile, and Tony bumped his shoulder against Steve's.  “After all, they're the one who forced their identity on the rest of us.”
"That one of yours?"
The peel, blood red and thin as a sheet of paper, slipped from her fingers, falling soundlessly into the bowl.  “He never came home.”
“Guess he thought we needed to know,” Bruce said.  He was pacing around the room, his gait quick and uneven, almost jerky.  He glanced over his shoulder in Tony’s direction, making eye contact for just a moment before he looked away again.  “Speaking of, uh, where is he?”
“I mean, I can-”
“Oh!” Steve tried to get out of the way, and somehow ended up bumping into him instead.  The young man staggered backwards, grabbing for the doorframe, and Steve caught his arm, steadying him.  “Sorry.  I didn’t-”
“Leaving me already?” he said, and he was laughing hard enough that Tony could feel it.  “C'mon, Stark.”
Where did it go?
“I'm going to blow you in the bathroom, so let's GO,” Tony said, and Steve choked on whatever it had been that he was about to say.
“Stop surrendering, MacIntyre, it’s undignified,” Tony said, dropping onto the pew with a thud.
Tony waved a hand through the air.  "Take him away.  Work.  I have work.  You're in the way.  He is definitely in the way, all the tiny little limbs and things, and-"
“Okay.”  DJ shut the door, turning away from the car.  His hands locked on the straps of his backpack, he took a deep breath.
"I've heard that about Past Tony, Current Tony, and Future Tony," Marcy said. "Mostly from you."
"I am sorry," Jarvis said, cutting him off, and DJ reared up, throwing a pillow at the nearest camera.
Tony was sitting at the far side of the table, facing the door, a wine bottle and two empty glasses next to his elbow.  He was wearing a silk dressing gown over an unbuttoned shirt and pants from the suit he’d been wearing earlier in the day.  His feet were bare, his hair disordered, his hands cradling a file folder.  His eyes were focused on the pages, a faint frown tugging at the corners of his lips.
Steve turned on his stool to find Mr. Jarvis standing in the doorway to the kitchen.  "Mr. Jarvis?"
“I'm special,” Jessica agreed.  “And Luke's the fashion plate in this relationship.”
"I'm always serious, darling, it's one of my major failings," Tony said.
“I don’t remember,” Steve lied.
“Yeah, well, we can work with stupid.  We both have experience with stupid.  Maybe too much.” Tony flexed his hands, and brought them up, cupping his fingers over his mouth and exhaling into his palms.  One breath, two, and Steve was watching him, his face still.  Tony rubbed his hands together, hard and fast, savoring the friction, and gave them a brisk pat against his legs to get the blood flowing.  “There.”  He reached out, his fingertips ghosting over Steve’s cheekbone, down along the angle of his jaw.
Tony took a deep breath, savoring the sun and the wind on his face.  He could hear traffic in the distance, the grinding of tires on damaged pavement and the slow, steady beeping of big machinery backing up.  The smells of hot tar and motor oil hung in the air, and below that, the tang of salt from the ocean, out of sight but waiting just there, beyond the skyline.  His fingers flexed against the metal of the railing, feeling the rough edges of the flaking paint, and the gritty degradation of rust.
"You look hungry on the best of days," Tony said.  "They're probably just covering all possible contingencies."
“I don't live here because Hank and Tony have two modes,” Jan said.  She held up one finger.  “One, BFF's forever and ever, lets make friendship bracelets or perhaps a doomsday ray.”
Tony wandered across the workshop, kicking chunks of armor out of the way with a vicious sweep of his foot.  A gauntlet slammed into the metal cabinet, and he was pretty sure it left a dent.  It also might’ve broken his foot.  Not that he cared much.  The physical pain muted a lot of other things in his head, and he was grateful for it.  He lowered himself into a chair, slumping low in the seat.  “I gave up,” he said, saluting her with the cup.  And with a broad smile, he took a deep drink.
“Look, I don't think-” Tony shoved a hand through his hair. “He's not...”  His voice trailed away, and he glanced across the room towards where DJ had disappeared.  “We make it clear to him that he gets to choose what form he takes.  Sometimes he's a bot.  Sometimes he's a bot for days.”  He shrugged, a quick twitch of his shoulders.  “There may not be a kid for them to play with, Sue.”
She nodded, a tiny dip of her chin.  "Yeah," she said.  She sniffed, and rubbed the back of her wrist against her nose.  "Yeah.  I think so."
Bucky slumped low in his chair, legs thrown out in front of him.  “Right,” he said, cradling his bowl in one hand.  He sounded gleeful.  “Storytime.”
Her mouth worked. “I'm sorry,” she said, and he hated himself.
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,
“I know you’re lying,” Tony said.
"The point is, after all these years of clearly being muscle and murder for hire, working for mobsters and strike breakers, you're saying he's suddenly seen the light and has dedicated himself to the communist party?" Steve asked.
“God,” Tony said, reaching for his glass, nostalgia sweeping over him like a wave.  “It's been a long time since you've had to do that, isn't it?”
Steve thought about that.  "I'm willing to blame the post flight adrenaline if you are," he said, and Tony stared to laugh out loud, great, uneven bursts of laughter that bent him double.  Steve grinned at him, fear melting away in the face of that.  "Or Doom.  It's not fair, but it's very practical, and he probably won't even bother to deny it."
“Very nearly, Miss Potts,” Jarvis said.  He leaned over, offering the tray to DJ. “I thought you might like a piece of bread and butter, to tide you over?”  DJ rolled into a sitting position, taking the plate from the tray with a shy smile.  Jarvis smiled back.  “Mrs. Parker baked that loaf just for you.”
"Fixing the goddamn bullet holes," Tony muttered into his cup.  "Goddamn Doom and his goddamn Doombots."  Steve's hand tightened, a faint, gentle squeeze.  Tony subsided with a sound that would've been an obscenity if he had the energy for obscenities.
“I want to shave my head,” Carol said, staring up at Caiera, who ran a hand over her own buzzed skull.
“Offer received and soundly rejected,” Tony said.  “Look, that’s-”  He huffed out a breath  He was tired and not hiding it well.  “That’s not what I want, Steve.”
“That’s what they want you to think,” Tony told him.  His phone beeped, a new incoming message from Jarvis.  “Reservation’s all set.” He glanced at DJ.  “Next time we see your Strange, you should, you know, write your parents a letter or something.”
“Dance lessons,” Jan repeated, propping a hand on her hip.  “Steve.  Gym.  What you're wearing will work.  We're going to teach you how to dance.”
She pointed at Clint, who flopped back on the couch, limbs going in all directions.  “What he did,” she said.  “That.  Right there.”
The bark of laughter caught them both off balance.  "Don't do that again," Tony said, trying to get himself under control.  "Just-  Don't, I do not need-"
“There is a terrifying amount of butter in it,” Steve said.  He took a sip of his coffee.  “You can never tell Tony I gave them to you.”
Tony stopped, turning back to face her.  “Pep,” he said, his voice gentle.  “I want you to think back over your entire life, right back to your earliest times in trying to make friends.  When you were a tiny, adorable-”
Steve nodded.  “Because I know you didn't want to-”
"But we don't want to!" someone said, and everyone laughed.
Steve nodded.  “Jarvis?  Is he all right?”
“I bet I could do it,” Steve said, following him.  The coffee pot was half full when they walked in, and Sam opened a cabinet, pulling out a couple of mugs.  Steve set the box down on the table.  “I thought we were doing gift exchange on Christmas.”
“Thank,” DJ said, looking back at Steve.
“Hey, Jarvis, anyone up yet?” Steve walked into the shared kitchen, dropping two big paper bags onto the nearest open countertop.  “I picked up bagels on my morning run.”
"Ouch," Carol said.
She glanced at him, her blue eyes sharp under the line of her brows.  “What’s the password?” she repeated, tucking the handkerchief into her back pocket.
“Right.  He loves you, too.” Tony folded his hands in front of him.  “So if you work for Olive Garden, you guys, you’re fine.  Your TGIFridays, your Applebees, your Outback Steakhouses, all of you, we’re good.  You’re fine.  I’m not talking to you.”  He sat up, his eyes wide.  “Okay?  Okay.”
“I'm fifty pounds of rage in a five pound bag,” Jan said without missing a beat.  “Sam.  Darling.”  She gave him a broad, toothy grin.  “Why are you here?”
“Never mind.  Let's go.”
“You should have?” Steve asked, and that wasn’t what he’d been planning to say.  At all.
“Yeah, you are.  You’re working hard.” Steve pushed the oatmeal towards him.  “Want a little?”
In the fractured light of the streetlights, he saw Tony's teeth flash in a feral sort of grin.  "You always did underestimate me, Rogers."  He twisted around, watching the crowds.  "But yes.  Even for me.  This seems excessive.”
“Abso-fucking-lutely,” Carol said with a shit eating grin.   She leaned back in her chair, her legs thrown out in front of her.  “I’m in a room full of attractive women, and all of them are giving you hell.  This is pretty much my definition of paradise.”
With a melodramatic sigh, Tony opened his mouth, letting Steve tuck the thermometer under his tongue.  “Thank you.”  Steve glanced over his shoulder. “Eli, any chance you can throw the kettle onto the stove for me?  I have to keep him from...”  Steve waved a hand at the trays of cinnamon rolls.  “Gorging.”
“Yes,” Natasha and Peter said as one.
“It’s safer than staying here,” Bruce said, and Steve grinned down at the tapas menu in his hands.
“I am nothing but grace and I resent the implication in that question,” Tony said, from between teeth that absolutely were not clenched.  He braced his hands on the workbench.  “Banner.  Seriously.  I put up with Clint snoring on my couch and Natasha ‘fixing’ her weaponry and Thor’s one sided conversation and I’ve removed Coulson’s access codes from the system three times now and he still managed to sneak in and I’m sick of running diagnostics on Jay to figure out how that’s happening, so-”
The photographer seemed to be struggling to find something to say.  From the back, someone else called out, "So how do you think about it?"
“What’s his most recent get rich scheme?” Happy asked.
“It’s Tuesday,” DJ said.
Tony glanced back over his shoulder.  Steve was standing in the door from the kitchen stairs, carrying a fresh basket of split logs in one hand, the shoulders of his sheepskin dusted with snow.  His heavy boots rang on the marble floor as he walked to the fireplace.  “Ah.”  Tony leaned back on his hands, a slight smile on his face.  "And why is this delivery so late?"
“That’s…  That’s not something to brag about,” Tony told him.
He peered at her over the top of the book.  “Do I have a meeting?”
“Because I have spent far too much of my wasted life in this city, they go off every thirty minutes before eight pm,” Tony said, sounding bored.
“No,” they said, absolutely in sync.
His voice trailed away, and Clea nodded, her face pensive.  “Such is the lament of all parents, I suppose,” she said.  “All children will someday take a path that takes them away from the place where they began, down a road that their parents cannot walk with them.  All that can be done is to give them the tools they need.  And make sure they know, if their path proves too difficult, then they have another option.”
That startled a laugh out of her.  “I ran away from home,” she said, as Clint pulled her towards the edge of the tunnel.
“I do not believe him to be in any danger, or any pain,” Jarvis said.  “But we still do not know how far his control over his physical form extends.  I believe that if he is allowed to calm down, to relax, he will be able to put himself to rights.”  Jarvis paused.  Then, “Panic makes things harder.  For him, especially.”
“Can’t complain,” Rhodey said, tucking his hands in the pockets of his khakis.
“Thank you, that's very kind, we won't be doing that, either,” Steve said to Aimsbridge, his voice thin. “We're just going to-” He cleared his throat. “We're going to go now.”
“Hello there.”
“Not okay with this,” Tony said, tossing the sandwich aside.
“I understand this isn’t ideal, based on the circumstances, but I want it known, I didn’t seduce him, he seduced me.”
Iron Man held up a hand.  “One fight at a time.”  He looked at DJ.  “Botbrain-”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Rhodey said.  He tapped his foot on the floor.  “I take it the negotiations didn’t go the way Tony wanted them to?”
And it was like being in the air, and falling, and waiting, waiting for those hands to catch him.
“Parker,” Tony said, and Peter pulled himself up short.
"I'm sensing disapproval."
“Do you feel better?  Because you talked about it?” Franklin asked.  He tugged idly at one of his shoelaces.  “Sometimes it helps.”
Steve nodded.  "Is there much of a market for that right now?" he asked, curiosity overwhelming him.
“Really,” Pepper said, her voice tired.  “Fine?”
“Now, boys, behave, or there’ll be no dessert for any of you.” May reached back, untying her apron.  “Mr. Rhodes, do we have something with a strong, steady beat?”
“I will,” Steve said, as Billy came loping down the stairs.  “He’s not here.”
Luke gave him a look. “You kiss like an asthmatic carp.”
Steve gave him a look, but it was hard to keep a straight face.  “I think what he's trying to ask, Director, is why we didn't know about this until we ran face first into it in the streets of New York.”
“I didn’t think so.”  Tony’s eyes opened, and Steve lost his breath again.  “I am…” His shoulders flexed, his hands braced on the back of the couch.  “I’m careful around you.  Because if I’m not-”  He laughed, and it was hard and sharp and held an edge that Steve didn’t understand.  “You kissed me.”
“Yes,” DJ agreed.  He glanced at Franklin.  “You?”
“I’m fine!” Harris said, and she fell silent.  He took a deep breath.  “I really am.”
“Half an hour,” Clint said.  Tony made a face.  “Yeah, yeah, you’ll survive.”
He was blind and dumb and he descended anyway.
"Hmm?"  Hank looked in his direction, but his eyes were unfocused, his mind clearly somewhere else.  "Yes.  Of course."
Steve picked up Sam's shoes, tossing them in Sam's general direction.  “I think you've got the better idea.  Run?”
Laughing, Steve let her push him along, doing his best not to trip over his own feet.  “Help,” he said to Clint as they passed.
“Yeah, I’m not subtle,” Jess agreed.  “And it’s still going to work.”
“”You could, but no one will listen,” Tony said.  He unbuttoned his chef’s jacket, shrugging out of it.  “You’re late.”
“I’ll stand here.  Until you choose to move.”
“I'm being good,” Tony said.  On the other end of the line, that was met with stony silence, and he grinned.  “Fine.  I'm on the far side of the campus.  Some shithole warehouse where we've been hiding our not so secret shame.”  He held up a piece of plating, eyeing it with suspicion.  “As it turns out, we've got a lot of shame, Potts.”
DJ darted around and between them, and occasionally, without looking or even seeming to notice they were doing it, one or the other would reach out, running a gentle hand over his hair or plucking him off the banister as he started to climb up a newel post.
“Are you blackmailing me, small Storm-Richards?” Tony asked her, one eyebrow arching.  “Your mom would not approve.”
“Dear God.” Tony poked at the fabric.  “Purple and green.  It's...”  He squinted down at it, his head spinning.  “It's just so ugly.”
“Wait, Rhodey?” Tony asked, and every head in the room swung in his direction.  He scowled at them, which probably was ineffective, because he could feel DJ’s chin on top of his head.  “Rhodey’s not even here, why does he get pastry?”
“For now,” Steve said.  Tony gave him a look, and he smiled.  “What did you expect, Stark?”
Tony didn’t bother looking back at him.  “They’re in the ‘making a public spectacle of themselves’ stage of making up, so as far as I’m concerned?”  He reached in his pocket for his phone.  “Yes.”
Steve was, for the lack of a better word, afraid.
DJ was sitting on the edge of a battered plush chair, his hands braced on either side of his hips, staring up at dusty chandelier that hung in the middle of the ceiling.  Tony stopped in front of him.  “This cannot be the place,” he said.
He stopped.  The fire was crackling on the hearth, a heavy iron pot hanging over the flames.  The room was filled with the comforting smell of wood smoke and bubbling stew.  A loaf of bread was sitting on the wooden table, along with a stack of bowls and a pitcher.
“Great.  Will you be dry?”
“Which is, I think, everyone other than Steve,” Tony said, bracing his chin on one fist. On the other side of the broad, heavy conference table, Steve didn't respond to that. He had signed where he'd been told to sign, he'd nodded and mumured agreement to anything that was put to him, but other than that, he'd been still and silent. Even now, he seemed only barely aware of what was happening around him.
“About half a mile less than the last time you asked me,” Happy said, hunched over the wheel, his hands locked in place with a death grip.  “And asking more isn’t making those miles pass faster.”
DJ shook his head.  “Not…  A good idea.”
Tony’s smile was sharp and deadly and Steve loved it.  “I still have you in check,” he whispered.  “And you don’t have many pieces left on the board.”
An instant later, he did, the pale glow of repulsors skimming across the horizon, a second form slicing through the night, making a beeline straight for DJ, who was falling.  Who was still falling.
That it would.  “Or I’ll end up associating sex with multiple Tony Starks.”
Steve grabbed a crate from the back of the truck and dropped it on the pavement just next to the back door.  “You are,” he said, squeezing Tony’s hand.  “Sit.”
“Yeah, but you were the only idiot who went down on the tracks after her,” Drew said.  “Then there was the piano-”
Another sigh. “Miscalculated,” DJ said.  He looked at Clint, his eyes huge.  “Chore?”
“Want one?” the text read.  Harris looked at it.  Then back up at Steve and Tony.  He looked back down at his phone.
“That was before I actually needed backup, because I usually rely on Strange to keep her from dissolving my shoes or my facial hair or, you know, my soul-”
“Right.”  Tony nodded.  “If I end up dead, drag my body down into the basement and tell everyone I’m drunk.  It's logical and believable, you can make it work for at least a few months.”
Tony leaned back, smoothing DJ’s hair, one shaking hand cradling his head.  “It’s not, but thank you anyway.”  He tried to smile.  “Are you hurt?”
“We stand here, with Tony and Steve, at the end of two roads, and the beginning of another.  For from here, they will walk together, on a journey shared between them, a road neither could have walked alone, for being with another changes each step you take.  Each step you take is now balanced with the steps of another, taking his needs, his fears, his hopes into account, perhaps more than you might consider your own.”
She smiled. “I've regretted a lot of things in my life, Stark.” Her head dropped back to his shoulder. “That was never one of them.”
“You absolutely are flirting with him,” Pepper said.
There was a flash of light and a sizzle, like a piece of wet vegetation trying and failing to catch fire.  Harris could smell something like a crackle, like the scent of burning ozone, like burning hair.
“Me being me,” Tony agreed, “I'll just do it with a boner.”
“Yes, there is,” Steve said. “Radio City Music hall seats, what, fifteen hundred people?”
“You should be, you do enough of it,” Harris said, and Tony’s head snapped in his direction, his mouth hanging open.  Harris held his hands up.  “Yeah, I said it.”
“He knew we were going to a convention.”
“I think we missed it,” Tony said.  “By a couple of hours.”
“Because you were having a panic attack,” Pepper said, as if that was a normal thing.  As if that was a thing that happened and it was fine.  Her hands smoothed over his hair, his neck, his shoulders.  Touching him.  Smoothing the tension away.  “And you weren't responding to him.”
Tony’s head cocked to the side. “That’s because it’s not,” he said with an easy smile before digging into his food.  “But I’m a man of many talents, and you’re seen H+sank’s shop.” He waved his spoon at Steve.  “He doesn’t have enough business to support himself, let alone an apprentice.”	1qwesq shook his head.  “When it’s slow at the shop, Hank’s well pleased to be rid of me, so I do my best to make myself useful elsewhere.” He leaned back, looking up at the awning with a satisfied smile.  “I’m fairly good at fixing things, and in a city like this?  There’s always something that needs fixing.”
“Oh, so THAT gets free advertising,” the man, who Steve assumed was Gary, said.
Bruce looked at the door, and then back at Tony, his expression concerned.  “If you’re all right?”
Trip took a deep breath.  “The really fucked up thing about this is, I have the greatest story to tell people, and yet, no one would believe me.”  She looked at  Steve and Tony.  “Do you two want to get married?”
Tony looked at him.  “Do you have the time?” he asked, laughter running through the words.
“I don’t care if it was an empty cup, it’s a biohazard and I’m going to have to clean my upholstery with fire at this point, Peter, and if I get a creme brulee torch, you’d better start running!”
“Yes.” The word was soft.  Steady.  Utterly implacable.  Obie fell silent, and Tony smiled.  “Yes.  I can.”  He leaned back in his chair.  “It’s possible, of course.  It’s possible that his parents are still out there, somewhere.  It’s possible that they’ve spent all these years struggling to make a life that could include him.   Making a home for him, making a place for him.  It’s possible that they’ve been working for all this time, and by some incredible, almost unbelievable, coincidence, that they’re on their way back to Hammer’s right now.
“And why are we asking?” she asked, leaning in his direction.  She fluttered her eyelashes, all coquettish innocence.  “Are we finally coming to the terms with the reality of our situation?”
"I cannot be responsible for you," he said, but the statement didn't conjure up the fear that it should've.  “It's dangerous.”
“Jan.”  He pushed the invitation to the side.  “I have a problem.”
“No one asks for this,” Steve pointed out.  The heat in the words seemed to startle him as much as Tony.  He took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair.  “No one.”
“Know.” DJ wrestled his shirt off, everything taking too much effort, and more energy than he had.  He was exhausted, and the lack of sleep was like a physical weight on his thin frame.  His shoulders ached with it, his back bowed.  His shirt fluttered to the ground.  “It's...  It's okay.”
He looked up at her, and there was something she couldn't quite read in his face.  As if he was trying to determine if she was to be trusted.  If she could be trusted.
“What’s your excuse?” Steve asked, bouncing on the ball of his foot.
“On the bed is fine, thank you,” she said, dusting off her hands on her crisp apron.  “We'll want it all cleaned and dusted before we open even a single box.”  Her head tipped towards Jarvis, her mouth forming a flat line.  “A quick day's work, he says.”
The fellow doffed his flat cap, his broad Irish face.  “Sorry 'bout this,” he said, with a lopsided smile.  “I'm Hogan.  Happy Hogan, one of-”  His voice dropped to a bare whisper.  “One of Mr. Stark's men?”
Steve nodded.  “What 'situations' would those be?”
“Hey,” he heard Tony say, his voice quiet.  “Come here.”
Harris stared up at him.  “Can you…  Can you please just forget I exist?” he managed.
Tony’s eyebrows shot up.  “Excuse me?”
Tony smiled.  “Yeah, well, now that you mention it, neither could I.”  He took a step closer.  “Where ever that line is, Steve?  You haven’t found it yet.  And if you do, I’ll tell you.”
DJ glanced up at him,, his eyes huge, dark holes in his pale face.  Tony waited, letting him process, until he finally shook his head.  Tony nodded, leaning forward in his seat.  “The things we make, the machines, they’re big and complex,” he said, bracing his elbows on his knees.  “Engines.  Generators.  Things like that.  And complex things fail in complex ways.”
Steve gestured at Shuri.  “Buck.”
Clint glanced at Phil, who was frowning at the ceiling.  “Want backup?” he asked, mostly to Clint, but with the full understanding that Jarvis could hear them.
Steve’s face bloomed in a smile.  “Okay, first of all, I already asked you, and you already said yes,” he pointed out.  “You don’t get to take credit for it now.”
“Of course.  He’s going tonight?” Rhodey asked, dreading the answer.
She gave him a suspicious look, but leaned over to take a quick smell.  Her nose wrinkled.  “More...  Citrusy?”   Pepper straightened up.  “It's raspberry puree?”
His voice trailed away, and Steve took a step forward, putting a hand on the edge of Hammer’s desk.  “Justin,” he said, his voice quiet, and Hammer looked up.  “You wouldn’t kill him.”
“I could not possibly have known that would happen,” she pointed out with a smile.  “Don’t get me wrong.  I’m pleased that it did.  But I can’t be held accountable for it.”
“It's not for anyone,” Steve said, giving him a stern look.  “It's-” The camera flash went off, and gritted his teeth against the impulse to hide behind the poinsettia's spreading leaves.  “It was on sale.”
“Because it was a rough night, and-” Peter started, and Jess cut him off.
“And I’m standing there, not having any clue what the hell is going on, but I don’t have any bullet holes in me, I’m not in handcuffs, and Nat isn’t trying to bludgeon me, so…  I mean, all things considered, that’s about the best I could hope for.  So I look at Nat, and she shrugs, and says, ‘he wants you to make breakfast.’”
She took it, her cheeks going pink as she buried her face in the velvety petals.  “Thank you, Steve, they're lovely.”
“She managed to get in touch with Henry Pym, an old graduate student of my father’s, who still remembered my mother.  He promised to help, any way he could.”  She stopped, grinning at Steve.  “He’s not much good in a crisis, but his fiance is.  I think you’ve met her.”  Steve blinked at her, confused, and Bobbi gave a quick spin, the tails of her coat floating out, almost like a skirt.  “You remember her.  She likes to get hands on with everyone she meets.”
“We can test that later.”  Tony dropped the other glass on the table and it wobbled on its base, tipping over and splashing its contents across the metal surface.  Tony didn’t seem to notice.  He slid his hands into Steve’s hair, his eyes searching Steve’s.  “Tell me you’re all right.”
Bruce’s smile faded. “Nothing.  Sorry.”
Tony's face cleared.  “Saw something hanging on the back of the door,” he said, waving an idle hand in that direction.  “Seems more your speed than mine.”  He cupped his hands beneath the graceful arch of the faucet, letting the water fill the hollows of his palms.  He splashed the water against his face, and Steve shivered.
“Marry me.”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “I'm-  No.”
"Why would you possibly take that job?" Tony asked her.  "In all seriousness.  What was wrong with your life at the moment that you decided to accept my offer of employment?"
“We both know it wasn’t any of your doing,” she said, with a slight smile.  She was a matronly woman, tall and broad, with snow white hair swept up in a precise twist at the crown of her head, and tiny round spectacles perched on the end of her nose.  She had a stern stare, when she wanted to put someone in their place, but she was quick with praise and warm smiles.
“And that’s why you have no money,” Tony said.
Tony’s fingers flexed on the banister.  “Are you deaf as well as dumb?” he asked, and there was ice in his words, cold and cutting.  “I said, you’re fired.  Collect your things and get out.  I’ll have a car brought around for you, but that is the end of it.”
“But not enough to stop you from eating them,” Tony said.
She pouted at him.  “How bout we just make out for a while and see what happens?”  She played with a curl, wrapping the shining strand of hair around her finger.  “Bet I can make you forget what’s happening out there.”
“Show of hands.  Who here has to regularly deal with bad guys making inappropriate sexual comments during fights?” Tony asked, glancing at the team.
"Right." Stark reached for his plans.  "So.  That being said, what's your play?"
“Gun,” Jarvis said, scrambling across the floor, the coffee pot still held in a death grip.  “Mrs. Parker, the-”
“‘Yet?’” Steve repeated.
“We ain’t been before, why start now?” someone asked, and Steve shook his head.
"Right, you got it," Tony said, and DJ grinned up at him.  He tipped out a drawer, grabbing for the next thing.  Screws.  Nails.  Wood that had been rubbed smooth, metal that had been cut in intricate waves.  DJ considered each one, like a puzzle piece, like a riddle, matching tools to their work, one after another, keeping Tony busy with words and shapes, his pencil darting over every square inch of the paper.
“And Parker left half a durian milkshake in the back of my car, and now everything smells like dead socks dipped in rotten dairy,” Tony said.
“What hospital did you take him to?” Steve said, falling into step behind Happy.
“It was one time,” Stephen said, as Clea snapped the book shut and dropped it.  Without looking, he snapped his fingers, and the volume slowed, pivoting gently through the air to land, already open to the proper page, in the palm of his hand.  He frowned down at it.  “Do we even have access to the heart of a slain demon lord?  Or fresh cherries?”
“Making sure that you’re the only fool I have to deal with today,” Strange said, finishing with a flourish.  For an instant, the symbol hung in the air, a gleaming, glittering construction of light, spinning in place.
“Maybe two mattresses,” he said to Danvers.  “Even a straw tick-”
“Sit.  Still,” Bruce snapped.  “They're after you.  If you get up-”
“Your professional opinion has been noted,” Tony said, trying to take the sting out of that with a lopsided smile.  “And ignored.”
“It's terrorism,” Rhodey said, and everyone glanced at him.  “State sponsored, but...”
“Acceptable,” she said.  She looked at Steve, tucking a whirl of dark hair behind her ear.  “Steve?   Do you want to look at the menus?”
“Told you,” Tony said, and he sounded so smug that Steve couldn't hold back a laugh.
Steve felt his face heat, but there was no judgement on Jarvis’ face, just a slight, puckish smile.  “He…  May have outgrown that,” he said.
DJ’s smile died, and he looked up at Tony, the back at Steve.  “Now?”
He paused.  “I’d been Phillips’ primary adviser for twenty years.  I was already an old man.  I had no family.  No heirs.  I am on the throne as a stopgap measure, Captain.  Because the country needed a king, and putting me there was a stalling tactic.  For the five or ten years that I lived to rule, the noble houses could work behind the scenes.  Make arrangements.  Prepare for the day I died.”
“What’s he going to tell them?” Natasha asked him.  “That Anthony Stark has a secret high tech facility under his mansion and he’s building a private army made up of ex-mobsters, scientists, carnies and military operatives?”
“Nothing!” Bruce said, with more force than was absolutely necessary.  Everyone stared at him.  He took a breath.  “Okay.  So.  There might've been more alcohol in the punch than I'd realized.  It was a scientific symposium, I wasn't expecting the punch to be spiked.”
Steve blinked at nothing in particular.  “Right,” he said.  He reached up, pressing a fisted hand to his lips.  “Right.”
“Pretty sure it didn’t,” Steve said.  “Nat can handle this, do you need me to-”
“Only because they don't know about him.”  The words hung between them, and Tony shook his head.  “Can we discuss this later?  When we're not about to put on a good face in front of him?”
“Now what?” Bucky called, and she stopped.
Jesse threw her hands in the air.  "Yeah.  I think they did."
"We can't touch them."
“Can you just worry about your own sandwich?” Steve asked him, amused.
"ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLWAYS," Val said, her voice rising to a painful pitch.  DJ tried not to flinch, his back teeth locking as he held himself still.  Val put a hand over her mouth.  "Sorry, Deej."
“No,” Steve said, and before Happy could grab him, he plowed forward, putting the full weight of his rage behind the force of his rush.  The shield slammed into someone, lifting a mobster off of his feet, and with a flick of his arm, Steve sent the body crashing into the side of a warehouse.  He spun on his heel, meeting another rush head on, his feet digging into the wood of the pier.
Clint winced.  "Right," he said, reaching up to mute the unit with fingers that were surprisingly steady.  "So.  I'm fucked."
“And I wash my hands of it,” Pepper said.  She braced an elbow on the bar, looking around.  “Even for you, Tony, this is…  This is a lot.”
Her mouth went tight, but she didn’t fight him any more.  “We’ll do the dishes,” she said, pressing a napkin into his hands.  “Be careful.”  He nodded, his hands closing around the cloth.  He felt the weight of it and knew what it was, not that either of them would ever acknowledge it.   It was too dangerous for both of them.
“She’s a very helpful lady,” Jan said.  She held her hands out to DJ.  “Hello, my darling.  Come here, you’re covered in flour.”
“Yes!” DJ said.  “All.”
“Can I have my phone, please?” Tony asked.
“So when he strode up to me in the churchyard, I wasn’t fully sure I hadn’t lost my mind.”  She smiled.  “Because he stalked up, his jaw set, Miss Potts just a step behind him, and said, ‘I need a housekeeper.’”
“We are not eating breakfast until the child opens something,” Tony said, his voice dire.  “I wrapped things!  There are-  I bought things without looking at a pre-prepared list, and I wrapped them.  Myself!”
“We can send someone for him,” Pepper offered.
"You are full of lies, Ning, your offense fell off a cliff last weekend," John said.
“Don't forget to come back down when you're done,” Clint said.  He tapped his spatula on the rim of the plate.  “Peter!  Come eat, you've got school.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Jess dug through the mess on the table in front of her, coming up with the original catering suggestions.  “To keep you from ordering overpriced, under-spiced taco platters from a caterer named Bunnie?” She looked from the pages to Jan and back.  “I’m not letting you live this down.  I’m going to publicly shame you about this.”
“Candid.  Someone snapped a picture of him at the flower market, it's all over the place now.  Amateur, but someone either got lucky, or has a natural sense of composition, cause it's pretty good.”
Tony pushed away from the bannister, disappearing into his office, and rage swept over Steve like a wave.
“Two of them are well past the age for needing-” Clint looked back at Darcy, who was grinning at him, pure chaos alight in her face, and he settled back into his seat.  “I’ll wait here.”
Tony nodded.  “I’m sorry,” he said, and for some reason, Steve believed him.   His thumb smoothed over the crystal face of the watch.  “Did-”
Steve switched legs.  “Emergency-”
Pepper exhaled, the strain going out of her shoulders.  “Bless you, Jarvis.”
He blinked.  “Ran the numbers.  A long time ago.”
Tony grinned at the neat arrangement of chemical bonds.  “Caffeine,” he said.
There was a beat of silence, one that he'd learned to recognize.  His eyes opened.  “Don't lie.”
"Well, how'd that go?" Steve said.
A high, warbling whistle came through the fog, soft at first, and then growing in volume.  The thug in front of Steve took a step back, and another, his eyes narrowing as he tried to peer through the shadows.  “Who’s that?” he snapped at one of his men, who shook his head.  The thug jerked his head to the side, biting out a curse.  “Idiot.  Go check.”
“I mean, it’s not my choice, but you’re-” That was as far as he got before Jan fed him the cookie.
“Where did you even get that?” Steve asked, his lips curling. But Tony's breath had already evened out, going slow and deep. Steve heaved a sigh, so happy that he couldn't bring himself to care. “Okay, we're clearly back home, because we're not moving,” he said. “And it's-” He fumbled for his jacket. “Where's my phone?”
Steve held up his plate.  “I’m just here to eat pastry,” he said.
“Nerd,” Carol said, hopping past with Jess clinging to her back.
“Didn’t have a clue,” Clint agreed.  “But he gestured at the door, and Nat got off of the shelves, and we were force marched out of the library, down the main stairs, down the back stairs, and into the kitchen.  Stark’s got the vase in the crook of one arm and the gun in the other, and he’s chattering away in French the entire time.
The waitstaff Jan had hired had been efficient and well trained.  Before they’d left for the night, they’d wrapped up the excess food and collected the used dishes and glassware, filling the fridge and the dishwasher.  Despite their best efforts, though, a few pieces had escaped their notice, and Steve busied himself tossing the occasional discarded napkin or bit of food, collecting plates from side tables and from the floor beside chairs.
Grabbing the doorknob, he pushed the door open, leaning into the room.  “DJ?”
Tony rolled his shoulders.  “When did you gain insight into the human condition, Jay?  Was this, when was this allowed?  I disapprove.”  He pointed in the general direction of the nearest camera.  “Want to make that clear.  This is my disapproval face.”
“I know right where it’s stored, and I’d do it myself, but I need a lookout,” she said, the words so quick that they were almost running together.  “I know who will be working that night, and if you can just-”
She nodded.  "Yes, can you point him out to me if you-"
Nat picked up her bowl.  “On it,” she said.  “Meet you in the gym?”  Jan nodded.  “Give me ten to get the equipment we need.  It was a late night, I'm going to have trouble moving it.”
Steve's skin iced over, but he kept his face still.  In the pool, Rhodey raised his arm in a wave.  “You going to be staying for lunch, Agent Coulson?”
He knew this kitchen like the back of his hand, even if his own body felt foreign to him now.  Ignoring the words that echoed in his ears, in his head, he headed for the house, forcing himself forward, step by torturous step.
“Well.”  Clint pushed away from the counter, his head swinging back towards the stove.  “You gotta understand, Nat’s never been one to go down without a fight.
Steve wandered through the market, catching snippets of conversation as he passed carts and stalls. Vendors doing their best to sell their wares, buyers gossiping about politics and commerce and their neighbors.  A young girl sitting behind a cart piled high with fruit split her attention between her customers and a tall, lanky boy sweeping the street in front of a nearby bakery, flour streaking the legs of his pants.  A thin, pale man with small, round glasses sold flowers, a little boy wrapping the bouquets with loops of twine and handing them over with a gap toothed smile.  A short, round woman had a massive basket in the crook of her elbow, piled high with eggs.  Two young men hovered by the window of a milliner's shop, deep in discussion about the hats on display.
“I'll let them get a few questions in, and then I'll cut them off,” she said.  “If I try to head it off now, it'll just get out of hand.”  She leaned against the wall next to him, her arms crossed over her chest.  “Marcy knows what she's doing.  If it gets out of hand, she'll handle it.”
“I am not bartending.” Luke held up his hands.  “I'm telling you all this now.  Not.  Bartending.”
“Me, too,” he said as they reached the car.  Bobbi had the door open, and she tapped the butt of the revolver against the top of the car like a ticking clock.  Tony grinned at her.  “Steve’s fine,” he announced.
“I do my best,” she said.  “Mrs. Parker, this is delicious.”
It was a stupid thing to ask, and he regretted it the moment the words had left his lips.  But DJ just shook his head.  “No,” he said.  “Don’t remember.”  He smiled a little.  “Easier.  When you don’t remember.”
“Someone is coming for you.  As soon as they can.  We love you, we won't forget you.”  Tony leaned in, pressing a kiss to DJ's hair.  “Someone is always going to come for you, Deej.  Always.  As long as someone's still out there, we're going to find you.  I promise.”
When they broke apart, Tony was breathing hard, and Steve's heart was pounding in his ears.  Tony's fingers flexed against the fabric of his shirt, his knuckles white with the force of his grip.  Neither of them moved away, staying too close, their bodies almost touching, their breath mingling in bare inches between their mouths.
"Pretty good," he said.  "Who're you wearing today?"
Steve gave her a look.  “No,” he said.  “I have a map.”
“As a special treat,” Tony said.  Steve glanced at Pepper, who nodded.
“Jesus,” Jessica said.  “I regret that code name so much.”
Tony looked away.  “I’d let you go hungry,” he said.  “But Mrs. Parker’s kinder than I am.”  He smiled down at DJ.  “You, meanwhile, need to eat.  Up we go.”
“Any time,” DJ said, and Tony nodded.
“It's information you can trust,” Tony said.  Someone behind Tony moved, a machine rattling as it was bumped, and Steve flinched, his body going tense.  Tony looked back over his shoulder.  “Okay.  Thanks for your help.  You can all go.”
Steve’s head was swimming, and god, everything hurt in the best possible way.  “That’s…  That’s a bad idea,” he managed.  Tony’s hand cupped his cheek, and without thinking, Steve turned his head, pressing a kiss against his palm.  “Isn’t it?”
“This might require us to contact the police,” Steve pointed out.  “We can’t keep them there indefinitely.”
“Everything's in your job description,” Tony told her. “I should know.  I wrote it.  And I can rewrite it.”
Tony slammed the door.  “Are you sick?”  He tossed the plate at the counter, and it hit with a clatter, scattering its contents.  “How long?”
Steve smoothed Tony’s hair away from his face.  “As quickly as possible,” he admitted.
Sam studied him.  “Jessica and Luke put the art stuff over in the library for now,” he said.
DJ took a deep breath, and let it out, and then there was no need for breathing.  Things went flat and stable, all the confusing feelings and exhaustion and strain gone in an instant.  Just like that, he was balanced and controlled and things made sense.
There was a soft knock at the door, and Tony looked up, grateful for any interruption that he could get.  “Come in and take this away,” he called.  “I want this individual evicted from my library immediately.”
On the nightstand, his phone started to vibrate, the sound painfully loud in the silence of the room.  Tony fumbled out with one hand, slapping at it with numb fingers, desperate to make the sound stop.  Mercifully, it did, and he rolled back onto his stomach, burying his face in his pillow.
“I've already-” Steve started, but Mrs. Parker took his elbow with a firm grip.
“In that case, please send her my apologies,” Steve said, with a faint smile.  “I've got other plans.”  With a brisk nod in their direction, he headed for the door.
As the last song came to an end, the dancers taking a well deserved bow, the boys burst into applause, stomping their feet and cheering.  Someone blew a sharp, enthusiastic whistle, and DJ flinched, his hands coming up to cover his ears.  Tony, clapping politely along, gave him a curious look.
“Aren't you greedy?” he said, popping the rest of the spring roll into his mouth.
“My husband Ben worked for StarkIndustries,” she said.  “A night watchman.  It was a tough job, but the pay was good, and it meant he could be around in the afternoons, when Peter was coming home from school.”
“Brooklyn,” Tony said.
There was nothing there, and it was moving.
Tony leaned back against the pillows.  “I got hurt,” he said, because that seemed to be the easiest way to say it.  “But we weren’t alone.  Were we?”  DJ shook his head.  “That’s right.  Pepper and Rhodey and Happy were there, and they took care of me.  Of us.”
May raised a foot, tapping it lightly on the side of his ankle.  “Trust me.  When you find a partner you want to dance with, the view’s much better at eye level.”
"I don't know."  Steve gave him a tense shrug, his shoulders jerking upwards.  "Volunteering.  Stuffing envelopes for a charity.  Washing their dog."  His eyes slid in Tony's direction.  "They need a hobby."
“Darcy’s coming,” he said, and Darcy smiled up at him, her expression beatific.
Exhausted and wired in equal parts, he headed back downstairs to get cleaned up.  His shower, while usually reliable, wasn't big enough for two, another reason to prefer Tony's apartment to his.  And tonight, he probably needed one.
He stared at the blank monitor, not sure if he wanted to or not.  Watching it would be an agony, but wondering what was happening would've been worse.  “Yes.  Please.”
Bruce looked up, meeting Tony’s gaze with unfocused eyes.  “What seating are we on?” he asked.
“I’m not,” Harris said, even as he resisted being dragged back into place.  “I’m just-”
Pepper's chin dropped in something like a nod.  "Stane," she agreed.  She shifted her weight, her arms crossed over her chest.  "It's all legal, Tony.  Everything they've got, they officially licensed."
She let out a soft laugh, her head shaking.  “You’re too clever by half again,” she said, but she turned to face him, her arms crossed over her chest.  “If there were old ones here, Stevie, I would think they’d long since been driven from this place, where there’s nothing green left, and precious little sky.  The steel and stone covered this island, long, long ago.”
It sat down next to Harris’ plate.  It reached out with one paw, tapping the edge of the china.  Harris picked it up and moved it out of the way, and the cat immediately took its place, staring at Harris with fathomless eyes.
"A couple of the boys, they slipped out at night an' went all the way cross town to find Rogers, an' they told him what was happening, best they could, I suppose.  But when the fella came by the next morning to sign the paperwork an' pick up Mick, Rogers was waiting for him." The boy's teeth flashed in a smile that was sharp and hard and vicious.  "Ain't none of us knows what was said, Miss, but Rogers put the fear of the good Lord into that one.  None of us ever saw him round these parts again."
“Right.  Somehow, not surprised,” Harris said, bracing his elbow on the arm of the couch.  He leaned a cheek into his palm.  “You going to reply to his email?”
Tony’s mouth worked for a moment.  “He’s gone, Steve.”  Too late, Steve realized that he was shaking, his hands in fists at his sides.  “I-”  Tony’s voice broke, and his head went down, and then back up, his chin a hard line.  “He’s gone, and it’s...”
Grinning, Steve caught Happy's elbow, whispering an address to him. “Just give the barman a few dollars and tell him Rogers wants this guy tucked away for a few hours. He'll let you in the back and treat you like a king.”
Shuri pointed her knife at him, the tip waggling back and forth.  “I am going to have a front row seat for your coronation,” she said. “So I can savor the look of panic on your face.”
“No.” Clint held up his hands. “No.  This is getting-” He stabbed a finger at one Stephen Strange, and the the other.  They both opened their mouths, and Clint threw his hands in the air.  “First guy in a red cape who says anything is going to get an arrow in an incredibly sensitive portion of his anatomy.”
“Communication.  That's why this relationship works,” Tony said, banking hard around the corner of a building.  Hulk was still ahead of them, taking the city in great leaps.  Tony couldn't go as fast as he wanted, not with Steve clinging to his side, but Hulk was clearly not making any effort to shake them.  "Jay?  Can you warn the bratbot that he's going to get a guest real soon?"
Steve's eyes darted towards her driver, who hid a smile behind one broad palm.  "Back seat," he said, shutting Miss Pott's door.  "I'll get the door for you."
Tony waited.  She just started a him, her gaze level.  “Yes?” he said at last.
He smiled at Steve.  “Thank you.”
“It only has to work once, honestly, so-”
DJ scrambled to his feet, heading back towards them at a run.  There were blades of grass clinging to his clothes and in his hair, and he’d lost his shoes somehow, but Tony didn’t seem to notice, or care.  He just caught DJ’s hand in his as he went sprinting past, slowing him down to a jog.  “Hungry?”
“I think that basketball was defective,” Steve told him.
Rhodey nodded.  “Yes, sir.”
She bit her lower lip.  “If I did,” she said at last, “He wouldn’t still be in his house, Tony.  But…”
“See that you do,” Aunt May called after him, because he was already scrambling past Jarvis, taking the stairs two at a time.  The wooden steps, worn smooth by all those who had gone before him, were cold against his bare feet.  Behind him, he could hear Jarvis and Aunt May still talking, their voices echoing down the staircase, mingling with the sound of his footsteps.
Stephen Strange sighed, a faint, almost inaudible exhalation, and Tony resisted the very real urge to lunge over the workbench, straight for his throat.  Steve, who knew him a little too well, rested a hand on his shoulder, half comfort and half restraint, and Tony sucked in a long, slow breath from between clenched teeth.  “You lost-”
“He’ll be outside.  In the orchard,” Clint said.
Steve held out a hand, stopping him in his tracks.  “I’m…”  He took a deep breath.  “I’m not coming back, Jarvis.”
Steve  looked past him.  There, at the foot of the bed, DJ was curled into a loose ball of limbs around Furbro, one bare foot trailing across the quilt, and one hand resting gently on Furbro’s flank.  The cat was purring, a low sustained rumble, and DJ was snoring along with him.
Tony leaned his weight into the rolling pin, his teeth clenched against the throbbing pain behind his temples.  “I’m getting that impression, yeah.”
Pepper, for her part, was smiling down at the boys who were crowding around her, her face amused. “Shove off, all of you,” Steve said, cutting through the crowd. “Let the lady breathe.”
A rumble of sound from Steve's shoulder brought everyone's head around.  Steve stared down, nonplussed, at Clint, who appeared to have fallen asleep standing up, his body propped up by Steve's.  His head was twisted at an odd angle, his mouth hanging open against Steve's shoulder, and in the stunned silence of the room, his next snore was obscenely loud.
“You’re lucky you’re amusing,” Moondragon said, idly flipping through a magazine, her booted feet propped on her desk.  “Caiera’s got a client, so as soon as she’s done, we can start.”
Steve's words died in his throat.  “What?”
“Great.  Just give the cat some of that,” Danvers said, turning around to face Steve.  “Some supplies are being boxed up and we’ll send a cadet over.  The market’s your best place to find anything else.  If you need to change your coin, head to the central bank, but most of the merchants’ll take foreign money, even if they’re not going to give you the best deal on it.”
He closed his eyes, hugging DJ tight.  “Try to believe that, okay?”
Steve watched him go.  “Deliveries?” he asked the guard.
Clint groaned, his eyes rolling up towards the ceiling.  “Stark.  Seriously.  No.  No one respects you, because you hate everyone who respects you.  You-” He spread his hands.  “Hate them.”
Pepper fell silent for a second.  “You're not nine, Tony,” she said at last.
“Hey, guys!” Jess said, her voice obnoxiously cheery.  “Want to know how she asked me out?”
She paused.  “You didn't used to be,” she agreed.  She folded her legs beneath her, one pale foot tucked neatly under her knee.  “You like schedules.  You like to know when things are happening, and where you should be, don't you?”
“You do, it’s so disappointing.” She leaned into him, and laughing, Tony wrapped his arms around her in a hug.  “Don’t you dare try to comfort me, I’m not to be comforted.”
A small giggle brought his head up.
Little, terrifyingly small, hands clutched at the fabric.  “No,” he whispered.  His mouth went tight.  “Just...  Small.”
“That sounds great, but-” Peter sucked in a breath.  “Bruce sent me.  Tony's sick, and he's not, uh-” He rubbed a hand on the back of his neck.  “He's not listening to reason?”
Tony stifled a smile.  "Like what, exactly?"
Steve looked up just in time to see Tony throw open the kitchen door, looking back over his shoulder.  “Carol’s kidnapping about a fifth of the team, are we concerned about this?”
“Whoa,” Steve said, catching his arm.  “I can get it.”
Tony threw his hands in the air and headed for the kitchen.  DJ, Darcy and Harris all watched him go, their heads swiveling in his wake like spectators at a tennis match.
Tony's smile stretched wide.  "I did good, then."
“And…  They sent this via email?”  The cat was purring, and Harris rubbed its cheek.  “They…  Don’t know who you are, do they?”  DJ shook his head.  “Do they know you’re a teenager?”
“Fast,” Rhodes said with a grin, rolling up his sleeves.  There was a toolbox within easy reach, and he pushed it open with a practiced movement.  “Very fast.”
“No, sir, or I would not have done so.”
Sam shook his head.  “You won’t be.  I just need to check in with the Captain, then we’ll be heading out.”  He held the reins with one hand, his head on a swivel, watching as people moved past them.  “There’s an old cottage just outside the walls of the city, down by the river.  Used to belong to the gatekeeper, back when that was a job that could be done by one man.  The King let the last gatekeeper keep it, after he retired.  He passed away about a year ago, it’s been empty since then.”
He was good at that, too.
“You mean, you won’t,” Obie corrected.
“It would've gone better if you had, you know, helped,” Tony said.
Tony waited until the doors were shut before he reached up, catching Steve's collar with one finger, dragging him down.  “You're surprisingly attractive when you're indignant, you know that?”
“So?  Doesn’t mean I gotta do it,” Matt said, darting out of reach when Billy shook a fist at him.  Laughing, he scrambled up the stairs.  “I’m not doing your share!”
“We have a cat now,” Tony said, his voice dire.  “And I already have carpet burn on my face, so I think I'll stay standing.”
Steve nodded.  “Will he be forgiving if we don't turn a profit?”
Laughing, Steve headed out after Bucky.  “I’ll leave you to your plotting,” he said.  “But if he disappears, I’m going to have to go find him again.”  Behind him, Sam groaned, and Steve hid his smile, breaking into a jog until he caught up with Bucky.  “Do you know where you’re going?”
“Good.” Tony reached out, his fingers just brushing over DJ’s hair.  “Thank you for checking on me.  And-”  He tried to smile.  “I’m sorry I scared you.”
Steve grinned at Tony.  “That's the least of what you said about me.”
“How do you-”
“I’ll see what I can do.”
“It's a double edged weapon, it's true,” Steve said.  Tony saw his head cant to the side. “So.  Now that you know I've been properly vetted, can I come up?”
Okoye’s lips twitched, the ghost of a smile.  “I know you too well for that, your Highness,” she said, and Shuri burst out laughing.  Okoye glanced in her direction, her expression melting into affection in an instant.  “And value you too highly.”
"NING."
Clint looked at DJ.  “Would I give you a ‘What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas’ t-shirt in your world?” he asked.  DJ thought about that for a second, and then nodded.  “See?  On brand.”
“That kid is shameless,” Steve said.  He grabbed his coffee cup and headed towards the living room.  A few minutes later, he leaned through the doorway.  Clint was snoring softly, his arms thrown out on the back of the couch, his head tipped back at a painful looking angle.  Next to him, there was a huge pile of blankets, one familiar foot poking out of the tangle of fabric.  “Hey,” Steve said, his voice pitched low.  “Time to wake up, you two.”
“Fine.  Wake me when it's afternoon,” Tony said, throwing an arm over his eyes.  “Or evening.  Or possibly tomorrow.”
“You’re an idiot,” Rhodey said, but he was trying not to smile.
Tony nodded.  "Jessica?"
“Need money?” Clint parroted.  He tossed the last of the towels into the laundry basket.  “Wait.  You?  You need money?”  DJ gave a quick nod, his face hopeful.  Clint stared at him.  “You need money,” he said again.
"Leave it," she mouthed. There was an odd look on her face. "Don't-" She shook her head. "Leave it all."
Steve's cheeks went pink.  “Look, I asked the girl in the bookstore for a popular comic, because-” Tony just stared at him, his eyebrows arched.  Steve leaned forward.  “Give me that.”
Jan ignored him.  “I've been looking into venues for my soiree,” she said.  She looked down at her tablet.  “It's difficult finding something large enough, with the extras that I want.”  Her nose wrinkled.  “The best places are booked, of course, but there's still some options.”
“You’ve seen us kiss,” Jan said.
Stark took it, his fingertips dirty against the crisp paper.  "Wonderful," he said, his voice cutting.  He leaned back against the billiard table, his hips canted forward as he flipped through the pages.  "I don't suppose he had anything useful to say?"
“Nice boxers,” she said, and Tony considered shame but it seemed far too late for that.  Jess was wearing two t-shirts layered on top of each other, and Tony was pretty sure one was hers and the other was Carol’s, over a pair of oversized red silk pajama pants.
“Did I order all of this?”
“This group likes science,” Tony said, grinning despite himself.  “And plausible deniability.”
He was smiling at Tony like Tony was all that he wanted, all that he needed, and Tony forgot what he'd been trying to say.
“Yes, yes, and no,” Steve said.
“But Agatha has faced her before.  And she’s very hard to trick.”
Clint blinked at him.  “Phil.  We’re not going to elope.”
"Wow."
Isaiah’s cane tapped against the floor.  “You seem just fine now,” he said, his voice quiet.  “Other than running a real risk of ending up with your tie in a bleach bucket.”
Steve took a deep breath and let it out.  All right.  It had been a long night.  A very long night.  He was pretty sure he’d now kissed or been kissed by literally every single person at this party.  The law of averages had to favor him eventually.
He tottered over to his chair, hefting himself into it with an audible grunt of displeasure.  Next to their forms, he set a mug of tea.  "Now.  Where were we?"  Tony gaped at him, his mouth hanging open, and the officer glanced from him, to Steve, and back.  "Did you drink the coffee?" he asked.
“They’re very enthusiastic,” DJ said.  “Very enthusiastic.  And most humans get a headache after looking at them for more than a minute at a time.”
"Peggy loved me, and I loved her,” Steve said.  “And Bucky could do better than me, anyway.”  He shifted in his chair.  “I can't hurt the dead, Tony.  And Marcy was right about something else.  The damage is done.  Even if I wanted to deny it, that's-”  He shrugged.  “That's out there.  There's no getting it back, no changing people's minds.  The ones who want to believe it are going to, the ones that don't, well, they'll have to deal with it.”
“If it helps, it was very uncomfortable for me as well,” Clea said.
Memory echoed through him, and something like laughter bubbled through his chest.  He’d stared into the nothing in the barrel of a gun before, once before, or more, he couldn’t remember any more, he couldn’t remember anything.
“Yeah, Peter's gettin' too mature for us,” Happy said, before the two of them crashed into the quilt.  Jarvis took the chicken away from them.  Neither of them seemed to notice.
“My birthday’s just a few months away,” Steve pointed out.
DJ considered that, the toe of one sneaker flicking against the leg of his chair.  “People say that,” he said, sounding almost apologetic.  “A lot.”
Tony took a breath.  “I haven’t figured that out yet.”  Jarvis nodded, and Tony tapped his finger against the side of his glass.  “What do you think I should do?”  It came out more plantative than he’d expected, hollow and empty.  He sounded like a child, and he hated it.  “Never mind.  I know what you think.”
“Deej?” Steve leaned his elbow on the back of his seat, looking back at DJ.  “Pretty sure we had leftovers from last night.” His head tipped forward.  “Clint would probably be okay with tacos.”
Rogers reached out, tapping gently on the front of the faceplate with one knuckle.  “Can I see your face?” he asked, and it was so soft, so gentle that Tony barely heard him.
Stepehn looked up.  “What?”  He looked back down at the watch.  “Oh.  Yes.”  His hand closed, and it dissipated, light trickling through his fingers for an instant before going dark.    He looked up.  “I need to speak to an old friend, and I suspect you would not want me to do so here.”
"You can thank him by using that," she said.  She smiled.  "Be safe, you hear?"
“Yes, I know,” she said, her voice strained.  “Is something wrong?  Tony does not miss DJ's calls.”
Tony looked up, his eyes dancing.  “Changing the subject?” he asked.
Steve braced his hands on the tabletop, leaning into them.  "Side hustles aside-"
Steve crossed to them, taking the page from Maguire.  His name was scrawled on the outside, in O’Brien’s familiar hand.  He opened it, scanning the few lines in a matter of moments.  He stopped.  Went back to the beginning.  Reread it again.  And a third time.  Turned the page over.  But other than his name on one side, and a few short, succinct sentences on the other, it was blank.
“Jail, shot, going out the window which results in you breaking your leg and also getting shot, and…” Steve prompted.
“Well, that depends on who you ask,” Clint pointed out.  Steve stared at him, and Clint grinned.  “Did you ask Mr. Stark?  Because he seems to think-”
Bruce nodded.  “I’m going to go-” He held up a tea bag.  “Make this on a bunsen burner.”
"Jan has got you so hoodwinked, it's not even funny.  She is absolutely the cause of like, 90% of our problems, but when you show up, she just acts surprised."  Tony spread his hands, looking around with wide eyes. "'Who could've done this?  We have no enemies?'"
“Bad idea,” he managed, but she knew better than he did, that was obvious, and he managed not to trip over his own feet or kick her in the shins.  “Right, that worked better than expected, let’s not risk trying it a second-”
“Sir?”
That was as far as he got before Stark shrugged off his robe, the silk sliding off of his shoulders and down the length of his muscular arms, and Steve swallowed his tongue.  Clad only in a small, mid-thigh length pair of crimson red shorts, Stark tossed his robe at the nearest unoccupied chair.
“Okay, in my defense-” Carol said.
“You may find this difficult to believe, but I have quite enjoyed your company.” Jarvis took a deep breath, his shoulders going into a tight line.  “May I sit?”
He leaned over, collecting a rook from the base of the chair, where it had ended up.  “But if you want to talk about hired help getting ideas above their station-” He set it down, gently, so, so gently, into its spot.  “The same would apply to you.”
“It might be,” Steve said.  “You need help with-”  Isaiah's head shot up, his black eyes locking on Steve with laser-like focus, and Steve's hands went up in an immediate pose of surrender.  “Right.  Nope.  You don't.  Sorry I asked.  I'll just be over here.  Hiding.”
“It would work,” Sam said.  “Don't you doubt me, you haven't had a date in what, seventy years?”
“That is quite enough.”
Clint smirked up at him.  “Don’t know if you’ve met Phil,” he said, folding his hands on the flat of his stomach.  “Tall guy.  Lanky.  Would be banned from a poker convention for having zero tells of any sort?  Might not have a pulse?  Had to reveal he was still alive with a memo that ended up going viral amongst several governmental agencies?” His eyebrows arched.  “You’re asking what will happen when your ex-girlfriend and current CEO asks about his wild time in Vegas?  Let’s just say that I’m not real concerned about his ability to make up a cover story on the fly, Tony.”
On the bedside table, Furbro looked up from the nest of tissues DJ had made for him.  “Walk?” DJ asked.  Furbro considered him, head tipped to the side, then yawned and snuggled back down, his tail flopped over his nose.  DJ smiled at him.  “Guess not.”
“Glad we could still provide a few surprises,” Steve said.  He leaned forward.  “They-  Whoever they are, they know we’re coming.”
He stopped, gave his head a quick shake.  “I say stupid things,” he said.  “All the time.”  He looked at Steve.  “So what was that about?”
His eyes closed, and he made a soft, broken sound that bordered on obscene.
“Good.  Let him get away with nothing.”  The old lady gave Steve a quick once-over, her dark eyes narrowed.  “I’ll give him his own portion,” she said to Tony, giving the contents of the kettle a stir.  “And in exchange, next time there’s a storm, you check with me first.” She stabbed a finger at him.  “First, you understand?”
“Did you get close enough to hear them?” Bobbi asked, folding her arms on the banister.  She leaned forward, one booted foot tapping against the floor.  “What are they fighting about now?
“I have a suitcase on the jet,” Tony said, fiddling with his phone.  “DJ?  We can have some stuff waiting for you at the hotel, if you want?”
“That would be the cat,” Jarvis explained.  “He is rather particular about his feeding rituals.  Dummy has the instructions.”
Tony shifted, and the teenager glanced up, his dark eyes sharp.  His smile stretched.  “Hey, man,” he said, catching Steve's attention.  “Think your boyfriend's awake.”
"Now, Miss Potts, we both know nothing could be further from the truth,” Jarvis said.  He smiled down at the boy.  “I am here to serve, and I'm quite pleased to be serving you.”  He sketched a slight bow, his back ramrod straight.  “If you'd like to come with me, I'll introduce you to the rest of the staff, young sir."  His voice was warm, soft and kind and coaxing, the sort of voice a child could trust, and when he held out his hand, the boy took it.
Peter took a deep breath.  “You can’t just START him on advanced calculus, Mr. Stark.  You-”  His pencil beat a rapid tattoo on the paper.  “We need to make sure he has a solid grounding in the basics, otherwise-”  His eyes narrowed. “Chaos.”
“Refreshingly honest, actually,” Rhodey said, his arms crossed over his chest.   He could hear Steve talking, but the words were too low for him to make out, and he was honestly glad of that.  Every so often, DJ would shift in place, or scrub the back of his wrist across his nose.
“I’m sorry,” Stevee started, but Tony was already waving him off.
DJ reached up, his fingers tangling in the fabric.  He tugged the collar forward, over his head, until it hung like a mask in front of his eyes.  He rocked to the side, peeking under the edge, and ducking back out of sight again.  Tony waited, his arms folded on his knees, as DJ fumbled with the cloth.  “Does that help?” he asked, at last.
DJ let out a giggle, and Steve looked down at his robe.  “It’s a little fluffy,” he admitted with a smile.  “More your sort of thing than mine.”
Tony arched an eyebrow.  “No luck yet?”
Mrs. Parker made a disapproving sound under her breath.   “Officer Rogers, I think it’s time you realized that we notice everything.”  She lifted the lid.  “Such as tonight.  Bobbi was on watch, and while she noticed you coming in, I suspect you didn’t notice her.  She notified Clint, who made up a plate and rang me and here we all are.”
“In Las Vegas.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Everyone at my wedding is either dressed as Tony Stark, or is a Tony Stark, aren’t they?” he said, and Tony started to laugh. Steve grinned down at him, ignoring the way his eyes burned.
“Yes,” Steve said, tossing another log into the fire.
“By which I mean, Sam,” Tony agreed.  He leaned a hand on edge of the serving window. “So, you gonna come out here and hug me, or do I have to keep standing here, looking pathetic, like that one kitten no one wants to adopt from the cardboard box in the grocery store parking lot?” He squinted up at the cloudless night sky, and nodded.  “Looks like rain.  Soon, I’ll be abandoned, unloved, AND soaking wet, so that’ll be-”
"Are you KIDDING me-" was as far as Tony got before Steve reached past him and scooped up both their passports.
Steve managed a smile for him.  “Dinner,” he agreed.  “Go on with Tony.  I’ll see you tonight.”
“You scared me half to death,” Stark seethed, and Rogers nodded.
He didn't realized he'd made a sound until Jarvis moved up next to him.  "Is there a problem, sir?" he asked.
“Yes,” DJ said, his voice firm, and Peter nodded.
“It's Christmas Eve,” Tony said.  “It's-”  He glanced at his watch and nearly dumped the presents on the floor.  He juggled the packages, trying not to lose anything.  Something hit the ground with a crunch.  He ignored it.  “It's seven pm on Christmas eve, don't you think that I might have something better to do right now?”
“I wonder if that really is the case.” She took a piece of garlic bread from Wanda’s plate.  “Your view of the world may not be quite accurate.”
Steve nodded.  “I’ll come get you.”  He tapped the plate with one finger.  “Want the last one?”
But it was a tide, none the less.
“Mrs. Parker has called dibs,” Jarvis said.  He sounded regretful.  “I’m sure when she’s done with him, she will let the rest of us know.”
“Tony would probably drink this,” Hitomi said.  She paused next to DJ, her hand smoothing over his hair.  He glanced up at her, his face adoring.  “Maybe we can show Steve how to make okayu, then he can make it for your father,” she said.  “Much better, when you are sick.”
Bucky didn’t even spare him a glance, his eyes glued on the horizon.  “We all right?” he asked, his hair fluttering against his face with each step his horse took.
But it was clear that they meant something to DJ, and that was all that mattered.
Darcy pointed at him. “And this year?  TWO bottles of rum.”
Tony nodded.  “Any time, Cap.”
“Well, my friends do,” Tony said.  He moved towards the door, only to find he was alone.  He paused, looking back over his shoulder.  Rogers was standing there, a very strange expression on his face.
"Better?" he asked, wiggling his fingers.
“Night,” DJ said.
“Huh, what do you know,” Tony said, staring down at his phone.  “They do.”
Tony’s eyes were brilliant and beautiful and somehow sad.  “But you do,” he said, the words almost inaudible.
“Yes, but the portfolio offering-”
“How long have you known?  Who’s your doctor?  What’s the diagnosis?” Tony asked, and he was frowning for some reason, his face tight, his eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his brows.  “I should’ve known.”
Directly ahead of him, a flicker of light lashed out, like a tongue of flame pushed by the wind.  But this moved, seemingly on its own, to wrap around Steve’s wrist, biting against his skin.  Before he could panic, before he could draw breath to scream, the light burned away, leaving a very human hand in its wake.
Tony took it.  Her grip was firm and her fingers felt cool.  “Thank you.”  He looked at the bench.  “Are you staying for…  Cake?”
“If that drier eats one more of my shirts, I'm going to shove it off the loading dock myself,” Steve said, shoving the apartment door open with his hip, a laundry basket balanced on his other side.  “This is the sixth time that I've-”
His hand snapped out, the coin disappearing in an instant.  “You'll be the first to know, Miss,” he said.  And with a grin and a wink, he ducked out of the room, pulling the door shut behind him.
“Let us know when you get to the vow of silence,” Rhodey said, and Tony gave him a look.  Rhodey grinned at him, utterly unconcerned.  “It would make a nice change.”
“He keeps reacting,” Tony said.  “That’s, that’s all the reason I need.”
Tony's body snapped forward, shooting after it with a roar of his repulsors.  “Still don't know what it's looking for,” he gritted out.  “But I think its found it.”
Bill’s eyes widened.  “Right then,” he said, straightening up.  But behind him, one of the men had turned abruptly toward the street, pulling the collar of his jacket up against a non-existent chill.  Steve stared at him, making note of him in as much detail as he could.  An instant before Happy put the car back in gear, the man glanced back, his eyes catching Steve’s.
“No,” Tony said, because there was no way that question could end well.  “Just…  Just get a cab and I’ll pry the goddamn cleaning equipment out of his hands.”
“Welcome!” DJ said.  He waited until Thor tipped Darcy gently into an empty chair before he placed a small, flat box in her lap.  “For you,” he said, holding a palm-sized box to Thor.
Tony smiled.  “Always,” he said.  “But I'd be better if there was-”
Jan scowled at her.  “I know what you’re doing.”
There was a long moment of silence.  “Is he?”
Steve leaned up against the wall, his head tipped forward, focusing on his feet as the phone rang.  He shifted it to his other hand, doing his best not to drop it or the paper bag in his other hand, never lifting his head up.  He counted the rings and considered disconnecting the line with every single one.
"Yes, that must've hurt," Steve said, his voice wry.  He walked around the far side of the couch.  "C'mon, Tony."  He tucked his phone away and reached for Tony's hands.  "Bedtime."
“Right,” Steve said, running a hand through his wet hair.  “And I’m done.”  He frowned at Tony.  “I thought you were putting DJ to bed.”
“So this?” Rogers waved a hand at the room.  “This is as foreign to him as if he'd ended up in China.”  His hand fell back to his side.  “He must've been....  Scared.”
“Remember when you went to pick up the pizzas for board game night and ended up foiling an armed robbery?” Darcy pointed out.
One look was all it took to confirm that Pepper’s guess was right.  Obie was in a foul mood.
“Oh, yes,” Sue said, trying not to smile.  “My kids would just hate that.  A robot.  That would be just...”  She shook her head.  “That would be horrible.”
Stark huffed out a sigh.  “I involved Thor,” he admitted. “So logically, I know that being pissed off at you right now is stupid, and petty, and not helpful, but I’m still pissed off at you right now,” Stark said.  “And I”m not interested in hearing how stupid, petty and unhelpful that is.”  His hands flexed at his sides, the metal of his gauntlets clicking as his fingers moved.  “I get to be pissed for a while.  I’m not interested in being talked out of it, and I’m sure as hell not feeling fucking guilty about it.  I’m going to be pissed for as long as I want to be pissed, and that’s just something you’re going to have to suck up and deal with.  Understand?”
Steve was already shaking his head.  "No, that's..." He shifted his weight.  "I'm not a guest, sir."
“I thought you were a problem solver!” he called back, spreading his arms wide.  “Give them away!  Make people happy!  Bribe board members!  Or, you know, find a vase, Stark!”  And with that, he was to the elevators and gone.
DJ shifted against his side, his fingers flicking against the edge of the pages, and Steve turned his attention to the words.  "Once upon a time," he said, "there was a little boy who wanted to be a knight."
Steve stared at him.  “Because I...  Wanted it.  So badly.  And now-”  He ran his hands through his hair, pressing his palms against his scalp.  “I did it, and it's-”  His breath caught on something uncomfortably like a sob.  “It's all wrong, Sam, and it's my fault.”
Sam nodded.  “And now you are married.”
“Let's go,” he said, and Tony went.
Steve considered that.  “I have feet?” he said at last.
“Vaisakhi NYC or bust,” Carol said. “Extra spicy.”
Tony struggled against a smile.  “Thank you.  That's very comforting.” There was a knock at the library door, and he looked up.  “Come in.”
“Good talk,” Tony agreed, and hung up the call.  Then he tossed his phone in the general direction of the trash can, which he could do, because he hadn’t thrown up in that trash can, and good for him.
He laughed, and it was sharp and ugly.  “Who needs to buy another one?” he asked, pushing himself upright.  “I’ve got plenty more.  I’ve got-”
“Tell me people don't actually think this way,” Steve said.  He sounded tired, his shoulders slumped forward.
Natasha's lips twitched.  “Of course, sir.” She ducked around Clint, who slid a platter of golden brown pancakes onto the counter before turning back to the stove.  “Let's get you a plate,” she said to DJ, who'd managed to weasel another piece of bacon and some potatoes from Peter.  “Fruit jam or butter?”
Steve's eyes flickered open, and waking was pain followed by an inexplicable sense of loss.  He took a breath, waiting for it to pass.  The pain subsided to a dull ache.  The sense of something missing, something lost, something ruined, did not.
"DJ has inherited from his father certain...  Traits," Jarvis said, the words careful.  Almost delicate.  "Like his father, he has a strong desire to live up to the expectations placed upon him, even if those expectations are unspoken.  Even if they are only in his head.  For his...  Parents, he wants to be perfect, and is well aware that perfection is an impossible goal.  But he still strives for it."
“Thank you, Jarvis.  Always looking out for me,” Tony said, trying not to smile.
“Everyone,” Jarvis agreed.
He turned and headed up the hallway, and Tony fell into step behind him.  “She calmed him down and reassured him, then brought him to his room to rest.  He is likely exhausted.”
"Did Doctor Doom have a hand in your marriage?" someone shouted, and Tony choked on a laugh.
Steve spared a quick look over at DJ, who had plopped down on the lawn, his head tipped back to stare up at the stars.  Safe.  He was safe.  Steve looked back at Tony.  “Will you come back up the stairs with me?” he asked, choosing the words carefully.  “We can keep an eye on him from the porch.”
“Yeah, but I promised Steve I wouldn’t collapse reality in my general vicinity anymore.  Makes him nervous.”  Tony pushed himself to his feet and headed for the storage locker.  “Then again, fuck it, Steve isn’t here, so what the fuck do I care?  Guess it’s Black Hole Happy Hour from here on out.”
Agatha watched him go, one eyebrow arched.  “I am not certain that his intervention is desired, or needed,” she said.
Peter considered that.  “That seems like a trap,” he admitted, and Tony nearly lost it.
Tony's teeth locked.  Definitely annoying.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. "Thank you," he said, and he sounded exhausted. "It is as if God created that man specifically to enrage me."
Steve smiled back, then sat  down.  He looked down at his bowl, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw Rhodes smile at Miss Potts, and she smiled back, her face lit with it.  Steve flicked the spoon against the side of his bowl.  “Excuse me,” he said, giving the soup a stir.  “It's none of my business.  But-”  He glanced up, catching their eyes.  “I'm good at keeping my mouth shut, and even better at minding my own business.  So, if you're pretending for my sake-”
Clint blinked at him.  “Is this because I told Pepper we were eloping?”
Tony didn’t even listen.  There wasn’t any point.
“If there wasn't coffee, I wouldn't have a job,” Clint said, making a shooing motion at Bruce with his apron.  Bruce headed for the sink, and Clint plated up an egg and a thick slab of bacon.  “Don't you fill my sink with that mud, Banner.”
He tried to ignore the feeling that he'd crossed a line at some point, and he didn't even know when it had happened.  But he was pretty sure there was no way back.
“Well, then, since that’s settled,” Steve said.  “Miss Potts, if you’ll let me know if you need me to do anything?”
"Wonderful.  I'm not married, who am I supposed to be married to this time?" Tony asked.  "I haven't even been on a second date for more than six months, so who-”
"There's no-" Ellen shoved her hand through her hair, and immediately regretted it.  "There's no winning!  We're not in this to 'win,' Jesse.  We're in this to tell the truth, and there's no winning or losing to that, there's only the hard facts and the reality of the situation, and we are obligated to report that accurately and impassively!"  On the other side of her cube wall, Al stood up, giving her a narrow eyed look over the top of his bifocals.  "I'm going!" she said.
Tony's head fell forward.  “Good press,” he said with her.  He pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers.    “Right.”
She nodded.  “They’re safe,” she said.  “And as soon as we can, we will.”  Her hand fell back to her side, and the armor fell with it, clattering back to the floor.  “I swear it.”
He was soaked now, his shirt was plastered to every inch of his body.  It was a torment and a tease, simultaneously hiding and calling attention to the breadth of his shoulders, the flex of his muscles, the hollow of his flat stomach.   He shifted, and his shorts, sodden and heavy, slipped down the angle of his hipbones.  Steve grabbed them with one hand, dragging them back up.
Darcy made a noise that was just the verbal equivalent of a wince.  “How’s that going?”
He was still in the coffee shop in the lobby when Pepper strode through the front door.  He drained the last of his espresso, sticking another twenty in the tip jar on his way to throw out the cup.  The barista behind the register stopped wiping down the counter long enough to give him a nod and a smile.  “Thanks, Mr. Stark,” she said, and he gave her an idle wave.
DJ nodded.  “Gave them the rest of the money they needed.”
“Really.” And that explained why Hammer and Happy hadn't needed an introduction. Steve wondered if it had been Pepper or Tony that had set it up, and what, exactly their offer had been.
Jan nodded.  “Right.”  She stood.  “Natasha?”
DJ shifted, his sneakers digging into the sand.  His head was tipped back, his hands gripping the straps of his backpack.  He glanced at Rogers, who gave him a nod and a slight smile.  “It’s going to be just fine, Deej.”  He looked up, the clean lines of his profile catching the light of the headlights. “Just…  Fly.”
Steve blinked at him.  "You're the chef?"
Steve grinned at him.  “Rice?”
Probably not.  HR didn't have much of a sense of humor about forms, either.
Pepper was silent for another moment.  "Is that a 'good fuck' or a 'bad fuck?'" she asked at last.  "And be aware that Marcy is staring at me as I'm forced to ask that question, Tony."
“Avoidance is probably not going to work, long run.”
Bruce took one look at Tony's face and immediately said, "He's fine.”
Tony tried to get up again, and Steve caught him.  “Stop,” he said, his voice sharp.  “For once in your life, can you not be like-”
Obie burst out laughing.  "It's true, I don't," he said.  He looked back at Tony.  "Remember, we decided that you were going to take in an orphan for a week?"
“What-” Steve started, but Tony’s mouth was on his, and this kiss was not cautious, was not tentative.  Tony just pulled Steve close and kissed him, and Steve felt the ground fall out from under his feet.
He tugged on his ear, making a face.  "He's...  Not here right now," he said, his head tipping to the side.  "But if he pops up during your visit, you'll know."
It didn’t come.
“Or Jarvis could do his damn job,” Tony shot back.  “Which seems like a much better idea to me, so-”
“I’ve formed the Council of Lesbians,” Carol said.  Natasha looked at her.  Looked at Steve.  “The Council of Lesbians and Steve.”
Harris braced the end of the broom handle on the floor.  “VIP lounge.”
The tendril snapped straight at him, and he released the light that he’d been holding, coiled tight against his palm, and it went off like a firework.  “As far away from here as I can get!” he yelled, and his hand latched onto the strap of his backpack.
“I’ll see what I can do,” she said, peering up the ladder.  “You know that’s for food storage, right?  That’s where we put apples.  And preserves.”
The young man stepped out into the shop.  He was slight of frame, but with broad, well-muscled shoulder beneath the thin fabric of his shirt, and not as tall as Steve was, but few people were, now.  He had dark hair and dark eyes, and when he smiled, there was an air of puckish humor around his mouth that made Steve smile back.  “Ah, you see, that is a problem,” he said, swinging around the end of the counter.  “Mr. Pym works small, and he works large.  I’m afraid you’ve caught him in a rather expensive mood.” He gave the watchmaker a fond, if exasperated, look.  “And as such, I find he’s not likely to be interested in anything smaller than a grandfather clock right now.”
“He's asleep on the other side of the ward,” Sam said, with a slight smile.  “I kicked him out when I got here, but he didn't get far.”
“I’m going to try anything and everything,” Steve said, and Tony went silent.  “Don’t worry.  You-” He gestured at the workshop at large.  “You’ve got what you need, you keep doing what you’re doing, and I’ll-”  He shook his head.  “I’ll do nothing.”
"We didn't 'lose' him," Tony said, stressing the word.  "We put him to bed last night, and woke up this morning to find he wasn't there."
“You have no way of proving that,” Carol pointed out, reaching for a plastic take out box.
Harris looked at Tony, who met his eyes and shrugged.  Harris sighed, not sure why he expected anything different.  Why would either of them have any idea what to do or say?  He smiled at DJ, who smiled back, faint and strained, but still a smile.  “It’s…  Okay not to be okay,” Harris offered.
“I’d encourage you to try, ‘cause I’m pretty sure even you would have trouble doing any lasting damage with a shirt box, but hey.” Sam stepped into Steve’s apartment, heading for the kitchen.  “You do you.”
“Good.  March,” she said, and he marched.  She watched him go, her arms crossed over her chest.
“Which doesn’t mean he knows anything about the kidnapping,” Steve said.  “Our best bet is finding Hammer.”
“I'm trying my best,” Steve said.  Tony didn't think about it, didn't even consider what he was doing, but suddenly, he was reaching for Steve's hand.  Steve's face went blank for a moment, confusion melting away into a warm smile.  His fingers wrapped around Tony's his grip warm and firm.
“Ours was Pepperony,” Pepper told Rhodey, who made a face.
Clint stared at him, his face unreadable.  "Oui," he said at last, and Natasha hid a smile behind one slim hand.  She kicked Clint in the ankle as she passed behind him.
“Hi, Shirley!” Clint said, and the other shoe dropped so hard that Phil could swear he felt the earth move. His head snapped up, and he found Clint staring at him, a pleasant smile on his face.  “It’s-  Yeah.”  He grinned.  “Yes, I know I’m in your phone, I just-”
“Good boy,” Steve said, just before a hand caught his arm.  He let Tony tug him into the alcove, the shadows closing around them in an instant.   Steve gave him a look.  “You, meanwhile…”
“Yes,” DJ said.
Obie nodded.  “When will he be going back?” he asked.
DJ nodded. “Promise?”
“And you still chose the worst of ‘em,” Bucky said, walking around Nomad, checking his tack with quick, efficient movements.  Finishing up with a glare, he moved on to Okoye’s.
A plastic tag on a string lanyard was dangled in front of him.  “We’re going to Maaagicon,” Darcy said, sing-songing her way through the word.  “And so are you.”
DJ squinted up at Tony, who stepped back, tucking his hands in his pockets.  Steve struggled to smile.  “Hi,” he whispered.  “Why aren’t you in bed?”
“I know you are,” she said.  “I know you are.  Tell Tony that he keeps using the word ‘dying’ and that’s not helping, it’s…  Women don’t like to hear ‘dying.’  Even if it’s prefaced by ‘not,’ we have this panic response to the word dying and Pepper does not like to panic, so...”
A blast of webbing shot over his shoulder, catching the mad science type in the chest and face.  Tony stared at him, nonplussed.  “Can he breathe through that?”
Steve smiled back.  “I bet it is.”
Tony didn't even look.  "Let's go, Williams, I don't have time for backtalk."
Steve nodded, stepping to one side of the road to let a cart rattle past, wooden crates bouncing with each rotation of the wheels.  “Leave the property disputes to the tenants, got it,” he said.  “And the shops?”
DJ nodded, but his face creased in a faint frown.  Tony leaned over.  “Diagnostic?”
“At this point, fighting with you’s going to result in something getting broken, and I’m not interested in being blamed for it,” Steve said.  His fingers brushed against the small of Tony’s back, tangling with the wet fabric of his shirt.  “Or given a bill.”
Clint rolled to his feet, folding the newspaper with a theatrical flick of his hand.  “Who’s got first watch?”
“Yeah, wait, what?” Harris said, as Clint slapped a “Property of Tony Stark” sticker on him.  Harris looked down at it.  “Hey!”
“You don’t even live here,” Johnny said, and ducked as his sister swiped at his head.  “What?  She doesn’t?”
“You can put ‘Santa’ on the tag all you want,” Clint said, scooting his chair back to the table.  Greer and Bruce moved theirs aside so he could huddle between them.  “I know that they’re from Tony.”
Jarvis frowned.  “Sir.  I'm deeply wounded by your distrust.”  Mrs. Parker came out on the patio, drying a massive glass jar with a towel as she walked, and he looked in her direction.  “Mrs. Parker, have we any coffee?”
“And occasionally, if we are truly lucky, we find someone with whom we can share our journey.  Another person who chooses, of their own free will, to walk alongside us, to merge our path with theirs.  For some of us, our ways will part again,when road leads on to road, when time or distance pull us apart.  For others, that shared road will lead on, and on.
“That's your first mistake,” Tony said, letting Pepper pull him towards the stairs that lead down to the kitchen.  He waited until Obie was out of earshot, then leaned towards her, pitching his voice low.  “When, exactly, did I agree to this?”
“Do not do that,” Steve said with a bright smile.  “You're not paying for your own ring, Tony, that's-”
“Need to get dad,” DJ finished for him.  He tapped Furbro on the nose, and Furbro nipped playfully at his fingertip.
His guard made a scoffing sound under his breath, shifting his weight so he could brace his back against the end of the pew.  “I live my life by simple rules, Stark.  Number one, don’t piss off Agent Romanov,” he said.
Tony reached out, gripping Bruce’s shoulder.  “Go get some sleep, Bruce.  I’ll see you in a few days.”
“I might.”  The tip of Tony’s pen left flecks of ink on the page as he tapped it in place, a nervous twitch of movement he wished he could control.  Instead, he tossed the pen aside and reached for his cup as Obie sank down into a chair opposite him.  It was the chair he’d come to think of as Steve’s, as foolish as that was, and Tony scowled down at the statements.
Another soft, pained moan.  "I think that was rocket fuel, actually."  Very carefully, Tony moved his head, just far enough to peek at Steve with one bloodshot eye.  "Where are we?"
“You’ve been time travelling again,” Clea said.  She was pacing across the ceiling, paging through the book in her hand.  “Good afternoon, DJ.”
“Oh, this is going to go so well,” Tony said.
“Yes,” DJ said with a great deal of enthusiasm.
Jarvis paused.  “Of course, sir.”
“He does this when he’s bored, it’s fine, we have rules, as long as he doesn’t do anything that’ll get me arrested for insider trading, whatever, it’s all systems and numbers and predicting patterns, and he’s very good at all of those things.  He can absorb a massive amount of information and use it to adjust his patterns.”  Tony opened one eye.  “Check the balance on December 1st.”
DJ nodded.  “He shouldn’t have come,” he said, and Tony felt, as much as saw, Rogers flinch.
The blonde watched him go, his arms crossed over his chest.  “He gets to pick the venue,” he said to Trip.
Tony nodded.  “You okay?”
Rogers' hand dropped back to his side, but his mouth was still twitching, his eyes dancing.  “Steve,” he said.
Steve stared down at him, torn between amusement and complete disbelief. Behind him, someone was laughing, and he didn't know if it was Rhodey or Tony. "You're something else, you know that?"
“He okay?”
Tony lifted his arm to wave them in, and winced as his ribs protested the movement.  He set his bowl aside, wrapping an arm around his middle.  “I thought you’d be asleep by now,” he said.  DJ tugged free of Peter, picking his way across the floor to lean against the side of the bed.  Tony reached out, his fingers brushing over DJ’s hair.  A tension that he hadn’t even been aware of bled out of him.
“We’d be better off in the stable, and the sooner you admit it, the better we’ll be,” Bucky said, tossing the pot on the table.  It rocked on its uneven feet, and Shuri stuck out a foot, bracing it in place.  He didn’t seem to notice as he grabbed the ladle.  “Less holes in the roof, I’d bet.”
The video started with a rattle of static and the sound of someone saying, “-Probably isn’t a good idea, maybe-”
“To hell with this,” he said, and   Steve spun, throwing the shield with quick, sharp precision.  It hit the attacker in the chest, lifting him straight off of his feet and sending him rolling across the pier.
She was studying the shots on the camera's display. “I'm trying to find a bad angle for you.” Her mouth went tight. “I'm starting to think it's impossible.”
“I can’t believe we missed the brawl,” Carol said.  “The brawl.”
Tony unfastened the neck of his undersuit, and whatever he had been trying to say turned to dust in Steve’s mouth.  “I know I have a reputation, but I can only strip so fast, Cap,” Tony said, and Steve knew those words were going to haunt him for a very long time.
“Just trying to figure out why she's not waiting til we get home.”  He picked up the call with a flick of his thumb. “Did you miss me this much, or are you just bored?”
“Another thing you ought to be be used to,” Pepper said.  She moved another ledger onto the top of her stack. “Obie, I seem to be missing the latter half of 1930.”
“No,” Okoye said as she passed, her back ramrod straight, her shoulders squared.  Her horse looked neither left or right as she passed, just as uninterested in the rest of the world as her rider was.
DJ gave the photographer a suspicious look.  “No,” he said, and Steve flinched.
DJ shook his head again.  “Never replied.  After that first pledge.  Never talked to him.”  He twisted the lid of his water bottle, not quite breaking the seal.  “Seemed wrong.  So I didn’t.  But I-” He shifted, and the cap snapped free.  “I was thinking about it.  A lot.  When this happened.  About him.  About-”  He looked up.  “About you.”
There had damn well better be mail for the kid.
Jarvis gave him a look, his eyebrows arching, and Tony slapped a smile on his face.  “It’s good,” he said.
“In the armor?” Steve asked him, looking up from his ring.  “Why?”
Natasha emerged from the door next to the pantry, a large, golden brown loaf of bread in one hand and a covered basket in the other, her black skirts rustling around her slim legs.  "Miss Potts thought he might have some insights into our young guest's movements," she said.  Her eyes slipped towards Steve, the green of her irises glinting beneath the sweep of her lashes.  "He's been very useful.  So he is to be fed."  There was a faint accent to the words that Steve couldn't quite identify, not French or German, or anything else he'd encountered in Europe.  But familiar, none the less.
If he was being honest with himself, which never ended well, he regretted a whole hell of a lot more than that.
Tony grabbed DJ's head between his palms and leaned forward, pressing a loud kiss to the top of DJ's head.  “You,” he said, “are ungrounded.”
Stark crossed his arms over his chest, not seeming to notice how that wrinkled his pristine silk shirt.  “You like engines?” he asked.
“You did,” she said, drawing the words out.  “And I should be hitting you for that, as well.”
“I was.”  Tony crossed to the bath, trailing his fingers through the bathwater.  “He wanted May, and let me tell you, she was quite smug about that.”  He gave Steve a look.  “My story reading is, apparently, subpar.”
DJ hopped up, bracing his arms on the edge of the table.  “Yes,” he said.  He poked a bottle of detergent with one finger.  His eyes slid sideways towards Clint.  “Need money.”
“No.” He couldn't listen to this, or he would lose his mind. He forced a smile on his face, light and easy. “Steve. Don't be-” He exhaled. “Don't be ridiculous.” He crossed his arms over his chest, and then uncrossed them, forcing them back to his sides. “You've been the perfect husband.”
“You don't have to,” Tony said, dropping his napkin over his plate.  “I got the-”
“So do you,” Pepper pointed out.
“This results in a very peculiar problem,” Jarvis said.  “Where the child hears, so often, and so conclusively, that people would only choose to be near them, would only choose to associate with them, because there is a financial benefit to that association.  Though few would admit it, I do not doubt that most come to believe it.”
“Oh, my, I did,” she said.  “I did say that.”
“No, I have the most amazing idea for a deconstructed mimosa,” Tony said, and Steve buried his face in Tony’s shoulder, laughing out loud.  Grinning at the ceiling, Tony stroked his hair, letting his fingers linger there, loving the familiar pressure of Steve’s body against his.  “Want to know what’s in it?”
Jess arched an eyebrow.  “We used to date.”
Steve turned his face, pressing a kiss to Tony’s palm.  “Holidays are hard,” he admitted.  “But yes.  I’m okay.  I’ve got you.  I’ve got Dummy.  I’ve got the, well, for lack of a better term, the family.”
“Leaving one,” Ellen said, a little awed by that.
Steve looked up, surprise floating through him.  “What?”
He straightened up.  “As ready as I’m going to be,” he said, and offered Tony his hand.  Tony took it, and together, they headed for the chapel doors.
“We shall see, will we not?”  She paused, the blade of her knife tucked just beneath the skin of an apple.  Steve followed her gaze, his eyes narrowing as he spotted the riders coming over the horizon.  Without thinking, his hand went to his back, muscle memory taking over.  But his fingers closed on nothing but air, and he bit back a curse.
Steve looked at the tray.  He reached out, lifting the cloche to peek at the plate underneath and releasing a fragrant cloud of warm air, heavily scented with bacon and warm syrup.  “You’re awful bossy, anyone ever tell you that?”
“It only locks from the inside,” Tony said.  “If you think it’s important, that’s just, that’s just a sacrifice you’ll have to make, I suppose.”
“If by ‘something’ you mean, ‘go to my own restaurant and start prepping for dinner because I have a full reservation list and two big holes in the culinary line up of this street,’ then I approve,” Pepper said.  Tony opened his mouth.  Before he could say a single word, Pepper took his milkshake.  “Tony?  If you don’t show up to work, then I’m not going to show up for work, and who exactly do you think is going to be answering your phone, which is already ringing off the hook?”
