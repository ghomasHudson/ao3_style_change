“This will look beautiful when fully healed.” He whispers. “Do you know what your brother has written onto you, Sherlock? In bold black letters.” Sherlock shakes his head. Spit flies. John comes around and puts two gloved fingers beneath his wet chin. “God, look at you.” But Sherlock can't see his reflection anymore, it's obscured by John’s, his body superimposing Sherlock's, morphing them together. A strange sense of vertigo makes Sherlock briefly close his eyes. What is happening to him?
Sherlock fixes him with a cold gaze. “This was something personal. You don't just cut someone's penis off and stuff it into a child's mouth to choke on it. Revenge? Jealousy? Perhaps a former victim of Saint Clair's predilections?” He starts pacing, only slightly wincing as the plug up his arse shifts. Colour rises in his cheeks and John has to look down to hide a lewd grin.
John moves quickly and has the element of surprise on his side. He doesn't look left or right, just presses the muzzle of his gun against the temple of the man holding the dog in place and yells: “Get it away from him.”
Mycroft swallows. Sherlock can see that he's caught him on the wrong foot. “No, you wouldn't.” Mycroft drones.
But now, as he enters 221b, his thoughts return to John. who'd wanted to do some shopping earlier... Sherlock is rather excited what John might have got him.
Sherlock rests his face in a puddle of his own spit, crouching next to the bed, experiencing John's come drying on his face. He's deep into subspace, just a hole to be used and filled as John pleases. John's taste fills his mouth. Everything else is pushed aside, lingering just at the boundaries of his perception.
“Oh, you want to be wide open and gaping, I see.” John grins as he reaches over for the speculum sitting on the bedside cabinet, gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the window. Sherlock remembers their first session and shudders. Luckily, this time the device slides in much more easy. Thank god John has finally used some lube.
Sherlock is special. He belongs to him and Mycroft, and is not a toy to be shared. Sherlock trusts them. Only them. He'd been a virgin a few weeks back, for god's sake! It might have been a fantasy, being fucked by random strangers, but not like this. Not as an asset to international politics. This is just degrading, a violation. Rape. And John won't be part of it. He likes to play games all right, but this is something else. This is evil.
Mycroft loves the little needy noises his brother makes as he’s getting stuffed with cock. Fisting his hand into dark curls, he pulls Sherlock's head back into a messy kiss, all tongue and teeth. John watches, savouring the sight of the two brothers above him sharing fierce, open mouthed kisses; until Mycroft lets go of Sherlock to shuffle up behind his brother.
When Hoody is finished, it's Chequered's turn. His cock is thick but short, resulting in him hitting Sherlock's prostate again and again with every thrust. Sherlock can feel himself getting hard, dripping pre-come onto the linoleum.
“You look absolutely fuckable, Sherlock.” John whispers, leaning in close, before pressing an open-mouthed kiss to Sherlock's jaw. “I've been thinking about this all day. You, in these tarty things...”
Sherlock doesn't want to, he really doesn't, but what can he do? He is a comedump after all, so this is what he's here for. He swallows and swallows until he gags and tries to lower the bowl to catch his breath, but John's firm hands hold it in place and force him to continue.
Just when Sherlock thinks that he can't take it anymore, John orders him to turn around. The bedding is superior quality, very soft, but his back got so badly abused that it still hurts to have to lie on it. Nevertheless, John continues his ministrations at Sherlock's front, this time concentrating on his sensitive nipples and soft belly, deliberately avoiding his groin.
“As I said, some special friends.” Mycroft sits down behind the writing desk, placing his folded hands on the table top.
Mycroft just sighs resignedly before scraping the residue from Sherlock's thighs and groin with the table spoon to put it back into Sherlock's gaping mouth.
“Don't you dare to come without my permission.” John tells him while rubbing the pad of his thumb over the leaking slit.
Sherlock can barely walk. He feels almost split in half. His achingly hard cock bobs with every tentative step, shiny and glistening. The throbbing pain in his nipples has become a hot, constant burn. His lips are bitten raw and his hair is damp with sweat. He must already look a debauched mess.
Sally grins. “You know, junkies have no limits when it comes to hiding their stash? I'll probably have to put my fingers into all his orifices.” She winks as Sherlock pales. “God, I seriously have to piss.” She shakes out her dress when John nudges Sherlock off the table.
Eventually, Sherlock has no tears left to shed. When John tells him to get up on his knees, he does, too weak to put up any resistance despite his trembling legs. John first removes the towel from his mouth before presenting the bloody brush to Sherlock, who knows what is expected of him.
Nothing. John tries to call him and ask if there's any new development, but the call goes directly to voicemail. Which is not unheard of, since the reception at Bart's is kind of patchy. After leaving a message, John just shrugs, puts his phone away and walks over to the desk Sergeant, to sign in and look for Lestrade.
Slowly, Sherlock lowers his arms and glares up at the face looming above him. “Molly...”, he coughs, but Moriarty just shakes his head, smiling a dark smile.
“Mycroft always hated the Mediterranean. He prefers the Nordic type.” Sherlock mumbles into the sheets.
Sherlock is about to utter a sharp reply when the door opens again and a tall dark-haired woman walks into the room. It's quite an entrance: her hair is done up in an elaborate fashion, her make-up is flawless and she's wearing a creamy white pencil dress combined with dark stockings and black high-heels. She looks stunning and totally in charge.
But then I realised that everyone in my car was fine and it was our other men who had been caught in the landmine, not us. Immediately I was moving, commanding others to do the same aswell.
" He snarled, gesturing his hand between John and Sherlock. He started making his way over to John, the small amount of calmness that had been there moments before completely disregarded. Mr Watson was absolutely pissed.
That night he became more than my colleague, more than my friend. He became my first love. We would die for each other.
At 18:37pm on the 6th of June, John Watson passes away as Sherlock holds him, supporting him as he takes his final few breaths. He is not in pain. Not anymore.
Once they had finished, John fell on top of Sherlock, their skin sticky with sweat and held his face in his hands, just looking, not saying anything. Their breathing was heavy and their hearts were pumping erratically and the room smelt heavily of sweat and sex.
His moan was filthy as he released himself into my body, gasping out my name. I squeezed my legs around him, pulling him down so his body was resting on top of my own. My fingers made my way to his head and I scrunched my fingers into his hair, smiling as I adjusted him so his forehead was pressing against mine, our breaths mingling in the air between us.
Blinking with weary, John's eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hospital room before turning his attention to Sherlock who was looking at him with a tremendous amount of concern.
Weeks go by. They receive cards and condolences, hugs and tears. The teddy bear still sits on the middle pillow. It’s 04:03am and finally,
John only nods. They’d discussed it, of course, but neither thought they’d reach that stage so soon. “Her bed or our bed tonight?” John asks, meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
Mrs Watson was in the doorway aswell, her eyes wide open with a mixture of fright and nerves. She looked to John and then to Sherlock who had scrambled under the covers by that point, and grimaced. This was not good.
“I don’t know. I was waiting until you got here before asking anyone anything.” She looks around nervously before making eye contact with Sherlock. John is unaware of the questioning look in her eyes, the question of
I am released three weeks later. Mycroft and Lestrade are with me when I leave, both silent as we make our way out of the hospital. There is a car waiting for us and suddenly I am panicking and even the thought of getting into another one is scaring me. My breaths are coming out in short, sharp bursts and I am hyperventilating.
My head hurts a lot. It's always aching, a constant throbbing that never seems to go away. I am told that it is due to my head trauma, that it will take time. I haven't got the patience to wait.
Just then, a doctor comes into his room. She goes by the name of Dr Nina Pace and she has a friendly face. I do not greet her.
"Oh, Sherlock. How lovely to see you." She planted a kiss on his cheek and then faced John again, whispering, "why is he here this late?"
"Is Dad home?" John asked as he released Sherlock's hand, nodding at him slightly as he did so. His mum replied immediately, a small smile plastered on her face.
"I'm fine, Sherlock." I know he's not. Anyone could realise that. "It's just, you know, the headaches."
"I really am sorry-" John began, but before he could finish, Sherlock turned his head, capturing John's lips with his own.
Sherlock scoffed. “Vulnerable. Please do spare me the pity.” Sherlock made to turn but Mycroft managed to stand in his way, blocking the entrance back into the hospital. He stood closer so he was face to face with Sherlock but the few centimetres he had on his brother made him seem all the more intimidating.
"Jesus. He really said that?" He is not trying to disguise his shock at what I have just told him and then, as if he is afraid of what I might say, he speaks again, voice muttered as he lets the words come out. "You're not going to leave him." It is more of a statement than a question but there is still a hint of uncertainty with his words.
It was that day that John decided he wanted his father to die. It was that day that he started to be on the receiving end of his aggressive outbursts and violent tendencies.
"John, you need to be rational about this. We can wait one more year. We will both be over eighteen, out of school - we can get our own place and then we can tell him. I don't want you to get hurt if you tell him too soon." Swiftly, Sherlock took John's shaky hands in his own and rubbed soothing circles into the palm.
"John." Sherlock's voice came out as more of a whisper, relief evident by the way he spoke John's name.
"I'm being serious, Sherlock. You don't have to stay." I cannot help but flinch when he says the words. He really believes he is going to be a problem to me. "I wouldn't expect anyone to stay."
"I'm ready." John stuttered, his voice filled with need. Sherlock's eyes widened as he looked up at John, opening his lips in a timid 'o' shape.
“Thank God,” John said as soon as the curtain was closed and he heard the footsteps going further away. “I don’t think I could handle being in the ICU any longer. This family has been in today and they decided to bring a kid who wouldn’t fucking stop asking questions.” John sighed and pressed his head back in to the pillow.
John could feel pressure being applied to his abdominal area and a whole new wave of pain attacked him, momentarily rendering him unconscious. All too soon though, he was awake and there was a face above him, strong hands supporting his head. "John. Stay with me. Try and focus on me."
Suddenly she was falling, tumbling. The crack of her head hitting the wall was undeniable as she fell, step after step after step. John’s legs gave way beneath him as his mother eventually reached the last few steps, taking him down with him, and then they were both laying in a heap at the foot of the stairs, blood pooling around from where his mum’s head had collided with a plug socket on the lower wall.
"John will probably not have any bladder or bowel control. Nor does it seem likely that he will regain sexual functioning." I allow my eyes to flutter shut for just a second. Why should John have to suffer through something this truly horrendous? Suddenly there is a hand touching my shoulder and when I open my eyes Lestrade is standing above me.
I'm 38 years old when I lose him, my husband. He doesn't leave the world spectacularly, dramatically. He doesn't leave how I know he would have wanted to go, on a case or with me.
last week because she was drunk. And you keep letting her go out! And she’s out again tonight!” Mrs Watson clenched her jaw.
I wish I can hug him, bundle him up in my arms and tell him that he will recover fully. I wish I can tell him that everything will be okay and that he doesn't have to worry about anything. I wish I can protect him, but I can't, and that is what pains me more than anything.
"I love him. Of course I would do that for him." I replied, sniffing as the emotions overwhelmed me yet again.
“I used to come here a lot as a child,” Sherlock says, gazing at the leaves above them, basking in the warmth of the sun. John thinks he looks beautiful. “Exploring was something I always enjoyed- even managed to drag Mycroft along with me one time.” Sherlock chuckled and shook his head. “That was a long time ago.”
And just like that everything changed. Suddenly there were machines beeping and Mycroft and Lestrade were being ushered outside of the room. “We need some space,” the nurse said. “This is urgent.”
John lays awake on the sofa, listening as Sherlock plays Rosie’s lullaby over and over and over again on the violin. He’s been playing for hours, insisting that he’s fine. Occasionally the violin will screech, and John knows that Sherlock’s thinking too much again, becoming distracted from the notes he is playing. That great brain of his, lost. Confused.
The young man smokes his final cigarette at the lake, watching as the smoke returns back to the sky once again. John didn't like him smoking. He walks back along the wooden beams, flickering the lighter one last time before discarding it at the water's edge.
The detective looked at his landlady and he was graced with a sudden rush of empathy. He was aware of how fond of Mrs Hudson John was, and, additionally, how much Mrs Hudson cared for John like he was her own son. However, before Mrs Hudson had the opportunity to respond, there was a knock to the door and she was up, wiping the tears from her face as she made her way over to the door.
"Sherlock Holmes." The box felt heavy in his hands as he opened it, presenting the simple yet gorgeous golden band that resided in there. "Would you do me the honour of becoming my husband?"
"I'm here." He seems to relax at that and I continue the repetitive movements over and over again. His breathing even outs, eventually.
In an instant John felt Sherlock beside him, cupping his hands to the wound on his mother’s head. There was silence as the three of them stared at the woman on the ground, the woman lying in John’s lap as she bled. John knew that she was dead.
No matter how much I like to believe I am a high functioning sociopath, I do not think I can tell him this by myself without becoming emotional. I tell Dr Pace that I would prefer it if she told him.
“Daddy’s crazy, Papa.” Rosie says to John, and a grin plasters her face as she looks at her parents. John looks between his daughter and his husband, eyes settling on Sherlock for a fraction of a second longer. They share a look before John responds.
“Oh, we’ve been having coffees together for ages. I guess some point over that period of time it just became a bit more. Very slow burn, you know.”
The door’s opened by another tall brunette, she’s just as young and elegantly dressed as Anthea but there’s something slightly more approachable about her, perhaps it’s her open smile or the fact she welcomes him by use of his first name rather than title, but whatever it is about her she makes him feel slightly less out of sorts. Her smile is genial as she takes his coat, Anthea’s drifted off somewhere down the corridor to the right and John’s hoping that means he wasn’t supposed to follow her,
I hope you will forgive me for what I am about to do John, there is a great deal for you to forgive me for is there not but I hope that this will not be that one step to far. You have killed for me John, the very first case we undertook as partners you did not hesitate to save my life at the cost of another’s.  I never truly thanked you for that. For believing I was worth that. I hope I get the chance to tell you in person.
“Nah, I’ll be alright for a minute. I’ve missed our hugs today, far too much excitement for cuddles with Daddy, though I can’t blame her. She’s like her father, always wanting to get into everything,” John said.
Sherlock hushes him the moment the cab pulls away from the curb and they spend the twenty minute journey in silence and staring, which John would normally find irritating but tonight he finds highly enjoyable as he is drunk enough to indulge his impulse to stare lovingly into Sherlock’s eyes without the normal accompaniment of his brain’s constant panicked reminder that Sherlock may reject him at any moment and that his infatuation was leaving himself open to possible mockery.
‘I just fail to understand what is taking that girl so long, is it too much to ask that one of your staff perform a task in a timely manner, by the heavens I swear I should just have collected them myself. Just like with the care of poor Gregory, I am glad you saw reason and allowed me to care for him, lord knows what would have befallen him if you had entrusted him to one of your girls.’
“I missed it though John, I missed Sherlock and he’s dead. How can you be so certain I wouldn’t miss Mina, that I wouldn’t lose her somewhere in a crowd.”
‘There’s a child here, she’s well, she’s under our care for the time being, but you see, she’s well,' Mycroft was thoroughly confused now, all this drama over a child,'her DNA says she is Sherlock’s, Sherlock’s child,' and now it was Mycroft's turn to hear white noise. The Detective Inspector was still talking, explaining something about multiple test and eyes and Mycroft realized the entire situation was ridiculous, his brother was not a father, 'we don’t know the mother and can’t find her, but this little girl Mycroft she’s right here. Look please, I know you've probably got loads of questions and I know you most likely don’t even believe me but right now I need you, need you to come down here and talk to me.' His head was still spinning slightly, it felt like some of the walls in his mind were dissolving, 'I need to you look at these results and I need for you and John to tell me what happens next.’
‘Mycroft’ Gregory’s voice was soft, more of an exhale which coasted across his lips gently, he parted them in response, he wanted to say something, explain his actions in some acceptable way, but he failed to think of anything before the man before him moved closer.
Once the laughter’s died down they’re left with ridiculous grins, the atmosphere is slightly more relaxed and John allows himself to sink back slightly into the sofa, it is ridiculously comfortable and no matter how much emotional upheaval they’ve been exposed too over the past several hours he is still a little drunk. Not too much mind, but enough that he’s able to feel properly comfortable in the presence of two men he finds intimidating for the most part.
‘Doctor Watson, I trust you found the gardens a pleasing diversion?’ John returned his proffered smile with a short nod before turning to his Mother, ‘Doctor Watson, may I introduce my mother, the Lady Violet Holmes, I see you have already met my Father.’  His mother came forwards her hand gently touching his arm before extending her hand to John,
Some of you may have noticed the chapter's been separated again, this entire section is a complete beast.  But the completed chapter would have been 8000 words and even for me that's a bit much.  So the next chapter is done and being proof read. It will be up tomorrow evening. MJ X
‘Wow Greg that’s huge, if a little sudden.’ John wanted to cheer, but he thought such a reaction to the dissolution of a marriage might be “a bit not good”. Sherlock would have scoffed at the very notion of John celebrating Greg’s freedom but he wouldn’t have fooled John. The man would have been smiling to himself. Neither of them had cared for the woman on the two occasions they’d had a forced interactions.
‘John I thought you might sit and have a drink with me before my parents descend on us, they’re eager to meet you obviously.’ He turns now to the woman, ‘Thank you Holly, would you instruct my mother we will be ready to dine in forty five minutes’ she inclines her head slightly before whisking out of the room, ‘What can I get you John?’  Mycroft moves towards a wooden cabinet leaning against the solid wall to John’s left, the right hand wall is made out of French windows, two open doors lead to an impressive yellow stone veranda,
John tried to arrange his mouth in some semblance of a smile, he may be a poor man’s version of a consulting detective but he could deduce the relationship between the Holmes men in an instant, he may lack Sherlock’s distinct curls but the hawkish structure of the face was similar. Having made a fool of his entrance he attempted to find some form of decorum and his efforts were reassured through the man’s relaxed posture, age and the fact he seemed to be finding a certain level of humour in John’s inelegant half sprawled entrance. In the hopes of putting himself on a positive footing with Siger Holmes, he straightened his posture and clasped his, slightly shaking, hands behind his back. He moved to consider the blooms on the centre arrangement. They held tiny white petals surrounding an extended orange centre, the smelt strongly of vanilla but with an underlying spice John couldn't identify.
Then there’s the question of Sherlock’s parents, John’s racked his mind to find any mention of them he can, as he doesn’t have a mind palace his efforts have been relatively fruitless, he remembers Sherlock mentioning their existence post case once but he would never provide details, he only garnered their names when a flower arrangement had arrived at 221b with a note asking Mrs Hudson to ensure they arrived at the house, he’s not proud of the fact he read the card they placed on the arrangement for Sherlock, he doesn’t think he would have wanted anyone reading one if he’d written it but there you are,  it had been a simple cream card with black cursive script,
‘It surely qualifies you for a great deal John, but alas on this occasion I will be forced to turn down your kind offer.’
“That would be helpful, yes.” All three of them looked for the nearest security team member they could find. Someone must have noticed because a minute later Mina was strapped in; John’s scarf still in hand as her grip bordered on super human sometimes. Mrs Hudson walked in front of them with the pushchair and two agents on either side, each of them carrying half her rather extensive shopping.
It’s dark and as empty as Mycroft promised, he goes to bed that night more peacefully than he deserves and when he dreams, he dreams of a deep baritone, soft skin and the pressure of soft lips against his own.
‘I know and I would never want her to be, she’s going to be her own person, wonderfully special and individual just as her father was but she can’t be him. He was one of a kind and so is she. I’m excited to learn who she is. I miss Sherlock but I wouldn’t try to replace him, it would be insulting to him and to her.’
‘We all do Mother but be assured everything that can be done is she will never be without support.’ She does not look convinced, something that is clearly not lost on any of the men present.
They stand in the kitchen, John juggling Mina and directing on which cupboards belong to each food group. Opening the one which always belonged to cans and the good biscuits John hid from Sherlock’s post case sugar binges Lisa pulls down glass beakers, Bunsen burners and gleaming Petri dishes.
John can feel his blood pounding through his body; the combination of adrenaline and fear making him push his body past the wall he’d hit minutes ago.  He has to push through though, people are relying on him. People are dying and he can’t reach them. God, they’re so far away! He keeps running, his feet giving out under him but he recovers quickly, using the force of his push off the ground to get him moving again. The weight of his pack across his back is making it hard for him to breath. He’s not getting enough oxygen, in this heat he could pass out easily, he knows he needs water but they’re in the middle of nowhere and water’s just become one of their most valuable possessions.  There’s blood everywhere. John falls on his knees before a solider he doesn’t recognise, they’d been paired with another brigade today and he doesn’t know all of them. He finds a pulse but it’s faint and the man is barely breathing. The body armour is thick and kept the bullet from penetrating the man’s chest but when John rolls him on his side he notices the spreading red across his shoulder. He’s still running on adrenaline, his own breathing slightly laboured as he pulls the medic pack from his back.
“Ah but to Moriarty he was and for that he deserved to be punished. We should all atone for our sins, Mycroft. Sherlock’s atonement was fitting really. His heart made him dull and so his heart proved to be the incentive; three bullets for three people, all dead unless Sherlock jumped. But not just any people. Oh no. Moriarty knew what Sherlock would die for. He would die for love. All heroes do.The three people Sherlock loved most. All of them would die. Unless he jumped. Three bullets, three killers and one way to stop them. He had no choice. He’s our tragic hero, you see?”
It was Christmas when he arrived, sitting gracefully in a woven basket lined with Holmes tartan. I remember my mother being furious and my father being silently accepting as I poured affection over my wonderful Red Setter puppy. He was everything to me John, I would sneak him into the school room with me and devote myself to teaching him tricks for hours on end.
‘Have you been eaves dropping Mrs Hudson, awfully inconsiderate of you’ Mrs Hudson raises a single eyebrow at him, she was a highly affectionate woman with those she deemed worthy but she was also a gossip. He had been trying for years to maintain a mask of indifference when it came to conversations concerning Gregory Lestrade but he had to admit it had become more of a struggle as of late.  It was true that the D.I’s marriage was an unhappy one, the man said so himself but the truth remained that Lestrade had been saying so for years, they had shared slightly drunken phone conversations on the numerous occasions he had discovered his wife had once again been unfaithful and yet he never left her. The one occasion Mycroft had taken the liberty to suggest it as a course of action the older man seemed to panic leaving their dinner an hour earlier than usual. He had never taken the liberty again but instead sat as friend and listened to the tails of Denise Lestrade’s betrayal.
He paused when Mina whimpered against him, cutting himself off mid rant. While stroking her back again he tried to sooth himself as well. It was easy to lose himself in confessions but Greg didn’t need any of this. He’d been in the middle of raid mere days ago, he had lost friends, and here John was complaining about his family. God he was ungrateful. Just like his mother always said.
Mina snuffled slightly in her sleep, burrowing closer to John until her face was obscured entirely from view; she still slept best when she fell asleep like this. Something about the closeness seemed to sooth that part of her John knew still worried he would disappear and she would be left alone again. He saw it every time he collected her from a stay at Mrs Hudson’s and felt it every time she clung to his jumper or hand when they went to the kid’s club at the White Rabbit. She was growing steadily more confident around others, in particular other children; she hadn’t hesitated before reclaiming a snatched toy from a boy at least six months her senior. Granted, John would have preferred she do so without smacking the child on the head with said toy in retaliation and her chanting “no” repeatedly, but progress was always something to be celebrated.
‘You should really call me Greg when we’re in a bar Danny but to answer your question I can be, but never as much as her. Sally is a winning machine,’ the young man blushes in response to his answer. ‘I’m going to nip out for a cigarette, come get me if she starts a fight will you’ he points to where Sally is starting to trash talk the head of recruitment, he’d rather not get on the man’s bad side again,  the other positive to Sam’s is the covered smoking area, he pulls himself deeper into his coat as he lights up, the smoke is hazy as he exhales, he’s alone again and the road surrounding them is quieter than you’d expect for the middle of London, he thinks back to the dream he’d had the night before, when he’d woken he’d wondered if he should feel guilt for having a sex dream about someone that wasn’t his wife, they shared a bed but in reality they were estranged, he’d stopped wearing his wedding ring months earlier and it was only for convenience they hadn’t gotten divorced, neither of them finding the time to file and sign the papers, he didn’t really speak to her anymore. Perhaps the time had come to be more proactive in their separation, maybe that was what the dream meant, the literal translation of wanting to find himself in bed with a certain politician was certainly true but it was the deeper feeling in the dream which made him believe the time had come to move on, and therefore out, of his marriage.
“I asked if you ever feel as if you’re living in a dream.”  Greg asked, not unkindly, John didn’t think Greg could do anything unkindly, not truly. It’s potentially why Sherlock had sometimes grown frustrated with him.
Greg grunts in response, his eyes having already closed and he felt the slow drift of exhaustion wash over his consciousness. Falling asleep fully dressed and above the cover was hardly ideal but Greg couldn’t be more ready for this entire week to be over and done with.
He had attended the funeral although he had not been certain he would be welcome and it was then that he had seen the full extent of John's loss. Greg had known he was looking at a broken man; wrapped in a dark suit, head fallen forwards and dark circles making his eyes appear both swollen and sunken. Greg remembered he had never cried, at least not at the funeral, he'd just kept his head down and clung to Mrs. Hudson's hand while the rest of the congregation surrounded them. Greg watched from the sidelines as the boys' Landlady, and John's surrogate mother, had tried to comfort him.
Mycroft passed back the image of the three men for John’s attention. He studied them closely, focusing on the broadest man in the image.
‘Well at this moment the decisions would revolve around childcare I suppose, but soon you will need to decide on schools and my parents may have suggestions for you with regard to that. Let me stress that you are under no obligation to follow their advice, but they are who they are and education is something they both remain passionate about.’ Mycroft returns his focus to his niece who he has balanced on his knee while he took the seat opposite John, she has fascinating facial features, he can see the similarities between the child and Sherlock but the faint differences as well as her youth have given her face a softer look, when she smiles her cheek bones are more pronounced but they form more rosy dimples than Sherlock’s severe version.
‘Tammy what on earth are you doing?’ John could see her legs from the calf to her foot sticking out of a large pile of outfits, her legs shimmied as the exited the heap brandishing what looked to be a stuffed horses head on a stick.
‘Like we’d dare miss story day, what’s on the rota for tomorrow?’  He’d started taking Mina to White Rabbit’s story morning two weeks ago, she had little patience for sitting through a full story being told by someone other than John but it was giving her a chance to socialise in a small group and get a little better at being around strangers. Not only that but it gave John a regular reason to leave the house and attempt to build a network of acquaintances with children. Tammy had a tendency to dress up as a character from the story being read for the day, last week she’d been dressed as Robin Hood for the day, John had started to believe story day was simply an excuse for Tammy to dress up but he wouldn’t judge her for her small pleasures.
‘Osborn report’ the call comes through on his own radio but he can already see that Osborn won’t be answering it, she’s lying on the floor hands clutching her side, her face rapidly paling as her crimson blood covers the floor, a man is standing over her, the silver gleam of his knife covered in blood,
Danny seems shocked, his mouth hangs open slightly and Greg translates the stunned look into surprise at his abruptness and decides to let the young man catch up before saying anything else.
‘I don’t know how much she’d learn but it’s definitely cool’ he looks back to Tammy to find her smiling broadly.
Did you imagine me John? Me on my knees begging for your cock? Pleading for it in my mouth, in my arse, hammering my prostate till I screamed, begging you to never stop, is that what you dreamed of John? I could have done that for you. I would have. I would have worshipped you John. Every inch of your body would have been my scripture and I would have devoted myself to it. To you.
‘It’s ok baby girl,’ he lifts her into his arms so she can cling to his jumper, this has become their routine, he lifts her out and sits rocking on the wooden chair Mrs Hudson had insisted he buy, on the occasions she shakes when he holds her he drapes the royal blue throw over their bodies, she calms eventually, always with her face pressed into his neck and her hands gripping tightly to the weave of whatever jumper or top he’s wearing.  He rocks back and forth murmuring soothing sounds and reassurances for as long as she needs.
“That’s not true, I owe you my heart and it’s yours if you want it.” Mycroft turned in Greg’s arms, pressing their foreheads together.
‘You’re not hijacking if you’re invited, Greg. Did you honestly give her the papers?’ John asked. He’d listened to Greg hem and haw around the topic of divorce through at least three separations in the last year. He’d honestly given up hope of his mate dragging himself out of his hell pit of a marriage.
‘Well there are three I can remember off hand; all the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.’ Tammy laughs lightly at this one, ‘You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting,’ That one made him think of Sherlock, he’d started staring in John’s dreams again but he was no longer the bloodied face on the pavement, now he shone brighter than he had in life, they ran through the streets of London, bounding over roof tops, laughing at crime scenes. The last quote however was his favourite,
‘We best save John then, preferably before she provides him with enough escargot and bouillabaisse to have him smelling of garlic for a month.’  It was more the use of such a serious tone that led to Mycroft’s own bark of amusement in response to his Fathers statement.
‘No I’m not, but I will be busy,’ she seems even more puzzled by his declaration and when he accompanies it a few seconds later by handing her a manila folder  she clasps it gently,  ‘Open it’ .
‘Nonsense, even you could not heal all the damage the years before you caused.He was so lost John and you found him.’
She was a sight to behold amongst the ladies of Society, as she still liked to call them; she shone brightly with her French wit and the accent she pulled out for special occasions. It would never do for those same said women to know she had long ago adapted to living in the Yorkshire countryside with the adoption of a more genial British enunciation. The family still opened the Manor grounds once a year to hold to local village summer fete, his mother had taken to running a stall for the local children to decorate macaroons, unable to resist her little piece of French heritage.
‘JOHN!’ a large crash accompanied Tammy’s greeting, the noise came from a story above where John knew the woman kept the extra stock and her assortment of grown up fancy dress options, the disorder the space was infested with had done a number on his self control the first time he’d helped her move stock so he’d avoided returning for his own stress levels. A second crash had him handing his wide eyed daughter across to Mrs Hudson and climbing the spiral stair case;
‘What precisely has your mother organised for dinner this evening, I fear I have been paying very little attention Mycroft.’  His father was right to be worried, food was one of the few sources of disquiet in his parents’ marriage and his father had simple tastes, preferring dinners to consist of a maximum of three courses and nothing too astoundingly rich being involved, his mother on the other hand, well she liked indulgence, the fact she had Sherlock’s physique and metabolism was a key reason she failed to recognise his or his fathers consternation at the sheer number of calories she could fit into one course.
His beautiful wife who for the first two years of their relationship agreed to maintain the tradition but for the third, the year Greg made Detective and the year she started having her affairs, that year she decided enough was enough. She refused to make the hour’s journey to his family home and when Greg informed her he would be going anyway, Denise had laughed in his face. She’d known it wasn’t true. Greg didn’t trust to leave her alone for longer than an hour, his mind constantly turning back to the mental image of her gym instructor pressed between her thighs and her writhing beneath him in turn. So he hadn’t gone; he’d blamed his absence on Denise’s sudden illness but something about his tone seemed to inform his mother of the deception in his excuse. She didn’t question him though; she never would.
‘Have at it Mycroft, there are some new photographs too that I was meaning to send you, the first ones in the gallery?’ He sees Mycroft’s grin broaden when he finds them. The shots show Mina dressed in the Guinevere outfit Tammy put together, she does look awfully cute. John had wondered at buying her some dresses, she seemed quite taken with them and he didn’t want her to miss out just because he lacked any knowledge in the area, thank god for Tammy.
John was bought back to reality by a hand on his shoulder, warm even through his jacket and the solid weight of Mina against his chest grounded him even more. Coming back could sometimes feel like waking up, sometimes it was like being dragged through glass but more often it was like this, like being clear again after wading through fog. Coming up to breath after losing control of how deep you’d sunk.
‘We’re on silent approach sir, air support is showing little movement on the surrounding roads but we’re keeping the helicopter high to avoid detection. I’ll radio when we’re in position, Devin out.’
‘I have always imagined sex was something he did high, the only mentions of it he ever made were in reference to tripping on some form of substance and certainly the only boyfriend any of us ever became aware of was a scoundrel called Victor. He was arrested on numerous occasions with large amounts of cocaine in his possession. The first time Sherlock overdosed Victor was the one to leave him propped against the doors of the local A & E department. I saw it later over the hospitals surveillance. He dragged him out of the back of a car and, after leaving him against the building, the man threw a shirt over my brother's chest. It was January, to say it proved to be an inappropriate amount of coverage would be an overstating of the state of this shirt.’
Nothing about them would appear to be significant would it John. The deductions I've made would make this couple appear mundane. As if they were characters in one of the day time programs you and Mrs Hudson favour during your periods of unemployment.
Also Universities in the UK have just broken up for Easter break so i'm hopeful for more updates than normal over the next three weeks. Wish me luck, MJ X
Siger saw his son leave but made no move to stop him, his sons were some of the finest brains in United Kingdom but he would be damned if either of them had ever been able to handle displays of emotion. He noticed John moving to stand by the window behind them, awarding him and his wife as much privacy as the room would allow.
He must drop off again because he suddenly becomes aware of Sally shaking his leg lightly, there’s a doctor standing to the side of them closest to the door. Greg notes that both the guards are back in place, the doctor starts talking about the surgery, how the wound had run too deep and P.C. Osborn had lost too much blood; he’s apologising and saying they did everything they could. Saying he’s sorry for their loss and Greg wants to scream, scream that she was too young, scream that it wasn’t fair, scream at them to keep trying , but all he can do is stare. Sammy’s dead, she’s gone and suddenly Greg can’t seem to get enough air. Everyone’s crying again, Hannah is clinging to Peter, her hands wrapped in his shirt. He’s pulling Sally to him too, he can see her body shaking, knows she must be sobbing but all he can hear is white noise. His knees give out from under him and he hits the plastic chair hard on his way down. Two strong arms fit under his arms and he’s lifted back to standing, he feels himself shake but the arms only grip harder,
‘It will be easier to show you but for that we will need to be upstairs,’ the door behind them creaked open ‘Good afternoon Mrs Hudson’
"I woke you," and as if an afterthought, "again." The man in my arms chuckles softly before grimacing.
His eyes are fluttering open and closed and I can tell he is trying his absolute best to do what is being said- it's the only part he's listening to though.
“I thought you’d be home and you wasn’t. Dad’s usually up by now and he wasn’t in the kitchen, so I went to his room and I found him.” He feels the colour drain from his face. “He wasn’t moving, John. I tried to wake him but I couldn’t.” She bursts into tears. “There was an empty pill bottle beside his bed. I phoned the ambulance and they’ve taken him. We need to get to the hospital now.”
Lestrade is the first person I see when I wake up. He looks absolutely drained-as if he hasn't seen sleep in a lifetime. "You've been out for a couple of weeks." He says groggily. "They didn't know whether you'd make it or not."
“Mycroft, Molly and Lestrade are in the waiting room.” Sherlock said whilst tapping the tips of his fingers to the tips of John’s. He avoided mentioning that they were with him due to the events of last night. “I already know that you’re too tired to want to see any of them, which is why I’m still here and they haven’t been in, because I wanted to see you for longer.”
The afternoon came around quickly and soon enough Sherlock and Mrs Hudson had left Baker Street and were back at the hospital. John was awake this time as they arrived, but it was evident to Sherlock that he was fighting sleep. Stubborn as ever though, John wouldn’t give in.
John clenched his fist. She was in no way the person to tell him whether he should go to therapy or not when she was the one who couldn’t even bring herself once to go to rehab.
It was ridiculous to hold out hope for him because how could someone survive something like that? His body was crushed by that car, he should have died on impact. Yet he didn't and he managed to live for another three days.
“Oh for God’s sake. What does it take for some cooperation around this place? Keep everything from Sherlock, why don’t you? I’m a genius but I can’t read minds. You know information about John that I don’t. Why won’t you tell me?”
"Get some sleep. I'm not taking no for an answer. I'll come back tomorrow and take you to the hospital."
“John, leave him alone! He’s your Dad!” It’s Harry. Immediately John lets go and there are nurses surrounding the bed tending to his dad. Sherlock drags him away from the scene and into the corridor, not before he sees Harry looking at him, her face a picture of shock and anger.
Sherlock shifts so Mycroft has space to crouch down beside him. A hand is on his shoulder and there’s a voice in his ear and he doesn’t want to hear what comes out of his brother’s mouth next because it means that everything is over, and John will be gone and he will have nothing. “Sherlock, you need to let him go.” He shakes his head. “Sherlock, John is gone.”
"Wake up James. Wake the fuck up, come on for fuck's sake! Wake up!" I screamed, over and over again, my fists scrunched tightly into his uniform. The smell of the cindered flesh hit my nostrils again and I realised that it was his flesh, his body that had been burned. I lurched to the side of him and threw up, over and over again. Someone put their hand on my shoulder and started tugging me backwards, ordering me to go over to the helicopter that I hadn't even acknowledged had arrived.
"Will he-" My voice breaks before I can finish my sentence. I inhale deeply, repeating those words again. "Will he ever regain movement in his legs again?"
His head is in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and the scent of smoke and something that is so undeniably Sherlock fills his senses. John presses his nose in closer and inhales, just as Sherlock’s hand caresses the back of his head and pulls him nearer. They stay like that in silence for what could be no longer than a minute but it’s all John needs. All John needs to know that everything will be ok and even if it isn’t, he’ll have Sherlock by his side.
"Sherlock and you. You're dating one another." Mrs Watson gave her son a friendly smile as she pulled him into a hug, stroking his hair as they let the news sink in.
I need to say goodbye to him and finally I am able to do so. Just the two of us again, as it should be.
Morning came around slowly and Sherlock woke with a start, his head pounding. He’d been thinking too much, constantly fretting about whether John was going to be ok or not. It must have only been an hour since he’d finally succumbed to sleep and even then, it was uncomfortable.
Lowering my hand, I carefully clasped John's swollen hand in my own, delicately caressing his tender skin with my thumb. I lifted his hand, pressing a gentle kiss onto each individual fingertip as a reassurance, a promise.
Before John could speak any further, Sherlock had taken John's length in his hand and was slowly stroking at it, smearing the precome at the tip with the top of his thumb. "Jesus Christ, Sherlock." He continued this for a couple more minutes, teasing, leaving John in a shivering mess. "Seriously, Sherlock..." he took a sharp intake of breath, "...I need you."
“How long ago did you have a drink?” His voice takes on an air of seriousness and John feels another pang of guilt, the second time this evening. It’s not fair on Sherlock.
Mycroft lowered his voice, low enough so it was only Sherlock who could hear him, and enunciated every word slowly. “Stop this. Now. Just stop it.” He paused. “How many times do I have to tell you?”
Not at all like you. But I saw how much he meant to you, how your face would light up at the mere mention of his name. Love, I always thought, was a confusing subject. All of the passion that two people can build together creates this incredible cacophony of desire and destruction, screaming at you all the time whilst you maintain your relationship. Yet, you elect to ignore those screams, choosing to follow through with your heart rather than your head, right up until the end. You cared for John, Sherlock, and it has only made the pain and the grief worse for you."
Sherlock’s hand cups John’s jaw before travelling downwards, gently grazing against the scar on his chest, before reaching his hips. Down further. John inhales and presses his face into Sherlock’s shoulder, before laying back against the bed, mouth open, utterly content.
I don't realise how long we've been in the car but soon I don't know where John is. A paramedic is standing above me, placing an oxygen mask over my mouth and nose. I am somehow being manoeuvred onto what I can only assume is a spinal board, my neck being supported with a brace.
“Why-“ John breathes and wraps his arms around Sherlock, letting out a sob. “Why the fuck does he think he can do that after everything he’s done?”
John ran his hand over his head, stroking his fingers through his hair but only to pull it back and find clumps of blonde resting in his palm. A couple of strands drifted to his feet as he retracted his hand, cascading gracefully to the ground. The medical student stared at his hand, not quite willing to register what exactly had happened.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s hand makes its way into John’s and he holds it, feeling his pulse thrum through his veins, a little beat against Sherlock’s fingertips. For a moment all that can be heard is the rustle of leaves as they blow across the opening and then, occasionally, silence as the breeze diminishes. John turns his head to the side and watches the way the sun catches on Sherlock, changing chestnut into auburn. Sherlock’s breathing has returned to a steady pace and John cannot help but see how content he is, looking up to the sky and just
Before they found out that he had died, our classmates made him cards, wishing him the best of luck in his recovery. Our teacher gave me the cards to give to him.
As he pulled out of Sherlock, John noticed that he was in fact still very hard, his cock throbbing and wet with precome. In an instant, John had bobbed his head down, nestling his face into Sherlock's thick pubic hair and began to suck, swirling his tongue around the tip of his cock. Sherlock came with a shout, his hands bunching into fists in the duvet.
John was sobbing loudly, interrupting the silence of the surrounding forest. Sherlock held him close, embracing him in a tight hug and gently carding his fingers through John's soft blonde hair.
say that again, John. Just because your father isn't accepting does not mean that you should not be accepting of yourself. You are extraordinary and you should never have to apologise for that. I've said it before and I will say it again, you can tell your father if and when you want to. If he doesn't approve, well, that just proves what a useless, coward of a man he is. I know this is
She begins speaking but her voice is quiet. Instead of going straight into the diagnosis, she offers me a glass of water or a cup of tea. I do not want that. I want to know how John is doing.
but he manages to, and the first thing he sees is the sky. It's dark. Darker than he's ever seen it before. There isn't enough time for this to register though, because now there's a face in his line of vision, and there's blood on it.
“You didn’t even last three days!” Lestrade exclaimed as he found Sherlock on his doorstep a few days later asking him for a case.
“I don’t know.” A loose curl falls over Sherlock’s face as he nods his head in response to John’s answer and he kneels down beside John so they are level with one another.
All Lestrade can hear now is Sherlock’s heavy breathing, occasionally interrupted by a sharp intake of breath as he weeps.
"Which is why I want to do this now, rather than later." John coughed, tapping Sherlock on the bum to get him to move from him completely. Once Sherlock had moved, scooting to the furthest cushion of the sofa, John untangled himself from the blanket and reached his hand into his pocket.
“They were all morons. Besides, I’m fine now. Since rehab didn’t work Mycroft has upped the surveillance on me. Won’t be getting in to any trouble any time soon.”
"His parents." I manage, my mouth dry. My voice cracks slightly and I turn my head away, willing her not to see me. She doesn't say anything, just puts her hand on my shoulder and guides me to the room where they are sat together on a sofa, faces red and blotchy from where they have been crying. They both look up to me when I walk in the room and immediately Mrs Watson's eyes fill with tears again and she is standing up, wrapping her arms around me in an embrace that leads me to believe that I am about to be suffocated.
She peers at me, waiting to see if I have any questions for her but I do not. I allow her to continue. "The neurological examiners will test the motor nerves, which includes muscle tone and muscles weakness, as well as sensory nerves and reflexes. Through testing John's reflexes we will be able to determine how his bladder and bowel movement have been affected. Usually this worries patients the most which is why I am telling you this.
"They're acting like nothing's fucking happened. How could they do that?" The boy in front of me took a swig of the alcohol, grimacing as the liquid travelled down his throat. There was an anger to his voice that I had not heard before. "They treated her like utter shit when she was here and-"
Mycroft exhales, repeating his sentence again. "When you began your acquaintanceship with John Watson, I did not believe it would be at all beneficial to you, Sherlock."
When I was five years old I had to watch my mother die of cancer. It was awful and confusing but I was only little and just did not understand what was going on. So I carried on, going through everyday with my Dad and sister. It was normal and I survived.
"Peters! Attend to Rheon and get Walters and Dawson to help with Doors and Grimes! Get fucking moving!"
Sherlock returns and the gentle notes of the violin are replaced with Sherlock’s equally as attractive voice.  “Glass?” Sherlock asks, though he knows the answer. John doesn’t know why Sherlock asks but he never questions this out loud. Maybe it’s just because Sherlock needs the confirmation, or maybe it’s because he wants John to acknowledge what has actually happened. He can’t be sure but he doesn’t want to ask.
When I find myself in hospital, machines connected to me to keep me alive, I'm not scared. I'm not afraid. I've overdosed, sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally, but I've managed to survive through it. I've got used to the idea of having my stomach pumped. And it's ridiculous because the only time I get to escape my reality, is when I risk my life.
“If you’ll excuse us please, Gregory. We shall just be a moment.” With one last shove from Mycroft, Sherlock was out the door. They too remained silent until they were outside in the smoking area.
She pulled away and smiled, only slightly, but it was a smile nonetheless. “Well, best not leave Sherlock in there too long by himself. Goodnight, Greg.” And with that, he left.
In the end it wasn’t Sherlock who cried though. Before he could even respond to John, he heard the quiet sob, saw the tear on the corner of his eye fall. John squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head before speaking again. “For fuck’s sake, Sherlock.”
They made quick effort of discarding each other’s clothes until it was nothing but them, wrapped up in the sheets in Sherlock’s bedroom. Breathing heavily, panting, moaning.
“Where is it, where is it, where is it?” His voice spreads through the flat and suddenly John is in front of him, hands grabbing wrists, stopping Sherlock from dropping the skull to the ground. He takes Billy from Sherlock and places it back on the mantelpiece. “I’ve lost it John. I’ve lost it. I
I kiss the top of his head, not focussing on the fact that he no longer has any hair. Around an hour later, John has fallen asleep and I carry him back to bed, carefully resting his head against our pillows. He doesn't wake up until 14:00pm the next afternoon.
I don't know how long I was sitting with him, closing him in against my chest. I don't know when it was that I let go of him, one final time. But I did, eventually. Reluctantly.
Sherlock was on the phone, explaining the situation to the paramedics. “Sherlock,” John says, the fright in his voice evident. His voice quivers and Sherlock knows that he’s trying to be strong, for Rosie’s sake, but he’s seen too many people die and doesn’t know if he can handle seeing another person die, let alone his daughter. “She’s asking where you are.”
"Sherlock?" He asked, nudging Sherlock's elbow. Sherlock shifted from his position in John's lap and sat up, looking with concern at John. "Don't worry, I'm fine." John reassured, patting Sherlock on the thigh before setting down the glass on a coaster on the table.
The detective side stepped before slamming his forearm against Mycroft’s chest and shoving him into the concrete of the hospital wall. “John is in that operating theatre. I intend to be there when he wakes up.” And with that he stalked back into the hospital, back to the waiting room, leaving Mycroft behind.
and then he realises where he is, recognises the grey walls that have mould growing in every corner, recognises the tattered mattress that he has called his bed for a considerable number of days. There is vomit on his shirt and blood on his arms and he remembers it all.
“Don’t you have more important things to be getting on with? Running the government? Telling Lestrade what to do?”
of bones breaking. A jaw, a skull, a nose. His actions are futile, for the man sprawled out on the pavement is already dead. There is not a brain left in his head.
and he doesn’t want to accept the fact that he’ll never be able to return to where he belongs, to the family he’s been with for 18 years. Life is never going to be as he knows it again and he doesn’t know whether he can cope with that.
It happened quickly. Sherlock felt the pain before he realised what had happened. Blood was gushing from his nose and he was on the floor, momentarily unaware due to the force of the blow that had knocked him down.
Sherlock clenched his jaw. He had avoided thinking about that at all costs if he could, because John
“Oh for god’s sake. Not me. Your husband. You have a chain around your neck- wedding ring is on it. He didn’t die recently, no, you haven’t got a tan line on your finger from when you took it off but you keep it with you at all times. You were angry. Night after night he’d be going to dens, high as a kite. Until one day it was too much and he was found dead… Your marriage was failing anyway. Yet you still have the ring.”
"My boyfriend who I could ravish right this instant." The laptop made a beeping sound as Sherlock sent off an e-mail, before he swiveled on his chair to peer at John.
But no matter how hard I try he doesn't move, doesn't open his eyes and tells me that he loves me again. He doesn't hold me as I wake up screaming about another nightmare because it isn't a nightmare, not this time.
John was silent for a while, taking in everything I had said. Eventually he spoke, his voice quiet and muffled. "I'm so grateful that I have you, do you know that Sherlock?" He seemed to already know my answer as I felt him snuggle closer to me and press his lips to my clavicle.
“Don’t make me bring Mycroft in here. I can and I will. Now, listen to me. You are not staying here, not in this state. Understand?”
"Don't." It is a warning. We remain in silence for around five minutes before Lestrade dares address the situation again.
John remained silent as he witnessed his remaining hair fall from his head. Never once did he say a word.
"Sherlock..." The young man hears his name being spoken softly, by a man who he had not expected to see in this location. His feet begin to move, carefully treading along the grass until he reaches the bank, and perches down next to Sherlock who still has the cigarette butt clenched between his thumb and finger.
It wasn't supposed to happen. Something like that isn't supposed to happen to anyone, but it did. It was an accident but the amount of hatred I feel towards the person who caused this incident is overwhelming. I want to hurt them. Make them feel guilty for it. Let them know exactly how horrendous this incident is. Inflict the same agonising torture on them as what they've caused to us.
"Hey, Sherlock? Am I hurting you?" Sherlock shook his head, eyes snapping together to try and stem the flow of tears. "What's wrong?"
“You’ll have a side room, a bit of privacy. We’ll have the porters come shortly to take you.” Dr Holden held out his hand again to the three of them and left.
They stepped through the front door and into the hallway, their hands still tangled together, trapped between their bodies. The lights were off except for the dim orange glow at the top of the landing, enhancing the boys' reflections in the large window that overlooked the staircase.
Sherlock spoke to him, his John, in a room full of nameless faces. They didn't matter. None of it mattered anymore. John was no longer in their world. Why would anything matter?
Turning on our sides we faced each other, our hands still intertwined between us. "Get some rest, John." I said quietly, my voice barely above a whisper. John looked at me and shook his head slightly.
Dr Pace tells Sherlock that John is booked in for a neurological examination. Sherlock's finding it hard to control his emotions.
"I. Mum. Sherlock and I... we...mmm... we're..." He knew what he had to say, the words just wouldn't come out!
“What do you think you are doing?” Sherlock turns and his legs give way. Mycroft is by his side in an instant and helping him back on to the bed. “Why did you lie? I thought you were getting better. We all thought you were getting better, brother.”
“You have made me the happiest I have been in weeks,” John’s voice breaks slightly on the final syllables. Sherlock has been the constant in John’s life since his mother died and for that, John couldn’t be more appreciative.  It was impossible to say when Harry would be at home and when she was she was usually reluctant to speak to either him or his father. And John’s dad. Well, if those two weren’t caught in a shouting match John would be trying his absolute best to ignore him.
The funeral was held on the following Sunday in their local church. His coffin was made of a beautiful oak and on top of it was a simple golden plaque with his name engraved into it. Nothing over the top or fancy- he wouldn't have liked that. Not at all.
Pursing her lips, Mrs Hudson shrugged her shoulders. “You’ll know what to do, Sherlock. And when the time comes he’ll have a good support network around him. This won’t be like the last time.”
John is meant to be in that hospital room surviving, not by himself in a cold mortuary waiting for a post mortem to take place to determine how he died because it sure as hell isn't going to do anything to bring him back from the bloody dead.
Sherlock crossed his legs and listened as Patricia recited what she had probably said a hundred times before.
John did not have the chance to drive. But the person who murdered him did and he took advantage of that, thinking it was a fantastic idea to drive whilst under the influence. He was walking to my house and out of nowhere, the vehicle had veered onto the pavement, colliding with him and sending him flying. The impact had shattered various vertebrae in his spine, caused major internal bleeding and extremely severe head damage. It was unlikely that he was going to wake from the coma that he had succumbed to, but we hoped that he would.
Sherlock wiped a hand under his nose and it came back with blood. He was injured but that was unimportant. John was the only person that mattered.
The streetlight flickers back on. Sherlock sits up, avoiding the needles that are littered on the concrete beside him and glances around the room shaking his head.
“Fair point.” He plucked a cigarette from its casing and held it to his lips as Sherlock lit it with his lighter, before doing the same himself. Leaning back against the bench Sherlock took a drag of the cigarette before exhaling, the smoke forming grey halos around their heads. John followed.
“If you need me for anything just call for me,” she smiles amicably and it takes everything John has in him to force a smile in return.
“Do you want me to call him?” Lestrade asks, gripping Sherlock’s arm tightly. He gets no response, but he decides to call Mycroft anyway. He stands up on legs that he feels won’t support him, and steps away from Sherlock. Behind him, he hears Sherlock shuffling back over to John.
“Sherlock, listen to me.” John cups Sherlock’s face in his hands, presses his forehead to his husband’s. Sherlock holds on to John’s wrists, closing his eyes. “We’ll get through this, ok?”
I can't stop hearing that sound. The sound of him hitting the road. It interrupts me when I'm attempting to sleep. It's always
Sherlock looks at the bed now, looks at the pillow in the middle, the little dent where their daughter had slept. Her teddy bear rests on the pillow, its head drooping slightly, the threads keeping it together beginning to fray. They both refuse to move it back into her room.
Sherlock wrapped his legs around John's waist, his heels digging in to the muscles of his back as John lined himself up with Sherlock. Their hands managed to find each other's again, fingers intertwining, locking onto each other.
“It was a slight miscalculation on my part, though I can assure you that I am fine.” Sherlock sunk back into the bed and sighed. He knew what was coming next.
John recollects the blistering heat of the Afghan sun, and he hears the deafening blasts of the exploding field around him.
"He's dying." Sherlock says, panic that he has never heard of before making itself evident by the way he speaks.
That was such a long day but I remember it so vividly. John wasn't awake when I went to see him. They have him in a medically induced coma to prevent further injury from happening. Just as well really, because I had another episode in the ICU room. I wouldn't have wanted him to see me like that. He looked so fragile amongst all of the wires and machines and tubes and blankets. His face was incredibly swollen and if it hadn't have been for my knowledge of knowing that it was in fact John, I would not have recognised him. I couldn't help the choke that escaped my throat when I saw him.
And I've found that I'm past caring. There may come a day when I finally accept what happened to him, when I stop doing things that are not only damaging me but hurting the ones around me but I don't see the hope. I lost hope when I lost him.
“You think I don’t know that?” Sherlock snarled. “I thought I was just craving cocaine for absolutely no reason. And shaking because I was cold.”
One moment he's running. The next, he's on the cold ground of London. Then, he's back in Afghanistan.
“He took that well,” John points out as he stands up, dragging Sherlock up with him. He straightens Sherlock’s shirt with his hand and smiles. “Better than how my dad would have reacted.”
“John, you need to carry on going to therapy!” Harry slurred. She had turned up at his house later that evening drunk. “It will help you!”
“You can take my bed tonight.” John said as he held the door for Sherlock to walk by him, before turning around and shutting it. He dropped his keys back into his pocket and faced Sherlock again. “Mum’s already set up the inflatable bed. You had it last time so I thought I’d have it this time.”
John nodded but remained close to Sherlock, inhaling his scent, absorbing the aroma that was purely Sherlock. Warmth, love, cigarette smoke.
The detective returned the smile, his gaze lingering on my lips before he dipped his head forward, trailing his lips over my neck, across my jaw, anywhere he could reach.
“For fuck’s sake.” Sherlock mutters. John swallows. He knows that Sherlock’s not coping and having Mycroft with them will only make matters worse. They make it downstairs, where they see Mrs Hudson at the door with a tissue in her hand, talking to Mycroft.
How was it possible that he was so content as we drifted away into our dreams together only to not be able to tell me his dreams when he woke up?
I am able to glance downwards, just slightly, but when I do I wish I hadn't. His legs are twisted at angles and through the blood that is coating his trousers I am able to see bone jutting out of the flesh of his right leg. My eyes dart upwards, landing on his torso.
“Rosie, I’m here. I’m here.” Sherlock hands over the phone to John, who shuffles slightly so that Rosie can lay in Sherlock’s lap. Like with John, Rosie burrows her head into the crook of Sherlock’s arm, curling herself inwards. Sherlock is rocking her on his knees, having found that this is the best way to try and calm her down. She clings tightly to Sherlock, refusing to let go even when the paramedics come.
One day I have to undergo an emergency operation. They hadn't detected the bleeding on my brain. Mycroft sues the hospital and has multiple doctors and nurses fired.
Rosie wakes up screaming, the agony becoming unbearable. Most of the day had been spent sleeping. In fact, most of the past two days had been Rosie sleeping and being sick. Her Papa and Daddy are by her side in an instant, trying to soothe her, to calm her down. She burrows her head into the crook of John’s arm, cries and screams disrupting the silence of the night. She’s only six, doesn’t know how to cope with the pain. Her doctors had told Sherlock and John to start preparing. They could take her home (and she had been home for just over four days) but if they had any concerns to phone for an ambulance immediately.
"Why would you say that? I'm perfectly okay if my baby boy is happy with who he is dating. And whether that's with a girl or a boy, I don't give a shit. Sherlock is a lovely lad and I'm so proud of you." For a few seconds, the worried feeling about telling his Dad had vanished and for the first time in a long while, John didn't feel afraid. He felt he could cope at whatever was thrown at him. It didn't matter what his Dad thought- his Mum was supportive and he had fallen in love with Sherlock. John didn't need his father to tell him he was wrong because he wasn't. He was happy. The sting of tears pulled John from his thoughts and he gave an impish smile to his mother. Before he could say anything more though, his Mum spoke up. "Now, you've got a handsome man sitting upstairs in your bedroom and your Dad is not home. What are you still doing down here?" She asked, mischief in her voice.
the two of them can sleep, fingers intertwined in the darkness, knowing that whatever is to come, they’ll still have each other.
The ambulance arrives within a few minutes and John is cleaned up. They put a couple of stitches in his head, not too many, and Sherlock stays by his side the whole time. Once the paramedics have left they go up to Sherlock’s bedroom, thankful that they don’t need to explain to Sherlock’s parents why an ambulance has turned up at their house, since they are away for the evening. John contemplates this for a moment. Even if they were here, he’s sure they would understand. Sherlock’s parents always have been the caring type.
Dr Pace is sitting silently, listening to my rant. A part of me knows that she doesn't deserve my abuse thrown at her and that what I am doing to her is completely unfair. She is looking after John and helping him and I am extremely grateful for that. But I am not calm and she is the only person I can talk to. My mouth is moving before my brain functions properly.
"She would have been so proud of you." John pressed his eyes together, an attempt to stop the tears from spilling over again.
Mycroft answers on the first ring. Lestrade doesn’t get the chance to say anything, for Mycroft has already begun speaking. “I’m well aware of what has happened, Detective Inspector.”
I went M.I.A. When the bullet ripped through my left shoulder, meshing together my skin, muscle and bone, I didn't believe anyone would find me. I still don't understand how they found me, laying in the dirt as I bled out. The sun was absolutely scorching- you would think that my main focus would be the pain, the absolute agony, but it wasn't. It was the Afghanistan heat, the overwhelming, treacherous heat that for some reason I welcomed as I was dying out.
"I'm sorry." John says, throat dry, barely audible. I manoeuvre the two of us so that I am the one sitting with my back against the wall and he is between my legs, his back slouched against my chest.
Sherlock manoeuvred the hand that wasn’t holding onto John’s and rested it behind his head, stroking his thumb gently backwards and forwards over his greying hair. John nudged his head back into Sherlock’s palm whilst inhaling, letting the oxygen from his cannula course through into his lungs. They remained in companionable silence for a couple of minutes, Sherlock soothing John as he calmed down, never once breaking his hold of John’s hand.
Sherlock looped his fingers with John's and slowly dragged him down so he was perching on Sherlock's lap with his back tucked closely to Sherlock's chest. They sat with one another in silence for precisely two minutes before Sherlock spoke up.
“I honestly don’t know how I missed it. Mistake on my part. It’s the first time he’s been on drugs since he’s met John- or so I’m aware. He’s been trying to figure out this case for months. Maybe the stress got to him. All I know is that it wasn’t safe for him to be in that hospital whilst he was like that and Mycroft agrees- he could have done anything. He’s always been unpredictable whilst influenced. At least here I’ll know he’ll be calm and
Outside, a streetlight flickers on. The darkening sky watches as the two men fly together, just them against the rest of the world.
We are taken into a room with comfortable sofas lining the walls. I sit down next to Lestrade, who keeps a little distance from me. I can tell that the news is going to be terrible, purely from the expression that the doctor is giving me.
The seconds ticked by, neither Sherlock or John moving an inch. It was John who made the first move.
Sherlock reflects back on the night of the proposal, remembers the sheer amount of joy he felt at something, just
An alarm is ringing out from another car (it could be this car but I am unsure), a constant whir, reminding me that this situation is in fact terrifyingly real and this isn't just an horrendous nightmare. The metallic taste of blood is present in my mouth, and it's disgusting, but I can't put any thought into that because John is probably going to die and I cannot move to help him.
“Nightmares. Flashbacks. Have you experienced any?” She began scribbling notes down as she waited for John to answer.
There is another family in the corridor, staring at us, looks of sympathy and pity plastering their faces. John's father is embracing Mrs Watson, quietly whispering words of comfort but I am able to tell in an instant that he doesn't believe what he is saying. His bottom lip is quivering and we make eye contact and I know, I just
John pressed forward, balling his fists into the fabric of Sherlock's shirt as he locked their lips together. The other man had his hands resting against John's hips, rubbing them up and down John's thighs, touching him wherever he could. "John," he managed to mumble between kisses, breathing heavily as the man on top of him began to unbutton his shirt. "John, stop."
He silently cried beneath me, his whole body shuddering as he released sob upon sob upon sob. "I'm being so fucking pathetic." John muttered, pounding his fist into the mattress. I knew that he struggled with expressing himself, that he always tried to put on a brave face for his mother.
Mycroft stands and holds his hand out to his brother, in a way that is so unlike Mycroft Holmes that Lestrade cannot help but stare. He wants to cry. Sherlock looks up and his face is covered in blood from where he’s been holding John close to him, there’s still bone in his hair, his hands are bruising and skin is broken from where he attacked John’s murderer.
It’s a Saturday morning, exactly 23 days since Mum died. Every day that John wakes up the realisation that his mother will never see him again hits him like a punch to the stomach and he wants to throw up, wants to scream at the top of his lungs.  The pain is a constant unrelenting attack on his body and it makes him feel weak. He knows it shouldn’t- grief is something that he knows is overwhelming and agonising and horrible but he just
“Something about the impact of the bullet- I don’t know, Sherlock. Just wait until the doctor comes out to speak.”
"Shit." John bounded up quickly, accidentally kneeing Sherlock in the private area as he did so, and practically leapt at the clothes that were bundled in a heap on the floor, scrambling to put them on. He had only managed to pull his jeans on when his father came smashing through the door, his face red hot with fury. The man paused upon entry, taking in the sight of the naked form on the bed and his son on the floor, shirtless.
"I'd rather look ridiculous than have a cold head." John giggled, adjusting his cannula as he continued to look at Sherlock.
“Anger is clouding your judgement John.” Sherlock says as they make their way down to the pond located at the front of the hospital, a plain feature that doesn’t do anything to distract families from the fact that their relatives are dying inside the building behind them, or the fact that their parents and brothers and sisters are ill and injured.
"Really, Mum?" Blushing, John's cheeks turned a violent shade of red and he squeezed his eyes shut. Well, that was awkward. He turned the packet round in his hand, noting the flavour. Strawberry. Again... how bloody embarrassing.
They remain quiet for possibly only minutes but for Lestrade, it seems like a lifetime. Sherlock is the one who speaks up first.
how weak he feels. Harry is mourning too and John should be there for her but he isn’t. Throughout his entire life he has tried to prioritise Harry over anyone, during the nights she’d lie awake in the hospital after another drunken evening, John would be the one by her side. When she and Clara separated John was Harry’s shoulder to cry on. Now, in the time that Harry needs him most, John can’t bring himself to see her. He can barely bring himself to stay in the house, let alone be with his family. John clears his throat.
“She’s a teenager, what do you bloody expect?” His fingers pressed harder against Mrs Watson’s shoulder as she again attempted to turn around.
"That's your call, sir." I open my eyes that I do not realise have been closed and look at her, suddenly lacking in any motivation to fight back. She is not an idiot. She has dealt with things like this before and even though I try extremely hard to attack my emotions, hide them, it does not always work and my mask slides.
is going on here, John?" He glared at John who had shifted backwards now, jumper forgotten, and was sitting on the edge of the bed with his hand resting on top of Sherlock's foot that was under the duvet. He inhaled, preparing himself for the up and coming conversation.
John nods his head and hands his phone back to Sherlock and they walk back to Sherlock’s house in silence.
“Hello, Mrs Hudson.” John smiled, albeit feebly, but it was a smile nonetheless. He then smiled at Sherlock. “Hey.”
I held him as he started to cry, pulling him in close so he was pressed against my chest. The sound of glass shattering interrupted his cries as he let it crash to the floor. The feeling of a light pressure was felt on my back as John wrapped his arms around me, his left (uninjured) hand gripping tightly into my black shirt.
They manage to resuscitate him. Early the next morning Sherlock pulls through and wakes to find himself alone, not that he is bothered by it at all. He assesses himself and determines immediately that he is well enough to leave. Swinging his legs round, albeit with much difficulty, Sherlock manages to stand on shaky legs, not quite registering that it probably would have been best to disconnect himself from all of the machines before trying to get away from them.
He opens his mouth to say something and more blood dribbles out, painting his lips crimson. I wipe at it with my thumb, ever so gently.
“Drink this, darling.” John says, handing her the glass of water as Rosie falls into a sitting position in between her parents. Her eyes are streaming and there are dregs of vomit on her chin, and it’s taking everything within her to not fall asleep. It’s 04:03am, and all three of them have been in the bathroom for almost an hour. Rosie finishes drinking and flops into Sherlock’s lap, utterly exhausted. Sherlock wipes her chin with the back of his hand. Before they know it, Rosie is asleep and it’s now just the two of them.
Because if he was here, this would have been better. I would have the determination to get through it because I would have had something to live for. Now everything seems dull and there doesn't seem to be any hope of anything getting better at all. I want John and I can't have him and it hurts so fucking much.
Taking a cab back to the flat, I find Lestrade already waiting outside. Upon my arrival he opens the door to the police car and pulls himself out, slamming it shut behind him. "What's wrong? Has something happened? Is John alright?" He is jittery, bouncing around as I walk closer to him. I notice a coffee stain on his shirt, presumably from just after he received the text from me. He has been waiting to hear from me.
When Lestrade tells me the extent of my injuries, I cannot be bothered to care. When he tells me that I received severe head injuries and that I needed life saving surgery, I don't react. When he tells me that my spinal cord was severed in the accident and that I shattered several vertebrae, I don't reply.
“Brother,” he says in a way that Lestrade has never heard from the elder Holmes: it’s sympathetic and subdued. “Little brother.” And when his little brother doesn’t look up, Mycroft says his name. “Sherlock.”
Just then Sherlock’s bedroom door opens and in comes Mycroft, suited up as always with a smug grin on his face. He takes a moment to assess the room before noticing that his brother is sitting just that bit closer to John than usual and
"She looked genuinely happy, John. And that's because of you. And if that wasn't enough, she then told me that she was grateful that she had such a caring son who would look after her. She told me that she was proud of you."
“I saw him, Harry. That night when you were out with your friends. Sherlock was round. They were arguing-“
He can’t sleep, knows that if he does manage to slip into a dream that it’ll soon morph into his daughters face, crying in pain. It’ll turn into Sherlock’s anguished cry as he holds his daughter one last time. It’ll turn into her skin, slowly becoming cooler in his palm as he clings on to her hand, hoping that all of this is a cruel game.
"What will happen next?" Dr Pace sits up straighter, pulling her shoulders back and focussing on me. "Tomorrow we have planned for a neurological examination for around 12:30pm. This procedure is always compulsory after a patient has received a spinal cord injury as it tests the extent of the injury and whether or not their responses are fully functioning."
"Hey, it's alright, John." Sherlock placed a kiss to the corner of John's mouth. "We don't have to tell them." Another cry rippled through John's body as Sherlock spoke softly to him, knowing that what he said was untrue. He needed to tell them. It wasn't an option. He couldn't continue hiding the one person who he cared for most in this world from the two people who were meant to support him through everything. It just wasn't right.
If anyone ever questioned why John didn’t dress her before breakfast well he’d point to occasions such as this one where food was less consumed and more used as makeshift art supplies
‘That doesn’t matter right now Greg, she needs us.’ He looked at the older Holmes brother, saw the eyes scanning the image, the slowly dawning panic,
Ensuring Mrs Hudson was seated comfortably he turned to Sherlock's brother, best just to ask the questions that had been causing him concern, ‘Mycroft do the Holmes family have any traditions when It comes to naming children, I only ask because both you and your brother have such distinctive names, I would hate to step on anyone’s toes with my choice.’
From where he was crouching leaning against the stretch of wall between the door to 221b and the kitchen’s baby gate he could see the glassy gaze of the horse and felt the irrational roll of fear through his gut that told him someone was watching him,
Your loyal companionship means more to me than I know how to express, thank you for your care and patience. Happy Valentine's Day My John Watson.
‘In all honesty I don’t know what to tell you, he wasn’t a fake, he was as amazing as he seemed, he could deduce almost anyone in a matter of seconds, he was my best friend and I miss him. He wasn’t really a hero though, he was definitely not a villain but he was selfish, self righteous, he had a superiority complex to rival anyone, the man was a genius but he never considered how his genius could hurt others.’
‘John, I don’t know what further advice I can give you, unfortunately I am similar to my brother in my understanding of emotional matters, either of us particularly well versed in the care of others.’
John lifted his head from fixing the woman’s tea to look her over. She stood casually, enough but clutched what looked to be a newspaper clipping. ‘No Mrs. Hudson, no plans why?’
‘Yep, I’ve been signed off until Monday and then it’s for a review session. I have to give my report and statement and generally follow the rules.’
“John you’re bargaining,” Mrs. Hudson said softly trying to reach out and comfort him. “Suicide never makes sense darling.”
John’s eyes remained fixed on the image clutched between his hands, a grainy image,it had been taken as part of the procedure for recovered victims. The picture had been taken upon her removal from one of the many dens of iniquity Project Poppy was responsible for closing down. His bosses had all been working the same line, feeding it to him like a prayer, a mantra to strive for.
‘Of course, they wouldn’t allow that anyway but they’ll be on a heightened alert while you’re away from home. John I’m going to leave you to rest, or if that proves impossible, a restful morning. I shall see you at seven; a car will arrive to collect you. The code for today is ‘Orchid’ my father’s idea I assure you.’  John chuckles lightly, Mycroft’s tone has dipped into one he’s all too familiar with, it’s similar to the one Sherlock would use when discussing Mycroft’s involvement in cases.
Mycroft was the greatest help in the end. He bought me my first and only pet when I was six. “To teach me responsibility” was the official story but the truth of it was that I was lonely John. My brother saw it in me, saw the stern face I wore and the foul temper I was developing. He saw these things and bought me a friend, someone I could love and talk to whilst he was away at school.
I hope Christmas is treating you well wherever you spent it. I imagine with your sister or Mrs Hudson, perhaps both, I was attempting to remember the details of our last Christmas together fully last night. I lay in bed and tried to place the events in a proper order in my mind but I am afraid they have become some what jumbled. I remember the disastrous party you insisted upon. I remember the morgue and Molly. I remember playing for you and Mrs Hudson but I think that came first. I played for you in the morning, something light, you went to see your sister first thing, it didn't go well.
They both looked down at Mina. Cradled as she was, she had actually managed to work her thumb between her lips this time, she lay sucking it quietly.
‘Damn it Hannah, assistance on route.’  Franklin and Devin had been partners for five years before they both made Sergeant, they still worked together whenever possible but they both had teams of their own now.
His mother collected her glass before standing at the drawing room’s window;  it looked out over the lawn and rose beds but Mycroft doubted she would see much through the days fading light, the other members of their party would arrive in due time and there was no point in her working herself up this way. She had lamented Gregory having to leave so soon after he woke up, a mere five hours of his delightful company was not nearly enough she declared, but he had insisted he had important matters to attend to. She had allowed the farewells only after she had forced an agreement for afternoon tea before they returned to Yorkshire the following week.
This is in fact the second chapter of this little fic outing but I thought i'd say hello now. I've managed to fix this so it appears in the series (hopefully cutting out any confusion) in the timeline of All of Me this run's alongside the first fic starting four months after Sherlock jumped off the roof of Saint Bart's.
The first time I held a gun I was fifteen and it was a hunting rifle. My Grandfather was a keen pheasant hunter and once the season was upon us he would take over the family’s estate in Yorkshire and prowl around our land with as many of his friends as he could muster. He continued with this tradition until late into his seventies when both his hearing and eyesight became too poor, but even then he would haunt our halls for those weeks when said poultry hunting was legal.
‘Humm, what, yes Lisa I’m sorry I was just a little,’ he points down at the little girl sucking on her own fist, he wonders vaguely if she’s teething, he’ll have to remember to pick up supplies for that.
INVESTIGATED DRUG SMUGGLING RING. WAS CAUGHT. UNPLEASANT. ESCAPED. 'HEAL THY SELF'. BOUGHT A NEW GUN. TOOK REVENGE. GOT TESTED AT LOCAL  HOMELESS MEDICAL SERVICE. PROVIDED WITH HIGH GRADE PAINKILLERS, I SAVED THESE RATHER THAN CONSUME THEM. BOUGHT COCAINE. DID NOT CONSUME IT. FLUSHED IT. MISS LONDON AND JOHN.
They’ve relocated to the chairs in front of the fire and at some point John realises someone’s made tea, he’s relatively certain it wasn’t him because he’s not been able to take his eyes off the little girl currently in between them, she’s sitting independently but he’s been certain to surround her with cushions. Lisa insists it’s not necessary;
The Sherlock voice that lived in the back of his mind, existed like an itch you just couldn’t reach, spoke up now, he did his best to ignore it during his everyday life but god did he miss the rush of a mystery, no matter how small this one was,
But now she stood, posture perfect, wine glass placed on a coaster on the side table to her right, facial features held in a neutral arrangement devoid of any strong emotion, except perhaps in her eyes, Mycroft thought to himself before standing as to be able to perform introductions, his Mother’s eyes held a slither of panic he was unused to but before he had the chance to offer her reassurances however the door leading to the hall opened wide and the two remaining members of their dinner party entered. The pair was in good spirits, laughter evident in their features and Mycroft deduced no tension between the two, clearly meeting in a less formal setting had put the men at ease. Siger had been snappish for the preceding hours preferring to take himself off to tend to Mycroft’s, somewhat neglected, orchids rather than be forced into his mothers endless dinner preparations.
John said it quietly, he knew Mycroft would recognise it, Sherlock had said that constantly, muttered it under his breath so often it became a mantra to John, whenever their world became too much, this was what he took comfort it.He took the remaining steps to the door, no one stopped him, he walked to the elevator, no one stopped him,  he stood waiting when Greg came out of his office, leaving the door open for the remaining inhabitant he shrugged his jacket on and made the straighten his tie. In John’s opinion it meant nothing but John knew Greg had long since stopped caring for that.
‘Well in that case I won’t try to see you on the wardrobe, changing table though that’s a must and we do have mahogany over here.’ He led the way to a section a richer toned colours, reds and greens and royal blue, the furniture was darker but in Johns limited knowledge looked hard wearing, and at the prices they were asking he would hope they were. Selecting appropriate pieces and a set of the sapphire blue bedding John left the store considerably poorer but feeling more prepared.
He unwraps it and finds a beautiful leather bound journal stamped with his initials in gold. John sits for a while and stares at the book before giving up trying to discover it's meaning and opening the note from Mycroft.
“Did he know about her? We’re not sure yet, Mina’s existence has been kept quiet for numerous reasons. There is a potential criminal link that we are investigating,” Mycroft indicated the folder and loose pictures, “The drug den Mina was found in has links to the mob Mitrović belonged to and as such is also linked to Moran.”
I have been plagued by migraines since my teens. We never discussed it and you never saw the worst of them John, I apologise for hiding them from you but I hate the idea of you feeling guilt for not being able to cure me of the dreadful things.
We are nearing this train’s final destination and I am running out of room on these slips of paper to tell you anymore.
Sensing his audience Mycroft turns, his eyes meet Greg’s and he suddenly realises why the eyes were so familiar, they were so similar to Mycroft’s one might think they were the same, except Greg couldn’t imagine anyone else’s eyes shining in quite the same way Mycroft’s did. The man doesn’t smile but points silently to one of the chairs by the fire Greg noticed upon entering the office. Mycroft starts shouting in Russian at whoever is at the other end of the phone.
“John, dear, wouldn’t you rather sit down? All that pacing looks to be riling you up?” Mrs. Hudson asked from her perch in front of Mycroft’s desk.
‘John please, I just, just for now will you allow me this, this precaution will cost you nothing and you won’t be aware of it. Keeping her safe is all I want.’ John knew he couldn’t say no, he also knew that saying no wouldn’t stop Mycroft Holmes, better to agree so he was at least aware of who was watching them.
‘Donovan reporting civilian extractions complete two injuries but no fatalities.’  He hears his radio slightly over the din, he indicates to six members of his team to secure the side of the building Sally left through, they move and clear out the criminals between them and the exit, there’s a large man lumbering towards them now but between the two of them they manage to subdue him and get the zip tie around his wrists.  He indicates to Arnav to get him outside while he checks the office with two of the others; the three officers enter the room and check for individuals hiding in the corners or shadows of the room, P.C. Osborn calls clear from his right and he relaxes slightly, the office was the only place separate from the main room except the bathrooms which were by Franklin’s entrance, her team would have taken care of them as an immediate priority. He returns to the room to see three members of Franklin’s team taking down another behemoth of a man, but he appears to no longer be armed, he witnesses them wrestle him to the ground and tie both his hands and feet, it’s a technique used for the more difficult arrests but he appreciates its necessity.
Mycroft has placed Mina on the floor now and she’s clinging to the edge of the chair while he speaks to her, he’s explaining the history of the watch she’s currently grasping in the hand not helping her stand. It’s an interesting story but John can’t focus on Mycroft’s words. He considers his own mother and the frankly terrible relationship he has with her, Mina will never know her if he can control the situation, he can’t think of anything more toxic to a child who’s already seen so much, but her growing up without grandparent seems unfair. He worries about her socialisation, so far her family consists of himself and Mycroft, there’s Mrs Hudson whom John is certain will provide love and support as Mina ages but it could surely only be a positive to increase the number of people that love her.
