In a long, long while
"Fucking ties." I mumble under my breath, leaving it and deciding I'll make Nat do it later on. I do up the waistcoat and slide my arms through the jacket, slipping on my black dress shoes at the same time. I walk out of my room, still messing with the tie. All of the other bridesmaids gasp when they see me.
"Tyler, butt on seat."
Tony teases Peter the whole way to the gym. Steve just looks embarrassed at how his husband is acting. The pair of us exchange glances, having a silent conversation. I jerk my head forward slightly and he nods. We start to jog, picking up speed to get away from the bickering children. We continue at a moderate pace and Captain looks impressed that I can keep up with him. Before we can start a real race, we arrive at the gym, seeing that it is occupied by a few of the Avengers. Steve gives me a pat on the back and walks over to who I think is called Clint? Hawkeye? I don't know and quite frankly, I don't particularly care. I decide to do what every socially challenged teenage does in this situation. Put my headphones in, play music full blast and step on the treadmill. The song Rockstar by Nickelback comes on as the platform speeds up to a run. I don't stop as the song changes to bassline junkie, or when it goes through the whole welcome to the black parade album. No. I don't stop when I can feel the breath start to burn through my lungs. No I don't. stopping is for the weak.
Everyone's been away on missions more and more recently. And Dad and Papa are always fighting over the accords. Divorce is hanging in the air.
"God, that wasn't supposed to happen. Sorry kids, I'll call the school in the morning, make them change it."
"Define lunch or be incinerated." She threatens, struggling slightly with the big word and unable to see due to the helmet on her head.
Time skip again because I'm lazy. We've been over this. Fast forward to last period, Friday.
"In there?"
"I can't lose you прекрасный. I've lost too much already. None of us could bare the pain of losing you. Please try."
"Then we shall go to her." I give the woman a final glare before crouching down in front of Lexie.
"Yeah, that's me kiddo." I turn to look at the other gentleman in the room. My mouth fell open.
"Tell me Mrs Mitchell, why do you want your daughter back? Why now?" She takes a moment before answering the judges question.
I got gym class in half an hour
Time skip: 5 days later. Avengers family meal.
"That's where your wrong. I stopped loving him the moment he put his hands on you. And not in the battle." I place the frame down picture first so I couldn't see it. Dad looked guilty af.
"Yeah well, I had to learn to fight for myself. Maybe you could train me a little." My voice was hopeful. 'I'd love that.' His thick arm wraps around my dainty shoulder.
"You girls here for the karaoke?" He asks.
I slam my elbows onto the keys and put my face in my hands, allowing the silent tears to cascade down my face. Is it my fault? I hear sniffling behind me so I whip my head around to find the avengers, minus my dad's and Peter, crowding round the door. I hastily wipe away my tears.
"Don't make promises you can't keep."
"Dinner everyone!" Papa yells out from the kitchen where he's mainly been all day. We all make our way to the massive table and take a seat. I end up being sandwiched between Wade and Natasha, Pete and MJ opposite us, Dad and Papa sitting at each head of the table, Wanda and vision next to Wade, Clint and Bruce next to Nat. Thor and Loki sat either side of the love birds with Bucky and Sam either side of them.
He's got a dream he's got a dream. Clint starts up again, standing on the sofa, making it overly dramatic.
In loving memory of Steven Grant Rogers.
"Let's go." I say swinging the bag onto my shoulder and walking passed the two adults on the way out of the room. I didn't get very far before my head began to spin again.
We arrive back at the tower in record time.
"Tony, he's right. We've put so much time into showing the courts that we're good dads, we've forgotten to be good dads." Steve turns to face me, brushing some strands of hair off of my forehead. "I'm so sorry Tyler. I promise. I'm going to spend more time with you." I smile slightly at him and lean away from Nat when he opens his arms for a hug. Soon enough, all the others had joined, saying how sorry they are for their neglect, promises to do things with me but it'll all have to wait. Tomorrow was the day. Tomorrow was court day. I'm not ready for this.
"No more okay? Wade keep an eye on her." And with that, she leaves to find Clint. Mumbling something about babysitting all night. I turn back to my boyfriend, grabbing his hand once more and start to pull him towards the elevator. Once situated inside I pull out my phone and text Pete, telling him where we'd be.
And he says,)
"Kiss me like you missed Red." I say, dropping my arms.
And violence-wise my hands are not
"Pepper, words cannot describe how I feel about you. I want to start my speech by saying that I love you. I love you more than words can explain. I love you more than I love building things in my lab. I love everything about you. I love the way you smile, the way you laugh. The way that you dance with my daughter when your baking and the way that you help my son with his homework. I love you when you get mad that I spend all my time in my lab and I love you when you don't. You're the glue that keeps this family together and I know that we'd fall apart without you. I don't know what I would do if you weren't part of my life. My kids call you 'Mom' we love you. We're a family. I wouldn't change any of that for the world. I promise I'll try and come up with a stable sleeping pattern and I'll make sure that you're all protected. I've got to protect what I can't loose and that's you guys. I promise, I'll do everything in my power to protect you. I love you." I wipe my eyes once dad finishes, cupping a hand around my mouth before yelling.
"Yeah, I guess we did."
"Leave that to the professionals to decide kid. Look," He begins moving to sit next to me, his arm going around my shoulder. "I know you hated the idea from the get go but look at how much they've helped over the years. You're doing so much better and if you just stop and go cold turkey, you're going to make yourself sick." I don't take my eyes off my shoes, too ashamed and embarrassed to look up.
I'm a lover, not a fighter
"No, I know what it's like in there and if I could take every single one of them out of that situation I could, even if I can just take one or two it'll make me sleep better at night. So, are you sure we're ready for this?"
"Yes thank you Jarvis." When I don't hear anymore I assume he's gone. I lift my bag onto my bed and look through the limited options I had. I finally decide on a pair of black jeans and a long sleeve plain black shirt with a skull and cross bones in the top corner. I close the door as I leave my room and start retracing my steps from yesterday.
I'm so glad I left my tower
"I'm fine." She sighs and shakes her head.
Nat carries on singing in character.
"No work Ty, you're a bloody workaholic. Break. Now let's go get your girlfriend."
"What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?" I know that voice, I remember this situation, this is how my and Wade met, how we started. I decide to play along.
"I'm not even that good." He scoffs.
"My names Tyler."
"Stark get out." When he doesn't move she starts yelling at him to leave. I start counting to 10 in my head, desperate to get rid of the dark feeling that was quickly consuming me. It didn't work. The last thing I hear is Wanda yelling my name then everything went dark.
"I mean, not if you don't want to I just." She cuts me off my pressing her lips to mine in a slow but passionate kiss.
"I'm not hungry." I'm lying. "I ate at the orphanage before you came." I haven't eaten in 3 days. Please see through my lies. Peter scoffs as he finishes his third slice.
"Open up baby boy." I look at him with sad eyes shaking my head no.
"Okay let's start easier shall we? Can you talk?" She nods.
"Tyler, that was beautiful. Have you told them that?" I hold back a smile.
"What's up?" I ask, sitting on my bed, staring pointedly at him.
Can't you see me on the stage performing Mozart
"Yeah, 7 years. I was adopted by Tony Stark when I was a little older than you. This used to be my room actually." She looks at me confused.
"You two need to wear something fancy. It's a fancy joint."
Time went quickly. Sean ordered pizza for dinner so mom could spend more time with me without having to worry about cooking. And soon enough, it was 10 at night. All the kids were asleep so it was me, mom and Sean sat around the living room watching Paranormal Activity 3. It got the peak of the movie when mom's phone went off causing us all to jump out of our skin.
Translation: Дорогой = my darling.
"If it wasn't for you, you know, leaving and being such a shitty mom, no offence."
"I also grant monthly visitation rights to Harleen Mitchell. She will legally be able to see Tyler for 15 hours each month. She may use her time as she pleases as long as it does not interfere with her Daily timetable such as school or extra curriculum activities. If you deny Mrs Mitchell these hours we will be meeting again very shortly. Tyler's social worker will be present during the meetings. Case closed." The judge stands up to leave as we're directed out of the room. The waiting room of filled with happy shouts and cheers as we all have a massive hug. I get passed from person to person like a rag doll before I'm placed on my feet in front of somebody. I look up to see my mother, a sad smile plastered on her face.
"Ty? You almost ready Darling?"
"That's me kid." I nod my head, deep in thought. I snap my eyes up to meet his. He seems a little intimidated so I soften my steel orbs slightly, offering him a smile.
"прекрасный? You okay?" I reach over to unlock the door, standing in front of the redhead assassin. I feel the blood rush to my cheeks already.
"Tyler Stark-Roger, Level 10. Welcome back Tyler. Boss wishes for me to inform you to look out as Mr Barton knows about this trip."
"I'm fine." I say standing up. "I've had worse." I lock eyes with the assassin as I say this. She smiles sadly at me but I just brush it off. Thor comes over to me, outstretching his hand.
"Dude, what? I'm talking."
"Yeah, please." We walk in and start flicking through endless rows of sale items and I somehow find myself in the men's section, staring at the rows of boxers and flannel shirts. I feel Nat's hand on my shoulder and I move away embarrassed.
"Of course I'm fine with it. You make him happy. That's all I want."
"I'm not who you think I am." I start. Everyone looks confused.
"Hey there." I catch the small child's attention and she looks up at me with bright blue eyes, her frizzy brown hair falling in her face slightly.
"Yes is there a problem with that?"
"So do you like it outside?" Dad asks, attempting to strike up a conversation.
"Shoot, sorry Ty." Tyler shares a small smile which the man of spiders returns.
"Hey are you guys Midtown?"
"I'll come find you later." I promise as I allow my dad to pull me away. The next song which just so happens to be 'Butterfly fly away' comes on and we start dancing slightly. I see Pete and Mom dancing over my shoulder and realise that it must be the daddy/daughter dance.
"Bye Pete." I slowly move towards the adults. Steve notices me first, wrapping his arm around my shoulders and kissing my head, giving me the whole be good speech. Tony follows suit, hugging me and telling me to give Clint hell when I get there. I promise both of them that I shall do just that. And grip my tiger tightly, stepping into the elevator with Natasha.
"Where's MJ?" I ask, looking around the room for my girlfriend.
"Can we have a moment with the kids please?" One of the men asked. She was unwilling but obliged anyway, giving us both a look that we knew too well. The 'keep your mouth shut or else' look. After she'd left the room fell into an uncomfortable silence until one of the adults spoke up.
"None of your fucking business." I reply, standing up from the table. The avengers look at each other, awkward expression on their faces. Tony looks livid.
"What's wrong Joshie?" I ask, my tone soft. He wraps his arms around my neck and mumbles about there being too many people. I sigh and stand up with the boy still my arms. This kid is about the only one I can stand in this place. I look at Peter and he just shrugs. I set Josh on his feet.
So our differences ain't really that extreme
(Normal=both)
"Yes ma'am. Served just under 7 years."
"Honey, I'm a super spy. What did you expect?" I say no more as I lift the cup to my lips, blowing on the steaming contents before taking a sip. The first sip of coffee in the morning is always the best, don't even try to argue. The room was filled with comfortable silence, the music being turned off by a semi angry Black Widow, who was making coffee for herself and her husband, and Clint was watching over the waffles carefully, as if they'd burn totally if he turned away for just one second. Not before long, all three of us were sat around the circular table, filling our plates up with various toppings, Clint drowning his waffles in syrup whereas me and Nat opt for fruit instead. To say the food was nice would be the understatement of the century. Katniss really did know how to cook. Once I finished, I get up to rinse off my plate. Nat follows suit, taking it out of my hand and putting it into the dishwasher.
"I think I'm gender fluid." I mumble, silently praying she didn't hear me but, unfortunately for me, she did. All she does it tighten her hold on me.
"No!" That was louder than I meant it.
"Night Daddy."
"Clint I swear to God you're al literal 5-year-old. Let the poor girl sleep."
"I missed you too Mama. But. Those guys over there." I peek over my shoulder to see them all still catting excitedly, probably making plans about the party later.
"Wade." I stand in the same stance as Natasha did back in my room, trying to ignore how hot he looked in his dress pants and shirt.
"Glad you like it. Now go check out your rooms." I grab Peter's hand and drag him through the front door. Looking at the detailed interior with awe.
"Fuck off Flash."
"I think I'll take you up on that offer."
"Sure, just stay safe and don't be too long. Mom's making dinner soon."
Steven kissed Tony’s damp forehead. “I’ve got nothing but time.”
He put Steve out of his mind. He had a lot to do. Pepper had decided that maybe they should get married, maybe that would help the depression he’d been in for months now. He wasn’t sure it would help. He could never love her like he’d loved Steve Rogers, but he’d damn sure try. Maybe it would be enough.
Tony felt like hell, but the guy he’d picked up last night was hot. Well, Tony thought he was, anyway. He didn’t remember too much after a while. They drank an obscene amount of someone’s top shelf Scotch. It could have been his. He wasn’t sure.
“The day Carol brought you home. I was shaving when I felt the vibrations of the ship coming in.”
Tony let himself into his apartment at the Tower in New York. He couldn’t bear to stay at the Avengers compound since Siberia. He missed Steve so much that it physically hurt sometimes to think about him. The compound had reminders of Steve everywhere, of all they’d all lost.
“Oh yeah,” Tony said, his voice low. “That’s so good, Steve.”
Shame washed over Steve, shame that he’d let it go this far, shame that he’d lost control so completely.
Tony still felt completely betrayed by Steve, in every way. He had never trusted Tony enough to tell him the truth about Barnes and his parents, to do what was right about the Accords, about anything, really. And he’d never known how much Tony had cared for him. That had been a secret that Tony held tightly to his own heart.
He found himself hoping for a look or a word of encouragement from Tony, but there was nothing, as if it never happened at all. Tony acted completely normal toward him.
Everyone but Steve Rogers, that is.
Tony laughed. “Yeah, I can tell.”
“Privacy protocols, JARVIS,” Tony said and did just that.
“You want me to – you want to come in my mouth?” Steve asked him as he looked up into Tony’s eyes.
Tony shot back.
“Yes – no. Let me get my pants on.”
“You’re not! Oh,” Tony said and shut his mouth. This was going differently than Steve had thought it would. “Now I know what you were doing when I asked.”
Stark nodded.
Sheriff Rogers really liked Anthony Stark. He was brilliant, funny and the nicest person in Timely – when he was sober.  Which was not that often. To be completely honest, the sheriff liked him drunk almost as much as sober. He was still funny, sarcastic and sang
“I want that,” Tony said, turning back to Steve. “I want you like that.”
“What do I say?”
“Even nobodies come from somewhere.”
One night after a particularly brutal mission back in Afghanistan to remove some Chitauri tech from the Taliban, they both went back to Tony’s place. Steve stripped out of his suit as soon as they were in the door. Tony started to take off his underclothes and he stopped.
They lay quietly after it was done, Steven staring at the ceiling and Tony lying on his side, staring at Steven.
The underwear came off next and Tony found himself on the receiving end of Steve Rogers’ mouth. He thought he might die when Steve pressed him onto this back and began to stroke his cock slowly at first. He looked into those blue eyes and saw his own lust reflected back at him. He hadn’t expected Steve to be so hot.
Steve poured a third shot and downed it with Stark. His heart and his gut didn’t hurt quite as bad now as they did a little bit ago. He looked at Stark. Maybe Stark had the right idea.
Steve laughed. “You do see this video, don’t you?”
“You gonna watch me all day?” Tony asked him.
“Did you destroy him?” Steve paused in his punching and looked at Tony.
“Yeah. Why are you angry?”
“I get that all this is just fun for you, but I – it’s different for me.”
The two men walked down the street to an apartment building. Steve punched in a code to unlock the elevator and the two of them rode up to the fifth floor and got out. Steve punched a door code and opened the door to an apartment. Tony followed him in.
Steve figured if he had to put up with Stark with no stimulants or sedatives, then Stark could put up with him the same way. He sometimes enjoyed pissing Stark off, too, but he’d deny that if it came down to it.
It turned out that he’d worried for nothing.  Tony Stark didn’t act any differently than he had before their rendezvous in the smithy. He drank too much and teased Rogers about being so upright and good just like he had before. And he sat on his porch and sang
He knew, as soon as he opened his eyes, that there was someone in the room with him. Did he pretend he was asleep or did he ask who the hell was there?
There was only one other door, so Steve rightly assumed that one was the bedroom. He opened it and hefted Tony into his arms and carried him into the room. The moonlight shone through the one window and Steve saw a big, wooden bedframe with what appeared to be a homemade quilt on top. There was a table beside the bed and a small vanity against the opposite wall with a chair pulled up to it.
When he finished, Steve took the towel and wiped Tony’s face. “Take a look.”
“God yes. Don’t stop. Oh fuck!” Steve said, whispering the words. Tony knew the dreams he was having when he’s said those things. They were dreams of him and Steve.
"We have a field trip coming up shortly." She was cut off by the animated chatter bouncing around the room.
"That was only 7, keep going."
The one desire
"It's mad that you've lived there for so long but still haven't met her." MJ comments as we jump down the stairs.
And I don't wanna fight
"Sorry guys, my social worker is waiting for me." They look at me sadly but I just flash them a smile, just like my dad does. I hug each of them in turn.
"No way. Your. Your." I point to my shirt and the mystery guy laughs slightly.
"You tried what darling?" Tears flow down my cheeks.
By 9 o'clock all three of us were cuddled up on the sofa, Nat leaning on Clint and me just laying across their laps, watching Bolt. Natasha's hand was playing with my loose curls and Clint's hand was stuck in a bag of popcorn. I was absolutely drained. I'm so glad I had that nap. Clint taught me how to shoot an arrow and that turned into a nerf gun war. Don't ask how it just did. Then it turned into a teenage girl's slumber party. We put a blindfold on Clint and did his makeup, he looked fabulous. Nat let me paint her nails, and then she did mine. All before crashing for a pizza Disney marathon. When Bolt finished the Hawk stood up to put the next movie in. he lifted my feet back up and sat down, dropping them into his lap. The title sequence rolled for Tangled. Clint ran off and came back with a blonde wig on his head and a purple dress hanging off his body. He starts running and dancing to the music in the movie. Me and Nat decide to get involved. Nat playing Flynn and me Pasqual. That was until the song 'I have a dream.' Clint pulls off the wig and places the dress on my shoulders, grabbing a costume hook and singing the first part, the accent and all.
"Wade! What the fuck! What are you doing here?" he doesn't answer as he stands handing me the set of under garments he got me for Christmas last year. I take them from his hands and start slipping them on.
"So" I start. "What do you think?" I feel myself become more nervous the longer they take to answer.
"Tyler! Watch your language!" I groan.
"Kids, all we need to try and do is to stop them from getting away. Pete you keep your distance and web them up, Tyler try and spook them a little, Teleport use guns. Both of you go for Cap's legs why do we do that?"
"Great. Hey guys, my name's Arron and I'll be your tour guide today. I'm going to hand you all a badge with you name on. It's a level 1 badge which means it will be deactivated in 6 hours' time." A girl called Clay puts her hand up.
"Walls, chains, knives, bullets, blood." I answer, rocking back and forth.
"How did you get in here?" He asks, concern lacing his voice. I roll my eyes.
"You draw?" He asks, pointing to my countless sketch pads and pencils laying behind me. I nod shyly, hiding my face behind my hair. "May I see?" I nod my head and pass him the top book. He flicks through it, looking impressed.
"Wake up kiddo's." I'm woken by my slumber by Dad pulling open the curtains. All four of us groan in unison at the bright light.
And when I got home, before I said amen,
"I don't know Ty, you know he's pissed at her." I sigh.
"Hi, I'm Wade Wilson, pleasure to meet you." Nat just stares at his outstretched hand before grabbing my elbow gently but firmly.
"What's going on?" A voice from the door asks.
"I'm so sorry Tyler. I didn't know what I was doing. It wasn't me. Please forgive me." I say nothing and just throw myself into his arms, sobbing onto his shoulder.
"That's not going away anytime soon." Tor stands up and picks up the hammer with ease.
"Happy birthday loser." MJ says. I manage to get out of Wade's clutches long enough to give MJ a short hug and accept the gift that she was handing to me. Ned was holding one as well. I shook my head.
"Damn straight." Clint yells from across the room cause a round of laughter to sound over the hall.
"Oh hey Pete, Hey Ty. Didn't know you were here."
"Because I thought about going back to her." They share a look of confusion.
"Tyler! What the hell is going on with you lately?" Steve all but screams as I roll my eyes at him.
Compound.
Pepper was naturally going to be Maid of Honour, and Rhodey would be giving Tony away. They then had to decide on when they would be getting married and where, if they would have a big or a small wedding, and of course where they would go on Honeymoon. But before they could start making such decisions disaster struck, and for once it was with Tony, or with Steve, or with the Avengers at all. In fact it happened to Peter.
“No, that will not happen.” Steve assured him, “You are a brilliant Mother, anyone with eyes can see that. Peter and Zach are healthy and generally happy. This is a first time incident for Peter, social services won’t hold one fight against him.”
“Of course I’m worried.” Tony said, “I’ve to face the UN again, if we don’t get their agreement then… well we’re fucked because our best defence against Thanos won’t happen,”
Since last time, Steve had Friday wake him up the moment Tony began to show signs of a nightmare so he could wake him up before it took hold, this had led to interrupted nights but Tony hadn’t suffered the full horrors of the nightmares since.
Toby beeped happily and proceeded to accept the bread and began to toast it, very carefully.
“Modest as always Mr Stark.” Pepper drawled, “You do remember what happened the last time you got into a “Funvee” as you called it?”
“Maybe I’ve tamed Cap.” The Omega in question offered with a grin to Steve.
“Mamma, Mamma I was so scared, I tried to get away, I fighted them and struggled but they catched me and they did something to me.” Zach babbled wrapping his arms about Tony’s neck and holding him tight.
The children’s easy acceptance relaxed the tension and everyone sat and ate the take away Shwarma, all too tired and hungry to care what they were eating that much.
“Roger that.”
Anthony Edward Stark, Iron Man.
“You maybe right.” Bucky whispered back,
“Sharon?” Steve asked with a frown, he had recognised the woman as the Nurse who’d been living next door to him in Brooklyn, Kate.
Commander Kovarian was too old to get into battles, he’d spent his youth fighting, it had cost him his eyes and his joints, he was too arthritic, too tired to throw himself into the action as he once had done, that was a task for the young. Ignoring the gun fire, screams, explosions and general mayhem going on above, he made his way down the corridor heading for a hidden escape tunnel that would lead him outside of the base to where a transport would be waiting for him and take him and the baby to safety.
“A factory engaging in illegal experiments.” Sam said.
They remained like that for a few moments before breaking apart to breathe, they stared at each other in stunned silence. Inevitably it was Tony who broke the silence with a question,
“That isn’t true.”
“Can I touch him?” Peter asked the doctor, his fingers flexing nervously, desperately wanting to hold Tony’s hand but not daring to do so in case he hurt him.
Steve snorted, as he located eggs, bacon, flour, and milk. Pancakes and bacon for breakfast, he decided. “A single slice of pizza does not qualify as a meal, Tony,” he said, with practised patience, heaven knows his Tony had never eaten properly unless forced to by others, believing that he could survive on coffee and stubbornness alone.
Zach, used to hearing this threat given to Peter without any follow through, ignored this in favour of jumping on Peter and Steve, demanding that they get up so they could go to the beach.
“You.” Steve whispered, “Don’t you remember?” Like one would approach a wild animal he carefully grew closer so as not to alarm the man, “Bucky it’s me, it’s Steve, I’m your friend.”
“It never ceases.” He murmured making the scientist nearest him look up.
The rest of the team ignored him, letting him suffer in solitude, however, Clint’s video was a hit on Youtube when he posted it the next day and plenty of fans began to ask for Steve and Thor to try the twenty-thousand calorie challenge since ten-thousand wouldn’t be that much of a strain for their metabolic rates.
“Copy that.” Steve said eyeing the soldiers as they approached,
“In the future? Who can say?” Steve replied, “But as for right now, I am happy to spend time with my daughter and this worlds Tony Stark, who has shown immense generosity and kindness in giving us a home here.” He gave Tony a beaming smile as the Billionaire stared at him with something close to amazement on his face, an image that was capture by several cameras and would be published shortly there-after.
Huge fast cars roared down the roads, bright signs and gigantic television screens hung in windows and on walls, people spoke to other people in different countries on tiny devices that was mobile telephones which were more powerful than the giant computing machines that the allies were developing in the war.
“Hey, Capsicle, welcome to my casa, come on in.” Tony greeted with a bright smile, “Mind the Loki shaped hole in the floor, and there might be some shattered glass from where he tossed me out of the window, I haven’t really gotten around to cleaning the mess up yet.”
“Now, we go back to work.” Obie replied lighting up a cigar, “We’ve a company to run. While you can’t officially take over as CEO until you’re Twenty-One, you can get started in R&D and I want you to. You’re ten times the engineer and scientist Howard was and I want to put that genius of yours to use.” He took a long pull of his cigar and went to his suitcase, taking out a small packet of pills which he tossed to Tony. “After heat pills. They’ll get rid of anything that might have been conceived, you’re too young for pups and I don’t want them.”
Honestly, the poor boy clearly had a death wish. However, possibly suicidal ideation aside, Sam did bring the suit with him so Tony could work on repairing it enough to make it functional while he also worked on the program to bring down Hydra.
He passed all of those tests with flying colours, but his legs and feet remained numb.
“TMI!” Peter sing-songed, “Could Ned and MJ come to the school?”
Steve bristled at Natasha’s tone, and her presumptuous belief that she had a right to advise him on anything he did.
Then equipped with a torch each, along with drinks, marshmallows, biscuits, and chocolate, they all headed back down to the beach where Steve set up a bonfire which they sat around toasting the marshmallows making s’mores.
*****
Sure enough, within the next thirty minutes Steve had a Facebook account, and Twitter account set up, and Tony gave him tutorials in both so Steve would be able to post images and comments at his leisure.
“Absolutely.”
Peter flushed, being called Spiderbaby, PreciousPeter, and Sweet-Cinnamon-roll-Stark was not exactly badass, but he had to admit he liked the I <3 Zach Stark tags.
“Accessing Sir.”
“How come?”
Tony nodded his head and took a steadying breath, “Well, the Doctor didn’t say that it would be impossible, just very unlikely, so maybe we don’t have to give up hope completely.”
Norman was of course seething over this, his PR team had released a statement on his behalf expressing his condolences to Tony, but anyone who knew Norman knew that he was only concerned about saving himself and his company.
In the lab he handed Steve the written report from his Omegaologist and sat down on a stool letting Steve read through the pages. As he did so he bit the inside of his lips and clenched his teeth focusing on not giving in to the burn in his eyes. He was not going to cry. He was not that weak. He was Iron Man and he would not cry.
The Fantastic Four, The Defenders, and the X-Men all agreed to an alliance in the event of another world threatening danger.
Tony gave Steve a grim smile as the super soldier joined him and they headed to the garage where one of the cars was already started up and ready for them.
“Yeah.”
*******
Peter went up to his room and got onto his laptop, setting about doing his homework, while he was typing an e-mail came through from Ned asking him about the Web fluid and his suit.
“He means pop tarts he’s addicted to them.” Clint said.
Back in the forties an unmated or widowed Omega would have a guardian Alpha, usually a family member, or if there was no family, then a close family friend would do instead, and when an Alpha or a male Beta wanted to court said Omega, he or she would ask the guardian Alpha’s permission to take them out. It was pretty much the same as asking a Beta Female’s Father for her hand in marriage.
“They are afraid of getting hurt.” He said, “Neither of them has realized that the other feels the same and they are both afraid that if they speak out they will be rejected.”
“Ice cream?” Tony pretended to be shocked, “You want ice cream as well as pancakes? I don’t know about that, we’ll have to have a very serious discussion before I can agree to that.”
‘They look so cute together!!!!’ One commenter said,
"I need to get back into business!" Norman bellowed slamming his fists down onto the desk, "I'm losing a fortune with the tower being shut down, and for what? One snot nose orphaned brat getting sickly? Bah!" he swept his hand across his desk scattering files in all directions, "Harry says he's nothing but a scrawny whelp that no one will miss. What would it have mattered if he'd died." He scowled as an egg broke against the window of his office, having been thrown by the haters in the street that were gathered outside his house. "If it wasn't for Stark having taken the brat on no one would even care."
What passed was a very comfortable nights sleep and Tony was in no hurry for it end, his young Son on the other hand had other ideas.
Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of olive skin and a white vest top. Kicking his legs Steve swam in that direction, finding Tony floating in the water, air bubbles leaving his mouth and nose, his eyes closed and body limp.
“They’ll find him little one.” Thor assured him. Besides him Sam kept a firm hold of Peter who was ashen and rigid, looking ready to bolt into the water to try and find Tony as well.
More laughter followed this statement before another reporter cut in with a question for Steve.
They were dead then.
“How did the name Captain America come about then?” a Reporter from New York Times called out.
“I’m fairly sure you won’t.” Steve laughed, pulling Tony in for a hug.
As normal if they were heading out to a mission soon after breakfast, Clint was checking his weapons at the breakfast table and kept using an arrow head as a fork which made Zach laugh and Natasha slap him upside the head, which saved Tony the job because really, he didn’t need Zach getting anymore bad habits, honestly Peter racing Zach into the kitchen and crawling all over the ceiling to do it was bad enough and all he could stand before he’d had at least a litre of coffee.
Wanda’s scowl morphed into an expression of distress, and she let out a sharp cry as if Steve had struck her!
The great sea battle of 2013 was just finished with Thor celebrating his victory having dunked Clint and Sam more times than they had dunked him. By the time they went back up onto the sand to dry off and settle in the sun for a bit, Tony finally came down from the villa.
“It’s my Son!” Tony cried shoving Steve’s hand away, “Fuck plans, if anyone gets in my way they die, that’s my plan.”
“We’ll have to show you the lab, it’s been retrofitted so it’s wheelchair friendly.” Peter said enjoying his second piece of cake,
“Christ, when did he get old enough for us to say “That age?” Tony asked, had it really been seven years since he gave birth? Fuck!
“You are a Captain?” Christine asked, typing furiously into her Stark Tablet,
“No?” Steve rose his eyebrow,
Steve winced when Emma got her Ken doll and Natasha showed her how to make Barbie drop kick his testicles.
He played the message and smiled to himself Curien was in Nassau County, he’d been to a free clinic and had his injury treated, it seemed Stark had shot him with his suit and all but destroyed his arm, the clinic had only been able to patch him up and he needed further treatment which he expected Norman to pay for.
“Yes Sir.”
“No.” Harry mumbled. He couldn’t bare the thought of being poor, or not having all of these things.
The second Tony was through the front door his children were on him, nearly knocking him onto his backside as they crowded him, talking ten to the dozen and clinging onto him like they were afraid he’d disappear.
“Or maybe you can be a Super Villain who captures me.” Steve said, “Has me tied up and at your mercy, but instead of torturing me you decided to use your wicked wiles to seduce me over to the dark side.”
Zach shrugged his shoulders petulantly and Peter sighed, “You know that this doesn’t help Mamma get any better, you adding stress to him won’t help at all.”
“I will.” Tony waved to Steve and finally let the cop shut the car door. He settled back into his seat and gave Bucky a reassuring smile.
“I’m gonna be Time Lord Professor!” Zach cheered and squirmed in Tony’s arms, “Want pancakes Mamma.” He said reaching for his plate where a half eaten pancake sat drowning in syrup.
“You’re really here?” He asked in disbelief, “You’re actually here?”
Only one of his ovaries was functional and even that was dodgy as it had cysts upon it and was scarred, the other one wasn’t working at all, his fallopian tubes were scarred and damaged, even his womb was in poor shape.
He was still hurt by Tony’s deceit, they would have to talk about it more, but…..maybe, just maybe a child wasn’t out of the question.
“Get me my baby!” Tony screamed at him as the Doctor held his bleeding nose.
“Pepper, do you mind baby sitting Lily?” Steve asked,
He was actually thankful when Tony took them to Burger King rather than dining in the hotel restaurant or ordering food service and he enjoyed the walk back to the hotel getting to take in some of the sights before they went back up to the room to waste some time watching a movie on the TV and eating Popcorn before they went down to the car to drive to the meeting point.
There were bottles of water and boxes of snack food besides the bed, the linens were fresh and the air in the room was pleasantly cool with a scent of rose petals that mingled well with Tony’s natural scent.
He worried about leaving fingerprints on the polished surfaces, of his trainers scuffing the marble lobby, felt horribly under dressed in his simple jeans, t-shirt, and plaid over shirt, (Which had Tony rolling his eyes at) Tony Stark did not do plaid, or khaki pants, or any of Steve’s (Old man and Kansas farm boy style)
One month after the battle of New York, Avengers Tower, as Tony had taken to calling it, leaving just the A from the STARK left up on the side of the building, was open for business and for everyone to move in.
Little Banshee, when she’d had bad bouts of colic! Though Steve couldn’t blame him, God knows Lily had a very healthy set of lungs on her that she put to damn good use.
Zach glared defiantly at him but his shouting stopped, “Good.” The man said pushing Zach back, “Now just stay like that and you might live through this.”
Statements like this, even messages of condolence Steve didn’t have a problem with, what he had a problem with was Secretary fuckface Ross daring to speak about Tony and criticize him, practically blaming him for his injuries and just about saying that Tony deserved to be crippled, as if he’d some how been asking for it!
“I can’t imagine anyone defending you, Stark.”
“Why?” Steve sounded so perplexed that Tony had no choice but to answer him, hardly noticing that they changed into another dance, this one full of spins and turns.
Steve almost wanted to tell Jarvis to tell Pepper to stay away, to keep the boys at home, but he bit his tongue. He couldn’t deny them the chance of being with their mother, especially not since Tony might…No!
Steve rose to his feet immediately alert to something being wrong with Tony. “You are aware that Sir’s relationship with his parents was strained at best?”
Steve chuckled and pulled him into a hug, “Look on the bright side. If they do manage to shoot Nat she’ll kill Barton so you won’t have to worry about him being a bad influence anymore.”
Peter rolled his lips and glanced over his shoulder, “Should I go and help?”
“I think you’ll find they are very serious.” Tony said getting to his feet and smirking at Norman, “And I am very serious when I say, I’ll see you in court.”
Steve rolled back onto his back and stared at their ceiling. Once he had Bucky back he’d set about exposing Stark for what he was. Make the world see him in his true colours, show them that The Merchant of Death had not changed and that Iron Man was just another ego trip for him.
“I know baby, I know.” Tony said undoing the last strap and lifting Zach up, he closed his eyes barely holding back the tears as he breathed in Zach’s scent. For a moment he didn’t do anything other than just hold Zach, feel the familiar weight of him in his arms and the press of his small body against him. The relief at having Zach back where he belonged was overwhelming, not even when Rhodey had found him in Afghanistan had he felt this much joy.
“And we’ll be waiting for him.” Steve said, “Ready and waiting.”
Tony was in two minds about sending him though. On one hand he knew it would be good for Zach, he’d get to interact with children his own age, he’d be meeting new people, making friends (Hopefully with great ease and Tony ever had) He’d have new activities and be helped to get ready for starting school when he was six.
“Lets start working on blueprints as soon as we get home.” He said to Jarvis blasting off in the direction of New York.
Rubbing his face Steve leaned forward in his chair and buried his face in his hands giving in to the urge to cry, everything was falling apart, Tony was miles away probably going into danger alone and unarmed, Peter was in a hospital bed, Zach was God knows where and this bastard terrorist was still at large. Steve didn’t know what to do to fix this or even how to try, he could only hope that Peter woke up soon and that Tony got a lead on the Mandarin, and that he decided to call for back up before going after him alone.
“Not much, maybe, but if he were to ally with another team…” Rhodey trailed off as Sam clearly got the idea,
The Maximoff Twins had been the only ones to survive the exposure to the sceptre, their bodies accepting the enhancements and becoming Struckers prized pets. Pietro Maximoff had developed immense speed, being able to move faster than the human eye could see and earned himself the code name Quick Silver. Wanda Maximoff had developed psychic and telekinetic powers. She move objects using the force of her powers, which glowed a brilliant blood red earning herself the name Scarlet Witch. Her psychic powers were even more devestating.
Steve laughed. “Not your breathing.”
“Damn you to hell!” Tony ground out. “Fuck me!”
Steve looked surprised. “I kept wanting you to look at me like I saw you look at other people. I wanted – then you did last night and I was scared to death.”
“Let me fix it,” Tony said.
That voice – oh god, that voice reminded him of so many nights in Steve’s arms. He needed to see him, to know he was real. He turned on the dimmest lamp in the room.
“Come sit down,” Tony said to him as they parted and looked at one another. “Resentment is corrosive and I hate it.”
He didn’t even bother with turning on the lights, just went to the sofa and plopped down on it.  And promptly fell sound asleep.
“Suck it,” Steve said, his voice low.
They went to see a drama about a lawyer and his father, a judge, who he defends in a murder trial. The movie was called
As soon as they were done eating, Tony asked for a bottle.
Uh oh.
“We’ll find out.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Not even with Peggy Carter?”
All the while, he thought about the blush from Rogers when they’d talked about crushes.
And those were the last words anyone spoke for several minutes.
“Wanna go for a walk?” he asked the other man, not even sure he could stand, much less walk. He’d not had this much to drink in a long while, not since the war.
“Want a drink?” Tony asked. He always asked.
Friday night came and Steve met Tony in the garage. Steve handed Tony the spare helmet and off they sped. They ended up at an authentic railcar style diner from the 50s. It had been moved to New York from another place and was owned and operated by an actual chef, but it still served classic burgers, fries and shakes from the 50s.
Tony thought he couldn’t be surprised by anything until Steve whispered into his ear, “I want you to fuck me.”
This intrigued Clint Barton more than he could admit out loud, even to Nat. He loved finding out secrets and he wanted to find out what it was that made Tony and the very staid Steve break up and go all pink and silly with one another. And what the hell was the disappearing about?
Tony threw his welding mask aside and sighed loudly. “Are you done bitching?”
“Me, too,” Steve nodded.
Tony laughed and pulled the covers over them. “Someone needs to.”
He slipped the ring on Tony’s ring finger and it fit perfectly. He remembered that Peggy had tied some string around it because it was too big when she wore it.
“Had?” Steve asked.
“Do you want more sexual harassment suits? You do realize they are not good things, right?”
“Okay. We can try it.” Steve didn’t get angry though he did look hurt at Tony’s behavior.
The hand was back on this thigh, but on the top now, moving slowly inward, fingers caressing Tony’s leg through his sweatpants. He felt Steve’s weight shift on the sofa and suddenly he felt Steve closer, one hand touching his face.
Tony wanted to ask him a million questions. Did this mean he might come in, sign the Accords? Did this mean he would surrender to Ross? But now, now was so not the time to ask Steve any of those things.
“Sounds like her. She has a science division in her organization that rivals HYDRA.”
Tony moved up on the bed and piled several pillows under his head. He motioned Steve to come closer and he did, getting on his knees at Tony’s head. He grasped the head board as Tony reached for his cock and began to stroke it slowly at first.
his fear that Tony might be making fun of him.
He was so close, so fast. He let his eyes close and they popped back open when Steve pulled off.
“Fine. Not anyone in the jail tonight so that’s a good thing. We sure need the rain.”
Steve kissed the device and then kissed Tony. Tony thought his knees might buckle when Steve looked up at him, his eyes dark with need. Steve was the only one who’d ever made his knees weak. The only one.
“It wasn’t just a blow job, was it?” Steve asked him, his voice quiet.
The trance that Tony felt like he was in seemed to disperse and he looked up at Steve.
Steve kissed him this time, tasting the sip of whiskey he’d had in the kiss. “Are you sure this is a good idea?” Steve asked him.
“What are you doing?” the sheriff asked him.
“They’ll hang us if they ever find out,” Steve told him.
“Walk me home?” Stark asked him in that low, husky voice he’d heard that other night months ago in the smithy. Steve’s heart sped up.
Tony nodded in the darkness and pulled Steve back up to his face for another kiss. Kissing Steve was much sweeter than Tony’d have thought as he tugged at Steve’s shirt. Steve sat up and pulled it over his head. Tony reached his hands up to touch Steve’s chest. He pulled Steve on top of him.
“God no.”
Tony laughed. “Poor boy,” he said loud enough that Pepper heard him from across the room.
The sun had been up a while when Tony woke. The other side of the bed was empty. He had known it would be. There was a note on the pillow in Steve’s scrawl.
“I know what’s there. It’s all right,” Steve told him. “But it’s all right to keep your shirt on, too.”
An hour later, the two men were riding out of Timely to check on the settlers. The sheriff had picked up their mail from the Post Office, as it only came general delivery and the settlers had to come into town for it.  Steven filled two canteens with water as well, handing one to Stark after they’d mounted their horse.
“Think we should get dressed and get back?” Steve asked as he pulled Tony close.
Tony grinned, almost shyly. “Who doesn’t like sex?”
Tony shrugged. “Try being me.”
“Come on, Stark. Let’s get your sorry ass home.” He put an arm around Stark’s waist and walked him down the street. He opened the door and hauled him inside. He headed for the sofa.
Four families had built cabins out near the river, but far enough away form the damn to be safe it failed. The unfortunate thing was they suffered from a shortage of water just as Red Wolf’s people did, but they made do with what they had.
Relief washed over him when the voice that answered was Steve’s.
“What ghosts?” Steve knew little about Stark’s past, only that he was once a wealthy man back east.
“Not your first rodeo?” Tony asked between kisses.
Damn him!
More and more, Sheriff Rogers was not able to put Stark out of his mind when he left him sleeping it off. He was embarrassed that he spent as much time as he did, thinking about the scent of Stark’s pricy after shave or how soft that deep brown hair was to touch.
“I should have been here. I – we – should have fixed our mess.”
Steve still wasn’t sure what to say so he licked his lip.
“Ride out to the ranches outside town with me? I like to get by them once every week or two and see if they need some help.”
Tony wriggled his hand between them and somehow managed to take both cocks into his hand, holding firmly as the sheriff fucked his hand. “That’s it, baby,” Tony whispered to him.
“You don’t have the Arc Reactor anymore?” Steve asked one night when Tony had just gotten back from a two-day business trip to California with Pepper.
“Do you think I’ll ever be all right again?” Tony asked him.
This was the third time this week Sheriff Steven Rogers hauled a drunken Stark out of the saloon and it was only Wednesday. It wasn’t that it was such a hard thing to do. Stark was not hard to carry and he never fought the sheriff when Steven said enough was enough.
Steve stood up from the chair he sat in, a wing chair beside the sofa.
“Did yours?”
Maybe someday they could smile once again.
“How do I know?” he ground out.
Tony put both hands on Steve’s ass and pushed up against him. He hadn’t done this since college and it was never this way back then. Steve was – he was so big, all over, and his skin was hot and his cock was hard, so fucking hard. Tony felt slick precome all over himself, from both of them.
and thought it looked good,” Steve told him.
“Fuck!” Tony cried out, moving his butt upward.
Steve deposited Tony into the big bed.
Steve’s eyes flicked to the laptop screen. The two men were moving into position to fuck, the dark haired one was on his back and welcomed his partner into his arms and his body. Tony turned around and looked at it when he saw Steve was looking.
Pepper had hated the Arc Reactor and made him wear a shirt when they had sex or when they slept together. She said it was the light, but Tony was pretty sure it was simply that it was there.
Steve was in Tony’s bed almost every night and Tony still managed to keep either his t-shirt or his tank top on. He never mentioned it to Steve and Steve never mentioned taking the shirt off.
“How would I do that?”
Tony stopped dead in his tracks. “You serious?” he asked, but he knew the answer. He’d never seen such a scared look on anyone’s face.
Steve kissed Tony. “Did I detect a little note of superiority in J.A.R.V.I.S.’ answer?”
Tony spoke out loud “J.A.R.V.I.S., lock him back in his bed when he returns.”
Tony knew that Romanov had been teaching Steve to use the internet. She’d gotten Tony to give him a new SI tablet when he’d moved in here at the Tower. He grinned to himself, wondering if his new colleague had found porn yet. Did they even have porn when Steve was a kid? Would Steve have even looked at it?
“Don’t you have anything better to do than watch me fiddle with stuff?” Tony asked him one day.
Steve answered yes before he thought. He cleaned himself up a bit and went to see what Tony had in mind. At this point in time, he wasn’t sure if he was more frustrated at Tony’s porn links or at the idea that he wanted to do those things with Tony.
Rogers knew that his apartment was at the back of the smithy and workshop, but he’d never been in Stark’s personal living quarters.
“Mind if I sit?” It was Steve.
As soon as they were inside the apartment, Tony pulled Steve into his arms and they kissed. This time, it was much more than a peck and much less awkward than their first kiss as Tony felt Steve’s tongue touch his lips. He parted them, inviting Steve to deepen the kiss.
“You keep that up and you won’t have to ride.”
He downed his second shot.
“Gonna take me home, sheriff?” Tony asked at closing time, slurring his words a little as if he were quite drunk.
Steve hugged him close again. “Together.”
“What? he asked.
“I do.”
Every time Tony put on the suit, something happened to the cooling system and he ended up being roasted alive in the damned thing. Once out, he usually stripped his underwear off as fast as he could so he didn’t simply die from the heat.
Steve slipped on an undershirt and the pants he worked out in and followed Tony onto the elevator.
Tony nodded. He already knew that Steve was going to be the only one he wanted in his bed for a long while. He only hoped that Steve felt the same way.
“No. Not yet. Go for a walk with me?” Steve’s tone changed completely. It was friendly, companionable. “Grab a cup at Strong Brew?”
“You or Iron Man?”
He was, drinking from a glass tonight. That was unusual. Tony looked over at him and nodded hello. Did he really not remember their night together? Was it possible?
“I came to see if you were all right. You broke a coffee cup and ran.”
He let his mind run free as his hand moved. He thought about Bucky and Peggy and then he thought about Tony Stark. What would it feel like to have that hand slide down his belly? Would Tony jerk him off? Or would he want more?
Steve kissed him for several more minutes before he moved down to where Tony’s cock stood quite erect below the hem of his t-shirt. He got comfortable between Tony’s opened legs and began to lick and suck him. The first licks were experimental, a lap here and a taste there until Tony was quivering beneath him.
Rogers shook his head and ordered a cup of coffee.
Steve grabbed the lube and flipped the top, pouring some on his hand and reaching behind himself as he knelt beside the sofa. Tony watched in the near darkness as Steve fingered his own ass. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen anything so damned hot, even if he couldn’t see any details.
“I need to get some sleep, too.”
“Tell me a story. I like bedtime stories.”
helpful, isn’t it?”
He texted Tony.
When Davey Jones mentioned the Kraken, Steve laughed so hard that he almost fell off the sofa. Tony was right there with him, though he recovered a little faster. Clint knew he’d never be able to rest now until he knew the joke.
Tony turned his attention to Steve, dragging his eyes from the men on the screen. “Oh? You and Barnes?”
“Nah. Come up to the penthouse. I got some good stuff there.”
“We both probably could probably have found a better town,” Stark aid with a laugh. “This one is not exactly paradise.”
“Yeah, well, shit happens,” Tony said, offhandedly, as if it didn’t matter and they both knew it mattered much more than Tony could ever admit.
Tony laughed and rolled over closer to him. “You have no idea!”
Steve finished shaving him and dried his face. When Steve started to leave, Tony said, “Don’t go.”
After dinner, he was in his workshop when Steve came barreling through the doors. “Are you trying to embarrass me to death?” he asked Tony.
Steve dutifully tried them on.
Steve was still on top of Tony after they’d finished and were catching their breath.
Even later still, they did finally dress and made fresh coffee to go in their Strong Brew cups. They put their coffees on the table by the door and kissed one more time before leaving their love nest.
“I’ll just see you inside, then I’ll go,” Steve told him.
After dinner, Tony pulled out his flask and poured a generous amount into his coffee cup. “Want some?” he offered Steve.
Tony laughed and sent him a link to a clip with the redhead, the blond man and a dark-haired man.
“Well, remember last year when you and I went to that place upstate for the weekend and we never left our room?  Remember that Iron Man was on television when we got back, having rescued a child from a well?”
Steve wanted to hug him and kiss him but he hesitated. And the moment passed.
“I’m fixing to kiss you,” Tony told him.
“When?” Tony asked him in the elevator.
They’d made love, both of them in tears the whole time and they’d parted in such sadness when Tony had finally left, both of them knowing that nothing had really changed except they still loved one another.
The next day, dark grey boxer briefs appeared and Steve modeled them for Tony, with the same end results. A red speedo followed with delicious benefits.  Black briefs came next and after the complimentary fuck, Tony asked Steve which ones he preferred.
He hadn’t said anything else to Rogers. What was there to say? He’d said it all when he got home. He was surprised that Steve didn’t seem angry. He would have been. Hell, he was still angry.
Tony shook his head. “We’re the same guy, Rogers. That’s the rub. I can’t separate them anymore.”
“Thanks. My hands are a little too shaky to take a razor to my face yet.”
Tony picked at an invisible something on his sleeve and made his way out of the bathroom before he embarrassed himself.
“I’m here, aren’t I?” Steve answered in a near whisper.
“I can shave myself. I just need to take it slowly.”
“I’m afraid so. The idiot doesn’t get that I’d never let someone else take my place in his bed.”
“Wear the Iron Man boxers just for me?” Tony said, brown eyes big and begging.
He followed Tony to the quarters he’d taken when he moved back in. There was the usual Tony stuff, bits and pieces of all sorts of machines all over the coffee table along with a few toy ponies and an Iron Man costume for a small kid hanging on the inside of the door. Morgan’s things.
Steve’s hands were shaking when he pulled his fingers free and rubbed some of the lubricant on himself. He wasn’t sure he’d ever wanted anyone this badly. He wasn’t sure he’d ten seconds either. “Turn over, I want to see your face.”
They were walking into Avengers Tower a few minutes later, coffee cups in hand. “Have everyone meet in the conference room in an hour and we’ll talk about Whitney,” Tony told Steve. “And thanks for the coffee. I’ll get the next one.”
Steve sat in the saloon and watched Tony drink. He smiled. He’d drag him home in a bit and maybe Tony would sing
“Mornin’, Sheriff. Can I buy you a coffee?”
Tony entered Steve slowly, and even then, he worried about losing control completely and coming as soon as he began.  As he always did, Steve pulled him down for a kiss, a long lingering kiss.
it’s malfunctioning. I just don’t know how yet.”
Tony shifted a little beneath him and they kissed again. Steve felt the pressure begin to build low in his body. He closed his eyes, concentrating. He didn’t want to lose control quite yet.
Tony held his left hand out to Steve, palm down. He spoke, his voice low, almost a whisper. “Not sure it’ll fit, but yeah, you can give it to me.”
“Damn suit is overheating and I get so fucking hot that I feel like I’m roasting every time I put it on.”
“I – I’ve thought about kissing you, too, truth be told.”
He started to get up, but Stark held onto him. “Not yet. Just stay here until I catch my breath.”
Steve nodded. “I did.”
Underwear started appearing on Steve’s side of the bed, laid out nice and neat, just waiting to be tried on. The first was, of course, a pair of white boxers with tiny red hearts. Beside that pair was one with tiny red and gold Iron Man heads on them.
Both Starks went in the door to Steve’s quarters.
“I asked JARVIS to make your suit a little warm, but never warm enough to cause you any harm.”
Tony made his way to the penthouse. He tried not to think too much about what had just happened, but he had Rogers’ scent all over him. Damn the gorgeous sonofabitch! He had stayed away from him for that very reason.
After the smoke cleared, Tony turned to Steve and said, “What do you want to do now? Try again?”
“Yeah. What does a man your age do for fun? Shuffleboard? Checkers?”
“To chase away the ghosts. When I close my eyes, the ghosts come for me. Drunk, I pass out and they stay away.”
He slept fitfully in his little bed up over the jail. He dreamed of those deep blue eyes and those rough blacksmith’s hands touching him. He tossed and turned all night.
“Come on, Steve,” Tony said, trying to sound cajoling, but he was sure he just sounded whiny.
“Sure, why not? I can lift a house and you can fly. Why wouldn’t she think we could bake a cake?” Steve said, putting an arm around Tony and kissing that little bit of batter off of his nose.
“Because I’ve wanted to ever since the day you and Barnes came riding into Timely.”
“Will it protect me?”
He’d looked into Stark, writing to contacts back east, who told him that Stark had been a major weapons supplier in the Civil War until some of his guns had been used in a massacre of Southern troops. Stark had shut down his company and cancelled all his government contracts. Some said he’d lost his mind.
He’d moved as far from New York as he could after the battle. He poured money into the cleanup, but he didn’t want to see any of it. That was why he had his heart fixed, so he would not be reminded of his fear every time he took his shirt off.
“You don’t need to.” Tony came into the room, crossing to where Steve sat on his bed. He motioned to Steve’s lap. “Did I cause that?”
“I’ve got towels,” was all Stark said as he threw several silver coins onto the bar and headed toward the double doors.
And all Steve could think about was licking that bit of batter from the end of Tony’s nose.
“Oh fuck, Tony!” Steve growled and put one hand on the back of Tony’s head. “I need to fuck your mouth.”
“Any time you’re ready, we can do that.”
Tony found that words failed him and he pressed his hips upward and nodded. Steve slipped his mouth down over Tony, taking him so deep that Tony felt the back of his mouth as Steve swallowed just before starting to move his head up and down, cradling the underside of Tony’s cock with his tongue. The suction was light at first as Steve licked him until he was wet and slick then Tony felt Steve suck as he licked.
‘You’ve done it. Before me, in the war.’
“Button it J, you are on time out.”
“Zach let your Mamma sleep some more.” Steve said, “We’ll go and make some pancakes and then we’ll shower, put on sunscreen, and go to the beach. Your Mamma can join us later.”
Steven Grant Rogers, Captain America, the First Avenger.
The sudden rush of flavours from the lamb Rogan Josh brought tears to his eyes and he had take several sips of soda to cool his tongue before continuing to eat, however, once he got past the heat of the spice the found the dish to be delicious and complimented by the rice, the vegetable side dishes, and the nann bread.
“I’m not gonna let go,” Steve promised straining his muscles, pulling Tony up enough for the Billionaire to get hold of the landing pad, he then wrapped his arms about Tony’s torso and hauled him up and back onto the safety of the pad.
“What archery range?” Clint whined sounding like a five year old being denied a treat.
The crew filmed the team as they engaged a couple of rounds of capture the flag, they split into two teams, Steve, Sam, and Clint on team A, and Tony, Thor, and Natasha on team B.
Strangely enough it was Zach’s screams of horror as his back erupted into flames that kept Tony from giving into panicking. Feeling rather like he was having an out of body experience, Tony got down to one knee and set Zach down on the ground urging him away before he saw to his own health and rolled over onto his back smothering out the flames and cringing as his raw skin stung and ached.
“But I could do it real good.” Zach protested, “I would eat pancakes and ice cream all day!”
“I told you not to.” Peter sighed.
*****
He’d come to associate hospitals with nothing but misery since his Mother’s death and so far this new century hadn’t changed that view. He supposed it might change if and when he had a child with Tony, then they would be in a hospital for a good and happy reason, not one filled with fear.
Peter looked desperately at Steve, silently begging him for confirmation.
“Master Zach’s condition is the same as it was, but his behaviour is proving difficult for Sir to cope with alone, especially since the young master has managed to cover his Mother and the bathroom in damp oats.”
“Bite me you sarcastic bundle of servers and coding.”
Anything that would have been underfoot had been moved out of the way, discounting the cats who eyes the wheelchair with suspicion of squashed tails and turned their backs in disgust or hissed menacingly at the bots who found them fascinating, much to the cats annoyance, yet no amount of hissing, spitting, growling, or snarling could dissuade the demented trio from trying to make friends with the felines.
“But shouldn’t I feel something, some pain for her not being here, not getting to see her Grandsons?” Tony asked, “But the truth is I hardly care. I’m more thankful that Howard is not here to hurt them than that she never got to see them.”
"Only if Pete brings MJ." I shoot back quickly. "Plus I think they'll like him."
"Tyler." Steve tries to explain but I ignore him and give Bucky a final hug.
17. Knock before you come into our room.
"Umm guys." Pete's voice breaks through the room. I look over to where the sound came from. He's stuck. On the fucking ceiling.
"You didn't have to get her anything." I smile.
"Yeah I should be. Pepper said it would be easy so it's a good starting point. You coming?"
"It's not much, but you can decorate it however you like." I tell her. She doesn't respond for a while until a sob breaks the silence.
"Tyler come on, Happy's waiting." I jump into the car next to my brother and try to hold back a laugh as he puts the separator up straight away to block out my brother's babbling.
"Aunt Nat? Uncle Clint?" I call out as I walk through the hall, getting closer to the living room.
"But what if he changes his mind?"
As soon as we arrive back at the house, I attempt to escape up the stairs in order to avoid the confrontation by my parents but it doesn't work.
"They need to see what they're doing to you little bird. You can't carry on like this. And if Tony and Steve don't get their act together, your mom isn't the only one they'll be fighting in court." I feel paralyzed. He continues to pull me along as his words sink in.
"Picture. For you." I grin at her words.
"No, Ty I didn't mean it like that." I cut him off.
"Anytime kiddo, I had fun, look after Tasha for me." We ride the elevator down to the garage and hop into Natasha's black convertible, pulling the roof down because it's warm outside.
"Nope." The older woman rolls her eyes at me but moves on anyway. Wade leans over to me.
"I told Lauren to get out of the way. Did I stutter Melody?" That's it. I throw myself onto him, throwing jabs and uppercuts, elbows and forearms. I hear a satisfying crack which tells me that I broke his nose. I jump off him and wipe the blood that was running down my face from the one or two hits he got in. I turn to my brother who was rocking back and forth on the floor. The closer I got I was able to hear what he was mumbling under his breath.
"The couch Traitor!!!" I ponder her proposition. 'They're going to find out either way so why not?'
"It's the thing that I am brother." Loki answers looking directly at me, smiling slightly.
"Okay. Please step through and scan your badge." Arron demonstrates, holding his badge to the screen.
Ven does little puppet shows
"I missed you Song."
Forever and always,
"Tony, you're the love of my life. I could not ask for a better husband. I love you and I promise to prove that to you every day. You have made my life so much better by just being in it. You're an amazing lover and an even better dad. I love you and I love those kids and I promise to forever. You've got me crying now Stark." Everyone lets out a tear filled chuckle.
Happy birthday to you!!" All of them start singing the well-known song way off key. In front of me is a chocolate traybake cake which takes up practically the width of the table. It read 'happy birthday Tyler' in the centre with all of my individual nicknames around the edges.
'Shit.' I think to myself. 'I called him Papa? To his face? Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.' Me and Pete had a long ass conversation about what we would call them if it got that far and we
18. If you have a problem tell us.
"Two years ago, I was ready to die. I had nothing. My mother left me when I was 3, I was abused for years, the only family I had where I met Peter died eventually. I didn't see a reason to live. And then these two men came along. Part of the Avengers. The earth's defenders. I thought it wouldn't last. That they'd soon realise that they were too busy protecting the Earth to deal with an emotionally scarred teenager. But they proved me wrong. They fixed me. I was the broken toy sitting on the top shelf in the play room that the kids didn't want to play with. I was the defective typewriter that was only good for show. The girl that was never given a second chance. But they didn't see me like that. Most of you heard what they said in court. I was the girl that was being chocked to death and didn't care. I was accepting my fate. Ever since they took us home, I've not felt like that. I'm not the second choice anymore; I'm the first. I'm not just some random kid with no family. I have parents, a brother, aunts and uncles galore. I have a family. I belong to someone. And you have no idea how long I've waited to be a part of something. Something bigger than a club or a fandom. I've dreamt of having a family since I was young. I always thought it would be my mom, a dad and I, maybe a few younger siblings but never in a million years did I imagine this. Yet I wouldn't trade them for the world." I stop for a moment to catch my breath, wiping away a few stray tears.
Zach immediately sat up straighter and reached for his ice cream swiftly gobbling it up and getting stains all over his mouth as he did so.
“Mamma!”
Steve nodded, if the worst that came out of this was a headache then they could consider themselves lucky. He stroked Peter’s hair wishing the boy would wake up, wished Zach were with them, wished Tony was with them and none of this nightmare had happened.
“I think we’re pretty much agreed we’re doing this.” Tony said once he’d stopped laughing, “J, launch the cleaner bots in the villa and order groceries for us, we’ll fly out Thursday evening, clear my schedule until Monday Morning.”
“Right.” Steve’s reply was mechanical, he was barely functioning, was just holding himself together by sheer stubbornness, that was all that was keeping the shock at bay. He’d just seen his best friend, be attacked by him, and the man hadn’t even known who he was himself let alone who Steve was.
A growl rattled in Steve’s chest, and he moved to add his own bulk to the protective shield Tony was creating for Lily, and by doing so, protected Tony too.
Tony looked up and spat blood at her, “For you and him. Personally, I can barely remember anything, being sky high on coke and tanked up on booze tends to make things a bit hazy.” He gave her a mirthless smile, “I assume we fucked, or did you guys just tie me up and fuck besides me while I slept it off, because for the life of me, I can’t remember a fucking thing.”
“Very well, I’ll let your partner and children in to see you.”
Steve wasn’t sure if he was joking or not. MJ was a nice if slightly terrifying girl that Tony was pretty sure Peter had a crush on. Steve thought Peter was a bit young for crushes, but was reminded by Tony that he was a teenager now, crushes on girls and boys was to be expected. It was just another reminder that Peter was growing up, way too fast as far as Steve was concerned. It didn’t seem any time had passed at all since he was first sitting on a sofa in the mansion watching Doctor who with Peter and Zach, but now Peter was adolescent and getting interested in girls.
“Which is?” Fury asked.
Unable to speak Tony offered him a smile, wondering when this heaviness and numbness would wear off.
“The doctor told you.” Steve said reading Tony’s expression.
Giving him another grin Steve set off, catching up with the others quickly, leaving Tony to sunbathe and Bruce to enjoy his book.
“We can try again.” He offered weakly but Tony shook his head,
“Obviously. But you can get out of the country, liquidate your assets and put the money in a caymans account so it cannot be frozen.” Ross explained, “I would urge you to do this. You cannot fight the charges and win, but you can make a strategic retreat and regroup, so that the next time you and I go up against these freaks, we win.”
“Uh huh, well you should be ashamed of yourself, make yourself run an extra lap to make up for it.”
Tony had been to Paris several times before in his life, but never with Steve Roger's at his side and some how the City of Love became new and far more romantic when he had Steve's hand in his, Steve's broad shoulders pressed against his own, Steve's smiling face looking at him across cafe tables as they ate pastries and drank coffee from mugs deep enough to swim in. Or Steve's lips over his own as fireworks had exploded over head as the year became 2014.
“I’ll be back soon.” Steve said, giving Tony a peck on his cheek and hurriedly headed out of the lab to see to Lily.
*****
“That won’t happen.” Clint stated firmly, he stood up taller and pulled his shoulders back, “If I have to I’ll go rogue and kill any fucker that tries to take the kids.”
“This what you get for sleeping in.” Steve teased, he came and crouched besides Tony, a cup of coffee in his hands. The nectar was just inches away but it may as well have been miles, Ton gazed longingly at the cup and gave Steve his best beseeching look.
Tony gave a choked noise in his throat and Steve held onto him tighter, half carrying him to the waiting room where the teacher sprang up from her seat. With a startled "Mr Stark, Captain Rogers!"
“You just like the rest, an illusion, it’s not real!” Tony insisted, screwing his eyes shut again as if to deny Steve’s presence all the more, “You’re not real, you’re not here.”
Tony groaned dramatically when Steve came back from the morning runs just as he was dragging himself from his bed to begin his morning argument with Zack about not having blueberry pancakes everyday.
Bruce wrapped his hands about Zach’s back afraid he would fall if he didn’t, he glanced up at Happy hoping that the man would come to his aid, but Happy was in an argument with Peter over ordering Pizza.
“I don’t care.” Steve replied mercilessly working his way through the soldiers, “So long as they and Tony are healthy.”
Steve frowned at Tony, “Patriotic?”
“How’s it going big guy?” Ned asked.
“Fine,” He snapped, “Take him, but tell them only that he is ill, say nothing of the serum Maria, or I swear I will make you regret it.”
Still feeling full they decided to take a walk around Manhattan before dishing up dessert and settling down to watch some movies in front of the TV, and of course, the Doctor Who Christmas Special.
How could this mewling wretch be perfect? He cried constantly, pissed and shit himself ten or twelve times a day, wouldn’t settle, screamed with colic. He was already showing his weakness, the weakness that Howard would eliminate from him.
“No archery range for you.” Tony sing songed going to the sink and getting paper towels to clean himself down with, he tossed the roll to Zach to do the same and glared at U as he trod on a banana, “Pick up duty is yours.” He instructed the bot who beeped mournfully, “Oh don’t give me that, you know better than this and I don’t care if Butterfingers was pressuring you, and don’t think you are getting out of this either.” He said pointing at the mop wielding bot, “Get mopping, I want this place clean and tidy.”
“Yeah sweet, now get this crap off me.” MJ complained tugging at the webbing on her coat, “This had better come off Parker-Stark or you are so dead.”
“We should dress Cap up in his old uniform and make him to the song and dance.” Tony mused turning his head the other way.
“Tony, I don’t mean to pry, but… when was the last time you bled?” May asked.
“Sweet dreams.” She whispered, placing a soft kiss on his cheek.
“Yeah, tell me about.” Tony scoffed sipping ale.
For seven long days and nights Peter remained unconscious and fighting for his life. Then finally as dawn was breaking on the eighth day his eyes opened and he began to cough and splutter around the tube in his throat.
*****
“Sure.”
“There was an explosion here, an army guy, Chad Davies, he went nuts and blew himself up.”
I’m thrilled that so much has changed and I want to tell people about it, but I worry that if I mention it at all then they’ll think I’m being mocking or am lying or something when I’m not, and gay marriage! People went to prison for homosexual relationships in my day, or were considered insane and thrown into asylums, yet now we have Pride parades in New York!”
“What’s wrong?” Peter asked, “Mamma what’s wrong?” Oh God, why did it have to hurt so much?
“Do you think you could make a suit in spandex in time for Lydia’s party?” Ned mused, “That’d be epic, and do you think your Mamma will let you borrow one of his cars, imagine the three of us rolling up in a Ferrari!”
“Sure boss.”
“He gets bullied?” Steve asked, slipping into Captain America mode, “Maybe we should pay a visit to his school, help steer the younger generation on the right path.”
“I’m not either.” Tony said testing what inner muscle control he had, the sensations were still uncertain and his muscles hadn’t had any use in months but if the way Steve groaned and bucked his hips was anything to go by things were still working and he was thrusting with unerring accuracy, hitting Tony’s sweet spot with every thrust inside him.
“I’m afraid there has been an incident involving the Avengers.” The principal said, “I have not been given the details only that one of your parents has been seriously injured and Miss Potts is on her way to collect you and then your Brother and take you to a hospital in Prague where they are being treated.”
“I’ll explain on the way home, Honey.”
Sam snorted at the bantering while Wanda scowled at the creature, “I can’t feel it, I can’t see anything. Its mind is completely closed to me.” She said.
“How did he survive?” Bruce asked, “He should have bled to death from his aorta alone.” Steve shot him a dark look but it was Fury who spoke.
“Unca Phil!” Zach cried, jumping up and running over to fling his arms about Coulson’s thighs in a hug.
“Nothing” Tony lied, forcing a smile, and he squirmed, bucking his hips to encourage Steve to continue. It might not be the way he wanted it to be, but at least he would get to be with Steve and he wasn’t about to let such an opportunity pass him by just because he was not the Tony that Steve wished he was.
Well, no one could argue with that and soon enough two more snow men joined Mr Frosty. A Miss Chilled who had a bright pink scarf about her throat, and her metal stick hands had been spray painted red to look like fingernails. She also had a red sock rolled up to form a lipstick smile, and some artificial pink flowers placed over her head like an Alice band, that Natasha gave to Zach, which had come free with a bath salts collection. The last Snow man was called Kool, (Named by Clint) He had a tie from Tony’s closet tied about his head as if he were wearing a bandana, a paint stained bed sheet that Steve had bought from a rags bin in a charity shop to use to wipe his paint brushes on, tied about his neck like a funky scarf, and Clint rolled up a length of silver foil and pushed it in the side of the snow mans mouth making it look like he was smoking a joint!
“Come Camp Crystal Lake, you’ll have a wonderful time, you can swim, climb the trees, and get disembowelled by Jason Vorhees or his deranged mother!”
Tony sniffed and nodded, wiping his eyes and let out a shaky breath, “I need to call the Rug-rat, I owe that emotional manipulator.”
“Great, I’ll use his extinguisher on Natasha’s fire.” Steve drawled, somehow picturing Clint with yellow feathers tweeting as he spoke, and the thought of Tony in a corset should not be turning him on so much, not when he had already come.
“What’s happening?” Natasha asked as she assumed the co-pilot seat with Clint in the pilot seat.
Peter looked to Steve for an explanation. The Captain sighed running a hand over his face, “Zach heard something that your Mamma would rather he hadn’t. About his Father.”
“Who?”
As he finished his ice cream and made sure he couldn’t scrape anymore out of it, Clint stretched out on his towel. “So, what are we doing tomorrow, the same as today?”
“Look after them!” Steve yelled to Sam and Thor, meaning Zach and Peter, then he too dove under the water just as Clint surfaced laughing. His laughter died when he saw the expressions on Thor and Sam’s faces.
Were it possible Bruce would have choked on his own tongue. Zach frowned again, “Mamma said that Pups and Babies grow in Mamma’s tummies and that Daddies put them in there. He says that the Daddy plants a seed inside Mamma that grows into a baby or a pup, but he didn’t say how the seed gets in there, how does it get there?” terrifyingly expectant eyes turned on Bruce and the Doctor balked.
“I wasn’t conscious you know?” He said giving Tony a half smile that didn’t reach his eyes, “I was knocked out the second I hit the water, I didn’t feel any of it, not really, there was a rush of water and then that was it until I waking up in that Shield farce of 1945. But in my dreams I’m awake, I’m stuck there in that chair, my body frozen to the spot, unable to breathe, to blink, to do anything but sit there like a statue, a statue of ice.” Steve shuddered and clutched his cup harder, “It hurts, in my dreams it hurts, the cold, the lack of air, it hurts so much. Its like…”
“Okay? Dude this is the most awesome and cool thing ever!” Ned exclaimed. Peter made an inarticulate noise in his throat and leaped at Ned, the two of them falling over the sofa in a hug. MJ huffed and rolled her eyes at the pair.
“What, I thought he was at his friends.” Sam asked.
*****
He hardly heard Rhodey and Vision’s farewells, or Pepper’s promise to return in the morning, he stumbled in a mindless haze to his bedroom, his knees almost giving out before he reached the bed, but Steve wrapped an arm about his waist, supporting him and helped him reach the bed.
“We’re going to see a friend.” Sharon said.
“Well you don’t have the right do that, Stark,” Wanda sneered, “You’re not an Avenger anymore,” her smug smirk did not last for long, as Tony, steeled himself and glared at her,
As Natasha packed up, Clint moved the chairs out of the way so Jarvis could come in and set up the camera and monitor screen, getting them to focus on Tony.
“Come on kid, where are you?” Tony muttered scanning through the schematics. He could see plenty of heat signatures that were running through the place, a great gathering of others, some lower and some higher than the usual bio reading, they were not moving so Tony figured they were animals/hybrids.
“Sir, I have a list of persons who have taken leave of absence or resigned.” Jarvis piped up, “I have taken the liberty of discounting those whose reasons were genuine.”
“Aye!” Thor declared and swooped down to smash Mjolnir into the nearest cannon shattering the metal with a single blow and then crushing the bunker as the soldiers scrambled to get away from him.
The Chitauri fell to the ground, the leviathan crashing down, their connection to the Mothership severed.
“Sounds good to me.” Rhodey agreed,
“You don’t?” he asked her,
When he turned he saw Steve standing in the doorway, grinning at him, “What?” He asked, bringing Lily back down to his chest,
Hmm, Tony drew Thor to one side and reminded him not to let Zach have too many s’mores, not after the brownies and ice cream. The last thing he wanted was Zach getting sick from a sugar overload.
Natasha delivered a chop to her agents wind pipe, snatched his knives from their sheeths and with a whirl of her arms, slashed his throat, spun around and threw the knives with deadly accuracy, hitting and killing to of the agents behind them.
“Baby I nearly lost you.” Steve said squeezing his hands, “For over twelve hours I thought you would die. I imagined the worst, that I would have to say goodbye to you, the fact that you are alive and coherent is more than enough for me.” Steve took a shaky breath and Tony saw that his eyes were brimming with tears too, “I know this sucks, I know that you are scared and I would be too, but you are so strong Tony, I know you will get through this, that we will get through this. You being able to walk or not doesn’t matter, hell I’ve got super strength, I can carry you everywhere if needs be!”
“Then don’t challenge me.” Norman said. He sighed at seeing his son’s unhappy expression, “We’ll deal with the brat and his bitch Mother. First lets get the lawsuit dropped, then we can look into getting justice for you.”
Okay he might have been a little crazy in taking the racing car for a spin in Monaco, but honestly, who could blame him? He did have blood poisoning and he thought watching his Mamma race would be something Zach would enjoy when he was older.
“Screw you!” Zach yelled back sounding just like Tony.
“I’m sorry, Director.” Steve apologized, rubbing the back of his neck and looked embarrassed since more than half the order of supplies were for him.
However, the insecure thoughts did not linger in Tony’s mind, one look at the adoration in Steve’s eyes and the very hard reminder at his thigh was clear enough indication of what Steve’s thoughts were in regards to his body.
“This is my fuck up Steve.” He said, “I did this,”
For the second time that night Clint was cleaning his sinuses with coffee, Sam appeared to be having a coughing fit, Bruce was biting his bottom lip, and even Grace looked amused.
Once they were all secured the pilots soon got clearance and took off, the flight attendants coming around with drinks and snacks and setting up the TV with The Hobbit for them all to watch throughout the flight.
“You are not going to get killed.” Steve said getting out of the car and heading around to the boot to get the equipment out.
“You killed her parents!” This was said in desperate, almost petulant tone. As if Rogers was scraping at the very bottom of the barrel for some way to win this argument.
Presents were passed around, with people trading thank you, and scolding others (Tony) over spending so much, but hey, what was a set of matching Diamond earrings, necklace, and bracelet to a billionaire?
Despite their differences the team worked seamlessly, even if Hulk did punch Thor for some reason, Nat managed to get to Doctor Selvig who’d suffered a blow to the head and had the mind control knocked out of him, between them they managed to find a way to shut the portal down, except their was a Nuke coming in.
“Could it be tonsillitis?” Steve asked recalling getting that very often as a boy, “What about measles or mumps?” He was taken aback by Bruce scowl, these were common ailments during his childhood.
Peter wore a pair of Hawaiian trunks and had a short sleeved cotton shirt on, undone but serving as a cover up for the sun when he wasn’t swimming. Zach was in a pair of Avengers themed trunks with a Captain America t-shirt and was practically jumping up and down in excitement. To stop him from running straight into the sea, Steve carried Zach on his shoulders down to the beach and made sure to keep hold of him until everyone was settled. Only then did he take Zach down into the sea.
To share the burden, Clint and Bruce exited the Limo together and stood side by side with stiff smiles before joining the others, where they stood for a few group photos then headed up into City Hall.
"Where's the fire?" He laughed good naturedly, only for his humour to dry when he saw Tony's ashen face, "What's happened?"
“Pepper, she knows about this?” Steve was livid now, his face was red and the veins in his forehead were popped.
“Little soldiers?” Tony offered with a wry smile, “Yeah that’s not a bad idea, we should both get checked out first, make sure everything is as it should be. Although if there is anything wrong then it most likely will be with me.”
"Her name is Morgan. Do you want to see her?"
"What's the surprise?" someone had yelled after Steve had finished his answer.
Steve looks fine, but the serum would have healed him. Thor is a demi-god, and Tony doesn't know a Spider-Man and if he can heal like them or not. But what about Rhodey and Pepper? And why was Pepper in the battle? Not that he's surprised—she's always been courageous—but she was never interested in suiting up.
"Girl, just don't."
Steve shakes his head, still looking like someone punted his puppy, but after a long moment, he looks at the device and prompts, "Make a gauntlet."
Tony nods. "Understandable. Difficult to do, though."
God, Tony loves him so much.
"Call Pepper. She can put SI's legal team on it and spin the situation. Carol, if there's any sign of the Krees, I want to know."
"Yeah, okay," he agrees, which makes Steve smile.
"I was thinking of parking behind the moon and doing recon at Avengers tower. Who knows what happened in the last two years."
