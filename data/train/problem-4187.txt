In the meantime, the Beta Councilmen were going to do some preparations of their own in order to get ready for their impromptu expedition. Also, on a request from Dean, they would contact Ellen, from the kitchen he had been assigned to that morning, and let her know what was going on: that the remainder of Dean's community service would be completed assisting Benny and Jody.
The Omega nurse then took Dean's temperature and his blood pressure, all of which were automatically recorded on the screen. Then, the nurse asked Dean to roll up the sleeve on his other arm so he could swipe an alcohol-soaked cotton swab on Dean's arm. Dean braced himself as a needle was sunk into his flesh and a sample of his blood was stolen (or collected, or whatever) and stored in a tiny vial.
Okay what the hell happened? The thought crossed Cas's mind, but before he got a chance to comment on the change in Alfie's demeanor, the room provided them with the requested shower. It appeared in the corner to the left of where Cas was still sitting. The silently swirling water flowing upwards, just like before.
“You mean these glowing things under our skin?” Dean asked, raising his wrist to show the three vertical dots, steadily pulsing beneath his skin.
make.” Uriel no longer looked bored. In fact, if Benny didn't know any better, he'd say the male Alpha looked positively
Benny checked the watch on his wrist then announced, “I've gotta make a few calls.” He turned back to Dean and Cas as he stood up and said, “I'll be seein' you fellas around, alright? Things'll settle down for ya and you'll feel much better about everything soon.” As he was leaving, he paused to plant a gentle kiss to the side of Charlie's head, then he took off at a brisk pace, leaving the others to watch his back as he retreated.
Dean closed the door behind her and walked back to the couch, but he didn't sit. Instead, he just stood in the middle of the living room, eyes on the window display. The gathering clouds had grown even darker as the two Omegas had spoken, now the rain threatened to fall once again.
“No problem. You guys have a good night.” With that the Beta turned and left, going in the opposite direction that Alistair had gone.
“I have no clue,” Cas answered as he continued lavishing kisses to Dean's neck and shoulder as well, “but
“Are you feeling better, Dean?” Cas asked after a few more minutes. Everyone had calmed down, spirits seeming higher and there was chatting and teasing all around them.
He had the birth of his and Cas's pups to look forward to. Five children would be a handful, but he was sure they could manage it together, and with the help of their community. He was looking forward to meeting Sam's kids too. Gabe and Eileen were sure to get knocked up too. The prospect of having a horde of nieces and nephews excited him almost as much as having his own pups.
“I'm so, so sorry,” Cas whispers, his hips starting to move faster as he fucks into Dean with less reserve, starting to lose the battle with his own will power.
Cas took another deep breath. “They removed the bullet and sewed you up. You had lost just enough blood for your pressure to drop rapidly, which is why you passed out, but you didn't lose quite enough to require a transfusion.” He took a deep, steadying breath, the Omega's rich scent doing wonders. “You were very lucky, Dean. And our pups. We were able to check on them, and they seem to be just fine.”
hungry he was until he saw the smorgasbord), they were both still understandably wary of the mystery food that had suddenly appeared before them. There were platters of fruits and veggies, others piled high with burgers, boiled eggs, sausages, bacon, others had an assortment of breads and cheeses, and another was heaped full of miniature pies!
“Hey, hey now. I'm sorry for yelling, okay? I'm just worried about my... my mate? Is that what you called him?”
But first, he needed to meet a guy named Caleb. Dean followed a mixture of posted signs and verbal instructions from people he passed on the way before finally reaching the garage. He pushed open the huge, steel door, which swung open quietly on well-oiled hinges, and took a look around the place. The place he'd be working when he finally got his official job assignment.
Benny laughed, “No, no. I commissioned it from some folks in the construction and maintenance crews.”
had a bit of racism in them, in one form or another, even if they didn't realize it. Same goes for sexism, homophobia, and all the other prejudices that were learned from our families, past experiences and from society in general.”
“Most of his mates hated him and his children will be better off without his influence,” Cas argued.
Cas suppressed a chuckle. The other man could be downright adorable at times. “Now that you mention it...” Cas trailed off, sighing looking back up at the ceiling.
“Why is-” Castiel began. He had to pause in order to swallow the lump that threatened to choke him. “Why isn't he awake?”
It didn't take much longer for Cas's swelling to go down enough for him to withdraw from Dean's used and leaking hole. Once they were separated, Cas stood up, reaching back down to help Dean stand as well. Once they were both vertical, Dean gently ran his fingers over the mark he left in Cas's skin, admiring his handiwork, as Cas apparently did the same. A smile slowly spread its way across both of their faces until they were grinning at each other like idiots.
Dean and Cas exchanged a look, not sure if they should fully reveal their hand yet, or if they should wait it out and see what happens.
“Play it again,” Benny said quietly. He barely dared to believe what he'd just seen. Jody complied and the video played once again.
Once they broke apart, Cas picked up the pace again. Dean groaned and reached for his throbbing dick once more, only to be stopped by Castiel. Dean whined at the unfairness of it as Cas pinned both of this arms above his head, leaning over Dean so that their eyes were locked together. Cas never looked away and Dean didn't dare break the gaze.
“Where'd Jody go?” He asked. Marco the five security guards who had been assembled all simultaneously pointed in the direction of the open apartment door. The identical looks of minor fear and confusion on their faces would have been comical if it weren't for the dire nature of the circumstances.
“Alrighty,” the tech said once Dean was situated, “let's get that shirt lifted so we can get at that tummy, hm?”
Amy scoffed and made a noise of mild disgust as she said, “I freaking hate traveling with couples. They always get so gross and clingy as soon as the suits are off.”
Thank you all for sticking with me all this time. It's been nearly three years since I started this and it's been wonderful and terrible, full of starts and seemingly-endless stops. I've gone through periods where I didn't write for months, but I refused to give up. I loved every single comment and praise and even the complaints and criticisms have been welcome (even if they were a bit hurtful atm).
The pair greeted the ultrasound technician with small smiles and tentative handshakes. Dean was suddenly much more nervous than he was just a few minutes ago, but he stealthily kept it hidden. Cas, though, ever vigilant, sensed his mate's uneasiness and steadied him with a calming hand to the small of his back. It went miles into helping calm the Omega's nerves.
Benny carefully guided them up and up and up until Dean started to feel a bit queasy from the constant left turns. Despite that, the Omega was excited and a little bit giddy and had to fight to keep himself from fidgeting nervously. “Are we almost there?” He complained.
“Dean...” Sam started, staring at his brother, his eyes wide and fearful. “Is he...?” Once everything had died down and he was sure his mates were safe, the large Alpha cautiously approached his brother and his brother's distraught mate.
Dean nodded at that, seeming to accept Cas's explanation. “So... is that something you'd like me to do?”
“Well, there's a rock climbing wall in one of the rec rooms that you can use anytime there's an attendant on duty. There are also a few sports teams you can join. They have teams based on both primary and secondary Designations – that is, either male or female, or Alpha, Beta or Omega. So you can either join a male team or an Omega team. There are games every other week and practice weekly. Although
“Benny! Sir! Emergency!” Jody was cut off by a loud banging on the door and frantic pleas coming from the other side.
Cas smiled against Dean's hair and pulled him tighter against his chest. “I love you too, Dean,” he whispered back.
Charlie's face fell a bit when she realized that she did nothing to help soothe the rattled nerves of the pregnant and irate Omega. “Well... multiples are quite common among Omegas. There's a very good chance that you're pregnant with more than one pup.”
The only reason for Amy to go through so much trouble to be on this expedition was if she had something nefarious planned. So Benny ordered a contingent of his own guards to intercept, and Jody added a few of her own to the mix, just to be sure.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean tried. The Alpha must have dozed off too. There wasn't even a grunt from the other man. “Cas!” Dean tried again, this time shrugging his good shoulder to jostle his mate out of his slumber. It seemed to work, since the next moment the Alpha was alert, his eyes darting back and forth in search of a danger that wasn't there.
What do you take us for?” Dean bolted out of his chair, causing it to roll back and smack into the wall, leaving a small dent in the plaster. “Tell us what the hell is really going on here!” He leaned down on the table, supporting his weight with his fists, staring Charlie down.
After a while, when Dean seemed to have calmed down enough, Cas ventured to ask, “So... do you want to tell me what happened while I was gone?” Dean was silent for a while longer. When it became apparent that he wasn't going to answer, Castiel prompted him again. “Dean. What happened?” More silence. “Please, talk to me?” He planted a gentle kiss to the man's head as he continued to stroke his back.
“So, assigning mates,” Charlie began once she'd regained her composure, “simply causes less strife within a community. There's less chance of conflict caused by fighting over mates if everyone already
Cas was having none of that, however, and refused to release his hold. “You did nothing wrong Dean,” the Alpha said as he met Dean's eyes. “You know that, don't you?”
That got their attention. They each snapped their eyes back to the Beta, incredulity clear on their faces.
Castiel was suddenly saturating the air around him and his injured mate in a pheromonal haze of rage and fierce protectiveness. The Alpha was obviously not thinking clearly, or he would have seen that the Beta medic was merely trying to help.
When Castiel apparently takes too long to comply to the command, another searing hot pain jabs through the red dots on his arm and another wave of arousal overcomes him. But he refuses to move from his spot. So, much like Dean's, pulsating cuffs appear on his limbs as well, and they drag him into position over Dean.
Jody, seemingly understanding the man's silent plea for confirmation, drolly said, “Yes. I see him.” She heaved a sigh and looked behind her, back the way she and Benny had came. They really didn't have time for this.
The three of them sat in silence as they waited for the others to join them. Donna pulled out a book to occupy her time, but the Councilmen were woefully unprepared in that regard. After a while, Benny started to get antsy and he wondered where the others were. Their hour was definitely up.
It was much larger than he'd been picturing. There was an extremely long row of stations lining both walls, as far as Dean could see. Each station housed its own vehicle: sedans, vans, trucks, and an assortment of military vehicles, mostly jeeps. Each of the sections were separated by walls of shelves and drawers, each containing an array of tools and various instruments used to repair and maintain the many vehicles housed there. Some of the smaller cars were raised up on platforms so that a mechanic could work underneath. There were plenty of mechanics working, and Dean had to figure out which one was Caleb.
“Cas...” Dean whined as Cas broke the kiss to bury his face in Dean's neck, greedily inhaling his intoxicating aroma. “Cas, I need-
They were everywhere. Going up and down the steps, coming out of doorways further down the lobby, all of them busy and all of them seeming to have someplace to be, something to do, each of them with a different Designation. Alphas, Omegas, and a few Betas each swirling about in a flurry of noises and a buzzing of voices.
Dean scarfed down two of the burgers before tucking into one of the pies and was pleased when he got a mouth full of flaky, buttery crust and gooey cherry filling. The entire time he was eating he continually made little hums and other noises of enjoyment. Cas found it all quite endearing and had to stop himself from staring at the other man in open fascination.
They stayed like that for a few minutes, just enjoying the feel of being wrapped up in each other's arms and scents. After some time of this, Cas stopped his comforting rumbling noises in order to speak with his mate.
“It didn't take much to come to the conclusion that she was working for the Alpha Councilmen. So we had to come up with a different plan, and quick.” Jody took a breath and looked pleadingly at everyone at the table, including Gabriel who had stopped his pacing but still looked livid. “You're right. We planned this poorly. There's so much we could have done differently. And we
“Sure, Cas. I'll be your little spoon.” He chuckled at the gleeful look on Cas's face before he turned over and snuggled back into Cas, letting the other man wrap an arm around him and pull him closer.
As the designated mechanic for their vehicle, it was Dean's job to fuel up their Jeep before they could take off. Amy did the same with Jody's Jeep. Dean studiously ignored the unpleasant Alpha and just did his job. He felt like Amy was staring at him a few times, but he refused to look in her direction to verify. But, before long they were all piled back into their respective vehicles and taking off again down the deserted roads.
had in any of these facilities – ever! – but you, Dean, were put in a horrid situation and it should never have happened!” Benny admitted vehemently, a dead serious look on his face. Jody nodded in agreement next to him.
Benny sighed heavily and nodded his head as he roughly ran a hand through his short, dark hair. “Yeah. I've got guards looking for him. When they find him they're gonna hold him in detention until I get back and I can give the man a piece of my mind.”
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Charlie grumbled, but there was no real heat behind it. “Doesn't mean I have to be happy about it, though.”
a choice, don't I? What if I choose 'No'?” After a moment of silence from both the Alpha and the Beta, Dean continued, “Look, I'm not saying that that's what I
When Dean still seemed intent on remaining silent, Cas was going to just give up and simply provide Dean with the comfort he obviously needed, but then he spoke up. “I- I dunno, man. It just... it makes no
“I see.” Cas nodded, then took a deep breath. It infuriated him that others could be so cruel to this sweet, and very small, young man. It made him even angrier when he realized that they must have done it of their own volition. The subdermal implant on his arm hadn't changed when Alfie presented himself, so he could only assume that the same was true for the other Alphas. Alfie cringed and whimpered a bit as he got a whiff of Castiel's anger, which immediately made the Alpha feel guilty. “I'm sorry Alfie, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at those others who would do that to you. And I promise I will
! It started as a relatively large pool in the floor. In the center, there was a thin, cone-shaped flow that gradually tapered upwards into a steady stream that disappeared into the ceiling.
Dean moaned and bucked his hips once more when Cas's probing digits hit his prostate and pressed into the sensitive bundle of nerves remorsefully. The Omega tried to beg, in-between kisses with moans of “please Cas” and “need more”, but the Alpha astutely ignored his pleas and continued his ministrations.
Charlie smiled kindly at Dean's disgruntled grumbling, then addressed Castiel. “As I was explaining to Dean, the kitchens aren't meant for food preparation. All residents are encouraged to take their meals in one of the dining halls. A meal schedule is posted there, on the refrigerator,” she pointed to it and the couple turned to look, noticing that there was indeed a note posted to the chrome surface. “You can, however, store fruits and vegetables in the kitchen and prepare beverages for refreshment. But cooking with heat and possibly flames is a fire hazard that we wish to avoid, which is why there's no stove, oven, microwave, toaster, or anything else that can be used as a source of heat.”
would definitely cause a stir if anyone got the wrong idea about what the two Councilmen were doing together. Alone. In a freaking storage room. After they just confirmed that the Alpha Councilmen were having an affair.
There were panicked shouts and shots fired, bodies fell and pained screams rang out. Dean escaped, then Sam and Cas lunged to protect their mates and everyone tried protecting each other.
“Kill us,” Jody confirmed. “They plan on replacing all of the Council with Alphas. Even the Omegas that they put in Anna's and Gabriel's places. They want Alphas just like them running it all.”
There was a chorus of grunts and half-formed utterances as greeting, but Donna didn't seem to mind, or notice. She bounded into the room and helped herself to the simple breakfast of eggs, toast, and coffee.
“Uh, yep. That's me,” he was slightly embarrassed, but he didn't regret the marks one bit. However, he was still grateful that she didn't make a big deal out of it. She smelled of rain and fresh-cut grass and he immediately took a liking to her.
-” Benny said as he pointed in the direction of the disturbance, speaking loudly to be heard over the blare, “is the alarm lettin' me know there's been a breach in security.” He ended his explanation with a pointed glare at the Omega.
Before long, they reached the steel set of double doors to the bunker's surveillance room, and Benny once again went through the process of gaining access. Once inside the sound-proof room, there was a flurry of lights and the blare of sirens, all emitting from one corner of the room, directly to the left of the entrance.
Eventually, they passed what looked like an auditorium. The Beta explained that they will often hold intellectual lectures for anyone who was interested to attend.
“Yeah. If I could. I mean, I don't know what could happen, but I just wanted to be prepared, y'know? If we were ever in a position where I
to try explaining this to his little brother, even if he could fully understand it himself. He's still breathing heavily and his heart is racing as he tries to gather his thoughts, refusing to look his brother in the eye, instead opting to stare out the windshield at the empty road.
Without further preamble, Dean plopped himself down on the 'bed', resting his head on the pillow with a satisfied groan. “God! It's like sleeping on a marshmallow!”
“Well, from where I'm standing, the Council needs a bit of reshaping. I mean how can we stand idly by while Omegas are being brutally raped and Alphas are soon to be forced into taking on more mates than they can handle?!”
“Yep. Let's go, Cas,” Dean patted Cas's leg as he got up from the examination table, paper crinkling loudly as he did so. He hopped down and headed for the door.
Just as hope began to die in Dean's heart and mind, his salvation finally came in the sound of a familiar and formally hated voice. Now it was a soothing balm to his battered soul.
committed suicide. He just couldn't have! And Anna stepping down, seemingly on the same day? No. NO! It all seemed just a bit too contrived. Too much of a coincidence. He had to expose those Alphas for what they were and he had to do it fast!
Ever since they'd found out that Dean was pregnant the Alpha had wanted nothing more than to lie his head on his mate's belly and talk to his pups, nestled safe and warm inside. He wanted to nuzzle the man's belly, hold his mate tightly to his body and growl possessively at anyone who got too close.
Dean moaned as Cas sucked a mark into his flesh, and he didn't even notice that Cas had shifted, placing his own painfully hard member at his wet and waiting entrance. They simultaneously expelled loud and filthy moans as Cas buried himself to the hilt in Dean's hole in one long thrust.
“Jess had to talk me some sense into me so I would let the other medics tend to you. You-” Cas's voice caught in his throat. “You could have died, Dean. There was so much blood, and I-” He looked away, blinking back tears as he relived the last few hours. After a deep, steadying breath, he continued. “I didn't protect you. You almost died and I lost it. I wouldn't let anyone near you to help you when you needed it.” Tears streamed down the Alpha's face. “I'm so sorry, Dean.”
Dean scowled and shook his head, looking away for a moment. He studied the cloudy display on the fake window behind the other Omega. After a moment he said, “So, is there just no way to, like, fight back or something?”
, she tossed an approving wink towards Adam then walked away, seemingly without a care in the world, ebony waves shining darkly in the overhead lights.
Back in front of the clock by Ellen's office, Dean held up his arm so that the clock's face could scan him once again and log him out. He was happily sauntering out when he heard a commanding voice behind him.
Jody followed him without question, though she was still quite curious. They walked in silence for a minute or two, then Jody suddenly paused and opened a random door to her right, just to see what was inside. It was a bedroom, sparse yet functional. There was a twin sized bed on a metal frame, a desk with a wooden chair and a single, empty shelf on the wall above the desk, large enough to fit maybe 6 books and a few knick-knacks. Jody stepped back and closed the door, then looked at Benny, one eyebrow raised in question.
The room contained a large television screen suspended from the ceiling on the left. In the center of the room was a large conference table, elongated and oval, with a tablet resting on top. To the far right of the room was another floor-to-ceiling window that took up the whole wall, and it was showcasing a brilliant and sunny afternoon sky, with a grassy field and gentle breeze blowing through it, bending the tall, green blades.
cases, each time that happened, you were experiencing the nanites and proteins activating to change you a little more each time, and it also served as your
Benny mentally shook himself, there was no time to lose – he had things he needed to do, atrocities to prevent, Council members to overthrow. A wife to inform. Although he knew Charlie would miss him and worry, he also knew that she'd have Dorothy, another Beta, to keep her company. The two had been romantically involved for some time now, and he was okay with it. It was quite common for Betas to seek romantic involvement with other Betas when their spousal assignments didn't match with their sexual preferences.
“Yes. I figured there was some sort of biological need that Omegas have to comfort children, but then you didn't seem to be as... distressed as the others.” Cas frowned slightly as he seemed to think about that for a moment.
The couple froze and slowly lifted their heads to see that all eyes were on them. They quickly pulled apart and made hasty apologies in the process. Dean's face heated up, mortified.
“Yeah,” Benny answered. “Almost everyone gets assigned jobs that match their talents. You woulda been put in the garage to work under Caleb anyways, so this works out.”
, another Alpha when they're supposed to be mating with the only available Omega. It's a territorial thing.”
“Oh right, right,” Charlie cut off Dean's inquiry with a wave of her hand, “I'm getting ahead of myself, here. Okay, so, Phase Two was merely a
? Oh yeah, he knows how. Which reminds him... “You!” He pointed an index finger at Cas accusingly. “
Cas reached over and ran a soothing hand up and down Dean's back. The Omega sighed in gratitude as he pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to relieve some of the pressure in his skull.
“And we'd like you to keep this between us, please,” Benny added, giving the couple a stern look. “We're doin' everything we can, but it would move a lot smoother if we could keep a lid on all of this. Got it? Don't tell a soul.”
Cas wasn't convinced, but there wasn't really anything he could do about the situation. He took a few breaths to calm his nerves so he wouldn't upset Alfie again. He didn't speak again until he felt he was calm enough to continue and move on.
The elevator stopped on the floor to the storage unit and opened up for him to exit. He pushed the cart out in front of him, then turn and pressed the button for the doors to close. Then pushed the cart up and down the aisles looking for the row with the damn pickles.
“Hm.” Cas wrinkled his nose at the black and vibrant ruby red that was to be his new uniform. He handed Dean his green and teal uniform as another package fell from between their clothes.
The first thing that Dean had to do was meet with the head mechanic in the garage to get his promised crash-course; then he was to grab a couple of duffle bags from the garage's supply room (one for himself and one for Cas) and take them back to his apartment. By that time, Cas should have received the message of his new assignment and the two of them would pack together and get some rest before meeting Jody and Benny back in the garage in the morning, where they'd get a vehicle and some supplies to take with them
After he took a few moments to collect himself, Dean sat back up and looked at the Beta, refusing to meet Cas's eyes. “Okay, so what are my options?”
Benny's heart seemed to drop from his chest, sinking through the floor as it did so. “What d'ya mean...?” Surely they didn't still want to discuss those
Cas was upset by the intrusion at first, but he quickly schooled his features and greeted the new-comers.
“Oh, this I've gotta hear,” Dean said as he sat up straight again. Cas's hand fell from his back and the Omega spoke again. “Well, let's have it then.”
Without another word, they immediately filed inside and got to work. One of them pushed a cart with some strong-smelling chemicals, buckets, scrub brushes and other cleaning supplies that would be needed for the task. Each of them wore surgical masks, rubber gloves, aprons and rubber booties over their shoes, which would be discarded of once their task was completed.
I do not own the images used in this chapter. I just found the reproductive images on a Google image search, and the wonderful and talented Chrystal Ambrose drew the uniforms for me!
Stranger approached him, looking down at him with a smug grin on his face. “Now. Isn't this better? Much more
As they each came down from their respective highs, Cas lavishing even more kisses to Dean's neck and shoulders, and Dean lying boneless beneath his mate, limp and satiated, Cas ventured to ask a question. “You wanna tell me what that was about?”
Cas sat back down on the floor against the wall where he was earlier. Dean remained standing, pacing a bit. What else was he gonna do? He considered eating some more, because why not? But he eyed the food warily then decided against it. He was far too full already. So he kept pacing, swiping at a tiny bead of sweat that had materialized on his temple.
It had been just a couple of days since Dean's appointment with Doctor Rufus. He was diligently taking his prenatal vitamins twice a day, as instructed, and Cas even convinced him to choke down at least one fruit and veggie a day. The man just better be glad that he loves him!
But he needed proof. He couldn't wildly accuse fellow Council members of contrivances and conspiracy without hard, irrefutable and undeniable proof of any and all wrong-doings. Anything less and he'd be accused of falsehoods himself and kicked off the Council for his trouble.
! That's why. We can't stress him out with a belly fulla pups. And somethin' like this-” he jabbed a finger at the screen where Gabriel's cocky face was still displayed, “-has the potential to be
Charlie charged ahead, but Dean and Cas remained frozen by the door through which they'd just entered. It was all just a lot to take in. After spending so long isolated from other people, with just the two of them as company – with the obvious exception of when Cas met Alfie – it was suddenly very daunting to be in the presence of so many people again, and all at once.
After a few moments of silence, and Dean almost aggressively scenting Cas, the Alpha gently repositioned the two of them so that they were both sitting on the bed together. They had been in a position where Cas was standing next to the bed and Dean was kneeling on it with his arm wrapped around the Alpha, but Cas was sure that they'd both be more comfortable in a slightly more horizontal position.
Upon further inspection, he notices something on his left forearm: it's three vertical dots, one above the other. But the odd thing is they appear to be underneath his skin; and weirder still - they're
“Nothing, it's just... I saw a lot of the other Omegas nearly jumping out of their seats to help the child before her father intervened.”
“This is the cleaning crew that's gonna take care of that mess in your living room,” Benny answered.
Alistair was panting slightly in his post-orgasmic bliss, but it only took him a few moments to get his breathing back under control. Once he did, he said, “Post Position A.”
just a few hours. The two of them continued on and soon they were turning into the kitchen. They paused in the doorway for a moment to take in the sight.
“Okay, everyone!” Benny said once he and his tiny entourage had arrived on the scene. He raised his arms to get everyone's attention and he had to shout to be heard over the ruckus and he didn't continue until everyone was looking his way. “I need yall to get back to your homes and go about your business. I know this is new and possibly exciting, but we can't do our jobs with everyone here.”
Dean smiled, though Cas couldn't see it, and snuggled further into his Alpha before closing his eyes and drifting into a contented rest.
“Okay...” Cas decided to try a different tact. He settled down in front of the young man, crossing his legs in what he hoped was a non-threatening manner. “Maybe you could tell me your name?” He asked once he was seated properly. When no answer was given, Cas offered, “My name is Castiel.” He hoped the prompt would get the boy to un-clam up.
Knowing that they didn't have much time before the third warning was issued, Cas said, “We can worry about that later.” Cas inhaled deeply. “Mmm, but you smell like
“Right,” Dean nodded as he set his jaw, his head dropped and his heart rate ratcheted up a few notches.
“I highly doubt it. If they wanted us dead, then they would not have bothered with this entire scenario, inside this room, to begin with. I'm sure there are much more effective ways of executing someone.”
The pair found a couple of seats together and sat quietly for a while. Dean looked around, noticing all of the other patients who were waiting their turn to be called. There were Omegas, many of them being accompanied by their Alphas, and even a pair of Betas in one corner, talking amongst themselves. The one thing they all had in common were the pups.
Cas closed the door and immediately rushed to Dean's side. He could smell his Omega's distress wafting off of him in waves as soon as the door opened.
“Well don't sound so excited,” Jody said, sounding slightly offended by the man's lack of enthusiasm and an even graver lack of faith. “Fire with fire, remember? Since those two went behind our backs, killed one of our friends, wiped the memories of another and brought in those two traitorous scumbags, then I figure the gloves are off, don't you think?”
“Alright then,” Benny said as he clapped his hands in front of himself, “let's bring them back in here.”
“Next...” Charlie made her way over to the wall that the couch was facing. She picked up a remote off of a shelf that was hanging there and pressed a button. A panel of the wall moved to the side, revealing a large television screen.
“And how do you know if the transmission needs repairs?” Hector raised an eyebrow expectantly and crossed his arms as he awaited an answer.
or weeks before any symptoms manifested. When symptoms finally did begin showing up, many people simply mistook it for the flu. It had many of the same symptoms: fever, coughing, sneezing, aches and pains, headache, etc. Except it killed in just a few days when the fever refused to break. It basically cooked the victim alive from the inside out. Nothing could bring down the fever; not medicine, not ice packs, nor a roll in the snow. And definitely not prayer or new-agey herbs.
! I think I'll stick around, thanks.” What the hell? Did Cas really think he was gonna leave him alone with that creep? Nuh-uh. Not happening. Bacon could wait.
And cousins! His and Sam's kids would grow up together. Get into mischief together. Well, that's as long as they could continue to get together after Gabriel took them all back to his own facility. But they could figure all of that out later.
Cas chuckled again. He was relieved Dean was taking this all so well. By the time they were finished discussing the events of the past few days, the swelling in Cas's knot had gone down enough for him to gingerly pull out of Dean's hole, which actually involuntarily clenched around the member, trying to keep it in.
! That's mind-boggling enough as it is.” Cas took a moment to take another breath, trying to gather his thoughts before continuing, but he didn't know what else to say. What
“Sooo, what now?” Dean asked. The whirring and crackling of the Geiger counter was starting to grate at his nerves.
“Yeah,” Gordon added, “and it's necessary to ensure that the mating bite has successfully bonded the Omega to their Alpha, and-”
they supposed to do? If it's true that Dean actually went through such a horrible experience (which Cas fully believes that he did), then the people in charge – Benny and the other members of the so-called Council – were already aware of it. They did attempt to erase the man's memories of the event, after all. So what exactly
“This could actually work,” Benny said as he watched Jody tip back her glass of bourbon, finishing it off.
are something else.” Alistair caressed Dean's flank as he ground his knot against Dean's prostate, eliciting another shameful keening noise from the Omega's raw throat.
? What had he done to deserve this? Was there any way he could fix it? Whatever the answers were to those questions, he wouldn't be receiving one. His attention was roughly brought back to the present as Stranger – Alistair, apparently – began ramming into him roughly, grabbing his hips in a bruising, vice-like grip.
Benny looked at the time on the dashboard, then said, “You think you guys can hold on just a while longer? We're almost to our first checkpoint.”
With barely concealed laughter, Charlie responded, “Yes, Dean. It's standard attire for all Omegas, just like Cas's uniform is standard for Alphas, and what I'm wearing is for Betas.”
“Wait a minute...” Al sits up and leans forward, his arms draped over his knees as he stares at the couple intently, his eyes practically boring into Dean. “You remember... don't you?” That slimy, oily smirk got even slimier.
Meg told him about her life with four Omega bond-mates and a horde of Alistair's children, though most of them spent a majority of their time in one of the nurseries or one of the play areas. Many of the children in the facility spent time there, often staying the night, as they were looked after by the childcare staff.
Benny sighed. “Maybe.” After a moment he said, “Well, whatever the reason, I guess we can ask him when we see him.”
The lower portion of the wall was sliding out, creating a long shelf that was waist-high and roughly two feet deep. About a foot and a half above that, the rest of the wall sunk backwards about 8 inches, creating another smaller platform.
Gabriel shot Dean a withering glare. “Yeah. I did. And I thought you'd want some answers too, seeing as they almost got you killed.”
, but he just wasn't ready to admit it out loud yet). But that look on Cas's face. That look of abject adoration and wonder and awe. He just couldn't bring himself to try and take it back.
Cas pulled Dean in tighter, placing a hand on the back of the Omega's head. He lifted his chin and gently tucked Dean's face into the crook of his neck. “Sniff here, Dean,” Cas said quietly. “It'll help.”
Benny stared in disbelief at the Omega in front of him. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. He turned to Jody, who was standing a few feet back and to the left of him, and gestured at Dean in astonishment as if to say, “Are you
“Right. Let's get crackin'. Dean, follow us,” Benny beckoned for the Omega to follow as he and Jody led the way out of the bunker as their newest mission began.
Dean and Cas glanced at each other again before returning their gazes to Charlie. “Okaaay... but what does that have to do with-”
“Me too.” Dean took a few more moments to admire Cas's marked shoulder before he looked down at their chests, noticing the mess there and wrinkling his nose. Looking back up he said, “Well, how about a shower?”
“Great!” Charlie announced, clapping her hands together in front of her. “Let's get going then.” The Beta turned around again and resumed her trek across the lobby, this time peeking behind herself a few times to make sure the pair were still following.
!” Dean said, his eyebrows flying towards his hairline in sudden understanding. After a moment, his smirk widened into a full, wide grin. “Sure, Cas. That'd be fine.” Cas's eyes lit up even brighter than they did when Dean agreed to shower together. “So... how do you wanna...?” Dean trailed off, letting Cas figure it out.
It appeared that they entered through a side door to the lobby, or whatever it was. There was a large staircase that went up and to the left, leading to another level and a walkway that looked out on the area below, which is where they were standing. The banister and railings were glass, the steps and floors where a grey and white marble. The space oozed corporate, but a fancy corporate. It all just seemed very clean-cut and sterile.
“So,” she began, “your food is on the way up from the kitchens right now. We can talk and get a few questions answered while we wait, it'll only take a few minutes though, so don't worry, you won't starve.” Charlie smiled again, reassuringly. “Okay so, before I get into my schpiel, or so I don't
In the images used, I just wanted to note that the penis of the Alpha female is retractable. Not sure if that was clear in the image.
Dean occasionally shifted uncomfortably, unused to sitting still for so long. He wanted to ask for a break to get out and stretch his legs, but he didn't want to be responsible for delaying them any further, so he kept his mouth shut on the matter.
"Who are you? Why the hell am I here?!" Blue-Eyes (as Dean has decided to dub him) demands after straightening back up. He has the graveliest, sexiest voice he's ever heard, like whiskey and chocolate. It was soothing and grating all at once, and the man himself was a sight to behold, and just as naked as Dean. He was all dark hair and lean muscle going all the way down to- nope,
Dean took a deep breath and turned to Cas, looking to him for comfort and support. The Alpha reached over and squeezed his hand, lending strength and solidarity. Whatever happened, Cas would be right there with him.
Taking the small container with him, Benny trudged back to his desk and slumped down in his chair sadly. He took another swig, this one slightly smaller. As he drank, the contents getting lower and lower, he thought about all that had just happened.
“That Voice, Cas! Capital V. Alphas use it to keep their Omegas in line. Alistair used it on Meg and his other Omegas, and you've been using it on me since the ultrasound!”
Dean continued to plead and beg, “No, stop! Please stop!” After a while, he didn't know if he was talking to Alistair or his own body, which continued to race to the edge. Soon - all too soon - he could feel a growing pressure in his lower abdomen. His cock, hanging heavy and neglected between his legs, was weeping uncontrollably; glob after glob of precum splattering onto the bed beneath him. He could feel it, so close. God, he nearly wanted to beg for it, just so it could be
“'Dressed out'?” Dean asked, the terminology lost on him. He reconvened with the rest of the group as Benny spoke, after he had spent the last few minutes trying to avoid any interaction with the unpleasant Alpha woman.

Chuckling, the two of them obediently got dressed, keeping their flirting to a minimum, oblivious to the eye-rolls and tiny grins they still elicited from Charlie. How was it that putting
On the television, the still picture jumped to life, and Dean's deep voice resonated through Conference Room J. “
manage to scrounge up some sort of damning evidence, it wouldn't do a damn bit of good since the entire Council seems to be against us now? The Omegas are obviously in the Alphas' pockets, so what are
There was something else he needed to know. Something that he was ashamed of, but he just had to know. “Alfie, do you know, um, why I- why I felt, um... earlier, when you were...”
“Alright,” Jody said. “Well, he's gotta be in the facility somewhere. There's no way he could have gotten out without the codes.”
“We've just found out that we're expecting quintuplets,” Cas explained, “and Dean is less than thrilled about it.”
and the Betas were beginning to think something had gone wrong. They expected their people to have made their move. But, just as they started to lose hope, all hell broke loose.
He finished off with telling them about how Alistair basically admitted to raping him, Cas losing his temper, Dean pulling him off of the vile pervert. Finally, he completed his recounting with Al saying all of those disgusting things. Seeing nothing but red. Just... red. Everywhere.
As they approached, they were met with the sound of voices, clattering dishes, and the smell of something delicious. It seemed like everyone else was already in the midst of lunch. Or dinner? Wait, how long
Charlie chuckled again. “Don't worry, I didn't watch you personally. I just gave the last few days of your video feed a cursory glance, just so I could know who I'm talking to. Also, you'll get more privacy inside your housing unit. Someone's always watching you while in this facility, but when you're in your home, you have complete privacy. Speaking of which,” the Beta stood as if to leave, “if there aren't other burning questions you guys need answers to, we really should get moving. I need to show you around some more, give you a bit of a tour before showing you where you'll be living.” She looked at them expectantly. “Are you guys ready?”
Cas's brilliant azure met Dean's deep emerald and saw nothing but concern and trust, such a contrast from the suspicion, distrust and even slight fear he saw there mere hours ago. Feeling emboldened by this, Cas found his voice, though it was still tenuous. “I was wondering, um, if we could, I mean if you don't mind-”
“Oh... alright,” Charlie grumbled in disappointment and annoyance. She had wanted to stay and chat some more, but apparently, that would have to wait.
“Doctor...” Cas warned, a low rumble starting in his chest, getting a little tired of his mate being berated. He rested a comforting hand on Dean's shoulder, asking the Omega if he was alright. When Dean told him that he was fine, not to worry, Cas returned his gaze to the doctor.
Well, damn. The woman was blunt! “Uuuhh,” Dean began blushing profusely and elected not to comment further on the subject.
Dean went to the far wall, furthest from the water (which had appeared along the same wall from which Cas had appeared) and placed his back against it, sliding down until he was seated on the floor, his knees pressed to his chest and his arms resting on his knees. Cas had already sat down against a wall of his own, to Dean's left, and he was staring straight ahead, not really looking at anything. As Dean looked at Cas, he heard a strange rumbling noise, immediately followed by a blush and an embarrassed look on Cas's face.
Dean had grabbed his chair and rolled it back in to place before he slumped heavily back into it as he stared at the screen.
and just went out by yourselves. They would have attacked the bus whether we were all aboard or not. I mean
Dean couldn't tell by the sound of her voice how she felt about that. But then he remembered to scent the air – there was a whole section about scents in the handbook – and he could tell from how her cherries went from fresh to slightly tart, that she was angry, though only slightly. As if this were something that she'd had to deal with for a while and wasn't as angry about it anymore as she could be.
As Dean rested his head against Cas's shoulder, the Alpha's mind started reeling. What could have caused this? How could Dean have experienced those things? And
completed. There were four of everything: dining halls, gyms, swimming pools, rec rooms, tracks, sports fields (each of which was multi-functional). You name it, they had it – in spades! The facility was large enough to accommodate all of the current residents, plus future generations as the population inevitably grew.
Everyone swung around to face the new speaker. Dean had heard the commotion from the tub, so he decided to investigate. He had gotten out of the water, dried off and dressed in a clean uniform, then he came up the hall where he'd heard the tail end of their conversation. The Omega looked shy and unsure of himself as if he wanted to run and hide from all of the strangers in his home. Or maybe he was ashamed of what he'd done.
At the commanding tone, Alfie immediately complied. “Yes, Alpha.” He dropped his hips into a crouching position, raising his head, before pushing himself up and standing in the middle of the room. He turned to face Castiel.
“Well, the first reason is that Sam was assigned to a different facility. There are 6 in total, in case you're wondering. The second is that he has also had his memories of you erased, so even if you did contact him, he wouldn't know you. And the third reason is...” Charlie stopped to think for a moment before she continued. “The whole reason we have to go through the memory erasure is because we're expected to start a whole new life here. A new future, without bringing the past along to weigh us down. All of the horrible things of the past will
you guys better since you moved in.” That oily smile stayed in place. “Lead the way,” he said as he gestured for them to continue down the hall.
“What are we doing here? What is the purpose of... all of this?” Cas fielded the question, gesturing to the room, their clothes, the facility in general. Just... everything, all encompassed in that one sweeping gesture.
For the next couple of hours, the two of them worked companionably and they worked fast. There was a
Benny was beginning to get a little angry. Firstly, his good friend Gabriel is dead, having committed
Benny and Jody glanced at each other, a world of meaning seemed to pass between them in that look alone. After a moment they seemed to agree on something, so Benny took a breath and said, “The Omega portion of Phase two is somethin' that we've been tryna to get rid of for some time now. But the other members of the Council have been... less than cooperative.”
It took a second for Dean to catch up to what was being said. His mind had momentarily gone blank from being in such close proximity to the other Alpha. Though once his brain kick-started back into gear he suddenly got angry as Cas. “Uh,
comes back, and you don't want him here, just contact security. You can push the panic button that I showed you on the remote.”
“Okay,” the doctor said, “you can sit up now, pull down your shirt and pull up your pants.” He quickly washed his hands with the little sink in the corner of the desk again, dried them on some paper towels, then made to leave. Clipboard in one hand, doorknob in the other, he continued with his instructions. “I've got a few other patients to check in on. In the meantime, one of the nurses will come and take you both to one of the ultrasound rooms. Just sit tight for now and one of them will come get you in just a few.” With that, he took off down the hall at a decent clip.
“Well good. So I guess that's it for now. You can get going. I'm sure you've got a lot to do before you get out of here.”
Okay guys, I know this chapter is SUPER late, but I just had this major case of writer's block. I mean, seriously, I thought that LAST chapter fought me, but his one damn near kicked my ass! So I'm sorry about that. I can't promise that it won't happen again, but I CAN promise that I won't be giving up on this story. Like, ever!
This time the Omega turned his attention to the searing blue eyes and intense stare of his Alpha. “Yeah?”
Cas shifted his hands, eyes not leaving the screen. He kept one hand clasped on Dean's but the other moved to the Omega's shoulder. “Dean...” is all that he could manage.
taken Alistair's actions into account,” Benny said as he finally spoke up. “He was very... cruel to you during the second Phase, to put it lightly.” The Beta tried to say it as kindly as he could.
eat fruits and veggies and healthy fats like nuts and avocados?” The disgusted look on the Omega's face told the doctor everything he needed to know. “Ya-huh,” doctor Rufus grumbled with a knowing look in Cas's direction.
the information you need, not who gives it to you. So I'm gonna get Hector to help you out, alright? He's my second in command and knows just as much about this stuff as I do. He'll see to it that you get all the info you need, and quick.”
Charlie had chosen to seat them in the dining hall that was conveniently called Dining Hall A. It was spacious, though there weren't many people around. Charlie explained that most people ate dinner as soon as possible, and she'd purposefully chosen a time to come that was a bit later than usual so they wouldn't be overwhelmed by so many bodies and scents and noises. It would take a few days for their bodies to acclimate so they could comfortably endure being around so many people at once.
“Uh, thank you!” Cas stammered out his appreciation. He let go of Dean and stepped forward to give the Beta male a hearty handshake and a squeeze on the shoulder.
Cas was taken aback. He had no idea he'd been exuding so much control over his mate. He'd never intended to do such a thing. “Dean,” he began, “I had no idea. I- I don't know anything about that. I'm so sorry.” He reached for his mate again, hoping not to be rejected once more.
Benny pulled out and headed down the lane, passing other vehicles in their stations, each of them in various states of repair. Mechanics of each Designation, with gear-shaped emblems on their sleeves, rushed to move out of the way as they bustled to and fro. Jody's vehicle followed close behind.
But no! He stopped himself halfway to another random door. What was he thinking? Whoever it was could help him get out. He'd face the consequences of his actions and take whatever punishments were coming his way. The only thing he had to fear was being taken away from Cas. And exploring a secret passage without permission couldn't possibly be bad enough to warrant
“Yes, although maybe they kept us bound together the first time to prepare us for this. So that we'd be accustomed to being bound after we 'mate'.”
The gentle movement caused a trickle of slick to escape from Dean's puckered hole. The scent wafted up and made its way to the Alpha's nostrils. A low growl escaped Cas's throat and he abandoned Dean's rock hard cock in favor of diving even lower and burying his tongue in Dean's now-drenched ass.
to his body to make that possible. He also noticed that Cas was nailing his prostate like it was his damn job; and most of all, he noticed his own cock, swollen and heavy, lying neglected against his stomach. It gave a little bob every time Cas thrusted inside of him, causing the tiniest bit of delicious friction to the head.
When Dean was ready, he explained to Cas everything Meg had said, and the images it elicited in his mind once she'd left. But not just images. Sounds, scents and sensations accompanied what he'd seen, painting a vivid image of a scene that couldn't possibly have happened.
When Dean woke, hours later, it was to a stifling heat that made it nearly impossible for him to breathe.
Jody calmly followed him, suppressing an amused grin as she did so. She took her time walking around the bar, unlike Benny and stopped in front of the overgrown child her colleague and friend had suddenly become. When she noticed the impatient expression on his face and the buzz of energy practically radiating off of him, she could no longer suppress her grin.
And suddenly they were under attack. Something spiky had been tossed into the road, right in front of the van. Benny saw it and could have easily dodged it, but he didn't. He made sure to hit it and soon they were rolling with two busted wheels, both on the passenger side, and the van tilting uncomfortably in that direction.
It took him a moment to answer her, but once he did, he stuttered a bit, saying, “Oh, I – uh, don't know?” He shook his head slightly, a frown pulling at his own features as well. “It just... seems like something he'd say?” He looked back and Meg's face, which was still shadowed in mild suspicion, but after a few moments she let it go.
to have a hard-on in a room with a strange guy, no matter what the situation. They soon give up the task as futile, especially since it just seems to be getting warmer by the minute, almost to unacceptable levels.
Then they quickly moved on to the slightly more complicated functions, like electrical and ignition functions, which included the battery and starter. By the time they started getting to the really complicated stuff, like the transmission and how the engine works, and how all of the components fit together, Dean was feeling much more in his element. All of the lessons stuck really quickly, and Hector never had to repeat himself. Not even once.
“Oh yeah, definitely!” Charlie agreed, going a bit bug-eyed as she nodded her head. “If you'd been in one of the Alphas' facilities there's no telling what kind of mess you two would be in right now.”
“Okay... well,” she turned back to the monitor and pointed to each of the shapes in turn as she explained. “these two only have one dot in them because they each contain only one pup. But this one,” she pointed to the largest of the shapes, which was actually more of an oval, “this one has
“Motion passes.” The Alphas and Omegas smiled and congratulated each other while the Betas stood motionless and dumbstruck.
Dean followed her eyes, then his face lit up with understanding. “Oh! Yeah. I've been, uh, just trying to figure out some stuff.”
“I don't know, Dean,” Cas answered with a sigh. When he scented his mate's distress he said, “But I'm sure the penalty can't be too harsh. Al was a monster and he got what he deserved. And the way he handled the situation obviously caused you great distress mentally, and possibly physically as well. The way he stressed you out could have been damaging to the pups. With how seriously they take child care and development around here, I'm pretty sure they'll take that into account.”
"Well that's just not gonna happen, sweetheart!" Dean says back to the Voice. No sooner than the words leave his mouth, Dean is moving - but not of his own volition. There are suddenly what looks like /cuffs/ on both his wrists and ankles, glowing and pulsating with the same pale, white glow as the dots when he first discovered them. They are dragging him forwards, to the center of the room.
Dean ignored the other man, trying to calm his breathing which had decided to double in speed in the last few seconds. He had also resumed his pacing. Their captors were most likely going to force them together again any minute now.
“Well, that's convenient.” Dean stood and made his way over to the newest addition to their room. He stopped within arms reach of it, then reach out a hand and tentatively ran his fingers under it. The water was cool and actually wet! When he pulled his hand away, his fingers were glistening with residual droplets of water. What's more: the water didn't change colors like the first spout did when it was touched, which was a definite plus. Dean didn't think it would be particularly pleasant to drink pink water.
He tried his best not to move it much, the sling it was wrapped in did a good job of helping on that front, but it still hurt like a bitch. After that, it was just a quick shuffle to the nearest toilet. Of course, he had to literally bat his mate away, insisting that he didn't need help with
“Well, the implants were equipped with robotic nanites, along with a few synthetic proteins, which altered your genetic structures, causing the changes that you've both experienced. The respective heats and ruts that you both went through – you know, those times when it felt like it was getting hotter, and then your, um, libidos ratcheted up to about a billion? – yeah, well, in
Something in Benny finally roared to life as he remembered himself and sprang back into leadership mode. “Donna! Get your medkit, right away, and help Dean.” Donna nodded as she quickly and wordlessly obeyed. “Captain!” The captain of Benny's guard stood to attention on Benny's right. “Get the prisoners restrained and loaded into any vehicle that with fit them. We'll need to get them in for erasure and reconditioning, ASAP.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably in his seat and diligently avoided the subject of his pregnancy. Instead, he grumbled, “I'd hardly call myself 'submissive'.”
So thank you again to all of you, especially if you've stuck through it all this time. And if you're new and only came across this fic after it had already been completed, then count yourself lucky that you didn't have to suffer like the others ;)
“Uh, yeah. Sure,” Dean shook himself out of his reverie and focused on the Beta male. “What do I need to do?”
Finally, Cas nodded and moved to the other side of the bed, careful not to jostle his injured mate as he settled in on Dean's good side.
“Hm.” They lied together in silence for a few minutes before Dean said, “It's gonna be hard to sleep with the room so bri-” Before he could finish his sentence the room suddenly dimmed. It didn't get completely dark, but it did dull to a warm glow that was dark enough to get some rest, but still light enough that they could get up and move about without stumbling around. “Well that's better.” Dean took a deep breath and relaxed back on to the bed and closed his eyes after surveying the new light settings.
