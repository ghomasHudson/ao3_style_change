He sighed. A Jedi Master was way out of his league anyway, and probably even tougher to handle. There was a
Tick. Tick. Tick. The analog clock worked, but never changed. The darkness swept in from the shadows and took a hold of Dean. It crawled up his legs, caressed him, cloaked him, then swallowed him. The darkness kept him in the nightmare. Perpetual. Deadly.
“Yeah, Mads?” Dean was leaned forward on his hands, having barely touched his food and almost asleep at the table.
He released his hold only to do something else that was against Castiel’s inclinations. One did not look into someone’s eyes out of respect for their personal space, just like one did not touch another for the same reason. But that’s exactly what Castiel did.
much worse. Castiel’s voice was at a register low enough to decimate Dean’s concentration. What was he saying? What was he doing? Why was the Jedi even here distracting him so badly? “Um, what are—why—”
Castiel swallowed Dean’s gasp of surprise and nipped that delicious bottom lip that had been brought to his attention just a minute ago. He wanted in. He wanted to taste and delve and wanted to be taken in-return. He wanted the scrape of teeth and the invasion of tongue.
“I came to find you because it was recently brought to my attention that we are very far from the Order, and my padawan is very understanding that you are your own person, perfectly capable of making up his own mind.” He tilted his head just so, enough to imply a question. “I sense nothing turbulent or dark in this, Dean. Maybe a few secrets, but that is everyone’s privilege.”
Still he would admit, the reputation that preceded Sam’s family did wonders to convince the Jedi Council that this was the best way to get past the embargo at sector 21A4.
This elicited a round of argument and fancy where everyone had an idea about how to program the hypothetical holoroom.
At the other table, Ruby made a show of sweeping back her long black curls and fanning the heated purple blush from her red skin. “I bet he’ll be such a looker. Jedi robes really get me hot.”
It was during this respite that the Jedi found Dean in the hangar, working on the Impala--his sturdy, black, C-H3V Y-class starfighter. He was rooting around near the manifolds at the belly of the craft, patching a wiring misdirect. A recording of his favorite compilation from DC\AC was blaring through the hangar speaker system and not another sound could be heard besides the riffs of electric strings and rhythmic beat of drums that accompanied the gritty, high pitched vocals of the lead singer. So, when Castiel was finally able to get Dean’s attention, it was pretty much like the Jedi appeared from nowhere to suddenly brush up against Dean’s shoulder while he had his eyes focused on the wires in his hands.
His hands were covered in red and blue colored blood that mixed into a black, coagulated sludge. It made holding the jagged, saw-like torture device a dangerous job. The slit-pupil eye he held in the other hand looked up at him as if aware, even though the optic nerve had been severed.
As art went, Dean’s hand was rough with blaster calluses and scars. Every mark was a story about Dean, and Castiel felt each against his own hand with a particular care to sense them beyond mere touch. He wanted to look down at them, but instead his eyes were caught by the shear amount of freckles across Dean’s skin, like beige stars dotting a milky peach sky. They even splattered across what breadth of collarbone that Dean’s shirt was open enough to reveal.
With three weeks (15 days) before they hit their destination sector, Dean had plenty of time to try and get to know the Jedi Master.
The best part of the exuberant message from his little brother was that he had convinced his teacher that Dean could smuggle them in. Instead of waiting for Endor Day to finally see Sam, there was only a week to go when Dean docked in Coruscant. And not only was the mission sort of legal, but he was going to be paid for it. Dean counted this is a giant win all around.
“What?” He had to stop and take a moment. Did he just get permission? “I—uhh—I’m wary of them. Rightfully so.” And that was something to keep in mind rather than let his guard down to that handsome brooding face accented in dark stubble.
Castiel’s exposed collarbone drew Dean in like a beacon and he followed the contour downward with his lips, and then all the way down. Each curve of muscle beneath lightly tanned skin and each quiver of response gave him a direction to go and license to please. Castiel’s body was a well-toned gift to Dean’s attentions and he couldn’t do justice to the bounty—standing as they were in the middle of his living room.
The kid spun around in the chair. His face a mask of neutrality. “Master Castiel thinks he can work with me. Not everyone has an agenda, Dean. Sometimes people just want to do the right thing, like Jedi aspire to do all the time.”
Of course, once those two were seated, the entertainment started and everyone began to wake up for real.
The floor was a tangled mass of gore and broken bodies. The walls were rusted metal sheets painted in bile and unknown fluids. The air hummed with a drone of a fan, ventilating the room without relieving the humidity or intense smell of rot and excrement.
Dean’s eyes were green and gold, the colors made more prominent by the shrinking of the pupils in the overly bright docking port lights. There were soft wrinkles at the corners of those eyes, which suggested good humor in most human cultures, and a scar across the right eyebrow that wasn’t explained by any of Sam’s stories.
After three days of tense, ‘accidental’ meetings, and dancing around each other indecisively in between long stares and exploratory conversation, it was getting to the point that Dean was slowly dissolving into a mess of nerves. The attraction was wrecking him to the point he had even tried to get Sam to teach him meditation. That had failed spectacularly, so Dean had beat the stuffing out of a punching bag instead, which had only served to make him sweaty and tired, but no less desperate.
When the darkness seeped in it was a gradual thing that twisted his dreams and sent him careening into memories he kept locked away when he was awake.
“I’m the exception to the rule, huh?” The idea was just tantalizing enough for him to break out in a small smile.
It was that kind of crap that their mother and father had been trying to avoid. “Cut that out, Sam. Stay out of my head.”
“Consent pending.” Castiel’s eyelids fluttered, and dark lashes settled to half-cover that damned optical distraction and give Dean some room to think.
And Castiel was giving him plenty of opportunity to do so. On a ship that could hold up to three-hundred people and a starfighter, Castiel had ample opportunity and Jedi senses to avoid Dean if he really wanted to.
He leaned forward over Dean, rested his head against the man’s chest even as his free arm wrapped around Dean’s waist and brought the thrusting to a stop. His fingers were still tucked inside, and he let them stay there, unmoving to revel in the heat of it before he spoke. His voice was a little broken. “Do you want me here?” He crooked his fingers then to make his point.
Blood in every color known to the galaxy. Screams in every voice of every sentient species that had been put under his ‘care’.
Castiel knew or responded to Dean’s inclination and guided them both to a horizontal surface without ever breaking more contact than was necessary. Dean fell onto the couch while holding on to Castiel, bringing the Jedi on top of him.
He left his crew to their morning routines and headed off to his own quarters to get his four hours. He fell into the cushy comfort of his one indulgence of a good mattress with all his clothes still on and boots toed off over the edge of the bed. He fell asleep immediately, with the ease of a soldier taking rest where and when he could get it and entered into dreams that disturbed him and destroyed him.
Dean was making it impossible to concentrate on the coordination he needed to slick his other hand, while still holding on to the writhing mass of muscle and needy hands in his lap. He could do little but hold on, delighted to thrust his cock between sweat-slick thighs. Castiel’s teeth caught Dean’s collarbone, and then bit hard enough to make the rogue jump and still—just enough time for him to get the lubricant dispensed.
“I don’t believe ‘Impala’ is a Corellisi word.” Castiel finally took his gaze away to pay more attention to the shiny starcraft. “Sam talks of your devotion to this craft as if it were some sort of symbiotic lifeform.”
They were laid out over Dean’s bed, stretched out to cover as many inches of the cool, king size bedsheets as they could. Dean had turned onto his stomach to expose his ass to the air, letting the tingling after-sensations sing through him. He was sore in every good way, from where Castiel had gripped him to bruising, to how hard he ground on to Castiel’s thick cock. His thighs were going to give him hell on the morrow and it was going to be great.
He kissed the red mark he had left and proceeded to make up for it even more by slicking up Dean’s cleft. His fingers found their target, made quicker and easier by Dean backing into his hand. Dean gave him a show, moving up and down on his fingers, first two then three. Castiel worked Dean open, pressing into the prostate when he wanted to hear Dean curse in a throaty groan. That mouth was dirty and amazing. Castiel wanted those pretty, kiss-swollen lips against his, so he reached up across Dean’s back and pushed down when his hand found Dean’s neck.
That steady clicking as the antique gears of an ancient analog clock ticked, ticked, ticked down the seconds until the darkness should have faded, but never did.
Dean shook out the tension from his shoulders and locked his flask away back in the desk with a bit more force than necessary. Sam was right, Dean’s interest in Castiel wasn’t appropriate. It didn’t matter that the Jedi was grace-incarnate, with the most intense pair of blue eyes Dean had ever seen on a human. It didn’t matter that there might have been some sort of weird and electric sort of connection between them when they met on the docks.
their family had avoided Jedi for so long, and not just because of Sam. “Sorry, you’re right. I’ll forget it.”
There were few things more annoying than a padawan too excited to meditate properly. Castiel opened his eyes for the third time in the hour to see the teenager was fidgeting like a new initiate. Completely untamed and not really willing to even
“Alright, alright, so what is it you really like about this guy?” Because of his paranoia, this was the first time he had actually met a fully-trained Jedi, and the way the man had looked at and through Dean had been as disconcerting as it had been thrilling. It had felt… what was a more manly word for naughty?
The mess was big enough for a hundred people, but they all sat at the two tables closest to the serving counter, where Benny was throwing together rations and canned dietary necessities together into something edible enough. They had been out of fresh food for weeks now and everyone was not only looking forward to getting Sam back for a bit, but also loading up the cargo holds with new eats and refreshing the hydroponics bay with seedlings.
Castiel smiled against the scruff of Dean’s cheek. He stroked Dean harder, longer, breathed into Dean’s ear that one gruff word. “
They watched from the skywalk as the Wayward Sun came to a rumbling yet smooth landing, its radiant blue exterior contrasting dramatically with the pervasive dirty steel of the city-planet. The corvette was huge and looked to be armed well. It was hard to reconcile the monstrosity with a slick barricade runner.
Dean was torn between getting lost in the penetrating attention of the Jedi Master and the hand that Castiel kept against the Impala. Castiel was not wearing his gloves, which after day one the Jedi had on constantly. Dean remembered in scary detail what that bared hand in his own had felt like. He sucked on his bottom lip to bite at it before he decided to keep his eyes focused somewhere neutral. “Yeah, that’s my baby.” Neutral turned out to be Castiel’s chest, which was only adorned in plain tunic made of some sort of soft material that conformed well to the muscles it hid.
Dean took another swig of the firebrand depressant and shook away the immediate memories that cropped up at even the vague thought of their parents. “Just want to know where his mind is at for you, Sammy. You know I worry. I don’t think it’s a good thing that he picked you to train just because you’re talented.”
Now Castiel found himself exactly where he wanted to be. He could have ignored this desire—could even have torn from his mind the memory of their first meeting and the spark of interest it ignited. Castiel could easily have just ended it all as if Dean had never happened into his life.
“Master, could we go now? I want to be there when they anchor.” Sam was standing as well, a good five inches taller than Castiel.
Cas nodded and reached for him, pulling Dean into his chest and tucking Dean’s head under his chin. This felt right. Dean adjusted enough to make it perfect. His Jedi pulled up the cover over them both. Middle of the day cycle and Dean was exhausted enough to fall right to sleep.
It was not a smart idea to be out of control around a Jedi, so that’s why Dean had resorted to his last defense. Mechanical work and very loud music.
But there was Dean’s hand extended to him and with it, was the absolute most ridiculously beautiful smile. Even with every thought completely under control, that smile made Castiel respond by taking hold of the proffered touch. The man was a work of art and he wanted to know more.
Jo and Bobby, the senior ranked members of Dean's crew along with Jo's mom Ellen, were down in the mess with a steadily growing accompaniment of the rest of the Hunters. They took on odd jobs from smuggling to bounty hunting, and even legit side business when the illegal stuff was scarce or not paying well.
“There isn’t much to tell. He’s very serious and very practical. Even if the codes of conduct for Jedi have been loosened in the New Order, he just kind of reminds me of the stories of the old ways, when Jedi couldn’t have personal connections or feel any emotion too extreme, even happiness.”
Castiel went with the motion, resigned to pleasure, and alighted his hands to Dean’s hips to gently ride there as the rogue rode
“Not to… uh, offend or anything—but how long do you plan on staring at me like that?” Then the man made the same gesture his younger brother was prone to, carding his fingers through his hair and resting the hand on the back of his neck.
The music shushed to the level of muted conversation and Dean straightened to turn back towards Castiel.
Castiel shifted just enough to look at him. “You called me Cas. I liked it. I’d like it if you called me Cas hereafter.”
Castiel had inhaled so sharply, at first Dean had thought he was in pain, but those ultramarine eyes told a different story in their intensity. “Captain?”
His title had never been said with that much husk and rumble. Dean felt the shock of it up his spine. “Dean. Just Dean.” He dropped the Jedi’s hands then, feeling as if he had held on to them any longer he was going get a fever.
Exposed to the heated air and free, Dean’s cock swelled to a rise, inviting attention. Castiel’s hand found the shaft unerringly and relieved the fierce need in Dean by squeezing the tender flesh in a stroke.
This, this pressure was perfect. Every angle and curve met and complimented. Their cocks seeking each other to grind mercilessly. He was going to come just off this and their pants hadn’t even been dismissed yet. “Fuck me, Cas.” The words came out strangled in a growl.
[“I really like Castiel as a teacher. The Council warned me that we might have communication issues, but it hasn’t been a problem. He’s just… very literal. I can’t wait to show you the saber I made. Thank you... for letting me use Mom’s amulet, I know how much it meant to you, but I got something that you might like to hold on to in its place?”] The holo of his brother’s youthful face was silent for a few seconds as the next words were considered and weighed. [“I miss you, Dean. I love you.”]
He carded his hand through Dean’s hair. Something in this man was broken horribly. It was more than the troubled family life Sam had alluded to. It was more than a life on the wrong side of the law. That darkness was ingrained in Dean. It was never going to go away no matter how brightly he shined.
The implications were not something he was willing to think about, so he sat at the edge of the bed, and crossed his legs. He closed his eyes to concentrate on the itchiness of the dried cum across his bare stomach, easily falling into a strange state of eroticism and calm meditation.
He gave it serious thought. From the message, Dean couldn’t tell a difference in Sam’s personality at all, only that he had aged into a young man physically. The total number of messages though, in the five years that Sam had been away at the Jedi Temple, were too small a number to really judge any change.
Charlie bounced in her seat, talking to her food as much as the rest of the room at large. “No, no, we could use it as a selling point so that we can take on more ferry jobs.” She shoved around the green mush at the center of her tray. “And we could have a schedule to use the room and I can make a bunch of programs for group entertainment. I could easily design one to look like a five star on Gilatter VIII.”
Tick. Tick. Tick. He stalked the cells, punished the silent, burned the tear ducts of the pleading. Each being that was belted to his archaic metal rack screamed or screeched. He made them beg. He made them regress to animals unaware of any language that would be enough to end the pain.
It was exactly ten minutes later when a tepid cloth was brushed over his abs, abrading the mess there and cleansing his skin. He kept his eyes closed, appreciating the detail from his other senses that registered Dean’s presence with comprehensive accuracy. A little more composed, but in every way fierce.
The worst part was that his crew had taken notice. And every single one of them had joined in for a big game of, ‘Get the Captain Laid.’ The game mostly consisted of vacating the room to leave Dean and Castiel alone together.
“Hell, I could imagine it. Six years away from here and I was damn near crazy with homesickness. Your room is how you left it, by the way, though you’ve probably grown out of the old pop culture shit. And the bed too, jeez you’ve grown.” Dean took out a hidden flask from his bottom desk drawer and took a swig. He offered to share, but Sam refused it. Some things didn’t change after all. “So, talk to me.”
He still didn’t understand until Dean withdrew, hands sliding away until their hands together were the only remaining contact. Dean was tugging gently, with a suggestive grin that said much more than words ever would. They were going to go somewhere. Somewhere that they wouldn’t have to stop until they had found bliss.
“It’s true.” She insisted “I’ve had people get up and walk away before. I don’t hook them to the rig until the second day because if they want out they get out within the first 24 hours. I give people the reality they want.”
“Goodbye Dean.” Cas said before throwing him against the wall to protect Dean from the Empty and Death. Leaving a bloody handprint on Dean’s jacket.
Crowley laughed and vanished. Dean was conflicted. He could remember human him loving the angel, but was unsure how he felt now. Eventually Dean picked up the phone.
“These four locations are caves in or near town. After talking with Diana I think the most likely candidate is that one.” Dean said pointing to a location on the map covered by a green M&M.
Sam rushed to the mouth of the cave. It had a wide mouth, and luckily for Sam the passages weren’t too narrow. He still had to crawl, but it wasn’t a tight squeeze. He went down into the cave and found a room where he could stand up. He found blood leading to a passageway off to the side. Inside the next room he saw a figure on the floor. Sam slid over to inspect the figure, and after seeing no movement he turned on his flashlight. He instantly recognized the figure as Brett Marsh, the missing boy from Jackson Mississippi. There was no pulse.
“Sammy?” Dean asked and opened his mouth to say something else, but couldn’t think of the right question.
“They chalk it up to animal attacks, people getting lost and not finding their way back, or exposure.”
“I remember the nightmares the Djinn showed me. But after the last vision of you and Cas in the cave with me there’s nothing.”
Dean and Cas were sitting in Baby outside the motel. They were heading over to the hospital when Dean spoke up.
“It seems to be steady.” Cas continued “without the mark I’ve been able to figure out how my abilities work now. With Chuck actively going against the angels we have less grace and it appears to generate more slowly.”
“NOT WHEN I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A DECADE.” Sam called back but this time it went ignored by the lovers.
After fifteen minutes Sam spoke up “got one. Man murdered in his office. All door and windows locked and no sign of a break in.”
“I’d think the Djinn would target the opposite. A content teen is not the easiest prey. They’re always with friends or family or they’re busy with something. Point is a happy kid doesn’t just wander into a remote location alone.”
“C‘mon Cas. You need to get out just as much as we do.” Sam gave Castiel the puppy dog eyes that few people could refuse.
“Dean that wasn’t your fault. It was my choice to go under, and I would’ve done it with it without your permission.”
“Dean’s always kept his emotions close to his chest, and he dealt. Not in healthy ways, but he dealt. Now the hits are coming so fast and hard that he just can’t rebound. Not as fast as he’d like to.” Sam opened his mouth to say more, but promptly shut it.
Truthfully he was glad to be getting out of the bunker, but he was worried to spend time with Dean. Not that he didn’t want to, but because he was afraid of any conversations that might ensue. Any mention of love or their marriage had the potential to end his life. Cas accepted his fate, but he couldn’t do that to Dean. The older Winchester was not known for moving on, letting go, or forgiving. If the Empty came for him he knew Dean would find a way to blame himself, and he’d carry that for the rest of his life.
“To bring Jack back I made a deal with the empty. When I experienced a moment of true happiness she would come and take me. Well the night I died Billie was at the door. I put up warding, but it wasn’t enough and we both knew it. Knowing our only shot at killing Billie was the empty. I confessed my feelings for Dean and just saying aloud felt so good and freeing. It was the happiest I’d ever been so the empty came. She took Billie, and then she took me.”
Sam sat with Dean all throughout the night while Cas paced behind Sam. Eventually Sam passed out still in the chair next the the bed Dean lay in.
“Charlie dropped me a line on a djinn case. They’ve been able to confirm it’s a loner. I’m going to go take care of it. Should be a day or two tops.”
Sam was about to answer when he looked up and smiled. Dean turned his head and followed his brother’s gaze. His eyes landed on a short man in a beige trench coat.
“Cas I lost a part of myself the day you died. I loved you so much. You were my best friend and I think in some other life we could’ve been more. It’s all my fault. I’m sorry Cas. I’m sorry that I was such a prideful dick, and I’m sorry that you’ll never hear this.” Dean paused “listen to me ramble to a figment of my imagination as if it fixes any of the harm I caused you. Your love for me is what killed you, and I’ll never forgive myself.”
“More like an office. But Sam could stay in the house and we could stay in the van, if that’s something you want to do.”
“Shh. Let me. I love you. So much. I don’t think I was doing anything except doing what I thought I was supposed to be doing before I met you. I went to school, I studied, I ate, I slept. I didn’t do anything. And then you showed up, and suddenly I had things to do besides think about school. I had a friend. And then friends, plural. You’re like, like a bright, shining light that everyone but you can see. You changed everything for me, and I wouldn’t take back a second of my time with you.”
The men and women in scrubs bustle her onto the gurney, and someone’s already waiting with another blood test. They check it and then someone jabs her in the thigh with what Cas explains is glucagon, and they take her into the hospital. Dean and Cas stand there for a moment staring after her until Cas turns to him and gives him a hug.
There’s a bed that appears to be a full-size mattress about four feet off the ground. There’s a counter along one side with a little sink, a stovetop, and a small oven. Castiel even spots a little fridge. There are cupboards and cabinets and little spots to stow things so they don’t shift around too much if you were to drive. There’s a tabletop with a tablet folded up on it, along with a few of Dean’s textbooks.
While they walked around their little neighborhood in the Castro, Dean thought back to what it had been like right after he had decided to really try to get better, for Castiel’s sake. It certainly didn’t happen right away, but Dean and his therapist set small goals for him, and it seemed to be working.
and the fan was going so slow he must have over-concentrated on it because he’s about to zone. God fucking damn it all to hell, where the fuck is his kit?
Dark hair-Blue eyes looks up, and Dean is somewhat caught in the stare, only realizing a second later that he had asked a question.
“Get some rest, Dean. I’ll talk to you later,” he raises his hand to rest reassuringly on Dean’s shoulder, but Dean avoids it by dodging, moving away from Cas in the opposite direction. The move hurts him enough to speak up, knowing Dean may not like what he has to say.
“Do you think you can sleep?” Cas's forehead is doing that thing where it creases in concern, and it warms something inside Dean’s chest.
Dean leads his brother into the kitchen, where Sam and Bobby greet each other with a back-slapping hug. Sam turns to Cas and holds out his hand. “Nice to meet you. Cas, I take it?”
Dean passes the bowl and lighter over to Charlie, who breathes deeply and coughs a bit on her exhale.
It relieves Dean, a little. He had soothed Cas’ worries in the car, but Dean was worried about the same things. What if this little dog just doesn’t like him?
“Should’ve gotten paid upfront, fag.” He must see Dean’s intention to fight back, so he throws a sucker punch into Dean’s left cheek, and a second one to his stomach. “Don’t even try, whore. If you’re a good boy, I might even send a couple more guys your way, how about that?”
“I dunno. He should, he’s awesome,” he gives another soft look to the lightly snoring man leaning on his shoulder, “way too good to be hanging around with my sorry ass.”
. Dean knows he’s not to leave his brother alone. John settles in to wait for his oldest, while Sam tries to make excuses for him.
“But your pop heard about it and ran, didn’t he? He was really good at keeping you under the radar, but every few months you’d pop back up. I always find you again, kiddo. And now, I’m gonna make you mine.”
Later, the phone in the room rings. Sammy is across the room to pick up the phone by the second ring, but Dean makes him wait.
Cas launches into the story of their background, telling Sam about Recoult, his brother, and how he and Dean have very similar subjects they’re studying, though there’s a different concentration. While he tells the story, he takes hold of Dean’s hand under the table. Dean blushes, but he feels a warm rush of reassurance. How Cas can be so confident, Dean will never understand. Cas and Dean are actually very close in age, for all that Cas is a doctoral student and Dean is still an undergrad.
He likes girls. He likes their curves, how soft they can be. He loves their wetness when they’re aroused and ready for him. He likes the way they taste, and he likes the way their hair feels when he’s holding onto it during a blowjob. He’s usually stronger than them, so he can lift them and move them how he wants when they’re together. They make him feel strong. Women are soft, and pretty, and he loves them.
When they enter the room, the guy, whose name tag says “Armand” tells him to turn around. He gets a palmful of Dean’s ass while tugging his pants down below it, and Dean hears him unbuckling his belt. He hears a condom wrapper (thank god for small miracles), and a moment later, hands are on him, and a dick is sliding into his under-prepared asshole. Dean had stretched himself a little bit before leaving for the night, but that had been hours ago, and most of the lube has long since dried up. Whatever condom Armand wrapped his dick in is lubed, but it’s not enough that Dean doesn’t feel some pain. He grits his teeth, and bears down, trying to make it easier on himself.
An hour into the movie,  her phone buzzes. She doesn’t hear it, and it buzzes three more times before Dean nudges her with his foot.
“Oh, hey, Cas. What are you doing here?” As Cas walks towards Dean, his headache seems to let up, slightly. The minty smell definitely has a hint of eucalyptus, and it feels soothing when he breathes it into his sinuses.
“You and Daphne will become a couple this summer. If all goes well, you can be engaged by the time you’re finished with your Pastoral Program,” she doesn’t seem to notice that Castiel has frozen in place, because she’s still talking. “...and I spoke to the admissions counselor at Liberty University, Castiel, she hasn’t received your confirmation yet, even though I know I told you to put it in the mail last week.”
“You heard from Dad?” He almost doesn’t want to know the answer. Did his dad ditch him without a second thought, or did he call Bobby to at least make sure Dean was okay?
When Cas comes to bed that night after unsuccessfully trying to get Dean to eat dinner, he lays down on the bed facing his boyfriend.
“Are the laws of thermodynamics actually funny, or did I miss something?” She whispered over to Dean.
Dean does roll his eyes this time and leans back on the palms of his hands behind him. “I ain’t injured.”
Sam’s hand is suddenly on his shoulder, restraining. “He doesn’t really like to be touched.” The physical touch, combined with the proximity of a Sentinel that he resonates with so strongly gives him an up-close picture of how Sam’s feeling, and he’s definitely worried. And hopeful? There’s a fierce protectiveness there, as well, but it’s secret. He keeps it hidden from his brother, and Castiel is left wondering why.
Bobby stays for a few minutes to help Dean put some of the furniture away, but it’s clear Dean’s done talking for the night. He’s barely awake, dragging his feet, even stumbles a couple of times, Bobby reaching out a hand to catch him, but Dean rights himself each time.
Charlie tries to talk to him again, Benny gives him concerned looks while he attends yoga classes—at odd times, so that he doesn’t bump into Cas—, Sam and Jess make him come over for dinner. Jess tries to bolster him and convince him that Cas will want to go on a date with Dean. Charlie finally corners him and tells him he’s being an idiot, that she loves him, and that Cas will definitely want to date him.
On the following Tuesday, Dean’s got his 101 class. Which is filled with freshmen, finally settled into campus and university life now they’re in their second semester. Dean likes teaching the second semester better. The first semester is filled with kids whose high school teachers had told them all shit like, “You’re not going to be able to get away with this in college!” Dean has always found this hilarious. Only in college will you encounter a professor who decides your final exam will be getting a drink at the bar off-campus.
“Then Garth’ll have ‘em there tomorrow,” Bobby sips coffee, and acknowledges, “it ain’t gonna be easy. Hearing things and reading ‘em are different. But I think we’ll get through it. I might not have gone to college, but I’m no slouch, son.”
“Do you ever have hyper- or hyposensitive episodes?” When Dean nods, Balthazar follows up. “How long do they last?”
“I can’t, actually,” she grins, and Dean realizes why she’s wearing dark sunglasses. She’s blind. Dean just yelled at a blind person. He’s going to hell for sure.
“That’s what I thought. You little whores are so thirsty for cock, even getting short-changed doesn’t stop you, huh?”
. Alastair turns on the blowtorch and heats his knife. When he glances at Dean, he gives a wicked smile.
Dean looks over at his wide blue eyes. The zone seems to have stopped, but he can feel himself teetering on the edge of the drop that happens so often after these almost-zones. “It’s fine, I promise. The blade is mostly clean, and I have alcohol wipes in here,” he gives Cas a shaky smile. How has tonight gotten so out of control? Dean sits down on the bed. He stares at the ground and waits for the inevitable sound of the door closing behind Cas. He knew that it was all going to end eventually, but he didn’t think it would be tonight. And he feels strangely calm about it. Like all of his emotions have been emptied out by one little cut. Cas must have seen the cigarette burns. They're faded, but they're still there. And he can't dredge up a whole lot of emotion about it.
“I get by. Coffee isn’t usually a problem. I eat a lot of protein bars,” Dean smiles winningly. “You don’t have to worry about me.” Besides, he finds if he wears himself out with running or work, keeps busy with yoga classes, his brain doesn’t even have the energy to process the sensory information his food is giving him, which makes it much easier to ignore. And the Sensinull helps by taking away some of the information to process, usually. It hasn’t been as effective lately, is all.
Dean considers himself broken. This is why he won’t accept a Guide. This is why he takes a dosage of Sensinull that’s nearly four times the recommended dose. He was taught the beliefs of a psychopath and has been left to his own devices as a kind,
When they first learned of Dean’s senses as a Sentinel, it was presented to them as a blessing. Dean had a bright future in front of him, doors open for Sentinels because of their superior senses; they tend to be more intuitive, they work in elite teams in various levels of law enforcement, they’re the best surgeons in the world, the best of the best of the best in almost every field.
The other thing Dean feels badly about here is that he’s basically using Cas. Almost everything he eats makes him feel nauseated and occasionally he feels bad enough that he’ll throw up, but around Cas, he can almost eat like a normal person. The feeling that he’s been using this friendship to make himself feel not-so-sick in the last several weeks when he’s so unbalanced, turns his stomach, but he’s gotta eat.
“As a doctor in this hospital, Castiel has access to patient files. But I think you know as well as I do that he would never look at those files without express permission.”
“We should, uh. Shower.” Dean’s voice is a little hoarse, but for once, Cas can sense that he’s content, not over-analyzing, not thinking he’s not good enough, not even working hard to filter the outside world, and Castiel’s eyes are closed, but even if he couldn’t feel Dean’s smile where his mouth is pressed against Cas's temple, he’d know it was there.
“I don’t fucking know!” They look reddish-purple to him. How is he supposed to know the name of every single color?
They got no right. He puts his cigarette out on his son’s arm, still laying on the floor like a goddamn pussy, and goes to bed.
He doesn’t sleep much on Sunday night, either. Those same thoughts keep running through his head. By Monday morning, he’s 100% sure he’s about to be kicked out of school. Dad’s impatient, trying to get them out of the house early so that he can meet with whoever he’s meeting. Dean’s silent, insides churning over the anticipation of the unknown.
“Yeah,” he feels a little defensive of his answer, and can’t stop himself from asking, “I mean, doesn’t everyone, sometimes?”
“I think we’re going to have to send it with a confirmation number again because goodness knows you can’t trust--”
“Just sore muscles.” Dean doesn’t move. He’s not touch-sensitive today, but he generally avoids contact. Just in case.
Azazel Gelbman. The man’s name had been mentioned often during Alastair White’s trial, having been the general physician for many of the children Alastair preyed on, but there was never anything concrete on him that was ever brought forward, as far as he knows. He knew the man was practicing still, but he hadn’t ever encountered one of the man’s patients. There were rumors, of course, that Gelbman was one of those who prescribed Oxycontin like candy, that if you needed a doctor to overlook certain conditions or sign a waiver without a visit, Gelbman was the one to call. But they were all rumors, nothing substantiated. Castiel met the man himself once at a pharmaceutical dinner, and it’s safe to say that Gelbman is everything Castiel hates in a doctor. All Castiel could do was have him removed from their list of suggested medical providers in the area. And to find out that Dean is his patient?
3. I'm peppermiints-please on tumblr, come say hello! I also sporadically update a tumblr where I rec fics I've read, collectallthefanfiction.
This lead to Dean and Castiel both being more prepared for the upcoming physics exam than they had been for any previous exams. They both wanted to prove the other wrong about who would need help the most during the exam.
“Fine. See you soon.” Dean looks over at the cat, now sitting up on the backrest of the couch staring at Dean as he walks around the room. It really is a tiny thing, probably barely weighs 2 pounds. It’s on the fluffy side with a little pink nose and funny ears that don’t seem to stand straight up. “Sorry, dude, but Frederick is a bad name for a cat.”
Dean doesn’t let Cas’s touch linger. They’ve kissed, but only a little. Small pecks, nothing more than that first kiss which was mind-blowing for a kiss without even using tongues, Jesus, fuck, but Dean won’t allow for more of that, and he can tell Cas is a little frustrated; every time Dean moves away from him, Dean’s sure it’s another tick in the “Dean Is Too Much Work” column. Dean allows for hand-holding because he can’t always say he’s feeling it too much to get out of it and spare Cas’s feelings, and Cas is probably trying to spare Dean’s feelings anyway. He’s nice like that.
“I’m not angry with you, Dean. I’m pissed off that you ever had to do that! I’m fucking incensed that your father-- did he know? Did he know that when he left you and your brother alone that’s what you had to do?”
“Sure was. Glad to see you up and talking. Now, we got most of the information we need from Alastair’s journals, and, I’m sorry, this may be difficult to hear, but he recorded some of the time that he spent with you.”
Sam keeps inviting him places, and Cas keeps showing up. Jess suggests inviting him to yoga, and Dean gives a non-answer. Dean pretends he doesn’t notice how well they get along when Dean drops his walls just a bit, and he pretends he doesn’t notice the looks he gets from Castiel that he definitely isn’t giving in return. When they share a surprised laugh at Sam’s expense sitting in his backyard, Dean sobers quickly and practically runs to help Jess with dishes in the kitchen. He’s not supposed to be getting attached or noticing blue eyes and cheekbones, and that jawline with just a touch of facial hair…
Dean is still sluggish, though the epinephrine has woken him some, and he visibly objects to Castiel’s removal when an orderly attempts to have Castiel move in order to get Dean to his new room. Cas glares at the orderly, stubbornly attaching himself back to Dean’s forearm, attempting to remain in contact with the Sentinel, mitigating the sensory input he knows will be extreme post-zone while reassuring Dean that he won’t be going anywhere.
Cas sat on the other side of Sam and grabbed his other hand. He didn’t ask about the doctor using the term husband. Cas figured it was better if he didn’t know.
Sam sighed “it’s just Dean had finally given himself permission to lower the wall he’s always held between the two of you. The both of you were so happy together, and Dean was happier than I’d seen him in a long time. But then we...” Sam trailed off
After a day of mostly sleeping Dean was more alert and aware of his surroundings. He couldn’t remember much from the day before. He must’ve lost a lot of blood to the Djinn. He thought. Dean stumbled to the kitchen to go get something to eat, and found Sam sitting lost in thought.
When they arrived in Dodge City three hours later it was 11pm so checked into motel so they could sleep before getting started on the case. The brothers shared one room and the angel had the room next door. Sam had tried to convince Cas to stay in their room, but he refused.
That night he fell asleep still crying. He once again found himself back in the dream. He was so happy to once again be living his perfect life, and even though he knew he was dreaming Dean found himself lost in it. When the morning came he stayed asleep for as long as he could, and when he woke up he tried to go back to sleep. All in a futile attempt to hold on. He found tears running down his cheeks once more. All he’d ever wanted was to be happy, and when he’d finally found his true happiness it all came tumbling down.
“No it makes perfect sense.” Sam said continuing when he received a puzzled look from the angel. “The lengths you go for him, and how lost he is without you. It’s so obvious even a blind man could see how much you love each other.”
“Oh Sammy do yourself a favor and stop looking. You won’t like what else comes down this road.” The line went dead.
Sam spent hours finding his way out of the cave. After a deep search he realized Dean wasn’t there, and there was no one else in the cave. After eight hours from when he entered he found his way out. Silently promising to come back for Brett’s body after he found Dean and the other kids.
But there was no time for further discussion because they turned onto the road near the site, and Dean had to hide. A minute later Sam pulled onto the property and parked. He was quickly greeted by the owners. They were an older couple, late 40s at the youngest and late 50s at the oldest. He thought they seemed nice, but wondered if perhaps they were working with the Djinn. Nothing could be ruled out yet. He sent Dean a quick text.
“I don’t take more than I need. Besides the people I take choose to die. I give them enough to start producing dreams, but not enough to make them lose touch with reality. If someone stays in their dream world then that tells me they’d rather be dead than alive and I’m doing them a favor.”
He saw other memories too. Lucifer wearing Sam killing Cas in Stull Cemetery, Cas choosing Crowley over them, and the time Cas had died as a human.
After a few minutes of hacking into credit cards the boys donned the fed suits again and drove to the hotel where Diana and her family were staying. They walked in and saw the girl. Sam approached her with Dean close behind.
When they got back to the bunker Sam shook him awake, and when Dean woke up in Baby he shrugged off Sam and Cas and raced to his bedroom where he locked the door and cried. He wanted that life so bad he’d gotten lost in it, and now that he was awake and back in the real world he longed for the dream so much it hurt.
Then he was in the next part of the same memory. Wrapping up Cas in the white curtains from the house and placing him into the pyre. Then while driving back to the bunker Dean stopped near a meadow.
“So they’re all between the ages of 16 and 18. Described by parents as ‘happy with a bright future ahead.’ So I’m thinking we’ve got a Djinn with a taste for opportune teenagers? I’ve never heard of a Djinn with a preference, but we’ve seen weirder.” Sam explained
“It’s foolproof. This will work. All you have to do is keep the owners occupied. I’ll be able to sneak through the woods and get to the caves. The only hole in this plan is you driving my car.”
“Dean?” Sam said “Dean!” He said shaking his brother gently and his voice getting louder with desperation. He couldn’t lose his brother. Not now. Not when they finally had a chance.
“Ok I’m gonna go now. I think you two have a lot of catching up to do.” Sam said practically running from the room.
The hunter didn’t know what to think. He was pretty sure after seeing Sam the Djinn was gone. So what was this? His imagination? A dream his mind came up with? Maybe the Djinn wasn’t actually gone? Dean didn’t know, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He was seeing and getting to talk to Castiel.
Dean was further taken aback when the angel leaned in for a kiss. Although it broke his heart the Winchester stopped him.
“The mark wouldn’t let me die. Crowley took me because he thought I’d become a demon, but apparently that only works if you kill your brother. I managed to slip Crowley.” Dean took a breath “Cas I need you.”
“Sammy!” Dean yelled starting towards his brother but the ghost was already making his way towards Cas and Dean.
They gazed into each other’s eyes communicating in seconds what they’d failed to say for a life time.
The boys arrived back at the bunker. The drive was mostly silent. No one had any idea of what to say or how to act. Cas was back, but he was now within reach of the Empty so they had no choice but to tread carefully.
“Sure it does.” Dean argued grabbing the now cold coffee he’d grabbed when Cas made him leave the room. “So how’s the healing going?” He asked in a more serious tone.
“Well there’s an equal mix of men and women, all different backgrounds, but the locals and tourists I’ve met who disappeared all seem to be lost, lonely, depressed, or heartbroken in a way.”
Meanwhile at the bunker Sam and Cas were digging through texts that might have anything to say regarding the Empty. Eventually Cas could tell Sam needed a break so he stood up and went to the liquor cabinet in the room. He grabbed the hardest liquor he could find and two glasses.
“It’s tragic. The girl was a bright young teenager, and the others have load of potential as well. I’m praying everyday for their safety.”
Upon hearing movement the younger Winchester snapped to attention. Dean sat in the chair across from his brother.
The boys were sitting at the table doing research on the Empty. Dean had never been one for research that was Sam’s territory. He just never had the patience for it. Even then it wasn’t necessarily the research he minded. He was going crazy between tiptoeing around Cas and making sure Sam doing ok. Cas had been able to fully heal the damage, but it wasn’t a clean no scars remaining type fix anymore. There was a potential for reinjury. Suddenly his phone went off. Charlie.
The next morning Dean came to before Sam. He jolted awake unsure of where he was. This startled Sam awake.
“Oh Cas” Sam whispered. Upon closer inspection he realized the wounds on Castiel’s body were not made by an angel blade. “Dean...” Sam’s voice broke upon the realization that this was no ordinary demon. This was Dean. Dean was a demon. How? He didn’t know or care, but he had to find his brother.
Sam carried Cas to the car and put him in the backseat. He’d have a hunter’s funeral back at the bunker.
“He appears to be stable. He was lucky to take a hit hard enough to fragment the skull, but not suffer any internal or external bleeding.”
Cas nodded and the two carefully loaded Sam in the back of the Impala and drove to the nearest hospital. Once Cas and Dean were through the doors Sam was loaded onto a stretcher and a few ER doctors took him in to survey the damage, and perform an operation if necessary.
“Well, just get to know him. You’ll see, there’s nothing to be wary of.” Delighted with the turn in the conversation, Sam spun around in the chair once more, before putting on his stoic Jedi face and making his way out of the office to do whatever it was that Jedi do.
The Wayward Sun was restocked, the crew was back on board, and they had the clear for lift-off. Everyone and everything was pretty much set to go, so when Dean pulled his brother aside for some privacy, he did it without guilt and with full confidence that his crew didn’t need him to hover.
Then Dean was with him. Hot and messy with the filthy slide of his tongue against Castiel’s. Dean’s hands went from his neck to cup his jaw and pulled him into an angle that satisfied them both.
A beep from behind him and the swoosh of the automatic blaster doors heralded the entry of his relief. Dean turned to see Ellen walk in with a cannister of flavored stimulant and the most characteristic grimace she could manage.
It certainly explained the sleep-aids. He had only caught a hint of what comprised the darkness that had corrupted Dean’s aura, but it was enough. There was more to Dean than Castiel had initially garnered. Nothing about what he had sensed in the sleeping man had ever suggested that such evil lurked within. By all rights, Dean should not have been able to lock away that vile part so thoroughly that everything left seemed utterly pure.
Still looking at the sky, Castiel nodded to confirm Sam’s assumption. “Discipline can be learned where talent cannot. You’re still young, Samuel, I begrudge you not for your excitement. I’m only disappointed at your shallow attempt to contain it.” Honestly, the teen’s aura was crackling with the energy of it. Castiel had to put up new layers of protection to keep a headache from developing.
In the dim light of the bedroom and with a view of the stars from the wide viewport, Castiel traced shapes of constellations with the freckles on Dean’s left shoulder and smiled.
He was rooting for Dean and Cas, and of course he was curious to see how it played out. But he worried it would go from a chick flick to a soap opera. And Sam didn’t need to watch a soap opera.
“I can feel Sam calling out. Unintentionally, but something’s wrong.” Jack closed his eyes focusing on the SOS he was receiving. He looked up with worry in his eyes “it’s Dean I think he’s dying.”
“Dean!” Sam cried running over and pulling the needle out of his brother and administering the Djinn cure.
The next day Dean started scouting for the Djinn. It wasn’t a normal case so he didn’t have to go undercover. Well not undercover as law enforcement at least. All he needed to do was act like a tourist.
In a few minutes Sam had cracked it “ok it appears she has a best friend Diana Knight. The two were talking the day before Bianca disappeared. Damn you were right. The amount of shit they’re both hiding from their parents is insane, and I’m not that far in.”
Sam was expecting as much, and it made him want to call Cas in right then. But he knew Dean would only think he was still trapped.
Dean turned and grabbed his brother’s hand. All the words died in his throat so he held onto Sam’s limp hand like a lifeline.
At a bar he started talking to a local about the best places to go hiking. The man, Jerry, pulled out a map.
“Sam you almost died. The doctors said you’d never wake up. Luckily we have an angel on our side. But even then I almost lost you, and I can’t go through that. Not again.”
“Yes. Castiel’s blood is on your hands. Dean may have dealt the blow, but if it weren’t for you my brother wouldn’t have even been in Portland in the first place! He would’ve been here at the bunker already cured! With me and Cas” Sam’s voice started cracking before he turned away.
They kissed once more, and neither of them could’ve imagined a more perfect start the the epilogue that was the rest of their lives.
“Oh would you look at that Cas. A monster lying to save their life.” Sam said in a half hearted attempt at a joke
He allowed himself a small sigh of relief when he found it. The pulse was weak, but it was there. Not to mention they literally had an angel on their side. He looked to the blood pooled around his brother’s head than back at the angel.
“Why that one? Arya’s body was found closer to this one.” Sam said pointing to a location marked with a red M&M
“She goes to summer camp here. It’s one of the few places she feels happy, and I’ve seen the photos. She doesn’t smile the same anywhere else. When I see camp photos I see her happier than she’s been in years. I see who she was before her parents told her who she should be.”
“Mostly. We have to be careful not to jostle his head, but he doesn’t need any of the life support. He’ll be fine.”
“There’s nothing more they can do for him. According to the file I talked her into handing me the only thing wrong with Sam is his head, but it’s extensive. He won’t wake up.”
“Hi Sam.” Ignoring the confused look on the younger brother’s face the angel turned to Dean. “What happened?”
Periodically throughout the three hours Cas used grace to continue repairing the damage to Sam’s head.
Dean found the Djinn cave easily enough, but it was empty. He decided to take a walk and scout the surrounding area. Surprisingly there were more nests, but they were just as empty as the first one he’d stumbled upon. Maybe the Djinn kept moving?
“Is Dean alright?” Cas asked “I know things have been rough recently, and something about the Djinn case hit him particularly hard. But we’re all alive which is more than we can usually say.”
Six hours later Cas woke up, made his way to Sam’s room. Unsurprisingly he found Dean asleep in the chair next to Sam. Cas tiptoed around them and used his newly regenerated grace to finish healing the younger brother.
“Here we go.” Dr. Walsh, the coroner, said bringing out the victim’s body. “Meet Arya Taylor age eighteen. Whole life ahead of her, and she disappears only to turn up dead a week later.”
“Sam I can’t tell you how much I wish things were different, but I have to be honest if I could go back in time and turn down the deal I wouldn’t do it. Jack was my-our son, and I had to save him.”
“Cas don’t you see we’re meant to be? With this thing on my arm and you being an angel we’ll never have to say goodbye.”
“Four teenagers. With absolutely nothing in common. No mutual friends, no former schools together, not anything except this camp. They all came here for many summers, in fact they were all counselors in training here last summer. So why did you only mention Arya?”
“You’ve talked about eternity before, but tell me again. Now that it’ll be you and me” With that Dean leaned over to kiss the angel and Cas fell into it. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain between his ribs. Cas stumbled back.
“Dean with Chuck against the angels, in particular me my grace is not what it used to be. Even with the mark gone my healing abilities are not the miracles they once were. But they’re not non-existent. I was able to stop the bleeding and somewhat repair the crack in his skull.”
“BECAUSE YOU’RE BOTH OBLIVIOUS IDIOTS WHO ARE TOO PRIDEFUL TO USE THEIR DAMN WORDS.” Sam called from outside the doorway. Ok maybe he did want to stick around for this potential soap opera.
Cas nodded and they started carrying Dean out when suddenly a woman with a ton of swirling tattoos dropped in front of them. It was the Djinn. The boys set Dean down as quickly and carefully as they could and reached for their knives.
The angel left the room to go take a nap. He didn’t usually need sleep, but with how fast he was burning through the little grace he needed it. Besides sleep would help the grace regenerate faster.
Dean laughed and held the first blade in the air above the angel, but before he could drive in the fatal blow Cas covered Dean’s eyes. He needed to remember Dean. His Dean. Not the demon that took his place. Cas felt the knife in his heart and suddenly there was nothing.
Dean entered the cave. It had a wide mouth, but narrow passageways that he would have to crawl through. He crawled down, and down, and down until eventually he entered a room large enough for him to stand. He inspected the room and saw three passageways. He found a few drops of blood near the left fork and crawled through until he reached another room. This one was larger than the first. He stood up to take in his surroundings when suddenly he was hit over the head and everything went black.
Sam sprinkled a little holy water on his brother to ensure this really was Dean. When the water didn’t seem to burn Sam smiled, and ran to untie his brother.
On his way to his room Dean saw Cas. Both of them started completely avoiding eye contact, but then Dean spoke.
They quieted and headed in the direction of Sam’s hallway. After setting up Cas’s room Sam left to give him some time alone and to go find Dean. His older brother was in the main room of the bunker.
“I will don’t worry. Cas look after him please. Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid.” Dean said with a smirk
“That’s it?” Sam asked wondering wether Dean remembered the visions or what had happened in the cave after the Djinn went down.
“I have full faith in you Cas, but if your abilities are still screwy I want him to see a doctor before we take the three hour drive back to the bunker.”
“Both? I don’t know. I had some crazy dreams, but I also saw something pretty crazy when I thought I was awake. I don’t know.”
“He just called me. He’s in Portland motel room 102 across from the ‘Cheers and Beers Bar’ I’m on my there now. I’m about three hours out.”
“And you don’t know anything about them?” Bobby queries. He’s probably thinking the same thing Dad was -- Dean must have set them.
They meet a woman in her mid-twenties who laughs when Dean tells her about Cas’ stern correction of people thinking Yasha is a miniature husky, and says everyone thinks her small reddish-brown dog, Penny, is a fox.
Balthazar pulls a sheet of paper out of his folder and passes it to Dean, then gives a copy to Sam. Cas leans closer to Dean to read from his copy. “I’ve compiled a list of suggestions for limiting sensory input. Fair warning, they’re going to be a pain for now.”
He looks back at his time in high school as if he is watching it in a movie. His friend Charlie tells him things that happened, and he sort of remembers them, but not with any real clarity. But hey, the doctor had said he was fine, and so he is. He’s fine. He doesn’t even see a psychiatrist anymore. He’s
He shakes again. Dean forces himself to look at Castiel, incredulous. “C’mon, man, You’re not dumb. You know what you heard. You know what I am.”
Dean laughs. He likes the way Benny is about food-- like it’s more important than just the fuel that keeps you moving. To Benny, food is an experience.
Cas presses a kiss into the top of his head. “I hate that you’re feeling pain, but I could never hate you.”
“Yep. There’s a pretty good market for these vans if you know where to look. And I ain’t in the business of short changin’ people who already got short-changed. Deal?”
“It’s always tequila with Charlie. And Jess is… somewhere. Here, anyway. Probably convincing some poor bastard to let her help fix their wardrobe and using Dean and me as her resume.” He lifts his head, grinning, and then contorts his body so somehow he’s now got his chin resting on the armrest.  The move pulls some of the melancholy of the past away from Bobby. Despite all that shit they went through, this kid’s doing alright for himself. It eases something in Bobby to see him so lighthearted.
Dean pulls away, not out of his grasp, but just far enough to look at Cas's face. Cas isn’t crying, but he can feel that his eyes are wetter than usual, and he can see as well as feel the cautious joy because Dean finally is starting to get it. He’s understanding that Cas wants him.
Sam pouts. He folds his arms defiantly across his chest and looks out the window. A memory comes drifting to the front of his mind.
think that. I don’t mean to like, disregard your feelings, Pam says I do that sometimes, and I don’t—that’s not what I mean. I don’t know how to say it right.”
“Billie,” Cas says, a stern tone to his voice, “manners.” Dean rolls his eyes with his back turned toward his little family so Billie doesn’t see. He and Cas disagreed on the importance of the “manners” thing, but he let Cas have his way. He’d rather have his kid be overly polite than rude when push comes to shove.
He and Dean put on their shoes, and Dean grabs the umbrella. He grabs a set of keys off of a hook and leads them out into the rain. When he steers Castiel towards a garage and opens the door, Castiel is expecting to see some kind of garage apartment, not a large van.
“Uh, I didn’t realize it until he said something, but I guess I had seen him before. Didn’t know his name, though.”
“I wasn’t bleeding to death,” Bobby rolls his eyes. It makes Dean’s head hurt. “I appreciate you coming all this way, Bobby. I’m fine. Thanks. You don’t have to stay.” He looks down at his lap and fidgets with the blanket as he talks to Bobby.
“Truly, the fact that you’ve been able to come so far in life within the conditions you had available at the time is remarkable.”
“Okay. I won’t.” He watches Dean and the flat look in his eyes and a sense of sadness falls over him. “I know you’re not hungry, but if I bring you a piece of toast, do you think you can try it?”
“I guessed. You mumbled something. I could tell you were in pain, but not in pain in real life. It’s difficult to explain.”
Dean nods again, and Castiel begins to disentangle himself from Dean, slowly removing physical contact, though Dean resists somewhat, making a sound Cas knows Dean would never admit was a whimper. He’s familiar enough with the after-effects of a zone to know he needs to go slow, that forcing a Sentinel to their full senses too quickly after a zone can cause them to slip again.
“Well, you’re definitely right about this thing not being worth its sticker price. But it’s still runnin’ okay. Don’t know that I’d feel comfortable giving you less than four thousand.”
“Arugula seems to be taking to Dean quite well,” Cas says again, in his serious voice. Dean can tell it’s masking his nerves a little, but Cas has already relaxed some, seeing Dean interact with the dog. Did Cas really think Dean wouldn’t like a puppy?
Dean appreciates that Cas is holding back on being Dr. Novak when he doesn’t feel well. Dean also knows that if Cas knew about more than just the nausea thing, he wouldn’t hesitate to drag Dean’s ass into the hospital for a check-up.
Dean gives a crooked smile. He privately agrees with Cas, but he can’t take even a veiled compliment without trying to downplay it. It’s infuriating that the man won’t let him. “My dad thought it was a waste of my skills, actually. He wanted me to work for the police, in some capacity.”
Just hearing Cas say that and knowing that he means it, fills Dean with a warmth that starts in his spine and spreads through his whole body. He might never get sick of hearing Cas say it, even though it’s hard for him to accept. Cas
“And the cares that hung around me through the week seem to vanish like a gambler’s lucky streak… Hey, Deano. You awake?”
“Well, Cassie, now that you mention it, I do have a purpose.” Unsurprised, Castiel waits for his brother to continue.
“First waffle, who wants it?” Bobby leans over and snatches the plate. “Ever hear of ‘guests first’, Bobby?”
So Dean unofficially moves in with Cas. He calls it “unofficial” because it’s been years since he’s lived with another person, never mind living in one single place without wheels. It feels too final to officially move in, and part of Dean is still waiting for Castiel to decide that he’s just too much work.
Something makes Castiel pause where he normally wouldn’t, but he gives himself half a second to shake it off and approaches the ambulance doors. The moment the doors have been opened, the paramedic is relaying all pertinent information to Tessa.
“Oh and that’s your problem Castiel” Dean said nearly spitting the angel’s name “your near human emotions destroy you every single time. Your love for me has ruined your reputation with your brethren, it caused you to rebel against Heaven, and make seriously dumb choices. You see Castiel? It’s the thing you love most that destroys you.”
“Cas I have a million things I want to say to you, but I can’t think of one. Well that’s not entirely true. There’s one thing I can think of.” Dean took a breath “I love you too.”
“I don’t know what he saw. I only know his wish, but I cannot disclose that. We’re bound by the old wish rules.”
“If you’re worried you could take the drive to Flagstaff. I’d head that way, but I’m in the middle of a case in New York with Stevie.”
“Dean...” Sam started but trailed off not knowing what to say so he sat up and before Dean could push him down again he pulled his big brother into a hug which Dean returned.
“I was kinda hoping for some time alone. Just you and me. When’s the last time we had that?” Dean said
Both boys rushed to his side. Sam administered the Djinn poison cure, and unhooked him from the rig. Cas leaned over to heal him, but Sam stopped him.
Knowing they had an hour until the doctor showed up they got to work. Dean hacked the computer to turn off the alarm that would go off when the monitors were removed from Sam. Cas started carefully disconnecting wires and tubes. Dean went to go pull up the car and Cas, dressed as a doctor, got Sam to the exit. The two loaded Sam into the back of the Impala and Cas used a little grace to heal any damage moving him had caused. Then before the hospital staff realized Sam was gone they sped back to the bunker.
“No I’m alright. Hannah let me use some of hers. It’s not enough to weaken her, but it’s enough to keep me strong. No I actually called about Dean.”
Cas wanted to argue. After the manner in which he left he didn’t think his presence would be welcomed. But he had to go. Dean was potentially dying.
Everyone ignored the pained looks on Dean’s and Castiel’s faces. Previously Cas had used Dean’s room, but that wasn’t an option anymore.
Cas knew it was a bad idea, but he didn’t want Dean to be alone. So he found himself sitting next to the bed. After an hour or two Dean started stirring. Cas knew he should go, but he couldn’t tear himself away from Dean’s side.
The boys got in the Impala and drove back to the motel. When they got there they looked at the map Dean was working with earlier.
“I appreciate that Sam, but it’s ironclad only the mark of Cain could’ve saved me. Even that was only a temporary solution.”
“Dean it’s good to hear from you.” Cas took a deep breath “what happened? We thought you were dead than you disappeared. It’s been two weeks!”
“Agent Paige FBI.” Sam said holding out his badge “this camp is the only thing linking the teens so I’ll tell you again. I need to search the property.”
“We’re a long way from Denver, and this is a small town. What’s so special about Rolla?” Dean pressed
“I’m here Dean.” Cas said stepping forward to close the gap between him and Dean then he pulled the hunter into a hug.
Sam, Dean, and Cas were in the Apocalypse World, and Dean was walking with his brother and angel by his side when suddenly they heard a gunshot, and Cas let out a cry of agony.
Faintly an alarm went off in the bunker and a few minutes later Dean came back into Sam’s room. Cas sighed.
“Cas. I had a few dreams where I talked to him, but I could also swear when I was awake I saw him standing in the doorway. Were they both dreams? Or is Cas...” Dean trailed off “Cas. That was real wasn’t it? He’s alive?” Dean asked with more hope in his voice then he thought he’d ever have again.
“No you’re not. You’ve pushed yourself to the limit. How many back to back hunts have you done recently? How much sleep have you gotten in the past few weeks. Take an hour at least. Please go take care of yourself.”
Sam sighed as Dean left the room. He was seriously worried about his brother. The back to back cases on a constant basis was not unusual. They both did it when they were low. But the only thing that Sam could think of that was wearing on Dean was Castiel’s death. Dean hadn’t even said much about it. All Sam knew was the angel had saved Dean’s life, again, but he’d lost his own. Dean wouldn’t say much more.
Sam dug into research and Dean kept drinking. Before he could get properly trashed he decided to go to bed. He told himself if he wasn’t hungover then he’d be of more use to Sam tomorrow during research, but if he was honest he knew that if he got trashed he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from going to Cas and kissing him. Then the Empty would take his angel.
“When Sam comes back, do you think he will be very different?” Madison had all four of her hands clutched together, the many wooden bracelets clicking. The Codru-ji was very fond of Sam and considered herself his personal guardian. She would, considering it had been Sam that convinced their parents to bring her on board when she had nowhere else to go and was on the run from her own government.
There were certainly ethical implications about being this transfixed with the brother of his padawan, but as long as he didn’t act on it the way he wanted to, no harm would come of it.
“This is the famous Impala then?” The Jedi had stopped just short of Dean. He caressed the polished black metal of the starfighter.
He took his cum-drenched hand and sought out the sensitive ring of flesh that needed his attention. It was puckered with anticipation, and the sheath of muscle remained blessedly tight around the one finger Castiel slowly pressed in. Dean had his head thrown back against the armrest of the couch, biting his lower lip as if to hold back the dirty moans that escaped him anyway. This was a sight that Castiel drank in, this naked man pushing down loose on his finger and then clenching at the pull. Dean took a second intrusion on another thrust, Castiel’s index slipping in and welcomed despite the abrasiveness of the drying cum.
Sam knew the the whole truth. Cas was scared. He needed and wanted to talk to Dean, but he’d use the excuse of ‘it would be better for Dean to wake up in the bunker’ in order to prolong it.
“Don’t do this Cas.” Dean said begging his angel not to leave him. He wanted to say ‘I love you too’ but his mouth couldn’t form the words. How could Cas do this? Leave after telling Dean how he felt. He was begging the angel not to leave him, but it was too late.
The boys got into the car. Sam driving and Dean in the back ready to hide when they got closer to camp.
After gathering the bodies of the teens and leaving them with the authorities Sam drove them back to the bunker. Cas used grace to keep Dean asleep for the duration of the drive. Cas told himself it would be too disorienting for a man who’d been shown who knows what by a Djinn to wake up on the road, and that was part of it.
“Fisher Point was one, but I warned him not to go alone. We’ve had a lot of people go missing out there.”
When they broke apart Dean didn’t let his eyes leave the angel in front of him. Worried that if he looked away Cas would disappear. Sensing this Cas laughed lightly.
“What are you talking about? It’s perfect.” Dean insisted “it’s also our quickest way to get on property and find the kids before they all die.”
A few hours later Sam drove the Impala back to Lebanon and back to the bunker. Dean dozed off somewhere during the 15 hour drive, and he was back in the Djinn world. It wasn’t exactly the Djinn world, but he dreamed it was.
“Dude come on! We’ve been doing back to back hunts for weeks now. Chuck is gone, and Jack is taking care of the world. We can take a break.” Sam argued
“That doesn’t make any sense. So we have three teenagers coming to a small town most people haven’t even heard of and going missing.”
Sam and Cas did the same and the team packed up Baby and started their three hour drive. Like last time it was mostly silent. Except for Sam sharing case details. It seemed like a pretty standard ghost hunt. There was one death in the building, and the man had a rivalry with the dead guy.
Sam arrived in Portland and located the motel. He went to 102 and knocked. When there was no answer Sam decided to pick the lock. Sam opened the door and walked in. He smelled sulfur. Oh no. What if Crowley had taken Dean again? He continued forward and saw Cas on his back blood coating the trench coat and wing imprints burned into the floor below.
Next Dean was in another memory. It was the night Jack was born. Cas stepped out of the portal and looked at Dean. The Hunter breathed a sigh of relief at seeing Cas alive and outside the portal when suddenly there was silver tip outside the angel’s chest and a burning around his eyes.
Dean grumbled something under his breath, but left the room. Cas turned to Sam and took his hand. He was internally cursing his weakened grace. He missed the days where it was nothing at all to heal every injury, but now he had to watch his brother fight for his life.
He searched the cave for hours, but found no sign of his brother or any of the other teens. Sam spent more time trying in vain to find his way back. Wether he wanted to admit it or not he was hopelessly lost.
Using the golf cart Sam was at the caves in ten minutes, but using the main gravel path he ran into a fork in the road. One way said extreme caving, and one said caving. He decided to go left to caving because that’s where he and Dean agreed to search first.
“I saw a perfect life. You, me, and Cas living in the bunker. Just living our lives. Cas and I were married. There was no mark, no empty deal, and no Chuck. Just love and happiness.”
“Dean” Cas said quietly grabbing the hunter’s hand “there was nothing you could’ve done. I made my choice, and I was happy knowing my love saved you. If I could do it all over I would, and I wouldn’t change a thing. But let’s forget about that it’s over. I’m back. Let’s move on with the life we deserve.”
Dean’s life with Cas was better than he imagined it would be. There was no Chuck to fight, no empty to worry about. It was just love. He had motherly love from Jody, fatherly love from Bobby, his brother bond with Sam had never been stronger, and of course he was loved in the most beautiful way by his husband Castiel. He struggled to remember a time where he’d been happier.
“I’m in Portland Oregon. My motel is room 102 and I’m right across from the ‘Cheers and Beers Bar’.”
Dean started to catch on. This wasn’t real. Cas was gone, and he wasn’t coming back. Eventually the Castiels had to convince Dean they were real, and once they succeeded Dean watched him die.
