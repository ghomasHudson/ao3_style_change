“Yes, that’s it. He remembers playing with her.”
“Did you have a good walk with your aunties, baby girl?” he asked Rosie, willing his suddenly thrumming heart to steadiness. Rosie was fine. Of course she was fine. He had a phone full of pictures demonstrating just how fine she’d been, while her useless father had practised basic hygiene.
“It is yours, though. It’s what you came to look for. You decided to come looking for it after you encountered John and me in the village. ”
“They might,” encouraged Violet, ever the optimist. “Maybe she just needs encouragement. Maybe you should sing to her.”
Punched her Daddy in the eye
“You know you’re going to get called Sherri within a day, don’t ya?” asked Dimitri.
“You seem nice to me.”
“I doubt it. But Harry has been invited. Perhaps we can amuse ourselves watching her wind up Mycroft.”
She waited until her brother marched into the bathroom. Then Harry and Molly closed the door and took Rosie to the park.
. You let my sister drown! Eurus broke her leg. She couldn’t stand in the water! Eurus couldn’t stand and
"Who's—"
“Quite.”
“See, Mummy’s here for bath time, just like always.”
Mycroft laughs, surprised and pleased again. Greg can’t help kissing him again. “I have to get backstage. I’ll be up in a minute,” he murmurs.
Giles grinned in the dark. “Oh yes. She’s decided to paint a Union Flag on it to see if it will make him laugh.”
John, exhausted, leaned, his weight leaden against the tiles. But he sighed when Sherlock soaped up the sea sponge and washed his back, his arms, backside, legs. Sherlock steadied him as the turned John to wash his chest, stomach, between his legs. Gentle and thorough, careful and caring.
“Those aren’t our best sellers anyway,” Phas said.
Mycroft offered his arm to Harry.
Harry snorted rudely. “You and Sherlock were fucking
“I think she likes you already,” grinned Phillip.
“Just come from him.”
Rosamund Of-the-Many-Names-When-Poppa-Is-Angry bowed her four-year-old head, said "yeth your majethty," and exited the sitting room with grace and a sarcastic back. (Yes, yes you can if you've learnt from the best.)
‘Keep me informed,’ said Sherlock.
They gathered around the kitchen table, Sherlock with sleeping Rosie propped in his left arm, and they ate. They didn’t talk about Smith or what had happened at the hospital. They didn’t talk about the state Sherlock had been in when Harry had last seen him. They talked about Giles teaching Harry to do woodturning, Harry claiming she could then level up to Woodworker Lesbian, which was still several rungs down from Survivalist Lesbian, but a hell of a lot better than IT Lesbian, which she’d been stuck on for a few years.
John had already turned. Was already running, and running, and running.
Sherlock gently refolded and replaced the card in the tin, and placed the tin back where it belonged under the roots of the oak tree.
Molly kiss-kiss-kissed Sally’s fingers and wrists.
“Ah… that might be… It’s… Fiona, isn’t it?”
Speeches were made. Molly’s Best Person speech for Sherlock stuttered only a little, and made a passing reference to friends that help you hide the bodies, “but that was only that one time, and he came back”.  Greg talked about two great men, who were also good men, good fathers, good friends. Mycroft raised toasts; so did Harry.
“Course you are. Get in that shower now or so help me god, I will strip you naked myself and take to you with a nail brush.”
“You haven’t used those in years…”
John licked his lips, realised Sherlock was watching him lick his lips, then tucked his tongue back in his mouth.
at this, including Sherlock. Same thing happens when she calls him papa. By the age of two she is also addressing him as Holmes. John Watson is of course daddy. And no matter how Sherlock tries—he's rather possessive of his endearment for his husband—Rosie still calls her daddy
The announcer is saying something about 133 of 150 electorates saying Yes to marriage equality, but nobody is listening. Irene and Kate are hugging and crying. Mrs Hudson, Mary and the Captains crew – who have finished hugging now – are popping and pouring champagne for everyone in the café, couples and allies alike.
“So,” he said into the awkward silence of two men hiding under an elm tree outside his mother’s wedding reception. “Who are you hiding from?”
'I have my back to you.'
So under the shelter of a drooping Camperdown elm, Caleb and Phillip kissed. Then did it again. Then again.
“Yep.”
“Sherlock. I am a grown man and I am still twitchy as fuck whenever I see you near the edge of anything higher than a coffee table. I really don’t want your mum to find you sodding about at the bottom of that fucking well.”
“Can I?” Sally began to cry. “Oh god. I love you. I love you. You make me so happy. So happy. So happy.” She sniffed hard on her happy sobbing and started to sing. “My honey’s buzzing in my hive, my baby’s got a sting; my darling girl’s my queen; I don’t need no other king.”
‘Good. I’ll keep reading anyway.’
“Survive. Endure. Live and raise Rosie. She needs her parents. Her papa as well as her dad. And I need you. I love you. I love you, Sherlock.”
“Poto-gaff!” agreed Rosie gleefully.
“Phas,” he said, then wheeled the first two boxes into the back storage room.
'Reading the news makes you angry, most of the time.'
“Three’s a crowd on this one,” Sherlock told him brusquely and proceeded with his dashing, all his sartorial choices coming and going in a flurry. At least twice Sherlock had sped into the living room shirtless, and John had studied covertly.
Giles, bewildered, put his hand in his pocket to rattle the change thrown in with his keys. “A few pounds, I suppose.”
“He thinks I sent him here to fetch his brother home, because I thought the police were right. That’s not why I sent him here.” Sherrinford hadn’t believed Sherlock was a killer, despite that idiot policeman. It was in its way fortunate other murders had occurred once Sherlock left the country. It left his innocence in no doubt.
This is how Mycroft reached the hospital room to see how his brother nearly died. This is what happened straight after. These are the promises kept and made. This is a family.
More silliness for Accidental Spying.
“The family seat, eh?” John asked. “Do you really want to sell it?”
They both looked startled at the options opening up with that phrasing. Then they both grinned.
Spit!
“Mother, I…”
John roundly, but not out loud where Rosie could hear, cursed his home medical kit to all hells as well. It was perfectly set up with gauze, bandages, sterile needles and suture thread for impromptu stitches. He had creams for burns and bruises. There was ipecac to reverse the unexpected ingestion of poisons and even ease congestion, but only in adults and not at all, no no no, for tiny children. His regular home clinic contained painkillers, anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea pills. Eye wash, eye cups and eyepatches. Braces for sprains in wrists, knees and ankles. He had all manner of kit for all manner of harm that could happen to two grown men who sometimes had the self-preservation instincts of a moth in love with the candle flame.
John’s fingers were hard in his hair, an arm like iron across his back. “You all right? Sherlock? Sherlock?!”
‘There. You have very pretty eyes, my friend.’ Porthos removed Aramis’s hat too, hanging it on the bedhead. ‘Are you ready, my sweet?’
Harry withdrew, grinning, laughing at herself and her soggy eyes as she drew her sleeve across them. Leandra gave her a tissue and she blew her nose.
Leandra Holmes, refusing to cry, strode through the sea of paper to her boy to pull him into her arms. He went limply, let himself be hugged without responding.
Greg arrived then. “I’ll come back for you guys when I’ve got John sorted. John, Edie Murray says she’ll catch up with you at the studio, okay?”
Greg tapped on the door to John’s studio and waited.
, Sherlock whispered back, that one rare nickname he sometimes used.
John swallowed. He nodded again. He shook his head. “I. Know I should. I. Never get. Past the door.”
“What?”
“Or Papa Fox. You’d like that.”
This required a bit more thought, but shortly Rosie drew the boxy outline of a suit.
It was the act of daydreaming about a baby who actually sleeps that caused John Watson, body wedged up against the blood pressure machine and the wall, to pass clean out, mouth wide open, with restful little wheezes coming out of it.
Afterwards, Sherlock scribbled hastily on a blank page in the notebook. He tore it out, folded it, shoved it into Harry’s hand.
“What the fuck?”
Sherlock’s chin jerked up at the new entrant to this stunned tableau. Howie Garrideb limped towards them across the meadow, one hand in his overcoat, the other clenched in a fist. “Jimmy, get away from them.”
, thought Sherlock.
“There’s more,” whispered Sherlock.
“You know the boys?” Dimitri asked.
Mrs Hudson sent up flowers from the back garden. Later, the three of them sat in the back garden, drinking tea.
Mycroft thought his father’s words were very fine indeed, for Sherlock and for John. For Mummy too. And perhaps Mary’s death wasn’t really his fault: Dr Watson’s expressive and too readable face when he looked at Mycroft was suggestive of both forgiveness and apology. Perhaps Sherlock’s most recent near miss with Culverton (
Sherlock seized John’s left hand while John lubed him up with the right. He kissed all of John’s fingers and his palm, he mouthed at John’s fingers, and sucked on them, then wrapped his mouth around the wedding ring and revelled in the feel and taste of the metal on his tongue. All this while John pulled the panties to one side and wriggled his clever fingers between Sherlock’s cheeks, into the tight furl.
Sherlock clutched John’s hand and rolled his eyes.
Sherlock found them out. The dead twin was unearthed and identified, and his widow and brother were arrested.
And then Mr Holmes Senior said, “It’s the tradition in England as well. I suppose the… ah… happy couple have… gone for a quiet. Talk. Somewhere?”
“Thank you,” said Mycroft primly. If anyone was a dandy, Sherrinford supposed it was Mycroft, who was supposed to have been a government minister, or the head of a department, or an ambassador to somewhere important by now.
“No,” said John, “I don’t mind.”
Days long gone and far away. Now he was an Australian citizen, thanks to his Sydney-born dad, and he lived in the Land Down Under, where turning his life upside down had been the absolutely best thing he’d ever done.
“You can put the kettle on,” bossed Harry.
Ten by ten, and under she goes
‘Your landlady picked up hers first. This is for you. Molly and Greg asked me to include the Waitrose’s caramel sauce. Cherry Vimto for John. Is that right?’
) Smith was not his own failing.
“Not a bit of it,” said Greg, “It was hauling that wanker Smith up by the scruff of his neck that did it. Worth it though. The bastard’s still confessing so often and in so much detail, I’m not sure you’ll even have to take the stand.  But you’re both all right?”
The man pursed his lips. “I’m his father.” He nodded at Sherlock. Then at Mycroft.  “Their father.”
“I thought I felt you coming back for me, but I knew you’d be too late,” said Sherlock in wonder.
“All right.”
Sherlock and John both beelined for their baby while Giles and Leandra took themselves to the sitting room. Harry very happily handed Rosie over into Sherlock’s long reach, and in moments Rosie was having a quiet little cry in Papa’s arms while he rocked her and whispered, “Ssshh, ssshh, ssshhh, little Watson.  That’s enough. No wonder your father gives me such looks when I’m having a strop all over the place, hmm? What a commotion.”
"Yes. Useless. It's just mashing lips together, except you say it isn't. You need to demonstrate."
Carefully, Sherlock took one end of the ribbon and pulled it. The golden bow unfolded and the ribbon curled away from the box. Sherlock examined the ribbon then put it aside. He examined the box again. Satisfied that it told him no more than before, he removed the lid and examined the interior.
“In Australia.”
Sherlock kissed their daughter, kissed his husband, picked up Buzzy Bee from where he’d been flung against the grate, put the toy in his pocket, kissed his family again and said, “I really have to go. I’m sorry I missed the Daddy Dance.”
“What the hell are you people doing to my cousin?”
“The client is a dating agency. One of the users is dating men, getting to know them, drugging them on the third date, stealing their British Library Reading Room cards and then leaving them, otherwise unharmed, on the Piccadilly line and then vanishing. Four men have been victims so far.”
“Feeling tired? That’s a drop of something extra in your saline drip. I popped by the nurse’s station earlier, when they were preparing it for you. Not midazolam. Just good old fashioned sedative, but rather a lot of it. You’ve probably been wondering why you’re so sluggish. An overdose made just for you. But let’s see if we can help that along.”
“Course not. Spirit of Citrus makes its own declaration about what it’s covering up. It’s just plausible deniability, since that hatchet faced nurse chucked me out last time for sneaking you a fag. I had to tiptoe in as it was.”
These tiny wee (poo) snippets came about when 221b_hound was delighted to think how Sherlock would react the first time Rosie poo-ed while sitting on Mycroft's lap.
“I would tear the throat of any who would threaten her, with mine own teeth,” said Richard in a steely voice.
“I know you’re a fuckwit sometimes. But you’re a good Dad.”
John strode away without listening or waiting for him.
“I don’t think she is quite, but she’s old enough to be interested, so John shoved it in the bag a few weeks ago, just in case.” Harry peered at the jar. Mashed peach and banana. “Ha. The bastard. Last time I met Mary for lunch Rosie kept grabbing my banana. Mary thought it was fucking hilarious, watching her squish it between her fingers and all over my hair. And Mary was no goddamned help at all. She just took pictures of it for her mad husbands. Here. Take a picture for John.” Harry held the jar next to one cheek. Rosie reached for the jar right across Harry’s face.
He put an arm around her shoulders. He took her hand in his, squeezed it. He continued to stare at the well.
Criticism or not? But, you know, fuck it. John Watson had everything he wanted in life and had no need to be defensive about it.
"There's half your problem there. You mean 'with me'."
John, who’d often felt friendless and abandoned himself before Melbourne, smiled at him. “There they all were,” he agreed.
“Whose idea was the pavlova anyway?”
“Was it what you thought?” John asked.
“Only if I get to be Olivia Newton-John.”
9.50am.
“Hey.” Sherlock could practically hear the smile over the phone. “That’s what mates are for, right?”
Sherlock stared, then smiled, then laughed.
“I don’t have time to spend years on it. I have a date with a serial library card thief in two days and I need to have sufficient skill to make second and third dates feasible.”
He only saw John. Smiling like the sun. Moustache waxed to elegant perfection, heartbreakingly handsome in his suit, in the shoes he’d stained the rich green-black himself (matching the ones he’d patinaed for Sherlock, just one floor up in his own studio). John who knew him, and whom he knew, and so they made each other real and solid and made each other fit into the world at last.
Then he shrugged, because a) Sherlock had been known to put much worse things in his mouth than baby mucus and b) when your little one couldn’t breathe (
Mrs Hudson, DeClutterer to the Rarefied Elite, first took a tour of the whole apartment while John and Sherlock sat in their mismatched armchairs by the fire, glaring at each other with their arms mulishly folded.
“I wouldn’t say happy, precisely.”
are, you mean,” said Sherlock, “You hurt your back putting Mycroft into that chair.”
“Algieba.”
In Doctor Watson’s medical opinion, the patient had a slender yet muscular physique, healthy colour, no obvious scars and was proper fit.
. Stop destroying yourselves for what you couldn’t prevent. It wasn’t your fault.
“All Rosie knows is that her parents are content,” agreed Mary. Sherlock kissed her too. Mary, laughing, took John’s hand, kissed Sherlock on the cheek and said, “Do your stuff then, sunshine.”
“Less chance of me burning the house down,” Harry agreed, “My days of arson are meant to be behind me.”
fucked off to the army but you came back. Not everyone goes, and maybe we don’t come back the same, but we’re here. Me and Molly and Rosie are fucking
“Will you not-marry me, forever and ever and ever?”
“I know what you really want,” said Phas.
Sally called. Thanked him for the work he’d done on the cold cases. Told him that of course he didn’t need to worry about the others, when he apologised for not having time. ‘They’ve waited years. They’ll wait a bit longer. My best to the doc, yeah?’
“The fact he knew about her wanting to learn astronomy is odd. Mummy says Eurus had only recently become excited by the idea. Astonishingly, Mycroft had planned to teach her the constellations.”
He sat at the kitchen table with her and played peekaboo. She giggled a few times, but then fell quiet and wanted nothing more than a cuddle. He snugged her close and rocked her in his arms. For a moment he could almost feel Mary’s arms around his shoulders, her voice in his ear, “you big softie” and Sherlock’s violin. Just at the edge of his hearing. The ghosts of the life he'd loved.
“Of course.”
“He’s worried that I’m. Bothered. By.” Sherlock fell silent. They paced a while down the drive, past the oak. “The fact that we haven’t. Hmm.”
The living room was strewn with detritus. Papers and photographs spilling out of coloured folders, notebooks, scraps of cloth, glass slides held together in clips to preserve the material trapped between them. A tatty shoe, a piece of pottery, a yellow mask.
Sherlock’s lips brushed against John’s cheek and temple, settled close to his ear. “You’re standing where it happened,” he said quietly, half question, half knowing the answer.
Harry pushed open the door to the Baker Street flat, nose wrinkling in distaste. Mrs Hudson’s word of caution wasn’t wrong. Captain Cutecheeks was in a state.
John snorted a bit. Sherlock winced. “No. I’m…”
“Yes. I hope so. He needs. He needs.” Mycroft shuddered. Pressed his hand to his arm. “Something’s not right.” Then he looked up at John as though waking up at last. “I’m. Sorry. About Mary.”
Sherlock snorted in that very scornful way of his. “Of course you wouldn’t.” Then he tilted his head to look at John bobbing out there in the water. “Why would you even think such a thing? You saved my life when there was no hope I could save the Scarlet. You have saved my life time and again, John. But as you love me, stay back.”
Harry sighed. “I didn’t mean to upset him this morning. Or you.  I don’t think. Just…” With her hands and fingers she mimed a word vomit. “You’d think I’d fucking learn. Can’t even do this shit right sober.”
John, in spite of everything, was absolutely charmed, an answering smile coming immediately to his lips.
They kissed again, John’s hand in Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock’s hand cupping John’s jaw. “All those friends we have, John,” he said, between kisses over John’s mouth, nose, cheeks. “I never used to think I’d have them. But there they all were.”
John Watson ran, leaving Mycroft struggling where he had fallen from the bed, trying to drag himself to that damnable wheelchair.
“Am I? I suppose so. Except for the constant pain.” He wince-smiled. “In the foot I don’t have.”
“Silver bear?”
When she returned, John was sitting on the ground with the Holmeses, leaning against Sherlock who had an arm around him, his other hand holding onto Rosie’s fingers. She’d stopped crying at least, poor kid. Mycroft, eyes closed, was leaning against his father. Harry brought the chair up to them and Giles and Sherlock helped Mycroft into the chair.
“What are you here for then?”
Mrs Hudson, bless her, left food at the door, with little notes. She remained well.
He scrabbled on the floor at his feet for a notebook and peered at the contents.
“Nobody can see,” he decided.
“Yeah, well, if it was all about the kissing, I’d be fine. I think I’m scoring pretty low in all the other areas.” Depressing thought. At least he got to spend more time with Sherlock.
“Donna’s cute and everything,” said Phillip between giggles, “But if anything can make a guy examine his insipient bisexuality for the first time, it’s his Mom coming out a week after his Dad’s funeral and getting gay married a year later.”
“Why don’t we find out exactly what’s in your collections before you decide that this is the hill you and your families fortunes die on, hmm?” said Mrs Hudson easily.
“Language, John. Watson’s listening.”
Because life is full of change and sometimes those changes are bad—a bullet-shattered shoulder ending a surgeon's career bad—but sometimes those changes are glorious.
John did not put the kettle on. He kissed Rosie’s fingers and twirled a plastic flower for her while Harry cleaned and changed her. Then he scooped his little girl into his arms while Harry washed her hands in the bathroom.
John had descended to the mortal plane in the Year of His Lord 1872 to fulfil a guardianship entrusted to him. He could not help but see what went on under God’s distant eye.
“Mycroft doesn’t know how to say it, but he adores you.”
Mycroft snuck a look at Harry Watson, who grinned mercilessly at him.
John looked just as pleased with himself as he rose off the bed.
"He did not."
“Better. Yeah.”
“When he was eighteen, Sherlock restated his intention to remain a bachelor on the logic that he didn’t have the time and in any case, boys were still all very dull.”
His own fault of course. He’d determined to be terribly English about it all. He’d determined to make them hard and tough and to use their brains instead of their hearts, because where did that lead you except to heartbreak?
“Everyone leaves,” he gasped at her. “He’s not allowed to leave.”
‘Tried to make the bed,’ confessed John. ‘Got dizzy.’ His hands were shaking again.
“Sherlock darling,” said Leandra, “You need to…”
“Of course. Better wait until Rosie’s with your mum and dad, though. Hardly takes his eyes off that kid when she’s around. Except to look at John of course. Soppy bastards.”
The photo he took of Mycroft’s face is still his contact photo on Sherlock's phone.
“Our girl is exemplifies the pinnacle of the combined power of nature/nurture,” says Sherlock.
“Case solved,” it announced within the flurry of swirling coat, scarf on peg, “Stupidly simple. The victim had a cat, so naturally the used syringe was under the fridge and where are you going with Watson? The clinic? Really? It’s only a cold…”
And he forgot to say “what do you mean?” or “are you sure?” or “yes, your highness”. He kissed her lips, and again, and closer still, as she kissed him back from the first press of his lips on hers.
“Blimey.”
Sherlock and John, those two men of science, read, inferred, deduced and even guessed a lot of the challengesof parenthood. The literature and the clever guessing did not, however, prepare them for some of the more mortifying hazards. Exhaustion, habit and distraction are a dangerous combination.
The police detective named Polash grunted, scribbling.
Oh, the look of terror on Sherlock’s face, that saw John follow him over the edge and changed to the most terrible despair. Sherlock in his anguish reached up as he plummeted away, as though by grasping John’s hand he could save him.
‘If you knew, why did you ask?’
Giles waited with infinite patience for Sherlock to speak. It was rare enough that Sherlock had joined him on his evening constitutional, and perfectly obvious that he was pensive about some topic he intended to bring up, but Sherlock never had been much good at talking about things that troubled him.
'Well, it's mostly infuriating, isn't it? I'm just going to browse for potential cases and then do the Sudoku. What's in the box?'
“You’ve seen Sherlock?”
“Don’t you have a case on?”
'Yes, John. Posh hotel, fancy dinner, dancing.'
If you've enjoyed reading about Rosie and her dads, I'm co-writing a *crackastic* series about Rosie, John and Sherlock called
“Hmm.” He went right up to the edge of the well, running his fingers over the stones and testing the wooden cover. The edge of the wood was brittle and a layer flaked off the top.
John nuzzle-kissed a trail down Sherlock’s throat, up it again. “Nope.”
Perhaps this was hypocrisy, but Sherlock did not love
“My offer?”
“I’ll take that as the compliment you intended it to be.” Harry grinned at him.
Dishes were left in the sink for later. Harry had put several loads of washing through for John, folding everything and ironing nothing. They left that for later too. Instead, they got onto the floor with Rosie on her play rug, helping her to grab at toys, hiding a little Pooh Bear behind a pillow for her to cackle when John made him peek out at her, singing her songs.  Sherlock played a game where he only sang when she grabbed his thumb, and then John grabbed the thumb and Sherlock was performing a staccato Baa Baa Black Sheep for the pair of them.
‘Still making up for lost time,’ murmured John. ‘All those years before I met you.’
“Course you won’t. You’re her Papa.”
“I’ve seen you at the same book fairs I go to. The festivals. The readings. I know what you want.”
“Right. So. Let them treat it. Don’t. Don’t do without. Because you think you deserve the pain. You don’t.”
‘He’s not here, as you can see,’ said the Musketeer, who was unmistakably Athos. ‘Be off, before the garrison takes exception to your presence.’
“I snotted all over your jumper.”
* Cataloging turbellaria, beginning of course with the parasitic but progressing to the marine flatworm, a passion about which she once spoke for three hours, never noticing John left the room six times to prepare dinner.
“I didn’t do anything to report,” John said, “I didn’t even have to wrestle anyone into submission. I’ll meet you back at the hotel later.”
That’s when Sherlock sucked his mouth off John’s fingers with a pop. He leaned down and he continued sucking on his beloved’s thick, hot prick.
Her brother’s mouth swallows the stream in the field
St Marcus's Hospital. Sherlock won't see John. John speaks to Mycroft instead, only for them to find a secret message Mycroft has left for himself. John runs. He runs. He runs. And Sherlock? Sherlock wants desperately to live, but Culverton Smith has other plans.
"Crazy shit. I did what he suggested though. I went to my dad’s grave and told the dirt I was sorry he'd died so horribly, but it didn't mean I thought he was anything but a cruel and useless bastard.”
“You weren’t protecting me. Your father was protecting
Caleb took Phillip’s chin in one hand; he gave him a steely look to shut down that innuendo before it escaped; he kissed Phillip soundly. “At least sixty nine kinds of kiss,” he said, determined. Then he grabbed Phillip’s hand. “Let’s go be awkward then.”
He choked down a slice, crumbs drifting onto Rosie. He thought Harry would try to take her, so he held more tightly to his daughter with one arm, and determinedly ate a second half slice. Despite himself, he felt better. He washed it down with tea. Ate another piece of toast.
“I’ve done lots of kissing,” John supplied cheerfully. “Lots and lots. And lots. And I started pretty average and I got better. I’d say generally my satisfaction rating with dates of my acquaintance is 10/10 for kissing.”
Look, I haven't done any world building. I don't know why this world is the way it is. I expect it's alternative universe, maybe after the plague wiped out a lot more people and felled civilisation in different and more thorough ways...
‘I’ll see you tonight, maybe very late. Don’t wait up.’
And just like that, John turned and ran, stumbling the few steps to Sherlock, not just falling but throwing himself at Sherlock, throwing his arms around him, “
“John?”
John pushed the blankets aside.
In that waking world, John, wrung with sweat, exhaustion, satisfaction, rocked their daughter in his arms. Sherlock wept with starstruck, beatific joy as he traced their baby’s scrunched little face, her crinkled little ears, her chubby arms and fat legs, her perfect tiny toes and fingers, and said “Hello, little girl, hello, hello, hello.”
“We’ve got it John,” said Giles kindly.
“But you knew what she was like.”
“I don’t know yet,” said Mycroft, “But I suspect it’s murder.”
Where once fear and disgust had brutalised his already senseless form, Khan devoted his love. Whatever wounds had been earned and deserved, that Richard’s body had been precious to his Khan, as his soul was also precious.
“Sherlock,” he called, “I’m coming in to help you. Don’t. Don’t be alarmed by. Don’t be alarmed. I’d never harm you.”
“We’ve all lost too much, do you hear me? I have nearly lost all my children today. “
John sighed, but with relief. He never wanted to ask Sherlock to wait for him, but was so grateful when he did. The dark marks around John’s cheeks, forehead, nose – bruises from the mask he wore clamped to his face for hours on end – were less red than yesterday, which was something.  Sherlock hated them, the need for the equipment that caused them, the anxiety of the worse things that could happen. Sherlock wasn’t a man given to paranoia or panic, but he’d done his reading. What he read, the number of unknowns, didn’t bring any comfort.
And so Richard had become. He had, through suffering, burned his past. Become a better man. He had found his Khan in Sherlock, who had suffered and burned too, in order to find his soulmate.
Mycroft had gone for some air. Harry had disappeared too. Giles and Leandra were sitting side by side in front of the low-burning fireplace, holding hands. Silent.
“I don’t want to publish tedious books on politics, philosophy and mysticism.”
Sherlock finally took his father’s hand and shook it briefly before letting go. “You want to wish me well?”
“Aye.  Father-mother both am I, for I hold a life within my twisted body. I destroyed many lives in my bloody path to the crown. But to make a life when I am Richard is something new.”
“I’m sorry,” he said.
Then his voice wouldn’t work, and he cried again, but then he laughed as Greg bit his throat, and stripped him bare, and kissed every pale centimetre of that English Rose skin, sucked red blossoms onto his favourite parts. They had their wanton way with each other in the living room.
, Sherrinford thought. And he thought,
“No, you’re a shit-stirrer, like your dad.”
“What if you had a couple of great writers to take to them, start off with a bang and a couple of hot bestsellers?”
A muffled, cranky cough emerged from the baby monitor. John jumped to his feet and headed through the kitchen to their room, where Rosie had been set down for a nap. He returned with her in his arms, nose brushing against her hair.
Though flip-flops come in every colour and pattern possible, Rosie never showed interest in any style but
“I know, Ducky,” said Giles solemnly, “But they are very sweet.”
“I think he’s as good for you as you are for him,” said Leandra matter-of-factly.
‘But only if you dance again.’
Musings about the hairy goings on in 221b.
At John’s place, Harry let herself in. She’d liberated John’s keys a day after the funeral so she could get a set cut, in case he just didn’t answer the door again. That had only happened the once, and she’d found him cradling a sleeping Rosie, her empty bottle on the table next to them, John gazing at his daughter’s face like he was afraid if he moved she’d vanish.
The Watsons had all hugged him too, but one more itchingly necessary farewell was required.
“I’ll have my congratulatory kiss now,” Sherlock declared. John, laughing, obliged, wrapping his sun-and-jogging-warmed arms around Sherlock’s ocean-chilled skin.
He can see Mycroft on the floor out there, feels Mycroft’s eyes on him. He kicks his high heels up and steps down again, grinding it on the floor with extra flourish.
Beyond the oak, the drive led down to the gate and the flanking elms. They paused when they reached them.
“Got it. Right. Bring me up.”
“These men here. They are their mother’s sons. They are who Leaona wanted them to be.”
“There we go,” said Smith, “That’s the face I like to see. Sheer terror. You don’t want to die, but you know you’re going to anyway.”
“Why would I want to kiss Molly? I’m dating men. I need to know how to kiss a man. I imagine stubble is a problem, for instance.”
Behind his newspaper John Watson-Holmes quietly lost his shit, Sherlock chastised him for the ridiculous things 'our daughter is learning from you' and everyone thought that was the end of that.
“I should g-“ he began.
(John, his John, too thin, too desperate, breathing ragged and wet, but his John, John, John, John)
‘This is very poor social distancing,’ said Mycroft mildly, but he was embracing Sherlock in return.
If nobody expects to see DI Greg Lestrade at a drag show, surely a negative sum of nobodies would expect to see Mycroft Holmes here.
“Then it’s about time Rosie had a walk in the park, isn’t it? I’ll text you when we get there,” Harry promised him. “We’ll send you a park selfie too. We’ll send you six. When you call, we’ll come right back. But if I get here and you haven’t showered, I’m kicking your smelly arse. Okay?”
John turned his face to kiss Sherlock’s wrist. Lifted his chin so they could press their lips together.
“Who are you angry with?”
Mary isn’t bothered. “I am. We’re going to do this thing.”
Mycroft shook his head, becoming distracted again. “I don’t have proof yet. But I suspect. It seems to me that…” He pulled up his sleeve to see his forearms covered in bloody tissues. “What is this?”
Molly knocked on the door. “John?” she called. He didn’t reply. She knocked louder. Called his name again.
Sherrinford rolled the scotch around in the glass and watched John Watson-Holmes murmuring something into Sherlock’s ear.
are. Hiding.”
(See the end of the chapter for
'You didn't just... deduce it this very second?'
“Rosie needs to be changed and fed. I didn’t want you to wake without us here.”
Technically, he supposed he might be considered a Fallen angel, though he tended to think of himself as Missing in Action.
“No.”
Khan kissed Richard in return and caressed the precious swell of Richard’s body. Their daughter moved again, swimming soft and languid in her father’s deeps.
In his own room, Sherlock drifted in and out of sleep.
John danced in a half circle and waggled his bum then danced back round, pulled up his shirt and slapped on his belly like a drum.
“I am rated to fly three types of plane, I once deciphered an ostensibly indecipherable code in 47 hours, and I used to hold myself to an Olympic standard of fencing. So.” Mycroft curled his lip and hurled the cigarette against the oak. “Why. Can. I. Not. Master. A. Fucking. Leg.”
“Mycroft never mentioned it. Eurus wasn’t allowed to play on the grounds by herself. Mycroft doesn’t remember Howie making himself friendly.”
By the by, Sherlock is very scientific about testing baby foods before they give them to Rosie. John thinks this is a lovely idea. John does not realize the bloody half of it.
“Quite.” The T was bitten off.
“Yeah. Signalling, you know? That I’d like to…”
John watched “Braid like a Boss” on YouTube nine times before he could indeed “Braid like a Boss” or rather “Braid like the bosses incompetent assistant who takes over when his boss is on her holidays and does a semi-reasonable job, but everyone is secretly delighted when she comes back…” Rosie
Buzzy keeps a lot of secrets, and not just for Sherlock. Perhaps we'll learn more of the secrets he keeps for John, Rosie, and the other poeple in their lives.
'Last night, after you were asleep.'
'It's a daily present to myself to watch you deduce things. I love seeing your expression go from "what's this" to "elementary!" in 0.2 seconds.'
John’s hips rocked a few more times, before he slowly withdrew and collapsed sideways on the bed. Both of them were panting, and Sherlock was mostly hard again.
“Want me to show you stage three?” John asked.
“It’s Southbank, John. Not that inter… oh.”
Rosie grabbed for her bee with a determined little face, her blue eyes wide and her mouth a little crooked with her concentration as she grabbed the bee and pulled it to her chest.
At least he was admitting it.
“Sherlock’s in hiding too?”
“Yes. I miss her too.”
Leandra and Giles stayed as long as visiting hours would allow, but backed up John’s claim to be Sherlock’s partner so that he could stay.
itself. Everything in it felt quintessentially John, from John’s photographic art on the walls and the scent of leather and wax, to the bar fridge full of craft brews and the sofa that John and Sherlock had no doubt gloriously debauched over the last two years. John Watson had always seemed an intensely private person; that aspect of him reminded Greg of Mycroft. And like Mycroft, when John committed to someone, he held nothing back. Of course Sherlock was John’s best friend. Sherlock was John’s everything.
'My game?'
“He’s not as practised at sliding out of things as you are. You’re practically a buttered eel.”
“Teach me to kiss in the next two days.”
John raised himself up on his knees briefly, so that he could pull Sherlock’s trousers down to his thighs. The white lingerie was cut high, showing off Sherlock’s lean thighs. The cloth bulged with Sherlock’s tightening balls, with the line of his thick erection.
“Morning Mummy,” John said, directing Rosie towards the photo. “Mummy says good morning Rosie. Kiss good morning for our Rosie.” He kissed the soft crown of her head and took her to the nursery to change and dress her. He took her to the kitchen while he prepared a bottle for her. Sat on the couch and held her. He watched her feed with tender grief.
"Things are what they are. But we’ll endure. Live through it. Survive and thrive. We just have to love each other as hard as we can.”
Mycroft. In a crisp suit, hair coiffed, bland smile in place. He was still too thin. Still too pale. He was using his umbrella to steady his weight, instead of just for show.
“Bye bye Gran!” said Rosie, waving energetically.
‘Happy non-wedding anniversary, John.’ He kissed John that time, and didn’t get around to giving his husband a gift for a while because they were too busy kissing.
. Sherlock saw one man’s new haircut and a small scar on the wrong side of an identical brother’s face. He discovered the sudden change of temperament and consequent surrender of his dog to a shelter. Shoes slightly ill-fitting, a belt’s crease demonstrating it was one notch tighter.
She began to back out into the hall again, but Sherlock pulled suddenly away from his parents. “Molly! Wait!” He whirled, nearly tripped on the blankets at his feet, steadied himself on the wall and staggered to the centre of the room. “Molly! Wait!”
John was moaning softly at how lavishly Sherlock Holmes-Watson was sucking on his fingers, licking down to the web, fellating index and middle fingers like he might actually make those fingers come.
. I don’t know if. If there’s an us without her.”
Leandra found Harry in the old greenhouse, staring glumly at bags of blood and bone. Gaps in the framework, covered in clear plastic, indicated where glass panels had broken over the years. Inside, it still smelled of mulch and plant decay, though the last few months of tidying had cleaned up the benches and rows of cuttings very well.
“What? Oh. No.” Sherlock paced in agitation. He tugged John’s tie off and threw it on the floor.
John turned to arch an cranky eyebrow at him. “And my ‘aaaaah’ you mean?”
“Aaaaaah,” said Sherlock before Harry could answer.
Sherlock, heaving for breath on the floor on the other side of the bed, too thin, face shadowed in pain and self-neglect, and flushed red, wet with tears.
The ash fell from Mycroft’s neglected cigarette and he twitched as it landed on his lap. He brushed the ember and ash clear then made himself politely enquire: “Are you done?”
“I’m told you gave Sherlock a case.”
Initially Greg had hoped to be showered with confetti and tears in the Botanic Gardens, but garden weddings were usually booked a year ahead and there was no way he was going to wait that long.
Sherlock turned the box over and over in his long fingers. He rattled it beside his ear. He sniffed it. He dabbed the tip of his tongue against the ribbon.
“Oh, I think your underrate your prospects, Dr Watson.”
“You’re going to get kneed in the bollocks in a minute if you don’t shut up and listen. You said you wanted technique. This is technique. Shut the fuck up and pay attention.”
John Watson-Holmes’s handshake was firm but not overbearing.  A good handshake.  “Call me Sherrinford.”
John sat beside Sherlock and tilted his face into the sun, smiling. He breathed in the scent of greenery, of water, of air beyond the confines of Baker Street. He would call Harry and Clara later; facetime with Greg and Molly. That would be nice.
“I don’t want to see you,” she said again. She turned her back on her neighbours, who were as ruined as the rest of them, and stumbled. Harry put an arm cautiously around Leandra, ready for rejection, but the older woman seemed grateful for the support.
This wasn't as long as I hoped it would be. It took me two days to write,and it's *still* not very long. I'm sorry guys....
John nodded, and turned back to the fridge, grabbing some bacon that had been thrown in there when they had first arrived. He got it out of the package, lying it in strips in the pan.
"I know."
Sherlock had told John about the sudden case, and John had freaked. Now, they had one broken table, and new bullet holes in their wall. He didn't see why it was such a big deal.
And I love going on cases with Sherlock, but the really bad ones...the ones with soldiers who have...Those are the hardest, and I can't tell him because if I do, he'll stop himself from going on cases like that, and I can't do that to him. I just...it gets worse the more I push it down, and the nightmares...those are the worst things I can ever imagine." John's voice broke, his breathing shaky. Mrs. Hudson nodded once more.
It would be almost a year before Sherlock spoke to him again.
Silence.
Bloody hell. He needed to sleep. Not lay here and think about Sherlock
Groans.
"It's not up to you what I can and can't get into," John says. Sherlock looked up at him again - he'd down casted his eyes after a moment of silence between them.
Sherlock took a sharp breath when the water hit his palm. "Why the bloody hell did you just
Fuck. Someone made me happy, you know who you are! Love you, sweets!
His hips jump; thighs press against him for friction.
And now, after a year and a-half of Sherlock being back, being here, someone was threatening him again. They'd been through so much already. Moriarty, The Fall, Eurus....
John's voice echoed.
Mycroft shook his head. No. It…he looked around the room again. The vent wasn’t empty. He knew that. It was took clean to be empty. If everything else in the room was damp and dirty, why would the vent be shiny and clean? And the scratches - they were intentional. He should’ve known that - from the way they ran to how deep they were. And the chair - he walked over and he moved the chair. There was small writing on it. All over it. He knew that writing.
John sighed as he set the bags by the door, only to have Sherlock come from his room, holding his bag as well. John let out
"No," was the only choked thing that came out of John's mouth. He felt a hand at his shoulder.
He surged forward, not knowing if he was cutting John’s talking off, and he didn’t care either way. He crashed his lips against John’s and he almost pulled away when John tensed, but then he relaxed and tilted his head up and Sherlock couldn’t help it when he sighed against John’s mouth and his hands moved to John’s waist.
Sherlock is panting too, his breaths erratic as he grinds down into John. Sherlock growls, low and a little lost, and his hands fist in the sheets beside John's arms.
Sherlock listened to everything come from Johns mouth and his mind ran. This….this is why he’d fallen in love with John. But he was being insanely stupid. His eyes flickered down to John’s mouth and he quit hearing anything John was saying.
"Well as it turns out it's also mine, to keep you from doing drugs!"
hear it.
Okay. So this one as kind of short, and I'm really sorry for not updating sooner. But I love you guys and hope you don't hate me for this.
Pain.
So I was listening to this song (Yes, this song is a Destiel feels song; AKA "Can't help falling in love with you") while writing this, so I thought I'd put it on here to show why I put so many...feeling. And since I haven't been writing I'm giving you a long chapter. And the song is not introduced in this chapter or fic at all.
The link/video above goes with something I added at the end of this chapter that has to do with Sherlock and his violin. I'd recommend listening to it after (or while you're reading it) you've read the chapter so you understand.
"Why not? You found a way to get over me for two year!"
, she thought.
to you to
Sherlock looked over, and saw that John had already fallen asleep. He smiled to himself and  began humming. He hated how the waltz was always in the back of his mind. But he loved how it sounded, he loved how much he felt John when he played it or hummed it.
John shook his head. No. Sherlock didn't love him. Mycroft was just another pawn in the game. And John....John was the one stupid enough to fall into the game.
Pulling at the purple buttons.
"God, John, see this is why I said you're stupid."
Sherlock shook his head after a moment and glanced at the clock.
Later that night, Sherlock was curled in bed, Rosie in between them both, and John began to think, as he always did before he fell asleep.
The voice came slow, like Mycroft was thinking. "But you still need sleep. Go back to the flat. I'll be here. I'll stay with him."
Sherlock stumbles back in to find John lying there, his eyes closed, and he smiled. He moved towards the bed with a wet washcloth and a glass of water. He makes John drink first, then moves down between his thighs to carefully wipe John clean with the warm cloth, clean him up as best as he can without ushering him out of bed and into the shower.
"I love you," Sherlock breathes out, and John's entire body breaks down in shivers and soft little whines.
John shook his head. He couldn't leave Sherlock. He could never leave Sherlock. But part of him knew it was right. Part of him knew he did need sleep. He hadn't had sleep for the last 72 hours. He needed it.
"I bandaged your palm," John states after a moment.
assume
John let out sigh, and Sherlock jumped at the sound. "John?" His voice was loud in the small, quiet room. John jumped and opened his eyes, locking his dark blue eyes on Sherlock's. His chest tightened, but he didn't break the gaze.
His head was on Sherlock's chest, and for once, John thanked his height. He could hear the thud of Sherlock's heart.
“Why not?” it sounded hurt. “You played with me. You played all those funny games with me. Let me play with you.”
"How the bloody hell did you know all that, and when did you find it out?" Sherlock smirked. "No, don't tell me how you knew it all, you'll be going on for hours if you do."
He was gonna go back to hiding everything. Get back to doing cases and loose himself in them. He wasn't going to let anyone know. Well, anyone else. Mycroft knew, but then again, Mycroft knew everything. So, here Sherlock was. Back again to hiding.
He closed his eyes but they flew open a moment later when he heard the door slam open on the floor below, and he heard that familar fast treading of shoes, and he felt his heart speed up and his mind race....
Mycroft’s brows furrowed, “Out of London? London is where you belong dear brother,” he said lowly.
He fucking hated Sherlock Holmes.
“I see perfectly fine, Mycroft. Now will you get me out of London or now?”
Soft lips crashing against his.
get to scoff at me."
Of course it was John, it always was. John was always the first thing he thought about in the morning, and it was the last thing he thought about before going to sleep.
Sherlock pulled the car in front of 221B Baker street, and he felt a slight pressure in his chest ease. He looked over at John, who was still asleep. Sherlock let out a sigh, shut the car off, and opened his door, making sure to close it loud enough to wake John. He opened the back seat door, and leaned in to grab his bag, and saw John leaning back to grab his.
Sherlock starts to gain momentum, to move faster, but it's only when John whines for more, harder , that he gives up the careful thrusts and drops his control.
"I stay here," he murmured. Myroft opened his mouth but John shook his head.
If he just told John...but he couldn't. John was his best friend. Nothing more. Even if he wanted, so much more, John didn't.
His chest constricted and he got up, pacing around the room and he glanced at the clock.
"Yes, you very much are."
"Then what was her name? Mary? That little fling with her?
What in the hell had Mycroft seen?
Lips don't slow.
"So? What are we having?" John shook his head, which was still in the fridge. "I don't know Sherlock."
"Then something
The sizzling was a welcome noise to the quiet.
And, as the song hit it's crescendo, John fell into sleep.
"I asked his to stay and sleep with me," He cleared his throat again and took another drink of his tea.
“You know who I am. You’ve known since you woke up.”
Anger boiled into John. Sherlock was fucking stupid for leaving. And without telling John. Or Mrs. Hudson who was very worried when John got back to the flat.
Yeah, and that's why he's
He had Sherlock
John watched as the men talked. He could see the tenseness of them both, and he really hoped they'd be able to move past this. He must have been staring, because a small arm slipped into his, and he looked down to see Molly.
John shook his head, "I didn't mean that," he half whispered.
He left
His brows furrowed. He'd been sitting here for hours. Alone. And now in the dark. He sighed and stood up. When he moved to walk, his leg hit the edge of the chair and he stumbled forward. His knee hit the side table and in the process the tray of tea came crashing down onto the ground, and Sherlock tumbled after it.
Sherlock finally, oh so carefully and slow, pushes all the way inside, until he's buried to the hilt. His body freezes, then, and he's quietly whining when he rests his head against John's sternum.
And then Sherlock's mouth is gone, and he's heaved himself up to kiss John. Sherlock pulls back a bit. John’s face is flushed red, pink lips slightly open, pupils blown black, he looks so gorgeous that Sherlock can't breathe.
And how his hips felt under his fingers and the way they peeked out from under Sherlock's shirt. And the curve of Sherlock's thighs under his pants and the way he tensed and John could see the muscle jump. And the way his shoulder blades moved under his shirt and the way Sherlock rolled them when he was nervous.
After a moment of Sherlock standing like a statue, still as stone, he spoke: "Why would you love me?"
But they were
"I've gathered that."
"You forgot-How the hell did you-Did you...
Little. It sounded little. Like a child.
FUCK. WE'VE MADE IT! THE ANTICIPATION IS OVER MY LOVES! YES!
"Well? What is it?" his voice had risen a bit. Hesitation.
John leaned his head against the window, and closed his eyes. He was like that for a couple moments, and then he heard a low humming coming from beside him. He didn't move, and just listened. The pressure in he chest eased a bit when he realized what Sherlock was humming. It was one of the works he played on his violin whenever John was upset.
This is just here to say that if English isn't your first language, or if it is and you know someone who likes to read these and English isn't, or if you enjoy reading it in a different language, comment it below.
Yeah, this one has more detail because...well...it’s Sherlock. Once again, I’m sorry for being gone and leaving you all on a cliffhanger. But...I give you smut to make up for that. Love you all and thank you.
"No! You do
Both men were glaring at each other, both tense and angry.
"You've been staring," she confirmed. He nodded and sighed heavily. "I shouldn't be this worried on my wedding day," he murmured, going from foot to foot. Neither he or Sherlock were in their suits yet, but he could already feel his stomach twisting.
Sherlock vaguely saw Mrs. Hudson come in again and set a tray of tea beside him, but he knew he wasn't going to drink it anytime soon. His minds was running through every possible way he could keep John away from the case. Away from the danger. But with every single outcome John Watson was still in it.
John turned back onto his side and held back the need to punch his pillow. He swallows and kept his eyes closed. He knew he wouldn't sleep. He never did anymore.
“I can ask what about anything I damn well please. And John is...fine...without me.”
Martha Hudson was used to the words he would bite in anger, or the way he would stride when he was upset. She was used to it, but it still put pressure on her chest when words like that left his mouth.
Sherlock gives John's thighs attention, and he makes sure to leave marks on them. And if no one would know, but it made John’s his. And he found John’s thighs were very sensitive when Sherlock flicked his tongue over the marks.
"You were screaming," John froze. He closed his eyes and counted to ten. He opened them again, and found he could see Sherlock more clearly now.
Silence.
John's voice made it's way down. Mrs. Hudson shook her head, and laid the cups on one of her silver trays.
Oh my god. I feel so *so* bad because I couldn't post anything lately. I...it's been forever it seems since I updated. Im so so sorry I haven't been able to for a while. But...here you are.
"And damage your ego. We wouldn't want that now would we. And what the hell are you doing in my room?"
The last cell he’d been in had been…but she wasn’t doing this. Not this time. Because she was back in Sherrinford and she couldn’t get out. She hadn’t even tried to get out since Sherlock.
gotten turned on hearing that. And no, he hadn’t reached down to palm himself through his boxer. And no, he definitely did not reached under his boxer and touch himself slowly when he listened to John
John's brows furrowed, "What?"
But something held him back. He was afraid. If Sherlock didn't have feelings for him, he would ruin everything with just three words. And that was the last thing he needed. To lose Sherlock. He wasn't going to lose Sherlock. Not now, when John needed him the most. He would do anything to keep Sherlock close, to know he was there.
Yell at me.
I love you all
"I have a case here, four missing people. All found dead in their homes, no prints, house locked from the inside, alarm systems weren't set off." Sherlock didn't answer. He didn't want to leave John, not now. "Sherlock, are you still there?" Sherlock sighed.
Sherlock shook his head and looked at John. "It's not him, John."
There were scratches running across the middle of the walls, like someone had tried to dig their way out with their nails. And Mycroft knew what looked like. He’d watched people try it over and over at Sherrinford. He knew what he was in, but he kept his mind blank of that thought.
"Are we going to go?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He had, after all the time of trying to protect her, killed Eurus.
It was a week before Sherlock woke. And when he did, he didn't talk. Not to Mycroft, at least. But Mycroft would hear him murmuring things to John when he stepped out of the room.
John made his way to the kitchen, the smell of fresh tea in the air. He would have to thank Mrs. Hudson the next time he saw her. He missed when she made it, but now he had to depend on Sherlock for the time being. He made his way down the stairs thinking over what had happened. Sherlock had come into his room because of his nightmares, had held him all night, and then rushed out.
"They should be done by now," John turned to set his cup down before he walked over, only to be rewarded with a sharp gasp sounding and the loud clang of iron hitting linoleum. John started forward cursing, and rushed to Sherlock. The pan was on the ground, forgotten by John.
Lavender tea.
Mycroft stood in the damp room, and he straightened his shirt. He wasn’t….no, his heart wasn’t beating out of his chest at all and the hand that ran through his hair wasn’t shaking. He let out a long breath and looked around the room again. It was blank, and dark, like the sun hadn’t shone into the room for….Mycroft looked around again quickly. For about three months, due to the fading on the walls where the sun had hit it at one time.
John had looked through the pages one day, and saw the words : John's piece. He had loved the sound of the way Sherlock had played it before, and had loved it even more after that. And he felt a deep darkness coming over him as he listened to Sherlock's humming.
It seemed to be Sherlock's knew favorite sound. He loved the feeling of John pressed flush against his side. He shut his eyes. His heart had slowly to it's normal rate from earlier, and a weight that Sherlock didn't even know he'd had lifted.
He ran a hand over his face as he laid in his bed. It was stupid. No, more than stupid. They were best friends. Of course Sherlock wouldn't feel like that about him.
Sherlock goes still again.
After a moment, John swallowed, and continued, "I see them all the time. Its been years, and I can still barely sleep. I have this tightness in my chest at all times, and it's always hard to breathe. I have this fear of being closed out. I can't be in rooms alone anymore, and when I am, it's like that world is crumbling and falling apart.
Sherlock began driving, and John looked out the window. He watched building pass, and then they began to disappear, until almost no houses were seen, and woods and fields took their place. It was soothing, the hum of the engine, the feel of the car driving, and the woods passing by quickly.
Love you bunches
He looks back up and he smiled gently when he saw John was doing to same thing to him - looking at him and taking in every aspect.
"This one is actually good, Sherlock." the other man smiled and John's stomach twisted.
you, he argued again.
John shuddered and tears prickled at his eyes. He pressed his palm against them and let out a ragged breath. He fucking hated Sherlock. He hated him to no extent.
John shook his head and stood from his chair, turning to Greg and Mycroft. "He's going to wake up."
John averted his eyes, leaning back into the fridge.
Maybe John would too.
So, I've been super depressed lately, but I love you all and thought you deserved another chapter. I am so sorry if it's not as good or anything....
"Then prove it!"
Sherlock scoffs.
"I'm in
10 minutes....
"And why not? It's not like you care!"
Sherlock tensed and his eyes widened. He couldn’t answer that. If he did that made it real. That would mean he really did care and he had feelings and that those feelings were towards John and maybe if those feelings were to John and he didn’t have those feelings back well then Sherlock would be fucked.
Silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
He twisted his hands and then let out a long breath. He needed to calm down.
Others did live around them, but they too had grown so used to the fights and the loud noises and the occasional gun shots, that they no longer complained.
He had what he needed, in this room of people whom he cared and loved. He had everything
Sorry this is so late. and short. Im just figuring out how to finish this and Im getting near the end with this chapter. Two or three more should be on the way. Bear with my please. Love you guys and once again im sorry.
And then Sherlock starting with a slow, careful grind.
Comment me your views.
"Fuck," John breathes through clenched teeth.
It hurt like hell to know Sherlock was keeping his secret, to know how much it hurt Sherlock to do so. But he needed it. He couldn't have it getting out. Because only Sherlock knew, and only Sherlock could keep it.
"Mrs. Hudson?" his voice went through the house and he heard the breaking of glass before Mrs. Hudson was hugging him. He laughed and dropped his bag, hugging her back.
Silence.
25 minutes...
“It is,” Sherlock answered. His eyes kept flickering down to the files on Mycroft’s desk, and he wondered what he could do to get them without the older man noticing.
"How in the bloody hell am I suppose to prove it?" John's voice rose and he took another step closer to Sherlock.
Mycroft’s breath left his lungs. It couldn’t be her. But…it sounded like her. Exactly like her. “Who are you?” the question left his mouth before he could take it back.
"What the hell is so important to you , you hide it away from me? Don't you think it's fucking unfair that you're doing that? What the fuck did I come back to because this right here is not worth it. What is
She loved Sherlock and John, she couldn't deny that, but having those two be so in love and not realize it, was devastating.
Silence again.
Sherlock's eyebrows knitted together, and John looked away for a second.
, John cursed to himself. He should've bandaged Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock nodded, "It was Lestrade." John just looked at him.
, Sherlock was so stupid.
John pulls in a stuttering breath, and arches his back. And Sherlock loves that stuttering breath of John’s
He felt angry, his chest constricting, and he had a faint pounding in his head. Although he had no idea
He smelled purley John and Sherlock stifled a groan. God, he loved the way John smelled.
"Oh yeah, what makes me so special? Look, John, no on cares."
"What are the letters?" Another sigh issued from the phone. "Lestrade, what are the letters?"
He shuddered and his hips stuttered against the bed, and he almost reached down, but he would be damned if he allowed himself to touch himself thinking of Sherlock right after he'd fucking
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well it's a stupid choice," his rose as well.
She took the now empty tray and made her way to the door.
Mycroft sat in silence for a moment, “Tell me the truth of one thing, and I’ll get you out by tonight without another comment about anything.”
"Why not?"
John looked down at the leg Mycroft had been limping on. The cane in his hand. The hand at his side.
Sherlock knew that. But it didn't change anything. It didn't change the way Sherlock would stare, taking in every aspect of John when he was engrossed in something, like one of his books.
Every emotion poured into the movements.
John jerked upwards, and hit his head smack against something hard. The something yelped, and John pulled in a breath.
He watched the two men together, how after all the time of pining, they still tried to hide little glances. How they held hands quickly when one of them was looking for words. And when John made his way to the kitchen, he saw the way Sherlock watched him, his face filled with love. When he went to leave, and Sherlock stumbled back into the kitchen, he barely glanced the press of lips between the men before John came out to bid Mycroft farewell.
"He got a call from Lestrade. A case was found, but Sherlock closed off a bit," John's voice was a bit higher than usual and he cleared his throat.
He couldn't just walk away.
And so, when he started this one, he wrote a small note before the actual invitation.
The hand didn't move. John felt tears prick at his eyes. "What did she do to him?" he asked.
He had been stupid. He'd fucking
They had been on the case for three days now. Three long, rainy, dreadful days. Three days Sherlock Holmes had been unable to solve the case. He thought Sherlock would have it figured out within minutes. But it had been three days.
He rushed up the stairs and threw the door open....and his heart sped up even further, his chest rising and falling fast, his mouth agape.
about?" Sherlock turned back to face John fully.
"What was all that about, then?" John just shook his head.
He stood up, his back straight, and he let out a harsh breath.
"Sherlock." A scowl crossed his face. He felt something in his chest constrict, and glanced back at John.
"It hit hard again. Sherlock, uh, heard me." John's voice fell and he took a drink of the tea. He had  missed how she made it. Mrs. Hudson nodded and took his hand.
John turned, but the look on Sherlock's face wasn't rude, or mirthless.
And to make it all that much better, he'd turned down a lovely woman named Mary, who'd seemed quite into him. But he had been Sherlock's, still
He held there and pressed himself closer and his mind ran. Because John Watson was kissing him back.
He couldn't think why he'd be crying until he heard John let out a sharp breath and then Sherlock was being pulled to his feet and away from the mess.
Comment.
Sherlock was tense. John was sitting across from him, his head leaning against the brunette wall, his eyes closed, his lips slightly parted. He was thinking, Sherlock knew that. He had studied John for so long, he knew everything. Yet, John was still foreign to him. Sherlock wanted to kiss John. Wanted to show John he cared. But he couldn't. Because John didn't have feelings for him.
Sherlock jumped when someone touched his shoulder. "We're here, Mr. Holmes," they said and Sherlock jumped from his seat. He rushed off of.....whatever he was in and....and realized Mycroft had a car waiting for him.
As she finished the second cup, the boys' voices rose again.
Oh my god. I feel so *so* bad because I couldn't post anything lately. But I pushed through what I could and I made you all a new chapter. My depression is getting better lately, so I thought I'd celebrate with trying to write you all a new one. Once again, I'm so sorry I didn't post sooner.
Martha Louise Hudson never would have thought she'd have to sit down with an ex-army doctor, and tell him that having PTSD was normal. She never would have thought she'd have to look at the ex-army doctor and see how desperately in love he was with his best friend. Never would she have thought she'd see how in love his best friend was with him.
It was soft, and Sherlock liked the feel of it. The smell of sage, and and a bit like mahogany. Sherlock continued to knead John's hair, and he could feel John stir. The smaller man let out a small puff of breath, and it brushed Sherlock's skin, causing him to shiver.
"Why?" Sherlock's brow furrowed.
"Okay."
Sherlock’s mouth quirked a bit and he held back any remarks he wanted to make. He simply pushed himself up and half struggled with his shirt, pulling it over his head and tossing it somewhere to the side - ah, okay, by the side stand it was.
Leave Kudos
Sherlock tilted his head, "What makes you think I don't?"
Sherlock cut that thought from his head faster than he’d done anything in his life. His brows furrowed and then he was aware he was already in a long hallway. He must’ve lost track of things when he’d been thinking of John, and thinking of John cumming, and god that unif-
John moved and pushed Sherlock on the chest, "You're an ass. You know I didn't just get over you

Sherlock adds another finger, then, watching John’s face contort into pleasure. Sherlock can see his body has never been this ready - has never wanted - Sherlock this bad before. And then Sherlock pulls his fingers out and kisses John softly.
And he always came out with a towel riding low on his hips - those damn fucking bloody hips - and he would walk around the flat, which would pull John to look at his thighs, and fuck how he wanted to have those thighs tighten around his head as he made Sherlock cum from just his mouth.
Ugh. I'm so sorry I haven't been able to update until now. I feel horrible. My everything's been everywhere and even though I finished all my exams - yay - I still have to work my schedule around everything. But Here is this this chapter  i hope you all like it enough - and my next chapter shouldn't take too long as I already have most of it written. Um...yeah. Again, i'm sorry. I love you all though. Thanks for sticking with me.
Hands speed up.
Sherlock's heart sped up. He'd said something wrong. He'd done everything wrong. John knew. John hated him. John didn't want him anym-
"I have no idea."
He looked down to find John had done the same, and he took in the fact of where John’s shirt was - at the edge of the bed, near the floor - before he let his eyes roam. His breath left in a rush, and his eyes flickered from John’s face, to the skin he was showing.
Sherlock turned at the last possible moment when the reached room. He was pretty sure it was his since they hadn’t hit any stairs. He barely moved away when John hit the bed, only to move his hands down to John’s hips and move him up further onto the bed.
I don’t feel London is doing well for me,” Sherlock hissed out.
John was always going to be there, but the last couple days, he was constant. He kept seeing John, and his thoughts kept wandering. He thought, maybe, he could tell John. it's why he hadn't told anyone he figured out the case.
Sherlock raised himself off of the chair and slowly walked to his room. He pulled off his clothes and laid down, curling up to one of his pillows. Yes, that was Sherlock's smell. And it had been on John. He let out a long breath.
"Sherlock!" John's voice rose.
and find out what it was?" Mrs. Hudson asked. John sat for a moment and thought back. Then he set his cup down and sighed.
, he reminded himself. He had wanted to make sure John was okay. But what if he had pushed John away? Accidentally shown how he felt?
John mentally shrugged it off.
John didn't even realize that the moment he started thinking about parts of Sherlock's body, he began rutting against the mattress. He groaned out loud and went faster, thinking of the ways he wanted to take Sherlock in the shower, how he wanted to pound into him through the haze of water beating down on them.
Holmes. He was being pissed at Sherlock. For hiding that Lestrade had found a new body. Or how it had been spelling out Sherlock's name.
"Well, tell me how it was," John looked at her. "How what was?" She gave an exasperated sigh, "The case. The city. What you did," she laughed.
A loud boom echoed throughout the room, and Sherlock looked over to the window. A flash shot through the sky outside, and Sherlock could see the rain was pelting down. The sound of the rain hitting the building was calming. He heard an intake of breath and turned.
So much for not being gay, he thought, and then pushed it away. He’d figure that out later, but right now, Sherlock’s mind was on John.
One of his normal black sleek cars, and Sherlock didn't even wait another moment  before he opened the door and quickly climbed in. And apparently the driver already knew because they began driving the moment the door was closed.
find a way?"
idiot!"
Petrichora_Vellichor, I'm looking at you. I give you this chapter and my next one because of those comments.
you, you idiot, he thought to himself.
And then Sherlock thrusts into him again, and John howls low and desperate, and he goes over the edge, and Sherlock swears he’s gonna lose it.
Sherlock’s mind is swimming, nothing feels important but the feel of John under him, the slow, hot movement of himself inside John, the way he holds onto John, kissing him.
....and then the door flew open and there stood Sherlock, his hair a mess, his shirt a bit undone and rid up on his hip, his eyes wide and his mouth open.
“Do you want to play a game, Mycroft?”
Silence.
"No, because you're Sherlock Holmes."
Mrs. Hudson gave him a look, which he couldn't pinpoint. "How long has it been since the last it happened?" John thought for a moment.
"She was murdered by her husband. She had an affair, and he walked in on it. He got mad, struck her, and she fell, hitting her head on the edge of the island. He cleaned the blood, but residue was still there. He then moved her to the butlers home. He got drunk one night, told a friend of it, and the friend told him off. Told him it was bad, and she was his wife. He should feel so much worse. So he tried to kill himself, but something happened, and he moved his hand, most likely a knock on the door, or a window being rattled. He then got a graze on the head from the bullet. He told the police it was a mugging, and that he was lucky to be alive. After she died and he failed on killing himself, he went after the woman she had an affair with. He killed her. The body was of the wife's lover." John stared at him.
The car ride was long, and Sherlock kept himself humming John's song.
A moment passed. "Are you going to keep your head in there all day?"
Shaking.
And he wouldn't think about the private smile he gave John when he was particularly happy about something, or how he ran his fingers through his hair when he was frustrated.
The statement was simple, but John pushed himself out of the chair, moving to the small-ish kitchen. Sherlock watched as John did the preparations for tea. Bringing freshly drawn, cold water to a boil in the kettle. Standing at the stove, watching the water.
"How did it go?" John swallowed past the lump in his throat.
"It is, Sherlock. It's my choice," John's voice rose.
After of moment of coming down from his high he stood on wobbly legs and peeled his boxers off, tossing them onto the floor and grabbed a washcloth, cleaning himself. He groaned - him still being sensitive from already cumming once.
"What do you want, Lestrade." It wasn't a question.
"I think," he said, "that I do want some food."
"You knew after 8...8 second, and you didn't tell them. We've been here for three days. You've been so upset about not figuring out the case. But, if it wasn't the case, what were you so upset about?"
It was humorous. He was laughing, and kidding, with John.
His back falls into something soft.
"Hold me." his voice was quiet, and he felt Sherlock tense.
He goes slow, but when John pushes down, desperate, he adds another, and John let outs another embarrassing whimper. Sherlock goes faster this time, but soon enough, John is pressing down wanting more and more.
He turned around to find a disheveled Sherlock leaning against his kitchen counter. His hair was a mess, sticking up at odd angles. John took the rest of him in. He was dressed in the clothes he'd rushed out in.
John took a step forward and pointed his finger at Sherlock, "I am
Sherlock moved his hands away from where they’d rested on the bed, either side of John’s body, and he pulled at his own jeans - yeah, the one day he’d actually worn jeans. He hesitated and looked back at John. He hated feeling uncertain, but at the same time he wanted to be uncertain with John Watson.
He did just that. He pulled away just enough to get a breath, his eyes finding John’s blown ones - he already figured his were - and he silently asked if this was happening. If they were actually doing this. John must’ve understood him because he simply nodded, his chest rising and falling rapidly.
happened. You bloody left Sherlock."
Sherlock watched as the muscles in John's stomach tighten for a moment. His boxers slipping a bit, more of his navel exposed. Sherlock's breath hitched. He heard the crack of John's back, and the gasp that came next only led to Sherlock's thoughts worsening.
Sherlock was standing, the pan at his feet, looking at his left hand. John cursed and took Sherlock's wrist, pulling it so he could look at the palm of it better. Sherlock let out a little gasp, but John ignored it, and pulled Sherlock to the sink, turning the water on, and pushing Sherlock's palm under without a word.
"John," the voice was soft and John tensed. Mycroft did not speak that way. But he was now. It was wrong. Bad.
After a couple seconds, he saw John lightly sit in his own chair across from Sherlock.
Sherlock let his vision roam over John - even if he wasn’t fully unclothed - and his heart sped up again. He’d fallen in love with this. Of course he’d gone and fallen in love with someone perfect.
(See the end of the chapter for
John scoffed, "Every time....Every time we think it's over, it gets worse."
Okay, I'm so sorry it took me so long to write this. I just had a death in the family and a bunch of shit went down so it took me forever. I feel bad that I didn't get it done early, so hopefully this is good enough for you guys!
He was still curled up in Sherlock's side, but one of his arms was thrown over Sherlock's stomach, his fingers grazing the slip of stomach that had been released from the sheet he'd thrown over himself.
Fingers gripped his waist.
Hopefully he could go and get this case done as soon as possible.
"I made you some tea, Dears." She said, and John turned, his face calming. She saw him paste on a smile, and then he walked over to her. She handed him one of the cups, and he took a small drink, before he grimaced.
Four fall from his; 'I love you too'
John wanted to open his eyes, to lean forward. He wanted to tell Sherlock
He couldn't just give up.
A crack sounded in the room, a he felt John tense beside him, a muffled sound coming from his throat. He pulled John even closer, wrapping himself around John, his heat mixing with John's.
Mrs. Hudson's face fell, "Oh, John. Were you alright?" John thought for a moment before answering.
"I-I was screaming." It wasn't a question. Now that he focused, he could feel the rawness of his throat. Sherlock nodded. They both stayed quiet for a moment.
"I deserve it because I'm a freak?"
Sherlock tensed. Yes, he had thought about that. But he watched the man kill himself. A small voice in the back of his mind crept up,
John sighed, "When I was young, Harry would lie with me when I had nightmares. Lie with me, Sherlock." Sherlock stayed a moment, then moved slowly. He laid on the bed, with John next to him. John had a pressure in his chest, and his vision was blurry.
John set the cup down in front of him and looked around. "Where is it?"
I wrote a quick chapter. I figured I'd give you two since school is over-loading me, and I don't want to disappoint if I don't get one in next week or by this weekend.
Sherlock. When Sherlock would let him in and talk to him just enough for John to understand. And now John didn't understand a thing.
"You can talk to me, Sherlock," he murmured. Sherlock felt his heart pick up at the single touch and he took a deep breath looking up at John.
Silence.
"You shouldn't"
Sherlock looked at the cup. "Beside me, on the table."
The thought invaded Sherlock's mind. He didn't answer, just turned away, opened the door and shut it behind him.
"B-because you're Sherlock Holmes. You don't....love people."
"Oh, well now, who would the great Sherlock bloody Holmes be in love with!?" John practically yelled.
Sherlock sighed, "I know. I
"I'll sleep but I need to stay here. I can't be at the flat. It's empty without Sherlock and if he wakes up...I need to be here."
Sherlock Holmes, flatmate of John Watson - 221B Baker Street and part of the Yard’s criminal questionings, is given permission to leave the city of London, England at any given time he wishes. No questions will be asked about his whereabouts after, and none is to tell of where he goes. No one shall touch Sherlock Holmes in any way, and none shall speak to him. He is given to go wherever he likes, and he shall be treated accordingly to his place, and mine.
"Did you
30 minutes and 45 seconds.....
Sherlock wrote the letter in red ink, his letters swirling across the paper. He had done this so many times already he'd lost count. He wanted everyone there. Even if John didn't agree, he needed everyone there. And maybe, just maybe, John was right about them adding a person.
A sound went through the room - like a speaker coming on - and Mycroft tensed. He looked around quickly but found nothing that could lead to the sound.
So, we got snow here. 8 inches! Hope some of you got snow too. Love you guys.
John came back and pulled Sherlock's hand up so his palm was facing up as well. He pulled something out Sherlock didn't think about and started on Sherlock's hand.
HVYUDGBSGFDYIAHBVGUSXYGBHJ.
1 hour and 15 minutes...
"Will you leave, to come back here?" Sherlock let out a frustrated sigh.
