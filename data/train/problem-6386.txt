“I get that Tony. I just want to be there for you.” Stephen tried. Tony knows he does. He wanted to be involved in Tony’s life as much as possible. He wanted to be involved with the important people in his life. And it was a nice gesture, but it wouldn’t work out that well because, everyone still hadn’t warmed up to Stephen yet and Stephen hadn’t realized that.
“Likewise, brother” she retorted, returning his smile. Although she tolerated both her younger brothers, she was closer to Loki than she was to Thor for obvious reasons.
She heard Tony sneer from the floor above them, remarking that Thor branded his perfectly manicured lawn every time he went to and from Asgard. Torunn smiled to herself and walked swiftly to meet her family as they drew nearer to the mansion. When they were within speaking distance, Torunn curtsied, before her mother and father. They were King and Queen after all. “Father. Mother.” She spoke respectively before Thor scooped her up into a bear hug.
he thought. He couldn't imagine caring for a baby at this stage in his life and to think, he had been considering it with
“Peter.” He recognized Wade’s voice. He’d hardly ever said his actual name. It was always some nickname. “I missed you so much.” He continued and Peter could feel himself sinking deeper into the hug, into the comforts of his presence. He missed Wade so much, his body was saying one thing and his mind another. He snapped back into his senses. Wade had left him. For four months! Peter hadn’t heard even a little peep from him. Wade was radio silent, MIA, unreachable, untraceable. So how dare he come back, hugging Peter like nothing happened? Like everything was okay. It wasn’t.
Tony stared at Peter for a second, his eyes narrowed. “Do I want to know why you did that?”
“Wonderful.” Maria exclaimed. “Morgan never wants to garden with me.” Morgan groaned, faking anger at her grandmother’s words.
“And what happens when she proves you wrong?” Tony put forward because that was likely the outcome and he – they needed to prepare for that.
“Just a guy I met the other day. We’re just getting to know each other. It’s nothing serious.”
Clint and Laura exchanged looks. “And they’re both still kids,” she continued. “They make mistakes.” Natasha lived by that. Everyone made mistakes. It was only human nature. She’d made so many mistakes in her past but she’d redeemed herself over the years and she believed everyone deserved a chance to do the same.
Steve and Peggy had just stopped by to see their friends Howard and Maria Stark. Peggy had found Maria quickly and they were in living room catching up. Steve wasn’t quite sure where Howard was so he made his way to their kitchen to get a few drinks for everyone. He was a little surprised to see Tony behind the drink bar, casually making what seemed to be a dirty martini. He hadn’t known Tony was home already for summer break and Steve couldn’t help but admire him for the few seconds before he noticed he had entered the room. Tony looked relatively the same since the last holiday he saw him, back in April for Easter. His dark hair was just a bit shorter but his eyes were still the same beautiful chocolate brown. His lips still had a little rosy pink tint to them and his skin was still slightly tanned and evidently flawless. Why he was checking out Howard and Maria pride and joy? He didn’t know.
“How’s your head feeling, sweetie? No more flashes, right?” Tony asked Harley, placing two fingers at his temple while using his other hand to turn his head around, so they were face-to-face. Steve wasn’t even surprised Tony already knew about this. Their kids never had an issue sharing their problems with Tony as opposed to him; Tony was always the ‘softer’ parent and as the little geniuses they were they often took advantage of that.
He finally caught on. “Pep. I don’t do doctors.”
“I think it’s someone close. Really close.” Carol butt in before Nat could respond.
“Why so?”
“Eavesdropping.” Tony noted, giving Steve the once over as he approached him.
“I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony said truthfully. He didn’t know what was going through his head in the moment, why he was thinking what he did. Why he was all for Anna killing Stephen in cold blood, knowing well enough that she would be getting away with it, no problem. Like all her other murders.
“You really are paranoid.” She sighed, sitting before the screen. “Why? When I’ve already been bond to you by my father’s decree. I am yours whether I like it or not. His word is law.”
“Harls.” She spoke clearly. Harley smiled even wider at the nickname. “What’s up?” Torunn set her phone down on her vanity so she could grab a brush to aid in detangling her golden mane.
“Hey.” Jacob greeted Nertha who was watching people with a scowl on her face.
Amelia came over and sat by Morgan staring at the picture in awe as well. “And based on his posts he’s single and ready to mingle.”
They break from court and Steve knows they’re losing by a land slide. Nova’s last resort is to have Steve take the stand and appeal to the court from a hurting mother’s point of view. Steve agrees without a doubt. He’ll try anything to win Nicky back. Steve leaves for the bathroom and sure enough Tony’s latest boy toy follows. The boy is short and small. Brown hair and even darker eyes.
“Surely even you must be able to acknowledge true beauty when you see it.”
“What’s going on?” Anna directed her question to her twin. She had been forming a closer bond with her older sister as opposed to her twin. Peter thought that to be unfair and made sure to spend as much time with Anna as possible.
Anna clawed at his naked back causing Remy to groan in pain and slam into her more hurriedly. She was coming around Remy and him in her when they both heard the bedroom door being opened. Anna panicked, absorbing Remy’s powers by her own free will and fired a blast of kinetic energy at the door.
Brooklyn also had nothing of Tony’s. Not his nose, his eyes or eye shape or ears and clearly not his hair. Tony really felt as if he was just the carrier of a baby that was 100% Steven Grant Rogers and nothing else but to be fair, 3 of their other children looked more like him than Steve. So he could have this one.
“So who’s taking care of you?” Stephen looked sympathetic. “You don’t look so good.” He added that for jokes, Tony supposed.
And it's also my birthday today 🎂
“Honey.” Tony whispered, scooting over to Peter’s end of the sofa and reaching out for him. Peter flinched. Steve’s worried expression soften a bit as he took his seat by Morgan again.
Amelia had found her powers to be very powerful and potentially, destructive from her lessons with her father. It was scary at first, not knowing she had them and not knowing how to use them. She always considered herself as “normal” and it was taking quite a bit of adjusting but at this point in her life, with four months of her father’s guidance, she’d mastered it indefinitely.
But Steve started to roll his hips and grabbed both of Tony’s palms with his, pinning him down on the bed. The sound of his balls slapping against Tony’s skin filled the room, thereafter with their breathy moans. He enjoyed the squeeze around him each time he pulled out partly and he could feel Tony's walls gripping him and each time he slammed right back in and Tony's bed would move with him. Tony let out a gasp each time, surprised at the force Steve was rocking and wrecking his body. His eyes watered because
After the service, Maria, Harley, Morgan and Peter stayed with Sharon and the rest of Peggy’s family to offer their condolences. Steve was able to leave Sharon’s side when Tony sought him out.
That was over an hour ago. Tony hadn’t left any detail out. Due to Steve’s lack of knowledge on technology, it took him some time to comprehend the act of chipping. Steve repeated the word, trying to make sense of it all. Left in a state of bewilderment 17 years ago regarding the reason he and Nat would sleep together, Steve now knew Justin Hammer was to blame.
“It’s genetic.” Tony stated so quietly both Anna and Steve thought they imagined it, But Steve started to think long and hard about it. Professor Xavier had mentioned something along the lines of her
“Why don’t we get married?”
Stephen had thought he’d be welcomed but Tony shut him down, letting him know it was only family just so Anna would feel comfortable. Stephen was upset. Tony didn’t see him as family and so his thoughts brought him back to Steve Rogers and how well he and Tony were getting along nowadays. It really angered him.
Clint saw the way Vision stared at Wanda. He knew that look. It was the same way he looked at Laura when they first met and it was the same way he looked at her now, 18 years and three kids later.
“Or I will at this point.” Anna said, throwing her head back with laughter. It was an 18-plus-year-old secret that needed to be let out already. Long overdue, really.
birthday next month. With everything going on, he must have scheduled a date with Stephen on the same night as family dinner night without realizing it.
“Yeah, what about him?” Morgan asked.
"But he still has some unresolved feelings. He has a lot of anger still." Steve noted, wiping his eyes with the tissues he was offered.
Bucky’s eyes met Sam’s in the mirror, his eyebrows creased in wander. “Why? We’ve only been here a week.”
And they worried about him. Because who was this Steve Rogers? That he'd met...what was it? Three months ago and they were already engaged. This was the first time they were hearing about him. And this was another young one - 26 years younger than their father's 54 years. They just didn't understand how their father couldn't see that these young men weren't actually in love with him.
It made him smile after all this physical and emotional pain.
“Torunn has a boyfriend.” Amelia let out. Torunn looked mortified. Morgan looked surprised. Torunn’s never had a boyfriend. None that they knew of at least. Torunn was very confused.
“That’s not love.”
“That’s not me, Peter.” Michelle replied. Peter knew that. That was more of Harley’s vein line of work. “I actually kind of like him,” and she was smiling. Which was good; she’d been hung up over Amelia for far too long now when Calvin was standing right there with arms wide open.
“Don’t bullshit me Rogers. I’m bloody rich.” He was gritting his teeth. Steve’s back was towards the lake now and with every word that passed Tony’s lips he was taking a step backwards. “I’ll send you a check. Get rid of it.” And the next thing he knew, Tony gave him a shove and he was falling into the water. Steve sunk under the lake upon impact. He was under for a few seconds and then resurfaced, coughing out water, searching for air and reaching out for the ledge of the dock to pull himself up. Tony was already half way down the dock heading towards his house refusing to spare Steve a second glance.
. “I’m actually due to paint a portrait of a model today.” He informed him.
“You don’t think that’s a good idea.” Pepper wondered. It was a good an idea as any. They had to figure something out.
Neither Tony nor Peter got to answer before Sharon was chattering again. “You’re going to have a little sister.” And she had the audacity to reach out and grabbed both of Peter’s cheeks as if she were talking to a child.
Chapter 6 is coming. I promise.
were standing over him, panic in their eyes and in their voices. Morgan, Peter, Harley and Anna crowded around him.
Pepper sat across from Remy. He was daring her to speak with the use of his powers of literal persuasion. She called him over like Carol had suggested and decided she should speak with him before Amelia. He was the root of the problem after all. He was influencing plenty of her choices. Pepper just didn’t know it was an actual power of his. She just figured he was extremely manipulative. Eventually she gave in though, getting straight to the point.
“Carol, if this is your way of getting close to Thor and Sif –” because Rhodey wasn’t buying that. Not for a second.
They’d have to figure this out at some point but for right now, he begged her not to mention this to Tony. He didn’t stay to hear her response. He needed to leave. He’d cheated on his husband and couldn’t even remember it.
“No. You stay here. I’ll sleep in the other room.” Carol watched him leave.
“Last one. I promise.” Tony swore. He and Steve had talked about Steve getting his tubes tied and Tony had agreed a thousand percent. This would be their last child for sure. They were done after this.
“On it.” She stated. Stephen would get the help he needed to get to the ER before he completely bled out. The moment he was gone and everyone somehow managed to get back to the festivities of the party, Steve turned to face Tony and Anna.
“We’ll figure it out.” She finished, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him deeply.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve put his fork down and took a sip from his glass. “I mean after years of being Captain America; saving the world…” Steve drawled on, very nonchalant. “…I don’t see why I can’t indulge in my other skills. It pays well enough.”
“Hey.” Jaime spoke out, pulling Morgan from thoughts. She blinked a few times, focusing on the source of the voice, realizing her phone was in still in her hand. “You okay?” The 17-year-old asked, rubbing one hand in his red mane of hair – Romanov red. Only Aunt Natasha, her sister and her children had that red colour. And his blue eyes filled with concern.
Steve flipped out at that. “Why would you lie like that?!" What ever happened to doctor-patient confidentiality? He almost launched at Gonzalez who pulled back in shock. Nova hurried to calm him down because this outburst was not going to help their case.
“In a second.” Stephen replied, changing into just a boxer brief. He got out and joined Tony on the bed, pulling him away from the screen in front of him, so he’d fall back on the bed with him. Stephen wrapped his arms around him. Tony giggled. “He was really sucking up to me.”
But “I think. I need a moment.” He explained. It was too much. Carol released his hand and took a step back. “Yeah. I’ll sleep in another room.” She went to grab a pillow and a blanket when Rhodey stopped her, taking them from her.
Steve figured.
’ each other?”
“Yes. You do.” He shot back. “You ran over to her, wiping her tears away like all she’d done was fall and bruise herself.”
Tony pinched Steve’s arm. “Stop torturing my son.” Steve rubbed the irritated spot on his arm while Tony joined his kids on the sofa, placing a kiss on Harley’s cheek. “I know you don’t do any of that.”
And I don't really know what happens medically when people get strangled. Luckily this is all fiction.
“Yeah. Why not?” He wanted the two most important people in his life to meet and he could already tell they’d get along well.
“Good.” He took a sip of his coffee.
“Yeah.” Rhodey said, realizing that Jacob was calling him. He let Pepper know and ended the call with her.
“What are you thinking, baby?” Steve felt like he was floating. He felt intoxicatingly high, trapped in a bubble with Tony in his hold.
Tony was conflicted with himself. He lets go of Steve’s hand and he reaches a hand up to hold the back of Steve’s neck, pushing him into a kiss. Steve doesn’t hesitate. He never does when Tony kisses him. He gladly melts into the kiss. Tony’s tongue is slipping pass his lips and searching his mouth. He wants this and soon Tony is pushing him back on the sofa and yanking Steve’s shorts and underwear down his legs to access is hole. Tony never breaks the kiss, only reaching down to unzip his pants and free his dick. Then he’s sinking into Steve and Steve is crying out in pain because Tony just entered him without any prep.
“Dad. I really don’t like what you did to mom. I never did but finding out who it was with really upset me.” Morgan lectured.
- Features the annual Christmas Party that proves to be very eventful!
Pepper wanted to question her further, when she realized she was already running late for work. “Whatever gets you out of my pyjamas and out of my fridge.” She bid Carol a farewell and headed out her front door. "See you later."
“I tried to.” Steve glared at Tony.
“What for?” Pepper asked, taking the glass from Tony and having a sip after sitting in one of the chairs facing his desk.
Comments and Kudos are welcome!
“I’d like to see you try,” she challenged. And Valkyrie spoke again before Thor could. “I’ve met someone. When we visited.” Thor stayed quiet encouraging her to go on. “She’s very distracting.”
“How ‘bout you get something to eat?” He suggested. Steve took a breath, rising from his seat and heading over to the food table. Sam shouted something at him before he came out of earshot. “And get your niece a red velvet cupcake.” Those were Winter’s favourites.
"I dated around. Nothing serious." That was a lie. Tony had actually proposed to several other men during the period after he divorced Alex and before he married Daniel. He was desperate to find a partner whom he could share his life with. He just wasn't going to tell Steve that.
Today she was at Morgan’s in her room with her and Torunn. The girls attempted to watch a movie to get Morgan’s mind of it, but it seemed like every movie they chose had some pregnant character in it. Amelia just resorted to playing some music in the background while they talked. Steve, who was practically living at the Stark Mansion had gone out of his way to make the girls a bunch of pastries. The chocolate chip cookie Amelia had just eaten melted in her mouth and she had to give Morgan’s dad his props. He truly was the better cooker – and baker between him and Tony. No question about it.
“You do any shit to hurt Peter and I will find a way to end you. Everyone has a weakness.”
“Good morning sir,” FRIDAY announced through the speakers in Tony’s room. “Morning Friday,” Tony replied, eyes still closed and unconsciously reached out to the other side of his bed. Of course there was no one there, another morning of waking up alone. He somehow always forgot that Steve Rogers wasn’t his husband anymore and it had been a year since the divorce was finalized. Three years since he last had sex. Three years since someone else pleasured him, he thought, finally opening his eyes and reaching into his bedside table drawer for his vibrator. He pulled down his pajama pants and started massaging himself and an inch away from inserting the vibrator when Friday spoke again.
“You never want to…” He tilted his head to the side, widen his eyes to indicate what he was trying to say but didn’t. Wade picked up on what he was referring to quicker than usual.
“Why not? Winter loves it. Nakia said she’s a gem. Said she’ll make a great Queen. I like it here…” Sam scoffed at his response. He already knew Bucky liked it here. He decided he’d be better off being truthful.
Wade:
“We are.” Steve answered and Harley looked at them, with betrayal in his eyes.
he thought.
“What time is it?” Morgan questioned, journeying into the kitchen to give Binx some breakfast.
Steve’s eyebrows narrowed. “I don’t believe that.”
Strange was smirking. “What the hell is your deal, Strange?” Steve questioned. He had the audacity to laugh. “What’s in this for you?”
He eventually moved away from Pepper and greeted Amelia prior to leaving. Another anticipated conversation followed.
Remy’s phone dinged with the new message. It was Amelia and he wondered why his daughter would be asking that specific question. How had she known? News tended to travel so quickly within this family which had proven to be quite irritating at times. Remy settled on typing out a very vague reply.
"I mean, no one does." Harley quipped and teasing his little sister for stating the obvious.
“You guys have been hanging out a lot.” Rhodey noted. He wasn’t bothered by that. They both had friends they spent a lot of time with. But between his job, her still being a superhero and finding time for everyone else, they barely had time for each other these days. And the fact that she had become so close with Valkyrie in such a short span of time had Rhodey feeling a little bamboozled.
“Anthony, my dear, is that you?” her voice was weak, and her frail hand was reaching out to him. Only she and Howard ever called him by his full name and he absolutely hated it but what kind of person would it make him if he didn’t humor a poor elderly lady who just suffered a stroke. That could have been his mom. And he struggled to get rid of that thought the moment it crossed his mind. He watched his mother now, strong and healthy, smiling sadly at Peggy.
“How about Steve? Maybe he has another crazy ex running around.” Hope suggested. She glanced at Natasha and spoke in her direction. “Nat, what do you think? You’re close with Steve.”
“The Goddess of Thunder.” Loki announced “And the Goddess of Deceit. Very impressive,” he commented, as Nertha straighten her attire and Torunn took her seat by her Uncle again.
“Wade.” Tony called out. Wade quickly pushed Peter away when he found the source of the voice calling his name.
I would also love to hear if you guys had any favourite parts or favourite characters or favorite couples and why?
Steve remained quiet a minute longer. “Yeah. I do.” He took a strawberry from the tray and Tony shot him a look, a bit agitated by Steve’s audacity to steal the food he had made
The Sequel is up. It's part 2 of this Series, called "Life After..."
Steve’s jaws visibly tighten. “Why do you think I need to hear this, Harley?” He kept quiet after that and Steve continued. “Clint is going to put an arrow through your arm and no one is going to stop him.”
“Of course I do.” Carol stated seriously. “I have never loved anyone as much as I love James.”
“Asgard’s future King.” Nertha remarked so only Torunn could hear.
“Use Romanov.” Jaime butt in. Morgan hesitated. “Kozlov isn’t even my last name.”
“Thank you, Steve.” Wanda appreciated his kindness, wisdom and approval. “I told Pietro and he laughed.”
Nat reached them, “You guys are really leaving?”
Tony couldn’t control his blush or hide his smile. “Yes. I want to try.” No doubt about it. He just needed a moment. He wanted to, “Take things slow?” But he was asking. He needed them to be on the same page.
Jacob had just got off the phone with Amelia and decided to call his mother. Hopefully, she wasn’t too busy or off world. Amelia had let the cat (flerken?) out of the bag about his mother’s living arrangements. She’d apparently been staying at Aunt Pepper’s since the middle of March and it was almost April. Why Amelia waited so long to mention this to him, he didn’t know but he supposed it wasn’t her place to say and it just slipped out.
“Nice.” He mused and he wasn’t even aware of the fact that they had walked passed a very jealous Nertha.
” He admitted. Justin Hammer had ruined them, completely where picking up the pieces and putting things back together wouldn't be easy.
, she thought, still staring up at him, into his blood thirsty eyes. She had before, countless times and wasn’t opposed to doing it again.
“You should have chosen me, Tony.” Justin argued. Tony rolled his eyes in his helmet as he and Rhodey kept on fighting. “I thought you’d have left Steve after his cheating incident but that was a lost cause.” He finished, his hands in his pockets as the scene unfolded.
Harley stopped his eating from the small plate he still had in his hand. Morgan raised an eyebrow and Peter looked from his mother to Stephen in the span of two seconds. Well that was unnecessary, Morgan wanted to say and she looked at her siblings. She knew they were thinking the same thing. Tony was rolling his eyes and Stephen eventually let out a smile and a little laugh seeing the look on their faces. Everyone managed to crack a smile in the end however and soon all three Stark-Rogers kids had disappeared into the party in search of their friends.
“You know. Now that I think about it,” He kissed Tony’s ear. “You’re right.”
“Sir, Peter and Morgan are approaching your room.”
Tony wanted to have a family dinner. His children were resenting him except for Anna, and he knew it. When Morgan arrived at the mansion for dinner, she was surprised to find the dining room empty. She called out, a homemade dish in her hand and a response came from Peter as he joined her in the dining area.
“It’s more than that, isn’t it?”
Tony was still swiping across the screen on his phone, when Stephen put his arm around him and drew his body closer to him. “Let’s go to bed, babe.” He took the phone with his other hand, resting it on his bedside table before helping Tony to straddle him.
“Really? I didn’t know that.”
James Romanov was always a happy kid growing up. He grew up with two parents who loved him. A mother in Tanya Romanov-Kozlov who was loving and caring and a father whom he always knew wasn’t biological in Misha Kozlov. He also had two younger siblings who he always looked out for - Ana and Levi. His aunt Natasha also meant everything for him so finding out he had been lied to all his life, hurt more than he could ever imagine. That the woman he called mom was actually his aunt and his aunt was actually the woman who gave birth to him. And that his real father was Captain America himself, Steve Rogers.
“It’s confirmed.” Pepper swallowed a lump in her throat when she thought of the explosion incident again. “He thinks they share the same powers, which is rare apparently.” Carol hung on to each word. She always enjoyed talk of super-enhanced abilities. “He also thinks she might have more.”
“Sam,” T’challa spoke and their eyes met, finally. “I do not know the nature of your issues with James,” Of course he wouldn’t. Bucky wasn’t one to go around airing out their martial problems. Steve was the only exception. “But I know how much love you two share for each other.” The King continued. “And the child created from that love.” Sam thought of
. Steve and Tony had a small party for her birthday complete with Pepper and baby Amelia, Carol, Rhodey and a 2-year-old Jacob, Bucky, Nat and Maria. The party was fun. Everyone had left except for Nat. Tony was cleaning up when she approached him.
“It’s been years since the red room,” Bruce shot back and Natasha raised an eyebrow. That was a touchy subject and had it been anyone else, they’d probably lose an eye for that comment. It was necessary nevertheless, to bring up her past. She couldn’t fully get over it after so many years. It should be understandable why Tony couldn’t let go of what Steve did.
“I don’t know of any.” Nat responded honestly. She couldn’t think of an ex of Steve’s or Tony’s that wasn’t mentioned.
The doctors then worked on getting the second baby out. She came out with the same head of brown hair as her brother except for one streak of white. That was unforeseeable but what shocked Tony and Steve was the fact that she wasn’t reacting, was barely moving and struggling to breathe. One of the doctors cut the umbilical cord and rushed her over to a machine that could hopefully stabilize her breathing.
“Wade, are you trying to make me a step-mom?” Peter teased.
“Yes, Sir. Mr. Hammer.” Gary responded in a heartbeat.
Gamora stayed seated around a table with them, their eyes focusing on Thor and Quill as they talked. Sif also had her 6-month-old son, Magni seated on her lap.
“You didn’t answer my question.” He pointed out, sitting on the ledge. Then Peter remembered Ned. “Ned? Sorry. I’ll text you later.”
“And I’m sorry Pete.” Steve swapped seats with Harley and Peter let Steve hug him. “I know we’re tough on you. I just want you to be better than your brother and sister. They’re already just so fucked up.”
He was frantic as he gave birth. The room was hectic, and Tony screamed in agony at each contraction. There was a scare when Tony’s heart had stopped for a few but very crucial seconds. The babies were suffocating, and the doctors had to work fast. They put an oxygen mask over Tony and proceeded with the removal of the babies. When the first baby was pulled out Tony was already breathing on his own again.
Not long after and they were wrestling with each other’s lips. Steve was eagerly searching his mouth with his tongue and Tony was sucking on his tongue. Steve’s hands slipped under his shirt and started playing with his nipples. Tony moaned into his mouth. Steve was hard and Tony was wet. Steve could always tell when his boyfriend was horny from the little squirming movements he did and the evident clasp of his thighs. Steve pulled away when he felt Tony’s hand on his cock through his pants.
Court went on a break once again for Steve’s sake. Judge Brooks stated she'd heard all she needed to at this point and was ready announce her decision.
"Oh Tony. I'm so sorry."
“You’re
“Have any of you heard anything more about the Hammer investigation?”
Also. I don't know how court works lol..
“We are. I’m almost finished here.” She motioned for Carol to walk with her, making their way to the elevator. Pepper was still typing away on the tablet in her hand as their conversation progressed. After some time, Carol inquired about how the party planning was going.
As the party progressed around the couple, Harley kept an arm around Torunn’s naked waist, thanks to the design of her dress and pressed kisses to her lips while hiking up the front of her dress in the front. Fortunately for the two, the table and its cloth concealed their fondling from everyone’s eyes. Torunn felt warm fingers on her inner thigh and a moan slipped from her mouth into his.
She awaited his advice, but all Loki could provide was, “This sounds like a conversation for your mother. The only person I’ve ever truly loved was my mother, your grandmother, Frigga.” Loki had no experience in the romantic feelings department.
Pepper was still laughing away, and Carol couldn’t tell if it was from the use of her name or because of her situational relationship. “Oh yeah. Let’s definitely not question it.” It was weird.
“Yeah. I thought it was weird at first –” Rhodey began. They were lounging around in Tony’s kitchen, while he fixed them both a drink.
“Bottom line is, we were and still are a family. That never changed even if they split up. And I bet things will be fine for your family too, no matter what your parents end up doing.”
Bruce hummed. “Why?”
Peter got around to calling his father but was loss for words when Steve finally picked up. “Pete?” Steve questioned over the phone. His voice was ragged and laced with sleep.
“Let’s go eat.” Tony suggested. Steve reluctantly pulled away when Tony announced to him, that he needed to grab his phone from their bedroom. Everyone else in the sitting area headed off in the direction of the kitchen. When he retrieved his phone, it happened to have a new message on it.
“Okay.” She smiled as her eyes glowed and lightning formed around her, transporting herself from her room to the comforts of Harley’s dorm room. She appeared in the middle of the room and Harley stood up instantly to pull her into a hug. She rested her head on his shoulder and Harley sighed, happy to be holding her. He needed this. He hadn’t been this close to her in months or ever really, and he missed it.
It happened all the time really, even Sif and Thor’s love budded from an arranged marriage.
“I bet she’s ready to come out.” Steve commented, placing a kiss on the spot where he could make out the imprint of a little foot under Tony’s skin. They had long decided on names for the baby. Morgan if it’s a girl and Peter if it’s a boy.
“I love you so much more.” Tony finally responded, caressing Steve’s back as he struggled to catch his breath in the crook of Tony’s neck.
"But with Daniel, I was happy for the first time in years and I married him. We were trying to have a baby. But he told me the day he moved out that he was birth control the entire time."
“Okay. I need some proof here.” Steve started, leaning against a set of counters with Tony by his side. “How did you three decide that your sister, your own flesh and blood was a killer?”
“That’s no way to speak to a Queen,” she mocked, smoothing out her dress and resting her hand on her belly again before reaching behind, a knife now concealed in the sleeve of her dress.
Tony removed some of the pressure off Justin’s chest so he could speak. “She’s alive.”
He typed out a quick text.
“I told your father I didn’t need a guard.”
Carol spotted Pepper giving out orders to people, in preparation for Tony’s annual Christmas party in less than two months. “Hey” she approached her, “I thought we were still on for lunch today.”
“But I am a killer, Dad. You know that.” She explained and Morgan, who had been watching silently, caught on to that. She was almost certain now Anna had killed Hammer and their father – their parents knew.
Anna thanked Torunn for her kind words. She tucked a bit of her white streak of hair out of the way. Morgan then cleared her throat, leaning forward and breaking Harley’s gaze on Torunn.
He went into labor a week before his due date. Steve would like to think he must have been stressed or something else went wrong, or maybe SJ was ready to come into the world. Whatever the reason, SJ was coming. The entire labor process was a blur to him. One minute he was being prepped for a C-section and the next the doctor was placing a very bloody baby on his chest.
?” Wade’s latest nickname for him. Wade was whining. He wanted them to save themselves for each other.
“Tony. I just don’t trust him. There’s something off about him.” Steve had the audacity.
Loki had been tossing around in someone’s bed a few minutes ago when he remembered Tony’s annual Christmas Party. He flew into his clothes and conjured up a few gifts before pulling up a portal to the Stark Mansion. He ended up on the floor below the first time and then cast his spell again to get to the floor where the party actually was.
“It was a shocker. No one could have predicted that.” Amelia chimed in. “But we can’t help sympathizing for others, especially family.”
Anna tried to smile to lighten the mood while Wade offered his own apology. He then went on to suggest that Peter should do a streak of white in his hair as well. Anna explained it wasn’t a choice; she was just born that way.
Steve pulled away with a pop in that moment, so apparently not. Tony opened his eyes soon after and held his face in his hands, meeting those blue eyes.
“And he wants to help her harness that?” Carol realized.
Steve frowned; his mouth opened slightly with a gasp of disbelief. Tony had never said that before. He knew Tony wasn’t in the best of moods that day, but he never knew Tony considered it one of his worst days.
“Dad.” Harley said in exasperation. “That’s crazy. I’m so sorry.” Harley was closer to his mother than his father but even he wasn’t insensitive to such a matter. He couldn’t imagine how scary that must have been and his father was the bravest, strongest person he knew. He could handle anything, but this made him emotional as he had every right to be.
But maybe this was Tony's fault. He didn't like being alone and perhaps he saw something that wasn't there with Daniel. He thought they were in love but it didn't take too long for Daniel to start cheating and only use him for his money. Peter and Harley saw it and they weren't sure if their father was just overlooking the obvious so he wouldn't have to be alone.
Stephen Strange was standing a mere 5 feet away from him, watching as Tony hugged himself.
“It’s not necessary. We don’t need a piece of paper to show our love. We don’t need society telling us how to live.” She leaned forward and placed a kiss on his lips. They just needed each other and not anyone else’s opinions or views.
Tony saw Steve hesitate. He saw him place a hand over his bump protectively and Tony knew he had every right to be cautious but he wanted to talk. “I just want to talk.”
He flipped them over, staying buried inside her as they shared another heated kiss. He finally pulled out of her when he felt his eye lids getting heavier, but he kept his hands in her hair as they slumbered.
Bucky pulled his arm back to his side. “Anything?”
Tony hugged him. “I’m sorry.” He mumbled his apology in the crook of his neck as he stood on his tippy toes. Steve pulled back to stop himself from tearing up. He was really hurt, and he wondered what he had done to deserve this.
“I have a mother and a father already.” He had said to Steve, Natasha and Tony who was always by Steve's side. “I could have gone my whole life without knowing this and I’d be okay.” It was true.
“No.” Steve assured him. “Just painting from the chest up, fully-clothed.”
“I suppose...” and he trailed off, another interaction, catching his and soon Torunn’s attention.
“No.” Her voice was low.
He eventually rang the doorbell, the door opened moments later, and Sam was shocked to see T’challa on the other side.
Morgan groaned, falling flat on her back on her bed. Nathan turned to look at her. “We were stupid. I was stupid,” she remarked, staring up at him. Morgan felt him running his fingers through her hair and it put her mind at ease. Then she pulled herself up to meet his lips with her own and he willingly deepened the kiss. She reached for his belt buckle, trying to undo his pants when he stopped her and started to push away. They were both out of breath and Nathan tried to expound on why they shouldn’t be doing this considering the predicament they were in. Except, he didn’t stop himself from kissing where her neck met her shoulder. Morgan struggled to pry herself away. She had to be the more resilient of the two.
“Jaime, you aren’t on any social media, right?” Nathan started, sitting by Morgan again and wrapping an arm around her shoulder.
“More than the usual?” Peter asked sincerely because his twin did act a little odd at times. “No.”
“What’s wrong, baby?”
Harley had talked to Jacob the most about his arranged marriage to Torunn. He was against the idea initially but the more he thought about it, the more welcoming he was to it. The thought of being with Torunn Thorsdottir and being bonded together by marriage sounded great to him because he hadn’t fully grasped it yet, but he was falling for her, in every possible way.
“Let me go Morgan.” Anna stated and she enhanced the pain for Morgan. She didn’t budge so Anna held onto the other hand to absorb her super strength and shoved her away. Morgan went flying into the nearest wall which was the barrier between where they stood and the seating area of the newlyweds.
“I’m – ugh –” Tony struggled to speak with Steve still meeting him with each upward thrust.
“Gosh. I can just feel you gripping me,” Steve managed to say. He was getting closer and Tony could tell by his hurried thrusts. Not because anyone could walk in on them in this moment. Nope. Definitely not that.
“Natasha Romanov.” She responded plainly.
Pepper then voiced her thoughts. “Why’d you come looking for Amelia?”
Steve didn’t like Wade Wilson. That much was common knowledge but for Peter’s sake he would tolerate him. However, he didn’t like seeing his son wrapped up in Wade’s arms. Steve had gathered his children minus Harley to share with them the new information about Hammer’s case but was greeted with the scene before him when he entered the living room. Morgan and Anna had taken seats elsewhere in the room, but Wade was still joined at the hip with Peter. He kept his eyes on the couple as he took a seat across from them and cleared his throat, in annoyance. Luckily, Wade caught on and moved away a few inches.
“Thank you.” And then there was an awkward pause. Carol had to remind herself to play nice.
“I just find that a little weird, babe.” He leaned closer to her. “Just yesterday, she was totally against it.” Harley explained. He wanted to believe she gained interest overnight, but Anna was always so persistent about her lack of interest or knack for technology, in any way, shape or form.
“Come on Justin. Let’s settle this like adults.” Tony mocked, sticking a landing and then retracting his helmet in the nanotech suit. “You can’t still be bumped about me rejecting you after one date.”
Ned heard this and responded for Peter. “Oh are you talking to Wade?”
“You look gorgeous sweetheart.”
“It takes time that’s for sure but don’t hinder the process any longer.” His eyes darted back and forth from both his children. “Talk to your father, let him know how you feel and try to move on. It’s hard to forget, I know.”
“Maybe Cassie Lang.” Morgan suggested.
“You say as you seduce me and get me naked.” He quipped, running his fingers through Stephen’s hair who sighed in awe at the stimulation.
Pepper laughed. “Are we calling her that now?” Rhodey didn’t want to be a part of the discussion any further so he left the two women to talk.
who got pass his security. He thought he’d gotten rid of him years ago.
Silence followed for only a minute as every one looked between each other. No one had anything else to share. Except Anna.
He wasn't sure how he'd tell his sons about their new sibling yet but in the meantime, he needed them to respect his future husband. He absolutely loved Steve and prayed everyday that he wouldn't leave him.
“Yeah but has she been acting weird?” Harley’s voice lowered as if he was sharing a secret. His basis was his need to believe Anna’s sudden interest in tech was just that and nothing more. Morgan and Peter were closer with her, they’d probably know.
“Who are you?” She blurted out.
“After being pushed in a lake and strangled by the father of my child, had my child taken from me in a heartbeat by Mr. Stark. I just can’t make that up.” He confessed. “I just want my son back. That’s all I want, to see him grow and be happy and healthy.”
Tony and Steve were just enjoying getting ready for their baby – whose gender couldn’t be shown yet. Their baby was hiding that from them it seemed. Kayla had told them to come back in 2 weeks or more when they’d have a better chance of knowing. Steve was hoping for a girl and Tony wanted a boy. While their other four children were split evenly down the middle about it – Harley and Anna with their father and Morgan and Peter with their mother.
And then Steve was setting him down on the sofa. His own pants were gone and Steve got an idea. He pulled the discarded blindfold over Tony’s eyes and settled between his legs.
“I should have believed you. I should have heard what you had to say.” There was a heaping serving of regret looming over him. He could not fathom why he hadn’t considered the fact that there might be some evil a foot. Steve was already Captain America at that time. Heroes attracted villains. “Please forgive me.”
Everytime I use specific dates, it's usually becomes relevant later on...
Pepper noticed it. “You mean, you outgrew him.” Amelia didn’t respond but Pepper took her silence as all the confirmation needed. “I know you don’t need my advice. You’re an adult now and I’m not saying you should get back with Jacob but harnessing your powers, being a superhero doesn’t mean you have to abandon family, friends, people you say you love.”
“Uncle. Please talk to father. Let him see reason. Does he really want Harley Stark Rogers sitting by my side as I rule Asgard? Grandfather Odin would roll over in his grave.” Torunn cried. Her uncle had only a moment prior appeared in her room at the Stark Mansion per her request.
“Oh god,” was all Steve could manage to say.
“I just think doctors are complete assholes and full of themselves. And I vowed to never date one.” Tony explained, playing with his beard. Stephen looked a little insulted, so he buttered him up again. “But that’s changed since I’ve met you.” And he took some comfort in hearing that.
would be happier on earth.”
“Yeah.” Harley agreed, admiring the work his mother had done. It wasn’t what they’d done in the past, but he appreciated it. “I asked my mom to tone it down a bit this year.” He explained and Torunn had to ask why. She knew Harley much preferred his own parties. What changed?
“I wasn’t.” Steve responded plainly.
Tony nodded. “Yeah –” Then he cut himself off. “You’re not still seeing him after I told him to stay away from you, are you?”
“You’ve been avoiding me.” He confronted Steve, absentmindedly tidying his living room. “I woke up in the hospital and you weren’t there. You didn’t come to see me, even after I got out and we’ve barely had a proper conversation in over 3 months.”
“I know Tony but –” Steve got cut off when Tony put a finger to his lips. Tony wasn’t fond of Steve’s moral compass being in the way.
Wade couldn’t believe it either. “I’m so sorry Petey.” He apologized before they started kissing and Peter felt his erection grow inside him.
Steve didn’t deny him. He ended up setting the pace, directing the kiss but was the one to pull away first. They were only an inch apart, their foreheads touching when he spoke up. “Slow, right?” His hands, on Tony’s waist and Tony’s around his neck.
“Yes. I enjoy being single.” Pepper promised her. She was quite content without a partner.
“Okay.” She would give him the space he needed. “Just know that I am here to talk when needs be.”
I apologize for any errors
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter kept hitting Wade’s chest until his words became murmurs and eventually, sobs. His heart was aching, and it hurt too much to cry anymore. He couldn’t break free. In the same way that Peter was unable to break free from caring for and loving Wade.
She cut him off becoming irritated with his clothedness. “What? You think you’re too good for me Harley?” She jeered. He’d sleep with anyone really, so why not her?
But anyways, friends, what do u think?
Morgan shook her head. She couldn’t, however, agree with that wholeheartedly. “No. This is our baby. You get a say in this. We decide together.”
birthday was coming up. Natasha put together a small intimate family dinner like she did every year she’d been in his life because Nathan didn’t like having the attention on him. It gave him anxiety.
She responded within a minute.
The next thing he knew, Steve was working his warm hand over Tony’s hardening cock. His thumb brushed over the sensitive tip, oozing with precum. Tony moaned again and his cock was engulfed in the heat of his mouth. Steve moved up and down, wetting his cock and peering up at Tony’s aroused eyes as he did. He could feel the veins on the shaft pulsing as he pulled off only slightly before grazing his teeth on the sensitive mushroom-shaped head. He swallowed all the precum that would bead at the slit.
“Harls, you should come too.” Morgan suggested.
Tony opened his mouth to speak but the words wouldn’t come out. He was happy he had found Stephen but if he was going to blow a gasket, get angry, make a scene, get loud whenever Steve was mentioned, was it worth it? With all this jealousy, hatred towards Steve nested deep in the relationship when Tony had chosen Stephen and not Steve. It wasn’t a fresh start. He felt more hurt than happiness with that burden weighing them down.
“Almost a year.” Peter answered. “You’ve known for a year?”
“Okay.” Sam responded, pushing Bucky back into the house as they started stripping each other and Sam kicked the door shut behind him.
“What are you doing in my home?” He bit out, far more hostile than his intent.
“You’re blushing.” He noticed.
Next Chapter:
They got to the hospital quickly through one of Stephen’s portals. Harley, Morgan, Peter and Anna followed behind Steve as he held a bleeding Tony in his arms.
“I told you to stop messing with her. They’re Gods. We’re ‘mere mortals’ as Torunn likes to say.” Morgan knew Torunn meant no disrespect when she said that. It just usually came off that way. She couldn’t help it. And to be fair, she was only stating facts.
“It looks amazing Grandma.” Morgan commented.
“He doesn’t owe you shit.” Steve remarked, taking two even strides making him only a few inches away from Strange’s smug face but it didn’t make him falter.
Tony hurried with his mother to the emergency room. He hated hospitals. He had almost not shown up, but Maria had insisted. Peggy was like an Aunt to him after all. She was as much family as everyone else. They were in the middle of breakfast when Sharon Carter had called Maria’s phone and told her the terrible news. Peggy had a stroke. Peter and Morgan wanted to be there too when they heard about it but Tony wouldn’t let them. He didn’t ever want them to step foot in a hospital unless someone was giving birth. He had bad memories associated with hospitals.
“What’s up?” Tony’s voice was laced with concern. Peter was radio silent. “You’re not pregnant too, are you? It’s like everyone’s pregnant these days.”
, she had explained but Tony overlooked it because he knew this was his daughter and he wanted to hug her. As long as her skin wasn’t touching his, they’d be fine. Anna hugged both of her parents after which they all sat and discussed how and why she had ended up in foster care. It was heart-warming. They’d gotten their daughter back and Anna finally had real parents.
“Oh, that’s just rich!” Tony exclaimed. “So, how’s Sharon?” Everyone knew Steve was still sleeping with her. Sharon made sure everyone knew. Steve stayed silent so Tony used the opportunity to make his point.
Morgan scoffed. “Wow.” A pang of jealousy evident in her voice.
And Tony turned around to face him at that, taking his face into his palms capturing his lips with his own and slipping his tongue pass his lips. “You most definitely deserve some.” Tony whispered against his lips. Steve’s hands found his ass. “Right now.” He finished.
Everyone watched the scene play out as Tony had Stephen sit by him. His seat was at the head of the table; Morgan on his right and now Stephen on the left. Peter was closer to the other end of the table where Maria sat and Steve was too.
The doors to the ball room opened. The organs began playing, members of the audience rose to their feet and Harley turned in the direction of the doors as he watched Torunn and Thor journey to the altar.
“I think they’re just all still in the closet,” Michelle piped in. That made Peter laugh.
Peter stared at his mother in horror. “Mom. You’re dropping a lot of information on me right now. A lot of relevant information. 16 years into my life.” This was a lot.
To say Sam was concerned was an understatement but he wouldn’t allow himself to think that Bucky was being anything more than a friend to T’challa. He just didn’t enjoy Wakanda’s King being in his home.
While Natasha got the front door, Nathan snuck back up the stairs and into his room, but Nat had gotten a glance of him climbing the stairs and fleeing the scene. It made her mind ponder and wonder if he had seen or heard her conversation with Remy.
“I thought you’d have a different reaction.” Anna thought even if Steve was her favourite parent, she’d still feel something towards their mother. It was the same thing for her brothers. Everyone was indifferent about that topic. Anna couldn’t understand it.
“I had absolutely no energy to work on anything after last night.” He said suggestively and then she grabbed his face in both of her hands and kissed him passionately. Her memory of last night was still fresh in her mind. They were so good together in so many ways.
“Mr Stark-Rogers.” Wade greeted him, shrinking at just his very presence. Very few things scared him, and Tony Stark-Rogers had newly become one of them.
“As long as everyone else shares.” Lila decided. The other girls nodded. Torunn was a bit hesitant and she hoped none of them had noticed. She didn’t want her time with Harley to become common knowledge. She’d just continue playing the virgin.
“You can’t just abandon her Steve. She’s pregnant. With your kid.” Bucky lectured. “You were sleeping with her. It was bound to happen sooner or later.”
“We would have done the same for any of you. We always put you four first.” Tony reminded them even though they knew they collectively had a favourite.
, he thought. “I think I can be a good big sister.” She explained but Sam and Bucky stared at her for a minute and then at each other. Winter had been an only child for 10 years and she’d never asked prior to this point so Sam and Bucky had to wonder where this was coming from.
“We have to trust Peter.” Tony explained, helping Steve unfold his arms and touching the crease that was forming on his forehead so he would relax. “You know he’s a good kid. He’s probably the most sensible one out of the three.”
“Peter Stark-Rogers do you kiss your mother with that mouth.” He teased. Peter groaned, turning himself over so they could see each other.
“So Pete, catch any bad guys tonight,” Ned wondered aloud.
“Why is it always him?” Stephen groaned, flipping the covers off himself and sitting at the edge of the bed. He ran a hand over his face, frustration seething threw him more than before. They were getting married. He’d gotten Tony for himself in the end, but Steve was always brought up.
“Really?” Amelia wondered and she was having flashbacks to her childhood.
“She’s here for you.” Bruce informed her. Morgan nodded. “I’ll leave you two to it.” He kissed Nat’s cheek before exiting the room.
“So beautiful.” He remarked.
“Anna.” She had responded. Torunn raised an eyebrow.
His thrusts were slow and drawn out. He didn’t want to hurt the baby but he wanted Tony to feel everything. With each thrust he let Tony know how good he looked like this, how amazing he was for carrying their baby, how lucky he was to have him and how much love he had for him. His hand soon returned to Tony’s cock. He was close and he needed Tony to cum before him.
“Thanks baby. You know your approval always means the world to me.”
“What’s so fucking special about Tony Stark?” She blurted out. “Why do you still want him back after all these years?”
Caught up in a trance of the sight that was Torunn’s naked body, she pushed backwards so he fell on her bed. He tried to form words. “Torunn, I –”
And Steve swore he didn’t.
Morgan entered the room with Peter and Tony would not let them leave until they did a group hug. “Oh I love you guys so much. My three babies under the same roof again.” He kissed each of them on the head prior to pulling away. Getting to Harley was a little difficult, being as tall as Steve, one too many inches taller than Tony but he made it work.
“Tony, Steve and their kids are always the common denominator when it comes to drama.” Bruce pointed out. Clint and Laura nodded in agreement. Natasha was puzzled. She wasn’t expecting to hear that from Bruce. Was he still annoyed by her alleged affair with Steve that took place years before they got together?
“You feel so good Tony. And so tight.” Stephen added. They were kissing again and Tony bit down on his bottom lip when he gave a particularly hard thrust. He tasted blood. Stephen gave even harder thrusts following Tony’s attack on his lip. He felt full with how deep Stephen was going. His cock was being squeezed mercilessly between their bodies. “Damn it Stephen!” he screamed out coming between them. It took Stephen over the edge, filling Tony up to the brim and marking his insides as his.
“You can’t change the past.” Wade whispered. The wisest words Wade had ever said to him. “What’s done is done, Petey and it wasn’t your decision to make.”
“It’s just a force of habit.” Peter explained as Wade took his own seat. “My mom’s a horrible cook.”
to Stephen Strange
, they read. Harley and Torunn’s wedding, was only three weeks away and Sif was proud of the work done so far. Torunn’s dress was almost done being sewed, a cake was decided upon and the venue was already being decorated. It needed to be grand and everything had to be perfect for her daughter, for Asgard’s crown princess, for Asgard’s future Queen. Sif also found herself preparing for her son’s first birthday that was fast approaching in the coming week.
When the operation had ended and Tony hadn’t woken, no one dared to leave the hospital.
“You’re so freaking disgusting.” Amelia shrieked.
“Thank you, Princess.” And his tone lacked any form of ridicule. Before he’d say
Peter swung by on a building before landing on the roof of another. He was on a three-way call with Ned and Michelle. He was out patrolling. The city had been safe for the past few months thanks to him, or rather, Spiderman. He sat on the ledge of the building watching the busy streets of New York. “Homecoming dance is next week. Who are you taking?” Ned spoke up.
Sam pulled his hair back and kissed his bare neck. Bucky whimpered at the sensation, his eyes fluttering and his knees weakening as one hand travelled down to his harden cock. Bucky turned around, smashing his lips against his husband’s. He mumbled his name as he pulled away. “Don’t you have work?” he asked.
“Can I get you another drink? On me?” Justin insisted, glancing at Gary. That was his signal to let him know to pour Stephen another drink. Gary poured two glasses, putting one in front of each man.
Tony even told him to divorce him, one day after coming home from the emergency room. He told him to find someone else that could carry his child. He had fallen to the ground wailing, apologizing repeatedly. Steve had picked him up and held him in his arms. He let him know it wasn’t his fault. Told him how much he loved him and he let him know he was never going to leave him because he could never stop loving him. At that point, Steve was okay with the idea of never having kids of his own and he even suggested adoption. There were so many kids out there that didn’t have a family and they could give that to someone.
Steve was leaving a trail of kisses all over his body. He gave their baby a few kisses, on top of Tony's belly and asked him/her jokingly to watch their head because daddy was about to come in. Tony let out a giggle and Steve cracked a smile at his laugh. He found Tony’s legs already spread to accommodate their baby. He pressed his lips at the section below his protruding belly and wrapped a hand around Tony’s member. He was stroking it slowly while he rubbed his thumb over the tip, licking all the pre-cum that beaded on it when he got the chance. He felt Tony shiver beneath him.
Steve looked away from him, his eyes watering. He wasn’t motioning to write anything else on the white board. Bucky then called out Sam. “Sam! Please, back me up here!”
Stephen took it without making eye contact. “I hope he makes you happy.” He uttered and left.
“A son,” Sif added and Loki glanced from her to Thor to Torunn and back to Thor again gauging their reactions. Yes, Thor had out ruled the law that stated
“I do like the beard though.” Tony added. Steve took the compliment and thanked him. Tony decided to cut the crap and began the conversation he had intended to have upon arriving at his home.
Before Sif and Carol broke into an almost fight, Rhodey had been having a conversation with Jacob and Amelia. Rhodey liked Amelia for his son. She was like a Pepper 2.0 and Rhodey knew how good of a heart she had. She was strong-willed like her mother and very logical unlike the other girls he had seen Jacob with, courtesy of Harley’s influence. He saw his wife approaching Sif after she stepped outside. They were at an awkward distance away from each other but that was understandable given their past. Rhodey knew about his wife’s previous relationship with Thor and he knew she wasn’t completely over him no matter how many times she denied it. She had sulked about it (as much as freaking Captain Marvel could ever sulk) for a time before she met Rhodey. They become more than friends years later. She grew to appreciate and care for him but it was the birth of their son that really made her leave Thor in her past, that was until she saw Sif and each time the feelings came rushing back.
“I don’t think you two have formally met.” Peggy began, pulling Tony to her side. “Captain Rogers.” Steve scoffed at the formality. “This is Howard’s son, Anthony Stark.”
Stephen and Steve stayed quiet after that. “It’s like I have 5 kids instead of 3.” Tony went on. Silence flowed across the table until Maria went to the kitchen and grabbed desert.
Thor chuckled at her comment, but he knew it to be true. “I hear they have become more acceptable of the betrothal.” He pitched in. Just as Sif suspected. They’d already grown to truly care for each other.
