They were following random splatters of blood. When someone said blood trail, Tony had imagined droplets of blood conveniently forming a line directly towards the injured person, not occasional handprints of blood and some random droplets here and there.
'Ah, well, at least you're honest about it.' The fourteen-year-old was astonishingly irritating for such a young boy, and he was far too conniving for his age as well. Natasha watched him carefully. She didn't believe that he would take up arms with them if there ever was a full-out war, and she knew Thor shared the same view.
'Can't get a clear shot, too many trees,' Clint mouthed at her, and she gestured for them to go back a bit.
Tony sighed and stepped back from the launcher. 'What did you want to talk about, Steve? We kissed, yeah. It was nice, yeah. What else do you want me to say?'
The four of them set about to looking for the device, carefully avoiding the puddles of hydrazine. The black box was easy enough to locate. Tony carefully stowed it away in his backpack, deciding to check it when they were in camp, and the four of them turned their backs on the desolate scene and trudged back home.
Not only did Thor's rat of a brother continue to mock him every chance he got, he also walked around with his nose in the air, acting like he was better than the rest of him, treating them like they were beneath him. He didn't know what Thor saw in him but Clint knew he wouldn't take it too kindly if Loki was stabbed to death, which was a pity.
Fury came back on the screen, his face glitching, his voice nearly static. 'Keep calm - atmosphere - seatbelt on - space junk -' was all he said before the screen went black and the screaming intensified. 'Everybody shut up!' the blond boy shouted, but the younger kids were absolutely horrified and they
Tony sighed and sat down next to him. 'I mean, what are we going to do about us, Steve?' he clarified. Steve froze.
Bruce finally stood up. His legs were hurting but he knew he had to do something before he could get rest. He followed Loki, staying at a good distance so the boy wouldn't notice him, all the way back to camp. He was let in by the guards and Bruce jogged to catch up before they closed the gate.
Bucky had never been the same after that, though, and he'd gladly accepted the news that he was kicked off the guard and he was going to jail. Both Steve and Mrs. Barnes had been so terribly worried about him, but they couldn't change the verdict at all.
Sam gave them the thumbs-up and Steve ducked into the communications tent, wincing as he did so. Bruce and Tony followed him.
His internal debate was resolved when there was a commotion outside and they broke apart, staring into each other's wide eyes and quickly trying to get rid of their flushed appearances.
The others were stocking up on weapons, food and water. Valkyrie was contacting her girlfriend again, checking on her. The Helicarrier's systems were failing. The oxygen supply was draining faster than ever and they needed to find a way to come down to Earth before they all died.
Steve groaned in reply, gingerly patting his stomach where Rumlow had punched him. 'Yeah, we didn't think so back then, did we?' he told his best friend, crawling to the tent flap and peeking through. The sun was just rising - a phenomenon Steve would've found fascinating in a different situation - and the sky was flooded in beautiful orange, pink and red.
It was a challenge to stay out of both sight and earshot of the three. Thankfully, both Clint and Bucky knew how to walk silently, unlike Steve and Thor, who knew nothing of the word 'subtle'. He was sure Nat had heard them. She didn't miss anything. However, Bucky assured him that she already knew about backup, so he shouldn't be worried.
'Could be the killer? Yeah. I do think that. Some of us are definitely capable.' Her green eyes were blank but there was something in the tone of her voice that made Thor believe she thought of herself as a part of the ones who were capable.
what Stark's building. He came over to ask me for gunpowder and ignition. By the way, what's your relationship status? How many milestones have you crossed?'
'You'd better go speak to your brother,' she told him, as she followed Tony and James. 'He's hurt, too.'
'Loki, what are you saying?' The hatch fell back with a thud as Thor approached him, his eyes panicked and pleading.
Thor froze. He looked at Tony's panicked expression and then slowly backed away from the pink liquid.
Tony could hear the noise now. Horse hooves, footsteps, metal clanking - he heard an engine, too. His anxiety heightened and he could hear his breath coming in sharp exhales. There was blood dripping onto the ground but he couldn't care less.
Morbid, but everyone agreed that if they needed to kill some secret murderous organization to stay alive then they would do it.
Excited chatter filled the Quinjet and Tony rolled his eyes, slouching in his seat. He let his gaze wander over the other kids in the spacecraft with him. They were all clearly juvenile prisoners, with the same hunched shoulders and haunted, faraway looks in their eyes. To his shock, some of the kids looked barely twelve, while others like him were seventeen.
'Yeah, we can,' Tony had interrupted, realizing that Barnes was right. 'We can go under it but we can't break through the floor. We'd need saws and drills and it'll take a long time, not to mention Rumlow'll probably hear it. I think if we get under I can hot-wire the drop ship doors open and we can storm Rumlow.'
The not-darkness turned out to be a small underground shelter. It was quite homely, much to Tony's delight, with couches, a bed, a kitchen and a bathroom. There were signs of human habitation - plates in the shelves, broken toys on the floor, boxes full of supplies - but everything was covered with a thin layer of dust.
Tony scrambled back down the ladder as Steve pulled the hatch on and closed it tightly, sweating, his eyes panicked.
The next day, everyone was assembled in the middle of camp, eagerly waiting for Valkyrie. Steve was talking to Bucky, who was flipping a knife in his hand. Clint and Natasha were sitting nearby, both of them focused on Bruce and Valkyrie. Natasha looked uncharacteristically anxious. She kept glancing at Clint, whose expression was unreadable.
First he'd suffered through the embarrassment of everyone hearing him scream like a little girl, and now he had to deal with these stupid fucking welts all over his skin. Some of them were beginning to fade away, much to his relief, but they still hurt like hell, and he cursed whoever invented acid storms to forever walk on Legos.
'Stay here,' Bucky whispered, yanking him back into the undergrowth before he walked right into the open. They were just beside the bridge and they had a clear view of the diplomatic party - out of their sight but hopefully still in earshot. Steve, Nat and Thor walked onto the structure. Even from this distance Clint could see the tension in Steve's shoulders and the apprehension in Thor's stance. Natasha was unreadable.
No one had, much to Tony's disappointment, except for the boy sitting next to Steve, with ice-blue eyes, choppy brown hair that came till halfway down his neck and a gorgeous metal arm which Tony ached to get his hands on. He was pretty sure his father had made a metal arm once, and he wondered if it was the one the boy had.
Tony took a deep breath. 'When I was younger, my family was targeted. By terrorists, an insane serial killer, a jealous competitor - I have no idea, but I was injured. They had to find a power source to help me survive. They did, and it's called the arc reactor.'
Thor and Loki had been inseparable when they were younger - or at least, he thought so - but as they grew into teens, Loki slowly began to understand that their father, Odin, Chancellor of Asgard, didn't care about him at all. Their mother Freya had been one of the reasons Loki remained, but once she passed away prematurely due to a virus, Loki fled from Asgard and took refuge in the Helicarrier.
Natasha decided she was far too sober to be out in the open and headed for her tent. She, Valkyrie and Bruce had been working on the dummy bullets. They'd replaced the dud mixture with another one that had an explosive charge and dealt a lot of damage when fired.
Tony had been coming down when he caught Rumlow suffocating the guard with a plastic bag. He went for the dead delinquent's gun but Rumlow got there first and held it to his head, telling all the delinquents watching that he would shoot Tony if they tried to make a move for him. He then shut the drop ship doors and proceeded to declare that Tony was his hostage.
He literally couldn't think of any other girl that would willingly sit by him and hold his hand while he slept.
Tony spat out the gag. Whoever put it in had done a terrible job. He was about to try and get rid of his bonds as well when the door opened and someone walked in.
He backed away on his hands and knees. The forest around him was swirling in shades of yellow, pink and blue. He could see images of people flashing by him, too fast for him to make out. He could see bright colored animals, too, prancing around the spinning world.
She nodded. 'Who we are and who we need to be to survive are two very different things, Banner,' she said softly.
Bucky and Natasha burst in through the front door, both of them disheveled and dirty with uncharacteristically panicked faces. Natasha leaned against the wall and Bucky dropped to the floor, both of them trying to catch their breath. Bucky's jacket pocket and Natasha's pants' back pocket were both bulging.
Steve exhaled softly, trying not to think about that too much. Tony was a bad influence. From start to end, he'd been nothing but trouble for Steve. Now if Steve could just accept that fact and be done with it, his life would be a lot more simple.
Rumlow didn’t look anything like the boy who had punched him in the face a year and a half ago. HYDRA’s torture had brutally scarred his face and body, and he didn’t even look human anymore. He looked like the man with the red skull Steve had seen on the bridge.
'Wow, thanks, Buck, I never thought of that,' Steve said sarcastically, 'now I just need the courage to do it. Do you have any spare? Oh, wait, you're the guy who kissed Natasha Romanoff once and then spent the next few days staying as far away from her as humanly possible.'
'Even if he or she did, the radio will be full of water. It'll take half a day just to dry it out and another day or so to fix it,' Bruce commented.
He ducked and rolled, trying not to get shot and nearly shitting himself in fear, but he was internally grinning. Friends. He had friends, people who joked with him, not about him, and teased him with no malice and didn't beat him for getting teased back, people who cared.
It was beautiful. The flares shot up into the sky, blazing trails of red, strongly burning their way high up into the ink-black darkness.
'Darling, I'm the definition of evil,' he teased back, and she rolled her eyes, but her cheeks were pink.
'Your father's right, Tony,' a soft voice said, and one of the faceless people behind Howard stepped forward, revealing the blonde hair and sad eyes of Maria Stark.
'Yeah. And now we have a chance to start over, don't we? Kind of like it's nature telling us we messed up, but we could have a go at it again and do things right this time,' Bucky mused.
'Mount Weather may have supplies that could be useful to us - like armor, gear, more weapons, that sorta thing. They didn't really explore it. I guess they thought they didn't need all that stuff. Anyways, Loki found a tunnel in one of HYDRA's little outposts and it leads directly into the heart of Mount Weather. It took him a day of walking to get there, though, and he's perfectly fine and jogged most of the way.'
He looked around at the delinquents. Those who had parents were either sobbing, staring into nothingness with empty eyes or taking out their rage on anything they could see.
Steve shuffled to his right so Tony could work on whatever he'd been doing wrong. He found himself gazing at the other boy's wicked dark eyes, long eyelashes, tousled hair and lean frame. Tony wasn't thin or soft by any means. He looked slim and short in stature but he had ripcord muscles from all the engineering stuff, probably.
A girl with wavy brown hair and a crooked grin was standing there, holding out an open tin. 'They're giving the cans you brought back from the bunker you found, and I don't think I can finish this on my own, so you wanna share?' she questioned.
'No violence yet. At least for Thor's sake,' she told him, glancing at Thor, who hadn't spoken a word since they'd captured Loki.
'Still,' Tony butted in, narrowing his eyes at Loki. 'It wouldn't be fair if he got off without any punishment at all. You know what I say? I think he should go back to HYDRA. As a double agent. Feed 'em false information, get all the good stuff for us. You know?'
Behind him were two other HYDRA agents. They were wearing headgear and face guards, so Natasha could only see their eyes. She felt the effects of the whiskey she drank kicking in, but it was just one glass. She could handle a lot more. She wasn't worried. James and Natasha stopped
Thor looked around at his friends. Steve was frowning, lost in thought. T'Challa looked calm and collected. Tony was trying to maintain his cool demeanor but he looked concerned. Bucky was furrowing his eyebrows as well and Natasha was as unreadable and stoic as always. Bruce, Wanda and the others were all wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
Tony clutched his metal seatbelt, panicking, as everyone began to either scream or cheer in joy. For a few heart-stopping minutes they were free-falling through space, and then suddenly all was calm.
'Hey, hey, calm down, okay? What's going on?' Steve said authoritatively, pushing through the crowd.
'You're not, because you're going to collapse any moment. Both of you literally haven't eaten or drank anything for the past twenty hours. There is no way you're staying here.'
Kids walked in and out, ignoring him as he poked and prodded around. The bottom floor of the drop ship was just the ripped-up seats and the fried television screen. He couldn't find anything else of much importance. He had decided that he'd better go and see if Tony had any more luck when a familiar brown-haired girl walked in.
'I don't think we're going to survive more than a few nights,' she remarked, hoping her statement was morbid enough to distract him. It was. 'Why would you say that?' he asked curiously, 'We seem to be doing pretty well. At least they didn't send us down without supplies. We've got three boxes of knives and preserved food and tarp and other stuff. We could make it.'
'You shouldn't get so angry at him, Tony, he wants the best for you. He's giving you criticism so you can improve. You should take his advice.'
'Nooo,' Bucky groaned, stumbling out of the tent and slumping onto a very aggravated Clint. 'Get off me, you boneless abomination,' he hissed, pushing Bucky off him and onto Steve.
'Fuck,' Tony swore. 'It must've been the trick I did with the radio. It was using the wristbands for power as well, and when it failed, it must've fried the wristbands as well.'
- I know he killed my brother but no one deserves to die like this -' Wanda was pleading, but no one paid any attention to her.
They had also contacted the Helicarrier, although help from space was very unlikely. Carol Danvers was their go-to for communication. Nick Fury was almost always busy and Maria Hill would only talk to them if it was something important or something concerning politics, so the blonde girl would dutifully stay in the communications room and took almost all their calls.
The unfamiliar face of a Council member was displayed on the screen. She arched an eyebrow at them. 'Who're you and where's Luis? He was supposed to meet his mother.'
Every moment he dwelled on his situation was a moment lost, maybe the last moment for Steve. He had to keep working, keep moving, or else he would sink into a dark place he hoped he would never see after his father publicly disowned him.
Clint was only alive for this long because his wound had been treated by whatever had taken him. The spear had been removed and the injury had been cauterized and patched up with some sort of poultice that none of them recognized. He had been unconscious the entire time.
He'd apparently turned into a massive green monster, almost eight feet tall, and had wrecked the lab, injuring and knocking out Betty in the process. It had almost been a disaster for the Helicarrier but the guards with the stun guns had managed to overpower the green guy and he'd turned back into himself. The last thing he remembered seeing was Betty's scared face and then everything was blurry as the monster took control.
'Yeah. If they get rid of their wristbands, then they're confirming the fact that thousands of people won't get to experience the life they missed out on. They're condemning innocent children to years aboard that giant steel trap,' Tony interjected, having caught on to the last bit of their conversation.
Clint sighed and decided to stop thinking about the twins before his high spirits crashed and burned. Instead he focused on the scenery around them. Everyone looked utterly awed. The trees were absolutely massive and the flora and fauna was like nothing in their history textbooks. He bent down to pluck a beautiful five-petaled blue flower and turned it around in his hands, blown away by the fact that something so delicate and so perfectly designed had simply sprung from a seed.
He'd been in position, hadn't moved an inch - just like Romanoff had told him - and he was watching Clint make his move when Romanoff shouted Clint's name.
'Nice. I suppose. Not much difference from the weird whatever you and Darcy have going on. We're just official. You're... in between. Getting there.'
Wade already had a gun aimed at his head and so did Bucky, but Peter intervened. 'Guys, wait, don't kill him yet, he might have information! Look, he's bleeding, the Grounders must've got him!' Everyone looked at Peter, and then looked at Steve.
Clint's words were nonchalant but his description of Loki sent a pang through Thor's heart. His brother had taken the extra effort to carry back a heavy metal hammer so Thor could be happy. He hadn't thought of it that way. Maybe there was hope for Loki after all.
But he was dying. The wound was fatal, and if he didn't get the proper medicine soon then there was no hope for him.
'Yeah, right. You don't have to hide everything, Natasha. Sometimes it's better to just let it all out.'
The steps led down into a room which Steve could only describe as depressing. It was filthy, dark and wet. The room had several entrances to hallways and other rooms which all looked equally as unpleasant as the first one.
She was the exact opposite - sitting stiff and straight, her legs folded under her, Indian-style, both hands in her lap.
'Some taken,' she told him, but she wasn't hurt. She'd already known that and thought a lot worse about herself. 'My name's Natasha,' she added, and his face lit up. 'Natasha...' he prompted, and she groaned. 'Natasha Romanoff,' she snapped, and he grinned wider. 'Now we're making progress. Not bad, Natasha.'
He saw a gorgeous redhead, a blond boy with a cheeky grin and hair sticking up everywhere, a fifteen year old girl with long brown hair, a quiet-looking dark haired boy with glasses, and a heck ton of others who he'd never seen before, before he found Rhodey and Pepper. Pepper was just a few seats away but Rhodey was nearly on the other side of the craft.
Bruce watched and wondered where exactly they'd gone so wrong that they had been hit in a vulnerable place, their own camp, their home - and they had been hit hard.
How long had it been since Steve went in? Two minutes? Ten? Twenty? He had no idea. All he knew was that the love of his life had just sacrificed himself for Tony's sake, and Tony needed to get him back before he was murdered by Rumlow.
Since they weren't eighteen, SHIELD couldn't put them on the death row, which was standard punishment on the Helicarrier. The surviving humans couldn't risk any mistakes, any rebels, any change in their perfect system, or else they all would die.
'Okay, Rogers, nice play. Glad to see you don't trip over your own feet anymore. Move aside, you're doing that wrong.'
'Stevie, get the fuck away now,' Bucky got out, but he was too late. Steve was retching up blood as well.
Thankfully Tony didn't catch him staring. He was engrossed in assembling the launcher, the smug smirk gone, replaced by a look of intense concentration. His face was quite pretty when he wasn't wearing his arrogant mask. It showed a softness, a kind of openness that he'd never seen before, and Steve couldn't take his eyes off him.
Natasha wanted to stay and watch, but she knew that if she were to go out and look for the ingredients of the poultice she would have to conserve her energy. Also, the wave of relief that washed over her was so strong she felt herself tearing up and immediately looked away. When James tapped her on the shoulder she followed him with no arguments at all.
'Uh, yeah, that was Darcy for you,' Jane got out, her cheeks still pink, and before Thor could say anything else she told him, 'See you later, then!' and hurried after Darcy. Thor shrugged and continued on his way. Females did mystifying things sometimes, and Thor didn't fret or get himself worked up for not understanding them. He liked to remain blissfully ignorant. It was soothing.
Tony stared at him with wide open eyes as Steve collapsed to the ground. The angle at which Loki was standing - he would have hit Tony in the back, directly in the chest, ruined the arc reactor - and Tony would've been dead in minutes.
Steve nodded, pulling out his water bottle and taking a swig. 'So we'll watch from that direction. What else?'
They spent around half an hour wandering about the river, diving occasionally when the water got to deep and surfacing with no results.
Maybe it was the fact that her recent emotional breakdown over Clint had opened up old wounds and reminded her of her sister. Maybe it was the fact that she'd started killing long before Loki and something about him reminded her of herself - a broken, haunted child.
'Who's going first, then?' he asked into the silence. Steve, obviously, began to climb down. As if he hadn't been any more noble and self-sacrificing already. 'If you die I got dibs on that spear, Rogers!' Barton yelled after him, to which Steve replied with a classic 'fuck off', much to Tony's delight,
At the beginning, they'd explored the bunker in silence. It really wasn't anything remarkable - an almost exact copy of the first one, except a bit smaller and without as many supplies. This had no sign of a child living there. It didn't have the homely feel, either - the couches were gone, and the bed was nothing but a pile of sleeping bags.
'Steve!' he tried to call, but his voice came out slurred and hysterical, distorting the word until it sounded like 'Shteeeeeee'.
Bruce's gaze wandered to Rumlow's bloody hands. The fingernails of both had been ripped off completely. There were also burn scars across Rumlow's face and arms. He looked away, feeling nauseous.
'James, we both know that's really not why you're here. You talked to me literally ten minutes ago.'
He was working too fast. He accidentally sparked a few wires together and they made a sizzling noise, startling him and making him fall back onto the floor with a clang.
Thor remembered Darcy's words about the kids in his scouting party and he passed on this valuable information to Clint, whose eyebrows shot up and began to actually giggle. Thor then spent the next ten minutes listening to Barton waxing poetic about how handsome he was, and then the next fifteen minutes on how young love lasted forever.
'Hey, don't beat yourself up, man. Sometimes we can't help who we're related to, or who we love. We just gotta deal with it but we shouldn't give ourselves a hard time, either. Because once in a while, holding on hurts more than letting go,' Clint said easily, and Thor turned to look at him. 'Sometimes you say deep, meaningful things like that and the other times you trip over your own feet. Choose a side, Barton,' he said firmly, and Clint laughed.
Tony crawled out of the bottom level of the drop ship and went around the side to where the doors were. There was a lot of shouting. He picked out Steve's as the loudest. He shoved through the crowd that was around the doors and managed to stumble inside.
'Shut up, Barnes,' Tony told him, but as much of a jerk he was, Bucky was also right. They were being fired at and they needed to get moving or they would die in the forest with blood pouring from their nostrils and gunshot wounds, surrounded by mutant squirrels and hallucination nuts.
new chapter! :) first off, i want to start by saying i have close to zero knowledge about treating wounds and all that medical stuff. if i get something horribly wrong then please tell me and definitely do not try this shit in real life, kids, because you'll most likely die.
That was why every single time he was out in the wilderness, he kept an eye out to see if he could find his brother. Especially now that they knew there was a gang of human beings out there who wanted to chase them off the planet. He tried not to think about the possibility that Loki had already been kidnapped by them. He was morose enough as it was.
He took one of the shovels himself and began to plow away at the dirt, clearing out a section large enough for them to go underneath the ship. He knew that there was a small bottom level in the drop ship, beneath the seats, where all the wiring and the battery and the other technical stuff which couldn't be included in the walls or control room were located.
Steve took off after her, and so did the others. Loki's head shot up and he watched them go past him with an almost fearful look in his eyes, but Thor blinked and his brother's face had slipped back into its usual uncaring mask. He was about to go to Loki when Wanda's angry shout from across the camp distracted him.
'What are you on about?' Bucky began, but then caught sight of the drop ship hurtling through the sky.
'I want to go back,' Loki said suddenly. They all turned to him. 'I'm willing. I'll be your double agent.'
It grew dark very soon. The delinquents were sitting around the massive bonfire they had lit, eating stale bread and leftover waterfowl. Thor had finished his portion a long time back.
'You gotta stop moping over Stark and do something about it, you know,' Bucky said matter-of-factly, taking back the bottle. Steve nearly choked.
Bruce looked back at the bloody carnage outside of the drop ship. The clever ones had made a run for the lookout posts and were sitting up there, far from the sick delinquents. T'Challa was ordering everyone to stay in camp and to not go to the bunker because they didn't know if the Grounders were lying in wait or not.
'I'm trying to help you! Killing someone isn't the answer to everything, Wade!' Peter said, panicked.
Steve took a deep breath. 'Loki - and Rumlow, Sitwell and Rollins - leave the camp. Leave right now and if you come back, I swear I'll let them finish what they started.'
Natasha wasn't smiling, though. Her posture was rigid and she was standing a bit away from them. 'There's something wrong with it,' she said, her mouth in a thin line. Everyone moved to her side and tried to find the squirrel again.
He was awestruck every single time he learned about someone new, and every single time he learned something new about someone he already knew, and it made his day to just listen to people talk, watch the little things they did, like tuck their hair behind their ear or adjust their glasses. He loved watching them think, plan and create. Hell, he loved accomplishing something himself and then getting that realization after - like, wow, I just did that, that's awesome.
'And - uh, one year ago, I came out to him. I told him I was gay. I don't know why I did it. I guess I thought he wouldn't mind. Well, he did. A lot. He beat me up, screamed at me, threw me out of the cabin. The next day I built a robot and programmed it to sabotage the meeting with his latest client. It was an important meeting. They were discussing about the launch of a new project before I ruined it.'
Natasha was already halfway to the door. She took one last glance at the seaweed and then nodded. 'Yeah. I'll go and get it.'
'I'm not staying here any longer, I don't want to die,' Loki muttered, turned on his heel, and stalked away.
After that whole fiasco he never spoke to Tony. Sure, he'd saved his life, but was that really feelings which went deeper than his usual automatic reflex to push someone out of the way of a knife? And then he'd heard that Tony was scared shitless when he was poisoned, but again - was that really what he thought it was?
'Loki, there's people who still care about you,' Thor told him intensely. 'I do. I do, Loki. I love you too, brother.'
She walked out of the drop ship, where Tony and James were pacing back and forth like caged tigers. Thor was sitting with his back against the side of the drop ship, his eyes closed.
He'd then ran the fastest he'd ever run in his entire life, passing even Thor and collapsing in camp a few meters in front of the storm. He'd alerted everyone to get into the drop ship before they all died and somehow they made it into the ship without mishap. However, three delinquents had gone out to the woods and they hadn't made it back yet, which gnawed away at Clint.
But Tony was still infuriating and Steve couldn't understand him and he really would like to know what their relationship was. The only problem was - Tony wouldn't even talk to him.
'They were expecting you guys. I'm sure there's an infiltrator in your Council. I've never seen their leader, he must be in space. They want to get rid of you. They were scaring you off at first, but then you got too meddlesome, and now they're planning an attack on you.'
'Well, then, James -' she pronounced it slowly, testing out the way it felt on her tongue, '- you can call me Natalia. That's my real name. How's that for being more open, or whatever the shit you're talking about?'
Clint yawned, stretched and then winced as the wound throbbed painfully. He needed coffee. He would actually kill for a good cup of hot, steaming coffee right about then. Sadly, they were on Earth, and he needed to make do with water. He reached for his clothes, ignoring the massive headache that was building slowly behind his temples, and got dressed.
'You two eye-fuck each other all the time, it's sickening. Anyone with half a brain knows you're hopelessly in love,' she stated matter-of-factly, giving him a sly smile. 'Maybe try less ogling and more being involved in conversations?'
'I just wanted to say that if we continue like this then more of the fucked-up stuff like what happened today will repeat itself, and we're going nowhere by being insane unpredictable chimpanzees. We need a leader, or, y'know, someone who can make the decisions and we can vote - like a democracy - so we don't go crazy. Y'all agree?'
He arched an eyebrow. 'Is it so bad to want to talk to a fellow delinquent?' She shrugged. 'Depends on the delinquent.' He grinned at her and held up his own knife. 'Mind if I join you?' She did mind, but before she could say anything he moved closer and sat on a rock just a foot away.
Steve heard violent protesting from inside the drop ship in Tony’s muffled tones, and then he heard a thud and all was silent. He heard someone punching buttons and then slowly the drop ship door ground open. Everyone tensed and Steve held out his arm to push back the other delinquents.
hard!'. She handed Steve a crudely-fashioned spear made with a long, relatively sturdy branch and sharpened metal from the drop ship, and threw him a wink and a quick gesture to Tony's direction, to which he sighed, accepting the fact that he was going to forever have pink cheeks.
Howard and Maria faded into the background as more people stepped out. Obadiah Stane, Justin Hammer, Ivan Vanko, Harley Keener - hell, even Edwin Jarvis - spoke to him in aloof, hostile voices, telling him he was a mistake, he should've never been born, he could do nothing right, wearing stony expressions and seeming distant.
'A lot of things. I asked him to come into camp but he wouldn't. Makes sense, I guess. Anyways, he says he found a way for us to get to Mount Weather without detection. He says that this attack will be the first of many and that HYDRA wants us wiped off the face of Earth. They haven't cleared out Mount Weather, though.'
She smiled again, watching him squirm. All of that had been a mixture of guesswork and her own training, as she'd been observing Steve's symptoms and then pulled the answer out of her ass.
He'd gotten a chance to meet them once, because even though he was in jail, the son of Howard Stark got special privileges. He'd yelled at them and then broke down, and they'd comforted him and firmly stood by their decision, telling him that he was the reason they'd had such comfortable, happy lives until then and they would stand by him forever.
Tony tried really hard not to think of Clint bleeding out from his wounds. That spear had gone right through him. He wasn't a doctor of any kind and never claimed to be, but even he was pretty sure that was almost fatal.
'Yeah, well, it's in my blood, you know. It's calling me. Why're you bothering yourself with the likes of me, anyway? No guns for you to play with?' Clint asked her.
Sure enough, there she was, with her cheeky smile, dancing eyes and wavy brown hair, gaze focused on his face, her fingers entwined with his. Behind her was Bruce, sleeping against the wall, with another girl Clint couldn't quite place - Betty Ross, he remembered.
The hill wasn't big but it was still tall enough to be able to tower over the trees on the ground. In the distance was a massive mountain, its peak touching the sky, and even from so far away Clint could see signs of man's work - steel structures, supporting beams and even a flag. It was beautiful in a rugged, harsh way, and was definitely Mount Weather, seeing as it was the only mountain they could see for miles.
Natasha gave the antidote to Bruce, who quickly tipped some into another cup just in case they needed to make more, and administered the rest to Steve. Everyone stood by, watching anxiously. Clint was there, and so were Sam, Scott, Wanda, and a blond girl Natasha knew as Sharon Carter.
Tony lifted his head off the ground, trying to gauge where he was. The cave was quite small. Was it even a cave? It looked more like an underground room - with dirt for the walls and floor. There was nothing in it except for, well, him. He saw a door - wonder of wonders - but he would bet his sunglasses that it was locked.
'We know who they are but we believe they're in cahoots with someone important in the Helicarrier. Someone on the Council,' Steve explained.
whoever gave me the ability to write dialogue - take it away. take it away right now because i'm shit at it and don't deserve to have it.
'Yes, but there's complications,' butted in Tony. 'Is this wire tapped? Or broadcast? Or can anyone else listen in?'
'It's right there,' she mouthed, pointing at the tall bushes. Very delicately, she pushed aside a bush to get a better view.
Everyone scrambled to their feet and went over to the open hatch, climbing down to the first floor, which was already almost empty. Clint poked Darcy. 'Race you to the end of camp,' he challenged, and then immediately took off.
Bruce had just begun to explain the whole idea of radioing the Helicarrier when Tony called out to him. 'Hey, Brucie-bear! Come up here, will you?' Bruce looked at Betty and she nodded. They both made their way up the ladder and through the hatch onto the second floor of the drop ship.
'What's happening?' Tony asked, confused. 'Storm. A huge fucking storm. Like, miles and miles of just orange. It's not dust, it's not sand, I have no idea what it is, but it's dangerous and it hurts. I think it's an acid storm,' Steve got out, rubbing furiously at his arms and neck, where red welts had already appeared.
Thor found himself doubting his life choices every moment he spent around the other juvenile delinquents.
She usually wouldn't give a shit if someone's little brother was important to them - she was an assassin, after all - but something stirred in her when she saw Thor's downcast face.
'Rogers, my old friend,' he said mockingly, raising the firearm and pointing it at Steve's forehead.
He poked around the ruins. There really wasn't much to it. It was wrecked. Steve crouched by what looked like the remains of someone's trophy. The gold-colored plastic was blackened and burned. He ran his fingers over the faded letters on it. Someone had earned this and was proud of it over a century ago. What had happened to them?
'What? Why? I thought you liked him. I know you like him, even though he's a jackass, but no accounting for your taste, because you like wearing flannel and that is disgusting -'
He had been minding his own business, talking to Jane and Darcy while they sorted out the remaining supplies from the aid depot, when his brother, Clint, Natasha, Bucky, Tony and Steve ran into the camp. Tony and Clint were whooping, Steve and Bucky were grinning like idiots, Loki was as condescending as always and even Natasha was smiling.
Those two words. That was all it took for the fragile walls Tony had built to come crashing down and he snapped under the pressure. He wasn't outright crying, but tears were sliding down his face silently and he couldn't form coherent words.
'You have mastered the art of conjuring light!' Thor exclaimed excitedly. 'Either that, or they've set it on fire,' Bruce told him, and Thor deflated. 'Don't be so morbid. We found the light switch,' Steve explained. 'Ugh, that's boring,' Clint complained. 'For once I find myself agreeing with one of your ridiculous notions, Barton,' Thor commented, and Romanoff smirked.
'Yeah, well, there you go. I'm not saying trust everyone and start telling people your life story as soon as you meet them - I'm just saying that there are people who actually care about you, and it's not bad to care about them as well.'
Tony must've sensed that Steve was thinking about him because he looked directly at Steve, and when Steve met his gaze he held it for a few moments before glancing back down at his shoes.
'You look cheerful today,' she commented, and he shrugged. 'There is not much to be joyful about, Jane,' he replied forlornly, and she sat next to him.
Thor scanned the other delinquents. They were all fucked-up. He knew that, they knew that - it was indisputable. But who was fucked-up enough to kill somebody... with no exterior motive? Most of the kids in the camp were there for theft, or petty brawls. He didn't think any of them were in jail for murder, but then again, he was no one to decide.
'It's fine, I'm just not used to it, I guess. So, anyways, my father thought the arc reactor made me weak. It just made him dislike me more. When I got older it got worse. He used me as his own punching bag. I still have bruises from like, three years ago, I think.'
'Thanks, Buck,' Steve said sincerely, but then as an afterthought he added, 'Don't break his nose, though.'
Steve, Bucky and Tony hung back, allowing Clint and Natasha to scout ahead and look for animal tracks. He remembered an incident when Clint had actually found panther tracks and they'd immediately changed direction, heading the opposite way as fast as they could.
The only two guns in the camp were usually handled by Natasha and Bucky, the people who found them. Natasha's Glock was always on her person and she refused to let anyone else use it. There would always be one gun in the camp and if anyone was going out they would take the other one - Bucky's Smith and Wesson 629. The guns were, however, rarely used, because their ammunition supplies were very low.
Bruce had immediately fallen into a crouch and ducked behind the tall foliage, hoping the fronds of the bush were wide enough to obscure him. He was facing the direction the noise had come from and he had slipped a knife from his boot, prepared to defend himself if necessary, and he had tried to catch sight of whatever made the noise.
"Always a way out," he said. "You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero."
"No," she murmured. "It is what it is. At least I can get the police to help me if he comes near me now."
. That said something to Steve; absolutely avoid getting committed to an asylum at all costs. So, he did everything he could to protect the fact that he was bisexual. He didn't tell anyone, not even his best friend Bucky. The only person who he ever willingly revealed it to was Peggy, and that was only because had been in love with her and trusted her implicitly. (Which for the most part his trust was well-placed. The only person she had told was Tony, and that was long after he'd been frozen in the ice, and he'd come to accept her reasoning behind that betrayal.) Other than that, no one knew. It was safer that way.
"I've got a ride," she said as she dropped her weapon to the ground. "I could use a boost though." Catching sight of the approaching legion Steve understood what it was she was going to do and backed up a few feet until he was standing in front of the bridge's barrier wall and Natasha did the same standing opposite him.
"Steve and Tony probably took the limo," Bruce said. "Lara and I took a cab to the station and back."
"You threw him out?" He turned to look at the concierge, who for the first time had something other than utter contempt on his face; fear and guilt.
"We're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents," Natasha said. "You've seen our badges. We can make it happen." The concierge looked both ways, as if he expected a car to come out of nowhere and hit him.
"No!" The word came flying out of Tony's mouth faster than he could think it. "Of course, I care about you, Steve. I care about you more than I care about myself."
"It's dead," Tony confirmed. Clint let out a whoop of elation and relief. As it died down, Natasha could be heard laughing.
"Whatever," she said. "Let's just cut to the chase. I have a cover to maintain and I'd rather not have it blown because my boss doesn't know how to micromanage his time."
"Agent Romanoff," she said. "I'm just here to take Agent Barton's vitals. I don't mean any harm to you, him, or anyone else."
"Freeman got in front of the press and tried to defame you and the other Avengers," she said. "I got him offstage before he could do anything irreparable, but I think it's safe to say we still took a hit."
"I think there's a snake infestation in the garden." Hill covertly glanced around to see if anyone overheard that. Luckily, all the agents within her field of vision seemed to have been too busy preforming their assigned duties to take notice of their conversation.
"You can send them in," he said. "As long as you don't mind escorting Sister Margot to the backstage area?"
"That she hasn't gotten around to it yet." With everything that had been going on at the time, it was plausible. However, the tone of Pepper's voice made it clear that she believed otherwise.
Looking around the holographic screen to see Steve's sleeping form, Tony couldn't help but smile. Although it probably wasn't comfortable to sleep sitting up the way Steve was, his face was peaceful as he took shallow breath after shallow breath. Whatever doubts or worries he had about bringing Steve back to Los Angeles with him instantly vanished. He was with him and that was all that mattered, at least for right now.
As stated before, Barton was intubated and couldn't communicate. Well, technically he could through ASL, but Tony didn't know ASL and even if he did, he couldn't see Barton thanks to the dark gray vinyl divider that separated them. Tony could pull the sheet back if he wanted to, but then he'd run the risk of being exposed. Normally, he wouldn't care about the risk and run in there to tell Barton right away, but ultimately Tony wasn't sure if that was what Barton wanted. He had said himself that if he was dying, he wouldn't want to know. On the one hand, Tony wanted to respect Barton's wishes. On the other hand, this just plain felt wrong and he wanted to do something about it.
"No," a female voice from beside Tony responded. He turned and saw the woman with no identifying clothing. "He just thinks he is. Agent Jenifer Duran, Department of Homeland Security."
"Yeah," he said. "The cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides."
"See you downstairs," she said as Bruce gave a quick wave and walked off down the hall. Clint started to follow him but stopped and turned back before he even reached the door.
"That's different," Hill said. "You're an agent, Stark's a consultant. He's not under our direct employment, so therefore we can't offer him the same services. Besides, Stark has the means to seek out mental health help if he truly needs it. It's not like he's helpless."
As soon as he got off work at five, Rhodey raced right over to the hospital. The crowd of reporters were still there, but so were hospital security and the police, so they were standing just clear enough for patients to be able to safely enter and leave the hospital. Rhodey parked closer to the building this time, hoping to limit the length of his walk past the paparazzi. It worked to keep his head cool to some extent, but he had to bite his tongue to keep from snapping back at a particularly pushy reporter who managed to clearly shout a question about Tony's HIV status over the din of the crowd. That was hard to walk away from.
Steve stepped into the meeting room to see Tony sitting at the circular table, his chin resting on his hands and chin resting on his hands and eyes resting on some point thousands of miles away; clearly lost in thought. Natasha and Bruce went to go get Clint and Lara offered to take Lucky out for a walk so that way no one would be left waiting. This left the two of them alone for a moment, which in all honesty, they both needed.
"Noted," Conroy said dutifully. "Also, like I said before, you look like literal death. I'm not joking. You seriously look like you're going to keel over and die right here, right now."
"Yes, of course." Rhodey waited a beat for JARVIS to elaborate further but he was not so fortunate to have the young AI understand that that he wanted more information than just that.
"Oh!" Bruce stopped and turned to look at Betty. "Can you see if we can get a whiteboard in here? I think we're going to need it." Bruce gave her a smile.
"You think he might have left on his own?" Clint questioned. Natasha was quiet, thinking over her response before answering.
Steve didn't see him, though. In fact, he had his back to Tony while he held open the giant glass door. Steve had his gaze on Commander Hill who was climbing who was climbing out of a black SUV that was pulled up to the curb. The back door of the SUV was still open wide, likely for a third person who was taking their sweet time getting out of the car. Steve and Hill were talking back and forth and neither had even glanced in the direction of the windows. So, they didn't know that Tony was standing there.
"You sure that's a good idea?" Natasha asked. "I mean, you open something to the public and the public usually finds a way to mess it up."
"I just noticed in his personal history that there's an entire line of text that's been redacted," Steve said. "I was wondering why that was."
"Take us back to the house," he ordered the driver. "It looks like I'm going to be taking the morning off."
"Well, I mean yes," Adoniram said. "We failed in our main objective in turning the media against the Avengers, but we sowed enough seeds of distrust in there for us to work with. Particularly with that disappearing act, Stark did on Monday."
After Natasha mouthed to Steve, "he's not going to arrest you," Steve seemed to relax, at least a little bit. Tony still wanted to get up and reassure him, though. Oh, how he hated what he had done to himself, but he knew it was nothing compared to what he had done to Steve.
"Miss Conroy," the AI said while automatically lowering the volume of the television. "I'd hate to interrupt, but an agent from S.H.I.E.L.D. is trying to gain access to Mr. Stark's private elevator." Lara's brow furrowed.
"Good." Steve rubbed his thumb across the back of Tony's hand. "So… I guess we should talk about this, huh?"
"How so?" Lara flipped her phone around and held it out as far as she could for Tony to see. The screen was on the website of the hotel they were going to be staying at.
"I'm already in this. Might as well see it through to the end." She patted Jessica's shoulder. "Call Fury. I'll keep an eye on Stark."
Right, he had to keep his eyes on the prize. Whatever this newfound tension he had with Steve was, he could focus on it later. Find the Tesseract, stop S.H.I.E.L.D. from doing whatever stupid thing they were doing now, then he could focus on his screwed up emotional state.
"Fine," Lara said, putting a hand to her chest and bending over slightly. "Just more out of shape than I thought I was…"
"Nothing!" Lara exchanged a glance with Steve. With a few subtle gestures she communicated what she wanted him to do, but Clint caught on easily. He was the king of subtle gestures, after all. He backed up against the door and gripped onto the knob tightly. "Oh, no," he said. "You can't get past me, I'll…"
"No," the second person from legal spoke up. He was a younger man with freckles covering most of his face. "What's insane is that you're all acting like we can do something about this when we're corporate attorneys." The entire room fell silent. DeMarcus shot the younger attorney a sharp look. "What? I'm just saying what needed to be said." DeMarcus sighed.
It felt like forever before the shaking stopped and even when it did, Lara refused to get up. It took a particularly nasty swipe from the cat to finally get her to let go and even then, she just let Telemachus slide out from underneath her. She didn't move for another few minutes, waiting for the aftershock to come and finish her off.
. While Tony certainly could afford to pay for all six rooms for the rest of their natural-born lives, it wasn't exactly the best position to be in, especially considering they would have to pay for any damages the rooms took while they were there. If Tony got sick on the floor, he would have to pay for that. Again, it wasn't like he couldn't afford it – he could – but it was still a pain, especially when he could go to one of his own houses or apartments and not have to worry about paying for something of someone else's he ruined. (On that note, he was kicking himself for not investing in a place in D.C. Granted, before plans scrapped there was going to be another Stark Tower built in D.C. and if that had gone through he would have another apartment, but the Chitauri invasion happened, so it didn't. Story of his life.)
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Please comment/review and do all the stuff you're supposed to do from the respective site you're on!
"Allow me to introduce you to your successor," he said. "Romanoff, this is my assistant, Lara Conroy. Conroy, meet Natalie Rushman." Natasha rolled her eyes and extended a hand out to Conroy.
As soon as he saw the number, Steve was confused. It was way too long and didn't have any letters in it. There was no way it could be valid. He had only used a phone a handful of times in his life, but he at least knew that much. It also didn't help that he hadn't seen a single phone since Tony left the other day. So, even if it was a valid number, he wouldn't be able to call Tony and let him know he was alright.
"Excellent point," she said. "Yes, it's about Steve Rogers, but you can't tell anyone this ever. I was never going to tell anyone this; Steve asked me not to, but given the circumstances… Can you promise that you'll never tell anyone?"
For hours Knežević waited for Audrey and Stephanie to come home. In that time, he broke into Lorraine's house by throwing a rock through a window, made himself a mac and cheese TV dinner without any of it turning to stone (though, there were some close calls), and breaking the remote by using his whole hand to pick it up accidentally. As annoyed as he was, he tried to make himself accept that this was something he had to get used to. He didn't know how this happened (but he'd put a wager on the explosion having something to do with it) so he no way to fix it. This was life now. He had to get used to it.
"When we were getting off the Quinjet," Natasha shrugged. "You were two busy gaping at the sky-whales to notice."
"Okay," At this point, Steve was fighting to keep his eyes open. Not only did he need to get answers, but he was also afraid that if he closed them, he wouldn't be able to open them again. "Can you tell me what's happening now?"
In a way, that felt sort of hypocritical. Natasha tried to tell him that so many times, but he wouldn't listen to her, choosing to dread the reality instead. Look how well that worked out for him! In all, he just hoped his cynical outlook wasn't the last memory he'd leave her with.
"I took care of it," Fury assured right off the bat. "The hospital's releasing you into our custody and will remove you from their records. It'll be like you were never here."
"Alright, Tony," she said as she leaned back in the chair and took a fistful of pretzels. "What have you got?"
"At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me." Steve stood up and started to collect his things.
Anyways do everything you're supposed to after reading a chapter/story you like. I need to get my brain cells working again.
"To make a statement," he said. "Show a point. It's very much possible that there was a political message there."
"I'm talking about robbing Stark Industries." Oswin's eyes went wide. "Not for money or anything like that. I just need to 'borrow' some of the chemicals they have inside for a little bit."
"This stops it." He tapped his chest where the faint glow of the Arc Reactor showed through his shirt. "This little circle of light, it's part of me now, not just armor. It's a terrible privilege."
Wow, this author's note is lengthy and depressing. On a happier note, September 24th is the date I've set as Lara's birthday. For those curious as to how old she is, I'll say she's thirty-six at the time this chapter takes place. You can figure out how old she is in 2019 from there.
"Sounds exhausting," Tony commented. "The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density."
"Actually, that works out great," Salinas said. "That will be all for now." Jessica nodded and turned to go back to the kitchen. She heard Salinas head down the hall.
"She's right, Clint," she declared. "V-E-C-T-O-R." Barton groaned as Lara stole another thirty-six points.
However, all of that would not happen until years later. On that day in 1995, Rhodey just held out hope that Tony was okay and that he would be able to hold it together through the oncoming storm. Even if he could not, Rhodey promised himself that he would be there to help Tony out, because he had to. He just had to.
"We're trying, though, right?" Natasha squeezed her eyes shut as she brought a hand to her forehead.
"This?" he laughed. "This is a step too far? No, keeping my daughters from me was a step too far! I'm their father! I have a right to see them!"
I don't know what's wrong with me. I just can't focus on writing this story anymore. Maybe it's because I've been going at it non-stop for almost two years? I haven't taken a break or written anything else in that time because I've been so persistent on finishing it, and I'm scared if I do take a break and write something else, I'll never come back to this. I don't want to leave people hanging, but I also don't know what else I can do. As of right now, I'm writing Chapter Fifty-Five and I've been at it for almost a month. I can't get myself to focus on the story. I don't want to leave people hanging, but just be aware that's what might happen.
Yeah, not entirely happy with this chapter myself, but what can you do? If you liked this please review or comment or whatever you kids do these days. I don't really have much to say right now. Also, I am not a scientist. This chapter has probably made that very clear to you.
"Whoa, whoa," she said, putting her hands out to stop him. "Slow down. What's going on?" Steve took a deep breath. He could not believe what he was about to say.
"We have agents doing sweeps of the building to make sure there aren't any more letters," Hill said. "The CDC is dealing with the exposed while we track down the bastards who did this, which is why we need you, Dr. Banner."
"That, sir," she said. "That is just more proof to me that this is an unfit environment for these children." It took all the strength Knežević had not to smack that vaguely smug look off her face. However, she kept talking. "I also think that's more evidence for the officer behind you to give to the district attorney." Knežević looked confused for a second before he felt a pair of strong hands grab his arms and slip the cold metal of the handcuffs around his wrists.
"Are you feeling okay?" Steve asked while moving his hand between Tony's neck and forehead. They were both ways too warm.
"Can you at least tell me the nest is secure?" Natasha knew the line had top-level encryption and she was far away enough from those goons to at least feel comfortable enough to use the code she, Clint, and Coulson had developed for discussing Clint's farm and family. Coulson must not have been in a secure location, though, as he took a minute and went into another room before replying.
Pepper slid the elastic band back into place as she got off the elevator. She had just spent the past few hours arguing with various board members and negotiating between the hospital and police to devise a plan to keep the media away from the area. The last thing Tony needed right now was cameras in his face while he was trying to recover. It was a long and grueling process, but eventually, they worked out a plan. That at the very least was good.
Bruce looked back again to make sure he was not mistaken. He was expecting to see her distressed in some way. He figured the laugh was ironic or something but looking at her face he realized it was genuine. Whatever response she got on her phone, she found it funny. That came as a relief to him. It was the first time he had seen her as anything resembling happy in days. It was good to see.
Natasha was sitting so her back faced the windows that the reporters had gathered in front of. It went against all her training, but she dared not look behind her. She didn't want to give the paparazzi a full, wide view of her face and she wasn't going to. Instead, she kept her mind on her book and ignored the incessant tapping on the glass and the muffled, frenzied shouts of "Hawkeye!" and "Black Widow!" Clint seemed to do the same with his phone.
"If you want to get up there," Steve said. "You're gonna need a ride." Natasha looked over behind Steve and could see an entire squadron of hoverbike-riding Chitauri approaching.
The text message had been proceeded by a package delivery. She found it waiting on her cot when she went to bed that night. Inside of the package was a vial and a card informing her that it was the venom of a Kingslayer Jellyfish, synthesized to be able to be metabolized in the human body through ingestion. Jessica researched the species that night on her phone. A quick Google search revealed that the Kingslayer was a type of Irukandji Jellyfish and was thought to be one of the most venomous in the world. If stung, the victim would rapidly develop the symptoms of Irukandji Syndrome and in some cases could die in as few as fifteen minutes. Although it would appear odd for a United States Congressman who had never been to Queensland, Australia before (where the jellyfish were commonly found) to suddenly come down with and die from Irukandji Syndrome, it was actually a pretty good cover. Doctors and medical examiners would have no reason to suspect it and as such would be unable to come up with a diagnosis or a cause of death. It would seem like he just suddenly got sick and died. It was a good idea, but Jess was somewhat skeptical of the practicality of it.
Thankfully, Hill could finally get away from S.H.I.E.L.D. long enough to help him out. She provided him with a work around in the form of an innocent looking USB flash-drive. All he had to do was plug it into his laptop and he'd be able to connect to the network. Clint frowned when she gave it to him. It couldn't be that easy, especially considering the computer system he was trying to get around was designed by Tony Stark. However, he did need to get in contact with Laura, so he had to go with it no matter how skeptical he was.
The universe was a big place and for what it was worth, Carol had come across some strange ideologies in her time. None were quite as strange as this, however. She knew it was common for people to come to worship more advanced and powerful species after coming into contact with them – the Asgardians and the Olympians were prime examples – but she never had seen a religion that got things so close to the truth, but yet twisted it so far out of reality that it was hardly recognizable anymore.
Natasha pivoted on her left foot and brought her right around to strike the inside of Steve's knee. If it wasn't for the sheer surprise that she could kick that hard, Steve probably wouldn't have fallen forward and let go of her arm. Not that he wanted to keep holding her back anyway. Tony was already gone, and it was just the sheer shock of what had just happened that kept him rooted to the spot and his hand tight around the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's arm.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I mean, I can't expect it to be pretty as Steve's sketches. That would be setting an impossible standard that reality can't live up to."
"Do you want me to shut the door?" Tony nodded and looked back down at Sharon as Peggy went to shut the door. She was currently banging her fist against Tony's shoulder. He wouldn't admit it, but it felt like she was getting stronger with each small punch and it might have started to kind of hurt. She only stopped when Peggy sat down next to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Now, can you please tell me what's wrong?"
Arms and legs flailing as the empty street below began to rush up at him Tony quickly tried to get himself into a calm, freefall position as they tell you to do while skydiving. His only hope was that JARVIS had heard him and was sending out the suit now. Luckily, the AI didn't disappoint. Within seconds of crashing through the window himself, Tony heard another crash coming from behind him. The suit had locked on to the bracelets he was wearing and was quickly working to assemble itself around Tony and catch him as he fell. With everything clicking into place, Tony just barely had enough time to stop his descent before he crashed into the pavement below. He made a mental note to work on how much time the assembly process took up as he steadied himself. Blasting up back towards the tower, Tony felt another bit of satisfaction roll over him as he came to face him.
"We're not going to force Stark to do anything he doesn't want to do," Clint said. "If he says no… Hell, if he doesn't even want to speak with us, we'll leave. Pressuring him into help isn't going to help."
come fast enough – there was one thing she do right now. She just hoped Betty wouldn't be weirded out by the fact that she was texting her at nearly one in the morning. With another few seconds of calm breathing and stucco-gazing, Lara looked back down at her phone and tapped to reply to the message.
"Only word I care about." That seemed to take the edge off Bruce's expression, but only just. He nodded and gestured around the area.
"My bad," was the closest thing to an apology it sounded like Clint was going to give right now. Natasha gestured to the exit.
Quickly pulling herself up and onto the flying motorbike/platform, Natasha was instantly faced with the problem of the two Chitauri soldiers occupying the space with her. The first one was easy enough to take care of. She just had to cut the cord tethering the alien to the bike and knock it off with a single roundhouse kick. The other one was going to be a bit more of a challenge.
"No." Tony liked to think himself better than that, but he couldn't help but wince at the thought of all the blood that was already on his hands just in his first year of being Iron Man alone, never mind the countless deaths he was responsible for during his time as a weapons manufacturer. "Well, not unless I have to," he corrected. Stane's death flashed through his mind at that moment. "I'd be satisfied with kicking his ass so hard it's sore for the rest of his life sentence." At this point, the suit had almost fully assembled around him and Natasha came sprinting from whatever dark corner of the lab she had wandered into.
"I really don't have insurance and I really don't know my social security number," Carol said right away. Amanda shook her head.
"It wasn't your fault I ended up in the hospital that day." A surprised look crossed Bruce's face. "Like I said, Bruce, you apologize when things aren't really your fault. I know that character defect well. If you're still beating yourself up about it, don't. I'm fine. Yeah, I had a few broken bones, but I'm still here. None of us could have predicted that the experiment would take a turn like that. I thought we had Erskine's notes cracked to a T, but apparently, we didn't. It's not your fault, or anyone else's. It was just an accident." Bruce slowly nodded.
He was just finishing that up when Pepper took the phone away. Honestly, he was not so much worried about losing work as much as he was of her accidentally hitting something and calling Carol. He had a feeling that calling an intergalactic warrior had similar consequences to if you called the fire department and there was no fire; the only difference being that a lot more pain was involved. However, Pepper did not let him explain that as she just went ahead and unlocked the phone.
As he laid awake, he couldn't help but wonder if he should hit the nurses' call button on the remote attached to the bed. After all, he was feeling sick and that was a red flag in this situation. However, he couldn't help but think of what would happen if he did. The most likely possibility would be that his symptoms ended up being nothing and he'd waste the nurses time. However, there was also the possibility that they cold end up being something but neither the nurses nor the doctors would be able to do anything to help. To be honest, the latter possibility weighed on him the most. He didn't want confirmation that this was real. Call him an idiot, but he wanted to cling onto the hope that everything was going to be fine for as long as possible.
"Please," Adoniram said, taking a much tighter hold of Carol's hand than necessary. "Call me Brother Daniel."
"Audrey," Knežević pleaded. He got right in front of her and took her hand. "You have to understand…" He didn't get further than that before he heard a loud, sharp scream. Seeing the fear in his daughter's eyes as she glanced down at her hand…
"You're still sure about this?" The fearful knot in his stomach said otherwise, but Tony still nodded.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Well, it's kind of the truth." Pepper rolled her eyes and started walking towards the door.
"Just need some rest is all," he said. "It's the only thing that I've found that sort of, kind of helps." Pepper nodded in understanding.
"And from my understanding, didn't someone open a letter containing a deadly virus in that kitchen a few days ago?" Tony scoffed.
Welcome to the last chapter of 2018! (Also, there's a line in here that I paraphrased Twitter. I'd credit the person, but I can't seem to find that Tweet again. I remember the guy's name was Travis and he had a Doctor Who icon, so thank you for your comedic brilliance, Travis!)
Clint caught sight of Steve, Thor and Natasha standing at the gate, all of them wearing full gear - jackets, utility belts, boots, backpacks, the whole shebang. He frowned. A hunting party would carry weapons. A border patrol wouldn't be wearing so much clothes. There was something else going on.
'Knowing isn't enough. Now it's too late. Rollins and Sitwell are dead, and the rest of your little friends will be, too. HYDRA's too strong. You can't stop them.'
Loki looked uncomfortable and Thor was about to step in for his brother when Steve said calmly, 'What's done is done, Buck. Not much harm was done. I'm okay now, aren't I?'
Steve and Tony were left facing each other. 'Are you really not hungry or did you just miss me?' Tony asked, his smirk growing wider. Steve flushed. 'I had a lot yesterday -' 'Yeah, right. Pretty sure all you got yesterday was a knuckle sandwich, which thankfully didn't mess up your pretty face,' Tony scoffed.
'Loki, calm down. Start from the beginning. I believe you, okay?' Thor knelt so his gaze could be on level with his little brother's.
The sound of gunshots filled the air and he guessed that the delinquents were taking aim at HYDRA, who he still couldn't see, which was good. If he could see a whole ass army charging at him he would actually curl up and cry.
The pressure increased as the spacecraft began to shudder and pick up speed. He heard another vicious crack and when he opened his eyes he found out that the other kid who'd been floating around had hit the wall as well. Out of the three kids who'd removed their seatbelts, he was the only one alive and unhurt.
He made it to the bridge and began to set up the bomb. His hands were still shaking but he worked as quickly as he could, combining the main sections to make a three-part bomb. He knew that if someone had to fire to set it off he had to keep a trigger point so he was extra careful.
Steve took the lead again, going in the same direction they'd chosen before, towards the hill. Everyone was much more comfortable with each other and he heard quiet conversations going on in the background as the delinquents got to know each other more. Bucky jogged to catch up with him and they both walked together in amicable silence.
It was hard work and Natasha blinked at the mess in her tent. Ever since Clint moved to the bunker she had to find another roommate. Or tent mate. Whatever. James - even though he was technically her boyfriend - came over a lot, but he was sharing a tent with Steve.
When the second day drew to a close, Loki announced they were almost at Mount Weather as they sat huddled around a campfire, having taken his suggestion to use a rest stop and go outside to hunt and warm themselves.
They were standing in the top floor of the drop ship. Thor, with his miserable yet resigned gaze, Tony, with his determined stare, James, with his set jaw and furious expression, and herself. Loki was tied up and in the middle of the area.
All of what he said was true. The delinquents weren't ready. Only five of them had proper gear and the rest just had assault rifles with a very limited amount of ammunition. HYDRA undoubtedly could crush them. The only hope the delinquents had was the lack of a bridge. And the graveyard needed to be expanded. After Pietro's death the body count kept rising.
Clint was walking with Natasha, who had decidedly been avoiding them for the entire journey - Bucky especially, he realized - when they finally reached the end of the tunnel.
'Darcy and Betty are here. They wanted to give you both a break,' he informed her, walking across the room and gently shaking Bruce awake. 'Hey, man. You can rest for a bit now, Betty's going to take over Clint, she's got an idea. You too, Natalia.'
There was another thud and then a gasp, as if someone had just taken a deep breath. Tony strained his ears as he worked. He could hear fighting - punches landing on flesh, grunting, loud thuds and an occasional yell.
'Yeah, kill him!' another voice shouted. 'He did Pietro in, he deserves the same thing done to him!'
Apart from those two days of overwhelming, embarrassing emotion, he was snarky and unruffled, hiding his feelings behind a mask of sarcasm and carelessness. None of his wit escaped him on the day they shoved him into the Quinjet taking them to Earth.
Everyone trooped out, except for Clint, who had to stay in the bunker - doctor's orders. She hung out with him for a bit, waiting for everyone to leave, and then she climbed out.
After they'd given Steve the antidote, they'd turned their full attention to fixing the radio so they could contact the Helicarrier. Since Valkyrie was in the medical bay, Tony was the only one working on it. Occasionally Valkyrie would be allowed to go out and supervise the treatment of her radio, but she needed to take rest or her concussion would worsen.
Tony's chest hurt. He hoped his arc reactor was undamaged. He hadn't told anyone about the arc reactor. He didn't feel the need to. Even the media didn't know, and the media knew literally everything else about his life. His arc reactor was a closely guarded secret. Howard Stark clearly didn't want his son to be viewed as weak, or as a sickly cripple.
'It's okay, you just slept for half an hour. Bruce and Betty were done around ten minutes back but they didn't want to disturb you.'
'Well, you're being really silent today. Not like you're very loquacious on a daily basis - by your standards you're quiet, I mean.'
i changed the name of the previous chapter and gave this one its old name so please don't skip this chapter, it's a new one
'I don't think the people sleeping inside will take too kindly to that. Like me,' Bruce said dryly, and Tony shot him a grin. 'Yeah, yeah, whatever. It's not gonna be that hard to camp outside. Man up, live like legends. I just need a
Thor gaped. It was a large, square-headed, gray sledgehammer, with a short, round handle wrapped in brown leather, culminating in a looped lanyard. He reverently took it from Loki and tested the balance. It wasn't lightweight by any means, but he could wield it with far more ease than Loki, and he swung it around, causing Loki to duck and spit curses at him.
Tony Stark might've occasionally broken the rules to go on a midnight run or drink the whiskey they found in the bunker - which, first off, was disgusting - but he did do valuable work. He'd attempted to make a radio that could communicate with the Helicarrier but it had failed spectacularly and had been utterly fried instead.
Thor nodded, his mouth full. 'You need to choose a tent partner, man. Two people or more in a tent. That's the rule. Even then a lot of kids are gonna have to camp out in the Quinjet,' Clint went on, not the least put off by the fact that he had been the only one talking for the past few minutes.
Tony was frozen in shock. He couldn't move, tears silently running down his cheeks, when suddenly there was a loud bang and the people around him disappeared. The world returned to normal and he could breathe again.
'Bunker. You were out for almost a whole day. Natasha and Bruce were sitting with you the whole time. Natasha left maybe six hours ago with Bucky to get herbs for the poultice,' she said, and Clint could definitely detect the quiver in her tones.
Thor mused over this. He had spent most of his time on Earth worrying about his little brother. Maybe stargazing would help him take his mind off such thoughts.
'Well, then?' Rumlow demanded. 'Aren't you going to kill him? Killers get what they deserve, right?'
'What're you thinking about?' Tony hummed, his hand on the back of Steve's neck, his dark eyes focused on his face.
Of course, they wouldn't let her ignore them in peace. Over the course of the first day, they tried to make simple conversation with her. James refused to leave her side and Clint was as annoying as usual. By the time the second day came along they knew something was wrong and they were trying to apologize for anything they had done, assuming she was mad at them.
'There's news at the gate for you,' James told her, lazily tucking a strand of her short red hair behind her ear.
'Give him some space, everyone,' she said, 'the antidote needs some time to work, and if you keep interrupting nothing's going to happen.'
It was really hard to track someone, no matter how much they were bleeding out, Tony realized. Once they lost the trail, beside a waterfall, and they'd all just collapsed in defeat, crawling to the water and splashing their faces with it.
Tony himself appeared beside Steve, his dark hair curling at the edges, his usually wicked smile gone, his soft doe eyes focused on Steve.
'Pietro - he was suspicious. Of me. He was following me everywhere. After the acid fog was over I went to meet with one of the Grounders and he saw me. The Grounder took the knife I stole from Rumlow and he stabbed him, and then he told me to take credit or else I would die, too.'
'I know you lovebirds have been apart for the entirety of half an hour and you cannot wait to fuck each other again because it's like an eternity for you, but I'm pretty sure HYDRA's firing at us, so care to get a fucking move on?' Bucky yelled.
'I swear I'm going to finish the job myself,' she threatened, and he grinned before he could catch himself and pain rocked his body again.
It was a chaste kiss, nothing like the make-out they'd done the first time, and Tony broke away, leaving Steve flushed and tongue-tied.
'Don't talk to me,' Loki sneered. 'Maybe if you were paying attention you would've known that I was gonna do it, but you weren't. That's not my fucking problem.'
He quickly punched in the code to the door, which he only knew because of his father, pressed a couple of other buttons and the doors slowly ground open.
Steve let his gaze wander over a portrait he'd done on the first day they'd shoved him into this cell - him when he was young, asthmatic, and a pathetic bag of bones, standing with his mother and his best friend. Sometimes he wished he could go back to being tiny and unproblematic. He'd have been way to small to cause any kind of damage to Rumlow, and therefore wouldn't have ended up in a cell.
Tony relaxed and gestured for them to step away. Rumlow thought they were trying to force the doors open with brute strength. Let him think that.
'They think you're dead,' she continued, 'because a few days ago all your wristbands stopped communicating with the Helicarrier.'
Tony tried to tell her she was wrong, and that he was free to do as he liked, and being gay was who he was, not a choice and he couldn't change it, and that sometimes he wanted to die because of how they treated him, but he couldn't get any words out.
At least there was a constant stream of visitors. Bucky was there almost all the time, hanging out with Steve, and he didn't mind sitting in the bunker because Natasha was there almost all the time too, chilling out with Clint. Thor came to visit Valkyrie every now and then, and so did Jane, once she understood that Valkyrie was a proud lesbian and didn't want to steal Thor from her.
'No problem, man. They're setting up the flares now, they're almost done, Valkyrie says we should light it up now or else we may be too late.'
Keeping that aside, she also didn't particularly like getting out of harm's way and right into the unavoidable path of another human being.
Bruce and Betty were exactly where Natasha had last seen them, but they had the demolished poultice beside them. She could make out a red plant and a green gloopy mess, but not much else. Darcy was still in Natasha's old spot, holding one of Clint's hands.
He stood with Sam a little way back as Valkyrie counted down from three and the delinquents crouched by the launchers, ready to release the flares. Three, two, one, and...
Tony's smooth, flirtatious voice was back. Steve swore that he wouldn't let it affect him. He took a moment to compose himself and turned around to face Tony, arching an eyebrow, keeping his expression deadpan.
But even though Loki was a murderer Thor still loved him. Something had gone wrong along the way but Thor still believed that Loki was a good person, underneath all the lies and the trickery and the deceit.
i tried to give clint and nat a bit of backstory that's also relevant to their actual backstories but i couldn't flesh it out properly so i may start writing like a prequel to this fic and include everyone's tragic tales. also i know this fic is tagged as alternate universe - no powers, but they all are going to have a semblance of their powers. like nat - she's an assassin in training, clint - really good eyesight, tony - billionaire genius, but i have no idea what to do for those who have crazy powers, like hulk and thor, let's see.
Steve was left blinking after Tony's retreating back, wondering if he'd just made the biggest mistake of his life.
'Holy shit, that's an absolute mess,' he muttered, taking deep breaths. Betty grabbed his hand. 'You stay here, don't get involved. I'll find out what's happening and I'll get back to you.' He nodded and hung out near the trees, nervously fiddling with the hem of his shirt. 'It's strange, isn't it?' a serene voice said, and he jumped. Standing beside him was the Maximoff girl, her long hair neatly tied back, coolly watching Rumlow punch Steve in the stomach.
'Got what you asked for,' choked out Bucky, who'd managed to regain his composure, as Bruce and Betty rushed into the room.
Natasha narrowed her eyes at both of them, and then turned to Thor, who still hadn't said a word. He was staring right at Loki, who was deliberately avoiding his gaze. It hadn't been difficult to capture Loki, according to James. The poisoned knife had been his only weapon and it had gone directly into Steve.
Tony opened his mouth to say something witty to the boy when the spacecraft shook violently. Tony went flying and managed to break his fall by grabbing onto somebody's seat. One of the other kids who had been floating around wasn't so lucky. He hit the wall of the spacecraft with a horrifying crack.
here ya go, another chapter. i think you've understood the pattern by now, lmao - steve&tony, nat&clint, thor&bruce, and i'm going to continue with this hopefully bc i'm an idiot and won't focus on one relationship at once :)
'Friends! You must come up here and look at this! I may have found another bunker much like the one you are standing in!'
His challenge went unanswered. Steve couldn't even look him in the face. Thor was staring at Loki as if he didn't know who the boy was.
'That's the Big Dipper. It's part of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. Do you see it? It's like a cup and a long handle. The cup is part of Ursa Major's chest and her legs start from there.'
Clint was about to comment on Steve's oddly placed expletive when he realized the cause for Steve's swearing and spat out a curse himself.
'That depends on T'Challa. He is the camp's leader while Rogers is temporarily incapacitated,' Thor told her.
'And that's the Little Dipper. Ursa Minor. Two stars from the cup. You see that bright star? That's Polaris, the North Star. It's at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper.'
Thor approached a puddle, scrunching up his nose, trying to block out the smell, when Tony yelled at him.
'Hey, Tones,' Steve replied, smiling despite himself and accepting the hug, burying his face in Tony's shoulder, breathing in his scent until it surrounded him and overwhelmed him.
She arched an eyebrow, being very careful not to let any of her conflicting emotions show. 'Oh, really, Laufeyson? Did you forget that I know all about you as well? You're Odin's adopted son. It was mandatory for us to learn all about the Commanders and their families.'
He stuck his hands in his pockets as they walked. Clint really wasn't one to be quiet like this, but jail had changed him more than he'd thought.
Loki brought out lockpicks from a pocket somewhere in his gear and made short work of the lock. Steve pushed open the door, which creaked and groaned, and stared at the cramped, winding hallway. It looked like a sewage tunnel Natasha had seen pictures of, except without the sewage. It was dimly lit by naked electric bulbs that hung from the rounded ceiling.
'I'm sorry,' he said softly, realizing that the tone of her voice was of somebody who'd lost a person close to them.
'Not bad, Rogers. There's hope for you yet. Now, why don't you run along to your boyfriend? Not that I want to see you make out but I hate seeing you mope around like a puppy left in the rain, so...' Clint let his sentence trail off.
Tony shut his eyes and gripped onto his armrests, his palms sweaty, but his mind was strangely empty. All he could think of was that he wanted this to be over soon so he wouldn't have to listen to the howling and so he wouldn't have to see the red light pulsing behind his eyelids.
'Loki, Father would wish to see you. It has been almost two and a half years,' Thor tried again. 'Hela, too. She missed you a lot more than she missed me. I think she finds you more tolerable than me, possibly due to the fact you are more alike.'
'Look for the black box,' Tony added. 'Maybe we can get some explanation as to why the Exodus ship crashed in the first place. Launching without decoupling it from the Helicarrier shouldn't do any damage to the ship, just to the actual Helicarrier.'
Natasha was sharpening her knife, ignoring everyone around her, when some unfortunate soul decided to see if she spoke words or spat fire.
The three of them ducked out of the tent. Steve called over Valkyrie, who was sitting next to Okoye and sharpening a knife, and then turned to Tony and Bruce.
Part of the reason he wished he was small again was because of Bucky. Their families weren't wealthy or affluent, so both the boys took on jobs when they were young to try and earn some money. Bucky somehow got himself a spot on guard duty, a highly coveted job, at fourteen, and when Steve gained both height and muscle a year later, Bucky managed to get him in as well.
Currently, he was halfway through drawing the moon, lonely and desolate in a background of stars. He'd seen it only once. He'd seen the Earth only once as well - on his seventh birthday, when his ma got him special access and took him and Bucky to a viewing room, only three months before she died of severe sickness.
Wade wheezed and doubled over, coughing. He saw splatters of blood on the ground. Bucky was leaning against the drop ship wall, clearly trying his best to hold in a cough of his own.
They watched the aftermath of the fight - kids tending to their wounds, forming groups and either discussing the skirmish or taking sides and vehemently quarreling, going off to quiet corners to just sit and think. It was a ruin, their camp. A free-for-all, survival of the quickest situation. The girl who'd had her wristband forcibly taken off by Rumlow was crying and Sam and Scott Lang were trying to comfort her.
When Bucky and Natasha had come back and brought with them the news that yes, there were other human beings on the planet, yes, they were armed and dangerous, and yes, they actively wanted to get rid of the delinquents and wouldn't stop at murder, Steve decided that they needed to set up a guard and a border patrol.
And then, when Rumlow's buddies joined him, it turned into a full-scale brawl, which was then pinned on Steve and Bucky. The only good thing out of all of that was the fact that Rumlow and his buddies were thrown into jail as well.
He managed to crawl out of the hole, using his elbows to pull him up. Just as he stood up and brushed off the dirt, pleasantly surprised to find himself out in the open again, there was a shocked exclamation and he whirled around. Loki had clearly come back.
yeah, lots of angst in the next chapter. anyways, that's all from me, have a great day, see you tomorrow and lots of love,
Moving past his outrageous declaration, he especially hated the recovery period. He couldn't run around, shoot arrows, go crazy - all the things he was known for. At least he could still crack lame jokes, although he wasn't sure the others appreciated that skill very much.
'Hey,' Barnes said gently, noticing her face. Fuck, he was good at reading emotions. She quickly tried to compose her features back to the stone-cold mask they usually were, but the damage was already done.
Once his hands were free, he got rid of the rope around his ankles, stood up and went over to the door.
Rumlow jammed the door halfway through by pressing another button so there was enough gap for people to go in and come out, but not enough for them to overpower him. What was visible of his face through the gap was swollen and twisted into a psychotic grin.
He held out his left hand cautiously, looking at her from underneath his dark lashes. She sighed and took it, giving him a small smile, which he returned with a grin of his own. Natasha decided she needed to do something before she ended up like a heroine in a cheap chick flick, sobbing her heart out because some boy broke up with her.
Tony nodded, turned and stalked off. Steve took one step after him, hesitant, and then whirled around, walking in the opposite direction. He really wasn't ready to talk to Tony, at all.
don't really have much to say other than yea, i killed off pietro. y'all knew it was gonna happen eventually. i've even put it in the tags. he's destined to die. sorry, pietro, but it is what it is ✌(-‿-)✌
'Leave the room. I'm being serious. Get the fuck out and go and help Steve. I promise I'll get the antidote.'
'Wow, I really am loved,' he said, trying an attempt at a grin, and then wincing when bolts of pain shot through his body.
'Thing is, we don't need to actually communicate with them,' Valkyrie stated, taking her radio back. She smiled at all of them.
He was spared from listening to Clint's next long-winded anecdote on whether Darcy would say yes or no if he asked her to date him by none other than Rumlow himself. Thor sat up straight, watching the other boy prise open the band around his wrist and then smash it against a rock. His buddies did the same and they threw their wristbands into the fire Loki had lit.
'I might not know anything but I do know you're holding back a ton of emotions and that's going to fuck you up later on.'
'What's going on?' Tony's loud voice carried over everyone else's and the scouting party pushed through the delinquents, arriving at the front and staring wide-eyed at their retching, crying and bleeding friends.
Bruce looked around. The door of the drop ship was open, and he could see delinquents chipping away at the seats - the water from recent rains had already frozen and hardened into ice. Peter Quill and Drax were hanging around the food tent, where they cured meats and stored their food, and were tossing nuts into each other's mouths.
Red smiled, or did his best impression at smiling. 'You have spunk, girl. Doesn't matter. What you have done is far beyond fixing. You started a war you don't know how to finish when you burned a village to the ground with your silly flares. You invaded tour land and sent an armed raiding party to capture one of our people. All these actions are acts of war.'
'Fuck. Well, I can't wait for that and all, but guys, I was kidnapped, okay? I was kidnapped, and guess by whom? Your brother, Thor. Lackey. Loki. Whatever. I think the kid's working for those weirdass people in the woods who want to kill us all.'
She continued pointing out constellations and writing them down in her book. Thor really didn't know how she did it. If he'd come out here and looked at the stars by himself he wouldn't have spotted any of them.
Her thoughts were interrupted by James, Darcy and Betty entering the room. Darcy immediately went to Clint's side, her eyes anxious. She scanned his pale face and then glanced at Natasha, who had her chin on her hands and was watching them both.
She turned back to Jane. 'Catch you later, then, I've got so much to tell you about this Clint dude. Oh, and about Tony and Steve. Did you see the way they were looking at each other? Adorable. I'm pretty sure Barnes has a crush on that redhead, but that's a tale for later, isn't it? See you, handsome!' she called out to Thor, and then flounced away.
James was standing in the doorway, leaning against the wall, his blue eyes unreadable. He was wearing a jacket even in the heat and had his hands in his pockets. She wondered if it was deliberate or an action which he naturally did to avoid strange looks.
He'd raised the alarm and she fled, as everyone was shouting and panicking, all their focus on their wounded Chancellor. Clint and a few other members of the guard chased her down. She knew for a fact that Clint hadn't seen anything of her except for her eyes and the glint of her sniper rifle, since he wasn't the one who caught her and threw her in jail, but she knew she had to be careful around him.
It was strange. She enjoyed being matchmaker and she could read people like books. It was easy to solve people's relationship problems, get others to start dating, seduce somebody and then murder them - that was all fine.
warning: description of death by hanging. if you cannot handle it or if it affects you in any way then please skip this chapter.
'Alright, alright, I'll talk to Tony, calm down, jeez,' Steve huffed, and Bucky grinned triumphantly.
'Anthony, you are a disgrace. I am not here to come back into your life. I do not want you. Who would want to even talk to you? All of your friends, they were your friends in the first place because of your money, and they stayed for it as well. You think they care about you? You're delusional, you pathetic fag,' Howard said icily.
'I've never actually told this to anyone before, you know,' he said conversationally, looking into Steve's compassionate blue irises.
yay, new chapter! i think i'm probably going to stop doing daily chapters because it's taking a massive toll on me, especially since i have a lot of other stuff to work on, so i suppose i'll do one chapter every two days. i'll try to do daily updates when i can but i don't think i can promise it. anyways, steve&tony angst and their first 'i love you's! ack! this fanfic is nearing its end and i'm so happy. thank you to all who commented and left kudos, it made my day and was the reason i continued to write.
Steve internally groaned. Those two seconds of eye contact stirred unbidden emotions in the depths of his stomach and now he couldn't think of anything else but Tony's warm brown eyes. He wished he could draw them, but he didn't have a notebook and pencil.
'Great, then. If we're voting, I'm going with Steve.' He grinned at the blond, who was turning pink.
She shook her head ruefully. 'He said he still doesn't know. It's sometime around dawn, though, and the sun's going to rise in around half an hour.'
They ate in silence after that. It was ridiculously quiet in the top floor of the drop ship. Everyone was either whispering or contemplating life. Clint didn't like it. He enjoyed chaos, reveled in people screaming and laughing and basically making noise. Silence always made him feel tense and on edge.
But he knew it wouldn't have been so easy, and he did not regret saving those kids at all. He just wished he'd managed to get in a few more punches before he'd been taken away. If he was going to be jailed and killed anyway, then why shouldn't he be jailed and killed for the right reasons?
He went over to Steve, who was looking through the supplies. 'Hey, this is pretty sweet. More knives, clothes, a lighter, is that a tent? Awesome. Water bottles - yeah, that's going to be pretty helpful - alright, this is actually really good for us - hey, Tony,' he said, finally realizing Tony was standing next to him.
'Are you so sure about that as well? Loki, I'm an assassin. I was trained in poisons. I saw that blade. I know exactly what's in it. If I wanted I could just kill you, walk out there, get the ingredients and make the antidote myself.'
'You are a hard man to fool, Barton. What gave it away? Was it the sun? Or the sky? Or the prominent lack of buildings, which means the outpost must be underground?' Loki said icily, sarcasm dripping from his words, and Clint flushed.
The mood dampened considerably after that announcement, and everyone chose corners to sleep in without further gossip.
The kid at the front - his name was Wade, Bruce remembered - kicked Rumlow in the ass and everyone else copied him, kicking and punching every bit of Rumlow they could reach. Wanda was standing aside, her hands covering her mouth in horror, and Steve and Bucky were trying to pull the crowd away but to no avail.
"It's also known as diazepam," Dr. Fox explained. "It's a sedative used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. There was some concern that you might be agitated upon awakening. To compensate for your superior metabolism, we gave you a much higher dose than what the average person would receive, so if you feel any side effects – confusion, amnesia, ataxia – just let me know and we'll stop administering it to you."
"His brain waves are like those of a coma patient waking up," someone behind him explained. "And all of his other vitals are giving off similar readings." Tony paid them no attention as he analyzed the data for himself.
"Well, first we interview you face-to-face. Second, our assessment consists entirely of statements you can agree to or disagree with. It makes things a lot simpler and much more precise."
"Last week," she started. "When you were missing, Steve, Dr. Banner, and Agents Romanoff and Barton went searching for you. They started their search by reviewing the hotel's surveillance footage. What they found was a video of you being thrown out of the hotel by management and the D.C. Metro Police. Romanoff sent me the video after she and the rest of the group got word that you were safe." Tony frowned, but it was more out of confusion than disappointment or anger.
Happy Labor Day to everyone in the US! I hope you at least have some way to celebrate considering everything that's going on.
"Hey!" Lara looked up as soon as the man spoke. She noticed that he was halfway out the door and pulling a safety vest on. "What are you doing?"
Also, btw, I used Grammarly premium to edit this chapter, so if anything seems wrong or out of place, let me know.
So, I was not expecting Infinity War to go the way it did. I mean, it was good, but damn the feels... My sister tried to warn me before I went to the theater! I should have listened to her!
Stuffing the belts into her purse and reaching back to feel if the knife was still in her back pocket, Lara felt confident she was prepared enough. The only thing she was missing was her cell phone, which she quickly retrieved from where she left it on the table in the living area. Tapping the screen, she wasn't surprised to see that 911 had hung up on her. She wasn't too angry about it as a huge emergency response was amassing outside and there were likely gunshots heard after the police squadron was likely ambushed by those two agents, resulting in several people calling 911 and them needing to free up the line, but still, hanging up on someone was probably the last thing you should do as a 911 operator. Shrugging that aside for the moment, Lara opened her phone and sent another text message to Tony.
he asked incredulously, and Tony looked where he was pointing. A boy with pale blond hair and glasses, an exact replica of Jarvis, Tony's old butler and the only true parent figure in his life, was standing at the back of the crowd.
After they'd kissed that one time in the bunker, they didn't really make much contact. Of course, Tony being Tony, occasionally flirted and made innuendos and generally loved watching Steve squirm, but apart from that - and that little incident when they chose Steve as leader - he mostly didn't cross paths with him.
'But didn't Fury say something about a mountain?' Natasha said, furrowing her eyebrows, realizing that her throwaway sentence was actually a huge problem. 'He said there was a mountain with a hidden bunker inside, stocked with supplies from the war, but the people never got around to using it. He said we were going to land on it. Mount Weather, right?'
Tony ignored the millions of questions he had in his head and spat out the gag. He needed to get out of there, and fast. He rolled over to the wall, where he could see sharp edges of rocks poking out, and scrubbed the rope around his wrists against the rocks, hoping to at least weaken it.
He wriggled around, ignoring everything Fury was blabbing, trying to figure out how the seats worked. There was a few buttons on the side, for releasing the brace, tightening it, putting it back on and some others. He was reckless but not dumb, so he carefully avoided those buttons and instead turned his attention to the bracelet on his hand.
anyways - yasssss stony kissed, fucking finally, i know it's the fourth chapter but i just needed them to kiss so no slow burn this time, sorry not sorry :) and there's more kissing in the next chapter, woo!
But the best part of the bunker was discovered when Barnes was rummaging around in the box beside the sleeping bags. She was in the main room, checking if the flashlight she'd found had any batteries in it, when he gave a loud whoop of excitement. 'Hey, Romanoff, come check this out!'
He shrugged. 'Yeah. I'm a professional fortune-teller.' He grinned at her and she turned away so he wouldn't see the light coloring of her cheeks.
'You know. The one where I'm pretty sure you asked me out and I rejected you because I was scared, or some bullshit.'
'Loki...' he began, unsure of what to say, and Loki looked up at him. 'Just - stay safe, okay? I - I love you.' Something flickered in Loki's eyes and he glanced away. 'Yeah, I will.' As Thor began to walk away from him, he could've sworn he heard a soft 'I love you too' but when he turned around, Loki was concentrating on building his fire.
They ran for another five minutes and then Clint had to stop, wheezing, his stab wound sending sparks of pain throughout his body. They walked back to camp from then on, not saying a word to each other, resolutely staying silent the whole way.
It was clear that everyone else - including Natasha - was thinking something along the lines of that, however, judging by their uncertain glances and hesitant steps. Occasionally they would stop and listen because they heard some noise but it usually was just the wind.
There was a mumbling exchange of goodbyes and Bruce saw two pairs of boots walk away, towards the river in the opposite direction of camp. Loki hesitated, standing there for a few moments, before spinning around and heading to the camp.
'I remember him as a lot older,' Tony mused, and Pepper jabbed him in the ribs. 'That's his son, idiot. Vision.' 'He had a son?' Tony and Rhodey both said in unison, and she rolled her eyes. 'You can talk to him later. For now you'd better see where we are.'
'Well...' Clint said awkwardly, into the silence, 'should we just... continue, then?' He gestured at the general direction they were heading in. Everybody nodded and Steve took the lead, carefully maneuvering up the gentle slope of the hill. No one had anything to say after that and they all quietly admired their surroundings. Bruce looked especially affected by the squirrel.
They were decked out in new clothes - no, gear - complete with utility belts, straps, boots, even a straitjacket-type thing for Bucky. They also had new weapons, which Thor eyed with a good amount of interest. Steve began to explain how Mount Weather had a ton of cool weapons and gear, enough for almost everyone, when Loki wandered over, his smile uncharacteristically sincere.
Hours later, Clint was woken up by Darcy prodding him in the side. Blearily he opened his eyes. 'What the fuck is happening?' 'The storm's over now. I think,' she said. He sat up, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. Most of the other delinquents on the top floor of the drop ship were awake.
'So... it's a lost cause.' 'Yep, pretty much. We're screwed, aren't we? However, I can make it work short-range - like walkie-talkies. I could make several, actually - this radio system may be destroyed, but it's a work of art. I'll just need some materials. Do you think we could take apart this drop ship to make walkie-talkies?'
Finally T'Challa stood up and climbed down the ladder. Clint cheered him and Darcy smacked his arm. 'Ow, you're almost as bad as Natasha. Why does everyone slap me?'
Steve held both his hands up in a gesture universally associated with surrender. ‘I’m not going to do anything funny. See? I’m dropping my gun. I’m completely unarmed. Just let him go and I’ll come in.’
She laughed. 'Yeah, you can eat it. It's pemmican. I read about it in my history textbooks. Apparently this can last for an incredibly long time without spoiling. They used it in the war back then.' 'Hmm,' Clint said, still suspicious. 'If I die, it's your fault,' he warned her, and she grinned, handing him a fork.
Clint's head was hurting. Like, really badly. He couldn't even think straight, the sunlight was too bright, and he was pretty sure this wasn't the bunker.
The camp had been in uproar. Pepper had told them what had happened and how Rumlow had gotten his hands on a gun in the first place. A delinquent had been guarding him while Tony was upstairs, working on the walkie-talkies. Apparently the delinquent didn't tie Rumlow's bonds well enough and Rumlow managed to wriggle out of them and overpower him.
Steve's hands raked up Tony's shirt and his nails lightly scratched his boyfriend's abs. The other boy softly moaned into his mouth and tugged on Steve's short blond hair. Steve blushed and Tony grinned, pulling him closer, grinding his body into Steve's.
The spacecraft shuddered as it hit the ground with a loud noise and everyone screamed. Even though Tony was holding as tight as he could onto the armrest, his head knocked into the side of his seat and he groaned.
Deciding that he wasn't worth wasting her rest period on, she curled up like a cat on her side of the couch, taking great pains not to touch him in any way, shut her eyes, and fell asleep.
She smirked. 'If you tell me which one is the antidote, I won't go around spilling all your secrets.'
All things considered, twelve and a half years in prison for possession of explosive materials and child endangerment was not a bad deal. Knežević was lucky the jury took pity on him. Not only had he just lost his wife months before, but he was also laid off from his job around the same time. Money was tight and with a lack of job opportunities in sight, Knežević used the last of his funds to create his own make-shift chemistry set in hopes of discovering a new chemical compound, finding a use for it, and selling it on the international market, thereby leaving his family financially secure for life.
Thank you to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN and the guest who left kudos on AO3! It really means a lot! :)
"Hot damn." Lara tapped the screen to give more information. "Well isn't that convenient? He was just caught on surveillance in…"
"Seriously?" she said. "Does this mean that all of this…" She stopped once she caught sight of Pepper's warning look; a look you don't want to be on the wrong side of. She had the sense to at least try to look apologetic as she looked back at Tony. "That's awful, Tony. Is there any way to make this easier on you?" Tony shook his head.
"Alright, Stark," Hill relented. "I'll let you in there, but there will be agents behind the doors waiting to bust in there the second that the situation gets out of control. Do you understand?"
"Well, I also sat here for a while wondering if I could modify that defibrillator to put out enough volts to kill me," Stark said.
'Shit's fucked up, isn't it?' Tony said, his dark eyes watching Loki as the fourteen-year-old trailed after Rumlow. 'I think it's safe to assume that we're a pretty screwed-up gang,' Bruce told him, and he nodded, exhaling sharply.
As soon as he swooped in, Tony knocked Loki to the ground with a repulsor blast to the chest. Once he landed – rather gracefully – on the ground and aimed all his weaponry at the Norse God, who was on his back, gasping for breath, and slowly sat up.
"I don't think I…" Before Loki could finish that sentence, he found himself blown into the next room. Slowly, he got up off the ground and brushed some of the dust off. His entire chest and stomach hurt from that. Not willing to risk getting hit with another one of those blasts, Loki slowly started making his way to where his extraction team would be waiting for him.
"My God…" Audrey said in a soft tone filled with horror. Stephanie buried her face in her sister's side and sobbed long and hard.
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Stark," the officer said. Pepper opened her mouth to argue why he couldn't, but he stopped her dead in her tracks by saying "I know he's here. Miss Conroy told us where we could find him when contacting him by phone failed."
Surprisingly for a second, he thought he heard voices; ones other than that of the Other Guy that inhabited his head. He panicked for a moment but calmed once he realized that the voices were coming from not only outside of his head but outside of his room as well. Slowly, he pried his eyes open.
"Steve." Tony's voice called him back to reality. He turned to see Tony standing there with an indescribable look on his face. It made Steve's heart skip a beat and a fluttering feeling to emerge in his stomach. "Is there anything you want to see first?"
"Steve, stop." Tony just couldn't listen to that. All the vile self-hatred in those words made what bounced around in Tony's own head half the time sound like a glowing appraisal of himself. "You're not sick. We don't think like that anymore."
"Steve," Tony said. His hand reached out to give Steve a comforting touch, but he couldn't quite reach from his position in the hospital bed, so he just settled for brushing the tips of his fingers over the top of Steve's hair instead. "It's alright. I know." Steve's veins ran cold.
"You see, Miss Donovan, the tenants of understanding are simple," Adoniram explained. "In order to have peace, you must have freedom. In order to have freedom, you must have strength. In order to have strength, you must have peace. These three tenants come together to form the basics of human understanding and once humans understand, then stable communities can be built."
"Hey." Steve couldn't help but allow a small smile to come over his face as well. "We're here. You've got to get up."
Steve reluctantly complied and allowed Tony to throw a sheet, the comforter, and that fuzzy blue blanket over him. Tony did not bother to try to tuck the blankets into the mattress, figuring that just having the warm blankets on top of him would be comfortable enough for Steve. Once they were all spread out, Tony climbed back on top Steve, again resting his head on his chest.
Tony brought a hand up to his forehead, feeling a headache coming on. He wanted to do something about this, but he knew he couldn't. It was frustrating beyond belief. There was one thing he could try, though, he was just very afraid of how it could turn out.
"Well, the mighty have to fall somehow." Tony felt Carol squeeze his shoulder hard but tried to pass it off as her readjusting her grip on him. Tony wasn't fooled.
"I wouldn't need that anyway," Steve insisted. "I just need to get used to the fact and accept that things are better now, for Tony's sake if not my own." Although he said it, a part of Steve's mind couldn't help but doubt that it would be as easy as that. The looks the others gave him told him that they thought so, too. His eyes had started drifting towards the door again when Rhodey caught his attention.
