Dean raises his gun and points it at Cas’ head. Castiel looks away clenching his eyes shut. He begins sobbing and begging for his life.
"Welcome home," the younger brother greets, his voice as soft as butter. Dean strode over and threaded his fingers through his baby brother's shaggy hair.
When Sam got upstairs he slammed the door leading to the basement and slid down it, his heart was racing. He ran his good hand over his face and then his phone went off.
Dean grins, leaning over and digging through their nightstand. He pulls out a box cutter, extending the blade. Smirking, he sees the horrified expression on his brother's face as he brings the blade towards him. Dean makes small cuts into his brother's toned abs as he fucks him roughly. "If you can say hard while I cut you, I'll let you come," he explains coldly. Sam hisses in pain, frowning. Dean knows damn well Sam won't be able to. When he goes soft Dean lets out a cooing noise and throws the blade aside. He runs his hands through the blood covering Sam's stomach, speeding up and not bothering to hit Sam's sweet spot.
When Sam enters high school things change again. He has a crush on a girl in his English class. Her name is Jessica. On the way home one day Sammy tells his big brother about the girl he likes. He really hopes Dean will be proud of him, but he's not. Dean isn't happy for him, he gets angry, very angry. Sam gets beaten and Dean makes him promise to never have a feeling like this again. Sammy makes this promise with his mouth full of blood.
"Yes Dean, of course" Sam replies, getting out of bed clumsily. Dean grins, seeing his brother limping as he leaves. That's how he knows he's fucked Sam good.
She knew something was wrong when Cas hadn't come home from his volunteer work. Both parents made the choice to give their son till the early hours of the morning before reporting their son missing, just in case he came back.
The man comes into the room. "I'm a volunteer. Well, it's community service really, I'm on parole, " He calmly explains. "I can slip you some outside food? What do you want?" He asks with a smile.
Dean lets go of his brother, “Oh, and you can clean his teeth too,” he says as Sam wriggles free from his grasp.
Sam winced. "I didn't want to bother you at work Dean. You work so hard so Cas and I don't have to. I didn't want to get in your way. Now that you're home, all I want is to make you feel good," he rambled fearfully. Sam reached for his brother's belt with his working hand. "Let me make you feel good," he pleads.
He goes upstairs, leaving the bottled water behind and collecting his leather jacket. He climbs into the impala busting his music all the way to the hospital.
Sam was signing off his discharge papers. A nurse was making sure he knew how to cover his sling when bathing, what meds he needed to take and when etc.
Dean doesn't last very long.  Either because of the distraction of driving or because Sam's just that good. Sam can't help but pridefully assume it’s the latter. Sam roots around in the glove box, “Dean there's no tissues in here”.
Dean picks up his brother's food tray, throwing it at the nurse. "Security!" The woman yells, clutching her now bruised arm covered in Sam's leftovers.
There's an annoyingly long pause before Sammy answers, “I’m...Dean, I’m not getting out today,” he replies in a sheepish whisper.
The elder brother turns around, "Shut the fuck up! You don't get to tell me to calm down!" He berates loudly. The crowd of people watching the display is growing. Sam catches a glimpse of the social worker from the day before. She has her phone out, recording all of this. Sam grips his bed frame tightly. He wants to snap Mrs. Carter's phone in half. That cunt has no idea what she's doing.
Sam picked at the breakfast he was given. He looked woefully at the cream cheese bagel, apple sauce, orange juice and scrambled eggs. It was alright, but everything tasted artificial and he hated it. He was too anxious about Dean coming to see him to eat anyways.
His silhouette was tense in the dark. "Cas has never cum like that from just my cock," he states coldy, before turning to his brother and glaring at him, looking like a twisted, psycho lunatic in the dim light.
Dean feels comfortable and that his house in order so he has no problem going the garage and climbing into his Impala and leaving for work.
Sam bangs his fist on the counter. "Give me the fucking forms!" Sam yells at her. "I am not a danger to myself, so you can't hold me here!" He yells.
The boy stops kicking, he was still shaking. Clearly trying to control his breathing. Dean smirks. "Good boy, such a fast learner, " he cooed.
Dean makes his way from the bedroom he shares with Sam to the kitchen, still only in his boxers from the night before. He smiles when he finds Sammy already there working on breakfast. He walks up behind his brother, knowing where to step on the old hardwood to keep the quietest footsteps. When he gets right behind where Sam is standing in front of the stove, he quickly reaches out a grabs Sam around the waist. When the younger Winchester jumps startled, Dean finds himself burying a grin into Sam’s back. He’s been doing this since Sammy could walk and he still never fails to make his baby brother jump. “Good morning baby boy,” Dean says in a low growl.
"New rule. Disobeying me gets you thirty. Talking back gets you thirty more. You have to count them. You miss a number, then that shit is on you and it doesn't count." Dean explains, grinning to himself. Changing rules to keep his pets on their toes is the best kind of fun. That way neither of them can ever win.
A few months after, things change again. Their dad starts taking trips with Dean. Sam stays with Bobby during these trips. Bobby is one of his Dad's friends from work. Bobby is nice but Sam is lonely.
Once in the car, there’s silence besides the radio. After no longer than ten minutes in the car Dean glances at his brother licking his lips, “There’s lube in the glove compartment. I want a handjob, ” Dean states dryly.
“Okay...Okay, Dean, I'll take them off,” calms Sam, submitting to his brother as always. Then promptly discards the underwear. Castiel looks away from Sam the second he's naked, still crying softly.
Dean can't help but laugh, "Oh Cas baby, get your head out of the fucking clouds," he declares amused as all hell. This was gonna take awhile.
After that night things change. Dean’s bed is sold. Sam tries protesting that he's scared to sleep alone but his dad doesn't listen. Sammy just gets told that he's a big boy and needs to sleep by himself. He doesn't understand why Dee gets to sleep with their Daddy.
TAKE YOUR FUCKING CLOTHES OFF!! Yells Dean, beyond impatient. The pair on the floor both flinch, then Sam stands and strips down to his to his boxers. He folds his clothes and sets them aside on the floor. “Those too, ” Dean says gesturing to the boxers. Sam frowns and vigorously shakes his head no.
The door is so ordinary – all wood and metal – that Dean begins to feel panic settling into him. This- it’s all supposed to be more difficult: Sammy’s supposed to be tied up inside like the dude in distress that he is, and he and Cas are supposed to bust in, all bloody and heroic as shit, and the villain will laugh his maniacal little laugh, and Dean’s supposed to punch that stupid prick on the mouth for even daring to hurt his little brother. But this… this wooden door? It’s so
“I want to see them again,” Castiel continues before silence falls on them again. “Anna, Samandriel, the guys from the garrison… Balthazar. Even if I have to die to see them, I still want to.”
A man with Castiel’s face stands across from him, a grin that seems entirely too alien fixed on his lips. Sammy’s kneeling beside him, looking utterly pathetic with shiny bracelets linking his hands together. Dean can see it all so clearly, but he feels like everything’s a play without the right players – it’s all wrong, wrong, wrong.
to get off my chest first.” And it is the truth, to be fair. The only difference is that there is nothing hypothetical in what Dean is about to do.
“She won’t mind a few days out; I was thinking to go on my own anyway. Hunting drains her, I think she does it mostly to spend time together, but I’m not sure it will last if I keep dragging her around the country. So, are you in?”
“Don’t Claire-me! – she almost yells, taking a deep breath that doesn’t seem to calm her at all – Don’t try to act like I am the problem here, the one who’s seconds away from falling apart.”
“Yeah, nothing too fancy. We must act quickly, though, or they will strike again. How did it go with Jacob’s parents? Did they tell you something useful?”
“Not to flex, but I’m pretty sure I’ve seen worse.” Dean manages to sound casual, trying not to stare as Cas proceeds to unbutton his own shirt.
He takes his phone out and shows her a picture of the pink substance smeared all over the tapestry in the woman’s living room.
“Dean what are you doing?” Cas asks, the third time Dean walks into the living-room with a disoriented look on his face.
Dean didn’t remember what it felt like to be free from pain, even his dreams were stained with the horror of disease; it was either in his body or outside of it, leaking from the walls. That dream, however, was different. He could get up from the sofa and reach the mirror without having to bite his lips not to scream while he did that, pain was simply not there.
“Then how am I supposed to accomplish whatever mission I was chosen for if I’m stuck in this hospital bed?”
“This is – this is not where I was headed.” As he walked closer, Dean could have a better look of the man in front of him. He talked with a British accent he couldn’t quite place and was almost a head shorter than him.
And Dean knows Sam isn’t just talking about him getting an education, but mostly about him starting to live again, which, from how Dean sees it, is absolutely an overstatement.
“Yeah, of a great-aunt we’d thought dead for ten years before we got invited to the funeral. So what’s the matter with you?”
“Of course. – Cas answers, showing Jack another encouraging smile. – It would mean a lot for Jack to have them with us.”
“Oh no, I’m so sorry.” She says, staring at the pieces of glass on the floor, covering her mouth with her hands. But Jack hasn’t seen her in weeks, so he wants to do is take her into his arms for a tight hug.
And it was a lie, they both were aware, but what was a small, fragile lie to the enormity of the darkness they were stepping into?
Cas opens his mouth, as to speak again, but Dean interrupts him. “You should take the bed. I won’t let your first night of sleep in years be on a couch.”
“Oh, but I wanted to get your attention. Who else if not Dean Winchester and his gang of preschoolers to help me get to the boy?”
Second chapter is here! I'm aware the plot is a bit weak, but it's spn we are talking about, so I hope you will forgive me.
“I’m quite sure convenience stores aren’t always around the corner in the woods.” Dean replies, but worry is almost gone from his voice, replaced by fondness. One that makes Jack’s heart beat faster when the two exchange a quick kiss.
“Actually, I’m not that into law anymore, let alone becoming a lawyer. Besides I’ve got my hands kinda full here – he gestures vaguely to their surroundings, – with all the hunters and the coven. I think Eileen would kill me if I started freaking out about exams too.”
“A bit, he’s always here, but it’s manageable.” He lies, it comes easy to him, he even manages to put on a smile.
Sam took a deep breath before he started to speak, “When I was only six months old my mother was burnt in a terrible housefire and my father was left to raise my brother Dean and I. He was an angry man, consumed by grief and regret, overworked and dissatisfied with anything in his life. A strong tendency towards alcoholism and – well, I guess you know that already. Anyway, Dean was everything to me, he cooked my meals and washed my clothes, dressed me up for school and – protected me not just from our father, but from life. That kind of love was, uh, overwhelming, so when I started to feel crushed, I ran away. I made a lot of mistakes, almost thrown my life away a few times. But, you see, Dean was always there. Not once he flickered or wavered, ever since I can remember. And all of a sudden he is coughing blood on the floor, laying on a hospital bed, barely alive. -- After all the suffering I have brought him, all I feel like doing is bringing him more. I prayed God to guide me through, to either enlighten my path or show me a better way, but His silence has led me here, which I guess is still better than a stranger’s car. I’m begging you to tell me what to do. Just, please, tell me what to do.”
Some days he can’t push himself to return home; he does, though, aware that walking into a bar in the state he is in is simply not an option. But Jody is. She offered him shelter more times than he can count ever since Cas died, and Dean knows he can drive all the way to Sioux Falls and he’ll always find a hot plate and a cheap romcom waiting for him.
“I’ll read you your cards, see what they have to say on the matter. Ultimately, however, no divine entity or downtown witch will be the one to make a decision. You will.”
It wasn’t the first time he had heard that voice, loud and intimidating, but it never seemed as real. So real he had involuntarily allowed himself to hope it was his brother who was talking to him. But it wasn’t him. It was no one, as far as Dean knew.
Crowley nodded, a half-smile on his pale lips. As he almost disappeared from Dean’s sight, however, he stopped and turned around.
, just like when I looked at him and used to see Jimmy, it’s just a fucked-up chain of loss and endless mourning. There’s not much we can do about that.”
His breakdown was, however, put on hold once Jimmy walked inside the room without knocking, a firmness in his step Dead didn’t quite recognize.
“Oh, you don’t know? When little Jackie distributed God’s energy all over the universe, he created such an imbalance that Heaven was forced to shut its gates in order to prevent itself from crumbling to pieces. No angels get in, no angels get out. Now, as I said, most of my fellow angels were almost reassured to know they were free from their obligations towards Heaven, following the steps of you boyfriend, I assume. But I, and others like me, want to go back. The boy is the only one who can do something, but I haven’t been able to find him.”
“Dad would have simply chosen his favorite, I’m afraid. Whoever that was.” Dean answered, while he grabbed the controller to turn down the TV volume. He knew Sam’s little speech was only meant to introduce something more personal and, most likely, uncomfortable.
Dean hasn’t even started to overthink Cas’s joke yet when he is faced with the almost naked body of the man he loves,
When they reach Jody’s house it’s almost midnight, but a trembling light comes from the TV in the living room and Dean can make out the outline of someone sitting on the couch.
He catches Jack and Claire standing a few feet away under an oak tree, Claire is resting her head against Jack’s shoulder and they both look exhausted, but there’s a distinguished satisfaction in their smiles, which almost makes Dean tear up again.
It’s not the words Dean crafted for the moment, rehearsed in his head a million times, bitter regret spilt all over them, lying flat on his back in his bed at night. It’s far from perfect; his hands shake when he cups Cas’ face and, when their lips meet, it is not fireworks sparkling gleefully in the summer sky, but a flood, Dean’s brain short-circuiting to the point of panic. He catches himself exhale, though, the whole solar system finally not falling on him. He’ll never feel empty again, he thinks, relaxing into Cas’ touch.
” he recites from the label before he places his mouth where Cas’s lips used to be, as one the many rituals he has crafted through the years just to feel closer to him, to taste intimacy as safely as possible.
“And why didn’t you tell me?”  Now Sam sounded angry, no more astonished blinking, he was staring directly at Dean with teary eyes and his jaw clenched.
“Oh, I’m not coming. There’s only so much estranged-family-time a dying man can take, but you go ahead.”
TW suicide ideation is mentioned more explicitly here, so please be careful if this is something you're sensitive to.
, Dean has to tell himself, his tone imperative in his head, but he still gets the feeling Claire is reading right through him.
Dean got closer to the book, words were crowding his mind and his heart, submerging him in the impenetrable fog of revelation.
“We’ve just been to a service, for starters.” Dean said casually, looking around at the crowd of relatives still chatting outside the church’s door.
“Jesus, Dean. You’ve been gone for months, but even now that you’re right next to me you’re still not here!”
“Oh come on, smartass. You will catch up, besides, it’s Friday, we can get this done in two days, by Monday you’ll be back to your depressing misogynistic philosophers.”
Sam stared at him, regret in his eyes, then he walked inside the kitchen, as much as a the wire allowed him to.
Bobby must have seen how hardly Dean was struggling to keep it together since he got up to sit closer to Dean’s chest, as the young man quickly wiped a tear away from his cheek.
“Thank you.” There’s something in the way Cas holds Dean’s clothes, like a part of Dean was trapped inside the fabric.
“Dear, why am I astral projecting here? Who are you?” Dean looked behind him, a man around his age was standing a few feet away.
Dean catches the two exchange a roguish grin and seconds later Smile by Avril Lavigne starts playing at a ridiculously high volume.
Charlie looked at the watch on her wrist and said: “Lunch break is over I’m afraid, darling. If I want to spend my whole life looking after sad lonely men I can at least get underpaid to do it.”
“Well, yeah. I was thinking about going to college. I know it’s insane, especially coming from me, but... I like learning stuff and the thought of sitting in a class full of people that don’t know me, listening to some entitled motherfucker talk about books and dead people for a whole hour seems.... calming, I guess.”
Dean is almost through the door when Sam speaks, his face darker, his gaze firm: “You will get to live this, Dean. I’ll make sure of that.”
The weight on his chest feels light enough for him not to be swallowed down by the lake and dragged to the bottom, which is something. His face, though, is still burning, craving to meet the freezing cold water.
“Jack there’s something we need to talk about.” He tries again, sitting down on the couch and gesturing for the kids to do the same. He wishes Cas was there, shoulder to shoulder, maybe a hand placed against his back to comfort and encourage him. Of course that’s impossible, if it was the case he wouldn’t be in that position in the first place. But if there’s even the smallest chance for Cas’ hand to rest on his back one more time, he must take it, for all of them.
And he hated what he was coming back to, his guts twisted the moment he saw the Impala parked outside Bobby’s house and his father leaning against hit. He remembers a time when Bobby hugged him particularly tight and told him
Once he sits up, Dean picks up the blanket that probably fell on the floor at some point during the night and carefully places it over Cas. Then he walks to the kitchen, where he finds Jody, leaning against the counter, a mug in one hand and her phone in the other. When she sees Dean, she gives him a big, pleased smile. “Good morning.”
He tries to focus on his breathing, on the lock holding the door, on how Michael is nothing but a prisoner condemned to a remote corner of his mind. Air burns when it reaches his lungs, he can’t ground himself.
He can hardly believe himself. He has been desperate to find Cas, hold him tight and beg for his forgiveness; hell, he has pictured it more times than he can count, in a thousand different scenarios. Heaven, peace and blissfulness, though, has never even been an option. Is it even a rescue if he’s taking him away from the gentle light of his resting place, only to drag him back on the battlefield? And for what? His ribs hurt at the thought of Cas laying his eyes on the graveyard he has built around him, the barren soil and rotten flesh.
“The Dean Winchester, who survived two Apocalypses and fought all kinds of monsters, angels and demons, tragically dies of pneumonia because he insisted on taking a bath in Nebraska’s waters in early April. Oh, that would make a story.”
Dean tried to stand up, and as he did that, the blood on his hands stained the wall and his sight went blurry, then black.
“NO! — Dean yelled, somehow — No, Sammy, please don’t call anyone.” A series of coughs held him from continuing and once they stopped, Sam was already by the phone next to the entrance.
For once, the future unfolds pleasantly in Dean’s mind, with no ditches or blood on the wall on the last page, nor bathroom sinks and smashed mirrors in the middle, just a road with a big white flag flattering in the distance. Fuck hunting, Sam will cover that, but Dean is far too tired of breaking his bones and stitching his wounds. God, he really wants to bake some bread. Or see the ocean again, drive Jack to a Doctor Who convention, go to Paris, maybe take Cas to the Louvre and point at every weird renaissance painting he can find and tell him it’s them. Mostly, he wants to be around.
“No, not that one, that’s the one where I keep the documents and cards. But they only accept cash in lots of those places. Cas, I think I left it on the table.”
“Hey. How –” he starts, but then leaves the question hanging in the air, in what looks like a mindful attempt to respect Dean’s wish to be left alone with his struggles and his darkness.
“I’m not taking the shoes. – Dean states solemnly, walking down the stairs. – Cas, I’ve put yours inside my backpack, but I simply don’t think it will rain, so I’m saving space in case we wanna buy anything.”
Dean does his best to enjoy everything, from the sound of Cas’s laughter to the pale rays of sunshine on his face, but the finality of his situation constantly pushes him underwater.
When Dean wakes up, it takes him a while to remember where he is, until he opens his eyes to Jody’s living room now fully illuminated, and it takes him longer to figure out his head is on Cas’ lap. Cas who came back to him, whole and healthy, filled with love and compassion, and who is still asleep in what feels like a particularly uncomfortable position.
Cas frowns, the smile on his lips fading slowly, until he says, “Your human condition makes it technically impossible, so despite how tempting the thought of dragging your fatigued body to the shore sounds, may I suggest we swim back? The sun is starting to go down.”
“This is not of your concern. There is a book. A book of prophecy. It awaits in your apartment, look under the tiles below the sink. Once you find it, call for me, I’ll be there.”
“It’s vague, – he sighs, his chest heavier than he hoped – but with our luck it could be a reincarnation of Lucifer.”
But no answer came, the voice’s echo slowly fading from the walls. Dean put a shaking hand on his eyes, trying his hardest not to break in tears, sure his body wasn’t strong enough to endure the harshness of his sobs.
She shrugs, shifting the jacket she’s been using as a pillow higher against the window. “If you want, not a huge fan of classic rock, but go ahead.”
Dean barely managed to keep himself from asking. Desire twisting on his tongue as he masterfully said: “Lucky me, huh.”
Sam was trying to remain calm, Dean could see that, but his voice shook when he asked: “Are you sure?”
He said it. Dean couldn’t, he danced around the word, dreaded it when it was on other people’s mouth. He had never really pronounced it aloud, he thought. Saying it would make it oddly real. And yes, his headaches, his aching leg, his blood
“Bobby -“ he didn’t know what to say, Bobby was holding his hat with both hands and smiling faintly, it looked like he hadn’t slept much lately
“Dean? Dean!” Cas yells as he kneels in front of him; his hands now on Dean’s shoulder, back to the strong grip he is so familiar with.
Claire is joking, Dean takes a bit too long to get it, though. “Kidding. How is he? Still at Bobby’s?”
“Just a couple of vamps, pretty helpless, I almost felt bad when I killed them. They were drinking human blood and kidnapping people, though, so I guess they had to be taken out.”
“He won’t cause you any trouble. Look, he’s really desperate. I even told him Rowena would join us to try and dissuade him, but he persisted.”
“It’s not about forgiveness. – her voice cracks, frustration slipping through –  I can forgive and still look at you and see
It only took a few steps inside the shop for Sam to feel drowned in a strong smell of incense and old paper. The radio was playing a song he remembered his father hated and light barely came through the heavy curtains. Instinctively, Sam dried his palms against his jeans, predicting a handshake of some sort. The woman who walked towards him, with flaming hair and sharp features, however, merely raised her chin in salutation.
Since the night Dean had been sent to the hospital, Sam still hadn’t shown up. Jimmy told him he had come to visit when Dean was asleep a few times, but Dean was pretty positive it was a lie Jimmy said out of the goodness of his heart and because he, without a doubt, pitied Dean, with his illness and his loneliness.
They arrive for lunch, which they eat in their motel room, the TV on just to fill the silence as they search through police reports on the deaths.
Dean tried to get back on his feet to bid farewell to that surreal stranger, but as he did that his head started spinning so violently that he felt his stomach tightening.
Dean is glad when a chuckle comes almost naturally to him. “Things have always been weird and tense between us, in a way.”
Dean didn’t remember falling asleep, but it didn’t take him long to figure out he couldn’t be awake either. He was in his hospital room, which at that point had become the setting to most of his dreams. He was sitting straight, straighter than he could manage with the oxygen tube. He blinked and in a second something magnificent and barely conceivable was standing right in front of his bed. A huge set of wings were occupying most of the room, which seemingly belonged to his nurse Jimmy, or at least
“Uneventful, I hope.” Cas answers with a little smile. Their fingers interwind slowly, until Dean feels his chest revel at the new intimacy they have reached and all its marvelous possibilities.
Pain, however, crushes his body in small electric waves when he is least expecting it, like when a professor tells a funny story or a joke he particularly enjoys, or maybe when he meets someone new, and it takes him a few horrible seconds to realize he won’t be able to call Cas on the drive to the bunker or tell him about it back home, that what awaits him, instead, is the silence of his car and Sam and Eileen’s happiness, suffocating chuckles whenever he crosses the room they’re in like a wandering ghost through the halls of the place he has come to hate.
No one talks for a long time, the songs playing like hymns in a cathedral with doors open wide. Dean buries himself in lyrics that seem to be talking to him directly, almost more painful than his own thoughts.
Dean leans forward, holding both of Cas’ hands in his own from above the blanket, a new sense of courage grounding him firmly to the moment. “Unless your time in Heaven made you reevaluate your priorities and heightened your standards, rightly so, may I add.”
“So what’s the plan? You stay away, busy with your virginity project, until a miracle happens and Dean is healed?”
“Whoa, weren’t we discussing theology?” Yes, Dean knew it, but he still wanted to delay that moment as much as he could.
Sam recognized Rowena’s technique as she laid the cards on the table, it was the Celtic cross, he remembered one of his friends from college doing a reading in his room once.
Jody laughs softly, “Here,” she says, handing him a steaming cup of coffee, “but, darling, Donna didn’t come back from the dead after seven months, I have seen her only last week.”
But Dean interrupts him, getting up from the table, a hand on Sam’s shoulder, “we’re not gonna have this conversation now, Sammy. I’ll see you later.”
Claire shrugs, taking a hair tie from her wrist. “My grandma used to keep her hair in a beautiful crown braid, she was the one to teach me at first. Then, I mean, I’ve watched tons of YouTube videos. Mirrors don’t help much.”
“Yes, my faith is unshakable. Faith in what? You may wonder; I don’t know, not yet. That there is a righteous path and that I’m on it, maybe, that like Jacob and Esau, Dean and I will eventually find our way back to each other and that I am not just a heartless bastard who’s leaving his brother to die in a hospital bed.”
“My name’s Crowley.” And Dean didn’t fail to notice how the man straightened his back, in an attempt to look solemn.
It feels nice to be alone in a crowd, something he hasn’t experienced in years. A calm place in plain sight, where the silent gaze of everyone around him keeps his head above the water.
“I’m not asking, Cas. The bed is yours, besides, as you said I’m so tired I’d sleep soundly even on the floor.” Which is a lie, the more exhausted he is, the harder it gets to fall asleep, but there’s no need for Cas to know that.
If Dean wasn’t busy fighting the urge to lock himself in the bathroom to crawl on the floor and scream, or cry, or both, he would probably fall asleep. His body functioning on anxiety and several cups of coffee alone after more than 24 hours without sleep.
“You don’t mean like a deranged homosexual? Because that’s what it sounds like, Sammy. You know I’m not — I mean, that’s not how —“ Dean stumbled halfway through his reply which failed to be fierce and failed to be bold. He was still a coward, after all.
“Look, I’m not really the religious type, but I must ask... are you an angel? Am I dreaming of my nurse as an angel?” He eventually gathered the courage to ask.
“I just can’t make my mind up. Do we really need an extra pair of shoes? I mean, it’s May. What are the chances of rain?”
They both laugh soundly, but Dean is glad when Claire rests her head on his shoulder, unable to see the tears gathering in his eyes.
“Poor, poor Dean. Your misery is so loud I feel compelled to disobey my orders and just – unburden you, wouldn’t it be nice?”
Dean nodded, trying not to break right in front of Bobby, but the image of the empty apartment waiting for him once he was finally free to go back home was so overwhelming that he could feel his hands shaking underneath the sheets.
“No, I took a day off. Donna should be here in a bit, I talked with Sam last night and we thought we might drive the kids back to Lebanon, Cas too if he wants, so you won’t have to skip any lessons.”
“Alright, goodnight. Jack if you follow me, I’ll give you some towels. – Claire,” Jody gestures Claire to follow her upstairs in a failed attempt to be smooth.
“Dude, you name your dog Miracle, you can’t expect her to stick around. She’s probably on a mission on God’s behalf or something.”
Sam was standing next to Dean’s hospital bed, his legs tired from walking around the room for hours, when Dean’s nurse, his name was Jimmy, got inside:
They all remain silent for a while, before Kaia comments. “The population of this car looks like the human embodiment of a republican’s worst nightmare, the true downfall of neoliberalism and the nuclear family.”
“Then let’s play something else, something you like. Sam somehow managed to add a USB port on a car which is older than me.”
“We’re going camping, Dean. What could we possibly buy?” Claire rolls her eyes, walking towards the door.
It’s sad to admit that, but nowadays Dean can barely bring himself to care about the car, which is a huge red flag he is determined to ignore.
Cas lets out another chuckle, light and sincere, and Dean feels tears pricking the corner of his eyes. He needs two deep breaths before he can look at Cas again.
– he echoes Dean’s words –, visiting the places from your childhood. I know you feel hopeless, I can see it. But this doesn’t have to be the end.”
Cas smiles too, “Just, don’t worry about me, okay? Because I know you will, in your unhealthy, manly, self-blaming way.”
He found the half lit hospital room drawn in silence, no one was in there except him. Sam wasn’t there, nor Jimmy or any other nurse.
It was a cold December night and, for once, Dean hated the silence their apartment was drown in. He had left his bedroom to reach the bathroom but halfway through the hallway he had given up on the idea and now he was on the floor, struggling not to lose consciousness. He didn’t want to wake Sam up, but he really needed to cough, eventually he subsided to it and couldn’t stop.
“Morning,” Dean answers, his head hurting a little from the few hours of sleep he managed to score, “what are you smiling about?” he asks, when he notices the grin is still there, on Jody’s lips.
Dean woke up to voices he couldn’t quite make out. His eyes were burning, he could feel it even if they were still closed. He assumed it was a new nurse, coming to check why he hadn’t eaten any of his lunch.
Once Dean gets close to Cas again, they are past where their feet can touch. He looks into Cas’s eyes, the same color of the water, just brighter, and sighs: “I wish I could keep swimming forever.” But he can’t, he can only sink deeper and deeper until he reaches the seabed.
When he says that, Cas opens his eyes just to meet Dean’s, who is staring at the scene with sheer happiness rushing through him, causing his heart to burn in his chest in anticipation.
The next coughs left his throat burnt, there was blood in his mouth and on his hands and Sam saw it.
“Look at you, you are practically a businessman.” Dean comments, sitting in front of his brother at the kitchen table.
“What are you doing down there?” he instinctively asks, before he remembers they no longer use that tone with each other.
“You really should take the bed; I can’t sleep anyway.” Dean eventually opens his eyes, and it takes him a while to focus Cas, standing in the half-light of the living room, he really should make up his mind and buy a decent pair of glasses.
“This is about you, Samuel. Not your brother.” She answered plainly, a steady smile on her red lips.
“Sammy, if they take me, I won’t be coming back.” Dean felt tears creeping in and if he didn’t know better, he would think he was about to have a panic attack too.
When they leave Bobby’s house the sun is already starting to go down. Jack decides to come home with them, but not before he has made Bobby promise multiple times that he’s going to be fine on his own and that he will call whenever he feels lonely. They thank Bobby for the food and the hospitality, and the old man watches them drive away from the kitchen window.
He turns around to see Claire leaning against the window, her face hidden by her hair and a hand pinching the bridge of her nose.
“There’s no death involved in your mission, Dean.” Castiel’s voice was gentle, his blue eyes that proudly sparkled under his long lashes were framed by kind eyebrows, Jimmy’s, and Dean felt a warmth he had grown more and more unfamiliar with those last few months. “You are a prophet.”
It was Dean’s first day back home, Benny had been gone for a couple of hours and he was watching Family Ties on his couch when it happened.
“Well, not so much. We used to camp here for about a week, Sam would complain from the car ride here up until we packed to leave. I, on the other hand, I loved every second.”
“I’m on a new diet.” She said, as soon as Dean raised his eyebrows. “It’s good for, uh, developing muscles?”
Claire seems to consider Dean’s offer for a long time, then she whispers, “Seems scary either way. But I’d rather not play the damsel in distress.”
Ever since Dean could remember Charlie was always in a rush, carrying half open bags and eating lunch on her way to practically anywhere. When she entered Dean’s room, she was drinking from a large cup full of green liquid.
Cas shakes his hand, but Bobby drags him into a quick hug. “From what I was able to pick up from Dean and Claire’s rumbles you should be human now, right?”
Claire used to open up with him quite a lot once, Dean isn’t sure how they got so close in such a short amount of time, perhaps it was the troubled youth and parental trauma, or it had something to do with how intensively they both experience emotions. Or maybe Dean was just the second best thing next the man who was wearing her father’s body and who, in a way, became her father as well. In any case, that familiarity is gone now; as they avoid eye-contact for longer than a moment, Dean knows Claire can barely hold herself together in his presence.
Which, admittedly, is a funny word for someone who has wrestled his whole life with the urge to obliterate himself from existence in order to escape the constant state of necessity he was in, maybe to access a contingency which Chuck always made sure to make as unreachable as possible to him.
“No, no! – she sighs in frustration – I mean, maybe… No.” she grips his arm and Dean gets to see her eyes watery and red. “I wanna be there.”
“Kaia falls asleep more quickly when she’s alone, so when she’s particularly tired I sit here for a while, so that I can know when to get in. Sleeping is kind of a struggle for her, you know, and we’ve just returned from a case.” she delivers her answer rather coldly, but it’s still more words than those they have exchanged in the last seven months.
“So, how does the future look like?” Dean asks, turning around enough to meet Cas’ eyes from the passenger seat.
Once left with contingency, with broken knees that took months to heal and a world that kept spinning without his help, where his sweat, tears and blood were just
It’s only when they have all gone to bed that Dean stumbles across Claire in the hallway, sitting on the carpet, her back against the wall and her face half-lit by the light of her phone.
“Is sick. – she interrupted him, her mouth twitching – Oh, poor, poor boy. To die at thirty, and a beauty like him, may I add. A tragedy.”
“So, is anyone gonna come eat my lasagna or what?” Bobby appears on the doorstep with a tea towel in his hands and a grin on his lips. “Welcome home, kid.”
, a thought Dean can’t contain when Cas cradles his face, as if he waited a thousand years just to get to that moment.
“I can go to Heaven, I think.” Jack explains, calmy. “If it’s still how it used to be I can easily get inside, but even if they added fortifications, Duma taught me how to access it without going through the gates, it’s taxing, but I haven’t used my powers in months so I should be strong enough.”
“We made it,” Claire says, lightly nudging Dean, which is what he has been thinking for the last ten minutes, but it still hits him with inexorable strength that if it wasn’t for Claire, they would never have gotten Cas back. “but stop crying now, or he’s gonna think I kept you locked in a basement for the last seven months.”
“What? Come knocking at your door and be like, look, Cas I thought this over and I’ve decided I want the bed, get out.”
“Let’s go for a swim.” Dean suggests, already starting to take off his shirt. Cas gives him an amused look.
Dean grabs Cas by the elbow and walks a few feet away from Crowley, but remaining close enough for Jack to overhear their conversation.
Claire seems relieved to find him by the car, breathing, and even happier that Dean has bought breakfast.
, he isn’t able to stop the thought from surfacing in his mind, but he manages to answer, “I guess, eventually. That place is a graveyard, but I’m just – not ready yet.”
Dean is halfway through his second cup of coffee, the shake in his hands barely conceivable, when Sam enters the kitchen.
“Hold on, I’ll give you something to sleep.” Dean says instinctively, opening his bag and starting to look for something clean. “Here,” he hands Cas a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants.
“What’s so funny?” Dean asked, the comfort and pleasantness of Castiel’s previous visits partly gone.
Claire gives him a crooked smile, throwing the jacket on the backseat. “You really want to win me back, huh?”
“I was thinking, – Sam tries again – maybe we could, you know, try to work a case. It could help you focus on something else, besides Michael.”
Charlie smiled again, more sincerely this time. “See, that’s good. Now, tell me, what about the dreams and the voice? What’s so charming about them? Do they turn you on?”
Cas nods, staring at his feet for a while. “I guess I’ll take the bed, then. If you change your mind, you can always-“
Castiel’s brows arched in a kind look, Jimmy hiding somewhere underneath the angelic withholding of his being.
Dean is actually more than grateful for the distraction Claire is providing him from his own loops, besides, knowing she still trusts him enough to confide in him like that lifts a huge weight from his chest.
“Donna is coming over, I don’t want you two to waste all the time you have together listening to My Chemical Romance or to them arguing over videogames, you probably want some intimacy too.”
“You’re sweet, but I think it’s a different kind of feeling holding them back. You don’t see many people with cancer dying alone or without their family’s support. It’s disgraceful how God is often used as an excuse to turn back on your own flesh and blood, as if He would do the same.”
“The Empty is loud because of him, so loud it has started to vomit out some of us with the promise not to draw in your attention. You know, to make it quieter. I guess this is good enough for most of the angels and demons who wander the Earth idly, without a purpose, but it’s torture for me, even louder than the Empty – all this suffering.”
he hears Sam’s voice muffled as he tries to ground himself as quickly as he can, before he extinguishes Sam’s enthusiasm completely, revealing how little he has recovered.
“I see something else about you. Deep inside you, there’s a part of you, the most inner part, entirely free of disease. I can see that.”
Cas is sitting next to Dean on the passenger seat and the kids are bickering over Henry Cavill’s wig in The Witcher, which Dean thinks isn’t too bad, but he usually picks Claire’s side on silly arguments, so he keeps his opinion to himself. He sometimes turns around to look at Cas, who smiles delightfully whenever he notices Dean’s eyes on him.
Jody welcomes him with a big hug, holding his face in her hands for a moment. “Come inside”, she says so softly it almost sounds like a whisper.
But Cas is already back from the cupboard with a broom and a dustpan, which Dean takes with the same swiftness and promptness as he would manage a loaded gun.
“Our lives are hard enough; you shouldn’t have to carry all this extra guilt. But, as an old man, I assure you, all the trauma and learned behavior you see as your landscape right now, will eventually fade away and be nothing but a distant shadow.”
Cas is silent for a while, long enough for the outline of his face to appear blurred to Dean’s dizzy sight.
He tries again, and this time it’s a little easier. His throat is still tight, but at least Michael is silent, it’s just the two of them and the open road.
He heard a knock on the open door, “come in” he said, not even turning around to check who that could be, at 2 pm it couldn’t be anyone who mattered.
“Castiel, it’s not hard for me to know you miss him terribly, the both of you. As I said, he’s not back on Earth, but he isn’t in the Empty either. From what I heard, when the Empty took him, there was almost no grace left and he had developed a soul, similar to that of humans. So, I guess, he could be in Hell, but you have contacts down there, don’t you? I believe you’d know. The Empty must have given him a one-way ticket to Heaven, you open the gates and maybe Jack will be able to get him back.”
“We should sleep for a few hours first.” He hears himself say, “We’d arrive there in the middle of the night.”
A part of him felt that it was his fault for the situation he was in, had he told Sam sooner about his condition he might have had the time to process what was going on. But, after all, despite the anger and sadness which sometimes came crashing through his chest, a part of Dean was relieved Sam wouldn’t have to see this, that wherever he was, the Winchester curse would die with Dean.
Bobby’s house is a nice cabin near the woods, but, from what Dean can tell from the boxes piled up outside his door, close enough to civilization to allow him to get pizza every now and then.
“Of course.” Cas answers earnestly, cupping his face with a warm hand. Dean leans into the touch, pressing a small kiss against his palm, a simple act of love that comes to him naturally, before his mind can rationalize it. Warmth spreads through his body in little waves as they both exhale, all the hurt fading into a landscape far bigger and varied than the one Dean used to be able to see.
“What’s the matter? – he paused, inclining his head to the left in a sign of sudden realization -- You don’t think you deserve to be saved.”
When they are left alone for the first time, it’s with a crippling sensation at the end of his stomach that Dean realizes there is a million things left unsaid hanging in the air just above their head, yet exhaustion eventually has the best of him.
Dean and Claire leave early the next morning, with a bag full of sandwiches and snacks for the journey, Jody waving goodbye from the driveway.
Claire, on the other hand, shows a composure Dean admittedly didn’t expect from her. She paces around the living room, looking at pictures hanged on the walls and making little comments about them. In a few Dean spots Mary, smiling brightly, as beautiful as ever, and his heart aches at all the things he has lost. She then proceeds to braid her hair, humming some of her indie tunes, which is nice because it distracts him for a while.
Dean has never swallowed blades, but he is sure that is exactly how it feels. “This isn’t easy for me.” He eventually says and hates how condescending he sounds.
. – I want you to know… I don’t expect anything from this… I’m sorry it took me so long to… You don’t have to say it back…”
“He goes there a lot, on Sundays and stuff, sometimes with Eileen. But I know he misses him, I do too. This is a better solution for Jack, though, at least for now.”
Sam felt the beginning of a headache sting his right temple. “I see, well then I must get to work. This has been – enlightening.”
“I doubt that. - she shrugged, taking a seat in the chair at the side of Dean’s bed and crossing her legs - You seem shaken. Anything interesting happened? Prodigal son came home?”
“Got something?” Dean asks when he hears Claire mumble something to herself from the other side of the room.
“I’m not sure hearing me talk about our relationship will help her sleep. – But thanks for asking.” She adds, displaying a courtesy smile.
Claire gives him a pained look as they enter the living room. “He looks so happy.” She whispers at Dean’s ear while Jack fixes their jackets on the coat hanger.
. If he did, Dean wouldn’t feel as if his ribcage was seconds away from breaking with the weight of his lungs and the beating of his heart.
She ends up talking over the song, which, from what he gathers, is called Hardline by Julien Baker. There is a warmth Dean hasn’t experienced in a long time when he watches Claire’s hands move around while she excitedly tells him about Julien’s life story and how much she relates to her.
“Bobby will be here soon. He left for the supermarket as soon as you texted me, I think he wants to make one of his special recipes.” Jack seems so delighted that it breaks Dean’s heart, and, for a moment, he considers keeping quiet about what he knows and just give the kids a nice Sunday all together, saving them any more suffering. But Claire knows too, and she would never let Dean get away with his cowardice.
Anger is something familiar to both of them, so neither gets scared when control slips a little. They both have changed through the years, and even Claire, who used to be one of the angriest teenagers Dean had ever met, has lost her edges, softened by the unconditional love that has been given to her, by Jody, Cas, Kaia and all of them. Resentment is something else, something harder to get rid of, Dean knows it because often when he looks at Claire, he can’t help but see himself. The only way is to explode, unleash all the bitterness that has been building up and hope the person on the receiving end is willing to take the hit. Except Dean is not at all equipped for that. So he tries to change the subject.
“Stay.” Dean hates how needy he sounds as he says that, and hates to be the reason for Cas’ grieved half-smile.
Dean does end up falling asleep almost as soon as his body touches the couch and wakes up only to the creaking sound of the wooden stairs. He assumes it’s someone who came downstairs to drink a glass of water, so he doesn’t move, pretending to be sleeping. “Dean?”
It was Sam’s idea, while Dean was maybe at his lowest, to send Jack away for a while, so that he could spend time with someone he trusted, someone who could give him love and stability until things got better, or –
, it’s just a silly song, really, and yet he can’t remember the last time his heart has been this full, or the last time love has felt this easy and natural, not tears against the pillow and closed door, smashed mirrors and bloody knuckles, but a sunny day and the sound of his family laughing inside the car. Nothing has ever felt more holy than that.
Dean’s throat was tight, but he whispered: “This is bad Bobby, I would be more trouble than you think. I can’t ask you this.”
The last time they saw each other, Dean hadn’t left the bunker in a month and slept two hours per night at best. He had waved Jack goodbye from ten feet away, too exhausted to stand on his own legs without leaning against a wall, or to speak, to be fair; while Sam hugged him tight and promised to go see him every weekend.
“Maybe we could stop for a second and check if it’s in the big bag, before we make drastic decisions.” Cas places a hand on Dean’s thigh, in an attempt to reassure him.
Dean remains still even then, buried in Cas’s smell, with his eyes closed as the man he loves strokes his hair and an irrational fear runs through his body, that maybe it’s all an impossible dream and opening his eyes means getting back to a time when their hands are meant only to kill and destroy, when the blood never really washes away.
And Dean knows Jody, more than anyone, maybe even more than Sam, is the one who had to fill the gaps left by Cas and mend the bruises caused by his absence, both on Claire and on Dean. So, yes. She definitely missed him.
“If you don’t come back. – her throat seems tight, despite the fierce look on her face – If you kill yourself to join him and you leave me here, I swear to God, or whatever, that I’ll make sure Rowena drags your ass to hell and tortures you for all of eternity.” Her message isn’t delivered as she probably intended, tears chocking her halfway through it, but it still rips a whole in Dean’s chest. “No, of course not. I’d never do that to you.”
There was a distinctively stronger glow around the man, though, even ignoring the wings. A solemn look which had little to do with Jimmy’s kind eyes.
“Not many of the young men who come in here have their family’s support. It’s a cruel world out there, you see, can’t wrap my head around how someone could abandon their son or brother in a time like this.”
Ever since Dean arrived at Jody’s the night before, Claire has been particularly patient with him, so it feels odd to hear resentment in her answer, but he tries to ignore it.
Once he reached the entrance to the MacLeod’s Bookshop, Sam unclenched his fists for the first time since he had gotten out of the train.
It all happens in a moment, Jack stands and with an unflustered smile on his lips says, “I shouldn’t be gone for long, but in case I’m not here when Bobby comes back, tell him to save me some lunch.”
“Which isn’t too far from where I’ve been.” Dean comments, drying his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt.
“But it’s 3 AM, where is it you have to go to?” Jimmy seemed confused, then disappointment surfaced on his face, as he perhaps realized what Sam was about to do.
“Philosophy. Please don’t laugh. Besides, I don’t think I can get any crazier than this, right? At least this way I’ll be able to quote Schopenhauer or Kierkegaard during my breakdowns.”
“Uh, I was saying that I’m not really familiar with the current application process, so maybe you should ask Patience or Claire, she went to college for a few months.”
At first, after Chuck, Dean buried himself in hunting, almost getting himself killed a few times, secretly disappointed whenever he came back on the other side, but then he broke his knee and was forced to stop, stay home for a few weeks. It was no surprise to him that a few days spent inside the bunker were enough for him to spiral out of the control he had been barely able to keep ever since Cas had been taken from him.
“I thought… I thought they were all gone, I was told the one we killed was the last one.” Dean is aware he’s putting a small stitch on a big, bleeding wound, using passive forms and vague sentences won’t help him, nor Claire, but it makes things easier at least for now.
Dean reaches for Cas’ arm, it’s spontaneous and intimate, but it’s just another reminder of how ambivalent Dean must seem in Cas’ eyes.
Dean almost doesn’t notice that it’s the first time he hears his name on Claire’s lips since he died.
“Dean…” Cas says and it’s that simple, familiar sound that gently carries Dean out of the fog that has been suffocating him ever since Jack left hours before.
“Dude relax, it’s not like we drink each other’s blood for breakfast. I even made sure we used different cutlery, you’re safe.”
When Claire finds him, Dean is breathing heavily outside the woman’s house, his shaking hands buried in his pockets.
He finds himself rolling down the window as soon as the thought of Cas and his weird fixation with pop music hits him. He inhales sharply against the early morning air. Hell, he used to let him play Lizzo in that car.
When they ring the bell, the door opens almost immediately to a smiling Jack, “Dean! Claire!” he merrily greets them, opening his arms to squeeze both into a hug.
“Angels have been cast out of the Empty?” Dean can barely form a sentence with the little air he has left in his lungs.
Jack, though, can’t help but think that his birthday just keeps getting better. “Actually, I think it would be cool to have Uncle Crowley here too.”
Dean has to fight off the sting of annoyance that he often experiences when someone seems to be making decisions for him, and instead make an effort to appreciate how awfully thoughtful everyone around him seems to be.
Dean sometimes feels like it’s all just a cycle of pain, never-ending and keeping him stuck in the mud since he was 4 years old. Yet, as he is sitting in his father’s car, driving down the same old road back to Kansas, he just needs to take a quick look around to see. His hand is on another man’s lap, there’s no liquor or guns in the backseat, but empty tea bottles and a few cheese sandwiches, and, for once, not a drop of blood in sight. Nothing cyclical about that.
Comfort, however, replaces fear in the end. So that when their gazes meet again, Cas’s thighs brushing against Dean’s for how close they are sitting, Dean doesn’t have to ask himself if it’s real, if his lips leaning into Cas’s are nothing but a sick little trick of his mind, because it
“You wanna go back to the Empty? I can kill you right away.” Dean swallows the sour taste of frustration.
Him, Claire and Kaia are squeezed in the backseat, while Dean and Cas are arguing over some cooking program contestant’s elimination.
The kind of unfaltering love Bobby was once again offering him left Dean unable to say anything for a while.
Rowena had listened to Sam’s words with an amused look on her face, shuffling a deck of cards that seemed consumed by time and usage, the corners of each card smoothed and the colors of the images pale.
“Oh, that’s nice to hear, - Dean laughed - now, what is it? Why am I dreaming of you? Why do you look like Jimmy? Is it an angel kink I didn’t know I had?”
“And if we forgot something?” Dean throws a big blanket on the couch, when Cas reaches him and places a hand on each of Dean’s shoulders. “Then we’ll buy it there.”
“No, that’s impossible. Why would I keep it so out of reach? it doesn’t make any sense. Shit, we’re screwed, we have to drive back.”
His face, though, was not what it used to be a few months back: he had grown thinner, paler, weaker. Most times he didn’t care, all in all, he was still rather handsome for a dying man. But in the dream, he was disgusted by his reflection, not in the usual self-loathing charged kind of way, though. It was the state of his body that made him stare in horror, as if the mirror was able to catch something his mind couldn’t. So he opened the third drawer of the wardrobe the mirror was set on and underneath a pile of white t-shirts he grabbed a red lipstick. Dean resorted to lipstick only when he was so sick of his face that the only way to navigate through this phase was to provide some sort of alteration to it, so it was either bruises or lipstick. Generally, he settled for lipstick.
They end up squeezed on the backseat of a bus that looks older than Dean, but luckily it doesn’t smell like he remembered it and his legs are thankful for the act of mercy.
Before Sam could draw back his hand from the table, Rowen softly touched his wrist. Her white neck shined against the trembling flames of the candles as she inclined her head.
Nothing’s changed, he still carries the impossible weight of being alive and the burning wound of his absence everywhere he goes.
It goes well, he doesn’t stutter or run out of breath before he finishes the sentence, hell, he even manages not to mention Cas. It’s still painful, but at least he had the time to rehearsal before Claire arrived.
Jack and Dean share a complicit look, before Dean whispers to his hear. “I think you’ve just granted yourself that hamster you wanted so much. Thanks kid.”
Dean remained silent for a long time, so long that Sam had already let out the beginning of a resigned sigh when Dean started rolling up his sleeve.
When he reaches Jody’s driveway, he sees that Claire’s car is parked outside and his heart skips a beat. They haven’t been around each other much since Cas, which frankly isn’t Claire’s fault, it wasn’t an easy thing to be around Dean those first months. He sends her a text every once in a while, although she hardly answers back, and, if she’s home when he visits, she always makes sure to never be in the kitchen alone with him. Dean wishes he could fix it, he really does, if not just for himself, at least for Cas. He would hate all the resentment hanging in the air.
“I believe you.” She tells him with a smile, wiping away tears with the back of her hand. “Now shut up and listen to my sad little gay songs.”
“An angel has walked into your miserable hospital room to inform you of the great mission Heaven has chosen you for and you worry about Jimmy Novak’s teenage daughter. You really are a righteous man.”
“You’d be surprised to know how much growing up with two awfully religious parents, and grandma, does to your brain.” She says, halfway through the third song on the album, “I have this guilt following me around everywhere. I don’t finish my burger and I think about those who have nothing to eat. I don’t stop at a crosswalk and a voice inside my head tells me I’m not working hard enough to earn my spot in Heaven. I kiss Kaia and –”
Dean throws a splash of water directly at Cas’s face. “You’d love to drag my fatigued, but still handsome, body to the shore.”
They don’t talk much on the drive back, Dean could fill a whole library with all the things he wants to tell Cas, but there is something hanging in the air, dancing to the notes of Cas’ favorite tape, playing softly in the background. A sense of reassurance, penetrating deep underneath Dean’s skin. They can talk about everything later, on their way to the Bunker, in Dean’s room after dinner, at the kitchen table the next morning. Suddenly, it feels almost exciting to be alive.
Dean almost doesn’t hear what she says, but then he forces himself to rerun the question in his head and give a proper answer to it.
, but what spirit? There are no gods here, no ghosts and spirits in America, there are no angels in America, no spiritual past, no racial past, there’s only the political. So I guess it’s up to us to stand up to adversities and, even when God isn’t listening, try to search for His word everywhere. If I can’t endure Dean’s illness maybe I can endure the penance He will subject me to once he gets my prayers.”
The evening unfolds pleasantly, Jody serves chicken and roast potatoes, and they all tell stories about their high school days as they eat the strawberries Alex bought from an old lady at the town’s market. And Dean almost forgets to check if his hands are shaking.
“There is so much corruption in the world these days; sin and evil mix in with our blood and we try to be holy and faithful, but the truth is that we have a soulless president who talks about
Jack joins his dad in front of the trunk, where he can see Crowley, crawled like a cockroach, inside.
It’s not much, but it’s enough for Dean’s throat to tighten, he is feeling everything all at once and at that point he has unlearnt how to suppress it. But he knows that if he starts crying, he won’t stop, hell, he could have Cas, alive and well, standing in front of him and he wouldn’t be able to collect himself.
“That’s a long way from Sioux Falls.” Cas comments and there is a steady smile on his face, it’s barely visible, but Dean has learnt to spot it and cherish it a long time ago.
“This is just a vessel. Jimmy Novak is a devout man and you seemed to be quite fond of him. It would be inconvenient to show myself to you in my true form.”
“Yeah, but it took him a while to pick up the phone. Damn it Dean, knew something was up with you lately but I thought it was just a — a head thing.”
When Sam arrived at the café, Benny was already seated with a cup in his hands and one on the table for the empty seat in front of him.
When they arrive, they find the beach deserted. It’s a Wednesday and the weather isn’t ideal for a day at the lake, but Dean is thankful an audience won’t be there to witness his miserable attempt to tell the truth.
“Look Dean, I can’t tell you how many hours I’ve spent on the phone trying to make him come back to his senses, he says he can’t stay and I guaranteed him he’s gonna regret it, but he’ll come back, he always does, we know him and he’ll have a lot of expiation to do then.”
“Well, I’d have taken the risk of you smashing it against Mr. Smith’s flowerbed, if it meant not having to walk for 4 miles.”
“And how can you be sure this is not something else? Besides, the angels fell ages ago, why would this one start messing around now?”
It didn’t last long, Rowena was able to strike at the core of Sam’s self-doubt a couple of times and at one point he even felt like he was about to cry, right there, in front of a perfect stranger. In the end, however, Sam couldn’t stop himself from asking: “Is this all? Don’t get me wrong, you were really, really good, but you barely mentioned my brother, how is that possible?”
He places both hands on Cas’s bare chest, trying to immortalize the memory of how it feels to act directly on his desires. When they share another kiss, slow and chaste, Dean prays this kind of holiness finds his way underneath his skin, as some sort of companion for the eternity of nothingness he is about to step into.
Cas shrugs, and Dean sees how different, how terribly human he looks, in a t-shirt slightly too big for him and disheveled hair.
I made it! I've finished one (1) fic, which considering my history as a writer is a huge success. I hope you were able to enjoy this despite all the inconsistencies and plot holes which I more or less consciously decided to ignore because they were useless for the happy ending I wanted to give them.
Crowley laughed bitterly, “Oh big deal. You meet a lonely, average-looking, soon-to-be-bald, thirty year old man who still lives with his hateful mother and you figure out he’s unhappy. That doesn’t count, dear. Try something else, something surprising.”
has broken. Jack, on his side, is so painfully forgiving that it makes Dean’s head spin whenever he thinks of all the ways he has hurt him.
“You are loved, Cas. I, for one, love you like I’ve never loved anyone before. And it’s so much not enough, so inadequate. Man, I don’t even know what you see in me, but I love you.”
Dean doesn’t tell him about the stinging desire that is persistently wrapped around his throat, drowned in shame, but still strong. He doesn’t tell him about how badly he wishes to see his skin, his arms, his shoulders, his chest, underneath all the layers that are always separating them. He doesn’t tell him, and Cas seems satisfied with his answer anyway.
“I think we could take them by surprise, I’ll let them find me alone and then you’ll come and stab them, or the other way around if you prefer.”
“I am. — I, I’ve been thinking about the endless cycle of suffering my family has been subjected to, you know. From our grandparents, through our mother dying at thirty and our father at, what? 55? Hell, I don’t remember. And now Dean. So I’m wondering, what if there is a meaning, something that yet escapes us? What if it was always my destiny to overcome all of God’s trials? Maybe my faith is being tested. There must be a meaning, there must be. So I’m persisting.”
Dean chuckled, most of all for Charlie’s intricate eyebrows movements than for the comfort of her words.
Jack, you’re gonna have to never say that again in my presence, ever. – But, fine, I guess he can stay. In the trunk.”
“It is good for the dog — Sam mumbled — look, I’m sorry, you know I am. I miss Miracle too. But what’s up with you today, man? You’re in a particularly bad mood.”
He thinks of Sam going for a run, eating dinner, brushing his teeth, kissing Eileen goodnight, all with the thought of his brother lying lifeless in a ditch. His first instinct would be to smash his phone on the concrete, feel it break in a thousand little pieces as he steps on it, instead, he settles for a short text, promising to call on the way back, when hopefully he will have more answers.
“Don’t. Please don’t. I love the voice, and the dreams too. If you tell him, they’ll change the drug just to spoil the fun.”
He tried to close his eyes, hoping to ground himself and reemerge from whatever hallucination he was having. Instead, he felt a small, delicate, weight land on his lap, and once he opened back his eyes he noticed a black feather had fallen from the ceiling.
, he read as his breath quickened. He had wrestled with his conscience the whole way there. To stand in front of that shop window felt sinful, but what’s another sin to Cain, right? Besides, the actual reason why he was looking through the pockets of his old jackets was to find a distraction of a different sort and it was by total chance that he had stumbled across a note with an address and a phone number scribbled in Jess’ handwriting, his girlfriend from college. Sam barely remembered what it was about, but still decided to take it as a sign to remain on a vaguely right path and not subside to his demons.
. And I certainly owe you this. I owe you the truth, even if it terrifies me. Because I am fucking sick of mourning you and piling up regrets, when all I want is for us to be together. I’ve been praying for it for longer than I’m proud to admit and I don’t know if you ever heard me, but I’m telling you now. I think we should try this.”
“Dean, are you – are you sure?” he asks, tilting his head to one side. Dean is so tense at that point that he lets out a small chuckle.
“We can stop for a while, I don’t know, eat something?” he tries, feeling a bit like a cheater, he’s the one who wants to slow down.
Dean involuntarily backs off, his shoulders pressed against the window. “How did you get out? I saw you die; how did you get out of the Empty?” he doesn’t care about fighting, not anymore, his mind rushes him to one place and one place only.
“And if you’re not?” Claire asks, the pen she’s been playing with since Dean started talking falling from her hands.
Dean waits for Claire by the car in the empty parking lot outside the motel. The morning sun gently hitting his face doesn’t do much for his aching chest or the cold he feels within his bones, but it’s still nice to know he lived to see another day. Claire’s words have followed him throughout the whole night; he guesses that’s how parents must feel when their children point out they’ve been drinking a lot lately or that they heard them crying in the bathroom.
“Dean, - and then Charlie’s voice was softer, no more irony or firmness - you shouldn’t worry about this right now, to be fair, you could say this whole situation sort of cancelled out the need for a coming out.”
“No, no, no. – the man shook his head, looking around – There must be some mistake here. I don’t recognize you, nor this place. Do you happen to be a demon? God, I hope not.”
The shakes are worse when he’s driving, and he knows withdrawal is partially to blame, after all the decision to stay away from alcohol – or sleep, as much as possible in order to prevent Michael from taking over in a moment of weakness, inevitably comes at a cost. What he is about to do, though, eclipses any celestial possession or death sentence, in its gruesome power to overturn Dean’s life, or whatever is left of it, just with a couple of words.
“The boy?” Claire asks, blood is running down her chin, but she quickly wipes it away with the back of her hand.
“Listen, he called the other day and sounded so miserable when I told him about Jack’s birthday, so I took pity on him and invited him to come along.”
“I’m afraid I can’t do much about your body. Your soul, however, is saved. I can assure you that in the grand scheme of things this has a much deeper value.”
“Okay, everyone! Remain calm! – Dean states, storming inside the kitchen – I need you all to listen very carefully. No on moves, I’ll go and fetch the broom.”
Dean couldn’t agree more, nothing, no small accident or half-tragedy, compared to the enormity of the suffering he has endured in the last ten years would ever be able to compete.
“Dude, you’re gonna have to never say that again. – Dean laughed, shaking his head -- But thank you, I appreciate that.”
Dean is pleased to realize that he was right, attending classes is more relaxing than almost anything he can think of. He enjoys sitting still and taking notes as the voice of his professors resonates in the room. It can’t be less than two hundred students, some of which are far older than Dean. Chatting with some of his course mates he has found out that a lot of people decide to take up Philosophy only when they have a stable career or are retired, which is at least encouraging.
As he settled with the idea of death and the boredom of the wait, he realized he was looking forward to hearing that voice again.
Cas’ hand shifts on Dean’s shoulder and it’s so exhilarating that Dean lets out a small chuckle; it’s still stings a bit, his subconscious painfully conscious of the months of despair behind him, but for once sadness doesn’t leave a stain.
“Listen, maybe it’s just a panic attack.” Dean suggested, when Sam came back, but, in truth, he could tell the difference distinctively well: his lungs didn’t just feel tight, they seemed full, bloody.
They all stand in awe, watching as Cas gets back on his feet, his fingers hesitantly touching his face, looking up at the sun, shining proudly against his skin, and then at them, his family.
Castiel lowered his chin, his eyes back to Jimmy’s dark shade of blue and his wings fading first into shadows, then disappearing.
Dean feels as if flames replaced his blood underneath his skin when he sees it’s not just another Rit Zien, it is exactly the same vessel who tried to kill Castiel years before, the same one Dean saw die in front of his eyes.
“A bit of fresh air will benefit all of us, we still have five hours ahead us.” Cas explains, leaving the car.
“Not sure if you’re in the position to make jokes, considering you’re the one who lost her in the first place.”
For a moment, it looks like Sam is about to cry, but then he inhales sharply, and – smiles, a big, warm smile Dean hasn’t seen in a long time. “Of course, of course. You go ahead. Dean, I’m so pr- “
“Dean… – Cas shoots him an imploring look – Honey, Sam and Eileen have been waiting for almost an hour, we really have to go.”
Dean shrugs, unable to unleash a certain tightness to his chest. It can’t possibly be that the rush of happiness from getting Cas back didn’t even last a whole day, he can’t be
had. Still, Jody was patient, trying to replace the talks they didn’t have with distraction and comfort, until Dean couldn’t hold it in anymore and he told her everything.
Pressing his lips on Cas’ skin, kissing his hands like a lover, holds the beamish magic of novelty and the cathartic feeling of agency. He is alive; inside his chest there’s a beating heart, despite it all.
“No, no, no. Hold on, when you will return — will I die?” Dean couldn’t quite believe what he was asking it, but it just came to him before he could stop it, a new, untamable fear.
“So, first song after the latest resurrection. What do you choose?” Claire asks, her head appearing from the backseat.
He was expecting a burst of anger, sharp words and hurt flooding the hospital floor, instead, Bobby sat at the feet of the bed and asked: “How are you?”
“Jackie, Patience is at a friend’s house, so you can sleep in her room. I asked Alex to stay in my room tonight, so there’s her room too, but she has a single bed, so I’m afraid one will have to take the couch.” She explains, almost apologizing.
“I don’t know, don’t get your hopes up. I might still drop out after a semester or something. But I was wondering if you could read my personal statement, check if it’s too corny or too dry.” Dean shifts uncomfortably on his chair, he hates feeling like a hypocrite, especially when it comes to Sam. He feels a shiver crawling down his spine when the thought of Chuck resurfaces in his mind; him who practically dragged Sam out of college twenty years before is now asking for his brother’s help with his own college application. Seems like the sort of sick trick Chuck would enjoy.
Cas has to walk all the way to where Dean is standing, as he seems suddenly unable to move, barely breathing every once in a while.
The scene in front of him unfolds quickly as he stares at it numbly. The angel’s eyes and mouth pour out rays of violent white light, while the end of a blade comes through his stomach. “Thank you.” Claire whispers at his ear, before the body collapses at Dean’s feet.
Over the months Dean has fallen in pretty much every trap that was ever set for him, from Lucifer himself to an insignificant demon making fun of him out of pure spite. It is more or less a conscious decision at that point; better to be deceived, trapped and beaten than to risk walking away on Cas, or on the solution he has been so desperate to find, after all what is the worst that could happen? Getting himself killed?
Dean laughs, “So, Fargo. What do we know about this case?” he asks, and he might be willingly shifting the subject because thinking too much about why Jody seemed so worried wouldn’t do him any good.
“Let me finish. – Benny almost yelled – Who cares? Who gives a shit about what God wants for you? Your brother might be six feet down under in a few months and, believe me, once this religious mania will be over you will have nothing to hang on but your guilt.”
“I think we should let them find us, it’s not the safest way but it will save us time. All we have to do is express a pretty genuine death wish, which shouldn’t be too hard.”
He can’t and won’t say it, not like that, but at the same time he is far too wearied to care about what Jack and Claire may come up with, if they haven’t already.
“They are called Rit Zien, they are a special brand of angel. Their mission is healing the wounded and putting those who can’t be saved out of their misery.”
. He has to fight the urge to stop the car and head back to Sioux Falls to save her the disappointment and the heartbreak.
“Threshold of revelation. This happens sometimes when my soul leaves my body. I can see things, like how sick you are. Do you see anything about me?”
Dean contemplates sitting down next to her, but he doesn’t want to take advantage of the vague sense of normalcy Claire is offering him.
Dean explains all he knows, as Jack sits in front of him, wide-eyed and with arched brows that painfully remind him of Cas. Once he finishes there is no foolish enthusiasm or fear staring back at him, but a solemn look that makes Dean’s skin crawl.
“I’m here, okay? It’s just me, please stay with me.” Cas repeats, over and over until Dean eventually opens his eyes, only to be confronted with blue and worry.
“To Stanford, or whatever university is gonna accept a senior citizen like yourself. I don’t know, man. I figured now that things have settled a little you might want to go back to school, finish your degree.”
On the morning of his fourth birthday, Jack is sitting at the kitchen table, doing his best to enjoy a bowl of cereals and a glass of orange juice, but around him the whole house is quickly descending into chaos. Dean is running up and down the stairs like a madman, with the same pair of shoes in his hands, while Cas and Claire are trying to force a number of items inside a bag that is evidently too small to contain them all.
“Mine tastes good, – Cas answers earnestly – I mean, it’s not too high on the disgusting molecules scale.”
Which could sound like a ridiculous question, of course he remembers his best friend confessing his love for him seconds before dying, but it wouldn’t be the first time Dean’s mind reacted altering his memories or erasing them completely.
“Yes, let’s hit the road, eat cheap burgers and sleep in a crappy motel. It’s my main regret, not getting to work on a case together back when things were good. Let’s do this now, I’ve already found a case in Fargo. If it goes badly, we can keep ignoring each other or maybe, if it goes well, we can
“Listen, guys. – Jody continues, now looking at both Cas and Dean – I hate to do this to you, but Donna and I are both working nights and I’m nervous about leaving these two on their own, they seem mellow now, but, you know, you can never be too careful.”
Cas carefully places a hand on Dean’s, his thumb rubbing Dean’s scarred knuckles. On his dry lips rests a smile so big that it seems on the verge of cracking them.
Jack nods deeply, “He made a deal so that I could live, and I intend to repay him by offering him the choice to get back here. It’s the least I can do.”
“Maybe it’s not the drugs, maybe it’s from all the stress of these weeks. How long have you been here?”
“Yes, the dungeon has cameras. – he watched the tapes over and over, until he couldn’t any longer, sick of the same pitiful display of his mistakes presenting itself on his screen like a recurring dream, he felt nauseous even thinking about it – I know exactly what happened.”
They both exhale, Cas’s touch softening as his hands trace down the length of Dean’s arms in what seems like the closest thing to a caress Dean has felt in a long time. Cas lingers on his forearms, where his nails have sunk and cut the skin, slowly unclenching Dean’s grasp.
“You know Sam, it just came to me that if both you and Dean are off limit topics we don’t have much to talk about.”
“Where are we headed?” Cas asks, putting an end to what, if their circumstances where different, Dean would have called a comfortable silence.
Walking away from the shop felt like slowly waking up from a dream. He whispered to himself, “Oh God, I want to fuck a witch.”
He went through them all, the stages of grief, in random orders, some of those cyclically reappearing, pushing him to the edge more than once.
“My lungs are pretty fucked up, and I’ve had a few stomach problems. Some days I have a hard time breathing that’s why they’re keeping me here, but apparently I might be going home soon.”
” The voice, however, was strong and raw, almost as if it was coming from inside the walls, spread all around the room.
“Don’t ask stupid questions, Samuel. I know a lot more than that. What I still don’t know is what you really want from me. So, go ahead, don’t be afraid to ask.”
They end up sitting on the sand, eating the sandwiches Dean prepared in the morning and drinking a new brand of iced tea that Cas insisted they tried when they stopped for gas earlier.
“This whole Michael thing, man, I know we are trying our best to find a way out. But since I’ve locked him up here, I’ve realized that if anything should happen to me, there’s a few things I want – I
“It’s all wrong. He shouldn’t be here; it was supposed to be me and you.” He mutters, unable to move from Cas’s embrace, despite his pride urging him to compose himself, at least a little.
It’s more information than Dean can process, and his legs feel so weak that, if he didn’t have the wall to lean on, he would fall on his knees.
The room they entered was even darker, only lightened by a handful of candles, with a circular table standing in the middle.
“No, you don’t. – he sighs, struggling to find anything to say that comes even close to reassurance – We’ll be fine. However this thing goes, you’ll have me.” He settles for a half-lie, because they won’t be fine, but he’ll be there. Damn, if he’ll try to.
Dean’s mind refuses to process any of the information he is receiving, holding his breath until the world goes blurry. And then he is here, a gleam of blinding light, and a body lying among the weeds and wildflowers.
Once they get back to their motel room, they both decide to eat some of Jody’s lunch leftovers before they enact their plan, which is actually rather simple, consisting of Claire hiding in the hallway while Dean focuses on how miserable his life is. They are in the middle of a heated discussion over a question on Who Wants to Be Millionaire when the door is thrown open.
, the thought crosses his mind just for a second, before he remembers Claire’s words back at the motel and their conversation in the car. That’s not what he wants to tell him, not what has been keeping him awake like a restless dog in a cage for the last seven months. “Could you tell him that I do too?”
He rests his head on Cas’ chest, who is rhythmically stroking his hair, inducing him somewhere between sleep and wakefulness.
“I’m not your nurse.” Castiel’s eyes went back to the normal, quiet, blue Dean had come to know very well.
And as quickly as he had appeared, Crowley was gone, leaving Dean with a new, striking, sense of loneliness.
“Oh, actually, there’s no need. I think the kids are right, I must have put in the bag.” Dean exhales, a little nervous laughter accompanying his words.
John would hate to know that his war tent has been turned into a place of defiant love and acceptance, and it’s the very soldier he tried to shape in his image and likeness who has made it so, him and his family. It’s not a cycle, it’s a line and it can’t stop moving forward, Cas taught him that.
It’s only when their skin touch that Dean feels it slip, his control of Michael weakening as the screams start to be audible again, like a banshee’s wail.
“I promise.” Dean answered before she walked out the door, not entirely sure of what he was promising.
“You’re wrong. I’m not righteous and most certainly I’m not a prophet. Find someone else. Someone who is not dying – or losing their mind.”
Cas’ presence on earth is contingent, just like everyone else’s in a godless world, and yet, for once, Dean doesn’t feel like they are running out of time. It is their choice to be there, their choice to persevere. There are no clocks in Heaven, but there aren’t on Earth either, just patience, love and compassion, as they learn how to forgive themselves and get to know who they are when they lay down their swords.
He couldn’t remember the last time he was touched by someone he loved, the last time he was held and reassured. And once the tears became too many to hide, Bobby didn’t shy away from the embrace, but remained firm, strong. So Dean relaxed, exhaling for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. As he was shaken by the sobs he’d been holding for so long, he could hear Bobby murmur: “It’s alright, boy. You’ll be alright.”
Claire shakes her head and takes her phone from the couch. “Kaia is here, – and she isn’t alone.” she says in horror.
Crowley remained silent for a while, staring at something behind Dean, before he said: “That’s ridiculous. – but then he whispered, -- Really?”
Dean simply shrugged as he headed back to the sofa, his body suddenly overwhelmed by tiredness once again.
“No. Maybe. Look, we are living through extremely difficult and distressing times, a bit of comfort from above can’t hurt.”
“They could still think I got it from a prostitute, I heard it happens sometimes. — Or that I’m a junkie. Lots of marvelous options. Although no one seems mad, which I assume leaves only one option out. Should I feel relieved? I do feel relieve, to an extent.”
“I was about to leave.” Sam knew Benny’s resentment had little to do with the ten minutes Sam had kept him waiting.
“When we found out where you were I wasn’t sure reaching out was the right choice. – Dean explains, suddenly feeling heavy again, the air sour and thick – One thing was saving you from the Empty, another dragging you out of Heaven. But the kids insisted, and it was my fault that they’d lost you in the first place, so the least I could do was try to make things right.”
“Not really, because they can’t think of something that could leave the bodies in such a state. They were almost evaporated.”
“Oh shut up, Sam. I’m sitting here and telling myself, eventually he’s gotta run out of hysterical, religious-fanatic, borderline homophobic and racist arguments, right? But at this point I’m not sure you are. Shit like this is not easy to handle, I’ll give you that. Dean is not the first friend who gets it and I’ve seen what it does to the people around them, rarely it’s noble and brave. It’s okay to be scared, Sam. What’s not okay is to turn your back on the one person who has loved you unconditionally your whole life and hide behind some piss poor stories about an absent God who is silently imparting you a lesson. –“
He digs his nails a little deeper into the skin of his forearm and takes deep shuddering breaths, maybe closing his eyes will help.
“This isn’t your responsibility, kid. If you don’t feel like doing it, that’s absolutely okay. Cas is probably somewhere better now.” Dean hates how rehearsed his words sound, almost as if he was reading from a poorly-written script.
“I’m here to raise you from perdition.” There was no hardness in his voice as he said that, on the contrary, he seemed rather content, blissful.
“That was his idea. He knew I wouldn’t have been able to convince you unless we took you by surprise.”
“Fuck that. There’s not a single part of me that’s uninfected. My heart is pumping polluted blood.  I feel dirty.”
Dean doesn’t have to ask Cas twice before he accepts to join him on a day out, eagerly following him all the way to the garage. There is not much he wants to know either, if Dean is alright, if he remembered to take his wallet, just the regular things. And Dean’s chest tightens when he thinks of how little Cas knows of what is to come.
“Your unhealthy, trauma-induced, codependency is exactly what is holding you back. You find a way to disentangle yourself from the position of younger brother you’ve had to occupy your whole life and, maybe, you will be able to face the atrocity of Dean’s illness as a man and not as a scared little boy. Dean’s battle is his own, though. You’ve got your own to fight and these were
“Yeah, Melchizedek told the story of the rings to answer the question regarding which religion, between Muslim, Christian and Jewish, was the best, remember? Or did you fall asleep mid-story, smartass?”
“McConaughy Lake. I haven’t seen the sea in forever, but it’d be like a two-day drive, so I figured this was the second-best thing.”
“Yeah.” But her voice shakes as she says that. Her fingers now busy trying to stop tears from running down her cheeks.
Dean can’t help a reproachful look as he hears the name leave Sam’s lips. It takes a strength he wasn’t sure he had to direct the conversation to where he was headed to begin with.
He hears Jimmy whisper so, so softly, “I knew you’d choose me, Cassie”, and when Dean turns to look, he sees Jimmy wrap his arms around Cas, kissing his twin’s temple tenderly, almost reverently,  before making his way down closed eyelids and then the tip of his nose. And when Jimmy tilts his head and presses his lips firmly against Castiel’s, they vanish, leaving Sam and Dean with a faint flap of wings and the last few bars of Chopin in their wake.
That's when he finally removes the cloth and undoes the gag. Castiel is soaked and shaking, his eyes wide with fear. He looks like a little bunny ready for the slaughter. "Welcome back princess," Dean cooed, shoving Cas off the bed and dragging him up by the chain. Cas whimpers and sobs.
Sammy takes in a deep breath, finally and slowly entering Cas. It feels so weird, weird as hell. He really doesn't like it but he doesn't have a choice. Cautiously he gives a slow thrust, he's not sure what he's doing. Years of Dean hurting him, rutting into his hips when they've fucked doesn't help him.
Cas starts shaking, so Dean moves around to pin the boy in place on the bed for his brother. Sam stills behind the boy, just staring at the younger pets entrance, his jaw clenched, he looks so tense.
Sam thinks it over before shrugging. "A grilled turkey sandwich and another smoothy?" He asks softly.
Dean produces lube from his pocket and tosses it on the floor, “Cas I want you to get your shit together. Because you’re gonna give Sam a hand job,” he orders.
Sam is trying to quieten Cas, wanting him calm before he starts to lube him up, but it’s too late. Dean is finished with all this disobedience and raises his gun again…...finger on the trigger.
That summer when the brothers are home alone while their dad is working, Dean starts taking his anger out on Sam instead of birds and stray cats. Sam knows his brother is hurting so he doesn't fight back.
Her dear husband Jimmy stood in the doorway looking exhausted. He walks over and kneels down in front of her, hand on his wife's knee. "I just don't understand why Cas would run away, what could we have possibly done," Amelia says tears running down her face. The police had insisted their boy had just runoff. “Do you think he was being bullied?"
The now unwanted guest holds both this hands up in a submissive manner. "Okay sorry, you're right. Bad choice of words." The man surrenders. "Now what do you want for lunch?" He inquires sweetly.
“Do you want me to shoot Cas? I can shoot him in the leg right now!! If I fuck up I still kill him or cripple him. How does that sound, huh??  Or are you gonna listen to me?” Dean accentuating his threat by gesturing to the gun in his hand.
His parents… Cas had been avoiding thinking about them. Maybe they'll find him? No, Sam said they weren't looking for him. Sam is a good person, he has no reason to lie. His parents won't come for him. Sam is his really his only hope.
There's a loud bang of metal hitting metal, the crowbar meeting the bed frame, followed by a terrified shriek from Cas and causing Sam to flinch. The teen starts crying loudly out of panic and fear.
Sam starts his day with a tray of boring food and a nurse taking his vitals and more blood work. "You a recovered junky or something?"  The nurse questions as she takes his blood.
Dean then stands and storms out of the room. Cas just sit on the floor unmoving terrified. “I fucked up, ” he says out loud and dumbfounded.
Dean decides that distracting his blue eyed kitten might be fun, so he starts working the fingers of his free hand inside the boy. He's still so wet from their sex earlier that it's not hard. He hasn't bothered to find Cas prostate; it never seems to do much. Instead, he drags his fingernails inside the teen. Cas jolts forward and tries to scream, but it's muffled by the fat cock in his mouth. The vibrations from this make Sammy so loud that Dean glares at his younger brother.
Sam's eyes darted from his brother and then to Cas. He looks down at the floor, trying to stop himself from shaking, "I only want you Dean, only you," he  mumbles. He’s shit scared now.
The man's thoughts are cut off again by a knock on his door frame. This time it's his social worker. He groans. "Take a hint and fuck off! " he snaps.
Sam stood up, trying to compose himself. He couldn’t believe Cas just kissed him. How could he ever think he'd want that? He stumbled to the bathroom, doing his best to shake his mind from his thoughts. He couldn’t ever be with anyone but Dean, it’s not like he had a choice. He's Dean's and his alone. He’d never wanted anyone else. Sam then tried to focus on figuring out how to give himself an enema with only one arm.
He picks up the rope he brought downstairs with him. Dean starts clumsily binding Cas' legs his stomach. The sweet boy decides to not be very sweet. His tormentor kicks back. "Kick me again and I will not hesitate to break both your fucking legs!" Dean yells.
Gadreel smiled at Sam. "You're welcome. My treat and I'll be back for lunch. Maybe we can eat together?" He offers softly.
Dean snatches the box, then swiftly pins his younger brother to the wall. Sam let out a loud whimper. "What have I told you about moving my crap?!" The elder shouts.
Dean cleans and bandages the bloody fingertips only tie the abused hand to the bed and untie the other. He repeats all the same actions again.
"Well, I'm going to look more into this vehicle.  It’s the closest thing to a lead we've had so far," Ketch replies, taking his tape and readying himself to leave. Amelia and Jimmy wish the man well. Both parents are unsure of how they feel about all of this as they see Ketch out.
Castiel sits up more crawling over between Dean's legs. He takes the older man’s cock into his hand and gulps. He has no clue what he's doing. He's seen porn but he's never done anything more than kissing. He looks up at Dean the older man looks impatient. Cas is gonna have to get this started. He opened his mouth and carefully takes the head into his mouth, being sure his teeth don't touch it. He doesn't take more than just the head into his mouth. It's clumsy and sloppy but he's doing his best out of fear.
"I'm not going to cheat on my husband with you!" Sam screams. "Get the fuck out of my room!" He yells hysterical. All of the stress of the morning piling up.
Then he stops off the bedroom closet, the large locked wooden box filled with supplies for his sweet Cas. Some for punishment and some for reward. Sammy doesn’t know what’s in this box. Sammy is also smart enough not pick the locks Dean has on things. Sam only ever picked one Dean’s padlocks once, a large one, Dean decided beaten Sam’s hands with the said lock so badly he broke a few bones. Dean’s secret is his. He can’t have his sweet pets getting jealous of each other now, can he? Hence locking up all the cute things he’s gotten for Castiel.
Dean let's go of his lover's hair. "Bedroom now," he orders. Sam goes to stand up,  but his brother kicks him in the leg, still wearing his work boots. Sam yelps in pain, but crawls without question, Dean following closely behind.
It's just a job. It's just a job. You're ok, Sam tells himself as he walks over to the bed and sits down.
Castiel again nods and that's when Dean finally let's go. Cas is still shaking the weight of what's going to happen hits him. He can feel his lip quivering. He lets out sob “P-please, ” Cas begs.
Upstairs Sam heads for the bedroom. Dean goes to the kitchen. Once alone and naked in bed, Sam pulls out his phone and he scrolls down his contact list for Gadreel. He hovers over it, taking in a few long breaths before building the courage to click send a new message. "Hey, it's Sam from the hospital," he says. He lays his phone down on his chest and pulls his duvet up over his body.
Cas is hungry enough he'll do anything for food. Sam told him sex can just be a job, he was insistent about that. If he tries hard enough, maybe it’ll work for him too. He needs to behave in order to survive.
“Sammy you aren't allowed to cum yet, right. Tell Cas when you're about to,” Dean adjusts his sitting position. His jeans are getting tight….fuck!  Sam nods between moans of pleasure as Dean undoes his pants collecting the lube from the floor. He begins touching himself, fingers coated with lube as strokes his shaft almost lazily up and down, occasionally rubbing his thumb over the slit.
Watching Sam fuck Cas was the hottest thing Dean's ever seen. He can't just stand there and watch, he has to join in, something compels him to touch...to join them.
When Dean thinks the boy is ready, he unzipped his jeans and leans in. Cas still tried to tighten so Dean had to push past it. The boy raised his arm to push his abuser away, Dean roughly pins him to the bed. "Don't be a damn brat!". He doesn't mind the tightening. Sammy used to do the same shit. However, he has zero tolerance for fighting back. Yeah, fuck that bullshit. "You know tightening just makes it hurt more right?" Dean runs his hands over the boy's legs as he fucks him. "If you just fucking relax it will feel better" he states angrily digging his nails into the teen's flesh as he fucks the tight wet hole. Castiel whimpers sharply underneath him. There are muffled sounds that could be begging. Dean ignores the noises and fucks harder.
Dean pulls himself from his flashback. “When are you getting out?” He barks, his voice an artificial dark tone trying to hide his hurt state of mind. He hates feeling weak.
He hears Cas curse under his breath. He’s probably regretting making anything of his stuff public, it doesn’t matter. His mistake is one of the best things to ever happen to Dean. Right up there with the taking his brother’s virginity.
Dean deposits the glittered water bottle back into the chest in the closet before making his way to the kitchen. Whatever Sam made smells good. Dean smiles when he finds Sam sitting at the kitchen table. The table is set for two and Sam hasn’t touched his food or beer yet. At least one of his pets knows respect. Dean sits down, looking at his plate steak and eggs. When Dean pops his beer and begins eating is when Sam knows he has permission. “I’m happy to see at least one you know not to piss me off today,” Dean states taking a sip from his beer.
Castiel stills and lowers his head, “Tell him I said I’m sorry,” Then he shoots his head up to look at Dean. His eyes are puffy and red, filled with tears yet again, “Please...Daddy,” He adds on.
It was nearly seven in the evening when Dean got home. He was quiet when approached the sleeping teen. The man ran his hand down the boy's spine, making him flinch away in panic. He leaned over his face, pressing against the side of the mask. "It's time to play baby.” He announced playfully, grinning. Cas screamed it's sound muffled by the hood. Dean slaps him upside the head. "No screaming or Daddy won't play nice!" He shouts angrily, right in Cas' ear. The boy whimpers. Dean is pretty sure he hears muffled sobs. It's honestly adorable at this point. Partly because his pet still thinks tears will save him. Eventually, he'll stop being such a baby...he had to admit, his boy does look cute with tears running down his face. The captor with emerald eyes debates taking the hood off. Nah, he likes this.
"Okay," Sam replied. Oh yeah, that's not gonna happen, he thinks as he pockets the note. He knows it's not gonna happen. He would be dead if Dean caught him!
Dean begins fighting back again. Sam overhears their Dad say that if Dean doesn't listen he will start hurting Sammy. Dean listens after that. Shortly after this Sam starts finding small dead animals in the backyard. He's sure Dean is the one putting them there.
Sam gave the man next to him directions as he drove. They talk along the way. Gadreel was shocked by how into true crime Sam was, which Sam found  amusing. The idea of making an ex-con squirm in his seat with his interests made Sam smirk. "You sure you're still crushing on me?" He grins. Gadreel just chuckles.
At their Dad's funeral Dean sips out of a flask kept in his suit jacket. He looks over the small crowd as he sips. It's then that Dean explains the truth. He points with his flask at the men there and tells his little brother that every man except for Bobby abused him. When Sam his shocked by this Dean just shrugs and asks his brother what he thought all of those trips were for.
Gadreel bursts out in laughter, "no, no, no.  This was part of the condition for my early release,” he clarified.
Sam gets the towel out of his mouth and begins trying to plea with Dean, ”I'm sorry Dee. I'm so sorry”. He's filled with so much guilt that Dean is right. His big brother always protected him from their dad.
Sam kneels down to wipe the sick from the floor. Dean leans against the doorway, he points to Cas then the floor, “help with that, ” Dean orders. The boy climbs down from the bed, his chain jingling softly as he does. Dean can't help but smile seeing both of his pets work together. He thinks of the future. Imagining life where Cas is trained well enough to be let out of his little basement cell. Sam and Cas doing dishes together and going down on him at the same time when they finish cleaning up. Oh yeah, that's his end goal.
Sam let out a sigh. "I can't disobey Dean." He couldn’t. He’d done too much already. He felt a gentle hand on his thigh and he looked over. Castiel was on all fours in front of him, his face was uncomfortably close. "What are you-" Sam's question was cut off by the teen leaning in, kissing him. Shock rushed through him, realizing what was happening, he shoved the boy away. "What the fuck is wrong with you?!" Sam yelled before getting up and running for the door.
In the end, it takes over a hundred hits for Cas to count to sixty. He's a sobbing mess in Dean's lap at the end of it . His ass and thighs were covered in welts, bruises, and bleeding cuts. Dean lifts the boy up and positions the teen facing him on his lap. Castiel looks so confused as his captor holds him, gently rubbing the teen's back. Dean wants the boy to love him as well as fear him. Comfort and aftercare was key for him to pull this off.
Dean takes a few steps forward before taking hold of Cas by his pretty raven locks. "Don't you dare fucking gag," he says through clenched teeth. The boy beneath him let's out a pitiful whimper and Dean shoves his cock into his wet and waiting mouth.
“How the fuck do you know my name?” Dean questions in confusion and shaking Cas the hair. Castiel winces from the pain.
The older chuckles, this kid has balls trying to pull shit like that. "No. Nice try, but no. I was thinking about more food and water. Maybe a pillow and a blanket. Clothes even. Maybe a TV with DVDs or some of Sammy’s books. I know you like fantasy stuff. I saw on your profile.” The boy bites his lip and looks like he's thinking stuff over. "If you let me fuck you without making a fuss, I'll let you have my leftovers from dinner".
Amelia Novak sits on her son's bed. The bed that's been empty for three whole days now. She holds her son's stuffed toy cat to her chest. The toy her son still slept with despite being a 14-year-old. The cat he shyly hid away when his friends came over. The woman gently runs her hand over the bed covers as she fights back another sob.
“Good boy,” he says with a sly smile. Oh, one day Cas will love calling him Daddy, it’ll just take time. He gives Castiel his breakfast. The boy hungrily devours the toast followed by chugging his water. “I’m going to the hospital to see Sammy,” Dean tells him.
Castiel wakes up coughing roughly. His throat feels like sandpaper. The lights are off in the room, but he’s sure there are bruises under his leather collar. His ass hurts, his head hurts, his neck and throat hurt, everything hurts. Why didn't Dean just shoot him? Sam had been shot instead of him. That thought brings Cas to tears. Sam barely knows him and yet he was willing to take a bullet for him. The teen thinks harder, Sam not only took a bullet for him but offered himself up to Dean instead of himself.
Sam finds himself on the kitchen chair,  biting down on a rolled up towel in his mouth. He bites down as his brother crudely digs around inside him trying to get the bullet out, it's excruciating. After several minutes of this Dean stands up and swears and kicks the chair next to Sam against the wall. The younger sibling flinches on reflex, as the chair splinters into pieces when it hits the wall. Sam turns his head and sees Dean leaning against the kitchen sink looking pissed. This isn't good at all. “I can't get the bullet out and now I'm gonna have to drive you to the ER, ” Dean scolds, annoyed. Sam goes to take the towel out of his mouth only to be stopped by a slap to the side of the head. He falls from his chair and cringes as he manages to sit up enough to look at his big brother as he says,  “why did you two have to be such ungrateful brats!? Especially you Sam. You know all the shit I've done for you! You are an ungrateful piece of shit! I'm the one that's always looked after you!” Dean screams knocking the coffee maker off the kitchen table. The cord pulls from the wall. The glass coffee pot breaks against the floor. Dean points at the coffee pot, then looks at Sam, “That’s your fucking fault! You just had to piss me off didn't you?!” he rants.
“Not without permission,”  Dean hisses back. He's never made Sammy ask before, but things always change. Mind games like this are what keeps things interesting. “Cas decided to be a brat and puke on the floor. You need to it clean up. Now!!” As Dean speaks, he slowly becomes more and more venomous.
Cas had a hard time sitting up and when he does his face is covered with tears. He looks so absolutely miserable that Dean coos at him and reaches out to roughly pinch his cheek.
The nurse smiled and shook her head. She shrugged, saying "I've never had a patient be so ok with needles before, that’s all. I didn’t mean to offend you.”
Sam thinks about the basement and sighs in disbelief at his own actions. He kind of liked topping...well, maybe more than kinda liked. "I'm sorry if this is way too much to ask, forgive me. Are you a top or a bottom?" He asks, clinging to his newfound bravery dearly.
Soon the cement floor is clean again, and so are Cas' teeth. The eldest in the room slams the heavy metal door, making both the boys on the floor jump and stare up at him in fear. Both boys shaking with uncertainty, watching Dean as he walks over to sit on the bed. “I want you two to kiss, ” Dean states calmly as the mattress dips underneath him.
Sam shook his head. "You know how Dean is when he's pissed off, why the hell would you even ask that?"
The trips away make Dean stop being sad. He starts getting angry. He tells Sam that he was wrong about helping their Dad. That their Dad is sick and always has been, he’s just looking for a chance to act.
He gives the teen his usual slice of toast and water, along with a multivitamin. The poor baby was already showing signs of malnutrition...being locked in like he was, it made sense that he’d have vitamin D deficiency at least. He had to pull out his pistol to make Cas swallow the pill, shouting "swallow it. God damn it, it’s a vitamin pill. Don’t you dare fucking puke again! Sammy isn't here to be your fucking maid. I'll have you lick it up!"
He gets out the frying pan to cook for himself. God he hates this, he needs his Sammy back! Cooking reminds him of when his father was alive. Ten years old, standing in front of the stove on his little stool to help him reach the nobs at the back of the stove. The pan filled with fat strips of cheap bacon. John coming up behind him whispering in his ear about how he’s just a perfectly sexy little housewife. His stomach turns. Sammy finally answers the phone, “Hey Dee,” he says his voice sounding tired.
Dean turns to Sam and he gestures at Cas with the crowbar. "You're going to fuck him and I'm going to watch," he declares aggressively.
Cas doesn’t respond, but Sam throws his head back and lets out a short moan, hands finding their way to the thick black hair of Dean's other pet. Oh yeah, Castiel figured out just what to do.
The couple look at each other. Amelia looks back at the private eye. "I think the account is called...CastielBlueAngel04"
Dean just gives him a hard stare. “You do what I say. It doesn't matter if your little moral compass disagrees, an order is an order,” Dean uses a direct quote from their late father. Sam winces from the pain and also more than likely at hearing the quote.
Amelia blows her nose into another tissue, "We've checked everything, what good would that do?" She asks exhausted. They'd been out for hours talking to Cas' friends and putting up missing person signs.
His younger brother removes his hand from his face. He reaches for the lube, his face already swelling. Sam squirts lube onto his hand and begins stroking Cas, his firm strokes eliciting breathy moans from the boy, who reacts quickly, moans turning loader as he gets harder, the head of his cock an angry red. He clenches his fists, clearly distressed at the way his body is reacting to Sam’s skilled touch.
The man on the front porch offers her his hand, "Arthur Ketch, freelance private investigator at your service ma’am," He greets them. He’s handsome and has a clipped accent and impressive demeanour. Cas’s parents feel hope for the first time since he disappeared.
Cas complies. The next thing he knows is one of his hands and both his legs have been zip-tied to the bed. Dean straddles Cas and shoves a ball gag in the boy's mouth, strapping it at the back. It's then the teen sees a large pair of pliers in his captor's hand and he screams into the gag. "Hush, I haven't even started yet," Dean tells him annoyedly.
“Eat it then, ” Dean demands without even looking at him. So Sam does. He's never enjoyed the taste of his brother’s semen, but he still eats it when told. That doesn't stop Sam from grimacing and gagging at the taste. Dean glances at him and lets out a small laugh. “You should be used to cum. Dad used to cum in your baby bottles”, He calmly states.  Sam knows this likely isn't true but he'll never tell his brother that. Their Dad never showed interest in doing anything like that with him, it was only ever Dean. That's why Sam can never truly hate his brother. Dean is just trying to cope with the sexual abuse inflicted on him as a child by their dad.
The act is hot enough that Sammy's not far behind him. Dean let's go of Cas and Sam pulls out of the teen..knowing that it's actually safe to let go now.
Dean then smeared lube on his fingers. He promised Cas he’d be nice if he was a good boy. He keeps his promises. His pet needs to know he means what he says.  So the man takes his time working Cas open. It makes sense to aim for the prostate. There's enough of a gap between the tied legs for the older male to see the boy beneath him get stiff. Yes, he finally managed to get Cas hard! He's happy with himself. Toys should like their place being used beautifully. It's the natural order. He tried his best when he was a toy...before he got passed around too much. He can't think about that now. He tries to just focus on getting Cas loose enough to be fucked.
Dean shakes his head, “When you were 14 you knew better already. But then again I did start training long before then,” Dean admits shrugging. “You’ll need to check on Cas’ bucket later. He for some reason decides to chug all the water I gave him instead of saving it. He has a lot to learn,” Dean states cutting into his steak.
Sam gulps as he walks behind his brother, clinging to the railing as they walk downstairs. His heart was racing, his brow furrowed, eyes fixed on the crowbar in Dean’s hand. This wasn’t going to be good.
Dean couldn't take any more days off work. He didn't want to leave Cas alone, but he had no choice. After a quick gas station breakfast (yeah he's not cooking for himself again), the man goes downstairs with his supplies. He still has shit to get done before he leaves.
The doctor scanned over the papers in his hand and nods. "Hmmm, maybe tomorrow if you continue to improve.” The doctor wrote on his chart, then left the room.
Dean pulls out and glittery, tall, blue water bottle. It has a plastic straw and a Starbucks style dome lid. Yeah, Cas is gonna love it. He knows Cas can last a while without food but the boy needs water to live.
Dean let go of Cas and gently moved the weapon back to his side. He gives his younger brother a half smirk. "Oh Sammy... that's my boy," he says with pride in his voice.
Amelia and Jimmy sit in their living room waiting. A car pulls into the driveway. "That must be him!" Amelia exclaims carrying her son's plush cat with her to the door.
When he cums Dean unties the boy and pulls the hood off. Big scared eyes like endless oceans stare him. It was one of the things that made Dean latch on to his Instagram account. Gorgeous blue eyes, adorable face, lips made for sucking cock, a fuckable slender body. The day Cas posted a photo of himself at a friend's pool party was his undoing. It was candid of him in just tiny swim trunks laughing. That's when Dean knew Castiel wasn't just a pretty face. He was a cute fuckable little thing ready for claiming.
Dean finally let's go him and Cas pulls off the cock turns his head. He proceeds to vomit pile and mixed with Dean’s seed onto the floor. He feels so weak. “You did that on purpose!” Dean shouts and Cas flinches.
He got help from a nurse putting on his street clothes. He took a deep breath.  Finally, he was going home to Dean and Cas. He sat on a bench outside, ready text Dean for a place to meet (since his brother wasn’t allowed near the hospital). Just then a car pulled up, stopping in front of him. Sam snaps his head up from his phone.
Cas sobs the whole time until he can't cry anymore, then he dry heaves. He can’t let himself go to his happy place. He's too paranoid about Dean trying to drown him again.
Dean has a short temper and wants Sam and Cas to put a show for his pleasure but things don't go to plan.
Sam can't help but shake it, "I'm Sam, " he responds meekly. Why is he letting himself speak to this person? He wouldn’t put it past Dean to kill Gadreel or both of them for this action. Yet Sam can't stop himself. He hates it. The man takes off his leather jacket, draping it over the bedside chair before sitting down.
Dean raises the gun to him without turning to look at him. “Shut your fucking mouth, ” Dean shouts back enraged. The older Winchester lowers the gun when Sam shuts up.
Sam just smiles to himself when the man leaves. He's crushing it's stupid...this could kill him. There is only Dean or death he reminds himself. He begins chanting it in his mind. Dean or death. Death or death. Dean or death. Dean or-
I realize the timing of this chapter is not great. Considering irl events. However, I started working on this before the news broke. My love and support will forever be with Jared. AKF.
Dean finishes his dinner and leaves Sam to clean everything up. He heads downstairs to check up on his sweet little caged angel.
"I told you to leave me alone. And no, I don't have a fucking eating disorder! The food here tastes like shit! What are you even doing here? Do you work here or something?" He snaps coldly, continuing ripping up the food clumsily with his good hand.
Dean takes Cas' free hand into his. The boy struggles to try to pull away. It's useless, Dean still manages to force the pliers under the boy's thumbnail slowly pushing ripping. The teen screams unto gag from the agony, sobbing.
Then it's time for an enema, the sweet angel fights him and ends up with a boot to the back of his head. The boy holds his head and curls up on the floor crying while Dean gives him an enema. He has to forcibly hold the teen over the bucket when it's time because he's crying too hard to hold himself up. Sammy can not come home soon enough for the elder brother, he's the one cleaning everything up while he’s gone.
The men say their goodbyes and Sam heads inside. The first thing he does is clean up the mess still in the kitchen. He swept up the glass from the broken coffee pot. He picked the splintered wood from the broken chair. Tidying was difficult with only one arm.
“Is this seriously the best you can do?” Dean questions annoyed. Then fists are in grabbing Cas’ hair and forcing more the cock into his throat deeper. Castiel gags through in the nose in panic but Dean doesn't stop. He just keeps going after what feels like forever cum shoots down his throat. Castiel is filled with even more panic. The thought has just hit him, he has no idea if Dean is clean. This sick fucker could have anything. He feels sick.
"Blow him. He's not allowed to cum. If you gag at all you're training with the fucking O-ring again." Dean orders Cas.
"Probably another few days yet. The doctor hasn’t decided. He’ll be around to see you this morning when he’s on his rounds.”
"Just tell me, " he orders, losing his patience. Dean needs him home. Castiel needs him home. He needs to get out of here!
Sam obeys, but when he stands from scooping up his clothes, he notices Dean glaring at a wet spot on the mattress, but he says nothing.
The captor speeds up knowing he won’t last much longer, not with Castiel practically squeezing the cum out of him. He claws into Cas’ thighs and he blows into him with force. His climax rips through him like a violent wave of electricity. His boy comes with a wailed cry right along with him.
Suddenly Castiel’s eyes snap open. He looks at dean terrified and scrambles away. The small teen presses himself against the headboard eying Dean fearfully. “I’m gonna take this off,” Dean says trying to slowly reach for the ballgag. “If you scream I will hit you,” he says waving his finger and speaking sternly. Dean unsnaps the ball gag. The second the gag falls to the mattress Cas screams, he screams bloody murder. Dean punches Cas in the side of the head as a reflex. Yes, the room is soundproof but that doesn’t mean Dean enjoys having a brat scream next to him. The boy starts the waterworks and holding his head in pain.
Dean cums into his brother with loud grunt, continuing to drill into Sam as he rides out his orgasm.
“I went for a jog,”  Sammy answers, his voice filled with confusion and fear. “I’m still allowed do that right?” The younger brother tentatively asks, growing even more confused. Dean does have a habit of changing the rules whenever he feels like it.
Castiel takes a long ragged shaking breath before reaching over to get the lube. He squirts out a good amount on his hand. Probably a bit wasteful for just a handjob, but with Dean's plans for this evening it's probably a good thing. Cas reaches out with his hand, shaking slightly,  and gently takes Sam's length. He slowly closes his fingers around it. He feels Sam’s impressive cock, hard and hot in his hand. He breaks his wide eyed gaze away from it and pauses, looking at both of the brothers.
“De, please put the gun away, ” Sam keeps his voice soft and submissive, trying to reason with his big brother.
When the next “hunting trip” comes around, instead of complying like always, Dean tells dad  that he's an adult now,  he doesn't need to listen to their dad anymore. This argument doesn't end well for Dean.
Sam has no memories of his mother, or his family ever being happy like they were in all the photos hanging on the walls.
Sam has his head slammed into the hardwood of the kitchen table. Thumb broken. Many bruises. This is how Sam spends his time now. Nothing Dean does to Sam could compare to Dean's pain. Sam just wants his brother happy. That's all he wants, even if it causes him pain. It's around this time that Dean starts drinking their dad's booze. He tells Sam that it helps him stay calm. Sam really doubts that. His big brother is just as angry when he's sober as when he's drunk.
No, he'll end up dead if he does leave. Dean would hunt him down and kill him. Probably even string him like a dead deer and gut him. The whole works. "Get the fuck out!" Sam cries.
He hears a loud feral scream from right beside him and that's what gets him to snap his head up. Castiel was being dragged by his hair up onto the bed. The boy’s hysterical. He’s gonna get himself killed!  Sam begins to panic. He pleads and shouts to his brother. “Dean, take me instead!”
Dean brings his free hand up, swinging it down and smacking his brother's ass for no reason other than amusement. He does it again, harder this time. He was enjoying the sound of slapping flesh and his brother's beautiful whimpers. He stills hand before his interest in smacking Dean starts again, the sadist in him enjoying giving pain rather than pleasure. Watching his brother's erection slowly wilt was making it more fun. He keeps roughly spanking Sam, only stopping when his ass was bright red. Sam looks to be on the verge of tears and his hand hurts. Dean lines up his cock, giving it a few wet strokes before fucking into Sam roughly.
Cas gives a small nod trying to move so much as Dean still has his fist in his hair. “Dean please let of my hair I'll be good I promise, ” Castiel whimpers and bargains and begs. His head is pounding just his heart.
Sam starts moving then, trying to be faster or more aggressive or whatever he's supposed to be to top correctly. As he quickens, however, Sam notices it's getting harder and harder to separate himself from what he's doing. He's not used to having to stay mentally present for all of sex. Its easier to think about as just a job if doesn't have to think about what's happening. The pain. He looks at Dean jerking off infront of him, but that just makes it worse because he just wishes he were under Dean right now. He wants to be anywhere but here. He can't believe Cas likes him, he tried to kiss him. And now he's being forced to fuck him. Shit, shit... no no no! He’s getting soft. He needs to find something else to think about and quick.
"It’s not fucking rocket science, it's sex, it's not that fucking hard. Maybe you need some motivation." Dean suggests, picking up his crowbar and holding it out to his brother, tracing the item over the younger brothers sling. He follows a line up to Sam's injured shoulder, glaring ice daggers into his little brother's soul. "How long was your surgery Sammy? A few hours at least, right? I'm not afraid to fuck all that up. You belong to me and I can do anything I want to you".
Dean sighs, but does just that. It's a struggle to get Sam fully undressed with the stupid fucking sling in the way. He manages it though, and then promptly forces Sam onto his back. Dean strips himself down completely as well. He takes his time working Sam open. He's missed touching his brother so much, he wanted to savor every second. Two lube covered fingers thrust into Sam roughly, then three, all hitting the bundle of nerves inside him. Sam throws his head back moaning. "God I've missed this baby boy" Dean utters with a grin.
One day things change. Sammy finally decides to ask Dee about what their Dad has been doing. He asks his brother about the noises at night and why dad hurts Dean. That was the only time Sam ever saw his brother cry. Dean explained that their dad is hurting, that he's been hurting since their mom died. What Dean does is the only thing that can help. Sammy asks what that thing is, and that's when Dean gives his little brother the talk. Sam doesn't understand why their dad needs to have sex with Dean. It doesn't seem normal. But Sam lets it go. Sam is however worried that his dad will want to have sex with him as well. Dean assures his little brother that he will keep him safe. Sam will never be harmed by their Daddy, Dean will make sure of that!
"Sam! Thank god you're back!" Cas exclaimed excitedly, rushing for the door with his arms wide open, only to end up choked by his falling down a couple of feet away. He coughed, but gave the elder boy a weak smile.
Sam watches in a haze of pain, unable to even push his hair out of his face as his brother and lover rapes someone. He watches from the floor as his big brother, the center of his universe, chokes out the fourteen-year-old beneath him to stop the kid from screaming. He watches as his best and only friend chokes the teen until he passes out. He watches as the only love he's ever had continues to rape the now unconscious minor. Never stopping. Never slowing down.
When it begins to hurt and the hand is replaced with something bigger. Cas forces himself not to think about the pain.
Dean gets up from the bed walking over and kneeling next Castiel shoving the gun against his temple. “I don't know Sammy it seems like you’re not obeying me. Maybe you’re not as well trained as I thought. Maybe I should get rid of Cas so I can focus on retraining you,” He says in a cocky tone, looking at his now sheepish brother. He then drags his pistol across Castiel's face. Stopping at the boy’s mouth and shoving gun onto the teen's mouth roughly. He hears Castiel gag around it. “Suck on my pistol Cas. Maybe you'll be better at this then BJ’s”.
“Your toilet is over there,” Dean states pointing to the bucket. Castiel again goes wide-eyed, he looks like he’s about to cry again. Dean takes the bottle away. “It’s polite to say thank you when someone gives you something,” He says sternly.
The nurse just shrugs again and leaves Sam with his meal. Sam rips the food into little pieces and pushes it around so it’ll look like he ate it. "Do you have an eating disorder?" Someone asks from the doorway. He looks up and sighs. It’s that Gadreel again!
Castiel lays on the floor waiting for Dean to return. He's too scared to move. The door opens again and slams shut. "Up" he hears Dean's order. The young teen pulls himself up onto the bed. Sitting hurts, it hurts so much. He wants to cry again...he feels like such a baby. He hates himself, he hates everything his life has become. When Cas realizes the items in Dean's hands are a first aid kit and a toolbox he panics. He knows from movies that hardware tools can be used to torture people.
The teen is pulled from his fantasy by the doorknob turning. Dean was there in the doorway with buckets of water in each hand and a white towel bunched up under his arm. The predator looks pissed. Cas' spaced out bliss is replaced with complete horror as Dean stalks towards him. "I got kicked out of the hospital. I'm not allowed back," He states coldly, putting down the buckets of water and towel. Dean wipes the cloth over the teen's face roughly, dumping the water over Cas' face. The boy sputters and coughs through his gag, panicking. Dean smirks. So waterboarding works to bring his pet back to the real world. He doesn't stop until both buckets are empty.
Sam sighs then sip at his smoothie. He moans as the burst of flavor hits his tongue. What the fuck was he doing, he needs to get out of here.
Cas wipes his face and coughs roughly again. The more he thinks about Sam the warmer he feels for the older boy. Sam is the only comfort he has. Sam is really his only hope of surviving this hell and getting home to his parents.
Sam looks up at Dean with a smile on his face. Dean smiles back. Then something occurs to Dean. He should probably to get to work. Someone has to pay the bills and it’s not like he’d let Sammy have anything more than a part-time job. He looks at his watch, yeah it’s 10:30 am he really should be leaving. Dean tucks his soft cock back into his pants, zipping his fly and redoing his belt. He stands up leaving the chair in the middle of the kitchen for Sam to deal with. Sam follows after standing up from his knees. “Come to give your big brother a kiss goodbye,” Dean orders holding his arms open for a hug. Sammy hugs his big brother and Dean hugs back. It will not annoy Dean that Sammy is taller than him but he’s accepted that fact. When hug ends Dean kisses Sam hard on the mouth. “Be good and look after Cas,” Dean orders more sternly then his previous order.
Castiel knows by now there's no getting him to stop whatever he has planned. He looks at the floor, tears flowing freely. "...E-easy way," the boy mumbles.
"Oh fuck!" Dean shouts. Sam locks onto his big brother, hyper focused on the man as he cums down Castiel's throat.
When his food is finished, he gets out of bed. He gets ahold of the rolling stand his IV is connected to. He walks to the nearest nurses station. Sam puts his arm on the counter, tapping his finger on the side to get the nurse's attention. The woman looks up at him. "Can I help you?" She asks, annoyed at Sam’s rudeness. Sam recognizes her as the woman Dean threw his tray yesterday. She has a long sleeve shirt on under her scrubs, likely to cover the bruises.
After what feels like a lifetime Dean finally pulls out and hides his cock away in his jeans again. “Let's get that bullet out, ” the elder brother states with confidence as he redoes his belt and pockets his pistol.
Just before Ketch reached the door he turned to the parents. “Oh, one more thing. Did your son have access to a computer or laptop?”
Sam was enjoying his peace and quiet. He takes Gadreel's number out from his pocket as if on autopilot, he pulls his phone out and types in the number. He can't save it under the man's real name. Sam decides to delete one of the five numbers he has of Bobby. The man has many side gigs and a burner phone for each one. He keeps the name the same and just changes the number to be Gadreel's. He’s just built up the courage to text the number when Dean comes upstairs. Sam quickly scrambles to put his phone away. The elder brother drops a bowl in the sink, then leaves the kitchen without speaking to Sam.
Sam frowns, he's so used to pain that he doesn't feel the prick from the needle at all. "I don't scare easily!”  He decides to answer. Which is also true unless it's Dean. He knows Dean wouldn't hesitate to destroy anyone that hurt him and he's used to pain. This really is nothing.
He slipped his hand between the boy's thighs, stroking the treasure there. He works the teen over until he starts to wake up, then his panic set in. Cas pulled away from Dean in fear.
He lines his dick up doing exactly what he promised Cas he’d do last night. Dean holds him by the hips, not giving a shit about leaving marks. The panicked noises the boy makes turn Dean on more as he pushes into Cas’s body. He starts off slow, partly to prolong the torture but also to avoid hurting his own cock as he pushes in. Damn, but his boy was tight! Castiel grits his teeth and clenches around the invasion, trying in vain to keep Dean out. “Oh, baby you know that’s only gonna make it worse for ya!” Dean states amused. “Now you be a good angel for me and open up...that’s it...nice and wide. Just breath out nice and slow and relax that pretty boy cunt for me. Push out...more...more! That’s it, there ya go. You take all my cock like a good boy...there’s my angel”, Dean crows as his clock slides all the way in at last.  He groans as he bottoms out and his balls touch Cas’s arse. Cas groans as Deans fat cock rubs against his prostate.
Dean looks annoyed, "Well let's see I had to drink burned shitty McDonald’s coffee because the coffee maker is broken. And a certain someone was a complete brat!  Oh, and I had to cook for myself!”
He looks up and his eyes lock with Dean's. There’s a look of arousal and fire in his endless globes of mossy forest green. Biting his lip, he focused on fucking Cas. Sam's gaze pans down when peering, his eyes meet Dean cock and he quickly finds himself fully hard once again. He uses his good hand to brace himself on Cas' hip (he's just copying what his big brother did whenever he fucks him from behind). Sam finally finds himself not struggling at all to stay in the moment.  He just keeps looking at Dean, he doesn't think about anything else.
“You’ll learn even if it has to happen the hard way. You’ll learn to be grateful,” Dean says. He picks up the bottle from the floor and steps over Cas. He walks for the floor and locks it behind him. Dean sighs, Cas needs to train, it’ll take time but it’ll be worth it.
It took a good few minutes before his phone went off again. Sam picks it up. "Well that's very forward for a married man to ask, but to save your curiosity, I'm actually a switch".
Time passes, Cas doesn't know how long. It must’ve been awhile. He's sitting up, Dean's hands were in his hair, the boy looks him in the eyes and blinks slowly. "I thought you fell asleep on me." Dean admits with an annoyance in his voice.
"Please no." The boy pleads weakly, barely audible. Dean easily drags the naked teen over his lap, firmly holding him in place.
Amelia Novak sat on her couch, clutching her son's toy cat in her arms. Her cheeks were wet as she's shown the CCTV footage from the night Castiel went missing. Her poor, sweet son walking home alone at night.  He’d listened to his mom and packed a jacket before leaving for the animal shelter. Amelia was horrified by the idea of her sweet boy all alone and cold.  Now god knows where he was.  Ketch paused the video. "That black 1976 Chevy Impala was seen four times on different cameras before along your son's route. I looked up the license plate, it’s local. The plates have been out of circulation for years. My guess is someone stole the plates or brought them at a yard sale or something similar.  They’ve stuck them on their own car to avoid suspicion,” the man explains.
Claire shrugs. “They were shattered, of course. They thought the situation at school was improving and said Jacob talked about how things were getting better in general at dinner the night before he died.”
“Besides, Sam said we could stay over for a couple of nights. Thought maybe we could have a little reunion.”
“Tell me, what are you seeking? Revelation, guidance or answers? Or maybe comfort, yours are nervous hands, I see.”
Cas doesn’t back off, still a few inches away from Dean when he collapses against Cas’s chest, the tension in his body suddenly gone, leaving him with just a widespread feeling of desperation.
“Oh, come on! Living with me, working with me, serving me her disgusting Scottish dinners every night wasn’t enough. No, that evil hag wasn’t satisfied. She had to
“Yeah, but not for humans. When the angels fell, though, we came across one, he was disoriented, vengeful, unable to understand the depth of human emotions, and so he took down whoever expressed a death wish, no matter how fleeting or shallow.”
“And it is for me? Dude, I keep losing my dad, over and over, and whenever I start to resign at the thought that I’ll never see that body again, those arms, that fucking coat, he comes back, and then he’s gone again. But you know what? That’s not even the worst part. The worst part is –” she stops, and Dean finds himself holding his breath. At least he had it coming.
Dean hesitates, but then he meets Cas’ gaze, encouraging and loving, “Oh, fuck it.” he shrugs, joining the slightly out of tune choir as they all sing at the top of their lungs.
There’s a cut in the web wrapped around Dean’s lungs and the gust of fresh air blinds him for a second. “Well, - Cas begins, conclusively, patting the blanket and starting to get up – I should let you sleep.”
“I’m ready!” Jack answers, taking the bowl and the glass from the table, which proceed to fall from his hands the moment Kaia screams “Surprise birthday boy!” from behind Jack’s back.
Before Dean can stop them, tears are rolling down his cheeks, not just tears, but sobs too, violently shaking his chest. If it’s all another cruel dream, he can’t be bothered to care.
“Goodnight, Cas.” And it’s too late, he probably can’t hear him anymore, but it’s the priceless sensation of having his name in his mouth without any hurt or regret overcoming him.
“You’re right, Cas. I don’t see a way out, but this is not why we are here. Well, not exactly, at least. – as he breaths in, Dean considers bailing out, he could change the subject or maybe jump in the lake and never come back to the surface, but he can’t,
The two hug tightly, Claire almost throws herself into his open arms. “I missed you so much.” He hears her cry against the fabric of Cas’ coat. “I did too, more than you can imagine.”
“I’ll walk, you take the car if you want.” He turns around almost immediately, but he still has the time to see the annoyed look on Claire’s face turn into a worried frown, one he knows very well.
“When I say that I wasn’t expecting to come back, I mean that I never thought there would be a later for us. So please, don’t feel like you owe me anything, it was never my intention to make things weird or tense between us.”
“Goodnight.” Cas says, as he turns around and heads towards the stairs, leaving Dean standing alone in the living room.
Dean can’t be sure, but Cas’ eyes gleam with a brightness that, deprived of his angelic powers, only tears could cause. “That would be nice.”
“Hold on!” Dean stops him, his lungs burning inside his ribcage. “If you find him and he decides to stay there, could you please tell him –”
“Dean, you barely let Sam drive it. You were clearly out of it when you said I could take it, so I thought it’d be wiser not to.”
It takes him a few more deep breaths than he originally planned to get the words out, “What we had before was nice, I thought maybe we could try to fix this, if you can forgive me.”
Dean has been cutting his hair every few weeks since he was a child, a mechanical gesture he enacts mostly without thinking. But during the last few months, when he could hardly leave his bed, let alone reach the sink and fix his appearance, his hair had grown quite a bit, his beard too, to the point where he could barely recognize the image staring back at him in the mirror. He doesn’t tell that to Claire, though. “Maybe I should.”
“I know.” He answers, more to himself than to Claire, who is already chatting with Jack on the other side of the room.
“What’s up? What’s keeping you awake?” Dean signs him to come sit next to him on the couch. He sits up a bit, curling up his legs enough to leave some space to Cas, who hesitantly joins him.
Dean chuckles, trying to buy himself time. “It’s been — it’s been hard, man. It’s taking a lot to get myself back on my feet.”
“No, no, no — stay with me, Dean. What am I gonna tell them? God, what am I gonna tell them, you son of a bitch?”
“I’ll go as FBI. Maybe you could try to say you are a friend of the boy, Jacob, talk to his parents and see if he – if he was suicidal. I’ll wait for you on the scene.”
“Then tell me.” Cas persists and quickly what used to be anger turns into frustration, sadness veiling him with a smooth trick of the hand.
“Please, kid. Give me five hours. Go get some sleep, watch a movie. I’ll take care of the body and be back by sunrise.”
Jody gently places a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “This is your chance to finally be happy, truly happy.” She says, proceeding to press a soft kiss against his hair.
“Right, I’m sorry.” Disappointment causes a sting at the back of his neck, but he tries to keep as much of a neutral expression as he can manage.
