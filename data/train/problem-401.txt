“You know how very little self-restraint I usually exercise, John.  Count yourself lucky that I didn’t do so months ago when the urge first struck.”  And then Sherlock was gone.
and then
Sherlock suppresses the panic threatening to rise in his throat and says, “You don’t have to leave.  She can live here.”
Sherlock, never one to allow someone to comfort him, just seems more frustrated.  “But am I someone you want around your daughter?”
And Mrs. Hudson steps into the foyer, perfectly fine because John is gloriously, wondrously alive, and says, “John, back for a visit?” as if she doesn’t realize that John is there for Sherlock, to be his.
John rolls his eyes, sidesteps the implication as best he can.  “Usually on the sofa, when he sleeps at all.”
Since he was a boy, a voice in some part of Sherlock’s brain has narrated his life back to him, rephrasing his movements, adding adjectives and adverbs to his actions. More and more of late, that voice has spoken itself as letters composed to John.
“I would,” the officer contradicts him. “You’re lucky I’m keeping you from the inevitable tox screen.”
“You may,” John says.  He’s smiling when Sherlock’s lips ghost over his.
Harry smiles.  “I’d like that.”
Sherlock spends long hours teaching Annabeth’s small hands to manipulate a bow, complaining occasionally over her head that John won’t allow her to learn anything more useful, such as (gruesome) criminal behavior or (dangerous) chemistry.
He suspects the answer, but he reserves judgment just yet. If his suspicions are correct, they require a solution, but he tries to put it out of his mind. He succeeds only in driving himself to spend a night playing the violin, eyes shut tight against the stash box lying beside John’s letter on the counter.
Sherlock hates himself -- suddenly, strongly. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Yes, John had been a bit heavier, a bit grayer-haired in the years between their meeting and the night Lestrade called Sherlock to the scene of John’s death, but the scarf, how many men wore a scarf like that with such worn trainers? Even after such an abrupt rejection, John was still wearing the damn scarf Sherlock gave him. There were motivations there that Sherlock didn’t quite understand, sentimentality and affection, but he had considered learning them once.
John sits on the sofa beside Sherlock, and Sherlock watches him curiously over the violin.  “You’re not a sociopath,” John tells him, “or a psychopath or whatever else.”
dating again?  Congratulations.”
Sherlock looks pained, but he balances the violin on the cushion between them and gestures to encompass their surroundings.  “I want more of this.  I want you and Annabeth and these too tight quarters.  I’d like to be permitted to touch and kiss you as the mood strikes, though I must admit that I do not yet know for certain which forms that touching may take.  It may be more or less than what would make you comfortable in a relationship.”
he scrawls, shaken, before heading up to his flat for some much-needed tea.
“Oh,” John says, and he is smiling and looks just a bit exasperated as he pulls Sherlock back down to the bed. “Of course.”
“I’m never letting her out of my sight again,” John says, not caring how impossible that would be.  “She was so excited to start school, and we haven’t heard from him in a year.”  He shakes his head.  “I never thought.  And Sherlock must have thought she would be safe, too.  He would never have let her go otherwise.”
John corrects. He feels ridiculous, ducking in and out of his door on a winter evening, irritating Mrs. Hudson, who told him last time he spent an evening this way that she would charge him a larger share of the heating costs if he did it again.
And that is when he notices that Sherlock is brooding, his violin tucked under his chin, his jaw clenched.
The tension is high, and Annabeth glares at Sherlock right until the moment something clicks and she says, “Oh, of course.”  Sherlock waits, and she says, “Well, obviously two girls can date if two boys can, and you two go on dates all the time.”
- He stops himself mid-scrawl. He’s wasting precious time.
He realizes that Lestrade has been speaking to him. “I solved that last case I consulted you on.”
“You were one once, too, John.  I have photographic evidence.”  She shakes her head.  “So, where does your flatmate sleep?  With you?”
-- and then the door opens, and with it, Sherlock’s eyes, and there is John with an almost embarrassed look on his face, an apology already on his lips for coming inside without knocking.
John starts to laugh, and he barely manages to reign it in before it turns from a scoffing chuckle into something more hysterical.  “I’m almost as scared of losing him as I am of losing her,” he admits.  “Does that make me a terrible father?”
“Who’s the name on the card?” she asks as soon as John steps into the room.  “I don’t know it, but it starts with a big letter and it says ‘from,’ so it must be a name.”
He reads the notes on the way to the crime scene, and he rereads them once he determines the order in which they were written.
No other letters arrive, though John checks every day until he leaves Baker Street. He writes to Harry instead, who seems endlessly grateful to have her brother back, though she questions his chosen mode of communication. He reminds her that she was the one to suggest letters in the first place.
A waiter brings a candle to the table, distracting Sherlock from his careful watch out the window. He is a little resentful that he must be putting off these obvious signals, that everyone here tonight who knows him at all is waiting to see who could possibly have turned Sherlock sideways like this.
“He must really like Sherlock if he sent
.  “And before you worry about our tight quarters, the child can have my bedroom.”
, and yet we’re having this conversation.  With you two, I’m not convinced it matters.”
“I do think so,” John agrees.  He takes a breath.  “Not that this is important right now, but before he left, he kissed me.”
“You’re a smart little girl,” Sherlock tells her another day.  He has just spent the better part of the afternoon staring at her while she and John watched cartoons.
And Sherlock nodded, then leaned forward and pressed his lips to John’s.  It was a quick, dry kiss, and then Sherlock was across the room and in the doorway before John could ask, “What the hell?”
“I would also like to share your bed, at least in a literal fashion.”
“I told you that you’re getting quite the reputation,” Lestrade tells him. “I’m going for coffee, and if you’re not here when I get back, I’ll have you arrested. I don’t imagine you’ll make it far without passing out anyway.” And with that, Lestrade is out the door, leaving John to face an angry man who just happens to be the younger self of the best friend he’s made in all his months in London.
“So you’ll be staying,” Sherlock says briskly. “Don’t bother to answer, I already know that you’ve let your lease lapse. You have,” and here he pauses, looks John up and down, “four days to vacate your flat.”
It’s news to him that he hasn’t been serious enough about Sarah, and whatever deficiencies he may have as a partner aren’t due to his preferences, as she seems to be suggesting. But they may very well have something to do with Sherlock, he decides, who makes him laugh and robs his breath in words, never mind by his presence, his eyes so clear.
Sherlock scoffs and strides across the room to sprawl in the chair beside the bed.  He is watching John and Annabeth with an intensity in his gaze that makes John want to blush, crazily.  He remembers the kiss, though it feels like forever ago now.
John looks up from his half-packed suitcase to where Sherlock is standing in the doorway to John’s bedroom.  “This is no place for a child.  Body parts in the kitchen and sword fights in the sitting room.”
No no no.
“I know,” John interrupts. He holds back a sigh.
“Yes, you do,” Annabeth argues.  “Mrs. Hudson sits for me so you two can go on dates.  And have grown-up time.  I think that’s what she called it.”
“He did, dear. He was killed a short time later. A mugging. He fought back, of course, being a soldier and all, but.” She wipes at her eyes.
John watches Sherlock’s hands.  “You kissed me the other day.”
“I imagine I don’t want to know what happened to our eggs?” John asks.
John doesn’t know whether he’s projecting or whether, perhaps, Sherlock is as lonely and troubled as John sometimes reads between the lines of his letters.
he promises.
“I love you,” he says against her hair.  “You know that, I hope.”
“John.” It’s all Sherlock can think to say, and he’s pulling John to him in a crushing embrace, and he doesn’t know which of them is more surprised.
“Of course,” John says.
“Annabeth,” Sherlock says, almost sharply, “don’t ask questions to which the answers should be obvious.”
The folded paper disappears through the mail slot. Sherlock has never prayed like this, not even when his own life was in danger. He is vaguely aware that Mrs. Hudson has thrown her hands up at his odd behavior and gone back to her reminiscence, her door closed behind her, but all he can see, eyes closed, is John’s broken form. And that body that had been John’s, that had touched Sherlock with such longing, bore no wedding band that night nor any other sign of being loved. John hadn’t moved on, hadn’t found another, and Sherlock feels more than he’s ever known, loss and regret heavy in his chest, he feels as if he could howl with it, and
“You’re being simple,” Sherlock says, but he doesn’t argue further.  The song changes to something a bit faster.  “Why did you say that we need to talk?”
She smiles through the sadness. “I lost a dear friend on this night two years ago. The young man who lived in this apartment before you, actually.”
“I care about the both of you, you idiot.”
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” John says helplessly, and Sherlock nods as if that were any kind of real answer, and John presses his forehead to the uninjured side of Sherlock’s own, breathes in a scent that has long since faded from his scarf. He is surprised and grateful that Sherlock is allowing this invasion. He wonders whether drugs aren’t playing a role after all, or perhaps Sherlock can somehow feel what John feels.
and he does so almost numbly, with no real expectation of results.
“Correct.”  Sherlock’s hand trails along John’s bare arm before he follows Annabeth into the hallway, and John drifts back to sleep listening to the sounds of his family reciting prime numbers in the kitchen.
John smiles grimly and fishes a pen from his jacket pocket.
Sherlock rips the nearest piece of paper he can find, Mrs. Hudson’s calendar, and folds it over, writes John’s name, marks it as an urgent message to be read as soon as possible. On the inside, he writes,
“Given the alternative, I don’t see that I can reasonably refuse.”
“John,” Sarah begins. She seems to stop, reconsider, try again. “You understand that in this office--”
, and that’s not something he’s going to examine more closely at the moment.
Time passes, and he still stops by occasionally to ask Mrs. Hudson whether any letters have arrived for him. She tells him to trust the royal mail to forward things properly, but she never seems to really mind the company, and she serves him tea and biscuits without complaint or disclaimer now that he no longer lives there. It’s not what he wanted in his wilder hopes, but it’s a comfortable enough life he’s building. It’s more than many men manage in the wake of war, his doctor tells him. John tries to let that be enough. He stops asking after the letters.
“I don’t,” Sherlock says seriously. He tilts John’s chin up and kisses him, more skillfully this time. “I have other plans.”
He’s not even sure what he’s writing, but he feels stupid and hurt, and he regrets the words almost as soon as they’re out of his hand. He drinks two beers too many and falls asleep on the sofa waiting for the inevitable response.
“Why bother?  Will it flatter you, to inevitably deny Sherlock Holmes after he bares his soul?”
“Whyever not?” Sherlock asks, genuinely confused.  “Mrs. Hudson is more than capable of babysitting.”
“You’re dating a
“Absolutely,” John says immediately.
John’s pretty sure it’s a sign of mental imbalance -- of which he has been all too frequently accused of late -- that he is actually entertaining the possibility that he is communicating with a total stranger two years in the future via the magic mail slot on the door of his new flat. He certainly won’t be mentioning this at next week’s session.
He feels his heart rate increase. “You said that he left.”
But one evening he’s chatting on the phone with Harry, who sounds sober and hopeful, and she says that it’s hard to believe that it’s been two years since Clara left her, two years since John came home from Afghanistan. “A lot has happened, Johnny,” she says, and he thinks that she doesn’t even know everything there is to tell. And then he realizes, all in a rush: that he moved into 221B just after he returned, that Sherlock’s first letter was just after that. If he’s been back two years, then Sherlock should be at the flat by now. He could go to him, make him understand: John never meant to let him down.
“I’ll get used to him someday,” Harry says briskly, forcing a smile.  More quietly, to John, she adds, “No need to upset Annabeth right now.”
But when he gets inside after dinner with Sarah, he finds, on the back of a page ripped from an anatomy text, an accusatory
He feels a bit giddy, which is probably not the best way to approach this particular patient, who has absolutely no idea who he is. He takes a breath, tries to calm his heart. “Can I take a look?”
She takes his hand and holds on, though he tenses at the contact.  “He’ll do everything he can.  He loves her.”
Somehow, she turns the whole thing around on him and secures an invitation to 221B, where she carefully appraises Annabeth’s bedroom, the white desk and matching bookshelf already filled to bursting, the pink blankets and butterflies on the wall.
“She brought most of it with her,” John half-defends and half-admits.  “What do I know about decorating a child’s room?”
And he does.  John can tell, in moments, such as when he joins them for breakfast one morning to find Sherlock’s long fingers French braiding Annabeth’s hair while he instructs her, “The peach jam on your father’s toast.  The raspberry seeds hurt his teeth.”
* the end.
John nods.  “And she’s good with him, which is an even bigger challenge.”
John simply smiles and shakes his head. “Five days if you count what’s left of today.”
“She’s already so behind,” Sherlock frets occasionally, when she is asleep.  “I would never forgive myself if she turned out to be ordinary.”
“I’m not--” he begins.
Regardless, she is about to ruin everything.
“I most certainly did not.  No doubt she’s heard similar conversations countless times.”
“You’re much too--” He hesitates, then settles on “--talented to be using drugs, Sherlock.”
“‘Our daughter’?” John had repeated, because it was easier to fixate on these details.
“Yes, it is.”  Sherlock is staring at John again, though mostly at his mouth.  “I would like to kiss you again now, if I may.”
“Not in front of her,” John said, holding Sherlock’s gaze, “not if you can help it.”
Sherlock scoffs aloud for the fourteenth time that morning since finding the scrap of paper on the careful pile of mail Mrs. Hudson left outside his door. “Really, John?” he says aloud, pushing away the still uneaten toast Mrs. Hudson had also left him, just this once. “Magic?”
“You two do argue an awful lot,” Annabeth confirms.
John blinks several times, steps outside to scan the seemingly deserted street, checks his phone to be sure he isn’t losing time, then shrugs.
“Sherlock’s brother,” John says, before Sherlock can answer.  Annabeth has already come face-to-face with one of Sherlock’s nemeses today, and she doesn’t need the fright of thinking she’s holding a gift from another.
John sighs.  “What’s upset you so badly since supper?”
he writes back.
“Excuse me,” John tries to interject.
John knows by now that Sherlock himself barely sleeps -- and that night, John doesn’t sleep much either.
John feels somehow defeated. All he can think to write is
Family is important for a child, John decides.  Or maybe he’s just being cowardly and planning ahead for the day when he’s going to want a woman to explain certain things to Annabeth.  Or maybe he has been reminded all over again that life can be too short.  Whatever the reason, John calls Harry to arrange a lunch date.
Sherlock writes, not quite surprising John by being on the same wavelength.
Sherlock shuts the door quietly, stands tall, and walks resolutely up the stairs.
Sherlock does, forces himself to take that step back. John and Mrs. Hudson greet, and she offers them tea, asks how they know one another. Later, Sherlock won’t remember John’s answer, nor how John politely declines. But he will remember exactly how beautiful John looks after he closes the door behind them and breathes and says, “Well then.” And Sherlock puts a hand on either side of his face, eyes burning, and drinks John in, gaze catching more and more frequently on John’s lips until John finally says, “Yes, Sherlock” and “I’ve only been waiting two bloody years,” and Sherlock presses his lips to John’s, unpracticed but not unsure, and fists his hands in that ridiculous, blessed scarf.
. He goes days without one at times, when Sherlock deigns to take a case or falls into one of his moods. John isn’t entirely sure what sparks these times or exactly what they consist of, just that Sherlock will occasionally begin a letter with something like,
“There are no such things,” John insists.
say something mean,” John says.
John reasons,
He waits, feeling ridiculous -- Sherlock’s note could have been hours ago -- but sure enough, a near-immediate reply:
“No,” John says.  “No.  I’m helping Sherlock with his work those evenings.”  He looks to Sherlock for help, but Sherlock has chosen this moment to keep mum.  “You know that.”
“Sherlock?” John repeats, and the man in the chair finally turns to look at John. “Sherlock Holmes?”
“Yes, John?”
“‘Arch nemeses,’” Sherlock corrects.
“Yes, John, in every practical sense!  She slept in my arms on the sofa last time she had an ear infection, and you’re utterly hopeless when it comes to buying her clothes that fit her properly, as if it’s not perfectly simple to determine the measurements of a person you see every single day.”  Sherlock’s entire demeanor changed in a moment, and he knelt in front of John’s chair.  “I’m going to kill him this time, John.”
“He’s no mastermind,” Sherlock declares, “nor a practiced killer. He required three blows to subdue his victim, despite the element of surprise and the victim’s physical disadvantage. Sloppy. Probably a junkie looking for a fix.” He meets Lestrade’s eyes, just for a moment, then looks away. “There’s nothing of interest here.”
All John can do is wait.  He’s under watch by Lestrade’s orders, and he has already failed twice to slip past the officers watching the door.  Another hour has gone by, the tea Lestrade brought him long since gone cold, when Harry is escorted in.
John has had his experience stitching up the belligerent wounded, so he takes a breath and pushes open the door to his office. A tall, thin man is sitting with gauze pressed to his head, glaring at the officer standing against the far wall. “You wouldn’t,” the man says, glaring, barely sparing a glance a John as he enters.
"I should spank you," John teased, purposely just loud enough as they arrived at their destination, the conversation up to that point not properly reaching anyone else's ears. After getting Margie settled, he graciously held Sherlock's chair for him as Marceline arrived and took a seat to John's left, sandwiching him between his old and new paramour.
"Please stop saying that."
"I need a shower." He got to his feet and pulled his bottoms up before retrieving his dressing gown as John watched from a sitting position that had his knees drawn up to his chest. He looked like a photograph or a painting, nude but covered precisely by his positioning, hair wild. He pulled John by the hand to his feet and made a great show of looking him over appreciatively whilst helping him back on with his soiled work out clothes, forcing John's eyes back to his face whenever he would look away, embarrassed by something on which Sherlock's eyes lingered.
"Firstly for you to unhand that gun you have in the back of your waistband. Contrary to popular belief, I am not a danger to you."
"Sh... you're named for me." He seemed awestruck.
John would avoid bringing the subject up for as long as possible, not even dropping hints as others would. But if he figured out how Sherlock non-consciously acquiesced to almost everything whilst he looked at him during kissing, all was lost. He'd already have a difficult time not giving John his heart's desire now, as it was.
"You've a name for her yet?"
"I don't have to." That statement, an echo of one in the beginning of their relationship, also talking about important emotional definitions, sobered them immensely. "There's also something else I'm not," John continued quickly.
John's whole, perfectly compact body seemed to cry out
It did nothing for their current situation however. Despite reminding him a thousand times, Sherlock hadn't brought his charger and John's had a differently shaped plug.
"Did I?"
"They don't need you at the surgery today, if you don't feel like going in. Which is just as well. There's an obligation I must fulfill for Mycroft and it promises to be perfectly boring. At least if you're there, I'll have someone to talk to." John took up his phone at this point and began scrolling through it as if he'd be able to tell how Sherlock once again circumnavigated not only his password, but his fingerprint identification. He gave up almost immediately and just checked other messages, glancing intermittently over at his flatmate who was going through his own phone.
But John was still... confused? Yes. Sherlock had actually seen this look on his friend several times, and not just in his mind's eye. Of course John would never do anything about it. Despite his ability to acquire it, he wasn't really one for casual sex as a personal choice. Sherlock knew John wasn't gay, but, according to some of the things he saw when he was bored and alone and hacked John's private journal, out there, in the middle of all that war, dividers were broken down. They had to be, because whenever they rose again, so did other problems. The easiest thing for everyone was to, whenever and however they could manage, eliminate them for a brief moment's peace. Whether it was a cigar and whisky saturated card game with people that possibly didn't speak the same language, or an orgasm at the hands(or mouth)of a living, breathing person other than one's self.
"Who? Margie? Of course not."
John was good at kissing him in order to shut him up. Sherlock wondered if he'd ever do that at a crime scene when he thought he was being too rude. He made a mental note to test it one day, the last coherent thought before he lost himself once again in John.
"Hello, Papa."
"Good thing it's a light colour." The last couple of buttons were still fastened over Sherlock's lower belly and abdomen, cock so hard it hovered over it, but pre-ejaculate connecting the head to a little pool on it with a gossamer string.
"John, my legs..." He still had them folded under him as he lay back flat with the weight of his
Three thrusts that nearly choked him and a fervent shout of, "
"In this endeavor," he began, running another agitated hand through his hair as John absently stroked the back of his right hand which was now flat on the bed, "I found allies in the most unexpected places. Or rather I saw the... the emotional truth rather than just fact. You were there. All the time. No matter how cruel I was to you, no matter how much trouble you got into because of me, no matter how you worried and shouted, you never left. Not permanently."
"Sorry?"
it. He needed to hear it. He decided to let his heart lead him further for a split second as it hadn't yet gone horribly wrong when he did it before.
"Right," John nodded, and washed it again anyway before he began tearing up leaves of spinach and kale. Sherlock was rapt as John pushed a strawberry in his mouth to be held between his teeth as he picked the stems off of others and tossed them into the container with the greens. He continued his bite in order to be able to ask, "Have you used that spoon in the drainer since this morning?" Sherlock was having a lot more trouble than necessary taking his eyes off of the bit of strawberry juice beading on John's bottom lip. Only his name, called in a sharp tone, brought words back to him.
"Alright, fine!" He said sharply, then sighed. "But you'll have to... restrain me." It was almost a squeak at the end and he cleared his throat. So many possibilities.
"Please." With yet another great, heaving sigh, he returned, avoiding looking into Sherlock's face. Sherlock shut the door behind him and locked it before leaning against it, watching John look out of the sitting room's right hand window. "I... I don't know how else to do things," he admitted. John turned at that but still didn't look at him. "I need data, information, concrete facts."
"Who's weirder, the weirdo or the one who chooses to spend all of his time with him?" He almost had him there. Only it wasn't exactly a choice. Sherlock seemed to get into one's life through the smallest chink, then slowly begin to expand until he filled every corner of it. A few years ago, it would have annoyed him. Maybe. All that mattered, however, was the here and now and, in the here and now, it was just part of their odd, yet incredibly well-running relationship. The image of Sherlock being shagged while swearing popped involuntarily into John's head and refused to go away. He was only able to bury it. For science.
"To be fair, you're rather intoxicated, John."
"Please tell me you wore pants in bed," John begged somewhat bashfully, feeling the heat in his cheeks as he stared at an old message then switched to a mindless game app. It was the only other thing he could handle at the moment.
the background checks. I get information on everyone we interact with on a regular basis, with random background checks on anyone else, even if we stop at a lunch truck. That means business papers, employees personal lives, everything until I'm satisfied. If you even look at me like I'm being too paranoid, then you can go fuck yourself, Mycroft Holmes, because my number one priority is keeping my family safe at any cost." The other two were outright laughing now despite knowing John was dead serious.
"We all agreed a private introduction was in order first," Sherlock said, never taking his eyes off of the child. John couldn't argue with the logic. Their little affectionate display probably embarrassed him beyond measure. There was no telling the emotions Willa would invoke. Sherlock shut the door and moved in front of the little one, back straight, hands clasped behind it in a painfully familiar way. Then he squatted, cleared his throat and looked straight into large, darker eyes. "Hello. I am your father... Your... other father..."
His oddly attractive face fell when they got in and situated, however, as if he'd just remembered whatever was making him withdraw before. John briefly lay the back of the fingers of his dominant left hand on one of those impressive cheekbones, in order to cause the least amount of discomfort for everyone involved, yet still express how very much he cared about the answer to his question,
"Right."
"I... didn't want you to feel obligated by sexual expectations," he debated. "As I said, it wasn't simply a means to an end. Well, not
"I'll run you one before I go down and see if I can use Mrs. Hudson's so that-" Sherlock was looming over him before he finished what he was saying.
He left the blender roaring on its highest setting and rushed to Sherlock, only having to bend a little to get a look at his face. In the gently commanding way he had, John begged him to let him see, asking if something hit him somehow or if he'd been getting these headaches often, etc. Sherlock couldn't get the words out that it wasn't actually a headache when John was pressing cool fingers to his temples, stroking the brow bone, standing so close and smelling like-
"Johnlock," he stated clearly but quietly, infusing a bit of his former captain's rank as he'd done at Baskerville ages ago. It didn't help Sherlock's inconvenient yearnings in the least.
"If it wasn't for love, we wouldn't have found each other. We wouldn't have this, now. I would never not want this. Truth be told, I never thought I could have it. Especially after Mary." They gazed at each other and Sherlock pressed his lips to John's forehead and held him closely for a moment. "I suppose this means I owe love a debt, if for no other reason than it keeps us in business." John closed his eyes and sighed, awash once again in that brilliant combination of irritation and pure love that permeated every aspect of their relationship. He went on his way with a light smack to Sherlock's backside, as his husband-to-be went to deal with the little one so John could wash and dress.
"Besides," he added, "what worth having isn't difficult?"
At Sherlock's request, they returned to the mural, especially the In Memoriam section. As they stood there, in a way similar to that of when John was preparing something in the kitchen, Sherlock guessed what killed them based on what little information he'd been given.
Especially when they danced.
John had taken his underwear off but the vest remained and Sherlock was a bit sorry for it. He didn't know if he was more expressive now or if John could just read him better now that they had become involved in yet another way, because John explained after looking down at him for a moment(touching his face in the gentlest manner making Sherlock virtually purr inwardly).
"Look at you two in your own little world," Marceline broke in as they chuckled at John's allusion to Sherlock's premeditated murder. "It's so lovely." It really was. John had suddenly realised he was actually
The concrete was uncomfortably hard.
"Tell me when to stop," Sherlock breathed into the skin of his neck, his words basting it before he went back for another taste.
"Yes. She is." After a quiet look across the table at each other, he burst into a second round of laughter, Sherlock properly joining in this time.
"For science," Sherlock repeated as if it were a toast. It officially became one when they decided on a finger or two of a lovely single malt just after that.
"I'm angry because I told you a hundred times to... you know what? Just turn around!"
bullet wound alone. It looked like a tiny meteor crater, the flesh around it pushed up and out of the very pink center by the impact. But now wasn't the time for detailed exploration. Sherlock put a pin in it, after spending a moment unabashedly tasting it. He then spent long minutes on his delectable neck and chest, getting the exact right pressure and swipe to make John groan in blatantly building pleasure.
"I believe, however, I've just made that clear."
"That's not saying much."
Sherlock jumped to obey before his body even knew what it was doing.
"You can't actually believe that?"
. To be fair, Willa was really fucking cute. Cute enough to melt The Iceman, apparently.
"But make you smile and smell good."
"Fine," was all he replied before bolting to his feet and marching into his bedroom, leaning back up against the door after resolutely shutting it.
"I... I don't want anything from you," he said warily. "Any of you."
"Also you ran home and, if you recall, I never actually saw you today," he said in a way that was matter-of-fact, but would no doubt be interpreted as rude. John was now taking off his brand new blue and white trainers and socks.
At precisely the right moment, Sherlock pulled with his fingers and mouth, flicked his tongue and finger tips, and, with a curse and strange combination of a whisper and a moan of his name, there it was. He'd gotten John over the edge, bucking his rather lovely hips so that Sherlock had to move his face back to avoid choking. He just couldn't bear to be separated from John's delectable skin, and so set to work kissing his way back up until he could gather his new lover to him. John clutched at him, squeezed him, shaking so hard it rattled his teeth. Words and kisses poured directly from Sherlock's heart in an unstoppable manner, denoting how exquisite John was, how beautiful, how clever and good he was. If it had been anyone else, if they had been much further into their relationship, he wouldn't have hesitated in preparing and plunging himself inside John to the hilt or, more likely, vice-versa, and been finished way too quickly with the image of how he looked whilst in the throws of orgasm forever burned into his mind.
"I said I'm fine!"
And love.
"Feeling better?" he asked in a bright tone that belied his obvious embarrassment. His ears and the nape of his neck were red. Sherlock never wanted that, for John to feel awkward around him. Especially after what had just transpired. It seemed obvious it turned into much more than it was meant to be at the start.
"I'm all set," Sherlock said with one of his rather enigmatic smirks. "Alright. What works best is a sort of massaging motion, similar to tickling. I'm going to skip the usual foreplay."
"Sherlock!" John noted that Sherlock had said it in the same strange manner in which he called him beautiful earlier. It wasn't that it made him uncomfortable exactly, just... uncertain. And, no matter how often he didn't understand Sherlock, he was always sure about the fact that the man knew where he wanted to be, what he wanted to convey. It just didn't often coincide with social norms and that was okay. John didn't much care for the ambiguity of some of his thoughts since this began. Even though they weren't exactly unfamiliar...
"You shouldn't cry, daddy. Unless you have happy tears," she said matter-of-factly, causing another brief, surprised expression on Mycroft's face at which John just shrugged. Was it really unexpected that the child was naturally observant, that she possessed a vocabulary way beyond her years? That she held a the compassion of someone much more wisened? She literally got the best of them. "Put me down please, Uncle." Mycroft complied in a manner John had never seen before. John shook himself out of shock, out of the sudden flash of a three and a half year-old Sherlock ordering a nearly eleven year-old Mycroft about. It was... heartwarming. But, routine, wherever possible, was key in a situation such as this.
"Leave the tea and go!" he blurted, looking away in an attempt to salvage his sanity. John looked as if he was about to, laying the little round tray down on his bedside table, with the addition of a lunch meat sandwich anyway, but he doubled back again and sat next to him. Sherlock was nearly vibrating with the effort of controlling himself.
"OH!" He swooped out of the room leaving Lestrade behind with his frightened expression.
"What?"
"And you just happened to be scaling the building outside my window?"
"I'm so glad we could amuse you," Sherlock used his most acidic tone in the face of Lestrade enjoying this entire thing way too much. That stopped the copper's laughing, replacing it with an expression that would have been adequately contrite if there wasn't lingering amusement in his eyes.
"You're not helping," Sherlock scolded with a grim countenance as he knew his own scolding from John was imminent. Willa looked him square in the eyes for a moment, the room utterly silent, before reaching up and gently squeezing Sherlock's nose between her little thumb and forefinger.
As they lay together, at last drained and bathed in their excretions and emissions, John found himself exhausted, and not just because of their activities. It was full dark and he wasn't aware how much time had passed other than it had to have been several hours. He was sore in places he had little familiarity with being so, and aching pleasantly in others. It wasn't just physical, however. No matter what happened after this moment, everything negative in his life right then was gone. He bore no burdens, had no fears, wanted for nothing. The way Sherlock lay drowsing in his arms as John stroked his temple with the fingertips of his right hand spoke of his experiencing something similar.
"What?" John exited the bathroom where he'd been on an extensive search to make sure he'd retrieved all of the toiletries, complimentary or otherwise from the vast area. He'd already packed the robes, as Sherlock told him they were also gratis with the rooms. On the large flat screen over the fireplace that could be seen from space if one squinted, John saw clearly what Sherlock was talking about.
Between making sure he was fully prepared to sit difficult exams and vouchers, John's mother, raising two hot-headed kids on her own, had to fight for every penny to send him to Kingsbury, so he never took it for granted. "Smarter than most of the teachers, he was," John commented proudly, imagining the greatest possibility.
"You were so relieved," Sherlock contested, tone uncharacteristically unsure. John couldn't help but slip his right arm around the narrow waist and use his left to direct those eyes back to his. They only lighted a few times, returning to their uncertain route around the room.
"For you. I'm not afraid of you, Sherlock. No, I'm afraid
"I'm not digging a fire pit in which to roast a pig to serve at our wedding feast. What's your obsession with pigs all of the sudden?" Sherlock was quiet for a moment after that.
"What, really?" In the afterglow, his ire was temporarily displaced. "I haven't come that hard that fast since I was a teen-ager." Sherlock shrugged rather narrow shoulders, padded by that large, heavy coat, licking his fingers before going into the glove box for some wet wipes he'd apparently stowed in there.
"You're not going to stay?" John's countenance went from cheeky to apologetic.
weren't going to initiate anything. The tension was starting to affect you negatively."
"Am I not good looking enough for you yet?" John teased, just as Sherlock was lifting his collar and wrapping a strip of black material around the back of John's neck over it. Sherlock stopped dead still and stared into his eyes assessingly.
"What..." He almost didn't want to know, like when Sherlock would come home with a box of something from which there was sometimes movement or sound. But, in for a penny... "What exactly... what does it do?"
In other words, all was as it should be.
"Where's my gun? I'll even bury you at your old headstone. No one will suspect a thing, and even if they do, there's not a jury in the world that'll convict me."
"Yes, Daddy?" There was the slightest lisp. Sherlock struggled with one in his childhood. She was currently examining her uncle's green and black diagonally striped tie.
"He's not... angry with me?"
"I did." John sighed, angry at the potential re-emergence of tears currently clogging his throat. He tried to clear them away.
"Like?" Sherlock couldn't help his eye roll. Clearly John's mind wasn't functioning properly, which means the kiss must have worked, but it didn't give the scientist the immediate results he expected. His friend was usually so straight forward about his thoughts when it came to him.
Incredibly tight heat, swallowing his cock whole.
He pulled back completely, sitting back against the opposite door, breathing deeply.
John attempted to throw himself into the farce even more, to see if that helped. He clutched Sherlock's hand and pointed out what had changed and what remained the same since he'd been a student and joked around more with old sports mates who had done well for themselves in high-paying positions in which a lot of exotic travel was involved. As a precaution, he was much more gentle with Sherlock, as he worked out whether or not he had reason to. Sherlock returned the soft, rather chaste kisses and touches, but demonstrated how not fooled he was when he pulled the ex-soldier aside to ask what was wrong. John was reluctant to answer at first, merely shrugging. Sherlock tugged him behind a tree and leaned back against it, placing a hand on either side of John's jaw to pull him close. John fell much farther into the kiss than he'd planned, but that was the underlying theme to everything he did with Sherlock. No matter what limits he set on how far he'd go, John always ended up in much deeper than anticipated, and strangely not sorry for it, given his current reservations.
"Please."
"For what it's worth, John, you didn't seem at all... not ready." John couldn't help his grin at the rare straightforward praise.
Sherlock reached out without looking, grasping the edge of his tee shirt wherever it had been tossed, and dragged it over to clean off John's hand, which rested in the pool of the mess he'd made, some of it having even reached his chin. John was good enough to lick that off and, if he hadn't already
"You've already done whatever you planned to do in there for now," John said with raised eyebrows and a playful smirk. Before the sun was even up fully, they both were, in the carnal sense, before John's half day at the surgery.
"How you two became engaged. I'll need a good romance story to remind me why I still... love my husband through all of this shite!" He glanced at Sherlock who, upon returning from whatever tasks he'd been set to, was designated as her hand hold. He squatted behind her after removing his own fine jacket and supported her leaning back between his knees as he sat on the back of the sofa, the distressed woman attempting to break both of his hands in her grips. Sherlock first shook his head against mentioning the fact that the mother and father weren't together at the moment, then nodded giving the green light for the engagement story John so drunkenly created. After having her switch to a position where she kneeled so that she could lay forward on the sofa, John began telling what Sherlock would consider a more embellished tale of how he'd actually proposed the night before with his dog tags. In actuality, all he did was leave out exactly when it took place, the fact of their intoxication, and that it was all a charade. John had told his genuine heart at the time, or rather what he would feel if it had been real; how very much he felt for Sherlock and wanted to express it in every way possible.
Even those were diminished significantly enough by Willa's pure light. She got all sorts of attention anyway for her personality alone, but add the Holmes resemblance and name and apparently there wasn't enough that could be done to please her. Apparently the Holmes family had once owned the entire area, but kept relinquishing bits of it to people that had served them, local businesses and other community facilities. They were the closest to royalty most of these people ever got for generations, some members actual royalty if one went far enough into their history. Sherlock didn't care for a title himself, though he apparently maintained one, unbeknownst to most, but his offspring was to be recognized as much as possible as the leader of men she would no doubt be. John told Sherlock, not until she was at least twenty-five. She would probably be mature enough to handle it then. Sherlock gave him that annoying '
They had made sure to take seats at a table that was practically in the corner, moving their chairs so close together, it was almost like they were isolated, despite being at a table full of people including Marceline and Jessica. Assigned seats were no longer required after that first evening, and Marceline and Jess were given first choice of places of honour because of their proximity to John and Sherlock during the dramatic birth of little Sian Mackey. When the speeches were over, they remained seated, sharing a plate with their heads close. At the moment, Sherlock was in a rare mood, teasing John mercilessly.
"Sherlocksexual," he finally answered.
particular conundrum. "If you can somehow find a physical demonstration that you are actually in love with me, the way anyone can be in love with someone, then I will immediately consent to marry you." He was quiet and still for a long moment. "Look, Sherlock, I know you care in your own way, and I've made it enough."
, pushed up on the balls of his socked feet, wrapping his arms around his neck, enveloping him in everything that was 'John' as far as was possible without being inside him. And that thought immediately caused the latch Sherlock had used to lock away the part about John being so incredibly arousing so that he could have a normal conversation with him, to break spectacularly, the desire bursting free and running rampant with little he could do to stop it, only confine it to a large room. Barely.
"But you haven't done it all night."
"I can't do all the Yard's work for them," Sherlock protested.
"Oh! I've been informed that usually a token of betrothal is given to the bride to be," Sherlock said getting fluidly to his feet. John recoiled as if startled and bolted to standing himself.
"Yes," he said finally. "Another night safe." Sealing it with a kiss to her brow, john rolled onto his back for a stretch and nearly jumped out of his skin, simultaneously bundling Willa most of the way to the floor on the other side of the bed before registering that it was Sherlock, sitting in the arm chair which he had turned to face the bed rather than the window. He was dressed as usual, his white button up flawless, black jacket and trousers a second skin.
He didn't close his eyes until John closed his, which was long seconds into the kiss. It was everything; everything John had just consumed including parts of his soul, honey and fruit, and veg, and finally, and yes. When Sherlock pulled back a bit to assess him, John's eyes remained closed tightly. Sherlock reached up to lightly stroke the dear face hovering above him. John was thinking that so much needed to be discussed before they went here, but Sherlock knew already. "Don't," he murmured, kissing one eye, then the other. "I promise I won't go any further than you wish."
"And false self-diagnosis."
He couldn't think of anything to do or say, his mind sheathed in a fog of emotion. This is why he hated caring! He swore under his breath and departed abruptly, not slamming the door even though he really wanted to, as it would affect the pies. He took his frustrations out on his own bedroom door, however, slamming it repeatedly then flopping onto his bed to rub his eyes. That didn't go well. He bloody
"Every time." That's what it was. John had heard The Sound when he shouldn't have been able to in a room full of chatting people.
"We don't even have to do anything until then. I do like a challenge and, frankly getting my re-emerging libido back under strict control after you've so thoroughly agitated it, I-" John not only swallowed his words, he didn't even stop until Sherlock was somehow spilling into his clever hand. John had never even touched him there before that, and Sherlock didn't even realize what was happening until it was already happening, as he sucked a mark into the crook of John's neck, and clasped him tightly and sounded for all the world like if he had lasted just a few minutes more, they would have been in bed.
Yes he was lazy, but only with things that were boring. Paying the bills, cleaning the flat, and...
"Touché." But Mycroft continued to stand where he was for a few more long moments.
"You'll change your mind. You find my romantic affection unbearable." He put his hand under John's chin, causing the desired effect of lifting his eyes.
"Then go do a study at a university's psychology department." John glanced at him momentarily, then back at the mirror above the fireplace. "It's like with weapons. The ones who have the least knowledge about them are most likely to hurt people." Perfect analogy, of course. "Germany is still tops in the field of psychology," John continued, heading toward the kitchen, presumably to escape that way. "I assume that's one of the fourteen languages you speak. If not, you could probably learn it in an hour-" Sherlock of course blocked John's path. In as much of a non-threatening manner as possible.
"Revealing how you feel."
"Sherlock." The warning tone accompanied by the pause in John's stroking was almost enough to have him confessing to things that had naught to do with the conversation if he'd just please
"Yes, but this is important. It's not something that can be forgiven if done incorrectly."
There was a bit of a fumble, of the scraping of shoe against upholstery as Sherlock quickly gathered his gangly limbs into the back seat. John watched him a moment, dodging said limbs before sighing and opening the car door to get out and walk the three or four steps to the back door from which Sherlock's long, expensively shod feet spilled when it was opened. He quickly pulled them in, gathering himself back against the opposite side. John crawled between sharply jointed knees, looking every bit the predator he was and, with one knee between Sherlock's thighs and his right foot on the floor, he pushed both of Sherlock's arms above his head, easily looping the metal cuffs through the fixed handle there and clasping the bracelets about both bony wrists.
"Why not?"
"Sherlock, that's not how it's done. You can't just..." John turned to look up at him, that great fondness bleeding into his exasperated expression. "That just isn't it."
"We're apparently already a convincing couple," he retorted, noting the slight lisp Sherlock always got when overtired or otherwise mentally altered as he did so.
"Have you ever ridden in a helicopter, Willa?" Her large eyes got impossibly bigger, shining with anticipatory glee. John secured her coat, a mini-version of her Papa's she demanded he have made as soon as she was old enough to form the words. John had to learn how to sew. Then he shrugged on his own overcoat, the comfortable Haversack that had always served him well, and sighed deeply, organizing his thoughts into how he meant to react to keep Willa feeling comfortable after depositing her into the chair Mycroft had vacated.
For God's sake, he could smell him.
"I made sure to get in just in time for this," she explained.
"It's the truth, Sherlock." He absently kissed the top of his head, Sherlock's hair still silken and smelling of a hint of shampoo combined with a light scent of clean sweat. He then lifted it in his hands so he could have Sherlock's full attention, cradling the pretty package that contained that precious mind. "But even then, if it worked out that you were patient enough and I survived long enough, I would take you back. As long as there is something left in me, I will always take you back. However I can get you. Staying away would mean my certain dea-"
"Well when you put it like that..."
"Sherlock, I'm not- Look, if you really want to come, then we'll go. It'll be a... social experiment if nothing else." And possibly a reason not to stay long if it wasn't going well.
"Between that and the... prom-themed dance we'll have a few hours of free time, during which I've booked us appointments in the spa. We're going to be seen as spoiling each other."
"So I did a bit of research and called in a few favours... et voila."
mummy upset, now, can we?" With a relieved nod he informed John that, as their few bags were already perpetually packed due to always having to be ready to go at a moment's notice, that he should gather anything he deemed otherwise important and get the child dressed. They were to meet everyone at their childhood home. "How did you- you know what? Never mind. Honeybee?"
"Just no bullshit, Sherlock. Okay? Just say words and don't worry about how they sound."
"Because it's fine. It really is."
Sherlock continued to kiss him, apologising briefly for the mark and handing him several tissues with which to clean his hand. He then trailed his mouth back over the area, licking gently, some basic part of his brain almost joyful at his claim being visible. He pushed his hand up under John's top, trailing his fingertips lightly along one of the many thin scars on the skin of his side due to their adventuring. It was a knife wound, much deeper than John had indicated at the time, yet it only seemed to make John angrier at his attacker. The assailant had caught Sherlock off guard and laid him out. Sherlock had had to masturbate for the first time in several months to the memory of John 'accidentally' breaking the combatant's arm and blaming it on inadequate calcium intake. The goosebumps that rose then mirrored the ones on John now, indicative of what his nipples were probably doing. A graze of those same fingers confirmed it, the re-emergence of John's erotic sounds encouraging.
"I promise not to ask again until I've come up with a solution," he declared. "When the proof is found, I will show it to you and you can decide whether to accept or reject me. What do you think?"
"It is now."
The elder Holmeses cooed over her little outfit and laughed over her no-tie explanation even through giving the two men in question dirty looks about the fact that even a girl who was practically an infant knew they should get along better. From the little John saw of their exchanges they actually did. Mycroft indicated that there had to be a discussion regarding their future and it seemed to be a code phrase, for his parents rose and started to leave the room to the panicked expressions of John and Sherlock both.
"John!" Sherlock almost gasped, visibly hard even by the dim light of the dash.
Just like that, control of it was taken from him. He and Mycroft watched from the door as the chopper landed neatly several yards away, whipping even his neatly clipped hair around. Then, gracefully but with all eagerness as the craft hadn't even set down fully yet, a long, lithe figure disembarked, walking quickly toward us. John couldn't move, couldn't breathe, could only clench and unclench his fists as the man came closer, seemingly not exclusively on his own power. A smaller, broader body hurried behind at nearly a run, silver where the former was black, stocky where the the first stretched for miles, and, John knew, though he couldn't immediately see, a bit olive skinned where the other was fair.
"I just said why and anyway, I'm sure you have
"More wine, ladies?" John quickly offered. "Another fruit juice or water for you, Margie?"
Sherlock was concerned.
Sherlock seemed to take a split second to reboot before scrambling to do as he was told.
"Of course it is! The divorce statistics alone..." John finally turned to face him squarely. Sherlock's imperious look faltered a moment, his face softening in the wake of John's unhappy moue and defensive body language. "But our union won't end that way."
"Wait no," John said. "She's not going to a boarding school no matter how prominent it is. If she's going to have 'connections' they'll be of her own personality's making. I'm sure you could arrange a playdate with little Prince George in a couple of years or something." The only difference in Mycroft's countenance was his raised eyebrows. "We're supposed to be family, but don't think I need to be financially dependent on you. I would make use of your connections, however to make sure she and Sherlock are safe and I don't give a fuck what you may have to say against it." He was deathly quiet, assessing John's every bodily twitch. Sherlock and Lestrade were snickering like schoolboys.
"The way you're moving, you're still trying to hide how much you're aching. Therefore you must have done some sparring," he noted. "So what did you learn?"
"Please, John. I won't go any further without your express permission, but know that I very much want to. Please. My John, my Darling, please?" This new development, accompanied by his special pet name purred, octopus-like pawing, and sensuous feline-ish licking in areas seemingly designated for maximum convincing power pushed him right over the edge of the hedonism he couldn't quite bring himself to feel guilty about in the moment.
John met his fervor kiss for kiss, devouring his mouth in the same manner without hesitation. He had no idea how this orgasm was as strong as the others without knocking him unconscious. He carefully helped John wash after and watched him dry off and wrap the towel around his hips before rinsing Sherlock's hair for him and beginning to drain the tub so that he could finish whilst he checked on the stew he smelled. He must have brought it up from Mrs. Hudson's when he was asleep. John came back into the room and immediately took over the ointment application, complete with a brief but effective massage that nearly put him down again but for the unbelievable arousal. But John wouldn't give in this time, praising his virulence, but insisting on boring things like eating. Sherlock's lean belly rumbled loudly even as he protested.
"Doesn't it just? The next day, we... have... John, what are you doing?" John had sat back up, pushed the papers and bag off the bed, plucked Sherlock's phone from his long-lithe fingers, and put it gently aside on the bedside table, before straddling his lap.
"Make me." The only thing he could do, the only thing he knew Sherlock couldn't resist, was his bared throat. The first time, when this particular weakness was discovered, Sherlock explained it in some sort of scientific way which basically boiled down to that he was ecstatic that John demonstrated complete trust in him again. John wrestled open the top two buttons of his shirt that showed above the V neck of his warm, cashmere pullover in deep blue that Sherlock had desperately gifted him that day in lieu of one of his regular jumpers.  He then leaned his head back and turned it toward the window.
Oh God, the begging.
"Sh." He briefly lay his jaw against John's temple then walked forward, hand at the small of John's back. His prominent eyebrows raised up into the curls on his forehead at the feel of John's trusty Browning in it's standard place. John only had time for a quick grin before wiping his face, and tried his best to gather words and carriage at least adequate for the occasion. By the time the proud grandparents were reached by the adults, Willa had been passed to her grandfather and Violet Vernet Holmes stood with her hands clasped in front of her, every bit as stately as her sons. It's where they got it from.
It wasn't the usual way John smelled in Summer, a slight undertone of clean sweat with the straightforward toiletries he preferred to use on his body and hair. He'd been engaged in some sort of strenuous exercise. It wasn't body odor per-se, more like his blood was still up, his skin, the Summer sun having painted it with a light golden sheen when he'd begun helping Sherlock with experiments on the roof as soon as the season came in(some part of his therapy), was probably flushed slightly pink. John's eyes were probably flashing sapphires, as they often seemed to darken when he was in this state. But his smell was the worst thing, because it seemed to contain some sort of pheromone Sherlock had yet to isolate. Or build an immunity to.
"You know this isn't my area." Lestrade rested the file on the desk and pondered the subject, pursing and un-pursing his lips, then swiveling his chair around to look thoughtfully into the air toward the cracked open window. Summer was nearly upon them and a mild breeze made it pleasant to work in there with only a suit jacket on.
"Just needed to take the edge off," John explained, going over to the full-length mirror to make sure his hair sat correctly and ribbons were straight on his chest. Sherlock had somehow talked him into getting permission  to wear his uniform, an allowance that was expedited thanks to a certain sibling. He could barely squeeze into it when they started, but exercise on top of the rigorous activity of solving cases had tightened him up a bit in all the right places. He had the rare pleasure of catching Sherlock staring at him through their mirrored reflections. He knew it was unintentional because Sherlock hurriedly snatched his eyes back to his cuffs and jacket hem. "Ready, Babe?" John offered his arm. Sherlock threaded his through and allowed himself to be lead down to the hall in which the introduction dinner was taking place.
. One moment John was pretending to care if he lived or died by at least having a conversation about a flat share with an old university mate he happened to run into during one of his self-inflicted constitutionals, the next, he was running the streets of London,
As soon as he saw that door however, John figured out what that little scrap of disinclination was. Fear. He found himself mildly terrified that once they'd properly entered their flat, all would be revealed as still a sham, and Sherlock just added the last bit about actually wanting him to make it more real so that John wouldn't give up on it and start pulling away too early. As usual, Sherlock took only the bag he'd kept with him inside the cab(containing the mysterious package), leaving the several others as well as the driver payment to him as he unlocked the door and went in saying something about how Mrs. Hudson wasn't in. John watched him disappear by increments up the first ten steps of the seventeen that led to the sitting room and kitchen doors and he could at first only stand there taking deep breaths.
"You told me about a younger man you met in the pub two nights ago. Mentioned some regrets over how fit you used to be. Not difficult to assume you'd discussed his regime and, as you love a good bargain judging by your almost comical fashion sense, there had to have been a military discount for you to even consider it. The closing factor for you was that the place is frequented and staffed by military personnel. You were right at home."
"So... your legal name is William?"
"Yes!" He grabbed the tousled raven head in his hands. "Yes I accept your marriage proposal, you infuriating, beautiful man!" He nodded and sighed, allowing John to kiss his nose.
"When did we get an Instagram... and all these others?" Dozens of notification icons, some the same, some different, marched across the top of the lock screen. When he swiped it open, previews of the notifications popped up along with the related icons.
Waking with his face buried in the pretty, dark, slightly sweaty coils of his baby girl in a strange place wasn't anything new to John. Being naked but for a pair of pants instead of in night time attire that could double as daytime attire in case they had to move quickly, was. The slight ache of his muscles being pleasant and the feeling that he could possibly sleep for hours yet was completely different.
"Right. Just clarifying."
"Mm." Sherlock agreed, briefly raising his eyebrows at his mobile screen before pushing his arm around John's shoulders and snapping a photo of them with their temples resting on each other, John unable to help smiling. Especially when the second one was with Sherlock's lips pressed to where his head had been the moment before, in the natural full sunlight streaming through the picture window. They made a rather handsome couple, if he did say so himself. And he did. Sherlock only smirked and got back to the business of making their relationship look as real as possible to the masses. John attempted to enjoy the interaction without getting pulled into the artifice himself. It was becoming increasingly difficult as time went on. As Sherlock switched to his laptop, John's own phone, which he hadn't remembered plugging in to charge, vibrated. He looked at it.
"Well you did almost shoot me that time."
, but he had to let John set the pace if he didn't want to mess this up right at the start. This was too precious. John was too precious.
"I don't think it's getting in the way," John stated thoughtfully. "I define myself as 'not gay'. My sister's the gay one."
) despite the warning look in them. "I have to finish the egg whites part so I can get these in the oven before they go flat or Mrs. Hudson will have my head." Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and John all chuckled but it didn't mean that John wasn't dead serious. Sherlock's grumbling was only in part so as not to arouse suspicion. Observing John was truly interesting and he was quickly sucked into the distraction. He watched John's expression as he patiently folded in the whipped egg whites and concentrated on pouring out the required amount going by a little mark made deliberately in the flour of the cake tins and crust of the pie ones. Sherlock looked his fill of his arse bent over to pop all four in the lower oven together(they'd gotten Mrs. Hudson a fancy new one last Christmas, the better to feed them up). John then straightened and turned to him, peeling off his asinine reindeer puppet oven mitts with an, "I'm all yours."
"Yep," John nodded slowly. Too fast would have made the room spin, yet holding onto Sherlock's head, staring into his remarkably jeweled eyes, grounded him and made it worse all at once. "You are the most brilliant, clever, beautiful hearted man I've ever known. If you consent to be my husband, I'll swear on anything you hold dear to spend the rest of my life, trying as hard as I can to be worthy of you."
"My point is," Sherlock drawled, rolling his eyes, "I had to give you up to save your lives. All of you. And when I returned to everyone pretty much getting on with it, I just... didn't know."
"What do you mean 'neutralized'?"
"I'll always mean it. Whether it's sarcastic or angry or any number of tones, I will always... mean it." With another sweet kiss, John lay his head back down. "I would mean it when we were undercover," he said without his mind's consent. "In the past." The perfect creature didn't bat an eye.
"Pardon?"
Having obviously passed from fantasy to reality, they had the time he needed now, and Sherlock seemed prepared to at least attempt to be patient. As he lay there on the floor contemplating how much Sherlock always jumbled everything up, the subject of his racing thoughts drained the tub a bit and refilled it with more hot. There was a knock at the door and John was immediately on his feet. The newly-formed couple then donned the thick complimentary dressing gowns and went to go see who it was. Sherlock pressed John's pistol into his shooting hand, which he kept behind his back and opened the door with his left. A hotel worker barely out of boyhood requested entry behind a trolley similar to the one they'd used for breakfast. With a pleasant greeting, John stepped aside for him to enter, keeping his back away, Sherlock at his left shoulder now.
"I... I didn't think you were... the marrying type."
"Oh! I've made all sorts of social media pages for us. We also have a wedding planning site. Thinking about going through with it for the Bugatti Vera alone."
They slept for hours, waking only for the toilet and subsequently when they absolutely had to eat. John climbed onto the bed with a search of take-away places pulled up on his phone. Sherlock feigned sleep as John softly called his name between dustings of kisses. He didn't pretend very well, as an unwitting smile appeared when John nuzzled a certain spot on his neck.
experienced a most spectacular orgasm, he would have been ready to go again, no matter how long a second one would take. He could hardly help the little breathy moan that escaped him when John did so. Sherlock chuckled a little bit as their breathing regulated, finding it difficult to stop kissing him until John did so first, dropping his head onto his shoulder.
"N-not sexually, no! I mean, not that you're under any obligation to say yes to marriage now, but-" At least John initiated this time, severely cushioning the blow of his subsequent sudden departure.
He told Lestrade in order to hurry the process along. John was nothing if not inspirational and, right now, Sherlock was running low on that. But asking his lover incessantly how to prove himself would probably annoy his oft-irritated... boyfriend? Is that what he was now? He'd have to work out what they'd call themselves at a later date.
"Is your objection to the definition general or... personal?" Sherlock looked back at the mirror, nervously tapping long, pale fingers covered in tiny scars and callouses from his various professional and private pursuits.
"Perhaps I've tricked you into thinking so." John touched his face and he could hold the facade no longer. "I have to try."
The fastening of one side immediately cut his thoughts short. He'd absently been instructing John on how specifically to use them, to loop the rope through the ring so that he was sat up a bit. Thank God he didn't straddle him to do this because his hips definitely had a mind of their own, the pillow thankfully staying in place but only because it was probably impaled at this point despite his pants. Catching on to what he'd wanted, for whatever reason, only served to make things worse, his anticipation of Sherlock's needs. He tested his bonds and found he was comfortable but couldn't escape without a plan, and all of his plan making juice was south of the boarder at the moment.
Beneath him, John's extreme arousal was beginning to fade into anxiety. He wouldn't meet Sherlock's eyes for very long, and his breathing was calming. That was until Sherlock began peppering the wound with soft, reverent kisses. At first, John's breathing had stopped altogether, then began increasing in depth and speed, interspersed with words and sounds as Sherlock traced his tongue along it, following the cobbled pathways to his neck, down over his nipple. Sherlock was attempting to compare the sensitivity of the two pebbled peaks, to see if the left was more or less sensitive due to the injury, but got sidetracked by how loud John cried out no matter which one he gave attention to. When it was both at once with dampened fingertips so Sherlock could watch his face in the throws of ecstasy, Sherlock was erect again, John grinding up against him threatening to come.
"So?" It was John's turn to narrow his eyes in minor frustration with the person to whom he was speaking not understanding him. Turns out, he didn't actually understand. "You don't have to be gay or straight anymore. There are a plethora of sexualities that exist between zero and six on the Kinsey Scale. Besides, you know who you are, John Watson, despite the fact that you often let others' definition of you get in the way."
"You were... they had you..." He grabbed John then, held him tightly to him, unable to stop the pathetic tears, the weak-willed sobbing into the worn cloth of his dressing gown, the one the same colours as his eyes. He had alight blue button up on, one that Sherlock had bought him a long time ago, but no trousers. Sherlock breathed deeply the scent of him, the grooming products he used, his particular brand of gun oil, the tea he was consummately British about making... He buried his face between John's neck and shoulder and he held him too and let him, hushing him with the same pain-ravaged voice as earlier.
"Christmas. I was going to have a photo taken including everyone and print it out immediately on photo paper, then gift you a frame in which to put it." John's eyes went contemplative, his lovely thin were lips wet, then wet again by his tongue, but Sherlock couldn't stop talking, despite not knowing whether or not it was a good thing. He knew the present would be perfect but now the data was all jumbled, the timeline off. "Then, I planned to lure you under the mistletoe under perfectly believable false pretenses and... reveal my feelings then." John bolted to his feet, nearly knocking the chair over but didn't face him yet.
