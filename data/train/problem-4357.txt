She made a beeline for him once their eyes met across the crowded terminal, and they hugged awkwardly in greeting.
bad, right?" Dean was trying to play it off as a joke, but he was both concerned about Cas and worried about his performance.
about it, but then I assumed that you wouldn't want me to make a big deal out of because you didn't seem that keen on the idea."
"That's my name, don't wear it out," Dean quipped as he circled his hips, ass rubbing against the bulge in Cas's pants.
Charlie looked him over thoughtfully.  "I know we don't really know each other all that well yet, so tell me to shut up if I'm sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong, but... what exactly happened to you?  If you don't mind me asking?"
As he jerked himself off, Cas enjoyed the feeling of Dean rubbing against his ass.  He wanted more, but this was more than he'd had in
"He used to make me coffee every morning," Dean reminisced fondly with a sad, lopsided smile.  "I don't think that he liked how much I...
"I feel like I've missed out on so much," Castiel declared wistfully.  "It's exciting to catch up on, but every time I try something new ten new things follow it."
," he emphasised.  "It's me who should be apologising."  He took a breath, building himself up to say what he knew he had to before he chickened out.  "What I said this morning about me being drunk and it being a mistake, that's bullshit.  I wasn't drunk, and I don't know what it was."
But Dean didn't have a clue.  Apart from Balthazar, who Dean had no way of getting in contact with and who he doubted would tell him anything even if he could, the only people who might be able to help him were in the Roadhouse and hadn't seen him.
They all turned to look at the customer.  Charlie came to stand in the doorway, curious to see what the problem was.
Opening and closing cupboard doors, he tried to find everything he might need to make himself breakfast.  He put two slices of bread in the toaster, then turned to the coffee pot.  It was different from Dean's - more complicated with a lot more buttons - but after pushing several it finally whirred into life with a
Grateful that it had stopped raining while he'd slept he peered up at street signs, trying to work out where he was.  Choosing a direction he began to walk, hoping that he was heading in the vague direction of somewhere familiar.
"My parents were in a car accident when I was little," Charlie stated, her voice void of emotion.  "My dad died, my mom's... in a coma.  They didn't know, and I have no idea how they'd react if they were still here for me to come out to."
"Once.  It was just the two of us," he said, motioning between himself and Dean.  "We tried to organise a game with some people from work once, but we couldn't find a time when everyone was free.  We need to try and do that again some time," he told Dean.
"Because it wasn't his dad that died!  Because I didn't want to make him uncomfortable!  Because I didn't want him here!
His hands came to a rest on Castiel's waist, still kissing him even as he mentally retreated into himself.
Dean rolled his eyes, and once he got the keys off Gordon drove the car around the block to get a feel for it, but he couldn't see what Gordon was complaining about.  When he got back to Bobby's he drove her into the garage and popped the hood.
?  And then... repress it?  Why would anyone do that?  How fucked up do you have to be to make up a sexual assault?!"
develops technical issues, it's kind of like having a stroke - messages are still getting sent between it and the rest of the car, except they might be a little screwed up.  If anything broken suspension's like... I don't know, having a broken leg.  You might still be able to walk, but...  Look, I'm not saying you
calling him Chuck," Cas pouted, but if he didn't come up with another suggestion soon he had a feeling it was going to stick.
of our business," Castiel said pointedly, leaving them standing at the garage entrance as he continued on into the office.
"Well, I don't know what a Buick looks like, but I think they must have gone because I don't remember seeing anyone parked so inconsiderately."
It was a rhetorical question, but if it hadn't been Castiel couldn't have given him an answer.  At least not one he'd have been willing to give.  He wondered if Dean had even realised he'd spoken aloud.
expenses, with either the insurance for Dean's car or even my own.  But that's wishful thinking, at this point.  It's just so impractical being reliant on Dean or a bus.  It's fine when we're both working at the same place, but the cost of buses will add up."
me!" Dean was sure Sam was close to giving in, but there was a pause before Sam spoke again and Dean could swear Jess was telling Sam not to back down. Bitch.
going to encourage Dean's bad habits.  He would support him, yes.  Hold his head over the toilet.  But he wouldn't let his world shrink down to alcohol, sex, and sleep, as it had in the past.
"Nah, I'm used to it – I have this thing about strange beds, so if I go home with a chick the night before I usually don't get much sleep."
Castiel looked over at Charlie, who was taking photos of Dean's car before fiddling with buttons on her camera.  "Why not?"
"You're not going to make me cluck like a chicken, are you?" Dean asked, narrowing his eyes suspiciously.
"Patience," Dean smiled, moving to retrieve the bag of sweets from a pocket in his jeans.  "The fun's in taking it slow."
Conflicted emotions churned through him, feeling both flattered and uncomfortable at Cas's attention, so he did what he did best - deflected.  "Goes with my perky nipples," he smirked, winking at her.
"You did.  You screamed like a girl," Dean repeated, sounding like he was grinning.  "Everything okay in there?"
When they got home, Dean hovered awkwardly in the corridor as if he was a stranger in his own home.  "Cas, I know what I said this morning... but I'm not really up for anything tonight, okay?"
Cas stood in the office doorway, dripping onto the welcome mat, as Charlie collapsed into giggles behind him.
Castiel stopped arguing as Dean handed his card over to the woman.  A moment later, she handed him his receipt (which he stuffed into his wallet), three tickets (which he entrusted to Ben), and a map of the park (which he handed to Cas).
She smiled at him.  "No.  You can have as many favourite movies as you have room on your DVD shelf, I think.
"You fill a shoebox with things children in poverty might need.  A brush, hair slides, colouring books and crayons, sweets...  Things that will brighten their lives, even just a little.  But also things that will be useful; toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, underwear..."
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. He felt like they'd taken one step forwards and two steps back, and he's not sure exactly why. "Talk to me," Dean urged softly.
"Ha!" he exclaimed when he found what he was looking for.  Then he pulled out a few more for choice.  "Try some of these," he suggested.
...  Never thought I'd settle down.  Tried, 'course.  Lisa.  Fucked that up, didn' I?  'M no good.  Not cut out for domestic shit.  ...  Alone's underrated.  Can't lose what you don't have."
for Cas, whatever it was.  There were so many things he'd wanted to say to him; that he'd been afraid to say, or even admit them to himself.  He'd thought there would be plenty of time to figure it all out.
Maybe Pamela could see his mental defences fortifying, because she turned over to another page in her notebook and suggested playing a game.
She led them over to the back corner and started removing the extra place settings, but was taken off guard when Dean slid into the same side of the booth as Cas.
"You, uh, didn't look surprised earlier," Dean commented, not looking at his boss.  He'd be lying if he said he wasn't seeking some kind of reassurance that Bobby was okay with it despite the impression he got earlier.
But when he heard a small chuckle he peeked through his fingers to see Cas smiling.  "You're not funny, you know," Dean told him when he realised Cas was winding him up.
Castiel immediately changed channels to the news. Dean opened his mouth to protest, but closed it again. He'd said 'whatever you like', and if this was what Castiel liked, then he'd put up with it.
The corner of his mouth raising up in a half-smirk, Dean put the hammer down.  Stepping closer to Cas, he grabbed the man's hips and pulled him into a hug.
"Look at it this way, blame can only be directed in one of two directions:  outward, at those who have hurt you; or inward, at yourself.  Someone's got to be responsible.  If it wasn't Dean's fault, then do you think you did something to make him react in a way that hurt you?"
Santa pulled a page out of his pocket and looked at it.  "Dean Winchester.  I didn't receive a letter from you this year."
?" he asked, eyes wide as he gawked at what he'd thought had been a woman in a big wig and tight dress.
"Cereal, toast... I might be able to rustle up some bacon and eggs, if you—"  He cut off when he noticed that Dean looked a little queasy.
Dean swallowed.  He had meant later, once they'd eaten and he'd had a chance to figure out what the hell he wanted to say.  "I guess it is."
"I..."  He cleared his throat.  "I, um..."  His eyes flicked over to Dean, who held his gaze.  "It's probably nothing," he said, finding his voice.  "But I have been targeted before."
His cheeks had a sprinkling of freckles across high cheekbones, and his eyes crinkled cheerfully.  Damn, the man was beautiful.  Castiel's heart began to race and he automatically glanced behind him for an escape route.  Dean was nowhere to be seen.  He tried to swallow his panic and turned back, folding his hands onto the tacky surface of the bar and studying them intently.
They managed for ten days, living off of frozen leftovers and tinned food, before Castiel was desperate for something fresher.
"This would be the one in the trench coat who's been living in your apartment for, what, six months or so?"
"What?" Dean shrugged.  He was grateful for what he had, and the bit about guarding loved ones from temptation?  He might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but even
Castiel's fingers fisted desperately in Dean's t-shirt, crinkling the fabric. "I don't want to die," he repeated faintly.
Dean rested his hands on Castiel's waist and kissed him.  As expected, Castiel's hands moved to his back, stroking up and down.  He always did that.  He didn't know if it was an instinctive angel thing about wings.  Occasionally he'd drag his nails across Dean's shoulder blades and let out a satisfied chuckle when Dean shuddered.
that hadn't been there before."  Dean swallowed, and the silence between them felt almost... expectant.  He wet his lips.  "Carving pumpkins with you.  Celebrating Christmas together.  The way you're grumpy before your first coffee."
Sam sighed.  "There was a party.  A... A work thing.  We were drinking, I had a few too many, some guys started doing E, and when they asked me I didn't say no."
"You're not one of those people who ruin a good piece of meat by preparing it well done, are you?" Balthazar joked, as Cas cut into his meat.
Dean almost choked on his food, eyes wide with surprise at Cas's actions.  "Did you just throw food at me?"
Castiel nodded. They couldn't live off of takeout forever, but at the moment there wasn't that much in the cupboards.
yellow?  Benny was right; women were easy - give them red roses and they'd be putty in your hands.  Grabbing the two-toned bunch, he stomped back to his car, already regretting wasting good drinking money on flowers that were probably going to be dead by the end of the week.  He chucked them on the passenger seat, where their stems started to leave a little damp patch.
When Dean woke up the next morning, Cas was back on his side of the bed with one arm stretched out and draped across his chest.  It was as if, even in sleep, Castiel wanted to touch him.  He allowed himself a few minutes to look at Cas, before giving him a gentle nudge.
"I can't be here!  I don't belong here," he added more quietly.  "Please, can we go somewhere else?  Or just back home?"
He waited until he thought he might piss himself and when he couldn't hold it in any longer, he cast a furtive look around before staggering down the alleyway at the side of the club.  He'd be able to hear Dean's car if he arrived before he was finished.
Dean read it twice, and his eyes were wet when he finally looked at Castiel.  "Cas," he breathed, trying to hide how choked-up he was getting.
Castiel looked at his watch in surprise, for he hadn't realised it was so late.  "Yes, please," he said, moving towards Balthazar's car.
When Dean looked at him, the light in his eyes had been rekindled.  "Ben?  He's awesome.  You'll love him, Cas, I just know it.  He's a great kid - likes classic rock,
on DVD.  She always asks if I want it for Christmas, but I tell her to save it for my birthday when it's dropped in price a bit."
He found himself stroking a hand through Dean's hair as if it was the most natural thing in the world, and Dean didn't complain.  He actually seemed to like it, if the way his breathing quickly fell into a steady rhythm was any indication.
Right, so there were only three places in the city where strippers worked and Dean knew them all.  He never claimed to be classy.  "I'll see you in a bit."  He hung up and tossed the phone onto the front passenger seat and sighed, before wriggling back into his jeans.
"Mr Winchester, Cas has bruised ribs and a mild concussion so will be kept overnight for observation, but he'll be discharged first thing in the morning."
" he screamed, sinking to his knees and sobbing as he thought bitterly that of course the first words that flew out of his mouth were Dean's regular curse.
"That's okay," she said, even though it was clear she was disappointed.  "I had my chance, and I blew it."  She paused, then added, "Whoever she is, she's really lucky."
Castiel set his cutlery down on his empty plate and settled back in his seat.  From the look of contentment on his face, Dean figured the seafood lasagne had gone down a treat.  He finished off his own dinner, stuffing the last of his steak in his mouth and reaching for his beer.
He knew better than to argue with Gordon - the best way to deal with him was listen to him rant until he ran out of things to say.  Unfortunately Dean was too hot-headed to think before he spoke -
"I'm not a TV, Dean," he said softly. "My feelings can't be turned on and off, or changed at the press of a button."
As Castiel refocused his attention on the newspaper Dean poured his coffee down the sink because it was
"That was hardly drowning!" Dean exclaimed with a laugh.  "You fell over and crawled back to the beach.  It was nothing like that first time when I had to—"  He stopped himself mid-sentence.  "Anyway.  Maybe we ought to get you some water wings?" he teased.
The angel held out a small bag, and Dean groaned in reluctance. "You know you didn't have to get me anything, right?"
As Castiel turned his attention back to Chuck Norris, Dean promised himself that he would say whatever Pamela wanted him to, and
Ellen glanced at Bobby, who was now red-faced and brushing flakes of pastry out of his beard.  "I just thought you hard-working men - and woman," she added, when Charlie cleared her throat loudly, "could use a treat."
He read through her letter - shorter than expected, given the extra pages she'd included - and said, "Wow."
There was light coming from under the living room door, which meant that the curtains were open, which meant that Castiel was up. He opened the door.
Dean choked on his burger, tears filling his eyes as he struggled to dislodge the half-chewed mass of meat and bread from his throat.  Castiel's hand thumped uselessly across his back as Pamela poured a glass of water and passed it over to him.  Spluttering into the glass as he took several awkward gulps, the food softened slightly and slipped uneasily down his throat.
Castiel sat back in his seat, feeling the waistband of his jeans digging in.  He didn't think he could eat anything else, but if Dean wanted—
Dean stared at him like he was a riddle to work through, the hint of a smile tugging at the corners of his lips.  "Just when I think I've got you figured."
?" Castiel protested, for Dean had been passing judgement all week.  "Just shut the curtains already!"
Dean just stared after her as she returned to the bar, only then noticing that the customer who'd insulted them was no longer there.
Dean shook his head adamantly.  "I don't need time, or space, or any of that crap, okay?  I just need you.  Here."
They made sure Ben went to bed at a reasonable time that night, Cas retreating to Dean's room to wait his turn in the bathroom.  Once Dean was finished and Cas finally stepped under the hot spray, he groaned in pleasure.  The room still smelled faintly of Dean's body wash and, with a smile, Cas reached for that bottle instead of his own.  As he massaged the gel into a lather across his body, he wondered if Dean would notice.  Probably.
Maybe his apprehension showed, because when she turned to him she winked and said, "I promise I'll go easy on you."
"So, what now?" Sam asked, once they'd all pushed their plates aside, stuffed full on Dean's homemade burgers.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, then pushed himself up off the couch and began to pace.
Castiel wished that if he pulled the plug right now, the water would carry him away. When he fell from the bridge he was scared, yes, and he fought to survive, but that was an instinctive reaction. He hadn't quite been prepared – Dean had turned up out of nowhere just as he'd been about to let go. But none of that meant that he didn't want to die anymore.
"Not really.  I'm sure children whose parents are no longer together do it all the time.  And it's not like he'd get off at the wrong stop."
It sounded like Cas was trying to break up with him, and if it wasn't so painfully close to the truth it might have been funny.  "I don't need
Castiel flashed him a small, sad smile. "Sometimes the simple things you take for granted are the luxuries another can't afford."
"I know," Dean sighed.  He swallowed.  "What were you talking about?  Before I came back?  Or didn't you talk?"
"Now you boys aren't going to start a bar fight on me, are you?" Ellen asked, setting three drinks down in front of them.  "Because I'll have you out on your ass sooner than you can cuss me out."
A gentle nudge jolted him from his thoughts.  "You'll be late for work if you sit here staring at a blank TV screen all morning."
Dean spluttered, lost for words.  He'd never known he was into guys in all the time he'd known Bobby.  Hell, he'd turned down quite a few who'd flirted with him in the past.  But then Cas came along... It had taken him weeks of therapy and hypnosis to start getting to grips with his sexuality while his boss had apparently been
Cas unwrapped the boa from his neck, for it it was scratching his skin and tickling his ear.  "Swap?" he joking asked Balthazar.  He wasn't actually surprised when Balthazar agreed, draping the boa gloriously over his shoulders and and shoving his flag into Cas's hand.
- bedroom.  His hand was on the door handle, but he didn't turn it.  He'd promised Dean that he'd give him space if he needed it.  But his experience of therapy, and his instincts as a friend - and boyfriend - were at war with one another as he stood there.  He wanted to ask if Dean was okay, if he needed anything, but he'd promised—
"Dean, I'm glad that you're committing to this - I really am.  But we need to start at the beginning."
"You roll your ball down the lane – but be careful not to put your foot across the line – and you try to aim your ball so it knocks all the pins down.  You get more points the more pins you knock down, and at the end of the game the person with the most points wins.  It's fun."
Castiel shook his head.  "We probably can't afford it, anyway.  I was being selfish.  And what you've done," he gestured to the tree, "is wonderful."
Castiel glanced around while Bobby and Dean glared at each other, aware of the other mechanics trying to look busy as they eavesdropped.
"Why wouldn't I be?  I'm sorting my shit out, I got off for the first time in months, you're still here..."
afraid that Castiel will one day hurt you, so you push him away and tell yourself that he deserves better.  And if you push him too far and he
A small, hopeful smile dared to tug the corners of Dean's mouth upwards, and his hands slipped from the book.  "Yeah?"
Dean's expression hardened and he stopped in the middle of the room.  "What would you know?"  The last thing he needed was his brother patronising him.
"Hey, Chuck," Dean cooed, crouching down beside Cas.  "Do me a favour and shed a little less, yeah?"
"You're brave, and loyal, and kind," Cas told him fiercely.  "And you strive to set a good example for Ben, when you could so easily turn your back on him."  He cupped Dean's face and kissed him passionately.  "I need to remember how lucky I am."
"Fuck off, dude!" Dean snapped, moving to stand beside Cas.  "What - you haven't got a life of your own so you need to mock his?"
- he could talk about Dean with.  Jo knew Dean, Balthazar would probably offer the wrong sort of advice that Cas didn't want to hear - even though he
been better at accepting Castiel's choices lately, and he didn't know the rest of Balthazar's friends
Cas's hand on his arm distracted him for a second, and then he was shoved into a table.  Glasses smashed onto the floor and Jo swore.  "You get off on beating up nice guys?" Dean snapped, wiping blood from his mouth and taking another swing at the sonofabitch who thought he could come into Cas's regular and pick a fight with him.
Dean contemplated Sam's words.  He was starting to open up to Pamela, which meant he was changing for the better.  He'd feel good about it, if it didn't serve to remind him how much catching up he had to do with his brother.
Cas didn't fail to notice the way Balthazar's expression darkened for a moment at the mention of his friend.
He didn't know how long he stood there, a part of him wishing that he'd hear Dean's voice telling him to get in the car.  He wondered what Dean would be thinking right now.  Would he feel disgusted?  Betrayed?  He hoped that at the very least, Dean wouldn't regret saving his life.  It sounded clichéd, but the past couple of months had been the best of his life.
Castiel let out a sound that was a cross between a laugh and a sob, and for a moment Dean thought he was going to cry.
As the last piece of the puzzle dropped into place, Dean slung his arm around Cas's shoulders.  "If you could go back, would you?"
"You mean Rufus?  Grumpy guy?  He's a friend of Bobby's.  Owns a garage way out... somewhere," he said, gesturing vaguely.
"I wasn't in a good place.  I tried to play the part of a dad, and a partner, but the shit—  I mean the, uh,
, yeah," Dean breathed, watching the way Cas's pale pink lips closed around his fingers.  "We've gotta get you doing that on my cock at some point."
"Because sometimes I make observations about things you say or do that I feel might be important to address in the future, or to help me understand where you're at mentally if you're being uncommunicative.  Sometimes people say the most when they say nothing at all."
When Dean was satisfied with his own work, he held the spoon out to Cas, who jabbed it into his pumpkin awkwardly.
That really riled Dean, because no matter how much they'd struggled financially growing up with his dad moving from job to job, and drinking himself to sleep most nights, at least he'd always made sure he and Sammy always had food in their stomachs and clothes on their backs – their
Jo peered at where Cas was pointing and rolled her eyes.  "You don't have to eat everything that has 'pie' in it."
When he had bubbles halfway up to his elbows, he heard unsteady footsteps making their way up the hallway.  He thought that one of his flatmates must have forgotten something, until an unfamiliar voice said, "That smells
As Cas slid a mug into his hand a moment later, Dean wondered - not for the first time - how the hell he'd gotten so lucky with Cas.  When he vocalised his thought, however, Cas just shook his head.
Dean ignored him as he drained the pasta, then tossed it into the pot with the cheese sauce.  "Because my dad worked away a lot," he began as he stirred the pasta through the sauce, "I came up with about a hundred and one different ways to make macaroni and cheese."
anyone else talk to him like that.  You think they, uh..."  He finished his question with a sexual gesture.
"I suppose it's because I feel closer to you here.  You touched me for the first time on this bridge, and you changed my life," Castiel explained.  "You changed
"You don't have an appointment," Cas reminded Dean as he pulled into the carpark a few minutes later.
He didn't know how long Dean would be; if he'd come straight home after Pamela's or drive around for a while.  Go for a drink, maybe.  Or two, or three.  He knew that talking about the stuff that mattered to him wasn't something Dean was comfortable with, and he desperately hoped that his boyfriend wasn't going to take one step forwards and two steps back.
He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands.  Cas had written a list, one time.  Pros and cons.  It had pissed him off a little, but now he wondered if he might have been onto something.
"Dean!" Castiel cried as he just stood there, not sure whether he should help or bury himself back in his pumpkin but feeling like something other than a kitchen mess was wrong.  He just didn't know what it was or what he could do.
He turns to look at Cas, who's rolled off him in the night.  A hand under the covers tells him that yeah, Cas is half hard.  Carefully, he moves down the bed and tugs Cas's jeans and boxers down, causing him to fidget in his sleep - and okay, falling asleep in their clothes makes morning sex less simple than it should be.  Dean licks and sucks Cas to complete hardness, before taking as much in his mouth as he can and humming.
Pamela was looking at him with curious amusement, and if he believed in the supernatural he'd wonder if a part of what made her so good at her job was a psychic ability.
"Unwilling, or unable, to take a compliment," she finished for him.  "Why is it so hard for you to accept it when someone says something positive about you?"
Dean wiped a hand across his eyes.  He was not going to cry, damn it!  "It looks worse than it is, but, uh...  He won't be in for the rest of the week.  At least."
"Perfect sense," she assured him.  "Obviously we have a lot of work to do to get to the root of whatever is causing this, but it is perfectly normal for a person's sexual responses to be blocked until they resolve any past issues that have been ignored or forgotten about."
After all, you don't tell someone that you'd changed the sheets that morning on the first date.  "Not really," he said noncommittally.
She gave him a supportive smile.  "It's good that you can acknowledge that.  You've come a long way in a relatively short space of time - though I suspect a large part of that is because of Dean."
Dean should be up by now.  He lay there and listened, wondering if perhaps Dean was merely eating, or brushing his teeth.  But after five minutes there was still no sound, so reluctantly he threw back the covers, shivering at the sudden drop in temperature.  First he checked the kitchen, then the bathroom.  Finally he stood outside Dean's bedroom door.
being, Cas thought to himself as he stared vacantly at the computer screen.  Dean had been working longer hours sporadically over the past few weeks, but it was the third night that week that Dean had stayed late.  He'd also been going in on his mornings off, and cutting his lunch breaks short.  Cas wondered if it had anything to do with the therapy session that Dean had said had gone well...  Had Dean exaggerated his progress, to reassure him?
Dean licked his lips and stepped out of his jeans so he could turn around without tripping himself up.  Castiel was in front of him when he'd turned full circle.
"And it's good that you can see both sides," she agreed, "but can you remember what we discussed when you told me about your father?"
"It's okay," Dean assured him in a shaky voice, despite the fact his hands were sweating and just itching to take over.  As the oncoming traffic stopped and honked, he carefully instructed Cas.  "Just start it again and move on.  They don't have any patience."
His cheeks flushing slightly, Cas strived to be more specific.  "The gold one Benny towed in the other day."
that – he'd been there when they'd gone shopping.  "Come here," he said, dragging Castiel down the corridor and into his bedroom.
, now.  A better diet and regular meals, plus his habit of jogging in the mornings while Dean was at work, had really improved his figure.
"Oh?" Castiel said innocently.  "Well, that's good.  You'll be able to refuel the car, and we can do a little grocery shopping."
The next morning Dean was surprised to find Cas whistling in the kitchen as he cooked. "Dude, can you keep it down?" he winced.
"I should damn well hope so," Dean smirked.  "But as for Balthazar, are we... are we even dating?  Because I'm pretty sure we haven't been on any dates."
"You're in no fit state to drive, and the walk will do you good."  He dragged Dean in the direction of home until he willingly walked with him.
"No!" Dean hastened to assure him.  He rubbed a hand across the back of his neck.  "I was sort of hoping you'd stay."
"I thought you didn't like him?  That's what Sam said, anyway.  He wouldn't let me play him at our wedding."
"Since I needed a wine for the sauce," Castiel explained, drizzling a creamy white sauce over two pieces of fish.  "And it says it goes well with fish."
Dean held his hands up and sat back. "Whoa, cool it there, it's alright – you don't have to tell me."
"No, it's not that," he said, his hand moving to join the other on the wheel.  "Just...  At lunch, was there something you were going to ask me?"
He'd forgotten Dean had rented a movie for tonight as a 'surprise' for him.  "I...  I'm meeting up with Balthazar tonight," he said quietly as he entered the living room.
Dean isn't helpless, but he feels vulnerable when it happens.  He's beginning to realise that his father's drinking had been his way of dealing with the PTSD, which wasn't viewed in the same light then as it is now.  With Dr Cartwright's counselling, a local AA group, and a lot of support from Cas, Dean is staying sober.
Dean had tried to call his brother before he went to bed the night before, but it had been Jess that answered so he'd had to endure another lecture about being a shit-head brother (his words) and a useless, waste-of-space layabout (her words).  She was a massive pain in Dean's ass, though he was grateful that she'd stood by Sam when he went off the rails for a while.  She'd even forgiven him for the whole Ruby fiasco.  Dean may not get on with her, but he admired that about her – if he was ever in a relationship and his girlfriend cheated on him he honestly doubted if he'd be able to forgive and move on.  Sometimes he'd find himself drinking alone and wondering when his brother was going to grow the balls to pop the question.  Yet even after all Dean had done for Sam during his downward spiral, Jess
"Well, I was..."  Castiel trailed off and clenched his jaw at the realisation that Dean wanted to keep their relationship
Dean takes it without question, then Castiel puts the TV off and leads him upstairs.  His grip on Castiel's hand tightens with every further explosion, but Cas doesn't complain that it hurts.
So he avoided sleep, telling Cas he'd be there in a minute but never following him through.  Sometimes he'd nod off in front of the television, and wake up to the ghosts of hands pinning him in place.  Other times he'd last the night, exhausted by the time he got to work the next day.  Once Cas tried to sit up with him, but eventually his eyelids grew too heavy and he was too tired to argue with Dean, to insist that he came to bed.
Dean laughed.  He'd been too busy freaking out about seeing Cas to think about food up until that point but, now that he thought about it, he was hungry too.
The sound of a pencil scratching on the paper brought his attention back to Cas.  He licked his lips.  His fingers twitched, and then he moved his hand a few inches over to rest on Cas's knee.  Even though Cas didn't move, Dean could feel the shift in his attention.  For a second he contemplated taking it back, but then Castiel shifted and slipped his arm through Dean's before continuing to stare at the book.
"Dean," Cas growled, willing his body not to respond to his boyfriend's actions.  "I can't be late on my first day."
, they don't want to... you know."  He gestured down at Cas who, until he'd spoken, had been doing exactly what he was talking about.
Castiel didn't know what to say to that, for religion had always been a large part of his upbringing. He'd say as much to Dean, except he'd already said too much - he didn't know what had made him tell Dean as much as he had.
, and not being afraid to go after it."  He huffed and shook his head.  "I got side-tracked again, but I kind of came back to what I wanted to say anyway.  I
they were buying items for the church's shoebox campaign, so they would have to make sacrifices elsewhere.  An asterisk marked against several items meant that they were going to buy a cheaper brand than usual, though Dean had refused to compromise on toilet paper.
Castiel cast one final look around Balthazar's home, mentally ticking off a checklist as he did so.  When he was sure he'd done everything he'd came here to do, he stepped outside and locked the door behind him.  It would be another few weeks until Balthazar returned from his summer vacation in France, so Cas had agreed to keep an eye on the house and water the plants.
The Impala pulled up outside their apartment building just as Castiel reached the entrance.  Pausing outside the door so that he and Dean could walk up together, he smiled as his boyfriend stepped out of the car.
"I wanted you to, Dean - for all the wrong reasons."  She shook her head.  "You weren't good for us."
Halloween passed quietly, but then when you lived on the third floor of an apartment building trick-or-treaters tended to be far and few between.  Dean may have encouraged the little menaces to skip them by turning off every single light in the apartment and closing the curtains as early as five o'clock.  The glow from the television screen and the two small candles flickering inside their pumpkins has been all that illuminated the living room as they huddled side by side watching classic scary movies all night, while Dean munched his way through a whole bag of mixed Halloween candy which Castiel had thought was supposed to be for potential trick-or-treaters.
sequel's showing?  If I promise not to make any comments about sex, of course," he added with an awkward, teasing smile.  "And then maybe we could go out.  Perhaps it's time I learned how to play pool."
"Well fine, if you don't feel like sharing with your friends..." she trailed off, pretending to sound hurt.
"I'm sorry I ruined our night!" Dean almost shouts when he's calmer, so he can hear himself about the music.
Sam was watching this silent exchange, his eyes flicking from one to the other, waiting for someone to say the first word. Unfortunately, it was Sam's stomach that broke the silence.
clothes before – being from a cheap, religious family who donated to various charities and lived off the bare minimum, he'd always just inherited his brother's old hand-me-downs.
As Andy poured himself a coffee, he narrowed his eyes and cast a sideways glance at Cas.  "You wouldn't have a bit of a crush on me, would you?"  The smirk that followed his words revealed his teasing.
He stayed silent as Pamela finished writing.  Once she laid her pen down she sucked in a breath, as if preparing to speak, then closed her mouth again.  She pursed her lips and looked thoughtfully at a point above his head, pen tapping against the paper as she considered how best to get her point across.
But Pamela surprised him - again.  She was good at that.  She simply jotted a couple of words down and changed tack.  "Okay.  Your mother, then."
"Yeah, but not nearly as cool as that!  No government agencies or spies, or anything.  Taking a real-world job now and then gets me out of the house, otherwise I'd never see anybody who wasn't delivering groceries or takeout."
"No, I don't mean it like that." Castiel said quickly. "I just meant that I want to be able to pay my own way, without you having to borrow money from your brother so you can afford to keep me."
.  He wanted him to be safe.  He was so close to finishing, but wasn't feeling too excited about revealing his weeks of secret work to Castiel.  Cas had been planning on putting money towards driving lessons for months , only now  with him changing jobs and going back to university to finish his degree he had less money to spend and what he did have was needed for other things.
The next night Dean took Castiel out again, though this time he drove them into unfamiliar territory.  The Impala crawled along the street, allowing Castiel to take in the bright lights of the bars and bright costumes of the patrons.  Everywhere he looked there he could see gaudy shirts, sequins, glitter, and feathers.
Only it wasn't Ellen.  It was Cas.  Dean blinked, confused, as the man in front of him seemed to change.  For a moment, Dean was back in the Roadhouse, and he had that homopohobic piece of shit pressed up against the wall.  Anger, then.  It was anger that held him in its vice-like grip.
It was quiet.  Too quiet.  The background noise he'd become so accustomed to - the music on the radio, the chatter of his colleagues, the clatter of tools - had been replaced by a deafening silence.  Even the background hum of vehicles driving by seemed more muted than normal.
hurt you, Cas," he promised.  "You're like family to me.  And I don't hurt family.  I only hurt the people who hurt my family."
Dean cast a look over at Ellen who had appeared from the back and was frowning at him. "I think so," he admitted.
Dean moved to go, but something about Castiel's demeanour had him turning back.  "Is everything ok?"
"Can I get another beer, please, Jo?" he asked, already reaching for his wallet and thrusting some crumpled ones at her.
And it wasn't long after he'd suggested putting Cas's name on the lease, he realised.  What the hell had he been thinking?  And now they were planning to make it official, when they still hadn't dealt with all of their issues...  This was beginning to seem like a bad idea.
!" as he struggled at a particularly tight junction; and he watched the traffic lights changing so was able to get Cas ready to drive off the second their light turned green.
After a few minutes Jo came over to take their orders.  "I saw you sitting there and thought you'd brought a date before I saw it was Cas you were with!" she laughed, and turned to Cas.  "He only ever takes a booth when he's on a date."
all to go well, for Dean and for Ben.  But he'd be lying if he wasn't also a little afraid.  Afraid that it would go badly, afraid that Dean's response to such an outcome would be be detrimental to the progress he'd made over the past few months.
"I don't...  No.  I have no feelings for Dean except gratitude," he lied.  He didn't know why he felt the need to lie to Father Reynolds, when he could simply tell him that Dean already knew.
Castiel nodded.  "I just don't want you to think I'm taking everything you've done for me for granted."
, yeah, he can be.  But not when it comes to other things - like money, or self-control.  He's a loose canon.  He doesn't
Arriving back at his apartment some time later Dean found himself standing, alone, in the middle of their living room.
Dean got up around three, glancing longingly over at the empty side of his bed before dragging himself out to go and relieve his bursting bladder.  As he washed his hands, he stared at himself in the mirror above the sink.
"You beat up some kids over a stolen watch!  A thirty-three-year-old man!  Beating up some college students!"
"College, obviously.  If I complete my course I can use it to get a better job with a higher wage, and then I can afford the other things I want to do.  But..."
Dean shoved his hands in his pockets, trying to work out how much loose change he had.  "Oh, uh, I don't really—  Yeah, okay, maybe you're right," he said, hastily changing his mind as he met her forceful glare.
Castiel's words resonated with Dean and he placed his hands over Castiel's, which stilled at his touch.  He swallowed.  "Neither do I," he said softly.
"Maybe you should show me where it is," Dean pointed out, and somehow the words sounded like a flirtation.
Castiel nodded.  Bart didn't like him – he'd no doubt sit and glare at Castiel all night – but Zeke was nice.  He reached for one of the pitchers and poured himself a small amount.  Tentatively, he raised the glass to his lips and took a sip.  It wasn't
, he thought to himself wryly.  He needed to stop overthinking things.  He'd never been anything but 100% into chicks, because Rhonda Hurley and her pink satin panties didn't mean anything - right?  But, other than his gender, Cas was exactly the same as every other person he'd ever dated.  Apart from the fact they'd started out as friends.  And that their relationship hadn't started with sex.  Hell, Cas probably knew more about him than anyone who wasn't his brother...
"Wait a minute," Dean said, taking the stairs slower on the way up than he had on the way down.  "I know what this is.  This has something to do with your freaky fetish for serial killers."
He pressed play, and his music started up again.  Blending the vegetable and chilli mixture until it was a smooth, orange-coloured puree, he emptied a carton of passata into a pot (for you can't make
Dean watched his boss leave, feeling slightly unsettled that Bobby had paid enough attention to him to realize that he was happier – he preferred to keep his head down and just get on with things.  He brushed the thought away and popped the hood again, keen to fill his mind with engine parts.
Castiel looked a little confused but otherwise said nothing as Dean got himself sorted then guided them towards the exit.  "What would you like for dinner?" he asked Ben as they made their way back out to the car.
Before he could reply, the manager gave Cas his change.  Ignoring the tip jar, Castiel simply stuffed all his money into his wallet as fast as he could so they could leave all the quicker.
to be Castiel's imagination running wild with want.  Dean had made it perfectly clear that he cared for Cas only as a friend, and yet...  There was a look in his eyes that Castiel hadn't seen before.
Halloween may only have been the day before, but all traces of it had already been scrubbed from the stores.  Everywhere he'd looked there were special offers on Thanksgiving this and Christmas that.  Dean couldn't think of anyone who would need a giant stuffed turkey centerpiece or 135 feet of wrapping paper, even if it was on special at $40 and came packaged with assorted bows and ribbons.  He grunted as he jostled the shopping bags in his arms to free a finger so that he could hit the button for the elevator.  He hadn't meant to be out so long, but the douchebag in the sports car had rear-ended the car in front.  He'd given them the number for Bobby's and had to take a detour out to the supermarket.
"I'm sorry," he said quickly. "I shouldn't have asked. It's just apparent to me that you both still love each other, and I guess I just don't understand how you could both be so prepared to lose that."
Once he'd placed it back on the desk, still in one piece, he took an exaggerated step away from the shelf.  He was pretty sure his clumsiness hadn't gone unnoticed, and he turned around to see if she looked annoyed with him
Dean's mouth opened and closed as he struggled to form words.  Castiel was looking at him so pleadingly that he'd almost -
Dean appeared out of nowhere. "Hey!" he called out, his voice cutting through the bar like a gunshot. "What the fuck is your problem?"
"Well, if you want to take off early, you can.  I'm just saying," he said, in a please-don't-start-a-fight-with-me tone.  Then he walked away.
"Eh, they're not too bad," Dean said.  "A splash of sauce and they'll taste fine.  Ben!  Dinner!"  He turned to Cas.  "Go make sure he moves, please.  And that game thing—"
Castiel might mean it, but Dean knew that he deserved better.  If he could afford it, he'd take Cas to nice places.  He
When they reached the Roadhouse Dean turned to Castiel. "The Harvelles own this place. They're good people," he told him, and walked straight up to the door and hammered his fist on it. "Ellen! Jo! Keys!" he yelled.
Cas moved to the window sill where he was nursing a few pots of fresh herbs back to health.  The price had been reduced as they'd been close to death in the grocery store, but with a bit of water and TLC they'd perked up - the basil was even beginning to flower, Cas noticed as he plucked a few leaves.
Lunging towards the railing with heavy footsteps, he doubled over it to catch his breath.  Below him, the fast-moving water churned; white froth gathering on the surface and quickly being dragged downstream by the strong current.
Dean hugged Cas one last time before going to bed himself, and as Castiel tucked himself in between the sheets he felt completely relaxed and
Dean swallowed.  He had no doubt that Cas meant that now, but later?  "You should get going.  Don't want to be late on your first day."
"Please," he whispered, staring at the ceiling and hoping that God was listening, "just give me this one thing." He knew he had no right to ask God for anything, but Dean's friendship was important to him. "Please."
"I'm sure her offer of a free session still stands," Cas reminded Dean quietly when Dean's thoughts failed to manifest themselves as words, and it seemed like such a pathetic way to end his rant.
!  It's not even a real job – I mean, it's not like you need to be in the office nine to five.  It would just a bit of help."
The journey to the Roadhouse was uneventful, and Cas spent it alternating between staring out the window and casting sideways glances at Dean.  He couldn't help but wonder what it was that had clearly gotten to Dean, given the distance he'd put between them today.  Was it that he could remember how he'd been all over Cas in the elevator, and didn't want to give Cas the impression that he'd moved past his reluctance -
They left the aquarium and walked towards the small café with a flashing neon sign in the window that appeared to read 'Fsh 'n' chips'.
Cas had left Dean lounging in front of the TV later on that night when he headed out to meet Balthazar and Zeke.
"Well, hey there, Clarence," Meg purred in his ear as Jo finished lining drinks up in front of him, draping one arm around him.  "Gonna buy me a drink, too?"
"Sometimes," she told him.  "Sometimes she's through the back with a drink.  At any rate, she's been better since the funeral."
"'Not tired' my ass," Cas muttered to himself.  He leaned across and switched Dean's alarm off, determined to let him catch up on his sleep.
"Cas and me, we...  I mean..."  Dean swallowed, hyper aware of the four pairs of eyes now focused on him.  "We, uh..."  He turned to Cas.  "You tell them."
Dean stared at him, a bit of relief in his eyes, but the change of direction in conversation apparently catching him off guard.  "Yes.  Please."
"No, it's okay.  It's actually kind of nice to know that my brother's having relationship dramas - it means he's pulled his head out of his ass and is settling down.  Would it help if I talked to him about it?
Castiel continued to see Pamela regularly, however she seemed to focus more on his childhood before he realised he was gay than his current problems.  She kept telling him that it was 'part of the process', but while he wasn't entirely convinced he was prepared to give it time.  He was just glad that Father Reynolds' church had an arrangement with Pamela and a fund to help its parishioners in need of financial aid, because he wouldn't have been able to afford Pamela's rates himself - and he would never have been able to admit as much to Dean.
love him, he was sure of it, even if he never said it.  Besides, many people had emotionally fulfilling relationships without engaging in sexual intercourse.  Of course he'd prefer
When they finally made their way to bed later that night, Cas hesitated as Dean finished undressing.
Ash clapped Dean on the shoulder and flashed him a shit-eating grin.  "Dean-o, you should have made your move a year ago!  You remember, when she had a crush on you?"
Dean took a sip of the soda, screwing his face up because the bottle had been open a week and the fizz was long gone.
"E?" Dean asked carefully, because it wasn't as hard as some of the stuff Sam had been on in the past.
Despite the conflicting emotions raging inside Dean's heart at that moment - guilt, joy, sadness, relief - it was like he could breathe again for the first time that week.
brain," he paused to point at his crotch, "doesn't seem to be on the same wavelength.  And I know that's why I'm here - to figure this shit out - but I don't want my relationship to fall apart before I do."  He took a breath.  "Does any of this make sense to you?"
Dean awoke with a start, blankets tangled around his lower half and his when he reached for the bedside light he fell out of bed with a dull
him.  Needed him to be strong, to be—  A choked sob burst past his lips, then Dean was pulling him up into an awkward hug.
the jokes, he'd seen this episode too many times.  Cas rolled his eyes and smiled fondly at his boyfriend's adorable geekiness.
His stomach grumbled, protesting his week's diet of alcohol with a side of grease.  There wasn't many places around there to get something to eat, but it was a short walk to the chip shop.  Maybe that was why he usually liked going to that little beach - a fish and chip shop was a very
Dean strode into the office, and Castiel mumbled something about going to get a coffee before disappearing.  Dean didn't point out that the coffee machine was
."  He didn't miss the irony that their roles had reversed since they first met.  Dean had started to put the broken pieces of Castiel together, and now he was trying to piece Dean back together.
Dean rolled him over, snorting and grunting his way along Cas's jaw and neck and up to his ear.  "If I'm an octopus, then you're a pig," Dean chuckled between grunts.  His shoulders shook as his laughter ebbed.
"No.  Well, yes.  Not exactly."  He paused, waiting for Cas to say something - anything - but he sat in careful silence, waiting for Dean to elaborate.  "I'm
When they got home, the first thing Castiel did was get changed.  One of the boys had eaten too many sausage rolls and thrown up all over him during a game of musical bumps.  He took his soiled clothing to the bathroom, coming to a halt when he saw Dean already in there, shirtless and looking at himself in the mirror.  A sudden urge to touch Dean hit him, and he had to clench his hands tighter around the t-shirt he held.  Dean was
Dean moved the food to the side of his mouth to speak.  "Are you saying that you think he's not so innocent any more?"
"On me," she said, when Castiel tried to pay her.  "But come on, tell me all about this Big Idea of yours."
"She is," Dean said, moving out onto the porch.  "Damn it, Chuck.  Becky.  If you want to make out there's a room upstairs - get off my damn swing."
It took them almost an hour to check the cupboards, all but emptying each one in their search for Chuck Norris.
"Maybe this would be better spoken about when he comes back for his car," he suggested, placing a hand on Dean's arm and turning him towards the door.
Dean huffed out a bitter laugh.  "Hell yeah, there's a problem!" he cried, running a hand frustratedly through his hair.  "He's gone!  He was there, and then he wasn't, and now...  I'm worried about him."
Outside, Bobby was watching the three mechanics carrying on with a fond smile on his face.  He regretted the loss of a customer, but couldn't help but be proud that his ragtag group of employees stood by one another like family.  No, not
Cas bit his lip, unsure of Dean's sentiment and how to react. Physical gestures of affection were not something that his family indulged in, and he hadn't failed to notice that Dean was more comfortable communicating through physicality rather than words; but while Dean might be able to give out hugs freely and easily, Castiel wasn't comfortable doing so. It had taken a lot for him to embrace him the other day in the department store. He lunged for Dean's hand and squeezed it, before jerking his hands back. "You matter to me, as well," he told Dean, for that much he could be completely honest about.
Finally Dean reached his lips, Cas's breath warm on his face as he hovered above them.  As if he could sense Dean Cas tilted his mouth upwards, chasing his lips.  But Dean pulled back minutely - not yet.  He remembered what Cas had said to him when he'd moved back in - when they'd agreed to be in a relationship.
Castiel periodically looked over at the other two; Ben engrossed in the film, and Dean switching his attention between the movie and the boy.  Neither paid him that much attention, which he could understand and was quietly grateful for.  It allowed him to watch Dean without fear that Ben might notice.
"I'm sorry," he whispered, not opening his eyes.  Sorry for his moment of weakness, for letting Frank turn him against Dean.
With great difficulty, he heaved himself out of bed and dragged himself down the corridor and into the kitchen.
Dean stared after Bobby as he walked away, his stomach twisting horribly until he dashed to the men’s room and retched into the toilet bowl.  Nothing came up, but he knelt there dry-heaving for several long minutes.  He wasn't embarrassed of Cas.  He
He slammed his fist down on the bar, making them both jump.  "Damn it, Ellen, Cas has a boyfriend," he growled flatly, his tone making it clear that should be the end of it.
"Don't like it, don't eat it," Cas told him sharply, snatching the box back.  "There are plenty of vegetables."
"My brother and I used to be inseparable," Dean cut through Castiel's sarcasm, "but now we barely talk. I spend my nights either getting drunk or getting laid, sometimes with a woman whose name I can't remember in the morning. Cas," Dean said, "I don't want you to end up alone. I didn't think I had a problem with the way I lived my life until you came along. My life... isn't much of a life. I don't want you to end up like me, keeping colleagues at arms length and having no friends."
, Dean thought to himself.  "That's it - I'm sending all your Christmas gifts back.  If I can't find the receipts, I'm donating them to Goodwill."
"You keep telling me that, but I'm never going to believe it," Cas told him, raising Dean's hand to his mouth and kissing it.
"I haven't got a home to go to," Castiel admitted quietly; so quietly that Dean barely heard him. His hurt and broken expression hit Dean like a punch in the gut.
"Gay, yeah.  She was a bit suss at me asking about it, but I reckon she'd be cool with it if you told her, but it's also cool if you don't.  This looks more like it."  Dean pulled at the curb beside a bar on the corner that looked quieter the some of the other bars and clubs they'd just driven past.  "You want to go in?"
Dean was bored.  He'd been matching purchase orders with delivery notes for over an hour, and he still wasn't halfway through the pile Cas had allocated him. He had no idea how Cas had managed to take on the whole damn office, when he was bored after just a few days.
have – done something more. He blinked back tears and looked back at Castiel, who was eyeing him warily, and Dean could have kicked himself. He leaned across and placed a reassuring hand on Castiel's arm, hating himself for the way he tensed at his touch.
, Dean!" Castiel was very definite in his decision, and his voice was almost a growl. "Can you just drop it? Please?" he added, slightly softer this time.
Castiel chanced another glance around, but no – there was still far too much flesh on display. "I do not feel comfortable here, Dean," he told Dean after a moment.
Dean started stripping before he'd even closed the door, leaving his boxers in the middle of the floor as he stepped into the shower.  He turned the dial right down, shuddering as the warm spray turned cold.  Traditionally he spent the day in bed until late afternoon, and would spend the rest of the day drinking himself into a stupor.
"But you're fixing those," Castiel reminded him.  "Sam still wants to be a part of your life.  You're communicating with Ben."  He licked his lips.  "I'm still here."
"I...  Yeah, I guess...  Yeah," Dean stuttered, feeling like he was back in high school and kissing his first crush all over again.  She'd been a couple of years older than him, and they'd made out in the music rooms a few times under the guise of guitar lessons.  If someone had told him then that he would one day have similar feelings for a guy, he'd probably have punched them.  But then came Castiel, who was looking at him with such joy and hope in his eyes that Dean felt like he was drowning.  He felt like he should say something more but he'd never been good with words, so he pulled Cas into a hug and squeezed him with everything he had.  "Come home," he whispered into Cas' shoulder.
"Order whatever you like," Ellen said, coming up behind her.  "Dinner's on us tonight.  Seeing as we didn't have much of a heads-up to buy you a gift."
Dean looked down at himself.  "Yeah?" he said questioningly, unsure what Cas's problem was.  "I got scrubbed up and changed my overalls."
This time when Castiel laughed, it was heartfelt.  It seemed like Dean and Balthazar had something in common after all.
." He brought his right hand up to illustrate the difference between the two.  "Somewhere in the middle," he gestured vaguely at the space between them with his right hand, "there's a grey area between the two.  That's where we are.  That grey area.  A kind of... purgatory."
Everyone shook their heads again, but Cas stopped as the window caught his eye.  Fingering the  piece of sticker in his pocket, an awful thought occurred to him.
A horrid thought suddenly hit him - what if Cas wanted to drive Dean around in the Lincoln?!  Maybe Dean could get better at riding shotgun, though perhaps that would be something
"You should go to sleep, then."  Dean leaned forward and grabbed the remote, knocking his empty beer bottles over in the process, but Castiel placed a hand on his thigh and shook his head.  "Cas..."
"Don't be silly," Cas chided him.  Leaving the kitten alone for the moment, he stood up and stepped closer to Dean.  "If she knew you," he told him, cupping Dean's face in his hands, "she'd like you.  I believe that because
Castiel recoiled, half expecting Dean to lash out at him; however he just glared at him. "I'm sorry," he apologised quickly. "That was inappropriate."
He moved away from the shelves and over to her desk, watching as she wrote something down.  "What are you writing?"
There were a few other adults in front of them, so Dean took the camera from Cas and handed it to Ben before giving him an encouraging nudge to push his way past them so he could see.
Castiel could see Dean putting his guard up again in the way his gaze turned cold, and he moved his hand up to the short hairs on the back of his neck.  "You don't have to pretend with me, Dean.  You saved me, in more ways than one.  I won't judge you – not for anything."
Dean hesitantly put a hand over Castiel's. "That's not how this works, Cas," he said gently. "I'm a part of this, now – I walk away, I might as well be the one to shove you off this bridge."
"No you won't," Castiel said smoothly.  "And Bobby's given you the week off, so you can - and I quote - let your hair down."
As tyres squealed and the roar of the engine faded into the distance, Dean dared to peer over the car he'd ducked behind.  A gust of wind carried Bobby's fraying blue baseball cap across the yard like tumbleweed, and it came to a stop in front of Dean.  He swallowed, noticing the small, bloodied hole in the fabric.
"You say you're worried about me, Dean – I'm worried about you," Cas said softly, hoping to undo any potential damage he may have done with his sudden outburst.
"Cas, you're my friend," Dean said softly, rubbing a soothing hand up and down his back.  "Or at least, I
and he was making progress - not that Cas would know much about that, because Dean hadn't told him anything.
Dean chuckled as she led them over to a booth which had been decorated in streamers.  And he used the word loosely, as it was more a case of streamers had simply been thrown across the table and seats.
Dean nodded.  "You know the doctor said if you were still pain you could make an appointment and talk about getting something stronger," Dean reminded him.
Dean stared at Cas's hand where it rested on Ben's dark jacket, grateful that they both got on and that Cas was so considerate of Ben's welfare.
Castiel swallowed.  "I didn't want to get my heart broken," he said carefully, explaining his own reasons for writing his list.  "I loved you—  I
Dean kissed him gently, his lips every bit as soft as Cas remembered.  "I think this is the best present I could get."
Eventually Jo texted him again, letting him know that Dean had drunk too much and asking him to pick him up because he was starting to get confrontational and she was afraid he'd get into another fight.  He responded quickly to let her know he was on his way, before putting on his coat and shoes.
He wasn't very talkative, though, which Dean hoped was a result of the long flight and not a reluctance to be spending part of his Easter break with Dean.
Dean let out the breath he hadn't realised he was holding as relief washed over him.  Neither of them moved for what seemed like a long time.
, and he wanted to keep that for as long as possible.  But the fact that Cas was keen to sign a new lease with him suggested permanence, and gave him a sense of hope that maybe Cas
Dean held his hands up in surrender. "Okay, well, my room's down the corridor just past the bathroom if you need anything. You know where the kitchen is if you get hungry – not that there's much in the cupboards, but I'm sure you'll be able to find something."
, but then he'd felt like he owed it to Cas at the time, for being such a pain in the ass.  He couldn't explain why Cas affected him the way he did - making him feel safe and like his feelings were
Cas slipped his arms around Dean's waist - lower than he normally would have, his fingers skimming the curve of Dean's ass.  "You have a nice ass," he vocalised.
Castiel said nothing and moved away, but a moment later a cool wet flannel was pressed to the back of Dean's neck.
Was it Castiel's imagination or did Bobby sound a little amused?  "And these two columns are for the make and model of their car.  If we keep a note of when each customer has their annual vehicle safety inspection performed, then we can send out reminder letters the following year.  That way they might be inclined to bring their car back here, which means more repeat business."
