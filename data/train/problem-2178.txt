And suddenly, as if a thought had pushed him off the edge, he began sobbing, tears silently streaming down his face. Mycroft walked closer and put his hand on Sherlock's shoulders, because they weren't the type of siblings to indulge in intimate contact, such as embracing, were they?
“Stand up then, John. Right in front of me.”
Then the older Holmes took his wrist, strapped the wristband onto John's right hand and John saw that under a leather flap on the band, a variety of buttons and screens were lighting up, chiefly among them a big red button.
After a while, they both dozed off to sleep.
"I- uh no. Just about to, actually. You want to read it? Why?" John looked up at Sherlock inquisitively. He hadn't thought Sherlock had any interest in this matter.
The next morning he woke up in his bed, a blanket carefully arranged on him, his flat swept clean of drugs, as he would later find out.
The past catches up, some long due apologies, and some much needed apologies are made, and a wistful conversation across the phone.
He remembered the blood pouring from Sherlock's chest, not more than a few years later, those few seconds in the hospital where John thought he would lose him again. Mary had shot Sherlock so that John wouldn't know.
The other’s whisper was barely heard over their own.
Since John couldn't muster up a name that wasn't his or incriminating, he said, trying to be teasing, at ease, "I suppose you'd have already deduced it." He tried to smile.
He idly mused that one day, perhaps he would have seen that face enough to pick out every wrinkle, every fold of the skin, every expression-- and then stopped himself hurriedly. No, it would not do to get carried away like this, he had promised himself.
Sorry for the long wait, but yeah another chapter up and next one coming soon, and I know this feels incredibly slow paced, but I promise the good stuff is coming soon!!
And so while one would not see, the other did not observe, and neither would speak.
It would usually be some time when they were sitting together, or working in close proximity, perfectly friendly and straightforward; when an impulse would rise in the doctor.
"No, Sherlock, as it happens I do have more news," from Mycroft's tone it sounded like Sherlock was going to hate this very much indeed. "Lestrade is going to come later on for a drug's bust. Just to ensure that you're clean, you understand. We are going to have to handle you for a week."
a comfortable pose, but really, the chair was no place to sleep and suddenly, John felt very angry and concerned and a little hurt.
"But I, Doctor Watson, wish to speak to
"John and Sherlock are people who I have known for a long time, now. They've, in the very best way, changed each other's lives. When I first met Sherlock, he was a junkie sociopath and a whiz at solving cases. Reckless, as he still is, but young had naive. John Watson, a retired army surgeon, with a psychosomatic limp, and as we later came to know, a taste for adventure. I saw him the first time at the 'Study in Pink' case, as John's blog says. And as he had begun to live with Sherlock, I saw him many times afterwards, and we became good friends. It was then that I noticed a change." Lestrade turned to John, and asked him, "Tell me John, have you . ever suddenly seen a machine grow a heart? Well this one did!"  This earned him a few laughs.
And then play it over and over at the most unfortunate moments. Like when John was awake at night and not able to sleep and wondering about how he would act as if he loved the detective.
“That is the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard,” John chuckled, only half-joking.
“Ridiculously small price to pay to finally be with you,” John said, continuing to play with Sherlock’s hair.
It helps that their spa schedule is packed and most of the treatments require silence.
“Don’t you want to do this?” Sherlock asked, now rather fearfully than hurt.
Sherlock tugged at his hand. “Everything we tried so far was absolutely breath-taking. I loved it, all of it. I don’t know why penetration should be any different.” The small, encouraging smile he gave John made his insides clench even more. Sherlock was so trusting, so unjustifiably trusting.
He lets out an exasperated breath and clenches his jaw.
it! You couldn’t stop talking about him and, oh, that blog you wrote and—oh my God—
Sherlock, when you come back (I still hope you do), don’t be alarmed that Rosie and I are gone. There are some things I need to take care of and then we’ll be back, promise. I really hope we can talk things through when we’re both home. Because there’s a lot that I need to tell you.
“You’re not the only one I need to beg for forgiveness, Mary. I’ve hurt more people for so many years, I’ve hurt them so badly. I don’t know if I can ever make up for it. I’ve done everything wrong. How can you put years of cruelty and suffering right? How can they ever forgive me for the pain I put them through? I’ve always tried to be a good man but, in the course, I deserted the people closest to me. I’ll do anything to try and fix it but what if I can’t? What if I ruined everything, irreversibly?”
“That sounds fair indeed,” John cooed, running his fingers over the soft skin at the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Does that mean that last night met your expectations?”
“We can still try,” John teased, earning a silent laugh bubbling out of Sherlock. “Well, there is always adoption but, to be honest, I thought… surrogacy. You know, with you as a donor. I’m always amazed when I spot parts of myself in Rosie, and I think having a child that’s part you, too…”
“It’s just something you’re supposed to do on a date, as a gentleman, you know.”
He needs something else to calm his nerves, something significantly more potent.
“Oh, Johnny.” That was all his sister got out before falling mute for a few minutes. John tried to remember the last time they had shared such a comfortable silence. Harry’s thumb rubbed little circles on his skin while her other hand raised her cup for careful sips.
Another chuckle broke loose in John’s throat at the portmanteau though he felt more like crying in frustration. He was fairly sure that Sherlock had found that word in some kind of magazine—and not the scientific kind he usually subscribed to. That was adorable.
Sherlock stops dead in his tracks. “You—you what?”
Following the soaring melody, John climbs up the stairs, trying to identify the tune. It’s either something from
“Am I that soporific?” Sherlock said with a sarcastic grin spreading across his features.
“And you would never miss a gathering where there’s cake,” Sherlock interjected teasingly as John came over with a glass of champagne and took his hand.
Gavin James, Always.
“Here, let me take her. Your side…,” Sherlock said and heaved the little girl into his arms. Rosie immediately grabbled at his face and giggled.
“John.” Even the way Sherlock pronounced his name was softer, full of warmth and honey-sweet devotion. No one else was ever allowed to use his name again, John decided. No one but Sherlock with his velvety baritone and plush lips and that softness, this all-new sensation of truth, on his face.
The wound began to ache numbly now that the anaesthetic slowly wore off, a low throbbing pain at John’s side. It had only been a few stitches, nothing world-moving. No organs had been hit, it was merely a grazing shot. Why was everybody making such a big deal out of it? He had tended to injuries like his with far worse equipment and under far worse circumstances.
He sits down on the covers next to her and begins stroking her arm. “Speaking of the pregnancy…”
He takes a deep breath and hurriedly puts his socks on. “Coming!”
“Oh, and Sherlock, do me a favour and call Greg by his actual name, will you? There’ll be other friends of his and I don’t want him to be embarrassed.”
The woman didn’t avert her gaze but swallowed heavily. “I just—”
Neither of them found sleep for hours.
“He was found in quite curious conditions. Last night’s sleet has destroyed most of the footprints and probably any useful DNA evidence, but there are details that suggest that a second person was in the garden when Jason died. And his shoes were missing.”
This needed to mean something. Why else would John be so cryptic about it? He could’ve just sent the song or chosen other words—any other words—to prompt Sherlock to open the link.
“Must be exciting. Crime solving mates in central London.”
“I’m so sorry to disturb you at this hour, Mr. and Mrs. Rowley” Lestrade said, “but we hoped to talk to your son, Calvin.”
“I didn’t think you’d care anymore. I read your note again,” Sherlock said detachedly.
As his fingers scoured the mess of bills and receipts again for a hidden banknote, they got caught on a plain white piece of paper, folded twice, the creases already brittle from all the times it had been read. Sherlock’s throat hurt as he swallowed heavily. He hadn’t looked at this for a while: ever since the day they had watched Mary’s second video message. He had almost forgotten about it. But now, the pain of being rejected by John Watson was fresh and acute and it felt like the months between Molly handing him this note with Rosie on her arm and the violent falling out tonight had never happened. As if the bliss in between had only been a fever-fantasy dreamed up by his drugged brain, once again forging memories into something better.

“Why do we have to have a party again?” Sherlock sighed, lazily perching himself on the sofa’s armrest, fidgeting with a paper. John shuffled over to him and stood between his legs, allowing them to be on eye level.
Sherlock returned his gaze reluctantly. In this moment, John made a silent vow: Every scar, every bruise that Sherlock had sustained because of him he would paint over with kisses and love marks—tenfold. He would not rest until Sherlock’s skin bore not only evidence of the sacrifices he had made but of the love he had found in return. Until his heart, soul, and body were covered with tokens of John’s fidelity and devotion shining so brightly that he wouldn’t notice the damaged parts anymore.
They stepped out onto the cold street. It was barely past nine and the dark air buzzed with people visiting bars and restaurants. A group of merrily chattering women passed and eyed them both, their interested gazes injecting Sherlock’s mind with an unpleasant thought. He busied his hands by turning up his collar as they directed their steps back to Baker Street.
“I love you too.”
“He tries to reanimate Jason but fails. He’s completely out of his mind and just flees the scene. But he still needs the ring. So, he comes back and we startle him.
“No one.”
The bubble has burst and yet the room around him still feels oddly void of air.
was still happening and—”
“What video?”
No, he needs to find something else.
Mrs. Hudson still stood in the doorway to the kitchen, a grin plastered onto her face, when John hastily let go of Sherlock who then hurried to turn off the smoke detector that had prompted their landlady to barge in on their early-morning intimacies. John could think of a thousand more comfortable scenarios to break the news to their friend than her walking in on them while they slow-danced in the kitchen, half-naked, with hair still ruffled from last night’s sex. They had been so immersed in their embrace that they had forgotten about the pancake on the stove which had by now shriveled down to a coal-black lump. So much for a romantic breakfast between lovers… But what was done was done and had to be dealt with now.
The rest of the day passes in a blur. There’s still a lot to do before they can leave for their honeymoon: seeing their guests off, packing up their presents, finishing up all arrangements at the location.
“Why did you drink beer on the stag night then if you can’t stand it?” Greg asks as Sherlock glides back onto the seat with a colourful cocktail in his hand and a satisfied smile on his lips.
“What?” John forgot to keep walking and Sherlock halted, as well. “I can’t quit my job, Sherlock. There’s rent to pay and food to buy and… I can’t quit.”
“How did she end up at the Yard? And why didn’t Rutherford inform her parents? If it really is Laney,” John said, cocking his head suggestively.
“You can come in—”
Now, almost twelve hours and as many cups of frankly horrible coffee later he had been practically thrown out by Lestrade who threatened to have him escorted if he didn’t leave on his own to get some sleep. Perhaps Sherlock should lace his tea with laxatives the next time he saw him, just as a petty little act of revenge.
“Sherlock—,“ warned John, cocking his head and glaring at him from under his brows, but the younger man could not keep the words fuelled by his own discontent and anger from bursting out in a fiery stream.
). Ever since the morning after the wedding, she has been a steady source of company and distraction, more welcome than Sherlock cares to admit.
Pathetic.
At these low points, John’s room provided a safe haven, a space to calm down. He could shut himself away until he gained control again, to make sure he didn’t spill all this bile on the people he loved. Today, Sherlock knew, he would have drowned in his agony if it wasn’t for the calming memories in this suite. He got up from the sofa, and there he was: John, the version that existed only in his mind palace, standing in the middle of the room, the smile on his lips just as soft as the ridiculous jumper he was wearing. Sherlock approached him and inhaled deeply. Olfactory memories were usually the most potent to relax him. The scent of John’s shampoo mixed with the smoky aroma of Whiskey.
John turns on the spot, an animal rampaging in its cage. “I’m still coming to terms with all of this, alright?! Do you know how shocked I was when I heard you sing that song? I had to see your face to know if it was true!”
“My offer?” Sherlock asks, still dazed. For once, his mind is enjoyably sluggish.
“Not really, no.”
Before Sherlock knew it, he found himself pressed against the cold brick wall, his body pliant under John’s touch. Their lungs still aching with fatigue, breathing life into each other’s mouths, they fumbled around in the dark until fabric and belts and zippers gave way. Adrenaline really made for an amazing aphrodisiac.
Sherlock could see the disappointment on Lestrade’s face as he smiled politely, handed Mr. Rowley his card, and said: “If you think of anything or Cal shows up, please contact me.”
I like to think of this chapter as a fluff sandwich: There's fluff in the end and in the beginning but the middle features some hurt/comfort (that just... sort of happened). I hope it lives up to your expectations :)
“Oh, Sherlock,” Molly sighed and covered her mouth with one hand. The tiny ladybirds on her dressing gown seemed to scuttle away from Sherlock in disgust. He couldn’t blame them.
“How?”
Together, they walk back to the flat. Dusk hasn’t fallen yet and the air is fragrant with blooming trees.
This was just great. He had only wanted a nice quiet evening with Sherlock, watching a movie and maybe nibbling some more gingerbread men, but, of course, he had to pick the one film that apparently featured porn starring what looked like a younger version of himself. What was the universe trying to punish him for?
It has been him since the day they met. The one person giving him meaning, the one fixture his life revolves around. As if two empty years without him haven’t proven that sufficiently.
“She kept touching her ring finger beneath her wedding ring. I bet she usually wears the ring but took it off last night to replace it with showier jewellery. You saw the house: the Beaumonts attach importance to outer appearances.”
John stares at his reflection on the dark surface of the laptop, unable to move. There are tears glistening in his eyes and, as he finally breathes again, one rolls down his cheek.
Sherlock struggled to swallow the contents of his mouth that had suddenly turned from delicious food to tasteless mush. John’s face lit with realization as he raised his eyes to look at Sherlock and he quickly interjected his darkening thoughts: “No, no, no. That’s not what I meant. I’m not taking anything back. I do love you, Sherlock. I mean it. It’s just… extraordinary. But everything about our story is, isn't it?”
“Does she though? Sometimes I get the impression that I’m the one spending least time with her, with work and cases and everything,” John replied, voicing something that aggrieved his conscience for a while now.
Has he still not learned his lesson, after two years, two goddamn years of sleeping too little and drinking too much? After being so close to the brink that a gun in the house was an almost irresistible temptation?
On their usual afternoon stroll, he steered Rosie’s pushchair to the little bookshop two streets down. After a quick chat with the saleswoman, she disappeared in the back and returned moments later with a large-sized children’s book. Sherlock paid, wished her Happy Christmas and stepped back out into the chilly December air. He took Rosie two more rounds around the block until she was calm and sleepy.
“I thought there were no usable samples,” John asked Molly as they huddled around Lestrade’s phone. He had put it on speaker while they waited for the system to process the data and hopefully cough up a name and an address.
He breathes in deeply. A normal person would probably remark what a lovely evening it is, with birdsong drowning out the traffic noise and flowers blooming on every windowsill. But, well, Sherlock isn’t one of them. Normal people, that is.
Sherlock swallowed hard and gave John a clueless or maybe panicked look, no words coming to his aid. Yes, what exactly did he have in mind?
Mr. Beaumont once again took it on himself to formulate an answer rather than seeing his wife struggle through one: “Jason was… He didn’t have a lot of people in his life. Outside of school, he mostly spent his time on his computer. Kids these days, you know. He couldn’t go in for sports with his heart and apart from that… There were a few people he’d go out with sometimes but we never got to meet them.”
Growing impossibly soft, Sherlock sings as if he was sitting right in front of John:
“Because it’s your birthday. Greg and Molly were so happy when you invited them. And Mrs. Hudson’s baked a cake. You got out of celebrating your birthdays for far too long. We’ve already had this discussion weeks ago. Don’t you remember?”
Even less probable.
He cocked his head, placed a kiss in Rosie’s hair, and prayed that she never felt the same things he had as a child.
“Okay, good. Then, what
“I was scared and—”
At the sight of the other man with the cuddly toy, Kristen’s features dropped although she tried her best to hide it.
“Look at me, love.” Sherlock hesitantly raised his iridescent eyes to meet John’s. They never ceased to amaze him with their range of colour. “Being with you has been the only thing I wanted for the past eight years. And it is everything I want for all my years to come. I’m so done agonizing myself because of your sex. I fell in love with you as a person. You don’t have to worry about any kind of comparison or that I’m lacking anything. Whether you’re male or female, whether we have sex all the time or not even once—As long as we’re together, there is nothing else I could wish for. Alright?”
Sherlock had to be home. He simply had to. If anything he had said about the inner workings of his heart had been true—and why shouldn’t it be? —then Sherlock needed to wait for John to return, to reconcile, to fix this. They had always managed to find their way back to each other, hadn’t they? No matter what life threw at them, no matter how much danger and despair they had to overcome, they had always returned to each other eventually. John and Sherlock, Sherlock and John. They belonged together, couldn’t exist without the other, John was sure, now more than ever. Once again, the time it took him to realize this simple truth mortified John. What if he was too late?
“Well, of course, it is. Without you, I would’ve been lost,” John said sincerely and smiled at him until Sherlock reluctantly met his eyes. After two months, he was still so adorably unsure of himself, still worrying if there was a place in Rosie’s life for him. John’s chest clenched a little at the thought.
Sherlock cocked his head, his inquisitive gaze wandering over John’s face in search of something to deduce. “Why’s that?”
“Now, we’ll just have to get the tree,” Sherlock replied, voice raised so John could hear him over the busy noise all around them. Despite the throng of Christmas shoppers that threatened to swallow them, Sherlock’s chest was filled with a warm glistening excitement at the thought of all the ornaments they had just picked out and the prospect of hanging them on a sturdy fir in their home. He hadn’t done this since early childhood, since Mycroft had impressed the foolishness and pointlessness of any kind of tradition upon him year after year after year. Then, John had entered his life and, with the steady fingers of the surgeon he was, began to extricate these splinters Sherlock’s older brother had dug into him over decades. They only came out one sharp piece at a time and left Sherlock bleeding crimson insecurity—but they came out. And John’s friendship filled the voids they left.
“I still do need your help,” Sherlock says as Greg aims for the door.
“Okay, well, let me think,” John said, letting his tongue slip out between his lips again. “Every relationship is unique, so, if one of us isn’t comfortable with something we can just say so, alright?”
drink. He’s never heard Sherlock talk about anyone or anything quite this fondly and it’s frankly alarming. The alcohol has unmistakably loosened Sherlock’s tongue and Greg is half intrigued by the peek behind the scenes he is offered and half worried by the increasing recklessness with which Sherlock talks about his emotional state.
She stuck her chin out defiantly but her voice wavered. “He didn’t do anything wrong. You can’t arrest him.”
His throat is awfully dry all at once as he stares down at the densely packed words without reading a single one.
“Well, usually I wouldn’t have chosen a restaurant where neither of us has to pay but I didn’t exactly have time to make a reservation anywhere else,” John chuckled.
. At the realization, his cheeks turned pink.
“It’s alright.”
How do people not simply give in to the pain, let it consume them? How do they keep going?
Phew, my first smutty scene is finally done and out in the open. What a weird feeling! :D I hope it's not too bad.
“What?”
Harry took his hand once more, soothing John’s twirling thoughts with her firm yet gentle touch. With every stroke, he felt taken back to his childhood, to nights when he couldn’t sleep and Harry had told him stories and jokes until he giggled himself to exhaustion, all while rubbing his head or hand just like this. He hadn’t realized how much he had missed his big sister’s protection, even if he didn’t deserve it.
John wakes on his first morning as a married man with a gigantic hangover.
They entered the building and strode across the entrance hall, determined steps leading them right to the rooms cramped with desks and busy Yarders. A few heads rose as they passed, familiar faces turning towards them. Sherlock felt John’s hand intently slip into his, squeezing it quickly for reassurance. They exchanged a smile and proceeded towards the glass walls of Greg’s office. As the whispers began to crackle, jumping the gaps between work spaces and spreading expeditiously, Sherlock felt them roll off of him with astonishing ease. With John by his side, he was fireproof. Triumphantly, he grinned at the whole room as he closed the door to the office behind them.
A gush of air escaped Sherlock’s lips, half-sob, half-laughter: “Yes, I want to marry you, you fool.”
had he risked everything he currently had with John? Surely, he could somehow have talked himself out of this situation. After all, he was Sherlock
“What?” the other asked impatiently as John stopped his caressing.
A pale moon stared back at him, ignorant of the hearts broken and lives destroyed beneath, unfeeling. God, how he envied it. He’d given everything to return to his numb existence, void of all the sentiment that this damned man had snuck into his heart. But the damage was done. This bell could not be un-rung. And Sherlock Holmes had a feeling, loving, aching heart now pounding in his chest. Making it stop called for radical measures.
“It’s definitely her,” Sherlock said.
“You run a fever,” Sherlock said, his voice thick with concern. That someone as tough and sturdy as John could be knocked out by some stupid microorganisms was just not right.
He’s submerged in this utterly abhorrent feeling of helplessness, of vulnerability, like one of his specimens under the microscope, the scalpel readying to open his chest.
Sherlock blinked rapidly against the tears working their way up his throat, making it tedious to even press out this one, most important syllable: “Yes.”
Sherlock was tired all the time now even if he didn’t want to admit it. He barely slept at night, carefully holding a slumbering John in his arms, like a silent guard against the terrors that besieged him at night. John needed him, needed someone to protect him from the shadows that haunted him or he would end up like his sister, like Sherlock, an addict. He couldn’t let Rosie lose another parent, Sherlock swore it. That’s why he couldn’t allow himself to sleep while on duty. This was too important. He owed it to John, after all he had put him through. And this worked. John had cut back on the whisky significantly already, all because Sherlock offered the stronghold of his body for him to take shelter in, even if he didn’t realize it.
“Really hard. Hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.”
“But what makes you—”
”, John said, scanning Netflix’s Christmas movie options once more.
“What? That you are still the saint, the perfect little angel boy that Mum and Dad can be extra proud of? The doctor and the war hero and now the father of their only grandchild?”
“Well, no,” she said with an apologetical look at him before turning to Sherlock again. “John and Sherlock had a fight,” she asked rather than stated and Sherlock gave a small nod to confirm.
“Hey, would you mind turning that—“, began the cabbie but Sherlock interrupted him with a deadly glare and a violent “Shhh”.
“I couldn’t, don’t you understand!” he bellows and, to his satisfaction, John startles. “I couldn’t risk you getting hurt. I loved you and that was the greatest liability I could burden myself with. I was vulnerable, distracted—and not even sure if I would ever make it home again. The only thought getting me through this was that you were safe. That no one knew and that no one could get to you.”
“It’s fine really. Thank you.”
There he is, Sherlock, at the dining table, alone, seemingly unhurt. At least, as far as Greg can tell.
He hailed a cab, only curtly naming his address before falling silent on the back seat. Cold fingers fidgeting with his phone, Sherlock tried to occupy his mind with anything but the prospect of another night of a warm and far too appealing John pressed against him—or worse, John insisting on sleeping alone—when his text alert beeped. Instead of his usual acknowledgment, wrapped in some polite nonsense about dinner, a reply popped up that made Sherlock’s already caffeine-accelerated heartbeat speed up even more.
“So, the speech…?” Greg asks at length with a pointed look at the file although he’d rather not be involved in this whole thing at all.
, whispered the wind in the swaying trees.
John has barely ever seen the DI in such bad condition. “What’s going on?” he asks, worry clenching his stomach. “Did something happen? To Sherlock? Is he alright?”
, Sherlock thought,
Sherlock leaned against the door frame and grinned mischievously. “You do realize you just handed me the perfect reason to call him anything but Greg all night, don’t you?”
“Did you put up mistletoe?” John asked in a dangerously calm voice.
The waiter brought their drinks, interrupting John’s expectant hush. After John had tasted the wine and the waiter had left again, Sherlock finally took a deep breath and forced out a single sentence: “I would like that.”
He opened his mouth for an un-committal answer when his eyes found Sherlock who met his gaze in some sort of sad disenchantment. The sight clenched John’s heart in a firm cold grasp of guilty conscience. He knew how Sherlock had suffered witnessing John’s denial for years and years, how he still was so painfully aware of John’s need to comply to social norms that he offered him complete control over their display of affection in public. Sherlock was willing to yield to John’s needs, to let him lead, to let John love him on his own terms—as long as he finally loved him.
Rosie seemed to have a peculiar talent for interruption as the rest of the morning proved. Before Sherlock knew they had taken Rosie out for what was supposed to be a quick stroll to tire her out without even a semblance of a chance for some alone time. While she finally took her nap, they had to get everything ready for their guests, moving the kitchen table to the sitting room to provide enough space for everyone.
“I know, Harry. That’s not what I’m trying to say,” John appeased her in a lower voice but Harry’s eyes already shone with the same fire John knew from her teenage years, from every fight she had picked with their father, from every rebellious remark she couldn’t keep in.
“There wasn’t on his clothes or under his nails,” Molly’s tinny voice came from the speaker, “but since you said there was a good chance the suspect was his boyfriend I thought it would be a good idea to… check for recent sexual intercourse although you didn’t particularly request it. So, I stayed late and did some smear tests and found traces of— sperm in his throat.”
John gave him a smile so bright that it seemed to wash off all the hardship of the past months. “Forget about the milk.”
Sherlock only rolls his eyes.
As often over the past months,
“John,” he said, still unsure how to phrase his request,” I just wanted to say… I know you care about appearances and what people think and all that—”
“And that he is the only one for whom I ever felt anything like this,” Sherlock added, his voice now so weighed down by guilt that it barely bridged the wooden table top between him and his friends.
“That’s the thing about you, Johnny,” she said, “you always want to protect people. That’s why you became a doctor and a soldier. You sacrifice yourself for others because there’s this deep-rooted guilt in you that you
Diaper? Dry.
“Stop. You don’t get it, do you? This—all of this—this whole utter… tragedy—happened because of me.”
“What’re you doing?” he asks, syllables washing into each other, as Greg hands him the folder.
“Alright.” He tugs his mouth up into a smile, an act as strenuous as if he had decided to lift the bed frame instead. “Thank you.”
“What am I doing on the floor?”
“And you remembered,” Sherlock rasps, awestruck.
chair. How could Sherlock ever have tried to deny that?
“So, some good shagging is all it takes to handle you. If I’d only known that sooner,” John grinned, this time allowing Sherlock to brush his lips hungrily over his jaw until he reached his mouth, a passionate kiss awaiting him there. John’s intoxicating taste on his tongue, Sherlock flung his arms around him, pulling him closer so he could grind their hips together.
“Something wrong?” John asked and once again displayed his startling ability to sense Sherlock’s distress.
The gun in his hands was shaking as he raised it, pointing at Sherlock. “Who the hell are you? What do you want from me?”
“Just once. When he caught me kissing another boy,” John said with enunciatively raised eyebrows and Sherlock gave an understanding yet pitying sigh. “For the next four years, I walked on eggshells, making sure nothing ever upset him. And when I finally finished school and got into King’s College, I left. And never looked back. I worked two jobs and got a loan to put myself through Uni without his support. It was hard but I managed. I was in Afghanistan when he died. Didn’t go to the funeral. Didn’t even see the grave till today.”
“A heart attack at 18?” John interrupted again.
“You are also an ex-drug addict, love. We shouldn’t risk anything in the heat of the moment.”
“Guess what, bumblebee,” John murmurs into his daughter’s hair and a smile spreads on his face. “We’re going home.”
And then he hears it again.
“Of course, there was.” Sherlock got out of the make-shift tent and eyed the surrounding garden. His explanations left his lips almost involuntarily as he made his way back to the front of the house, knowing very well that John and Greg would follow him. “His missing shoes. I don’t think they are actually missing. Yes, I bet if we look for them in the house we’ll find them. Jason just didn’t put them on. He followed the suspect out into the garden in a hurry, hence bare feet. It was so important to him that he didn’t bother putting on his shoes although it was freezing out. The other person obviously wanted to get away as fast as possible, so he had to react just as quickly. And since the suspect wasn’t exactly considerate enough of Jason’s lack in footwear to return to the house or at least the terrace in spite of the emotional connection we’ve already established, I’d say it had to be quite the heated argument.”
He glanced at Sherlock who didn’t look quite as satisfied as he would’ve expected.
!” Greg’s eyes went wide with fury as he pushed himself off the desk and stepped closer. “He could’ve been armed, Sherlock.”
“I’ll have to trust you on that matter,” Sherlock replied more to himself, already lost in thought.
"Yes."

His smile deepened. This gift was even more thoughtful than he had presumed, an homage to the past, giving the requested deduction a new, nostalgic significance. Sherlock recalled his words carefully.
John felt tears escape his eyes in a steady stream he did not intend to stop. It had to come out now, all of it. He half-expected the earth to open up and swallow him, bury him next to his father where his shame could suffocate him for all of eternity.
Greg and Molly galvanized into one blushing, giggling, kissing unit. Sherlock avoided looking in their general direction while examining the body, trying to uphold some level of professionalism, but his thoughts soon went wandering back to the morning, to the delightful sounds his tongue had drawn from John’s. He once again wished himself transported back home. Or at least to a space with some privacy. A supply closet or something. Just to be alone with John, his John.
“I just don’t like the thought of him running around London without help. You know how he gets…,” he adds in what he feels is his last attempt at making Mary see how impossible the idea of Sherlock Holmes without John Watson is.
He turned into a less peopled street, craving solitude.
“You can borrow a shirt and some pyjamas from me,” replied Sherlock coolly and disappeared into his bedroom before John could object. He returned minutes later with fresh sheets, one of his own pillows, a blanket, and some clothes in his arms. In the meantime, John had already rid himself of his damp button-down shirt and taken the smorgasbord of loose papers and files off the couch. Without further ado, Sherlock set down his stack and wished John a good night before retreating to his room. John’s reply got lost in the shutting of his friend’s bedroom door. He prepared his provisional bedstead, stripped down to his pants and hung his clothes over his armchair to dry. Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms were several inches too long for him and the t-shirt he had given him stretched tightly over his broader chest. The sofa wasn’t ideal for restorative sleep either and John already knew that his shoulders and back would resentfully remind him of his poor choices the next day. Nonetheless, the sheets and clothes gave off Sherlock’s distinctive, soothing fragrance and he almost immediately drifted off into a dreamless slumber with an exhausted smile on his lips.
“I meant what I said. I want to lick and kiss and pleasure every inch of you, John. I want to swallow as much of you as I can, take you all in.”
“Well, he was pretty drunk,” Greg interjected but a nudge from Molly’s elbow silenced him at once. Sherlock lowered his eyes back to his empty cup, lips pursed in embarrassment.
“A cab driver pulled me back, anyways,” Sherlock added, his voice still void of all emotion.
“It wouldn’t have mattered,” Molly chimed in, with Rosie on her lap babbling affirmatively. “The autopsy suggests that Jason wouldn’t have made it even if Cal had immediately called an ambulance. They would have taken too long to arrive. Cal tried to resuscitate him for minutes and he did it properly going by the broken ribs. It was simply too late.”
Sherlock was just about to propose another try at some private birthday celebrations when his eyes found the clock. He groaned. Time had evidently developed a conscience of its own, stretching and shrinking however it pleased. This was getting ridiculous.
“Do you have to do that now?” Sherlock asked, letting his head rest on John’s shoulder. His curls tickled John’s temple, their addictive scent easily drowning out the citrus aroma of the dish soap.
This chapter's song is:
Yes, that’s probably it. It’ll change once the wedding stress is behind them and they’ve had time to settle into all of this.
Once again, Greg shifts his weight as if standing on one particular spot for too long would burn his feet. For a beat, he eyes John with such intensity that he feels his face heat up.
?” Sherlock marked the last word with air quotes to underline his sarcasm, desperately hoping that John wouldn’t recognize it as the futile attempt in masking his insecurity it was. John didn’t need to know how nervous he was about this part of the night—all honesty aside.
Sherlock slumped down next to John on the sofa again. “So?”
Sherlock’s stomach tightens, reacting faster than his mind can pick up the information.
He looked back at John who had followed his gaze. His eyebrows rose suggestively before he leaned into Sherlock and all but yelled in his ear: “About time! He’d been pining for her for years now.”
After a few minutes, John had regained his composure and settled into this new position. What else was he supposed to do? It was not like he didn’t enjoy having Sherlock this close to him. The warmth of Sherlock’s body slowly leaked through his coat right into John’s skin and invigorated him far more than the caffeine possible could. Cautiously, John raised his left hand the few inches he could without waking his friend and placed gentle fingers on Sherlock’s thigh, slowly rubbing his thumb over the smooth fabric of his expensive trousers. Upon the touch, a little pleased sound reminiscent of a purring cat escaped Sherlock’s throat. John’s insides turned a somersault at this endearing noise.
The car rumbled over an uneven patch of asphalt and Sherlock’s head slipped off his shoulder and onto John’s. For a moment, John froze completely, not even daring to breathe, as dark curls brushed over the bare skin of his neck. All of a sudden, he was wide awake again, every single one of his nerves buzzing with electricity. From where Sherlock was touching him goosebumps began to spread over his entire body. What was happening?
Sherlock’s brows furrowed so John hurried to say: “I totally deserved that. And I promise you that I won’t flirt with anyone ever again—except for you, of course.”
—and the inconnu began to hastily examine the ground beneath him. His face was still indistinguishable.
“Yes.” Greg’s voice is softer now but bruises John all the more.
So, Sherlock had ransacked the flat for any memorabilia, had fortified his mind palace, had prepared every possible channel of communication, including his phone.
John chuckled. “Contrary to your assumption, the dishes aren’t going to do themselves.”
And he knows that Greg can see them.
“I didn’t think you would actually come,” said Sherlock.
“The best.”
Typical.
“You, leading me on like that, telling me you love me, dancing with me and then acting as if that’s nothing. Letting me back into your life just to leave me again for the first woman that comes along.”
“She’s not saying John,” he insisted. “She’s saying
“Would you like some… coffee?”
The confession stirred up something in Sherlock that had, until now, only lazily bobbled in his head. “Did Jason give any reason why he started stealing in the first place?” he chimed in, leaning forward in his seat. “He wasn’t exactly destitute, was he? Why steal something you could probably just ask your parents for?”
“Yes, I’ve just been seeing you with Rosie, how good you are with her, how happy you look when all three of us are together, and I thought… I just love raising her with you. I never thought I was cut out to be a father but you… You are simply extraordinary, and you make me a better parent, too.” When Sherlock stayed silent, he added: “We don’t have to decide right now. Just think about it.”
Oh, how much they must pity him, the poor silly man who’s rumoured not to have a heart and got it broken anyway.
Since I've been sick with the stomach flu myself a few weeks back, I decided to use my misery as inspiration :D
“Of course, I still do. And I always will. Now, come on, let’s go to bed.”
Sherlock bites his lip. “Greg, please,” he says after a beat.
On the phone or when they met up at pubs, he barely managed a few words of comfort, not quite getting why John took it so hard. Sure, Greg was shocked and ashamed of himself, too. But his grief was nothing compared to John’s.
The thought shoots a pang of guilt down his throat.
“And it doesn’t mean the same as
“Not exactly. I mean, of course, it fits the season, but mostly I chose it… because it was Mary’s favourite as a child.”
chaos, his own hurricane of excitement and exhaustion and bliss. If there hadn’t been his nagging conscience reminding him that he was a widower and a single father and still not done mourning Mary’s death.
As soon as his message appeared in the blue bubble, Sherlock could not bear to look at the screen any longer. He locked the phone and placed it back on the desk, facing down. For a few minutes, he just sat in his armchair, nervously jiggling his feet and fidgeting with the waistband of his dressing gown, but the jittery energy building in his mind finally made him get up and roam the flat, in desperate need of some distraction. Eventually, he slumped down again at the kitchen table and bent over his microscope to examine some samples of different nail polishes he had collected but nothing could grab his attention for more than a few minutes. Why didn’t John reply?
John waves his tea-free hand. “Yes, you know. Friends do that.”
John loved watching them; the way Sherlock talked to her in that special low voice, the way he peppered her little body with kisses and nuzzles until Rosie giggled and squealed with joy.
“They’re both pretty shaken up but fine considering what they’ve both been through. Children’s services are informed and have taken Laney to a foster family. Cal’s still in custody and under psychological supervision, given his suicide attempt. I’ll do what I can to get him out of this mess. Sherlock insisted.”
Sherlock poured them each a fresh glass of wine before turning to John again, a smile on his lips—calm and affectionate. He raised his glass and his words rang in John’s chest, golden rays of sunlight: “It's always you, John, you're everything I want."
“Money. Or maybe he’s got kleptomaniac tendencies as well. Hard to tell.”
“Sounds good, I’ll take the same,” John said light-heartedly. “Want to share a bottle of wine?”
Sherlock let his lips brush over John’s, slightly nibbling, before sliding his hands under his shirt and capturing his mouth in a proper kiss. John hadn’t had time yet to get used to the reaction Sherlock’s touches evoked in his body—this urgency with which the blood pooled in his groin, the roaring of his heartbeat, the hunger tugging at his insides that could not be satisfied by pancakes. How did this ivory-skinned, honey-scented bastard turn him into such a savage beast?
“I’ve cooked and baked for you before but that never got you to shag me,” Sherlock responded accusatorily and spun John around in a little twirl.
With a sound of surrender, John’s left hand wraps around Sherlock’s wrist while the right reaches forward and gently settles on Sherlock’s cheek, a slightly calloused thumb tracing his cheekbone.
“Any term of endearment you see fit.”
“Could I talk to you for a second, Greg?” Sherlock asked and nodded towards the kitchen.
“Just lie down for a bit then, alright?”
Maybe Sherlock is trying. With this letter.
“Do you know why I had to jump off that building? Do you want to know?” he hisses at him, springing to his feet and stepping closer, using his height to full advantage. John has to look up at him now, their eyes boring into each other.
“As I said,” Sherlock reiterates, “I don’t usually need another instrument for composing.” He squints at the telly and sways slightly against Greg’s shoulder.
“It’s… pink.”
“Stop!” John’s voice cut through the darkness and Sherlock followed it half-blindly.
A boy in a dark sweatshirt stood in the far left-hand corner, his back turned to them, shaking with rapid breathing. As he whirled around, Sherlock’s chest tightened painfully. The boy’s face, unshaven and sickly, was as pale as ivory; it almost shone in the semi-darkness. Cold, frightful sweat had glued his fringe to his forehead in dishevelled strands. Hadn’t his shoulders moved with the effort to provide his body with oxygen, Sherlock would’ve been sure that he was looking at a marble statue rather than a human being, an unsettling sculpture depicting a lost childhood. Everything about this boy screamed of absolute and utter helplessness.
The pregnancy.
, understood?”
He knows that others have been quick to joke about the two single men living together, in the truest sense of the word. They didn’t just share a flat; They shared adventures and an unsettling preference for the macabre. Hours after their first meeting, they were already bickering like a married couple.
“It’s alright, bumblebee,” John mumbled into her silky blonde hair and soaked in his daughter’s comforting smell, but half an hour passed and Rosie still wailed on. “It’s alright, daddy’s here.”
“Really, a helicopter?” Sherlock asks an hour later when they return to the flat. Sorting out everything has cost time and nerves. Greg doesn’t even want to think about the landslide of paperwork this mishap will bring down on him.
“And then you dropped your phone in the Thames?”
“It’s alright, Sherlock, calm down.” John rested his hand on Sherlock’s upper arm and felt the tension beneath the expensive silvery shirt he was wearing. He had suspected that Sherlock wanted to make the holidays special for him and Rosie this year. It was their first Christmas with Mary gone and bittersweet nostalgia followed John around like a shadow everywhere he went. The thought that Rosie’s mother wouldn’t be there to watch her daughter unwrap her first Christmas present or catch snowflakes in her pink little hand haunted him constantly.
It’s a wonder he’s woken up before her because, after all, she didn’t have a drop of alcohol after…
John clings to this image as he shuffles down to the kitchen; the two of them on a beach, the sun sizzling on their skin and shallow waves playing around their bare feet. That doesn’t seem so bad. It’s just a nice holiday.
tell me?” God, sometimes this man-child cost him his last nerve.
“Dad, I’m going to say things now I’ve carried with me for a long time, decades even. I know you didn’t want to hear them when you were alive but you’re not anymore, so… you’ll have to listen to me now. Because I have to tell you, should’ve told you back then. Back when Harry moved out, when you basically kicked her out just because she brought home a girl. I should’ve told you then but I was so scared of you. Of you and your anger and your disappointment.”
For once, John and Sherlock agreed to ride in a police car. Donovan was driving; a fact that Lestrade took advantage of by turning around in his seat every few seconds and eyeing them both sternly.
“I was fairly certain after the Woman.”
After Mary is done, John showers and gets dressed with military efficiency, running through the morning’s schedule again and again as if it were a mantra keeping him focused.
“I just can’t seem to stop composing,” he said apologetically and let his violin sink. “Has always worked as a great emotional outlet for me, music, composing. And now, I just have so many emotions and nowhere to store them.”
“Of course, I can change by myself, I am not a child,” came Sherlock’s indignant reply, his voice still carrying the weight of the nightmare, but John took it as a good sign that he could already snap at him again. And, honestly, he was relieved that he didn’t have to undress Sherlock. This situation was already awkward enough without the dizzying mix of emotion such an act would probably entail.
“At what time?”
It was Sherlock who had brought back the colours.
“My kind of idiot.”
His smile dropped.
It’s back to normal, if anything.
“Where is she now?” Sherlock reiterated.
John knows he shouldn’t be so upset, has other things to think about, but Sherlock is his best friend and, whether John wants it to or not, being abandoned like this… it hurts.
Sherlock now followed a new approach altogether: He tried to reciprocate these acts of kindness up to his own capability—which didn’t allow for much, really. Pleasing people was not Sherlock’s strong suit; that had been made clear throughout his entire life. Yet, there had to be ways for him to show John how much he loved having him around again but, as always, Sherlock couldn’t quite figure out what made John Watson tick.
He didn’t bother with the gate and jumped straight over the fence. His longer legs caught up with John and he risked a glance at him, seeing his own determined yet thrilled expression mirrored back at him.
There's another link to it in the chapter so you can listen to it and read along.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why didn’t you tell me? Back then, I mean. I could’ve tended to you. I would’ve—”
Sherlock had noticed that these little caring gestures had increased exponentially since they had returned from Norfolk. At first, Sherlock had hated it; He was angry at himself for breaking down at the precinct, displaying such weakness, and angry at John for trying to coddle him. However, pushing John away with snarky remarks and cruel comments had stopped working a long time ago. John just rolled his eyes at him and stayed stoically right where he was, only showing his hurt in the most minuscule ways possible. These little markers—brows a little too furrowed, jaw a little too clenched—made Sherlock realize that John was genuinely worried about him. Wasn’t it cruel to forbid him to act on his protectiveness? After all, Sherlock would rather John cared about him than go back to a world where John was not only indifferent to his pain but even inflicting it purposefully. John taking care of him had never once been a disadvantage, not to mention that Sherlock enjoyed the hopeful tingling in his chest when John displayed signs of affection. So, what use was in fighting it? His anger followed no logic. Therefore, his reactions needed to change.
Over the course of the night, John dozed off a few times, only to be tortured by visions of Sherlock, his face pale and agonized, his hands clutching his chest were shards of his broken heart had pierced through his skin, colouring his shirt red with blood. Every time, John awoke with a start and a pain in his own chest that made him trace the fabric of his jumper to ensure he didn’t bleed.
John’s brows slide together like an iron gate locking his face. “Obviously, I don’t.”
In silent agreement, John permanently joined Sherlock in his bed at nightfall, limbs pulling each other into an embrace that grew almost desperate in its tightness. And nothing more happened. They only held onto each other with fearful steadiness because letting go meant drowning in the high tide that had flooded their life. It was nothing but a lifesaver, John thought, an anchor in these darkest waters, a safe haven after Mary and Moriarty and Eurus. Sherlock wanted to console him, nothing more. He was trying to make up for the pain and the loss, offering a little safety, a little solace. Just like he was babysitting Rosie, doing his chores (at least sometimes), or dragging John along to crime scenes—He was just trying to help. And for once, John found himself too weak to refuse it even though the thought of Sherlock’s sole, noble intention tugged at his guts with vicious claws.
“But a missing engagement ring, one she wears every day… wouldn’t that be conspicuous? Why not go for something more low-key? There was plenty of other valuable stuff in that house.”
He is stuck in a bubble, just he and the letter clutched in his hand. Nothing outside of it matters, nothing is real but those words he hears in his head in a deep, well-known voice. Even his own heartbeat, heavy and ominous, is drowned out by the timbre of Sherlock’s voice conjured by his writing.
Sherlock found him leaning at the kitchen opening, his hair still wet and unruly. His nonchalant sex-appeal almost choked the air out of Sherlock’s lungs.
“We’ll figure it out.” John gives him a smile, calm and determined. “We always do.”
“But he’s made the wrong choice,” Sherlock protests, his voice torn and pleading.
He craved the nighttime now as much as he feared it. Sometimes he needed the whole day to prepare for the hours in which John was lying next to him, his arms wrapped around Sherlock so tightly that he could almost bring himself to believe that the intimacy was actually meant for him, that John didn’t think of his late wife, didn’t pretend to be holding Mary instead of him.
Who would think such horrible things about their unborn child?
This chapter's song:
John didn’t budge. “Oh, trust me, I’ve noticed.”
, isn’t it?” Sherlock let out a pressed, high-pitched laugh and, finally, John looked at him.
Sherlock gave John a nod and leaned back on the sofa. Given the stakes for Greg on this case, it was probably a wise decision to let John do most of the talking and, instead, diligently record every single detail of the interviewees’ reactions.
He had sworn it, had promised himself when Sherlock came back: John would never let him be his life’s centre again.
Sherlock let out another exasperated sigh. “You should most definitely quit that job of yours.”
Sherlock sounded concerned. “What?”
“Desperate, indeed. Did he say what made him stop believing in their plan? He had to be pawning the Beaumont’s riches for a couple of weeks, at least, right? Why not keep at it?”
Overcome by an unexpected sense of pride, John puts down the letter and grabs his phone instead.
“It’s not your job to protect me or look after me. I can do that myself, thank you,” Harry said a bit too loud. The couple two tables over paused their own conversation to shoot her an interested glance.
“First things first,” John began in the calm voice he used on clients, “where were you last night?”
“Sherlock—,” Lestrade began, hands raised in an appeasing gesture that only facilitated Sherlock’s anger. It boiled beneath the surface, so scorching hot his skin must’ve shown by now, must’ve bubbled and melted off.
He wasn’t even angry at John anymore, just like he hadn’t been back then. John had every right to cast Sherlock as far away from him as possible. Who could ever care for someone this damaged? For someone who broke lives and happiness like a bull in a china shop? He had known on that fateful day as a teenager. Over twenty years later, it was still true: Sherlock Holmes was unlovable, an abnormality, a monstrosity with no place in this world.
Hands were on his back, pulling him into a tight embrace. Someone called his name, over and over again, but that was just a hallucination. After all, he was in a vacuum. Sound couldn’t travel here, in the pitch-black darkness that surrounded him, without air, without life. It tore and tugged at Sherlock, begging him to join its nothingness.
He’s not in his right mind. It’s the hangover, this sodding headache and the sheer surprise. He just has to get used to the thought, he tells himself. As soon as the baby is here, he’ll be overjoyed. Definitely.
At first, Sherlock didn’t pay much attention to the movie. He was determined to limit his disapproving comments to a minimum in order to let John enjoy their new tradition but didn’t plan on actually following the plot with conscious thought. That was until a scene appeared on the screen which jolted his mind to full capacity: In what seemed to be a mansion or rather a filming set, a man and a woman were moving against a fake marble pillar in more than suggestive movements, although fully dressed. The bloke couldn’t be older than his late twenties but even the age gap didn’t reduce the uncanny resemblance his features bore to the man sitting right next to Sherlock on the sofa.
“I know how you feel,” John said, meeting Cal’s sceptical eyes with steadfast calmness. “I really do. After my mom died, my father turned to alcohol and hit my sister any chance he got. I still feel like I should’ve protected her better, stepped up to him. I honestly admire what you’re trying to do for your sister. And I’m sure so did Jason or he wouldn’t’ve supported you like that. You both thought this was the only way out and I totally understand that—”
John pinched him. “Shut up.”
Sherlock’s state wasn’t any better. He trudged into the kitchen on bare feet when John had just made coffee, his curls in a mess and skin even paler than usual. Going by the pained expression on his face as John described his alcohol-induced amnesia, his headache was just as bad as John’s.
“You were better off believing I was dead. I had to destroy Moriarty’s network and—”
Sherlock seemed to bite back a laugh once more, his kiss-bruised lips curling into an amused grin. “That’s very considerate of you but I’m pretty sure we’ll both have more fun if I leave that to you.” His newly-freed fingers entangling in John’s hair, he added: “Besides, I love the idea of having a part of your body inside of me.”
While John showered, Sherlock picked up his violin and began playing a tune. Since John had first kissed him, his mind was overflowing with music. He could’ve spent hours upon hours composing symphonies of love and longing, of crushing desire and final deliverance. His violin sweetly resounding within the walls of their flat, Sherlock swayed with the music, eyes only opening to jot down notes and clefs every few beats, while Rosie listened in fascination.
Hello everyone :)
After abundantly making fun of silly human sentiment over the years, here is Sherlock, crafting a beautiful love letter and hiding it in John’s coat pocket. The charming bastard.
“But if you go downstairs you’ll have to put on more clothes and I would really have things rather go in the opposite direction,” Sherlock murmured against John’s temple and tugged at the tight t-shirt that had already exposed several inches of his lower abdomen and back.
The next second, John is disgusted with himself.
Even if the wall wouldn’t hold off any enemies, at least its fall would not go unnoticed.
Uncomfortable silence saturated the space between the two men, both diverting their gaze now. The world had suddenly gone mute and oddly void of air as they stood there, in their home which didn’t quite feel like a home anymore. Sherlock didn’t know if he could ever free himself from this sensation and move again until a distorted wailing sound from the baby monitor pierced the air. Their fight had obviously woken up Rosie.
“What?” Sherlock sat back up. John tried hard not to laugh out loud at the adorable indignation saturating his question.
“I wanted to confront him, tell him everything I never did while he was alive—about my bisexuality and how his behaviour fucked me up. And how I am done being someone I’m not just to avoid his anger and disappointment. I needed to get that out of the way before I talked to you. That’s why I visited Mary’s grave as well, to get her blessing, you know. And I met Harry for coffee. You should have seen her face when I told her that I’m bi… She could barely contain herself. I just wanted to get everything out, wipe the slate clean. We don’t need all this emotional baggage weighing us down, don’t you think?”
“You could never see what I so clearly displayed. You didn’t want to,” he continued, his voice now lower but none the less dangerous. “Still, I stayed. I watched you with Mary and realized how much you needed her reassurance, her comfort. So, I encouraged you, even helped plan your wedding, all while every moment seeing you two together literally broke me over and over again. I stood in front of all the people we both care about and spilled my heart out after you had just vowed to love someone else for the rest of your life. Because I value your happiness above everything else. Because that’s what a good friend is
John grasped both his wrists with one hand to stroke Sherlock’s side with his free one while attacking his insolent lips with his teeth until Sherlock whimpered. John grinned against his skin as he left bruises and bite marks all over Sherlock’s neck, his own breath ratcheting up with every moan escaping Sherlock’s lips. The man squirming beneath him, completely at his mercy, was intoxicating, and soon John felt his ferocious nature wake, rattling at the bars of its cage, screaming to tear Sherlock apart.
The disc is still stuck in his waistband, only the paper wrapper and the fabric of John’s vest between it and his skin. The barrier feels too thin. Any second now the plastic should singe him with its red-hot secrets.
“Well, we might be able to help with that,” John said and told Greg all about their theory and the subsequent nightly encounter with the thief. As suspected, he wasn’t thrilled.
“If she does become a detective I can hardly take credit for that. Half of her extended family is in law enforcement, after all. It could just as well be Greg or Molly’s influence.”
Maybe it was just the neon light playing tricks on his eyesight, but Sherlock was certain that John had smiled for just a second, even though his expression was more serious than he had ever seen when he finally looked up. “No, I mean, the things about me.”
The crowd now split less reluctantly as John and Sherlock resumed their pursuit. A few people even tried to grab the fugitive but none succeeded. He dodged their hands and ran at full speed into another alley. They sprinted after him, Sherlock’s legs already protesting adamantly. He couldn’t keep this up much longer. His prey, however, seemed to have inexhaustible strengths at his disposal and gradually but surely extended his lead.
“I was just apologising.” He sounded casual enough to fool anyone but John.
“Well, for once… You and John don’t strike me as the kind of mates who tell each other
He left the Upper Bridge Road with its suburban idyll behind and made a turn on Writtle Road. Only five minutes later, as he stopped in front of the gate and read the sign, he realized that he had not thought things all the way through:
As John took a controlled slow breath, the intoxicating scent of Sherlock’s hair hit his nose and trickled right into his veins, quickening his heartbeat and making him dizzy. It was the second time within a few hours that John was so close to Sherlock. But this time, without the bitter taste of grim memories lingering in the air, it was nothing but exhilarating. And possibly extremely awkward if Sherlock woke up now, John thought, still unable to move even the slightest bit.
He grabbed his phone from the desk. At least, he could spare himself some of the inevitable humiliation by not having to do this face to face.
“Thank you. This will be fun, I promise,” John said as he put on his jacket.
Next to him, Greg shifted his weight from leg to leg. He looked almost as bad as Sherlock.
“Sherlock, enough.” John’s lips curled into the deadly half-smile he always displayed when he could barely keep from pouncing on someone. Sherlock was a long way from caring. He even hoped John would attack him, so he could feel his hands on him one last time. There wouldn’t be another opportunity to get this close to John. They were bearing down on an abyss neither of them would be able to climb back out of. Sherlock had shown his hand. There was no turning back now.
“So scared that you’d rather be with someone you don’t love?”
If he has waited too long—
“I am not cute.”
John’s hand finds its way into Sherlock’s, squeezing it as they listen to Greg’s words. The brand-new wedding band pressed into Sherlock's skin feels natural, like a missing part of his body returned at last. He can’t believe it took so long for them to arrive here.
“When did that happen?”
Held back by invisible chains, John halted again. Every inch of his being ached to step in, to walk up the stairs and be at ease again. Yet, the soldier within him knew that he was about to access unknown territory that called for caution. There might now lie landmines beneath those floors he had walked a thousand times, there might be spring-guns hidden behind curtains. Bracing himself by a deep breath, John entered the hallway. As he dragged the pushchair in behind him, Mrs. Hudson scurried from her own flat and greeted him with an expression on her face that tightened John’s chest.
“What do you want to eat?” John repeated the question to Sherlock’s relief and slid the weekly changing menu over to him. Sherlock scanned it quickly and then ordered one of the homemade pasta dishes without much consideration. Food was one of his smallest concerns right now.
“John?” she repeats, sleep being replaced by alarm. “Everything alright?”
“How come I’ve never heard you play before?”
John rose again, holding Rosie upright on her tiny gloved hands, while she greeted her mother in wet babbling sounds. She had grown so much. Soon she would walk on her own, speak, leave for her first day of school, dance on her wedding day. Without her mother there to guide her. John’s insides ached for his daughter. But there was also so much room now, for a different future to grow in the space Mary had left, a better one even. John would do all humanly possible to fill that void with love and adventures and flowers to bloom in the spring. And his little girl would be happy, sung to sleep by a dark, honey-like voice, walked down the aisle by two pairs of fatherly hands. The thought made John’s heart sing.
“Of course, I did. And I texted you at least five times before that. But you didn’t respond, not even when I begged you to, to know that you were okay and not hit by a car or getting a fix or—” John stopped to dig out his phone and shoved his texting history in Sherlock’s face. “See?”
Somehow, it feels even heavier and sharper then the first time he’s held it.
“What do you mean
Welshly Army, Sanctuary.
“Well, for the most part, I guess so.”
The deep note makes goosebumps spread all over John’s body. Deep inside his bones, something is shifting, falling into place, but he can’t quite put his finger on it. Why does this performance move him so much? It is heartwarming to watch, sure, but there’s something more, something significant going on. His breathing speeds up a notch without him being able to do anything about it. His whole body has become oddly rigid, no longer accepting orders from his mind. The bag full of groceries slips from his hand and lands on the floor with a thunk that makes Sherlock, at last, aware of his existence.
But as the night progressed, he had looked for him, asked after him, texted him five times at least.
John knew that refusal was pointless because it would entail a string of arguments and deductions from Sherlock concerning his apparent sleep deprivation. And anyway, he was way too tired to get a cab in the pouring rain with a grumpy baby. So, he just nodded and, too, took a sip to avoid having to make any further comments. The soothing liquid sank down his throat and slowly dispersed the cold in his body.
Well, I'm back. I have literally no excuse for taking so long to post this other than that this chapter was a freaking monster. It haunted me, tormented me, and I'm still licking my wounds. It ended up being over 11k+ long (wtf?), so I hope that makes at least partly up for the long wait.
For a few heartbeats, both remained silent. John knew not to push him and patiently waited for Sherlock to gather his courage.
Rosie senses his high spirits and lets out wet giggles throughout her breakfast. John himself is too nervous to even think about eating. He just hastily downs a cup of coffee—maybe not the smartest decision in light of his already wired state—and then carries Rosie upstairs again to get them both ready. While she’s safely sitting in her crib, John showers and gets dressed a little more diligently than usual, and then puts Rosie in her cutest onesie—the one with little bees all over it. After all, they have a big day ahead of them.
Except for Tara, everyone raised their drinks in different grades of embarrassment. Sherlock felt John’s eyes burning on his skin as they both lowered their cups again. His body temperature must have jumped up several degrees at the thought that John had fantasized about someone sitting here with them, too. Then again, there was no reason for it. Probably John was just thinking about Molly or Stella—even Esther or Tara. But maybe,
“Yes.”
Or maybe it was just those hands, those arms that held him, cradled him, pulled him back down to earth. Sherlock opened his eyes. Mycroft’s face above him had lost all colour. His eyes were wide with the same panic that still heaved Sherlock’s chest in rapid motion.
Hello everyone!

As usual, Sherlock left the task of checking in and chatting with the staff to John, while he planned their further course of action. The twenty-something year old that stood behind the counter handed John the keys to their twin room and offered to take their luggage upstairs but John refused politely. He felt oddly taken back to their trip to Dartmoor when they had stayed in the Cross Keys, vividly reliving the embarrassment as Gary had mistaken him and Sherlock for a couple and apologized for the lack of a double bed in their room. Now, however, that he and Sherlock actually shared a bed every night, a curious sense of loss stirred in his chest at the thought that they would sleep separately tonight.
“Tell us what happened,” she encouraged him again with her kind, doe-like eyes shining in the warm glow of the pendant light above her head. Many years ago, Sherlock had stopped resisting the urge to confide in those warm pools of cinnamon-sweet loyalty. She was the one who always saw him—at his weakest, his frailest, his smallest—and still cared.
“Gone, too. He took the child with him, I suppose. After all, he is her father,” Mycroft’s voice crept to his ear, distant and distorted, “I can let someone find out where they are if—”
“John,” Sherlock breathed and all but fell to his knees beside John’s bed. “Are you alright? How’re you feeling? Are you in pain? Do you need stronger medication?”
“Sherlock, I—,” John began and slightly raised his hand but Sherlock winced at the movement and continued: “When you moved back in, brought Rosie with you, entrusted your child in my care, I finally felt whole again. Almost like when we first met. But better—because now there were two people living with me whom I care about so deeply. You seemed to heal so quickly in our presence, forgetting to wear your wedding ring, and you said you’d love—.” Tears choked Sherlock’s voice and he lifted his eyes from John again up to the ceiling, desperately trying to contain what little there was left to keep inside.
They got up from the sofa, carefully avoiding any kind of contact lest they ignite this special fire smoldering between them again. “I’ll take care of Rosie,” Sherlock said, sounding almost convincingly casual.
A voice came floating down the hallway to John’s incredulous ears, the words carried on it familiar but glazed with a new significance: “
Panting heavily, their lips broke contact for a second to catch their breath as Sherlock straddled John’s hips and flung his arms around his neck. John stared up at him in pure adoration, carefully mapping out the exact colour and texture of Sherlock’s flushed cheeks and hooded eyes. The voice in his head—the one that had whispered about proper appearances and decency, shame and guilt, all these years—scoffed at how smitten and probably dopey he must look at the moment. Yet, Sherlock’s heavy breathing and John’s own hammering heartbeat easily rendered it inaudible. For once, it couldn’t make him give a fuck.
John’s heart tingled at the thought that Sherlock went to such lengths to ensure that his little daughter was happy. The way the two had bonded over the past few months astounded and enthused him. At times, he was almost jealous when he watched them play or snuggle on the sofa. Yesterday, he had come home from his job at the clinic and found Sherlock kneeling in front of the tub, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, while Rosie splashed about happily in the water. At the sight, John had been convinced that his heart would burst. How could one body contain such enormous amounts of pure joy?
Hesitantly sipping at his own pint, Sherlock’s mouth curls in disgust the tiniest bit.
Sherlock caught only half of the pleasantries and stories about their kids John and Angelo exchanged. He focused all his mental energy on regaining control over his heartbeat and breathing as long as John was still occupied with something else. He needed to calm down, to keep his composure or John would mistake his nervousness for discomfort or worse. Counting the duration of each breath he took—
“Oh, come on, don’t act like you didn’t get them,” John said, cramming his phone back into his pocket and retreating to a safe position several feet away from Sherlock. “You declined my call, so I know you had your phone on you.”
… I’m pretty sure that I won’t be able to stop.”
He fills the coffee into the mugs and returns to the bedroom, his mind fixed on the next hour.
A shiver trickles down Sherlock’s spine at the touch. He holds his breath as his hand mirrors the motion of its own volition, his fingers burying themselves in the soft hair behind John’s ear.
The first hesitant canting of his hips made Sherlock’s eyes roll back in their sockets, the deep rumbling of his moans saturating the air. Every new movement inside of Sherlock sent waves of unbearable pleasure through John’s veins, a cataclysm waiting to happen. Sherlock squirmed and shuddered under him, his calves encircling John’s waist, keeping him locked in. He couldn’t get away now, even if he had been able to stop.
s against Sherlock’s trembling body until he calmed down eventually, lips and eyes seeking John in desperate relief—as if Sherlock had been lost in darkness, trusting John to strike a match in front of him, the light guiding him home.
He stroked Sherlock through his orgasm, taking his time afterward to hold and gently soothe him. The intensity of the emotional impact this experience had on Sherlock didn’t seem to decrease with time. He was again barely responsive, tears glistening in his eyes, his heartbeat fluttering like an agitated squab chick. John murmured ‘
His eyes meet Sherlock’s, glistening wetly.
For a moment, he remains deeply immersed in his thoughts. When he speaks again, his words flow hastily, as if they can’t wait to be spoken: “It really wasn’t though, don’t you think? A choice, I mean. Mary is the first woman in my life that… I’ve had girlfriends but while Sherlock was still around—he managed to scare them off pretty easily—” he laughs nervously—”or I did, I don’t know. I probably didn’t even mind at the time. I mean, Sherlock and I, we were always busy with some case or other and he’s right when he says that the Work doesn’t leave much room for anything else. And, honestly, I was fine with that. I liked my life like that. I could’ve gone on for… I wouldn’t’ve minded…”
Still, Sherlock is enormously grateful for Lestrade’s contribution and more so for his silence. He hasn’t let on about remembering anything Sherlock has said to him that day after the pub, apart from the same knowing look that Mrs Hudson annoyingly displays when she can’t help herself.
At the same time, he’s completely aware that he can’t. He just can’t.
“I love you so much, future husband” John said, in lieu of all the things he couldn’t put into words.
When it was his turn again, Marcus said: “Never have I ever fantasized about someone in this room.” He gave Sherlock a suggestive look and took a sip.
“I went to close the door and looked out into the garden. And I— I—saw a… leg.” Voice collapsing under the weight of her tears again, she curled in on herself.
“For once, just stay quiet and deduce,” Lestrade hissed under his breath. Grudgingly, John and Sherlock took a back seat and merely watched as a man in a chequered dressing gown opened the door.
When all their bags are finally packed and John falls into bed that night, he equally wishes for and dreads the next morning. Once again, Mary’s voice haunts his head: “Right, you know when you’re scared of something, you start wishing it sooner just to get it all going?”
The determination in his voice sent another surge of heat through John’s veins until all his hair stood on ends in longing—not for the rest of the night, but the rest of his life. They had each other now. And they had weeks and months and years, a lifetime together.
Maybe, he muses, it’s because he has gotten so used to Sherlock not getting along with anyone, being cruel and callous even with people who admired him. John had been an outlier, a lucky exception, and Greg had simply welcomed the good influence he had on Sherlock, without questioning its source. He had witnessed Sherlock finally finding a friend and failed to recognize how different another kind of love might look for someone like the genius. But the signs were there, just in other shapes than expected.
“Jesus, this is the part I definitely could live without,” John sighed as they made their way through the crowd on Oxford Street, charged with several shopping bags which hampered their progressing considerably. In this turmoil of passing people, Sherlock didn’t even have to reduce his walking pace to match John’s shorter stride as usual since they both could only move at a snail’s pace.
John absent-mindedly traced the scars on Sherlock’s back, a constant reminder of the pain he had endured for him, and buried his nose in his dark luxurious curls. His scent had lingered in the air of 221B as long as John could remember, had enriched the atmosphere and driven him perfectly insane. Now that he was able to inhale the enchanting perfume in all its overwhelming richness he couldn’t believe that he was granted such a pleasure. Sherlock was finally his.
Collapsing onto him, John released Sherlock’s hands which at once came around his body in a tight embrace. John felt himself slip out of Sherlock but didn’t dare to move since the arms and legs around him still held on in almost desperate determination.
. It couldn’t be clearer. John lets out a disbelieving puff of air—half laughter, half sigh. Why has it taken him so long to see it?
He smokes the first cigarette right there on the spot, the nicotine welcomed back in his bloodstream like an old friend. Instantly, his mind seems clearer, sharper. The nervous quiver leaves him with every bit of deliciously blueish smoke entering his lungs.
Sherlock waits, unable to speak or move, his eyes fixed on John. His heart is beating heavily in his throat, a second away from leaping out of him.
Home.
“Wow, her grammar is abhorrent. Who doesn’t know the difference between your and you’re?” Sherlock said after reading the texts with quite a smug smile on his face.
“Good night, Sherlock.”
After quickly fixing his hair, he opens the door and finds—
“True but—”
“I’m—um—waiting for you.” John steps aside as Sherlock unlocks the door. “I really needed to see you.”
But Sherlock was practically pushing himself onto John’s finger, a long, fantastically filthy moan soaring from the deepest valley of his chest. The sound made John’s very bones ring with lust. God, he could spend hours, days, weeks with Sherlock in his arms like that, impaling himself eagerly on his finger. Just watching him made precum leak from John’s momentarily abandoned cock.
Sherlock turned around, feeling the sparks fly from his eyes: “You’re finally asking the right questions.”
Please don’t do anything dangerous.
It had been years since Sherlock last thought about it. Well, not quite. Ever since the Norfolk case, memories were crowding behind his forehead, pushing to the surface, singly piercing into his consciousness when he let his guards down. Now, with his defences scrunched to dust, everything threatened to come crashing down on him. Sherlock quickened his steps, falling into a half-run, and tried to ascribe his hammering heartbeat to the physical activity. His lungs stung as he blindly followed his legs wherever they would lead him. His feet drummed on the pavement wet from melted snow, but no matter how much he accelerated their rhythm, there was no escaping. You couldn’t outrun a tidal wave.
“Me too, honey. I’m not especially in the mood to be yelled at. I bet Greg won’t be too excited about our little un-supervised adventure.”
Taken by surprise, Sherlock took a moment to answer. “It just… made me so angry that she assumed you weren’t doing what’s best for Rosie. She shouldn’t—no one should be allowed to talk to you like this. Not on my watch.”
Mrs Hudson’s force-feeding efforts finally seem to have resulted in something resembling an ordinary person’s metabolism, Sherlock thinks in disgust. He has to thwart that immediately.
Sherlock bridged the distance between them with outstretched arms, flung them around John’s neck and planted a kiss on his cheek. His eyes sparkled with excitement as he met John’s in the mirror.
“Bloody hell, Greg, I’ve already made my decision,” John bristles, straining his voice to a hiss and stepping out onto the pavement. The stone beneath his bare feet feels oddly unstable. “I am married now. I can’t—I… This is just cruel; do you know that? You can’t just come to my home the day I’m leaving for my honeymoon and—and drop this bomb here. What were you thinking?!”
And if anything made the walls break, it was the rank. John secured Sherlock’s wrists above his head again with one hand while increasing the speed and depth of his thrusts significantly. Sherlock’s moans grew into cries and curses, but the rational part of John’s brain was already too far gone to listen or care. He only answered with a growl and buried his teeth once more in Sherlock’s sensitive skin.
Greg was next: “Never have I ever kissed someone of the same sex.”
“From the moment I first saw John and Sherlock together,” Greg begins, his voice cheerful and fond,” on this day six years ago, I knew their story would be one to remember, one people will still read about in a hundred years. Their story will be aggrandised and glorified to epic extents, because, let’s be honest, who would believe that these two are mere humans?”
But Mary isn’t the problem. She has welcomed Sherlock and the Work with open arms, more so than John. Yes, she’s been as supportive and understanding as he hadn’t even dared hope.
corresponded much better to his momentary mood.
Greg visibly has to push himself to utter the next words: “So, promise me this, okay: If you’re happy with Mary, unconditionally and final, if she is the One, truly the one person you have always wanted to be with, then destroy it. Don’t look at it, just destroy it.”
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed, the word barely audible over his heartbeat.
Seeing Sherlock out of control was always a worrying sight but tonight John felt a strange sense of guilt because Sherlock had screamed
“You have?” John’s voice was nothing more than a hungry panting.
And John? He never struck Greg as someone inclined this way but, well, people are complicated. But he had decided to propose to Mary, so the whole matter was resolved. At least that’s what Greg thought.
“I actually didn’t just ask you here to meet Rosie,” he said after the waitress had brought them two cups of coffee. He licked his lips, readying himself for another confession, another redemption. “I wanted to see you— because I need to apologize, Harry.”
A dozen questions press against his forehead, indistinguishable forms in the fog of his thoughts, but he doesn’t think he can voice them quite yet. He just stares at the grainy picture of the telly and listens as a past Sherlock starts to sing.
John bites his lip.
“Harry,” John said calmly, raising one hand to stop her from ranting on, “I’m trying to tell you something here.”
Her tone is bordering on contemptuous and John wonders if she knows what a sore spot her words have just pressed on.
“I wasn’t sure till John’s wedding day when you gave that speech. That was basically a love letter. Even a blind person could’ve seen how much you adore him,” Greg said and gave Molly a side glance.
“Don’t look so excited. It’s the normal blubbering,” John dismissed it with a chuckle, captured by Sherlock’s enthusiasm.
“No leads then?”
As soon as he slackens the reins, his mind tries to drift off to those perilous realms he eschews and yet feels drawn to.
For a few minutes, uncomfortable silence wraps around them, a tight, damp coat pressing on their mouths and ears until everything is rendered grey. The pub around them, gradually filling with people and laughter, is drowned out to a faded buzzing, to white noise Greg barely registers. A stale, ash-like taste sneaks onto his tongue as he swallows again.
Another nod and something Sherlock can only describe as a pitying smile flits over John’s face as he plays with his teacup. “I think I do.”
Mrs. Hudson audibly cleared her throat and made the men interrupt their kissing once more.
He wants to, needs to get closer. Yet, he doesn’t know how, doesn’t know what to do.
John raised his brows in silent question and put the spoon down.
“Fine.”
Sherlock looked down at him, his features fogged with sorrow. The sight took John aback. What was there to be sad about?
“I. am. not. leaving.” To corroborate his words, he climbed back into bed, pulled his blanket up to his waist and crossed his arms, pouting.
Still, no answer. John fixated the screen as if the sheer intensity of his stare would suffice to coax a reaction out of Sherlock.
this:
A new wave of relief that washed over John at Mycroft’s negation ran dry as fast as it had come. Worse? Worse than Sherlock taking drugs again? John’s thoughts careened in his head. What had happened in the hours he had been gone?
“Another baby?”
John first noticed it one afternoon when he came back from Tesco’s: the little green boughs hanging on the ceiling, only a few steps behind the glass doors connecting the kitchen to the sitting room. At the sight of it, he almost dropped the groceries.
If the alcohol hasn’t substantially altered his memory, he has told Greg how he had decided to marry Mary. There was nothing alarming about that.
And yet, hanging on barely more than threads, John carried on, ever the brave soldier. Every day, every night, he marched onward with bleeding feet and steely stubbornness, Sherlock always by his side to catch him as soon as his legs would ultimately give in.
It wasn’t the first time someone aggressively flirted with Sherlock but somehow tonight it neither irritated nor confused him—not because Marcus was objectively a handsome and amiable bloke but because John drew demonstratively closer to him every time he overheard their conversation. Sherlock adored this inclination to protectiveness and was, therefore, careful not to discourage Marcus as to not remove the object of John’s jealousy.
Sherlock was secretly glad that he could avoid most of the drinking during the game. Even with a nourished and rested transport, his tolerance for alcohol seemed to be much lower than everyone else’s. And he was far from sobering up since John made sure to replace his empty cup with a full one every half hour or so. Every time he got up from his chair next to Sherlock, Marcus would seize the opportunity and strike up a conversation, obviously trying to make up for the lack of information the game offered. In his obvious interest in him paired with the disregard of his less polite comments, he reminded Sherlock of Janine. He wasn’t sure if that was a good or a bad thing.
“I may not be the greatest at picking up on emotional cues but even I can tell that something’s on your mind, Sherlock. Don’t you remember what we promised at Angelo’s?”
“Because Greg invited us and I promised we’d show up,” John replied and checked his hair in the mirror above the sink. He, too, was wearing a button-down shirt and a pair of jeans Sherlock was particularly fond of. That man aged like a fine wine. “Besides, I couldn’t stand the thought of falling asleep on the sofa by 10 pm. It’s New Year’s Eve, after all. I just want to go out and feel young again, for one night, Sherlock. Lately, all I’ve been thinking about is nappies and teething and if Rosie should’ve started to walk by now. Dear God, I just want one night off, just getting a little drunk and talk to adults about adult stuff and be a little reckless and silly. So, can you, just for this one night, have a few drinks with me and chat with people without complaining? For me?”
John made his way over to him and caught Sherlock’s lips in a kiss. His eyes fell shut, every sinew of his body vibrating as if John played their anthem on them. Who needed instruments anyway?
“Thank you. I’ll be quick.”
—“disappeared, I was devastated. We all were. How can you still not know how much we all care?”
“I’m just saying, it’s your first time. That is a huge deal. And we’re both a little tipsy.”
Sherlock, who had seemingly been too lost in the feeling of John’s naked form against his own to process anything else, suddenly flinched under his touch. John retreated as fast as if he had burned his fingers on the skin underneath, searching for Sherlock’s eyes in another surge of painful clarity.
Sherlock turned to him, his frustration reaching the boiling point. “Yes, but you’re all idiots!” he yelled, eyes as cold and piercing as he could muster. How could anyone believe that this wasn’t all his own doing, his personal failure?
But what can he do now? He’s made a decision, a promise, a commitment. He’s made a vow, mere hours ago, for better or worse. It’s not about what he wants anymore. He has to think about his wife, about the two of them and their life together.
“Right, I’m sorry,” John said seriously with a gentle stroke across Sherlock’s shoulder. “I haven’t even apologized for the whole thing at the park yet. I was such an idiot. I just panicked when you started talking about me quitting my job and you just looked so adorable in the snow and I guess I tried to convince myself that I didn’t feel attracted to you by hitting on anyone else really. That must’ve been horrible for you. Only when we got home and you didn’t talk to me anymore, I realized what a dick move that was.”
“Thank you for doing this,” John said softly as he sat down next to him, his voice thick with honest gratitude and a subtle knowing undertone that made Sherlock question the effectiveness of his Christmas ruse. While John’s deductive skills could never reach his own abilities, his emotional intelligence outweighed Sherlock’s thousandfold.
John followed silently like a shadow as they descended to the ground floor where Jason’s parents waited. Greg led them into a spacious sitting room and kept discretely in the background as they approached two sofas and additional armchairs grouped around a massive coffee table in front of a fireplace.
“I’m so sorry, love, I’ll be more careful,” he promised and soothingly rubbed the other man’s shoulders. They locked eyes and, to John’s relief, a smirk spread over Sherlock’s face.
“Why did you say that?” John asked in a tone Sherlock couldn’t quite place—confused but soft and… hopeful.
. He could only hope that John had already been asleep, even if his breathing pattern and pulse had suggested otherwise. He would probably never know. After all, they didn’t talk about any of this, ever. Even if he had wanted to ask John about it, or at least observe any changes in his behavior, he didn’t have the opportunity since John had got up early to pick up Rosie, leaving Sherlock alone to be tormented by his thoughts.
Office hours:
Now, he wasn’t sure what had disrupted his unconsciousness and slowly rubbed his face in confusion. Then, he heard it again: An agitated cry, faintly evocative of his own name, coming from Sherlock’s room. In the twinkling of an eye, John was wide awake, sprang from the sofa and sprinted down the hall to the younger man, almost stumbling over his oversized trousers. The door loudly rebounded on the wall behind it as John pushed it open and turned on the lights. He all but expected a dark hooded figure to cower over the bed strangling Sherlock.
. “Not bad, for a first draft. Needs a bit of work though, in my opinion.”
Sherlock supressed the urge to shake his head to get rid of the haze and took a deep breath instead. The roaring engines and the piercing scent of imminent snow washed away at least some of his drowsiness. Next to him, John raised his shoulders against the freezing January air. They had better get home.
Sergeant Donovan knelt down beside her and gently nudged her shoulder. “Laney?”
“I was in the military, guys. We got terribly bored between missions,” John said confidently and shrugged with a grin.
“I see that.”
At the sight, John’s stomach turns in some kind of sympathy nausea. Or maybe it is just the mere mentioning of the pregnancy that makes his insides crawl with discomfort.
—made an apologetic grimace but rolled his eyes at the kid he was questioning as soon as Donovan turned her back to him again. The scruffy-looking girl tried to supress a smile but couldn’t quite keep the amusement out of her face. Sherlock, too, felt his lips twitch before he followed John into the DI’s office.
“Do you have any idea what you’re doing to me when you flirt with those women? The thought that you might actually fall in love with someone again, leave me again, take Rosie with you—I can’t bear it. I don’t know what else I have to do to prove that I am a worthy option for you,
He, John, a father.
The words had shaken something loose in Sherlock’s chest, something that had been stuck in a dark corner, eschewing the light of consciousness.
He couldn’t take it anymore and, yet, didn’t want it to ever end. John’s eyes, fixed on him with an animalistic voluptuousness, were promises of cool waters, of refreshment and cleansing, but every torched fibre of Sherlock’s body rebelled against the prospect of being extinguished. Because once he allowed John to end the torture, there would be nothing left but ashes. Desperately, Sherlock clung to John’s body, his fingers pleading, begging for mercy and more, more, more all at once.
Outside, John gave a deep, weary sigh. Sherlock placed a hand on his back, a silent offer of rest if he needed it. A
John finally turned around. “
“Impossible.”
. “The police picked her up, she’s at New Scotland Yard right now.”
He shouldn’t have had all those pints with his rugby mates. These guys drink way too hard for him. Hell, he can barely remember when and how he made it to the hotel room.
“Oh, it really is my birthday,” Sherlock dead-panned with an eye roll but weighed the package in his hand, intrigued. “Weighs 200 grams, I’d estimate—,” he said, turning the package over and eyed it from all sides, “—approximately 14,5 x 8 x 4 centimeters.” He raised the box to his ear and shook it slightly. From inside came a faint rattling sound, confirming his assumption.
John didn’t answer. What was he supposed to say? Of course, he was holding back. How could he expose Sherlock to such dangers? This was new territory for him and John needed to protect him, even—no, especially—from himself.
And she also knows that Sherlock knows.
) but this is as far from his area of expertise as can get. It’s worth a try.
“I’ll go have a steam, if you don’t mind.”
“I didn’t.” Sherlock’s voice was barely audible. He seemed to shrink, to slowly shrivel to a ghostly image of the brilliant energetic man John knew.
—a bond being forged.
“If you can say that with a straight face, alright.”
Sherlock, you know I’m not good
“We don’t think so, Cal,” John assured him, making a tentative step towards the boy. “We’ll vouch for you. All you have to do is give me your gun.”
“Oh sure, you know I’m always happy to have her.”
Sherlock must have recognized the glimmer of understanding in his eyes. He began to sway in John’s embrace, to move them to the music. John brought one of his hands up over his purfled chest and entwined their fingers, while the other remained around Sherlock’s waist, pressing their bodies close together. This was the way it should be. They should’ve been dancing like this all along. John joined Sherlock in the chorus, enticing him to smile even brighter:
He had dismissed it, of course, had told her and Sherlock—and himself—that nothing would change because, deep down, he had been scared of the mere idea.
Feet hammering on the pavement, the stranger turned into another side street. Sherlock reached the crossing first and found himself almost colliding with a young couple. The whole street was crawling with people, blocking his way and sight.
“What’s wrong with free dinner?”
John would’ve been sure he had only dreamt up this strange nocturnal encounter but a few nights later it happened again. And then again. Sherlock stole into his room and into his bed, and then they just lay there, aware of the other’s waking presence until John finally fell asleep again only to wake alone. They didn’t talk about it, didn’t even dare to let on about this odd shift in their habits. When had they ever talked about the important stuff?
“Isn't it?”
But that was before everything had changed. Before Sherlock had gone and come back. Before John had gotten married and Sherlock had been shot. Before Mary had jumped in front of him, had spared Sherlock a second bullet and given her life in return. Before her loss had rippled through the already stained fabric of John’s existence and torn it to shreds.
“You don’t?”
Cal cowered in the corner, his still childlike features wrecked with too much horror, too much panic, too many bad decisions—John would never forget his face.
?” John teasingly stretched the name into ridiculous lengths and Sherlock all but growled.
He appreciated the fact that Sherlock didn’t broach the subject but simply acknowledged that John was a little quiet and sad at times. Instead, he seemed determined to be less of a Grinch than usual and entertained the teething Rosie as well as he could to take John’s mind off of his grief.
. “But, Cal, don’t you think if Jason loved you this much that he wouldn’t’ve wanted you to end up in jail? We’ll explain everything and if you cooperate, I’m sure—”
“Mary’s request to save you by putting myself in lethal danger came as a welcome excuse to just give in to the urge to destroy myself—because either way, there was nothing else I could do. If you wouldn’t come to save me, there was nothing left to live for, anyway. But you came. And I hoped again. That one day I could win back what we had lost along the way and in all the mess we have been through.”
“Beaumont? This isn’t—?” John let the question hang in the air.
John walked a few meters down the street, just to be sure, while Sherlock tried to decide whether he was impressed or frustrated.
From underneath a smorgasbord of documents, he retrieves a tightly folded piece of paper. The edges are slightly worn already from having been handled so many times by tentative fingers.
God, Johnny, please tell me that everything’s alright!
The next time around, you build yourself back up on something predictable, something sturdy.
Probably, Mary had been right. Probably, Sherlock had been terrified.
“You don’t know?” Sherlock shrieks, the pain in his chest almost overwhelming. “Why did you come here then?”
This chapter's song:
He takes a few steps and a deep breath, letting sink in what he had accepted as a fact for three weeks now.
It should’ve been him.
Just in time for Rosie’s afternoon playtime, both of them were on their feet again. Mrs. Hudson had won through and cooked them a lovely meal. Only when the delicious smell of roasted meat and vegetables had floated up the staircase, John had realised how ravenous he was. Sherlock must’ve felt the same since he emptied his plate without a single word of complaint. He even did the dishes while John sat on the floor and played with Rosie. Being shot did have upsides then.
As a doctor, John has no illusions about the various ways their precautions could’ve failed. Those things happen.
“So, how're things?” he asked, consciously keeping his voice interested and relaxed. With Harry, he always struggled to hit the right tone. Her disarming honesty made every conversation a minefield of possible conflicts and awkwardness.
And it was what he had life expected to be. The delusion of companionship died the day Redbeard did and stayed dead for the longest time.
Before Sherlock could put up a fight, all three had hugged him and John, their faces beaming with joy shared among friends. The cold winter air pressing against the windows jealously watched the group laughing and chatting, unable to penetrate this bubble of blissful, genuine warmth. If birthdays always were like this, Sherlock might get used to it.
Hungry? Might be.
That John was the one driving them back from Norfolk was nothing short of extraordinary. But the last two days had been nothing if not extraordinary.
“The one you had Molly give to me after Mary’s death.”
“I.. ehm… haven’t really thought about it. I don’t know any decent pet names, to be honest—none that fit you at least.” While he still looked up, the first few snowflakes began to dance around them, little wet dots settling on his nose and forehead. Sherlock closed his eyes, confident that John would safely guide him, and let the snowflakes get caught in his lashes. “You’re just my… my John.” His voice gave out under the weight of his worship.
“Usually?” enquired John and something dawned on him. “How often does this happen?”
“Amazing what the boss staring down at you can do for general productivity,” Greg replied wearily and rubbed his neck as if unconsciously trying to shield himself from inspecting glares. “Not that anything useful has come out of it yet.”
“But what if I lose my temper again? What if I hurt him again? What if—What if I’m turning into Dad?” His voice died out, having given sound to a fear that haunted John since that fateful day in the hospital. He had been so cruel, so merciless, that the thought of it chilled his own blood. How could he expose Sherlock to something as dangerous as him? And what about Rosie? Would he hurt her, too, if she only provoked him enough? How could he be sure that he would never snap like that again, that he didn’t become someone his own family was constantly scared of?
, the way you pronounce it, only you.”
“Promise.”
It wasn’t me who just stormed out, it wasn’t me who didn’t pick up his bloody phone! Have you any idea how worried I was? And what do you mean without a word? I’ve told you that I’d be out and that I’d come back to talk things over. That is more than you had the courtesy to tell me.”
The rest of the sentence was swallowed by a deafening sound, the howl of an animal struck by a poisoned arrow, the outcry of a living being that knew death was coming for them. Only the pain in his strained throat made Sherlock’s last few rationally thinking brain cells realize it was him screaming. There was something cool and steady crashing into his knees and shins, then his hands and elbows. Somewhere in the distant corners of his mind, Sherlock recognized the thin, worn out carpet beneath his fingers.
“Yeah,
“I can’t tell you,” Laney wailed, repeating it over and over while red-hot tears streamed down her cheeks.
John couldn’t help but smile at the expression, Sherlock’s voice ghosting through his veins.
At last, his brain decided to respond to John’s words and kicked his body into action. He rushed out of the bathroom and yelled for Mrs. Hudson until she finally—hours later, Sherlock was sure—came hurrying up the stairs in her nightgown. Her face mirrored the alarm Sherlock couldn’t wipe off his own features. Yet, as he just cried out that John was sick, her fearful expression eased into slight concern laced with something almost resembling amusement. How was John being in pain
together, and still, nothing has changed for you. Except for Mary, you haven’t been able to keep a woman around for more than two months since we met and still you cling so desperately to your
Carefully, John slid out from under his covers and tiptoed out of the room, determined to let his friend sleep as long as possible. He climbed the stairs and peeped into Rosie’s room, grateful to see that she was still slumbering as well.
Mary opens her mouth and closes it again before she simply says: “I’ll save you a spot.”
After Sherlock’s told them Mary is pregnant.
“I already have a family.”
It’s Sherlock.
Hello everyone! :)
After a few silent minutes in the chilly air that gave Sherlock’s brain the opportunity to adjust to the new high and regain full mental capacity, he said: “You… keep calling me that.”
If it’s already too late—
“Alright, text him back,” Sherlock gave in.
Sherlock threw on a t-shirt and his midnight-blue dressing gown and followed him. John had already brought Rosie down from her room and heated a bottle for her. While the little girl had breakfast, they both tried to avoid even the most innocent of touches. But it was no use; like planets caught in an orbit, they were always drawn back to each other. How could you fight such gravity?
John relied on Sherlock more than on anyone else—as a partner on cases, as a friend, as Rosie’s godfather, as a flatmate, a
“Yeah, well, about that…” John reached for his jacket and pulled his phone out. He opened another chat and showed Sherlock his texting history once more:
Letting his gaze stray downward, he admired the traces he had left on Sherlock’s skin last night, decorating him with his lips, adorning his body with multicoloured tokens of his desire. His worries not yet entirely vanished, John looked up into Sherlock’s eyes again, searching for signs of distress. This morning, they were of the soft green-blue colour of calm Caribbean shores, where warm waters washed little pearlescent seashells onto white beaches. John cocked his head, his brows furrowed in a silent question, needing to be sure that Sherlock was okay.
“Well, what is she saying then? It wasn’t Dada or Daddy or Papa or anything,” John said, shrugging and feeling a little knot form in his guts. He really ought to spend more time with his daughter. Maybe then he would be important enough in her life to be her first word.
The door falls shut downstairs and Sherlock is left alone, his heartbeat echoing in the empty flat.
. I expected that, after her, your standards would be raised but, apparently, you haven’t changed a bit.”
“I don’t know, okay?” John shouts, his voice pleading and throaty. “The only thing I do know is that I can’t wait any longer, not a second. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve wanted this since we first met and I never in a thousand years had dreamed you would want it too. How could you?”
So, John refrained from deepening their touch, from sparking something less chaste but infinitely more dangerous—no matter how much he wanted to. Sherlock’s form pressed against his was heaven and hell all at once. Because this wasn’t meant to be more. Even when the impulse to place a kiss on Sherlock’s exposed collar bone grew into painful urgency, John restrained himself, repeating the same words in his mind over and over again:
Sherlock is floating, carried by a cosy cloud of bliss. His blood bubbles like the champagne being poured out as he watches the people he loves gathered around the long table. Their voices and soft music fill the room, melting into a pleasant buzzing sound in Sherlock’s ears, like bees on a spring meadow.
“We are not a couple, Sherlock!” John roared, raising his fists and eyes to the ceiling as if he was trying to convince a stubborn God or the universe itself of his heterosexuality.
He tries to suppress a grin. “I just… didn’t know you could.”
Sherlock felt some warmth spread in his chest despite his freezing environment. Their first dinner at Angelo’s was one of his fondest memories. “That’d be nice indeed.”
“I don’t help you with cases for the money, Sherlock.”
“Of course.”
The tiniest prickling of guilt made its way down his throat but it didn’t grease it well enough to speak up. John would have to wait a little longer.
Warm lips met Sherlock’s in a tender kiss and sent an avalanche through his body. Every fibre, every bone, every cell seemed to be filled and overflowing with John, only John. Sherlock let himself sink into the kiss, eyes falling shut and hands holding on to the only fixture left in the universe.
“Oh bloody—,” John began, then raising his voice. “Police! Out of the way!” he yelled, his voice radiating authority. Sherlock’s heart gave a jolt completely unrelated to physical strain. “Thief! Someone stop him!”
“What did you do?” John finished his question, his voice barely audible above the drumming of his heartbeat that had been startled into a hard, anxious rhythm.
Sherlock’s heart danced in relief as he sank back into the shredded remains of his flat. He let out a dark, velvety chuckle from the depths of his chest. Soon, this would be his,
His body aches with the knowledge what this something has to be, the memory still fresh in his cells even though he has gone so long without it.
“I’ve just fed Rosie and put her down for her nap,” he said in a low voice, shying away as John reached out for him. “Don’t. She spat up all over me. I need a shower.”
John is right. Sherlock has no doubt about it at this point. It has taken him long enough to realise and longer still to accept it but, with all the data at hand, there is no longer room for any other conclusion.
The shower has fogged up the mirror and John wipes it clean with his sleeve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, I don’t know what kind of movies you’ve watched but the majority of dates don’t end that way,” John said as he ran his hands over Sherlock’s arms before turning to the door, his voice still vibrating with amusement. “Most times, a good-night kiss is as far as people go on the first date. And only if it was a good date.”
“Does it hurt?” Sherlock asked, eyeing him in the bathroom mirror as John swallowed his pain meds with a glass of water.
“It’s a tradition.”
Yes, another song featured in a TV series (that's half my playlist). I love this song/this version so much. And it gives you a clue to what's coming ;)
After breakfast, they retired to the sofa, Sherlock cuddling up to John in the most natural manner, and entertained Rosie with one of her plush toys. Her excited squeals mixed with Sherlock’s dark, chocolaty chuckle made John’s chest almost burst with unbearable happiness. This little family was everything he ever could’ve wished for.
Just a song, a pathetic attempt at expressing what must now be painfully obvious to John.
Sherlock's monologue is actually the thing that sparked this whole fic. It just kind of appeared to me one day and wanted to get onto (digital) paper. It was the first thing I've written in years (that's why I feel it is my worst chapter so far...) and I'm so glad I started again. You guys are amazing and I appreciate every single comment and kudos here! <3 <3 <3
“Someone tried to reanimate him,” John said, looking up from the blank face of Jason Beaumont.
“You wouldn’t.” Sherlock’s voice was matter-of-factly yet soft, but as John inhaled to form an objection he added with an adamantine stare from steely eyes: “No, listen to me: You wouldn’t. There’s nothing you can say or do to change my mind, John. I want to have sex with you like this, been wanting that for a very,
“I heard the smoke detector and thought—” Mrs Hudson, crossing the living room, halted with a surprised sound.
Suddenly, he wished the drive would go on like this forever, with skies like ink above and a slumbering detective snuggled up against him.
Preparing Sherlock was like dangling a juicy steak in front of a pack of starved hounds. John tried his best to keep his movements careful and calculated, aiming only at pleasing Sherlock without getting carried away by the intoxicating mixture of his moans and motions. But it was no use. A painful urge pooled in his groin, threatening to overwhelm him the first instance he let his reign slide.
This chapter reveals what John has been up to since Sherlock left 221B and resolves some of the pressing issues introduced so far. However, it is still emotionally exhausting (at least for me). Some of the issues are something I never had to deal with so please let me know if I handled them with the required amount of respect and geniality! I'm thankful for any kind of feedback :)
Sherlock had climbed over the bannister before another thought could cross his mind. The deep dark waters beneath called for him in a low enchanting rhythm. Jumping into the Thames in January must be a painful death; drowning and freezing simultaneously. But what were organ failure and lack of oxygen against the mental agony he endured right now. Pain remained pain. He didn’t deserve the blissful ending of an overdose.
For a moment, Sherlock was sure that unconsciousness would overwhelm him once more—too intense was this divine sensation, too heavenly for a mortal to experience. How could one human heart handle such colossal amounts of love? And if he was to be ground by the sheer weight of such affection, pulverised, atomised—Sherlock would happily accept his fate as long as John was with him. As long as John would stay.
Sherlock gave him an understanding smile and began to explain: “The preparatory steps should not differ that much between sexes except that you—”
“Of course, I’ll be alright,” Sherlock snaps back but doesn’t make any attempts to get off the sofa. He’s still staring at his knees, his curls hiding his face.
“No, she’s—”
Just as he puts on his button-down, the doorbell rings.
I'm finally back with the first chapter of the sequel to A Change of Heart! Hope you will enjoy this one, too :) Concrit is always welcomed, as are kudos and comments ;)
“Thank you.” John could barely hear his own words hitting the ground. He closed his eyes and caught a single tear with his curling lips. After this day, he would have used up his tear contingent for the whole year.
.” John’s voice became more confident and Sherlock no longer fought the adoration that shone from his face.
“I thought I’ve made myself clear, love: It was never about the cases. It’s always been you. I’d follow you anywhere, on a secret international spy mission or the dullest office job you can find. You’re not getting rid of me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The streetlights made the pursuit easier but their prey had a significant head start. They chased him through a tangle of smaller streets, their hot breaths forming angry clouds in the winter air. Sherlock’s lungs were on fire.
With an uneasy look over John’s shoulder, he shifts his weight from one leg to the other.
He hadn’t thought he would ever have children, hadn’t really wanted any either. Not after witnessing what a father who isn’t up to the task can do to a child.
Back in the sitting room, he collapsed on the couch and tried to gather his thoughts. Sherlock’s apparently regular nightmares had disturbed him with their intensity and violence. Something needed to be done. But what? Sherlock, the obstinate bastard he was, would certainly refuse to do any kind of therapy. Before John could engross the thought about a future course of action, his stomach growled demandingly.
“It always is,” Sherlock replies in a low voice and swallows as John’s tongue darts out to wet his lips.
John stands in the doorway, the early morning sun uncomfortably hot on his heated face. His eyes follow Greg’s car down the street but even after it has already disappeared from sight he can’t seem to move.
I look up, surprised. Of course I am. You never apologize, Sherlock. You never have. Have I broken through, Sherlock? All those barriers, that facade of never feeling, have I seen through it? But then it strikes me. It isn't me. It's never me, is it? With you, at least. It's John. Always been him, come to think of it. He's changed you, hasn't he? Can you feel now, Sherlock? And what do you feel? Do you love him? I suppose you do.
He thought of the immense change that had already come into his life, the change that was to come. He didn't bother thinking about one thing though: how life would be once all of this was over. But 'this' had barely begun, and so such thoughts could be done away with for now.
The air was knocked out of him as he realised fully the meaning of never seeing Sherlock again after a month.
Then reminded himself he didn't have to feel guilty, he wasn't
"What? That really can't be true" John was looking at Sherlock incredulously, "this man, a junkie?"
"What?! We're not going to follow these imbecilic rules of yours, Mycroft. A whole week
Silence.
“Oh,” John let out, subconsciously glancing upwards towards the flat above him. Great.
And oh how wrong he was.
Before you leave, I see your eyes for a moment, glistening in a stray ray of light. They're angry and hurt. And not looking at me, as if you were unable to.
Sherlock continued looking at him curiously.
It seemed as though, no matter what universe or branch of reality, John Watson would always be a puzzle for Sherlock.
And for those of you who are wondering where the fuck has Mycroft gone, he'll be there soon.
I want to thank him, John, for so many things. The most for helping me become sober. And for making you believe in me to do it. It's one of the things that I thought could never happen. Not after I had broken your trust. Not after so many times. Not after that day.
For a moment, you are silent, and I know you're thinking of those dark days. And then you look at me and smile, the corners of your eyes crinkling.
He would play the CD whenever he felt low, along with the other things: the sound of John saying his name- John would always say it with a distinct warmth, making it seem like an endearment-, the recording of everything that had occurred on the day they met.
John and Mrs Hudson have tea, memories flood back and Mrs Hudson shows that she's the landlady of the world's only consulting detective after all.
psych--"
He then turned abruptly away, and John shaking his head, went on with his daily morning routine.
Sherlock stepped away from the door, and looked into the mirror. His reflection looked at him, before speaking. “Go handle the situation outside. John cannot know of your feelings, otherwise you can say goodbye to the friendship that you have just managed to save.”
You pout at this, as if being subjected to some great injustice. Ah, you always have a flair for the dramatic, don't you? I put my hand on the doorknob, and am about to turn it, when you quitely say to me,
Exiting his room, Sherlock put on what he hoped was a convincing smile, and said to John, " let us begin dancing with the music, shall we?" John was startled out of his thoughts, and smiled back, “Absolutely!”
He tried to call her twice, but she didn't pick up, and texted her to call him, worrying slightly. He hoped to god she wasn't drinking heavily with shady strangers in some dingy bar. The thought made him shudder and also feel slightly guilty. He felt that he should have been there for her, but then again, he had been there for her plenty of times, only for her to go back to her old ways and show everyone that the drinking was more important than everything, even Clara.
"You, Sherlock, were a changed man, once you met John Watson. Very subtle changes at first, but more prominently as we moved on. You had, to my surprise, kept completely clear of drugs, and had begun to eat food, however occasionally. It had appeared to me, that this John Watson, your flat mate, was good influence after all. But then, Sherlock, I saw small slips. Slips of sentiment. Of course, I had known that you could always feel, and had discouraged you from doing so. For your own benefit, I always told you. And yet, sentiment never hindered you in becoming what you are.What you're today. And perhaps even aided you in becoming it. The best detective in the world, one of the wisest men I know, and a younger brother of whom I will always be proud of. Dr Watson, you have saved the life of my brother, many times, broken his heart too, but always put it back together. And as I understand, Sherlock too has saved and broken you in many ways.  but it is in the institution of marriage to fight and disagree with each other. And come back to each other every time. Perhaps, it is not as much as a weakness, as it is a strength, then." He smiled lightly, and looked at the couple. "It has been a true pleasure to watch your distracting, childish rivalry evolve in to a distracting, childish courtship, and now into what I'm sure will be a distracting, childish marriage."
He unfolded the newspaper and looked up at the headline, in large, bold letters. 'RIDING OFF INTO THE
It sounds like it needs a little more explaining, and so I say, "For helping me believe that I could, you know, kick the bottle."
Before he could say anything further though, Sherlock budged in, now eyeing her with some suspicion and, much to John's irritation, said somewhat bluntly, "Why are you here?"
"You got the date then?" The other
"Ladies and gentlemen, when I first heard that these men," Lestrade pointed towards John and Sherlock, "had finally decided to come together, I was relieved." At this he received some chuckles, and he went on, "To see them like this after years of enduring the sexual tension between the two, we'd given up hope that they would ever see that the other idiot loved him too." At this people laughed properly, since they'd all gone through this feeling at some point around the two.
He instinctively almost woke Sherlock up to get off his lap, when he stopped to look at him.
Finally, having recovered enough to stand up, John got back on his feet, leaning on the wall a bit, then, shaking himself vigorously, he proceeded towards the door of 221 Baker Street, stopping in front of it.
You suddenly stop talking with Mrs Hudson. "Harry, are you okay?"
"Stand in front of the mirror, Sherlock." she said to him, and he obediently turned, so that they could look at his reflection.
John goes back to, and gives "making sure you never met the man you love" a try.
John took in a sharp breath at this, his eyebrows rising rapidly in a split second, before knitting together angrily.
"Yes." Mary said softly, and then something in her features changed. Her eyes seemed to melt into pools, and her smile eased into something mellow.
Sherlock froze at first, but then settled in too, with some semblance of genuinity. It wasn't very smooth for sure, but Mary smiled widely at them. "Absolutely perfect. Well, almost. You just need some practice."
(See the end of the chapter for
Plus, he'd not mentioned Sherlock's name or his or anyone's name in the whole of it, talking about Sherlock only as 'He' and the rest of it in terms only someone who knew them already would understand.
Downstairs, Sherlock had already woken up, and was at the window, though an acrid smell came from the containers in the set up on the kitchen table. The detective must have been up early, though John had no evidence that the man had slept at all. He had still been awake when John had gone to bed.
Their last night in the safety of Baker Street, protected from the press and the media and having to pretend they were a couple.
That night Sherlock ate nothing, and John didn't insist on him eating either. And when they went to bed, the room was painfully quiet.
"No, Sherlock. I need to know." There was fascination in John's eyes, as if he was scarcely believing what he understood and saw.
“Say John, any slow songs you know?” Sherlock asked, looking into his mobile phone.
Also, please give kudos and comments if you liked this one!!
another chapter is up!!! And fuck I'm writing so much in a chapter, is it too long? I hope it isn't.
"It was? Good to know."
But i was wrong John. You did love me. You still do, I know. It's just that you loved Sherlock too. And you always loved him a little more.
Mary simply smiled at Sherlock with not inconsiderable smugness, and said, "I am here to teach the two of you how to sit in each others' laps."
(See the end of the chapter for
The impulse to do things that he wouldn't have dared to do before-- nothing untoward-- just those stupid, mundane fantasies about domesticity.
John smiled at the accuracy of Sherlock's deduction, hitting the mark amidst all his lies.
Sherlock put down his test tube, as the approaching footsteps drew nearer. It only took him a second to analyse the gait, and another to determine who it was. The quick, firm, and periodic footsteps, with a military tinge to it spoke clearly of John Watson. He drew in a deep breath, and prepared himself for facing his old friend.
"Is she happy?" John knew what the question meant.
Also I was ill for a few days, so sorry for the late chapter!!
Sherlock was silent, his head towards the ground, his hands shaking uncontrollably.
"Hello Mycroft, now would you look at that, Sherlock wants to hear you."
At ten thirty, when John had just finished taking a bath and was about to continue his part of the research on Moriarty, and Sherlock still in his t-shirt and dressing-gown, Mrs Hudson came up to announce that another one of Mycroft's agents had arrived.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ignoring this, except for a condescending glare, Sherlock said, “Now, we just sway from side to side. This is not a very practical position at all, since very little dance can actually happen between two people. However, I believe that the proximity is a show of affection in such matters, and since you’re not much of a dancer, this should suit you just fine.” Saying this, he quickly relieved them of their position, noticing that he was enjoying it too much. His disastrous mind had also calculated their exact heights, and how john would fit perfectly in the crook of his neck, and also how comfortable he felt being held by john.
An image was suddenly projected on the wall behind Mycroft. Startled, John looked at it. It grew clearer as his eyes snapped into focus.
“I take it you...liked it?” John teased him, and Sherlock made a move to sit up out of annoyance.
For a split second, there was darkness and John felt as though he was floating in a void, before his feet were suddenly on the ground again and John buckled under the sudden pressure that gravity exerted on him.
Correcting his appearance a bit, and collecting himself, he walked out of his room, with no suggestion of anything that had happened inside it.
"Very good John!" Sherlock looked very pleased with him. John couldn't help but feel a little happy himself, though he knew it was stupid. "Yes,binoculars! But why would a reporter carry binoculars? He would want a picture of us, if he were one."
"No I mean I'm here to check if you're, you know, clean."
This is the epilogue, where I'll attempt to tie a few loose strings.
"No, I didn't leave on time. It's just that I haven't done this in a while. Well, ever since..." You stop, and then gulp, and then blink rapidly, as if trying to hold back tears. She must have been something, huh.
She remembered how the two had gotten together. So for a while she thought of that day, the first time she'd seen her dads kiss. She smiled widely, and then frowned a little. It wasn't all rainbows and unicorns.
"So, when will you began teaching me, sir." Sherlock's voice blatantly emphasized on the innuendo.
Is it wrong Sherlock, is it sinful to be jealous that I wasn't the one? The one to break this a barriers, the one to help you feel. The one you fall in love with.
"Well, if you are going to be calling me so often, and
Sherlock's mouth tightened like he hadn't wanted John to know this, his jaw jutting out in a pretense of indifference.
But it will get better????
-----------
"Yes, in a way. Come, sit here on the couch." She motioned to the couch and shifted Sherlock's chair to face it.
When him emotions threatened to collapse on him, he decided to leave and said abruptly to Sherlock, "Um I should get going. Bye."
They had moved into an almost embrace. For both of them, the music had faded into the background, still present, but not enough. In that moment, they just enjoyed the feeling of holding each other. Yes, their feelings weren’t platonic, yes, John was about to be married; but neither minded.
Changing the past would affect the future. Would his and Mary's relationship and as a consequence, Rosie's existence vanish from the face of the earth?
"Shut up, Sherlock!" John's voice was dangerously low, "You know that nobody can ever replace you. And it was never I who left you, you did." He pointed a finger accsusingly at Sherlock.
It wasn't a thought really, it was the passing of an electron from one neuron to another with the synapse just connected. And he pushed it away as fast as he could, not even allowing it to take the shape of words.
John hadn’t raided Sherlock’s bedroom for quite a while, too busy with Rosie and the cases, and because he hadn't thought about anything, he hadn't had a clue about the troubles stirring in Sherlock's brain.
Sherlock's lips.
And, by a stroke of luck, no nightmares plagued either man, and their breaths evened as the moon shone bright above them.
This is like a suicide note, he realised.
The phone was all but thrown at John, who caught it deftly, much to Sherlock's approval.
First lesson in Intimacy, First meeting with the media and their First night together.
Sherlock turned around and went to the desk, fuming. John walked up to him, standing beside him, arms folded across the chest, "That's okay Sherlock, I'll help you go cold turkey. We'll do it together."
Once everyone was settled, the priest began with the verses, and though Rosie tried to concentrate at first, some of the words went above her head, and she gave up. Instead, she looked at her dads, and smiled.
"That, was... Good."
I feel frustrated, with you, with myself, with everything.
“Do you think the son-in-law tried to drug him with these?” John asked Sherlock, as they surveyed the reports.
John looked away hastily, forcing the thought out of his mind, and pretended to look out of the window.
And so John said, "Yes." It was more than he would have done, but really, it was all he could do.
They began their routine, and at first john concentrated on their feet.
"Oh no, Dr Watson," Mycroft voice almost had a chuckle in it, " When I said you would do as you had earlier declared, I meant it quite literally."
"Oh fuck, I had completely forgotten." John rubbed his face, muttering
"Now you've gotten a cold. Were you this troublesome as a child too?”
He cried all night, a result of both pent up emotions and the drugs. He mourned his unrequited love, and it's extent, cried for the hurt it caused him, and for the hurt it was about to.
And so they fought over who had to pick up Rosie from daycare when they were on a case, or why Sherlock couldn’t take Rosie along for cases.
John put Rosie back on her blanket, and turning around, looked up at him. There he stood, tall, with those cheekbones, that lean figure, that alabaster skin and the most sharp and observant eyes John had ever seen. The great Sherlock Holmes.
At the end of the date, I have found out many things about John Watson. Some that he told me, and some that I picked up. I know that he's a retired war veteran, currently a practicing doctor. I know that he has a limp in his leg, apparently psychosomatic. I know that he likes to wear jumpers, and he doesn't like sugar in his coffee. And I know, that whoever this Sherlock Holmes is, John was in love with him. Correction: John is in love with him.
Annnnd I've managed to write another chapter
thank you."
"What? The brochure? You were telling me about Harry, so I thought I'd save you all the trouble and find you one. They gave a massive discount too when they found out it was Mycroft who'd wanted it, a nice little touch don't you think?"
I glad I did that. You loved being clever and being praised, and you loved me too, I think. And you used to tell me all about the crime that you solved, and I would just laugh and kiss you on your forehead. They were fun times.  And loved every day of it. And I think you know it too.
John inhaled the pleasing scent of paper and books one last time as he exited the book store, a bag with a book in it in one hand and his cane in the other.
"Or perhaps," Mycroft said, surprised that his brother was so oblivious, "He heard you. It was just too late."
The waking up from a night on the couch together was...well, anticlimatic. John had woken up to discover Sherlock was already awake and bustling about the flat.
it was like.
Sherlock didn't look thoroughly convinced, but didn't probe further. “Well, then.” He released John, who quickly turned around and continued making tea in jarring, jerky movements.
It was a perfect metaphor. A man on trial, waiting for death or life. Death, it seemed, was the final verdict, beyond negotiation.
"Fine. I'll take Rosie-- and leave." It was hard to even talk, his voice trembling dangerously.
"Yes, that is indeed Sherlock's back." Mycroft said, accurately sensing John's terror. "Do you know under which circumstances did he sustain these injuries?"
"Who are you?" Sherlock asked, an eyebrow arched in disdain, as if John had made a mistake by breathing the same air as him.
"List them out? All the usual things that you do, haven't you ever been in a relationship?" Mary meant it as a harmless query perhaps, but Sherlock looked distinctly uneasy, and an embarrassed blush spread over his cheeks as he looked down, avoiding John's gaze.
"Everyday? Isn't- isn't that a bit much?" John said, hoping to God his voice wasn't as high pitched as it sounded to his own ears.
The Sherlock who'd turned up at the therapists doorstep, saying to him, ' and I'm never climbing out.' He didn't want to think it could become reality again.
John's shoulders sagged under the weight of his current circumstance, and he wanted to stop all of it by the sheer intensity of his desire to do so.
Still, it doesn't stop the hurt from flowing in. It comes like a huge wave, hitting the edges of my heart harshly. Causing endless destruction. Look Sherlock, I have turned a poet for you.
But it really does pain Sherlock. It pains that you keep humiliating me, it pains that I still love you.
The trio go from Baker Street to the scene of John's crime, with the John Watson of the other dimension as their tour guide
"I wish I could. But I know I cannot."
They would strike him before too, in the time before their current 'practicing', as he and Sherlock would be doing a household chore, or researching together.
John had half a mind to rouse him from his sleep and demand answers, but realised that Sherlock was in deep sleep and the bastard never got much rest anyway.
"There are a few guidelines however" Mycroft had begun to say, when John interrupted him,
It had a visible effect on Sherlock. For a second he stood with his lips slightly parted, and then stood up straighter, clearing his throat, his voice constrained when he spoke, "Fine then. We will follow the new sleeping arrangements."
"Very well, thank you for your cooperation. When all of this is over, we could offer you some," Mycroft made what John supposed was called a 'delicate pause', "monetary compensation."
Instead, he found himself in awe of the scene below him. Sherlock looked other-worldly like this, up close-- his curls fanning around his face, the light from above them falling on his features to make them glow. Dark lashes decorated closed eyes, and his hands were joined in a contemplative, prayer like pose.
It was also a time that put John to the test.
He had lain contemplating nothing concrete, dancing around the fringe of what exactly was this phenomenon named Sherlock, and John's feelings for him.
And then you do something unexpected.
He slept continuously if not very soundly for the rest of the night.
However, as time passed, and Sherlock got used to the sensation of it, he relaxed onto John's lap, eyes languidly gazing at the doctor.
John was surprised they hadn't asked each other what side of the bed they preferred.
"Umm, okay. But what should I even write?" John wasn't sure if he could effortlessly make up a smooth tale of his and Sherlock's romance, when there was none.
"Not at all, Dr Watson," Mycroft said evenly, "That is what
Timely, as ever, on the fifth day of their 'one week lock-in', John and Sherlock received a call from Mycroft's office about the second blog post John had to make. This time however, it was not Mycroft, but one of his "minions", as Sherlock liked to say, who had called them.
"No, no Sherlock. Please don't apologise. You don't ever have to apologise for loving me. Okay? What we have- what we have now-- it's amazing. But it's just that we took so long," John's voice broke, as he said the last few words. He looked at Sherlock, and suddenly the feeling- the want, filled him again.
No, he decided, this was one thing that would remain. He didn't know why. But it was imperative to some part of his consciousness.
Sherlock still refused to meet John's eyes. "Sherlock, look at me." At this, Sherlock slowly looked at John, and John could see the fear in his eyes. "Sherlock, it's okay," his voice was soothing. "You can be Rosie's dad. I don't mind. The only thing that matters is, do you want it? Do you want to be Rosie's dad?"
Though John had come with the intention of having a meaningful conversation, now that the opportunity presented itself, he wasn't quite sure what his actual words should be. He decided to begin with the core issue, the thing that had started the disagreement in the first place.
"I see," there was only a hint of disappointment in his voice, before he continued, "You're being sent far away? Far away from him too, seeing as you're so distressed about it."
"Thank you." And then, in a way of a courtesy, since he could think of nothing else, "How are you?"
And then,
Both of them looked anywhere but at each other, feeling a warm feeling like a gentle flame bloom in their chests.
"Oh," he smiled at John, "Right. Yes, I do remember who she is. My cousin twice removed on my father's side, Mrs Norton."
A few moments later, perhaps as an encouraging statement.
Their eyes were open as they closed the distance between them, and with a final encouragement of "Fuck it" from his brain, John closed his eyes and journeyed the last centimetre.
I know I've come outta hiding after a long time. But recently I had a lot of projects piling up and I now that I had time, well, I wrote up two chapters and intend to write it all the way to the end, YAY
He was right, the crime scene was gory, with an overturned table, blood splatters on the walls, and an absolute miracle that more DNA evidence hadn’t been left behind by the murderer.
"You should take her aside and talk to her, John." Sherlock's voice was soft, and understanding. At times like these, John wanted to kiss him full on the lips, and tell him how much he loved him. And since it was his wedding day, he was entitled to it. And so he pecked Sherlock on the lips, Whispered a 'thank you' in his ear, and turned.
Less than a minute later, came the reply.
"Yes?"
"Sherlock, y'know, I understand that there are er, certain
I recognize the voices, They're muffled because of the door, but they're clear enough for me to make our what you're saying. Two of them are mom and dad's voices. The other is yours, John.
And if you like the story, please leave kudos or comments...
And he couldn’t stop watching.
"Sherlock."
"So is he, John, so is he. I hope he knows that." She looked at him wistfully, and suddenly John felt a stab of affection for her.
There was complete silence in the room, for no one had suspected that Mycroft Holmes would have any interest in sentiments, especially where marriage was concerned.
Your voice is low, and unclear, and you are on the verge of sleeping.
They've finally had the real conversation, and Mrs Hudson is no longer with Mr Chatterjee.
What could he tell her anyway? That Sherlock was upset over a kiss that had never happened, that he himself felt guilty about it, that neither of them had the slightest right to have either of these feelings?
Sighing, he stepped out of his car. Anthea asked him a question, to which he replied with a murmur, not sure what the question was.
"Er, no. Just bring us back here mate, thanks." John said, settling into his seat.
Sherlock said something grudgingly, but lowering his voice to a whisper.
So he stepped into the car, finding Anthea next to him, once again on her phone. She didn't pay attention to him as continued texting. John remembered briefly his first meeting with Anthea, and almost smiled at his foolish flirting. She was far from the man he had fallen for that night.
Was it all that bad? Perhaps he could let himself have this, just this once. After all, when it would end, they would go their own separate ways, and he would never have the opportunity, so it would be safe.
, John supposed.
John, Sherlock, and Moustached John go to Baker Street give the Sherlock still there the ultimate choice.
Shaking his head to himself with a small smile, John went back to their room to fetch a blanket and drape it over the sleeping detective, tucking him in, and suddenly thought of all the romcoms he'd seen, with the lead doing
Before he could even finish saying it completely, however, the darkness groped at him and sent him into oblivion.
, a voice hissed in his head.
John, who was still thinking about this reality's John--how he didn't hesitate to shoot a man to save someone he'd just met-- was lost.
Still no reply from Harry.
After apologising to Harry and hastily departing, John hailed a cab and went back to Baker Street.
John's shocked face and watering eyes were answer enough.
The harsh illumination of the tube light flooded the small room, and in it, stood John-- frozen, with his hair not a warm golden under the light, but a sickly bright white.
"You cannot walk away from me like this, Sherlock, you cannot walk away from
Sherlock meets the Doctor and Detective from the other universe, as does Rosie, and finally, the decision is taken.
"Excellent. Yes. He is keeping a watch on us." Sherlock turned to face John with a serious expression, stepping closer to the army doctor. "Tell me, who would need to keep a lookout on us, and observe our actions? Who would stand to gain from this?"
looking Sherlock reading the newspaper on the same chair he'd slept in last night, the blanket folded neatly on the arm.
"What will I not comprehend, Sherlock?"
And like all the other times John had been indulging in his little impulses, he let it happen this time too.
And about the main storyline, I think we'll be coming down to the action soon. Stay tuned!!!
"What?-- Why?" The pause was enough to tell John the truth.
"What is the matter, John? Does this," his hands gestured to them both, "bother you? I'm so sorry, John. I have offended you by this, haven't I? I shouldn't have tried to-do forgive me, John."
"John, " Sherlock nudged his husband, "Who left the rose on the table?"
And with that she walked away, behind the nearest pillar. John knew that if he checked there would be no one behind it.
"Harry you promised." You are hurt. Don't be. Here, have some. It helps for the pain to go away.

The woman with jet black hair picked up the phone, answering, "Hello Jim."
That's what I would still have been like, John. If it weren't for you. Or for Sherlock. He helped me quietly you know. Sometimes, during the process, when I felt like giving up, somehow he would always know. I would find him at whichever bar I chose, even if I did it randomly. He didn't say much, just took me to some cafe. He talked about normal things you know. Sometimes about your relationship, sometimes about Rosie, or some crime that he was solving. He said it mechanically, most of the times, except when he was saying something cute Rosie did, or a funny thing that you did. But it helped, weirdly enough. I could tell sometimes it made him uncomfortable, especially the first few times.But he had this fierce determination in his eyes. He loved you enough to go through all that. He's a good man, John, and he's made you an even better one.
And this shouldn't be enough for anyone to forgive the other, it shouldn't be an adequate apology. But it's you Sherlock. With you everything is different. And so I do, Sherlock. I forgive you. Just like that.

Below them on the pavement, and nearly on the road, hoards of people were standing, crowded all chatting with each other. Most of them were reporters, in the middle and the front of the crowd, with their cameras at ready. Then there was another group of mostly women- supporters, John guessed. And finally, to the extreme right, was a group of people with boards that looked like--
Both of them were surprised to hear the tinge of sincerity in it. He then looked around a flat, and inhaled, as if taking in the smell of it and preserving it on his mind. Then, with a lingering pat on Sherlock's shoulder he left.
As the last lines of the song resounded the room, they echoed their thoughts.
"No dear. She's someone else." Mrs Hudson replied and, turning to the staircase, called the said Agent upstairs.
John had messed up the last bit, and stepped onto Sherlock’s foot. After many apologies and sheepish laughter, they tried the step again. this time John did it better, and only stumbled a little towards the ending. After a few more mess-ups, some stumbling, laughter, and teasing, they had reached a point where Sherlock thought it appropriate to advance to the next point in this waltz.
"Yes, away from him."
I knoooooow it's been long I'm so sorry, but here are two chapters to compensate, and stuff will be moving a lot quicker now,, I solemnly promise! So they kissed, it was nice. Anyways the Woman is here, is that not nice?
"It should have been sooner. We deserve so much. So much. Christ, Sherlock, why did we wait for so long?" He burried his face in Sherlock's chest, sobbing, "So much time lost. Can't we turn back time?"
Utterly devoid of energy, determination, or any form of willpower, he lay there a few more minutes before it occurred to him that his phone should carry no mark of his having used it.
They came with all their usual might, overwhelming and fast and dark and all consuming, and he woke up panting, hand already searching for a gun, then took a few deep breaths, and sobbed for all it was worth. He was glad Sherlock wasn't around to witness the spectacle. He couldn't sleep properly that night afterwards.
There was a fear in his eyes that made John want to take his face in his hands, and rub the lines of worry away.
Also, yes, I imagined that Sherlock would think about John later also, the speech that John made would make him pause in hesitation every time before he used.
you two have already become."
He could never leave Sherlock. It repulsed him, this need, he was sure it was wrong. And yet, it never seemed so with Sherlock. It could seem nothing but irrevocably right to John when it came to Sherlock.
And then, like shy teenagers, they twittered around the thought of kissing, until John mustered up the courage, and asked, "Can I- I mean, can I kiss you?"
Sherlock did not respond at all, except for hitting a high note on the violin, which was almost a screech.
So he quickly sat up and deleted all his contacts, emails, messages, songs and photos, pausing only at his two recordings, his thumb hovering over the screen, lit up a pale blue in its light.
John imagined pale white hands with long elegant fingers holding the syringe, shaky with anticipation. If thoughts could physically injure, this had come close enough for John. But he did nothing as the man disappeared behind the door.

John was a bit frustrated with the long line at the bookshop, but he supposed that he should be happy knowing that more people were visiting the bookstore. It was surely welcome break from their screens.
And this is me returning it to you.
He didn't stop to wait for Sherlock to reply and left the lab, only hearing an echo of the farewell Sherlock spoke.
Anyways, two more chances to go. Maybe he won't need all of them, but the fic name IS "third times a charm" so...
And then, things changed little by little. Perhaps It was the presence of a child, that the domesticity that they had always shared, escalated to new heights.
Mycroft paused for a moment, then with his face contorted as if there was a lemon was in his mouth, said something. He had lowered his voice, to make his words inaudible to John.
In a very low, gentle voice he read out, "'
Okay guys. Its going to be about their first kiss. This maybe a little long because I have no control when I  write fluff.
"Any specific destination, sir?" The driver suddenly spoke from the front.
And just like that, the spark returned to Sherlock's eyes, and John smiled, thinking to himself:
John stared deeply into her eyes, and then looked away, silent for a few seconds, as if thinking about something, and then replied, "I suppose, I did. Yes, I did, didn't I?" He said the last sentence with a shake of his head, and a chuckle, looking down at his feet.
The rescuing of Harry Watson, and the unveiling of her brother's. The past that they'd always kept in silence, finally catches up.
This time it was said in a flat, calm voice, and Mycroft went up to his brother, carefully taking the violin from his hand. Sherlock let him do it, and also let himself be guided to a chair.
He paused then, to look at Mary and her animated eyes and her teasing smirk. John suddenly remembered the attraction he'd felt for her that had begun this-- them. Did he still want that-- want her?
Yes. Nothing more. Just acting.
His focus shifted to Rosie, and he found her wide awake, staring at him with the beautiful blue eyes which often stared at him with immense love from her father's countenance. They were so much like John's, inquisitively peeking out, their colour the brightest ocean waves retreating lazily from the sand. She Was just so much like John.
“But there were signs of struggle on the victim. If he’d been drugged, the old man wouldn’t have put up much of a struggle. Besides,” John fiddled with a photo of the crime scene, “it wouldn’t have been so messy if he hadn’t put up a fight.”
The men were standing with guns and flashlights, all pointing towards John and Sherlock, throwing them into the spotlight, while Mycroft was only illuminated by the dim glow of the  street lights, bathing him in shadows and making him look just like the criminal mastermind John had first imagined him to be.
That was different, was the answer ready in John's mind.
John tries, a second time, the approach of distracting Sherlock, and learns more about the man he was before he met John.
Yes. Things may seem a little confusing, and the only reason you can make sense of the whole thing is because the Amazing Beta Vanshika, helped me a TON!!! So thank you so much!!!! :-)!
"Great. Now sort of mould into each other. Put your arm around him and John you make yourself a bit more comfortable-- yeah like that."
Shaking his head but giving in, John looked carefully at the group of reporters that were in the midst of the crowd. He soon found what Sherlock might have been pointing to. "there's--this man. He doesn't have a camera. It's actually a-- it's a pair of binoculars. That's weird."
Mycroft was never one to sugarcoat things, and this too he had said without mercy.
When Mycroft called again in the evening, John and Sherlock were at the window, keeping watch from behind the closed curtains. They took turns at the windowsill, observing the only man with the binoculars in all the crowd.
