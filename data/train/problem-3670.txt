me to.”
“I’m glad to remain useful.” Cas says, something distant to his voice, and Sam gets his pot started heating, before joining him.
“Really, Dean?”
“Tomorrow, we’ll, you know… we’ll figure this stuff out. Get you a little more settled.” He goes over to where Sam had dropped his bag, pulls out a plastic Wallgreens bag from the main pocket, and tosses it to Cas, before retrieving his toiletry kit. “Come on, if we’re gonna be living in close quarters and ordering extra onions, you’re gonna learn how to brusha brusha brusha.”
“I did.” Dean isn’t the one to say. “I also healed you, and brought us here. But Dean was involved also, in all of these things.”
Cas glares at him, depositing him in an armchair, and then holding up a hand like he’s telling a dog to stay.
you were--”
“You ungrateful bitch, in all the years I fed you, I never made you eat something this disgusting.”
“Aw, it’ll happen to you someday, too.”
“I know. Come on, let’s get you to bed, we’ll… we’ll regroup in the morning.”
“I know you don’t.”
back, and maybe that’s why he’d been so insistent… They hadn’t burned Dean. And maybe they should have, but it’s damn hard to look at it that way when the living, breathing article’s sitting next to him.
“I gave him a place, Sam! He walked out! That was his choice, I didn’t-- I didn’t abandon him in the street, he walked out!”
Dean, who got dragged to Hell just a few months back, and what they’d buried hadn’t been half as pretty as what crawled back out, which is the opposite of how things usually go.
After all, there’s nothing
“We’ve talked about this, man.” He says, halfhearted. “It’s not in your best interests to get me all backed up.”
“You think that’s the worst think he could have cursed you with?”
“I need my brother.”
“Yeah.” Dean yawns. “I’m just… just about ready to turn in, though. You have fun.”
“What do you-- Wait--
human.”
“It’s sure something, ain’t it?” Dean asks, turning to take in Cas’ profile just a moment. “Being out here where you can see all those stars.”
you know something I don’t about dragging lakes?”
-- really, the more he thinks about it, the more he wonders why he didn’t see it earlier.
Okay. Okay. Sam can do this. He’s got to.
, and he’s learning.  He’s learning so much about what it means to feel things, and how to communicate, and Dean knows that’s not because he taught him how. It’s just because he’s gotten good at it.
Well shit, so now he’s got to deal with Dean actively pushing Cas away for his own good, because he never quite gets that other people should get to make choices, even if the choice is thinking Dean Winchester deserves to be taken care of once in a while… Because he never quite gets that yeah, maybe if you stand there shouting ‘go on, can’t you see I don’t want you anymore’, someone might actually believe that, and have feelings about it-- because he absolutely doesn’t get that someone could have actual positive feelings towards him. Because he’s an
Dean’s brow furrows, and it’s not Dean’s expression, but Sam
“For you?” He looks up, exhaustion visible. He shrugs like he’s feeling the weight of that world pressing him down. “Yeah. Sure. You wanna save the world, let’s save the world.”
“Every part of that is so wrong.” He shudders.
The look Dean gives him is priceless, the impotent fury of an older brother being told if he doesn’t eat his vegetables, he’s not getting dessert, and even if he could get out of bed and to the kitchen, Sam put them up on the top shelf, and he doesn’t actually think Dean can get them if he nudges them back.
“Well, he’s an unreasonable dumbass sometimes. But like I was saying, we could use your help. I think the remains we need to burn are at the bottom of a lake, and as you can imagine, it’s pretty hard to burn something that’s… at the bottom of a lake.”
“He’s gone. What else matters?”
When he opens the door, Cas is still on the phone, smiling faintly, and he holds up a hand. “Dean? Sam has just opened the door, I’m going to hang the phone up. Please elaborate once I join you… No, about the curse-- Yes, of course… Yes, I’ll be there directly. Hello, Sam. Dean’s suffered no ill effects yet, I take it?”
“Gross.”
“Dean, no--” He finally manages, though it’s a rough croak, no power behind it.
, I don’t think Dean… Even with the old man gone, you know, he… Right now, he’s still tangled up in what everyone else thinks he should be. And he’s not ready to think about who he is, or who he wants to be.”
.” He argues, getting Dean wrestled out of his jacket and tucked into bed.
.” He huffs, pacing around in a circle. “Mysterious graffiti does not interest me!”
Cas appears, bearing an armload of counterspell ingredients, which he dumps unceremoniously on the table near Sam before sweeping across to Dean, checking him over, and Dean just looks…
Sam lets Cas in, staring at the baby strapped to his chest.
“Yeah, and what do you want if you win? You really think I’m gonna… what, let you hustle your free will in a game of pool?” He laughs.
“If it takes him a long time to open up and get his shit together, like… if it takes him ten years to work some things out? You’ll hang on the line for him, right?”
“I mean if he feels so strongly about it, what am I supposed to do? What do you want me to say, huh? Am I supposed to cry about it?”
stares her way, but then, Sam doesn’t
“Maybe I should drive. In case you go blind or keel over.”
“Describe my mystery date.” Dean says-- Deanna, should get used to calling her Deanna because he probably doesn’t call his sister ‘Dean’.
Dean shrugs, something he manages to do with his whole face as well as his shoulders, and he returns his full attention to his food.
“No, I know, just-- In the morning, huh?”
“What do you normally do? When I’m out, when you-- when you’re hiding this? How do you keep him… okay?”
“I understand Dean may--”
either, using the baby talk lilt as he reads about trolls while Cas bathes Jack.
“Well, I mean-- Shit.” Dean paces around in a brisk circle before he drops back into the armchair where Cas had placed him. “It’s not like I haven’t hinted around. I figure if he doesn’t want to, if it feels like it’s not the right time or he doesn’t want to, uh, I dunno, if that’s too much of us…”
Of course, every time he does
Sam spreads his arms, giving Dean a look he knows his brother would categorize as some variety of bitchface.
“Yeah. Plus I gave him the same deodorant talk I gave you when you were twelve. Explained that soap was not optional when you’re living out of a car with a couple of other dudes, whether or not you get gungy on a hunt, basics… Basics.” He shrugs. “Anything I didn’t cover… we’ll figure it out when it comes up.”
And so he starts feeling out for other scars he should have, and those are gone, too, and it’s when, in a moment of panic, he checks to make sure his tattoo is still in place, that he notices what else is gone.
“Like who?” Dean snorts, and it’s a good point, but still…
“Or ‘hey, Cas, since you’re stuck on Earth because you sided with us, you should stay here, you could have a room of your own and keep things in it’. Seriously, why not ask him?”
“Apparently not.” Cas straightens up and backs away from Dean.
. It is a job not so easily done. When I wove your brother back together, it was my grace which bound him back into himself, but he is not yet ready… he cannot yet be without me.”
Cas’ hand wraps around his, bringing it down from his mouth, though for another moment, he doesn’t say anything. Just looks deep into Dean’s eyes like he’s looking through him and every single desire Dean’s ever had is laid out before him. Does he know how close he’s come before, to starting something? Has he scared off from it too easy, made Cas think he wasn’t ready, wasn’t serious? Does he know how bad he
It’s the wrong argument, he gets that immediately, once the words are out. Hadn’t his own Dean told him, what feels like a solid week ago now? And he still hadn’t realized the kind of love he felt, not even knowing he felt like there was nothing for him in a world without Cas, no point to living. He doesn’t want Cas stretching himself on his account, not even if it works out. Not if it means any kind of risk to him.
“Hey, Sammy.” Dean chuckles softly, head lolling. Cas shushes him, a moment of gentleness that almost reminds Sam of their own Cas, except for how quickly it vanishes, leaving him cold and hard and angelically imposing even as he heals over the nick on his own throat and tucks Dean into bed.
“When we met, when I blasted you a bunch of times.”
“That’s… good.” He gulps.
“Dean, how am I supposed to analyze this cursed ‘slime’ if you haven’t preserved the evidence?”
“We only had one cassette tape, in the car.” Cas shrugs. “So he has heard it a lot. And he often falls asleep, when we drive.”
Except Dean doesn’t say what he said before, about killing Zachariah in order to become Michael’s vessel.
“Accidentally. It was very embarrassing.” Cas chuckles, like this isn’t turning Dean’s world on its head. He sets the .45 down.
“My grace sustains him.” Cas looks down at Dean, hand going to his brow. “Pulling a soul from the pit, restoring every part of him… it takes
Sam falls into something unexpected, with a colder and more foreboding version of Cas than the one he's grown close to and a Dean that he's not sure what he can do with-- but who he might have one very unexpected thing in common with...
“Uhhh… yeah.”
When?
Well… that’s about as ASAP as it gets.
“Is it? This is good to know.” He licks salt and ketchup from his fingers, momentarily devoted to the task.
“I mean it, you don’t need to do this, just… get back in the car, do your research thing.”
“Well.” He shrugs. “You know. It’s… Having Cas around is pretty good for us, and it’s not like he actually lives anywhere else. I’ve kind of been wondering when he was gonna move in.”
“What?” Chuck interrupts, before he can finish outlining the thing.
Cas doesn’t answer. He makes his own circuit around the place, such as it is, does his own work warding it against everything he’s got a ward for. Sigils Sam recognizes and a couple he doesn’t. Sam works on the soup, and things are quiet for a while. Cas’ guilt follows him around like a dark cloud, but there’s nowhere he can go, and Sam knows Chuck must have been edging them towards a breaking point, must have wanted one of those big break-up fights to go down while the three of them are stuck together getting cabin fever-- according to his phone, they’re going nowhere soon, so the other Sam is just going to have to deal with that-- but if he can redirect things now… Maybe they were careening towards a big argument over who’s the horrible burden on whom and who’s the worst and who would be better off without the other, but they don’t need to be.
“I really hope you mean a play pen and not like a dog crate.” Sam shoots him a look, but then he catches sight of Cas’ face.
“That’s cheating, that’s
“Maybe you should come take a walk with me.”
Well… Sam can’t call that surprising.
“Oh.” Cas looks down.
“I mean hypothetically. So you just think about what you want.” Dean scowls at him, but there’s no real upset in it. He remains in Cas’ personal space even as Cas retakes his chair, bends over the table and pauses to stretch, arching his back between moves. “Thinking about it?”
, Dean thinks,
me, it’s because he’s not an important part of the story I want to tell. So even if I didn’t think bringing him back would screw everything up for me even more than it already is, why would I want to, when he’s the fucking fly in my ointment? When someone else took him out for me?”
“What is it, sweetheart? What do you need?”
“This one’s a little different…” Chuck looks at him like he’s holding back a laugh. “You know what? No highlights.”
“The Empt--”
But maybe that’s about what Dean really needs, anyway-- someone who’s not any more comfortable with things than he is, who doesn’t want to have deep conversations, or at least doesn’t want to have them sober, but… who
“Couldn’t sleep, decided to get in some target practice?”
“I hope you think this is funny.” Sam buries his head in his hands, can just feel Chuck laughing at him, no wonder he hadn’t gotten a highlight reel.
“Could you give him a chance to come around?”
“Mushrooms. Nice.” He says, and forces himself to swallow another bite.
. You just
to call Cas.”
“I don’t know, nothing. Nothing I can talk about.” He snorts.
Things are subdued, to say the least. For all that Dean had put on a brave face in front of the kid, he’s
“Oh.” He only looks at Sam briefly, before his attention turns back to the wall. “He considers us friends?”
“Yeah. Hey--”
And there’s one more thing Sam knows, whether or not Chuck has grokked onto it yet-- if they don’t get Cas back one way or another, he’s going to lose Dean, too. He can lose him slow and ugly, or he can play out Chuck’s game and try and make things painless, but this is not his first rodeo with Dean grieving Cas so hard he loses himself, and he knows where it’s going. He knows either Team Free Will crosses the finish line together, or they don’t cross it at all, because every time they’ve ever tried to make it with someone missing, it all just takes a nosedive.
. One hand drifts up to his shoulder, slides halfway in across his chest before his arm drops back to his side and he…
about Hell. Dean needs to get used to being alive again, maybe. Dean needs the familiarity of the road rolling under him, and some peace and quiet so he can get himself in order, and then he needs to talk to Sam, and Bobby just hopes whatever Sam did, it’s…
They meet Cas out by the lake, after breakfast, where he’s got their skeleton dried out and waiting. Aside from the lake aspect, it’s an easy salt and burn. Cas spends the whole time standing too close, staring too much, the way he used to, but there’s a tension around it in this universe that Sam doesn’t recall from their own. A low conversation that they have, outside of Sam’s hearing, that ends with Dean getting angry, and Cas looking after him like a kicked puppy.
“Just go. Just go… do whatever you did come here for, we’ve got nothing we need to say to each other right now.”
“Is that so?”
“Thanks.” Dean says, his voice catching just a little.
“You look kind of ready to fall over, maybe you should just… sit for a minute.”
“It’s not just me.”
“Okay.”
“Uhh… yeah.” He jumps off of the bed and goes to where his supposed research is spread. The map on Chuck’s screen had been written on, and so is this one, the other Sam must have gotten the info before going to dinner last night. “Think we’re heading here. You get anything different?”
Dean looks at Sam, then over at Adam, looks agonized for a moment. Sam’s vision is swimming, and he can barely hear him over… well, over what’s either an angelic presence or impending death, buzzing low in the back of his skull, he’s not sure which. Bad as it is, he’s still way too aware of Dean, looking at him like it might be the last time.
Only something he seems reluctant to address.
“I’m gonna hit the hay early.” Sam announces. “In case you guys need to…”
“You know what, fuck you very much, don’t give me that-- don’t-- Can you just for once accept that you don’t know, and you’re not gonna know, and you can’t understand this? And there’s no chick flick moment on the face of this
Great.
“What kind of maniac sleeps in a bed that’s not even against a single wall?” Dean grumbles, as Cas deposits him on said bed.
“No, I’m really not. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, if Lucifer, you know, ganked you--”
“He’s with us, Sam. There isn’t anyone you take an ex-angel to, he-- He’s with us.” Dean shakes his head. “It’s not much, but it’s the best I got. We’re not turning him loose, look at him.”
Sam would love to ask, but there’s no way this version of him needs any clarification on what delivery day is, or anything else. He picks up a book, starts reading, and hopes that if he just waits around long enough, something will give him the clue he needs. Or Cas will show up. Is Cas ‘delivery day’? If he and Dean are stuck in the bunker full-time, maybe he is. Someone would have to make supply runs, after all, and if Dean isn’t any freer than Sam is...
“Well I’m not gonna repeat anything else we said in front of the kiddo. I don’t know when kids start picking up swears, but the first full sentence Sammy ever said was ‘oh shit, my shoes’.”
“Are you omnipotent or impotent, man? I thought you were god, I thought you were
“That’s all? Oh?”
Maybe it’s unfair to Cas, that he didn’t get this in the real world, when he seems to enjoy fatherhood so much, seems to take genuine joy in the mundane feeding of an infant in his care.
“I-- I don’t know. Sometimes.” He shrugs, uncomfortable with the accusation lurking in those words. Maybe in this universe he doesn’t. Maybe he doesn’t want to.
“You’d be dead right now if we hadn’t.”
about?” Sam asks, turning to give Dean some privacy to dress in. He can hear him moving around the room, grabbing clothes. Pointedly not answering. “Well?”
Dean shoots him an exasperated look that isn’t Dean’s, once he’s hauled Adam up, grabs Sam by the arm, and suddenly…
“I shouldn’t tell
“Is that good?”
“You took a pretty rough hit, just sleep it off for now.” He gets to his feet, dusting his hands off. “Gonna go run the taps a little, flush the toilet a couple times, make sure the pipes don’t freeze up on us, and then… shit, I don’t know. Start taking inventory? We can move on once the road’s safe enough. I’ll pull up the weather forecast in a minute.”
“You don’t want a good old-fashioned family Christmas?”
“... Did you plan on sneaking out while Dean wasn’t here?”
Breaking the curse is the easy part. Processing the notion that Dean pretended to have his legs go out from under him so that Cas would catch him is… weird.
Thinking about that other thing, he’s not quite there with. It feels selfish and kind of filthy and he can never decide if it’s the good kind of filthy or not, but he has to admit to himself, if not to anyone else, that it’s a fantasy that’s
“What? Uh… thirty thousand.”
“I can walk!”
“Of course. While I was occupying her, she was safe. It was… still dangerous, potentially, but… no, she was unharmed.”
He had thought they would be able to speak, of course. After all… Dean was meant to be an Archangel’s potential vessel, so shouldn’t that mean he would be capable of hearing an angel’s true voice? And…
“Just now. I was only gone for three hundred and thirty hours, ten minutes--”
Even if Chuck’s plan for this world is to strip Cas of his powers and leave him that way, it’s not a guaranteed win for him, but Sam’s a little worried. This could take the choice out of his hands.
“Yes. It is. It’s what he always does, it doesn’t matter if we need him, it doesn’t matter if we even-- if there’s no one else who could-- You know, he… he’s a rolling stone, and-- So why should this time be different?”
Finally, Dean nods, and Cas looks like something just cut his strings, all the tension leaves him and he sags, head bowed. By the team Sam reaches them, he’s ready for a fight, tensed again, but it’s a better kind of tense.
“I love you.” He nods. “Sap.”
“We could be down here a very long time.”
Cas sits on the edge of the bed, his hand rests over Dean’s midsection, rising and falling with his breaths. “I could have done more. I could have done a little more. I was afraid… I was afraid that if it was too much at once, he might still need me, and I would be too weak to do more. That we could both be entirely reliant on you. As it is…”
When Cas lays Jack back down, this time he doesn’t stir. Sam joins them in looking down into the play pen at him, little sleeping face with round, rosy cheeks, little fists balled up.
Dean’s hand is healed, but Cas doesn’t let go right away this time, just turns it over between his own--
When whatever else happened, happened. When he got dragged up out of Hell.
“Well, I don’t know anyone else who’s been outside Earth’s atmosphere, so… who can say? They still pretty nice, though? From here?”
“Yes, of course.”
, it’s only Cas.
And so Sam gets the tree put in place while Dean starts something in the kitchen, and the two of them are stringing popcorn so that the tree is decorated with something other than a couple of protective amulets dug up from around the bunker and a couple of badly-made paper snowflakes. They’re still stringing popcorn-- and bickering aimlessly-- when Sam’s phone rings.
“You’re all right… you’re all right.” Dean’s hands are on his face, and the world is still fuzzy beyond him. He’d expended a lot of energy to get them to safety this time, but… well, Cas can hardly find it in himself to complain now.
They talk about nothing in particular as they make a circuit around the restaurant and lounge. It’s easier to adjust to soccer mom Cas than it is to adjust to Deanna, and he can only assume it’s because Cas isn’t really a man or a woman in the same way a human is. Nothing about Cas is really different-- even the knot in the big silk square around her neck is a little bit off, like one day it was done by a being who knew vaguely that this was a part of its host body’s everyday look, but not how to make it look nice, and it’s never been fixed. Or, if it’s been fixed, it’s been fixed by either Deanna or this Sam, who might have experience with a bandanna or a handkerchief, but not with a silk scarf.
“No. I really don’t. Jerk.” He rolls his eyes. “Guy brings you back to life with brand new arteries and you immediately wanna put a lifetime of cholesterol back in your body…”
“I’ll be fine, I’ll be-- I’m good.” Sam promises, though he glares at a billboard with GOD SAVES spraypainted across its faded and peeling facade. He picks up a rock and chucks it, though he misses the billboard.
And then Sam’s there, in a motel room like a million others, meeting Cas for the very first time. Not the way he first met him, in the real world, his world. He wakes up and Cas is just
“You guys still haven’t finished that game?” Sam asks, loping into the room with his open laptop balanced carefully across his forearm.
“What?”
at Dean than he already was, his expression unreadable-- enough so that Sam realizes how much of how well he can ever read their own Cas is through Cas’ changing, and not how well he’s figured out his weirdly deep, weirdly blank looks.
.” Sam glares at his brother as hard as he possibly can. Having Dean back has been a
“I don’t know. Maybe.” Sam shrugs. “If it happens it happens.”
After what he’d seen on Chuck’s highlight reel, the second Sam is slammed into his body to start his twenty-four hours, he heads back to the motel room.
“Okay, I’m hanging up, um-- I’ll see you.” Sam heads for the door, ignoring the questioning look from Dean-- and ignoring the theft of another handful of popcorn. Dean’s the one who wanted Christmas, if the popcorn chains aren’t super popcorn-y, it’s his own damn fault.
“Obviously, when I required a vessel to speak to Dean after his resurrection, I wanted to find one closer to him. And… well, I wore out my welcome with my previous emergency host, when I failed to protect her friend, as I had promised.”
“Cas has feelings. Right now, he’s kicking himself because he couldn’t just fix you up like nothing happened.”
He’s thirsty as-- well, he’s thirsty as a guy who just crawled out of Hell, apparently, so there’s that, too, and every part of him is aching, but it’s an ache that’s got nothing on even his best days down there, so…
Dean stirs, and Cas places a hand to his forehead-- doesn’t seem to do anything to make him sleep, as far as Sam can tell, it’s his palm against Dean’s forehead and he simply holds it there as Dean re-settles. It takes too long for it to be a thing Cas
It’s one thing to fantasize about getting fucked-- sure, he used to be ashamed of it whenever the thought crossed his mind, but that was… That was then, this is now. He’s come to grips with himself a little more. And it’s
And it was Castiel’s grace that still lingered in the sinews of him. It was Castiel who rebuilt his body, who carefully poured him back into it once it was whole.
“Oh? You don’t want to lecture me? Not gonna give me those sad eyes and tell me I’m better than I think?”
“Oh, hey, you guys are back.” Sam’s voice is so
“Peachy.” Dean snaps. “She’s gonna be back. You know… she needed some time but she’s gonna be back, so… I thought maybe we should try and…”
“... Yeah, good point. Eh, it’s nice having him around, I mean, if you think we really need someone else on this.” Dean shrugs. “Don’t make a big deal out of the whole… me getting cursed thing. I’m not feeling anything weird, just… you know, tell him if he wants to help us hit the books, there’s a beer and a burger in it for him. He’s gonna try and say he doesn’t eat, but then he’s gonna want one once he smells ‘em.”
the witch they’d been hunting before she can stab Dean. It’s
“What?” Dean gives him a look, but he’s not really talking to Dean.
Life goes on, mostly in a familiar way, Chuck fast-forwards through a lot that looks familiar. Dean makes a deal, Dean goes to Hell, Dean finds Sam and things go back to normal, except Dean is cagey and upset in a whole new way.
“What do you want me to write? He pulled me out of Hell, he possessed some holy roller from Illinois for like, two days, and we haven’t exactly kept up a correspondence since I moved into an angel-proof underground bunker.”
“It makes for an easier eating experience and a more pleasant mouthfeel when this process occurs.”
“You know. Mentioned there was a lot of space, he agreed. Said there would always be a bed if he wanted one, he reminded me he doesn’t sleep, we kind of went around in circles a little. Bottom line, he’s an angel, so like… the concept of needing a ‘home’ is, you know, giving a fish a bicycle, or something.”
Dean is a better tactician than that.
“I’d be fine if he was human, you know.” He says, after a few more minutes of the two of them steadily eating the worst thing Sam’s ever made.
was a fucking mistake. He’d tried duct tape over an old undershirt, and that hadn’t tried to strangle him but it hadn’t been great, either. He’d tried a sports bra that said ‘compression’ on the tag but it was uncomfortable in more ways than just the physical.
Cas doesn’t respond. Cas is unnaturally still-- even for Cas-- save the rapid, shallow rise and fall of his chest.
“Cas?” Dean frowns.
“What the hell?” Dean scowls-- not at Cas, who’s staring the way he used to before a solid decade of gentle reminders about personal space and what humans consider polite versus what humans consider creepy, but at Sam. “I said this was a bad time.”
cold?”
“Okay.” He sighs. “Okay. One last ride. I’m just… I’m tired. That’s all.”
He can’t really figure out what he’s supposed to do here, things seem good. Then again, things seemed fine when Cas was human and then he up and ran out on them, so it’s not like he can just check out.
.” Cas re-angles his head properly, and kisses back, one hand sliding up to the back of Dean’s head, the other hanging onto a fistful of his shirt a moment before spreading wide across his lower back, keeping his body pressed close-- not that it seems in any danger of un-pressing itself from him.
-- and trails his fingertips over the places where he’d knit bone back together, repaired tears to skin and muscle. As if he can still see how mangled it used to be.
“That was at the State Fair! We got to pet bunnies, Sam, I took you on the Scrambler! And you want to compare the culinary delights to be found in that veritable paradise to your cream-less mushroom soup? Mushrooms anywhere but a pizza are just--”
“What, you’re too good to give your brother the talk? I gave you the talk.” Dean says, as if that hadn’t been a mortifying experience for both of them.
The way Cas touches him doesn’t exactly help with Dean’s inevitable ill-timed boner problem. It’s familiar, possessive… assured. Like he knows the littlest touch could make his claim on Dean a neon sign. PROPERTY OF CAS in a buzzing blue glow, blinking on and off to the tune of Dean’s heart.
is supposed to be like, for that matter. With the initial ‘gotcha’ having passed, he doesn’t mind that he’s spending a day as a woman, but he’d like to not fuck up this alternate Sam’s life and he doesn’t know what her deal is, whether either of them is supposed to be straight or if they still like girls or what…
Sam shrugs expansively as she heads off to the bar, stopping to talk to the brunette in the sweater set on the way. A brunette in a sweater set who immediately approaches Sam. Slides into the seat across from him, in fact, mindful of the jacket draped over the back.
Chuck, who’s wearing about the most punchable grin when he pulls Sam back out.
to you? What do you
Fuck it, what’s the worst that could happen?
“No, no, it’s fine. We should be keeping him close.” Dean shoulders past him, half-carrying Cas. “Get the luggage. We’ll get a rollaway cot sent over.”
Dean in this world, bi Dean, he’s in love with Cas.
“Yeah, I’m just… I’m doing nothing importan--
Deanna’s relaxed in a way Dean rarely is, the way he pretends to be sometimes. The way Sam used to believe was real, but this… this seems a little more genuine. If he’d realized it was Dean from the start, he’d have figured out she was doing that ‘believe I’m relaxed’ thing. Now, though… now she’s
“No, I fucked up.” He crosses to the table, he’s on his feet before Sam can tell him not to. He makes it without faltering, much less falling over. “Cas was telling me about the curse, he recognized the slime, and I… So he said ‘first, your legs will give out’, and I was-- Let’s say as a joke, I…”
was lost to
need that-- I do not need to think about… that!”
“Uh. Yeah. Yeah, it’s… I’m a little stir-crazy, I guess. Um… you?”
“Conditions? You mean you’re gonna help us?”
“What. The fuck?” Adam says at last.
He’s still laughing when he opens his eyes and finds himself face to face with Chuck instead of Dean and Cas.
Everything is disorienting for a long moment, and too bright, and then he’s…
“I’m not calling Cas over a weak-ass witch boy.” He rolls his eyes. “We go back to the bunker, we hit the books, we figure out what this is, and if ganking the witch didn’t break the curse, we find out what does and we do it, it’s not a big deal. I don’t even feel anything.”
He glances down at his cleavage again, and then back up to soccer mom Cas. “So… you don’t see what she sees, when you look at me, huh?”
He finds him kneeling in the snow, just a few yards out, barely holding himself up on shaking arms.
“Well, you can be more useful later if you sit for a minute now. Besides… nothing left to do.”
“Well… he would. Not a lot of people are
“How come you didn’t, then?”
“You kidding? So the biggest mistake of your life was trying to fill the shoes of an absentee father who, let’s face it, we’re better off having absent, so you’ve dragged people through the ringer with you, so there have been some mildly fratricidal moments. Do you know what we call that?” He waits for Cas to lift his eyes, though the hangdog expression doesn’t leave him. “An invitation to the Winchester family reunion. Signed, sealed, delivered.”
“Wait, who’s driving?”
“We were never in a bank robbery…” Cas narrows his eyes, confused.
Cas isn’t an angel, for one.
“No, I thought you were a stranger checking her out.”
Sam looks down at himself. He’s dressed like a normal person-- like the normal person he was going to be, not like a hunter. It’s just… stunningly
Cas just tilts his head to the side, squinting at Sam like he’s lost his mind, and it sets Dean off laughing in spite of himself, because
“I don’t need the seconds.” Dean steps forward, his hand covering Cas’ mouth, which he should lean away from or protest, but he doesn’t. His lips are soft against Dean’s palm. His breath is warm. “You were away long enough.”
, the fight had been rougher than Sam was going in expecting it to be, he can’t deny Cas was a big help, he just…
“Believe me, I know. You think I don’t cause my fair share of damage? You think I don’t make ugly mistakes sometimes? You think I fix everything I ever broke?”
“You don’t smell ‘rank’.” Cas frowns up at him. “You smell like vanilla. And sandalwood.”
“I’ll go talk to him.
“No, Dean, that’s--”
“Dental care’s handled?”
“No. I mean-- maybe some company? I was just gonna… hang out. Maybe get something done in the kitchen, or watch a movie, no real plans. But you’re welcome to stick around.”
“Bitch.” He pouts, but there’s not much feeling behind it.
“You’re just jealous that there are no good pun-based shirts for being straight.”
“Cas?” He pushes himself up on one elbow. “Stay?”
It makes him feel too much at once and even when it’s over he can feel the echo of it on him and whatever it is is too
proficient. So we’re gonna stay up, and go through as many different guns as you want, or as few, and we’re not leaving until you’re happy with you.”
to know that.”
“So what’s the game?” Chuck asks him. “What do you think you can do better than
“Great. We can get breakfast before we get a move on this haunting. Got a lead on those missing remains, but it’s gonna be a hell of a job.”
“So he-- So it’s a bad time.”
“I assure you, I remember every word we have ever exchanged, and I did not.”
“My apologies, beloved.” Cas noses at his cheek, hands dropping to his hips. “It wasn’t purposeful, at the time, but… even if I could take it back now, I wouldn’t. Is…?”
“And if you feel that you can’t go on, and your will’s sinking low…” Cas sings-- it sounds surprisingly nice for how gravelly his voice is, seems to settle Jack’s fussing further. “Just believe, and you can’t go wrong, in the light you will find the road. You will find the road… Oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you, standing out in the cold?”
“What?”
“That’s it? Wait, you just want to go?”
The tee shirt that says BEST BI in big block letters on a pink, blue, and purple tag shape? That is not something the Dean in his universe owns.
“I don’t know. Take him to Bobby, or… hell, who else do you take an ex-angel to? What do we even do for the guy?”
Okay, so… Cas definitely brought them to somebody’s house, like somebody’s actual empty vacation home, which is not ideal, but given how bad the roads were getting… Sam breaks in, Cas standing beside him on the little cabin’s porch, holding Dean in his arms.
Dean looks over his shoulder, highlighter hanging out of his mouth where he’d been chewing the cap, and after a moment of just staring at Cas like there’s no fucking rush, he finally stands up. Stretches lazily before he even takes the highlighter out of his mouth, let alone answers.
“Not the way humans do.” A soft frown creases her forehead, and she looks down at her shoes. They don’t match her outfit, which feels just about right somehow. Like she hadn’t quite understood coordination when she took them out of her vessel’s closet and hit the road. “But we can fall in love.”
“What do you mean?” Cas cocks his head to one side, brow furrowed.
When there’s something again, it’s not Chuck’s control room, it’s the bunker. Only it’s… it’s not
“I am finding fatherhood… complicated. There are many joys, but… it is dangerous, trying to keep Jack hidden from his father. And I confess, I-- I don’t understand why Dean and I nearly came to blows over the issue. Even after months, I… I thought that we were in general agreement on right and wrong, and…”
Dean’s trembling in his arms now, still clinging tight, still pressing close. He lays his head against Cas’, chin on his shoulder.
“I dunno, he pulled you out so you could save the world, anything else… you know, what’s it matter?”
If the research he does mostly involves bathroom mirrors, nudity, and the magic of multiple orgasms, that is nobody’s business but his own. Also the fifteen minutes solely devoted to rubbing his legs together like a cricket because they’re just so damn
It had to have been bad, but Dean’s been more tight-lipped than usual about it, which is fucking saying something… He watches the way his brother’s face crumples under the weight of his grief, the fury doused. His head bows beneath it, and when he looks up, it’s with the kind of wet eyes Sam knows to ignore if he doesn’t want him to get defensive. Dean’s always taken Cas dying hard. The last time, he was as broken as Sam’s ever seen him-- hell, even the first time, when Cas was a strange entity they could barely know or trust, Dean was broken up leaving him behind, his voice a little choked when they came back to find him gone. Even then, he’d lit up like it was his own personal miracle when Cas came back. Cas is the only person other than Sam himself to get Dean’s forgiveness after every misstep, maybe he should expect that Cas’ death would hit him so hard. But this… it’s hard to see. Hard to have Dean honest about this kind of hopelessness, but he needs to know what happened.
A thing Sam does on autopilot, because he’s not used to traveling with a human Cas.
“You ask him.” Dean folds his arms, not looking at Sam.
He doesn’t know what, because something like this, it’s not a small thing and it had to have a cost, and they’re going to have to fix it, but dammit, he doesn’t want fixing it to mean giving Dean up again… But whatever it is is gonna be hard on the boy, so he might as well let him have a little peace while he can get it. Not because he won’t talk to him about things, just… because they don’t always have to.
“Dean.” He chuckles, watches the slight change in Cas’ expression as she digests this information but remains unruffled by it. “And yeah, bigtime. But that’s just on the outside. No, we just… don’t really talk about it. I mean, you-- the you I know-- isn’t really into sitting around talking about feelings, either. You usually get kind of prickly and disappear if I ask about your feelings, and talking love life woes with an angel is just kind of… weird. Not bad! Like I’m not saying you couldn’t talk about your feelings with your usual Sam if you wanted to, just… we have really different experiences of the world, and we feel feelings differently. So I don’t know, it could just wind up being kind of frustrating because we’d never know what the other was talking about. I didn’t, uh… I didn’t even really know if angels fall in love the way humans do.”
“Hey, don’t go making out like this is some favor to you, I just don’t want a baby getting hold of a gun or nothing.” Dean looks away, shoves a too-large bite into his mouth as an excuse to not have to respond to anything else Cas might have to say.
“I hold him while he sleeps, to keep him safe. Sometimes I lie down with him.”
once.”
Angel blood junkie?
“You sure you’re not leaving anything out here? And you got no idea how this happened?” Bobby asks, as Dean settles grudgingly into the passenger’s seat.
“All you need to know, is you’re on the trail of a vamp nest. And you’re taking a little downtime before you hit it.”
And that has to be on purpose, the purr to his voice, the way he shifts, just enough to nudge back against Cas’ hips, it has to be that he wants what Cas does…
“I fucked up.” Dean groans.
My productivity has returned from the war!
… No angel was meant to feel the things I felt then. And when he held me in his arms, I was… I became incautious.”
“For who? You think if we ask real nice, he’s just gonna put everything back? We’re too late. And I don’t want…”

“Does this trouble you?”
“I think you try.”
“Yeah, but what does he
“Don’t hand me an easy win. If I didn’t want a challenge, I would play with someone else.”
“Nothing I couldn’t handle. Promise.” Dean’s voice comes gentler, he rubs a hand over Cas’ back, the other gripping his shoulder. “Or I would’ve called. C’mon, you know that. Always.”
“I do not need to consume anything, drink included.” He looks to him, uncertain, only to stiffen when Dean noses at his neck.
A part of him wants to promise to be back soon, a part of him knows he can’t promise he’ll be back at all, and that it would be a hell of a promise to have to break if things go bad. But at this point, what are the odds? It messes up the whole story to poof him now, doesn’t it?
And okay, so sue him, he entertains a fantasy of guiding him into proper position, maybe leaving his hands on Cas’ hips, maybe pressing up close to him and whispering encouragement in his ear…
Dean.
“Sam can’t write that update I needed from months ago.” John-- Sam can’t even think of this John Winchester as the same man as the father he remembers-- grabs a hefty book from one of the shelves, coming over to toss it onto the table. “Pronto.”
“I come to him when he is in need of me, for now.” His head cocks to one side. “When he has fully recovered, he will no longer need me. Until then… calling distance is the width and breadth of the universe.”
. And it’s great, if Sam can hold onto a shred of normalcy in this life, but…
“... You are
“He knows what’s good.”
He startles out of it, at Dean’s touch. Lets himself be led back inside.
“It just seems that as
“Hey, you don’t-- you don’t know a damn thing about it--”
He gets dropped in in time to see Dean take out the witch they’d been hunting, though not in time to help.
“I’m going to miss you, Lady Sam body.” He groans, flopping back on the bed after showering and putting on pants at last. “And I am
And he guesses he shouldn’t be surprised that no scars come with the change, given everything else, but it’s so weird that the boobs are just gone and the skin is taut over muscle, or at least a lot more than he’s used to. There’s a normal human softness, but it’s evenly distributed, and it’s not much. And it’s not like the boobs he had were a massive impediment, but they were still
“Dean, you tried to get me to eat
No matter how many times he does the thing where all of his organs fail because some angel is a huge dick, it never gets easier. He’d kind of hoped being prepared would count for something, but it’s still agonizing.
Cas gives the motel room an uncertain look, just for a moment, but then she turns to accompany Sam. They walk across the parking lot to where there’s a cheap diner with a lounge that hasn’t been updated since the seventies. There’s still a cigarette machine, though it hasn’t been stocked in a couple good decades.
“Fix what?”
Cas snorts. “Yes, Dean. Flight is what gets you ‘all backed up’. Not the amount of red meat you consume compared to the amount of fiber.”
Dean being in danger had never been something Cas handled ‘well’, to say the least. Now that they’re together, he’s even worse. And this time, the stupid plan had paid off, this time Dean hadn’t needed any grand rescue to get himself out of trouble. He’d hoped that would put Cas at ease, but it’s clear that it’s done the opposite, instead-- without anything to fight, to physically defeat in defense of his favorite human, Cas is left with the pent-up worry of what
The reality behind that door takes his breath away. Green, everywhere, like an oasis in the middle of so much nothing, birds twittering from their perches in all the plants and bees lazily bumbling between flowers and chickens pecking for bugs along the pathway that winds through it all, and it’s
“Sure.” He nods, closing the door softly behind him and leaving Dean to get some rest.
“Yeah. And-- I don’t know, dry it out a little, maybe?”
“You did? Dean, I-- Thank you.”
“Yes, I am aware that there is no one in your brother’s life who has never abandoned him or let him down at some point.”
“You feel… you feel like you don’t have control, right? Like there’s nothing you can do. You’re remembering stuff that’s behind us and you’re all caught up in regretting it, like you weren’t trying to do right at the time.”
“Take a walk.” Deanna says, digging through her duffel.
“No internal bleeding. No broken bones. I’m fine and dandy. Ugh, what
“Cas--”
“Try not to what?”
Sam leans over to look. It’s an angelarium-- Dean’s turned to Michael’s page to write ‘dick’ in the margins, which is surely not what he’s supposed to be updating the book with.
“Wait-- Wait, you were…?”
It puts a damper over the rest of their afternoon, and Cas isn’t with them, but Sam feels pretty confident-- this Cas is a lot like the one he remembers. This Cas is going to stick with them, it’s just whether or not Dean will let him.
, when the door opens loudly and a thunderous yawn interrupts the quiet.
“Here.” He whispers, and he’s just about to point out his lips, just about to put it all out there and hope Cas picks up on it, caution to the wind, he’s just about to fucking ask when--
Dean mumbles something else against him, something Sam doesn’t hear. The last thing he sees, before he finds himself yanked back out of the reality he’s been in, is the softening line of Cas’ shoulders and the softening lines of his expression, as he agrees to come out to the bar.
“What’s up, kid?” He sets one of the plates down in front of Sam. Dean doesn’t bat an eye at their father bringing them food, so that’s…
He rises and leans over him, lips at his ear.
“Wow.” He mutters under his breath-- if the words had allowed for any ambiguity, and they hadn’t, the look Cas shoots him makes it clear enough he’s including Sam in that. “What I’m saying is, it would mean a lot to him if you didn’t just run out.”
“What can you tell me about this curse?” Cas asks the both of them.
that.”
He finally turns from his contemplation of Dean, fixing Sam with a sorrowful look. “I thought I could change things, for you. I thought if I could spare you… I thought I could change the dark road you were destined to take. But I failed you. I failed you both. How did you know me?”
“Don’t be a bitch. It’s good. You want one? Either he brought enough for both of us or he does
He snorts, shaking his head, and he kisses Dean again, a constellation of soft kisses to his cheek.
“Doesn’t matter, unless I win. Then he becomes a part of this deal. But okay. I’ll bite.”
“Try and what? He’s not exactly built for that apple pie life, Dean. At least when he hunts with us, we can help him learn not to rely on all the powers he’s used to having. Save the angel mojo up for when he needs it. You really think he’d do better off on his own? You think he’ll never run into trouble? No one’s ever going to come for him because he’s low on juice and no one’s watching his back? He’s better off with us.”
There’s not much for entertainment, but there’s a record player, and Sam puts on something he doesn’t think anyone will object to before serving up bowls of mushroom soup. Not exactly just like mom used to make… though at least he can say he’s living up to her legacy of not being great in the kitchen. He nudges Dean awake, nods to Cas for help sitting Dean up-- and of course Dean bats weakly at both of them for daring to help him when he nearly died that afternoon.
Dean doesn’t need two people to ask him about his
Guy? Oops.
“I’ll let him know.” Sam rolls his eyes. Okay, so this might be a somewhat less stony and repressed version of his brother, but he’s still trying and failing to pretend he’s not embarrassed about getting hit in the face with cursed slime fighting a pretty novice witch. That feels about right somehow.
Well, he guesses it is, now. Most of the body is definitely his, even without the scars and breaks. But the tits, those…
Close enough to it.
Okay, that was… unsubtle. Then again, this is Cas, subtle might not really be the best tactic. He really has no idea what the best tactic is, because he’s in a universe where Cas did something… not-right or not-enough when he brought Dean back and now Dean’s a…
“I mean… give Dean some time. Don’t write him off just because he needs time to wrap his head around you being you.”
“Thank you, no, I’ll handle my own bloodstains, no need to trouble yourself.”
“Yeah, hunting vamps during shark week is the frigging
“No. But… I have seen them in passing. Outside of the atmosphere. The… the distances are the same, the orientation, when you’re still within this system, but they still look… different. At least, they do to me. But perhaps my experience is not universal.”
“I have conditions.” Cas says, as they get out of the car, at the warehouse.
“Of course you-- Well, no, not here, I mean… none of us belong
, and he’s healed now.
“What did you say to piss him off? For me it was suggesting I’m an adult. Also I could kick his ass at pool.”
“No, I did not know.”
“Uh… sure, yeah. You feeling okay?”
. Sam, when he moved in me--”
“Holy shit, Cas?”
“Sammy… I’m sorry. This is the only choice I’ve got.” Dean says, and suddenly Sam’s organs are working, and suddenly Sam can’t breathe. Dean closes his eyes, head tilting back, he rolls his shoulders, tries for a couple good deep breaths as Sam struggles to get the words out. He’s not actively dying, but something stops his tongue just the same as he watches Dean prepare to become some dick angel’s puppet. “Okay…”
-SAM-
“No, I know. Nobody’s going to give Michael a meatsuit. God, you’re already on the run as it is, and… well. Are you sure about this? Going in there?”
“Yeah. Like that. I mean-- and I could help you, if you wanted. Give you some pointers with… You know, I’m here to help.”
. Like… maybe I win and I ask you to run an errand for me, or… you win and I have to clean your room--”
Also, Sam does not want to be the guy saying ‘vagina’ out loud in a restaurant.
“Yeah, I guess the other angels are kind of dicks.”
when you lose your virginity.”
“Mm, the way I remember it, the highlight reel was a bonus that I offered, not part of the terms of our deal. You’ll know what you need to know when you get there.”
“No. It allows him to complete his healing… but no part of me could make him purer than he is. At his most broken, he was a
“But she was safe?”
The thing is, Dean’s a hunter in this world same as in their own. Wears the same basic uniform-- well, he doesn’t know if the jeans and boots are the same-the same, but the jacket thrown over the back of the booth looks like their dad’s jacket, she’s got a flannel shirt on over a faded band tee, and her hair might be short because it won’t get grabbed or get in her eyes in a fight, without the trouble of putting it up, but the overall look is very butch. Sam gives himself-- herself, he guesses, or… Sam gives themself a discreet look, only to get distracted by suddenly having cleavage. Okay, table that for later, he’ll assess the cleavage in private. It’s his cleavage, he’s allowed to do that.
“And yours are equally green, Dean. I love them. I love your freckles too.” He caresses Dean’s cheek, like he’s tracing constellations.
“The robbery?”
“When I raised you up…”
“What happened to the souls that were in hell?” Eileen asks.
The garden where Sam and Eileen get married is the same one they’ve taken walks in most days for the last few months, just down the road in Smith Center, with a huge-ass windmill towering over a children’s playground. It seems kind of fitting, in a bizarre way. They’re close enough to the bunker that they’re holding the reception there rather than in the park, even though the fairy lights on the old Dutch mill do look kinda pretty now that the light’s fading.
And yeah, wow. That’s actually genius. He surges back to his feet and tells Cas that, then pulls his shirt off over his head and shoves his pants down at record speed, pulls Cas down onto the bed, flips over onto his belly and gets ready for his muscles to turn to sweet, sweet jelly. He can’t remember being more content, more deeply satisfied, in his life.
“We should…” Cas laughs as Dean kisses him again, tries to continue talking. “Should move to the bed, love.”
Thank you so much for your support for this version of Dean, from the bottom of my little autochorissexual heart. — Phoenix
“It’s like they’re all only getting a part of the story…” muses Dean.
“That’s a start,” says Dean.
Claire’s mouth drops open slightly. “Um, okayyy. I am not sure I needed to know that but also congratulations to you guys. I’m just going to find… food. Yeah.” She backs away.
“We found her…" Dean begins, as soon as they get within earshot. He doesn’t have a chance to finish before Carter hugs him tightly out of nowhere, overcome with relief. Dean hesitates for a moment before he lets himself half-return the hug.
“Go ahead.”
“Am I not supposed to say it again? Now that you know I love you, I want to tell you all the time.”
‘That’s cool, you don’t… have to.” Dean licks around the rim of Cas’s ear again, hums contentment. “You can go… faster, if you want. Just… up and down.”
“Am I late?” asks Jack, appearing in the kitchen.
“Dean, that’s not…” Sam scrubs a hand over his face. “First of all, you-- No. I mean that’s not how
Cas doesn’t answer.
“The universe certainly has a way of reminding me.”
“Yeah.” He nods. “I am.”
“We don’t need Cas.” Dean snaps, bills crumpling in his fist.
He can’t change that their night went a little off the rails. But he can do this-- he can put things back on track.
this? Is this dirt and salt?”
Oh, and Sam’s officially reached the age where he’s turning into Bobby. Although, as far as father figures to turn into go… Yeah, no contest.
“Shit!” The car jerks, he nearly overcorrects. Judging by the weather, he should be watching out for ice on the roads. Trust Chuck to pick this moment to slam him into.
Dean grabs a book, flipping through looking for information on curses transmissible by slime, though he doesn’t take a seat at the table, just plants a hand next to the book and bends over it.
“You could call Cas.” Sam suggests. “This might be the time to ask for a little miracle. Unless you know something I don’t about dragging lakes. And even then, I don’t think we want to sit around with hair dryers trying to get the bones dried out enough to burn.”
This time, Chuck doesn’t give him a highlight reel, so much as one big fight. Out of all the times he’s seen Cas and Dean’s friendship break up-- at least, all the times he can remember-- this is by far the ugliest. He kind of wants to reach through the screen and smack Dean upside the head, but the Sam in that world just takes Jack-- who’s a baby here-- and edges out of the room to leave them to it.
“That’s okay. You can rest.” He strokes at Cas’ cheek, their noses nearly touch, Cas brings his other hand up, shaky, still shaky, his thumb finds the edge of Dean’s grin and traces it to a dimple.
“You’re not thinking straight.” Sam hauls his brother up off the floor, getting an arm around him. “It’s the
And Dean’s got that inevitable well-timed boner for Cas to do with as he pleases.
, and obviously he loves him and this is great, if also worrying, but he didn’t think he’d have his first Dean-induced headache quite so soon after getting him back. “Secondly-- I mean, what do you think virginity even is, if it was an actual physical state? Dean, you literally
“I don’t have much choice, I know the position I’m in. This is the one place I know that Jack and I can be safe while I rest and formulate a plan for whatever comes next. But of course I would. Of course. I just… Do you remember, once-- almost a dozen years ago, I suppose that’s a long time for you…”
“Great. Hard and fast, just how we like to hit ‘em.”
“I most certainly have never called anyone, let alone you, a ‘butt-munch’.”
“It’s good to be back, thank you, but I’m afraid I’ll have to catch up with you later, Sam. I have a very pressing matter to deal with, in your brother’s room.”
It’s quiet, in their bedroom, just the two of them. Cas leans in, and they kiss once more, soft. Dean lays his weary head on the pillow, and rests.
“It was so nice, trying on dresses. I knew I couldn’t afford them. And I didn’t seem to have a wallet or a bag but I thought it was a dream, you know? But I didn’t want to take it off, it looked so pretty. And so I just walked out. And when the alarms went off, I ran, and I hid in an old, empty house. And when I went to sleep, I woke up in my bedroom again.”
“It is?” asks Dean, and he hates the note of self-doubt in his voice.
Dean smiles even more widely and kisses Cas again, soft. “No, bro, that’s uh, called a blow job. And, uh, it wouldn’t be my first rodeo.”
“Am I making you swoon, Cas?” Dean laughs back, already walking Cas towards the mattress.
“See you, Jack,” says Sam, but Dean barely hears him. There on the side of the road, looking slightly dazed but otherwise unharmed, is Cas.
“How do they know what Jack said to us…?” starts Dean, and then it comes to him, just as Cas says it too.
“Hngggghhh…” Castiel moans.
“Don’t know if you heard...” Pause for effect. “Sam’n’Eileen are expecting.” He hears her little gasp, and he’s kind of thrilled he’s the one who got to break the news to her. “I figure, Sam doesn’t need a big brother any more, but those kids you’re talking about do, and I’ve got runs on the board, y’know?”
Dean steps into the room, and closes the door behind him, stands there for a moment with his back to it, drinking his fill. Dean feels warmth welling up in him just looking.
“Thought I was dreaming at first. I’ve always —” The kid trails off, looks around, starts again. “ — always known I was a girl. And I’ve always been a girl in my dreams. So I just thought this was a dream too.”
“No demons?” asks Cas. “Please hold.” He cocks his head, the way he does when he’s listening, fingers splayed out on the table.
He strokes one firm hand down Cas’ thigh, and licks his lips. Cas puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder, tightens his grip as Dean breathes warm air onto Cas’ smooth skin. He smiles as Cas hardens more, his dick lengthening, rising, the skin shifting. He looks up, meets Cas’ gaze.
Dean sometimes wonders whether Sam’s okay — they both went through a lot in the last few years, but it sometimes feels like Sammy’s still on high alert. No idea what they’re supposed to do about that. His experience with therapists has not exactly been what you’d call positive and reassuring. He parks it to deal with it later and tunes back in to hear Jack filling Sam and Cas in on some detail of the Heaven overhaul.
Dean bites his lip before standing up a little straighter. "Want my advice, kid?" he asks, his voice kind but serious. "Don't spend too much time second-guessing. Don't waste your shot. I almost lost mine."
“What?” he says through his mouthful. “S’good pie.”
Dean looks at Cas, unwavering, waiting. Cas looks back.
“What can I say?” says Castiel. “I don’t have the luxury of forgetting things like that.”
“Uh, you,” says Dean, flicking through the clipboard in his hands before he looks up. “Freckles. Paperwork says the kid’s in for theft. Anything unusual about the case?”
It’s not particularly a memory Dean wants to think about at that moment, in such a different space, with Cas, but he lets himself be honest. “Lee wouldn’t let me,” he says, and he looks away. “I wanted to kiss him, so bad.”
“I got it for you,” says Castiel. “I know you like attractive women from Asia with large breasts.”
“Don’t, man,” Dean starts. “I used to like the character I was playing but after a while, I didn’t anymore.”
“And you, kiddo. I was real sorry when I thought we lost you. Our Sam here needs a steady hand, you know? You two been keeping busy with all your documentin’?”
“What about Dean as a middle name?” suggests Dean. “And you could call him James as a first name.” He tries to school his features at least a little.
“Well, sure, Sam. What, did you think I’d get some deputy to call you? Uff da, course I’m going to call you boys myself! Ya been well? I heard Eileen is living with you now.”
the ribs?” Dean asks.
“I know,” says Dean. He takes a swig of the beer. Cas does the same.
Cas shrugs out of his trenchcoat, folds it neatly and places it carefully on the chair next to the green sofa. Dean glances around his room, as if he’s seeing it for the first time.
Claire, looking up from where she's texting the angel possessing the corpse of her dad: Sure.
“All right, kid,” he says. “You really think you can pull this off?” He raises an eyebrow, dares not to hope.
Dean considers the darkened room. “So, uh, that was more intense than last time?”
Just as he’s thinking that, Greta asks, “What does ‘WE WILL MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR!’ mean?”
And Dean tells him — slowly, picks his way through the anger that’s always simmering below the surface, touches on his Dad, unfinished business, not having an outlet for it any more. James says he knows how that feels, that fear that any minute, some random words will trigger uncontrollable rage and you’ll come to and find out you’ve done something you regret.
“It’s a possibility,” Cas acknowledges. “But the point is that there is also the possibility of redemption. Otherwise, why bother? Where do you think the word ‘purge’ comes from, Dean? It’s about purification, cleansing your soul.”
There’s a moment of silence on the phone and he considers taking it all back, hanging up, saying it’s all a prank, a mistake.
“I wouldn’t.”
ever taught him, was that it was wrong, dirty, weak to want it. God, what a mess.
“And uh…” Dean looks around, but doesn’t see Max’s sister. “I heard —”
“Yeah,” says Dean. “You’re not losing it but kid, the thing is, when you ask to see her — Greta doesn't exactly look how you might remember."
When he wakes up in the morning, the sensation of someone tucked up behind him is alien enough, but it takes another three seconds for his brain to identify the insistent hardness pressing into his butt cheek. He’s almost surprised to note that he is cataloguing the sensations sleepily, noting other differences, musculature and hair, the musky scent of Cas, draped over him. The weight of him. How different it is, too, not to be wondering how he’s going to extract himself, make excuses, and get out without being a douche about it. It’s like a dream. Such a pleasant dream. He wakes up a little more. That’s really Cas. Cas is back, real and solid, in his
Cas pats the bedside next to him. Dean shakes his head.
I also need to thank a couple of tumblr posters for the following:
“But there’s beer. We had beer last night. And the bar is still there.” He writes down,
Dinner is an experiment he’s had in mind for a while — a supercharged version of Mom’s casserole, with braised pork loin, and sweet corn and diced red peppers, smothered in four different types of cheese. It sounds enough like a fancy pork nachos that he’s coached Cas through making a fresh guacamole to go with it, avocado and tomatoes, just kinda smashed together, topped with cilantro and the tang of lime juice. Every time they’ve bumped hips or elbows in the kitchen, it’s been a little dance, touch lingering a little longer than it should.
No monsters. Hot damn. It’s a lot to process. In a way, it’s everything he could have hoped for. They’ve finally done it. They’re finally free, right? No more hunting. Guilt-free retirement. He gets to have his happily-ever-after, maybe. But it also feels too good to be true, like any moment, someone will pop out like they’re on Candid Camera, laughing at how gullible one Dean Winchester is. What, you thought you could have a normal life? Joke’s on you, buddy.
Carter follows Dean’s gaze towards the car, nodding as he joins the dots. "But... how? I want to make this work but we're just kids... how do I not mess this up?
“We could call him John, after your father?” Eileen says to Sam, as if Dean had never spoken.
Claire: Oh this is rich coming from the guy who's banging the possessed corpse of my dad
“Nah, I’m peachy. I just want to make you feel good, Cas,” Dean says. He hesitates, on the verge of saying more.
“French toast.” Dean hugs him back, tight. “I won’t forget.”
“You could call him Dean,” says Dean, cheerfully, unpacking the pasta onto the shelves. He’s unlikely to have his own spawn, unless there’s something Cas hasn’t told him about angels — and now that’s occurred to him, he wants it out of his head.
“Outback Kangaroo Feast?” Cas says, as they walk back to the car. “Happy Hips? Beaverdam? Where do they get these names? Lamb and sweet potato stew,” he reads. “Actually, that one doesn’t sound bad.”
“Uh, sure thing,” says Freckles. “I’ll get it from the office and I’ll be right back. You stay here, you betcha.”
“You wanna tell us what’s really going on?”
Thank goodness, Dean thinks. This kid really loves her. He wasn’t sure what he would have said to Greta if Carter had reacted poorly.
“One last thing, though,” Dean says. “We’re getting her out of juvie, but the only way we can make this work for her is to get her to live with some friends of ours, a ways from here. I’m sorry, I wish it could have been closer, but it’s for the best.”
Thank you so, so much to Josie for the sensitivity read, and to badrituals and CallenOftheNorth for the beta reads. Obviously any remaining errors are all ours. (Phoenix also wants to thank jad & Huntress on the ProfoundBond server for writing advice that seriously improved the story — thank you!!!)
Dean hangs his head at that, a bit. That’s absolutely who he has been. “Maybe 15 years ago, Cas. Not gonna deny that. But that was before I met Charlie.”
Dean nods, wordless, and Cas’s hands fumble with Dean’s belt buckle, slip the belt out of the loops, flick open the button on the jeans and gently lower his pants. They both realize at the same time that the shoes need to come off first, and Dean laughs as Cas kneels down to help untie the laces on his boots, and help him out of them. Cas nuzzles against Dean’s thigh as he comes back up and Dean leans down to step out of the jeans. Dean’s standing in his bedroom with a man practically kneeling in front of him, wearing nothing but dark green cotton briefs and somehow, he feels only warmth and reverence for his — lover? Boyfriend? He realizes they’ve never actually discussed it.
“I don’t care what she looks like. I…” Carter breaks off, and screws his eyes up tight for a second, but it doesn’t stop the tears escaping down his cheek. "It must have been so hard… for her, I mean. Not being able to tell me. Not being able to tell anyone."
“Your sister?” repeats Dean. “Identical twin I’m guessing. The one who was dating Carter Larson.”
“Your eyes — they’re so blue, Cas. I ain’t never seen anything like ’em.”
And then he feels — light. Cas’ grace reaching into him from behind. He braces for pain but unlike every other time Cas has touched his soul, this doesn’t hurt. This is — he has no words. He feels wholly loved, as he is, like there is nothing more he needs to do, no one else he needs to be. He is entirely enough as himself.
“Of course not,” says Cas. “There are no more monsters. You are a creation of the divine.”
Dean squeezes his shoulder. “It’s never not going to be weird, Cas. Just have to accept that.”
he knows. Isn’t sure whether it’s obvious Cas stayed in his bed. Isn’t sure whether he cares if Sam knows that.
Cas goes to take his own shirt off and Dean stops him. “Let me,” he says, and Cas drops his hands to his sides.
