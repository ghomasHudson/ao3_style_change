His feet stop just in front of Tony, but he doesn’t say anything. Tony looks up, slowly, afraid of what he’s going to see in Steve’s face. Anger. Disappointment. Betrayal. Their eyes meet and it’s worse than that. Steve’s eyebrows are pinched together, that small wrinkle dug deep between them, and he looks back at Tony with so much hurt in his gaze that Tony feels it like a punch to the chest.
His eyes close as he dances, movements somehow both sporadic and graceful, and as the lights flash across his face, hat tipped precariously over his forehead, Steve is struck by how beautiful he is. He’s never thought of Tony that way, known objectively that he was attractive, handsome even. But when he looks at him now he’s rendered speechless.
Steve hasn’t moved a muscle, is still standing stiff and tense at the far end of the living room, watching Tony pace. He takes a deep breath, lets it out, then opens his mouth. “You have a pretty low opinion of the team, and of me, if you really think those things,” he says. Tony opens his mouth to argue but doesn’t really have anything to say to that because he does believe what he said is true. He closes his mouth again and says nothing.
He could find him. Easily. JARVIS could run a search, see where he’s based, specifically, when he comes back.
Tony must think he’s a fan. Or a member of the whole Team Cap movement. Why else would the Accords bother him so much, some boring banker in Switzerland.
“You’re welcome,” Steve says with all the sincerity he can convey. It’s killing him, seeing this side of Tony, parts of him he’s never seen before, not because he didn't have the opportunity but because he never took the time to look. Tony’s always been so strong, so untouchable in his mind, that he never stopped to think that he’s human, that he hurts and has been hurt, that he might need help, even when he acts like he doesn’t.
“What part of “there was no time” are you not getting here, Stars ’n Stripes? There. Was. No. Time.” Tony makes sure to enunciate, just in case Cap didn’t catch it the first five times he said it. “It was take out the baddie when I had a clear opening, or wait and let him kill another dozen people until you all could get your asses in gear and help me out. Sorry, but I went with Option A.” Tony stands and pushes his chair back, ready to go. He knows he's not being fair, they got there as soon as they could, but he’s had about enough of this shit, and if Steve expects him to sit there and watch civilians die when he’s able to do something about it, he’s going to be waiting a long time.
Steve smirks. “That and an upgrade to my suit. The guys at HQ try, but it somehow never fits right when they’re done with it. You do it best,” Steve says, pouting with big, sad eyes. Tony doesn’t fall for it for one second. Okay, maybe for a second.
One last quick shake of a hand to a man Tony vaguely recalls worked with his father once upon a time, and he’s free, almost stumbling into the elevator. He’d blame it on the alcohol, but he's not that drunk. Kind of eased up on that after he got back from Afghanistan, for reasons.
There’s a moment of panic when Tony remembers the arc reactor, how could he forget about it, but then the shirt is open and his chest is exposed and Steve pauses briefly to catch Tony’s eye.
“What the fuck are you doing in my tower?” he snarls. He’s beyond pleasantries and being politically correct. If they want to storm his tower like a fucking battlefield, he’ll treat them like enemies.
“No, Rogers, I’m just that much of a dick. Yes, I mean it,” he says, rolling his eyes. Steve laughs happily and lifts him up, literally spins him around once before setting him back down and kissing him breathless. Tony feels like his life is a movie right now, a fucking chick flick and he hates chick flicks but maybe it’s okay if his life is one, because he’s deliriously happy and Steve is too and he’s totally okay with this, so he’ll take the chick flick, no problem.
The moment he steps out of his outrageously expensive Audi he’s engulfed in a bear hug, and Rhodey really does give the best hugs. It’s nice to see him outside of the Tower, away from the concerned face and worried eyes Tony’s so used to seeing on Rhodey lately.
He hears the door open behind him, then close gently. He thinks maybe he should care that someone’s entered his room without knocking, but again, it doesn’t matter. Nothing does.
Tony's been keeping up a constant pressure on his hand, squeezing occasionally, so when his hand suddenly goes limp Steve feels it and he panics. The EMTs assure him Tony's alive, he's just lost consciousness again, and Steve sits back on his heels, closing his eyes, tuning everything out but Tony's breathing and the hand in his. He stays that way until they land on the roof of the Romanian hospital half an hour later.
Sam texts him regularly, keeping him updated on Avengers business, and on Steve. Tony never responds, but Sam doesn’t stop, good guy that he is. Tony should buy him something nice, maybe. A pet, or something. They could keep it at HQ for cheering up purposes. He’s sure even heroes need that sometimes.
"Tony, it's nothing, honestly. The serum will heal them in a couple of hours. They'll be good as new by tomorrow morning." Tony just shoots a glare back at him and continues dragging Steve down to the medical floor.
Tony sprawls bonelessly across one couch, legs askew and head thrown back, and leaves Steve to settle on the other. The music is loud, the bass line so deep Steve can feel it pulsing throughout his entire body along with the beat of the music. People push through the crowds to reach the bars, waiting in line for overpriced cocktails, but they’re removed from it in their little corner. Steve can’t relax, exactly, but he is glad that Tony decided on the VIP section, for his paranoia’s sake at the very least.
So he heads to the lab after his run, coffee in one hand and a stack of pancakes in the other, because he’s willing to bet that Tony hasn’t eaten since he woke up (that is, if he slept at all).
“How you don’t trust me to make the right decision! It’s like the Accords, you won’t open your eyes and see that there’s more than one way to do things here, it’s not all black and white, it’s not you versus me here—“
Steve’s pupils are so dilated there’s only a tiny ring of blue around the outside. He’s panting, his muscles taut with holding back from grinding down on Tony’s body beneath him. “What, Tony? What’s wrong?”
Steve opens his eyes slowly, eyelashes clumped together. Tony gives him a sad little smile before he closes the distance and presses their lips together. It’s salty and wet, and his heart jumps into his throat at the same time his stomach drops to his knees.
When Tony squeezes weakly back he almost loses it, choking out a laugh that sounds perilously close to a sob. “Tony, oh my god, thank god.” He's muttering Tony's name helplessly when Tony cries out, trying to sit up. Steve firmly pushes him back down, tells him to stop, then calls out to the EMTs for some kind of drugs to numb the pain.
Tony’s another year older, living the same old life, when he decides to visit HQ for the first time since he left all those months ago. Steve’s out with Bucky at a Met’s game, so it’s the perfect time, if there is such a thing. Rhodey’s asked him to come, check out the facility and the upgrades they’ve made to it, so he gives in and drives upstate one Saturday afternoon before he thinks on it too much.
He has a very brief internal argument, tells himself it’s a bad idea and then resolutely ignores himself, before Steve motions the bartender over.
He drags the Captain into the elevator, babbling all the while. “—and I was thinking we needed a HQ anyway, and now that SHIELD’s gone it’s even more necessary, good thing I planned ahead. Genius, and all that. Anyway, Bruce is already all set up here, though he takes off whenever he feels like it so I hardly know where he is half the time. And I’m out more often than not, still picking up the pieces out in California and I’m always out of town on business and it’s really a cool set up, if you think about it—“
Tony’s picking at the double chocolate brownie on his tray when he hears someone clear their throat behind him. He turns on his seat to see who it is.
Its not like Steve's never seen someone die before. He was a soldier in World War II after all, he's seen men shot in the head without time to even shout a warning, he's seen soldiers step on grenades that take the entire bottom half of their body off. He knows death intimately. It haunts his dreams, dogs his footsteps constantly, insinuates itself into his thoughts to the point where when he first meets people he wonders how they're going to die, and if he'll be around to see it and mourn.
And again, Steve bites his tongue. Friends didn’t keep secrets like this. Friends didn’t keep secrets from each other, like the truth about their parents’ deaths.
on you.” There’s a flash of pain on Steve’s face at the words before he’s shaking his head doggedly.
want it to sound that way, but elaborates regardless. “We don’t have to… I mean, it would just be nice to have the company. So I’m not alone for the rest of the year, and everything. Because that would just be tragic.”
He gradually makes his way to quieter, less crowded neighborhoods (or as quiet as a New York neighborhood can really get on New Years Eve), and he lets out a deep sigh of relief. This was a good idea, walking back. He’s felt so confined lately, almost claustrophobic, and it seems like he’s never alone anymore unless he initiates the lock down protocol in the workshop. Pepper’s always hovering, and Happy, and Phil Coulson stops by the Malibu house like he owns it at least once a week to ask pointed questions about the Iron Man suit. And there’s security, and SI people, and hell, even Rhodey calling him every few days to check up on him. He needs a damn break from the babysitting, from Tony Stark’s life.
“Safe.” Steve says, voice flat, and there’s so much hidden underneath those words Tony wants to scream.
It’s morning, that much he can tell, because even though Tony installed the best blackout shades money can buy in his penthouse apartment, Steve prefers to wake up with the sun, something stupid about natural light and Vitamin D and blah blah blah. Tony thinks it’s just his attempt to get Tony to wake up before noon.
Loud, clunking steps this time, and Tony knows they’ve sent in the big gun. Too bad he doesn’t give a fuck.
Steve takes a breath and lets it out in a gust. “You don’t have to answer, I’m just curious.” Tony doesn't say anything, just gestures for Steve to get a move on. He takes another deep breath. “Why did you sign? The Accords, I mean.”
He smiles as he says it, softening the blow, and Steve smiles back, playing the part. Tony walks over to give him a last kiss, “For luck,” he says, and then he’s gone.
“No worries, I can settle for some other rag tonight,” he says, joking, and the barista laughs, says “Sorry” again, and gets back to wiping down the counters.
Tony shakes his head. “No, go right ahead,” he says. “I thought you were at a Met’s game with Barnes?”
“Off,” Tony mumbles, and the spray stops instantly. He opens the shower door and grabs a fluffy towel from a shelf, rubbing his hair vigorously and wrapping the towel around his waist, still mostly dripping all over the tile. He makes an executive decision to forego clothes for the moment.
Tony taps back into Steve over his comm. The little window in the upper right hand corner of his HUD shows their panic room. Jamie is playing with his teething ring in his crib while Steve is sitting at the computer desk, watching the raid on the screens set up there. He speaks into their private comm line.
He's dizzy by the time Steve pulls back but Tony follows his lips anyway, wanting more. Steve gives his lips a soft peck then pushes him back onto the pillows firmly. His face is flushed and his lips are kiss-swollen and Tony has no idea what he's getting himself into but he doesn't even care, he just wants more of it, every day for as long as Steve will have him.
There’s a banging sound from the stairwell and Bruce looks up at him, eyebrows raised, and Tony shrugs.
Steve leans back into the couch, sinking into the cushions. A couple of times a waitress stops by to see if he needs anything. He asks for a water once, but only has a sip before he’s back to nursing his Asgardian cocktail. He almost doesn’t want to let this feeling go, of being carefree, almost invincible. It’s been so long since he’s been good and drunk, and he’s on his way there tonight.
Steve doesn’t look away, his eyes flicker between Tony’s, searching. He must find what he’s looking for, because he leans in, and Tony just has time to panic before their lips are touching and they’re kissing and oh my god Captain America is kissing him how the fuck did this happen.
He wakes up slowly, senses gradually relaying signals to his sleep-hazy brain. He’s warm, but when he shifts his legs to stretch them out his feet brush across cool blankets. The room is quiet, just the sounds of the air conditioner running and the barely there hum of electronics. There’s a dull rumble of thunder in the distance promising shitty weather for the day, and it kind of fits the mood.
Tony’s always been a man of many words, blithe words that flow out of him effortlessly, but Steve Rogers has a way of making him lose them all when he needs them most. He can’t speak, doesn’t even know what he would say if he were able to, so he just nods dumbly. Steve smiles so beautifully it lights up Tony’s soul, filling all of the cracks he’s gained over a lifetime and over the last year, and he reaches up to cup Tony’s cheeks, swipe under Tony’s eyes with his thumbs, pushing away tears Tony didn’t even know he’d shed, before he leans forward to capture Tony’s lips in a soft, perfect kiss.
“Tony, I love you,” Steve’s voice breaks. Sam steps forward to put a firm hand on his shoulder. Steve takes a deep breath. “I think we need to take some time off, to figure this out. I can see what I’m doing to you, and I need to straighten myself out before I can trust myself to be around you again.”
“And don’t shave!” Steve looks back at him, eyebrow raised, rubbing his prickly cheeks self-consciously. “We’re not undercover, but we don’t exactly want to be mobbed all night either. Keep the scruff. Plus, five o’clock shadow is super sexy nowadays!” With that, Tony shoos him away and Steve heads out to find Natasha.
“I never meant to hurt you,” Steve says through his tears, reaching for Tony’s hand. Tony shakes his head, pushes his hand away, and hurt flashes across Steve’s face, but Tony ignores it. He rolls over in the bed, turning his back to Steve, and ignores the other man’s presence as best he can. Steve stays for a few more minutes, inches of space feeling like miles between them, before he finally stands and leaves the room, walking out of Tony’s life.
He turns and his eyes are so big and dark and knowing Steve wants to be mad, wants to scream at him,
“Wow, they’re not kidding when they say ‘playboy’, huh?” he says, shaking Tony’s hand, and the words sting a bit but Tony brushes it off with a chipper “Yep!” and a toothy grin.
“Yes! He’s here because— because I don’t trust myself around you, alright?” Tony scoffs. Steve makes an agitated noise and continues. “You make me so angry, and I don’t trust myself not to hurt you again. Sam’s here to help me control myself if I get upset.”
Tony pushes his way toward the elevator, gritting his teeth through a smile, nodding politely when people call out to him. He needs some air. Everything’s so tight in here, people crowded together, the obnoxious braying laughter, friendly debates, bragging and boasting, and Tony’s going to lose his shit if he doesn’t get out of here in the next 30 seconds.
Tony shakes his head jerkily, shuts his eyes, sighs out a breath full of resignation and self-hatred. “I didn’t say no,” he murmurs back.
“Adorable,” he says. He’s about to ask their names when there’s a loud rumble above them and a few rocks shake loose from the ceiling. Tony’s standing before the shaking stops, making his way over to their equipment, ensuring nothing has been damaged irreparably. They’re making the miniaturized arc reactor tomorrow, they can’t afford a set back. Everything looks okay, and Tony hopes it stays that way, because they don’t have enough materials to make a second prototype.
“Widow, cover Hawkeye. Thor, Hulk, keep smashing. I need to go find Cap,” Tony says shortly. Thor’s lightning is useless against the machines; Doom had apparently accounted for lightning gods in his minion planning and any kind of electrical attack only boosts their battery power. Reminds him of when he and Thor first crossed paths, actually.
They work on Tony for what seems like hours, but is probably closer to 30 minutes, before he starts to wake up. Steve starts to shake, because he honestly didn't know if Tony would ever wake up again, and the triage team had been unable to offer any reassurances. He's sitting between Bucky and Thor, and Thor's got a calming hand on his leg and though Bucky makes no move this time to reach out to him, his shoulder is a comforting presence against Steve's. There's a blood bag attached to Tonys left arm and an IV attached to the opposite hand, and right now they're working on sewing together Tony's stomach from where the armor tore through his skin like it was tissue paper.
Tony laughs, then groans when it jostles his injuries. Pepper is there immediately, smoothing his hair back from his forehead and making soft noises, glaring at Clint. Clint doesn't look remotely sorry.
Panting, Tony just nods, giving the okay to whatever question Steve is asking, and then Steve’s looking down at his chest, straight at the reactor.
Steve takes the dismissal gracefully, just smiles slightly and leans in to give Tony a tiny peck on the mouth. Tony licks his lips as Steve pulls away, opens his eyes. He didn’t even know he’d closed them.
“Steve, please, please don’t go, I’m so sorry, I’m an asshole, what can I do, please just tell me what to do.” He’s begging now, and he doesn’t care. If it keeps Steve here, with him, he’ll beg for the rest of his life.
Tony’s about to ask him what he wants from him, specifically, when Rogers beats him to the punch. The Captain looks up and pins him against the couch with his startlingly blue eyes.
Steve grins happily in return, making his way over to where Tony stands by the wet bar of the common floor. Tony reaches out to shake his hand, but Steve snorts and pulls him into a warm hug. He goes without too much resistance, engulfed in body heat and the smell of Steve, Old Spice and spicy aftershave and something just
Tony’s down in the lab one afternoon when FRIDAY tells him that Steve is calling. Tony’s vision tunnels for a brief second, then sharpens. His heart is rabbiting in his chest when he tells her to put him through.
Tony hums contentedly as the hot water pounds down onto his back, pillowing his head on his arms against the wall. He wonders what Steve’s making. Steve’s actually a fantastic cook, used to throw together some awesome dinners for the team when Tony had been sure there’d been only leftovers, pasta, and canned soups in the pantry. He’s good at making something out of nothing, that’s for sure. Prime example: Tony Stark.
He's swimming in blackness, thick and swirling around him, colors blending like oils pressing down heavily on his mind. There are noises, soft and rhythmic, sounds that lull him back under the waves, beeping and humming and murmuring. He drifts for a while, not quite conscious, until his brain identifies the source of the murmuring. Someone is talking to him softly, has been for a while now. He tries to pull himself out of the murky darkness, but the closer the voice gets the more pain he feels radiating throughout his body. There's something in his mouth, choking him and he starts to panic, and then the voice is shushing him and there are hands grabbing his and pulling them away from his face, and then all his energy saps away and he's so tired and the current pulls him back under.
Upon stepping into the sleek lounge area, he gets his first close-up look at the new and improved Captain America. He hasn’t seen him in person since the Chitauri battle over two years ago, though he’s kept tabs on him in the meantime (along with anonymous donations here and there to fund the whole My Best Friend Is A Psychotic Assassin And I’m Going To Save Him Because I’m Just That Good Of A Guy thing). Tony doesn’t really like what he sees.
Tony's whole body jerks like he's been electrocuted and he releases Steve's hand, jumping up from his chair.
Steve makes a sound and it wrenches at Tony's chest and suddenly Steve's got Tony's face in his hands and is turning it forcibly towards him.
Steve almost can't believe it. They're on their way to Latveria on Tony's private jet, and if all goes well he'll have Bucky back in less than 12 hours. He's antsy, but he forces himself to sit still in his seat and go over plans with the team, blueprints of the abandoned office building Bucky's been hiding out in, maps of the city, escape routes, backup plans, other locations Bucky has used as crash pads in the past. Steve is slightly amazed at how much information Tony's got on Bucky's habits and hideouts, and it's just another surprise in the form of Tony Stark, genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. Steve tucks it away to analyze another time.
“Well, uh. I’m a banker,” Steve says haltingly, and Tony smiles, patient. Steve takes a deep breath, tries to think of something Tony might not connect to Steve Rogers. Which is actually more difficult than it seems, because Tony knows Steve Rogers almost better than he knows himself, now that he thinks about it. “I’ve only lived overseas for a few months now, so I’m still learning basic German. Visited before, though, toured Europe when I was younger.” He shrugs, hopes Tony will pick up the threads of the conversation.
Steve stands and stretches his body out, spine cracking from being hunched over his drawing pad for so long. He’s just opening an expensive looking wooden cabinet near the exit door when a blonde flight attendant appears next to him.
The elevator chimes, announcing its arrival at the ground floor, and the doors glide open smoothly. The lobby is all but deserted, everyone already upstairs, ready to celebrate the start of the new year. Tony pushes himself away from the wall and strides out across the marble floor, footsteps echoing loudly in the cavernous room. He nods to the security guard and exits through the revolving glass door, shooting off a quick text to his driver telling him that he’s going to walk back to the hotel tonight. Happy responds immediately with a “Yes Boss” as Tony’s stepping out onto the pavement.
He slips every once in a while, his eyes flicking just a little bit further to the right, and his gut clenches and his throat tightens so painfully he wonders if he’ll be able to draw in his next breath. Steve’s dresser sits there, same as the day he left it, a pile of change in a bowl, wallet sitting next to a framed picture of him and Tony after a battle, faces grimy but grinning at the camera, with Steve’s arm thrown affectionately around Tony’s armored shoulders. The Captain America shield is propped up against the side of the dresser, still gleaming proudly from the last time Steve polished it. Tony’s eyes take it all in like a drowning man before he manages to pull them away, away from the sight of how
Steve looks mildly insulted, though still a bit contrite. He reaches out as if to touch Tony’s wrist, then lets his arm drop with a sigh.
Tony is still looking at Bruce, and doesn’t miss it when his eyes go from fearful brown to flashing green, full of rage and hatred. Bruce starts panting, body shaking, and Tony crosses the space between them carefully, grabbing Bruce gently by the hand and pulling him toward the private elevator.
Steve thinks about it, but there’s only ever been one answer since Iron Man flew that nuke into outer space.
Tony doesn't answer. Just closes the distance between them and grasps the sides of his face with both hands, pulling him down into a kiss.
He huffs. The trials and tribulations of being Tony fucking Stark. Sometimes he misses just being able to kick ass and take names and not worry about kissing fat, white, rich ass the next day. But he’s a co-CEO now, Pepper having decided he should take some more responisibility, and the ass-kissing falls to him now.
“Where did they take him? We need to do something.” Tony starts to stand, and Steve gently but firmly pushes him back into the couch.
Steve gets him. Steve was his friend first, and maybe it helps that they didn’t get along at the beginning because Steve is definitely aware of his shortcomings and his failures so Tony doesn’t have to pretend to be perfect, or to work to please him. He doesn’t require flowers, and if Tony forgets to call back for a day and a half Steve just rolls his eyes and says, “Hi Tony, finally come up for air?” with a smile in his voice.
“Be nice if everyone saw it that way,” Tony grumbles good naturedly, attempting to lighten the mood. He hadn’t meant to upset Steve, had actually thought he’d be on the military’s side, like Rhodey, and he’d already half-prepared an argument for that scenario. But here Steve is, not only on Tony’s side, but genuinely upset for him, as well.
He goes down to the gym to burn off some steam. His thoughts are all over the place, angry and sad and confused and scared. Definitely scared. Fear leaks out with every punch, every kick. He almost lost Tony today. Tony almost died because he wasn’t fast enough, wasn’t smart enough, couldn’t come up with a better plan, was incompetent as a leader. It's like Bucky all over again, and isn't that absolutely terrifying, that Tony is as important to him as Bucky? Tony, the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist he’s known for only a couple of years, who he’s really only gotten to know recently, has squeezed his way into Steve’s heart, right next to his oldest friend. And wouldn't that be the stuff of nightmares, if Steve failed to save him, too.
Tony is agitated now, standing from the couch and throwing his hands in the air as he rants. “I can see it in the way you look at me sometimes, when I do something you don’t like or don’t agree with, your ‘here he goes again’ face, like I never learn.
They sit in comfortable silence until Steve speaks up again. “That isn’t the only reason I came here, though.” Tony grunts in acknowledgement, not sure he really wants to hear what other reason Steve’s got for coming down to the city. He has a feeling he knows what it is.
Steve takes it. Lets Tony pull him up and then down the stairs, across the club and to the dance floor, lit up by flashing lights and crammed with hot, sweaty bodies.
There are so many of them, and Tony takes out several as he watches his team work below him. Thor is smashing through them with his hammer but they've begun keeping their distance from him, attacking from behind and darting away, and he can't use his long-distance lightning attack. Natasha and Clint are confined to their roof, and Tony is doing his best to keep them from being swarmed. Steve is cleaving through robots one after the other, but Tony doesn't know how long he can hold out. Hulk seems to be holding up alright, but the bots are doing their best to draw him away from the main battle and the team can't afford to lose another heavy hitter right now.
"Sir, Captain Anderson has confirmed the flight for 6 AM tomorrow morning. Mr. Hogan will be waiting to take you to the airstrip at 5:30."
At least, that’s what Steve likes to think they did. He remembers kissing Tony’s skin, drinking in the sight of him, the epiphany of realizing that this man is all he’s wanted since he woke up in this century. It had been buried beneath overwhelming grief, simmering anger, misplaced duty. The admiration, though, the affection… That’s always been there.
It’s like nothing he’s ever experienced before, so sweet he aches with it. It’s slow and searching, lips sliding against each other, communicating in a way that spoken words can never seem to articulate. Tony’s tongue touches his bottom lip, asking permission, and Steve’s stomach jumps, lips parting unhesitatingly. Tony’s hands have found their way to his shoulders, are running across his back and neck soothingly, and Steve just wants to stay here forever, lost in this wonderful, complicated man.
“Mm. Virginia Is For Lovers,” Tony says, obviously quoting something, voice dropping into a low rumble. Steve shivers slightly.
In lieu of answering, Tony reaches an arm out to the side, knocking things blindly off the bedside table before he manages to fumble the drawer open. He finds the lube and a condom and presses them into Steve’s hand, says breathlessly, “I want you inside me.” He feels Steve’s cock twitch and smirks, and Steve bends down to bite his collarbone in reprimand. Tony yelps and smacks his arm, but Steve just chuckles and kisses the reddened spot tenderly.
Steve grunts, face relaxing the tiniest bit. “You don’t still… Want her, though, right? You don’t still love her?”
“Oh, okay,” Tony says intelligently. He doesn’t know how to feel about this. On one hand, he’s glad Steve may possibly get his friend back, but on the other, it’s Bucky fucking Barnes, and there’s no way Tony can compare to the legend of Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.
Rhodey nods and asks when they can visit her. The doctor tells them he’ll send a nurse out to get them as soon as Pepper’s settled. He thanks the doctor, who nods back before disappearing back into the ICU. Tony reaches up and grabs the hand Rhodey’s still got clamped to his bicep and Rhodey turns his hand, grips onto Tony’s fingers tightly. They stand like that until a nurse comes out to get them a quarter of an hour later.
Things are good, right up until Tony says something stupid, again. A stupid comment about SI and the money-hungry board members and how Tony’d like to know if they’d ever done an honest day’s work in their lives, and Steve snaps about how Tony used to be one of those guys.
Steve sighs in defeat but his shoulders relax marginally. Tony smiles at him, pleased. Then he brightens considerably, a playful grin stretching across his face.
“I love you, too,” Tony says quietly. Steve stops for a moment, breath hitching painfully, and nods. And then he’s gone.
There are no doctors in the main treatment area, so Tony just pushes Steve toward a cot and points imperiously at it. Steve grins and sits obediently, swinging his legs, and Tony wheels over a tray with gauze and other first aid supplies. He pulls up a rolling chair and reaches for Steve's other hand, gently unwinding the wrap, mumbling beneath his breath about stupid super soldiers and their lack of self preservation and just because he heals at an accelerated rate doesn't mean he should pound his hands into mince meat. Steve bites his tongue at the "lack of self preservation" comment, not wanting to snap and break the truce they seem to have reached, but it's a struggle.
“Better,” Steve says. There’s a sigh, like a weight has been lifted from his chest. “A lot better, Tony. How are you doing? Really?”
Steve stops him. “No, no, everything’s fine. I just wanted to thank you again for all your help, and see if you were hungry, maybe.”
Tony takes them to the left, up a small set of stairs to a raised corner area on the ground floor that is roped off from the rest. Of course, even when he doesn’t want to be recognized, Tony gets them VIP access, Steve thinks.
The blue light makes Steve’s eyes glow an unearthly color as he caresses his free hand over the glass face, and Tony has to fight not to tense up, it hasn’t been all that long since Obie, after all. He thinks that if he’s managed to judge Steve that wrongly he probably deserves to have the thing yanked out of him anyway. He doesn’t think he’s wrong this time, though.
“Pupils are reactive, no lasting effects from the concussion,” the doctor states to a nurse, who nods and takes notes. He turns back to Tony. “Do you have any pain? A headache, nausea?”
The waitress finally takes their order and heads back to the kitchen and Tony pulls out his cellphone. He’s got three missed calls from Pepper and two texts informing him that he had better be at the first shareholder’s meeting of the year tomorrow morning or she’s quitting. Tony snorts at that, she’d never leave him, not with all the shoes he buys her, and shoots off a quick, smart-ass reply saying he’ll be there, no promises on what state he’ll be in, it’s New Year’s after all. Then he puts the phone on the table in front of him with a flourish.
“You can’t just— Tony, I hit you! I could have seriously hurt you. It’s not as simple as ‘apology accepted’, here,” he’s saying. He’s getting worked up, Tony can tell. The color is rising to his face and his hands are no longer in his pockets, but clenched at his sides.
Tony’s dark eyelashes fan against his cheeks, his cheekbones sharp in the shadows. His lips curl up at the corners and Steve suddenly wonders what they feel like, how they taste, how they would move underneath his own.
“Um, hi,” Steve says. He looks great, healthy, and Tony never thought he looked unhealthy but he must have been because now Steve’s face is smooth and free of worry lines, and Tony wonders how he never noticed the stress Steve was under when they were together.
In the end it’s hardly a decision at all. Pepper would have hated being an invalid, would have hated having no dignity. Tony keeps telling himself that it’s not Pepper in there, in that body, that it’s just a shell of someone who used to be Pepper, that Pepper’s already dead and gone. It doesn’t make him feel any better.
Tony doesn’t say a damn thing. Doesn’t think he’s ever been so quiet in his life. Doesn’t think he could speak if he tried, to be honest.
“Sorry,” Tony says, thinking maybe Steve does mind after all. “Dumping all my shit on you like that. That’s what my $400 an hour psychiatrist is for.” He laughs ruefully.
Tony's doesn't think he's forgiven, exactly, but he also thinks he's mostly safe from losing any important body parts in the near future.
Tony tsks reprovingly before he pushes his goggles over his eyes and gets back to work, Iron Man parts spread on the workbench in front of him. Bruce just keeps smiling and gets back to his own work, something DNA-related with swirling strands of letters and numbers winking in and out of existence at Bruce’s whim on the other side of the room.
It’s a while before either of them speaks again. Tony fiddles with his drink. Steve checks his phone. He’s missed a text.
Tony orders himself an Americano and drops a fifty in the tip jar when the guy goes to start making it. He turns around to lean back against the counter to survey the rest of the shop There’s a dark-haired couple with their heads bent together on a loveseat over in one corner of the room. They’re giggling over something the guy is showing his girlfriend on his smartphone. A middle-aged artsy-looking fellow is sitting by the single window that showcases the street Tony’s just come in from, working on his Apple computer and sipping something drowning in whipped cream and drizzled with caramel, and Tony almost changes his order because that looks downright delectable. He decides against it. He needs something a little stronger, a little more coffee and a little less flavored syrup tonight.
“Sir slept for approximately 54 minutes yesterday evening, following 18 hours of working in the lab.” He pauses, then states, “My apologies, sir, but you’ve passed the deadline Miss Potts has established for me to report your sleeping habits to the Nearest Responsible Adult.” The last part of that statement has the air of a direct quote about it, and Tony huffs a sigh through his nose and throws his hands up in surrender, looking up at the ceiling.
Tony’s eyes fill with tears again. Steve’s big hand is rubbing soothing circles on his back while he struggles to gain control of himself and his emotions.
He attempts a rueful smirk, but he can feel it fall flat. He’s got no defense mechanisms here, no snark to protect him, because every reason he thought he had for doing what he did is useless, he doesn’t have an excuse. He was wrong, so very wrong.
Steve wants to say something, wants to say that’s not true, that every death meant something to him, that they were all remembered, are
They step inside and Steve pushes Tony up against the back wall. Tony’s head falls back with a thump as Steve attacks his neck, holding him up with one hand (one hand, oh my god) while Steve unbuttons his shirt with the other. His kisses move down, over Tony’s chest, as far as he can go while still holding Tony up. He laves over the scars where the arc reactor used to be with his tongue and Tony really doesn’t even know if he’s going to make it to the bed at all at this rate. He’s panting by the time the elevator doors open to the penthouse, FRIDAY chiming tactfully to let them know they’ve arrived. Steve adjusts his grip and turns them around, carrying Tony through the penthouse and into Tony’s bedroom. He kneels on the bed, crawling up it on his knees before he gently lets Tony down into the soft pillows at the top, kissing him breathless.
He eventually finds the strength to stand up, dry himself off and change into a ratty t-shirt and pajama pants. He climbs into his oversized bed, clenching his eyes shut against the emptiness on the other side, and tries unsuccessfully to think about schematics and designs instead of his boyfriend kissing another man.
Tony jumps when Steve’s hand slams onto the coffee table. He looks up to see Steve’s face flushed, muscles in his jaw clenching. “Stop with the pity party, Tony. It happened. You helped fix it and it’s over now. Yes, people died, but they died helping save the world and they knew the risks going into it. You need to learn to let it go.”
“No, listen, Steve, I— Me, too. Me too. I’ve loved you for— for a long time, I think.” Tony feels like an idiot, feels his face flushing, pushes deeper into the space between Steve’s shoulder and neck, but Steve’s not having it. He pulls Tony out and his face is so happy, Tony must have said something right because Steve’s smile is brilliant and Tony can feel his mouth starting to turn up at the edges, too.
Steve’s face falls as he catches Tony’s reaction, jaw clenching unhappily. “Why not?” he asks. He sits up, turning on the couch to face Tony. “I don’t mind traveling to come and see you, but it would be nice if you came to visit me, too. Plus,” he adds thoughtfully, “I think everyone would be real happy to see you again.”
He tries to pull himself toward that awareness, but the tide of darkness is pulling him in the other direction, away from his physical body, back into the sightlessness and heavy silence of his mind. He’s afraid of his mind, scared of drowning in such a dark, lonely place, but he’s powerless to resist, and it wraps around him lovingly and buries him back into nothing.
Steve repeats himself. “We were sent out on an Avengers mission. They hacked into JARVIS, had him tell us Bruce was gone and you were indisposed. So we left.”
His finger hovers over the reply button for a few seconds before pressing it firmly, and he types out a quick response.
“Shh,” he whispers. Steve’s eyes flutter closed and he tilts forward to lean his forehead against Tony’s. They are still swaying just the tiniest bit, no sound but their snuffling breaths, and it’s like a sad, sweet dance.
Pepper’s in town for some meeting or other (Tony should probably know which meeting, he may even be required to be there, he’s the worst, but he can't bring himself to care). She comes down one morning with a stack of papers to sign and Tony is so used to Steve letting himself in that he doesn’t rush to stop working on the HUD of the new Iron Man helmet.
“Sorry,” he mumbles. “I just know how much you wanted to be with her, and I don’t like the idea of you with anyone else.”
His head is turned to the side and he feels warm liquid dribble out the side of his mouth. He coughs, and it’s excruciating. The copper taste is stronger than ever, and he realizes it’s blood.
“Anyway,” Steve says, sounding tired now. “I just wanted to let you know that I’m sorry, and I’m working on it, and that you deserve so much better than I gave you.”
There’s a burst of warm, coffee-scented air when he steps inside and he breathes it in deep, his body shivering joyously. The aroma wafting from behind the counter is phenomenal. The cafe is cute, little stuffed armchairs and larger couches surround low coffee tables. The walls are painted a warm brownish-red, hung with paintings of mugs of tea and overflowing bags of coffee beans. There’s even a quilt nailed to one wall, which makes him think of a grandmother’s house, comforting and warm and some place a person can go to just relax and put all their problems on hold and hide from the world. Not
“So I take it he’s on our side now?” Clint asks over the comms, talking about Bucky. “Since he just kind of scarily dismembered a Doombot that was trying to shoot me, you know, I thought I’d ask.”
Tony immediately shakes the thought out of his head, letting his hands drop back into his lap. Steve’s right. It’s not the time, especially for Tony. Maybe, if it wasn’t for all the trouble with SI, if he wasn’t dying from palladium poisoning. But there is trouble, and he is dying. It was good, it was perfect, and hopefully it’s enough to get him through whatever comes next.
It feels like the bullet hits Tony. He blacks out for a second, but then he’s back, gasping for air, tears streaming down his face, still flying in the suit. His vision is swimming and he isn’t sure he’s actually breathing at all but he has to get to Jamie. He has to. He’s approaching the Tower, a hundred yards, fifty.
“Yes, Mr. Stark, sounds about right,” he sighs. He glances at the couch behind him. “Mind if I take a seat?”
Over the team comm, he hears shots, then Natasha’s voice, “Hydra agents eliminated. Hostages secure.”
“Tony had a protein bar at 7am this morning but hasn’t eaten anything since, Steve,” she says, sounding entirely too pleased with getting Tony in trouble. Why do all of his AIs get pleasure out of tattling on him to Steve? JARVIS had done it, too, during that short stint they’d all lived in the Tower together.
, I was like Rapunzel except with less golden blonde hair and more super cool tech gadgets. Am I right, JARVIS? Tell the kid.”
He’s contemplating what exactly Asgardian liquor is made of when he sees Tony approaching with his new friend and what’s most likely her wing-man. The woman in red is pretty, prettier than Steve expected, which makes him feel like a bit of a punk, judging someone before he’s even met them. Tony holds up the velvet rope that separates their area from the rest of the club and lets them both duck underneath before following.
He looks up when the door swishes open and he freezes, hands stilling on the red and gold faceplate.
"So I'm getting the feeling you're all mad at me," he says lightly, looking directly at Natasha. He's feeling brave at the moment, after being hand-fed chicken broth, and he'll probably pay for it later but he wants them to know he did the right thing and he'd do it again.
One of Tony’s hands slides down to cup his cheek, then moves further, fingernails catching lightly on his stubble, making him shiver. His fingertips come to rest on Steve’s bottom lip, pulling gently until his mouth is open the tiniest bit. Tony’s eyes are locked on Steve’s, and he must find what he’s looking for because the next moment his fingers are falling away and he’s pushing up on his tiptoes and pressing his lips to Steve’s.
It's a tight squeeze, but they all manage to fit, Pepper and Natasha sitting on the end of the bed, Bruce looking at his medical chart (he wonders how many times he's done that while Tony's been out), Thor standing by the head of his bed smiling brilliantly, Clint plopped in the single chair by his bedside, Steve and Rhodey standing near the back wall, by the lone window letting in weak rays of light.
It’s starting to make sense now. They sent the team out of the tower, but kept Tony around to lull Bruce into a false sense of security. Only two Avengers to fight, instead of six, and one couldn’t afford to turn green without hurting the other.
Steve kisses him as Tony’s body adjusts to the intrusion, tongues sliding together, and then he starts rocking gently and sparks light up all along Tony’s body, nerve endings firing off jolts of pleasure as he moves. Tony moans and spreads his legs wider as Steve starts to thrust harder, with purpose.
It’s a perfectly innocent, perfectly fair question, but Tony’s already shaking his head. He can’t. He doesn’t want to go there. That’s where the Avengers are, the people he’d put in danger. The team he’d let down. He’ll fix their equipment and build them new and improved weapons and even help fund the new HQ, but he’s not part of that group anymore, he’s not a hero. After everything he did, he can’t imagine they’d want to see him anyway. He doesn’t know why Steve wants to see him, but Steve was always the best of them, always so good and so kind, always forgiving Tony for things he doesn’t deserve forgiveness for.
Instead he just bows his head, blinking back tears, grateful that he has this, at least. That his best friend is still in there, and remembers him, and seems to be willing to come back home with him.
“Nah,” he says, and leaves it at that. After a minute Tony throws back the rest of his drink and stands, fishing a bill out of his wallet that’s more than enough to cover the both of their tabs and slapping it onto the counter.
And what’s surprising is that he means it. They don’t have to sleep together. It would be nice, more than nice, spectacular, he’s willing to bet, but it’s not necessary. Tony likes Steve, likes talking to him and joking with him and learning all about him, and if all they did was chat Tony would be happy just to bask in that. He’s missed real companionship.
At least Steve seems to be on the same page, which helps keep some of Tony’s anxiety about the situation at bay. He catches Steve staring at him often, smiling softly. When they’re down in the lab together to work on something or other for the team or for SI, Steve sketches, and though he’s never shown Tony what he draws, Tony’s got FRIDAY, and he’s seen that it’s mostly him covering the pages of Steve’s sketchbooks. Drawings of his hands, his eyes, his mouth, sometimes the Iron Man suit and the arc reactor, but mostly of Tony as he is now, laughing at one of Steve’s jokes, arguing pointlessly with Dummy, working on one of Natasha’s Widow’s bites with his tongue poking out from between his teeth.
Tony wakes up to a bed as empty as his heart. He stares at the ceiling, feeling that familiar ache in his chest, except this time it’s not from the arc reactor.
Tony shoots him a patented Stark grin and saunters over to the wall-length bar opposite the recessed area Rogers is standing in. “Want something to drink? Oh, right, super serum. Can’t get drunk. But you can still enjoy it, can’t you?” Tony busies himself making a drink. A strong one. There’s something about the other man that sets him on edge, makes him jittery.
Tony groans again, and Steve looks down to see his head flop sideways, almost bumping into Steve's knee.
Tony blinks uncomprehendingly. “What?” he asks. That makes no sense. Tony and Bruce were in the lab all morning. JARVIS wouldn’t lie.
“That’s it? I don’t know when I’ll be back and I get a ‘Stay safe, see you soon’?” Steve is incredulous. Tony doesn’t blame him, he’s being a dick, he can’t help it sometimes, it’s in his blood.
They kiss some more, hot and needy, until Steve’s grinding his hips relentlessly into Tony’s, making little high pitched noises in the back of his throat with each thrust. Tony’s pretty sure Steve’s completely unaware he’s making them at all, which just makes it even more sexy. It crosses his mind that they should probably move this if they don’t intend to end up in a puddle on the hallway floor.
“Well, goodie for you, while I sat here and imagined all of the wonderful things your silence could mean, thanks for that. You didn't even tell me you were still
By the time Luke tells Leia that they’re actually brother and sister and Darth Vader is their father, Steve and Tony have somehow migrated closer on the couch, thighs just barely touching, with Steve’s arm thrown over the back behind Tony’s head. Tony keeps poking Steve in the side, telling him to pay attention, this part is important, you’re gonna miss it, because Steve keeps looking at him like he’s got something to say, and Tony’s not sure what’s got him so tangled up in knots but doesn’t know if he really wants to hear it. If it’s another plea to rejoin the Avengers Tony might just get up and storm out to make a point, and he’s having a good time right now and doesn’t want it to come to that, not tonight.
“Tony, I hurt you. I needed time to think. I’m sorry it took me so long, but I needed to be away from you for a little bit—“
grandmother, of course. He never knew his father’s mother, Howard was already well past his prime by the time Tony was born, and his maternal grandmother was a little old Italian woman who spoke no English and kept crosses on every wall of her tiny New York apartment. Tony shudders a little at the memory. She terrified him, honestly.
Steve’s followed him and stands on the other side of the countertop, and when Tony glances up he’s staring at Tony, face closed off.
By the time 6 o’clock rolls around, he’s a mess. He’s gone from convincing himself Steve’s breaking up with him, to ordering takeout and queuing up a movie, to canceling the food order and pouring himself a drink to calm his nerves.
“Steve,” he pants, when Steve breaks off to mouth at his neck once again, and his voice comes out hoarse and deep, and Steve groans. Tony’s stomach does a little flop at the sound and he closes his eyes to regain his composure.
“Cap, buddy, pal. I don’t know how much easier I can make this for you,” he hears Tony say next to him. Steve pulls himself up from his lounging position, shirt stretching across his chest as he leans forward and rests his forearms on his knees. His head sags a bit, and he must be a little drunker than he thought, but it’s a good feeling, he likes it. He looks up at Tony.
Steve watches as another explosion rocks the foundations of the Malibu mansion. Around him is silence, just him and a ramshackle hotel room in the middle of nowhere. Steve is glued to the small television with crappy reception showing the live feed from California, displaying views of fire and crumbling masonry.
“Tony, maybe you should sleep it off,” he says kindly, squeezing the other man’s shoulders slightly.
Bouncing from foot to foot, he jiggles Jamie on his hip while he rambles on about repulsors and thrust and other awesome scientific things that he secretly hopes is seeping into the kid’s brain in some type of osmosis or exposure-related learning or something. Hearing his own voice (and the occasional nonsensical babble from the baby on his hip) isn’t quite as conducive to random bursts of genius as ear-bleeding levels of classic rock music, but Steve had made it abundantly clear that if Tony didn’t put on something more soothing at a much lower volume, Jamie wasn’t allowed in the lab at all. So Tony capitulated, and now there’s classical music floating through the air, which definitely isn’t Aerosmith, but is better than the 40’s and 50’s stuff Steve likes, and Tony would never be caught dead listening to Today’s Top 40. (Though some of that Taylor Swift stuff that Steve likes is pretty catchy, he’s not gonna lie.)
Steve hesitates, then nods. They strip the core of the armor off, Steve's heart dropping as he throws pieces away from them. They're dented and parts are almost shredded, sharp pieces covered in blood from where they've pierced Tony's skin. He strips off his costume and his undershirt, tearing the shirt to pieces, pressing them to the worst of the wounds in Tony's abdomen and chest.
Before the serum, being unable to catch his breath was a common, if unwelcome, occurrence. The winter air would freeze his lungs, razor claws digging into his throat, and he'd cough so frequently there was no time to catch his breath in between. Dust from the ancient living room rug that the previous tenants had left behind in his and Bucky’s tiny one-bedroom apartment suffocated him. Sometimes the four flights of stairs up to the front door was enough to leave him gasping.
“Shirt stays on,” Tony whispers, and it’s another little punch to the gut, another little facet of how damaged Tony is, how much of it Steve overlooked, how much of it Steve
He hadn’t wanted to come tonight, hadn’t felt up for the dancing monkey act, but the Gala was for the Maria Stark Foundation, and he may have changed everything SI stands for in the last few months but the Maria Stark Foundation was one thing he didn’t touch. Also, it’s one of the main reasons he’s here in New York to begin with.
“Fuck! Steve! STEVE!” Tony is screaming into the comms. He’ll be at the Tower in 20 seconds, but it’s too long, he needs to be there now. Where is Steve? What happened? “JARVIS!”
“I love you,” Steve continues. “But he’s—“ he breaks off, struggles to find the words. “It’s hard to explain. I’ve loved him since I was a kid, and then I lost him, and I—“ Steve closes his eyes against the pain that must be visible on Tony’s face. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I can’t lose him again.”
“It’s the whole All-American apple pie look you’ve got going on. Very wholesome. The plaid and khaki doesn’t help, either. It’s like cursing in front of your grandpa.”
The doctors list their probabilities and prognoses and none of it makes Tony feel any better. They’re gathered around the bed, one doctor, one nurse, Tony, and Rhodey. Steve is waiting outside. He told Tony that he thinks this is something personal, something between the three of them that he shouldn't necessarily be part of, but that he’ll be waiting for Tony right outside the door. Tony grabs Rhodey’s hand again, while the nurse unplugs the breathing machine from the wall. They watch as Pepper breathes in a few times on her own, watches as her breaths become shorter, more labored. She never opens her eyes, never panics and signals that she’s suffocating, choking, dying. She just breathes less and less, until her chest doesn’t rise again, and there’s a long beeping from the heart rate monitor, and then the nurse reaches over to shut that off, too.
Steve’s eyes flash but Tony see’s Sam’s hand squeeze his shoulder in warning. Steve lets out a frustrated sigh. “No, it’s not Bucky, I told you it wasn’t like that.”
He has a moment of panic, stomach flipping uncomfortably, before he remembers the Photostatic Veil he borrowed from Natasha. A quick glance in the mirror behind the bar verifies his disguise is still in place. Shaggy brown hair in need of a cut, dark eyes, sharp nose, thinner jaw than his own. He’s nearly the opposite of his natural looks, still handsome but much less distinct. His voice is a little higher. He’s dressed differently as well; Instead of his usual tight t-shirt and dark working pants, he’s got on a burgundy sweater over a button down, slacks, and oxfords. He’s supposed to be a banker. He feels like he looks the part.
“No, Steve. YOU’RE not listening. You want to preach about working together and team decision making and no secrets? You’re a fucking hypocrite.”
Tony scowls. “You should be. Guy hasn’t slept in days and he passes out on his plane and you maul him in his sleep?” Steve laughs for real this time. “Shame on you, Cap.”
"Good man, J." He turns to Steve, eyes flitting around the room but never resting on Steve himself. "See you bright and early, yeah Cap? Get some shut eye, we can hash everything out on the way."
Tony sets down the welding torch and takes off his face shield; See? He can do the whole Proper Lab Protocol thing, despite what Bruce and Pepper say.
Steve eyes the headline of the American newspaper and tosses it back down onto the table. It’s been over 12 hours since the Mandarin attack in California. There’s been another video feed from the terrorist, and a man has died at the hands of this monster, and no one had been able to do anything about it, and Steve’s about ready to haul his ass home just to show them how to get something done.
Tonight though, tonight he’s had enough of the game. He’s been playing it all his life, and brilliant though he may be at it, it tests his patience sometimes. Especially now, after everything, he sees these skeevy, conniving businessmen with their bought dates and it reminds him too much of the fact that that was him, less than a year ago, drinking with people he detests, laughing at jokes that aren’t funny, all in the name of a couple million.
His eyes are red-rimmed, and Tony’s heart hurts to know that he’s been crying, but then a flash of anger streaks through him. What right does Steve have to cry? Tony’s about to open his mouth and say so when Steve speaks.
The nurse smiles gently. “Six weeks, Mr. Stark.” Her voice is soft, as if afraid of spooking him. She raises the cup slightly, wordlessly asking if he’s finished, and he nods. Six weeks, he’s been asleep. In a coma. And his friends, his teammates, have been visiting him for those six weeks, and he knows them, knows their names, but he can’t remember knowing them at all. He wonders if he’ll ever remember.
“Tony? Can you hear me?” He feels something squeeze his right hand. He squeezes back, and it hurts, but it’s worth it to hear Steve’s choked laugh.
She grins. “Great, actually. Some of us are going out for drinks in about half an hour, would you maybe want to join us? Just a group of friends, nothing special, no hidden agendas,” she adds hurriedly, when Steve opens his mouth to decline.
Steve tells him he’ll be back next Friday with Sam’s flight suit and Tony tells him he’ll work on everyone’s uniforms and accessories and weapons regardless, and that Steve doesn’t need a reason to keep coming back. Steve smiles shyly, face flushing with pleasure, before they lose another hour or two in each other.
Several armed thugs come hurrying into the room, guns at the ready. Tony and Yinsen have their arms already up, hands linked behind their heads. The men are laughing and smiling, and Tony’s heart sinks as he realizes that whatever the explosions had been earlier, they must have worked out in the Ten Ring’s favor.
“Tony, I came to apologize,” he says earnestly. He’s got the puppy dog eyes going, but Tony’s not falling for it this time.
After the serum, he had more control over his breathing, and the moments that were capable of stealing his breath then were all are the more memorable for it. Seeing Red Skull’s face for the first time, the darkest parts of human nature brought to life, and feeling horrified at what the serum running through his veins could turn a different soul into. When Bucky fell from the train, reaching for Steve, reaching and screaming and always reaching. Peggy’s tearful voice when Steve plummeted into the North Atlantic.
“Fuck.” Tony’s heart stops, then starts beating again at a pace that surely isn’t healthy. He fires the thrusters at full power, orders the Avengers back to the Tower in the same breath. It was a distraction, it was all to get to Steve. There’s a chorus of Affirmatives.
The call cuts off when FRIDAY picks up on his cut-throat motion. His whole body is trembling, but it’s nothing a drink can’t fix.
They play in companionable silence. Time passes slowly here, in this godforsaken cave in the middle of nowhere. Tony doesn’t know how long he’s been here, a prisoner to a terrorist faction, but he knows Yinsen has been here longer, taken from his family in Gulmira, and he must be dying to get back to them. Tony doesn’t have family, just Pepper and Rhodey and JARVIS, and maybe that says something about his life that his top three most important people are his P.A., the military liaison for Stark Industries, and an AI he created.
"You really think that? That I would-- I would trade you for him? That I'm going to give you up now that he's back?"
“Not you, too, Cap. I hear it enough from Pepper.” He grabs two Dr. Peppers and closes the door, turning back toward Steve and food.
Steve wants to help, but he knows there’s nothing he can do that isn’t already being done. The agents in California will find what there is to be found, and if he’s needed, Natasha knows how to reach him.
Just then a doctor comes out from the double doors in front of them, pulling his mask down under his chin. They turn to him, Rhodey squeezing Tony’s arm sharply, a nonverbal command to keep his mouth shut. Tony wants to glare at him but can’t look away from the doctor’s face.
“Yes, but now you’re drinking alone. I feel like that’s a little different, don’t you?” Steve asks pointedly.
“Whatever you say, Soldier,” Tony drawls. Steve gives him a look that has Tony snickering under his breath.
“I…” he starts, trailing off. How exactly does someone say something like this? He tries again. “I don’t, uh… I don’t actually remember. Falling.”
“What, Capricorn, I can’t have a drink when I want to?” he asks angrily, hand not holding the bottle flying through the air and almost smacking Steve in the side of the head.
Tony groans when Steve shoots him a disapproving look. “Look, I had a meeting until 2 and then I came straight here and I’ve been working ever since, don’t give me that look, Steve, I got caught up. Plus, I knew you were coming and you come bearing gifts.” He smiles sweetly but Steve doesn’t buy it.
Bucky takes charge, which surprises Steve, but doesn't, really, because that's always been Bucky, having his back when he stumbles. Maybe he's slightly more dangerous, and a little (a lot) more jaded, but he's still Bucky, Steve refuses to believe otherwise.
Steve reaches up with a stupidly long leg and kicks him in the shin. Tony kicks back, misses, throws a pillow at the other man’s head instead. Steve laughs and bats it away with a lazy hand.
He doesn't say anything, but Steve can feel his stare. He sighs, drops his hands between his knees, wraps hanging half-undone. He drops his chin to his chest and sighs again.
Steve’s mouth twitches up at the corners. “I don’t know, Tony. Maybe it’s always been there, this side of you. Maybe you just realized it’s okay to be someone you can be proud of.”
Suddenly uncomfortable from the praise, Tony laughs it off. “You wouldn’t be saying such nice things if you knew me before all that.”
The barista looks regretful when he answers. “We do, but we let people leave with them after 9, to clear it out for tomorrow. If it’s not there there’s probably no copies left. Sorry,” he says apologetically, and Tony waves him off.
The way Steve kisses makes Tony practically melt into the floor. It’s pleasant and soothing, full of heat and searching. It makes Tony feel exposed, vulnerable, in ways that with someone else might make him uncomfortable. But he feels safe with Steve, protected, almost, and he lets the other man explore his mouth thoroughly.
And then Bruce is there, clothes torn and ragged, and Bucky's explaining the situation to him, and he's leaning over Tony and talking to him in a calm voice, and Steve is so grateful he can't even think. Natasha is leaning over to speak to Bruce, telling him there's a chopper on the way, and she glances quickly at Bucky. Steve doesn't know if Bucky will run or if he meant it when he said he was done, but he can't think about that right now. He turns back to Tony, telling him to stay awake, and then Tony's struggling to breathe.
Steve squeezes his hand then pulls away to rub his hands over his face, sitting heavily in the chair. He looks exhausted, rings under his eyes and hair a mess, and Tony knows super-soldiers don't need a ton of sleep but he wonders if Steve has slept at all since he got hurt. He looks so young and vulnerable, and Tony hates himself a little bit more for putting him through this. The man has enough issues as it is, he's lost everyone he'd ever cared about, and he almost lost Tony on top of that.
"Tony, listen to me. I love you." Tony opens his mouth to object, but Steve doesn't let him. "No, listen. I love you. Bucky is my best friend. Always has been and always will be and nothing will change that, but I don't love him the way I love you. Tony Stark, Iron Man, the guy who drinks coffee like its water, who lets me sit on his couch and sketch all day while he works on amazing, world-changing things, who sees me as more than just Captain America, who isn't afraid to stand up for what he thinks is right. I love you, and nothing's going to change that either."
Sometimes he feels like he burned a bridge with Tony, that maybe he pushed it just a little too far with some of the things he said. After all, there was no scepter to blame his words on this time, no shell-shock from having just been pulled out of the ice and shoved into a battle situation with little warning. But Tony’s always brushed it off, acted like his retirement from the team was something he’d been planning on doing anyway, and that he and Steve are fine.
“Hey!” he shouts, voice hoarse from disuse. He sits up and attempts to grab the sheets but Bucky stops him, pushes him back to the head of the bed with his metal hand. Tony glares, his temper rising quick and vicious within him. It’s like he’s thawing, a hot shower after a day in the snow, little sparks tingling all over his weary body as it stirs awake again. The anger is refreshing, a break from all of the despair and hopelessness of the last few days.
“Honey bunches of oats, I’ve missed you so!” Tony’s squeezing tightly as Rhodey lifts him off the ground, laughing.
Tony doesn't know what to think about that, doesn't really care. Just says, “Huh,” then pulls Steve down by the back of his neck to mash their mouths back together.
“Wanna get out of here, Steve from Virginia?” he asks, and he holds his hand out like he’s asking Steve for a dance.
“You’re ridiculous, Tony,” Bruce says, smiling. There’s a twinkle in his eye that Tony loves to see. Bruce needs a little lightness in his life, he’s always so serious and everyone tiptoes around him but he’s really just a big teddy bear, a teddy bear with a big green alter-ego, and Tony’s happy to spend some time decompressing with him, doing Science Things.
“Happy New Year,” he says, and then he’s losing it at the look of dawning comprehension on Steve’s face. Steve blushes, then he groans.
It floods back suddenly and he flops his head back down onto the pillow perhaps more enthusiastically than he should. He hisses in a breath as his head aches and a sharp pain flashes through his abdomen. After it passes, he pushes himself up carefully to survey the damage.
“No, no, Tony, I’m not— doing that. I’m sorry, I just wanted to explain things to you a little better, try to make you understand… I never wanted to hurt you. Physically or emotionally, and I did both. I’ve never really been in a relationship like that, and it got really intense for me really fast, and I— I did a lot of things wrong. And there’s this, this darkness, in me. I’m only just seeing it for what it is, like that time when I attacked you in the lab, when you were creating Vision? That wasn’t okay, but you just shrugged it off, and I let you.” Tony hears him take a deep breath. “But I can’t let you this time. I hit you, I
It’s around 3:30 in the morning when Steve gets up to stretch his legs and use the bathroom. His face is itching from wearing the Photostatic Veil for such an extended period of time, so he splashes some cool water on it. He can’t risk removing the disguise, not while he’s so close to Tony, but the water gives him a little bit of relief, at least.
He’s just now starting to take that to heart. Steve's a stubborn guy, he knows he is, but Bucky has outsmarted him at every turn. Steve’s hardly laid eyes on him since he started searching for him, never even come close to approaching him. The closest he’d gotten was in Hungary at a market, but a bus drove by and by the time it’d passed Bucky’d vanished into thin air. It’s like Bucky was always one step ahead of him, regardless of all the help he’s been getting.
“I miss Papa,” he whispers into Tony’s ear. Tony’s throat closes up and he has to look up at the ceiling and blink a few times before he can reply. He swallows once, twice, then turns to press his face into Jamie’s soft blonde hair. He smells like baby shampoo, and Steve. Tony breathes deep.
“Tony, what happened?” he asks, voice soft. He sounds slightly wary, and almost disappointed. Well, screw him. He doesn’t know anything and Tony doesn’t give a flying fuck what he thinks he knows about him. He doesn’t know anything.
“‘m not that drunk,” Tony slurs, nudging at Steve with a foot when Steve sits on the edge of the bed.
He has a sense that something is different, now, and that’s why he’s aware he’s here. If he could describe it, he would say he’s less unconscious and more sleeping, now, and maybe he can push through the depths and find the surface if he wanted to.
When they part, panting softly, Steve rests his forehead against Tony’s and squeezes his eyes shut. Tony allows it for a minute, then reaches up to hold Steve’s face in his hands, pulling back and placing a tiny kiss on the end of his nose. Steve smiles, and it feels broken, and he feels like he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, why he feels so shattered from just a kiss. He hasn’t felt this open, this vulnerable, since his best friend fell from a train into some god-forsaken crevasse.
“I’ll be back at five o’clock sharp to pick these up, don’t make me have JARVIS lock you out of the lab until you sign them,” she says as she click-clacks back to the elevator, pressing the call button with perfectly manicured fingers.
Granted, Steve’s idea of fun isn’t exactly the same as Tony’s, so maybe he’s right in assuming that Steve doesn’t want in on this particular adventure, but Steve’s still a little miffed at the implication that he’s a grumpy, boring old man. He may have come out of the ice a different person, but that doesn’t mean he’s a complete wet blanket.
“But I want you to give me another chance. Give us another chance. I know we fight, that’s what we do, we’re too different not to, but I want to do it right, I want to, I want to fight right, to get the chance to show you I can fight with you without hurting you. I want to show you that I can be the man you deserve.”
He leans sideways on his stool, shoulder bumping gently into Steve’s. “Cheer up,” he says, slurring slightly. “From what I hear nobody’s locked up anymore.”
“Alright, old timer, you win.” He grabs Steve’s hand and allows himself to be pulled up and almost stumbles. He hasn’t realized how tired he is. Steve steadies him before letting go.
"You won't, Steve," he promises, and he's going to be smarter from now on about life or death decisions because he's not going to give this up easily. It's fucking Captain America, he'd be a fool if he let this slip out of his fingers because he couldn't think twice.
Steve remembers Tony’s eyes shining in the dim light of the bedroom. Remembers the sounds he made as Steve breeched his body, gasping and moaning in pleasure. Remembers the whispered words, “Steve” and “baby” and “please”. Remembers the soft kisses Tony peppered on his chest afterwards, the way he ran his fingers through Steve’s sweaty hair, the way he curled up against him before he fell asleep.
"Yes. Maybe. I don't know, we haven't really talked about it." Steve looks up. "Is that a problem?" He says it almost challengingly, then chastises himself. He's lashing out because he's scared, and he's pretty sure that's the last thing any of them needs right now.
“Stark, I assume,” he drawls. Tony turns to get a good look at him. He’s decked out in the Winter Soldier gear, minus the creepy mouth cage thing he had going on last year. He’s still wearing that black makeup, and in the reflected light of the river his eyes are striking. Almost as blue as Steve’s, but with his complexion and long dark hair, it’s an arresting sight.
“Me? I’m almost 100% sure the kid was giving me the silent treatment this morning because I accidentally left his nappy in his crib. He wouldn’t even babble until I went back up there and got it. I wonder who he learned that one from,” Tony says wryly. At the mention of his nappy, Jamie drops his slobber-covered wrench to the floor and reaches out with grabby hands, clenching and unclenching his little fists and making vaguely “nappy”-sounding grunts. Tony sighs and walks over to the workshop counter. His blue baby blanket is tucked under a gauntlet, and Tony one-handedly yanks it out from underneath, making a pleased noise when the gauntlet doesn’t go toppling to the workshop floor. He wiggles his eyebrows and takes a slight bow to Steve, who rolls his eyes again. The blanked is transferred to Jamie and the noises immediately change from needy to pleased.
Tony finally finds his voice. “Are you calling me just to break up with me again? Because I can do without it, you know.” His voice is tight, he’s sure Steve can hear it.
It’s past midnight when Tony decides he wants to dance. He stands and pulls at Steve’s arm, and Steve laughs and bats him away. “You go! Go have fun. I’ll hold down the fort,” Steve tells him, and Tony throws his hands up exaggeratedly and heads out toward the dance floor, pulling his hat low over his eyes.
There’s a thin crack in the paint on his bedroom wall, just next to the bathroom door. It starts at the doorframe and creeps downward at a diagonal, fading nearly out of existence before it regains it’s pencil-lead thickness, reaching all the way down until it disappears behind the baseboard. Tony wonders when it got there and how, then decides it doesn’t actually matter.
“Then why?” Tony almost wails. He’d be embarrassed if he wasn’t so heartbroken, if he could feel anything at all besides tearing pain in his chest.
in a relationship. Even with Pepper it was always him working to please her, to make sure he didn’t do something wrong, forget a meeting or an anniversary or a birthday or not to call at 4am after a 72-hour engineering binge.
Two of the nurses follow, though one stays behind, checking the computer screen readouts. Tony clears his throat awkwardly.
He signs the papers to pull the plug two days later. Two days of knowing the right thing to do but unable to do it. Two days of sitting at Pepper’s beside, asking for her forgiveness for not being there, for not being better, for not knowing what she would have wanted. He feels like he should know. He feels like he does know. But what if he’s wrong? What if he decides to pull the plug and she would have wanted him to wait, maybe just a week or two to see what happens? What if he pulls it and she could have made a full recovery? Medical miracles happen all the time. Just look at his chest.
"Hammer guy, can you control that lightning enough to shock his heart into beating, but not fry him?" Thor grunts an affirmative, and then Bucky's telling Steve to back up, and blue-white light zaps into Tony's chest with a small rumble of thunder. Steve is immediately on him again, but there's no change, and Bucky tells Thor to do it again. Everyone clears out and there's a repeat flash and Steve rushes back, and there's a pulse this time, faint but there, and Tony's breathing small, wet breaths. There's blood flecking his lips and Steve's heart skips a beat. He's got to have punctured a lung, and this is nothing Steve knows how to fix. Where is Bruce?
They step away from each other and Tony turns back to the bar. "What'll you have? Beer? Scotch? Glass of warm milk?"
Thor takes that moment to step in. "I for one am most happy our comrade has returned to us," he declares loudly, clapping a heavy hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony winces, but it's not too bad. Plus, he needs as many people on his side as he can get. He'll take the pain.
“Hey, hey, I got you,” Tony says breathlessly when they break away from each other. Steve’s panting harshly, and he realizes he’s shaking, tremors racing up and down his body. He closes his eyes and tries to get a hold of himself and Tony chafes up and down his arms. “You’re good, you’re fine, I’ve got you,” he says again, voice soft, and Steve exhales a shaky breath, opening his eyes.
“It’s not up to you to decide how to handle the fallout. We’re a team during the battles, and we should be a team after them.”
Steve steps back quickly, like he’s afraid of Tony, or just afraid of touching him. Tony’s heart breaks a little more and he gasps in pain.
Steve keeps staring and Tony glances at him and suddenly he realizes how close they’ve gotten. Their faces are less than a foot away from each other, and everywhere their legs are touching suddenly feels hot, and Tony can sense Steve’s arm resting along the back of the couch, and if Steve wanted to he could just reach down with his hand and pull Tony in…
Tony throws his hands up in the air. “So now we need a chaperone when we’re together? Great, Steve, that’s wonderful, I’m so excited for this, can’t wait. Are you going to rotate them, a different Avenger every weekend? Or is Wilson here taking on the full responsibility all by his lonesome?” He glances over at Sam, whose face doesn’t show anything but concern. Some of Tony’s anger burns away at the sight and he looks away again quickly.
But Steve missed him. He felt his absence every time he walked into the training room and there was no smart-assed comment to greet him. Felt it when he woke up in the middle of the night, mind churning with memories of ice and trains and Bucky, and he went into the kitchen for a glass of milk and there was no sleep-deprived genius tapping his fingers impatiently while the coffee machine percolated, eyes focused on something far away. He missed Tony’s infuriating chatter on the comms, and he really missed seeing the red and gold soar through the skies overhead, knowing Iron Man has his back.
Yinsen doesn’t look up from the board game, instead humming and making his next move. “Tony Stark, you have always been a little less than sane,” he murmurs, concentrating.
They've been working as an independent team now for about a month, after everyone finally got around to coming to the Tower. Thor still splits his time between New York and wherever Jane happens to be doing her astrophysics thing at the moment, but the assassin twins have moved in completely (or so Tony assumes, he never really saw bags but he runs into them at breakfast more often than not so he guesses they live there now), and Bruce is now a regular companion in either his lab or Bruce's, where they discuss particle physics and biology (Tony hates biology, oh the things he does for his friends) and do science-y things together.
There’s always been an edge to their friendship, his and Tony’s. They co-led the team together well, Tony’s futurism and Steve’s strategic mindset blending together seamlessly. They fought like a unit since day one, when the world was at risk of an alien invasion and they were told to get their shit together or lose. But off the battlefield and away from the team it was different. It’s like they co-existed in the same space but lived in different worlds. Tony was just a little too bitter, and Steve was just a little too judgmental. They never quite got each other on a personal level the way they did when they were suited up.
“It’s funny to me sometimes—and by funny I mean not funny at all—that everyone else seems to have more control over my creations than I do.”
He stands up, vision still a little fuzzy, and steps over to stand in front of Steve, grabbing his free hand in both of his own. He falls to his knees and then the tears really start to flow, because all he can think is that he’s lost him, he’s lost the best thing that’s ever happened to him, there’s nothing he can do to make this right, Steve’s going to leave him.
It takes him a little while to pull himself together, but Bucky is silent and patient and grieves with him, holding tightly to Tony’s hands through it all. When the tears finally die down he gives Bucky’s hands a squeeze and lets go, pushing himself off the floor and disappearing into the bathroom.
It’s a long time before the tears stop, and when they do Tony stays stubbornly where he is, sniffing loudly. He’s somehow ended up sitting on his knees, face tucked tightly against Steve's chest, all but collapsed into the other man. Steve has one arm wrapped firmly around Tony’s middle, and his other hand is carding gently through his hair. He wants to stay here forever, partly because he's ashamed to show his face, but mostly because being enveloped like this, protected from the world, feels amazing.
The waitress drops off their food, greasy cheeseburger sliders and fries for Tony and sketchy-looking steak and eggs with a strawberry milkshake for Steve. They talk through their coronary-inducing but entirely delicious meal, about work and art and politics and Steve’s irrational hatred of the Yankees, and Tony’s relaxed and happy for the first time in a long time. He pauses for a second when he realizes, and Steve notices, freezing with a french fry halfway to his mouth, eyes going from dancing to anxious in a heartbeat.
His throat tightens painfully and his hands clench in the sheets, so that he doesn’t do what he really wants to do and grab Steve and pull him in, crush him to his own body like he can protect the other man from his mistakes. He doesn’t deserve that anymore. He’s not sure if he ever did.
“Steve,” he tries again. Steve makes an affirmative noise against his skin and the vibrations make Tony shiver. “Bed. Let’s— Bed,” he manages to get out. He feels Steve nod, then he’s being kissed again and he forgets why they stopped in the first place.
Steve can’t help it; He grins. His chest is still tight with worry and helpless frustration, but this is Iron Man. This is Tony Stark. How could he forget that? The man is far from helpless, and he’s a giant pain in the ass when he wants to be, Steve should know.
Tony’s face doesn't exactly shut down, but it goes blank, almost. He looks away, around the pub, at the dart board that’s been sitting empty for some time now, into the mirrors at the end of the bar. His gaze stays there, staring at himself, and Steve wonders what he sees.
“Yes,” Steve says, looking at Tony again. Tony heads toward his dresser, thinking about what he’s got on his plate for today, whether he can get away with jeans and a band shirt or if he’s got that shareholder’s meeting Pepper’s been talking about for a week. Is that today? Or tomorrow?
“Sorry,” Steve says, smiling self-deprecatingly, and Tony just grins at him, even if his eyes are still full of something dark and painful.
A nurse reaches to clean the blood, and he flinches away, startled. He doesn’t know her. He doesn’t know himself. Mr. Stark, they said?
His mouth drops open absently as he watches a piano fly out from the ruins and smash directly into one of the helicopters, bringing it down. He wants to laugh, but he's holding his breath and he can’t move, his hands clenched onto the worn coffee table in front of him. He’s staring at the screen so hard his eyes are beginning to itch, and he sees a vague humanoid form running past the smashed floor-to-ceiling windows, followed closely by machine gun fire. Then he sees Iron Man throw something, shoot a repulsor at it, and blow up another helicopter.
Tony is frozen in shock and Steve starts to pull back, and Tony’s brain kicks back into gear and he must look like the most desperate person on the face of the earth when he practically dives forward to capture Steve’s lips with his again, hands flying up to clutch at Steve’s cotton t-shirt, but Steve must not mind too much because he groans and starts kissing Tony back to within an inch of his life. His arm comes around Tony’s body, palming up and down his back before resting on the back of his neck, his head, pulling Tony closer. Tony clambers up onto Steve’s lap, never breaking contact, nipping at Steve’s bottom lip, gasping when Steve breaks away to suck on the sensitive skin of his neck, trailing kisses along his jaw. Steve’s hands are at Tony’s waist now, pulling him down onto his body, and Tony can feel every bit of him, can feel how much Steve wants this, wants him, and his mind short circuits and he whimpers pathetically.
And Tony doesn’t know what hit him. The left side of his face explodes with pain and he almost blacks out, sees bright white and black and spots of red. He’s fallen to his knees, one hand holding his body upright, the other clutching at his cheek. It takes a minute for his vision to start to clear, and he sits back on his heels, panting for breath.
There’s a “Yes, mom,” and then quiet, and Steve’s heart feels at once heavier and lighter than it has since he’s woken up in this strange new world.
“And the world didn’t like it. And when the US government came knocking on my goddamn door, turns out they didn’t like it either, especially when we were based out of their country, on their own land.” Tony sighs explosively. “They wanted an army. An Avengers army to do their bidding. They wanted us to fight for them, they said, and they’d protect us and clean up after us, all the money and deaths and politics, and the rest of the world would have to go through them to get to us. And I said no.” Tony takes a deep swallow of his bourbon. “I said hell no, and I had my company lawyers on the phone the very next day and the only thing we could do to protect us from being used by our own government was to go to the UN. And the Accords happened.” He shrugs, turns away from Steve now.
“Yes,” Steve replies. “I am.” He smiles and some of the knots in Tony’s stomach loosen a little bit. “Just, promise me, if you ever feel that way again, you won’t run off and do something like this before you talk to me. Please, promise me that.”
He’s starting to really feel the December cold, cupping his bare hands in front of his mouth and blowing warm air on them. Across the street, a laughing group of 20-somethings exits a shop marked “The Hideout”, hands wrapped around steaming cups of coffee. Tony calls it fate and redirects, heading for the coffee shop.
“I’m gonna come back early, they can handle the cleanup without me, there weren’t even any explosions this time.” Steve laughs and Tony smiles slightly. It’s crazy, the things he would do just to hear that laugh. He’s such a goner.
“Mr.—Tony. I can’t… I can’t accept this.” He looks overwhelmed. “This is too much. Thank you, but I can’t accept this.” He begins to back toward the elevator.
Steve smiles. "Not really, no," he says. "Guess we've kind of switched roles here." He starts to unwrap his hands and he hears Tony hiss in a surprised breath. He glances up and sees Tony's gaze focused on the hand he just finished unwrapping, knuckles bruised and bloody. Tony reaches out and takes Steve hand gently but firmly in his, examining the wounds and wincing in sympathy.
It’s not long before the elevator doors open and Steve steps out, looking excited as he strides over to Tony.
There is superheroing where they defeat the bad guy and save the innocent bystanders and the team moves together like a well-oiled machine, and then there is superheroing where Tony has to make a decision in a split second of chaos, and he weighs the options and picks the scenario that results in the least amount of death and destruction, and he spends the next quarter of an hour getting chewed out by his “Commanding Officer”, aka Captain Fucking America.
“I never thought I’d get you out here,” he says happily, shooting a mock glare Tony’s way as he lets him back down onto his feet.
Steve is shocked into silence. He’s never heard this before, had never known the US government had been basically threatening them. He remembers Tony saying he was trying to protect them, trying to “stave off something worse”. But this? This is… He doesn’t know what this is. All he knows is he wants to strangle Tony. Wants to shake him, shout at him, ask why he didn’t come to Steve, why he didn’t tell him, they were supposed to be teammates. Friends.
“I’m fine,” he croaks out. It seems he does understand. His voice is gravelly and hoarse from disuse, and he wonders how long he was wandering around in that darkness. Maybe he really was in a coma. Maybe he’s been in a coma for years.
Steve looks unconvinced. “I just know you’ve been trying to cut back, Tony, and if something’s going on that’s making you want to drink more, you know you can talk to me, right?”
There’s one other person in the cafe, a handsome blonde man, late 20s early 30s, wearing, of all things, cargo pants and a long sleeved blue henley that looks about two sizes too small for his expansive (and extremely fit, from what Tony can make out) chest and shoulders. His dark jacket is draped over the back of his plush chair with a gray and blue scarf lying atop it. He’s got a small novel in one hand while he sips what looks like plain coffee with the other, and Tony’s trying to make out the title when the barista calls his name and his order is up.
Steve nods, too choked up to do anything else, and reaches for Tony’s face instead, cupping it gently in his big hands, kissing his lips softly. He doesn’t know how to apologize, knows he can’t right now and doesn’t know if he will ever even get the chance to do so, so he puts everything he’s feeling into the kiss, thumbs stroking across Tony’s cheekbones, fingers tangling in his dark hair. He slides his hand to cup the back of Tony’s head, tongue exploring Tony’s mouth, giving everything he has and taking whatever Tony’s offering in return.
“Fuck you,” Tony snaps, reaching behind him to place his bare hand comfortingly on Bruce’s chest. “Bruce is no monster, and you’re not getting him. Get the fuck out of my tower.”
They’ve been seeing each other for almost two months now, and Steve’s started leaving extra jeans and shirts in Tony’s closet, and there’s a second toothbrush in the bathroom and Tony tries not to think about these things because they make him nervous in the way that everything good he’s ever had has ended badly and he’d be devastated if this did too, so he doesn’t think about them at all.
It ends up being the second one. They have a wonderful weekend, with only a couple of awkward moments, when Steve mentions something about the team and Tony tenses, waiting for the inevitable “Come back” speech, but it never comes. Tony relaxes as Steve just goes on with his story and it’s not long before they move on to more exciting things, things that may or may not include the dining room table and Tony bent over it moaning out Steve’s name repeatedly.
Steve lifts his head from his arms and takes a deep breath, then he gets back to it. It's easy to get lost in the rhythmic thump, thump, thump thump. It's a while before he surfaces to the sound of expensive shoes clicking on the hardwood floor. He sighs heavily, reaching out to still the swinging bag. He's not sure if talking to Tony right now is a great idea, when he's been working out his frustrations about the man for the last few hours.
Tony kicks out petulantly, whining, “Steeeeve.” He climbs half on top of the bigger man, shoving his face into the side of Steve’s neck. He smells like he just got out of the shower, which is most likely the case. Probably already went for a thousand mile run and annihilated a hundred punching bags, then made breakfast for the early risers on the team and showered and climbed back in bed with Tony. All before ten o’clock. Life with Captain America, ladies and gentlemen.
He crawls back up to find Tony’s mouth and Tony can taste himself on Steve’s tongue, which only turns him on more. A needy whine escapes his throat, he wants Steve in him now, and Steve pulls away to put the condom on and slick himself up. Then he’s lining up, cock nudging against Tony’s entrance, and he starts to push slowly inside.
Awareness starts to seep in and he realizes someone is holding him up, hands on his back and shoulders. They’re murmuring to him, but he can’t hear them, can’t hear anything but Jamie’s crying and Steve’s last words, his name, and please, and Tony know’s what he was trying to say, please don’t hurt our son, please.
There’s a small blur of blonde hair and blue eyes and it’s like a punch to the gut, how much he looks like Steve, and Tony wants to turn and run because he can’t do this, he can’t, Steve’s gone, how is he supposed to do this alone? Then he catches Bucky’s eye, and Bucky gives him a little nod, one corner of his mouth tilting up sadly, and Tony swallows back the panic and pastes on a smile that he knows looks forced but hopes will fool a three year old.
Tony lifts one shoulder nonchalantly. “Back to the hotel, probably. I’m not really in the celebratory mood.” He takes a sip of his neglected coffee, sighs with pleasure. “Actually, I kind of ditched my own New Year’s party. One that I’m supposed to be hosting.” Steve’s got a vaguely horrified look on his face and Tony laughs. “I’ve had about enough bullshitting for one night, and don’t they say whatever you’re doing at the start of the year is what you’ll do for the rest of it? Thanks, but no thanks, I’d rather not be stuck kissing corporate ass for the next 365 days.”
He wonders for a moment if this means he’s forgiven. It can’t be a breakup, (he hopes it’s not a breakup,) because Steve wouldn’t be coming over for movie night if that’s the case. Maybe they’ll just avoid the topic completely and pretend it never happened, and they can go back to weekends at the Tower with no complications.
“No,” Steve bites out. His body is coiled tight, like he’s in danger, and Tony should know to back off, he really should. But he never does what’s good for him. He wouldn’t be Tony Stark if he did, would he?
He's screaming Tony's name as he's running, watching the scene unfold down the bombed out street, 50 feet above the ground. He sees the armor jolt, electricity running down the limbs and causing sparks to fly at the joints. Sees the other Doombots closing in on their position. He's still a block away when Thor flies by and enters the fray, Mjolnir taking out opponents left and right. There's the sound of rending metal and then the leader drops, taking Tony with him down to the pockmarked street, minions following in their wake.
There are voices he doesn’t recognize talking about medical things, a lot of it not in English, but he’s too drowsy to make sense of any of it. There’s Steve, and other voices he knows he should remember, talking to each other and occasionally to him. Through it all, the pressure never lets up on his right hand, and he squeezes when he remembers to, because squeezing is what he’s supposed to do if there’s a hand in his, he’s sure of it.
“Sounds like fun,” he says, and he ignores the little part of his mind that tells him he’s being an idiot, that this is a terrible idea.
Tony hmphs. “Fine. Fine! But tell Itsy Bitsy that we’re going clubbing and you’re supposed to look hot. Nothing ironed allowed,” Tony says, heading back to his workstation now that he’s deemed the clothing issue resolved.
He doesn’t hold it in this time. “Come back,” he says, voice husky with sleep. “Please. Come back to me."
Tony finally has room and sense enough to let his hands wander, and they roam over Steve’s chest, shoulders, back, pulling his t-shirt up and off, exploring the bare skin underneath. He has no idea how he got here, but he’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it’s one he definitely doesn’t deserve. He doesn’t have the wherewithal or the strength to say no to Steve Rogers. Except…
Another sigh, this one quieter. “We all miss him, Tones,” he says softly, mournfully. “But you can’t keep doing this to yourself. It’s been two days.”
The doors close and he takes a deep breath, leaning against the metal railing spanning the mirrored back wall, closing his eyes.
And now he never would be able to be that for Tony. Not after everything he’s done, the lies he’d told to protect himself. Because who was he kidding, he wasn’t protecting Tony with that. He wasn't even protecting Bucky. He was nothing but a coward, afraid to face the truth, afraid of the consequences. He’d never even given Tony a chance, not until it was too late.
Steve laughs loudly, pushing Tony's shoulder playfully. "Beer is fine, European if you have it," he responds, still smiling. He heads over to plop on the fine leather couch in the middle of the lounge, letting out a gusty sigh and knocking his head back against the cushions, eyes closed.
“Here, come sit down,” Steve says, not answering Tony’s questions. He helps him stand, guides him a short way across the lab to the ratty old couch he and Bruce like to sit on to watch old Star Trek episodes.
Steve lost his scarf and jacket somewhere between the kitchen and the hallway so Tony gets to work on his shirt, rucking it up to expose an insane set of abs and probably the most mouth-watering pecs he’s ever seen. Steve helps, pulling it over his head and off, and then they’re finally pressed together again, skin to skin, and their mouths meet eagerly somewhere in the middle.
He doesn’t hear from Steve for two weeks. No calls, no texts. He has no idea how the mission went, other than what Rhodey told him, that Steve had returned to HQ safe, with Bucky in tow.
The main avenue isn’t much better than the party upstairs. People are everywhere, with sparkly hats and party favors and oversized plastic glasses with “2011” superimposed over the eyeholes. Shoving his hands in his pockets and ducking his head, Tony starts to walk, hoping he won’t be recognized. It’s a stupid hope, he’s Tony Stark, for fuck’s sake, and he smiles gamely and shakes peoples hands and signs a few autographs when passersby do inevitably make the connection.
“You remind me of someone,” Tony mumbles, and Steve pauses as he sets the second shoe on the floor next to the first.
The compound is too far. Tony has a driver pick them up and take them back to the tower. There’s a lot of touching and kissing in the backseat, and when they finally make it up to the penthouse they tumble straight into Tony’s bed.
why I’m not going back there, because I’d get it from all of them, too, and I can deal with it from you, but not from everyone else.”
That’s it, nothing else. No thank you for finding him, possibly saving him, no tearful reunion with Steve, no breakdown, not even a What's the plan now? Just, I’m done, and the damned Winter Soldier stalks by him and heads back toward the main fight. Tony stares at Steve, who is gazing after Barnes, looking both unsurprised and nostalgic by this turn of events. He glances at Tony and shrugs, smiling slightly before jogging after his friend.
Tony’s unbagging the food and snapping his chopsticks in two when Steve asks suddenly, “Why are you drinking?”
On his screen, Steve is backing slowly away from the door. “Tony, they’re right outside the door.” His voice is still quiet. He grabs his shield from where it had been leaning against the wall. He’s standing in front of Jamie’s crib now, and Jamie has gone silent, perhaps sensing the tension in the room.
“Tell me about your family,” Tony says suddenly. Yinsen looks up questioningly. “Wife? Kids? Are they smart? Wanna be doctors, like you?” Tony throws out questions before he can think better of it. He doesn’t know if he’s crossed a line; so far, every time they’ve talked about Yinsen’s family he’s found a way to sidestep the topic. But Tony learned long ago how to bulldoze through uncertainty and awkwardness to get answers, and right now he wants to hear about things worth living for, things worth going home to.
"Bucky's in Germany because he's working on taking down a new Hydra base. He's in contact with me, and if he needs them, the rest of the Avengers. We're going to take them all out together." And that's kind of poetic, Captain America and the Winter Soldier, Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes taking out Hydra once and for all. With a little help from Tony Stark and the rest of the Avengers, of course, because they're not going to just sit idly by when there's all kinds of explosions and fun to be had. "The team is resting, we're moving you to New York tomorrow morning to finish your recovery, and we're going to gather some intel for Bucky. He'll be in touch."
His heart monitor picks up and it must alert someone at the nurse's station, because a nurse comes in almost immediately and starts checking all his readouts, asking how he feels in stilted English.
More money changes hands as Tony talks their way to the front of the line and past the bouncer, and as they walk into the club, nobody stops them to ask for a picture, so Steve guesses they’ve done at least a half-decent job at disguising themselves. Once they get inside, he decides they should be safe from being recognized for the rest of the night, with the lighting in the place dim as it is.
They get into the city in record time and Tony takes them into a neighborhood Steve’s not familiar with, pulling into a packed parking lot just after 10 pm. He drops the Audi off at the valet stand, where an attendant takes the keys with what Steve is sure is an enormous tip.
Sam tells him that Steve is seeing a shrink now, trying to get his head together. He says that the stress of the last couple of years since the defrost had been hard on him, and that dealing with Bucky has just exacerbated that. That they’ve diagnosed Steve with PTSD and anger management issues, and Tony could have told them that instead of them paying for a SHIELD psychiatrist to do it, but whatever, it’s not his problem anymore.
Tony nods, face pressed into Steve’s neck. He opens his mouth, closes it. Huffs out a breath. Tries again. “Steve—“
“Tony.” His voice is rough with emotions. Tony must hear it because he stills, gently placing his tools down on the workbench.
She smiles prettily at him and asks in a quiet voice, “Can I find anything for you, Captain Rogers?”
Tony reaches down to unbuckle his belt, pulling it off and throwing it somewhere to the side. He gets to work unbuttoning Steve’s pants as Steve starts in on his. They kick off both pants and underwear and then all that lovely skin is being pressed down onto him and Tony arches up, melding them even closer together. He hisses as their erections meet and Steve’s eyes flutter closed and he swallows visibly.
“You need to eat more, Tony. You’re not young—“ “Hey!” Tony interrupts indignantly. “—anymore and you need to be more aware of your diet. And you need to start keeping better sleep hours, too,” Steve adds.
“Steve Rogers,” the man says. “Nice to meet you, too.” His smile softens as he lets go and they resume walking, this time together.
Tony pulls back to look at his face, blotchy and red and covered in tear tracks. He unclenches his fists and reaches up to cup Steve’s cheeks gently between his hands, thumbs brushing away wetness.
They’re playing backgammon. Again. He’s getting so bored with the game that he’s getting sloppy, and Yinsen is kicking his ass. He groans dramatically and throws his hands up, standing and grabbing his car battery before pacing circles around their room. Oh, sorry, their cave.
Steve’s hand squeezes tighter. “It’s not like that,” he says, voice low. Tony knows he’s treading in dangerous waters but couldn’t keep his mouth shut if he wanted to.
There are hands on his shoulders, pulling him back, out of the room, and it might be Hydra but he doesn’t care, they should just kill him too. He has nothing left to live for. He looks up, sees Steve lying in a pool of blood, his blood, facedown, shield at his side. Sees the small figure of his son in his crib, pale yellow wall behind covered in red. He scrambles for the catches on the armor, can’t find them his hands are shaking so badly, gasps out “JARVIS.”
Tony’s drinking more, something else Steve has noticed, but he’s got it under control. He’s expected to at these shindigs, anyway, and if he has one or two by himself at home, it’s not a big deal, he’s just stressed after a long day’s work dealing with the incompetant morons at R&D that Pepper assures him are qualified, she’d screened them herself, thank you very much.
Steve chugs the rest of his beer. Signals for another. Tony does the same, and Steve can’t find it in him to tell him no. Tony’s had this weight on his shoulders for over a year now, probably longer, because Tony always thinks he has to do things alone. Always thinks his team, his friends won’t have his back when he needs them. Steve wants to ask why, how could he think that, and he remembers the files he was given on Tony Stark just after he came out of the ice, the ones that spelled out a lonely childhood and an emotionally abusive father. Tony Stark, who took over a multi-billion dollar company at 18, who had to take down his traitorous father-figure on his own after being kidnapped by international terrorists, who was forced to save himself by inventing a new element while suffering from heavy metal poisoning. He’d never had anyone to count on his entire life, and Steve had never really given him any reason to think he’d be the one to finally have his back.
By the time Steve brings his lunch down at two, Tony’s already given up on the glass and taken to drinking straight from the bottle. He’s sitting on the couch with the Iron Man helmet in his lap, and as Steve sets the tray of food down on the table he takes a long pull of bourbon.
He can see it all manifested in the way Tony is now, with his tendency to shy away from emotional situations, in the way he craves physical contact, the way he dances around questions about himself while maintaining a facade of confidence and narcissism.
He’s still rambling by the time the doors open onto Cap’s floor. Tony waltzes in, clearly expecting the other man to follow behind, and he does. There’s an open living area complete with flatscreen TV and couches, and past that is a classically modern kitchen. Everything’s done in neutral colors, muted browns and tans and blues. There’s a hallway that leads to a bedroom and a luxurious bathroom, and another door that leads off to a room lined with floor to ceiling windows and a giant oak desk filled to the brim with art supplies. There’s also an easel in the corner and a closet overflowing with different types of paints, but Tony think’s he’ll leave the soldier to discover that room on his own. It might be a little much, he’s not sure. He's not very good at gift-giving. Example: the Giant Stuffed Bunny Fiasco of Christmas, 2013.
And so it goes, Steve arriving on Friday night after team workouts end for the week, and Tony makes a point of telling his secretary not to schedule any shareholder meetings after 2pm on Fridays, and absolutely no weekends unless she wants to find herself another genius billionaire to work for.
Tony sighs. “There wasn’t another option today, Cap. I considered the alternatives. They would have died. Twelve lives are more important than one, even if it’s mine. Especially if it’s mine.”
Steve is standing now, too, but he makes no move to come towards Tony. He crosses his arms over his chest and he’s one step away from being Captain America and that’s the last thing Tony needs right now.
Tony scoots out of the vinyl booth, Steve tucking his cash back into his pants pocket and following. At the door, Steve reaches past Tony to hold it open for him. Tony fans a hand in front of his face and breathes in a falsetto, “My hero.” Steve smirks, bends at the waist in a gentlemanly bow, and follows him out the door as Tony sashays past.
Tony rolls over, expecting to see an empty bed. He’s not wrong. He lets out a slow breath, lets his hand fall to the cool pillow on the bed next to him. Steve is usually up hours before him, so it’s no surprise. Tony remembers how he used to leave little notes,
.” His voice is breaking, but he’s beyond caring now. “I was stupid, I was so mad at you and I was drinking and I just wanted to hurt you, like you hurt me, and I did, and I wish I’d never done it. I just want to take it all back. I don’t want to lose you, Steve, but I know I have no right to ask you to stay after— after what I did, tonight.”
“Thanks for walking me back and not taking advantage of me, is what I meant to say,” Tony says, smiling slightly. “You’re my hero,” he adds, a little wry.
“Another?” the guy asks, accent thick in his deep voice. Steve nods, pushing his beer bottle across the bar, opens his mouth to speak before he changes his mind.
Happy chatters at him until Natasha and Clint come down together, matching black duffels thrown over their shoulders. Thor arrives next, smiling jovially and walloping Steve on the back, asking in a booming voice how Steve's slumber was on the eve of the day he'd be reuniting with his lost "shield brother".
“J, listen. These things are still coming. We haven’t even taken out half of them, Barton and Widow are parked, Thor's lightning is useless, and now Barnes is down. We’re not going to last.”
,” Tony says passionately, eyes bright, trying to get Steve from Virginia to understand civilian casualties. “People died,” he says again, “and nobody was being held accountable. Imagine a war where there was no bad guy. Everyone just fought and people died and then everyone else woke up the next day and acted like nothing happened. No one was punished. No one was held accountable for those deaths. That was us, that was the Avengers.”
“Iron Man, you had orders. Stand down. Wait for backup,” Steve says, tone low and dangerous, command in his voice and body. His arms are folded across his chest, muscles tense, and he looks every inch the Captain America from the comics Tony grew up idolizing. Tony's urge to punch him multiplies.
“Tony, I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m saying. I guess, I’m saying don’t wait for me. I love you, so much, but you deserve the world, and I’m a fucking mess, Tony, I’m all over the place.”
In his defense, he’s never seen Tony Stark, playboy, in action. It takes him a moment to recover, flush fading gradually from his cheeks, and by then Tony has already started speaking again.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony says, smiling brightly. He hopes it doesn’t come across as false. It’s not, really. Just a little surprised, maybe.
And right now, Steve Rogers is lecturing Tony on unnecessary risks and Tony kind of wants to hit him.
“Steve, what the fuck?” Tony tries to push his hand away, but he’s weak compared to Steve’s serum-enhanced body.
His heart clenches in his chest and it’s suddenly hard to take a breath. It’s like he’s still got the arc reactor in his chest, like his lungs are still diminished and he can’t breathe as deeply as he needs to.
He turns around to face the Captain, arms thrown wide. “Here is it. Your very own Stark Tower apartment.” He grins at the shellshocked look on the other man’s face. “What do you think?”
Steve takes a step back as if Tony had actually hit him. His gut turns to stone, heavy and painful. “Tony,” he says, appalled.
They end up at an all night diner that is, unsurprisingly, empty. Everyone’s got someplace better to be, even the waitress, apparently, because she has her nose stuck so deep in her phone it takes her a full five minutes to realize she has customers at all.
"Wait, what?" Tony asks, confused and slightly irritated. "You mean I did all that research and surveillance and we fought Doom slash Hydra's fucking Doombot hybrids and I almost fucking died to get you your best friend back and you just let him go?"
"Tony, sorry," Steve reaches out to steady him and Tony nearly flinches before covering it up with a sardonic smile, lowering his arms. Steve lets his hands fall to his sides, hardly noticing Tony's reaction with thoughts like Bucky and We found him flying through his brain. He wasn't expecting this, had almost given up hope of ever finding him at all.
Steve’s still got one hand covering his eyes, pressing down on his eyelids like he has a terrible headache, but Tony can see tears leaking out the corners, and it makes his chest clench a little tighter.
He wonders where Steve’s shield is. Probably back at the Tower, in lockup so SHIELD doesn’t do something stupid like take it away and give it to some new Captain America.
“Well, if you change your mind, handsome, you know where to find me,” she says, before taking her friend by the arm and pulling her back to the dance floor.
Steve takes a minute to look the other man up and down. Tony’s wearing tight blue jeans and a plain black v-neck t-shirt that looks like it’s softer than Steve’s sheets, and a form-fitting black blazer over it with an inner lining that flashes gold every time he moves. He’s completed the look with a black fedora and black and red Jordans.
Tony looks up from his hands, eyes burning with something Steve can’t read. Regret, or sorrow, or anger. Maybe a combination of the three.
“Where is he?” he asks hoarsely. Steve hands him a glass of water, and Tony takes a sip, easing the dryness in his throat. He hands it back and Steve takes it, setting it down on the floor next to him.
His throat feels tight and he has to blink his eyes several times to clear them. He blames it on the drugs.
“You could run it by me, Tony. Maybe discuss things with me before you decide you know what’s best for all of us.” Tony can hear the accusation in there, the implication that he’s decided what’s best for the team before and it didn’t work out so well, did it.
He struts into the more well-lit portion of the room, approaching Tony and Yinsen, and Tony doesn’t know if he’s ever felt this level of hatred before in his life. Then the man holds the head up, because that’s what it is, a severed head, and he’s holding it by the straps of a military desert camouflage helmet, and it’s a black man, and then it all pieces together and it’s like Tony’s been hit in the chest with one of his Jericho missiles because he can’t take a breath, his vision is spotting black, it’s Rhodey, it’s Rhodey’s head. Rhodey had come to rescue him and the Ten Rings had killed him and his unit and that’s what the explosions were, it was a rescue attempt. Rhodey died trying to save Tony. Rhodey’s dead, and the bastard in front of him is holding his dismembered head and grinning at Tony and Tony makes to leap forward and kill him and one of the other guards smashes a gun into the side of Tony’s temple and Tony blacks out.
"Pepper, Pep, no, don't do that, c'mon, I'm fine, Pepper..." He reaches out and she latches onto his hand, squeezing almost painfully, head bowed while she cries softly. Tony turns to look at Rhodey helplessly, who just shakes his head, his own eyes sad and a little misty.
He feels Steve bury his face in Tony’s hair, feels him inhale, and wonders if he is doing the same thing.
“Me too, baby,” he whispers back on an exhale. He closes his eyes and breathes in the scent of their son again, sees Steve smiling gently at him behind his eyelids. “Me too.”
Tony sits up and pours himself a drink with a heavy hand, then pours Steve a smaller one. Steve’s about to tell him not to waste his money when Tony pulls a flask out from an inside pocket of his flashy blazer and tops off the drink with a clear liquid before handing it to Steve with a wink.
Steve nods and FRIDAY starts up the movie, dimming the lights and opaquing the windows to prevent the city lights from glaring off the TV. Tony shuffles a little, gets more comfortable, and settles in for the show.
They’d had dinner last night together, the whole group of them, and Steve was honestly glad to see Tony again. It’s the first time he’s seen him since he left after Ultron a couple of months ago, and while the new team has started to mesh, it’s not the same. There was something young and innocent and familial about the first Avengers team, all living in the tower together, and Steve knows Tony played a huge part in that.
Or it could possibly be Steve himself, quiet and confident in the way he holds himself, friendly and welcoming. He’s only known the guy for going on ten minutes, but he can tell he’s good people. He knows things like that, he’s a good judge of character. (Obie doesn’t count; Obie’s a whole other story with all kinds of father-figure-shaped baggage, so he doesn’t really need to come into play here.)
There’s another explosion, and he watches as the house begins to slide off the cliff. His breath catches in his throat. He can’t think. Stark is in there. Tony Stark is inside those walls, the ones that are sliding into the ocean even as he stares, unmoving, thousands of miles away, an ocean and a continent separating him from where he really needs to be.
It’s been a while, but it feels as amazing as he remembers, the burn and stretch of it, and when Steve’s fully sheathed inside him they both still for a long minute and just breathe.
The unwanted sunlight is shining brightly through his closed eyelids, painting them red, and he groans pitifully and rolls over, pulling his pillow over his head. He hears Steve chuckle and removes the pillow to smack blindly at Steve with it. Steve just laughs again and grabs it away from Tony, rolling him back over and pulling him towards the sunny side of the bed.
And then there's Steve. Steve, who hangs out in his lab while Tony works, and sketches and has a sense of humor as dry as the Sahara and pretty much disproves every assumption Tony's ever made about who Captain America is as a person. Steve Rogers is stubborn and funny and clever and artistic, and a lot more little-guy in a big body and a lot less perfect than Tony's late father would have him believe.
Steve shakes his head again, squeezes Tony’s hands briefly. “I can’t. Do this. I love you, Tony, but I can’t do this anymore.”  Tony’s stomach drops to his feet, his vision grays out at the edges, and he sways slightly. “Steve, no—“
can’t even let my mistakes go, how am I supposed to, when every time I see you I can see them all lined up in your face?”
“Yeah, it’s me,” he hears Steve murmur, sounding far away. Tony feels him taking off his shoes, then his socks. Hears him move around the room, the sound of a glass bring set down on the bedside table. He floats in a space between wakefulness and sleep, feeling removed from everything, from Steve and Pepper and Iron Man and the Avengers and all those fucking feelings. Distantly, the sheets are pulled down under his body and then placed over him, and he’s tucked in, warm and comfortable and two seconds from giving in to unconsciousness completely. A warm hand runs through his hair, and it’s wonderful and he wants to purr and burrow into it. It’s the last thing he feels before the darkness swallows him.
That reminds him. "Where's Barnes?" He asks. He hadn't really thought about the Winter Soldier since he woke up... He'd been more concerned with his team and his own injuries, the whole reason for their mission had slipped his mind.
“Shoot,” Tony says, trying to keep his voice light, but Steve can hear the underlying tension that wasn't there a minute ago.
remembered when he can’t sleep at night. But he bites his tongue, bites back all the words Steve Rogers wants to say, and Tony continues.
"Cap! Long time no see!" Tony can feel the smile stretching across his face, couldn’t stop it if he tried. It's been almost a month since he left the Avengers, since he drove off in his sleek orange sports car, leaving his team behind without looking back. He's looked back since then, no question about that, but it doesn't change anything. It won’t change his mind. He’s done Avenging and superheroing and pretending to be better than he is.
“Steve?” His voice is hoarse from all the crying, his throat scratching painfully. He’s exhausted and he wants nothing more than to go back to sleep, but he's got to apologize for crying all over the other man, for being so pathetic. He closes his eyes, exhausted.
He can hear things. Smell things. He is thirsty. He thinks that if he opens his eyes he will be able to see, as well. He takes that last step, presses through the warm, inviting darkness, and opens them.
Tony allows Steve to shepherd him out of the lab and into the private tower elevator. He leans against the wall and closes his eyes as they ascend to the penthouse.
The doctor nods solemnly. “Alright. We’re going to run some tests, see what we’re dealing with here, but try not to worry too much. Head injuries can be unpredictable, but memory loss is not uncommon, like I said before. Just get some rest, and I’ll be back later, okay?”
He leaves without waiting for an answer, patting Tony on the leg like a child on his way by. Tony shudders violently at the touch, nearly biting his tongue.
“Steve, please don’t do this, you don’t want to do this, please. It’s my fault, please, I’ll keep my mouth shut, I will, please don’t go, Steve.” He knows he’s begging, and god what has he turned into that he’s begging like a teenaged girl with tears in his eyes, but he can’t lose Steve, he can’t.
Steve sighs, but Tony can hear the relief in his voice when responds over the team line. “Good job, team. Clean up, and we’ll see you back at the Tower.” Tony sees his shoulders slump as he puts his head in his hands. Tony hovers in midair, letting the NYPD take over now that the hard part’s done.
“More important than the team?” Steve asks, 100% righteous, and Tony is 100% done. That was quick. Must be a new record.
Tony is quiet for a second, then he gives in. He can’t fight anymore. “Fine, Steve. You win. Thanks for the call.”
Tony signals for another drink and Steve wants to stop him, wants to tell him he’s had enough, but it’s not his place. It never has been and it certainly isn’t now.
“Bucky!” He hears Steve’s panicked yell and wants to roll his eyes, but the guy’s got a reason to be worried. Barnes is insane. Probably certifiably. He’s reaching around the Doombot’s neck now, trying to get at the chestpiece, having worked out that’s the key to shutting them down, when suddenly there’s a sizzle and a flash and Barnes crumples. Fucking forcefield. Barnes had tried to used his metal arm, but it wasn’t enough to protect the rest of his body from the shock.
“We wouldn’t have even been in that situation if it weren’t for me, Steve. We wouldn’t have had to save the world. And how many people suffered before we managed it? How many people died? Piet—“ Tony stumbles on the name, pushes on, “Pietro died, and that was my fault, because he never would have been there had I not done something stupid, again.”
“Though, you know, I could have bought the whole bar if I’d been so inclined,” Tony continues, and god, the way the man can make him want to hug him and punch him at the same time really is something else. It takes everything in him not to snort and roll his eyes like Steve would have, before.
“Bruce, how could you?” he says plaintively. Bruce just laughs and shakes his head at Tony’s antics.
Tony groans in frustration, head tilting back to glare at the ceiling, until he feels Steve manhandle him (gently, his body still hurts, though it's much better than it was before) to the side and slide onto the bed next to him. He turns Tony until they're lying facing each other, heads on the same pillow, Steve's eyes roaming all over his face, taking it in, looking like he's never seen anything so perfect. Tony puts a palm on the side of Steve's face and presses a soft kiss to his lips, whispering against them.
Steve starts bringing him food regularly, and at first Tony doesn’t quite know what to make of it. He brings sandwiches and pasta and fruit, and then starts bringing different types of juices when he realizes Tony only has coffee and Dr. Pepper and alcohol down in the lab. Steve seems to think Tony consumes too much caffeine, and that something a little more healthy should be introduced into his diet. By the second week, he stops questioning it and just accepts it; at least he’s not getting yelled at.
“My job. I’m a banker,” Steve says, and it’s a lie and he hates it, but he mentally shrugs of the pang of guilt at lying to Tony again. Some things are necessary.
A repulsor takes out the gunman but he’s too late. He’s too late. He can’t breathe. He can’t think, he can’t breathe, he can’t stand anymore, he’s falling to his knees and gasping for air. Steve, Jamie, his family, his life, they’ve just been taken away from him, he can’t think, he must be asleep, this is a nightmare and he needs to wake up, please please let him wake up, please.
Steve hides a grin in his sketchbook. “No promises," he says, then ignores the way Tony looks all too pleased about that. "Tony, go to sleep.”
Steve’s back to looking sorrowful. “It’s the right thing to do,” he says. It sounds final and Tony knows it’s over. Nothing he says will keep Steve here, not when he’s made his decision, when he’s decided to do the Right Thing.
Another deep breath and Steve picks his head up and gets back to work on the wraps. He swallows once, then forces the words out. “Yes. It’s just — It’s rough right now. That’s all.”
He’s hiccuping pathetically now, attempting to hold back the tears and not doing a very good job of it. He just wants Steve to talk to him, say something, tell him how to fix it, yell at him, anything.
Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve and smirks, leaning down to nuzzle into Jamie’s soft baby hair. “Your Daddy is staring at us. He thinks I’m sexy.” Jamie makes a gurgling noise and grabs Tony’s nose with a slimy hand, and Tony reaches up to gently disengage his little fist. “Yes, he wants to do filthy things to this face.”
He’s got no fucking idea why he’d bring his imprisonment up, of all things, but he suddenly finds he wants to talk about it with someone. Pepper and Rhodey are always trying to get him to open up about his extended stay in the shithole of the world, but it puts him on edge, rehashing those memories to his friends, sharing the horror of the situation and the fear of his heart failing during those long, cold nights. And the shrink he’d been forced (by Pepper, of course) to see when he’d first gotten back was an unmitigated disaster. He’d pretty much spent the hour alternating between hitting on her and attempting to psychoanalyze her, answering her gentle probing with unsubtle questions of his own. If the way she stormed out of the office that last visit was any indication, he’d pissed her off pretty good and wasn’t invited back.
All he wanted was a bowl of cereal after an inventing binge. That was it. He was hungry and tired and finally done with the newest StarkPhone upgrades and he just wanted to eat something and take a hot shower and climb into bed with his warm super-soldier boyfriend. Was that really too much to ask?
Tony gets lost in wave after wave of sensation as Steve sucks him and opens him up thoroughly. He doesn’t know how much time passes but it’s enough for him to feel open and ready by the time Steve pulls off.
There’s a sudden flash of light from the windows followed by a large boom, and they both freeze in a panic. It takes a second for Tony to put the pieces together and then he’s laughing. Steve stays frozen, still buried inside him, and is looking at him like he’s crazy. “Tony, what—“
“Why?” He asks, voice quiet, strong, but overflowing with pain. Tony’s heart clenches. He’d rather Steve get mad, yell at him, throw something, hit him, even, than this. “How? How could you— I don’t understand, Tony. What did I do?” His voice trembles on the last question.
“Hey, Tony, I’ve been thinking.” Tony hmms, pulling his fingers gently through the blonde strands. “Why don’t you come visit me sometime? I always come here, maybe you could come up and visit every once in a while?”
It’s bright. So bright. His eyes slam closed, away from the harsh light, before they flutter open carefully, squinting against the brightness. Things begin to come into focus. A ceiling. Lights in the ceiling. A window, with a chair beneath it. He thinks he’s in a hospital. He’s been in one before, he somehow knows this isn’t his first time, some deep knowledge telling him so.
It could be minutes or it could be hours later when the door creaks open and soft footsteps cross the floor. There’s a shift on the bed as Steve sits down. He knows it’s Steve, can smell him, all fresh soap and sunlight and leather.
He doesn’t need Tony buying him exorbitantly priced clothes just so they can go to some fancy nightclub. He has clothes. Natasha had taken him shopping a while back after learning of his limited wardrobe when they were still with SHIELD, when she’d been trying to set him up on blind dates with various co-workers. She was adamant that they “modernize” his style, from his hair to his wardrobe to his footwear.
They walk several blocks, lost in their own thoughts, before Tony changes the subject. “So where are you headed? I mean, right now, where are you going?”
Steve’s jaw clenches and Tony’s stomach tightens. He doesn’t want to fight, but Steve needs to understand, he’s not going back there. He doesn’t need to see their pointed looks to know he’s to blame for the last time the world almost blew up.
“You’re not the only one who lost him, you know,” he says. His voice is even, but Tony can hear the struggle it’s taking to keep it that way. It’s not buried very deep, that torrent of pain and desperation, but Tony doesn’t want to sympathize right now. He wants Bucky out of his goddamn room.
Rhodey has even come to visit a couple of times, though they were less social calls and more like check ups than Tony feels comfortable with. Why he needs a check up he doesn’t know, he’s working and coming up with awesome new tech every day and he’s in a great relationship with an even better person, with Captain fucking America, how can you go wrong with that? But Rhodey side-eyes his half-full glass and tells him to be careful and Tony shrugs it off, wondering when people started caring how much drank at all.
“Yeah, that’s it,” Tony snaps, heading out from behind the bar and back towards the soft, welcoming couch calling his name. He just wants to be alone now, keep drinking until he passes out from it and doesn’t dream at all.
Steve shrugs, massive shoulders flexing and relaxing and Tony’s hands creep up to settle on them, pushing gently into the firm muscles, massaging. Steve’s eyes flutter closed.
Steve takes a deep breath, rolls over within the circle of Tony’s arms. Tony blinks slowly and smiles softly when he sees Steve’s face so close to his. He has pillow creases up his left cheek, sleep in his eyes, his hair is tousled in a way that is clearly not intentional, and Steve’s never seen anything so lovely.
Tony sticks his tongue out at the ceiling childishly, hiking Jamie up to settle more firmly on his hip. The kid is mouthing at a gummy silicone wrench, part of the toolkit Natasha got him when he started teething. It’s covered in drool, and so is Tony’s Black Sabbath t-shirt, but he figures he might not be the neatest guy if he had no teeth either, so he lets it slide this time.
He wears black to the funeral. He’d told Steve once that wearing black to a funeral was stupid, it’s depressing and funerals were supposed to be a celebration of life and he’d want everyone to wear the most garish colors imaginable to his, and toast a glass of champagne (or stupidly expensive bourbon) to him as they lowered him into the ground. Steve had laughed and said of course he did, and smiled that smile of his that made Tony want to swoon like a damsel in some dime-store romance novel, eyes twinkling.
The doctor nods reassuringly. “That’s not uncommon with head injuries. The memory of the injury itself may or may not return, and that’s completely normal, Mr. Stark,” he says. His tone is almost soothing and Tony wants to bristle, feels like maybe he’s the kind of man who would take offense at being talked down to, but he can’t find it in himself to care.
"What, Steve? Spit it out. I went off mission, I have no sense of self-preservation, I should wait for backup. I've heard it all already." He's so sick of all this, he did the right fucking thing and everyone's crazy if they think he wouldn't risk his life to save the rest of his team.
Tony straightens, and super-soldier and semi-super-soldier may be tall, but they don’t measure up to Tony in the suit.
It’s amazing, it’s wonderful, and it’s probably the happiest Tony’s ever been in his life, if he’s honest with himself. He and Steve have so much fun together, and it’s crazy because Tony can’t really remember the last time he had actual
“Tony… Just, please, try not to jump immediately to the sacrificing yourself plan. There’s always another way. We can figure it out, as a team,” he says, voice beseeching.
It’s the culmination of all those lonely nights, the painful fights and angry words and resentful silences all coming to fruition. He’s seen it coming for a long time. That doesn’t make it any easier.
He slides his hands up the sides of Tony’s body to his waist, framing his ribcage on both sides, pulling him closer. Tony opens his eyes and Steve’s lost, feels like he’s drowning in that rich, deep brown. He’s filled with wonderment at the man in front of him, in his arms, in awe of his power and his confidence and blown away by what this man can do, what he’s capable of, in and out of the suit. How much genius is contained in this one human body, how fragile it is, how magnificent. He wonders how he’s never seen this before, then he thinks that he has, of course he has. Tony’s always been exceptional.
“Cap? Cap! Fuck!” Tony swears, cursing Dr. Doom for his fucking paranoia and his fucking communications blocks. He’s grateful their comms are working at all right now, thanks to his new tech, anyone else’s would have been rendered useless the moment they crossed the border hours ago, but he needs to be able to hear his team from more than three blocks away or it’s not going to help him for much longer. The fight keeps spreading out, and the longer Steve chases Barnes the further out of range he’s going to get.
He tries on a smile and it feels forced. It stretches his chapped lips and he feels them split, wincing slightly at the sudden pain.
Tony whistles appreciatively when Steve meets him in the foyer at 8 that evening. Natasha had picked out a dark blue henley (that Steve feels might be one size too small but that Natasha assured him fits him perfectly) with the sleeves pushed up to the elbows, and a pair of dark gray jeans with sleek black shoes. His hair is styled slightly messier than normal, and, as Tony had requested, he’d left the stubble on his face alone.
He spends a lot of time in his private lab. He’s been terrible at going to meetings for SI, telling Pepper that he’s on the verge of a breakthrough, and who knows, he might be, he can hardly remember what he’s working on at the moment but it must be something good because it’s keeping the asshat shareholders quiet.
"If you're riding along with the medical team, you better get on board, sir," a young EMT with a strong Romanian accent interrupts. "Sirs," he corrects, glancing nervously at Bucky. Bucky says nothing, just squeezes Steve's shoulder once and lets go, turning toward the helicopter. Steve thanks the man and hustles after him.
He waits for the other man to catch up and sticks out a hand. “Tony Stark. Nice to meet you. Yes, I’ll give you an autograph. No, I can’t let you try on the Iron Man suit. Though if you’re very convincing maybe I can take you for a quick ride.” He raises his eyebrows suggestively and Cargo Guy chuckles.
