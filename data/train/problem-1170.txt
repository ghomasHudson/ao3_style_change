"John, please." I hold up a hand, and it is a measure of how far we have come that he listens to me, that he ceases his pacing and prowling and holds still, arms crossed over his chest, waiting. I take a moment and try a different approach. “Listen to me, John," I say more calmly. "Do you remember the first night we talked, when I broke down and you helped me through it?”
link. But all that happened was that the hourglass icon appeared, a set of small dots swirled around it for a few seconds, and then the screen reverted to the PIN field.
“221B Baker Street, by any chance, mates?” he asked with a wink.
"Yes, Mrs. Hudson," I say, though I am looking at John as I say it. "I think everything is going to be fine now."
The sound of the doorbell echoed through the building again, followed by the tap of Mrs. Hudson’s heels as the lady herself went to answer. Soon after came the boom of a man’s voice and the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs. Quick and heavy—the man, then, not Mrs. Hudson.
Some thirty minutes later, after Lestrade and his crew had taken charge of the suspect (“Clocked him a good one, yeah?” Lestrade had commented, standing over the still very much unconscious Mulroney. “He tried to stab John,” Sherlock had said with a glower, and Lestrade had simply nodded. No one came between Sherlock Holmes and his blogger—or vice versa, as Mulroney had just discovered to his detriment), Sherlock and John had given their preliminary statements and hailed a cab back to Baker Street.
John hummed again.
“The Incredible
"Yeah," says John, adjusting his grip on Rosie and looking back at me with a small smile. He looks tired, but there is a light in his eyes that wasn't there before. "I think so, too."
(See the end of the chapter for
John groaned and rubbed his face with one hand. "Ugh...Sherlock, don't you think that third bout might have set the countdown back a bit?"
“You staring at my crotch is also not helping,” Sherlock muttered under his breath, still gazing out the window.
In the wake of Mary’s death and the maelstrom that was the Culverton Smith case, and especially since Eurus's eruption into our lives, John has been struggling. As have I, truth be told. So much has happened, and so much lies between us. We have lost our way, I think. Lost each other in some ways, though physically we are closer than at any time since my fall. John and Rosie have come to live with me here in the revamped 221B, and for all intents and purposes, we are a family.
When John next awoke some hours later, early morning sunlight was slanting into the flat. Something soft and warm was over him, and after a moment he recognized it as the down comforter from Sherlock’s bed. He took stock of his condition. The headache was mostly gone—only a faint echo of pain remained at the back of his skull. His back was killing him, but that was only to be expected after a virus of this sort, followed by a night spent on the sofa. His fever appeared to have broken while he slept: there were no more chills, but his skin felt clammy where the drenching sweat had dried, and his hair was plastered to his scalp.
All right, then. Sherlock sighed, gave up, and clicked on the
John blinked at him.
“Sorry,” Sherlock panted. “Bit sweaty.”
John smirked all the way to the bathroom.
When John took his first sip some minutes later, he found that Sherlock had stirred in a bit of honey. John didn’t normally sweeten his hot beverages, but this felt like heaven on his still-raw throat. He closed his eyes and gave a contented sigh, then opened them again and sought out his flatmate’s gaze. The tender look had not vanished.
John leaned forward again. “So tell me, Sherlock. Last night, after you barged in on me in the midst of an epic wank and saw me shooting off all over my own belly—”
“No,” said Greg. “He isn’t. At the very least, he’s bi. We do exist, you know.”
“Hey.” John’s hand tightened on his knee. “I don’t mind that you watched it. In fact, I was counting on it.”
Anderson narrowed his eyes in suspicion, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. “Have I.”
John ran a parched tongue over cracked lips. "I feel like a tin of smashed arsehole, if you must know. Pretty sure a newborn kitten could give me a good thrashing about now." John struggled to sit up.
“Well,” said John with a weak smile, “scientific wisdom may say otherwise, but I have definitive proof that time travel is indeed possible.” He didn’t need eyesight to sense the bemused look Sherlock was shooting him. Was the fever making John delirious? “Pretty sure I just chundered meals I haven’t even eaten yet.”
All at once he became aware of two things: one, that he had blushed scarlet with mortification, and two, that he was a bit aroused. Okay, a lot aroused. Okay, so rock hard that the head of his cock was nudging at the waistband of his underwear and if he moved the wrong way, he was going to come off in his pants. Sherlock saying his name at a time like that, even if it had been in surprise,
He reached out and picked it up, turning it every which way for close examination. It was a black plastic cylinder, broader at one end than the other. The word “Fleshlight” was emblazoned on the side, and it did look a bit like a torch, although it was far too lightweight to actually be one. The broader end of the object, where the light source would be if it were an actual torch, consisted of a soft, rounded silicone surface, designed with a cleft and a small, puckered opening. The material was very soft to the touch, and so malleable that it stretched around Sherlock’s finger when he inserted it into the opening. He felt around the inside. It seemed to consist of more of the same material, but moulded into a variety of shapes and textures. Mystified, Sherlock put the item back on the dish rack.
John cocked his head quizzically, waiting for the rest of the sentence.
John giggled despite himself, then sobered. “I nearly died, Sherlock. Some lorry driver had a heart attack and lost control and hit a woman and she
“Like this
“And a good morning to you, too,” said Greg, eyebrows climbing sardonically. “I’m well, thanks for asking. How are you?”
“Oh,” Sherlock said with a grimace. Then he stood taller. “
“Yeah,” he says, nodding. “Right. Okay.” He looks up at me, then, and I can see the sorrow in his eyes. The remorse there, and the promise. “I am so sorry, Sherlock. So bloody sorry, you can't even—” he breaks off then and clears his throat, staring at the floor and blinking hard. It is a moment before he can continue. He breathes in and looks back at me, lets me see the truth in his eyes. Tears fill them as I watch. “I swear to you, Sherlock, I swear to you I will never touch you in anger again. Never again.” He wipes his eyes with the heel of one hand, sniffing, then nods to himself as though reaching a decision. “In fact, I’m going to make sure of it.”
“I’m speaking out of concern, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said softly. “For both of you.”
Sherlock drew himself up to his full height, aiming for a dignified pose, as befitted a person in the throes of righteous indignation. “Well...yes, I suppose.”
At first, nothing much seemed to change in the wake of John’s big pronouncement. In fact, things were better than ever. Sherlock had John’s full attention, with the exception of his shifts at the surgery (dull, but John seemed to feel they were necessary), and he no longer had to worry about interference from potential love interests. It was perfect.
John looked so miserable that Sherlock subsided with a low grumble, turning to sit beside his friend on the bathroom floor, making sure to stay close so John knew where he was. Now he knew just how John must have felt all those times Sherlock had disregarded his medical advice. John sagged against the bathtub, head tilted back, eyes closing. His skin was blotchy, feverish flush warring with the pastiness of nausea, petechiae dotting his face. Sherlock had never seen him look so ill.
John!"
“These,” John said firmly, “are mine. Kettle’s on the hob. Make your own.”
“Well,” said a silken baritone in his ear. “It would seem we both have some housekeeping to do.”
“Hmm?” John asked.
“My deduction. Was I right?”
“Oh, I know. I watched the press conference earlier. Terrible, what they were going to do to those kids. They should be locked up forever.”
“Quite so,” Mycroft nodded.
Shankley nodded. “Aye, those are classics. Then there’s the inanimate object category. In there we’ve got arm rest—”
But he had to get to the bottom of this. He cast a quizzical look back at John over his shoulder. “So, whatever it was, you...worked it out, then?”
“Emission?”
After a few minutes, John stirred. The hard floor was uncomfortable. He sat up, though he kept one hand on Sherlock's arm for support.
“Really, for a man whose entire job revolves around the ability to observe, you lack even the most basic suitability. You missed absolutely
“And without you, I end up staring at my gun,” he says, “or disappearing into a bottle. We’re no good together, are we? But we're even worse apart. What the fuck do we do with this, Sherlock? I’ve gone and bollocksed up a good thing.”
Sherlock looked down into John’s earnest face and relented. He could never deny John Watson anything. He sighed, did as he was asked, and returned to his seat. He settled in, crossing his legs and folding his arms over his chest, gaze wary and expression shuttered. John moved his hand to Sherlock’s knee as though to hold him in place, and Sherlock had to admit it was working. Whether John knew it or not, Sherlock would never voluntarily move away from John’s touch—not without a compelling reason. But he couldn’t seem to meet John’s eye.
Sherlock fled to his bedroom, flopping down onto his bed and stretching out. It was a relief to be away from that stare. He had expected some sort of fireworks from John after his interruption of the date, possibly even another domestic to rival the last one, but this? Why had the expected explosion failed to materialize? At the very least, he had thought John would spend a day or two stalking around the flat in a ball of pent-up anger, clenching his hands into fists and emitting periodic rage sniffs. There would be a long walk or two, perhaps a whinge session at the pub with Mike Stamford or Lestrade. Then a case would come up, a really first-rate one, and there would be the thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through their veins, the high of solving it, getting it right—together. They’d go out for Chinese, and all would be well again.
Warmth blooms through me at this, spreading outward from my chest until I can feel my pulse thrumming right to my toes, though my throat seems to be closing up. I have wanted this for so very long. “I would like that," I manage, “very much.” Which is a bit like saying the British like tea or the Japanese go in for seafood. Factually accurate, but also a massive understatement.
. There had been no threat. Sherlock was fine. He hadn’t fallen. No threat at all.
“Ta,” John said again, closing the door behind her. Cath was bent over the bed, opening the zip on her overnight bag. “Mm-hmm, very nice,” he said, not in reference to the room. Cath straightened up, giving a little smirk as she noted the direction of his gaze.
Hey, Sherlock. Your phone was having fits in your coat pocket and I didn’t want it to wake you, so I put it on silent. Hope that’s okay. The surgery called—they’re shorthanded today, so I’m going in for a few hours. I was thinking maybe Thai later? Let me know.
“John,” Sherlock gasped, and John’s cock surged at the sound of his name spoken in that gorgeous baritone, gone all gravelly and rough with passion. “Hnng—not going to last—”
When he heard the water start up, Sherlock released a shuddering breath. He pushed the flask onto the worktop and slumped forward, bracing himself on his hands against the edge of it. He blinked unseeingly down at the counter. He had made some deductions about John’s physicality over the years, based on the other man’s distinctive gait, sitting posture, stride length, and one or two glimpses through tight clothing, but what he had just seen exceeded even his most generous estimates. For such a compact man, John was clearly big in all the ways that counted. His dick was frankly magnificent, and that was in a flaccid state. Imagine what it would look like hard! Suddenly Sherlock’s big toe wasn’t the only part of him throbbing.
John put his hands over Sherlock’s. “I can’t see, Sherlock.”
John bent over his chair, rummaging around the seat cushion in search of the device. “Ah, got it!” he said, straightening up. He bounced the device in his palm. “Best get this on the charger.” As he turned to find his charging cable, the sheet snagged on his chair cushion and pulled away, giving Sherlock a sudden eyeful of John Watson’s (frankly breathtaking) penis. He gave a yelp. The flask had bounced off his big toe and rolled some distance away.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Greg asked.
Sherlock stopped and turned to face him, and they both sobered.
Three hours later, he bolted upright in bed, certain that he knew what John had been mulling over. He’d been thinking about leaving—not just
“Okay,” Greg said, gesturing at the board. “We’ve got a set of 19 photos in all, posted to NSY, received this afternoon. The envelope’s at the lab now, but so far no prints, postmarked in London yesterday, so not much to go on there. Address was printed, not handwritten, so not much there, either. No accompanying note, just the photos.” Greg gestured at the board. “These are copies, of course. Originals are also with the lab.” He hooked a thumb over his shoulder at Anderson’s desk. “More copies are in that file folder if you’d like a closer look.”
“The news...is not good, Dr. Watson,” came Mycroft’s solemn voice. “As I told you earlier, Mrs. Hudson was transported to the Royal London by ambulance at 9:31 this morning. She went into cardiac arrest just as they arrived at the Emergency Department. They attempted to revive her for 45 minutes, without success. She was pronounced dead at 10:32 a.m.”
John gave him an incredulous look. “Is it your turn to take the piss now?”
“Imagine, Anderson,” Sherlock murmured. “Imagine that you want something.” He waved a hand at the imaginary scene. “You want it more than you’ve ever wanted anything in your life. You’ve been wanting it for years. And one day, out of the blue, it’s offered to you. It’s right there in front of you, there for the taking, and just as you reach out for it, just as you have it within your literal grasp, you get called away for nonsense like
“Now it’s become high-profile,” said Lestrade, “and I’ve received orders from on high to get to the bottom of it. The kid, Nicholas Luddington, is originally from Somerset. Parents in the middle of an ugly divorce, home life difficult. He ran away, was traced as far as London. His parents are beside themselves. Nicholas was last seen near in an industrial estate in Tottenham, which happens to be where Lester has his headquarters.”
Jen beamed. “Great! I’ll leave you two to settle in. Come see me when you’re ready to leave and I’ll give you directions.” She made for the door. “Bubbly’s in the fridge!” she said over her shoulder as she exited.
Sherlock gave a long-suffering sigh. “Hair like mine is a chronic condition, John. There's no cure, but with care, it can be managed.”
“I noticed it. It seems to be an art installation of some sort,” Anderson said.
And then Sherlock remembered the thing that he had failed to notice at the time, caught up as he was in his own arousal: there hadn’t been just one man’s voice on that video. There had been two.
This was entirely unacceptable, and John needed to hear that, pronto. Sherlock leapt out of bed to go tell him, but he’d fallen asleep still wearing his dressing gown. It tangled in the bedsheets, sending him toppling to the floor with a crash. The bedroom door opened almost instantly.
Mycroft swallowed hard, eyes wide. “Right?" he croaked. He cleared his throat. "About what?”
. Sherlock blushed scarlet at the thought. Then he sniffed his finger.
THE PIN IS INCORRECT. TRY AGAIN.
“—but cranial trauma by sex toy...that is something I never anticipated.” Mycroft advanced into the room and stood leaning on his umbrella, waiting. Sherlock ignored him, fingers still flying over the keypad. With a long-suffering sigh, Mycroft strode over to the client’s chair, moved it into its customary position, and took a seat, straightening his trousers to preserve the crease. He observed what his brother was doing.
No, too far to the right, change it.
But even the small motion of turning his head and shifting his back causes Sherlock to stir and groan. John freezes. The detective’s eyes flutter, before dipping closed again.
And Sherlock will sit at his loom, with his Ithacan sister, and sew his tapestry, tear it apart, and rebuild it every day, as he waits for his love to return from Calypso.
The plaza is already rather crowded when he walks through, a variety of people in scrubs or civilian wear discussing nothings. The cafe is at the end of the plaza, and John catches sight of the sign with some relief, when a loud beeping catches him off guard.
“Oh, Dr. Watson, you can relax,” she says cheerily. “If we wished to kill you, we would’ve done so by now.”
What was he going to do? What was he going to tell Sherlock?
John’s eyes sweep over Sherlock’s body, those intricate curves and alabaster skin. Desire begins to fill him again, which brings with it terror.
!” Sherlock snaps angrily. “Are you going to bring that up every
Even after they both come, they remain interlocked, kissing, still naked and sweaty.
Thank you everyone for kudos-ing, bookmarking, commenting, etc. I love you all.
It’s blank. Not black, like what occurs when one meets their Soulmate, but blank.
It takes a week for Sherlock’s black eye to heal. It takes even longer for John not to be angry.
“By the way, Lestrade, when you, or any of the other incredibly qualified policemen at the Yard came in here to investigate, did you bother to look up?”
Sherlock doesn’t reply, not listening in his sleep. John turns away and lets his own eyes drift shut, knowing there won’t be any answers in his dreams either.
Mike doesn’t laugh, instead looks almost spooked. John furrows his eyebrows.
At this point, I’ve only been focusing on the wall ahead of me, making sure to step in the right place, to keep from falling into the disgusting muck. Now, I grip onto the holds as hard as I can and look down.
In that time, that was all he needed. As he grew older, and the size of the Watch was adjusted to meet his growing arm, he still would curl up close to her. When he was too old to crawl into her lap he would sit beside her, and she would tell him more about the stories.
know my name. I flail desperately through the cropped and distorted memories, looking for anything that sounds familiar, familiar enough to be something I was called.
“Is that what you think this was about?” he snaps, still shouting, and he’s pacing again. “You think that I’m upset because you didn’t
“Good morning,” the detective yawns as he pads into the kitchen. His hair is a mess, his eyes squinted, and a sheet crease is still evident on his cheek.
He hurries back to the flat as fast as he can, sprinting up the stairs once the cab drops him off. He leans against the door heavily, his eyes moving to find Sherlock.
But filling up a glass can only take so long to begin with, and soon John is able to turn off the stream, and finally partakes in gulping down the beverage; the cold liquid relieving his dry mouth immediately, and he can feel it running down his stomach. He drinks the whole glass, letting it sate and soothe him, because it’s just, just right.
Should he move? Stay where he is? What if he just walks away from her?
But there isn’t time to think. It’s just like a mission. He has to find the target, neutralize the enemy, and every second is a wasted one. He takes a large breath and rushes into the left one.
For a while, when he is first on his own, Mycroft visits, to make sure that his brother stays on the right path (he doesn’t), and is doing well (he isn’t).
Yet that night, John already knows that he’s going to move in with him.
One night, Sherlock comes home as John is finishing cooking dinner. It’s nothing particularly arduous, just a chicken cooked in sauce, but Sherlock lets out an audible hum when he enters the kitchen.
The sudden pulling and moving has made John love drunk, and he follows Sherlock easily, wrapping his arms around the other. “What the hell has gotten into you?”
“Don’t let her eat that, please.” John’s tone was one of suppressed amusement. “I don’t think that’s one of the five a day.”
, he admonished himself). Some nights, when John was exhausted after a long day at work and then cooking for everyone, Sherlock took it upon himself to gently wipe down Rosie’s food-stained fingers and face and take her up to bed. He never read to her (
He thought for a bit, then – “I have a feeling Mycroft was right about the retreat. It’s the only thing connecting all the cases. We need to go there. I’m sorry.”
They make it to the retreat with only minor incidents along the way. Never let Mrs Hudson have access to your bags.
The Crai Retreat of Healing was situated gorgeously on the rough heather hills of the Brecon Beacons, the stormy grey stone walls nearly indistinguishable from the tempestuous skies. The country house kept several a few smaller buildings in its shadow. The manor looked a respectable size and must, at one point in time, have been a lordly dwelling.
He liked London at this time of night. It was quiet in the backstreets near Holborn, his the only footsteps echoing faintly between the age old buildings. If he turned right on the next street, he’d find Edgar, of his homeless network, but he wasn’t in the mood for a chat. He needed to think.
An upturned corner of the mouth and a little amused exhalation through the nose was the only response. John braced himself, then pushed onto a topic they desperately needed to discuss next.
John’s stomach was in his shoes and he thought maybe his heart had stopped as well. What the hell was Sherlock on about? He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. He closed it again. He looked at his friend, the most important person in his life, and several feelings began to compete. Anger, always anger at Sherlock and his deductions and his tactlessness, but also shame and fear. God, a lot of fear suddenly rose up, like icy blue poison racing through his veins. So many things he said had been true. Had Sherlock seen it? Had he always known what John felt? Is that why he never said anything, because Sherlock didn’t feel the same way? But another feeling rose. ‘The man I love’… and there was a glimmer of hope, a treacherous spark of
Sherlock stood up hastily. “I- I should’ve done that, here, let me.” He hurried towards the sink.
want him… Sherlock could never be what John deserved. He could never live up to those kinds of expectations. He’d fuck up everything spectacularly and lose John forever. But there was another part, a much bigger part, that wanted John. That wanted to kiss him and wake up next to him and other things that his inexperience couldn’t even dream up yet. Maybe they could -
Look at this! Group sessions!”
“Mrs Hudson…” The words left his lips in a mere whisper, filled with abject horror.
And Sherlock, apparently satisfied with the session’s result, stood up to get himself a cup of tea. John let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and deflated into his chair. He tried, to meet his friend’s eyes, but he was definitely avoiding his gaze. Closest to the truth, Sherlock had said... was there truth in those pivotal words?
“She loves a good crime story. Wonder if she’ll want to become a detective when she grows up.”
“I can take her.” He held out his hands and John obliged, handing over the little girl to him. Sherlock
“I can’t go with you.”
“Yeah. Oh.” Sherlock echoed. He’d never kissed like that. He’d never
“There you go, Watson, there’s a good girl. Now get some good sleep for me, okay?” He muttered as he laid her down in her crib. Tucking her in, he placed a kiss on her forehead and stroked her cheek with a finger. He’d never liked children… of course John’s child would be the exception.
“Don’t be.”
kissed like that… well, he’d kissed, but it had never had this effect on him. “Was that… okay?”
fragile. John had walked into his life one day and he’d just been… part of his life ever since. When he Fell – and yes, retroactively, he might’ve handled that differently – he fully expected John to wait for him. To be there to pick up where they left off. He hadn’t anticipated Mary. It felt like he had been replaced, demoted. Unimportant to the only person who really mattered to him. After Mary’s death it had been worse. John had despised him. And Sherlock had truly felt like the man John thought him to be. Unworthy, miserable. It had been hateful, because the one person in the entire world who he needed to tolerate him, couldn't anymore.
“No, I think she’s nearly there. She’s exhausted herself. She went off quite a while back.” John slid down to the ground, sitting with his back against his bed. “Thanks for taking her. She’s getting so heavy, my arms were getting tired.”
With that, Sherlock was in full detective mode. There was precious little to go on; Mycroft had provided them with the details of the victims, cases the three agents had worked on and the work of the three civilian victims.
“Oh, okay. Be like that.” Then he turned to the therapist. “Should I tell you how he’s always late? Or that he leaves the kitchen cupboards open, even if my daughter can crawl inside, or that he still keeps body parts in the fridge or that he calls me over to do the stupidest things, like hand him his phone, or that there’s usually some chemicals on the kitchen table. Sometimes I come home and he complains that I never listen to him, only to find out he’s been talking to me while I’m away and he doesn’t even notice that I’m not there. Or should I mention that he is a compulsive liar, he’s emotionally unavailable, is incredibly narcissistic, is afraid of commitment and sometimes disappears for days on end. And he faked his death, making me think he died for two years.” John ended, having run out of fingers on which to count his roommate’s many offenses.
Mrs Hudson squealed and clapped her hands to her mouth in glee. Neither inhabitant of 221b shared her enthusiasm.
Like proper British gentlemen, they spent the next two hours completely ignoring the fact that they were going on a couples retreat. Sherlock refused to touch the manila folders that still resided on his chair. Instead he sat at the desk to write down his latest findings in clothing fibre analysis.
He looked sideways. He could barely make out the doctor’s features in the darkness of the bedroom, but he thought that might be for the best. Such conversations might be best without the light of day. Any facial clue he would be able to read, he’d burrow deeply into his Mind Palace to examine over and over and over… not good.
“Oh, and John was wrong about one thing.” Sherlock continued airily. “I’m not a compulsive liar. It’s completely voluntary.”
“You’re so good with her.” John said in a hushed voice, clearly not wanting to disturb her sleep. “She loves you to pieces, you know.”
So yes, the M4 on an early Saturday morning was a welcome change of pace. Sherlock had insisted on driving the rental car that one of his brother’s cronies had delivered that morning, so John was free to let his mind roam as the gently undulating English landscape whizzed past.
“Yeah. Okay. Definitely o-“ John stopped short. Rosie was turning in her crib, letting out a small whimper. They both froze, neither of them daring to make another sound. Sherlock had a ridiculous flashback to the time they stood in the living room, facing a grenade. This felt eerily similar... but Rosie stopped squirming and fell silent again, breaths deepening in sleep.
“Seven… days?” John asked, voice nearly a squeak.
“Should we bring up that we have bedroom problems and then proceed to talk about that for a few therapy sessions?” Sherlock mentioned casually. John look at him, horrified. “I didn’t think so. No, I suggest that we stick close to the truth. Anything that bothers you about me. I understand that there’s quite a bit of talking involved, which is not my strong suit. Well, talking is, but not the therapy kind of ‘opening up’. That’s more you.” Sherlock said, releasing the steering wheel and making air quotes with his long fingers.
The reason they turned their flat back into a copy of the original wasn’t because of some strict adherence to interior design. Nor was it because the wallpaper hadn’t gone out of fashion (because honestly, it had). No, they did it because both of them desperately craved what they had before.
It was as if he’d been set alight. Sherlock’s heart was hammering in his chest, so loud in his own ears that he thought he might actually wake Rosie. He thanked the very non-existent deities that it was dark, because he was certain that he flushed bright red at that. Did John sound disgusted? No, no… it didn’t seem so. Not enthusiastic, but not filled with horror either. This was okay. This was good. He felt hope and terror and -
“Come on then, don’t make me wait for you.” He said primly. John snorted with laughter and shook his head as he plunged a cup into the water.
Their therapist, Miss Wilby, had indulged their small-talk and deflections for the better part of their first session. They had met her that afternoon, when a woman in her mid-thirties with beautiful dark hair had welcomed them warmly into her office in one of the smaller blocks surrounding the courtyard at the back of the house.
“Careful, Sherlock, those are my men you’re talking about.” A dangerous gleam shone in the pale eyes.
“Watson agrees with me, don’t you Watson?” He crouched down in front of his chair, where she was sitting on the ground.
“Because we’re leaving in thirty minutes. You
“What do you think she needs?”
“For the love of… I’m not gay!” John cried, throwing his arms up, though no one seemed to pay attention. Mrs Hudson patted his arm affectionately and shuffled past him to put the kettle on.
packed. With growing terror, he lifted the item up.
“I can hear your gears grinding. I thought we agreed you’d leave all the thinking up to me?”
“Not to worry, I’ve kept it age-appropriate. And it worked. She was all chatter one minute and down for the count the next. She’s got that from you.”
“I have to talk to Mabel Young.” Mabel Young was, as Sherlock had deduced with his usual ease, the mistress of David Parker, a financial advisor who worked in the Gherkin. David and his wife Eileen were two of the civilians who had gone missing, just three days after attending the retreat.
rational thinking. Someone needs to keep you in check.”
“The Crai Retreat of Healing.” Sherlock was tapping on his phone, looking down at the screen as if it had personally offended him. “A place to reconnect with your soulmate, rebuild trust and intimacy and strengthen your relationship. Guided by our professional psychologists you will participate in therapy sess-
“Oh.” Sherlock’s face fell. “Right. Rosie. I wasn’t thinking. Well, not of her, per se. I’m always thinking.”
“Yoo-hoo!”
The detective kept rocking her gently and indeed, after a few minutes, her cries turned into sorrowful hiccoughs and before long, she started rubbing her eyes.
“Yes, of course. John, it’s really not a concern. But you had a rough one. It looks like you spent most of the night staring at the ceiling.” His tone was not unkind, and as usual, he was spot on.
He was quite pleased with that recap. Of course, he’d complained about Sherlock often enough in his own therapy sessions, but it was rather fulfilling to spit it all out
“I’m afraid there’s no choice in the matter, Dr. Watson.” His brother’s voice shook him from his train of thought.
John opened his eyes. Sherlock was looking at him, pale eyes soft. It made his heart skip a beat.
“It’s okay, just go. Can I do anything more from here? I’m nearly done with Tanisha’s Twitter timeline and it’s looking like another dead end.” Tanisha Merchant, civilian, 42 of Basingstoke, was the long time partner of Kendra Corby, 41, one of Mycroft’s agents.
“A couple. Of lovers.” The elder Holmes said delicately.
And it had been
. How
. He sported that very same look often enough.
“Yeah, I don’t think so. I’m out.” John had spoken first after Mycroft had revealed the details.
Rosie was absolutely besotted with Sherlock. John suspected it was reciprocated, though Sherlock was still tentative around her. (
Nausea roiled in his gut again. He swallowed it back.

. Things put in motion that could not be stopped. A marriage. A child. Even Sherlock’s return couldn’t undo that sequence of events.
“We should probably talk.”
John leaned back in his seat, furrowing his brow. “Can’t be before Mary, surely. And not too soon after. So… right before I moved in? Just after Eurus?”
Sherlock swallowed dryly, then opened his mouth to speak and –
John snickered. “Yeah, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. She’s still 50% me.”
“Anything you say here is confidential. I’m only here to help you.” She pressed them gently.
“Sshh. Sshh.. it’s alright girl, it’s alright.” Then to John, “get some sleep, I’ll go downstairs. I’ll bring her up when she’s out again.”
Steely eyes glared mutinously from the sofa. “And I’m the one to do it.”
They fell into an easy routine. Well, as easy as routines could become with a child. John would make breakfast for the three of them, then bring Rosie to day-care on his way to the surgery. Sherlock worked cases that sometimes took him out of the house for a day or two at a time, but mostly he seemed to be mindful of their newfound domestic rhythm. He’d even surprised John by cooking one night. It was the worst pasta John had had since his uni days, but somehow he grinned at the detective across the table as if it was the best meal he’d ever had.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who's left comments and kudos. You have no idea how much it means to me. Writing is hard, especially in these mind-numbing times. Please forgive any spelling mistakes. This has not been beta'ed or Brit-picked.
Mycroft threw a stack of folders on Sherlock’s chair opposite him. Then he stood up, straightening his back, umbrella loosely in hand.
“Don’t stay up.”
Mycroft contemplated that for a second, then shrugged. “Well, I care about the resources to train up their replacements.”
“Hmm. Skipped that part. Boring.” He brushed past the nanny with a vapid grunt of hello (honestly, a big improvement. In the past he would've ignored her) and sauntered over to Rosie.
Mycroft, there’s
The two men were hailed down by a kindly middle aged man, who escorted them inside. He introduced himself as Mr Bryce and took their bags as he ushered them into the main room. John prayed to himself that the bag wouldn’t suddenly burst open and reveal the tube inside. He would absolutely die.
“Satisfactory, eh?” John grinned. “Am I a good lover then?”
“Well, all lies should stick as closely to the truth as possible. Especially if we’re going to keep up the charade for several days. You have many fine qualities and virtues, John, and being truthful is my least favourite. I believe it would be in our best interest if we give you as little improvisation as possible.”
“Sorry ‘bout last night.” John mumbled from behind his coffee one morning. It had been a bad night, Rosie had gotten colicky and had been inconsolable. He’d spent hours pacing up and down his bedroom, rocking her gently until the cramps had settled. He hadn’t been able to sleep after.
He’d kissed a fair few people in his day, so he felt completely confident in saying that this kiss had been special. His first kiss with a man, that ought to win a podium place at least. But even aside from that, it had been a special kiss. His heart had skipped an actual beat or two and an unnameable warmth had suddenly flooded him.
He felt selfish. Last night he’d taken something, something he’d wanted for a long time. And he’d taken it under false pretences. There had been no actual need to kiss Sherlock. No watchful eyes scrutinizing their fake relationship. They’d been alone, in the dark, at home. No pretending necessary, but he'd made Sherlock believe that they needed to
The low evening sun illuminated the fond gleam in the tall man’s eyes. It did not escape John’s notice.
A fucking couples retreat. Sherlock was sure that there
Sherlock never fit anywhere.
John’s hands stilled in the soapy water and slowly he turned to his friend, incredulous.
It wasn’t that he hadn’t loved Mary. She’d been good to him – on balance, at least. She’d loved him. She’d given him a daughter. She’d been a beacon of light when he was suffering, a lifeline after Sherlock Fell. Yes, that deserved a capital F. The event that had caused
“Should we?” Sherlock refused to look up from his studies. “Sounds boring.”
With a swish of expensive coat, he was out the door. Sherlock and John looked at each other, incredulous.
Sherlock plopped down on the floor next to him, reclining to face the crib, just as John was. “I’m quite fond of her. Maybe because she looks like you. Eats just as neatly, too.”
John’s mouth went dry. “It’s looking like we might actually have to do this, then?”
John snorted, meeting his friend’s sideway glance. “I can’t outsource
wanted it.
The fluorescent glow of the lampposts reflected dully in the ever-present puddles along the city’s cobbled pavement. A bit of rain, only drizzle really, seemed suspended in the lamplight, like a fine mist. His breath formed little clouds and it reminded him of the days he smoked.
“Thanks for taking her up. I heard you telling her one of our old cases.”
. What a lark.
. Well, actually, to Sherlock it read as

Between the sandwiches she had insisted on packing, their landlady had snuck in a tube of lube.
Baker Street was a flurry of activity the next morning. Sherlock woke to find John already instructing one of Mycroft’s nannies on Rosie’s timetable and diet. Groggily, he made his way to the kitchen and nearly tripped over the bag John had already packed and set aside.

piece. One couple had been struggling with infertility, one with infidelity, the couple of agents Mycroft sent took the infidelity route too. Easy enough to act out anger, far easier than grief.”
. I discovered to my dismay, but certainly not to my surprise, that there is no such thing as a ‘happily ever after’. I remain sceptical of his commitment, I’ve overestimated him before in that regard. Don’t misunderstand, he is fiercely loyal, but he is terribly hesitant about his sexuality. Oh, and he also has internalized homophobia due to his abusive father and probably some incidents in his military career that have ingrained in him that it’s quite dangerous to act upon his suppressed homoerotic feelings. Of course it would be fine to let sleeping dogs lie, if I wasn’t keen to have a deeply committed relationship with the man I love.”
he had to do this right or John would never do it again and John was smelling like late night coffee and that one soap Molly had given him for his birthday and –
Sherlock looked at the therapist. “Right. My turn.” He drew his legs back and sat up straight. Oh boy. John suddenly felt a bit nervous.
His friend didn’t meet his eye, just withdrew a kitchen towel with a flourish and grabbed the plate John had just washed.
“So why not someone else? We’re not exactly low-key infiltrates. People know us. Know we’re not a couple.” John’s colour had returned a bit, though his face and stance just screamed
was the word that immediately came to him.
The head of the British government sighed, but proved unperturbed. “I’m afraid I must insist. I’ve lost two agents on this case already. They were investigating the disappearance of one of my MI6 agents, who visited the location with his partner. Two civilians who have visited the same location have also disappeared, bringing the total to three agents and three civilians. The next person I send in had better finish the job.”
“A couple of what?” Sherlock asked, rising fear clear in his voice. John didn’t need to hear Mycroft’s reply to know the answer. A block of ice settled in his stomach.
He shook his head roughly, chasing off the bad thoughts.
“So what are we doing in couples counselling if we have such a good relationship? You basically plonked good sex on top of our friendship. Sounds a bit too fictional, doesn’t it?”
John waved his concerns away, then stood up to clear off breakfast. He ran the sink, filling it with last night’s dinner dishes that still littered the kitchen.
Having retired to his bedroom after a long day cleaning, John sat on his bed, back to the headboard, and took a deep breath. Dust particles floated on the sunbeam that shone softly through his window. The room hadn’t changed a bit – mostly because it hadn’t been damaged in the explosion. Plus, it hadn’t been let out since he left Baker Street the night after Sherlock died… well, fake-died of course. Now here he was, back in the same bedroom after four years. Sitting here, he could almost imagine the previous four years had never happened. Like his life hadn’t been ripped apart, sewn together and ripped apart again. He could almost believe it, looking at that dusty sunbeam that signalled the end of dusk.
to be something in the Geneva Convention about torture of this level. Not that his big brother would be overly intimidated by silly restrictions like international legal frameworks regarding war. To a man like Mycroft Holmes, the law was about as useful as the Sunday newspaper. Sometimes handy, to swat a fly here, or stoke a fire there, but on the whole disregarded after a glance. Irrelevant. Obsolete.
“Here we go.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and leaned back to study the ceiling in quite a convincing act. John pretended to be riled up by that.
He finished his monologue primly, letting the word
“So… should we practice? I mean… first kisses are awkward as hell. We’ll be caught for sure if we just start necking clumsily. Jesus, how embarrassing would
It had been four long years since the end of ‘before’, two of which John Watson had spent mourning his friend and trying to rebuild his life. The third year started dramatically with the return of Sherlock Holmes, but also saw John’s marriage and the birth of his daughter. The fourth year… well, no one really liked to talk about the fourth year. That was probably the reason John and Sherlock so desperately longed for ‘before’.
“It seems like you have a good relationship, even if life can be a bit hectic. Can you tell me what actually led you to seek therapy?”
But of course, he merely needed to turn his head slightly to the left and there would be irrefutable proof that life had changed. Because of course it had changed. For the better? Absolutely yes. For the worse? Definitely yes. There was his child, his daughter who didn’t have a mother anymore. His daughter, whose father was now living in a London bachelor pad with the man who meant more to him than anyone else.
He tried to meet his friend’s eyes, but they were evenly trained on the therapist.
“Hope you have better luck with her, dear.” Mrs Hudson mumbled sleepily as they passed each other on the third floor landing. He looked back at her, only to see her retreating to her bedroom down the hall, door closing behind her.
“Right.” His stomach sank to his shoes. Of course. Of course he wanted that. It was only a matter of time before John moved on. Found another woman with hips and breasts and bright laughter and easy companionship and all the things John liked and Sherlock lacked. And if that made John happy, then Sherlock wanted that for him too… but
“Oh.” He said dazed.
“Hold your tongues. Both of you.”
“Wa ba wa.” And she let out a giggle, then fished one of the manila folders off the chair and munched happily on one of the corners.
John had loved her, in a way. But not really. Not fully. When Sherlock was gone, yes, she was his light in the darkness. But Sherlock was the entire fucking sun. The sun that would sustain life, bring a raucous joy and breathless exhilaration that made you thank God on your knees that you were put on this Earth. The sun that would burn out your retinas and blister your skin. And always at a distance too far to be reached.
Before. That was a vague word, but if you asked anyone who frequented Baker Street, they knew exactly what ‘before’ entailed. It started with a meeting at St. Bart’s and it had ended with a meeting at St. Bart’s.
“Yes, when she’ll be returning from her rendezvous with the dim-witted Mr. Acklesbury. You can always count on a nymphomaniac serial cheater to keep an irregular schedule. I’m sure I can expect her to be walking home somewhere in the next half hour.”
“Why is everyone up so early?” He muttered to no one in particular, rummaging around the cupboards for a clean tea mug. As he poured his tea, he let out a huge yawn. He’d slept… weirdly. Good, but restless. He’d had strange dreams, fantastical even. He normally deemed dreams an utter waste of brain energy, but there had been an element of happiness to this dream. He knew of course what had caused that, but in the spirit of efficacy, he compartmentalized that events of the previous night to a safe room in his Mind Palace.
“Case.”
He tore his eyes away, unwilling to look any further. He’d known there wasn’t a chance in the world that John might have romantic feelings for him – never mind that he would act on those feelings. In a strange way, there was a part of him that was relieved. Because if John
read Mycroft’s instructions, didn’t you?”
“Now? Sherlock, it’s 2:10 AM.”
his heartless brother interrupt
And he was off.
Sherlock leaned against the counter. He stood close, their arms and shoulders very nearly touching. It was maddening to John.
They looked at each other. Neither of them felt like it, but John bit the bullet.
“I think she just really misses Mary, you know.” The doctor whispered. “It sucks, knowing I can’t give her everything she needs.”
“Quite. Same as her father. If she’s a bother, just put on crap telly and she’ll zonk out on the sofa.” Sherlock shot back blithely. He grinned at John, who just rolled his eyes.
God, he’d kill for a cigarette. But he wouldn’t. John disliked it when he smoked. Normally, another person’s opinion would result in exactly zero consequences on his part, but when it came to John… John was different. John was the ineffable exception to the rule.
Sleep didn’t come easy. It hardly ever did these days. Rosie slept badly and John knew it was because she missed her mother. And John… well, John had nightmares. Between him tossing and turning, or waking up in a cold sweat, or Rosie screaming her head off at all hours, he was running on maybe two hours of sleep a night.
“Why don’t you spit it out already, Mycroft.” Sherlock bit at him. “What do you need us to do?”
“Maybe. I- I think. Yeah.” And damn him if that didn’t sound like a squeak. They were facing each other, but neither of them moved.
“She’s out like a light.” Sherlock reported one night, some time late in March. John was puttering around in the kitchen, cleaning up. He looked over his shoulder and smiled.
“We already do that, John.” Sherlock cut in dryly, rolling his eyes. “When did we get together?”
“Did you get some sleep at least?” He pressed.
It wasn’t exactly
“I should go.” Reluctantly he got to his feet, leaving the army doctor on the floor. He walked off in a slightly disoriented manner.
The room was silent for a solid minute.
that we don’t have to go to that damn retreat if you solve the case before tomorrow?” John snapped back. Sherlock’s head whipped up with a speed that made the doctor feel a phantom whiplash.
John snorted and elbowed his ribs. Sherlock accepted it gladly, grinning at his roommate.
Silence.
The detective paused, wringing the scarf in his hands ever so slightly. John didn’t miss the movement – and it only added to his disquiet. His friend was nervous, and that wasn’t a normal occurrence. Not only were they thrown an unusually hard case, the prospect of pretending to be a couple seemed to put the taller man off completely. That chilled John to the bone. Because once they started pretending… well, John wouldn’t be pretending and the detective was one of the best in the world for a reason. If the prospect of just pretending sickened Sherlock so much, what would he do when he found out John’s act wouldn’t be an act?
Can’t think about that. They were on good terms now. He had to enjoy it while it lasted. Even if the firing squad was planned for noon that day.
Sherlock looked at him with an unreadable expression.
Mycroft’s voice cut cold as steel. John froze, as did Sherlock. Mrs Hudson puttered on in the kitchen, unperturbed – ever the dissident.
“Sherlock,” sighed John. “I don’t mind. I have a few minutes before I leave. Besides, I know you hate this.” And with that, he started scrubbing caked on dinner remains off a plate.
He arrived home just after four in the morning, to cacophony.
When they were starting to clear up the house after the whole Eurus debacle, John brought a crib and declared that he and Rosie would be staying over during the renovations. To help out.
, he’d said. And Sherlock had wanted to yell back
He didn’t want to think about how horribly he’d treated Sherlock in the aftermath of Mary’s death. The shame would kill him. But somehow, like it had been an inevitability, they found their way back to each other. Damaged, broken, beat down… but finally they were able to reach the point they’d been at before the Fall.
without getting interrupted. He looked at his friend, who was slouched on the couch, long legs stretched out. He was looking at the ceiling, head cocked, as if weighing John’s response. Ultimately, he merely pursed his lips and nodded once, as if to say ‘yep, that’s about right’. John’s barrage of his misdoings hadn’t fazed him in the slightest. Well, obviously, because John had voiced them often enough.
), but he did tell her stories. John could never see from downstairs, but he imagined his little girl hung onto his every word.
He’d have many, many more of those if he could. However, their relationship was meant to be entirely fictitious. How could he be using his best friend for such egotistical means? And what if he found out? Their friendship had survived a great many things, but this? This was on another level… Wasn’t this a direct infringement on the boundaries that should exist between friends and roommates? Pushing the kiss… that wasn’t just disingenuous, it was duplicitous.
“Would it really be that bad? I mean, to pretend we’re a couple? It’s just some hand holding and calling each other sweetheart or honeybun or whatever ridiculous pet name we think up.”
I begin to peel off my clothes, noting in the mirror the dark, purple bruises just above my elbows on both arms. Upon removing my trousers I see there are similar bruises at my ankles, and horrid scabs at my knees. There are small flecks of blood, little cuts on my wrists. My fingernails are broken, and hold a considerable amount of grime under them. I furrow my eyebrows, as I run a hand through my hair again.
I’m pale, thin, my cheek bones jut out from my face almost morbidly. I have dark, messy, curling hair, and what I believe to be light eyes, though I cannot be certain in the poorly lit room. If I had to guess an age, I’d have to say I was in my mid-twenties. No noticeable wrinkles, nor any grey hairs.
I groan in annoyance, and glance at her out of the corner of my eye. There must be some way out of this.
John suddenly notices that he’s started shaking, and he groans in frustration, unable to help it. “Sherlock, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you that it was getting closer!” he snaps, trying his last effort to remain calm, to remind himself that Sherlock was just lashing out. “I knew it was coming and I should have told you! I’m sorry!”
He doesn’t have much time to dwell on this, however, as the following day Sherlock finds a new case to keep them both busy. In fact, the only thing swirling around John’s head for the next four days is the importance of tea cups, blood spatter patterns, and how little sense Sherlock makes when he makes his epiphanies.
“You could have just told me where it was!” he calls out to Sherlock as he grabs it.
“Excuse me?” he hears John’s voice from behind him. It sounds almost angry. Sherlock stops and turns on his heels to see John glowering angrily at Anderson.
“Certainly not!” Sherlock exclaims, sounding hurt. John furrows his brow as the man crosses the room to the window, glancing down to the street again. “I don’t think they knew they were going to their deaths. And it doesn’t matter. We need the connection, there has to be a connection between them all! That’s why we need to look for Rachel!”
“Lestrade,” he answers. He glances over to John, but soon he’s standing, still completely naked, and walks towards the door. “You aren’t serious.”
“How, John?!” Suddenly the man’s voice is thunderous, taking up all the space in the flat. “How are we going to talk this one out?!”
Sherlock purses his lips, then thins them into a testing smile that makes John shiver. “Fine, how about all day aside from the hour when you’ll demand to get groceries?”
John is silent, and takes a large gulp of water to hide the quietness.
Sherlock grabs John’s hair, yanks it back. John gasps, stilling as Sherlock bites and sucks on his neck. His teeth are harsher than usual, and send sharp prickles of pain throughout John’s body, yet it still gives in, melting under the contact.
She sighs. “I’m afraid it isn’t quite a choice.” She gives him another bright smile.
Six--
The woman pays no mind to my confusion, instead leads me into her home, which is exactly like her: modestly painted, smells slightly of cinnamon combined with a distant scent of cooking meat, a soft light in a small chandelier hanging on the ceiling. It reminds me of home.
Sherlock grins in return, flipping off the switch and leaving the room in soft moonlight. “If you say I am, I can start a revolution and make you the most powerful man in Britain,” he says, his teeth shining in the dark.
John frowns, and shakes his head again, trying to ignore the creeping feeling in him. “Well, there’s a process… They study you, look to see who the most compatible--”
Mary wakes up exceptionally early; the sun is hardly rising when her alarm goes off.
“Anthea,” she replies with a smirk, that’s far too mischievous.
. Up.”
After all, the woe, and misery of having to be away from a lover for so long, certainly that is a connection enough, isn’t it? Nevermind that Penelope waited loyally, patiently for twenty years, while it has been only ten days since he’s seen John, and in that time Sherlock thinks he may drop dead; not to mention Odysseus left for a ten year long war, and was presumed dead, while John has just been busy and unable to sneak away. The kinship is still there, waiting, worrying, suffering, loving.
It's been a while. Oops! Life got busy, but I swear I've been working on this chapter the whole time. This is still very much a work in progress, so things change, I go back and change things, and I get stuck... Things like that. If it helps any, I've been really devoted to this story and have been doing everything I can to craft it as perfectly as I can. Anyway. Here it is!
Finally, John pulls away, and offers an apologetic smile. Sherlock can never figure out what he seems to be apologizing for. The broken kiss? His prolonged absence? Or the situation of their relationship?
Moriarty smiles sweetly. “I was referring to your rebellious phase, Watson,” he purrs. “Covering up your Watch with tape, and telling your sister to leave her one and only. It was just ten years ago, wasn’t it?”
Instead, his eyes are stuck on the cab driver, who’s collapsed on the floor. John’s medical experience kicks in immediately, and he rushes the meter distance to the other man.
, even if it didn’t feel like home.
John stares up the stairs again, and huffs, hitting the bottom of his fist lightly against the wall. “Is he kicking me out?” he asks. “Am I going to have to leave?”
“Greg Lestrade, Detective Inspector” the man replies, grimacing and gripping his hand in a tight greeting. His Watch is blank too, but that’s a bit more expected, he looks at least half a decade older, if the salt and pepper hair is anything to go on. “I would say I’m Sherlock’s part-time boss, but I don’t think he’d like that.”
“Climax?”
Cath was a dark-haired, blue-eyed chemist with whom John struck up a conversation while having a prescription filled. Petite, pretty and fit, she liked classic rock and enjoyed hiking with her dog at the weekends. They genuinely clicked, and their first three dates had been fantastic, with the most recent one culminating in a raucous and memorable romp in John’s bed that proved their sexual compatibility beyond the shadow of a doubt. John was elated, and when Cath suggested a weekend getaway to a Hampshire bed-and-breakfast run by a friend of hers, John was instantly on board. Cath made arrangements for the care of her dog, then hired a car, and she and John set off together on the Friday afternoon.
“A plan to drive me mental.”
“Great, yeah. How far away is it?”
"Yes, you're capable of great violence," I continue. "I've known that about you from the first day. But John, you are also a fierce protector of those you love. And more than that...you're what I need. Without you, I end up with a needle in my arm,” I say simply, and it is nothing less than the truth. I look away for a moment, then back again. "I'm not being dramatic, John, for once in my life. This is a simple statement of fact. You said it yourself: patterns don't lie."
I have told him what I went through in my years away, and he has done the same.
“I believe the technical term is ‘clusterfuck,’” Mycroft supplied.
He settled back in his seat, turning his head away and thinking. It was quite obvious that something more than feeling unwell was at work here, but what? Between the time of the attempted stabbing and Sherlock’s apprehension of Mulroney, something had happened to upset John, to put that haunted look in his eyes—this was something more than just a virus.
John held me through it all, rocking me in his arms as I have seen him do with Rosie, murmuring an unbroken stream of encouragements and reassurances and promises.
The most natural thing in the world.
“Oh, I can think of better ways of working it off,” Cath smirked, taking his hand. “Come on.”

“Yes—after suffering a devastating loss and after my sister messed about in your head!”
"It's a grounding exercise, John. It will help, trust me. Five things you can see, now."
“Lust?” John suggested.
“Sherlock? You’re here?”
“And do you know where you are?”
“They won’t find anything,” Sherlock cut in, “because it’s not a tattoo. It’s the two middle letters of a six-letter word. Specifically, the word TAIWAN.” Sherlock leaned over Anderson’s desk, looming into his space. “These aren’t even photographs of people, Anderson. They’re
I don't know about you, but I can totally picture Rupert Graves's delivery of the Hulk line.
,” Sherlock retorted, shaking his head. “Baker Street,” he confirmed to the cabbie, and followed John into the car. As he sat down, he noticed the McLaren lanyard around the cabbie’s neck. “And there’s an extra fifty quid in it for you if you can make it in less than ten minutes,” he added.
“What about coffee table?” John supplied.
“John, I really think it would be best to—”
“No, John. I mean you can’t move out!”
The man groaned. “My chest. Belly. That’s all.”
“No, I’m not taking the piss! I was barely awake, just wanted some coffee, and instead I found myself staring at a—a—”
“Something’s wrong,” John murmured, frowning as he observed Sherlock. “That’s not how he usually looks when he’s on a serial killer case.”
“O...kay,” John said doubtfully, brow furrowing as he took in the spilled coffee and then Sherlock’s look of poleaxed embarrassment. “Everything okay?” he asked.
“Does your neck hurt at all?”
John cleared his throat. “Right,” he said tightly, turning away. “Right.” He spent the remainder of the cab ride looking resolutely out the window, but it did very little good. If he hadn’t known better, he would have sworn the cabbie was deliberately hitting every speed bump, pothole and uneven patch of roadway between Baker Street and NSY. He was hyperaware of Sherlock, and the minute sounds he made with every jolt were slowly driving John mad. Every tiny gasp, hissed intake of breath, and aborted grunt seemed to go straight to John’s crotch. He couldn’t help thinking about how Sherlock had been making all those same sounds and more as John—oh, bugger. By the time the cab pulled up at their destination, both men were red in the face and holding their coats in awkward positions. John began muttering to himself as he paid the fare and then exited the cab, moving like a man with a bad case of lumbago.
At the stairwell door, John reached for his own jacket as Sherlock donned the Belstaff. “I imagine you have questions,” Sherlock said.
on your cock the way I picture yours on mine?”
She reached up as though to touch Greg but stopped abruptly as something sharp jabbed her in the chest. She looked down to find the point of Mycroft’s umbrella prodding her sternum.
“Then, please, allow me to be of service,” Mycroft said as a black car drew up at the kerb behind him. They moved to the vehicle in unison and Mycroft opened the door, then held the umbrella to shield Greg as he climbed in.
“No, it’s okay,” said Shankley. “I ge’ that a lot.” He smiled winningly. “My boyish charm helps me get the baddies to underestimate me. Appearances to the contrary, I am a full-fledged police officer.”
“I do have that reputation,” Sherlock gasped, kicking his own shoes down the stairs and going to work on John’s belt. John helped him out by unbuttoning his own shirt, allowing Sherlock to push it off him and toss it aside. He pulled off his vest and shot it off somewhere over his shoulder.
“Such as...what?”
Fine, then. Sherlock tried every permutation he could think of for everything of significance to John, up to and including variations on his National Insurance number, Army service number, medical register number, and driver’s licence.
“I want this,” he said, voice reverent. “Yeah?”
Sherlock hummed, one hand wrapped around John’s wrist where it rested on his shoulder. “Perfectly sound analysis, I suppose,” he breathed, eyes twinkling. “Although I do hope you’ll go deeper.”
John’s eyebrows shot up. “
“Now, just a minute—” Anderson fired up.
"I'm here, John," he murmured with a cheek against his blogger's hair. "I have you."
“Together is the only way there is for us anymore, I think, John. I...”
“At last, realization begins to dawn,” Sherlock sneered. “Let’s move on, shall we? Let’s all take a look at this photo here.” He held it up for the entire squad to see. “The one with the
“Yes.”
“You love me...don’t you?”
Sherlock grinned, then sobered. “John, I—”
John’s cock had a wholly different and unfortunate reaction to
“Christ,” John gritted out. He put a hand over his eyes as the grief welled up. Then he took a breath, put his sorrow aside for the moment, and asked, “What about Sherlock? Where is he?”
“How so?”
“Happy to be of service,” John said, and held the door open for him.
Greg roused himself from his stupor, smiling gratefully. “I’d love some, Mrs. Hudson, but I’ve got to get back. We wrapped up a big case and we’re putting it all to bed.”
was the matter with him? He was becoming almost as sex-obsessed as John himself.
Now Sherlock stood staring down at the empty pavement, lost in thought. His brother and Lestrade would doubtless be quite nauseating from now on. There would be public displays of affection, little
“Perhaps a bit,” Mycroft acknowledged, smiling. “Though it was entertaining.”
— John’s brain replayed the spectacular sight of Sherlock ejaculating, juxtaposing it with the sound of Sherlock groaning his name, and that was it. John knew he was done for. He scrambled to turn the tap on full blast to cover the sound of what he was about to do and freed his leaking cock from his pants. He wrapped a fist around his member, gasping at the contact. He hadn't been this oversensitive since his teens. Only a few strokes later, his climax overtook him, and then he was coming with a strangled cry, so hard that his chest felt like it was caving in and his vision whited out. Spurt after spurt struck the mirror with such force that he could hear the splatter even over the rushing water.
“Yep.” Again, a popped P.
“That we have,” I acknowledged, and waited again. There was more, I felt, that he needed to say.
“Indeed.”
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled as he smiled down at the man he loved. “Isn’t everything?”
“Well—”
“There you are,” said John, smiling. “Did I short out your hard drive?”
Greg turned from where he’d been pinning a photograph to the squad’s huge bulletin board and nodded in greeting. “Hey, Sherlock. Nice hat,” he smirked.
“It’s a three-cup problem,” John said doggedly, still staring up at him. “Get. Your own.” He raised the first cup to his lips and sipped, finally releasing Sherlock from that disconcerting gaze. It felt very much like being freed from one of those tractor beam things from
Sentiment had led him to make some dreadful life choices, Sherlock acknowledged. At those times in his life when he had sought out the oblivion of drugs, sentiment had always been at the root of it. And while he might claim that his drug use was for a case or an experiment or purely for recreation, and that he was a user rather than an addict, in some still, small part of himself, Sherlock knew that these were all rationalizations and that all addiction was the same. All addiction was about the management of emotion. Sherlock’s descents into drug use had always been the result of how he felt—lonely, bored, hopeless, bereft—and how few outlets he had had for those feelings. Friendless, and with only a disapproving older brother to turn to, there was no comfort to be had, even had Sherlock been willing to seek it. He had learned not to. People always left, but drugs were a constant—a distraction, a temporary way to calm his emotional turmoil.
John sat back in his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “At long last, recognition of my true talents.” He tipped his head with a cheeky grin. “I can die a happy man.” He jabbed an index finger in Sherlock's direction. "And you like my jumpers. Admit it."
. Hairy knuckles and meaty fingers on one, delicate wrist and fetching lavender nail varnish on the other, so one male, one female, clearly. Nicotine stains—the man was a smoker. Writing callus on the middle finger—the woman was left-handed. Another voice in his head, Mrs. Hudson’s this time, interrupted with, “Well, that wasn’t very good, was it?” No. No, it wasn’t. John wondered fleetingly if matters might have been improved had the hands been a matched set. Probably not, he decided, and fought down an entirely inappropriate urge to giggle. He cast about for something acceptable to say and settled on a misguided attempt to lighten the situation: “Ah...guess we’ll be needing extra soy sauce, then.”
, Sherlock reminded himself.
John hummed in response but didn’t shift his gaze.
“Oh, that.” John nodded and put a hand to his hip. “Yeah, came to a decision.”
Sherlock moved to the kitchen and came back, pressing a cold glass into his friend’s hand. John heard the clink of ice cubes. “Ice water,” he said.
I look over to where John has just come in with Rosie in his arms. Rosie catches sight of us and squeals with joy, nearly squirming right out of John's arms in her eagerness to reach us.
" shouted Sherlock, but his friend was unresponsive. He turned John's limp form until he could press two fingers to his neck. He located the carotid artery and was relieved to feel John's pulse there, elevated but strong. He gathered his friend up and gave a grunt as he stood. John was heavier than he looked, but fortunately for them both, Sherlock was stronger than
Sherlock groaned and closed his eyes as realization struck. Of course! "Remember what you always forget." He whirled back toward his chair, snatched up the laptop, and typed in 4-7-3-4. G-R-E-G. The computer opened itself to him like a morning glory to the dawn.
Sherlock whirled around, stabbing an accusing finger in the direction of the dish rack.
) sex together for the first (and second) time, Sherlock left John snoring gently in his bed and slipped out of the bedroom, mobile in hand.
John’s nightmares were almost always to do with the war, or at least they began that way before his subconscious introduced the horror of the moment. Sometimes Sherlock could head the dreams off by playing his violin; other times he would simply provide companionship when John eventually stumbled downstairs, bleary-eyed and disoriented, to spend the remainder of the night drinking tea and watching mindless telly. John never talked about his dreams, and Sherlock never asked. Yet he felt—he hoped—that his presence was of some comfort to John on those nights.
“We don’t know where the crime scenes are. All we have are the photos of the bodies that someone—presumably the killer—helpfully posted to Scotland Yard. Right into the Major Crimes Division inbox.”
“If I may, Detective Inspector—” Mycroft said, holding out the bags of takeaway. “I do have enough here for everyone.”
“—how long after that did it take you to—” John tipped his head back, tapping a forefinger to his chin as he made a show of searching his memory. “—how did you put it that time—oh, yes. ‘Blow your load?’ Hmm?” He tilted his head, waiting for the answer.
Sherlock clicked on the browser icon and discovered that no further sleuthing was required: John had helpfully left the tab open and the video cued up. Sherlock slid the playhead back to the start, took a breath, and clicked play.
Now it was Greg’s turn to lean in. He bent down, bringing his mouth to Irene’s ear, and whispered something to her. Whatever he said caused her to stiffen and draw back sharply. “I see!” she said. “How very vulgar.” Then her eyes twinkled and she gave a coquettish shrug. “But then, if that’s the sort of thing you like, who am I to argue?” She smiled and took a step back, and Mycroft lowered his umbrella. “I’ll be going, then.”
“Bloody
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I don’t have all night, Lestrade, so could we please get on with it?”
Forty minutes later, the freshly showered duo, with Cath’s directions in hand, climbed into their hired car and headed out.
And lastly, a word of warning: This chapter contains mentions of teens being held prisoner for sex trafficking purposes. However, there is nothing graphic, and the teens are rescued before anything bad happens to them.
Sadly, Mrs. Hudson’s plan to broker peace through the judicious allotment of carbohydrates never came to pass. The following day, Mycroft called in a favour, and a grumbling Sherlock was despatched to Brussels on a dull but time-consuming case that kept him away from London for more than a month. Peace and harmony reigned again at 221B, and John took advantage of this Sherlock-free interlude to begin the relationship whose demise would drive the final nail into the coffin of his dating aspirations.
By this time the ambulance carrying Eric had raced away and the baby had been taken into the care of the police until her remaining family could be contacted. She was too young to be aware of her mother’s body being zipped into a black bag and loaded into the back of a coroner’s van.
. Where was John’s laptop? He scrambled into the living room, twisting wildly about as he scanned the room for the computer. It was nowhere to be found. Of course not—John had had it upstairs last night. Sherlock took the stairs three at a time, skidding to a stop in front of John’s door, and erupted into the room. His eyes went first to the desk. There was no laptop on it, but the virulent green dildo sat proudly front and centre, as though mocking him. Dresser next, but same result (minus the dildo). Floor around the bed, ditto. What had John done with it? Sherlock threw open the wardrobe doors, shoving clothes and sundries aside, but found nothing. He went back to the desk and pulled the drawers open, rifling through the contents, but it wasn’t there, either. Twisting back around, he finally spied a corner of the laptop protruding from beneath the stack of pillows on John’s bed. That was certainly an odd place to put a laptop, but Sherlock dismissed the thought with a shake of his head. He’d puzzle it out later. The important thing was that he had found what he was after.
The roof of the adjoining building, where Sherlock stood, was a storey lower than the one where John was, accounting for Sherlock’s disappearance from view. John made out the sprawled form of Mulroney, flat on his back, arms splayed, blood on his face. And there was Sherlock, turned back toward John now, breathing hard and looking up at him. Some part of him knew that he should be getting down there with Sherlock, standing over Mulroney at least, to make sure he didn’t regain consciousness and try any more shenanigans. But another part of him was hearing a distant echo of his own voice.
THE PIN IS INCORRECT. TRY AGAIN.
“Well, that’s really not saying much, given the paltry—”
John’s phone rang again and was ignored, because John was stroking Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock was breathing a low litany of
“Talk,” I said, smiling. “To her, or to me. She told me the same thing. Only it’s drugs in my case, of course.”
Mycroft slapped his hands down on his thighs. “Well, time to be going, I think.” He stood and collected his umbrella. “Now that my concerns have been allayed, I’ll leave you to your business.”
Sherlock was fuming. “Let me guess,” he hissed. “Another
“Leaving yourself open like that. Careless. Good way to get hurt, or worse.”
?” Donovan yelped, mouth agape. “You’re
“Case?” John asked.
“Yeah?” John asked with a grin that put the sun to shame.
“What do you need, Sherlock?”
“Got it in one. We’re setting up a task force—my team, Fergus here, the two of you, and any members of your homeless network willing to work with us. The goal is first and foremost to find the missing kids, of course, but secondarily to infiltrate Lester’s operations and find a way to take him down. If you’d like to follow Shankley, we can join the rest of the team in the incident room and get things rolling.” He gestured to the door and the other three men exited, Lestrade following in their wake.
“Ah. Didn’t realize I was saying that out loud,” John said as he began making for the door. “And it’s not a who, it’s a what.”
“But you were married to a woman!” Donovan exclaimed.
,” Sherlock finished savagely. “Sitting on our dish rack. Where the clean dishes go!”
“I don’t understand you, John. All this time, all these months, leaving sex toys all over the flat, getting off to
“Such ferocity, Dr. Watson!” Irene twinkled. “Don’t worry, he’s all yours.” She turned away, switching her focus to Greg.
“No.”
Rosie had evidently not been sleeping well, because she was currently screeching loud enough to raise several demons from the abyss. Sherlock took the stairs two at a time, not worrying about the racket he was producing. The chances of Mrs Hudson and John sleeping through this squalling were not just improbable; it was impossible.
She sighs and nods, finally allowing John to walk past her and out of the shop. John can’t stop looking at her, even as he steps out, when he has to walk backwards just to keep his eyes on her. Finally, he forces himself to turn.
“He’s your brother?” John blurts before he can stop himself, the thought leaving his mouth as it comes into his head.
“That’s not what I asked. Are you both happy?”
“Why?” he can’t help but ask.
Mrs. Hudson shrugs.
.) late at night, all guise and poise lost in his desperate thrusts into her (or him), all deductions gone from his lips except for the repeated syllables of his lover’s name, until even that is lost as he climaxes and cries out in his frenzy?
The man twirls his umbrella. "I can assure you, I don't wish to harm Sherlock Holmes, or you,” he states, his voice still a sinister purr. "In fact, I've got a proposition that will be particularly advantageous for you."
A long, mournful chord pulls John from his sleep that night. For a moment, he hasn’t any idea what’s going on, until it changes, forming a slow melody, one that almost aches to listen to.
Sherlock huffs, giving John another
My first glance reveals that I am up against a wall, with a metal locker in front of me. Given that it is crooked in its alignment, and taking into account the dark scratches on the floor, it seems it has been moved from against the wall. I shuffle to my feet, and survey the rest of the room.
“What is it?” John asks.
“I’m going to fucking kill you,” John mutters, looking up at Sherlock. “Putting our lives at risk over art?”
What on earth does Sherlock Holmes do for a living?
Yet it all comes crashing down again with a text from Greg.
A sudden gasp escapes from Sherlock, causing John to jump. The detective whirls on his feet, and he’s suddenly gone, with thundering footsteps down the stairs.
But what can he say? How can he tell Sherlock that he’s going to be meeting the love of his life soon, and so this will have to stop?
“Er, of course,” John nods, not used to all eyes being on him. “They usually deal with sensitive hostage situations, or if there’s information we would need for espionage, they’d go into enemy headquarters and try to steal any files or artifacts.”
Interesting, but not important. I continue digging. She has to have something edible in here, even a rotten apple core would do. I can feel tears prickling in my eyes in desperation and frustration as I search. I wonder absently how the hell someone is able to live without throwing
, John realises as he makes his way up the stairs. How stupid would that be, for him to make this trip and nearly have a heart attack, only for Sherlock to be off with some new case.
When it nears the time John promised to be in by, Sherlock remembers his relation to Penelope. The two of them waiting expectantly for their love to return home, feeling almost hopeless.
“I didn’t make you do anything, John.”
. It’s just John. Because Sherlock doesn’t need a game, when he wishes to know something, he simply looks for it, and finds it.
They gnash at each other’s lips and tongues, both trying to gain control, but what John has in muscle mass and ability, Sherlock has unbridled angry energy, and he soon has John pinned, with no option except to bite at Sherlock’s lip.
God, John is already hard, and Sherlock seems to be too. He tangles his fingers through the man’s curls, only for his hand to be snatched and pinned to the bed. The detective’s right hand, however, remains on the bed, where he instead supports himself with his elbow, and in the back of his mind John remembers how hard he hit the table.
What have they done?
Sherlock finally does relent after far too long, and climbs on top of John. He stares into John’s eyes as he pushes himself inside of him, and it suddenly is far too much, and John struggles to catch a breath.
The flat is messy and disorganized, full of old books that seem like they had some category, but John can’t figure out what that is. Probably the best way to describe Sherlock’s mind, he thinks to himself as he glances back to the doll-man, who currently was fixing some flaw in the curtains that he couldn’t see either.
A part of John’s heart aches for whatever Sherlock had had to deal with before. Some people didn’t seem to see the majesty that John saw, maybe.
,’ because he feels it would disappoint John.
There are
He grimaces finally. “I have to go…” he confesses.
John raises an eyebrow, and is about to ask why Sherlock thinks that he alone has the skillset to capture a man whose entire job description is evasion, but then he catches sight of something in the corner of his eye.
“John?” he furrows his brows, and sets the mug aside as he stands up. His gaze turns analytical, and John lets him figure out everything important. It will save him the story, after all.
Now, however, he takes the time to really consider it. Dark hair, he thinks. Tall. Slender. He’d like her to have curves, hips, breasts, but he liked the smaller, more subtle feminine forms as well.
“What? Pardon?” Lestrade asks, blinking in surprise.
Three aisles over, in the desserts section, a young girl lies sprawled on the ground. A small crowd is beginning to form around her, panicked voices rising.
Greg nods slowly, lifting his arm to look at his monitor. “So we need to look for any convicts with a background in that section of the army.”
He was an asshole. The biggest one John had ever met. Yet there was something about his smirk and the way his voice glided over his deductions that made John’s knees weak. They got along so well, the two of them. They would be Soulmates, surely, if only…
ask don’t go through.
“Yep, looks like you’ve sprained a few ligaments,” John murmurs, shaking his head. “Maybe next time you break your hand, don’t have sex immediately after, yeah?”
. Blunt force, most likely, a sharp object would have created a concentrated area of pain. No other considerable cranial injury, or at least not so far.
“Men aren’t supposed to be together, it’s wrong, it’s not how nature is supposed to work!” John insists. “How could it be normal?!”
“Smells delicious,” He purrs.

John stares as the pixels fade into a 6 on the minute count. One minute closer.
running along the thick pipeline of lights. The pipe and wires look fraught and pulled as well.
Now it’s too high, he can’t see himself. Perhaps if he flips it…
“... You still believe that nonsense, don’t you?” he says in shock.
“Also,” he continues, “are you
things like John’s limp, occupation, personal qualms (although he had mistaken Harry to be his brother), even things John didn’t know (Was Harry really an alcoholic?), would have to be crazy.
As John  tucks his shoulders into the blanket, he’s so close, Sherlock wonders what would happen if he kissed him. He allows himself to tuck his head into John’s shoulder, for just a moment.
They sit in silence, Moriarty pretending to glance about the dining room, while John tries very hard not to think about the fact that he is sitting across from one of the most effective terrorists in the entire State.
they beeped when--
“Because, for starters, he’s not a
Admittedly, John doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about, but his rumbling baritone is a nice soundtrack to their walk.
After lunch, which was served in the adjacent dining room, the group was scattered throughout the house. Sherlock received a folder that contained the schedule of their week, as well as what he guessed were questionnaires. John managed a peek – it seemed like they would have a busy time. Individual sessions, group sessions, afternoon activities... how on Earth they'd have enough time to conduct an investigation here under cover was beyond him.
Mycroft inclined his head with an oily smile. “Do not do yourself too much of a disservice. It is not your brain that will be needed, Doctor. It is your affectionate tolerance for my little brother. I dare say it’s a skill only one man in the entire world possesses.”
“Well, I suppose she could join the Yard. Not when she’s grown up, either. She just needs to learn how to walk properly and she’ll be good to go. Her observation skills already surpass those of Anderson. I’ll give her a month before she surpasses Donovan.”
before they were next.
Was he imagining it, or was there the faintest blush rising on the detective’s cheeks?
“Alright. Okay. I – um… having said all that, some things are… not so great.”
“Has it occurred to
“You just go and get ready.” John said exasperated as he nudged him towards the shower. Then, as Sherlock passed, John implored the nanny:
So the wallpaper was hung and historically accurately graffitied, the armchairs and table and rug all cleaned up and carefully positioned to make an echo of their past. There, a tribute to the simpler times.
Mycroft turned primly in the chair, addressing the doctor. “People
“Oh… right.” A few pauses. “Maybe we’d have to kiss.”
“Fine. Then I’ll dry off.” His roommate replied as he swooped down and searched the lower cupboards for a towel.
John looked wrecked, he noticed. It tugged at his heartstrings. An unfamiliar feeling when it came to anyone else, but John was, as ever, the ineffable exception. The doctor was rocking his daughter softly, muttering soft words of love and reassurance at her. He looked exhausted, as he often did these days. Clad in pyjama pants and a shirt, hair tousled from what must have been only a short, interrupted nap, Sherlock wanted nothing more than to hold him close and mutter some of those same words to him. He refrained.
“We should think of a cover story. When we got together, what our relationship is like and such.”
The sun might’ve rose and set again, he didn’t know, but eventually John pulled back.
Mycroft settled himself into John’s chair, resting his ever-present umbrella against the side. “Both of you, in fact. Together, you possess a unique skill set that will be vital in the investigative process.”
Reality settles in. Reluctantly.
to ignore the fact that their hands touched. John was warm from sleep still. He cradled Rosie close and swayed back and forth.
“O…kay.” The therapist stammered, making a note with a shaking hand. “Thank you for being open with me. Let’s let this sink in a bit and end our session here.”
“Your daughter is easily amused.” The nanny remarked with an easy smile.
“Well,” he muttered, meeting his gaze. “she’ll have to get in line. There’s only one consulting detective in the world and he’s taken.”
Soft, warm lips descended upon his and his mind went blank. It was… it was transcendent. Every thought and worry quieted instantly as all his senses directed to this moment, this one perfect moment between them. John’s lips moved gently against his and he moved with him, not knowing how he knew what to do. It was a chaste kiss, just feeling and caressing. Instinctively, he pressed back a bit firmer, wanting, needing. A hand came up to his cheek, calloused yet soft. Sherlock whimpered. He felt simultaneously completely overwhelmed and utterly at peace. His brain wasn’t working. All he knew was that they should keep kissing, definitely press their lips together again and again, breathing each other’s breaths…
“Ta, you tit.”
Sherlock paused, then looked him up and down critically. “Perhaps you would benefit from some sleep. Rosie has kept you up four nights in a row now. I prefer my blogger well-rested.” He buttoned up his coat before sending him a small smile.
The drawing room of the house was a cosy and comfortable space, housing several sofas and love seats around a large fireplace. Other couples were already present and John did not fail to note that his best friend was analysing every single one of them. John took the more personal approach and introduced themselves to some of the others. There would be five more couples, aside from them. He just casually chatted with some of the people, giving Sherlock plenty of opportunity to make his own deductions. No doubt he’d shortly be regaled with all the sordid details of their fellow house-guests.
“Started promising.” He whispered back, eager for a change of topic. “Followed two leads, came up empty. I thought they might all have affairs in common, but only two of the victims have had, as Miss Young so eloquently put it, a
“Think we can keep that up for seven days?”
John was the first to broach the topic again.
He pretended not to hear the muffled snicker behind him when he bumped into the door jamb on his way out.
. He didn’t want to look up and watch John. What if John was glad the moment didn’t happen? He couldn’t bear that if he saw that -
Mrs Hudson permitted herself entrance to the flat, trailed by stiff-looking Mycroft Holmes. Sherlock all but hissed and flung himself away from the kitchen counter, stalking to the sofa.
John shook him from his gloomy ruminations. “So, did Mabel Young give any good leads?”
? Was his breath okay? When did he brush his teeth last? Oh god, John’s face was really close now. Should he tilt his head left or right? Where did his nose go? How did people kiss again? He’d done that before, he just needed to get to his Mind Palace quickly to gather some information, he was not prepared, oh god
It was a little after two in the morning when Sherlock stood up and stretched, popping his spine in what must have been a very satisfying feeling, but ultimately disgusting sounding cracks.
“Both of you are behaving like children. Six people are missing, three of which are my agents. My agents do
.” He snapped as he dropped down on it gracelessly. They’d been having
Or was that just wishful thinking?
that John would move back into Baker Street. He still had his flat in the suburbs, the one he’d shared with Mary. It had been Mary’s place before John had moved in, and it still showed. Everything in the flat reminded him of
They’d managed to waffle on for quite a bit, mostly about how busy they were between their shared job, John’s job and caring for Rosie. But now that the big question was posed, they both felt on edge. This was where the difficult part would come in. The part where they’d lay out their differences and dissect them over the next few sessions.
“And you watched it.” It wasn’t a question. And no need to specify what
And lastly I cried for myself, for all the things I had had to do to keep my loved ones safe. I had lied and hurt and killed for them, and I would do it all again if need be, but the cost weighed heavy on my soul.
“Flesh. Light,” John supplied with exaggerated enunciation.
Sherlock tossed the photo aside and held up the next. “And you went over this one?”
The scene switched to two clothed men, kissing on a bed. Both were young, one blond and smaller, the other taller and dark-haired. The darker man’s face was turned away as he lavished kisses on the smaller man’s neck. The camera angle changed as the men kissed and caressed each other on the bed, and Sherlock gulped as he caught sight of the dark-haired man’s face for the first time. These two could be himself and John, if they had met in uni. Sherlock hit pause to give himself time to digest the implications. Clearly this was not just any random gay porn video. This was two men who were doppelgängers for himself and John, albeit ten to 15 years younger. This was two men whose sexual escapades had brought John to an explosive climax under Sherlock’s very eyes. Sherlock gulped and clicked play again.
John’s eyebrows shot up. “Everything and every moment?” He smiled. “That...could take a while.”
“John?” Sherlock whispered.
John looked up at that, startled, and smiled. “I was sure you would have deleted it.”
“Which you conveyed quite effectively,” Mycroft acknowledged with a small smile. “What exactly did you say to her to make her reverse course so quickly?”
Now thoroughly unnerved, Sherlock snapped his laptop shut and said, “Well, I’m off to bed. Later.”
He’d got it wrong, then.
Sherlock held his breath for a moment, then released it with an involuntary sound that could only be described as a squeak. He clapped a hand over his mouth. What the hell was the matter with him? One glimpse of a dick and suddenly he was blushing and moaning like a schoolgirl? Only it wasn’t just any dick. It was
” I said.
” Sherlock breathed once John was gone. He sank down onto the closed toilet lid, head in hands. At first he had been delighted that John was forgoing romantic relationships, but now he was beginning to think John’s new focus was coming at too high a price. But what was he supposed to do about it? Tell John to go out and get a leg over with some insipid female? Unacceptable. Tell him to move out? Of course not. Ridiculous. He needed John. Nothing was any good without him. John kept him right. But John was currently also bent on driving him mental, and quite thoroughly, too. There didn’t seem to be any ready solution to this quandary.
“Glad you like it,” Jen smiled as she set a bag on the bed. “Listen, there’s this French restaurant two villages over. Little place, middle of nowhere, looks like nothing much from the outside, but their chef is a sodding genius. It’s so mobbed that you can’t get near the place most nights. The waiting list for reservations is almost two months long. But...we make standing reservations there every few weeks for our guests. You two could have tonight’s slot if you’d like? It’s at half 7.”
“Bloody hell,” John muttered as he and Sherlock picked themselves up. “I hope you’ve got the fifty quid you promised him, because I am
Sherlock rolled his eyes. John chuckled and reached for the door handle. “Like it or not, you’re famous now...
Sherlock glanced down at the computer, then back at John before lowering his gaze. “Obviously,” he said, lifting his chin. Somehow the usual arrogant tone he was striving for was failing him just now.
“John!” Sherlock exclaimed. He looked about him, getting his bearings. The light in the room had changed, and a fire was burning in the hearth. He and mind-palace John really
Sherlock surveyed the room, as well, and breathed a sigh of relief. He looked back at John, whose silver and gold hair gleamed in the firelight from the hearth. Sherlock smiled softly. “Yes, I found it. Thank you, John.”
, John!”
The woman’s baby was still screaming from the push chair, which was lying on its side on the pavement a couple of metres away; a small crowd was gathering around the wailing infant. “Don’t touch the push chair!” John shouted. “Let me through, please.” He moved to the chair and crouched down. The baby was still securely fastened into the seat, apparently unharmed, arms and legs waving as she howled her outrage. The crying and movement were excellent signs, and the baby carrier’s handle was in the correct position, serving as a roll bar to protect her from the impact. John carefully righted the push chair, placing a gentle hand on the infant’s belly and shushing her out of habit. He lifted the blanket that partly covered her, then carefully unfastened the carrier's chest straps and raised her tiny shirt so he could see her abdomen. There was no outward sign of injury, and the abdomen was soft. His gentle palpation didn’t seem to produce any discomfort, and she already seemed to be calming. Frightened rather than hurt, most likely. Just to be sure, he used the torch on his mobile to check her pupils. Equal and reactive. All good. He gently refastened the carrier straps.
The case came to a head on Shankley’s third visit to the den. Sherlock, John, and Lestrade’s crew were stationed all through the area, ready to move in at a moment’s notice. Shankley was taken inside for a special meeting with Lester; everyone knew what that meant, and they were all on high alert. The officers all had radios, of course, but Sherlock had taken the additional precaution of procuring tiny earpieces for himself, John and Shankley so they could keep in constant contact and hear everything going on inside the den. The earpieces were small enough to escape notice and would eliminate the need for Shankley to wear a wire.
Sherlock pressed a hand to his groin, closing his eyes and surrendering to the memory. He replayed the scene in John’s room last night, picturing himself bursting into the room, seeing again the way John’s cock had jutted up as he stroked it, heard the wet sounds as his slicked-up fist pumped it from root to tip until—
John smiles at me then, and it is my favourite smile of his, soft and full of love, kindling that beautiful inner light in his eyes. It's the same smile he gives Rosie when the tenderness wells up in him. He steps up to me, then, and I don’t know which of us moves first or if we move in unison, but John’s arms come around me and mine about him, and I rest my cheek on his hair, breathing in his scent. He holds me with infinite gentleness, as though I am something precious and breakable. As though he is holding my heart. We stand there like that for a moment that stretches into minutes, just breathing and drawing comfort, until Rosie awakens, crying. "I'll get her," John says, and releases me with a gentle smile. I immediately miss his warmth and the scent of him, but I smile back. He squeezes my arm with one hand and goes up to fetch our Rosie.
“Like what?” Anderson gritted out.
Over the next couple of hours, he and John put the wing to rights, and in the process Sherlock reviewed his every recollection of himself and John together as acquaintances, then flatmates, then friends, looking for any clue, any indication that John was anything but straight, that they could maybe, possibly become something more. Their every moment together was scrutinised through this new lens.
Sherlock very nearly manhandled John out of the building. He was vibrating again as he stood on the pavement, imperiously raising a hand to hail a cab. The cabbie spotted him, indicated, and began pulling over, and Sherlock paced impatiently as he waited. He stilled abruptly, though, as he felt John’s hand snake into his. He looked down at his companion in astonishment. “Is this something we do now?” he asked, raising their joined hands. “Hold hands in public?”
Several hours later, Sherlock blinked his way back to wakefulness. He sat up in bed, surprised to find himself still wearing his dress shirt and suit jacket. Well, it certainly wasn’t unheard of for him to fall into bed fully dressed after a long and exhausting case, but John usually saw to it that he at least stripped down to his underwear first. Never had he fallen into bed naked from the waist down, though. Odd. Then the recollection of the previous night’s events came flooding back—the case, the earpiece, the chain-reaction wanking. Sherlock groaned and flopped back down onto his pillows. How was he ever supposed to face John today, having seen what he’d seen last night and done what he’d done afterward?
What John witnessed next could only be described as the Sherlockian equivalent of the Windows blue screen of death: complete hard drive shutdown and reboot. Sherlock blinked rapidly for a few seconds, then didn’t. For a very long time. John was reminded of the day he’d asked Sherlock to be his best man, except this time the CPU was taking much longer to come back online. Was Sherlock’s chest even moving?
This was...
“You watched me do that,” said Sherlock. “You can see.”
“Ah, Lestrade,” Sherlock said, catching sight of Greg as he breezed into the fully staffed squad room. Apparently it was all hands on deck tonight despite the closure of the Lester case earlier that day. He nodded at Fergus Shankley, who raised his Costa coffee cup in salute, and resolutely ignored Anderson’s loud groan at the sight of him. Sherlock addressed Greg. “You’re looking more rested. Change of clothes, too. Awfully considerate of the Chief Super to order you home for a midday kip. Now, show me the photos.”
Sherlock thought back to the previous night, replaying events as they had occurred. As far as he could determine, John had remained unaware of Sherlock’s presence in his room, but
and John’s cock expressed its enthusiasm for the idea with a generous spurt of precome.
“SHERLOCK!” John thundered, then groaned as both his abraded throat and pounding head made their displeasure known. He put a hand to the back of his head, because that seemed a reasonable response to the sensation that one's skull was about to split open lengthwise. He continued, his voice quieter, hoarse but firm. “Stop and listen. Please.”
“Baker Street. One of my cars dropped him back there after the hospital. I’ve taken the liberty of contacting Mrs. Hudson’s sister, Doreen. She will see to the funeral arrangements.”
, John!”
I takes him two tries, but he manages a long, shaky breath.
“In here,” Sherlock growled, seething.
“And yet you failed to notice that the light striking the victim’s face is coming from an entirely different direction than the light striking her body?” He pointed to the relevant shadows around the victim’s body.
Shankley gave him an appraising look in turn and nodded. “Aye, I could see that. Hobbit isn’t really much of an insult, though. I mean, Hobbits are small but they kick arse when needed, don’t they? There’re worse things than bein’ a Hobbit.”
It was sheer bad luck that John was on a train home from Plymouth when it happened. The initial call from Mycroft had come when the train was still an hour out, and John had spent that time slowly losing his mind, repeatedly and fruitlessly texting Sherlock, then trying to reach Mycroft to find out the latest developments and getting no response. His battery charge had dwindled steadily, and his phone went dark just as the train pulled into Paddington.

John’s gaze softened. “That is
How wrong we both were about some things. And how much has changed.
“No, I don’t mean I know her personally. I mean I know
Earth-shaking?
“Cabs are hardly ten a penny here, John. I’ll be stranded here if—”
"Mmm." He nods. At last he asks unsteadily, “Where did you learn that?”
“Only one way to find out,” answered Sherlock, grinning.
Anderson’s eyes darted back and forth from the cup to the photo, mouth slackening as he realized what he was looking at. “But how—”

“Shall I take the dishes and things in?”
The cage descended slowly, coming to a stop with a jolt. The two men found themselves staring into a long corridor made of the same concrete as the cellar they had just left. It was narrow, dimly lit, and also entirely deserted. A cubbyhole in the wall to their right was filled with firearms, which explained the lack of weapons inside Lester's den. They exited the cage-lift and it immediately rose again, going back to fetch the two constables Greg was sending down.
