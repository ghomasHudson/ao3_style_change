This is too bizarre, too revealing of a dream. And yet he’s tempted to follow it, to let it unfold, to allow that strangely familiar palm to slide between his pliant legs, to cup his balls and half-hard cock, to stroke and coax him to a sleepy, sensual climax.
“Captain Watson.”
I took the glass. Sherlock was toying with the bandage on his arm.
“I was afraid…” John faltered, not sure he should say it.
“Um,” John fiddled with the door knob behind his back, “you were mumbling. I couldn't really understand.”
“Good, I’m glad.” Although Sherlock’s voice is calm, inside he’s leaping with joy. “We should exchange numbers so I can reach you.”
“The rent’s due first day of the month. No smoking inside, or if you must sneak one, do it by an open window. No parties -- unless you invite me, of course,” she winked, surprising John again. “I don't mind if you have overnight visitors, if you know what I mean. That's not my business. Live and let live, I say. Oh, and no pets, they make me sneeze.” She tapped her chin. “Let’s see. Did I forget anything?”
“John -- last night was --” he stumbled, regained his footing, “It was special… I make it a rule not to get involved, but I want to see you again.”
“Okay, off to bed with you.” John put a hand under his arm and hoisted him to his feet.
“It didn’t bloody get up and walk away,” Sherlock snaps.
**************
John stifles a giggle. “It could take hours to examine every little detail.”
Molly's voice carried up from the water. “Who wants something to eat?”
But here they were, together again, despite all odds. Fate, Mrs. Hudson had called it. Maybe she was right after all. He shouldn't waste the glimmer of a chance to finally mend their relationship.
“Everything alright?” Sherlock ventures.
John replays the strange series of events that has brought them to this candlelit room. He surreptitiously studies Sherlock’s half-hidden face, wondering what he's thinking.
John picked up another stone and turned it in his hands. “I suppose Hollywood sounds more glamorous than a logging town in Oregon.”
By the time we arrived at the emergency department, Sherlock was patched up and looking very disgruntled about the whole situation. He was perched on an exam table with his sleeves rolled up, his left hand cradling his bandaged forearm.
John, wounded but stubbornly proud, his eyes older than his years, his hair hinting at silver at the temples, his face rugged and more handsome with the passing years.
Their eyes were closed, oblivious to anything but each other, turning, perfectly in sync. Dad shifted, pulling back slightly to look up at Sherlock. Their eyes met and they gazed at each other, almost coming to a halt. Dad reached up to trace Sherlock's cheek with his fingertips, and they smiled softly, drawing together for a tender kiss, then resuming their slow swaying.
John took the jar, curious. “This is from your bees?”
It's been several weeks so far without physical contact. He's let the messages taper off, and, as of several days ago, go unanswered. It doesn't feel good, but stopping pleasurable things never does.
-- ” Sherlock never finished his sentence, his words obliterated by the intensity of the release rolling like a thunderclap through his body, creamy strands of come arcing onto his stomach and chest.
John shook his head in amusement, then climbed into the white carriage with a black canopy and plush red seat. The dappled horse sported a red plume of feathers between his ears.
The slow strokes soon grew faster, urgency overriding finesse. John grabbed Sherlock’s haunches, hauling him closer; Sherlock hiked his calves over John's shoulders, both bucking and clutching, panting and grunting, Sherlock's hand curling around his leaking cock, fist stroking.
“Hm? Yeah, sure,” John rubs a hand over his stubbly cheek, feeling a bit buzzed and blurry. “Interesting walk home.”
Sherlock was pleased that he remembered. “That’s probably what sparked my interest.”
The afternoon passed in a blur of activity, ending with the setting of appointments for additional fittings. It was agreed that John's suit would be finished by the end of the week, given his upcoming departure. Sherlock could return later as needed.
“I want you,” Sherlock murmured against John's mouth.
The dance ended, and Molly bounced over to them, a little out of breath, her eyes going wide when she saw Dimmock. “You're here!”
“You’re a million miles away in your head somewhere.”
“Oh, God, yes.”
Sherlock reached up, about to remove the chauffeur cap and toss it aside.
Everything he’d ever felt for John was still alive, burning brighter and truer despite seven missing years. To be here with him again like this, intimate, private, with no fear of prying eyes or impending separation looming over them, was a dream.
He looks up at her. “Sorry?”
“Oh, Sherlock,” Molly calls out, “before you go, could you do me one more favor?”
The sight of Sherlock's face contorted in ecstasy nearly sends John over the brink. He delves a hand down his pajamas, palms himself, stroking hard, and he's off -- hips jerking, come spilling over his fingers, a few creamy strands dribbling onto Sherlock's abdomen.
Sherlock scathingly rejected most clients, but every so often he'd accept a case. John couldn't discern a pattern to which requests for help Sherlock chose over others, but then he didn't really understand much about Sherlock anymore. There really were entire days he went without speaking, and others when he would not shut up.
“That's an unusual name.”
Oh god, I didn't want to think about it. I really, really didn't.
“Maybe.”
They stepped inside the studio, a bell jingling above the door. Soon a stout woman in her 30s emerged from the back of the store, wiping her hands on a towel. Sherlock caught the scent of chemicals used to develop prints.
It was glorious, melting under John’s mouth, pinned under the crush of his body.
He turned and walked away, already thinking about a stop at the butcher shop, when the door swung open. He stepped aside and nodded briefly at the familiar face. It was Mike Stamford, one of the physicians who allowed him access to the hospital lab. They were on friendly terms, though not precisely friends. “Mike,” he acknowledged.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” John asked.
More to come next week!
The laugh bubbles up deep from Sherlock’s chest, so rich and low and genuine that John can’t help but smile and giggle in return. Sherlock can’t even speak, his eyes teary with mirth. He adores this nugget of unexpected knowledge about John, finding it silly and somehow subversively sexy, the image of a vapid smiley face flexing with the tightening and relaxation of John’s
“We can forget this ever happened. I swear I’ll stay away from you, if you tell me to go,” John said earnestly. He raised his eyes once more to Sherlock’s. “But I'd like to see you again… if that's what you want.”
“Oh christ…”
“Sorry I'm late. Busy day.” John moves to the table, slides out a chair, and sits. He laces his fingers together. “How are you feeling?”
Sherlock slid the newspaper from under his mother's plate and quickly scanned the article for the facts: a male hiker in his 30s had been found dead in a meadow about three miles outside the village yesterday morning. A farmer had come across the body and summoned the local police. The name of the victim had not yet been released, pending positive identification and notification of next of kin. The police were not ruling out foul play, according to Police Constable Ian Dimmock.
-- person he'd ever met.
“Pleasure,” John managed to say in return. “What brings you to our little slice of hell?”
“Undoubtedly.”
John tries not to grin, then grows more serious. He grips Sherlock's hip, gives it a little shake. “Be more careful, will you?” he says earnestly, his eyes searching Sherlock's.
Several seconds went by, then John broke their gaze, taking a deep breath. “I'll just… move out of the way,” he muttered, pushing the door open and stepping out of the car.
“Shut the door.” Sherlock waved his hand. “So you survived the history of furnishings as told by my mother.”
“What about you?” Holmes asked. “Wife and kids back home?”
“Oh, I don't know… seeking penance for my sins?”
They inhaled simultaneously, waiting for a hidden signal. It came in the form of breaking glass, some drunk asshole shattering a beer bottle against the stone wall below.
John is used to living in two worlds at the same time. He pictures them like two circles in a Venn diagram. One is the public sphere -- his life with Olivia and Harry, the hospital and patients, homework and telly, the laundry and the shopping.
Sherlock drew back, his mouth hovering above John's, taunting, tantalizing. John found himself straining upwards, lifting on his toes, a thin groan for more slipping from his throat.
Chatter floated around me. Someone had abandoned a half-empty glass of white wine on a shelf, so I stealthily palmed it and took a drink with my back turned to the room. I glanced back. I didn't see my dad and no one seemed to notice me, so I grew bolder and took another swig. I grimaced at the sour taste, but finished the wine anyway.
Men milled by, passing between their line of sight. It was Sherlock who finally spoke first, calling to him across the room.
Something did go wrong one Friday evening when I was about 12 years old. We were at home, Dad reading a book and getting distracted by the show I was watching on TV. It was a crime thriller, and Dad would occasionally offer a critique.
He hadn't ventured near John’s house, their last meeting leaving him too muddled to know what to say. It was easier to avoid the situation rather than try to address it directly.
John sat on a wooden chair near the door, remaining at a distance as if not wanting to intrude. Sherlock began playing, focusing only on the music, not John’s rapt expression, not his hands resting on his knees, not his red bathing trunks and loose white shirt.
Sherlock was taken off guard, unsure if he should pretend not to understand her implication. He studied her a moment longer, then was certain that she knew the truth.
“Now,” Sherlock continued, “imagine a box in front of you. You're going to step into each corner of the box. Step forward with your left foot,” Sherlock pulled John gently, “then your right foot goes sideways to the right, yes, then bring the left foot together with the right -- ow!”
Nursing a pint, he read the first few chapters tucked at a table in a back corner. When a shadow fell across the page he looked up, John’s blue eyes warm in greeting.
She quickly looked down, flustered. “That's not -- I didn't mean -- oh, just go away.”
“Do try to get along,” Mrs. Holmes said dryly, reading his train of thought. “I dislike migraines.”
Sherlock smiles, flattered and a bit embarrassed. John is a talker, he's learning, bestowing compliments as he unwraps the gifts of Sherlock's body. John is an experienced lover. He is not.
“Is there anyone special in your life?” He hated the way the question sounded, cheap and prying.
“I had another obligation.” It's a transparent lie, but Molly just nods.
Sherlock smiles wickedly. “Oh, we're not done yet.” He bends down to nuzzle John’s neck, sliding his lips to his ear. “We’re just getting started.”
Together they unbuttoned John's shirt, slipped it from his shoulders, tugged away his shorts, the notepad sliding ignored to the floor. They clung together, John rolling Sherlock onto his back.
Sherlock's door abruptly opened and he strode into the room, stopping when he saw John staring at the card.
Prior to meeting John, such intimacy was not something he ever thought he'd enjoy, not a pastime he ever wasted a moment thinking about, but John had turned all of that on its head. There was an inexplicable chemistry between them that sent up sparks like a summer bonfire, burning away caution and reason.
It’s madness. He’s being seduced by a ghost.
“Goodbye, Olivia.” His voice was deep and serious, not that fake jolly tone so many adults use with kids. I was glad he never did anything annoying like ruffle my hair or chuck my chin.
I never saw them kiss. It wasn't anything as blatant as that. It was more like an invisible current, a magnetic pull that drew them together in small, powerful ways. Blink and you might miss it, the private smile, the hand resting between shoulder blades, the standing a bit too close together by the sink while putting away a few dishes.
“I'm leaving now,” he announced, exiting the room quickly before they could say anything else.
They still have not looked each other in the eye. John walks the few steps to the bathroom and fetches Sherlock’s dressing gown. He returns, draping it around Sherlock’s shoulders, his hands lingering on the lapels. Their gazes finally meet.
“So, like, the case called The Ghost Bride—”
John hesitated, glancing back at the house, then down at his feet as if wrestling with a decision. After a beat, he pulled open the door and got behind the wheel, taking a moment to familiarize himself with the controls. He put the car in reverse and backed up, then pointed the Vauxhaul away from town and toward the countryside.
Her eyes are wide, cautious.
“The joys of family,” Sherlock commiserated.
Sherlock hung back for a minute, catching John’s wrist. “Are you sorry I kissed you?”
“Let me sleep in your bed with you,” Sherlock breathed into John’s ear, bargaining for a way to let the night go on. “Just hold me, kiss me. We’ll keep our clothes on.”
He read the article again, mentally mapping the area where the body was found. Just then, Elizabeth returned.
John watches him, listening.
Their mouths and cheeks were pink from the burn of rough kisses, neck and shoulders reddened from contact. Sherlock smoothed his fingers across John's jaw, then let them play over the coarse stubble.
Sherlock grinned. “People love to have all the answers. I just led him to the ones we needed.”
Sherlock glanced up, his gaze going over John’s head. He realized Sherlock was looking at the mirror hanging behind him, examining the clientele in the pub. A few patrons were chatting, the barman cleaning glasses with a white cloth, a few others staring out the window or reading the paper. No one paid them any attention.
“Burning the candle at both ends,” Mrs. Hudson added over her shoulder. “Always dashing in and out, never sleeping.”
“You’re
“Hey.” Sherlock stepped into the kitchen, cautious. “Are you having someone over?”
They came almost simultaneously, John pressing his arse against Sherlock's hips, aching to take Sherlock’s cock even deeper. John's legs quaked, the strong arm looped around his chest holding him up as they rode out the last waves of their release.
“You look great,” John reiterated, still a bit stunned.
Sherlock's thighs are warm and firm against John’s, but this thought is soon replaced by the heat of Sherlock's hand curling around both of their cocks. God, he loves those enormous hands, but he may love the round ass perched on his knees even more. Actually, he can't decide, because Christ, that hand is moving in enticing ways.
“We’ve released no public update on your condition. An internet rumor seems to have sprung up in the absence of information.”
Mycroft pursed his lips. “You're 27 years old, Sherlock. It's time you grew up.” He opened his mouth, about to say more, then resisted. He shook his head and vanished down the stairs.
He scratches a word into the frost with his fingernail, tiny crystals sparkling as they fall. Sherlock gazes at his message, homesick.
Mycroft scrutinized the glowing tip of his cigarette. “You two seem very close.”
“Warmer?” John asks, brushing his fingers through the coarse hair on Sherlock’s chest.
John shoots a guilty glance at Sherlock. “I suppose I deserve that,” John mutters. He lowers his head and continues to rub his neck as if it pains him. “I haven't been sleeping well,” he finally says.
He turns to face John again, knowing he'll have to leave soon, that this intimate interlude will end, as they always have to. He runs a finger over the top of John's hand that's relaxed on the bed, tracing the winding track of one bluish vein.
Mr. Holmes placed his jar on the table and screwed off the lid, then handed Sherlock a teaspoon. “Have a taste,” he encouraged.
John followed Sherlock upstairs, the wooden steps worn smooth and polished by decades of use. A savory scent reached his nose as they entered the sitting room, something cooking in the oven.
After a few more awkward moments of silence, John got to his feet. “I think I’ll go for walk.”
Two plates heaped with a full breakfast steamed on the table. Mrs. Hudson, it seemed, had just popped in with one of her delicious fry-ups that she often spoiled them with.
Lying on his back again, he guided Sherlock between his thighs, anticipation making his blood sing, his hard prick standing at attention.
“Lie still. The pain meds should be kicking in again any moment now.” Mycroft reassures him. “It’s on a timer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mr. Holmes rubbed at a stubborn spot. “So, what are your plans for today?”
He misjudged it. He chides himself for thinking John might relax here, that they might have time to talk. Alone, they might finally --
“Hey.” John tipped up his chin. “We still have time. We have the rest of summer. We’ll have Rome.”
Sherlock quickly slid onto the seat beside John. He leaned forward to speak to the driver through a lowered partition. “The hotel, Wiggins. And take your time.”
John scoots forward, balanced on the edge of his chair, his hands moving up to cup Sherlock’s face. Although the angle is awkward, their mouths soften, explore, tasting of chocolate and red wine.
Sherlock hesitated, unsure.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, it's fine."
“Are you any good?”
His fingers trailed along the inner cut of the lapel down to the button, fixing the line of the jacket with a gentle tug.
“I don’t know, I might change it again,” John says, hunching back into the newspaper.
He jumped when he suddenly felt a flick on his neck.
“Oh, dear,” Molly murmured, then tried to intervene. “He does that. Don't be mad.”
The train swayed, slowing as it clacked and clattered along the switches that led into the station. John looked across at Sherlock, sharing a private glance charged with anticipation. They were finally arriving in London.
Sherlock didn't bother to reply. He unlocked his door and stepped into the quiet darkness of his room, relieved to be alone.
Subdued, Sherlock looked to where John had disappeared into the trees. Perhaps he should apply his father's advice to other situations as well.
They'd finally moved in together just over a year ago.
She slowly shakes her head. “I don’t think it wants to hurt us. I think it — he — wants to be acknowledged.”
” John snapped impatiently. “The Woman. Irene Adler.”
I turned over onto my other side.
Now he had to say something. “I was in the army until just recently. Stationed in India. I was a doctor.”
Maybe it was foolish, crushed up against the wall, groping, wanting to touch everywhere, kissing breathlessly. Maybe it was a desperate bid to recreate the past, falling into bed, half undressed, John astride him. Maybe it was a hopeful grasp at the future, John’s familiar taste curled on his tongue, their bodies entwined. Or maybe it was just now, just enough, to be tangled together in the sheets again.
They gaze at each other solemnly, weighing the implications of this exchange. John slowly rises to his feet, stands on the bottom step, eye to eye with Sherlock. John's hand flexes into a fist, a sign Sherlock recognizes as stress.
He was sleeping better and reading the daily paper again, gradually re-engaging with the wider world. When Mrs. Hudson brought up potential clients to confer with Sherlock, John began taking notes to keep track of people's stories, fascinated by their bizarre and mundane complaints that ranged from mischievous ghosts to missing dogs, suspected affairs and arson, to poisonings and stolen paintings.
He raised the oars and rested for a moment, letting the boat drift. He watched Molly trail her hand in the water, apparently lost in her own thoughts. He admired how the sunlight played over her glossy hair and slender arms, and noticed a faint tan line forming just above her elbow where her forearms peeked out beneath her sleeves.
Wasn’t knowing stuff the whole point of being an adult?
“Pop quiz?” Sherlock asked after a long silence.
This time Sherlock broke into a grin. “Seventy is much more reasonable than 85.”
“You should’ve had the tea,” Sherlock advises weakly.
Sherlock was silent for a few seconds. “Not exactly. It's complicated. But I needed to access your photos from yesterday’s demonstration.”
He wove his way over to Holmes, who was sitting on one of the mismatched sofas in a corner, observing the room.
He holds the razor in his hand, immobile, a lump forming in his throat. He blinks rapidly, trying not to fall apart. He inhales shakily, then exhales, clutching the sink. John wouldn’t want him to be like this, broken and adrift. He’s got to carry on, live his life, daring to hope that someday, somewhere…
John went silent, unable to counter Sherlock's observation.
He plodded up the stairs, exhausted, kicked off his shoes and peeled off his coat, tossing it carelessly over a chair. He headed straight to the sofa and fell onto it, curling up on his side so his knees jutted into the back cushions.
And yet there’s a wall between them, a line he’s terrified to cross. Beyond that line is a quagmire of emotions and desires that he’s afraid will drown him. It would frighten Sherlock away if he ever got close enough to peer into John’s eyes and see the truth.
They finally paused to devour the spicy red curry and crisp white wine, their faces flushed, their skin warm and yielding when the touching began again. It was still so new, this permission to graze and taste lips and throats and shoulders, to unbutton and unbuckle, to slide hands in private places.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, not understanding, and John told him about his plans for the RAMC in the autumn.
whispered around in his skull, refusing to be quelled.
“I wonder when the water will be warm enough for a swim,” Molly mused idly. They both watched the sun sparkle on the lake. “It's okay,” she added softly, “to like to be alone.”
She looks at him evenly. “You might want to try it someday.” She glares at his shoes. “And get your feet off my desk.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Eyes locked with Sherlock's, John bent down, extended his tongue, and licked. Sherlock inhaled sharply, and sharper again when John's mouth engulfed the head of his cock, a sensation round and silken hot.
“I'd like that.”
*************************
“Not at all. And you are invited as my guest, per my parents’ request. There's even a new suit in it for you.”
Sherlock nodded quietly, not sure how to respond, so he said nothing. They eventually headed back to the house.
“Same,” John smiles, sinking down in the pillows to find Sherlock’s mouth, his fingers cradling his jaw, their lips meeting a gentle caress.
“Why are we stopping?” John had been dozing with his head against the window of the hired Land Rover, catching up on sleep after a late night. They were in the middle of nowhere, drowsy afternoon sun slanting across fields lined with neat rows of flowering fruit trees. Apples, probably.
He watched her more closely, noticing a detail he'd initially missed. He decided to wait to mention it. He opened the door and walked over to her bike. “Hop in. I’ll give you a ride home.”
John stood on the step in front of the heavy black door, hesitating. He held the note from Mike Stamford that a messenger boy had delivered to his bedsit that morning and doubled-checked the address scrawled on the paper against the numbers tacked onto the lacquered wood. He had a hard time believing an affordable flat could be found in this part of the city.
John led him to the sofa and sank down into the corner, pulling Sherlock after him. “Lie down,” John murmured, placing a pillow across his lap. “Let's just enjoy the fire.”
Sherlock’s hands still as he absorbs John’s words. He looks up, finally making the connection. He remains wordless, trying process the fact that John just referred to him as beautiful.
Reality is a subjective word. His head swims, trying to grasp how time might bend and fold, disobeying linear concepts; how lives might repeat again and again, echoing through the centuries.
***********************
“They’re often connected,” Sherlock responded without elaborating. He took a sip of beer, noting how John regarded him for a long moment until he turned to Molly.
A look flashed across her face like she was going to say something else, but then she smiled and bumped her shoulder into mine. “Yeah, of you.”
“We could make a pot of tea and discuss the terms, if you’d like.”
At some point they traded places, Sherlock sinking into the mattress under John's weight, their mouths hot and urgent.
He really didn't mind. He liked sitting here, the two of them, not rushing, just at home together. He enjoyed it, being with Sherlock, sparring with him, watching his expressive eyes, the slow smile that crept across his face that made him feel like the most important person in the world. He coveted those moments, would chase and fight and shoot and argue and cook and leave all the Lauras and Sarahs behind for those unguarded grins from Sherlock.
He looks at me with those piercing eyes and doesn’t answer, turns to the door, clips down the steps.
“And you ought to remember Occam's Razor: the simplest answer is often correct.”
He skimmed through the previous day's paper while the kettle boiled, then finally sat down with his plate of toast and mug of tea. He took a cautious sip, the tea sweet and strong, followed by a bite of warm bread and berry jam.
I thought back to when Dad and I had finally talked openly about their relationship. Sherlock had told him about our rooftop conversation, so there was no hiding it anymore. It was strained at first, and Dad was obviously uncomfortable.
John cleared his throat. “This summer…” he started, “was not what I thought it was going to be.” He looked at Sherlock. “It was so much more than I could have hoped for. I’ll never forget it.”
John sees the storm in Sherlock’s face and places a hand on Sherlock’s knee, trying to steady them both. “Tell me,” he whispers back.
“I haven't expressed,” Sherlock’s voice was strained, “what you mean to me."
Instead, there is a cup of tea placed quietly on the side table, a long glance up from a screen, a soft ‘You okay?’ This is how they track each other, never pressing for answers, always close by but not hovering, waiting patiently for the shadows to retreat.
Sherlock stalled, his gaze traveling down the length of John's body. They came to rest on John's flaccid penis. It was difficult to imagine it had been inside him last night, veined and rigid.
“You're most welcome.” She smiled once more, then turned back to her papers, uncapping her pen. “And have John measured for a new suit as well. A doctor needs a decent suit,” she added offhandedly.
John sat down on the mattress, heavy with disappointment. He really had no right to feel this crushed. It was a one-night stand, nothing more, he reasoned. A lusty, sex-fueled night together with barely any words exchanged.
In addition to cooking and cleaning, these are the useful and not necessarily legal skills my father had taught me by the age of 18:
They started reflexively at the sound of breaking glass, heads jerking up, muscles tensing, staring at each other for cues to action. As the burst of adrenaline faded, they smiled, suddenly a bit shy.
“Can we go now?” I pleaded.
Sherlock contemplates this as he pours two cups of coffee (John's preferred brand, a roast darker than Sherlock really cares for, but he makes an exception for John).
“Liv, I'm fine,” he said again, this time softly. “I could never move without you. This is our home. You're my daughter. You're the most important person in the world to me.” His voice almost broke, and he blinked a few times, then tried to smile. “You can't get rid of me that easily. Not for a little while longer, anyway.”
John resigned himself to a lecture.
John nodded stiffly. “Sure.”
“I'm fine,” Sherlock grumbles when he returns.
John stroked his face, then leaned over to the bedside table, pulling a tube and square packet from the drawer.
John hesitated. “Actually, we—”
John smiled to himself, his good mood influencing the generous tip he gave to the driver. He stepped out into the snow, letting a few flakes fall onto his face. He was looking forward to the evening, and the next day, and the weeks ahead. What happened when they returned to England… it was too soon to tell, but he had a feeling that things would work out. Call it a sprinkle of intuition.
Sherlock remains silent, hesitant to admit she’s probably right. He feels foolish, allowing his imagination to overwhelm his normally rational brain. Ghosts and killers and blood stains... He rubs his eyes, exhausted.
They fell silent again. Sherlock gazed at John's hands resting on the steering wheel. “Did you serve during the war?” he asked, suddenly curious. He guessed John was about the age where he might have done a year or two of service.
The heat in the room builds as they continue to explore and taste and touch, slowly prying off their shoes and unbuttoning shirts. Sherlock slides his hands up John’s chest, the dark hair coarse against his fingers. He pushes the shirt from John’s shoulders, tugging it off, wanting to see his bare skin.
“You owe me the story about that,” Sherlock murmured before tucking himself against John’s back.
John deflected his sympathy. “It happened. I was sent home, I moved on.”
He took another sip of coffee, mulling over all the possibilities. Well, life was too short not to go after what you wanted. If he was going to be shot down in flames, it might as well be by Sherlock.
“Oh my God, you were fantastic,” Sarah laughed, touching his arm. “The other guy called your blog ‘warm paste for the masses,’ and you said his website was ‘boring cerebral masturbation that nobody wanted to read.’ That describes half the articles I have to review.”
Sherlock knew then they were not going to exchange pleasantries about John’s time away or his latest case, or about the train trip or the terrible weather. Instead, they were instantly back where they had left things -- the kiss, the agreed-upon risk -- a door reopened, ready to be nudged wider if they dared move forward.
He clears the dishes as she pours herself a third glass of wine.
“You look beautiful in the moonlight,” John murmured, brushing his fingertips over the dusting of freckles on Sherlock's cheekbones.
He takes a quick drink, averting his eyes. When he dares to glance up again, Sherlock is skimming his fingers over his scraggly beard. John wants to dismiss the subject as quickly as possible, skip over what was possibly an insult. Sherlock isn't completely helpless.
“Yes.”
All their doubts were crumbling, a surge of heat and want rising in them, their mouths nipping, teasing, their touches growing rougher and more possessive.
“Oh!” Molly gasps, her hand flying to her chest. “It's you.”
There had been soft kisses and hard kisses, dry brushes of lips and wet probes of tongue, licks and laps and nuzzles and bites, fingers tugging and stroking and circling… a universe of sensations. And he had started it all with a simple lean forward and a hungry curiosity, unable to resist a second taste of John's mouth.
“Of course.” Her eyes remained on her phone.
John blew across his cup to cool the steaming tea, contemplating the curves of Sherlock’s back as he stood at the sink. Sherlock reached up into the cupboard to grab a clean mug, and there it was, the little hole in the shirt winking temptingly, the slit just the right size for a fingertip.
John cupped his cheek, concern clouding his face. “You okay?”
Sherlock froze in place, trying to sound neutral. “Oh?”
“It helps me think, make connections.”
The small talk drifted to an end and Sherlock waited, simply appreciating the connection with John.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s knee. “I can’t tell you that.”
I finally had a few days off from med school. I should have been studying, but my brain rebelled at the thought. I really didn't give a damn about the finer points of the cardiovascular system at this moment.
Sherlock woke with a start, heart pounding, squinting against the sudden light. John was in his room, fully dressed, shouting.
The hotel was once grand, but now is showing its age. Slightly faded curtains, worn carpet, countless coats of paint that can't hide decades of minor scuffs and dents. John doesn't mind because the bed is comfortable, the bathtub is large, he's finished the last day of a conference, and he’s just opened the door to the welcome sight of Sherlock. They have two full days together.
Sherlock lifted his face to him. “I want to kiss you. Just once, so I know.”
Sherlock squared off against his opponent, fists raised, feet light, ready to deliver or defend against a blow. John watched from a distance, loitering in the doorway to the gymnasium as the boxers circled each other like sleek tigers in a cage.
“Is there a photo of him?”
“Oh yes, the rumors. Nearly forgot about that. I’ll have the Yard release a statement announcing your resurrection. Speaking of the dead, any more ghost problems?”
“God, I’ve missed you,” John breathed raggedly against Sherlock’s neck, their cocks trapped between their undulating bodies. Sherlock rolled onto his back as John’s mouth trailed down his throat, skimmed to his collarbone, licked and suckled at his nipples.
His phone rang, sparing me from any more observations. I didn't pay attention until he sat up, his back going rigid, and I knew it was bad news.
He finds Sherlock’s mouth, kisses him deeply, backing him against the wall. He presses forward with his hips, suddenly raw and lustful, his pulse throbbing. He greedily drinks in Sherlock’s eager response, their hungry mouths insatiable, his fingers tangling into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock’s immense hands grasp his arse, pulling him closer, hips flush, grinding.
“Sit down and keep pressure on that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They walked toward the hives, passing the stone fence that was crumbling in spots, and entered a small clearing where six white wooden boxes with pitched roofs stood in a rough circle. A few bees droned around them in the sunlight.
It was Sherlock who made the bold suggestion. “Come back to my room,” he whispered near John’s ear.
I couldn't resist bragging on the playground that I knew Sherlock Holmes. I had stupidly added that I’d even been to his flat and had seen a real human skull on his fireplace mantle.
Sherlock blanches. “No, of course not.”
For several seconds, Sherlock didn't move, and John's confidence wavered. But then the elegant hands lifted and, one by one, began unfastening each pearly button.
“Wait for me in the bar. I’ll walk back with you.”
Sherlock touched the tip of his index finger to John’s. “What did you feel when I joined you in bed earlier?” He lightly traced the back of John's hand. “What are you feeling right now?”
“Sure, sometimes. Doesn't everybody?”
John stands at the foot of the bed, noting the pleasant warmth of the fire. He hesitates, not quite sure how to navigate the sleeping arrangements.
“Perfectly normal, considering what you’ve been through. You’re in a strange house, you’re tired, under stress…”
John holds his breath, places his index finger on Sherlock’s lower back, silently tracing the pattern of the constellation. His finger stops just above the towel wrapped around Sherlock’s waist. With one firm tug, he could make the flimsy cotton drop away. He could place his hands on Sherlock’s hips, slide them down to cup the globes of his buttocks, press his pelvis into the cleft to let him feel his desire, the hard line of his cock, the hot press of his mouth on his vertebrae.
“So Molly,” John began, changing the subject, “I saw you go by with more packages and letters this week. I think you have a sweetheart from uni that you’re writing to,” he teased.
Sherlock took him in with a sweeping glance. “Single with a good job, but unsatisfied in his work. Frustrated poet.”
Sherlock glanced at John, arched a skeptical eyebrow, then looked back at the clients. “We’ll take your case.”
They found a corner table with an impressive view of the mountains and sat down.
“Really, John. That's hardly subtle.”
******************
They made their way to the bed, undoing a button, slipping out of their braces, savoring the slowness of their hands in the near darkness.
“Have any plans for winter break? John segued casually, leaning back in the booth.
Sherlock stands in dignified humiliation as John laughs gleefully, sliding over to his victim.
The famous Mr. Holmes was in the news again, his sharp-angled face plastered on the newspapers and telly for having recovered some priceless old painting from art thieves.
About a half hour in, his phone pings with a text. He looks up from the microscope and glances at the screen. It’s from Molly.
Sherlock and John worked too hard, she tutted to herself while refolding the plaid blanket draped over the back of John’s armchair. Here it was, nearly Christmas, and they didn’t have one single decoration in the flat. Instead, they were out chasing murderers and thieves. It was just so dreary.
The fireplace is mysteriously lit again, shadows licking the walls. A quick scan reveals that no one is in the room, nothing obviously overturned or out of place. He flicks on the light switch, but nothing happens. Bad fuse, faulty wiring, paranormal interference, he doesn’t know anymore.
Sherlock’s mouth crooked up at the corner. “Then I’ll buy you a drink some night after work.”
John tilted his head at him, taking in the blue silk dressing gown, the bare legs and feet, the triangle of exposed chest sprinkled with a smattering of freckles.
My father appeared around the corner, his mouth set in a hard line, the shoulders of his jacket askew as if he’d thrown it on in a hurry.
A few black and white photos line the walls, a vanity table holds hair ties and lipsticks. A small television perches on the dresser top.
“Bullocks. The body would never decompose that quickly.”
After a few more moments, Sherlock’s system calms. He takes a deep breath, exhales, loosening his grip on John’s arms, but not letting go. He doesn’t want to lose their connection; he needs to touch him.
John shakes his head. “Sounds interesting, actually.” He hesitates, rubbing his chin for a moment. “Any other visitors coming and going that I should be aware of?”
They shifted and found just enough space in the narrow bed to wrap around each other, an island of comfort in a sea of misery.
“Can't you just knock?”
He wishes John was here. He’d left that morning before John was even awake, taking the case on short notice. He’d scribbled a note and left it on the kitchen table, then rushed to the airport.
Then his hands on Sherlock's body, touching every inch, nuzzling, tasting, discovering edges and hollows, sliding his lips over his swollen cock, soft moans, thigh muscles quivering, the salt and heat of Sherlock in his mouth.
John shook his head, laughing with a bit of resignation, marveling at Sherlock's obtuseness. "It's... fine." He stirred, and they watched the rice ever-so-slowly release its starch. "At least make yourself useful, will you? Grate some cheese onto a plate. I've got to keep stirring."
He’s glad John is there beside him as they watch the taxi blend into traffic and disappear. He doesn't really want to be alone right now.
“Maybe,” John answers quietly. “Or in case you got hurt, or needed help.”
I crossed my arms and scowled at my feet encased in stiff black shoes. I hated those dumb shoes. No matter how many puddles or scuffs on the pavement I subjected them to, I couldn't destroy them. I kicked my toe against the floor. This was all Sherlock Holmes’ fault.
John held Sherlock's gaze as he slipped off his shoes and socks, then slowly worked open his belt buckle and fly. He was starting to enjoy this little strip tease. He hooked his thumbs in the denim over his hips and paused, drawing out the suspense a little longer.
There’s an invigorating bite to the air that clears his head, and when he’s allowed back inside he goes immediately to his laptop to research all he can about the various properties of wood commonly used in flooring and construction. He sets up a spreadsheet to organize the information and happily spends the afternoon lost in oak and pine with detours to cherry, mahogany, and walnut.
John’s surprise quickly turned to wariness. “How do you know about that?”
“Because it is.”
A wave of warmth lapped over Sherlock’s body as he recalled the details of their night together. He laid on his side, processing the fact that he had allowed himself to become so intimate with John, marveling again at how far his carefully constructed defenses had crumbled away over the summer.
“What?” John turned to him, still smiling. “She's attractive, don't you think?”
“Then don't say it,” Sherlock advised. He could feel his armor returning, his defenses sliding back into place. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper he had hastily scribbled on that morning, handing it to John. “My address at university, if you want to write.”
He wants it.
Also, tip of the straw boater hat to saturn_in_retrograde for beta reading.
Cool fingertips guide his mouth down to warm lips, invisible. He can feel the smile hovering over John’s mouth as he gathers him closer with fumbling arms.
Intimacy. That was the word he was fumbling for. It felt intimate to walk into their home, water bubbling, spoon circling, fingers mounding, scooping, cradling food.
Sherlock thinks back through their steps, calculating where John might have lost it. “We should look back at the flat.”
He curses the impossibility of the situation, staring at the fireplace, waiting vainly for John to return until sleep pulls him under.
It takes awhile for John to register that Sherlock’s large hands are now grasping his thighs, thumbs angled toward his crotch. The sight and pressure of those long fingers arouse him even more. He can’t stop himself from sucking Sherlock’s bottom lip and rocking his pelvis into Sherlock’s grip, wanting his huge palm to cup his hardness.
“What’s wrong?”
“Sure…” Dimmock replied unconvincingly.
John gazed at him. “It looks good.” He dragged his eyes down his frame. “You actually bought jeans.”
“It’s old, but it has all the amenities you require.” Mycroft turns the cup in his hand, hesitant. “There’s one more thing…”
Back in his room, he'd spent several hours reacquainting himself with the instrument. It had been more than a year since he'd last played, and he was painfully rusty. Even reading music -- a skill that used to come easily -- took effort. He vowed to practice more often over the summer, and to bring his violin back to uni with him.
Mouths parted slightly, accepting more, tasting, exploring, hungry. Aromatic spices. Bitter hops. Woodsy cologne. Palms slid up necks. Someone sighed, someone inhaled shakily.
Sherlock finally looked away, appearing to be bored.
"John, wait."
They walked through the dewy grass, the sunlight slanting at a low angle.
John grinned, then pushed Sherlock onto his back, swinging a leg over his hips and straddling his thighs. “I'm an excellent influence. I've kept you out of all kinds of trouble,” he ran his fingertips down Sherlock's sternum, “introducing you to all sorts of new hobbies…”
“I know what I saw,” Mycroft replied, holding his gaze. “Your heart is ruling your head. And if you're not careful, your heart is going to be broken.”
John narrows his eyes. “And what?”
“Thank God, a language I understand.”
“It’s nothing… bad headache.” He tried to pull himself together. “Who’s calling?”
“Then what are you saying?” John challenges. “That I should just walk away? That I can magically find somebody else and live happily ever after?”
“Molly said she loves to dance,” John offered as an explanation.
He gazes at the flames, his eyes traveling past the kitchen to the bathroom when he hears the creak of door hinges. Sherlock steps into the hallway, a towel slung low around his hips. He rubs his wet hair with another towel and shuffles into the kitchen to rummage in the cupboards.
“Where’s Molly?”
“One of each, then.”
She smiled again. “Great. Meet us at the boathouse at three o'clock.”
John tilts his head. “Mm, no. Both male. Close to the same age, I’d say.”
As John gnawed unhappily on his thoughts, he was surprised to hear the distinct sound of an envelope ripping. So Sherlock decided to open the card after all. John held his breath, listening for some sort of reaction. There was, at most, a faint sniff.
“Against those two?” Sherlock scoffed. “They're about as exciting as toast.”
After a twinge of irritation, John decided to go. His neck was a little tight, his back a bit stiff after sitting so long. He made his way to the spa in the lower level of the resort and was whisked off to a changing room that contained a fluffy white dressing gown.
“I’ll do that.”
John undoes the second button, his eyes tracing down the tendons in Sherlock’s long neck, coming to rest on the delicate skin lining the hollow of his throat. He pauses, toying with anticipation, relishing the way Sherlock’s posture is both languid and tense, filling the room with a low vibration of need.
John checks his messages.Seeming satisfied that all is well, he curls his phone into his palm.
Thanks again for your patience as I slowly post, and here's a thousand roses for you for following along!
Sherlock was in his element, discussing worsted wool, jacket buttons, vents, and pleats. He could tell John was trying to feign interest, but clearly was following only half of the conversation.
Okay, so my ability to maintain slow burn with these two is pretty much nil. The sultry summer is too much! I give up trying to hold them back and will let them do what they so badly want to do.
John steps a bit closer, slipping into Sherlock’s field of vision. “Please?”
Sherlock adds one more incentive. “Your medical expertise could prove useful.”
“Fair enough.” Sherlock held out his hand to shake on their agreement. Only when John's palm crossed over his did it strike him that this was the first time they'd touched since saying farewell nearly a decade ago. John's skin was rough and warm against his, his grip brief and strong. The contact was over in few seconds.
“Hmm?” John glances up from the morning paper.
Molly cleared her throat, breaking the tension. “Um, I think we should be going.” She looked pointedly at Sherlock until he glanced over at her. She put a foot on a pedal. “Are we still on for Saturday?” she asked John.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow, then covered John’s bare foot with his own, sliding it up his leg, the hair on John's calf silkily coarse under the pad of his foot.
No reply comes and he walks on, his hands shoved in his pockets. He's too old for this, full of worry and heartsick. He'd avoided all these complications for years, and now drifting in his 40s he’s as moody as a teenager. Pathetic.
“Nonsense. We're here now, and you’re obviously competent. Some of the photos in the window are your work, if I'm not mistaken. The ones signed I.S.?”
They sit in a booth upholstered in burgundy faux leather, discussing the night’s events over savory noodles and crisp vegetables and smoky tea. John is relaxed, smiling more, the conversation turning personal as a single candle throws shadows onto the red tablecloth.
“I’ll be in the back yard if you need me.”
Sherlock looked away first. Or maybe John did.
Sherlock describes the latest events, his voice tetchy.
John teased Sherlock with his mouth, licking a stripe up the underside of his shaft, tasting the tang of hot skin. A tremulous drop, translucent, welled from the slit and John licked it away with a glide of his tongue, causing Sherlock to inhale sharply through his nose.
John looked pointedly at Sherlock's mouth, letting his gaze wander down his body, feeling possessive. “I'm not sure she entirely succeeded.”
He gripped the top of his cane, regretting his last words, wishing he hadn't revealed so much. But it was too late to take it back. He swallowed. “I was sent to a post near the Khyber Pass. Several units in the area were assigned to construct roads through territory that was heavily disputed. There were tribal snipers in the mountains, bloody good marksmen. Then the rebellion started brewing … attacks occurred all along the border … more troops were brought in.”
“Afghanistan.”
Sherlock watched and listened attentively as his father demonstrated how to lift out, rotate, and inspect the frames, which looked like rectangular screens attached to wooden slats. Mr. Holmes spoke calmly, his movements gentle and fluid, being careful not to crush any bees. As the bees hummed and crawled around the hive, his father explained how he was checking the eggs, monitoring the food supply, and ensuring the queen was healthy.
Sherlock slowly leans in and spreads his palms over John’s thighs, gripping his fingers into his flesh through his jeans. John’s eyes widen, awestruck, as Sherlock dips his mouth, brushing his lips against his, clinging softy for a moment. John is overwhelmed with the soft heat of Sherlock’s mouth, the tickle of curls against his forehead, the bristle of stubble on his upper lip.
Sherlock's eyes were still closed when they parted, his hard edges temporarily blurred. John leaned his head back against the seat, watching Sherlock take form again.
He makes his way to the fireplace and draws a chair closer to the flame for better light. He turns the diary in his hands, sensing that he was meant to find it, just like he was meant to discover the photographs. The journal has been hidden under the floor for a hundred years, waiting to be held and read by him. It’s as if John Watson is speaking to him now, about to reveal his most intimate thoughts.
He glanced at the French doors that led from the balcony to John’s room, hoping to see a light on, a glow from within. It was dark, silent. The dream lingered, haunting Sherlock with how real it seemed. He put his fingers to his lips, swearing he could feel the heat of John’s kiss.
“Fine by me.” John met his eyes. “And what about guests? I don't want to be in the way if you have a… special visitor.”
So instead of celebrating the case together over dim sum, it was walking home alone through the dark streets, the adrenaline wearing off, his raw knuckles stinging, up the stairs, into the empty flat.
“Follow me.” Molly led the way down a hallway to a set of stairs. They passed a service elevator along the way -- it was more than big enough for a coffin, Sherlock noted.
Sherlock dropped his gaze back to his tea. “I know.”
Sherlock quickly suppresses a smirk. “There were a few noises last night. Did you happen to hear anything?”
The windows were down so I could breathe in the tangy sea air. I was feeling a bit giddy. I really hadn't spent any time outdoors since… when? All I had seen the past year seemed to be the inside of classrooms and labs.
“So good,” Sherlock murmured, wending his fingers into John’s hair again, telegraphing how slow, how fast, how hard John should move his mouth and hand. John obeyed, lavishing Sherlock's cock with expert attention, lapping and swirling, sucking and gliding.
“Mr. Callaghan?” Molly scoffed. “He's 85. I don't think he’s likely to take a swing at a young chap like this.”
Molly shifted her gaze to him. “I don't anymore. I mean, I try not to. I know he doesn't think of me that way.” She folded her hands awkwardly. “For the longest time, I wasn't sure he knew I existed. But I always talked to him at events and things. He always seemed sort of... alone. So we're friends now, I think.” She nodded, as if agreeing with herself. “So that's nice.”
He chastised himself for burning John's letters. He could remember each one, thrown into the fireplace or curling over the flame of a candle, blackened bits dropping into an ashtray. Their destruction had brought temporary satisfaction, but there was always a lingering question at the back of his mind, wondering what John had written.
“I know I’ve made mistakes,” he went on, pacing again. “I haven’t been the best father. But I tried to give you stability, a good home.”
“It’s how these things go. Trust me.”
Sherlock’s eyes fly up, on guard. He relaxes when he recognizes John. “It wasn’t a very clever hiding spot.”
“We’re all older,” John shot back. God, Sherlock was such a prick.
John’s seat was empty at dinner. Sherlock wanted to die, unable to ask his parents where John was. His voice would crack, giving him away. He picked at his food, miserable.
When his knees are parted and pushed slowly toward his chest, he understands. His breathing quickens again, his pupils dilating, knowing that John is standing at the edge of the bed while he lies naked before him, his entrance stretched and waiting.
“It reminds me of my grandmother’s cottage. We used to visit her in the summer when I was a boy. She kept flowers and bees.”
Finally, after showers and shaves and a convincing rumpling of Sherlock’s bed to make it looked slept in, they closed the connecting door and exited their rooms for a quick lunch.
Sherlock absorbs John's words. He doesn't mention stress or guilt as possible psychological factors, but asks a question instead. “And your medical colleagues, they’ve experienced these types of things too?”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock shrugged. “And the noon hour?”
When his fingers brushed across the book with the red cloth cover, his gut tightened. He lifted the book out gingerly, as if it were a bomb that might detonate with the slightest movement. He held it, his mouth drawn down, his fingertips finding the gap in the pages where the photographs from his summer with John were wedged.
John shoots him an exasperated look. “They’re random questions. It’s supposed to be fun.” He focuses on the screen. “Like this one: Are you a dog or a cat person?”
Sherlock's coat and hair are damp, as is his mood. “Delightful weather, Glasgow,” he grumbles.
Sherlock steps forward, intrigued by the burnished patina of the bones. “They’re quite old,” he remarks.
Dimmock pulls out a pad and makes a note, then flips back a page. “Got the lab report back on the knife. No fingerprints except for Miss Cornish’s.” He flips the pad shut and sticks it in his back pocket. “So, I reckon our prankster got scared and took off. We’ll keep an eye open. Let me know if anything else is out of place.”
“It’s not so hard to get into a room,” Sherlock answered airily, taking another sip of his wine.
Sherlock tries to resist sounding pleased, but gives up pretending to be mad, groaning out words of encouragement, his fingers in John’s hair. His back arches, knees tighten, and he hears himself moaning out John’s name.
Donovan suddenly scraped her chair back and stood up. “You're such a fucking idiot!” She threw her drink into Anderson’s face and stalked away, a few hoots and claps following in her wake.
John glances up at their paired reflections, his eyes catching Sherlock's in the mirror. Etchings of fine lines, dark circles, silver hair… They're middle-aged, world-weary, broken. How do they start over? How do they rebuild their complicated relationship, and how do they let it grow, possibly, eventually, into something more?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Isn’t it? Staking our intellectual territory, battling with words, attacking our enemies…”
Her heels tapped sternly as she left his room, and Sherlock shoved the door with his foot, shutting it with a bang.
“You’re far too nice.”
When John’s fingers curl over his waistband and tug down, Sherlock digs his elbows into the mattress and lifts his hips, helping the striped cotton pajamas to slip down, freeing his cock.
John nods slowly. “I've spent a lot of time with the dead and dying… even more than you, I'd say. Med school, the Army. Hospitals and morgues...
“Come in,” she said, practically pulling him into the kitchen by the arm. She looked nervous, as if she was having second thoughts. “My parents are out,” she explained. “They’d kill me if they knew I was doing this.”
“So,” Sherlock starts hesitantly, “what should I tell Mrs. Hudson about the room?”
“You’re gorgeous,” John sighed, sliding his hands over the smooth globes of Sherlock’s arse.
“Everything alright?” he asks.
He wanted John, but not yet, not in this little room with lace curtains and braided yarn rugs. It should be in London -- far away in the city, the two of them alone among a sea of strangers, lying together in a soft bed in an anonymous room with an unfamiliar view that they could make their own, discovering each other all over again, hour after luxurious hour.
“It's okay,” he finally says. “Just clumsy.” He starts to pick up the pieces.
I was numb, confused, somehow managing to slip silently back down the stairs as if my body had dissolved into millions of tiny weightless particles. I stumbled out the kitchen door and into the cold evening air, walking blindly toward our car parked along the driveway.
*******************
In August, Sherlock joined his parents at the villa for a month before returning to his graduate studies. At breakfast one morning, Sherlock’s father casually mentioned that John would be at a writer’s conference in London in the autumn.
John stroked Sherlock's cock, pulling back the foreskin, his thumb working the sensitive underside of the head. A perfect bead of pre-come soon glistened at the slit.
John sighs, giving in. “Hamish,” he mumbles.
Sherlock’s eyes are far away on the horizon when he speaks.
John lowered his bike into a hydrangea bush and watched the window carefully. It would be a disaster if Mr. or Mrs. Holmes or one of the servants caught him lurking outside in the gardens. He had no idea what his excuse would be. He willed someone to come to the window and peer out; two seconds, that’s all he would need to identify the face.
“It’s so cozy now,” John said, lightly running his fingers over the pine branches, releasing a gentle waft of fragrance.
He reaches the landing and pushes open the door, surprised to find it dark. John must be at work, or out. Maybe with a woman.
They had immediately unlatched the common door between them, Sherlock soon coming in to flop onto John’s bed with a sigh. John joined him, stretching out.
It took awhile to float back to reality. John shifted to sit on the floor with his back against the wall, Sherlock pulling up his trousers and sinking down to sit next to him. They were silent, breaths still calming, the raditoring making a faint hissing sound. John rubbed his sore knee, casting a glance at Sherlock, not sure what to say. They’d crossed a line, and he didn’t know what came next.
Sherlock’s mouth curved up on one side, a faint color blooming on his cheeks. John loved that Sherlock blushed at suggestive remarks, his brusque exterior merely a shell for a much softer inside. However, John was discovering that softness co-existed with a steely curiosity. One moment John could be making Sherlock melt with pleasure, and within minutes he'd be the one gasping under Sherlock's long fingers and plush lips.
By this time a group of kids had gathered to gawk.
“I know, Sherlock. I know about you and my dad.”
Sherlock tugged his lower lip, staring out the window at the people below. Everybody rushing about, going to lunch, having a smoke, completing errands before returning to their dull jobs selling insurance or running shops or, in John’s case, touching people.
They followed a little-used trail that veered off from the main path, finding themselves on the far side of the lake. They were alone, Sherlock realized, a sudden flame of desire sparking at the base of his spine.
“A dance…” Sherlock repeated doubtfully.
Sherlock stared at the wall as John’s words sank in, stunned by John’s confession. He had helped John, but saved him? How could he, a selfish, arrogant, irresponsible prick, ever be worthy of such praise?
John pushed himself up onto one elbow to gaze down at him. He took Sherlock's hand in his and guided it to his own chest, placing Sherlock’s fingertips over the top button of his shirt.
The train was stuffy and reeked of body odor. By the time I rang Matthew’s doorbell, my shirt was soaked under my armpits.
John laughed. "Must be nice." He took a sip of wine that Sherlock had brought home a few days ago. A Pinot Noir. "No wonder you were so thin when I first met you."
Had Sherlock been sending signals all along, trying to nudge him with hint after hint, only to be met with utter cluelessness?
“I’m sure too,” John whispered back, his voice rough with desire, silently thanking the universe for thieves and chalets and impromptu holidays, jeans and jumpers and the brilliant, gorgeous man finally wrapped in his arms.
“Actually, I
“A friend?” Mycroft’s eyes slid to John. “How novel.”
John tugged Sherlock down to his mouth, whispering his praises before delivering a devilish kiss. “You're a goddamned prodigy.”
Sherlock lowered himself to sit on the edge of the desk, his fingers tightening on the receiver.
“Mummy agrees,” Mycroft explained patiently. “She's looked at the numbers as well, and we all must tighten our belts. You’ll simply have to make do with a smaller allowance from now on.”
John had never been dishonest with him, had never promised him anything, but he had broken his heart. Sherlock couldn't hold him responsible for that forever. They had been so young, and he had been so inexperienced. It wasn't John's fault that he had inconveniently fallen in love with him.
Pupils dilate.
“Better than another bullet,” Mycroft replies dryly. “Consider it a holiday.”
“Not exactly Scotland Yard’s finest,” John commented dryly.
“I know a detective inspector at Scotland Yard… he comes to me with cases they can’t solve. And I have a contact at St. Bart’s morgue who alerts me to oddities she finds on corpses—” he changes tack when he sees Nurse Cornish’s appalled expression. “And clients contact me through my website. Lots of missing dogs and suspected affairs, stolen valuables, that sort of thing,” he adds, trying to tone down the content of his work.
“Fine,” Sherlock answers absently, his hand still holding back the curtain, watching the gloomy evening.
Interest flickered in Molly's eyes. “What kind of case?”
“Don't you want to know the rest of it?” John lifted his eyes to Sherlock, challenging him. “Or can you tell just by looking at me?”
John can't resist the pale column of neck, trails his lips from ear to collarbone, backing Sherlock up against the sink so he can reach the sensitive skin. Practically wedged between Sherlock's legs, John can feel Sherlock harden in response through their thin cotton clothing, and his blood quickens.
Sherlock moved more slowly, trailing after John. They collected their coats and bags, then stepped out into the November night.
“You’ll see.”
They ate in silence, adjusting to the new atmosphere between them. When the room grew even quieter, John looked up, then followed Sherlock’s gaze back to his own left hand. Sherlock clearly had noticed the absent wedding band.
“l'll just… go wash up,” John says, grabbing his bag and plucking up a candle. He retreats to the bathroom, brushes his teeth, slips on pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt.
Sherlock’s eyes darken almost imperceptibly, a faint color shading his cheeks. They stand facing each other, cold air swirling off their coats, on the edge of something happening.
It’s not a conscious decision when John gently slides his hands around Sherlock’s waist and tips forward, covering the fresh scar with his lips. It’s an instinct, a deep need to warm and protect the beautiful, brilliant conundrum of a man he’s fallen in love with.
Never fear -- the journey through the Swamp of Angst will eventually lead to the Land of Happy Endings. We've got a ways to go though...
********************
“Do you know anything about music?”
“Could you find that old skeleton that Mike uses in his anatomy class and bring it down here? I think it’s in the storage closet next to the lab upstairs.”
The smell of pastries wafted across the street and his stomach growled, making him realize how long it had been since he'd last eaten. He crossed over to the bakery and ordered a coffee and croissant to tide him over, picking up a copy of
I nodded, then said, “Yes.”
My voice wavered. “I think you're a really good dad.”
*****************
“Look at you, already diving in. You always were an overachiever.”
“I love you, goddammit,” John growls, his mouth trailing across Sherlock's. “I should have said it years ago.”
“Odd family,” Molly joked, snorting a bit. “Sorry, that sounded mean. It's just, they're really smart, brilliant even. But a bit… different.”
That voice. Deep, velvety, self-assured. John raised his eyes to the ceiling half in thanks, half in rage. He let the rage win out, stringing together a blistering set of curses that could peel the paint off furniture.
A muscle in John’s jaw twitches.
The ice is finally thawing, and things should soon be warming up. I can't wait!
“Pleased to meet you. Have you recently moved to London?”
John removed his arm from Sherlock's shoulder. “Was it a mistake?”
*****************
John still didn't meet his eyes, instead glancing toward the house as if worried they might be watched. “I don't know. I have a lot to do.”
He glanced at the list, mostly groceries and refills of Aunt Helen’s medicine. “Sure. I’ll go later this afternoon.” He looked forward to getting away from the house, even if it meant driving his father’s old Model T. Hardly a sporty car compared to the nimble Vauxhall.
“Such as?”
“You never know. You might like some of the old horror classics.”
John nods, considering. “How much is the rent?”
Sherlock hesitates, then answers honestly. “No. I think someone is playing with us.”
“Found him lurking in the alley behind your flat near the bins.”
Sherlock swallows and pushes on, not wanting to lose momentum. “She's fine with it. She said not to worry about her.” He pauses again, steals another glance at John, and slows his pace. “She said she wants us to be happy,” he adds gently.
John stared back blankly, then it dawned on him, the weighted possibility of what Sherlock was suggesting. John rose to his feet, his knees weak, his pulse beating faster.
“I never called it that.”
Sherlock’s thoughts dissipated when John turned, shifting the covers away from his shoulder. John listed forward, hooking a hand over Sherlock’s hip and placing a sleepy kiss on his upper arm before settling into the bed again. Sherlock pressed against John, enjoying the sensation of John's thighs snugging into his bum.
“There's some hope for you,” Sherlock eventually acknowledged.
It’ll be fine, he tells himself early on, John will contact him. After a week, he carefully lowers his expectations to a neutral point. Perhaps it's better this way, letting the heat of the moment cool, the memory of their kiss fade away like a scar, and then things can go back to what they were. Friends. Close friends. At least there would be that.
I’d decided to take a gap year and travel instead of going to university right away. I volunteered for a three-month project in southern India working on women’s health education. I ended up liking it so much that I extended my stay for another three months. The last half of the year I spent traveling, knocking around as many countries as I could afford.
He had no claim on Sherlock, and so it wasn't his business who he did or didn't sleep with or why, or what porn he watched (although Sherlock really could do that on his own laptop, couldn't he?), and he should just be grateful that he was getting to spend an all-expenses-paid holiday with the one person in the world he most enjoyed being with. They were together and that was all that mattered.
John waves a dismissive hand. “I’m half joking. Plus I’ve had two gin and tonics. Maybe more.” He sits down heavily in his chair across from Sherlock, who’s looking peevish. “What?”
“You shut up!” In a burst of frustration, I lashed out, my knuckles bashing satisfyingly into Tommy’s fat freckled cheek.
It reminded him of starting the fire for the bee smoker. Working with bees was not something he'd ever expected to learn during the summer, nor was experiencing the intense blossoming of his own desires. He gazed at John, who now kneeled beside him, strategically placing a few larger logs on the fire.
“Good?”
A woman in a tight green dress passes by. The unusual color catches John's attention, then her brown eyes, then her knowing smile. His neck swivels just enough to catch a pleasing glimpse of curves as she walks away.
(See the end of the chapter for
So assuming it was flirting, his turn to reciprocate was long overdue. John rubbed his forehead in agitation. How could he have been so thick? Usually he was so good at this sort of thing — the little games of seduction. He just hadn’t been receptive to it, thinking there was never a chance…
“You didn't care much for John, I take it,” she said, glancing at him.
“Yes, tea,” Sherlock said crisply, taking the opportunity to escape. “This way, John.”
They stood for a moment, chests rapidly rising and falling. Sherlock's robe had fallen open across his torso, barely hanging onto his left shoulder, barely concealing anything below his navel. John was naked to his waist, barefoot, jeans crumpled down low on his hips.
Much to my delight, Dad had finally bought a car the previous year, so we drove to the village where the funeral was being held and where Sherlock had grown up.
Sighing heavily, John placed his tea on a side table and stood in the middle of the rug.
He looked up at Mycroft, who had discarded his jacket and sported an ivory waistcoat. Sherlock wordlessly handed him his cigarette case and lighter, lacking the energy to point out that Mycroft rarely smoked.
But there was another facet to consider. Little details in John's behavior, nuances in his expressions. His words.
Slooooww burn....  more to come!
“Doing what, exactly?”
“Timing’s never right, is it?” Sherlock pulled away, his tone tired and bitter.
“What’s it been like… waiting all these years?”
Still, he might as well have a look now that he was here. He shifted his cane and rapped the brass knocker, drawing his shoulders up and back while he waited. The door soon was opened by a spritely older woman wearing a floral print dress, red lipstick brightening her mouth.
He spotted a willow tree, its long branches dipping into the water. He pulled John by the hand, leading him beneath the strange canopy of greenery, hiding them from view.
“Hamish?” Sherlock repeats loudly, amused. “John
I suppose I regarded Sherlock as sort of an uncle. He was one of the few adults who would willingly play board games with me, and utterly cheat while doing it. I loved that. If he broke a rule on his turn, I’d break a rule on my turn, until the game turned into a chaotic battle. Dad would roll his eyes and walk away, muttering.
He breathes John in, wood smoke and sunlight, whiskey and mint, runs his hands over biceps, across shoulder blades, the rasp of stubble burning his cheeks.
“But what?”
“The police were here early this morning -- three of them,” she started, “I overheard them talking. They’re completely baffled.”
“Is it that surprising?”
“I was sleep deprived, thought I was hallucinating. But the next day I checked the records. A 19-year-old private had died in that bed two nights before. That shook me -- made me question everything.”

“I don’t have one.”
She smiles, then switches off the small bedside lamp and leaves.
A cool stream of air brushes over his neck. He sits upright, sensing John in the room. He glances at Hannah to see if she notices, but she’s absorbed in an article, absently twisting a lock of hair around her finger. The cold mug of tea suddenly lifts from the table and floats toward the kitchen. He’s clearly meant to follow.
They both said good night to me. I climbed the stairs and returned to the still-warm bed, mystified by adults again.
John was frequently absent from lunches and dinners. Whether he was working, resting, or meeting someone, Sherlock did not know. When John did grace their table, women smiled at him and tossed their hair, looking at him from under their lashes. John accepted the attention with good humor, sometimes responding with flirtatiousness. Women touched his arm as they laughed, men clasped his shoulder as they told him stories. He was golden, glorious, the type of man women wanted to take to bed, the type men wanted to be in bed.
As they progressed through the hives, they refilled the smoker several times. Mr. Holmes went on with details about drones and worker bees, pollen and nectar, mites and predators until Sherlock's head was buzzing like the honey bees they were tending.
He placed the toolbox back on the wooden shelf. There wasn't any point to thinking too far ahead. The only sure thing was the present. He and Sherlock should enjoy the time that they did have. And tonight he was determined to make sure they found time.
John’s eyes darken, one hand slides up Sherlock's side, skimming under his light blue T-shirt, a thumb passing over his nipple in return. There's no hiding Sherlock's reaction under the thin cotton pajama bottoms. John notices, thrums the sensitive flesh again, and moves closer. He guides Sherlock onto his back, pushes the shirt up Sherlock's torso, lowers his mouth to the neglected nipple on the right.
“No, that’s ridiculous. You’ll ruin your back.”
” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock slid his hand around the back of John’s neck, holding him near. “Very much so…”
Sherlock searches for his phone with one hand, groggy and disoriented. He finally locates it and mumbles something into the speaker.
They both gazed at the dance floor, silently brooding.
Sherlock slid his hands up John's back and lowered his lips, finding the familiar warmth of John's mouth. If this was their last night together, he wanted it to unfold gradually, lingering over every detail.
Sherlock narrows his eyes. “What do you mean?”
John pulled back slightly, touching the side of Sherlock’s neck. “You’re freezing.”
Sherlock grasped at John's shoulders, dizzy at the thought. But he had an additional wish, a vivid desire recently discovered. “There's something I'd like to try…”
“Hm, I prefer the real drama happening out there, in the city.”
“I can drop you off too,” Sherlock offered to John. “There should be room enough.”
Sherlock's eyes were locked on him, his fingers falling still on the glass. John had his full attention. He licked his lips, letting his mouth run on before he could think too far ahead and censor himself.
