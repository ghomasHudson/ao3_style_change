“If you wouldn’t mind,” Dean said, sliding into a chair and reaching for a muffin. He pulled down the wrapper and took a bite.
Sam stood in front of their “team”. Dean sat at the kitchen table, eyes narrowed and arms folded. Sam said something about the need for backup, but Dean saw through that. Sam wanted unpaid labor. He wanted interns.
“Are you kidding? She didn’t mean anything to him. He didn’t even know who he was.” Dean widened his eyes, “Hey. What if his memory is gone again? That’s why he hadn’t called.”
Empty looked like? It didn’t matter. It was his best bet to finding Cas, and he wouldn’t rest until he found him.
Cas spotted him instantly and lead Dean and Jack to the table. Jack seemed eager to see what this surprise was all about. Dean tried not to drag his feet.
Eileen is finally in this chapter, and I debated how to write her dialogue since she mostly signs. Just assume most of the characters can sign, and Eileen is always signing :)
There were some people Dean had expected to see that weren’t there. Bobby, his parents, some of the angels. Jack, in his infinite wisdom, hadn’t brought them back.
Sam looked at Dean. Dean looked back, expecting an answer. He didn’t care that the question sounded like something a needy boyfriend would ask. It was a fair question, and if Sam couldn’t answer, that just meant Dean was right. Cas had amnesia. Or he forgot how to use phones. Or he was in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere, searching the ground for quarters because he didn’t have a cell phone and there was a pay phone right there. That made sense.
“It was Carmen Porter, dude, I couldn’t leave any details out. Well, hey, now that I know you’re gay, you’re gonna tell me stuff too, right?”
He wished they were driving at night. He wished Sam couldn’t see his face. He glanced in the rearview, and it was just as he thought. He looked tired and pathetic and stretched thin.
Good place to start looking. He started taking the stairs two at a time. It was dark in the stairway, and as soon as he was out of the light case from the doorway, it was pitch black. He kept going, now taking them one at a time. There were horrible sounds in the dark, sounds likely being made by horrible things. He hoped none of them had Cas. Or used to be Cas. He pushed the worry down, and kept descending.
Cas studied Dean’s face and remembered what it felt like to study his soul. So much love, he could drown in it. This sudden decision about kids, about becoming a parent, pulled the rug out from under him. It felt like he was freefalling, ever since Logan had told him the situation.
“I remember that chapter,” Sam nodded, like a nerd, “that’s why I started doing a deep dive into possible artifacts. This Joyous Discus thing is pretty promising. There’s a myth about a lost soul who put his hand in the center of the plate, and he was transported to the lowest place in the world where he was never happy again.”
He slept most of the day, exhausted but safe in the bunker. They’d just killed Chuck and saved the world, hopefully for the last time, and he deserved some solid shut eye. So did Sam, who Dean assumed was also holed up in his room.
Charlie raised her eyebrows and Cas turned again so his face was smothered by couch. Anything was better than seeing her skeptical look. Last night he told Charlie everything, because he had to tell someone. It didn’t feel real until he heard Charlie gasp and ask questions and say, ‘oh damn’. He also trusted Charlie to keep it a secret. Cas decided he wouldn’t tell anyone else until Dean did. He wasn’t even sure Dean wanted to come out. Or if Dean was even queer. Though he had mentioned hooking up with Benny.
Michael won custody and Cas was rushed off to a celebratory family dinner. Afterwards when there was a knock on the door, he knew who it would be.
“I thought that was you,” Dean straightened up, and took a deep breath, “Jesus. What if I had been museum staff? Do you always swing first, ask questions later?”
And then they were mad at each other for two long weeks. Cas ignored him at school. Dean didn’t call or text. Cas felt like shit, but he told himself it was good that this happened now. He didn’t want to waste time on a so-called friend that wouldn’t accept him for who he is. He nearly managed to convince himself, except at night when he laid in bed wide awake and imagined scenarios where Dean came crawling back with a changed attitude and tearful apology.
“Yeah, that’s probably above Barbara Crane’s paygrade,” Dean said. Cas still looked dejected. Dean cleared his throat.
Sam blinked. Eileen thought she might’ve misread his lips, and Cas was still frozen, still processing.
He walked back to the road and found a decent sized brick. He flung that into the cliff, but it bounced off just as easily as the bullet. He didn’t know what he was expecting.
Crowley was seated behind a large mahogany desk. Sam and Dean sat in two chairs in front of him. Their chairs were shorter than his, so they had to look up to him.
Sam moved out and bought an apartment in Sioux Falls with Eileen. They hunted together now, sometimes, but mostly they worked on designing a new system of connecting hunters in America. It would be digital, innovative, collaborative, and since it was headed by Sam and Eileen, Dean knew it would also be successful.
Inias knocked on Cas’ door with a secret smile. Cas smiled back and let him inside. He closed the door behind him and meant to lock it, but Inias was taking off his shirt, so the door was quickly forgotten.
He put a hand on the rock and tried to think happy thoughts. He got halfway through a verse of “Happy and you Know it” when he stepped back and scowled. This was stupid, and getting him nowhere.
Cas’s relationship with Claire was, to put it simply, complicated, but he’d always cared for Claire as a daughter. He completely trusted her, and he hoped by now she trusted him. Perhaps that’s why he found this news particularly shocking.
“Lawrence is like the opposite of California,” Cas said, “but it has its own charm. And cheaper real estate.” She chuckled.
“How could you not get in? What are looking for, freaking Shakespeare? Actually, no, your stuff is better than his. You would never write something that ends in a double suicide, like a total cop out—”
“We should be asking more important questions—such as, when are you chumps going to pay me? I totally called April.”
“Sam and Eileen moved out of Westview,” Dean said and then quickly added, “I think we both learned a valuable lesson today.”
Sam was smiling with tears in his eyes, and he pulled Dean and Cas into a giant hug. Dean couldn’t breathe. Cas narrowed his eyes.
Cas was at the kitchen table, with a cup of coffee. Jack sat in the chair next to him, on his booster seat.
“I don’t know about that. But I’ll apply again, and maybe to a few other programs too, just in case. It would mean leaving Lawrence for five years, but I think we could make it work. Then after, I could teach anywhere I wanted. There are colleges everywhere.”
But did Cas know? Would he bring it up tonight? Was this dinner a chance for him to let Dean down easy? Dean had deluded himself a lot in the past, but he couldn’t fool himself into thinking Cas would feel the same. Dean remembered the way he smiled at him when he said
“Wow. Uh- good. Great. That was great, and I want to continue that,” Dean said, pulling away again, “But can we get out of here finally? The staircase is a bitch, unless you’ve seen an escalator around here.”
Cas was a mess. The audience sounded deeply amused, from the way his hair was sticking up in every direction, to the flour smeared on his forehead, to his frilly apron covered in stains.
Whatever the problem, they would just keep trying until it worked. And in the meantime, Dean would keep researching. Another old book, another fringe website, until he could get to Cas. There was nothing he’d rather do. He looked at Sam.
Chad blew out a deep breath, “I’ll text Castiel tomorrow and say I forgive him for the drugs or something. Maybe I could go on another date with Jack.”
Cas stared at Dean with a furrowed brow. Dean pushed the plate to the center of the table, but no one reached for a burger. The air was tense. Not even Gabriel wanted to break this silence.
“You’d have to ask him. It was time for me to move out, okay? Look Sammy, I’m glad you’re home but can we postpone this reunion ‘til breakfast?”
The first time they’d tried the ritual, they’d been missing a few crucial elements. Shannon had found, in her research, that much like the myth, the ritual required someone to place their hand in the center of the Joyous Discus. And, as Kelly had discovered from a slightly different translation of the myth, the “lost soul” had to think happy thoughts to power the Discus.
“I just want to help Jack, but all of these books make it sound so complicated. And they don’t take into account his unusual circumstances.”
“No,” Cas glared, “I met a young man at Wichita State University who was fundraising for his fraternity, and after I explained the situation, and donated to a worthy cause, he agreed to go on a first date with Jack. A first date that we are in danger of showing up late to.”
Dean followed the light through the city until he pulled the impala into the parking lot of a used car dealership.
Sam didn’t say anything. He kicked the sugar on the ground with the side of his foot, breaking the circle, and started gathering up the rest of the supplies. His mind started racing with new ideas they could try. Next time he’d get Tahitian vanilla.
“It doesn’t matter what happened, because Dean and I are done. It doesn’t matter why. Friendships don’t last. People change. We’re not going to live together, and we’re not going to talk about it, so neither should you.”
Sam thought about it. Dean wanted to stop thinking about it, so he flipped the radio back on. Sam side eyed him.
“I know that you. . .” Cas took a deep breath. He started again, “I know that you would be better off without me. As would Sam, and the rest of the world.”
Jody broke the silence, and suddenly everyone was talking. The first thing Dean felt when he entered the bar was guilt. It was hard not to, seeing everyone they couldn’t save in one room. But as Jo wrapped him in a hug, and Missouri handed him a beer, he pushed his guilt away. They were all here, really here. Jack brought them back, gave them all a second chance at life. Things were okay. It was all smiles and excitement and people asking what happened since they died. Dean’s cheeks start to hurt from smiling too much.
That night, Dean still hadn’t heard from Cas. He forced himself to go to sleep and told himself Cas was with Jack. Jack was like a son to him. It made sense. He needed family time, time to sort things out. Maybe Cas was visiting heaven.
“What are you doing?” Cas asked. Jack paled at Cas’s furious tone. He looked from Cas to Dean to Cas.
Cas looked at Dean. He tried not to look too hopeful. “A hunting team, a married couple, in Chicago were killed on the job. They left behind children. The children are staying with some hunters in Chicago, but they want to put them into foster care soon. Logan is friends with one of the hunters. That’s how I found out.”
Cas looked anxious. “I’m afraid today was much harder than I anticipated. For dinner you can chose between charred remains of chicken or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I tried to bake a pie but. . . it’s currently collapsed on the bottom of our oven. I tried to clean, but—”
Sam took a deep breath, “Look, we can make some calls tonight, see if anyone else has seen him. And we can ask someone to stay here when we leave, just in case Cas shows up.” He put a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “We’ll find him. And I’m sure wherever he is right now, he’s safe.”
At the table, Jo was telling Eileen and Charlie her favorite Sam stories. Garth and Lisa were bonding over their favorite show, Dr. Sexy. Gabriel thought it was overrated, but he still watched every episode and chimed in with his fan theories. Then Gabriel saw Cas and Dean leave the kitchen, and he waved them over. He still had a bet to settle.
Sam followed the sound of the kid crying, into the first open door. In the window, another masked man in black had a six-year-old boy in his arms. Sam grabbed the vampire and pulled him back into the room, but the vampire kept his grip tight on the kid, as a sort of shield. Sam hesitated, and that was the only opening the vampire needed. He lunged toward the open window and jumped into the night.
“Eileen once showed up to the bunker as a ghost. Sam has died seven times, literally been to hell and back, and he’s still afraid of clowns. You think that’s normal? It ain’t. And me—  I’m afraid of airplanes. I love soap operas. The longest relationship I’ve ever had lasted a year. I have two Taylor Swift CDs carefully hidden in my car— and why? The only person around here who gives a shit about that is me, so why is it so hard for me to admit that I like her stupid music?”
“I was trying to lookout for you, Cas. You always like the shittiest guys who don’t deserve you. Crowley used to make you write his essays.”
Cas had to navigate his first relationship alone. Who could he tell? Michael was just as deeply religious as their parents had been, Gabriel was too busy going to parties or fighting with Michael about going to parties, Anna was in middle school, and Dean. . . he had no idea how Dean would react.
“Bro, I got the anti-Christ to use his powers in front of me. He changed the molecular structure of a milkshake, several times in a row, just by touching it. Dude didn’t even seem tired.”
“How could that have been worse?” Cas raised his head and stared out the windshield. It was too cloudy to see any stars. It made the car feel small, like a child’s toy abandoned in tall grass.
On Christmas eve, Shannon invited Sam, Logan, Malia, and Kelly to the house for Christmas movies and dinner. Sam brought ingredients for gingerbread making, and they all learned none of them had ever made gingerbread before. The first batch came out totally flat, but in the second batch they added baking powder and they came out a lot more edible. Even after Henry bit most of the heads off.
“Yeah, for sure,” Chad said, with a voice that sounded perpetually stoned. Or maybe he was just stoned.
So for now, it was just an investigation. He was on a mission to learn everything he could about the anti-Christ, his strengths, his weaknesses.
Claire moved into an apartment with Kaia, in the town nearest to the bunker. They were Cas and Dean’s go-to babysitters, and Jack loved them. Claire was basically his sister, but Cas and Claire never really talked about it. She didn’t call him Dad, but Dean hadn’t called Bobby ‘Dad’ either.
Chad smiled his same, blissed out smile. Jack’s smile seemed a little strained. Not that Cas noticed. Dean led them out the backdoor, into a brick alley which was covered in faded graffiti and sprinkled with smashed glass bottles and cigarette butts.
He prayed to Cas again that night. Then he prayed to Jack. And Gabriel. Everyone and anyone he could think of.
“Hey, Cas, it’s me. Duh.” He cleared his throat, “I just wanted to check in, again, and see if you were coming back. When I call your normal phone, it goes straight to voice mail, but maybe Jack didn’t revive your phone when he revived you.”
“Dean.” Cas stepped out of his reach, and gave him a level look, “It’s for the best if I remain here. But you need to go, have a long, peaceful life. It’s what I wanted for you.”
Cas leaned toward him suddenly, so their faces were only an inch apart. Dean inhaled sharply. They looked into each other’s eyes, and then Cas slowly smiled. Dean smiled back and reached for Cas’s hand. Cas let him.
After the diner, Chad walked to the nearest park. He sat on a bench, made himself comfortable, and then looked up at the night sky. He wanted to see what stars looked like from Earth, but it was too cloudy. He sat and stared anyway. His iPhone started ringing. Of course, this phone belonged to his vessel, so the ringtone was Sicko Mode by Travis Scott.
“Henry,” she fell to her knees and pulled her son into a huge hug. She looked up at Sam and Dean, “Thank you. How can I thank you?”
That night, Sam drove himself and Shannon to their honeymoon in California, while Cas and Dean drove toward Chicago. Their cars were headed in different directions, but both would be back. And their family would only continue to grow.
Cas pushed open the door of The Human Bean and a little bell jingled above his head. Jack walked in after him, eyeing the shop carefully.
Sam gestured for him to ‘wait’ and pulled out his phone. Dean tapped his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel. Sam suddenly smiled and started talking animatedly. Dean jumped out of the car, wondering who the hell Sam was talking to.
“No, you’re right Cas, you should move out. It makes sense. And don’t you worry about me, I won’t have any trouble finding someone to move in. Lots of people would love to stay with me.”
“No. You were right. I live in a fantasy world. That’s why I slept with you. I looked at you and saw what I wanted to see. That’s who I was in love with. Fantasy you. That’s who I was friends with. I deluded myself for years obviously, because the real you is a selfish asshole who isn’t worth my time. And you know what? My life would be so much better if you were out of it. I think all of our lives would be.”
“I assure you it was. Major crap. Grade A bullshit. ‘Reflecting on life’ and what ‘you deserve’? That’s such bullshit. You’re freaking scared.”
Dean did not understand, like at all. He was still processing Jack as God, and now there was also Jack as a human baby? But if there was one thing Dean was good at, it was taking supernatural bullshit in stride.
But Dean didn’t know what to do. This stupid cliffside was the only thing around, and there were suspicious sounds inside, but how was he supposed to break through? Claw through the rock until his fingers were nubs? He’d given so much of himself, for his family, for the world, for Sam.
“I didn’t… ” Dean tensed and locked eyes on the champagne. “I came in here to get a bottle of champagne.”
Sometimes, being Jack’s father was difficult. Mostly because Cas could not rely on the many parenting books he’d picked up over the years. Jack was a man, but only a few years old, but also an unfathomably powerful king of hell. Cas had yet to find a parenting book that covered all of that, but he had a notebook where he liked to write down helpful paragraphs.
“Dean, you don’t know what you’re saying,” Cas said holding the hand Dean had touched close to his chest, “You would be much better off without me. You could do anything you wanted now— you could go back to hunting, normal cases, with Sam. You could open-up a bar for hunters. You could retire in Hawaii. You don’t need me.”
Dean woke up first. He carefully scooted out from underneath Cas’s arm. Cas rolled over and buried his head in his pillow as Dean gently closed the door behind him.
“Nosy? You practically shoved it in my face for years, and I never asked questions. I never brought it up. But you know I support you, right? Gay, bi, or whatever. And Cas, too. You guys are good for each other. I should go tell him.”
“Getting to Cas was the hard part,” Dean said, accepting a drink. “Really hard. But once I found him, it was no problem. Jack made him a door, and that took us to your damn linen closet.”
“Caaaas, I’m home,” he called. He heard footsteps, and suddenly Cas burst into the kitchen from the living room door. Dean’s jaw dropped.
Jack said he brought everyone back, so Dean wasn’t that worried. He wasn’t sure what Jack had meant by “everyone”, but when he asked, Jack refused to answer (clearly, he was ready to be God). Still, Cas would be the first on Jack’s list to bring back. Dean wasn’t that worried about it.
Sam went to watch Shannon’s lecture series at the local museum, and Logan, Malia, and Kelly invited themselves along. When he pulled Shannon into a congratulatory hug, the three shared a knowing look.
“I’m being honest,” Dean lied. “You just don’t want to hear it. You walk around in a fantasy world where you only see what you want to see.”
Sam gave him a look, like Dean was sitting on a pile of bullshit, but then Eileen yawned and they all said goodnight. He successfully avoided another terrible game of 20 questions with Sammy. Until it was time for Sam, Eileen, Bobby, and Dean to sit down for breakfast.
Sam stood, “My brother and I are collectors. He’s really passionate about the Joyous Discus. We appreciate you tracking us down.”
Dean scrambled to the rock, and inspected it. The knob had gone straight through. It created a small hole. He poked a finger into the hole, and brought it back unharmed. He looked through it. The other side was all oranges and reds. The sound of fire was even louder. Was that what the
Sam and Eileen shared a glance. They had wondered why Dean and Cas made such a last-minute visit. They normally called ahead of time, until it was something urgent, something like a case.
Last night, Cas choosing him over Brown seemed like a big romantic gesture. In the harsh morning light he saw it for what it was. A stupid, crazy, reckless decision that blew up in his face because Dean didn’t even last two years. Cas loved Brown. It had been his dream. And he threw it away for Dean, who of course found a way to ruin it.
Dean and Cas were in charge of food and dessert this year. Cas bought a cake from Costco, and Dean made burgers and let Cas pop the champagne. This time, they toasted to Sam’s successful first year of law school, though Dean also added a toast to Cas’s Stanford acceptance. They decided they’d try long distance at first, but Dean would check out the job situation when he came to visit.
Inias cursed and Cas promised he’d swear him to secrecy. When Cas left Inias was furiously trying to comb through his hair with a pissed off expression. He always knew their relationship wasn’t going to be forever, but he wished it didn’t have to end like this.
Charlie was in his kitchen, searching his cabinets for something sugary for breakfast. She made the drive from Illinois last night. He needed reinforcements if he was going to get through Sam’s party tonight, and Charlie always knew how to make him feel better.
“Once they meet you, they’ll be begging you to join their classes. Maybe you could still go this fall.”
Gabriel and Anna looked shocked. Garth processed this, then leaned back in his chair with an amused look.
The worst part was, Dean knew it was true. But that didn’t mean he had to stick around and take it. He turned away from Cas and stormed toward the door.
“Yes,” Cas said, gratefully, “I’ve been talking with Charlie about taking a road trip this summer to California.”
“I’m so happy you’re back,” Shannon hugged Dean and Cas tightly, and then stepped back to introduce herself to Cas. She’s already heard most of the stories, so she loved him already. Henry was running in circle, already hyped up on Halloween candy. Sam texted Logan, Malia, and Kelly the news, though the three were out on a hunt.
“Should I have done that to Jack? To Claire? What if Sam came out to you when he was seventeen? Would you have said nothing and sent him on a case? Made him risk his life, terrified and alone?”
Inias was a hot baseball player who volunteered at the Lawrence Public Library. Cas volunteered there too.
Cas thought about what Dean had said. When he first came to the Empty, to this cold concrete cell, he was happy because the Empty was not the worst ending he could imagine. Dean hating him, Dean hurting because of him, that was far worse than any damnation the Empty could conjure. But now, staring into Dean’s bright green eyes, Dean’s lovely smile, Cas imagined a million new endings. Maybe that was the real horror of the Empty. It was a plain, grey room forever. He had already gotten too comfortable here. He forgot that while free will meant he could choose to avoid risk, it also meant he could choose risk. A chance to have a relationship with Dean was worth the risk. A chance to see Dean smile again was worth the risk.
Sam and Eileen were at a table with Jo, Garth, Anna, and Gabriel. Everyone had a drink, but dinner wasn’t ready yet. Dean was finishing up in the kitchen. Cas hadn’t shown up yet.
“I don’t know,” Cas picked up the nearest book and shoved it toward Dean, “neither does Barbara Crane, despite her Ph.D. in child psychology and well-adjusted bisexual daughter.”
“You know I want this, Cas. We’ve talked about that much. But we’re a team. If you want to wait, we can wait.”
Sam did not say the incantation, this time. Kelly had looked it over and realized the incantation was actually a part of an ancient Mayan recipe. He’d basically been reading out loud the importance of preheating your firepit. No need for any sort of ancient words. Now, all they needed was Dean.
The drive was tense. No music. No talking, no matter how hard Sam was side eyeing him. Obviously, Sam had questions, probably starting with ‘do you know why Cas doesn’t want to see you?’ and ending with ‘are you in love with Cas or something?’
Dean pressed harder on the gas. This was why he wanted to get home as soon as possible, so he could stop overthinking. His jeans were stained with sewer water and vampire guts, the fumes were probably making his thoughts spiral.
Cas was struck with a realization. Maybe Jack would like to call her. Jack wasn’t saying anything. Should Cas be saying something? It took all of Cas’s willpower to not jump out of his chair and fly to his parenting books. He’d read chapters about “Your child and dating” but he never took notes on those sections, and now here he was, horribly unprepared.
“I just wanted to give ‘em some space. C’mon, you’re a smart kid. You really think they’ll be comin’ back here tonight?”
“Good,” Sam smiled. Then he snapped his fingers like he just got an idea, “Hey, I know. You should come by tonight around eight, so Dean has a chance to apologize. I’m sure he’d ask you over himself, but he’s way too insecure to initiate anything.”
“Oh my god,” Cas covered his face, partially because it looked like Dean’s weird obsession with finding him a date wasn’t going to stop, and partially because he couldn’t stop smiling.
Cas stood in the doorway. He was dressed in a similar fashion, a collared shirt, a tie, but his suit jacket was on. He also had a hat in one hand and a briefcase in the other. Dean exhaled into a smile.
It was different though, with Jack. Jack wasn’t smiling back the way Dean did. Jack had no idea what it meant. And now he was looking at Castiel for answers.
“No.” Cas turned back, so he was facing away from Dean as he said, “I’m not going. You should leave.”
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Dean said incredulous, “You, what? Wanted me to think you were dead? Are you mad at me?”
“I need to crash here for a while,” Dean said then quickly circled back to, “Goddamn, did you pack your entire brick collection in that thing?”
“You lied first, Dean. And why? Why would you tell him we were dating if you don’t want to date me?”
“You know I’ve never talked about that hunt before,” Dean started to ramble, “I don’t think Sam even noticed I was gone that night. Or he probably thought I was out at a bar or something for my birthday. So don’t go bringing it up around him or anything, he’d probably start psychoanalyzing the shit out of—”
“Farm full of haystacks and the kid goes for the shit,” Dean mumbled under his breath as they walked back to the car.
He couldn’t let Cas choose him again. He couldn’t be the reason Cas gave up another dream. He wasn’t worth it. And maybe Cas thought he was now, but in a few years, he’d realize Dean just held him back. Cas would resent him. Cas would hate him. And it would be too late to fix things.
“Where is he, then?” Dean said, with a sharpness that made Sam pause. Dean huffed. He hadn’t meant to sound so angry. He wasn’t even angry, not really. He was scared. Dean didn’t say any of that. But Sam slowly nodded anyway.
“You’ll be there, right?” Sam asked. Cas was family. Clearly he and Dean were in the middle of a fight, but Sam was sure they’d get over it soon enough. They always did. Dean was miserable when they fought. He just wished he knew what happened, so he could help. Maybe he should call Anna.
“All good. I just wanted to give the lady the option. Seriously, I’d be fine out here. The couch is great when I’m not being physically assaulted.”
“Uh, terrifying,” Sam said, sliding into the chair next to him, “It’s the hardest year academically. I’m actually here to get a head start on the SATs. Dean said you got almost a perfect score.”
Something seemed to click for Sam, then. Like something he’d always wondered about had just been confirmed. He took a deep breath.
Dean closed the refrigerator. He sort of laughed, but trailed off when he glanced back at Cas’ strained expression.
“Did he tell you what their fight was about?” Gabriel asked, “Because if my sweet, innocent brother is out there being taken advantage of, I think I deserve to know. And did it happen in April?”
“It was torn up,” Dean continued, “Into tiny pieces, so I know you were mad when you did it. And the night before, Gabriel told me you turned down Brown to follow me. Which ended up being a big mistake because I screwed up and left after a year. So when I found your Stanford thing, I figured you decided not to apply so you could stay here. With me.”
They all noticed Cas at the same time. He was wearing a white button-up, the top two buttons undone, and navy slacks. Standing next to him was Charlie, his friend from college they’d all met a few times. Sam stood.
They both ended up at Illinois State College. Nobody was surprised about Dean— they had a decent engineering program, and it was the only school he applied to. Cas, on the other hand, had been daydreaming about Brown University, and their English program, for years. When it came time to decide he knew he’d be happier in Illinois. Of course he told Dean he’d been rejected from Brown. It was easier that way.
“I don’t know. But they’ve been exposed to the supernatural. They need a home— at least a foster one. I guess I just thought, since you hurt your knee on our last case, maybe you wanted to spend some more time at home. . . and. . . I don’t know.”
The best part was, he knew Cas felt the same. Last night had been amazing. Now they could bypass all the awkward beginning parts of a relationship and skip to the part where they lived together and had great sex and Dean cooked breakfast and Cas introduced him as ‘my boyfriend’.
Sam sat back in his seat. Green fields passed by their windows in a blur, and outside their windshield was nothing but bright blue sky and open road. Dean hated it.
“She will be,” Dean said picking her up gently. He knew she would be okay physically, it didn’t look like she’d been bitten. But her husband was gone. Her kid was gone.
Cas’s gaze dropped to the ground, and Dean stepped even closer. He studied him carefully, but really the wrinkled clothes gave it away.
“Dean, hi. I don’t know if you remember me. I’m Shannon Blight. My son, Henry, told me you needed this. You took the one from our living room, but the real piece was in storage.”
He dropped the plate on the table and slid into the last empty seat, next to Sam, and across from Cas.
When Sam returned to the bunker that night, Logan and Malia took one look at his sappy smile and handed Kelly twenty bucks.
“And if you’re going to blame me, pull over now. I’ll just walk home. I’m sure Sam will understand—”
“No.” Dean stepped in front of Cas so they were face to face. “This isn’t rebellion. And don’t bring free will into this. I’ll respect your choices, whatever, but you have to respect mine. I’ve searched for weeks, stopped hunting, trashed the impala, and I’d do it all again, for as long as it took, until I found you. Because you’re worth it.”
Well, he cared. The impala meant a lot to him over the years. It was his baby, it was his home, and it had been for years. But all he could think about, staring at the small plastic knob in his hand, was how he’d take a sledgehammer to the whole dashboard if it meant he could see Cas again.
“Dean!” she squealed through the phone, “Oh my god. Sam was just catching me up. Sorry I didn’t call you guys sooner, I’ve just been getting used to life again in South Dakota. A bunch of us are at a bar right now, and Kevin is trying to pirate some movies—”
He pulled up to the bunker just before 5. Cas and Jack were waiting outside, ready to jump into the impala as soon as he came to a complete stop.
Dean’s smile turned into a chuckle, and now Cas was really worried. Was this a mental breakdown? Cas hesitated, wanting to pull Dean into a hug but knowing it’s the last thing he should do.
Dean froze. Then he got a hold of himself. Of course. He should have suspected the Empty would be full of tricks. He’d rushed in without a weapon but he slowly walked toward quote unquote Cas with his fists raised.
“Dean, we don’t exactly know what we’re looking for either,” Sam said. “We need to find out everything we can about the Empty, about the ritual, and about the Joyous Discus. Three extra readers would help.”
Cas wasn’t at the bunker, when he and Sam first got back, but maybe he was hanging out with Jack one last time. Maybe Jack had brought Cas back to life at a luxury resort, and he wanted to check out the sauna before calling Dean. Fine. That was fine. It was only the first day, Cas would probably roll up to the bunker in time for breakfast tomorrow.
“I think we each learned a valuable lesson today,” Cas said. Then he lowered his eyes, a troubled crease appearing between his eyebrows. “Where are Sam and Eileen?”
“I don’t want to hear your excuses. I know being my father is difficult. I know I’m not normal— but I didn’t know how much you wish I was. That’s why you hired that normal human to date me, right? Because if you had a normal child, they’d be dating and going to college and you wouldn’t have to waste your time teaching them to be human like everybody else.” Jack took a deep breath, but it sounded shaky, “I’m sorry that I can’t be normal. I’m sorry I can’t be the child you want.”
“I’m his father,” Cas narrowed his eyes. “And the one thing these books understand is that he needs support. He has no experience, Dean. And just because you’ve never had a problem sleeping with civilians doesn’t mean Jack won’t face problems. Things will be different for him.”
“Thank you very much. When do we start?” Dean held out a hand, and Crowley shook it with a slight sneer.
Jack had a milkshake in hand. Every time he tapped his pointer finger against the glass, the flavor of the milkshake changed. Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and then to red, to green, to black. Chad was enraptured, staring opened mouthed and wide eyed.
okay ONE more chapter after this :) Thanks to everyone who leaves kudos and comments, you're the best! I hope you enjoy this chapter!
But he couldn’t sacrifice himself to solve this. And for the first time in his life, he didn’t want to.
“Sam! The ‘andy!” Dean said around his mouthful of chocolates. He gave him an incredulous look and stepped away from the conveyor belt.
Cas followed Gabriel to their seats but he couldn’t look away from Dean. He’d put on court clothes too, a button-down and slacks, and his green eyes were the brightest thing in the room. Dean gave him an encouraging nod, and Cas took his hands out of his pockets. They weren’t shaking anymore.
That fight could be blamed on miscommunication. Their next fight, sophomore year of college, could only be blamed on Dean.
Cas stayed up all night, sitting on the couch with a cup of tea that he forgot to drink. He looked back on their years of friendship, trying to make sense of his feelings. Was he really in love with him? Maybe it was a temporary moment of insanity. He didn’t date or hook up with people. Maybe he was just lonely, and Dean was just there.
“I stood outside your dorm for hours. I was scared you’d tell me to get lost, and that’d be it.” Dean looked at his beer, “I don’t know what I would have done without you. I guess I wanted to say thanks. For always being there. Even when you had every right to tell me to get lost.”
A beam of bright white light split the sky, and Dean inhaled sharply. He pulled the car to the side of the road, and stared, transfixed at the light. Then, the light started to move in slow circles, and Dean realized what it was. A searchlight, like the bat signal, that were used sometimes at movie premieres and to promote businesses.
He sat up just enough to reach his bedside lamp and turned it on. Nothing happened. He tried turning it on again, and again, but no light. The lamp was broken. Of course it was. Because why would anything in Dean’s life actually work? He picked it up and threw it across the room. He stared at the lamp, bent and broken on the ground, and realized it probably just needed a new bulb. Dean didn’t think about it.
“He said, ‘hello, Sam. This is Cas. I am safe, but promise me you won’t tell Dean I called you.’ and then he just kept saying ‘promise me’ no matter what I said, so I promised him, and he hung up.”
“You. . .” Cas studied every inch of his face, but only saw desperate sincerity. Dean reached forward and grabbed Cas’s hand, pulling them closer together.
He was so happy he basically floated to the kitchen. Dean was eating a plate of eggs in a grey Metallica shirt and sweatpants. Cas smiled at him, but he didn’t look up from his plate. That was the second red flag. Cas was hungry, but he glanced toward the stove and saw that the pan of eggs was scrapped clean.
“Nothing,” said Cas, “I just meant, I know your father frequently left you alone, forcing you to watch Sam on your own. Just because that was how you were raised—”
They stared. Champagne dripped down the bottle, over Dean’s hand, and onto the floor but he barely noticed.
“You are going to pick up the candy as it comes, wrap it, and place it back on the conveyer belt. Not too much of a hassle if you ask me. Now,” she held up her pointer finger. Sam and Dean gave her their full attention.
Dean blinked and refocused on the book. It didn’t matter what Sam could do. They’d just finished saving the world, killing God, and it was time for a damn happy ending. Sam deserved it. If he wanted to do some case in Pittsburg, whatever, Dean could do his secret research just as easily there as in the bunker.
Finally he found the paper he was looking for and pulled it from the stack. He pulled a wooden stamp from his desk drawer and stamped the paper twice. Then he gave the boys a thin smile.
“Right. Thanks, little dude. Sam was never afraid to go after what he wanted. And when he wanted something, he wanted it with everything. With his whole heart. And let me tell you, big guy, even bigger heart. Shannon, I see that in you too. You’re a dedicated friend, mother, professor. You’re the funniest in the family, and also the smartest. You make loving people look easy, which takes a special sort of heart. And yes— sorry, Sam, but I had a few shots before I got up here. This shit is hard to say,” the audience laughed.
She folded her arms, “I guess…I always knew Jody was cool with it. But when I first started talking with Kaia, Jody was always willing to listen to me freak out and overanalyze shit. I guess that’s when I really realized Jody was, like, the best… is that helpful?”
If Sam was here, he’d already have a plan, and three backup plans. Still, Dean was sort of glad Sam got left behind. Dean would figure this out of his own, save Cas, and when they got back maybe Sam would have a happy ending of his own. He deserved it. Dean suddenly realized he had no idea what Sam’s version of a happy ending was. Probably not law school, but who knew? Dean knew one thing his happy ending needed, and he was currently trapped in super hell.
As soon as Sam finished patching up Dean, they started looking for the kid. Eventually they found him, hiding behind a hay stack in the horses stable. With a horse. Dean leaned against the door outside to avoid the smell of horse shit, while Sam gently tried to coax the kid to come out.
The table was in shocked silence. Sam choked. Anna gasped. Lisa looked at Laura for answers. Charlie winced. Jo kept looking between Dean and Cas. Eileen blinked. Garth smiled encouragingly.
Cas’s careful blank expression broke. Now Dean was mad at himself. He didn’t mean it, the way it sounded, bitter and mocking. The whole point of this conversation was to tell Cas how he felt, but why was that so impossibly difficult? It was just three words.
“Might as well give her a chance,” Dean shrugged. She was hot and he had no problem with first dates. Multiple dates, that’s when shit got complicated.
“If anyone deserves to relax, it’s me and Cas. It’s much harder to work a 9 to 5 than it is to do housework. Maybe we should make a wager to settle this matter once and for all,” Eileen said from the kitchen chair next to Sam. Her hair was in an updo, with curls tightly pinned into place. She had a string of pearls and a dark dress with a sweetheart neckline. Cas hadn’t noticed her either. He glanced down at his plate. Maybe he needed to eat something.
“I figured,” said Sam. He glanced at Dean, who was looking around the room like Jack might pop up behind the couch.
“Well, I don’t know if…” Sam started, but looking into her kind eyes made him pause. She’d just lost her husband, survived a vampire attack, almost lost her child. But no—he needed to turn her away. She shouldn’t be exposed to this world anymore than she already had been.
“Uh,” Dean laughed, “No, I don’t believe in an old guy with a beard on a cloud somewhere. That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. I think Santa is more believable. Someone did tell you the truth about Santa, right?”
“I found what they were tied to eventually, after they threw me around for a while, busted me up pretty good. Like I said, first solo hunt. But I figured out they were still tied to this old photograph. It was the two of them together, looking like a scene from the Sound of Music. The color was faded, but they were in the middle of this garden. Sort of smiling.”
Dean dropped his gaze to their hands, entwined. Cas flushed and wondered if he should pull away. He got his answer when Dean’s started moving his thumb back and forth slowly against the back of his hand.
“Of course,” Jack said but Cas didn’t believe him. He felt another twist of pain since apparently Jack had gotten used to lying to him.
“Yeah, whatever, the anti-Christ,” Chad heard the voice take a deep breath, probably gearing up for another lecture, so he ended the call.
Cas told himself he was just overthinking things. He slept with his best friend last night, surely his brain was still processing. Maybe Dean was still processing, too. He’d never even talked about liking men before, so he probably had a lot more to process. He sat down at the table, and Dean finally looked at him. Cas smiled.
“Oh, yeah,” Frankie nodded, all nervous energy. Dean was having a hard time believing this kid could hold a gun, much less shoot one, “Yeah. Sometimes. Is Jack with you?”
“Poop guy!” Henry popped out from underneath the table and ran at Dean. Dean ignored the kid and turned to Sam.
wished Dad could hear this. This was like twelve layers of irony wrapped around a special middle finger just for him.
“Or maybe we could order pizza,” Eileen said. Then she smirked, “IF, Dean tells me what his favorite Taylor Swift albums are.”
“Yeah, really,” Dean glanced at him, “We need champagne. Next week Sammy graduates. And then next year, he starts law school. You know, Stanford Law School. At Stanford. That’s in California. You know how long that drive is? 23 hours.”
Cas felt like someone was wringing his insides like a washcloth. Dean was his best friend. He’d told himself not to get his hopes up, but clearly his hopes had been sky high that Dean would accept him. Now they were crashing down into the burning garbage that was his life.
Cas raised his eyebrows. They figured out pretty quickly that their younger siblings had tried to parent trap them. Dean made a joke and Cas laughed and then somehow everything was back to normal.
“Be glad you weren’t. I’m an ugly crier,” Dean joked but Cas could see the sincerity in his expression. It wasn’t an easy memory to relive, but he’d done it because he thought it might help. They were still holding hands.
Dean picked up his menu and studied it. He’d rather memorize the milkshake selection than watch this painful season premiere of the bachelor.
Dean sort of smiled and Cas sort of smiled back. Cas looked toward Dean’s car, parked in the same spot it had been that night, and decided he owed Dean an explanation. At least.
“I won’t stop him from dating, but I still want to make sure he’s safe. From what I’ve observed, there are many people on Earth who do not accept homosexuality. I’ve done some reading recently and discovered some troubling statistics. Many young LGBT+ people grow up feeling isolated and alone. How could I best protect Jack from that?”
The audience cheered, and Sam and Shannon were already out of the seats, ready to rush Dean with a hug. Henry was right behind them.
He raced to the kitchen, but Sam wasn’t there. He headed to the library next, but heard Sam before he saw him.
Cas felt like a huge weight was lifted off his chest. He was almost smiling. Moments before he was convinced he’d never smile again, convinced that he’d lost Jack for good.
“I applied for their English Ph.D. program last winter and I heard back in March. I didn’t tell anyone I applied because I wasn’t sure I’d get in. And I didn’t.”
Dean and Sam looked at each other. A kid started to wail, and Dean and Sam ran up the stairs as fast as they could. Dean clutched the plate in one hand.
Sam and Eileen pulled up a few minutes later with pizza for everyone. Claire and Kaia didn’t get home until after they’d eaten, and they brought a friend. He had curly hair shoved under a beanie and wore a flannel over his sweatshirt. Jody introduced him to Dean and Cas as Frankie.
“Dean,” Sam turned fully in his seat now, “I think I deserve to know what’s going on. I’ve been with you and Cas every step of the way. If something happened between you, I think I should know.”
Dean kept his face perfectly neutral. The good thing about Bobby was that he didn’t ask stupid question like ‘is Cas okay?’ Cas was probably just fine. Which was fine, because Dean was fine too. He’d be even more fine when Sam got off his back.
“I’m president of Pi Kappa Alpha,” Chad said, “so I always throw the parties. I have to get the kegger, but it’s no problem to haul in my Chevy. Uh… when I’m not at a party, I’m at the gym. I bet, uh, I bet you work out Jack. Because you’re so hot.”
“No,” Cas said, again. He took a deep breath, “She wants you to call her for personal reasons. She likes you and wants you to ask her on romantic date.”
But first, he wanted to go back to the campus where he “ran into” Castiel. He’d find that blue haired guy and ask him for tips.
The radio was still busted but Carry On my Wayward Son was blasting from somewhere as Dean kissed his baby goodbye. The key was in the ignition and the impala was 20 feet from the cliff. He put it into drive and dropped the big brick on the gas pedal. The impala took off, straight toward the rocky cliff.
He got hung up on the word home. They’d called the bunker home for a while but it was still freshly weird to see it written, to know Cas was the one who typed it. It was their home, and Cas wanted him there by 5. He was so hung up it took him a while to register the rest of the text.
“Nothing,” Dean said, “because he was immediately sent to super hell, like he knew he would be. And now. . .”
They had both left the circle of light far behind them. Now they were close to the back doors of the car dealership, in dim, blue light. There were bushes on either side of the door.
They lived together first, and then started dating, and now Cas would be moving out. They did everything backwards, but they were happy.
Dean inhaled like his lungs were filled with smoke. He felt like a part of him would always be living in this exact moment. The sun, just starting to set behind Cas, the sky, a watercolor of purple and orange. Cas’s hair pushed off his forehead by the wind, his brilliant blue eyes looking at Dean as if everything was fine, as if he hadn’t just poured gasoline on Dean’s dreams and dropped a match.
On the other side of the rock was a room on fire. Dean felt like he was back in Hell. He looked over the pitchforks and brimstone, searching for any sign of Cas. He avoided the flames, and the falling pieces of burning coal, until he finally found a doorway. He ran to it and then skidded to a stop. On the other side of the door was a long staircase leading down.
He’d come to terms with his bisexuality sophomore year of college, when he left Cas and moved in with a guy named Benny. They quickly started a roommates-with-benefits situation. But he didn’t exactly go around telling people, not even Cas. He didn’t want anyone to think of him differently, even though he knew they would support him, whatever. It was just something he’d rather not talk about.
Dean grabbed Cas by the shoulder and forced him to stand and face him. Cas let himself be pushed around. He faced Dean with a vacant expression.
Cas regretted it as soon as the stupid words left his mouth. Maybe it wasn’t too late to patch things up. He could go apologize to Dean and then maybe things would go back to the way they were.
“I invited someone special to join us for dinner at Ed’s, and I don’t want to keep him waiting. Please, your clothes will be fine. You look good no matter what you’re—”
“Good morning,” Cas said making sure the muffins were on full display. “Would you like some breakfast? Muffin? Coffee?”
Green eyes stared back at him. He leaned a little closer to the glass. Sometimes it felt like he didn’t know himself at all. Maybe that was a common problem for people who’d been used as vessels. He’d ask Sam, but that would lead down an emotional line of questioning that led to scary things, like tears or honest conversations. He’d ask Cas, but vessels were a sensitive topic.
“There is no Pittsburg hunt, I just needed to get to the museum,” Sam said, “and I think I have an idea of where the other two pieces could be.”
Sam wasn’t tearing up and/or pelting him with a million questions about his feelings, so obviously Cas didn’t tell him what really happened. Dean was relieved, but surprised. Cas hated him now, but he was still kind enough to let him come out in his own way. Or maybe Cas hated him so much, he refused to speak his name. Or maybe Cas was already over the fight. Maybe the fight was the best thing that ever happened to him, and Dean was just a distant memory of the idiot he used to know.
Dean and Sam were in the impala, driving down a long empty highway under a bright blue sky. Sunrays shone through the clouds. Dean didn’t think about it.
“Well,” Laura said, “I don’t know if this is too forward, but my best friend will be in town next week. Her name is Lisa. I really think you guys would hit it off.”
“I’m only asking you to consult me before making any big spending decisions. Unless you want to get a job of your own.”
Months went by. Shannon invited Sam over for dinner most nights, and though Shannon was an excellent cook, Sam insisted they trade off. He’d pick Henry up from school when Shannon had late meetings. Shannon started coming by the Bunker on weekends. She and Sam would go running in the morning, and Logan, Malia, and Kelly would watch Henry. At first Malia refused to help, since kids kind of freaked her out, but Henry was pretty cool. She taught him basic self-defense, modified for a toddler, and Kelly captured the cuteness with a million pictures.
Jack would do,” Dean slapped together some prayer hands and shouted to the ceiling, “Because someone wants to work in mysterious ways all of a sudden!”
Well. He took one step on the tightrope and now here he was, free falling to a cold, unforgiving death. Cas looked confused, but there was a light in his eyes, like some of his confusion was a kindness. Like he knew more than he let on, but wanted Dean to explain it anyway. Dean kept his face carefully neutral.
Dean walked into the library, just as Sam brought his phone away from his ear. Sam turned, surprised to see Dean. Surprised, and nervous, judging by the clench of his jaw and the way he swallowed.
“I tried, Dean. The important thing is I put breakfast on the table. I upheld my end of the bargain. Have you found a job yet?”
The second thing he realized was life without Dean was painfully lonely. How did he live like this before the Winchesters moved into the neighborhood? If he had to listen to Michael nag him about the importance of ironing or Gabriel talk his ear off about some ‘hot chick’ in the third pew, he was going to pray for the lord to smite him.
“I still enjoy sex now,” Cas clarified, and wow, this conversation got away from him. Dean felt like he just stepped onto a tightrope with no safety net.
“He shouldn’t have to deal with this,” Cas defended himself to Claire, “I didn’t want to burden him with my problems. Jack is my child, and I want to raise him, and I don’t want Dean to feel obligated to help me just because he feels sorry for me.”
He was prepared to break the door open, but he wasn’t prepared for the door to be wide open already.
Charlie watched him leave. She almost went after him, but as soon as the kitchen door closed, Dean jumped out of his chair and followed. Lisa looked surprised, but he didn’t seem to notice.
“I know,” Cas put a hand on Dean’s arm. It felt like Cas’s hand could burn a hole through his shirt. “But I want you know, you didn't ruin my plans. I turned down Brown because I was just so scared and insecure and I didn't think our friendship would survive the distance. But when you dropped out, and later moved back home, I realized my feelings for you were still there. It didn't matter how far apart we were. I just wish you’d said something sooner so I could have explained. Dean, I already applied to Stanford.”
He sort of got it into his head that Cas would be there for breakfast for some dumb reason, so he cooked. A lot. Usually, Sam was always the first one up, but when he got his lazy ass out of bed at 9, he walked into a kitchen full of muffins, toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, strawberries, waffles, and quiche.
That summer, Cas went back home. It would be harder to avoid him in Lawrence, but not impossible. He just wouldn’t go to all their usual places. At least he knew the library would be safe.
“You can do anything you want. We both can. Who gives a shit what we do? It’s about who we do it with.”
“I do. But I’ve always known you didn’t return my feelings— and that’s okay. I didn’t want Sam to tell you I called because I wanted you to get a clean break from me and my. . . problems. You saved the world Dean. You deserve to have a happy life, free of complications. I am a big complication.”
Dean was angry, furious really, and confused. But still, he couldn’t help but smile. He felt so relieved when he saw Cas. It reminded him of the way it felt when Cas healed him, the rush of his grace washing over him and fixing pain he’d gotten used to ignoring.
Sam reached for the bedside lamp and flicked it on. He blinked and saw Dean standing over his bed with his laptop. He turned the laptop around and shoved it in Sam’s face.
“Hey you already had a chance to interrogate him,” Gabriel said. “And besides, if they hooked up, Cas should tell us. We’re family.”
“Raymond and Shannon Blight. They’re private collectors. And they bought a ‘piece of ancient Mayan sun disk’ from a charity auction in 2007. Sam. Sammy. Does this look right? The picture’s kind of blurry. Sam, wake up.”
“Okay, fine. We got into a fight about your birthday party. I wanted to get three cheap strippers, but he wanted one expensive-ass stripper—”
“The hunters in Chicago want an answer by tonight,” Logan said, glancing at his phone. “Good luck, man.”
Sam thought about moving out of the bunker. It was a place full of memories, it was hard, sometimes.  They didn’t even know where Dean was, technically. Sam was pretty sure the ritual had worked, almost positive that Dean had made it to the Empty, but the not knowing was painful. He tried a few prayers to Jack, but got no reply. He didn’t let it bother him. No news was good news. If Dean was dead, Jack would at least let him know. Send a burning bush, or something. He owed Sam that much.
“He needs a good father,” Cas corrected. “And I tried Dean, very hard, but. . . I can’t be that for him. I’m incapable. You were right. I was subconsciously imitating my own father. Maybe that’s why he left us all those years ago. He knew he would do more damage if he stayed.”
“It’s not like that,” Cas said, frustrated, “which you would know if you had stayed.” Dean resisted an eyeroll and Cas continued, “She told me to show Jack I support him by showing my support for his partner.”
Three weeks into their fall semester, Dean dropped out. He said it was because he sucked at school but Cas suspected it had more to do with the money he wanted to save. Bobby was injured and retired, and Sam had his sights sets on Stanford. Dean didn’t tell anyone else he dropped out. Instead he accepted the usual tuition money Bobby sent, and put it in a savings account in Sam’s name.
“That’s thirty-four in nephilim years,” Claire said so deadpan Dean couldn’t tell if she was serious.
Christmas, and they were doing a costume together. Sam was Carl, Shannon was Ellie, and Henry was Russell from Up.
“No,” Dean choked out. “No.” His eyes darted around Cas’s face, committing every inch to memory, “Nothing is wrong. We’re… like you said.”
The audience roared with laughter. Sam leaned forward in his seat. Dean finally looked at him. Sam was tense. He nodded slightly, reassuring him that he had this situation under control.
They bickered, a lot, over stupid stuff like what to order for dinner and if they should rewatch Dr. Sexy or start a new show.
“Cas! I found you. I’m here. I’m here to save you.” Dean knew he sounded desperate, but he couldn’t fight the waves of relief crashing into him.
“Great,” Claire gave him a small smile, “Now let’s go before all the ice cream is gone. I’m sure Dean’s already gotten seconds.”
“Whatever. I think what you’re trying to say is that Jack doesn’t need Cas up in his personal business, right?”
“I get it, Bobby. Anyway, I gotta take care of those rain gutters. Those things are a damn fire hazard.”
“Don’t be,” Dean said. Sam’s approval was a huge weight off his shoulders, but it didn’t fix the rest of his problems, “Clearly, he realized it was a mistake.”
“I suppose,” his eyes drifted back to Dean, who had walked around to Laura’s side of the table to look at pictures of Lisa.
After an hour on the dance floor, Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and lead him to the relative quiet of the front yard. There weren’t any string lights out there, but a few fireflies flew in circles through the warm summer air.
Sam was transfixed, staring at the candy that was passing them by. Unwrapped. Ellen didn’t reappear. Nothing was happening. Nothing was wrong.
Cas knew Dean was trying to make him feel better, but nothing could dull his heartache. He closed his eyes and saw the devastated look on Jack’s face when he learned what he’d done. It was all his fault. Dean had even tried to talk him out of it. There was no one else to blame, no monsters, no enemies, just Cas and his painful attempt at parenting.
Sam glanced toward the kitchen. If Dean caught them gossiping, he’d be pissed the rest of the night, but Dean was still in front of the grill.
“Okay,” Sam said, “It’s possible Cas was just using a phone from South Dakota— but can you think of any other places here he might be? Should we check out some hospitals and homeless shelters or something?”
When Dean opened his eyes he was in the Impala on a long, empty highway. Above him was a grey sky. On the seat next to him, a pile of broken Joyous Discus. So it was a one time use kind of thing. At least he had pie.
A happy ending meant the three of them, together, with fulfilling lives as a family, dammit. Sam had helped him get here, but now it was Dean’s job to save Cas. Grip him tight and raise him from the Empty. Full circle, if you thought about it.
Dean was still staring at him as their laughter trailed off. Cas looked at him and seemed to remember something. He cleared his throat.
“No thanks needed,” Sam said, while thinking of the stolen gold plate in the trunk of the impala. She’d probably notice tomorrow, and hopefully she’d blame the vampires.
Dean paused. Gabriel looked serious. But this had to be some new, weird joke that didn’t have a punchline yet.
“You guys are getting worked up over nothing. Cas, dude, just tell them you and Dean are pranking us,” Garth leaned forward and patted Cas’s hand.
“Because I thought you wanted to ‘move on’. I thought it would be painful to you if I talked about it.”
Instead, Dean jumped back into Cas’s on and off again music education. Today it was a lesson on Journey. Cas listened and always had a thoughtful answer when Dean asked, “what’d you think?” They listened to the music and Cas tapped his fingers against his knee, and he thought about how easy it would be for Dean to reach over and place his hand on top of his.
Dean Winchester’s alarm clock went off at 8 am. He reached over and hit it until the buzzing stopped. The morning was quiet again, but his thoughts were still too damn loud.
“Well, that’s. . .” Dean finally settled on, “something. Uh, how does that work when you’re not actually human?”
Dean was up and dressed by the time Sam came into the kitchen in his exercise clothes. The toaster went off. Sam grabbed a plate and helped himself to some of the scrambled eggs Dean was cooking. Dean grabbed the two slices of hot toast, fumbling while trying not to burn himself. The toaster had three slots, so he could’ve made another piece. But they only needed two. Dean didn’t think about it.
The white, fluorescent light of the diner seemed harsher after being outside. Dean walked to their table and wondered what he’d see when he got there— maybe Chad explaining the concept of a toga party to a totally lost Jack. Or maybe they hit it off. What if Chad and Jack were great for each other, and Cas had been right all along?
“No, you just want to push me away before I leave you. Like everyone else has. That’s why you sleep with people who don’t mean anything to you.”
“Anna wants to play charades,” Cas said, standing in the doorway, lit up from behind. He’d dressed for the occasion, with a white collared shirt and a blue tie that he’d worn a million times. His sleeves were pushed up to his elbows, and he’d pulled his tie loose, and he was the hottest person Dean had ever seen.
Dean stayed later than usual at the shop. He’d been working on cars since he was old enough to bring his dad a pair of pliers. When he had an engine in front of him, he had a clear head. He already asked for the weekend off for Sam’s birthday, so today was his last chance to distract himself with work. On his final car of the day, he triple checked the spark plugs and made sure every drop of oil was thoroughly changed.
Cas must have printed this. And for some reason, he must have torn it into pieces and thrown it away.
Dean got out of the car and walked in a circle. It was just dirt, everywhere, except for the apparently endless road. He tried calling Cas’s name a few times, but nothing happened. There were no monsters, and no Cas. He got back in the car and drove.
“Oh my god, the Winchesters! You guys are so cool,” Kelly, a bubbly 21 year old Black woman squealed.
It didn’t seem possible, not now, not after their perfect night together. This was exactly why he’d never acted on his feelings before. Now that he knew what it was like to kiss the smile off Dean’s face, how could he go back to just being friends? How could he watch him smile at someone else?
Cas felt his throat closing up. This was a different type of panic, one that occurred when he thought about Jack’s unique situation. What was Jack supposed to do? Juliet didn’t know that he was a man, but only a few years old, but also the anti-christ. How could Jack ever engage in a normal human romance?
“Listen, I know we don’t really… but you oughta know I. . . got no problems with Cas. You and him together and everything. You know what I’m tryin’ to say.”
He reached under the couch and pulled out a thick leather tome. He flipped to the page he’d dog eared and returned to his reading. Dean hated research. He’d started reading Portals and Ancient Artifacts a week ago, and he still wasn’t done. Sam could’ve read a freaking bookshelf in that amount of time.
Sam cleared his throat, “Uh— anyway. We should hit the books, even books that seem irrelevant. Maybe there’s a line or two that could help. It wouldn’t hurt to cover all our bases. And I was thinking, maybe we should call a few people?”
“We can take care of the case tomorrow. I’m gonna go on a run. And I’ll probably grab dinner somewhere. I could bring you back something?” Sam said as soon as they dropped their bags in their room.
“Dude, we don’t know who these people are,” Dean said opening the gun to check for ammo. Bullets soaked in dead man’s blood.
I promise. Just because you finally answered doesn’t mean the promise was made. I know how these deals work. Nice try.”
They’d only known each other for a few months, the friendship was fresh, and therefore vulnerable. Looking back, Cas would assign himself most of the blame. Technically, Dean started it, but sixth grade Cas was the annoying asshole who blew it out of proportion.
But Dean stepped forward. Jack slid his gaze toward him, but he still looked like a bomb about to blow. Dean didn’t care.
“Cas, you had a fight. Okay? It was just a fight. Families fight. Jack needs time to cool down, but that’s no excuse for you to go out for a pack of cigarettes and never come back. You were just trying to help. That’s not so bad. I don’t think anyone needs to call CPS.”
It was no Roadhouse, but the dive bar still looked warm and inviting as Dean and Sam pulled up at sunset. They got out of the car and looked the bar. They could hear music and see a crowd through the windows, but they couldn’t make out any individual faces. They looked at each other. If Charlie was back, who knew what else, or who else, would be waiting for them inside.
“I don’t know why I did it. I just did. And he didn’t say anything. I thought…I don’t know what I thought. I was relieved, I guess.”
“So, what? You just want to drive around, asking people if they’ve seen a guy in a trench coat yea high?” Sam held up a hand at Cas’s height.
All of the fire within Jack was extinguished, but his expression was still guarded. Sam was smiling, half amused and half relieved. Cas walked across the room to Jack, and Jack didn’t step away. He didn’t even flinch when Cas put a hand on his shoulder.
Dean had dealt with a lot of pain, but this was new. It was a knife to the heart, stabbed all the way through him by a man who wasn’t even in the room. He searched Sam’s face for any shred of doubt, but there was none. It had been Cas on the phone. Sam looked at him with pity, and the pain felt unbearable. It clouded his vision, like the knife was ripped out of him, like he was starting to bleed out.
It broke through the rock, exploding in a shower of rubble, just as the chorus of the song kicked in. Dean ran in right after the car, in case the stupid rock could mend itself. He wasn’t taking any chances.
Dean slipped away an hour later. He saw Sam and Eileen sitting at a candle lit table in the corner, and didn’t bother them. It looked like they had a lot to talk about anyway, and Dean was happy for them. If Sam freaked out, he knew Dean’s number.
Sam’s eyes lit up, “That’s great. You’d love California. If you stop by Stanford, Eileen and I could give you a tour.”
That caught Cas’s attention. Frankie looked a little startled, but Dean couldn’t fault him for that. Cas’s attention was intense.
But he could live with that in quiet pain because what would be the point of telling him? What would Cas do? He’d say thanks and never talk to Dean again, because anything else would be too awkward.
“No need to thank me. We came here to ask for your advice,” Cas suddenly seemed more vulnerable, more human, as he looked at Claire and said, “Jack told me he was gay this morning. How should I support him as a father?”
“Our Jack who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name,” Dean said, trying to joke about it but sounding painfully genuine even to his own ears. Here, in the privacy of his bedroom, lit only by the small red dot on his alarm clock, he closed his eyes and allowed himself to ask the question he still couldn’t in front of Sam.
“I would’ve sensed something,” Cas explained. Dean didn’t like the sound of that. He eyed Chad suspiciously.
Cas felt like the couch had been pulled out from underneath him. The last thing he wanted to do was upset Dean. That was the whole reason he wanted to move out.
“Do you think it’s possible this is Chuck? Or—” Sam stopped spiraling long enough to process what he’d just said. “What did you just say?”
“We need the Joyous Discus. Big gold plate. It would be in the archives,” Sam said pointing toward a descending staircase blocked by red velvet. “The museum piece is incomplete.”
Dean’s brain short circuited. Cas’s smile grew. Dean cleared his throat and tried to remember what the hell they were talking about.
Dean grabbed the phone, “Sam and I are actually in the neighborhood right now. Maybe we could stop by.”
The drive to Sioux Falls was nice. The clouds gave way to blue skies and open fields melted into slightly greener open fields. Dean had never asked about the people he slept with before, and Cas kept waiting for him to bring it up again. But he didn’t.
While Sam put on his running shoes, Dean sprawled on the couch and flipped through channels. As soon as the bunker door closed behind Sam, Dean turned the TV off and stood.
“Not you,” Dean agreed, then turned to Cas, “Should we try making him juice with that stupid fruit juicer thing?”
“I need your help,” Cas said, misinterpreting her smile as a no, “Please. I’m still trying to understand human sexuality. And I’m not sure if I should let him date civilians—”
“Great idea,” Cas happily got out of the booth, “I’m sure Jack and Chad have much to discuss alone. I believe this could be the start of a wonderful relationship.”
“Sure,” Claire said slowly. Cas seemed more high-strung than usual, but if this was about something big, Dean wouldn’t be leaning back so casually in his chair.
Dean pressed his hand into the center of the Joyous Discus. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Sam watched from the side. Logan, Kelly, Malia, and Shannon watched from semi-circle behind Sam.
He threw on his clothes, and then poked his head into different rooms of the bunker, until he finally found Cas in the library, head hung low at a table full of books.
Dean was dressed in his usual clothes: a crisp white button up tucked into a nice pair of slacks. He had a tie and a belt. His hair was parted to the side and gelled into place. His suit jacket was folded, on the crease, and it hung from the back of an empty kitchen chair. He wasn’t sure what color his suit was. It looked dark grey. But so did most things.
Dean and Jo got into a lively debate about what they’d rather be, a werewolf or vampire. Jo made a joke about vampire sex and Twilight, and Dean laughed and put an arm around the back of Cas’ chair.
There were still two hours to kill before the party. Dean spent most of the day hanging around the Roadhouse, helping Jo hang decorations and while Ellen worked on Sam’s birthday cake. Although pie was her specialty, she unfortunately insisted on cake. It was extra fancy too, probably because she felt guilty for missing Sam’s graduation next week. Dean offered to help with frosting, but Ellen sent him packing.
When they got home, Dean thought about what Gabriel had said alone in his room. And then he thought so much he drove himself crazy and went into Cas’s room.
He’d just read the same paragraph twice. Goddamn, why did these ancient dicks invent pyramids and not audiobooks? Dean focused back on the book. This was just one of dozens of dusty old tomes he’d found that might hopefully maybe mention the Empty. He was going to read it cover to cover, even if it took another week. What did a week in the Empty feel like?
Cas lived with Charlie for the next two years. After they graduated, he moved back to Lawrence until he figured out what he wanted to do for grad school. He rented a small house on the edge of town with Dean and got a job as a high school English teacher. Dean worked as a mechanic at Bobby’s old shop.
Cas knew Dean wouldn’t tell anyone. No matter how disgusted he was by Cas, he said he wouldn’t tell and Dean kept his promises. The thought should have made him feel better, but somehow he felt worse.
“I think there’s a phone number written on this. Look, it has ten digits. It looks like it was written recently.”
“Why do you need two chairs?” Cas asked, right as Laura entered the Roadhouse, with a beautiful brunette woman.
Dean and Sam sat at a 24-hour diner. The Joyous Discus, well a piece of it, was safely wrapped up in Dean’s flannel on the booth next to him. Dean and Sam thanked their waitress, who brought them their burgers. Turned out neither had actually gotten dinner tonight.
Dean spooned the eggs onto two plates and set bacon strips into the pan. He heard the sizzle right as the backdoor opened.
“I wouldn’t shoot them somewhere bad. I just— this is important Sammy, it’s the last piece. And it’s better to go in prepared for the worst-case scenario. I don’t need this right now.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean snorted and dumped the eggs on a plate. “You seriously never suspected? I thought I was pretty obvious.”
“I’m not,” Dean said, sending a chuck of muffin flying. He put a hand over his mouth and quickly finished swallowing before he continued, “Cas, you made these? All by yourself?”
“I don’t know,” Dean said helplessly. He couldn’t think of an excuse that didn’t sound horrible. But he couldn’t tell him the truth, either. Now was not the time for an ‘I love you’, much less an ‘I’ve been in love with you for years’.
Sixth grade Cas was shaken to his core. He went on a self-righteous rant about Christianity that made 26 year old Cas cringe to think about, and Dean went back home. They didn’t talk for a week after that, and during that week Cas realized two things. The first was that he’d been raised and homeschooled by extremely religious parents, and everyone he spent time with were either his siblings or people from church. Just because Dean didn’t believe in the same things, or in God at all, didn’t mean he was a bad person. It just meant he was raised differently.
A lively band started to play. A grey background faded in. A white cartoon heart appeared. The heart was outlined in a thin black line. In cursive “DEAN WINCHESTER” and “CASTIEL” appeared inside the heart. That heart faded into an identical heart that said, in the same cursive lettering, “I LOVE CASTIEL”, just as the music finished with a flourish of trumpets.
“So, uh, anyway,” Dean raised his glass, “Here’s to Shannon—a woman way out of my brother’s league. Here’s to Sam— the best Winchester of us all. And here’s to this kid, my favorite nephew. Cheers, to the beautiful family that grows from two hearts like yours.”
“Hulo?” Dean spoke around the muffin in his mouth. He swallowed and listened. “Yes. . . is that so?. . .well, thank you very much.”
Cas was so close, but there was still a slight space between them. Dean wanted to close the space so badly, but he was caught between the counter and Cas’s stare. Cas put a hand on his arm, right over the handprint. Right where it belonged.
Dean scrambled up to run after him—but he heard a groan from the ground. The woman— Shannon. She was still alive. But if she’d been bitten, it wouldn’t be for long. Dean glanced between the stairs and Shannon, but he knew what he had to do.
“We need to read through this material as soon as possible,” Sam said, putting a hand on one of four giant stacks of books. The three hunters were staring awe struck at Sam’s face. Sam patted the book stack awkwardly, “So. Maybe each of us could take a stack?”
Michael’s court date showed up sooner than Cas thought. Cas, Gabriel, and Anna had to be there, in their best clothes, while some judge decided if Michael could become their legal guardian. Cas walked with his hands in the pockets of his pants so no one would see them shaking. He kicked the gravel outside the courthouse steps, angry, and not thinking about Dean at all.
Cas picked up his latte. Jack studied his drink. It looked like a milkshake, with caramel dripping down the sides and a mountain of whip cream on top. Jack unwrapped his straw, then paused and squinted at the cup.
No one spoke as Dean grabbed a book off the table then turned and marched back down the hallway. Once he was safely around the corner, he stopped and listened.
“Hey, Cassie, Dean-o, come back here for a sec. When you hooked up the other day, who actually initiated it? It was Dean, right?”
ahh okay I said one more chapter last time, but now I mean it for real. One more chapter after this, hopefully up in two days. Thanks to everyone who commented and left kudos :,) it really makes my day. Enjoy this angsty chapter!
“Tonight is gonna be great. You’re gonna show up, looking hot as hell, and he’s going to realize what a stupid, immature, dick-headed, asshole he was. And if he doesn’t, I’ll tell him.”
“Cas? Hey. Where are you, man? If you’re with Jack or taking care of heaven shit, that’s cool. Just— Do you need a ride or something? I know you know my number. Uh. . .”
Dean finally gained control and pressed the gun to the vampire’s head. Another masked vampire appeared from the second bedroom. He had blood on his chin— Raymond’s blood— but as Dean shot the vampire underneath him, the other grabbed the plate and ran.
“Important things, like your future. I just want you. To. Be. Happy,” Dean said through gritted teeth.
“I want him back, too,” Dean continued steadily, “But we can’t go there again, not after we just fixed things—”
In the living room, Claire claimed the leather recliner. Cas and Dean stood side by side in front of her. Cas, tense and solemn. Dean, like he was already thinking about the dessert in Jody’s freezer.
“He has his memory wiped, we need to find him now. He’s probably all confused and he could be hurt, or attacked, and he wouldn’t even know how to—”
“Let’s talk about something else,” Sam said. Jo, Anna, and Gabriel opened their mouths, but he cut them off, “It’s my birthday, and I want to talk about this summer. Anyone have any fun plans?”
“Dean, that’s, that’s great. I mean, I always wondered if there was something going on between you and Cas, but love? I’m really happy for you guys.”
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. His mind raced with possible explanations, and none of them were good.
“The moment I saw your soul, something changed. I didn’t understand it then but. . . everything changed.”
Dean felt like he was looking at a painting. There was something so beautiful about the pool of light around him, with Cas right in the center like he was the source.
but that just further proved his point. If Cas wanted to be with someone, he had options. Though of course he also had bigger concerns.
Sam didn’t want to hunt, not without Dean, but eventually Logan, Malia, and Kelly wanted to hit the road again. Sam offered them a deal. They could move into the bunker, use it as a home base, and though Sam wouldn’t hunt with them, he would do research, find cases, and give advice as needed. In exchange, they would continue to help him research the Empty. The three happily agreed.
“Dean,” Sam slowly turned toward his brother, and spoke in a low voice. Nothing like he’d sounded before. He wasn’t happy-go-lucky Sam.
“We’re good friends,” Cas lied quickly, “and he’s around your age. I thought you two should meet. And he wanted to meet you. Isn’t that right, Chad?”
“Oh,” Jack said, once he realized Cas was waiting for his answer, “That must be difficult. Are you a hunter?”
The third, and final, piece of the plate was harder to track down. But eventually, it was Dean who found it.
“I don’t know what to do with myself. This past year, it’s been all about finding you and Cas. I’ve helped some other hunters, researched stuff. I fell in love. Now I just don’t know what to do.”
Dean chuckled, “Of course it is. See this is why we never let Sammy plan his own party. It would just be a giant book club meeting. The DJ would play a 9 hour audio book.”
After Ellen recovered from the cake crime scene, she announced that Dean and Cas were going to go buy some dessert. It wasn’t a suggestion, and not even Sam’s protests changed her mind. Charlie didn’t let him protest too hard. She convinced the group that Cas and Dean definitely needed some alone time before they could answer any questions.
“No,” Cas smiled sheepishly. “I don’t remember when I knew. It was more difficult to understand my feelings when I was an angel. I knew I felt strongly toward you, but. . . When did you realize?”
“It’s nice. I’m from Ireland, so it’s cool to see more of America. I’ve really only been to California.”
Dean took his muffin outside, but he didn’t eat it. As soon as the bunker door closed, Dean dropped to his knees and looked up at the blue sky above him. He knew he didn’t actually need to, but it made his prayer feel more official somehow, like he was paying for faster shipping.
Dean kept his eyes on the road, and shifted his hands to ten and two on the steering wheel. If he was focused on driving, he wouldn’t have to focus on anything else, like this conversation. Or the concerned crease on Sam’s forehead.
Dean knew he shouldn’t have said it. Vessels were a sensitive topic, but Meg and April were a million times worse. He glanced back at Cas, but he didn’t look upset. In fact, he was half smiling.
Cas stormed inside. He ran a hand through his hair and looked at his reflection in the silver pot hanging above the counter. He looked terrible, and not just because his reflection was distorted. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days.
“You,” a distorted voice snapped, “were supposed to call as soon as it ended. What happened? What did you learn about the anti-Christ? Did Castiel or the Winchester cause any problems?”
Cas shook it off. Soon, he would close this riff between him and Jack. He would be able to show Jack his support, just like Jody showed Claire. Cas adjusted the lapel of his coat.
Ed’s was decently crowded. One booth was crowded by a family of tourists, a few others occupied by couples, one with a young man sitting alone. Two people sat alone at the counter. The décor in this diner hadn’t been touched since ’52, but the smell of fries was too strong to care about things like dusty old juke boxes.
“First of all, you can’t stop him from dating someone. You’re a parent, not a patrol officer,” Claire cut him off. He looked like he was committing her words to memory. She softened slightly and said, “and if you have questions about being gay, don’t expect him to teach you everything. Do some research yourself. Be informed.”
Sam and Shannon hit it off. She was an archeology professor, with a passion for ancient cultures and art, and when Sam told her everything, she took it surprisingly well. The vampire home invasion opened her mind to the idea. She insisted that he tell Henry, too, though perhaps a PG version of events until he was older. Sam’s eyes lit up. That implied a future where he got to stick around.
Dean held the bottom of the bottle against his thigh and attacked the foil with new vigor. God, this shit was hard to peel off. He bent over to get a better grip.
Cas checked outside first, and felt a wave of relief when he saw Dean and his impala still parked across the street.
“Gender doesn’t exist to angels. Of course, since my vessel became permanent, I liked to consider myself a man. Yet, when it comes to selecting sexual partners, I’ve never taken gender into consideration. I am drawn to a person’s soul.”
“And bought the whole store?” Sam asked, but didn’t complain as he reached for a blueberry muffin. Dean wanted to tell him to wait, but that would be stupid. Wait for what? He had no idea when Cas show up. Cas didn’t even eat.
the last thing Cas said to him, he would agree with Dean. Cas wanted to see him. Cas wanted to talk to him. He told Dean he loved him.
When Dean walked back into the kitchen, Sam was sitting at the table eating a whole quiche by himself.
Jack sat on the bed, back to the door. Eileen stood by the window, and saw Cas as soon as he stepped into the doorway. Her eyes lit up.
Dean was gone for the day. Last night, Eileen told him about a possible vampire nest she and Sam were investigating in Colorado, and he offered to go poke around in person. Jack was lounging on the couch watching TV, something he only did when Dean was gone. Cas noticed Jack and Dean’s awkwardness around each other, but he didn’t know how to fix it. Sam had told him once that Dean used to start fights with Jack, but Cas still wasn’t sure why, as he had been dead at the time.
When Dean and Cas stepped through the door, they went from the Empty to total blackness. They were in a small space, four walls closed in.
Dean finally got the freaking foil off. He threw it to the ground and tried to push the top off. The cork was even more stubborn than the foil.
Dean found the vampire nest. It was on the smaller side, and he wondered if he should call Sam and Eileen or just start throwing stakes. Then a pair of fangs attacked him from behind, and the choice was made for him. It took longer alone, but fortunately he finished the fight. Unfortunately, it was in the fucking sewers. Not the worst solo hunt he’s been on, and not the worst he’s ever smelled, but definitely top five for both. He couldn’t even grab shower or a drink in Colorado because Cas texted him.
The Roadhouse was the perfect place for a party. Dean’s ‘Shit Sam Likes’ playlist lightly played through the speakers, candles flickered from the center of the tables, Ellen served the drinks, and Dean served the burgers. All of Sam’s Lawrence friends and neighbors were invited, and most were there standing around, chatting in small groups. Even Michael was there, chatting with Luc, Sam’s old boss, by the chip bowl.
Dean was horrified. He hadn’t even considered the fact that time would pass differently in the Empty than it would on Earth. He couldn’t believe this wrinkled old man was his baby brother. He’d missed Sam’s life. They were supposed to live it together. He felt like he’d been kicked in the throat.
The impala was never silent. The air vents rattled. The radio was usually on, though now it was turned down to a dull hum. Cas’s window was cracked opened and he could hear the rush of the wind as they drove down the highway.
Cas called from South Dakota. Sam tried calling him back, but he got a robotic answering machine. The only place in South Dakota on Sam’s list was the warehouse where Cas and Dean had first met, so that’s where they were headed first.
An alarm rang, and sudden the conveyor belt was moving. Sam and Dean jumped into position as the first piece of chocolate appeared.
Dean didn’t say anything else. He just watched Sam prepare the rest of the ritual. He didn’t even give Sam a hard time for making a circle of sugar in the ground. When Sam added the vanilla, he got a little worried that he mistook an ancient baking ritual for the portal ritual, but what the hell. It was still the best lead they had. And it had to work. It had to.
“Yesterday,” Cas said. “Did he ask you to come here? If he wants his things, he can pick them up anytime.”
He didn’t know how to fix it. After a few days, he wasn’t even angry. He was scared. What if the next time he saw Dean, he blurted out his feelings? What if Dean could just read it on his face? What if Dean was dating someone? What if he realized Cas had been holding him back all these years and now he was happier than ever with a hot girlfriend and three cars?
Cas ordered a latte for himself, while Jack took his time reading the chalkboard menu above the cashier’s head. The cashier was a teenage girl with bright pink hair that stood out against her black clothes and apron.
Eileen laughed, “I’m honestly impressed you knew the sign for stripper. And I’d go with three, because the more the merrier.”
“This is a beautiful moment,” Eileen said to Dean and Sam. Then to Dean, “Who did Cas set him up with?”
“He didn’t cuss you out or start throwing shit…Parents and kids fight. It happens. Compared to the crap Dad and Sam used to scream at each other, that was practically a Father’s Day picnic.”
“Sorry if you’re. . . busy, or whatever, but I need to talk to you. You remember what you said, before. . .”
Cas processed this. He wanted to kick himself for not reaching out sooner. He couldn’t throw away years of friendship over a petty fight caused by a crush. That’s what it was, after all. Not love, a crush. A crush was something he could repress until he moved on to someone else.
But when he looked into Dean’s eyes, he was back on solid ground. They could do this, if they worked together. They could do anything.
“This is why I didn’t want to tell you,” Cas said with a dry smile. “I didn’t want to disappoint you, if I wasn’t good enough. But I’ve been thinking about touring the campus this summer. Maybe Sam could help me get in touch with someone from the English department.”
Dean wanted to demand, to dare him to say it, but that impulse came from the part of himself with no self-preservation.
They checked into a Pittsburg motel. It’s something they’ve done a million times, but this time Dean had an itch under his skin. He knew research was important blah blah blah, but he was sick of reading. He’d stumbled upon a paragraph about Ancient Mayan artifacts that looked good enough to him, so he was going to pursue it, tonight. First he just needed to sneak away from Sammy for a few hours. But how?
Jack had never tried coffee before, so Cas decided today they would go to a coffee shop. Personally, Cas didn’t care for coffee. Once you had one liquid molecule, you’ve had them all, but still, it was fun to watch Jack experience something for the first time. Was that how the Winchesters used to think of him? Refreshingly naïve.
“No,” Cas’s mouth made a firm line, “I had to stop by the bank. Our account was overdrawn. I explained to the teller that someone must have stolen my information to make such an expensive purchase. Afterall, neither of us would ever buy a. . . television.”
