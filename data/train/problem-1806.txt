At dawn when the artist woke, he was swathed in the blonde’s strong and warm arms, his soft sleepy breaths blew warmly against his nape and their legs were tangled tightly together. Against his back, he could feel John’s chest pressed against him. Only then did he fully let the tears flow, let the soft sobs shake free from his chest. He considered leaving John’s flat, now that the man was asleep, to avoid the awkward moments that were definitely to come. But he couldn’t bring himself to.
“Muggleborn? No. Both my parents have magic. Ath does my horrid big brother”. He waved a hand dismissively as if that was the most natural thing in the world, to be born with a sibling and parents that were not just aware but part of the magical world. Who understood everything from the customs to the mechanics of magic and could actually perform spells and could use wands as everyday objects. John couldn’t even think of a place to start on questions he had for Sherlock.
“Look. Is it... other people that you’re worried about? Me finding new friends and somehow against all odds deciding we shouldn’t be friends anymore?”
John looked back to him, expression panicked and his gaze flickered to the door and back to the artist, clearly not knowing what to do.
“It’s…. it’s nothing” the artist choked out. If John wasn’t going to break his heart now it was better to pretend. To keep him for himself if only for a little while longer. After all, he didn’t have any more classes with the model after today’s lesson and John would most likely request not to be booked again. If this was his last night with him... well then. He guessed he would have to make the best of it. To capture every second, every moment and commit it to memory.
John didn’t notice Sherlock walk into the living room again and was, as discreetly as he could manage, trying to peer into the studio.
Now the next week had arrived and their professor looked… well? Anxious? Molly wasn’t sure.
“Oh!”
Trying not to eavesdrop too much Sherlock sat behind his desk and scribbled furiously into his notebook about everything more he had learnt about John. Instantly the contrast between the notes about John and the notes about every other model Sherlock had ever had in his classroom was absolutely massive. Other models never expanded on Sherlock’s views, never reacted with admiration let alone curiosity as to how Sherlock had figured them out. Sherlock did not understand why John was different than them and why he did not seem to be scared or angered by Sherlock’s observations.
The hour passed sluggishly, Professor Trelawney went around the classroom trying to teach everyone how to decipher the figures in the mist and translate them into predictions. So far, no one aside from Molly had been successful at distinguishing anything in the fog. Then again, judging by hers and Greg’s giggles maybe she’d only pretended to see something.
“That took you quite a while mate” Greg grinned. John rolled his eyes and they both took off to the sound of the whistle blowing, signaling the start of the match.
“MISS ADLER!” Professor Mcgonagall exclaimed, scandalized. John pulled back, and they separated with a soft wet pop, giggling. John looked into Sherlock’s grey eyes full of wonder, surprise and affection and instantly knew this moment was the start of the best thing that had ever happened to him. So he beamed at the scowling Slytherins' surrounding them, grabbed Sherlock’s warm pink face and kissed him again.
Sherlock nodded, humming noncommittally.
He opened his mouth, trying to find something to say and knowing if he didn’t.. he would definitely make this irreparable.
Sherlock’s classroom was nice, it had a couple of windows and it was expansive, with clean off-white walls and wooden floors with spatters of paint that gave it an artsy charming vibe. But this room… this room was incredible. The entire sprawling ceiling was a circular glass dome that sunk upwards into the sky, and the second half of the room, the far end, was composed entirely of glass walls. And the view… the view was nothing short of absolutely spectacular. The city spread out into the distance, you could very faintly see the glimmer of the Thames and the minuscule shapes of the London eye and the big ben tower. “Oh my God… Sher-“
Sherlock positioned all the lights near the platform so he could arrange them when the model arrived. He then walked back to his desk and took out all his drawing materials as well as the attendance list and a small notebook. He still had an entire half hour to spare before the students would start trickling in so he flipped through his sketchbook and found some old drawing he could polish to later make into paintings for his upcoming gallery.
John stared at him for a moment, mouth hanging open in complete shock. The dark haired boy’s smile instantly disappeared “Oh uh..” his neck hunched in a wince as if expecting John to hit him or reproach him.
?’ he thought. Well, he HAD just asked John to spend a week with him and he barely knew him! However… he just couldn’t find it in himself to be regretful. Even after seeing Sherlock’s deduction abilities John hadn’t made fun of him, or called him names, or even acted offended! All things Sherlock was used to receiving as reactions to his observatory abilities. John had been kind and… fun. He was different. He seemed like Sherlock’s perfect choice for a friend. The first one he’d ever had.
. A great passion in your future! Tenderness. Pure adoration. Yes. I see it very clearly”
who had been there for him for YEARS. John frowned. He wasn’t sure what he’d expected to feel now that he’d acknowledged to himself that he’d been devastated by being ignored… but it hadn’t been this. This…
John laughed “Well at least you know he cares.”
they should have talked about it. They should have clarified what they were doing. He knew that the model would’ve probably not wanted an exclusive relationship with him but… did he not want it so badly that he would pursue someone else right in front of him? Then again, Sherlock had not really expressed sentiment towards him. And it was something the blonde probably didn’t expect or desire from him.
On Tuesday, the first class of this week, Sherlock had called out to them at the beginning of the day. “Class” Sherlock had said, standing up to guarantee they would all turn to see him. “John is coming back for this week’s lessons so please abstain from being annoying to him.” He’d said a little defensively, hoping no one would ask any question and prompt Sherlock into a denying frenzy.
“Is this.. is this about my letters?” John prompted as gently as he could. This was important. John didn’t want to scare Sherlock away but this was a conversation they had pushed back too long. One of many conversations, clearly. John didn't want to ruin what was happening between them, but he knew that they could never move forwards and past it if they weren’t honest with each other.
I cannot believe I let a month go by. My apologies. Wont happen again. Anyway.. last kidlock!!!
He felt his blood pooling in his groin, tightening his pants, and couldn’t help the instinctive thrust of hips that aligned him with John’s. His answering bulge pressed against Sherlock’s and he hissed out in pleasure, pushing himself even further until-
“Ah. Yeth. I thee.” He looked John up and down, placing his tiny pale hands under his chin in a mock praying position. “Your parents are not wizards. You're only about 7 and they left you here own your own, clearly, they are either afraid of what they’re seeing in the magical world or they thimply don’t care much. By the look of the length of your hair, I’d say you previous haircut was well over 6 months ago so I’m gonna go with the latter- they don’t pay much attention to either of you. You’re astounded by the everything here and clearly, you’re not of age to be accepted into hogthwarth… your older thibling was accepted. Rather recently too judging by your still unbelieving face at the magical world. Did I get anything wrong?” He smirked at John again his dark curls bouncing as he raised his head and straightened his back to appear taller.
“Alright,” John nodded. “Let’s do it”.
Silence followed once more. Lestrade and John both looked thoroughly impressed, Dimmock looked incredibly offended and annoyed. In the close distance, the rest of the investigators were all pretending to take notes, obviously eavesdropping and trying not to look too obvious.
The artist nodded, still unable to speak around his puffing breaths. His hands clutched at his lover's back in an almost hug, needing to be held. John, understanding, kept on holding him tight, raised his lips and kissed his cheeks and closed eyelids. Sherlock let out a quiet shuddering breath, the question of what they meant to each other dying on the tip of his tongue and the seam of his open lips, knowing he wouldn’t be able to bear it if John didn’t feel the same intensity as he did for him. And in this moment, as John whispered compliments and endearments in his ear it was so easy to pretend that they were already together and that John would never let go.
“oh, love…” John pulled back, meeting Sherlock’s icy blue eyes, shining with relief but still sheathed a shade of doubt. John kissed him, raising a hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek and smoothing his thumb over the cheekbone. He poured his feelings into the kiss, the things he should’ve said days ago, and the things it was still too soon to voice but still felt deep in his heart.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, one of the hands clutching at John’s jacket loosened and came up to cup John’s face. He opened his eyes and looked at his friend, his best friend whom he had just
For this first pose, Sherlock was not saying anything to his students, mentally listing everything they were doing wrong but not wanting to say anything this early on in the class. Every now and then his gaze would flicker to John, expecting him to have moved or for his arms to start cramping up from the pose he had chosen. But John was perfectly still, his eyes had drifted closed but aside from that, not a single muscle looked out of place. Sherlock’s eyebrows rose, impressed with John’s clear comfort in maintaining stillness for a long amount of time. But now that he thought about it, he must have had a lot of practice with that in the military service.
Sherlock looked so dumbstruck by John’s words the latter couldn’t help but giggle softly, watching Sherlock blink rapidly whilst trying to process John’s words and feeling a rush of fondness for the man before him. He smoothed his thumb across Sherlock’s cheekbone
John shook his head grinning and covered Sherlock’s hands with his own “Its abstract art” he assured him. “You just don’t understand my genius”, he grinned.
“Are you alright?”
Chapter two!! Im getting really into writing this story so I hope it sets well with you guys <3<3<3 Thanks so much for being so sweet <3<3
“Shh… it’s okay Sherlock. There are things we need to talk about, definitely. But I’m sure we’ll figure everything out. It’s in the past. And this. This what’s happening between us? It’s our now”. John laid a peck on Sherlock’s cheek softly. “But not here,” he breathed. “Your back must be completely wet and freezing. And I’m not having you catch a cold. Come on,” he rose with difficulty, peeling himself away from Sherlock, who clung onto him, reluctant to let him stand up. But John insisted.
“Oh, bloody hell!” John cried, his voice quivering as he tried to keep steady whilst his feet skidded around on the ice. Sherlock watched amusedly and skated gracefully towards him. “Quite tricky to keep balance without proper stakes, I know. But I’m sure you’ll manage,” he sniffed and skated off into the centre of the lake, easy footwork as his long legs drifted smoothly around.
Sally and Anderson were snickering and the rest of the class held a deadly quiet tension, all eagerly awaiting for at least a small glimpse into the mysteriousness that was Sherlock Holmes.
“Irene? What do y-”
John finally rose himself onto his elbows and crawled back up Sherlock’s body, peppering him with kisses and soothing words all the way up until he could kiss him, Sherlock’s legs instinctively wrapped around his waist and he tipped his body up offering himself fully to the model.
“Shouldn’t we” he gasped out “get upstairs to your room?”
“But.. you've barely eaten anything”
“John” Sherlock called out
John thought, directly into his ear.
“You guys...” he panted “You aren’t supposed to come upstairs without me. They wouldn’t have let you in.” he gasped a couple of times “Wait for me next time. I had to run up the stairs”. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand and motioned them forward “come along then.” He started walking down the narrow hallway towards his left.
“Simple?” John’s eyebrows rose. He looked away from Sherlock’s walking figure and onto the back wall to avoid turning his head and moving from his pose. “Well, you must be pretty smart then," he smiled.
Sherlock peered into the mist before him and watched it revolving and twisting in lazy circles. He got closer, trying to distinguish shapes or any kind of figure through it. Nothing. But then-
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
But John seemed unfazed. “Yeah. I will be”
“The ring?” John frowned, taking a closer look “I’m not sure. It looks old and dirty.”
As soon as the Beauxbatons students began taking seats the empty silver plates at the centre of the tables suddenly flourished and filled up with servings of any dish you could possibly think of. With a cry of joy Greg tucked in unselfconsciously, and rolling his eyes to his friend John turned around from the still entering students and did the same.
They started walking back to the castle, talking about the practice and their past Quidditch games. The sky was darkening rapidly around them and the rain was soaking their school robes steadily, making them heavy and cold, but neither sped up their pace up the grass covered hill.
Anderson nodded fervently and rushed past them as quickly as he could, followed closely by his companions.
The artist just bent towards him, unable to help himself any longer and kissed him hard. He felt John’s surprised gasp shift into a soft moan, his hold on Sherlock’s waist tightening as he pried the artist’s mouth open.
Instead of answering, the model ducked his face and captured Sherlock’s already parted lips with his own and hummed in relief. Sherlock’s arms instantly latched out and his hands curled around John's forearms, grounding himself and keeping John close to him. He opened his mouth, the need to taste John against his tongue taking over, the deep taste of tea and wood-smoke. Complying with Sherlock’s pulling hands John plunged his tongue into Sherlock’s warm mouth and
John instantly tensed as he usually did when Sherlock was referred to anything other than his name in an unfriendly manner. He glared towards Sally but she took no notice of him, clearly finding her nails more engaging than John’s protectiveness over Sherlock.
Greg rolled his eyes at John from the table across dramatically. Molly pretended to throw up. John just ignored both of them, holding back a snort and his two best friends snickered with each other.
John hopped up on the table, reminiscent of how Irene Adler had done just the week before. He smiled inwardly at the memory, knowing how excited Irene had become once Sherlock had confessed to her that he and John had.. figured things out a couple of days later during their second lesson. “You sly dog!” she had hissed, grinning wolfishly down at him whilst he grinned helplessly.
“I daresay I could tell Mr Watson about your incessant pining over him. OR I figure Anderson and Sally would find it awfully interesting”
“I’m sorry I’ve caused you pain these last few days.” John sighed, gripping the artist’s hand tightly “I should’ve explained why Sarah had taken my phone. I should’ve known. I could see you were upset, but I didn’t want to pry and I-”
John sighed, a sob threatening to claw its way out of his throat as he pressed his forehead against the wood of the door with a soft thump. He could hear soft whimpers coming from inside of the room and the urge to break down the door and surround Sherlock in a hug was overwhelming. But Sherlock needed space. Even from him. Maybe especially from him.
The excitement within the crowd was now palpable. No other school had come to visit or stay in Hogwarts since the infamous last Triwizard tournament all those years ago when Harry Potter was still attending school.
“Uh… Sherlock. I don’t think-“
Sherlock’s eyes widened in shock at the realization. Dimmock kept prattling on but now the artist was entirely and completely separated from his consciousness. He could feel dread sinking low into his stomach, his heart pulsing painfully against his ribs, the back of his eyes stinging with sudden unexpected tears.
Moments later, after John had led him into the studio and had gently positioned Sherlock in the middle of the room, he had settled behind an easel, with a large sheet of off-white paper stuck onto a drawing board, as he was used to seeing students draw him on. He turned a small lamp from the desk on to light one side of Sherlock’s body, providing a lovely contrast with the paleness of his creamy skin and the darkness of the night shadows around them. Sherlock took a deep breath and pulled down his briefs, laying them a little bit away on the ground and facing the light.
Sherlock pulled back, surprised but intrigued “You’d… want to do that?”
“I’m bored John!” Sherlock suddenly whined.
John caught up to the, easily ducking under the tape when Sherlock raised it for him.
He snickered, pressing his chest onto Sherlock’s back and kissing his neck softly “Don’t pretend you don’t adore you mum and call her every day anyway” he giggled, the gentle sounds muffles against the curls at Sherlock’s nape.
Well, this took FAR longer than I thought it would. To be completely honest.. life got in the way and I received my very first mean comment in a fic (not this one) and ughhhh I underestimated how horrible it would feel. I shook it off and deleted the comment but damn. People can just be real mean.
John smiled at the memory, trying not to think about the moment he was sorted, how he had missed the icy eyes that were missing from the Ravenclaw table, where they should have been. He shook himself out of it, always getting a strange sinking feeling whenever he thought about his… friend? Ex-friend? He didn’t even know how to address him even now. After not hearing from him all those years, the unanswered letters, the worry…
“But… but she was typing her number on your phone! She was hitting on you” His voice was small and soft, trying to make John understand.
“WATSON GET OUT HERE! GAME’S ABOUT TO START!” Greg’s voice boomed from the other side of the door completely startling both teens and making them jump apart in less than a second.
Sherlock took a deep breath, tearing his eyes away from his friend. Finally, he heard the faint buzz of the fast fluttering of the snitch’s wings and snapped his gaze towards it. There. Glinting in the distance the snitch whizzed past. Sherlock grinned, clutching his broom and then caught sight of Sarah Astley, zooming rapidly towards the small golden ball flying away. Sherlock leaned forward hastily, speeding up and rapidly overtaking the Gryffindor. He whooshed past her and ones of the Gryffindor chasers and towards the Ravenclaw stands, where most of the blue robed Beauxbatons stood shouting and cheering for their team.
biting his lip. John licked his own lips, trying not to move from his pose as he was getting more absorbed into watching Sherlock watching him instead. His breath got slightly more elevated, Sherlock watched the process of his ribs expanding and contracting, toning his waist and chest with every breath for long seconds. The pencil in his hand remained motionless as every student in the class disappeared and his eyes rose to John’s gaze once more.
“We’re pretty sure it was the brother. She supported him financially. After her death, the insurance would have paid him a very handsome sum of money. We have him in the interrogation room” Dimmock announced proudly.
Sherlock smirked, looking smug at catching John staring so blatantly and no doubt, with fully dilated and lustful eyes.
The entire class, including Sherlock, looked up from what they were doing to catch their first glimpse of the new model and were met with the kind eyes of John Watson. His body, however, did not say kind at all. He was a short man there was no denying, no taller than 1.70m, but he was extremely well built and stocky. His entire upper body screamed military as well as the way he held himself when he paused to adjust his bag and take in his surroundings when he walked in. Sherlock swallowed as he took in the rest of the man. He was balancing his weight on a cane but his entire posture was upright as if he was carrying it as an accessory instead of necessity. When he started walking again Sherlock noticed the complete shift as he put his weight onto the cane and limped forward, ‘
“Oh!” John shook himself out of his daydream forcibly.
When he got to the hotel the entire place was covered with police tape. He couldn’t see John anywhere but he hadn’t expected too. John would’ve texted him the second he had gotten there if he were at the hotel already. Predictably, Lestrade was waiting for Sherlock right beside the hotel’s entrance, expression worried and completely relying on Sherlock to figure out what had happened inside.
Sherlock raised his head and met John’s gaze with a naughty smirk “Oh yeah?” he licked his lips, slowly sliding higher onto John’s body and watching his eyes flicker down to his lips.
“Boys. As much as I’d love to let you snog and grope, you’re kind of blocking the hallway? Are either of you planning on buying anything? Because if not…”
“Lestrade, tell me you have a case for me. Anything. No matter how dull”
The Beauxbaton just had the chance to swerve around to see a whooshing bludger Soo Lin had most likely been aiming for moments ago rocketing in his direction. His eyes widened in horror as he froze on the spot.
Soon enough, all ten poses were up and Sherlock granted the class a ten-minute break and instructed them to pin up the best of their gesture pose drawings so the other students could survey them quickly to see each other’s progress. During this first break, most students left the room to get a quick breakfast from the school’s cafeteria and the model usually left for a quick coffee or tea break. John, surprising as he was turning out to be, just reached for his robe, slipped it on and tied the string loosely around his waist. He then climbed off and carefully sat down, wincing slightly in pain before his face relaxed as his weight eased off his injured leg. Sherlock bit the inside of his lip, fighting off the urge to ask John if he was feeling alright. Why did he even care? John was just another model. Granted an interesting one but he didn’t even know the man. But as John stretched his arms over his head and grunted in satisfaction Sherlock found himself completely immersed.
… trembling in his arms, crying out his name. Just that realization triggered his own orgasm and he came deep inside of Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock shook his head “I don’t think so…”
, John marvelled. So they all headed into a store with a big green sign that read “Flourish and Bots”.
school” she scoffed. “Beauxbatons is so much better! So much neater. Everything is perfectly organised and makes sense. This school cannot even begin to compare to-”
“Oh. I- I’m fine. I mean. It’s going fine.” Sherlock cleared his throat pointedly, trying to hide his face under his hair again as John grinned behind him, secretly thrilled at having this effect on the taller boy. He still wasn’t sure where he stood with him, romantic-wise. But this definitely had to be a good sign. And if there was one thing John was good at, it was flirting.
“This..uh is a great start, Sally. Make sure you measure properly by closer observation on the model. But it's great!” he rushed out, careful not to make eye contact in case she could see the red blush he could already feel colouring his cheeks.
“Good,” smiled Molly. “It was just… not a pretty sight. That ball hit you square in the ribs and damn… that crunch…” she shivered. “Not cool”.
they finally did the sexytime...and i wrote it....*blushes profusely and runs away to hide*
Was it considered rude to stare at the woman across the street cooing at the large bat hanging from the dangling cords of her dress? Or was it even worse to stare at the man walking in front of him, who resembled nothing less than a giant with his massive stand and gargantuan hands? John peered at him discreetly; the man was holding in front of himself a large glass tub with a beach ball-sized.. egg? He wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but it looked soft and on the top of the tub, if John leant over, he could just make out the word “Acromantula”. What did that even mean? He shook his head, feeling very small and confused. Perhaps coming here with his sister Harry hadn’t been the best idea, “Diagon Alley”, she’d called it.
John looked around slowly, taking every painting in. There was silence, heavy but not awkward. Sherlock bit his lip and risked looking at John.
He’d felt John being tense over the last couple of days. To be precise since the day John had left to retrieve his homework and left Sherlock in the library. Perhaps John was mad that Sherlock had left? But he had helped him the following day…
Sherlock reluctantly tried his best to hide his smile.
on with the fic?
“Well don’t you look cheerful,” Molly said suddenly, startling John out of his trance.
“Immensely” Sherlock purred. John just snickered.
With experience, Sherlock learned to process every bit of information he saw and he learned which ones would be the most fascinating and challenging to draw and paint. Art school had been a challenge. Not because his mother did not approve, she approved of anything and everything that made him happy. Mycroft did not play any role in this either as he, although did disapprove of Sherlock’s ‘interesting’ career choice, Sherlock could not care less what his brother thought of him. No, Sherlock found art school both liberating and frustrating. Liberating because he could do what he loved every second of every day; frustrating because no matter how many people he saw...No matter how many projects he was assigned in class or he assigned himself he could not fill the void that called for… something.
“That I am Sherlock. That I am. What gave me away? But I do have a reason to visit darling. I came for your help with a problem.”
“Oi. He’s here to help.” Lestrade answered defensively “Sherlock, would you care to explain?”
John’s parents were easily convinced for him to go by himself with the new boy he’d found around the streets of Diagon Alley. Sherlock said his own parents had agreed to meet him at nightfall in a store called “Olivander’s” with his older brother. They spent hours browsing through shops and Sherlock explaining everything they saw and John gawked curiously at.
“John”
Hey HEY! Only TWO weeks of wait! Let's see how long I keep this up.
,’ he thought, ‘
“Sherlock… Oh, Sherlock.” He stepped closer to Sherlock, he could’ve sworn the man was shaking very slightly, nervous. But John finally understood. He finally knew that that kiss hadn’t been a mistake. The mistake was stopping, and letting him go. “If I could draw, or paint.” John continued, barely a foot away from Sherlock now and feeling his body heat. He looked into his eyes, willing him to understand and raising a hand to smooth out the crinkled in-between of Sherlock’s eyebrows. “All I would ever draw would be you.” He moved his hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, feeling the red heat beneath his fingertips.
He had looked… nervous. But…
The blonde drew for another 20 minutes in silence, his brow furrowed in deep concentration. Sherlock steeled himself, trying as hard as he could to keep the pose intact. Being a model was no easy job either, a small part of him felt guilt for the times he’d grown irritated with fidgety models. Keeping the same pose for the last half hour was cramping up his arm painfully. He felt beads of sweat rolling down his long back and brow.
“They’re for protection, not blackmail” She snarled angrily
“Oh. Um. Yes. We.. we should. Definitely.”
Sherlock shook his head “It’s fine, John. I should’ve trusted you. I suppose I’m still getting used to-” he paused and motioned with his free hand between the both of them “This. I- I’ve never done anything of this sort before. My brother always said sentiment was a weakness. A human error”.
“I’m fine. It’s. Hot… in here. That’s all.”
“You’re not going to ask me to dinner?” She pursed her lips in mock annoyance
And quite suddenly John couldn’t help himself any longer. He caught Greg’s happy, understanding eyes and grinned. He then politely but firmly pulled himself away from the team’s embrace and flew upwards into the air, red coat fluttering around his ankles. He zoomed in as fast as he could towards the Slytherin booth, air rushing past and stopped before Sherlock’s surprised figure.
“Anderson. What the hell is this?” Sherlock motioned towards the drawing. “You’re sketching! You’re sketching on me! It’s week 6 of the semester and you’re STILL sketching on me? Move over”
Thank so much for reading, commenting and leaving kudos <3<3 it means a lot<3<3<3
“But- wait! John- I’m in Rav- won’t your friends be-? O-Okay yes yes I’m going”
He turned to watch his friend work. His wild curls fanned over his face as he crouched over the biggest padlock on the heavy chains. His lips moved swiftly, murmuring incantation after incantation. John licked his own lips, watching him raptly. Feeling bold, he came close to his friend, not exactly pressing himself onto him but definitely much closer than necessary. Close enough to feel his friend's body warmth radiate into him.
tried".
“Mike! You’re not supposed to hold the bat with both hands you’ll lose balance!” John shouted
“Hey Sherlock!” he called out, relieved at the sight of the clearly nervous Beauxbatons. Sherlock had just enough time to look up in surprise when John yanked him enthusiastically by the arm and pulled him towards his friends at the Gryffindor table.
Sherlock refused to stop trying. As soon as one experiment proved fruitless he would just scribble out the option on his list and move on to the next. But as the days passed the list became shorter and shorter. John determination to have Sherlock’s magic spark was if anything, becoming more rapacious.
“Everything… good?” the artist wasn’t quite sure what to say.
This, combined with the awful smells they emit caused Mycroft to ban them from the house and Eliza to demand they each take at least 3 baths each before dinner.
They talked idly about the upcoming match as John led them towards one of the largest willow trees along the lake, one he’d found on his fourth year after getting over his phobia of willow trees when he had had a nasty run-in with the Whomping Willow on his first year here alongside Greg.
“Then how will you write me letters?” Sherlock challenged.
Sherlock surged forward in a spasmic arch as sparks of pleasure trickled down and zinged into his every nerve.
Here's the new chapter! Comment and kudos are of course welcome and loved<3<3
?” Sherlock looked absolutely stricken at the idea that one could spend time in Hogwarts more than a day without breaking rules of any kind.
“You could see all that just by yourself? Without any powers?! It wasn’t weird! It was amazing!” John exclaimed excitedly, his eyes shining with admiration for the shorter boy with the curly raven hair.
John just stared at them for a couple of seconds before he burst out chuckling. “Geez, guys. I’m alright! Minor injuries at best. Nothing to worry about” he smiled at them though, appreciating how much his friends had worried about him and feeling rather touched.
Sherlock opened his eyes. The painting in front of him resembled the memory almost exactly. He leaned forward, carefully dabbing his clean paintbrush into a light pink dollop of colour on his palette and peered closely at John’s beaming face. He brushed the tip of the paintbrush delicately over John’s lower lip, the tan colour of his skin’s hue blending easily but distinguished by the shadow below the protruding lip. Sherlock rose his other hand to his face and touched his own mouth, unconsciously mirroring John’s easy smile.
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes wide and hopeful, he said nothing, expecting John to say it for them. To confirm this nagging question in his head and make all of this real.
The students scampered off, which was odd as they usually stayed in for lunch. But they clearly felt dazed and exhausted, the morning never being quite as productive as it had been today. Sherlock quickly asked them to set their homework sketchbooks on the table on their way out for him to check for next week and told them to take 15 minutes extra in their break. The students sighed but did as told, well… most of them. Anderson predictably did not have his homework and came up with a flimsy excuse which Sherlock waved away, not even bothering to look up from his own sketchbook.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffed, as he opened his eyes and glared blearily as John. The look was completely ruined by the adorable sleepy quality to it, though, and all it rose from the Gryffindor was a fond laugh.
“Yeah, I guess. But I saw some real good drawing during the breaks”
They both tried samples of each ingredient. Sherlock determined to see if John had any magical bursts with the increased stimuli of the spice. John coughed out a tiny ball of fire when presented with some of the potion ingredients, and smoke fizzled out from his ears and into the air.
When Sherlock woke he had graphite imprints on his cheek in muddled indistinguishable shape from where he had leant on his drawing that might or might not have been of John’s chest. He looked at his clock, knowing that he did not have a class again until Thursday (tomorrow), but still wanting to get ahead with the day.
“Potion. Experiment I’m working on”
. Something he felt he’d once had but couldn’t find where he lost it.
“Did you see something?” John asked.
Sherlock watched with interest as John’s narrowed eyes slowly tore away from the door and he realized his position.
“Sherlock…” she whispered
“Well I
“Whatever. I got them back for you from that Moran guy did I not? And you swore you would not tell him. And I most certainly won’t. So case closed” He sounded agonized, on the verge of a breakdown and it took all John had not to run and embrace him, demand what was wrong and how he could fix it.

Sherlock had grown up a bit since last time John saw him, he still was around half a head shorter than him (much to Sherlock’s annoyance) but quite a bit of the baby fat had decreased from his cheeks. And his hair, although still stuck up in all directions, no longer bounced from his chubby cheeks and formed a halo around his head. It had now started sticking up around his ears, making wing-like curls surrounding his forehead. It looked adorable. Not that John would admit to it.
Greg rose a sceptical brow “Wait. Are you seriously telling me that John Watson...
. Lips latching and separating over and over again in soft wet whispers of breath in the empty classroom.
John standing on the front steps of the buses, smiling down at Sherlock as sun rays bounced off his golden hair and lightened the deep blue of his eyes by two shades. He recalled his soft cotton shirt stretching across his expanse chest and one of his legs, poised on the step above as if ready but unwilling to turn away and leave into the depths of the bus.
He looked absolutely stunned.
“So in your experience cases like this don’t even add up to a five?” John was asking with disbelief
Sherlock didn’t even pretend to listen, he just shook his head in dismissal of whatever it was he said and kept on peering at the blood results closely, turning to observe the woman again and her background information. Without a word he turned and rushed off.
Slughorn was completely paralyzed as John leaned in close to check for Sherlock’s soft and steady breathing and took his pulse by the wrist.
He opened his eyes, forcing the image of John’s neck and jaw out. This was entirely inappropriate. How would John feel if he knew Sherlock was doing this? It wasn't like he was thinking about John deliberately but still, it was not something Sherlock should be thinking about.
John just looked into his eyes for a few moments, “What’s wrong?” he asked, his voice soft “Did Dimmock say something to you?” He paused. Sherlock opened his mouth but nothing came out.
He wasn’t quite sure where to look.
When they separated both of their eyes were partly glazed and John laughed breathily, still unable to process everything that had just happened.
“I was only angry for a few days. But by then I noticed… I hadn’t received any letters from you. Nothing. I never saw Gladstone and I never heard anything. I waited and waited… thinking perhaps you had fallen ill and were unable to write, but.” Sherlock breath shook. “No letters ever came from you. And just like that it was my worst nightmare come to life. I assumed you had met new people at Hogwarts, better and more interesting people who made you forget all about me. Finally, I went to Beauxbatons Academy and the silence persisted. I found that my peers didn’t… respond well to me. Nor the teachers. I thought about asking someone for their owl so I could reach out to you. I didn’t care if you'd found better friends. If you didn’t care about me anymore. I just- I wanted you back. I wanted my only friend back. Of course, I found no one who was willing to help me out and I admit I was afraid you didn’t even want to hear from me.”
John smiled “I do know…”
The next morning, Sherlock walked into the Great Hall precisely two minutes before John always did. This was because, according to his analyses and calculations, they were now in a relationship.
Sherlock took a deep breath, willing himself to open his eyes and look at John. His eyes were glazed over and whilst he still didn’t meet John’s eye, he handed over the letter to the Gryffindor. John nodded, as silent thanks, and began to read the letter. Instantly, his blood froze over.
He pictured those deep midnight eyes to look at him through heavy lidded eyelids. Sherlock cleared his throat, instantly feeling a blush rising up his throat into his cheeks and feeling uncomfortably tight in his trousers. He didn’t know he could possibly have these impulses, more than once in a week… let alone wanting to… give in to them.
and fond smile. The one that reached his eyes and scrunched up his brow. Sherlock was beginning to realise how much he liked that particular smile when it was directed at him.
“More than okay, but it’s so early. Why don’t you come back here with me?” he opened his arms, still not opening his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay. Enough now. Back to work. It's time for the second pose now, John” he clapped his hands once, calling for the classes attention. No one really left the room for this second break so everyone just raised their gazes from their phones or stopped their friendly conversation with John and walked back to their drawings, changing the pages carefully as to not tear them in the process.
In the end, he needn’t have worried, the blonde just turned around and leant on the side of the table. “So...” he started “Anything on with your cases?” he sounded just as curious as he had last week, even without the need to keep himself distracted from the pain in his leg.
his day off.
John looked up at the door across the small room. Who on earth could that be? He wasn’t expecting anyone. He’d paid his rent on time… right?...yes. Yes he had! John stood up and walked over just as the knocks resounded again, the sudden image of Sherlock behind the door flashed momentarily through his mind but he dismissed the thought forcibly. Sherlock should never come here and see the conditions in which John was currently living. Why on earth would he come over for any reason anyway?
John nodded thoughtfully.
. He thought sadly, wondering how Irene connected with broomstick wood and summer if she couldn’t even play Quidditch and, as far as John knew she and Sherlock had never spent time together during the summer. Or had they?. Had Sherlock been hiding this relationship for longer than 5 days? Had he been hiding it for months? ...Years??
He reached up to Gladstone with the note, an apologetic look in his eyes. “Sorry buddy, last one tonight I promise”
She kept babbling about materials she needed and John’s parents followed her lead, looking slightly disturbed but mostly completely indifferent to their surroundings, unlike John who was gaping at every passing store and every fascinating passerby. They’d only been here for a couple of hours but their parents were growing impatient. Harry took no notice and keep prattling about the books she needed before she could go hunting for a cauldron and a wand. ‘
“Team!” He shouted, catching their attention instantly. “Let’s stop slacking off and let's play some real Quidditch!” he grinned. A small part of him couldn’t help but want to show off a little bit in front of his curly haired friend.
Sherlock nodded “Fantastic, John. What do you think about this ring?”
Whatever the reason Sherlock couldn’t just pass up on the opportunity to see John again next week. For two whole classes. Hours and hours of John time. Wonderful.
His job as a figure drawing teacher was interesting enough, he thought, as he could observe the students and the models and their behavior for several hours at a time. Maybe he’d find the missing link in this painting while he was at it- ‘
The boy in front of him snorted “Of courthe not don’t be thilly! I’m clearly around the thame age as you if not the exact thame. People under the age of theventeen can’t uthe magic outside of thchool everyone knowth that”
.” He looked back at Sherlock “I don’t anymore. But I did. Coming back here… having to work as a model because my hand shook too much to be a surgeon…after years and years of helping people, saving lives. I guess… I missed the thrill of the adrenaline” he scoffed “You must think I’m crazy”
John smiled, feeling his eyes welling up slightly with the rush of emotion “And I love
“I know it’s fine” Sherlock finally turned and met his eyes. Whatever moment they were about to have however was interrupted as the elevator doors opened and a gasping Lestrade appeared before them.
Good enough. It didn’t sound too desperate… he didn’t think so anyway. Sherlock
-invalided from either Afghanistan or Iraq
John giggled, stopping in place and turning to Sherlock. He looked up at him, pride shining in his eyes at having people finally recognizing how tremendously talented the man before him was. And this was just the start of it. He could see Sherlock’s career stretched before them. The galleries and event he’d get to have. The people they’d get to meet. He was so overjoyed at how Sherlock’s hard work was paying off, how even if the artist denied it he LOVED being here, in his first solo gallery. How in this moment, he loved being Sherlock Holmes.
his shoulder John might’ve added.
looked, and paused his hurried apology. “Oh” he said again, evidently noticing what Sherlock was sure were rather impressively sized pupils, a strong pulse beating in his neck and dark flushed cheeks. His apologetic expression instantly turned smug. “You liked that?” he murmured curiously, stepping closer and wrapping his arms once again around the artist’s waist.
John laughed “You love it” he teased, obviously joking, but Sherlock’s cheeks instantly darkened several shades and he cleared his throat, not expecting the teasing remarks John usually made to be said in front of his students. They probably knew anyway, right? Sherlock
“I...” Sherlock muttered. “Fine. I might’ve been the cause of the potion exploding. But how was I supposed to expect that it would affect every spider in a 20km radius so drastically?”
and waited.
John closed his eyes as he practically dragged himself down the corridor. It was 5 O’clock in the evening, his very first shift this year walking the corridors as a Prefect. And he hoped to Merlin he wouldn’t run into anyone because in the mood he was in he would deduct points for basically anything.
Sherlock gulped visibly, his blush darkening several shades. He nodded, word getting stuck on the way out of his throat.
To say ‘probably six pack’ had been a complete understatement. John was… absolutely ripped. Sherlock had to blink at least four times before the alarms in his mind palace could be silenced from the seconds of internal panic and the rush of blood not knowing whether to go upwards and pool in his already flaming cheeks or… lower. And now that he observed John without a shirt one of the first things that his eye was drawn to was the messy and extensive scar that spread in the blonde’s right shoulder. So clearly he had linked the pain of the bullet tearing through him onto his leg instead of his shoulder. And judging by the scar the wound had not been painless at all.
John groaned, scribbling out the hundredth attempt at a letter for Sherlock. He was determined to have this conversation with him once and for all, and he figured… if it was written down he wouldn’t have to die of mortification with whatever answer Sherlock gave. If Sherlock was indeed looking to avoid him, he could just write it down and then John would quietly slip into the gloom of embarrassment and hide out whenever he saw Sherlock anywhere in his proximity. Simple enough.
“I think we have divination soon, John”
The class wore on sluggishly, in the break John had gotten a phone call. Sherlock tried not to think too hard about that. The good news was the blonde seemed quite annoyed as he had walked out of the room to answer, maybe even surprised that whoever was calling was doing so. Maybe he had gone out with the woman but they hadn’t had a good time. Maybe he would not see her again! Sherlock tried to suppress his tiny smug smile.
made him feel a bit warmer inside. “Fine,” he agreed, wrapping his own arms around John’s neck, “We’ll go. But you are dealing with the consequences,” he sniffed and made to walk away to his room but John placed his hands on his hips and pulled him back towards his chest.
but those deep eyes that held so much weight in their stare. So much loss.
Sherlock rolled his eyes good-naturedly and started walking into the shop. “No! Sherlock! …… Wait!”.
Sherlock looked up, raising his head from John’s chest to meet his eyes. If anything, just the fact that he was holding John in his arms right now was, to him, ultimate proof that anything could get better. That his eternal belief in his fate for loneliness was wrong and if something as wonderful as John could happen to him… great things could happen to anyone. And John of all people deserved only good things.
“It’s all fine Mike I’ll meet you there.” John smiled looking back at Mike “Tell the team to go change. I’ll uhh… be right there.” and then he ran out of the hall as fast as his legs would carry him. He was completely decided upon finding out what Sherlock and Irene were doing once and for all.
“Alright alright. Let’s get moving then. I’m pretty sure there’s a hidden door under all those vines over there. Come on!”
Still. Kissing him had been wrong. No matter how good it had felt. He should’ve made his intent clear and let Sherlock take the step. Especially if he had never kissed anyone. Which John doubted, considering how gorgeous Sherlock was. He must be lined up with romantic candidates. Maybe he even had a relationship right now and his significant other would now be hunting John down for taking their boyfriend’s plush pink lips.
“So you’re telling me… there are 200 different types of unicorn hair but only 3 are good for wand power?”
“The uh...J-John…” Sherlock gasped, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back onto John’s shoulder. John chuckled breathily, his hands now roaming onto Sherlock’s chest and sliding onto his hips, suggestively dipping the tips of his fingers below the artist’s silky boxer briefs.
“Oh! It’s even better than I imagined! I can’t believe we haven’t been here all year! Such a waste of time!”
Feeling pleasantly surprised, Sherlock had informed John of the case and so, after the lesson they had both headed down to the crime scene together. Lestrade was waiting for them in front of the yellow police tape, instantly launching into a long explanation of the murder scene and their theories so far. A woman had been found dead in her bathtub, no signs of any sort of known drug in her system and no signs of forced entry. She was just… dead. She had lived with her slightly younger brother who had found her when he arrived home, the neighbors had nothing suspicious to say about her or anyone she knew, as far as they were concerned she was a private and quiet person who took care of her brother.
“Sure thing” John bit Sherlock’s lower lip and pulled it gently, caressing the sting with his tongue and raised himself up to those gorgeous pink lips.
“You're right. They really really do” he laughed.
“No..” he murmurs, truthfully. After everything that had happened Sherlock had absolutely no idea how John could’ve forgiven him so easily. How he would’ve put his safety in harm's way just for him! Why would anyone do that? And it wasn’t the first time he’d done it either! John had saved him from Anderson just a couple of months ago!
“Not yet, love. I can’t have you hurting” John kissed down the inside of his thigh once more, twisting and curling his fingers and essentially driving Sherlock mad. His kisses went down and down until he teasingly bit lightly at one of Sherlock’s arse cheeks before getting increasingly close to his entrance. Sherlock held his breath in anticipation.
Greg laughed, easily dodging the goopy substance, Molly was not so lucky.
“Angelo?” Sherlock called, trying his best to look over the counter but so far nothing but his world unruly curls popped out. Angelo turned around and catching sight of them grinned widely.
John’s gaze flickered over Sherlock one last time as he realised they hadn’t said anything in about a minute and the bus driver had coughed politely to get John’s attention at least twice. John tore his gaze away from the raven haired professor and cleared his throat, opening his mouth to say something but the door began to close in front of him and instead he only exclaimed “See you next week then?” and Sherlock, still seeming pretty stunned just nodded.
“I’m fine. This was barely a 4” Sherlock shrugged. He nodded at John, who getting the hint turned to leave the scene with one last concerned look at the man lying at the center of the room. Sherlock began to follow but before he left completely he quickly turned to Lestrade “Thank you” he whispered.
John took Sherlock to the room of requirement, which he found in his second year at Hogwarts when he’d been home sick (Sherlock’s house was home, right?) and had somehow found a room with a working TV and a collection of his favourite movies. How these items even worked was a mystery. Electricity and technology, in general, went haywire when in Hogwarts. It was something about there being too much magical energy. But within this room… everything worked. Well, it did glitch every few minutes, but it worked pretty well aside from that.
ok OK. I KNOW it took another month. *inserts apologies* *you say you dont believe me anymore* *I ask for another chance* ...you know the drill....
John looked at him seriously, “I could be the seeker”.
Sherlock had kissed John, as soon as both their eyes were closed he let some of the tears roll down his cheeks. Thankfully, John’s arms had remained around his waist and hair and he never felt the wetness of Sherlock’s eyes. And he had perhaps confused his quiet sobs as panting breaths.
“Brother dear, where on earth are you going with such a hurry?” Mycroft Holmes drawled out.
Yours Sincerely,
Taking the hint, John opened his mouth against Sherlock’s and traced his tongue with his own. And then it was all the wet heat of another mouth, the warmth of another tongue curling against his and the soft plush of pulling lips. He bit Sherlock’s delectable lower lip and was rewarded with the sound of the artist moaning in surprise into his mouth. Sherlock tasted of honey and tea and John never wanted to taste any other pair of lips.
Sherlock surveyed the phone for a second before shaking his head and walking purposively out of the classroom.
“No, my darling! Why would you even think that!” Trelawney said, pressing a hand to her heart.
In the midpoint of the night, as Sherlock was able to zone out a little during the interviews he surveyed his surroundings. The turn out was even better than he had expected, even after gaining a bit of a following after the last gallery. He was pleased to see people recognizing John delightedly and asking him about modelling experience, as he enjoyed the light in John’s eyes at being valued and looked up to. His John. His reason of being here. His muse.
“Lead the way!” John grinned.
“So, I haven’t displayed signs of magic yet,” Sherlock said suddenly. “But, I have come to the conclusion that strong emotional bursts could be the necessary means to trigger it. If my hypothesis is correct all we need to do is cause a surge of adrenaline on my system and finally... boom” he stopped his frantic pacing and turned to John, grinning and spreading his arms as wide as he could. “I’ll have magic”.
“What? You've missed the food? Or us?” Molly laughed
“No idea,” John said, already standing up and wiping the remnants of his toast with the back of his hand. “I’ll be… right back. Maybe” he murmured and stood up to follow Sherlock. The time for unspoken things was done. And John was going to be there for Sherlock whether he wanted to or not. Clearly whatever was on that letter was not good. And there was no way in hell John was going to let his friend suffer about it all alone.
John bit his lip to keep from interrupting his story. But he placed a firm hand on Sherlock’s thigh and gave a reassuring squeeze to go on. The urge to take him in his arms consuming him whole.
They entered the class in silence and took their usual seats at the back of the class, John pointedly not looking at Sherlock.
They played until the sun began to set and the sky was a vibrant mixture of orange and purple. The dark clouds swirled 'round with the fall wind and stirred up the leaves on the trees surrounding the pitch, sending dry leaves flying all around them, disturbed only by their flying and twirling them onto different directions (sometimes each other’s faces).
“So... how was your class today?” John asked, clearly wanting to break the ice that had formed between them once more.
had introduced you to. I felt robbed. Unreasonably betrayed. During my family's move to France my father gave away most of our things, my owl included. The only one that remained was the house owl, whom I was not allowed to use”. Sherlock swallowed, and sat up straighter, their thighs were still touching as they looked at each other, but there was no other point of contact.
John turned to face a very nervous looking Sherlock Holmes, a shy smile pulling at his lips.
“I took it easy on you.” Sherlock said to the pages of ‘Hogwarts, A History’.  “Besides,” Sherlock finally looked up to meet John’s eyes. “We practiced as Quidditch beaters. You’ve never seen me play seeker”.
Sherlock desisted from his grunting whilst putting all of his weight into forcing books into his suitcase and fell back onto the pillows. “We’re gonna need a bigger case”, he muttered.
Hello <3! We finally reach the final chapters. This chapter is rather short-- kind of a pre-epilogue if you will. The final chapter (the epilogue) should be posted in about a week.
Good. Solid start, solid start. Now what? A question? Help with homework, perhaps? No. Too cold. No Quidditch talk, Molly had said. An invitation? To… hang out? John bit his lip. This really shouldn’t be as hard as it was shaping up to be. Okay. Focus Watson. It’s just Sherlock.
“I used to” Sherlock smiled
dating him….. yes…. okay…. see you then mummy…. goodbye… yes….. I will…. Okay… loveyoutoo…..goodbye” he clicked off the phone and made completely sure it was off before he turned to John.
John watched the scenery passing through the window thinking about Sherlock. He’d hoped to thank him for the limp.
Sherlock had seen Irene instantly as she was approaching him with a predatory glance in the library. He scanned her with a quick glance up her body: Freshly applied lipstick, top three shirt buttons opened, hair loose, skirt fixed up for maximum amount of skin exposed... lack of pupil dilation and normal steady pulse. Conclusion: Not a romantic approach, so a query or favour needed. Disguise: For pretense or temptation. Probability: Pretence 79% temptation 21%.
John smiled as if understanding, “the 'catching up'! Come on! I’ll give you a tour of the castle grounds and everything. It's your first week at Hogwarts! At last!”
He couldn’t meet his eye without
“John?” it came out as barely a rush of breath.
Sherlock had looked away first, feeling his entire body heating up faster than he thought was even possible. And when he’d looked back John had been gazing into the lake, a small smug smile on his face. The Beauxbatons had been sure John had known Sherlock was staring at him but for some reason… he’d let him look.
Sherlock reached down with a shaking hand and took John in hand, marveling at feeling the thickness and the warmth of this man’s erection for the very first time. It was so much larger than he had pictured. He squeezed, rewarding instantaneously by John’s reverberating groan. “Oh Sherlock” he hissed
Hopefully, this wasn't too sappy-- i keep getting carried away. These two are WAY too into each other. Like, boys.. pls... you're in public...
John sighed, almost in relief. “Right umm… I’ll take care alright?”.
Sherlock nodded eagerly, wanting nothing more than for things to go back to normal between them. Like when they were kids… but he wasn’t sure how to go about it. “Sure,” he said, smiling back. This, at least, was a start.
After a few confused second the blonde let out a loud happy laugh “Right. Of course, that’s where you were going with that” he beamed up at the taller man, looking as if he’d never seen anything so wonderful in all his life.
Lestrade was calling after them but John didn’t stop, he sensed Sherlock didn’t want to be there one more second.
Soon enough Sherlock’s toes were curling and he was pulsing in John’s hand and spilling against their stomach’s between them, gasping out and whimpering, his other hand grasping John tightly and digging his nails into the small of John’s back desperately.
John huffed a laugh and shook his head “Nothing Greg don’t worry about it. Come on let’s go practice” He motioned towards the pitch with a nod of his head and started walking.
No had one questioned him, everyone, however, looked utterly and completely… unsurprised? Sherlock’s eyes had narrowed. He’d had expected at least some reaction from the class overall. Looking around the only thing out of the ordinary had been Mike and Molly who had been looking at each other with excited grins and raised eyebrows. Molly had looked at Sherlock quickly, and back to Mike. Sherlock got the impression that they were sharing the same train of thought, whatever it was, Sherlock had no idea. Molly looked oddly, proud.
“Hi, Sherlock!” Molly grinned
“You’re ridiculous” Sherlock giggled
Molly rested her head on her hand, thinking. “Hmmm… well. You can’t just spring it on him. You’re right about that. He’d just become uncomfortable. Maybe... find a way to get him alone. Just the two of you, and actually have a conversation with him. Not just Quidditch talk. Hang out somewhere other than in the classroom or the field. And then ease into the subject”.
Sherlock huffed out a laugh “I require very little food, John. I function perfectly throughout the day without it”.
Sherlock licked his rosy lips “Well... it's getting rather late.”
How could he not when Sherlock was suddenly always absent during the Quidditch practice sessions. Something he had never done before in the time they had been friends, and especially not if the captain had an important match (like against Slytherin) coming up.
Not a pin drop could be heard as Sherlock walked around behind them, hands grasped in each other behind his back and peered at everyone’s drawings. His first lap had only a couple of tut’s so that the students would know to fix whatever they could before his second lap. Molly received a single nod in her direction, and Anderson received an exasperated sigh.
Sherlock immersed himself into refining his knowledge of all the first year lesson books they’d bought and joined the quiet negation of the darkness surrounding the Holmes house. John sat by him, finding shapes in the clouds and wondering if these 5 days could go any faster.
“Hello, Mr Holmes. You look awfully sexy today” Irene purred as she took a seat next to him
Countless of “It’s not what it looks like” and “We can explain” resounded from all of them, until a horrified Sherlock raised his hand for silence and asked directly “What’s going on?”
Sherlock nodded furiously, still unable to tear out the words from his throat but very decisively trying to reassure John that that was VERY much okay.
“You were looking for ´The complete origin story of the Pygmy Puff?” she asked dubiously.
A thought, however, popped into Sherlock’s slowly whirring back into place after the mind shattering sex. “John?” he whispered into the darkness.
Harry, stirred by John’s surprised reaction, moved her head lazily from the screen and peered above her younger brother’s blonde head, her mouth dropping open almost instantly and one of the chips she’s been mindlessly eating falling onto her lap.
Sherlock just stared back and tried to believe him.
“Looks alright. Just a small cut and some bruising… when we get back we should probably disinfect it and put some ice on it, though.”
to talk to him,” said Molly. “As uncomfortable as it may seem… it’ll be better in the long run. The more you delay this conversation, the worse its gonna get. No good comes from holding things back.”
At last, Sherringford turned towards Eliza and stormed out of the room. Eliza looked at both boys in worry and apology before following him out of the room. The door closed behind them with a soft click.
Greg jogged a couple of steps in front of his friend as soon as they reached the field and joined the rest of the team, blushing slightly as he spotted Molly Hooper in the crowd of fans they had gathered through the 2 years of not losing a single Quidditch game, thanks to Captain Watson. He was all set to at least try to talk to her when John commanded firmly that practice had begun in a tense, rather than his usual gentle, tone. The team, immediately sensing John’s mood, quickly arranged themselves in their brooms and bid goodbye to the girls as these backed away towards the stands where Sherlock usually sat, blue Ravenclaw scarf always wrapped up tightly around his pale neck during the fall and winter, to watch John play through his gray calculating eyes.
Though.. now that they had grown up and now that John was allowed to feel more than just platonic feelings towards his Beauxbatons friend…. He definitely could appreciate the view when Sherlock bent to look at some of the fake wands in the bottom shelf. He appreciated it even
The door to Sherlock’s room opened.
“I don’t know John…” Eliza finally whispered. “But whatever happens to Sherlock. Whoever he turns out to be… we’ll always be here for him.”
Sherlock startled back in surprise, tearing his gaze away from John onto the thin white envelope. “That’s… unexpected. I don’t usually get… hmm”
John looked back at the drawing. He saw himself covering the entire off-white page, his figure lightly outlined with graphite. The shadows were stark, completely making his knees and shoulders pop. John stared into his own eyes on the page, feeling the remnants of the intensity with which he and Sherlock had stared at each other across the room. It was fascinating, seeing oneself the way someone else saw you. Especially through the eyes of the genius that was the man sitting beside him. Even now he could feel the tingle of Sherlock’s gaze on his side, clearly evaluating every reaction John gave to the drawing. How could someone so talented be so doubtful of their own gift?
Sighing Sherlock closed the door again, his head falling forwards with a light thump onto the cold wood of the door, reaching down to lock it, just in case.
“How did you get that?” John asked, peering into the folder as Sherlock opened it beside him to show John. The main picture displayed a woman in her dressing gown, laying on a wooden floor with bruises around her neck. The pictures beneath that one were all similar. Men and women killed in different ways, all seemingly attacked when least expecting it, none of them holding weapons in return. John could see tiny notes scribbled onto the side of the picture, where Sherlock had made all his observations. He could make out the words “180 cm” and “unfaithful” but not much else.
John’s hand instantly lowered to cover it, squeezing possessively and glaring at Victor as he finally disappeared behind a corner. Sherlock yelped in part surprise and part giddiness as John’s hand squeezed, feeling so absolutely dazed by the over show of dominance on John’s part. It made his blood boil hot for an entirely new reason. Much more interesting reason. His John. Jealous over him.
Sherlock whimpered nails digging into John’s back, needing something to ground him, needing John to ground him. Soft little groans escaped him as he felt the weight of John’s cock dragging wetly against his hip, panting against Sherlock’s neck. “Sher-” the blonde purred.
“Oh! How wonderful!” Eliza cried happily, finally reaching Sherlock and embracing him tightly. “Sherlock’s brother Mycroft also has his first year at Hogwarts! Our little Sherlock was so jealous he-”
He closed his eyes, knowing that whatever he was feeling was probably heightened by finally seeing Sherlock’s handwriting on a paper, after all these years of waiting for it. He opted to answer anyway, regardless of however upset he was feeling. He reached for another piece of empty parchment from his bedside table and scribbled a response.
John turned again, unable to stop himself and for the first time, Sherlock
Sherlock flushed instantly, remembering the intoxicating and overwhelming smell of John all around him.
“Finally!” Sherlock suddenly exclaimed, leaping surprisingly fast from his seat and almost toppling it over in the process.
?” he asked in return, just as confusedly, his tone stunned. “You… that thing you just did… you”
He stared at his phone intently. Willing it to beep. To vibrate. To do something. He narrowed his eyes at it, gaze rapidly flicking to the signal bars and back to the messages icon. The clock at the very back of the class ticked sluggishly, every second longer than the one before… until eons later (probably just a few minutes but Sherlock counted every moment of it) his phone beeped. Sherlock jumped in his seat in shock and looked around himself, making sure he was still alone and no one had been around to witness that.
Headmistress Minerva McGonagall
Sherlock huffed half annoyed and half amusedly. He looked back at John’s painting, thinking.
made it explicitly clear to anyone interested that he wasn’t one to introduce to your parents. He wasn’t one to fall in love with. Sure, John had liked a lot of people... some of them quite a lot, but he was missing something… he never quite felt a pull towards any of them. He was missing…
They main library was already locked up so they quietly whispered an ‘Alohomora’ charm, made sure the librarian had definitely left the premises, and snuck into the darkened halls of the massive library. Already John felt his heart race with the promise of danger that came with breaking the rules. How had he never even thought about doing this before tonight? Sure he, Greg and Molly had not exactly STUCK to the rules in previous years, but aside from a few rather terrifying trips to the forbidden forest with his friends and a rather embarrassing encounter with Moaning Myrtle on a couple of his make out sessions with one of his ex-flings John had never really done anything after curfew.
Thank you so much for leaving kudos and commenting <3<3<3
“Of course. My flat is larger and closer to the school, and you clearly disliked your flat to a certain level judging by the slight scrunch of your nose and stutter in step every time we walk into it and the soft frustrated sighs whenever the hot water malfunctions, yet again. The creases in your shirts are also telltale; ready to pack for whenever you’re staying over. You dislike staying at your own place” he shrugged.
John stopped in front of the bench right in front of Greg and Molly, who stopped their conversation and looked curiously between John and Sherlock, smiling politely. Molly turned to John, her eyes glinted knowingly.
John peered closer. “Doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen in class so far” he observed, curiously.
Sherlock shrugged “if I remember correctly he has an above average aim, it’s true.” He turned to John, smiling smugly “But I’m much faster.”
Sherlock had booked him for this class, a little nervous as to whether John would be okay with that but convincing himself to book him anyway. The blonde sure seemed okay to be here class again, all smug eyes and dazzling grins. He walked over to the changing screen and the professor instantly looked down to his paper, heart beating fast.
Sherlock, oblivious to John’s internal struggle proceeded to flop down onto the snow and turned his foot as much as he could and pointed his want to it. “Aguamenti,” he commanded, and a rush of water squirted from the tip of his wand. “Glacius!” he exclaimed, a few seconds later. The result was the sole of his shoe was coated in a layer of solid, semi-transparent ice. Sherlock grinned triumphantly. “This should be enough… seems to be thick enough”.
There was a part of him.. the one was currently trying to quiet down that knew and acknowledged he had missed Sherlock deeply from the moment they’d been separated. But there was another part of him that seethed at the lack of explanations as to why they hadn’t seen each other. Because it certainly hadn’t been John’s fault. He’d sent Gladstone with countless letters. But week after week, month after month and year after year each, every single one of them had remained unanswered. He’d gotten no sign whatsoever that Sherlock would or even wanted to ever see or speak to him again. And now he’d just showed up at his class and after just a look had opted for ignoring John. Again. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t recognised him. John could very well see that Sherlock simply had chosen not to acknowledge the fact that their eyes had met, and all the history behind them.
“Hoo hoo!” Mrs. Hudson, his landlady, peeked her head inside the room. “I came by to dust and noticed your fridge contents have still not gone down, so I brought you some tea and sandwiches” she came into the room, opening the door with her hip. Sherlock came over to her side and took the tray from her hands. She was wearing a deep burgundy dress and kitten heels, her silvering hair pulled up into a loose bun, as familiar as ever.
She closed her eyes tightly.
The class was drawing faster than ever, better than ever. Even Anderson was hanging on to Sherlock’s every word. The professor had never revealed that he had another job, let alone one as interesting as a consulting detective that went on to crime scenes and caught criminals red handed.
The students loved Irene. For one, with her complete sureness with her own body she was unselfconscious to change poses dramatically and unexpectedly. She also had quite a tongue on her, often responding to some of the more scathing comments Sherlock gave his students with clever sarcastic remarks. All in good nature of course. Irene was nothing if not fun. She was not afraid to correct Sherlock’s lighting of her figure, pointing out that if anyone knew the female body it was her. She was also completely and 100 percent proud and unapologetic over her sexuality.
John whistled under his breath. “Sounds… supernatural”
John.
John complied, setting himself down onto the floor of the platform and kneeling.
Tick tick tick
“I did NOT”
“Still…” John shifted against the bed, feeling its soft surface slide against his back. “Are you gonna go... home? Or are you staying here?”
As expected John’s parents had let him go without a second thought, barely lifting their gazes from their phones to nod and make an approving sort of hum at John’s request. Soon after, Harry had left for Hogwarts and returned with many tales and descriptions, most of the things she said, however, were things John already knew as he spent that first summer asking everything he could think of to Sherlock and his mother. He had barely seen Sherlock’s father around, it seemed he travelled for work quite a lot and whenever he was there he never seemed to be in a good mood at all. Sherlock shrugged when John asked about this, however. He said it was nothing out of the ordinary but John caught the depth of Sherlock’s indifference as a sign that it was a sore topic he shouldn’t bring up again.
He smiled. Thinking about how familiar this all seemed now, 2 years later. He closed his eyes, listening to Sherlock murmur something about an experiment next to him and thought about that very first summer
John pressed him back onto his desk, the artist intuitively raised himself and sat on the table so the blonde could press himself closer to him and their heights evened out. John’s hands roamed over his back and his tongue curled around his. Sherlock let out an involuntary moan, convincing himself that any second now he would pull away and they would talk. Any second now.
Most of the yard was busy screaming at Sherlock and each other so John, not exactly knowing how to play it was sort of lingering in the sidelines.
John couldn’t resist one last shot at it. Damn his dignity. If Sherlock wanted to sit with him that had to mean something, right? Unless it was pity? It didn’t look like it though. John cursed inwardly. Why was this so difficult?
“Yes. They’re you… For you.” Sherlock murmured softly, heart in his throat, but unable to stop looking at John. He looked so beautiful under the pale lights and the moonlight streaming through the window. John approached the very first painting, the one where he was getting onto the bus.
John snorted. Not what Sherlock expected at all “Still hurts” he muttered good-naturedly, huffing a bit.
“Of course he does John, it's his name”
The elevator doors opened and John could
admired him, he added to himself with a smirk. He looked around, expecting to see the familiar blond head and the telltale happy grin around the corner any time now.
“Fine. But you come back here for the game. I actually secretly hate these things. Nothing interesting EVER happens.” She sighed
Sherlock closed in on the golden sphere inches away from the tip of his broom, he stretched out his hand and… Sarah cut through Sherlock’s path, whooshing past him and sending the snitch flying in a completely different direction. The push forced Sherlock to dodge her by ducking in a dangerously steeped dive. Sarah was taken by surprise by the fast move and almost crashed into Soo Lin, who was focused on something else in the distance, bat at the ready. She lost her balance and dragged Sarah in. A tangle of frantic limbs clutched at the still airborne broom as Sarah’s crashed into the ground.
Sherlock growled in frustration as he missed the second Quaffle by a hair. “NO!”
They reached the metal gates that led to the restricted section and found that a single ‘Alohomora’ charm wasn’t enough. Clearly one of the library staff had noticed someone had broken in, after Sherlock had, about a month ago. Sherlock fiddled with a couple other charms whilst John looked out for Filch or Mrs Norris. The library sure was quiet at night, John thought. All he could really hear was his and Sherlock’s breathing and the quiet murmurs coming out of Sherlock’s mouth as he attempted to break the spells binding the gates shut.
Shorter chapter-- Next will be the last kidlock. Then the teenlock shenanigans begin <3!
“You!” he pointed at John. “Care to tell me what the hell you were doing?” he took several strides until he was inches away from John, rage simmering in his eyes.
Sherlock smiled proudly.
Sheringford left on another business trip a few days later, much to John’s relief. He could feel the atmosphere in the house lighten up completely when the pressure of the man’s shadow wasn’t eclipsing the summer sun. His gaze was no longer stuck to Sherlock, in expectation of greatness, of a sudden surge of magical ability. And Sherlock, although still anxious, was no longer cowed to a corner in shame.
“John!” Sherlock giggled, his hands rose up to the blonde's nape and pulled him down, urging their mouths to lock again, grinning. The other man just laughed smugly, their kiss more of a pressing of giddy grins but neither caring too much. Sherlock ground himself as best as he could against John, delighted to feel an answering bulge just beneath the single layer of clothing.
“Yeah... proper wizards” John sighed, his insides warm.
John cleared his throat, his face colouring up a little. “Oh, right. Sorry”
won the match so- if anyone should be rewarded it’s me” Sherlock argued.
-24-25 years of age
“This.” He said again “Be… friendly… with each other”
The fighting continued. John wasn’t sure if he was more surprised that it kept going or that he could hear Eliza was fighting back with fervour, an anger in her that he’d never heard before or that Sherlock insisted on not knowing or hearing any word they said. Whenever they came in range of hearing the shouts he would get up and come up with a new game or an experiment he assured they absolutely needed to do before they went to Hogwarts.
Sherlock couldn’t help the tiny giddy giggle that escaped his lips. After their afternoon together on Tuesday and their equally wonderful morning on Wednesday, they hadn’t seen each other. With each other’s full classes and differing schedules they hadn’t been able to make the time.
John shook his head, clearing his mind from the whirring and confusing memories and turned once again to see if he could spot Sherlock anywhere. This time his eyes caught on the inky black curls of his friend, lingering close to the Gryffindor table and looking unsure as to where to sit or what to do. John’s heart swelled with affection.
“At first.. when you left. I was angry at you. Irrationally, of course. Because you got to live my dream and I did not. A dream that
As much care as John had given him, the first breach into his body was still quite painful, his eyes drawing shut immediately with the overwhelming feeling of the pain/pleasure and his mouth opening in surprise.
“I knew it!” John cried joyously and proceeded to tickle Sherlock on the ribs as best as he could with his glove-covered hands.  Sherlock squirmed and squirmed under him, squealing with a higher pitched laugh than John thought Sherlock could have. He tried to bat John away between giggles but to no avail. John tore off his gloves and just poked and prodded at Sherlock’s sides and armpits and neck.
“Well, it wasn’t MY idea to camp in the middle of NOWHERE!”
John, however, looked completely unfazed by Sherlock’s words and instead he smiled “I suppose you’re right. They're very nice kids, though”
ill update some time next week <3<3
John walked out of the changing screen. “Everything alright?” he asked, seeing how fast Sherlock was packing up all his things into his bag, rushed but still managing to be careful of his most precious pencils and drawing charcoal.
They were lying together in bed, his head on John’s warm naked chest and the blonde’s hand caressing the sides of his bare torso. There was still a slight gasp  to their breathing, the sex that had ensued after they had burst into the flat finished barely minutes ago.
Sherlock didn’t answer.
John hummed “Well... maybe” kiss on Sherlock’s forehead “I could...” kiss on Sherlock’s nose “just take..” Kiss on Sherlock’s lips “it off” he kissed Sherlock’s lips again, stroking his tongue against Sherlock’s before taking said tongue into his mouth and sucking it lightly. Sherlock’s breath hitched.
AT LAST. FINALLY! IT ONLY TOOK THEM 40K BLOODY WORDS. THIS WHOLE STORY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A ONE-SHOT, DAMMIT.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mmmmno,” the other man mumbled. His voice was muffled against what he was pretty certain was the very center of a warm naked chest. Wisps of air he processed as quiet laughter blew against his hair, lightly ruffling its wild strands.
John couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be.
, John thought.
“Of course John” Sherlock answered just as softly, preserving their small moment.
“So, tea before the case files?” Sherlock asked, a little bit at a loss of what to do know that John was here.
Sherlock nodded, eyes shut tight and mouth parted
Sherlock reached into his robes and drew out a long list.
“If you like I could show you the rest of the files I have on cases. Once, I got a solid 10. Took 2 months to crack the case and I slept around 5 times in total. It was brilliant”
John smiled, confused about the warmth in his stomach, but unable to summon up the will to question or stop it.
“Coming?”, John asked, from the door. “I still have to beat your arse again at Quidditch”. He smiled softly, revealing a trace of the John Sherlock remembered. Though a commotion of emotions was still fighting to take over under his blue eyes.
The morning after he’d slept over at John’s place, Sherlock had tried his best to act normal for him. John had not mentioned the woman at all. Instead, he’d dedicated his morning to taking care of Sherlock, kissing him and caressing him until Sherlock was writhing against his sheets, all thoughts of pain momentarily forgotten within the red heat of John’s wet mouth around him.
All night they had talked, easy conversation flowing between them, the wine urging the need to lean closer and closer in search of each other’s touch. The artist’s deep laughter echoed in John’s chest and he felt less and less focused on the time or the place and more on the man. He hated that he had hurt him, however unintentionally, but was glad that there seemed to be a broken barrier between them now. They felt more relaxed to bring down their own walls.
If he’d been hoping for a few minutes alone to go over the entire evening and its endless possible implications well… he’d been sadly wrong. As soon as he mumbled the newest password to the Fat Lady (“hound”), and he’d stepped into the orange warmth of the familiar room draped in Gryffindor colours he was practically tackled by two vociferous bodies.
“Let’s leave. Now,” Sherlock gasped out when they separated some moments later. Even he could tell that if they did this any longer it would become inappropriate for his public image really fast.
Mrs. Hudson smiled “Its no trouble dear. But don’t get used to it. I’m still not your housekeeper. This is a one-time thing”.
Sherlock sighed “I called her 4 days ago. She’s just being melodramatic”
“As much as I’d love to sleep... we have to clean up. ‘Less you want to wake up all sticky and uh…” John furrowed his brow trying to find a proper way to say it.
Dimmock opened his mouth once again but Sherlock interrupted him. “Now how do I know it wasn’t a suicide? There is a very small amount of pills spilling from the bottle. Not enough are missing for it to be an overdose. Now quit being useless, take samples of the poison in the mug and contact the wife. I’m sure she will make a whole show about not knowing the whereabouts of her husband but if questioned she will crack.”
He drew the cool and soft hands of his mother, lightly touching his forehead when she had thought he was sick so many mornings when he was younger and would do anything not to go to school to avoid his bullies. He drew her tightly pulled ponytail at the top of her head that always ended up messy as her hair was not long enough and strands of it would gently fall and frame her thin face. He drew her kind blue eyes that he longed to never see cry again after his father left them for another woman and another family. All of this he drew in a single portrait the day he moved out to pursue his dream in art school.
John giggled “Right. We should get going then”, he turned and their waiter
Sherlock hummed an answer, too focused on whatever was in front of him. But when John realised that instead of a plate or food in front of him, Sherlock had a bowl sized cauldrons, which he was currently stirring with his wand as it turned a pearly pink.
“Not that close I guess… he was just leaning towards it” John answered
“Don’t call me mate” John deadpanned, his hold on the bully strengthened for a moment before he let him go completely. “Get out. Don’t you ever touch Sherlock Holmes again”
“Of course, you don’t,” Sherlock muttered. Lestrade kept babbling on about the case. All incorrect information, Sherlock was sure, so he tuned him out, searching the crowd behind him for a golden blonde head of hair or a set of azure blue eyes.
John beamed back “I am. I can’t believe it either… it’s so impossible”
The snow had stopped rushing down and was now slowly drifting onto the ground. John looked at his and Sherlock's surroundings, dazedly. It was pretty magical. The walked slowly around the frozen lake, in comfortable silence. The snowflakes wafted lazily around them, clinging to Sherlock’s hair and John’s eyelashes. The castle looked so far away from here and the air was so quiet it seemed that just for this moment it was just him and Sherlock.
Later that morning breakfast (a single piece of toast with some jam spread on top) Sherlock headed to his study once again.
“Can I see?” John motioned towards Sherlock’s drawings.
Sherlock returned the smile, conscious of the students still in the room with them but not wanting to alienate John. The blonde wrapped an arm around his waist, seeming unbothered by the fact that the door wasn’t closed and Mike, Molly, and Janine were still in the process of packing up. It wasn’t like he was being invasively or inappropriately close to the artist, but it was still something that couldn’t quite pass off as platonic. Sherlock avoided his student’s eyes as they walked out, but he could still feel their gazes on them. Mike, thank god for that boy, closed the door and left them alone together.
The artist, eyes closing in the soothing warmth of his hands, just sighed “waiting for what?” he asked, voice small and feeling completely at ease, finally whole again now beneath the model’s caressing fingertips
” Sherlock whined, kicking his feet under the sleeping bag.
Ah great. Of course, bloody Anderson was now talking to John. Clearly, he had noticed the way his Sally had been staring at him and now wanted to make himself the center of her attention once more. Fantastic.
Sherlock repeated the procedure onto his other shoe and stood up carefully, branching out his arms to balance himself and waddled over to the icy ground of the lake.
Sherlock looked down at his feet, taking a shuddering breath. “John you…”
mentioned it a couple of weeks ago. Yeah….Good enough.
John bobbed his head a couple of times, humming at the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers in his hair and loving the sensation of Sherlock’s cock thicken against his caressing tongue and his balls tightening under his probing fingertips.
John gasped
“So... Nothing huh?” Greg scoffed, pushing John lightly on his broom.
New chapter <3! Hopefully, the new one will be ready in about a week-- i'm calculating Thursday
“Hmm?”
, flashing charming grins and looking at her intently with his deep midnight eyes.
Luckily Sherlock and Irene had not cast a Muffliato spell on them and if John leaned slightly forward he could hear quite clearly that they were having a heated argument in hissed whispers.
John insisted on holding his hand all the way as they walked to the restaurant, and didn’t let go even when the waitress took in their names for the reservation and showed them the way to their table. The artist quite liked how her gaze lingered on their joined hands and she looked up to smile at them sweetly. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile back.
We're getting so close though!!!!!!!!!!!!
The woman took off the black pointed hat, revealing her greying hair pulled tightly into a bun at the back of her head. She had stuck her hand into her pocket and carefully pulled out a large off-white envelope with a red wax stamp on the seal. “Good afternoon Mr Watson. My name is Minerva McGonagall and I need to speak to Miss Harriet Watson, your wife and yourself. I have very important news to give you”.
“Shut up and play” Sherlock cried, fighting off a grin.
John thought bitterly as he mounted his broom and adjusted his bit-too-long second-hand Quidditch robes to avoid tripping over them as he took off
Sherlock sat up carefully against the pillows, waiting for John to elaborate.
... that name sounded so familiar in John’s mind. Some memory was trying to break free but he couldn’t find its source. He frowned, trying to remember where he'd heard that name before. “Molly,” he whispered “Beauxbatons.. where’s that?
“Wait…” Sherlock’s eyes widened, trying to understand “Sarah didn’t give you her phone number?” he rushed out, not really meaning to say that but his mouth taking over Sherlock’s still frozen mind. Oh God no.
“Hi,” John smiled shyly “I’m uh- John.”
Sherlock’s frown disappeared and he looked over at John as if expecting him to scoff and decline but John’s smile had returned and as his eyes met Sherlock’s the smaller boy could see a sparkle of hope in the deep blue irises. Sherlock looked him up and down, forcing himself to observe more from John’s stance and appearance. Clearly, the mention of his parents, along with his already given deduction about John’ long hair when summed up to John’s small clothes that he had clearly outgrown a while ago strongly suggested that John was unhappy in his family life. He didn’t know why but even when he barely knew the boy in front of him the sudden need to protect him from whatever kept that big smile off his face was undeniable and strong.
“Hey mate! We saved you a seat. You were looking for us?” Greg asked.
“Smart is the new sexy,” she said slowly, drawing out every syllable and rolling it in her tongue
It happens out of the blue for John.
They looked at each other for a moment in silence, trying to figure out how to best pretend like nothing had happened.
“...I’d be alone again” finished Sherlock, glaring at Irene who only sighed dramatically and looked at him appraisingly.
John’s body relaxed, clearly taking in Sherlock’s indifference towards Dimmock and enticed by the idea of trying to figure out whatever Sherlock had clearly already observed but wanted to give John an opportunity to do so as well.
“Yeah! Absolutely!” John exclaimed, and Sherlock subtly breathed in in relief. “But only if you have breakfast tomorrow”, he added.
have an experiment. And he
An idea then popped into his mind, “Could I try?” he whispered into Sherlock’s mouth in between heated kisses. “Could I try to draw you?”
Sherlock nodded in silent approval of the chosen pose and pressed the timer for the half hour on his phone on.
Sherlock let out a trembling breath “I-I do too. I mean, I… me too”.
He wasn’t tall enough to read the ones on the top shelves but he satisfied himself with being confused by the ones in the bottom. As he looked up, however, he couldn’t help but notice that some of the books were moving on their own accord. Lifting themselves out of the shelves and into different positions between books or down and onto people's awaiting hands. John stared at them in amazement, wondering how in some months his sister might be able to do that, and how amazing it would be if she could somehow… teach him to do it himself.
Mummy gasped excitedly “OH! I heard him! Is that him? Can I speak to my son in law?”
And Sherlock.
of his student in the class had passed the course, a first for him, and most of them had actually managed to receive rather high grades. Eventually, they had to leave the students to mingle around, as Sherlock had to give out the usual interviews and pose for photographs.
was the cause of it. John smirked, licking a flat strip across the very same nipple and feeling Sherlock shudder beneath him, eyes closed. He caressed up and down the artist’s ribs with one hand and pinched the other nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He felt every crevice and curve of his sides and slowed, giving him a chance to answer, soothing him.
“This man was a serial adulterer who cheated on his wife repeatedly. She found out and thought murder was the best revenge. She paid the security guard to edit and change the tapes to show the second tape at a different time. The second tape, in fact, takes place only a couple of minutes after he arrives. The people in the distance having a conversation are the very same ones. The second tape is probably the man going out to collect his lover from the cab but it is just cut short as the man leaves the frame.”
“Thanks! How’s Kate?”
He walked into the kitchen, almost vibrating with anger. The sound of his footsteps didn’t even register in Sherirignford’s mind as he kept his hissing. Eliza was backed against the kitchen counters, eyes wide and afraid as her husband leant over her. Her breath was coming along in gasps and her fists were clenched as if fighting off the anger John could see in the back of her teary gaze. John kept staring at the scene before him, his vision going red, the blurry and suddenly-
They couldn’t even reach the second staircase towards the bedroom before Sherlock had John pinned to the wall mouthing desperately at his neck and his hand ripping out buttons.
Guys. Worst Christmas gift ever. I know. Im so sorry. This is why it took so long. I just. did. not. want. to. write. that. Gah.
John nodded “Absolutely.”
The tumult of information on “The magical world” was overwhelming. And Harry listened to every word as their strange visitor informed her of this world where she now belonged, and a mysterious school called.. what was it called? Hot-darts? Hogs-warts? Either was John barely understood a word spoken as he stared at the surreal scene before him on his living-room. He listened and he watched nonetheless, face scrunched up in concentration as he watched his sister smile grow wider and wider and his parents’ expression grow from confusion to surprise and finally set into neutral indifference. As they always managed to.
Something inside him was screaming at him for a subject. Someone or something he longed to draw but what? Or who? He had never come to know. So he kept drawing trying to find it.
“Alright...” John said uncertainly. Then.. are you.. okay?”
“Yeth, up to 5 meters large. They can eat people, too!” Sherlock grinned as if this was one of the most fascinating facts in the world and not the most horrifying thing John had ever heard.
The first summer John spent learning everything he could about the magical world and Sherlock spent it learning everything he didn’t know about the muggle world. It seemed like the first week was a series of incessant questions going from “What’s this?” to “Why do muggles/wizards use this?”, both of them tripping over each other to know more about their opposite worlds. Sherlock had taught him about Quidditch and even let him borrow one of his many brooms, not that they could even fly them as neither of them had had any signs that they were magic. But they pretended just fine. They threw the bludgers around and did their best to catch an old snitch Sherlock’s mother owned from when she played Quidditch in school.
John looked a little wary for a moment, clearly wanting the conversation about their misunderstanding to be in the past but not wanting to hurt Sherlock again.
John grinned, clearly not noticing Sherlock’s dilemma and lighting up at Sherlock’s question “It’s feeling great. Thanks so much for getting Angelo to bring my cane back, I forgot to thank you a couple of days ago last class”
He knew he was pushing his luck but he simply could help himself. So finally he moved his hand and pressed it lightly against John’s cheek, turning his head in the direction opposite to which his torso was turned, allowing a clear view of John’s gorgeous golden neck and sharp square jaw. He could feel the heat of the blonde’s face beneath his open palm and his own face answering with the same heat in his cheeks. His eyes slowly glanced down his body, catching sight of his abdominals, strong thighs and his soft cock lying between them, it didn’t help that he knew exactly what it’s weight and taste was like against his tongue.
He detached momentarily from Sherlock’s addictive mouth and kissed his sharp jaw and slowly down his neck, leaving a slight wet trail. Sherlock was moaning softly under his breath, craning his neck and letting his head fall back to give John better access. John wasn’t sure Sherlock was even aware that he was making any sound, but with every soft whimper, a warm jolt went down to John’s groin. His hands tentatively slid down to Sherlock’s sharp hips, hesitant.
Next chapter will be the LAST kidlock-- summer of age 11. And then teenlock will FINALLY BEGIN!
Sherlock’s step stuttered “Oh.. I’m-uh... I keep forgetting. Thorry” he looked up at John, grimacing as if expecting John to reproach him or be angry.
John smiled, remembering how Sherlock would say the very same thing. He felt a pang of pain with the reminder and his smile faded.
Sherlock stopped short, John almost running into him. “Mycroft.” He hissed “Why are you here?”
“Shall we…” John started
“You… don’t you think it's weird? You’re not weirded out by me?” Sherlock whispered in a rush, needing John to understand that nothing in his life had ever felt as natural to him as painting him. But not wanting him to feel uncomfortable about it.
John’s hand paused when Sherlock blurted out his question, surprised for a couple of seconds before he resumed. “Move in here? Really?” he sounded pleased.
Now that John was here he was convinced that this was both his very best and his very worst idea. He wasn’t sure how on earth he would react to seeing the man naked again after…after.
“You’re gay”.
This time, when they arrived at Sherlock’s place they weren’t laughing, but the same giddy feeling was spreading through John’s chest rapidly as he watched Sherlock unlock the door, carefully avoiding his eyes as his hand shook with a small hint of nerves. He didn’t think he would ever see Sherlock again. Let alone be invited onto a case with him. Even less be invited back to Sherlock’s apartment afterward.
“Fine. But you come back here for the game. I actually secretly hate these things. Nothing interesting EVER happens.” She sighed
“For Merlin’s sake, Sherlock stop acting like a kicked puppy! Just stop whining and do it” Irene spat at him.
By the afternoon John had stopped balancing on his ‘injured’ leg and was having a harder time concentrating on the poses. Sherlock could see that although John hadn’t yet asked for a chair, he would soon enough.
It took everything John had but pulled back momentarily, both of them instantly taking gasping breaths and panting as if they had run for miles. “Sher-“ John gasped out. “Have-“
The pose he was in currently required John to have perfect balance as he was leaning down and putting pressure on his knees and back. He was raising the sheet high above himself, one arm curved over his head and the other reaching for the sheet draped on his broad back. Sherlock could see the single bead of sweat that had formed on John’s tanned brow that was currently rolling onto his jaw and neck and had the sudden unexplainable urge to lick it off.
“I’ve deemed at least 10 potions undoable without magic in the last 2 minutes and I just cannot stand this… being
“Oh god. I’m sorry” John snickered, trying his best to go back to serious
and feeling happy warmth fluttering in his stomach as John’s hands stroked down his back and back up. “But that was in fact,
“Come on John!”. Suddenly John felt Sherlock’s fingers lacing onto his, easily slipping through the gaps between John’s fingers and curling. His hand was surprisingly warm and John felt the warmth dissipate within him. The Gryffindor swallowed and tightened his hold on Sherlock’s hand.
John reached as far as he could, trying his best not to move to far, not that he even could considering how tightly the artist was holding on to him. After a couple of failed attempts he finally got the drawer open and pulled out the lube and a condom wrapper. “Oh…Do you-“
YAY theyll flirt some more!
“Well, I must say it’s pretty much what I expected. 11 inches, dragon heartstring, dogwood.” Sherlock said, admiring his wand at the dinner table. He twirled it around his fingers a couple of time, feigning disinterest. But John could see the excitement and the joy shining in his eyes from the other side of the table, and when he caught Eliza’s smile he could tell she saw it too.
“How did you-? Nevermind. What do you mean it’s not her? I’ve seen you around her all the time lately”
John frowned “Seriously… what is it? Please tell me... you’ve been..” he searched for the right word “ quiet since the case, love” he let go of the artist’s hips, the latter missing the warmth almost instantaneously, but something hot and ugly burning from John’s words.
When the blonde came back from the call he seemed irritated, maybe even a little sad. The artist debated whether to ask or not, not wanting to shatter the illusion that John was not seeing anyone else but not wanting to seem like he did not care for him. The decision was made for him when the model put his phone away and walked back onto the platform without a word, a deep frown on his face. Something was wrong. Sherlock didn’t like not knowing. Even if the truth would break his heart it couldn’t be worse that not knowing what was happening, and if something about it was causing John grief then he didn’t know what else to do.
They never took it further, John soothingly stripping Sherlock of his shirt but nothing more. He had assured Sherlock that they didn’t have to do anything if he didn’t feel like it. The artist had tried to deny it, tried to kiss him harder to make him see that he could. That he’d do anything for John. That he wanted him. He would always want him. But the blonde had only slowed their kisses and held him tight. He’d guided him onto the bed and covered them both, whispering soothing words in Sherlock’s ear until they both fell asleep, tangled together.
“Oh…. Mummy then” John laughed, ears turning pink “Yes I’m taking very good care of him….. really?..... I’m sure he’s been very busy… I’ll make sure he visits you more often…. of course! He and I would
“You! My boy!”
“You boys, growin’ up so fast! Next thing I know you’ll be walking in here with a wand of your own.”
“Hi”.
Sherlock tried to stop the words from sputtering out but the potion was making him dizzy, the enchanting and wonderful smells kept drawing him in for another whiff. He couldn’t breathe clean air, couldn’t think straight. All he could think of was…
“It’s fine. He was a rubbish father. My mother is much better off without him.” Sherlock sounded neutral, as if he’d rehearsed those words several times in his own mind. He met John’s eyes again and smiled softly, almost sadly “My mother is a kind woman. Sometimes too kind for her own good.”
“Well... I have been.. uh…” He swallowed and looked away “I actually feel a lot better now John we should get going” Sherlock spluttered, quickly jumping to his feet and half-running towards the exit, not looking back or giving any sign of intending for the Gryffindor to catch up with him, something he usually did whenever he ran off to an experiment or case.
“I know! He’ll probably smell blood” She said loudly laughing
“Uhh…” John started.
John laughed “True. Nice reference, by the way. And you said you wouldn’t like muggle movies and they were a waste of time”. He laid down beside him, both of them staring at the ceiling.
“Simple really” Sherlock mumbled, a little overwhelmed. No one had ever responded positively to his deductions. Usually, the models muttered something confirming Sherlock’s observations and then proceeded to avoid his gaze and respond coldly to him for the rest of the day. And here John was on his very first day and Sherlock had just revealed pretty delicate information about him without a second thought and John was… praising him?
Sherlock bit his lip, remembering John pulling his lower lip in between his and sucking.
(See the end of the chapter for
She sniffed, wiping her eyes quickly and raising herself to her usual height. “So dear, are you boys hungry? I made lunch a while ago but I’m sure it’s still warm.”
But first he needed to feel John’s chest under his fingertips, he needed to bite his bottom lip and hear the low breathy moan that escaped the blonde’s lips, he needed John to hold him tightly and to bask in the soft sounds that their kissing resounded in when they reverberated in the empty room around them, he-
She shook her head slowly, unwilling. She gasped out a couple of breaths trying to compose herself. “Oh, Sherlock… my darling… I-”
Sighing he unlocked his phone. He needed an excuse, though… biting his lip he coursed through his contact list and finding the one he searched he clicked the call button. The rings and then a voice picked up
fault that Sherlock was so insecure about himself and it was
Sherlock sighed but definitely looked more cheerful, “If we must. But then we’ll at least try to recreate the drought of the living dead”
On Thursday morning Sherlock was taking attendance as fast as he could. Since this week the novelty of having a never before seen model had worn off there were quite a few absences but Sherlock paid no attention, for once his focus was not solely on the classroom but on its door. He awaited the moment that blonde man would walk through and completely capture his full attention. Even without being here he was already achieving it quite well.
Sherlock shrugged, “I very rarely eat breakfast back at Beauxbatons. But to answer your question, I’m just getting acquainted with Hogwart’s collection of books. Who knows how long I…” he stopped there, swallowing and looking away from John’s sympathetic gaze.
He sighed “I just wanted to know what Irene was up to. Nothing else”.
Now they were talking about Mary’s drawings. She was motioning towards her line work while John was nodding, clearly impressed but still uncomfortable with talking about his naked body with her. He nodded along to her words and started circling the room, quietly observing everyone’s drawing while Mary followed behind him, still talking about.. something (Sherlock couldn’t be bothered to listen) while John answered politely.
The cogs in Sherlock’s brained whirred to an absolute stop, John’s words unable to process with his own thoughts, the puzzle pieces not matching, some being discarded, others brought to light. John made reservations? Sarah… that name did sound familiar… Sarah was the police officer! The name and the face finally clicked in the artist’s brain. He recalled speaking to her before in some cases, one of them Angelo’s case. He’d forgotten about that. But what did this mean? What was John saying?
Eliza stayed behind speaking amicably with Angelo as Sherlock and John went out to explore some more for anything else they might need. They passed by the entrance to Nocturnal Alley, John having to hold Sherlock back by the end of his robes to hold him back from sprinting right into it. As much as John was curious, the wizards and witches lurking in the shadows of Nocturnal Alley weren’t people he really wanted to interact with just now.
“Sherlock”
“Take my hand” Sherlock whispered.
friend.
“John!” Sherlock called out softly. “Come here!”
Sherlock attached his lips to the edge blonde’s jaw, hiding his scarlet blush. “Me too John… Even with all the hours I’ve drawn you, the hours you’ve modelled for me... it’s not enough. I need more.”
John quirked his head bemusedly “Me? I’m a struggling ex-army doctor with a limp” he huffed a humourless laugh.
So far they’d kept their sexual activities to solely oral and manual, per say, but tonight felt different. For Sherlock, to finally have the confirmation that John was his, solely
Sherlock was breathless. He suddenly couldn’t remember who he was, let alone where and what he had been planning on telling John. He slowly and willingly drowned in the deep blue of John’s soft eyes and forgot to hide the surprise and affection from his own expression, suddenly shifting his eyes quickly from John’s eyes to his lips and back.
“SHERLOCK!”
“True… I still don’t know what to name him.”
Soon enough the students started coming in, carrying their massive sketchbooks and newspaper print paper inside their portfolios. Molly Hooper, as always, was the first one to enter the classroom, coffee in hand and a big smile on her face that contrasted completely with the fatigued looks on the rest of her classmates' sleep-deprived faces. He looked down at his attendance list and ticked the box for today’s class on the row of her name, smirking as she maintained her perfect attendance record while balancing being the most talented student from his class.
“Your father” she choked out. “Your father… has decided…” she sniffled, “He has decided that it is time for him to transfer to France. For… for us to…” she finally looked up to meet his eyes. “To move… away.”
He did end up critiquing some of the students’ work, but he found himself being kinder to them. Explaining their errors with more patience than usual. Even Anderson received a small nod for his effort. Clearly, he could concentrate much better now that Sally was absent from the class. If nurtured, he might even be an alright artist. Maybe.
He started off towards the back of the room, John closely behind him, trying hard to keep up with Sherlock’s massive steps
John’s eyes widened “No. No, I won't do that.”
Sherlock bit his lip, remembering John’s shirt riding up during one of their practices, remembering his pink tongue snaking out to wet his lips after Sherlock said something particularly clever… Sherlock’s breath halted and he looked away, blinking fast. What was going
“Oh yeah! Your childhood best friend! The one who never answered your letters when he moved away? He’s here?!” Molly’s eyes were wide and curious.
Sherlock didn’t answer at first, which made John sit upright and pull his friend’s almost limp body up. “Sherlock?” he asked, voice much more panicked now.
Sherlock swerved past Dimmock, the Beauxbatons chaser, as he caught a glimpse of something golden zoom past on the other side of the field.
“It’s perfect” he smiled up at Sherlock “Thank you”. He didn’t even bother to ask how Sherlock knew he didn’t take sugar. Of course, he knew.
Anyway... here's the new chapter :))
of you so horribly! Why… why do you stay?” tears had begun to flow down his cheeks too.
“Besides,” John continued, “I would love to see your childhood home! And your very first paintings and
Sherlock’s eyes were wide and nervous. “Okay.. okay.. the more we move the tighter it's gonna get”. He took the clippers with his other hand and did her best to cut them free, but the dark plant limb seemed to hiss and tightened around them.
“What’s his name?”
He didn’t remember not feeling like Sherlock wasn’t something absolutely necessary in his life. Even when they’d been apart… those long summers were never far from John’s mind.
Sherlock grinned. “Of course. Before that, however, could my companion Mr. Watson and I observe the body more closely? I would like to make sure I am making a fully informed observation.”
“Gladstone?” John whispered into the dark room. Almost instantaneously, John heard the clicking of an owl’s beak somewhere above him. He craned his neck upwards and spotted his white and gold barn owl perched on one of the wooden posts of his bed staring down at him with wide inquisitive eyes. John chuckled softly. “There you are”, he smiled. Gladstone flitted down onto John’s shoulder with a couple flaps of his wings. His claws dug gently onto John’s soft pyjama shirt. “Would you mind taking this down to Sherlock Gladstone? You know him. You met him the day I got you. He’s over at the Slytherin common room.”
But as he returned to the library there was Irene, approaching Sherlock in her usual flirty manner, hips swaying slowly as she strode gracefully towards him and took a seat next to him,
“Nicely? You basically shone a light in her eyes and threatened to sue or something!”
It all started one Sunday morning, surrounded by Eliza Holmes’s marvellous pancakes, omelettes and an array of breakfast biscuits laid on the table. Sherringford was to be out for most of the summer and Mycroft had taken up an internship at the ministry for the summer, so it was just the three of them.
John hadn’t been sure that taking divination had been a good subject choice but since Mary, a gorgeous blonde Beauxbaton, had come into the class and sat across from him he had been pleased with his decision.
“I-“ Sherlock breathed “I didn’t… want to assume. I thought perhaps I could convince you to stay with me but after they saw us and assumed we were together.. it was too much”
John stopped babbling and beamed “I would love to”
He let the other arm hang loose beside him in a casual pose as not to strain himself and have a natural pose for the blonde.
Sherlock’s face lit up, as it always did when John complimented him. “Ready?” he asked
It had been five days since John had seen Sherlock talking to Irene in a secluded corner in the library. Five days since he had most definitely not been trying to spy on them. He had left Sherlock alone at the table for only a couple of minutes, going to retrieve his potions paper from the dining hall where he had left it on the Gryffindor table as he had run off after his genius friend who was enthusiastically talking about an experiment in the forbidden forest a couple of hours before. Sherlock had offered to help with the homework (“John just give me the paper you suck at potions” “I do NOT”) and John had obviously reluctantly agreed... (“You really want to help?” “Yes, John. I offered did I not?” “THANK YOU. I’ll be right back just give me a minute”).
“Passed out? Why? Unicorn hair has no properties that could become poisonous to the human-”
Why hadn’t Sherlock told him? Did he think John would be judgmental? Sure… Irene was definitely not the top choice of trustworthy girls and Sherlock knew that so maybe he just thought John would disapprove… or maybe… maybe Sherlock had noticed John’s feelings for him before even John had. Molly had done it. So Sherlock had obviously noticed before. Probably years ago.
Sherlock smiled, unsure
A comfortable silence fell as they both sat on the couches across from each other in front of Sherlock’s fireplace. John sunk into the cushions, marveling at how natural it felt to just be sitting here with Sherlock. They’d only known each other for a couple of weeks and yet… everything just fit. Looking around himself again he suddenly noticed the violin perched up against the window. “You play the violin?” he asked, eyebrows rising.
“You” he sighed “You are the most beautiful creature. I could watch you for hours.”
Sherlock, on the other hand, had considered going into science and perhaps even becoming a detective on the long run. He had always been able to know when the police made grave mistakes in the news he often saw up on the telly. When he was younger he had often called and given them tips but after being shut down over and over again and not taken seriously he figured he should start looking for some other way to call their attention. He began drawing diagrams of the various crimes seen he had seen on-screen, utilizing the visual representations to explain how he had come to the many conclusions and deductions in who had committed the crimes and how.
“I still think I’m right. But come on, the Quidditch match starts in 5 minutes, and I’m doing the voiceover because last time Anderson did it SOMEBODY jinxed him” she looked at Sherlock with a raised eyebrow “and Ii’m sure you don’t want to miss the game anyway” she winked.
“Mhmm... Well, if he kissed you it was for a reason. People don’t just kiss other people out of nowhere. Perhaps he doesn’t think you like him back Sherl. You’re not very good with this kind of stuff”
Sherlock snorted and shrugged, turning back to his materials and finally swinging his bag onto his shoulder. “I’m as nice as they deserve me to be” he sniffed back.
Sherlock nudged him, fighting off a grin “Shut up”.
“Do you want to come into my studio?” Sherlock asked calmly, a reassuring smile covering his face and trying his best to mask how fast his heart was suddenly beating.
They were close. Much much closer than they recalled ever being.
John turned back to the creased parchment and reached for it with trembling fingers. He unfolded it carefully, suddenly having a vision of possible dismissive words or worse… his own letter sent back without a response. He found neither.
Anderson moved without a single word, but he was still glowering at Sherlock’s back. Sherlock positioned himself in front of the drawing and grabbed Anderson’s pencil and began sketching on top of it in beautiful singular lines that completely contrasted Anderson’s hatch work of scribbled contours.
“And what do you need me there for?” John asked, still puzzled. But Sherlock could see a glimmer of delight glinting behind his ocean blue eyes. There was no doubt that he was at least intrigued by the thought of sneaking in somewhere after hours when they were already supposed to be in their own dormitories... and every passing second would make it harder for them to sneak past Filch and Peeves. Not to mention, the later it was… the larger the punishment would be if they were caught. John looked like he’d just been
Granted he was only 7, but John expected nothing more of life than he did from a Sunday afternoon at home.
“…Alright.” John took a deep breath and opened the door. The bell above chimed and a voice resounded from the back of the store
“Outside the library. Now” he hissed as Irene stood gracefully. She grinned from ear to ear, and followed him out.
Sherlock couldn’t help the happy breathy giggle that rose from his lips, a happy bubble of warmth bursting in his stomach as John kissed the tip of his nose. Sherlock closed his eyes and let out a long sigh.
“So… you aren’t… what did you call it? Mugler born?” he asked.
Sherlock was too busy lost in the memory of their last kiss, right at the edge of the Gryffindor’s common room door (with the Fat lady softly snoring behind them), to notice John plop down beside him at the Great Hall table.
The light radiating from the windows was deepening into orange by the time they reached the elevator, Sherlock pressed the button for the fifth floor. He was starting to look a little nervous as if John would suddenly leave or say he changed his mind. The blonde just slipped his fingers into Sherlock’s, interlacing them and squeezing his hand tightly, reassuringly.
“Y-yes. That’s what I just said, John” he muttered softly. His voice still had a slight waver and faux confidence he hoped John wouldn’t detect.
“Glad you came” Sherlock answered, just as softly.
They walked back into the streets of Diagon Alley with pockets full of the candy Sherlock had pointed out Angelo. And before John could reach into his pockets Angelo had stopped him with a firm head shake. “On the house! Anything for The Holmes’s family and their friends”.
How to broach the subject, though? Maybe if he sent a less direct note first? ‘Ease into the subject’ as Molly had said. Of course, she had suggested a face-to-face confrontation. John pondered on that for about a couple of seconds. Nah. Why risk it?
John nodded, understanding completely. Though, knowing he wasn't the only one certainly made him feel a little better, safer. “I’m John, by the way” he smiled “What’s your name?”
Sherlock closed his sketchbook abruptly and turned toward the other side of the room. His eyes were instantly met by the woman’s eyes. She smirked at him. “Stop it,” he told her, turning away.
“Oh, Sherlock… how could I possibly forget you?” he whispered, brokenly. “I stopped writing because I thought you’d forgotten about
“Can I?” John breathed
The Beauxbatons made a mental note to revise his previous memories on John Watson and how on earth he had missed how smug and white his grin really was. And the effects of said grin on his own blood pooling in his cheeks needed to be reviewed immediately as well.
“we didn’t know what to do or who to talk to and when Greg demanded-“
Sherlock hummed in agreement, feeling himself sinking down into sleep. Before he could his warmth and the arms around him were suddenly gone, cold air in their place. He blinked sleepily, trying to figure out what had happened.
“Wh-? Nothing… why?” John said quickly, frowning but avoiding his friend's eyes as best he could.
They just stood perfectly still for a moment. Staring at each other. An almost perfect replica of the moment Sherlock had stumbled in and into John’s ocean blue gaze.
This was the issue with having someone that was more observant than the average person. Sherlock wondered if this is what people felt when he deduced them aloud. Sighing, Sherlock shook his head “He kissed me”
Sherlock didn’t smile back. He bit his lip as if unwilling to ask whatever was dying to escape his lips.
This time, John’s happy laugh was louder, shaking his chest and Sherlock by proxy. “Maybe I can convince you,” he said, his voice dropping.
“What are you thinking about winter break?” John said suddenly.
Sherlock huffed a laugh “Right. Well then. I hope you’re prepared to lose against me”.
A blur of red and golden robes zoomed in front of him, pushing him harshly out of the way as the Gryffindor boy tried to bat the bludger away from him, but the momentum of the push didn’t give him enough time and the bludger crashed into the Gryffindors’ side with a loud crunch.
Sherlock, without any kind of experience with relationships, had no pin pointer to what any of this meant for him and John. Did John... like him? Was he somewhat attracted to him but not enough to follow up on the kiss? Did he regret kissing Sherlock? Or did he simply stop because Sherlock was not kissing back and thus assumed, incorrectly of course, that Sherlock had no inclination to kiss him back at all? Sherlock shook his head. He couldn’t keep obsessing over this. It had been days and it was time to stop thinking about it. God knows he had already obsessed over it enough to have made 2 new paintings of John. One after Sherlock had played him the song on the violin. And the other one moments before he’d kissed him.
But what took his attention completely were the objects that seemed to be moving on their own accord as the books had been back at the store; the plates rinsing themselves in the kitchen, a dustpan lightly floating over the arm rest in the coiled marble staircase sweeping delicately, the chandelier candles lighting themselves up as they walked through the door and… were the portraits in the house moving?? John stared at one of Sherlock next to a red haired boy he supposed would be Mycroft and… yes. Sherlock seemed to be pouting and rolling his eyes in the picture as Mycroft tried as best as he could to look like he wasn’t noticing, a slight twitch of annoyance giving him away every now and then.
John stopped to listen, feeling suddenly trapped and unable to move. He wanted to leave… but curiosity took the better of him. It seemed like they were in the middle of an argument, Eliza’s voice came now and then but the prominent one was Sheringford, angrily whispering and hissing. He took a couple of steps forwards trying to make out whatever he was saying.
They’d made their way to the class and as fate had had it, John was to be sitting directly in front of the younger Holmes boy, who incidentally looked nothing like the elder Holmes, a chubby and big nosed 5th year that had the reputation of having the habit of stealing all the leftover cakes from the school’s kitchen.
They panted in unison for a couple of minutes, basking in the euphoria of being so close to each other, of finally breaking the unspoken barrier between them. Sherlock still had his long arms firmly wrapped around John’s warm body and did not feel even the slightest inkling of letting him go. John Watson. In his arms. In his bed. In his life.
Greg didn’t seem to mind the awkwardness and jumped in enthusiastically. “Pssht. He wishes. We just hang out with him so he gets a taste of what it’s like to be cool, eh Johnny?”
He was just getting to the tantalizing slope of Sherlock’s arse when there was a very loud clearing of a throat behind them. “Ehem!”
“We were eleven, Greg,” John said raising a sceptical brow.
At the end of the lesson, when the students had left, Sherlock was still sitting at his desk, whether exhausted by the lack of sleep or a rigorous class he didn’t know.
“I love you, John Watson” Sherlock said suddenly, his voice soft and truthful.
The laughter stopped as suddenly as it began as they stared at each other.
John smiled. “Anyway...what are you reading so thoroughly? I thought Beauxbatons would have similar books as Hogwarts”.
Mycroft had once warned him not to let sentiment get the best of him. And now here he was, lying in the arms of the man that did not feel the same for him, that would soon be holding another person close at night. Now here he was... lying enclosed and pressed against the chest of the gorgeous man he had somehow, against all odds, fallen completely in love with.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest but John just shook his head “Nope. Come on”. The dragged out the biggest mattress they could find, one they usually used for their pirate games and placed in below the tree house. John then surrounded it with as many falling leaves as he could, just in case Sherlock rolled off. They climbed to the highest point, Sherlock’s heart beating loudly against his ribs.
“Me too… oh god me too”. They kissed again, slow and unrushed as if they had all the time in the world to just hold each other and kiss.
With all his strength of will, the artist raised himself gently, sneaking under John’s arms and slipping through so he could sit up properly. John sniffled in displeasure and shifted but didn’t wake.
“So...” John started “You joined the class today” he looked at Sherlock from beneath his lashes.
John Watson was in mid swerve of his bat, hitting a Quaffle with remarkable aim and directly towards the Beauxbatons’ players, Sherlock recognized the surprise on Soo Lin’s face when she tried to bat it back only to have it swerve right past her head and into the center hoop, as he himself was certain he’d made the same expression the first couple of times he played against John. He also recognized the triumph and glee in the Gryffindor’s grin, the dip of his dimples and light shining through his blue irises.
“You’ve been here less than a week and you’ve already snuck into the restricted section?” John laughed loudly and was immediately shushed by some students nearby. “Why am I not surprised?” he said, much more quietly this time.
“It’s fine but” he chuckled “Your shirt is covered in green and blue paint ha hah” he tucked his head beside John’s neck, muffling his giggles and on a brave whim started peppering wet kisses on the golden skin.
John opened his mouth to respond… with something, but a voice interrupted him.
“Oh!” He quickly let go of Sherlock’s arse cheek, clearly noticing perhaps this wasn’t the most appropriate time to be doing that. Not that Sherlock particularly minded. “I’m… I’m sorry, Sherlock. I… I don’t-” he looked at Sherlock now.
Funny how for years Sherlock had turned on glaring lights onto his model’s bodies and had watched them glow under them but had never once pictured how they must feel. It was… oddly empowering. To be so blatantly vulnerable, the lights emphasizing and shedding light onto every inch of your body completely and willingly on display, trusting the person to see you entirely as you are.
Sherlock. At least he used to. But he knew Sherlock wasn’t the kind of person that was polite solely for appearance's sake. He was loud and some would even say rude when he didn’t care for someone. He wasn’t a fake.
“It’s not done yet. But in the next 10 minutes, it’ll be a fully functioning tranquillizer draught. Nothing to worry about, John. I’ve done this before. It is perfectly safe.”
“You like it?” Sherlock’s whisper resounded into the massive room, it sounded small and afraid.
She laughed merrily, impressed but not surprised, caressing his arm
Sherlock sighed dramatically, throwing his arms up in the air “Have you lot even looked at the evidence? The video clearly shows him getting into and out of the hotel and his hand is bare!” he pointed to the body “See? Wedding ring! Dirty wedding ring as Mr. Watson kindly pointed out for you. State of the marriage right there. Now look at the bed sheets- he checked in on the same day he left so why on earth would the bed be unmade if he hadn’t been accompanied? And don’t give me ‘he took a nap’- who on earth leaves the bed looking like that after a nap?”
The utter confusion in John’s face faded into surprised realization before melting into pained understanding. “Oh...” he gasped “Oh.. Sherlock.”
Mycroft had both eyebrows raised and was staring at Sherlock in part shock but…almost.. was that amusement? Delight?
“Me either,” said John, discreetly pressing his thigh against Sherlock’s. The Beauxbatons stiffened momentarily in surprise before pressing back shyly. He kept stirring his potion, absolutely not meeting John’s eye when he answered Molly. “I have no need to study for finals. Most teachers just take their information from the middle pages of each chapter, as memory experiments have suggested that the human brain retains the first and the last pieces of information given. Teachers tend to, therefore, pick things that we are most likely to forget in a feeble attempt to make their exams more difficult, and thus, be perceived as harder and more important subjects than they really are.”
He heard Sherlock’s name thrown in now and he leant closer. “He’s a freak Elizabeth! An incompetent freak! That is no boy of mine! If I had known that all you would give me is a useless
“Sheeerlock” The gentle tenor voice was slightly louder now, singsong and teasing.
John was standing. He clearly hadn’t moved since he’d stood up and had no doubt been watching as Sherlock maniacally shoved things in his bag.
He’d done all of John’s paintings from memory, and just a couple of quick drawings in class. But now he saw that having the man’s body, living and breathing right in front of him could simply not be compared. His mind could never draw justice to John’s beauty and strength. And the memory behind why John was in front of him now... Of why John was lying before him entirely nude in Sherlock’s bed. Tangled in Sherlock’s bed sheets.
“Sherlock? Aren’t you coming?” John asked, bemusedly.
“No! Don’t look at-“
And all of that that added to John’s lustful wanting gaze… Sherlock could not think of a place he would rather be in. He chose a simple pose, with his body angled slightly sideways for John’s perspective to be of his side and chest along with a small portion of his right arse cheek, he rose his right arm and bend it over his head to stretch the muscled along his ribs and give a clearer view of his neck he’d often caught John gawking at.
“It’s not… quite as nice as yours.” John shrugged, laughing nervously in clear self-consciousness. “But... it’s warm. And it’s close. And well... it’s home” he met the artist's eyes with a tiny nervous smile.
“Well he definitely looks more rested than last Tuesday” pointed out Mike
“WHAT?!” Sherlock finally snapped, but his voice cracked, still uncomprehending of this warmth that had bloomed inside of him at the touch of John. His mind, still revolving around this confusion and the tingling feeling on his scalp where his lips had touched. He begrudgingly turned to stare at his brother, trying to calm his expression and composure into one of pure annoyance and frustration.
“Th-thanks!” she said, quickly, still seeming shell shocked.
A comfortable sort of silence fell as they stop beside the bus. Sherlock, in truth, had no reason to walk down to the bus as his flat was the opposite way. But somehow he couldn’t bring himself to regret coming down here with John, someone who was finally interested in his deductions and cases.
“SHITE!” John hissed. Sherlock dropped the clippers and the strand of devil snare tightened around both of their wrists, tying them together. “What do we do now?” John yelped.
John stayed off the topic in his friend's presence though, having learned his lesson and not wanting to push Sherlock away. After all, if his friendship was all he was ever going to get he was going to make the best of it. Things always seemed to relax and return to normal whenever John asked about Sherlock's progress with experiments or if he asked him to deduce him the lives of the rest of the students in year 6. (Apparently, Sarah had quite a crush on Mike Stamford). But as soon as the rapid flow of information was squeezed out of Sherlock the tension between them would arise again.
“So I was thinking…”
“It’s against the law to apparate with children under the age of 16, John. I’m afraid… there’s nothing to do now” she said sadly.
He turned in the darkened Gryffindor bedroom and pulled back the curtains surrounding his four poster bed. “Nox” he whispered, and the tip of his wand stopped shedding its soft white glow. John looked around to see if he’d disturbed any of his sleeping friends around him. Luckily, Greg’s bed was the nearest to his own, and judging by his disturbingly loud snores he hadn’t been disturbed by John’s soft muttering or the scratch of his quill.
The questions finally subsided and he scampered off to his section of the gallery, a rather large one where he was pleased to see many people concentrating in, observing and admiring the many paintings of John.
Any day now his future could, too, be secured in Hogwarts.
Wait.
“Oh bollocks, sorry!” Greg let go of her and John took his place for his hug. Greg just joined and hugged them both. Molly laughed.
“For a reason. Now move”
“Hi” he whispered
Thank you so much for reading!! It means a lot to me that you guys are liking this fic and leaving such sweet comments<3! They really do encourage me to write faster <3<3
“Still! I don’t think we should be-“
“Right. So John. For this next experiment, I’ll need to jump off the highest point of the tree house.”
“You don’t think he…” John couldn’t finish the question. Evidently, Eliza knew exactly what he was referring to as she winced slightly. John immediately regretted his half-asked question, but he couldn’t help asking it. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for Sherlock but… what if he couldn’t help him? What if there was nothing to do?
The words flashed before his eyes and in those mere seconds where he tried to search for something… anything to say, he saw John fully. The little, lost boy he’d spotted so many years ago in Diagon Alley had grown completely into himself. He no longer looked lost and afraid. He held himself proudly. His round eleven-year-old face had transformed into a rugged boyish handsome sixteen-year-old. And his eyes… his eyes still held the same curiosity and innocence but were now tinted with charm and a trace of danger. Sherlock’s breath hitched. He felt a familiar warmth course through him, something he knew he’d felt before.
The loud sound made John jump backward and away as Sherlock pulled back with a surprised gasp, his head snapping towards the door in alarm and he yanked his arms back from where they’d been curled around the model’s neck, fingers in his golden hair.
Sherlock kept looking at him, watching emotion after emotion flash across his eyes. But now… it was almost as if there was some joy in there too….
“Did too!” John laughed. “You had the biggest lisp ever!”
?” he looked completely flabbergasted “Sherlock. We’ve literally spent the last 5 summers of our lives together. We know each other inside and out. I think it’s fine to say we’re more than just
He landed on the ground, expecting Sherlock to joke about how he cheated and didn’t swat it down, but when he turned to look at him grinning Sherlock was just staring at him, gaping. John looked around himself, not knowing what the younger boy was looking so shocked about.
What was also a fact, however, was that he had stopped kissing him and had immediately left. He had run away even before Sherlock could reciprocate. And he hadn’t contacted Sherlock since.
(See the end of the chapter for
On one memorable occasion, Sherlock had been in the middle of explaining a complex experiment to do with the different kinds of soil he had collected when John set one off too close. Sherlock in a panic had jumped onto John which had started him and set another one off. One of the locks on Sherlock’s hair had instantly caught on fire and doing the first thing he could think of John had pushed him onto the lake in panic.
got hurt instead of you?” John murmured, brow scrunched forlornly. He reached out a tentative head and laid it next to where Sherlock’s rested on the mattress.
For long moments the only sounds echoing through the large room were the scratches of the single piece of graphite and their breathing. Their gazes met often in the quiet, trusting.
“Pfff I knew this class was a fraud!” another blue robed student whispered back. They both snickered maliciously.
so.....
There it was again. That electric feeling that always seemed to shoot up Sherlock’s spine when his eyes met the model’s. John smiled tentatively, resembling the last almost-smile he gave Sherlock before he jumped in a cab without another word.
Sherlock tangled his fingers in his dark curls and pulled in frustration  “Because I can’t do it okay?  And you can’t do it either. You swore if I helped you retrieve your blackmail pictures-”
“Not so cocky now, are we?” Sherlock teased
“Yes! You’re John no?” Angelo’s voice boomed out happily as he continued to grin at John. “I am Angelo. Mr. Sherlock Holmes texted me, said you forgot this in his classroom!” he said raising one of his arms where clutched in his hand was John’s cane.
Sherlock gently pried John’s mouth open, the blonde’s lips feeling more and more familiar with every shared kiss. He sighed, feeling at peace whenever he was being kissed by John, the butterflies in his stomach making happy swoops and urging him to press himself even closer. He held on to John’s jaw, thumb slowly stroking the slight amount of scratchy stubble.
John didn’t look even slightly intimidated. He raised an eyebrow and looked behind his shoulder. “No. But if you touch another hair on his head I can smash your head in. Would you like that instead?” he took a step towards Anderson, his hand already clenching in preparation. Anderson stumbled back, clearly not used to being threatened back by anyone.
A rattling sound coming from the window startled Sherlock mid-sentence and he finally did choke on the piece of pancake he was currently half-chewing. John slapped him on the back, whilst rolling his eyes good-naturedly as Eliza stood up to open the window.
John laughed “Well…” he hesitated “I had a lot of fun” he smiled up at Sherlock, who beamed back. They were rather close to each other now, only about a foot apart. Neither was exactly sure of how that had happened.
Inhale. One two three four five six seven. Exhale. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven. Repeat.
I'll live up to the E rating soon I swear!
“Well,
He came back with a handkerchief, dampened from the sink on the far end of the room (used for the painting classes that took place in this classroom on Monday’s and Wednesday’s). He carefully cleaned them both up, Sherlock tucking himself back into his pants looking quite pleased. John snorted, enjoying feeling Sherlock’s eyes follow him all the way back to the changing screen to get back into his normal clothes. “Enjoying the view?” he called back
Was that… was that John? He blinked but the image was gone.
He pulled his brand new robe around himself, feeling cold and small. He looked down at his feet and kept on walking with the rest of the kids, crossing the massive hallway to the front of the great hall. He was so busy looking down that he didn’t notice the boy in front of him had stopped walking and walked right into him, almost toppling both of them over.
“I’m sorry John” she whispered
John smiled sweetly, the softest tiniest smile Sherlock had ever seen. He instantly wanted to sit down and paint John looking at him like that. John opened his mouth to say something, but something tugged at Sherlock’s heart again
The class ended, and as the students were leaving John walked up to Sherlock with a smile. “Hey, you” he murmured.
Sherlock walked into the room, instantly floundering deductions off of her, insulting everything everyone in the room had thought about the case and the things they’d obviously moved around the room and demanding to see the blood sample results.
“John?” Mary asked, brow furrowed in concern.
“Hmm,” Trevor hummed. “So... you painted all of these in the room correct?” he looked around, seeming mildly interested.
“John!” Eliza cried. She rushed to his side “I’m so sorry! You absolutely did not have to see that... I can't believe- I”
Sherlock just breathed a small ‘Oh’ sound and held tightly to John's hand as he led them through the cobbled street and there in the distance Sherlock saw it: ‘Madam Puddifoot’s tea shop’. It was a charming little place, decorated to the brink with flowers and plants that must have had some sort of anti-freeze charm, as they seemed like they belonged in the midst of a spring day rather than a chilly winter morning. The snow flakes slid right off the petals and onto the pebbled ground. Sherlock thought it looked absolutely charming.
“John, you are SO funny!” Mary laughed, batting her long eyelashes and brushing her hair behind her shoulder in an overly-exaggerated motion. John preened under the attention, huffing a laugh and brushing it off suavely as he was so used to nowadays.
himself and his sister being the magic exceptions in his family was very low. But he was happy to spend time with Sherlock, someone who unlike his sister didn’t act superior because they knew about the magical world. Sherlock had grown up with it and to him, it was second nature to explain how the world worked. “Someday” he would always say “I’m going to get that letter. And I’ll go to Hogwarts” (after 2 years they had finally learnt the proper name for the school and Sherlock had outgrown his lisp).
Sherlock stared down at his phone. He wasn’t sure what John’s signals meant at all. He wanted this woman… but he wanted Sherlock too? Maybe Sherlock could share... if it meant keeping him. But the thought of the blonde touching someone else, calling someone else ‘gorgeous’ or ‘love’ as he sometimes did him in the heat of the moment... it physically burnt to even consider. But what choice did he have? After all, moping around was not going to help him in any way. If there was even the slightest chance that he could convince John to stay, he was going to try.
“MUMMY!” Sherlock squawked, stopping his pacing abruptly and instantly regretting his choice to have this conversation in speakerphone,
John simply adored him.
Soon enough the urge was too strong and hesitantly, almost embarrassedly Sherlock reached up and thumbed his left nipple, feeling as it peaked under the pad of his thumb almost instantly. He closed his eyes again, giving in but trying his best to get it over with as fast as he could without thinking about anything in particular. Especially not the new model.
actually capable of predicting the future, but only in sporadic strokes of luck. He, however, had expected her to make the predictions she was KNOWN to make: prophecies of danger and unsightly death to scare her students and make her seem more impressive. This…
John beamed at him, his eyes still worried but trying not to pry. He took hold of Sherlock’s cold hand and laced their fingers together, pulling him back onto the street gently to call a cab to his home.
They had met during their second school year. John had, of course, seen Sherlock since their first year when he had been called for sorting. He had stepped up the stage and announced loudly he would be in Ravenclaw without even putting the hat on, to which McGonagall had started to protest but the hat had silenced her immediately by saying “He’s right”, a shrug apparent in his tone of voice.
The poses changed and the majority of breaks were forgotten. The energy in the classroom was tense as the students focused on John’s poses and the heavy silence in the room. It felt like an orchestra in crescendo up until the lunch bell rang, everyone blinking around and wondering where the morning had gone. Sherlock looked down at his drawing, seeming almost shocked that he had been drawing at all and not remembering a single second of it. At least not a second where he had taken his eyes off of the model.
John looked confused so Sherlock sighed “If their drawing is bad why should I lie to them and tell them otherwise. They’re here to learn are they not? How do I help them by patting them on the back if that is not what they need”
They headed back to “Olivander’s” still discussing game consoles and different kinds of games John played.  The fact that Sherlock was just as new to his world as John was here was oddly... comforting. As they walked into the store they suddenly heard a woman’s voice call out to them.
“What?” John momentarily looked even more confused but then he follows Sherlock’s gaze down to his legs and then to his hand, clutching nothing but thin air. He blinked in astonishment, realizing he hadn’t even thought about the pain in his leg, or his limp, or the lack of cane in the entire time Sherlock had been talking about his cases. His gaze snapped back up as he looked back into Sherlock’s eyes and grinned, almost maniacally. “You amazing madman!” he laughed “How did you even.. how did you know?”
Slowly, John’s eyes blinked open and they gazed at each together again, affection naked and open for each other to see. John beamed up at him, fondness pouring out of his deep blue eyes.
Sherlock caught Molly’s eye again. This time, she looked over at John and back at him and grinned giving one firm nod in approval, almost in pride. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he quickly looked away. He hadn’t been that obvious. had he? Better not think about it.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and bit his lip. It was now or never. John had to know how he felt. He simply had to. And if this was what was going to drive him away… better now.
John turned to look at him. Sherlock’s profile was a really stunning image, the straight nose and the clear almost transparent eyes in the beaming white light of the moon. “Thanks for bringing me” he replied, a sweet smile pulling at his lips.
Sherlock smiled “I understand. I have a dog”
“That’s ridiculous. I’ve never mispronounced anything ever in my life. Especially my s’s.”
“Did you finish your essay?” Sherlock said dubiously but smiling despite himself.
And suddenly those eyes met his, widening in shock and horror. His cheekbones bloomed a fiery red tone, giving him even more of a resemblance to the young boy John knew once. Neither made a move for a few moments. They just stared at each other in silence as Professor Septima spoke her gratitude and goodbye to Professor Trelawney before walking out of the door and closing it being her.
The clock on the wall chimed four times; the sound slicing through the tense silence in the darkness of the rooms. The only string of light came from the slightly ajar door at the end of the hallway, where the artist was hunched over his canvas and staring at it in complete stone-stillness.
“Oh. Hi, Molly. What’s up?” John sat up on the common room chair, the old springs on the cushions groaning under the movement. He’d been watching the fire flicker absentmindedly as he thought about Sherlock.
“This isn’t good” she whispered.
Eliza immediately hid her face in her hands, a soft sob escaping her throat.
“Yes” John grinned, looking relieved
Sherlock snorted at John’s awkwardness “Fine.” He allowed the blonde to rush to the bathroom for a couple of wet flannels and promptly wiped the mess on (and in) himself and John did the same before slumping back down onto the bed and pulling Sherlock close again, the latter resting his head against the model’s chest.
“I think it’s had enough ice, John. Ta very much,” Sherlock muttered.
And Sherlock
Sherlock bit his lip and broke the eye contact for a moment, looking down at his paper instead to ‘fix a line’.
He turned back and walked towards John who was still giggling softly, cheeks red and clearly embarrassed but otherwise seeming unbothered. “Oh god. Come on, you. Where were we?” he reached forward and started kissing lightly at Sherlock’s neck, hands firmly placed on the professor’s narrow hips and thumbs rubbing soothing circles.
That effectively stopped Sherlock’s rapid train of thought. John wanted him to follow? Where? What had just happened? He hated not knowing exactly what was going on. “Huh?” he asked, stupidly.
“An older brother. He’s absolutely horrid”
Sherlock hummed low in his throat, clearly losing interest in the conversation. John rolled his eyes good naturedly, trying to give all his focus to not moving and away from his leg. It helped a little bit. Not that he would tell Sherlock.
“That’s bollocks!” exclaimed Dimmock “How could you possibly know he was having affairs? That he didn’t overdose on pills?”
“OY!” John called out, walking rapidly towards them. “What the hell do you think you guys are doing?!”
“Muglerwhat?” John said, confused. That was definitely not what he had been expecting to hear.
“When you were hit… when you fell. I don’t know. I couldn’t... I was scared”
Sherlock’s brow rose at John’s suggestion, surprised “Really?”.
“You’re right.” John breathed “No time now”, and with one final loud smack of lips on Sherlock’s jaw he removed himself completely from Sherlock’s back and walked away, turning to see the artist’s gob smacked expression with a giggle “We’ll finish this later. And you can have your revenge for this then” he winked. “For now though,” he extended a hand, which Sherlock stepped forward to reach for, “lets get ourselves changed, and hop into a cab.”
But then something… something happened.
All the will in the world wouldn't have stopped John even if he wanted it to. He grabbed Sherlock’s blue striped tie in an impulse and pulled him closer, not caring if the whole student body and staff saw them.
Over the years he had sent many letters with his drawing and depictions of the crimes but he never received any sort of thanks or even acknowledgment that they were taking his thoughts into consideration. Surprisingly, the thought was not as discouraging or heartbreaking as it would have been years before when he was desperate for the police’s attention. He then came to realize that the reason he was not going out of his mind in boredom was because he had discovered the way to let out his overwhelming amount of thoughts... through drawing. And as the years passed and his drawing became more concise and perfected the police started acknowledging him. They even began sending him case files and he started receiving phone calls from them asking for help.
“But- the gallery?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, he knew he had to ask now. He knew he had to. It was one thing for him to incorrectly presume they were together; it was another thing for other people to make the same mistake in front of John. Sooner or later John would have to correct them. Sherlock kept his arms to himself, selfishly enjoying these last few seconds before John noticed he wasn’t responding. His breath hitched slightly as the blonde licked over his pulse point but he resisted the low groan he would’ve let out.
The urge to reach out for John, to feel the warmth of his skin was overwhelming. But surely John didn’t feel like this too… not that way Sherlock did.
his… but not now. Not when Sherlock was so unsure of what was going on between them.
He said the only thing he could think of. “But Sherlock... Hogwarts. Can’t you… apparate or something with him? I can’t.. not without…”
Sherlock walked into his classroom with little energy. Although he was not a stranger to lack of sleep, he had to admit that sleeping sporadically over a period of more than 3 weeks was definitely not helping him concentrate. He rose the coffee he was clutching in one hand to his lips and sighed in pleasure as the hot liquid warmed his insides and spurred some new energy into his body. Bless Mrs.Hudson for always making him a cup of coffee to-go every single morning without fail. That woman was a saint.
Sherlock’s body collided gently with John’s own and their chests pressed together as John buried his head in Sherlock’s neck, rubbing soothing circles on his back as he felt the taller boy relax against him and slowly reach for him back and wrap his arms around John’s neck. “John… I- I”
“Oh. Yeah… That was… really something.” Sherlock murmured, he looked down at his feet, avoiding John’s gaze.
Soon enough, after moments of helpless moans and soothing hands and shuddering shivers, John was pushing a second finger gradually inside of Sherlock.
John’s father had stared at her for a moment “Um, hello? How can I help you?”
“EUGH!” he spat out the jelly bean into the ground spluttering and shaking his head fervently. “What WAS that?” he exclaimed, peering at the back of the jelly bean box in the darkness.
Sherlock slammed his hands against the table loudly. “Enough! What’s going on?” he shouted. His face had turned angry, something had finally snapped. John saw the pain in his clenched hands, his anxiousness. But enough was enough. It couldn’t go unspoken anymore. Whatever it was they had to know. They had to.
“Well... I’m staying... so maybe I thought we could-”
“What’cha thinking about John?”, asked Greg, flying up to John and hovering close as they watched the rest of their teammates fool around whilst batting bludgers and at each other.
Sherlock couldn’t stop staring.
“Mmmm” John huffed a laugh “I love
“I can't just
John looked up from his own globe, shrugging, “No”. He blamed the flash of wild dark curls he might’ve seen on the lack of sleep. Or maybe the dreams that he’d had. All full of Sherlock.
“Mmmphh”
Sherlock paused, putting the golden stained brush back into his solution of turpenoid and picking up a clean one. He observed his painting for a moment and closed his eyes, trying to recall the exact picture he was trying to replicate in as perfect detail as he could.
“Sherringford!” Eliza cried. “Let go of him!”
“Excellent! Simply marvelous!” Slughorn exclaimed  “Mr. Holmes come to the front of the class to demonstrate if you please” He motioned towards him.
John’s expression became confused. “Why did I what?”
John grasped the back of Sherlock’s hair with one hand, teasingly pulling at the sensitive roots as his other hand travelled around Sherlock’s waist and rubbed soothing circles, inching down slowly. Their chests were pressed tightly together and their lips waking wet sounds into the surrounding space.
“I’ve never done- ngh- any of this before” Sherlock gasped out, somehow even in the heat of this moment knowing exactly what John would say. He was looking at John through his heavily hooded eyes, lips parted and kiss-red.
