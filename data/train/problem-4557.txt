) and Dean reaches out to stop Cas. The angel stalls up and looks at him and even that, just Cas’s eyes on his with his head canting to the side is something Dean didn’t think he would get to have again.
“How are you not hungover?” Sam asks, glaring as Dean whistles happily and deftly flips an egg.
Dean nods and then swallows and then shakes his head. He takes a step closer, brackets his other hand at Cas’s other elbow. “Thank you,” he says softly.
“Hey, you used to love bubbles,” Dean says brightly, shoving a little at Sam’s shoulder. And, because Sam’s a little brother, he shoved back. Dean just leans into it. “Bubbles, and fireworks, and sidewalk chalk.”
There’s a world shot through with grayscale and Cas has a soldier’s set to his shoulders and hair that’s so neat it almost looks messy again. He’s standing in some barren wasteland and his eyes are to the sky. He’s staring and staring and staring and Dean can remember his Cas staring at a motel’s ceiling, cursing his deadbeat dad.
“When?” Dean asks and this isn’t fair. It’s not fair, Jack just beat God, they should be celebrating, they should be drinking, Dean should be kissing Cas like he’s wanted to for the past year, past five years, past ten... They should have been kissing for so long...
“So. It’s just her teeth?”
Sam gave him one of those two-second-too-long stares that meant he had no clue what Dean was talking about and was trying to gauge whether or not it was appropriate to make a joke about it. Before Dean could backtrack, Sam apparently decided on
so my original plan was to have next chapter be the last & for it to be the goobs post-quarantine. but then i was thinking instead i could bump up to 4 total chapters, with the next one featuring some cute How to Flirt When You're Quarantined Apart? let me know in comments if you have a preference!
“I swear to God, man, if you start talking about my nose, or my eyelashes again…”
Instead, he just fits his brother with a glare and mumbles, “We’re not dating.”
Dean nodded but dropped to crouch down, smiling and letting Miracle lick his face. “Hear that, sweetheart? No surgery for you.” Miracle had propped her two front paws onto Dean’s legs and continued her thorough cleaning of his face.
Before he can stop himself, Dean is saying, “You do. I mean, this does.” It’s one of the sappier things he’s said but he can’t find any space to regret it. Especially not since it’s true.
Dean’s shoulders catch at that, but he still doesn’t respond. “So we have to swing by Cas’s place to leave it on the porch."
“Yeah, it’s basically a rite of passage,” Claire says. And, no it isn't, but now Dean has their creepy-stares and Cas’s guileless, pleading smile on him. If only Sam would back him up on what a bad idea this is, but Sam is just moving to put his mug in the sink.
Dean doesn’t know where he wants it to spread its leaves, this...them.
“Besides,” Amanda said, “Dr. Meyer doesn’t think that she’s ever had puppies and, at her age, that means she’s probably already been spayed.”
Dean smiles across and holds his hand out in the space between them. Cas doesn’t hesitate, he slides his hand into Dean’s and it’s a shudder-start, to be touching someone after so long of uncertainty and fear and boundaries. It’s an electric pulse to be touching Cas after so long of wanting it.
A laugh comes over the line. “Yes, I heard you. But you sound less...worn down than you did this morning.”
“What the fuck, man?”
The next minute Lauren ushers them to the empty exam room and we all lean past the counter to watch them go. Lauren is looking over her shoulder, mouthing, “Oh my god?!” to us and Miracle seems ecstatic, bouncing between the two men and yipping gleefully. But we’re all more or less focused on Cas’s hand, coming up to rest easily on the small of Dean’s back. Dean sways into Cas’s space like it’s where he was meant to be and then the door closes behind them.
Dean paces off toward the bathroom and Sam shakes his head, realizes that they’ve wasted a good ten minutes with this. “Sorry about that,” Sam says, offering a sheepish grin across to Cas.
“I don’t wanna bring your morning down,” Dean says. “Just...accidentally tuned into some press conference and got angry at all the…” He can feel it, again, the strange anger. Something in it feels wrong, close to ego, close to selfishness, and it cuts Dean’s voice off in his chest.
It’s not easy to convince Dean to leave Miracle there for the x-rays and eventual surgery but Sam is able to coax him away, explaining that there’s nothing more they can do. He’s not able to stop Dean from making Jessica swear she’ll call him if anything happens, anything. She swears, and promises to call him later that night and the next morning too, just to update him.
“Yeah. Yeah, it’s been...fucking-- And then you turn on the television and shit and they’re calling us heroes and all and I mean, like, I appreciate that people...appreciate it, or whatever. I can appreciate the applause breaks and the donated coffee all that shit, that’s great. But when I hear that fucking guy from his podium like. He doesn’t get to call me a hero. Not when he has the power, had the power…” Dean stops and shakes his head. Politics really aren’t his thing. He’s always had his moral stance but beyond that, he doesn’t engage beyond his civil duty.
Dean shakes his head. He stands, dirt sifting through his hands as he goes.
“You said --”
When he put a hand to Dean’s cheek and told him not to worry, that it was okay, that he was ready and Dean would be fine, it would all be fine and then he was flickering away and there was nothing but the cool emptiness of the space where he had been. Nothing but a gaping void that loomed and buzzed through Dean’s chest.
“I hear ya, buddy,” Dean says, concealing his laugh not quite as well as he might hope. They're probably four or five rounds in and if they hadn't been pacing themselves, if there hadn't been the orders of fries in between, he's not sure that either of them would be conscious. As it is, they're just...very drunk. Which, Dean has been very drunk before. He's been more than very drunk, he can handle himself. Which means that Cas can just let loose and experience the new sensation. Dean's enjoying watching that.
Dean trails into the bathroom after him and, with stuttering fingers, cleans out the ragged cut along Cas’s palm. He rustles for the first aid kit and dresses the gash with all the care he would give a critical gunshot wound. He talks as he works, ambling on about Crowley and Kevin and Sam. Nothing substantial, just idle stories and tossed out insults. The whole time Cas is silent. He doesn’t even flinch when Dean pokes a little too hard or pulls the bandage a little too tightly. Dean doesn’t realize he’s finished until he’s already been holding Cas’s hand in his for a few seconds, not doing anything else.
Sam makes fun of him one evening, maybe a month into things, because of the face he apparently makes when a text from Cas comes in. Dean throws a pillow at his brother but even he can tell that he’s smiling wide.
. The cold of emptiness, cold like Dean has never felt before and his body’s instincts tell him to pull away from it but he can’t. He won’t.
“Hey, if you guys are gonna end up having Skype sex, just let me know in advance so I can order some noise-canceling headphones.”
They rock together, an ebb and flow, and Dean fits his forehead to Cas’s. His eyes are open. “I…” Dean works his throat, struggles against the rising crest of pleasure. “I don’t want you to be in pain. I don’t want you suffering.” He’s thinking of that angel, the certainty in his voice when he told Cas he would take the pain away.
Sam turns to find a tousled, sleepy-looking Dean peering blearily at his computer screen. Raising an eyebrow, Sam gestures, “No… This is my coworker, Castiel.”
Dean lifts his head a little more and he’s looking down at Cas through his lashes now, he’s looking at Cas’s lips. “Okay. Quick revision to the plan. I’m going...to kiss you now. And then the water, et cetera. And then, in the morning, when we’re sober, we kiss again.”
It’s to Mary’s credit that she just says “Of course!” instead of
Cas doesn’t answer. He closes his eyes, tightens his grip, and kisses Dean again.
“Breathing is strange,” Cas says softly, his mouth still close to Dean’s.
Dean laughs at that and Sam smiles, still sitting up in bed. His grin is fond and amused and maybe it's the whiskey but Dean thinks how this is nice, being surrounded by his family.
Cas nods and Dean ignores the smirks and overly-cheerful “Good night!”s howled from Claire, Jack, and Sam. They trail out of the Dean Cave and into the network of halls and it’s deja vu all over again, the other night when he and Cas were leaning against each other to get across the parking lot.
“Instead, why don’t you just try and donate money to some good, reputable wildlife conservation funds,” Cas suggests drily. Which, he would. The guy works for a non-profit, of course he goes for the practical suggestion.
Sam laughs again and nods. When he pulls his hand away, his eyes are red but clear. “Anyway. Thanks. And… You really think she’ll be okay?”
“Good night, Dean. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”
“Shut up,” Dean demands.
“What?” he asks, playing at irritable.
He opens his eyes and smiles at Dean. Reaching, he laces their fingers together and cocks his head. “Hello, Dean,” he says, like he’s said a hundred, a thousand, times before and Dean can’t breathe. A cloud moves and the sun is brighter. Dean can feel it on his bare skin, he can see the shadows it makes over Cas’s cheeks. “I love you,” Cas says quietly. Dean’s never seen him so easy, so calm, so...at peace.
Dean manages not to completely freeze up, but it’s near thing. “Hi,” he says, very dumbly. His eyes are set on the man in front of him. It’s a face he’s become more than familiar with, across Facetime calls, peeking in the corner of pictures of Claire, from the rare, self-conscious selfie that he’s sent as well. But to see him in person, barely two feet away… The only thing Dean can think, brilliantly, is that he
“What are you, the fun police?” Claire cuts in. Once more, Jack giggles and Dean adds more bullet points under the “Negative” column of this sudden partnership.
Dean had nodded at that, swallowing and peering down at his dog for a long moment.
Dean laughs. He lifts a hand toward Cas’s temple but then catches himself, stops. Cas finds himself disappointed – the pressure of Dean's palm would have soothed the steady, deep ache in his head, he thinks. Or, maybe, he just wants Dean to touch him.
Jessica smiles and nods, confident again. “Absolutely. I’ve seen this more than a few times. Dr. Meyer’ll do an x-ray to confirm, a quick surgery to yank the yucky tooth, and Miracle will be back to her old self.
“Dean,” he stutters out and something in Dean would have expected his voice to shift, as a human, but it hasn’t. It’s that same deep, rough rasp and he’s helpless to do anything but lick it out of Cas’s mouth. “Please,” he mumbled between them.
And Cas is looking at him all sincere and sweet and Dean can’t think of much beyond the press of Cas’s body against his as he helped him across the parking lot, the press of Cas’s body against his as they shared the motel bed, the press of Cas’s body against his as they sat together in the diner the next morning.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he can think better of it, Cas’s number is ringing through.
They’re kissing and it’s different -- or maybe it isn’t, maybe it’s just different in the way that every time before was different as well. Cas’s hips track down along his and Dean exhales smooth and slow through his nose. His hands trace the cotton of Cas’s shirt before reaching for the hem, passing it over his shoulders and head.
Standing in the threshold of a motel room in Rexford, Idaho, the feeling comes back to Dean. Stronger now, so much stronger it turns his stomach. Cas is standing at the foot of the bed, all bad posture and gazing into the cut on his palm like he could divine something from his blood.
Before Sam can say anything, the tinny sound of Castiel laughing over their connections cuts through. “It is, yes. He enthralls Claire, luckily.”
It isn’t until Sam finds him, on his knees, and is asking what happened that Dean realizes he’s sobbing. He clutches hard at his brother’s shoulders and buries his face and cries in a way he hadn’t been able to in those lost moments, or when Jack waved and set off, or when Jody and Claire visited with condolences. Sam runs a hand through his hair and sighs like he’s been waiting for this. He lets Dean rock into the cradle of his arms and gasp out, “Fuck,” and “Goddamnit” and “It’s Cas, it’s him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s the horrible world taken over by Croatoans. There’s a pink-cheeked, dazed Cas sprawled over a dilapidated armchair in a cabin with a beaded curtain. His hair is dirty and a mess and when that terrible version of Dean from 2014 stalks forward, he fists his hand in the hair. Cas grins with all his teeth and tips his chin to meet Dean’s eyes. Dean says something, close and soft and heated. Cas’s face changes, warms, melts, and his eyes go to half-mast. Dean leans forward into him.
“Hey,” he lilts and thank god he’s working on two hours of sleep in as many days because  it makes his voice rough and firm instead of the uncertain waver he expected. “Lemme take a look at that.” He walks forward, hands out, but stops when Cas tucks the hand into his chest, like an animal protecting itself.
Cas smiles and laughs through his tears and says, “You changed me, Dean.”
They’re in Pennsylvania when they camp out, right in the middle of the state. Jack is enraptured by the whole of the experience -- likely because it includes fishing. He chatters happily, explaining to Cas that Dean took him fishing once. Cas smiles and says that he had been fishing with Dean a few times as well. When Dean passes him a questioning look, Cas explains ruefully, “Well. You were dreaming at the time.”
Before he knows what’s happening, cold air rushes to fill the space that was once Cas. Dean sees just the edges of the Empty’s tendrils, black and shimmering and all-consuming. He turns on the balls of his feet just in time to watch the rift against the wall close up.
“Right,” Mary says, eyes sliding over to the new addition. “I’ll just need his information…”
They meet in the middle, Dean holding Cas at his waist and the collar of his trench coat and kissing him like he needs it to breath. He can feel the shudder-shock of Cas’s breath in the kiss, shaky inhale to clipped exhale. There are tears on Cas’s cheeks pressing into his own and Dean, stupidly, thinks, I’ve never seen him cry. He’s seen Cas’s blue eyes go glassy and red, but he doesn’t think he’s ever seen them spill over.
Dean is smiling, the flicker of the candle playing tricks with the shadows of his lashes over his cheeks. “Out in the woods all day, it was bound to happen. I got eaten alive too. Nothing to worry about, Cas.”
But Dean rushes to cut him off. “I love you,” he says and he can feel his cheeks getting hot, his throat thickening. “Okay? Cas. I love you. And I need you here. Cas, please.”
“Strange,” Cas answers.
Cas is at the kitchen table when Dean accepts the Facetime request, Claire in his lap. The girl has a dab of what appears to be peanut butter on her cheek.
“Hey,” he says, voice muffled by trench coat. They’re working on PDA, on holding hands. Cas likes it, he’s said so, quietly, into the pocket of Dean’s sternum when it’s just the two of them awake at night. Dean likes it too which is something that he hasn’t really admitted since he was a kid, that he likes touch, likes being held. Dean goes to link their hands together but Cas has something else in mind.
Cas cants closer but it’s only to bump their foreheads together. “Tomorrow morning,” he trails. “After we kiss again?”
Cas tilts his chin a little and his eyes are so blue in the twilight. “We can go to Yosemite?” he asks.
Dean, finally, catches on to what is happening and the arousal drains out of him as quickly as it had hit. He clenches his jaw and steadies one hand to Castiel’s shoulder, moves him closer to the dresser, where one of the candles is sitting.
“Well, regardless,” Jessica cuts in, not looking up from her data entry. “I think Matthew would have a better chance with him than you.”
“Right,” Sam agrees.
“I...need a shower,” he grits out. And he shoves away from Cas and pushes into the bathroom, closing the door with inordinate care.
Dean lets it go on for only a few seconds longer before pulling away. “Fuck,” he swears.
“Samuel! What a brother you have there!” Rowena exclaims.
When he turns, the camera is, indeed, spitting out a photograph. He rolls his eyes, mostly for show, and jokes, “Least you got my good side.”
It’s happening and there’s no stopping it.
Something about the nickname, the familiarity of it, makes Castiel realize his state of undress. Snatching his robe up, he only gets as far as twisting it in his hands. “I wasn’t worried,” he insists.
Dean putters around for a few more minutes -- makes Cas drink a glass of water and then refills it to set on the side-table. Waits until he's sure Cas isn't going to puke again and then coaxes him into taking a few aspirin. Then they're all in bed, Dean laid out next to Cas and holding very still, and the lights are off.
“We didn’t,” Cas offers and Dean shoves him away because it’s been eight years and he knows when Cas is being an asshole. The confirmation come in a bright laugh from Cas and Dean marks another tally of things he thought he would never get to have again.
Cas smiles back and for a moment it’s just that, them smiling at one another. “No, I’m sorry. She did ask about whether you might be a pirate, though.”
Much better than coffee.
Dean didn’t tell Sam, word for word, what Cas said but Sam has always known that his brother operates from love. He was the kid, after all, who Dean raised. Dean wiped his tears and kissed his skinned knees and proofread his essays and taught him about cars and girls and drinking and their father. Sam is alive and the person he is today because of Dean’s love.
“I wanted to bring her right away,” Dean says and he shoots a dark look to Sam, “but he said to wait and see what happened.”
Dean leaves it at that and they continue their shuffle across the pavement. He counts his every breath, trying to pass the distance without paying any attention to Cas's warm, pliant body tucked so close to him.  They're nearly there when Cas stops completely.
Cas’s eyes are on his and the pupils are blown in the dark. There’s a flush high over his cheeks and along the bridge of his nose and all Dean can think about is how adorable he’s going to look tomorrow morning, hungover to Hell with his hair in a million directions and the collar of his tee shirt all soft and rumpled.
Dean has his eyes just tilting to Cas, so he doesn’t miss the smile when it comes. Watching Cas smile is still something close to religious ecstasy, Dean thinks. He can still remember, memory caught in amber, sitting on a park bench in October and thinking it odd that an angel smiled, that he made an angel smile.
“No, I broke up with him, last time.”
Dean lets that one fly by without so much as a swat. “So he’s a private guy, then?”
So it’s tragic and terrible and it hurts. He hurts for his brother and Jack, he hurts for Cas and Eileen and Donna and everyone else, but he’s also, suddenly, alive with the gift that Chuck and the Empty have given them.
“I know, Dean. Thank you. For all you’ve done, for all our time together.” His voice goes liquid, distorted and Dean convulses, holds on tighter. He can feel it, along Cas’s back and shoulders, something pitch sticky and
“Winchester!" Castiel barks. "Are they the same?!”
Well.
Cas swallows. He looks at the nose in question - again, he didn't lie. It was crooked, it was endearing, Castiel liked it. He looks at his own nose, vision blurring and eyes crossing. Dean doesn’t smell like bed sheets and stale sweat, is the thing. He doesn't smell like Cas smelled when he woke up. He didn't smell that way when Cas woke up, nose deep in the pocket of his collar. Dean smells like the body wash and shampoo they share. He smells like… Like he rose well before Cas, showered, changed his shirt, and then returned to bed.
And he doesn’t miss the way Cas repeats the name, too quietly for his mic to pick up, “Dean.”
His emergency contact was Sam Carter, his brother, and Mary said he had made a joke about the other man when she guessed that Miracle was some type of collie/sheepdog mutt: “Sammy’s part sheepdog so you’ll fit right in,” he had said, clearly talking directly to Miracle and not Mary.
“We were just thinking that we wanted to have a drink with our...surrogate father figures.” Claire loops her arm through Jack’s and they’re still smiling and it is, frankly, pants-shittingly terrifying.
. And even if it is the same thing as the victims, that’s useful, he tells himself. That’s evidence.
The trip itself was Dean’s idea. The balance restored, no God or Darkness, all doors to Earth and humans closed off meant their jobs were finished, in a way they never had been before. He won’t admit it, but it’s a way to find where he wants to settle. The bunker was great for the purpose it served but they don’t need a batcave anymore. They need a home.
Good to know.
“It’s the Empty,” Sam rushes to explain. “We know how it works. We know what it wants. We know exactly where Cas is and how to get there.”
“Bhagavan Antle,” Cas says, tone loaded with displeasure.
“Cas is gone,” Dean gasps out. “He’s gone, he’s really gone.” And he pitches forward, shaking. His fingers bite into Sam’s shoulders so hard he’s sure there will be bruises and all Sam can do is cradle his brother to his chest.
Dean screws his face up a little and shakes his head. “Hope you set her straight on that.”
And let it be known that all ten years of Dean’s repression and guilt and self-loathing were broken, more or less, in one night thanks to the efforts of one kid who didn’t even have good cinematic taste, one half-kid, half-angel who still thought spreading nutella and pretzel sticks on a slice of bread was “lunch,” and the traitor formerly known as Dean’s brother Sam.
It’s definitely worth it when they’re eating dinner (stir fry and mashed potatoes and ravioli, because they’re going through left-overs and freezer food before hitting the store again) and every few minutes, Dean peers at his phone, grins, and taps out a response.
It takes a minute, but Dean gets his feet under him, tumbles both of them back onto the bed in a better position - Cas against the pillows and Dean crouched over him. They kiss, slow and metered, and Dean lets that set the pace. So they finish undressing each other slow and with plenty of touch. Dean catalogues the juts of Cas’s hipbones, the well of his collarbone, the angle of his thighs. Cas is happy just to rest his hands over Dean’s shoulders, to hold him there, feel him there. And when Dean’s exploration brings him to the hot line of Cas’s cock, that grip on his shoulders go white-knuckled.
Cas takes the next glass that Claire fills and examines the whiskey in it. “I believe, in Philadelphia exclusively, it’s known as a ‘citywide’.”
There's something ratcheting high in his chest, but Dean's smile is easy. He puts a hand to Cas's shoulder. “Thanks, Cas. I like your face too.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean reaches up and this time doesn’t stop his hand. It nudges against Cas's chin, brushing against the scruff there.
Dean feels the bottom of his stomach open up, feels all the swell of emotion rising again. He’s not sure that he’ll be able to do it, to leave Cas, to drive away without him. His breath stutters.
There’s a long moment of tense quiet before Dean murmurs out, “I just can’t lose her.”
Sam laughs at that for longer than Dean thinks is warranted. Instead of any annoyance, though, he just feels that same comfortable, familiar warm spread through his chest.
“Dude,” Sam says, his tone entirely different now, face open in sympathy. “I’m sorry. Can I…” He rocks on his heels, uncertain. “Do you wanna watch Pitch Perfect?” he asks with a helpless little smile.
Dean blinks, a little like coming awake, and then shoots his brother a look. “What?” he asks, defensive already. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
out.”
Castiel winces into a smile and ducks out of frame. A moment later, he reappears holding a toddler with wild blonde curls and the biggest blue eyes Sam had ever seen. A roll of “aw”s spirals through the mics, Sam’s included.
Dean nods, thumb moving along the sturdy line of Cas’s jaw. “Yeah, okay,” he manages. “Cas. I-”
Mary Catherine gave us all the biggest eyes when she told us about the look on Dean’s face when he gave the name. “First time I saw him smile,” she said solemnly, like she was recounting prophecy about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
“Indeed,” Cas comments. He shifts and that’s enough to stir Claire. She looks up at her father and whines again, then passes a look to the computer. Her eyes snap open wider and she gives a subdued little giggle. Pointing to the screen, she puffs her cheeks out wide -- just as Dean had that morning.
But Cas’s eyes are filling, bright and darker blue than they’ve ever been before so Dean reaches out for him. His hand falls on Cas’s neck, the tender skin between jaw and shoulder. His fingers are shaking. His hands are shaking, his whole body is shaking.
Cas pulls back from what he now knows is Dean's chest and blinks against the hated sun. "Hello, Dean," he says - his voice is harsh and his throat aches at the very back when he speaks. But Dean is smiling down at him, soft green eyes and open face.  Cas drops himself onto his back, into the half of the bed he abandoned last night so there's some space between them.
“Dean,” he says and the tone is pure warning.
Dean is quiet, considering that. He does feel better, now, a little lighter. “Well, I mean. I hate this show because of, like, what it is but it’s also...comforting? Not the content, really just like…” He sighs a little and laughs at the end of it. “It’s so fucking bizarre, right? So outlandish. For that hour or whatever, I almost completely forget that, like, there’s a real world. It feels totally separate to what’s happening, the job, all that.”
Dean laughs, appreciates the effort. Pitch Perfect is his go-to, feel-good pick-me-up movie, though he doesn’t often admit it outloud. “No, that’s okay.”
Faintly, Dean realizes that the wordless shout of rage, of despair, came from him. Some part of him is still lunging forward, stopped only by Sam holding him. He fights, blindly, only registering Cas, Cas’s body, Cas falling to his knees and then collapsing back and then the searing flash of grace released. Cas was so diminished that it only lasts a second.
The rest of us sit up at attention at that, uncertain. “Do you mean…?”
“I’m glad it can be an escape for you,” Cas says. His voice is low and close and warm and Dean faintly aches to be near him, next to him.
Cas cocks his head and then frowns down at the camera in his hand. “I do not think Ansel Adams used a Polaroid instant camera.”
“Did you boys have fun?” Sam teases. He slides across the bed, though, and the two of them get Cas's boots off for him.
“Oh yeah? So it really is just him and Claire? That’s gotta be tough.”
Jack returns from his stay at Jody’s with Claire in tow. The two have become thick as thieves in a way that Dean isn’t sure is an entirely positive force for the universe. That becomes directly apparent when, after Cas shares his drunken experience on the hunt, Claire’s eyes light up and she turns to Jack. They whisper together for a minute and then both turn to Cas in unison. Jack’s eyes aren’t the exact same shade as Cas and Claire’s but it’s close enough to give Dean horror flashbacks to
Dean is halfway to spitting out a “fuck you” when Chuck reaches out. And Dean thinks,
Cas waits a moment and then, once it’s clear that Dean isn’t going to say more, asks. “What got you angry?”
. Sam redirects him as firmly as he can manage.
Cas eyes brighten and he lets out a dreamy sigh. “Coffee.” He can brave the cursed sun if it means coffee.
Dean didn’t know what he was going to say. Dean didn’t know if he had the strength in him to say anything. “Cas!”
Dean kept pushing it down. Further and further. Until Cas said what summoned the Empty and Dean was left on the floor of the dungeon with an empty room and a ringing phone he didn’t have the nerve to answer.
Dean just stared at where Cas’s body once was at the top of the stairs. It’s almost like he didn’t blink.
“Repress-?” Dean blinked at his brother. Dean thought about it, then decided to go with a different approach. “I’m not going after him.”
“I-” Dean shook his head. “When you leave, my life gets worse. When you’re with me, my life gets better. I know we’ve both done some shitty things, and I know that I can’t be forgiven for some of them. With Chuck gone, and you back- I think we can have a good start, with our own free will.”
“But I want to. Say something, I mean.” Dean squeezed Cas’s wrist. “Just like I want you to stay.”
Dean shook his head. He was ready to deny this til the cows came home. He didn’t want anyone knowing it. No one- not even- “I don’t love him.”
Dean is still trying to believe everything Cas said, and it’s hard on most days to remember that he isn’t the ultimate killer. That he’s someone that Cas can love.
And Dean loves Cas too. That’s another thing he keeps close to the chest.
“I- I think it’s time for me to go.”
“I don’t have anything I can do for you, Dean.” Cas mumbled into his neck. Dean could feel his lips ghost themselves on the skin of his neck. “I don’t have any of my angelic powers and-”
Suddenly Sam was in his view, standing in front of him. Dean looked around, back in his body and in his surroundings. He was standing up- when had he stood up from his chair? Sam just looked at Dean, like Dean was supposed to be getting something but wasn’t.
Claire shook her head at him. “He was doing what he thought you wanted. He was practically begging for a reason to stay.” Claire stood up too, coming to Dean and lightly placing her hand on his arm right above his elbow. “I know my dad, Dean.”
Cas is back (Thank Jack) but they couldn’t bring him back as an angel. Cas was human again after a few years of having his mojo back, and would most likely stay human for the rest of his life. That didn’t matter so much as Cas was
“You are.” Claire says, piping up from Dean’s chair in the library. She had been sitting somewhat peacefully on her phone, but now her phone is tucked between her leg and the leather of the chair. “Sam’s right.”
Cas stopped and turned around, head first, then the rest of his body. Dean jogged a little bit to lessen the distance between them, but he could also feel the gravel slip out from under him a little bit so he could move too fast.
Claire- who opposed the chick-flick moments as much as Dean did- was telling him to go. He’s been ignoring Sam and what he sees in Dean for years, and Jody’s a big romantic at heart, but Claire- a girl he and Castiel helped raise into the young woman she is now. Dean took a deep breath and nodded.
“Go?” Dean asked, sitting up straighter in his chair. “What do you mean ‘go’?”
Eileen looked up at him from Sam’s right and signed as she spoke. “It’s true.”
Cas’s eyes darkened a little bit, then he shook his head. “Dean, I meant what I said. The happiness is in the saying- and I don’t want you to-”
and dug in along with them. And Cas- Cas ate at his sandwich slowly and carefully- like he was still getting accustomed to eating as a need again and the taste of food rather than molecules.
. Look, it’s just--” Dean makes a noise of frustration and sets his shoulder back. “It doesn’t mean anything. He mentioned he was running low and it’s harder for him to do shopping and shit with a toddler in tow.”
Dean smiles broadly at that, easily remembering all the times Sam’s imagination ran wild. “And did you find any?”
It’s in a room of mostly mid-tone wood and there’s sunlight coming in from a window, casting lines across the bed.
“Wait!” Jack says, and then he reaches for the bottle of whiskey and all the warmth Dean started to feel toward the twosome fades. “Wait, I have a toast I wanna make. We have to go again.”
Sam is pretty sure he didn’t even know Cas was a single father until they had been working together for, like, five months and now he knows the kid’s pre-nap routine.
Cas’s voice cracks and so does Dean’s chest. His lungs cave in and through a sob he tells Cas, “Of course, buddy. Of course. I won’t leave you. I’ll stay.”
Tonight, there’s something on Dean’s mind. Sam can tell by the way he keeps picking at the label of his beer, the way he drifts in and out of paying attention to the line-up of Gourmet Makes videos they have queued up (Dean threatens once a week to quit his job and apply for the BA Test Kitchen and Sam would roll his eyes if he didn’t think they would definitely hire his brother).
“I got a flashlight. We won’t go far.” Dean smiles and he can feel the curve of it against Cas’s top lip. “It’s a full moon. I hear the stars are really bright out here.”
Dean whines, drags out the syllables on a “No” so that the full scope of his petulance is heard. When he blinks open his eyes, intent on giving Cas an unimpressed glare, he finds Cas smiling down at him, extending a hand.
It must have been more than just seconds, though, because when Dean comes back to his sight, Jack is on the ground too, his head on Cas’s chest. All curled up on the corpse of his father.
And then Castiel is reaching behind himself, running his fingers repeatedly over one small patch of skin. “Are they the same?” he asks, words edged through his teeth.
“Right!” Dean snaps his fingers. “She’s part otterhound, and part Catalan sheepdog, with some bearded collie thrown in there too.” At that, he looks down at Miracle and gives her a pat on the side. “Aren’t you, beautiful girl? Isn’t that right?”
The water in their kitchen sink runs (handwashing before “hello”s in this new normal) and a minute later Dean comes into frame, all dark blue uniform and quizzical look on his face. His hair is mussed -- too long, and sent every which way from the straps of his PPE. That isn’t the only mark of the gear. Like always, Sam has to swallow back a cringe at the red, irritated skin along Dean’s forehead, nose and cheeks. The line along his forehead looks angrier than usual and Sam thinks it might have broken the skin finally.
Cas reaches out and his hand cups just over Dean’s shoulder. Something in Dean bursts, a memory, the pit, blinding brilliance. Castiel cradling him close through the bone and the blood and the fire and the smoke, raising him. He whimpers out something close to Cas’s name but Cas just shushes him. “It won’t be long,” he says into the cradle of Dean’s ear, “but I’d appreciate it if you would hold me until then.”
“It’s getting dark.”
“C’mon, Sam,” he says. He shrugs one arm up, wiping at the raw-red of his eyes. He worries his bottom lip with his tongue and then, more to himself than anyone else, murmurs, “We got work to do.”
“I know it’s been...exceptionally hard on you,” Cas says.
Dean gets caught between pretending to have been engrossed in the attempt to make Peeps on screen and pretending not to know what Sam is talking about before eventually giving up both. He laughs and nods. “She’s a cute little thing. Good taste in PBS programming.”
“Are you gonna go or just stand here staring at each other?” Jody’s playful comment wakes them up a little and Dean can feel his cheeks heating up but Cas has a patch of pink over his as well so at least they’re in this together.
Monday morning, she breaks the news to the rest of us with the empathy of someone who has already married the love of her life. “He’s in mourning. His brother said he lost someone and it was pretty clear that it was someone he’s in love with. Obviously he’s not handling it well.”
The dog barks and tugs on her leash, eager to get to a friend. Lauren ends up on her knees in front of the dog, petting her and receiving lots of kisses for her trouble. “Hi, baby! Hi, sweet baby! It’s so good to see you!” And when Lauren looks up to greet Dean she finds...not Dean. Her almost-comical shocked reaction is still plastered on her face when the door opens again and Dean finally does appear.
Then he feels cold.
“Come back with me,” he says into the thick air between them.
There’s a park and there are children running happily. There’s sun, so much sun, and there’s Jack and Sam laughing as they chase some toddler and there’s Cas looking at Dean, who’s watching the mismatched game of tag. And there’s Dean, looking back and finding Cas’s eyes and smiling. Dean reaches back and his hand is open and waiting, for Cas. All for Cas.
that he meets Dean’s eyes (glowing in the dim), and nods.
It seems Dean has forgotten that conversation, a decade gone. “So," he says, still smiling. "My nose is crooked, huh?”
Sam swallows past the familiar, brotherly worry and brings up an annoying smile. “Makes you glad you got me as a quarantine buddy, huh?”
Cas looks up at him then, finally, and his brow is furrowed, bottom lip pulled in a little and he shakes his head like Dean couldn’t possibly understand, like he’s explaining poetry to fish. “It never counts.” He wanders into the bathroom, as if on a whim, and sits on the toilet seat.
“I mean get him back.”
"We'll be fine!" Dean insists, hustling the former-angel out of the door.
“I imagine it would be a little weird, meeting the person you’ve been dating for over a month for the first time,” Sam says, not even looking up from his screen. Dean knows he’s texting Eileen, his ex from college, the one he reconnected with in all this and who likely wouldn’t be an “ex” for very much longer. And Dean would tease him about that except, well: pot, kettle.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says, and it’s so sincere you’d think Dean just swore fealty to the guy instead of just agreed to make a hangover breakfast.
Sam waits and, once it’s clear his brother isn’t going to go any further, adds, “Yeah. Cas is a good guy too.”
He’s sliding his hands down the arch of his back, hoping to stretch out some of the car ride when he feels it. The hammer of his heart rate ramps up and Castiel wills himself to be calm, to be rational. Even if these are the same marks on the victim, it doesn’t mean anything. The marks could be environmental, or anything. They could be
“Because it is.” Cas voice shakes and shatters and he leans into Dean’s touch. He presses one hand, palm bloody, to Dean’s shoulder and cups it there. “I love you,” he says, and it’s sure and strong. They’re called love confessions but this feels more like an absolution, like a benediction.
“Because after almost three months of being cooped up with my mother, even your sorry ass is better company.” Her eyes are bright and affectionate, though, when she grins up at him.
They’re just outside the door to Dean’s bedroom when he whirls Cas around, gets his back pinned against the wall and stands so their chests are pressed together, their noses brushing.
He doesn’t think about the bee until after they bunk up somewhere in Wyoming on the way back to the bunker. It’s an idle thought that enters his mind as he’s trying to sleep, wondering about the hibernation thing again. With sudden clarity so sharp it hurts, he thinks that Cas would have known. Cas would have known whether bees hibernate, what kind of bee that one was, why it might’ve been freezing its stinger off in Montana in January.
Dean laughs, shoulders loose, and messes up Sam’s hair. “I’ll let you all get back to work. Gonna catch a couple hours of sleep.” Sam nods and Dean shoots a salute and a smile off to the webcam before disappearing into the apartment.
People in town know him as a widower with some kind of tragic past and that’s fine - it keeps people from asking too many questions. But they know him: Pam at the library and Stella at the county municipal building and Rob at the diner and Frank at the hardware store. They know him, they know the friendly giant that is his brother and Eileen and little Joanna (who happily tells anyone who will listen that she’s going to be a big sister soon) and their dog, Sender. They quickly get accustomed to the mutt who becomes his shadow (Dean names the thing Bunker as a joke but then it kind of sticks and Sam still laughs at the fact that he has a dog called Bunk).
Before long it’s after midnight and Dean recognizes a strange pause in Cas’s story about his brother as him covering up a yawn. With a fond smile held close to his chest, Dean insists, “All right. I think it’s bedtime. You gotta be up at real-people times tomorrow.”
“But the first thing I noticed,” Amanda sighs into her cosmopolitan, “is that she wouldn’t leave Dean’s side. It was so adorable.”
“Three!” comes the delighted, triumphant answer, complete with three fingers held up and a toothy grin. Another round of cooing comes through.
Dean releases him, shifts down a little. When he closes his mouth over the head of his cock, Cas’s eyes shut on the barest groan. His head tips back and Dean tracks the glow of the arch of his throat in the dim lighting.
“Dude. It’s okay if it
"Do you think," Cas starts, turning toward Dean. His sentence trails when their eyes meet, when he becomes aware, too, of how close their faces are. The point of his nose is brushing the well of Dean's cheek. Dean has spent more minutes than he'd like to admit considering the point of Cas's nose.
okay! this one took awhile because i just...kept adding things. i'm not terribly pleased with it but it felt like it needed to be put out into the world.
“Got a busy day?” Dean asks before he can hang up.
He completely balked at her attention though and wouldn’t really make eye contact. When he spoke, it was in an undertone sort of mumble. Turned out be a lucky thing that Mary Catherine was on intake that day - her patience and sweetness could handle whatever was going on with the new client.
Sam does roll his eyes at his brother, then, gives him a shove. “All right. She’s a little young for you, don’t you think?”
Cas nods and Dean figures that means that he has to use the bathroom so he trails out to let him. He means to change in the brief privacy, tug out of his jacket and shirts and jeans and pull on one of the softer, worn tees. He gets as far as shuffling out of the jacket and over-shirt when the thought that Cas probably doesn’t have any pajamas with him catches at his mind. Should he pull out an extra pair for him?
Thinking about it, his next exhale comes out shaky. Cas, of course, notices. His reaction isn’t to question what Dean is thinking or feeling. He just lifts his hand from where it rested over the curve of Dean’s neck and holds it in front of Dean’s mouth. “Do that again, please.”
“Right,” Cas says, clearing his throat. He kisses a distracted Claire on the top of the head, reminds her to be good for her Aunt Jody and then looks back to Dean.
“Uh, listen if you gotta puke the bathroom is pretty close, okay? You think you can make it a little farther?”
Cas’s hand is still on his shoulder, tight, painting a print of blood there, like the mark Dean wore when he first crawled out of his own grave. Dean already knows that he’ll either burn this jacket, or hang it, never-washed, in the back of his closet. Maybe he’ll take it out, every now and then, press his face to the lapels in the hope of chasing some scent, some presence, the way he slept with the trench coat under his pillow after Cas disappeared under the water.
They say their goodbyes and hang up and when Dean flicks his light off, he finds himself drowsy and relaxed. Before passing out, he opens his text conversation with Cas and taps out a quick “Hey man, thanks.”
Cas is certainly blushing and so is Dean and when they meet eyes they both laugh, sheepish, at themselves, and then they step outside.
The Empty will comes, It will takes, and Dean wants to be mad. He wants to rage at Castiel for this deal, for hiding it, for not fighting. He wants to throw chairs and punch the concrete of the bunker until all his knuckles are broken, he wants to have a tantrum, like a child, like someone else will come and fix it for them, but -
“Beer and a bump!” Sam exclaims and there’s a smile on his face that makes him look all of twenty-two again and, okay, yeah. That doesn’t suck. “Man, that takes me back…” He stretches out in the armchair, shot glass in one hand and beer in the other.
“Looks like Bob Ross worked, huh?” And Sam’s loud, obnoxious, big, big brother has his voice pitched soft, so as not to disturb the drowsy little girl.
“I need you to take me to work. I have to open the store.”
“All right,” Dean says. He stands, but slowly, so he doesn’t cast Cas off balance. “I think that’s a night for me.” Clearing his throat, Dean meets Cas’s eyes, and then helps him to his feet. “Let’s get you to bed, buddy.”
“Cas,” Dean chokes out. He thinks it’s the blur of his tears or maybe the onset of a concussion, but the edges of Cas go black, like shadows thickening, solidifying. Roiling along Cas’s shoulders and hands and hips.
“I’m amenable,” Cas says and he’s smiling that huge smile, the one that Dean has only really started seeing in the last year or so, since he went full mortal.
Dean would counter that the drinks which got Cas drunk in the first place were supposed to be the celebration, but Sam is already ducking out of the kitchen and yelling that he’ll queue up some good movies.
Dean shakes his head. “You know how this works. We deal with it, like we always have. We’ll find him. I’m not worried about that.” Cas still looks forlorn, eyes down as he passed one hand over the other. Dean brings his hands down, over the canvas of the trench coat sleeves, and cups Cas’s hands in his own. “Cas, man…” He closes his eyes. “Before. At the cemetery. You said-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s thumb is caught up against the shoulder seam of Cas’s coat, under the flap of the collar. He’s letting it run side-to-side and you could probably call it a caress, if you were writing that kind of story.
. Sure, Dean had noticed in a sort of detached way that Castiel was attractive when they first met. But this was something quite different. This was forearms and shoulders and the plane of his stomach and thighs.
Without missing a beat, she ushered him over to a pair of chairs across the lobby. They sat, and she fawned over the long-haired mutt of a thing that Dean brought in with him. Eventually, she pieced together that he had found the dog seemingly abandoned and wanted to make sure that no one was looking for him, “missing him,” he had said. He explained that he was so friendly and well-behaved, he assumed that he already belonged to someone.
So they round up again and Cas is smiling blindingly as he watches Jack hold up his glass and toast to his sister, Claire, so Dean can begrudgingly let them get away with it. But then Claire wants to toast to her brother and very suddenly Dean’s fear of being duped by a four year old in a twenty year old’s body and Hunter Barbie Deluxe Edition are coming true.
Cas sits up enough that his weight is fully held on his knees, spread wide to straddle Dean, and he wrestles the Dean’s shirt up and over his head. And then they’re kissing again, deep and full, and Cas slowly bows his body down, settles himself into the pocket of Dean’s chest and Dean’s arms come up and around.
“Please. Castiel.”
“I’ll bet that’s especially useful when you gotta keep her occupied in quarantine,” Sam says, mentally shuddering at the thought of having a two-year old running around with no help and still having to get work done.
“This feels weird, man,” Dean comments and, for the fifth time, paces from the kitchen back to the living room. There, Sam is sitting, engrossed in his phone, and Jo is helping herself to their beer and thumbing through their Netflix.
When Cas stands upright, he looks marginally better than before. Eyes a little clearer and mouth not so slack. He only leans against Dean some as they head for their motel room. “You’re a champ, man,” Dean tells him with only half-affected pride, shouldering the door open.
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Dude. Tiger King. Yes, absolutely.”
Dean is too tired to be bashful. He has his face tucked into Cas’s neck, an arm over his chest, a leg just starting to crane over one of Cas’s. Cas has one hand softly petting through Dean’s hair and that...doesn’t suck.
They swoop high around Sam too, but they’re definitely coming for Dean. It gets to where he can start to tell the difference: this one’s a bumblebee, this one’s a wasp, this one’s a honeybee, this one’s a carpenter bee. It doesn’t matter where they are or what the season is -- there’s an iridescent one that flickers close to his scarf for a whole day and when Sam looks it up he says it’s some kind of bee that’s supposed to only exist in South America.
Cas makes a soft, pleased noise across the line. “When all this is over,
Mostly, though, the hunts are thinning out. There are less and less news reports that catch on their feelers and more than enough other hunters to clear out the cobwebs.
“Okay,” Dean says after a sigh. “Okay, we’re a little bit dating.” Sam and Jo laugh and high-five each other without looking. Dean glares again. “Why are you even here, Joanna Beth?”
After stopping in on Sioux Falls to see Jody and Donna and the girls (pictures of Kaia and Claire with heads close and cheeks together, of Patience and Jack, blurry, doing something called a TikTok dance, of Cas with his hands looped easily between his knees and his head tilting up, listening as Claire talks. His eyes are so blue Dean thinks it might be a trick of the print), they head east and a little South. They trek through small towns and big cities. Dean lets Sam drive more often then he usually would because he finds out that sitting in the back seat, with Cas against one side of him and Jack against the other is pretty okay, actually.
Shaking, he gets to the lube again and gets his fingers coated and then into Cas. Most of the times before it had been Dean open on Castiel’s fingers, (except for that first time, after the failed excursion to the brothel in Maine, and then the time in Cicero, in the garage) but now, now, with Castiel spread and twitching beneath him.
“My pockets were filled with stones and wildflowers by the end of it, so I’d say so.”
Dean huffs an amused sound, almost a laugh, and slings his arm up, over Cas’s shoulders. “Pretty nice, huh?” he says, lifting his chin to indicate the spread of the horizon, the mountains, the trees. Or maybe just the whole of the night, the road-trip. The empty road with no destination before them. The two of them standing in an empty field to the side of Route 19.
“Don’t forget all the water and medicine,” Cas says. The door closes softly behind them.
Jo chimes in, “Dude. You’re a little bit dating.”
Dean laughs and hoists Cas a little higher. Which proves to be a mistake because it makes the hand on his waist drop a little lower and now it’s cupped around the bell of his hip. “Yeah, I think you got that right.”
“Absolutely not,” Dean says. Next to him, Sam is laughing into his tea and pretending not to be.
Mary Catherine is at the desk at eleven o’clock that Tuesday, when it’s time for Dean and Miracle’s appointment. The door opens and Miracle comes in happily, tongue hanging out of her mouth, but the man attached to her leash is not Dean.
“Daddy, can we?” Claire asks, twisting to check with her father.
Cas shakes his head and closes his eyes. “No, I mean - Dean.” Suddenly he looks up. “You’ve broken many bones, haven’t you?”
And he and Cas… Yeah, he guesses that’s what he and Cas are doing, too. Making a go of it, with this thing that has been growing steadily for years, has only just come to blossom.
Dean hasn’t touched him when he’s human and he doesn’t know what would happen.
Cas is still looking at him, and even without the angel in him it still feels like he’s looking
“Is it too tight or something? Can you move all your fingers?” He looks down to find Cas doing just that, pulling his fingers into his palm, making a loose fist, unfolding them again.
Cas tells him that it is a goodbye and Dean shakes his head, hard. “No,” he counters, “No. This isn’t happening.” And he puts himself in Cas’s space, curves his hand around the back of his neck. He holds him there and meets his eyes, like he had with Jack, just a few months ago. “You’re family, Cas. We don’t give up on family, even if looks like there’s nothing left.”
“I’m glad for that, at least,” Cas says, warm and close. “You should sleep, Dean.”
The door to the apartment slams, signalling that Dean is home from his overnight shift -- perfect timing. “Hey, Dean, come here a minute,” Sam calls behind him and then, to the computer, announces, “I’m here with my brother, who’s an EMT. He’s just back from an overnight shift.”
“I know,” Dean rushes to interrupt. “I know what I said but I was wrong. I was - It doesn’t matter. We’ll figure something out. We always do, right?” Eyes still set on Cas’s, Dean laces a hand up and fits his fingers through Cas’s. “I’ll beg, man, if that’s what you want. This isn’t -- I want you there. Please.”
Dean didn’t know the East coast had fields like this. He didn’t know Jersey had...anything like this. He had only really been in the state that once, with the Turducken thing. Aside from the dense Pineys, he had thought it was all Jersey shore tans and choked off New York mimicry.
His days are quiet and easy and he’s been thinking more and more about how that one bartender smiles at him sometimes. His mom has bees too, apparently, so he actually contributes when Dean gets chatty about his own hive. His eyes are pale hazel, shifting between grey and brown depending on the light, and sometimes Dean thinks that maybe you could even call them honey-colored.
“Don’t apologize.”
And just like that, their road trip has a documentarian.
Jessica nods. “Happens all the time. More in cats, I think, but if she still has her appetite and it’s the physical act of eating that’s the problem? Usually teeth. But hey, she’s here and we’ll get her all checked out and whatever the problem is, we’ll find it, okay?”
“We can go anywhere,” Dean answers automatically. He takes Cas’s hand and pulls forward, wanting to move in closer to the trees, to see how dense a Central Jersey forest is. There’s tension in his arm, Cas holding still a moment, their fingers folded close. Before Dean can turn to check, he hears the camera click.
Lauren and Mary Catherine coo over that. Amanda drops into an office chair as if she were a Victorian woman, swooning onto a divan. “I can relate,” she hums, eyes big and sad. “Matthew broke up with me last night.”
“Get away from him!” Dean yells and he’s staggering forward. Sam let his guard down, so Dean is up in God’s face in a second.
The imprint of Cas’s wings burnt into the ground bare a handprint, high on the left, where Dean levels himself up off the ground.
“Gotta update Miracle’s info. First, she’s part otterhound and — What d’you call it, Cas?”
Dean just nodded again, eyes shaded, and thanked her for her help.
Dean, not just at him. Cas pulls him in and the kiss is messy and sloppy and if his need was expressed in rambling, trailing promises then Cas’s is in this kiss. In the way his teeth skim along Dean’s bottom lip, and the way his head cants to the side, and the way his fingers twist into Dean’s hair.
“I’m very excited,” Cas says and, really, then, so is Dean.
“Fine,” Cas answers, after considering a moment. And then, with horrifying clarity, he remembers puking next to motel. “I vomited last night.”
“You also said that you like my face.”
“Total friend of Dorothy,” Jessica confirms with a nod. “Sam, the brother, said that the person Dean’s missing is a
“Big pause button,” Dean says, claiming his seat next to Cas. “I said we could all have a beer together. There was no agreement about hard liquor.”
“Oh, right, of course.” Dean swallows and with how close Cas is, he wouldn’t be surprised if he could feel the movement.
“And coffee?” Cas confirms as they break into the morning sun.
Dean pulls off, rises with another searing kiss and pads to his duffel, shifts clothes around until he finds a wrinkled packet of lube. When he turns back, he’s caught by the sight of Cas: sprawled back, blue eyes so wide and legs still open to hold the shape of Dean between them. They meet sightlines and Cas tilts his head. His eyes are soft and his mouth is a little slack and Dean’s chest feels like it might cave in from want, from longing. Cas is right there in front of him and Dean misses him so badly it’s like he’s got his own Holy Wound, lanced beneath his heart.
“Dean–”
A throat clears from the back computer station and we turn to find Jessica, smirking. “Told you so.”
Dean glances at the clock and winces a little. “Yeah, I should.”
Ash falling in their hair at a graveyard and the whole of their ragtag crew around them, Cas offered to go with him. Cas tipped his head back from the embrace enough to catch Dean’s gaze and offered to do what he always offered to do: walk beside Dean into almost certain death.
Dean smothers the gasp that rises through his chest into his pillow and forces himself to name prime numbers until he falls asleep.
After that, Sam starts researching, convinced that there’s “something hinky” going on. He starts bringing his laptop to Dean with “get this” on the tip of his tongue and factoids about bees at the ready. He talks about wasps and attack pheromones, eusocial behavior and male vs. female characteristics, climate change and homing spells.
Winchester does him the service of not calling him on the lie, not pointing out that he ran into his room in the middle of the night wearing nothing but underwear and the blush over his cheeks. “Of course you weren’t,” he agrees, still grinning. “Hey, why don’t you just...sit a minute?” he says. Reaching past Castiel, he pulls a bottle of middling whiskey off the dresser and holds it for him to see. His eyes make the offer clear.
and he knows why. Because Cas is human, Cas is touchable. Castiel the angel, even when he was on their side against Heaven, smelled like the latex from dandelions and had an awareness of the whole world reeling through his head. This Cas is smaller and right there and burns through Dean like his trueform burned through Pamela Barnes’s eyes.
“You all right, Cas?” Sam asks the darkness
“Dean,” he says again, just as urgent and solemn as before.
Cas looks down, eyelashes fanning along his cheekbones. “I can’t. You said I can’t.”
They drift and regroup and rearrange through the day -- Sam and Dean make camp, Eileen and Jack set off on a hike, Cas and Jack spend a long time in a copse of tree, listening for different birds.
Dean has always been good at metaphors so he shakes his head. “Listen. That’s some bullshit that girls tell themselves when they’re going through a break-up or whatever. That’s not...this.” Us. “This isn’t permanent, I promise. Okay. You can --”
And when Dean Carter first came in, we all assumed he was in the latter category. He was also certified movie star handsome so we all straightened a little at our tasks and watched out of the corner of our eye as Mary Catherine welcomed him with her sunny, corn-fed sincerity and asked how they could help him.
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of it before,” Chuck says, as if he’s just solved an insect infestation. “It was always Castiel, wasn’t it? What did Naomi call him -- the famous spanner in the works?” Chuck laughs, almost fondly. Crouching, he leans close to Cas’s face.
And Dean… Dean thinks about that voice on the other end of the phone, the way his heart Pavlov’d into an uplift when his text tone chimed, the quiet intention in Cas’s voice when he said
“Not at all,” Castiel replies and he’s still smiling but he has his face tilted down and yes, Sam is an
“We’re gonna have to bunk up,” Dean says through a yawn. “Hope you don’t mind.”
Stupidly, the only thought Dean manages to get a hold of is
His far hand comes up and cups Dean’s cheek to tilt his face in. Cas kisses him sure and sweet. This is new enough, or they're taking it slow enough, that Dean is still tallying the kisses. This is the ninth and it’s just as good as the eighth, just as good as the seventh, the third, the first. Cas’s fingertips are curved to just drift over the bones in Dean’s face, like Dean is fragile or precious. Like maybe he’s trying to match his fingers to the prints he left on Dean when he rebuilt him, soul up.
“Yes...” Castiel pries his daughter’s attention from the video tiles across the computer screen. “Claire, how old are you going to be?”
Even beneath the mask, Sam’s wide grin is obvious.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greets calmly, with a soft smile. Dean feels something warm swell just beneath his chest. “Claire, would you like to show Dean what you made?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam’s smile softens and he bends to lean his elbows against the cart handle. “That makes sense,” he says and any hint of teasing is gone from his voice.
“I was going to say that I believe Claire and Jack, and perhaps even Sam, conspired against us tonight.”
, Dean tells himself, still trying to figure out just what it is about his friend that makes his eyes cross when he looks.
Coming out of the pink morning sky, a bumblebee weaves into his vision. Dean can’t help the smile that passes his face, lets the ache that settles against his chest just live there for a moment. The bee lands on Bunker’s head and the dog’s eyes cant up. Dean watches. The bee rises and finally settles on Dean’s nose. “Hey, Cas,” he breathes out, calm and serene and at peace.
“Dude. Shut up,” is Dean’s brilliant retort. “He sent a picture, too, look.” Dean holds out his phone and Sam can see a beaming Claire on hands in knees in what appears to be a pavement driveway. There are bright patches of color all around her, broken up by bold block letters spelling out CLAIRE and DADDY. There’s a drawing of a bee and one of a frog that are a bit too well done to have been the work of an almost-three-year-old.
Cas laughs. It’s the first time Dean’s heard it in awhile but it is an ugly thing. It is twisted and full of hurt. “I told you, Dean. I found something I’m good at. And it’s not something that...fits into your life. When I was an angel, maybe, but now. I don’t want -  I won’t return to the bunker, to hunting, to you. All that’s there is...past failures.”
The car is still running, thrown into park at an angle up against the bunker’s entrance and once they’re inside, both Jack and Sam are screaming for Dean and Cas. Sam is sure that he’s going to find Dean’s phone on the floor, shattered, with all those messages and calls collecting, just like Eileen’s. He doesn’t know what to expect of Cas.
“Oh, did you get that Doggie DNA thing?” Lauren asks.
“Everyone out,” is all Sam says in response.
wants to touch Cas’s hair.
It’s a testament to how shaken Castiel is
“How does that feel?” he asks, clearing his throat, standing suddenly to pack things away.
All he really knows is that he stays up too late texting Cas and one of the first things he does when he wakes up is text back. Cas has been added to his daily round of idle wondering: How’s Jo doing with her mom? Does Bobby need anything? Is Sammy driving himself insane? What would help Cas and Claire?
Eileen finds a Polaroid instant-print camera at one of the second-hand shops they roll through -- oldschool, with the flash that flips up. A specialty store a few towns over has some of the film and the first picture she takes is of Sam, eyes dazed from the flash but still smiling a little because, well, he’s usually smiling when he’s looking at Eileen.
Dean, despite himself, has to grin a little nodding. “We always called it the two-step,” he says, scooping up his shot glass once Claire tops it off.
Sam rolls his eyes but he’s smiling and there’s no room for anything but pride in his chest. “Yeah, Dean’s pretty great.”
A second later and one of the throw pillows connects with Sam’s head, but he decides it’s worth it.
Cas wakes overly warm and with a soreness in his head that he’s never experienced before. He's had headaches, he's had a concussion, he's been punched in the face. This is none of those things and, also, all those things at once. Before he wakes up any further, he lets out a soft whine at the pain and burrows further into his pillow. It’s hot and a little sweaty and too firm, but that's preferable to the light that exists outside. Light, he's finding, is very bad for this terrible head pain.
“I’m not worth this,” he said, more to himself than to Dean. “I’m too messed up. You should’ve left a long time ago. I thought you were gone and I wasn’t even surprised. I’ve been waiting for you to leave since the moment we got here.” Cas looked at Dean. The vampire’s face was unreadable. Cas held himself tighter.
“I’ll get them!” Jack said brightly, scrambling out of the chair to pick up the cards that had scattered all over the floor.
“No. No, Sam and Rowena are gonna fix this, okay? Hey, I’ve had worse.”
“Exactly. It also made it easier for me to write while I was still at home. My parents are…very particular. They don’t know I’m a writer and it’s better that they don’t. At least for right now.” Charlie nodded.
. I think they would at least wanna know about it.”
“Being a big brother isn’t supposed to be easy,” Gabriel said with a small smile. “I don’t know what goes through your head most of the time, but I’m always looking out for you. I don’t wanna lose you to that darkness. Not if I can do something.” The guilt was bubbling up to Cas’s chest. He felt nauseous.
“Why would you get Cas a Christmas present?”
“Together,” Cas repeated before kissing him again.
“All right then.” Dean mixed two more drinks and they walked out onto the patio in the back. It was cold outside, so no one else was out there. Dean zipped up his jacket and tucked his free hand into the pocket of his jeans. Cas did the same, leaning against the railing.
“Just asking Bobby if I could borrow some work space. I’m fixing up a ’78 Continental. Cas is gonna do his project on it.”
“Meg,” Balthazar slid into the booth beside Gabriel, “and Balthazar. What a pleasure.” Cas narrowed his eyes playfully at his brother. “I should’ve known you didn’t just wanna hang out.”
“Can we talk?”
“I’m sure you did nothing wrong,” Cas said gently. “Some people just don’t work. You can be the perfect boyfriend, but if the other person doesn’t feel it, then it doesn’t matter. Nothing you do will ever be good enough for them, and they don’t deserve you.” Cas moved onto Dean’s lap, and kissed him. “I know you’re upset, but I’m glad she broke up with you, because now I can show you just how amazing you are.”
“Hey, Balt.”
“My lovely older brother dragged me here today, forced me to go on a ride with him, then ditched me for the pretty girl who was standing in front of us.” Dean laughed and Castiel decided he liked the sound.
“You’re gonna sit there and tell me you don’t think he’s attractive?”
“That’s great, Dean!” She hugged him.
“She just crosses my mind from time to time. I miss her.”
“Not me I’m worried about, Dean.” Dean swallowed before taking Cas in his mouth. He was more than pleased that Cas was already hard. He teased for a minute, just to see what he could get away with before he took Cas all the way. Years of practice had rendered his gag reflex virtually nonexistent, and he’d mastered the art of finding spaces to breathe. Cas inhaled sharply, fingers digging into Dean’s scalp. He rolled his hips and Dean caught on immediately. He stilled his head and let his jaw go slack, looking up at Cas through his eyelashes. The question in his eyes was clear and Dean nodded.
“Dude, that’s awesome! I’m proud of you, Sammy.” Dean stretched out on his couch. “So, you can basically go to any law school you want, huh?”
Been a while. Thought we could grab lunch or something. I miss you.
Hang in there angel I’m on my way
“That city that’s been on the news? The one being torn apart by war?” Dean and Cas both nodded.
“So you’re just picking random people up off the street now?” Gabriel asked.
“Thank you, Dean. I love it.” There was a stretch of silence where Dean forgot there were other people in the room. His world narrowed down to him and Cas and the ridiculous amount of space between them that he wanted to close, but he knew he shouldn’t.
“I love you.”
3am update because I have to work all day and I have no idea when I'll be able to get back to my laptop. So enjoy and please pray for me because 13 hours is way too long to work.
“I’m not disagreeing with you, but Mom’s not upset about it and she welcomed Adam with open arms. You should, too. I’m not asking you to like him. I’m not asking you to be his best friend. All I’m asking is that you stop treating him like an outcast. He wants to learn, so teach him. I know he’s half human, but he’s also half vampire. He has potential.” Dean sighed. He hated it when Sam used logic on him. It made it a lot harder for him to argue.
“I’m not the golden boy. That’s Michael. Gabriel keeps trying to convince me I’m the favorite, but I’m not.”
“Why are you wearing Dean’s shirt?” Castiel looked down. Shit. He hadn’t even noticed, but he was already late. Oh well.
“Gabe, how tall are you?” Gabriel rolled his eyes.
want.”
His mind wandered back to Dean within minutes. He knew he was probably getting himself into a bad situation, but he was finding it hard to care. Dean was nice. He would even consider Dean a friend if there wasn’t the possibility it could get them both killed. It was fine, though. The amendment they’d made to their arrangement was more than enough for him. He smiled a little. It had been three weeks since Cas answered Dean’s question and he was pretty sure he’d made the right decision. His phone pinged, startling him out of his thoughts. He frowned and picked it up.
“Sure.” Dean walked up front to turn on the coffee machines. Charlie followed him, frowning.
“Welcome to Missouri’s!” A female voice called from the back. “I’ll be right with you!”
“Maybe you two shouldn’t be allowed to sit next to each other,” Jo said.
“You don’t even know him. You just met him. You weren’t there when--.” Dean stopped. He had no reason to tell him anything. It wasn’t like Cas was an open book. “You don’t know him and you don’t know me. You don’t know any of us. You’re just here to pass the time until you get to California. We don’t mean anything to you.” Yeah, he was probably going straight to hell for that one, but he didn’t care. He had to push Cas away before he got any closer. He was surprised when Cas smiled.
“Why? Scared you can’t handle it?”
“I don’t work on Wednesdays and Chuck’s officially made you my “assignment” so I don’t have to go home unless I have information, which I don’t and I won’t.” Dean raised an eyebrow.
“It runs?”
“No, Cas, I’m terrified of her. She’s a five-foot-five firecracker of a woman and she could kick my ass without breaking a sweat.” Cas laughed harder.
“Did you feel guilty?”
“Hey, I like a little biting every once in a while as much as the next guy, but I kinda like all my blood, ya know, in my body.” Meg laughed.
Thank God. Dean needed someone sensible to talk to before he saw the train wreck that was his friend group. He loved them, but Cas was his voice of reason, and he needed that first. He sat on a bench and waited.
“Hello, Your Highness.”
Dean pocketed his phone. When he got back out front, Charlie was chatting up a regular. She wrapped up her conversation, said her goodbyes with a wink, and met Dean at the coffee machine.
thinking about Dean.
“Hey. I don’t share food unless you ask.”
“Not a lot. I was actually just about to call you. Any chance I can crash in your spare room for a bit?”
“All right. But first, here.” Cas reached beside the couch and handed Dean a slim, square box. “I wasn’t sure if it was weird to get you something, but I saw it and I felt obligated.” Dean smiled.
“Let’s finish up so we can go home.” Cas smiled and nodded. They closed faster than they usually did and went upstairs. Dean pulled Cas onto the couch and kissed him deeply. Cas responded by moving closer and opening his mouth in invitation. Their tongues brushed together and Dean sank his fingers into Cas’s hair.
“Did you make coffee?”
“You’re no fun,” Dean pouted. It was probably a bad idea, but Cas found the look on his face undeniably adorable, so he took Dean’s glass and tipped half of his own into it.
“I need some air,” Cas said. He followed the instructions he had been given and found Dean leaning against the dumpsters with his vape between his lips. He was dressed in street clothes and he looked
“Tenth and Eleventh Doctor. You two look adorable.” Cas nodded his agreement as he took a few atmospheric pictures before turning the camera to Charlie and Gilda.
Cas spent the night on the couch. He didn’t want to risk upsetting Dean again. In the morning, he got up and made breakfast. When the smell of bacon didn’t lure Dean out of the bedroom, he brought him a plate. Dean was still curled up on top of the comforter. It didn’t look like he had moved all night. Cas crossed the room and set the plate on the nightstand.
“She shouldn’t be allowed to drive!”
Next update will be tomorrow
“But I won’t get any further than a goodnight kiss.” Cas smiled softly and sipped his drink. Dean groaned. Cas was going to kill him. He drank his bourbon as slowly as he could manage. When his glass was empty he said, “Would it be okay if I kissed you?”
“‘Loser buys dinner’ is not a bet, Castiel,” Balthazar insisted. “It’s a way of asking you out without asking you out so you can’t reject him.”
“I can’t believe she got your car impounded. That’s, like, the bitchiest move ever.”
“Don’t change the subject.”
“Yes,” Cas answered without hesitation. “It matches my eyes.” This time everyone laughed, but still no one argued. Once the pieces were distributed, they rolled the die to see which team would go first.
fitting as far as he was concerned. He wasn’t an angel. Far from it, actually. He put his phone back in his pocket and waited for Meg to show up.
me boss you around?” Dean stilled by the stove and Cas smirked. Dean Winchester had the most badass reputation of anyone he knew, and yet he was putty in Cas’s hands.
, he scolded himself. Between not having coffee and Dean’s voice being the first thing he heard that morning, he was going crazy. He wanted nothing more than to grab Dean Winchester by the collar of his stupid leather jacket, and pin him against the side of his stupid vintage car, and kiss him breathless.
“Are you sure?”
“You don’t have to, if--.”
“Hey, look who showed up!” Cas was grinning like a madman. He hugged Gabriel.
Cas stretched out on his bed and sighed happily. He’d gotten more work done in the past few weeks than he had in months and he had Dean to thank for that. There was something about him. Not necessarily character material, but bits and pieces of his personality definitely fit. He wasn’t worried about Dean finding out. Dean said he didn’t like romance novels, and even if he did, Cas’s pen name was about as far away from his real name as it could get. So he wasn’t worried. His phone started ringing.
“Cas…wait.” Cas moved back so Dean could sit up. “Sorry, I just don’t think doing this
“No,” Dean grumbled. He felt Cas’s fingers in his hair. He lifted his head and was greeted with a warm kiss. He hummed softly. “We’ve got about ten minutes before we’re accosted. Think we can do it?”
“Tough shit, Gabe. Chuck in his office?” Gabriel raised an eyebrow.
dramatic.” Charlie gave Dean a hug. “Tell him to stop being such a baby.”
“Is he sober?”
“Hey. I’m guessing you saw it?”
“I don’t like this, Cas. All the moving around. I need to settle. I’m restless now.” Restlessness was never a good thing for Gabriel. He had gone on bagged blood decades ago. He never really could stomach the killing. Cas was only slightly better about it. He compensated by only killing truly evil people. Most of the time. He figured he was doing the world a service that way.
“Meg, nothing happened. Nothing’s
“You can only stay if you promise to behave. I’ve got a lotta work to do. Okay?” Maggie wagged her tail and licked Dean’s nose. He laughed. “Good.” He put her back on the floor.
“Shit.
“Uh…yeah. Here. Sorry I’m late. Won’t happen again.”
“What’s up, Gabe?”
“Did you get my message earlier?”
“Just wanted to know if you still wanted to get a drink?” Dean looked at his clock. It was almost eight. He’d slept for ten hours.
“Shut up,” Dean muttered around his coffee mug.
“No, you won’t.” Cas could hear the smile in Gabriel’s voice. “Later, Cas.” Gabriel hung up and music filled Cas’s ears again. He smiled to himself. He loved his older brother more than anyone. Gabriel had practically raised him. Even when they had next to no money, and were on the verge of being homeless, Gabriel had always found a way to help Cas pursue his passion.
Cas sighed. Now he felt bad. He set his phone on the bed beside him and closed out the Wikipedia page. He looked at the document he’d been working in. As usual, he spent more time researching than he did actually writing. He chuckled to himself. He could move to a different state and start his life over, but some things would never change.
“I won’t give up on you because you’re my little brother. Is it frustrating sometimes, yes, but only because I hate that you can’t see how awesome you are. Everyone’s got their issues, Cas. Maybe you have a few more than others, but that’s not your fault. All you can do is deal with them the best you can. And if the best you can is drinking binges and popping pills then I’m gonna be there for you. I care about you. Being an older brother isn’t supposed to be easy and I wouldn’t trade you for anyone else.” Cas swallowed and held back the new wave of tears threatening to fall. He closed his eyes and gripped his brother’s shirt.
“When we started this, we said it wasn’t anything serious. We were just gonna have fun until we got bored. I’m okay with that, but it feels like we’re getting a little too…domestic. If you want me to continue being okay with this not being serious, then we need to set boundaries. I don’t know where you are on all this, and I don’t want to risk getting myself hurt.” Cas nodded slowly.
1:30am update because I can't sleep. Thank you to the people who have been leaving me lovely comments. You guys always make my day better! Hope you all enjoy!
“What happened?” Dean asked.
“Of course, but Dean said it was nothing and I didn’t press.”
“I’m giving them good press and I’m helping people.” Gabriel stared at him. “Seeing Dean is just an added bonus.”
“I should’ve told you about my concerns. I didn’t think…I didn’t want to
“She had depression after she had all of us,” Gabriel said. “I guess it was just too much for her the last time.”
“Yes, why?”
“I’m gonna catch a ride with Dean, but thanks.” They all went their separate ways. Dean and Cas were completely silent until they got to Baby. Dean spoke first.
“Nah, it’s fine. I’ll be ready. See ya.”
“Sure, Claire.”
Next update will be Wednesday
“Yes, we all know,” Jo said as she came out of the kitchen. She handed Dean two bags. “Sam’s salad and your bag of cholesterol.”
“It doesn’t have to be.”
“What’s Meg’s thing? And where is she anyway?”
The council meeting was a disaster. Fifteen people were dead and the Novaks were officially at war with the Winchesters. Cas had slipped out the side door and walked home, shutting his phone off as he went. He knew everyone was going to blow him up, asking where he was. He needed to be alone for a while. When he got up to his apartment, he sat on the couch and poured himself a drink. Then two more. He could feel himself slipping into that dark place in his mind. He couldn’t handle this.
“Never said we were gonna sleep, Sammy,” Dean said with a grin and a wink. Cas’s eyes started glowing a little. Dean grabbed his arm. “Come on, buddy.” They left the room and Gabriel looked at Sam.
“I know. I’ll be okay in a few day once I fall into a routine.” He forced a smile and kissed his mother’s cheek. “I’ll be back before midnight. I promise.”
“Dean Winchester.”
“I love you, Cas.” Dean pulled back a little. “Remember that, okay? Always remember that.” “I will. I love you, too.”
“Okay.” Dean kissed the top of Cas’s head.
uncomfortable. Watching it wasn’t worth fifty bucks. Which reminds me, pay up.” There was some grumbling, but Charlie, Gabriel, and Gilda all handed Sam his money.
“Hey, let me up.” Cas buzzed his brother in and sat on the couch.
“When was the last time you slept?”
“I know. See you tomorrow.” Gabriel walked out the door. Cas powered on his phone. He was immediately inundated with texts and missed calls. Most of them were from Dean.
. Can’t exactly sneak out.”
“The only one who should shut up is SAM!”
“You know, you shouldn’t drink alone.” Dean jumped and nearly knocked his drink over. Cas laughed.
“Can I get two whiskeys, a bourbon, and a strawberry margarita? Thanks!” Dean looked around Sam and saw Gabriel Novak leaning against the bar. If he was here then Cas had to be around somewhere. Gabriel caught him looking and smirked. “Hey, Winchester.”
“Sure. We’ll be over in ten.”
“You know I will.” Ruby walked out the door and Cas settled into his chair. He kept the door unlocked. There probably wouldn’t be any customers anyway. He took out his phone and called Gabriel.
All right guys, I'm posting in the middle of the night because I have to work in the morning and I'm gonna be dead tired when I get home. Enjoy y'all!
“Us. Well, not
“Hey, where are you staying?” Dean actually hadn’t thought about that.
“I don’t think I’m the right person to answer that question,” he said, “and I think you need to stop drinking.” Dean held his cup closer to his chest. His eyes were glassy and unfocused.
“Not gonna argue with that,” a voice said from behind them. Cas spun around to face his brother.
“Sam is aroused again,” Cas commented.
“Thirty years, Sam. That’s
“I’m fine, Cas, I just had a rough day, and I don’t need you nagging me right now.”
“Do you think I killed Mom?” The question was barely audible, but Gabriel dropped the remote.
You’re sure?
“Maybe later.”
“Trusting you and trusting your ability to experiment with baked goods are two very different things. But I don’t think you’d try to poison me on purpose.” Cas took the pretzel and took a bite. “This is actually really good.”
“Dad, don’t you think we should make an example of her?” Adam asked. It took every ounce of strength Dean had not to roll his eyes. One of these days his half-brother would understand how things worked. Or he would be killed before he figured it out. Dean was pretty sure it would be the latter.
“I just might.” Dean laughed. Jo came back over with another round.
, with as many local and national reporters as he could gather. For the first time in his life, Cas was actually scared to be in front of that many people. Dean’s words echoed in his head.
Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do ;)
By the end of the hour, Dean was rock hard and trying to sit absolutely still so he didn’t draw attention to himself. Cas ended the class then said,
“Someone’s snippy. You mad that me and Sammy beat you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You like it, so keep it.” Cas stared at him for a very long minute and Dean could feel his cheeks heating up.
“Give me your phone.”
“I know. I never should’ve said anything. It’s just something I think about from time to time. I’d never actually do it.” Cas was only about seventy-five percent sure he would never actually do it, but he didn’t want Dean to be scared of him.
“That could be trouble.” Cas didn’t like the look on Meg’s face.
“I love you, Cas. Have you thought about who we’re gonna pick for a photographer?” Cas snorted.
“This is nice.” Dean put his arm around Cas.
“Apparently that’s off limits.”
“You’re so dramatic. I’ll text you when I get there so you know I’m okay.” Dean smiled.
“Well, I’ve gotta get something outta this arrangement.”
“Are you sure?”
Cas closed his laptop after three hours of staring at a blank document. He hadn’t gotten any work done in months. He was completely blocked. He stared out the window at the ocean. The leaves on the palm trees were just a little too green. He closed his eyes.
“Looks like they’re getting along,” Dean said as they watched Sam put his hand on Gabriel’s arm. Cas smirked.
“How?” Cas was suddenly very nervous.
Dean shoved his phone in his jacket pocket and took the back way out. Everything in him was telling him to run to Cas’s apartment, but the last thing he needed was to be out of breath when he got there, so he settled for jogging. It only took him ten minutes, but they were the longest ten minutes of his life. By the time he was standing in the elevator, he jittery with nervous excitement. When the doors dinged open, Cas didn’t even give him a chance to speak. He was pulled into the living room, pushed onto the couch, and then Cas was straddling him, kissing him roughly.
“There he is!” Charlie said, hopping down from the table. Dean groaned.
my eyes, not
“Because we’re cute and in love. People like that.”
“A hundred and fifty kids.”
“Yes, Cas.”
“Yeah,
“Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. It’s Dean. I know it’s been a while and I’m sorry about that. I’m also sorry Sammy isn’t here. He misses you guys, too. He’s having a great time in California though. He’s in law school and he’s living with his boyfriend. Guess I probably should’ve let him tell you about that, but I think he probably won’t care now. So yeah, Sammy’s dating a guy named Gabriel. I was dating his brother until a few days ago. Some things happened, it’s not important. I really just came here to tell you that…I’m back. Sam doesn’t need me and Bobby…Bobby died a few months back, so there’s really nothing out there for me anymore.
“Out. I need some air.” He stormed out of the apartment, his anger taking the wheel for a few minutes. He was mostly angry with himself. He knew his feelings for Cas weren’t mutual, and yet he was letting himself indulge in the little moments. The way Cas’s hair felt under his fingers. The smell of his shampoo. The little smile that never quite left his face when he was starting to fall asleep. His phone buzzed in his pocket. It was probably Sam, but he checked in anyway. He had two messages.
“Shut up. Finish your book so we can watch Clint Eastwood.”
The class ended thirty minutes later. Once the field was cleared, Dean put his hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
“You can’t walk out on my brother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
***   ***   ***
“Dean, I could hear you praying.”
Sorry got stuck in a lecture about how I’m irresponsible
“It’s fine. She’s very nice.”
The drive to Cas’s apartment was quiet. Cas didn’t look like he was in the mood to talk, so Dean didn’t try to initiate a conversation. What could he say? Their families were about to go to war. There was nothing he could say or do to make it better. He still believed they could stop it, but now wasn’t the time to start brainstorming. Cas clearly needed a break, so Dean was going to give it to him. He pulled up in front of the building and cut the engine.
If your brother got a perfect score on the SATs he’ll have his pick of colleges. How are things between them?
“Are you gonna pick your college based on where Jessica goes? Because I like her a lot, but you shouldn’t make this kind of decision based on a girl.”
“I’ll talk to Jack. Do you know when that’ll be?”
“Dean, can we talk about this somewhere that’s not outside in the middle of a snowstorm? Please?” It took a minute, but Dean eventually held out his hand in silent invitation. Cas took it and they walked back to Dean’s apartment. Once they were upstairs and each holding a cup of hot chocolate, Dean finally spoke.
“Sammy,” he said as the line started moving again.
“You know I don’t mind.” He didn’t. It had taken a lot of talking (and more fights than either of them cared to admit), but Cas had somehow managed to convince Dean he was ready for kids. Adopting one kid was daunting enough, but the idea of having twins terrified him. He had agreed to make Cas happy and now he couldn’t imagine his life without the girls. He didn’t say a word when Cas said he wanted to name them after his cousin and best friend. He thought it was a nice way to honor them, and if they ever decided to adopt a son, Dean was going to name him Adam.
“Later.” Dean walked out the door, and Cas went to the counter. He got a caramel vanilla latte to go, and headed for school. He wasn’t a morning person, but he couldn’t miss his classes. Not with graduation just three months away. He had come this far, he could make it. He stumbled into the student lounge and found an empty table. He had just spread out his papers when Charlie popped up next to him.
“Would you two mind
“Hello, Dean.”
“Okay. Get some sleep. We’ve got an early flight.”
“Yes,” he answered honestly. “I don’t wanna be. You seem really nice, but after spending my entire life being told that you’re dangerous…it’s just gonna take some getting used to.” Dean stepped back a little.
“Of course you do.”
“I know, but I can’t get him to break the habit. Neither can Sam. Dean would rather help everyone else with all of their issues, than deal with his own. Why are you so interested?”
“If you trust her, then I trust her.” Dean crossed the room and pressed their lips together again. Cas melted into it, his fingers finding their way into Dean’s hair. He was only slightly aware when Dean pushed him back onto one of the beds. He registered the mattress and the sheets, but only just barely. His sole focus was the feel of Dean’s lips against his. The way Dean’s hands slipped under his t-shirt and trailed across his skin.
“Hell no. She’s mine, but we’ve got a ’76 Continental that we can’t take with us. Thought you might like it.”
“You know, sometimes I think Jo tells Benny to make my food with love and sometimes I think she tells him to put all the hate he’s ever felt into it.” Cas tilted his head.
“Pass.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“Why are you so against me helping you?”
“I more thought the plot looked interesting.”
“You know their life is probably nothing like the characters’ lives, right? They probably write all that while sitting on their couch in their pajamas.” Charlie sighed wistfully.
Dean woke up to Cas’s breath on the side of his neck and his voice in his ear.
“Well, I prefer you less sober.” Cas handed him a glass and Dean didn’t refuse. Having this conversation sober probably wasn’t the best idea anyway. He drank half of it before he spoke.
“Great! We can meet at my apartment whenever you’re not busy. As soon as the month ends, I’m closing commissions until after the honeymoon so I’ll be free whenever. Just make sure you call first.”
“Since?” Dean prompted. Cas swallowed.
I’m glad he did. He’s happy.” “Are you?” Dean smiled.
Coffee doesn’t taste quite the same if you don’t make it but don’t tell Charlie I said that
“Gabe wants to know how it’s going. And he sent a winky face.”
“I’ll be fine. And feel free to duct tape Balthazar’s mouth and…anything else until this is over. I don’t need anything upsetting Cas.”
“You know what, it’s been a while, but I bet I can still kick your ass at Monopoly.” Dean grinned.
“Dean. I
"I like it,” Jack said matter-of-factly. Dean left Jack to his hot, sugary bean water and went to help a customer.
“Your list sucks.”
“Thanks.” Dean disappeared again, this time only for a few minutes. Then he got into the driver’s seat. “I’m pretty sure that guy thinks we’re insane.” He shifted the car into gear. The fifteen minute drive to the garage was agonizing. Dean spent the entire time singing along to Led Zeppelin songs, leading Cas to discover that the man had a voice like velvet, and doing nothing to stop the hardening in his jeans. By the time Dean parked in front of the garage, Cas was practically losing his mind. He jumped out of the car and made a beeline for the bathroom. He locked the door and took a deep breath. He had two options. Wait and see if he could calm himself down, or sink to a new low and jerk off in the bathroom of an auto shop.
“I guess not. Just seems like you’re spending an awful lot of time with someone that no one seems to know anything about.”
“Sorry.”
“Cas?”
“That’s not true,” Cas interrupted. “I never said I never had relationships. I was just never intimate with any of them.” Dean blinked.
Dean had a feeling that wasn’t at all what Cas had meant when he suggested they go one-on-one. And while he was flattered that someone so gorgeous had taken an interest in him, he wasn’t ready to start another relationship.
“Besides, I’m gonna need someone to hold the camera.” Dean laughed as he parked Baby on the street.
“I promise it’s not what you’re probably thinking, but you really don’t.” They moved to one of the circular booths in the back and Jo came over to take their order.
“All night. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe for the rest of your life.” Dean shrugged, grinning. “We’ll see how it goes.” Cas groaned.
“That…wasn’t one of the options, Dean. Chocolate or vanilla?”
How did Sam’s test go?
“Thanks, Cas. How do you feel about steak?” Cas tilted his head.
“Well then, have fun and stay safe.” Adam left the room and Dean got in the shower. After Adam had woken him up, he had spent the rest of the night dreaming of raven hair and blue eyes. He hadn’t seen Cas in weeks and it was driving him crazy. Not since he accidentally spent the night. He still felt a little guilty about that. Even though Cas said it was fine, he still felt like he was intruding. They were fuck buddies. Dean had no right to fall asleep in his bed. He should’ve gone home the second they were done. Instead, he let himself get comfortable. By the time he shut the water off, he had made a decision. No more hooking up at Cas’s apartment. No hooking up at either of their apartments. He had known something like this would happen.
“About what? The hit?” Dean nodded. “No. I figure he’ll just tell us when it’s done.” Dean nodded again and continued pacing. “What’s got you all jittery?”
“Good.”
“You checked out those safe-houses I gave you.”
“You’re not a monster, Dean.” He put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Listen to me. You’re still learning. You’ll get there, okay?” Dean nodded and buried his face in Cas’s chest. Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair. He felt a twinge of guilt, which was why he had the rule about not getting attached. Over the centuries, he had only turned a handful of people, but that was it. He turned them, helped them through the worst part of the process, and then set them loose on the world. He couldn’t do that with Dean.
“Okay.” He leaned into Cas’s touch a little. Cas scratched his fingernails along Dean’s scalp before pulling him into a gentle kiss. It wasn’t long before their breakfast was forgotten and they were tangled in the sheets. Dean was a whimpering mess and Cas was enjoying teasing him. It was an hour later before Cas got up to take a second shower. Dean joined him. They reheated their breakfast and curled up on the couch together to watch TV.
“Where are you going?” Cas stopped, his hand on the door handle.
I was just teasing
I’ll call you tonight
“Okay. Thanks.”
“You made breakfast, it’s the least I can do.” Cas cleared the table and Dean went to take a shower. He knew it was probably pointless since they would be in Baby together for at least ten minutes, but he had to try and wash off their mixed scent. By the time Dean came out of his room, Cas was sitting on the couch, phone pressed to his ear. “Gabe, relax. I’ll be there soon…I won’t…I’m hanging up now…Just make sure no one does anything stupid…Haha, very funny. I’ll call you when I’m on my way…Yes, I promise…Goodbye, Gabriel.” Cas pulled his phone away from his ear and sighed.
“Are you saying that this was consensual?” She jabbed a pointy fingernail at the picture under the headline. Cas averted his eyes and stayed silent. “Or were you attacked?” Cas’s head shot up.
“No, you can’t, and I’m glad you know that. But you should at least say it to each other.”
“All right. Come on.” Cas waited in the Impala while Dean locked up, then rested his head on Dean’s shoulder the entire drive back to the apartment, the smile never quite leaving his face.
“Everything. For saying you were dead to me. For blaming you for what happened with Jack. For forcing you to work with Belphagor when you told me you could barely look at him. For ignoring you when you tried to talk to me about your failing grace. For saying that everything was always your fault. I’m sorry, Cas. I know it probably doesn’t mean anything, but I am sorry. I had no right to ever make you feel unwanted. I’m sorry I made you feel like I don’t care. I do. You and Sam are just about the only thing I care about anymore. I wish there was something I could do to prove that to you.”
“Defending someone’s honor?”
No why?
“I love you, too.” Dean put his phone back in his pocket.
“Please don’t call me that. I’m twenty-two, I’m not a kid anymore.”
The second he walked through the door into his apartment, his phone rang. His heart rate sky rocketed as he fumbled it out of his pocket. It was Sam.
“Well, he’s a ray of sunshine,” he said, taking some fries off of Cas’s plate. “What’s his issue?” Cas shrugged.
“Thank God you’re okay. You wouldn’t answer the phone.”
“I had my own life, too, but I didn’t leave you behind. I stayed for five years just to make sure I could take you with me. Should I not have done that? Should I have just let you suffer by yourself?”
“I don’t mind sleeping on the couch. Hell, sometimes I actually prefer it.” He didn’t elaborate and he was grateful Sam didn’t ask him to. Sam sat on the edge of the bed.
“Kiss me.” Cas folded his arms.
“Oh my, God,” Charlie breathed after introductions were made, “she’s gorgeous. Help me.”
“Sam wanted to. He’s always been interested in science and conspiracy theories and stuff. He’s got this weird fascination with serial killers, too. So whenever Dad was on a hunt and would leave us alone, I’d watch the discovery channel with him. Or some special on famous killers. He always looked so excited and he would ramble for hours about different things.” Dean shrugged again. “I always liked seeing that look on his face and I figured being bored for a few hours was worth it.” He and Cas were facing each other now and Cas’s eyes had gone soft. Dean shifted a little. “What?”
He knew Dean wouldn’t text while he was driving so he didn’t expect a response right away. He looked down at Maggie.
“CAS!” Sam whined.
“Good. So we can…do this again?” Cas coughed on his cigarette smoke.
“No. He hasn’t mentioned it since. I was kinda hoping he forgot about it. I’ll tell him the next time he brings it up. I hope he understands.”
“Wait, don’t leave.”
“Aw, come on, Sam. He’s your brother, it’s his job.” Jessica pecked his cheek. Sam put her suitcase in the trunk and held the car door open for her. Dean smiled to himself. Barely eighteen and already a gentleman. He got in the car and sat next to Charlie. Pamela had made her Dean’s personal bodyguard after Minnesota and he was grateful for that. Benny drove them to the airport and Dean went through his usual routine as the plane took off. He was surprised when Sam reached over and held onto his arm. Maybe they were more okay than he thought.
“I don’t even know why Chuck makes me go. I’m not in line to inherit anything. I’m at the bottom of the list.”
Cas woke up to his phone ringing unnecessarily loudly. He groaned and rolled over. He picked it up off the night stand and answered it.
“Sure. And I wanted to talk to you both.”
It’s fine
“Dean and Cas weren’t always together?” Everyone turned to look at him. Dean frowned slightly.
“Hey, Charlie!”
“You’re amazing, ya know that? No one else would put up with this.”
“What can I say? Tips are good and the customers are cute. What can I get you guys?”
“By two minutes. I still have plenty of time before we open.” He walked behind the counter
if you behave.” Cas nodded. He could do that…maybe. Dean’s definition of “behaving” meant not making sex jokes or innuendos while they were in public. Cas was usually relatively okay about it, but tonight was different. This was a milestone for him personally, and Dean really did look hot all dressed up.
“Forgetting something?” Cas gestured to the vest laying on the floor. Dean sighed.
