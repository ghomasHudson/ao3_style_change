“Will do.”
“I am a master detective, my brain is highly functional, making brilliant and fast deductions is my life, John. It is me, my whole sense of existing. By doing that I always have control. That terrible drug made me lose that control and so I wasn’t only not able to make those highly effective deductions as usual, but I also lost control over my body. You saw me that night. I was scared, my hands were trembling, I was shaking and sweating. Ah, it was disgusting.”
A small wave of dizziness swept over him and he had to grab the bedframe to regain his balance. The room was spinning and already his hands were trembling again, as well as his legs.
“Well, boys! That’s a wrap.”
She broke off, looking distressed and John could detect the faint smell of rain in her scent.
He looked up as if he waited for Sherlock to accept his apology. Sherlock was torn though; the man’s posture and face undermined his words, but the apology never reached his eyes. “I’m sorry, I don’t really believe you, “he said curtly and turned to the bar’s entrance.
Nobody would ever hurt Sherlock again. Not if he had any say in it.
John scoffed. “What do you mean, ‘does he know’? Of course, he knows. He always knows everything that’s going on in this country and he sure as hell knows everything that’s going on with you. Who do you think made it possible that you were allowed to go home, instead of the hospital, to be treated by me, here?”
Who could berate him for sharing a few drinks with his best mates on the night before the start of the new semester? It was what they always did, every Sunday evening before the start of classes the next day. He and Mike, together with James Sholto who was an old childhood friend studying management here at Durham, and Greg Lestrade, who studied criminology, as well as a few other blokes. Several of them played in the University’s Rugby Team, including John and Greg.
Sherlock stared pensively into his cup of tea as he blew on it, waiting for it to cool down enough for him to sip it.
To his absolute horror, tears welled up in his eyes, as bile once again rose in his throat. He forced himself to take a few deep breaths through his nose and exhaled slowly through his mouth, John’s calm voice guiding him through the process from inside his head. Calming down gradually, he splashed some cold water into his face, drinking from the tap right after to erase the uncomfortable feeling in his throat. Thankfully, it helped.
“Uhm..it’s good to have you back, Sherlock.” He quickly turned to John. “You too, John. I hope you’ll be able to truly recover now. Both of you.“
“The waitress hasn’t been here for a while, “he observed suddenly. “I need another beer.”
“I thought only one of those were allowed?”
As the ambulance started to drive a paramedic, not the woman from before, she was on the other car tending to Sherlock’s attacker, looked at John cautiously as he held up a needle. Apparently, he had been warned about him.
He reached into the man’s breast pocket and pulled out a black pen. “Interesting, “he mused, “this belongs to him, the killer would not have left it with him, so we should go to his house and see if there’s anything he has written with it but I’d say he has written a lot with it because it’s nearly empty and he’s carrying it with him which means this pen means something to him or the messages he writes with it do. Messages he probably wrote to the woman who left the smear of lipstick on his neck.”
“Why do I feel so strange, John? My body…I don’t feel good and I’m so tired.” Sherlock felt the well-known call of his most inner self, pressuring him to analyse his body’s symptoms, to deduce himself. But he just couldn’t get his brain to function - it felt as if there was a thick, black mass of wax in his head, sticking over his synapses so they wouldn’t be able to pass any signals. To analyse, to deduct, to be himself: it was just not possible right now and that scared him to the core.
John rolled his eyes, too. “Yes, Sherlock, it is. I don’t even have to explain to you why it’s important as you bloody well know why it is.”
“Sherlock, “he said in a teasing tone, as he pushed himself a little upright, stretching his arms, “stop harassing the poor nurses. It’s not nice.”
“Hey, mate, “Greg greeted him, “you really think he’s here?”
“Why?” Greg asked. “He’s a schoolteacher, harmless, clean slate. Why would anyone who’s experienced in shooting people target him? “
“Freak!”
Suddenly, something in his mind shifted and everything around him became blurry and unstable for a moment. The walls of his palace were starting to tremble. He knew the technical reason for it: he was in shock for having realized something distressing and his mind was reacting to it.
Sherlock’s eyebrows arched high, sea-green eyes widening in genuine surprise. “What do you mean, John?”
His hands curled into fists, however, as he watched Magussen stare down at Scott, a victorious smirk on his face and he suddenly wanted to punch the man. Alphas like him were exactly the ones that Scott had meant: Magnussen clearly enjoyed the power he had over his young student and it was revolting to see how much the man revelled in it. John noticed that the tension in Scott’s neck and shoulders were still there as he met the older man’s gaze.
John observed his friend from the side and just laughed whole-heartedly. For a moment, it was as if nothing had happened yesterday, they were just John and Sherlock, watching crappy telly on a weekday evening, enjoying each other’s company. For a moment, John could almost forget what had happened yesterday, that he had been incredibly fearful for the safety of his best friend like never before.
Then he noted the tall, burly man in the corner. He was clad in a black suit and dark sunglasses, his arms were folded casually in front of him, although there was a gun in his hands, too.
John nudged his shoulder playfully with his own. “I will, you git, I’m just trying to remember the right words.”
John’s mood however was ruined and he groaned when he remembered what was next on their schedule as they walked through campus. Clinical medicine. Normally, he liked the subject. But the professor was strict and demanding and he didn’t think he had the mindset for it right now. He was just too diverted by Scott Williams.
Sherlock ignored him and slowly made his way forward. He left his bedroom and staggered towards the bathroom, John right behind him.
Greg came to bid him goodnight at ten o’clock and the lights were turned off, but John didn’t stop his thinking.
“What?” At last, Sherlock turned to him, his mouth twitching, and John could see in his face he was really upset now. “What, John?”
But Sherlock struggled free and scrambled backward on the mattress, away from John.
His cheeks heated in shame, as he proceeded to clean himself between his legs mechanically, stubbornly ignoring his half-hard penis begging for his attention.
He dropped back down on the sofa heavily – the stupid crime show was still on, but he was glad for the background noise as he stared at the ceiling above him, it made his own thoughts not so loud inside his head.
“Hey, Molly, I’d like you to meet someone. This is John Watson, one of my best friends. John, this is Molly Hooper, we have a few seminars together.”
“Would you….”
He brought his hands up to his mouth and blew into them as if he were blowing into a paper bag. He needed to calm down, it wouldn’t do anyone any good if he worked himself up like that in the face of potential danger. If Sherlock was right about this – and he usually was – he was about to confront people involved with human trafficking and murder. He had to have a clear head for that, and he needed to be calm.
“It will be sorted out, John, “came Greg’s voice at last. “Just …. hold on tight, mate, you will get through this. And Sherlock will, too.”
“Is it Sherlock?”
Finally, they arrived at the crime scene – a warehouse in eastern Chelsea, apparently. The place was swarming with policemen. John steeled himself to face a corpse at this early hour when Sherlock jumped out of the cab a few seconds before it even came to a full stop.
Firstly, there was the viciousness with which he had attacked Sherlock’s assaulters. He hadn’t been entirely conscious both of the times to witness it himself, but a broken nose and a concussion on the one hand and a dead woman on the other were quite the remarkable results. He had been surprised to learn of John’s strong reaction to seeing him assaulted. First, he had been appalled and ashamed, that John had seen him in such a weak position, vulnerable in the grip of perverts, helpless.
At last Mycroft reached out and brushed a curl away from his brother’s face. His fingertips lingered on Sherlock’s temple as if he couldn’t decide whether to stroke his head or not. In the end, he just took his hand back again and stood up.
“Scott, “John whispered urgently, but the young Beta only looked at him in disdain, shaking his head then turning back to his notes.
He took the blanket from Sherlock’s chair and gently draped it over his friend’s body. It was still one hour until Mycroft would be back, enough time so that Sherlock could rest a little more. He would not be happy to see his older brother and it would not be an easy conversation. John just hoped that Mycroft would be a little wiser than him and not provoke Sherlock into working himself up into fainting again. He would have to keep an eye on that.
“Sherlock, “he said, grinning back despite himself, but the worried frown replaced the smile at once, “please leave it for me to decide when to fret, alright? Are you sure there’s nothing else? You look terrible, what have they done to you?”
“Hey,” he said as he put on what he hoped was a bright smile that would relax the other bloke. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to work. In fact, it seemed to make him even more suspicious as his expression darkened even further, his mouth tightening impatiently in ever-growing disapproval.
Sherlock cleared his voice, then began, the words flowing off his lips in smooth, flawless rhythm as if they were drops of clear water. “This man was not a happy man. He’s slender but unfit, body fat has increased over the past few months, the muscles in his arms and legs are weak he used to work out before but not so much, probably got depressed after the divorce, his nails are yellow, a clear sign he was a chain smoker, there also signs that his cuticles were bitten at in regular intervals, he was nervous as well as unhappy. There’s a smear of lipstick on the side of his neck, it’s really small but it’s enough to tell me he has been with a woman before he died. Well, he was still unhappy, so it is unlikely he has a new girlfriend, so what else could it have been?”
He was observing the scene in front of them calmly, but Sherlock was sure he was ready to jump in the second it was necessary. The lady was the boss and he was hers to command.
All he knew was that he was confused and that he needed to clear this tension between them. He couldn’t bear for all these questions to be left unanswered for much longer.
“Oh, I’ve never been as sure in my life, “he said with conviction.
In a sudden surge of rage he couldn’t control he leaned down and grabbed the woman’s collar with both hands, pulling her up and shaking her violently as if she weighed nothing. “What have you done to him?! What kind of a sick person are you?!”
Still, this was bloody insane.
This whole situation had been far too strange and surreal for him. He didn’t like being in such situations he couldn’t completely understand so he had decided there and then to just focus on his studies, instead of wasting his time thinking about handsome young Alphas with kind warm smiles and too much courage for their own good.
John nodded angrily in agreement. This wasn’t right. What was wrong with this professor? He gritted his teeth as he decided that he would do something about this. He would go to the dean, he would let him know that one of their professors was treating students inhumanely, he would…
They made their way downwards and found two seats next to each other in the fourth row on the left side. It’s not where they would usually choose to sit. John didn’t like to sit too close to the front, that’s where the swots and bootlickers were sitting. But beggars couldn’t be choosers, so he swallowed his pride and took his seat. On the way down he saw several familiar faces and smiled or nodded at them, even if none of them were close friends. In the corner of his eye, he saw Sarah Sawyer, a red-haired Beta girl he was loosely befriended with. She shot him a shy smile as he passed her seat.
The last sentence was addressed at Mycroft, with an accusing tone and a stern face.
important business.” Mycroft’s voice was calm and had only a trace of irritation in it.
“Ts ts, don’t do that.” He lifted Sherlock’s head up from the pavement with the left hand and stroked over his freshly bruised cheek with his right thumb. “Don’t ruin your beautiful face, “he mumbled, leaning forward a little more and now his lips were only inches away from Sherlock’s face. “I still need it.”
Mycroft was muttering something under his breath now and John couldn’t really make out the words, but he was pretty sure he heard “imbeciles” and “only sane person here”. After a few seconds, Mycroft recovered swiftly.
Then everything started to blur again, as the colours faded to a dull grey. Sherlock knew what that meant. His transport was getting tired, so tired that his mind wasn’t able to work effectively anymore for long. He would have to leave his mind palace soon in order to get some rest.
Greg appeared next to them. He was pale and he looked distressed.
“Kiss me, “she whispered, and then she surged forward, pushing her mouth onto his.
He looked at Greg with a mixture of fear and anger: “He was hurt, Greg.”
knew everything about everyone.
She turned to John then. “Doctor Watson, I’m still a little worried about Mr. Holmes’ shoulder. As of now, the infection seems very mild, but I’d like you to keep a close eye on it. After last night it could very well worsen.”
The next few days went a little better. He told himself to pull himself together and pay attention if he wanted to get a good start on this semester’s courses and so he did. He diligently took notes of what he had to do in order to pass the courses. He signed up for a few presentations and essays and he even agreed to take part in a study group for one of the more difficult anatomy courses he had to pass this semester.
“Thank you, “he said sincerely, indicating Sherlock’s empty plate with his fork.
But before he could voice more doubts and dissuade himself from entering Sherlock’s room, a sound came from within the room and John moved without hesitation because there was hurt in Sherlock’s voice and his body reacted to that sound like a moth to a flame, he couldn’t have stayed put if his own life depended on it.
“I’ve searched all over for you, John, you worried me!” The strange but also familiar voice sounded somewhere over his head.
When the alarm sounded, he startled awake, feeling as if he had only closed his eyes a minute ago. Yawning, he got off the couch and at once made his way to Sherlock’s bedroom. His friend was still asleep but apparently in the middle of a nightmare because he was tossing and turning from side to side, sweat dripping down his face and he was whimpering quietly.
It was true. He knew that John was right. Of course, John was always right. Well, most of the time, at least.
John chuckled as he remembered the not-so-rare occasions when Sherlock had simply collapsed in their living room after a solved case and he and Mrs. Hudson had to half-drag, half-carry him to his bed where he had slept for up to twenty hours. Maybe he would get to witness that again tonight, to be honest, he wouldn’t mind, he could always use a good laugh.
He relaxed immediately when he saw the familiar Belstaff hanging on the rack, Sherlock’s favourite blue scarf wrapped around its collar. It was all good.
“Well, thanks for helping John here, I appreciate it, “he heard the man say, followed by a friendly “No problem, mate” from the nice waiter bloke and then they suddenly moved, or more precisely he was moved by the other man’s arms towards the pub’s exit.
After another quick glance at the door he started perusing the documents. After having looked at just a few pages his lips curled into a triumphant smirk.
His eyes lit up as he realized what was in front of him. He put his thumb on the right nipple of the Asian woman and pushed – sure enough there was an unmistakable sound behind him, indicating a mechanism had opened up somewhere. He rolled his eyes as he put the figurine back onto the shelf.
“Leave him be!”
The man on the other line was blabbering away again and he listened for another fifteen seconds, pushing a pencil into the blank paper on his desk until it penetrated the thin surface, breaking the pencil as he crushed it in his hand.
Finally snapping out of his frozen state, Sherlock quickly got up off the floor, straightening his back as he met the older man’s curious stare.
“I don’t owe you anything, alright?” John paused. “But alright, I’ll answer you, if you insist.”
“Well, he came out in the middle of the night and curled up on the couch. He settled into position and then he was just …. gone. The older Mr. Holmes told me what that is, it’s called …. a mind palace, I think? Well, he went there, and he didn’t move until nine in the morning. A colleague was here, so I could sleep a little and she told me that he hadn’t moved while I was sleeping either. She left and I made breakfast. I had to shake him awake and he was really startled when I did that. He ate his breakfast without any motivation whatsoever, and he let me look at his wound again, but he seemed …. I don’t know, completely shut down. As if he didn’t care. It was a little as if he were sleepwalking. He ate, he moved, he spoke, but almost as if he weren’t really alive. I must admit, I was scared a little.”
He grabbed some bandages, a thermometer, as well as a small bowl with warm water, and two clean cloths. From the fridge, he grabbed a small bottle of water. This took him just over forty seconds and he almost stumbled in his haste to get back to Sherlock.
While factors laid our cottages bare
“Ah, here we go again,” Dimmock chimed in, rolling his eyes dramatically, “You’re really infatuated with him, aren’t you? Strange, really, to fall in love with that annoying freak.”
John couldn’t contain the smirk creeping upon his lips. This was so Sherlock, throwing little tantrums like a small child instead of a fully grown man. It was a little cute, too. He felt warmth spreading out in his chest as he cherished the sense of familiarity of their routine: the bickering, the theatrical moaning, and him trying to tone his friend and colleague down. This was their thing. Well, this time was under different circumstances though. He lost the smile at that last thought.
“You cannot be serious!”
He felt he would go mad if he didn’t find an answer now.
For a split second he wanted to hit Sherlock.
For a split second he felt betrayed.
“How come, Mr. Holmes, “she growled as her hand darted forward to grab his knee, causing him to flinch involuntarily, “how come you’re breaking into my establishment, breaking into my offices and stealing information from me?” Her face shifted nearer to his and because he didn’t budge an inch, he could now see the wrinkles she didn’t want anybody to see.
“Get out, quick!” Greg shouted at his fellow officer with some difficulty and he jerked his head towards the door.
“It was me.”
“Yeah, yeah, “Sherlock didn’t look back and made an impatient gesture with his hand.
He nodded so she got up from the bed and left the room, not without caressing Sherlock’s cheek tenderly before.
They had been best friends from the very first day.
His hackles rose however when he recognized Victor and Sebastian standing at the start of the queue, immediately feeling his inner Alpha soar and he swallowed his anger down. It wouldn’t be very prudent to growl at fellow students, probably only resulting in him getting thrown out.
Sherlock nodded again, his eyes squeezing shut as the tiny movement seemed to cause him pain. John nodded, more to himself than to the man in his arms, then he carefully laid Sherlock down onto the sheet, disentangling him from his arms.
He was tall and thin, elegantly clad in a beige three-piece suit, as he stepped to the front desk where he left his expensive-looking briefcase, his eyes roaming over the large lecture room, taking in the various student’s faces. He seemed to be maybe fifty years old, probably a little older. His piercing blue eyes were shark-like as they scrutinized one face after the other through frameless glasses and John and Mike looked at each other warily. The way the professor looked at them was almost unsettling and John thought that there had probably never been a teacher he had taken a disliking to so quickly.
That night, John lay awake again, staring at the ceiling. He was deeply impressed by everything Molly had told him and he was still astonished that he had never known about the lives of so many people in this world, even if they were the minority in contrast to Alphas and Betas. A small voice inside his mind told him that Scott was right: he was a selfish, entitled Alpha. If he weren’t he would have bothered catching up on current Omega laws.
“Yes, John. Of course, John, whatever you say, John, “he replied in a flat, monotonous voice.
The next multi-chaptered WIP is already planned and outlined, I have started writing the first two chapters and will be posting them after the two short stories. I'm actually dipping my toe into Omegaverse, something I never would have thought likely just a couple of months ago. But since then I have read dozens of ABO-stories (with Omega Sherlock of course) and found myself loving most of them. It's just something that makes sense when you like a vulnerable Sherlock. I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but I didn't know I liked it until I've tried it. Would love to see you around!
“I hated losing myself like that, John.”
But truthfully, he didn’t think that it would be that simple. Scott didn’t seem like a person who would forget as easily as Mike thought. It was obvious to John that the young Beta student wasn’t like other people. Amongst other things, he was clearly extremely intelligent and very attentive, and surely that would include remembering every detail of the dreadful conversation with an obnoxious arrogant Alpha who couldn’t keep his hands to himself.
He turned off the lights and swore to himself that he would not think of Scott again for the whole weekend.
“Yes, and what are you getting out of it?” Sherlock took another step forward, watching as John Watson’s eyebrow twitched at the sudden closeness. “Possibly ruining your reputation in front of the Professor, having to pay for that expensive microscope... you cannot expect me you took all that on you just because you’re such a nice bloke! No, I don’t want to hear your stupid excuses”, he added, cutting off another attempt of John to speak.
His eyes closed as something akin to hurt curled up in the pit of his stomach when he remembered the words his best friend had hurled at him at the hospital. The way his face had twisted with anger and frustration. At him, Sherlock, because he was the way he was.
They went outside to the terrace. There were a few people there, smoking and talking, but it was much quieter than inside the auditorium and they would be able to hear each other much better. Sipping their drinks, they slowly wandered towards the little Chinese garden in the back, walking side by side.
“J-Jooohn, “was the last thing Sherlock whispered after a few minutes of silent fidgeting. Then he was quiet, though his body continued to tremble. John pulled him closer to his own body to give him more comfort and it seemed to help. Sherlock’s breathing slowed down and eventually, he was completely still. He had finally fallen asleep.
John looked up to see Sherlock staring at the wall, lost in that moment where he had not been in control.
John inwardly smiled to himself as he pictured the way Sherlock liked to throw himself on their couch when he wanted to make a point, curling into himself, facing away from whoever had offended him – it was just so unbelievably adorable.
He got him back into bed. Sherlock almost fell asleep again while John gingerly moved him to get him into a fresh shirt and sweatpants. The thermometer announced a temperature of 38.7° and a quick check of his pulse told him that his heart rate was close to normal. John sighed in relief. He would still have to monitor Sherlock closely which meant that he would not sleep again tonight, but he had a good feeling that they were out of the wood now. He managed to get Sherlock to drink half a glass of water and then he settled him back down against the pillow.
Attending the first practice of Durham’s rugby team late Friday afternoon helped a lot. As soon as he started warming up with the other blokes, running a few laps, stretching his limbs, he felt the anticipation he always felt when he was on the field. When he tackled a teammate for the first time, both of them falling to the ground in laughter, the familiar feeling of the surge of adrenaline kicking in, he felt free and young and he forgot about everything else. He trained hard, pushing himself to his limit, and almost didn’t feel his shoulder afterwards. When his teammates decided to go into town for a few drinks he didn’t hesitate and went with them.
From the ray of light shining through a crack between the curtains on his bedroom windows, he could tell it was already late in the afternoon.
“No!” John’s hand shot out and just barely got a hold of Sherlock’s before it was out of his reach. “It’s alright!”
Sherlock nodded again. His expression was calm, but John thought he saw a flash of fear in the detective’s eyes.
“When I saw you at the hospital. Two days ago. You had just fallen asleep and this kind nurse had pushed another bed next to yours. I was looking at you while you were asleep. You looked so….so utterly beautiful, Sherlock, I couldn’t take my eyes off you. But it wasn’t only your beauty. You had gone through so much, had to endure these horrible people doing horrible things to you. And yet, you always stayed strong. You refused to be brought down by these people. You still wanted to defy the world. And that’s when I realized, Sherlock.”
As she touched him, Sherlock flinched violently and tried to get away from her touch at once, making him push backwards against John’s chest. “N-noooo, please, noooo ….” And he sobbed again, shaking his head frantically.
John’s lips curled up all by themselves and he opened his eyes with a grin.
Her expression saddened. “Yeah, I know. It’s a shame…” She shook her head before her pretty smile re-appeared on her lips. “So, what do you wanna talk about?”
to being touched like that – so he quickly withdrew his hand as soon as he realized that, feeling guilty. Instead, he laid his hand on Sherlock’s slender arm. That was more neutral, and he settled back into a comfortable position.
“You too, Sherlock.”
Without further ado, John let go of the unconscious man, stepped to the edge of the boat, and dived into the water headfirst. Thankfully, it was only September, so the water wasn’t too cold, although it was cold enough to momentarily take his breath away.
Sherlock didn’t move a muscle. “Sure, John, fine, “he answered, his voice steady but also quiet.
He revisited a few places he and John had frequented, cases they had solved together: the foggy woods in Dartmoor, and the sterile laboratories of Baskerville. The swimming pool. Buckingham Palace. The morgue at Barts.
He was looking at him now, his body in fight-or-flight mode, wary, his eyes flicking over John’s tense form as if he expected him to attack any second now. It made John feel ashamed of himself.
“Uh, I don’t think so,” John said with a shrug. “In fact, I’m leaving. You coming with?”
With grim determination, John grabbed Sherlock’s slack form. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, and his skin already had a ghostly pallor. He needed to act quickly. Because he knew that Sherlock had already been without oxygen for quite some time and it would take even more time to get him to the surface, he decided that he needed to give him something right now, or he wouldn’t make it.
But maybe he would show some compassion when he saw how weak Sherlock was. Maybe he would not press things and he could find another way to get that arsehole convicted. John sighed wearily. He just didn’t know what was right at this moment.
John huffed, shaking his head. “You’re gonna have to do better than that.”
“What?” Greg looked at him in disbelief. “You were away for a whole hour!”
A huge wave of relief washed over him then and he let out a deep breath he didn’t know he had been holding in. A small smile crept upon his lips.
Having been completely drawn in by Scott’s lengthy and incredible account of what was most of his life in that deep, gravelly voice of his - mesmerizing him, pulling him in, as if he were a creature of the deep sea - he was startled at the sudden silence, unprepared to be addressed out of the blue. He could see the impatience in Scott’s eyes as he waited for his reaction. There was apprehension in his pale features, something that John certainly did not understand.
But because Sherlock still seemed confused and disoriented John took a step back. It wouldn’t do to confuse his friend even more.
Someone pushed a bottle of beer into his hand and they took to a corner of the room, observing the writhing mass of dancing people, chatting casually.
“I still need that statement from him, John, “he said, looking sorry for even saying it.
“You’re going to regret that, Williams, “he growled as he took a step towards Scott, crashing into John in the process. Scott however, scoffed from where he stood behind John.
John seemed nervous, too, as his Adam’s apple bobbed, his bright blue eyes flitting from Sherlock’s face to the ground and back again. At long last, the thermometer beeped and the eye contact broke.
He had met her a few years ago when he had been introduced to Susanna as a silent business partner. Never had he met a woman so ruthless and so inspiringly interesting like her. She had managed to spice up his rather boring business life and he had immensely enjoyed the first few months of their hot, messy affair which evolved into something surprisingly different. He rose high in the ranks at the same time that she did.  A business partnership in which both of them were equals, he respected her and she respected him. They maybe didn’t trust each other, but they valued and admired each other.
The conversation had been very strange, and Sherlock saw the confusion in his own eyes, saw the wheels turning inside his head as he suddenly came to the realization that John seemed to have just shown his interest in him. He had tried to explain to him that he was married to his work and John had replied that he didn’t mean it like that, and things had been a little uncomfortable after that, even Sherlock had sensed it.
Okay, this had to stop. There were endless possibilities of what could have happened to his friend and John couldn’t bear thinking about it any longer – he needed to go and find out himself. Having made that decision, he got up from his chair at once.
Flexing his fingers nervously, he mustered up his courage, took the last few steps up, and opened the door tentatively.
“Which means the killer is a good and experienced marksman, “Sherlock deduced next to him. “And he is cold-blooded. This was no emotional crime, this was a deed to shut someone up, to get him out of the way.”
“Listen to me, Sherlock. You...you’ve been through a lot. You’ve been touched without your consent. You’ve been drugged and assaulted. Twice. That’s a lot to deal with. Please. Even if you don’t want to talk about it yet, you must realize that it has an affect on you. Do you realize it?”
He had never seen John with a man though. John seemed very averse to the thought of being with another man, or at least he seemed averse to the thought of people thinking of him as gay.
“Are you serious? I told you to be careful!” Magnussen bellowed. “Do you know what a microscope like this costs? Are you all idiots? Who is responsible for this mess?”
He had also loved her, he guessed, at least in some kind of possessive, all-consuming way. The way that would probably have led to utter chaos and destruction some time sooner or later, but that didn’t matter anymore.
“I believe Scott has asked you to leave him alone. So leave him be, “he said, his voice dropping in increasing anger.
Or not, because who knew if they were going to survive the night?
“I called to tell you to hang on. My barristers are working on your case and the odds look promising. I cannot guarantee it, but I think chances are you’ll be released from prison sometime tomorrow, all charges against you dropped.”
Deciding that he really had to leave now, he looked once more around the room, careful to leave everything the way it had been, and then left. The floor looked the same and there was still light emanating from under the door on the other side. He couldn’t hear any voices though. He crouched down again and very softly made his way over to the other side. But just as he reached the staircase, he heard a noise behind him. Alarmed, he turned around but before he could see anything pain exploded in his head and his world went black.
“Drink.”
He bit his lip as he turned off the now-tepid water. He needed to test his theory. He needed to make sure.
to see Scott smile like that.
“I’ll be back in a second. “John jogged up the stairs to his bedroom to very quickly dress himself.
But Sherlock’s eyes closed, and his body went limp in John’s arms.
No. Even if he was truly being acquitted of all charges, even if Sherlock’s remaining tormentor was put away, unable to harm him anymore, Sherlock was far from fine. The usually so haughty, condescending detective who had always been able to reduce people to blubbering, stammering messes in the face of his often cruel albeit correct deductions, was now nothing more than a simple human being that had gone through a terrible ordeal.
“You see Mrs. Hudson, the drug was in the fog and there were pressure pads on the ground so that everyone going to that very spot in the forest would experience these hallucinations”, Sherlock was just saying as he danced around the room still clad in his Belstaff, waving his hands around to emphasize the dramatics of the whole thing.
Last but not least there was arousal, and that was the one that irritated John the most. He was ready to accept that he and Sherlock were best friends now but that? That could not be happening, because he was not gay, had never engaged in intimate acts of any kind with a man and why would someone like Sherlock Holmes cause him to even think about doing anything like...well, that? The man didn’t seem interested in sexual – or romantic – relationships at all. John had never seen him with anyone, man or woman, and after their first awkward conversation at Angelo’s –
John Watson had turned out not been one of those many people and Sherlock’s throat tightened when he saw those warm blue eyes lighting up with every word he said.
“D-don’t, “he whispered hoarsely.
He opened his eyes, ready to leave the uncomfortable situation he had just gone through behind and get on to his next class, when he suddenly realized that someone was standing right in front of him, blocking his view to the corridor. Simultaneously he became aware of a strong scent of matured whiskey permeating the air around him and he looked up in a frown at the unexpected intrusion.
Sherlock seemed surprised. “Really? You don’t need to do that.”
He scrambled up from the couch so hastily he almost landed on the floor and he made his way downstairs to their landlady’s door, knocking on it with barely contained impatience as well as anger rising within him.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Victor and Sebastian smirk at each other and he was a second away from stepping forward, to tell the truth when he stopped himself. It was a lost cause. Magnussen had made no secret out of the fact that he liked the two Alphas and he would never believe John if he told them who was really responsible.
“John. She’s not worth it, stop it.” Greg said in a surprisingly kind and patient tone. “Look after Sherlock, he needs you now.”
“I’m John, “he said spontaneously and snickered at once when he realized he had used his friend’s name by accident in order to hide his personality. He had to tell John later, he’d find that funny, too.
Sherlock, however, looked askance.
“I’m sorry for yelling at you, I’m sorry, “John whispered as he held his friend in his arms. “Please come around, I’ll stop yelling, I promise.”
John’s whole body tensed, a low growl escaping his throat as he stepped forward, ready to attack the officer at the next wrong word. Dimmock stood up and grinned at John lazily as if challenging him to attack. John was so incredibly angry, he nearly lost it right then.
But he was at a loss for words and he was feeling slightly nauseous with helplessness.
The Alpha’s eyes narrowed.
John swallowed heavily. He took Sherlock’s hands into his as he tried to find the right words in his mind to explain to Sherlock what had happened to him. But he just couldn’t form any coherent sentence which resulted in him sitting there opening and closing his mouth silently like a bloody damn fish.
He made puppy eyes at his best friend. “Please, Stamford. I really need to go out tonight.”
A content smile crept up John’s face as he heard someone shout their names, footsteps approaching fast.
At some point, Sherlock found himself drifting away. He tried to force his eyes to stay open because he wanted to hear the rest of it, too. But it was useless, oblivion was already pulling him back into its heavenly realm and he was floating, floating away, weightless in empty, endless space. John’s voice accompanied him on his way, the smooth honey-like sound cushioning him, easing his way, until it too, was gone.
John sighed. Sherlock was so stubborn, and he was also obsessively immature when it came to his brother – that also applied to Mycroft. Those two would always indulge in their little games of power play, teasing and mocking each other childishly without realizing they really cared for each other. It was tiresome but John didn’t know how he could convince Sherlock of Mycroft’s sincere feelings for him. Besides, he heavily suspected Mycroft didn’t want his brother to know of these feelings if he even was really aware of them himself. This wasn’t the time to do take care of this delicate matter anyway, it was more important now that Sherlock got his rest. When this thing was over and done with, maybe he could bring up their relationship again.
A few minutes later, the door to the lab opened and two older students, Magnussen’s assistants, beckoned them all in. One after the other, they were given a lab coat, nitrile gloves, as well as safety goggles. Professor Magnussen was waiting at the back of the room, watching them get their equipment with his arms crossed in front of his chest, his lips pressed into a tight line. His presence was taking up the whole room, impatience and condescendence rolling off of him naturally. It caused the muscles in John’s face to tense as he fought down the urge to scowl at the unfriendly Alpha - the unpleasant memory of how the Professor had taken his pleasure threatening and belittling Scott in class last week still fresh in his mind.
She looked surprised, obviously touched by his consideration of her personal situation. “It’s no problem at all, “she assured him, “Tom trusts me and he is a very understanding Alpha. If he weren’t, I wouldn’t be here. And he’s not here, by the way, he’s at home, working.”
There was the sound of hard breathing and then the sound of a zipper being pulled down. John hesitated once again. He didn’t want to disturb these people, maybe they were just into some kinky stuff … but instinct told him to go on.
Greg noticed Sherlock’s hesitance as well and he leaned forward. “Sherlock, this is important. You don’t want that bastard to walk away free from this, do you? He deserves to go to prison for what he did you, that sick piece of filth.” Greg’s emotions finally seeped through and John spontaneously thought that it was probably prohibited that he filed these charges because he knew Sherlock and was biased. But that wasn’t important right now, what was important was that that monster who had attacked Sherlock was getting his comeuppance.
I know nothing of medical procedures, so everything I've used here is the result of simple Internet research. So there may be mistakes in that area, sorry if that is the case.
? He was always dating such boring women,
“About what?”
It made him feel queasy, being so close to this older Alpha and his woody whiskey scent. It reminded him too much of the moment between them, just a mere fifteen minutes ago when Magnussen had yelled at him like a madman. Sherlock was proud to call himself a strong independent person who did not cower away in the face of a conflict - but this particular situation had taken him completely by surprise: he had seen how Sebastian had shoved the microscope off the table and had at once recognized the rejected Alpha’s plans to take revenge on him. When Magnussen, a tall, older Alpha had suddenly stood in front of him, his eyes bulging in his fury, his raised flat hand an unspoken visible threat, he had found himself, unable to say or do anything, completely shell-shocked at the extreme fury suddenly directed at him. In retrospect, he hated himself for his pathetic passiveness but his nature had gotten the better of him that moment, leaving him a helpless recipient of excessive Alpha rage.
She stepped around him to stand in front of him again. Then she crouched down so that they were face to face. He felt her hot breath on his lips, smelled her expensive flowery perfume and he forced himself not to draw back, although he really wanted to.
“I can take him home.”
“Thanks.” Sherlock shot John a grateful look and moved to get off the bed to search for some fresh clothes when a soft, warm hand on his bare arm stopped him. Surprised, he looked up, into John’s worried face.
“What about the perpetrator”? was Mycroft’s next question and Greg filled him on in the man’s condition. Mycroft seemed to muse a little then he looked at Greg and said: “Inspector Lestrade, please don’t worry about charges against Dr. Watson here. There won’t be any.”
7 o'clock. A bar in the city where they were supposed to have amazing burgers which John suddenly craved.
There was, first of all, irritation, because no normal person could not get irritated when living with someone like Sherlock Holmes. No normal person would get used to the body parts in the fridge, the violin playing at three o’clock in the morning, the constant failure of your flatmate doing the cleaning, the shopping, or anything at all in the means of household chores, ever.
Suddenly it was quiet, and John just stood there next to Sherlock’s bed, just staring at the ground.
There was anger, of course, most of all because of all the brazen insults hurled at him by his arrogant tosser of a flatmate. His mind was dreadfully simple,
?” Sherlock looked up at the Inspector. “Could we please make it quick, I have quite the headache.”
“But...how?”
“Don’t move! Hands up!” Greg yelled and the man complied at once. The gun which had fallen out of his hands was kicked away by Greg who then quickly proceeded to handcuff the man. Then he took out a handkerchief and made a tourniquet around the wound with it, to stop the bleeding.
Sherlock quickly uncurled himself from his position on the bed and nearly jumped off the bed. “I’m fine, “he said eagerly, “I’d like to leave.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at that and let himself fall into the appointed chair in defeat.
He had nearly fallen off the sofa, rumpled from sleeping in his clothes from yesterday. He was alarmed to see Sherlock standing over him, already dressed in a white dress shirt and black trousers, looking at him expectantly.
“Here.” John’s palm opened and there was a small white pill. Realizing what was expected of him and desperate for some relief from the terrible pain in his head, Sherlock opened his mouth willingly, refusing to let the feeling of helplessness get to him. His being as an invalid was only temporary, what did it matter?
“Well, I should say, Mycroft, didn’t you tell me we were under surveillance? How could this happen, how could he just leave our flat and not be stopped or at least followed by one of your people?”
He then remembered something about date-rape drugs. In most cases, the victims didn’t remember what had happened to them. Or if they did, they only remembered fractions and bits. That’s why it was so important to gather evidence to eventually convict the perpetrator.
Normally, when he was on a case, he was used to acting on a hypothesis. He collected facts and figures, formed theories based on these facts, erased theories that couldn’t be, singling out the ones that could.
Naked terror washed over Sherlock like a tidal wave.
“No.” Sherlock still hadn’t moved.
The dream-memory faded and changed into something else.
But at the end of that first day, John found himself returning to his room with a churning stomach, and he lay down on his bed, a feeling of gloom and disappointment descending down on him. The unusual feeling of discontent at the very first day of Uni left him in a state of nervous uneasiness and he pulled his wireless headphones over his ears, trying to drown out his thoughts in random Punk music and succeeding to do so half-way.
“Hey, hey, careful there!” A voice from somewhere next to him exclaimed.
“Pillock.” There was no severity to his insult and Sherlock’s eyes twinkled.
John stirred and Sherlock held his breath as he stayed completely still, unwilling to let their casual closeness come to an end. Then there were strong hands on his shoulders, pushing him back gently. John shifted so that his face was on the same level as Sherlock’s, surprise lighting up his face when he saw that Sherlock wasn’t asleep.
Because before, he had looked better than this. Now, his skin was sallow, even paler than usual, which didn’t make him look healthy at all. There were deep dark circles underneath his eyes, giving him the look of someone who hadn’t slept in days, even though he had slept impossibly long. His lip was still split from where that vile man had bitten into it and he winced at the unbidden memory.
Somehow, the ‘sentiment is a chemical defect’ – thing had never really applied when it came to John.
“Come to bed with me?”
“It won’t …. Jesus!”
“J-John, I- I cannt, I juscannnt….” The words out of Sherlock's mouth slurred so badly he could hardly comprehend them. The drug in his system was taking its effect on him more clearly now.
Back in the laboratory, he had seen that Scott was staring after him as he left the room and he had resisted the urge to stop and address the Beta again. If Scott wanted to talk to him, he could. But he would have to be the one to initiate a conversation this time because John refused to be snapped at yet again.
“Whoa, what you’re doing, darling?” he heard a rough voice above him, sounding amused, “trying to hurt yourself?”
Greg shrugged. “Yeah and that’s what’s going to happen now. They are going to ask you a few questions.”
Mycroft threw a glance in John’s direction, silently asking him if he hadn’t warned Sherlock of his visit and John shrugged helplessly, indicating that there hadn’t been a chance to do so. Greg was watching them all in a daze of fascination as if he didn’t have a clue of what was going on.
Sae smile in your sleep, bonnie baby
Stupid. John was right. He was an idiot. Useless. Only exasperating everyone around him, like Mycroft had said.
Anything else was bad for business after all.
As Sherlock was rushing through his deductions, John’s belly filled with a warm, fuzzy feeling and he felt a wave of fondness wash over him. How could anybody be such an arrogant, nosy bastard but so endearing at the same time? At the same time, he got lost at the look of Sherlock’s lips, moving rapidly through the monologue.
“Hm, yes, he wasn’t exactly but I managed to convince him. He could barely hold himself upright.”
Someone was calling him, but he didn’t care.
John froze.
“Yes?” he whispered. “But that’s perfect, Sherlock, that’s all I ask. All I ask that you try to be more careful, so what would be so wrong about that?”
Maybe he would do that now. Going through memories, deleting stuff – that calmed him down and God knew he could need that right now. He also briefly considered trying to find a way to help get John out of prison, but he quickly thought better of it. He was too upset to think about that right now. Just thinking about his best friend alone and desperate in a depressing prison cell made his heart race in anxiety, he could feel it faintly as his mind briefly connected with its transport.
“Yeah, we do.”
Mike seemed reluctant but after another look from John, he shrugged and walked towards the cafeteria, knowing that there was no way to dissuade his stubborn Alpha friend from what he wanted to do.
Without further ado, John rushed to the bathroom. Inside, he cautiously laid Sherlock onto the ground and then proceeded to turn on the shower. He quickly stripped down to his pants and held out his hand to test the water’s temperature. It needed to be tepid, anything else wouldn’t do.
“John.” A smile spread over Sherlock’s face, it was good to hear his friend’s voice, it immediately calmed him down.
“Because I’m interested in the topic, “Scott said, the irritation returning to his voice. ”You know … I feel like I’m being subjected to an interrogation I didn’t agree to. I’m not in the mood for a game of twenty-one questions.”
Sherlock snorted. “Yeah, right.”
“Where did he touch you, can you recall that?”
“Are you alright?” he asked quietly as he tried to gauge the other man’s mood. He seemed alright, if not a little upset and vulnerable. Just a bit like he felt at this moment. He felt as if he was bursting on the inside, exultation and disbelief and shock battling for dominance within him and he was only barely managing to keep them bottled inside. Sherlock needed him to be calm now, so he forced himself to stay still, even though it took him all his willpower to accomplish it.
He suddenly grabbed Sherlock by the hips, gripping into his flesh brutally with his fingers. It hurt and Sherlock’s body surged upwards, his eyes pressed shut in pain.  He fumbled at the hands hurting him, trying desperately to get them off. He failed and his head fell back helplessly, a strangled sob escaping his throat.
“I can see that you don’t want to eat. You probably think you’re not hungry.” John raised his other hand, stopping Sherlock before he could protest. “You might not feel it, but your body is probably starving. You haven’t eaten properly in days. Mycroft’s assistant has told me you have barely eaten anything while you were in his care. I know you haven’t eaten anything substantial before then. I can only repeat myself, try to get through to you. Sherlock, your body has been through a lot and after the fever you’ve suffered, it desperately needs nutrition. Please try to understand. I don’t want to force you. I’m just asking you to consider this. For me.”
He pulled out his phone to call Sherlock but of course, he didn’t answer. Then he called Greg to ask if he had heard from the detective, but he hadn’t heard from him – obviously, he had faked calling the Inspector in front of John.
It was an interesting image to think about and the time passed as they both turned their focus on their now poisoned sample, scribbling down notes as they took turns at the microscope.
For a long time, they just lay there together in the darkness, the room slightly illuminated by the light of the moon shining through the window. John’s pulse was still a little elevated and he closed his eyes, trying to calm himself down. He tried to concentrate on his friend’s body next to him, curled into him, seeking warmth and comfort from him. He softly pressed a kiss into the damp messy curls and closed his eyes, stroking Sherlock’s head.
Just as he had figured that out a bloodcurdling scream filled the air. John flinched so hard, he nearly collapsed on the spot from terror. He looked and saw what made his best friend scream like that: His attacker was biting him. He was biting him into the shoulder
“Apology accepted, “Scott muttered quietly, sounding a little embarrassed, and John sighed in relief. His smile turned into a frown when Scott turned away again without preamble, obviously aiming to walk away from him once again.
He didn’t need anything else.
Then there were pictures he couldn’t remember very well.
He started to nibble at his toast and John tried not to look too smug, failing miserably. To appease his friend he pointed at the tea bags on the tray. “Which one do you want? We have orange pekoe, Darjeeling, peppermint and uhm …. earl grey.”
“Mrs. Hudson, could you do me a favour? Would you look after Sherlock while I talk with the Inspector here? Just make sure he’s breathing normally, alright?”
So, I really don't know where that argument came from ...totally surprised me :)
“Tell me, what is my name, my rank, my birthday, my favourite colour.”
The man stopped in his tracks and leaned down to push his face right into Sherlock’s while he still supported his weight on his arms and shoulder. “Ah, now you remember me, huh? Took you a while. What, you’re not feeling alright? Pity.”
“Really, John, “Greg said with a smirk, “you must enlighten me sometime how you do it. Make the rich guys do that little wave with their hands so everything just lands in your lap.”
“But it’s not, Sherlock! It really isn’t!” John was working himself up again and he clenched his hands into fists at his side, as he started pacing the sitting room, trying to keep his temper in check. “I’ve overstepped the line. Obviously, we should have had a real talk a long time before that conversation. I’m sorry that all of that just burst out of me and at such an impossible time, too. It’s unforgivable.”
John caught Sherlock’s gaze as his eyes roamed over the deep shadows that ran alongside the trees high above their heads. Sherlock winked at him then – utter, arrogant cock that he was, and the corners of John’s lips automatically curled upwards, as if that motion were imprinted into the muscles of his mouth, a reflex in his brain that just couldn’t be turned off.
John stumbled forwards, stepping over the bleeding woman on the floor who was desperately pushing her hands against her throat, trying to keep the blood in her body, trying to breathe.
A few meters away from them, there was a room which they could see into because there was no door. There was a woman standing there, her back to them and she was doubled over, panting heavily, spitting blood onto the ground. There was someone else he couldn’t quite see because she was in the way, someone sitting on a chair in front of her.
“Oh God, yes. More than anything in the world.”
John nodded at her gratefully and made his way over to the counter. It took a while until he had young Ben’s attention because there were other people ordering drinks but eventually, he managed to get the bloke's attention.
John to be there.
But gratitude apparently was a foreign word to Scott. He seemed to be quite immature, as well as unforgiving. Now that he thought about it, the way Scott had told him he was ‘lacking finances’, the kid seemed to be quite the opposite: his clothes were almost immaculate and seemed very expensive. His shoes, his bag, the products he obviously put in his hair - everything seemed to be of the finest quality, and the way Scott talked indicated a public school education too. Quite the posh, arrogant boy he had chosen to have a crush on.
“Correct.” Magnussen’s tone was appreciative, as he continued to appraise the student in front of him. The students in the room were getting restless, John noticed. This seemed unnecessarily cruel. The professor obviously seemed to have it in for the kid.
The three-storey building was dark when Sherlock finally arrived at the right address. That is, except for a few lights in the middle storey, indicating that a few people were still inside. Sherlock looked at his watch: it was 6 o’clock. Most people would have called it a day now – those that were working normal office hours would, for that matter. But this was a highly distinguished escort agency. There were bound to be people in need of a little human contact at the end of the day and thus there was a need for employees answering the phone to arrange meetings.
The Alpha’s eyes widened when he realized who had shouted his name. A small smile flitted across his tanned face but disappeared quickly and was hastily replaced by a neutral expression. His mouth tightened and he pulled his shoulders back, his whole posture signifying an air of defiance but Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder about the meaning of that hidden smile from before.
John was incredibly tired so he decided he should better take the opportunity and catch some sleep as well. He wanted to be near Sherlock though in case he needed his help, so he decided to nap on the sofa. With the alarm set for two hours, he settled down with the blanket thrown over himself and fell asleep in a matter of seconds.
“John?” Mrs. Hudson looked at him in confusion. “What is it, dear, you don’t look too well.”
Suddenly, he needed to make sure he was okay. After everything that had happened the past few days, John was unable to trust the peace and quiet. It felt almost surreal, lying here on the sofa, safe and sound, with no blaring sirens, no interfering Mycroft, no bickering Sherlock.
“R-really?”
“Right. Okay. You’re unattached, like me. Fine. Good.”
Greg truly looked sorry and John shook his head. “Don’t apologize, Greg. I know you’re on my side.” He locked eyes with his friend. “I’m really thankful, you know? I know this must be hard for you, too.”
“How couldn’t I be?” she asked, sudden heat in her voice seeping through. “It’s all so unfair and I’m just one of the few lucky ones that met a decent Alpha who isn’t afraid to have his Omega mate get a real education and a real job later on. It won’t even be my money I am going to earn, but his! Of course, Tom says in hits eyes it’s mine and I can buy anything I want with it, but technically, it’s his money!”
Scott met Magnussen’s eyes with remarkable composure, showing absolutely no reaction to his words on his face. Magnussen’s smile widened before it vanished, and the man’s gaze left the young student.
“That’s it, little detective, that’s all you’ve got?” he heard the woman sneer. “Pity. Oh well, seems it’s time to kill you now.” She pulled the gun out of Sherlock’s mouth and pointed it at his head. “Bye-bye, sweetheart. It’s been a pleasure playing with you.”
“Sherlock. I was so worried about you when you disappeared from me. Again. I was going mad trying to find you, you can ask Greg. I only want you to be safe, don’t you understand?”
Very cautiously, John slipped the pill onto Sherlock’s tongue and for a second, Sherlock’s entire body lit up at the sensation of John’s hand brushing against his upper lip. Before he could fret about it, John had already turned to reach for the water behind him, and then he was putting a hand behind his head, pushing with gentle force.
John was highly irritated by the fact that the driver was taking the speed limit very seriously although the streets were almost empty. He looked at his watch, probably for the tenth time since he got in. They had been driving for twelve minutes now.
“He’s still sleeping, Mycroft, “John said wearily, “so you’ll have to wait a little more if you want to talk to him.”
“What?” He said with a shrug.  “I’m right, am I not?”
“It’s because I’m bonded, you know?” she said, blushing prettily. “Before, my scent was much stronger, even with the suppressants I was taking. But then I got mated and now my scent has regulated itself. It’s what always happens with Omegas, it signifies they’re unavailable to others now. The scent only returns to its original intensity when the Omega is in heat. Didn’t you know?”
It was a room he hadn’t been in before. It wasn’t an office and there was hardly any furniture. Just a sink in the corner and the broad chair he was cuffed to.
“Wait, did you two come together?”
“Come on, Sherlock, I’ll make some tea for us, alright? We can talk a little.”
“N-no, “he whispered again but it so weak it was barely audible, and he felt his body slipping away further. His mind still screamed at him to get it together, to defend himself against his body’s intrusion, but it was getting quieter by every second until he couldn’t hear it anymore.
John froze. But after one terrible, heart-stopping moment of confusion in which he felt Sherlock tense underneath his hand, on the verge of pulling away at his apparent rejection, he reached out with the other hand, pulled Sherlock’s face forward, and pressed him firmly against his mouth.
Charles grinned and nodded, almost humbly. “Thanks, bruv.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Oh, him? That’s Nathan from ‘Biochemistry II’, right? Isn’t he an Alpha?”
“You’re an Omega?” he asked, his eyes widening even more, causing her to laugh at his reaction. “But…”
“Greg, I’m sorry, I really have to take care of Sherlock now, “John said impatiently, he wasn’t even looking at Greg, instead, he frantically looked after Sherlock in the ambulance car.
Swallowing a few times, wiping at his still-moist eyes, he made his way towards the building’s exit, staring ahead of him without really seeing what was there.
It became even more apparent from the various looks he was getting when he finally slipped out of the apartment, his bag strapped over his shoulder, a dry piece of rice cake jammed between his teeth: a sorry excuse for breakfast, but the only thing he could manage before class.
He shook his head and shoved his brother’s hands away. “No, it’s alright, I’m fine.”
Sherlock did not seem surprised at John’s quiet agreement. He seemed thankful for John’s hesitancy to start their conversation, apparently giving him time to sort out his own thoughts.
Of course, the door was locked. This also was no problem for Sherlock. His lockpicking skills were excellent, but he couldn’t do this so out in the open. He walked around the building and sure enough, there was a door at the outer back, behind the rubbish bins. A quick glance around him revealed no people in sight who might spot him. It was dark, it was drizzling and there weren’t many people outside. It was a good opportunity to break into a building.
He could picture it without difficulty.
Nothing had ever felt as good to John as that. Nothing as right.
He wanted to scream, he wanted to throw his phone out the window, he wanted to howl at the injustice of it all…
“John, it’s cold, “Sherlock finally said against his chest and John nodded. He turned off the shower and positioned Sherlock against the edge of the bathtub, asking him to wait a second. Then he got out and held open the huge fluffy towel he had laid out beforehand. With a trembling hand on John’s good shoulder, Sherlock managed to get out of the tub by himself and he closed his eyes gratefully when John gently wrapped the towel around his pale, shivering body.
“Well, at least twelve hours, “she said, “I’ll get the information to Mr. Holmes’ brother and he’ll contact you. The most important one for now would be the swab from the bite on the shoulder. We’ll test it for bacteria or viruses that might have invaded Mr. Holmes’ system so you can adjust the antibiotic treatment as well as add more medicaments. Fortunately, Mr. Holmes has had a tetanus shot a year ago as his brother informed me, so we don’t need to worry about that. However, there’s still the risk of other infections such as HIV and hepatitis B or C.”
Something about John’s behaviour towards him was off. Something, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
“You can always come to me, you know?” The Professor suddenly said, leaning forward towards Sherlock a little bit. When Sherlock looked up at him in confusion, he smiled and tilted his head to the side.
His whole body was tense, rigid with the wish to protect the one being threatened, and make the tainted scent of distress disappear. He was nervous that Scott would keep on protesting and be thrown out of class, but then, almost miraculously, Scott sat down and John exhaled in relief.
“Look. I was really impressed with how you dealt with Magnussen. That guy was a real arse and you made him look like a fool. I swear, the whole class was cheering for you.”
Sherlock groaned, as the stream of deductions kept flowing through his mind as it was used to when presented with important data. But it was a little too much right now, as he was momentarily struggling with the seemingly infeasible task of simply opening his eyes. It hurt. As soon as he opened his eyes only a bit, stabbing pain assaulted his skull mercilessly and he was barely able to bite back another groan. His head was pounding, and his eyes had trouble focussing.
Scanning the room for every detail Sherlock’s mind was already racing with all the information it fed him. But he needed to focus on the task at hand, so he approached the huge wooden desk where he would likely find something useful. The drawers were also locked and for once, Sherlock was not able to pick the locks. Apparently, someone was taking at least a little precaution.
John’s eyes flew open as the desperate cries next to him finally registered with him. With a start, he raised himself, all his senses on high alert, his body ready to attack any unwelcome intruders. Then he realized what had happened.
“Well, of course, I tried, but as I already told you I was quite incapacitated.” Sherlock’s voice sounded irritated now, apparently thinking she had asked a dumb question.
He could even choose to do something different this time. He didn’t have to hook up with another ‘boring’ Beta girl. Of course, there were so many of them, blond or brunette, petite or tall, slender or curvy. He could have whoever he wanted. But why always taste the same dish?
Then she was gone, and Sherlock beamed at all three of them as if he had defeated them in battle.
“What? You hadn’t deduced that from the fact that I prefer Glenfiddich over any other kind of whiskey? Or that I order Haggis at least once every year whenever I find a restaurant that serves it? Honestly Sherlock, you’re slacking.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, this is nothing, “Sherlock muttered but then he winced in pain and he bent over to the side to throw up again, although it was only bile for his stomach was empty.
Greg didn’t look at him as he concentrated on driving the short way to the police station through the stagnant midday traffic, instead he just frowned and shook his head. “I really can’t tell you, mate, sorry.”
“You should get some rest as well, John.” Greg said as he scrutinized his face. “You look really tired.”
Nothing could feel better than this moment. Lying here with John, lying in his warm arms, snuggled against his strong chest, the two of them tucked in bed, safely hidden away from the rest of the world.
“I did it for you, Scott, “he then said, still not looking at him. “I saw what happened. I saw that Sebastian was the one who pulled the microscope down, he and Victor were obviously trying to frame you, make Professor Magnussen angry at you for breaking his expensive tool. I saw that and I realized that the Professor would not listen to me if I told him the truth. He likes those Alphas, it was obvious from the way he talked to Victor during the class last week. It’s also obvious that he is biased against you. You made him appear weak in front of our class, right at the beginning. You are so young and only at the beginning of your studies, yet you answered all of his questions without fail, something he did absolutely not expect. And the class after, you challenged him with all your questions about the dead Omega killed by her own mate and your opinion about Omegas in general. He did not like that, you saw it as well as I did.”
John’s mouth opened, then closed again. He was speechless. Mycroft had really come through for him. He was free.
It was the beginning of his fourth semester and John was excited to be back at Durham University. His summer vacation had been long and dreary, as always. Mom had been even more depressed than usual and Harry’s drinking seemed to have gotten worse. It had almost driven him mad, sharing the limited space at their small apartment in Leeds, the place his mother had rented after his father’s death two years ago. Not even a handful of multicoloured tulips in an old cracked vase or the new shiny microwave his mother was so proud of having bought in a special sale at Home Bargains, made up for the depressing coldness inside that flat. Spending the whole two months of his vacation there was always unpleasant, but he had nowhere else to go and he couldn’t afford to travel, so he always ended up at home.
What was really frustrating was the fact that he wasn’t able to enter his mind palace and that bothered him even more than the illness itself. What good was his body that it wouldn’t even allow him to seek refuge within the endless depths of his mind while he was reduced to being this shivering, fragile mess, a victim to his transport and its weakness to some sort of infection it had caught?
“Oh, I know enough.”
John noticed Sherlock smiling to himself as if he found that very funny, but he didn’t comment on that.
“I can’t promise you anything, but I have a good feeling, “he said with a smile.
Sudden pain exploded in his cheek and for an instant, the grey brightened up and the noise in his ears receded a bit. It returned but then the pain came back again, and Sherlock realized he was thrown a lifeline.
“John….” The words were almost inaudible, and yet John knew perfectly what Sherlock was trying to say. His eyes darted to Sherlock’s perfect mouth and he licked his lips automatically, noticing Sherlock’s eyes register this nervously.
Irritated, John grabbed the phone and barked into it: “What?”
Mycroft’s words added to the increasing feeling of calmness:
He groaned at his own ridiculousness. Sherlock’s health was his priority now, nothing else mattered until he was okay again. He could think about the complicated nature of their relationship after Sherlock had recovered from … well from everything. Not only from his physical injuries but also from the mental stress he had had to endure for the past few weeks.
John stared at him for a second then he shrugged. “I guess you’re right.” He started to pack his things together, making his bed without thinking, because he was so used to it. Then another thought entered his mind.
John took a step towards him and tried to keep his voice calm. “Yes, I know that, but in this case, your health is more important than your wish to go home. Look at you! You’re on the verge of collapsing, how exactly do you plan on making it to Baker Street?”
It felt a little weird to touch his friend so intimately. Although Sherlock seemed to have no concept of personal space when it came to John, they rarely really touched each other. He knew Sherlock didn’t like to have physical contact with other people and shaking people’s hands (or even embracing a few chosen people like Mrs. Hudson) was an almost daily challenge for him. John really seemed to be the one exception where he didn’t feel completely uncomfortable allowing more physical contact than he normally would.
Reacting instantly, he sprang into action and ran around the thick bushes right in front of him to go help his friend. What he saw right now in front of him made him freeze at once.
“No!” Mycroft took another step forward and got right into John’s face “No, I ask you to reconsider, Dr. Watson because I think you don’t see clearly. Do you have my brother’s best interest in mind? Because I don’t think you do right now. What good are you to him when you’re caught up in a month-long trial? How can you help him if you’re in prison? He needs you now. So I suggest you be
“Wait!” he called once again and this time the kid looked up, just as he was about to enter the building. John could see him furrowing his brow in confusion as he watched John race towards him, finally stopping in front of him.
That would explain his behaviour of the past few days. John was very overprotective and although he hated being fussed over like that, it was probably best to accept that it was John’s nature as a doctor to behave like that.
There had been an e-mail, yes, but it had been sent only two weeks ago. Did Magnussen truly expect his students to read this huge tome of a book in this short amount of time? Most of the students had been busy writing papers or had been still off abroad during the time. He himself had managed to more or less browse through the book, but only because he had died of boredom one day at home when Mary had been away at her aunt’s birthday party.
When they came to the last table of their group, Scott explained their experiment with the moray eel poison in his smooth, sonorous voice. At the first words out of his full mouth, John’s heart leapt and his knees went weak. The way Scott talked, the way his body moved, fluid and effortless as he indicated the sample he was talking about, casually rendering his lab partner superfluous that way - it was incredibly impressive. He was made to be a scientist,  that much seemed obvious. But he also gave off the air of an artist, showing off his magic trick, seducing everyone with his witty elaborations. The fact that his pale blue eyes shone in sincere admiration for the animal’s dangerous defense mechanism added to the overall attractiveness of the Beta, as did the way he bit his lower lip when he paused to catch his breath.
On the other hand, what could he do? He couldn’t force Scott to listen to his apology and it made him sad that the Beta apparently had no faith in humankind that he would react like that. He wanted to prove to him that he was different. That he was not like those Alphas he had met before, arrogant and self-entitled.
But the pale grey eyes hardened.
Sherlock looked at him incredulously. “You want to sing to me as if I was a child?”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, desperate to chase the unwelcome images and that man’s voice away from his mind.
“Yes?”
They had nearly reached the doorway now. Very slowly, John moved his head to the side so that he could see what was happening in the room. He was still at an adverse angle, but he could see what was going on: the woman had a gun in her hand, and she had shoved it into Sherlock’s mouth. She was pushing it in and out, mimicking a very obvious physical act. Sherlock who was barely able to keep his head upright didn’t struggle, he just let it happen, but John could see the pain and humiliation in his shimmering green-blue eyes.
“Alright, I’ll release you then, “she said. “You’ll just have to sign some papers and then you are good to go. I’ll prescribe you some painkillers for your head and I strongly advise you to take it easy for a couple of weeks. You really need to rest. No strenuous physical activities, no sports, don’t drive vehicles of any kind or ride a bike, avoid any kind of alcohol. If you experience any dizziness, nausea, severe headache or any other drastic symptoms, please come back to check with us for more tests. It’s highly improbable that there will be swelling or bleeding in your brain after so many hours, but there is a small chance, so please let Dr. Watson monitor you closely and treat yourself to some rest, Mr. Holmes.” She fixated him with a musing, thoughtful stare. “Alright?”
/////
His whole being was flooded with the thought of his best friend and he felt himself freeze externally. Normally, when he was inside his mind palace, he wasn’t very aware of what was happening to his transport. This could be a little risky because he provided potential enemies with a target, a vulnerable one. It was no problem when he was in a safe environment, say their apartment or Scotland Yard, but sometimes he would have to enter the mind palace quickly when he was chasing after a criminal or saving a potential victim from certain death – he would leave his transport behind to quickly gather the information he needed and usually everything would be fine, because he had John with him, to see to the safety of his body. Very seldomly did that method fail.
He closed his eyes again and concentrated on simply breathing. After a few seconds he opened his eyes again slowly and although there was another stab of brutal pain in his head, it wasn’t as bad as before. The room he was presently in was only dimly lit, the only light provided by two standard lamps in the corners.
“Do you think I could take a shower first?” he asked, as John finished the inspection of his shoulder and was reaching for the tape and gauze.
“Alright, “he said as he strode towards the door and looked back, at Mycroft “come on then.”
“Just because he is too stupid to see the reason behind someone taking care of his most basic needs doesn’t mean he isn’t thankful for your presence, Dr. Watson.” Mycroft sounded as if he had to explain the most basic grammar rules to a small kid. “Don’t you realize he’s lost without you? You were the one keeping him sane after what happened to him. Without you, he would have come apart at the seams.”
“Alright, I guess, “he said at last.
John sighed, relieved that he was gone because his presence always made him feel a little small. On the other hand, he was glad he had shown up. Even if Sherlock had not been awake to see it his brother was apparently actually concerned for him and wanted him to get well again. He also wanted justice for him, and John was on board with that notion,
“But …. I don’t want to,” he said petulantly.
On his way to the bin he caught Victor’s eye and his mouth tightened when he saw the Alpha glare at him in open hostility. He rose an eyebrow as he threw the shards into the bin, meeting the Alpha’s challenge and for a second they held each other gazes, the tension rising between them across the room. Then it was over and John put away the dustpan again.
So he made an effort to smile easily and leaned back in his chair. “It’s good that you kept a close eye on Sherlock, Frederic. It’s true, it’s a little disconcerting that he behaved like that. But I assure you, it’s probably nothing serious. He has done so in the past, he just does that sometimes.”
“Good work, I must say. You did it again.” He came up behind them and put one hand on John’s and one on Sherlock’s shoulder, standing between them. “I’m impressed. Care to celebrate a little? This one was quite difficult, and I think we deserve to blow off some steam.”
Sherlock blanched a little, but he ignored her for once and only asked “Lestrade’s inside?” at which she nodded. But she followed behind him and she tried to lean into his side. “What? Did somebody not like what you deduced about them and reminded you to be polite for a change?” she sneered. Sherlock just blinked and said nothing.
“I am, “Molly said, looking at him sharply. “Didn’t you hear about the Omega Protection Act from four years ago? They took almost all Omega’s rights away, claiming it was for the good of the nation. It’s because birth rates have dropped significantly, Beta fertility has decreased significantly which is why they’re depending on Omegas to increase the birth rates again.”
She looked at him with an expression of hurt and shock, it made him regret his words but at the same time he couldn’t muster up the strength to apologize. He could do that later. He really was tired.
John couldn’t help but smirk at that, and his heart clenched when Scott’s lips curled up in slight amusement as well. It made him feel as if they had shared a private joke, something intimate that only the two of them could understand. He decided in that instant that he
He resumed running, always looking left and right, growing more impatient by the second. Sherlock had been here just a few minutes ago! He had to find him before he was whisked away and kidnapped in earnest.
“Sherlock, “he said, forcing himself to smile warmly, and he pointed at one of the chairs, causing his friend to look at him as if he had gone mad, already forgotten about their plans to have lunch.
“Four days, “Sherlock corrected him with a self-satisfied smirk.
“Alright.” He gave up, looking very disappointed, and he addressed Greg. “Lestrade, could you please phone me as soon as you’re in that man’s flat? Maybe we could hold a video conference and you could show me his room…”
He closed his mouth in embarrassment when he realized that it had been open, cheeks flushing slightly scarlet.
“That bad, huh?” John’s voice was sad, brimming with compassion, as he cautiously stroked Sherlock’s hair, barely daring to touch his aching skull. “Hold on, I’ll get you some paracetamol real quick.”
And John left. On his way out, he passed a visibly fuming Dimmock. He couldn’t resist and let a triumphant smile play out on his face as he tipped his invisible hat. Dimmock’s face turned almost purple and John suppressed a vicious snicker as the door fell shut behind him.
“Hm.”
John smiled. “Well, we’ll see if he’s up for that. Besides, that’s for his doctors to decide not him.”
After his seminars ended he spent his afternoon diligently doing some homework and preparation for tomorrow’s classes. The evening came and he and Mike devoured some beans on toast while watching some silly soap opera on TV. It was probably best to have a full stomach before going to the party and thus avoid getting drunk within the first hour.
Another flash and there he is, telling Irene Adler the very same thing. Sentiment had been her ultimate weakness and it had cost her everything in the end. It had been incredibly satisfying, defeating her and rubbing her face in it like that but at the same time, he had felt….hollow somehow. Triumph would have been okay, of course, no danger in that, elation, pride, anything in that direction, fine. But … feeling hollow? That was a sentiment which he certainly did not want to feel so he had shoved it down, because what good was it to tell others the disadvantage of feelings when he himself was falling victim to them?
“Oi. You two seem to be having much fun, “ Billy Dickson, the one next to Sherlock, piped up all of a sudden. He was sneering at them, his mouth hanging open, which gave them a good view of his rotten, broken teeth – a sight that John could have done without.
“No.“ John smirked back, “Everything’s fine, don’t worry about it.”
“Wow, Charles, you’ve done it!” Billy exclaimed, a mixture of pride and disbelief on his face. “You’ve finally done it, you sly fox! All on your own, I didn’t even need to be there! Wow, that cut on her mouth looks perfect. And the way you arranged his legs….seems like you’ve really paid attention:”
Mycroft smiled a tight-lipped smile. “I know Dr. Watson. Please rest assured, my brother is in good hands.”
“I’m fine!” Sherlock said stubbornly.
And now there were some alarm bells ringing in Sherlock’s head because this…this couldn’t be right, could it? Who was this bloke claiming he knew him, aiming to take him home?
“Well, then we need to get him to the hospital and get a rape kit done, “she said matter-of-factly.
Jack stopped in front of him, in fact with a good distance and he lowered his head, looking ashamed. “I’m sorry man, I don’t know what came over me. I didn’t mean to come on to you that strong, I'm sorry.”
“Well, you needn’t have worried. I already told you: I’m not a helpless Omega. I can protect myself.”
“What?”
John’s back went rigid as he stared at Sherlock in shock.
Scott was obviously shocked at the blunt accusation and his eyes widened even further when the professor stepped forward to loom over him with narrowed eyes.
John’s mouth and throat felt parched, so he swallowed and licked his lips before he leaned forward a little, trying to make eye contact with Sherlock, get him to look at him.
) had called him. He chose to ignore it.
And in Devon, he had forced John to go through a nightmare. Forced him to believe he was haunted by a huge monster with glowing red eyes, just to go through with an experiment.
“Hi, I’m Dr. Stevens. Are you Doctor Watson, Mr. Holmes’ doctor?”
“You had a nightmare,” John started softly, but he stopped at once when he saw Sherlock’s depreciative expression. “What?”
But before he could put his mind to the task of analyzing this strange behaviour of his Professor, his gaze accidentally caught the eye of that blond young Alpha from before and it felt like his heart stopped beating in his chest for a moment. Those bright blue eyes were sparkling that Sherlock could only describe as admiration, and on top of that the Alpha was smiling at him, when he realized he had been caught staring, even going so far as to nod at him. Feeling like he had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, Sherlock blushed fiercely and quickly averted his eyes.
and John saw red.
And just like that, Sherlock’s eyes flew open. “John?”
Mike saw who he was looking at and sighed. “John. Do you really want to get involved?”
“You know him, Dr. Watson, “Mycroft said impatiently. “You know how he hates to be ambushed by an unexpected development like this, so he shuts his walls down and pretends it doesn’t affect him when nothing could affect him more than this.”
“Well, still...you were gone so long, “Greg said with a shrug. “Didn’t seem like you were any interested in going back on that date with her.”
“Did you hear me?”
“Why?” he asked, his voice dripping with blatant sarcasm, “I did have you to protect me, didn’t I?”
Scott bit his lip, turning his head away. John could see that he was very tense and there was a nuance of burned apples in the air, filling the space between them with despair and sadness, and it almost frightened him. There was something about Scott that made him seem so...so vulnerable, reminding him of a wounded animal. It made him feel like he needed to pull him close, stroke his hair, and tell him that he needn’t worry, but he knew it would only result in him getting his face scratched. There seemed to be something on the tip of Scott’s tongue as he contemplated John’s question, but he didn’t say it. Eventually, he just shook his head as he turned towards John again.
“Maybe, “John said, then he tilted his head to the side thoughtfully, “maybe not. I have to go, Greg.”
At Sherlock’s irritated scowl and raised eyebrow John swallowed down his urge to chuckle and looked at his roommate in mock confusion.
“I’ll send you the details of the doctor’s report as soon as this call is finished. You should also know that the rape kit has produced significant results and we have collected enough of DNA that my team of lawyers reassured me will be enough to convict …. that man.”
“And?”
Mrs. Hudson would be delighted. A solved case would mean at least a little peace and quiet for a few days because Sherlock tended to sleep a lot in order to allow his “transport” some much-needed rest.
At least it seemed so. Mycroft could be mistaken, of course. He seemed quite sure of his younger brother’s feelings for John, though. There hadn’t been a hint of doubt in his cool, arrogant voice as he stated the fact that Sherlock had always cared for John. His voice hadn’t been cool or arrogant when he told him that Sherlock had called out for John when he was locked away in his mind palace. Instead, he had sounded soft. Gentle. As is he was spelling out the truth to John in a tender manner, as if John needed to be told softly. Maybe Mycroft suspected that John wouldn’t believe him?
They had had so much fun together. They played tricks on their comrades at school, snuck out of school to smoke their first cigarette together, or to ride the rollercoaster down at the funfair, stealing a kiss up high in the sky on the big wheel, where everyone else was just tiny ants below them. Nothing meant anything, only Mary’s soft lips on John’s, her excited laugh as she buried her face into his shoulder, pretending to be afraid of heights. It had been truly glorious.
John shook his head. “No, I don’t think that’s very likely. Sherlock wouldn’t just let himself be taken away by a stranger, no way. He wouldn’t let himself be “half-carried” by someone he doesn’t know.”
He was still reeling from discovering the shocking deduction inside his mind palace. He still didn’t dare believe it.
“You seemed to be quite deep into your mind palace this time, “John observed quietly, as he led Sherlock to the kitchen table. “You didn’t even notice me entering the room. Care to tell me what that was all about?”
John’s eyes widened, and Sherlock shook his head at once, blushing furiously. “No, not for ...that. Just….lie next to me?”
Magnussen slowly approached the first row, holding his hands behind his back. He looked positively elated, like a predator ready for his meal, coming for his tasty, oblivious prey.
Of course, the bloke didn’t stop. Why would he? There were dozens of students outside, John could mean just about anyone. He cursed himself for his stupidity as he sprinted after the guy, dodging people left and right to avoid a collision.
He would have to monitor him closely all night, check his breathing pattern and his heart rate, observe his body temperature and blood pressure. He knew it would have been much easier at the hospital where the machines would have done the work for him. But he also knew that he would have stayed up with Sherlock all night anyway, so he might as well do it here. Sherlock could wake up in his own home, where he wouldn’t have to lie in a strange bed and be looked after by strange nurses and doctors.
“All of the larynxes show signs of severe corrosive injury, “came the deep calm voice of a student behind John. He turned half-way to see it belonged to one of the Alphas he had noticed before, the one with the blond wavy hair.
He looked up at him then and there were so much hope and uncertainty in his face that Sherlock was inclined to grab his arm and snap at him ‘Yes, of course, you idiot!”
“Alright, “he said softly.
Sherlock looked at Mycroft and was astonished to see a big grin on his brother’s face.
“No! No, please don’t touch me!”
He shut the door behind him and could still hear Mrs. Hudson ordering Sherlock to go to bed, too, cleaning their used teacups and muttering to herself after which she retired to her own flat at last. John now changed into his pyjamas, quickly snuck into the bathroom to brush his teeth, then made himself comfortable in his bed and sighed, grateful for a little peace and quiet at last. He snuggled into his pillows, closed his eyes, ready to fall asleep immediately when he heard someone knock at his door.
Molly’s whole face lit up, her answer to his question obvious. “Oh yes!” she exclaimed. “He is the love of my life and I’m incredibly grateful that I met him. He is such a kind and gentle man. He treats me right, he loves me and he would never let anything happen to me. When I told him I wanted to become a doctor, he was immediately enthusiastic and he encourages my studies. He wants me to have a job, earn my own money, and be happy. We can have children later, he says.”
He looked up at John now. “I’m sorry, “he whispered. “I’m sorry I’m such a failure.”
“An escort agency, of course. A very distinguished one, one that not everybody gets access to. But it explains everything, the victim was in love with one of the escort girls and maybe she liked him back too much, which was how he learned about the human trafficking by chance!”
“What have you done, you fools?” Magnussen thundered as he quickly rushed over to their table.
When he had gotten over his irritation, trying to recover from the small rush of blood into his cheeks, he had not been able to stop himself from stealing the occasional glance at the Alpha sitting a few meters away from him - luckily, he didn’t even have to turn his head a lot to take a look at him. He had noticed the way the Alpha had smiled and waved at other people. It seemed he was quite popular amongst the other students, but he didn’t make a big deal out of it. He also seemed to be very close friends with the sturdy bloke with the glasses, the one he had come with. They quietly talked to each other in their seats and Sherlock swallowed hard when he noticed the way the muscles in the blonde man’s biceps flexed when he leaned his elbows on his table. He was listening to something his friend was telling him, his sharp blue eyes lighting up as he laughed, the deep, vibrant sound an unexpectedly pleasant stimulant to Sherlock’s ears.
Sherlock scoffed before he indeed followed Mrs. Hudson upstairs.
“It doesn’t matter, does it?” he said slowly, meeting Sherlock’s gaze with an intensity that made him swallow. “You don’t want to listen to anything I have to say and at this point, I have to say, I’m quite at a loss because you’re getting it all wrong. But I need you to understand.”
“Alright. Will you stay with him until I’m back?”
He felt himself relax even more at once and he sighed in content as the first rush of nicotine coursed through his body.
He remembered the way he had woken to John holding him in his arms after he had shot that woman. Despite the feeling of utter exhaustion and a pounding headache on top, he remembered the strangely uplifting sensation of being cradled in his best friend’s arms. His face had been full of concern and tenderness and it had been just what Sherlock had needed at that moment. Seeing John right then had pulled him back into reality, away from that overwhelming sense of dread and terror being alone in the room with that woman had made him feel.
It would have been nice to get to know him. Not only because the bloke was incredibly hot, but also because he was like no other person John had ever met before. The way he had deduced the most important facts about John’s life, the way nothing seemed to escape his sharp eyes - it was extremely fascinating and John wanted to know more about him. Had he always been that way? How had he been brought up? Why was he so bitter and angry all the time? Why wasn’t he interested in dating?
John sat down on the sofa and took a sip from his coffee. Although it was not very good it tasted amazing to him and he felt a little more awake at once. He closed his eyes and massaged his temple with his fingers. Maybe he should take some paracetamol, for he had quite the headache.
The library was always full of students but he usually managed to find a quiet spot where he could be all by himself. He would sit down in a corner with a pile of books by his table, at best with a view of the beautiful green countryside outside, and then get to work. He would spend entire Sundays here, having already finished all his assignments due for the next week. He would then enjoy doing whatever he wanted here, undisturbed by noisy other people or other distractions he didn’t need. Sometimes he went into the cafeteria to get himself a cup of tea, or the occasional coffee when he wanted to stay awake longer than his tired transport managed to do. Sometimes he took a walk around the quieter areas on campus: there was a Chinese garden in the back as well as a lake and a small wood nearby. He would enjoy going there, sometimes at dusk or dawn, enjoy the quietude, the cheerful chirping by the local birds, the crisp autumn air on a late afternoon stroll.
He registered a body hovering over him and suddenly there were hands stroking his arms, stroking his chest, stroking his stomach. His already trembling body began to shake violently as the hands slipped under his shirt and began fondling his bare skin.
Despite his resolution to only bother engaging in the very minimum of social interactions, he had managed to even make a few good acquaintances. For a start, there was Greg Lestrade, a tall friendly Beta who lived in the same dorm as him and who studied criminology, resulting in the two of them sharing a few classes. Then there was Molly Hooper, an Omega girl who sort of had a soft spot for him and occasionally tended to get on his nerves because of that very fact, fussing over him as if he was a stray puppy in need of a mother (although she was only three years older than him).
That was met with a deep scowl and Sherlock refused to answer that. He turned his body towards the window, away from Mycroft, to indicate that their discussion was over, but Mycroft wouldn’t just be dismissed like that.
Moments that he remembered very well. Them giggling at a crime scene. Sherlock stripping John off his semtex vest, John’s eyes closed with terrified relief.
What mattered was that he was quite upset because he had to attend her funeral tomorrow afternoon.
“Yes.”
After being instructed on how to conduct their experiment by Magnussen’s assistants, the students got started. They put on the protective equipment and took the tools they needed from the table in the center of their respective workplaces. John and Mason had been assigned the
It had turned out to be a very interesting, challenging case. Naturally, Sherlock had very quickly found the key clue that had taken them through half of London, leading them on a breadcrumb trail, new clues appearing right and left, making it almost impossible for them to catch a break in between changing sceneries.
“Still, I’m responsible for his health and I fear I have to insist he’s coming with us, “she said stubbornly.
- narrowing in distrust once again.
“It’s Greg, Sherlock, “Greg said with slight irritation in his voice but also a big smile on his face. He was obviously relieved to see his friend up and about. “It’s good to see you even if you still can’t remember my name.”
John still didn’t look at him. “No, “he answered quietly, “no I’m not.”
“That’s just it, Greg, “John said, starting to pace up and down the sidewalk in front of the pub. “How could he have been so drunk? He only drank two glasses of beer, that’s not enough to put him into a state like that.”
“Are you done with analysing the room?”
“I’m glad you’re back, John.”
John froze for a second and then asked, “You’re sure? When?”
“Alright, John, I have enough. We have to wait and see if Mr. ahh …” and he looked into his notebook, - Mr. Taylor will press charges against you. He had to undergo surgery last night - you broke his nose and he has a concussion. He’s intubated and still unconscious in ICU at Bart’s.”
“But … I thought that …” Sherlock stammered a little and wasn’t that a rare thing to behold? “I thought that … there was no way you’d be released.”
It was extremely frustrating.
“Hmm.” The Professor fixed him with an expressionless stare, the false smile gone from his thin lips. Sherlock found himself torn between pulling his eyes away from that sharklike stare and returning the man’s cold gaze in an unspoken challenge, ending up choosing the middle road by dropping his gaze and intermittently looking into the other man’s eyes. His heart was beating madly in his chest and he felt slightly nauseous, too.
options.
“That’s a nice idea, Greg. Why not?”
“What?!” Sherlock tossed the laptop aside and jumped up from his chair. “That’s completely unnecessary, why would he do that?”
But all the same, he had ignored that voice. How could he not when John had shot a man for him, put himself in harm’s way in front of Moriarty? Maybe it was okay to just have one weakness.
So it was with a fluttering stomach and anxious fingers rapidly drumming on the thick leather of his bag that he walked the corridors alongside Mike. Shortly before they reached the laboratories, he spotted Scott from afar, identifying his tall, lean form almost immediately. The young Beta was leaning against the wall in the corner with his hands in the pockets of his black blazer, looking incredibly bored as stared at the phone in his hands, waiting for their seminar to start.
He was looking at Sherlock with a sort of cautious nervousness, apparently expecting him to snap at him indignantly, dismissing his concern as silly and unnecessary.
“And Sherlock, I really do think that it’s necessary for you to realize how bad you treated your body. You were still recovering from the assault from two days before and now you have been attacked again so soon after.”
Having finished dressing, he grabbed a comb from the sink. He positioned himself in front of the mirror as he started to brush through his wet, unruly curls, trying to tame them into something agreeable.
His phone rang again and he sighed as he saw who it was.
John stared at Greg in astonishment. “Are you serious? You know he was drugged!”
“Please, “he repeated, closing his eyes for a moment as he tried to get some oxygen into his lungs with obvious effort. “I cannot bear being in a hospital again. I’d go crazy. Please, please, please.” Something that almost sounded like a sob left Sherlock’s throat and he buried his face in his arms as he curled into himself again, still repeatedly pleading with him - “please, John, please”, his restless body shifting back and forth as it fought the unrelenting fever burning within.
The scent of salt and a brewing storm hung heavily between them, dangerous and overwhelming and Sherlock was suddenly filled with desperation at having caused this. What was wrong with him? He needed to calm down, for heaven’s sake  - but he couldn’t, pushing the confusing feeling down stubbornly.
“Unfortunately not. But my boss wants you interviewed once more.”
“No, no, I’m not interested in his kitchen, why would I be interested, for God’s sake? Try the bathroom, yes, that’s better.”
Sherlock was speechless for a moment, even unable to slap away the hand on his knee which was what he should be doing.
He looked up again and met Mycroft’s incredulous glare calmly.
“Okay, love, it’s alright, “John said nevertheless, and he took a deep breath before he reached out to pull the sleeves of Sherlock’s t-shirt from his slender arms.
“No, John, as I said. There’s no need to coddle me. You stopped a terrible thing from happening to me and I’ll always be thankful to you for that. But I’m okay now. You don’t need to worry about me anymore, alright? I’m fine.” He swallowed, looked away from John, unclenched his fists. Then he looked at John again and smiled. This time one could almost fool oneself into believing it was real.
“Alright, boys, I’ll leave you to it then,” she said. “I’ better go and cook up some dinner for you, Sherlock, yes? So you get better soon. So you can go running around London again fast. With John. Where is he by the way?”
John carefully approached the three students, taking advantage of one of the wide columns so that they wouldn’t see him coming. Soon he was close enough to be able to pick up what they were saying.
He sobered down in the cab when he realized that Sherlock had not given him any chance to check his vitals or give him his antibiotics. Speaking of antibiotics, Mycroft should have contacted him with the results of the swabs. Maybe he had, he didn’t really have the chance to look at his phone either. He pulled his phone out of his jacket and saw he had a missed call from Mycroft, one hour ago.
And even if he didn’t, he still needed to be looked after. He was in some desperate need of healing, physically as well as mentally. The first one would be dealt with sooner or later and John really hoped the shoulder wound would heal fast, he would see to it as best as he could. His mental health was another matter and it would take a lot more time for those wounds to heal. John could only hope that Sherlock would accept his help in that matter. Maybe it would suffice if he just conveyed to him that he was there for him and would never leave him. That he would protect him from now on, not only to make up for failing to do so before but also because Sherlock meant the world to him. Well, at least he would say something akin to that.
“It’s done, John. Nothing you could do about it. And I think you had a point there. He seemed awfully bitter. Strange for someone his age. Makes you wonder what he has experienced already.”
“Oh, how can they do that? They pretend as if it’s a mystery why Leslie didn’t show up at the prom but it’s clear as day – oh God, John, this is ridiculous, you cannot really like this!”
“That….” he started, turning his head to the side in disbelieving astonishment…..” was amazing.”
Then he left, walking towards the exit with his bag strapped around his shoulder. His Beta friend turned to Sherlock, his brown eyes full of reproof but he kept his mouth shut and then followed behind his friend.
“Alright, Mr. Holmes, your EEG showed no irregular brain activities, it seems you were very lucky with that kind of hit you took. The nurses tell me your vitals were fine as well. So if you want, you can go home. I assume Dr. Watson here will look after you, yes?”
“Don’t you think that’s exciting, Mrs. Hudson?” He took her hands into his to beam at her, an expression of pure bliss on his face, reminding John of a little boy on Christmas Eve.
John admittedly was very curious about all that. He was very curious about his knot, especially. Being an Alpha, it was a natural part of his anatomy. But he had never used it, never even seen it, being with a Beta. Betas weren’t made for taking a knot, and so he had no idea what it felt like. He was incredibly curious and was dying for a chance to get proof for the legendary tales that were spread around or if it was just some hogwash, one of the many myths that got scattered around because people thought it made them look cool.
. An absolute marvel.
“Thank you, John, “he whispered, and John’s heart stopped in his throat at the sight of him.
“I’m in my second semester. I’m studying criminal forensics and chemistry.”
He quickly washed his face again and brushed his teeth. Then he took a quick shower, thankful to wash off the sterile hospital smell he hated so much, but it wasn’t easy. His skull pounded like hell, the bite mark on his shoulder felt sore and he still felt shaky after throwing up. His whole body was yearning for rest.
Until that day in the lab when John Watson did something completely unexpected.
“It’s alright, Sherlock, it’s me, John. Just take it easy.” John took Sherlock’s arm and pulled him up a little, as Sherlock’s eyes opened more widely trying to take in where he was.
It was late in the afternoon and John had managed to get Sherlock Holmes to do everything he had planned for him. He had eaten some more toast, drunk loads, and loads of tea. He had taken his medicine without complaint, all while fumbling with photos and reports from the crime scene Greg had sent to him. John knew that it was best not to disturb him when he was concentrating like this, so he didn’t. He worked around him, pushed cups of tea and pills into his hands while Sherlock was rambling away, and it all seemed like a perfectly calm and nice day to spend together like this.
John looked at him and couldn’t quite suppress the chuckle escaping his mouth. “Come now, Sherlock, you know it’s a little early to chase after criminals. But maybe you would like to watch some fake criminal chasing on the telly with me?”
“And where were you, Doctor Watson?” Mycroft’s tone turned accusatory. “I thought you were looking after him. What, did you fell asleep next to him on the couch?”
After one more long look at both of them, the nurses disappeared again.
But John shook his head, as he reached out and tenderly stroked his curly hair.
This came from Lestrade who had followed them on their way away from the arrested man and the hustle around him.
“Of course.”
This was perfect.
She just nodded, apparently unmoved by this implied criticism of her professionalism, and turned to her bag again.
Other times, he would sort through his memories to delete ones that weren’t important anymore. Many things that he had saved years and years ago would not be relevant to his more mature self now and it was satisfying deleting a few things that wouldn’t take up so much space in his mind palace anymore. And he needed a lot of space. His brain was like a sponge, it constantly soaked up information – always, everywhere - and although his mind palace was gigantic, consisting of hundreds of floors, every single one split up into several corridors with several adjoining rooms filled with countless files and memories, even to his genius there were limits, which made it necessary to take stock from time to time and delete unnecessary stuff.
Sherlock moaned quietly as he pressed his lips against John’s and John wrapped his arms around him to pull him tight against his body.
He bit so hard into his nail that he winced in pain and he stared at his finger as a tiny drop of blood appeared on its surface. Shaking his head in disgust and impatience at himself, he let his hand drop down and tried to repress the urge to move some part of his body in some way. He was feeling incredibly restless. Again. Although Sherlock theoretically was safe and sound this time. Well, as safe and sound as he could be with a nasty concussion, an infected bite wound, and the psychological trauma after two consecutive sexual assaults on his person.
“Really? So you would have been fine on your own when you were drugged and almost raped by that stranger in the park three days ago? Or killed by that woman in the basement yesterday? Hm?” Mycroft’s stare was intense, and Sherlock forced himself not to look away, although he truly was at a loss for what to say.
“So that was quite something, “Mike piped up from next to him. John shot him a look and Mike smiled weakly in sympathy.
Scott looked disgusted but at the same time also kind of bored. “Just piss off, Victor, “he said with a sigh, rolling his eyes in point-blank irritation. “I’m not interested in talking to you.”
Sherlock’s pale blue eyes were full of doubt as he met John’s insistent gaze. “Maybe?”
“Yeah, Sherlock’s telling the truth. The fever’s dropped completely. The shoulder has gotten infected, but I think the antibiotics will come through now. Of course, I will take a close look on it. He’s even eaten, so he should be completely fine after another week of rest.”
“Still, I didn’t need your help.”
But as he was quite impatient, he didn’t ask what that was about. He quickly entered the building, followed closely by his police friend.
She took her hand away from his shoulder and he gasped in relief. He flinched when he suddenly felt her hands on his face again. His breath came out in agonized, little puffs when she brought her face closer to his. Her hand wandered upwards to grab his hair again, holding him in place.
“I’ve spoken to the advisors here. As it happens, ‘Advanced Toxicology’ fits right into my timetable. It also fits in well with a few other courses I’m taking. I will get credit for the course, naturally. And I’ve done the ‘Introduction’ in my first semester, got special permission for that because of my entry marks”
It seemed he would not be given that chance.
He still hadn’t changed his position and was still staring at the wall, lying on his side. He was feeling empty. Hollow. Although he had tried to avoid it, his mind was racing through the events of the past days. He thought of the fight in the hospital and his mean words to Sherlock. They still made him wince, even in the sorry state that he was in and he was still angry at himself for saying them.
Greg’s eyes widened slightly, then he nodded and the officer left. Greg turned to John with a huge smile on his face as he held the door wide open.
He simply glared at her. He felt the strain in his arms, as they were stretched to the side by the handcuffs and he wished she would just get on with whatever she was planning to do with him. His head was killing him, and he wasn’t in the mood for some villainous monologue. It was just plain predictable and thus, boring.
Sherlock had been immensely thrilled about the incoming flow of information, painting a rather grisly image of their murderers. Turned out they were hunting a pair of brothers whose childhood under the hard reign of a cruel-tongued mother and a younger abusive stepfather had traumatized them, so much that they had finally lost their grip and turned to murdering people resembling their long-deceased (translate: murdered) parents.
He stood up, made his way to the door on wobbly knees, and opened it quietly, peering around the corner. He exhaled in relief when he saw Mycroft still standing at the window, speaking into his phone. He really didn’t need his nagging older brother to give him his ‘I told you so’ face.
“Oh blimey, there are almost no seats left, thanks to you.” Mike threw John another exasperated look, getting only a helpless shrug from John in return.
He let the heavy door crash closed behind him and when he stumbled over a thick stone he had not seen he cursed loudly and violently kicked it out of the way. The stone flew through the air and hit the leg of a female student coming his way and Sherlock murmured a quick apology as he was glared at with accusing eyes.
Her finger left his mouth and she pushed herself up, her eyes never leaving his. She towered over him for a minute, that triumphant smirk from before still on her mouth. He used that time to rest his head for a second because it was getting heavier by the minute and he really considered sleeping a tempting option at the moment.
“Sherlock?!”
Sherlock blinked in surprise as his rapid thought process was interrupted by that deep, velvet voice. He looked up at the man who was now standing right in front of him, a wide smirk on his face (
“N-no, “he whispered, “p-pleeease….” That’s all he managed to croak out and the sudden fear enabled him to open his eyes a little wider to see his attacker kneeling over his body. The man’s face was flushed with excitement and his mouth was hanging slightly open. He was licking his lips as he leaned down further to linger over Sherlock’s face.
Instead, he said, “I’m single and open to dating if you’d like.”
What he did mind was the slightly hysterical giggle escaping John Watson’s mouth.
He shook his head and ran a hand over his mouth when suddenly, the memory of him snapping at Sherlock a little while ago entered his mind.
He swallowed heavily and dragged his eyes away from his reflection.
All of a sudden, Sherlock pulled back violently, as if he had been struck. “Oh God, John, I’m sorry!” He scrambled back, his eyes wide open in shock, mirroring John’s own.
“You’re awfully protective of him, aren’t you?” he said quietly.
“Shall I go, Sherlock?” John asked quickly but Sherlock just looked at him quietly and shook his head. He pulled off his trousers and stood there with just his underpants on. His nakedness in combination with all the cuts and bruises on his skin made him look very vulnerable again and John felt such a sudden surge of protectiveness towards him, it almost hurt. He wanted this examination to be over. He wanted Sherlock to feel safe again, not to be poked and prodded by a stranger over and over again. He deserved some peace and quiet after the ordeal he had been through.
“You go ahead and pick a table for us, “he said to Mike, making a quick decision.
Who knew, maybe it would even be fun. Breaking them.
John’s voice turned soft. “Look, Sherlock. I know you want to go home, I understand. But let’s keep you closely monitored for the night and maybe we can talk about when you can leave tomorrow, alright?”
“What?!”
John froze and pondered. Was he on the verge of interrupting a couple having wild Saturday evening sex in the park? He hesitated.
He turned and saw Jack jogging towards him, his posture totally different from before. He thought about ignoring the man and just to step into the bar again, but curiosity got the better of him and he stayed put. “What?” He asked with open hostility in his voice.
I found writing this chapter (and the next one, technically they belong together, but the chapter was getting so long, I had to split it) quite difficult. Wrapping up a story in a way that makes sense is kind of hard... Feedback, as always, is very much appreciated ❤
His lips curled into a small smile.
John and Mike looked at each other in mutual understanding, coming to a companionable agreement regarding their future in this course. Both of them were determined to pass the class. Mike was incredibly intelligent and always belonged to the best students in most of his classes. John could see that Mike felt as challenged and determined in this matter as he was and felt a surge of affection for his best friend. They would doubtlessly spend endless hours in the library and the lab, studying for this class, aiming to not only pass the class but also
“How much time for the analysis?” John asked.
“Alright, Mr. Holmes, I’m glad you’ve changed your mind, “he said, ignoring Sherlock’s annoyed eye-rolling. “The nurse will administer some pain medication and we’ll hook you up to an EEG just to make sure your brain’s functioning normally. You really ought to sleep then and I’ll see you tomorrow at ward round.”
“This is only one example of many, “Magnussen was saying with a lazy smile curling around his thin lips, pulling John out of his thoughts once again. “I could show you many more examples but I think you all have gotten the point that Alphas and Betas have a much higher tolerance to toxicants and poisons, Omega bodies being much weaker and thus much more prone to illness or even death, as they simply cannot withstand the toxicants attacking their system.”
He knew that technically he was tired and that his body longed for him to go to sleep. But he wouldn’t because he had to look after Sherlock, so he simply resigned himself to sitting here on the bed with Sherlock all night. To distract himself from worrying he quickly got up to fetch one of his books from the living room, a medical guide on wounds and infections. It would be a good idea to freshen up his knowledge on bite wounds, especially human ones.
And he was having fun, too. He was also stressed because of the loudness and the hotness and he definitely wouldn’t last more than another hour, but he had been having fun with his friends until now and he was grateful for that.
“Now now, no need to wet your trousers. If you’ve studied hard and that’s what I assume when you’re sitting here, all aspiring to work in the challenging medical profession in one way or another, you won’t have any problems with this. So let’s begin.”
Sherlock nodded and sipped at his tea. It was hot and strong, and it felt like heaven. He closed his eyes as he felt his body relax at the warmth spreading through his stiff limbs and for a moment he felt okay. Not as if he had been drugged – was still drugged – in order to get raped.
He deliberately ignored Sherlock’s appalled glare piercing into his back, choosing to meet Mycroft’s intense gaze instead.
But he was also free to go wherever he wanted - on campus at least. Naturally, he often went to the library. If it was not to study or research for a specific work assignment or paper, it was just to browse by himself, research whatever topic he was currently interested in. And there were a lot of topics he was interested in: criminology, chemistry, physics, medicine, biology, you name it. He was thirsty for knowledge and he could never get enough information once he had found a subject he wanted to sink his teeth into.
“Oh, please.” Sherlock looked at his older brother with raised eyebrows. “Since when are you interested in my health? There’s something you need from me, so spit it out.”
“Wake up, you bloody bastard! You can’t leave me like this!”
He loved having a best friend. It gave him something he had never experienced before: a sense of comfort and security just by having this very person by his side every day. He loved having John and he could never imagine life without him anymore.
Sherlock didn’t wake up and John instantly felt bad for slapping him.
“Why?”
“Yes, of course, fine, John, “he muttered and shoved past his friend. He ventured into the kitchen and was surprised to see Mrs. Hudson there, standing at the cooker and stirring in a big pot with a ladle. She heard him coming in and let the ladle drop into the pot at once.
It was an order, not a request and Sherlock instinctively obeyed the familiar commanding voice. He sat on the chair right next to him, although he managed to throw one more evil look in his brother’s direction.
Sherlock let out a long, anguished sigh and then recounted yesterday’s events in a bored, clipped voice. John leaned forward while he heard the story for the first time, too. Greg sat down in a chair and wrote everything down Sherlock said. When Sherlock reached the part where he was captured, he hesitated, and John perked up.
Was it really a good idea to stumble around aimlessly here trying to look for the needle in the haystack? But what else could he do?
But to both Sherlock’s and John’s shock and astonishment, Charles grinned. “Oh, yes, yes I did. I finally decided to do it, was tired of being a coward. Sliced them up nice and good. You would have been proud of me, Billy. I wish you’d have been there to see it. But I made pictures, wait a second.”
At once, Sherlock's mind started cataloging:
He needed to catch him before he was lost in the huge crowds that were sure to be outside during break time.
Sherlock sighed, although he was relieved at the distraction, truth be told. “Alright. But only a little.”
“Good.” John was normally not so resentful, but this time it was different. “He could have been severely hurt. Well, he was but it could have been even worse.”
This would not do.
“You do realize he killed that woman to save your life?” Mycroft asked sharply. “He did it for you, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock! That was not nice, “John said accusatorily as he turned back to his friend who meanwhile had sat down in his chair and was pouring himself a cup of tea.
There were love bites and angry-looking bite marks everywhere on Sherlock’s throat, chest and shoulders. It was a horrible sight and John had to look away for a second, his right fist clenched tightly into the bedsheets. After a minute he looked again and that’s when he saw the faint bruises on Sherlock’s throat. There was no doubt, he had been strangled by his attacker, so hard that there were marks to prove it.
Sherlock who had just started to speak stopped and looked at John suspiciously. Then he rattled off: “You’re in a good mood today which your enthusiasm for this disgusting food proves, you’ve already devoured everything in under five minutes, so that’s quite the appetite. And this although you haven’t slept enough this night, just barely over five hours which means you had trouble falling asleep last night because I was already asleep by approximately 10 o'clock …. Which means you lay there awake, worrying about me probably. Or you were worried about the damage these horrible hospital beds would do to your back after spending the night in one of them. Apparently, you were in luck, because your back seems fine and there’s a spring in your step proving you’re feeling quite rested although the wrinkles under eyes tell me your body would like a nap today, preferably around midday, if you don’t get one you’ll get irritable in the afternoon. You liked the porridge and the toast but you found the tea hideous which you didn’t want to admit in front of me so you put on a show of liking it although I saw you wincing and scrunching up your nose, really John, do you think I’m blind?”
And then John had ruined it all by allowing his stupid
He nodded, relieved that he had an excuse to stay away a little longer, to catch up with his friends.
“Oh God.”
Sherlock gave him a pointed look. “As a matter of fact, I am perfectly fine. The fever’s gone, John has checked. It’s been a rough couple of days, but it’s over now.”
“There you are.” John said, relieved.
He was still at a loss at what to say, and John was unexpectedly quiet, so he tried to lighten the mood with humour.
“It’s not possible. Nobody can deduce anything like that just by looking at another person.”
But he would be okay now, John felt.
“Williams. Scott Williams, “the boy replied calmly.
“It was wrong of me to say those things to you at the hospital, Sherlock. It was horribly wrong.”
