Lingeringly but powerfully, he pressed against the brunet’s prostate, seeing Sherlock fighting to keep his eyes open but failing under the delicious sensation. John felt a bit smug to be the only one to see Sherlock like this, to put him in that state. How beautiful he looked like this...
"Good morning Mrs.Hudson", he answered flatly without deigning to give her a glance, apparently lost in his thoughts.
“Sure, go ahead,” Sherlock answered naturally, seeming oblivious, and sat in his chair again, opening his book. Apparently, he wasn’t going to join John on his tour of the flat. So be it.
“Sherlock,” the he then said. John recognized his name. He was the detective inspector that kept texting Sherlock for help. Lestrade saw John and, after frowning for a second, extended his hand for a shake. “And who are you? Another detective? I didn’t know Sherlock had colleagues.”
“Yeah, sorry, go on,” John said with a slight shake of head, regaining his countenance. Shit. That couldn’t happen again.
“Donovan,” Sherlock said flatly, passing through the door and not sparing her a glance, continuing his way into the house. “Where's Lestrade?”
. He wondered if he would ever be able to live without this again, was scared by how already he was craving it like a drug.
What was shocking him wasn’t just his desire for John. It was that all he wanted to do to John, he wanted John to do to him. And he just couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that he actually wanted someone so close to him, in his intimity. That just the idea of John’s tongue teasing his entrance was making him shiver. God, he
On his way he passed to his bedroom to get some lube as quickly as he could, hoping no one could see him walking around naked through the windows. When he came back to Sherlock’s room, he had to stop in the doorway to appreciate the picture of that long, lean, albater man displayed in the bed like an offering. His black curls were messy from John’s hands in them, framing his face. Jesus, that face, with those eyes, light but somehow dark and full of promises, with that soft, playful smile on those lips, and John couldn’t help but walk toward him and install himself between the detective’s legs. He looked down at Sherlock’s cock, deep red and leaking, a little pool of precome stagnating on his stomach, and the soldier’s mouth watered. Sherlock kept staring at him the entire time, his hand reaching for John’s.
John muffled his moan with his free hand, feeling his come, white and hot, spurting on his stomach. He basked in the afterglow sensation as long as he could, panting, before reality slammed him in the face and the feeling of ecstasy vanished.
Just as a general warning, I am francophone, so I'm sorry in advance if you find mistakes in the text. I did my best!
“This is marvelous,” she continued. “It’s going to do so much good to Sherlock to have you around! You know, calm him down a little, hopefully,” she whispered.
John smiled fondly, got up and pressed a kiss on the other man's lips and rearranged his coat collar. "Be careful," he whispered.
But the detective had to admit to himself that he couldn’t blame his flatmate. Who would come to Sherlock Holmes for sentimental support? He was normally the one
And he did. They actually ate on the couch before Mrs.Hudson told them to take the food away from it or she would make them clean it. While the movie played, John spotted Sherlock mouthing the lines when he thought the doctor wasn’t looking. It made him smile. It was so fun to see him as he was, not all show-off arrogant consulting detective and all. Being passionate about something that wasn’t linked with psychopaths and murders. John liked both Sherlocks, but it felt special to see that one.
“OF YOU ACTING LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED, YOU DICK! I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT!” John yelled, getting up on his feet.
He froze, and a millisecond after, so did Sherlock. After what seemed like an eternity, John untangled himself, looking down at his flatmate with a confused brow.
And thanks to Araelle for correcting me and helping me when I don't know what to do and giving me ideas and mainly listening to me rambling about Johnlock all the time. :)
"Yeah", John answered simply, deciding that letting his friend believe that was better than admitting he spent the night alone drinking cheap vodka Harry had stashed over the house and jerking off to a stranger’s texts. Re-reading those messages that morning, that said-stranger was really rude, he realized. But so had he been so could he blame the guy? He was really harsh and horny when drunk. But still, he didn’t feel ashamed about it. Even if he kind of had talked that Sherlock (what kind of a name is that??!) into it, he hadn’t forced him or anything, and hell, it’s not like he’s ever going to meet him. It had just been good.
“I- I need a moment,” Sherlock said between shallow breaths, and John nodded with a soft understanding smile and sat on the bed. The longer their night lasted, the better. The detective installed himself between John’s legs, putting his arm over the one that encircled his waist. He let John absorb his weight, relaxing against him and closing his eyes.
“...and the wood with which the floor was made is from a tree that only grows in Kazakhstan, and I never studied this type before. Which fits well, because the section of my blog about plants is unacceptably lacking. I hope to find trace of trimethylaminuria in the sample, if my smell was correct, which it always is.”
Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the bed with John on his lap. Two hands were cradling his cheeks, holding him carefully but lovingly as if he were the most precious thing in the world. John rubbed their noses together, slowly, nuzzling into Sherlock like he needed to ground himself in the moment, to take in everything around him because it felt surreal. Sherlock understood, because he felt the same way. The tenderness, the sweetness of it felt more intimate than anything they had ever done. There were no words to describe the strength of it. The detective could feel John’s slow, even breaths fade against his cheek. The warmth of John’s skin pierced through the layers of their clothes and brought him a sort of soothing comfort. The doctor pressed their foreheads together, simply holding Sherlock for a minute, before he tilted his head and pressed the most gentle of kisses on Sherlock’s lips. He took his time, remembering how nervous Sherlock had been the previous night even if he hadn’t let it show too much. John knew. It was as if all Sherlock felt, John could feel too. At that moment, he felt he could read Sherlock, analyzing him like Sherlock normally did to him. And he knew Sherlock was nervous. Trusting, but nervous. That fact made John nervous, to have all that faith put in him. But he thought that if he could do anything right, it was this, because nothing had ever felt right like this before.
“I like hearing another point of view; sometimes people remark things that are wrong, and I might I realize something by telling how they didn’t see correctly.”
“With you?” she asked, eyebrows raised. Then she looked at John with worry. “He’s not paying you to do weird stuff, is he?”
John repressed an amused smile at the childish ridiculousness of Sherlock Holmes saying that sentence. “Let’s just settle for chess.”
All the chaos and the energy surrounding him even made him forget how he knew Sherlock in the first place. At first, it had been awkward keeping up a conversation, but as the days passed it was easier and easier. His flatmate knew about a thousand things and was always eager to pass information. (Even if sometimes he sort of over shared, who bloody wants to know about the different types of tobacco ash?) He was slightly bit show-off sometimes. But all in all, John was grateful for it. He didn’t know what was building up there, but it was fresh.
“I take it you don’t want tea?” Sherlock asked, the first words he’s spoken since they left the restaurant.
John stared at Sherlock in shock. In the almost two months he had lived with the brunet, it was the first time he had been so sentimental. And yet it had been said with an even tone and a straight face, as if Sherlock was just stating a fact. Which he probably thought he was. It was just the eyes that betrayed him. The way they looked at John again. That way that made John feel butterflies in his stomach and his brain blank. And the doctor thought that for once that Sherlock opened up, he should do something to show it was appreciated. So he crossed the small distance to the table and gently put his hand on Sherlock’s forearm.
The photo was of a pair of jeans, actually, more of a closeup of the very evident bulge right under the belt. Was Anderson sending him this as an attempt to annoy him?
And after four hours of complete silence, the man opened his eyes, letting out a frustrated growl. “I still don’t understand how it is possible! I’m going to have to go back and take more samples. I should always take more samples!”
I'm SOOOO sorry for the wait. It's been 45 days since I last posted! D: It was a crazy month! I had a new nephew, I was sick, I had SO many exams... But here it is! And this chapter is almost 3 times the length of a regular chapter, so I hope that'll make up for the wait.
“The landlady didn’t hear you, she is starting to have some audition problems even if she won’t admit it,” Sherlock said a bit more quietly, as it was something that was not to be spoken of.
John was pulled out of his thoughts, the small smile on his lips disappearing as he heard his phone buzz. He turned around in his chair, looking around the room for the device. After a while he found it, lying under the pillow on his chair. He pressed his thumb to the button, the home screen flashing open under his eyes. A text from Greg.
Mrs.Hudson made him a unpleased comment about his behaviour again, and he didn’t listen again, waiting for her to leave the room.
“But you can’t,” Sherlock argued with a vigor and a determination that surprised his flatmate. How could John not understand? It was the recipe. You had to follow it. “You have to follow the recipe to obtain the best result.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed, his plea augmenting as John’s grip on him intensified. “John, John, John, John, John…” And the latter couldn’t wait to feel him come on his fingers.
John slowed his pace, gently removing Sherlock’s hurting hand from his mouth and dropped a light kiss on it, then on the man’s lips.
It was only at the end of shift, exhausted and still stressed about his boyfriend, that John got a text initiated by Sherlock.
The latter was typing faster, his fingertips flying on the screen, not even pausing as he read the answer the other man sent him. The messages appeared in front of him before he even thought about what he was going to write, as if his fingers were dancing on the phone, making a choreography with words.
“No. If you have questions- in case you forget my brand of tea or anything, that happens to the common human brain, just text me. Here, take a card with my number.”
“I don’t just sit around and do nothing. I write my blog and I do all the groceries and I’m looking for a job.”
“Aren’t you gonna answer it?” the two men asked each other simultaneously. John’s eyebrows raised until they reached his hairline.
It hadn’t happen without obstacles and frustration, of course. Dating Sherlock was no easy thing. The man was impossible, both in amazing and hair tearing ways. Lack of good communication had almost broke them off; Sherlock didn’t really see the relevance of saying some rather important things to John. Four days off on a case with leaving no notice for anyone, too lost in the adrenaline of resolving a mystery had John and Lestrade and Mycroft losing their minds looking for him. He came back home only to comment on their ridiculousness: of course he was going to go back home. Another time he had try to look for evidence on a bomb that was going to explode in less than a minute. Yes, John was more than ok with being exposed to danger, but there was being exposed to danger and stupidity. After Sherlock ended up spending three weeks in the hospital, the doctor got pretty angry with him for not taking care of himself. Of course, the detective got mad, he was an adult, he should be able to take his own decisions, he wasn’t
Apparently he wasn’t going to get any more answers, so the soldier shuted up. Talking wasn’t something he liked to do anyway.
“I want to make you feel good,” he whispered in the crook of the brunet’s neck, a hand making its way around Sherlock to slip into the opening of his shirt. The detective stayed still, but John heard his breath hitch. He kissed Sherlock’s trapezium, stroking the soft skin of his chest with the tip of his fingers, reveling in the warmth of it. He grazed one of the nipples lightly.
“Well then,” Sherlock said, turning around with no warning and getting energetically on his feet. “Use that sad little imagination of yours and come and tell me if you have an idea. I’ll be in the kitchen dissecting parrot’s ovaries. Don’t worry, I won’t use our utensils and not wash them afterwards like last time,” Sherlock said before John could open his mouth to tell him exactly that, because his mind had not fully realized what had just happened and giving a logical answer seemed easier than to try and put his feelings into words.
He head off to work, head in the clouds all day. He trusted Sherlock not to be doing anything to hurt their relationship. He just hoped he was safe. Trust Sherlock to lie about getting into great danger so John wouldn’t try to talk him out of it, the doctor reasoned.
And to imagine those words pronounced with Sherlock’s voice, his mouth and the curved, teasing smile that showed the man knew he was in control…
“He’s hiding to his wife the fact that he’s a diabetic. I noticed him throwing the sugar pack for his coffee-”
“It’s alright,” the latter decided after tasting. Angelo served them both a glass before fishing a lighter in his pocket and lighting the candle at the center of the table.
They ended up watching two movies instead of one, arguing over which captain was the best over the whole serie, and if the new movies were as good as the classic ones. When the credits started rolling, Sherlock turned to John. He looked more relaxed, posture not perfectly straight, his shoulders less tense, something eased in his features. He should take more time for himself, John thought.
And he definitely didn't understand the concept of a too-personal question, if he hadn’t been offended by that one. That explained a lot.

an impenetrable wall around Sherlock Holmes that no one could touch, but Sherlock did not respond at all.
One night Sherlock came back to the house after John was asleep, something cautious in his gait, and John knew the river had finally broken and the shifting sheets of ice had begun moving with its current. He listened to the ice pans cracking and crashing in the distance, dragging frozen trees and plants into the river with them. Sherlock slipped into the bed beside him and twisted to pull John into his arms.
“Veterinarian owed me a favor. She was accused of stealing a rabbit and making experiences on it. It glowed in the dark. Turned out it wasn’t her.”
“Your compassion. Always gets you in the end. You feel sad for an unimportant dead rabbit. You feel sad and guilty about your sister and for your fellow soldiers in Afghanistan that are still fighting while you came home because you had the chance of being injured. This is also amplified by the fact that you are an army doctor and you saw many of them die right in front of you. You feel bad because you lost more of them than you have saved. While during that time, you are hurting, and yet you feel no compassion for yourself, only for them. But you are more important. Don’t feel guilty. You didn’t kill any of those men. You didn’t make your sister alcoholic. Everything you’ve done was to make them feel better, and that’s already better than anybody I’ve known. So you should take care of yourself too, because they need you.”
John cracked his eyes open, adjusting to the morning light when he jumped and let escape a small yelp, covering his chest with the cover.
“No, but you’re impatient and rude, and no one should suffer the consequences of you being an annoying brat.” And with not a glance back, the doctor got downstairs and opened the door.
“Am I interrupting a little domestic?” Mrs.Hudson asked as she entered the room with a broom in her hands, not a second after John disappeared.
Everybody started to move around in the office, and the sight of people running everywhere like they didn’t know what they were doing and Anderson just sitting in front of his computer as always just made Sherlock annoyed at humanity again, so he left the office without another word to anybody. His work there was done.
Sherlock probably just thought of how he had taken care of John sexually, John figured. He didn’t think of how he had save John from everything. The boredom, the loneliness, the depression.
“Yes. A client emailed me about his frog. He claims it disappears at nightfall and reappears the next morning with a new spot on its back.”
The doctor stretched like a tired, happy cat and closed his eyes. He would just relax five minutes before it was his turn for the shower. Just five minutes…
“Well, I’ll leave you with him so he can show you around, and you know, get to know each other,” she excused herself with a smile and leaving an awkward silence behind her.
They parked the vehicle in the employees’ parking, and they made their way upstairs into a wing of the building John had never set foot in before. The duo entered a lab, and the sight of all the scientifical material scattered everywhere and projects going on around was something John hadn’t seen since college.
Sherlock followed John up the stairs, stopped two or three times on his way when John turned around and grabbed his collar to kiss him. Not that Sherlock was complaining. The stairs might not be the most ideal place, the detective reflected, but John and him were finally on the same page, and finally all the acting could stop. He could show John what he meant to him, show John how truly formidable he was, show John he was unlike anyone he ever knew. Plus, in the stairs they were at the same height, which wasn’t bad. Although, Sherlock did love how John was smaller than him, his to protect.
So the two men started to work in the kitchen, gathering the ingredients on the table, Sherlock classing them in the order they would be used. He then started to chop the vegetables when he noticed John measuring the spice. And clearly he did
“Ssh, ssh, easy there. We don’t want to rush it and miss the best bit, do we?” John whispered soothingly, one of his hand going up to stroke Sherlock’s back. The detective suddenly stopped his movements and hid his face in the crook of John’s neck, taking deep, shuddering breaths. He was clutching to John, the grip of his fingertips almost painful, but the blond would not have change it for anything in the world.
“I… don’t know, I just woke up,” John said slowly, looking into Sherlock’s eyes which looked back at him intensely. Every time Sherlock looked directly at him, actually, even if it happened rarely, it was just so strong, so passionate in a sort of way, like everything Sherlock did, and it just left John breathless. To have all that beautiful mind and all that attention just for him, just for a second, was humbling, somehow. And John didn’t want to admit it, not even to himself.
This effectively had been proven an interesting experiment for Sherlock, but not for the reasons he thought it would.
“Well, if you have any more, er, concerns, you can tell me about it if you want,” Sherlock said, looking down at his cup.
The detective started to explain to John how it was possible to deduce from the angle of the wound from where the arrow had been blown. That leaded to a monologue too fast and with too many parts happening exclusively in Sherlock’s head and not making the way to his mouth for his flatmate to follow, so the latter let Sherlock do his work and tried not to let the smugness he felt inside show on his face. And only partly succeeded. Sherlock had shown to everybody he was John’s and John was his. They were in a relationship. John restrained a giggle. Bugger, he had never felt that ridiculous in years. But he found he quite enjoyed the giddiness.
John sat on his bed and didn't look at her. She waited for as long as she could stand, wanting to kill Sherlock for what he'd done to this man. John
John's thumb hovered over the 'send' button. If he was not very much mistaken, which he doubted, his new flatmate had just produced a dead woman's luggage from the middle of their kitchen. Somehow he hadn't thought the 'consulting criminal's' crimes would be so blatant. He'd thought he'd be sneaking into the man's financial paperwork, not staring at damning evidence before he even had a key to the flat.
Jennifer Wilson, forty six years old. A serial adulterer and the child molester no one noticed. No one was going to catch her and he hadn't been able to find any evidence to ensnare her that'd be safe for him to divulge. She was too smart for that and now too connected to his network. She was the victim of one of his blackmail schemes, who still wasn't smart enough to stop her crimes and now knew too much. The smart ones were dangerous but they made the perfect 'innocent victims' for Sherlock Holmes to avenge and they, if all went well, would solve the problem of Mr. Harold Yale - which would hopefully validate the mind-numbing task of carving 'rache' into the floor with a metal file and a dead woman's nails. That had certainly been on the psychotic side of 'thorough'.

Mycroft bowed his head like a posh lordling and turned awkwardly to John. They hadn't spoken since the drug den debacle.
The suited man kept staring at them but his gaze grew vague, unfocused. Then he huffed out a laugh and Sherlock looked even more unsettled.
John stared at Sherlock, unable to look away. It was unintuitive for such an unstable man. Sherlock Holmes, the amoral madman who kept John Watson whole.
Nothing added up; it was too simple. Moriarty had already played that game at the pool, threatening him to control Sherlock.

“Maybe she left it when she left her case. Maybe he took it from her for some reason. Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.”

He was controlling himself. Making himself more palatable. John winced and sat up. He put on his mukluks and started the water for tea.

That was one appealing part of letting a room with Mr. 'Sherlock Holmes'. Of anyone in the world to kill on accident in a flashback, Mr. James Moriarty was probably in the top-ten best candidates. The fastest way to a safer London was probably a single bullet through the skull of 'Mr. Sherlock Holmes', and John knew he wouldn't kill him on purpose. He wasn't an executioner. Justice required a trial, and a trial required hard evidence. He knew nothing of the specifics of Mr. Moriarty's crimes that an anonymous email hacker hadn't sent him.
Moriarty never noticed me, John thought, rejecting the idea. He was Sherlock’s pet, his plaything, never an enemy and never a threat.

bleeding buckets all over the concrete. He scooted back again and heard something tip. He looked back only to feel his heart jump as he scrambled forward, grabbing at the water bottle before it rolled out of his reach.
Sherlock stood up and straightened his suit, pulling his bland dispassionate mask back over himself. That, strangely, kicked John into feeling something.

Sally Donovan was an idiot. Most people were. Sherlock spun his phone around in his fingers, unsure she’d be clever enough to read the subtext there.

since killing someone in public is difficult, killing them in private isn't an option. Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then.

“Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Don't wait up!” He grabbed a small leather pouch from the kitchen table and exited the flat with a flourish, leaving John in the very odd position of sitting in a stranger's home having apparently just moved in.

“That they did,” he answered proudly. John shook his head, impressed despite himself. Sherlock passed his own figurine to the conservatory without rolling
his blue eyes wide and lost. His pupils were dialated correctly - not likely currently high. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, only to stop short, and
John wanted to spend their one night laughing, telling jokes by the stove, reliving old stories of clambering over rooftops and shooting emoticons into

"Yes, I have," he answered. "I thought that was fairly obvious." John felt his shoulders fall with relief and Sherlock smiled, apparently pleased with

Brian stopped the cab in front of him on Harrison street and James ducked inside, already pulling a Crunchie bar out of his pocket as he closed the door. His heart fluttered in his chest. He was being an ass. It was a nerve-racking risk. Dr. Watson was almost a perfect fit for his needs; an exceptional field surgeon and an even better sniper. Men like that didn't get shot out of the army every day.
John shoveled out his pile of frozen caribou, relishing the time alone. The air felt thinner, easier to breathe without company. Even Sherlock's.

“Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?” John asked, waiting for Moriarty to catch up with him.
Sherlock threw himself onto the warehouse floor to sit crosslegged before the accountant boxes. He was never going to understand his partner.
And he needed to get something to eat. Surely there'd be nothing in the house, with Sherlock living here alone. Hopefully Mrs. Hudson would be home. It
John winced and threw the mail back on the table beside him. Sherlock looked up from where he was running a finger over his long-abandoned books, the spines John had run his finger down, trying to find his friend in the PhD dissertations and studies there. Sherlock frowned, watching John's face, and John smiled grimly. He heard Mrs. Hudson reach the top of the steps and turned to face her, glad for an excuse to look away from the man.
"I should go. I should have left…awhile ago," he said instead, starting to sit up from the couch, careful not to use his arms.

At the moment it didn't matter why. He was here and Moriarty was nowhere to be found.  Unsupervised, as soon as he'd wanted to be. John cursed under his breath. There was still a half-dozen police cars flashing their lights around the building, same as before. How had the man caught a cab out here?
John blew out a heavy breath, glancing around the little graveyard where he'd cloistered himself, waiting for Sherlock to come and acknowledge their

Sherlock swung his legs up and around to sit up on the couch, focusing fully on him now for the first time in weeks.

“I’d watch you shoot him and we’d move on,” he replied, yawning, and closed his eyes again. John laughed softly, chuckling into the dark, and to his surprise, kept giggling, a lightness ballooning up in his chest that he hadn’t felt in years. Sherlock’s eyes snapped open. John ran a hand over his stubbled face, reveling in the fact that they were alive, in 221B, in bed together.
Somehow John couldn’t muster up the anger he’d expected. He sat down at the kitchen table. Mycroft stayed standing, looking only more uncomfortable.
“You must be hungry. Indian?” he announced, just before he swept from the room. He’d never even taken off his coat and scarf, John realized, hearing the

A force officer came out of the building, back through the kicked-in door, and approached them finally, looking grim.
It was a daft move to open one of Aunt Laurie's email attachments, even if she did occasionally send e-cards full of family pictures and unwarranted financial advice just to get people trusting her again. As soon as his video player opened John braced himself for another video of her cat's distended anus. The video opened on the shaky footage of a light-haired young man racing down the street, pulling on his backpack as he ran. The video was silent, but the lad looked behind himself for a moment, his eyes wide with fear and his mouth open in a shout. John propped his chin on his hand, expecting a man in an inflatable T-Rex suit to run into the frame.

Two men carrying a full body bag on a stretcher walked out of the building, heading for the ambulance. Sherlock strode for them.

Sherlock stalked Lestrade in the parking garage outside Scotland Yard. John watched him approach the man from the darkness. He stayed crouched by a support beam, kneeling in a long-since-dried puddle of human urine. Sherlock always did have to be dramatic. They'd had to disable three different overhead florescent lights to get this corner as shrouded as it was. Ridiculous, but John could feel his heart beating wildly in his chest and he loved it.
Or was it not an alias at all – was 'Sherlock Holmes' the man's true birth name and James Moriarty the fraud? He'd have to try to find that birth certificate.

Lestrade jerked back in his chair as Sherlock suddenly leaped away from the table, all motion again. He barreled about the room, talking under his breath,

“Jesus, Sherlock,” John cursed, his back searing in pain. “What was that about a count of three, then?”

Moriarty smiled then, amused by his own secret joke, and John held his gaze, feeling like he'd just been handed battle coordinates.
Moriarty was clearly involved in this murder as more than a 'detective' – he'd never have the suitcase otherwise. But unless he was carefully framing someone – and had killed the four victims himself to do so – what did he gain in solving a case he'd arranged? And why drag John along?
So no, Mycroft couldn't control Magnussen. "He's a businessman, that's all. And occasionally useful to us. A

John confirmed, breaking through the back bark of the trunk and separating his first bit of log. He sidestepped, centering himself over his next cut, and

John thought, approaching with Sherlock. Neighbors were standing on their porches on either side of the crime scene home, peering at Lestrade.
There was more story there, John knew. He remembered Sherlock's face, when the man was mouthing off about their school days, as if everyone hating the

Molly didn't seem to notice, though. She walked around the room, stuffing the evidence bag into one of the lab's refrigerators and typing it up a label, not even really appearing to notice if he was still there.
There was a good possibility that it was common knowledge that friends didn't often learn a foreign language for each other. Which was a strange statement,
he wondered, picturing the genius scratching cryptic messages into a hardwood floor and cutting up the nails of his victim. It'd been a struggle to keep his composure upstairs, so suddenly struck by what he'd already known about James Moriarty but had forgotten in only a few minutes of laughter in a cab car.
“Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out-” John stopped, hearing too late Moriarty's simultaneous confession 'so I went straight ahead and moved in'. John hesitated awkwardly, only too aware that he'd just insulted one of the more dangerous men in his country – and Moriarty did look remarkably affected, turning around in the little room and rushing to collect some of the unopened letters scattered about.
“Sounds exhausting,” John replied, feeling like he was expected to say something. He didn’t want to talk about how Sherlock had felt when he’d gotten that

"Mycroft?" John asked finally. At least Sherlock couldn't be too serious with this woman, if she did not know his brother's name.

So she wasn't afraid of Sherlock, not really, or she wouldn't antagonize him. She had nothing on him but a bad feeling. That was unfortunate. John continued walking toward the main road.

Nor did she really deserve it anyway. “Sorry, I'm so sorry. It's just sometimes this bloody thing...” he hit his leg with his cane, hating how the knee didn't even twitch at the blow.
Sherlock didn't say much until they'd been seated at the Chinese restaurant. Then he practically turned on, leaning forward suddenly and starting to speak

Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce and Harry is a drinker,” John summarized honestly as the cab car peeled away, leaving them deposited in what looked like a very industrial suburb of London. To his incredible relief, the dead-end road was flashing with cop cars. Not a good place to go quietly shoot a new flatmate.
“Malamute,” John corrected again and Sherlock smirked. Mrs. Hudson swallowed and pulled her hand away, her eyes catching on the two of them again.
