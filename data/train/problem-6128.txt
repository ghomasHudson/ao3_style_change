“I don’t lack self-esteem most days, but right now I just feel really, really… extra beautiful,” Tash says quietly.
Later, when dinner has been served and Sharon and Tash are making their rounds, saying hi to guests and drawing their attention, Tony grabs Carol as nonchalantly as possible and pulls her outside, into the hallway and out of view of the ballroom.
“Morning,” Steve greets, sliding into the passenger side and taking a quick glance to the backseat to make sure Tony remembered their gift from where it was left at his apartment yesterday.
He nips at Tony’s jaw playfully, but Tony pushes him away gently, just enough to get him to stop, but not make it seem unwelcome. Lord knows none of Steve’s advances will ever be unwelcome for Tony. “We have to talk about something. Honestly, and openly, okay? No getting offended, or angry. Promise?”
“I thought you might say that,” Steve grins, “so I have a wedding day present for you, too.”
Smashing his face into Tony’s shoulder to quiet his laugh, Steve gives Tony’s bicep a squeeze with his other hand. When he pulls away, Tony feels bereft, as if Steve’s touch was fire on his ice-cold skin, and he craves to have it back. But Steve is straightening up, and the coordinator is waving at them to go, so Tony plasters a big smile on his face that surprisingly isn’t difficult to conjure, and they walk out into the aisle.
“Coy isn’t the word I would use, but whatever. I thought Steve was bi?”
“A duck tour?” Steve asks. “Like, looking at ducks?”
“That’s quite an accomplishment, Tony,” Peggy laughs. “Your parents must have been so proud of you.”
Steve sighed. “Maybe. Let’s just- which of these do you like better?” he asked, pointing to two flowery balloon designs.
When he’s finally collapsed in bed, watching old
Tony keeps his voice similarly quiet. “Really? Well, Natasha was calm and collected the whole time. Or at least, that’s what I’m supposed to tell people.”
Tony hesitates. “Yeah. I came out, and they didn’t like it. But I guess things were always bad… before that.”
“I don’t know, I wouldn’t notice. Unless, oh my god, you’re a total screamer,” Tony suggests, wagging his eyebrows.
“I am the devil on my own shoulder,” Tony declares.
“Maybe I am. I’m tired from work, sorry. Could we do this tomorrow morning? I guess my brain doesn’t really have the capacity to think about partying when it’s been so focused on Microsoft Excel all day,” Steve says, suddenly sounding very exasperated.
Except that.
“What, like-like him? Why’s that got you in such a tizzy?” she asks, brows drawing together. “That’s a good thing.”
“Me, you, Sharon, and Tash are doing brunch with Peggy today; I hope you like seafood because this is Boston and we’re seafood people here.”
“I think you know that you already have,” Natasha says, smiling sadly. “Be brave, Tony. Nothing good happens if you just sit around. Do you remember that I rejected Shar the first time she asked me out?”
“That’s because it’s dumb to make appointments to talk on the phone. God, it’s like you live in 2005. Do you need help with that bag? I hope not, because you look like you could bench press three of me, and I build robots to pick things up for me so that I don’t have to.”
Steve huffs out a long breath. “Kids seem pretty far away right now. I haven’t even had a date in a year.”
Tony falls silent. He knows Peggy is just being nice, trying to prompt him to launch into some knee-slapping story about his parents putting up with his antics when he was a toddler prodigy, but he actually doesn’t have any stories like that. The only thing that comes close is when he made his first circuit board at four years old, and thought his dad bringing a nice woman over to ask him questions about it and take his picture meant that maybe he’d finally done something prideworthy. He knows the truth, now, that Tony was never going to please Howard because Howard was just never going to care.
“It was very sweet,” Sharon grins, “She dropped the ring when she went to put it on my finger.”
“No, that was a one-time thing, I guess. You’ll have to convince him to finally free himself when he gets in tomorrow morning, mom. He always did have a soft spot for his Aunt Peg.”
“The one that looks like boobs, duh.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony mutters, refilling his cup.
Across the table, Steve acts like he’s not listening in to them, engaged in a conversation about the different types of crab with his Uncle Michael, but he’s smirking. “Actually, something tells me I’ll be the one trying to keep up with him,” Tony confesses to Natasha.
, but when he brings this up Tash just starts calling him “bro of honor” instead and it becomes a running gag. He is also quite possibly the worst person on planet Earth to be entrusted with typical wedding duties like planning a bachelorette party, given his propensity to forget all names, dates, and small details that he really shouldn’t, but Tash counters this by saying that he’ll make up for it when they go dress shopping, since his fashion sense is better than anyone else she knows. She’s not wrong.
Tony keels over he’s laughing so hard, and the lady next to them at the angelfish tank shoots Steve a dirty look while shuffling her children away in a hurry.
When they get back to the dock, Tony notices that the crowd has thinned out a little. Sharon is by the door, hugging people as they leave, and Tash is waiting right inside, leaned up against a support beam with her arms crossed. Once he steps out of the boat, she’s coming to meet him, encircling his arm with hers and dragging him away from the group.
It makes Tony feel better that Jan cries, too, especially when Tash steps into the heels that Jan lent her to be her something borrowed. They’re hidden under the dress, but they elevate Natasha’s height so much that she is officially taller than Tony like this. He only hopes that she remembers all the practice they did walking in them and doesn’t trip going down the aisle, which would be embarrassing for everyone involved. Of course, if anyone on all of the Earth can make a fall look graceful, it’s Natasha.
“Yeah, maybe,” Steve replies, watching him go.
Steve shrugs. “This is a painting for my cousin. It’s not- this would never be hung up in a museum, or anything.”
“I wasn’t late, Steve,” Tony says, pointedly ignoring the hand. “Acknowledge that I wasn’t late and apologize for assuming I would be, please.”
“Thank you,” Steve says gently. “No to the duck tour. We only have about two hours until we need to be back at the hotel for the rehearsal dinner, so we might as well just go ahead and get ready.”
After a while, they get lunch in the aquarium cafe, outrageously expensive, of course, and Steve splurges for a plastic whale-shaped cup with a straw that looks like water spitting out of its blowhole. He says he thinks it’s funny, and Tony agrees with him once he sees Steve drink out of it. It’s completely hilarious.
Days used to have names, used to form narratives and constellations. There used to be someone to sit beside to gaze up at the vault of heaven and count the stars.
“No, Tony.”
“You two ready for that?” Spencer asks.
“It’s not for you to fix,” Steve snaps. Tony always does this, offering too much even as he steps back, makes it impersonal. He’ll spend hundreds of thousands—often
Of course Tony knows what it’s like being disabled, just as well as Winter, Clint, Misty, and so many others on campus do. Steve feels like an asshole.
The thing with Tony’s face swallows. It seems to be at a loss for words.
“I don’t suppose I can talk you out of whatever foolhardy scheme you’re cooking.”
“Guess they were too distracted by that super-soldier body squished into that tiny little suit,” Spencer says, his tone so steadily maintaining its usual grumble that it takes a moment for Tony to catch up with what he’s saying. “You responsible for the tailoring on that thing?”
“Don’t think I will,” Tony replies, still walking toward him. Hell if he’ll let some tenderfoot stop him from going in his own front door. Around them, the wind stirs up scrub and dirt in its hurry through town.

Five thousand four-hundred fifty-four breaths. Five thousand four hundred fifty-five. Five thousand four hundred fifty-six. Five thousand four hundred fifty-seven. Five thousand four hundred—
Steve, being Steve, says Tony would never endanger civilians so foolishly.

Whoever’s responsible for this is going to pay. This is a pointed cruelty. Steve won’t let anyone get away with using Tony this way. “Why are you wearing his face? Tell me!”
“The things you talk about sometimes—forcefields and jetboots and—”
Sam nods at him as the SHIELD agents lead him back to the prisoner transport.
A hellmouth, Tony discovers, is a helluva lot more than just a mouth.
“Later,” Steve says, voice quiet. He takes Tony’s wrist. “Please. I missed you. Let me just have you to myself a little while longer?”
After that, it all goes to hell.
- A real word which means an ardent reader of bookworm, though in this case I’ve used “bibliophagic” poetically to suggest eating a book with a fork and knife
The line is blessedly quiet for a moment. Then Parker says, “Are you still seeing Ms. Potts?”
“You had two coffees at the diner and a coffee shake at Harold’s. It’s a hot chocolate, which has plenty of caffeine already.”
Steve hasn’t told her what Jan told him. Natasha hasn’t mentioned knowing about it before now. But already she’s talking about it like they’re on the same page.
"Hmm," Tony says with exaggerated slowness, like he's weighing his options. "You'll probably have to stick around to make sure I hold up my end of the bargain."
I don’t do that.
Steve’s permitted to attend Tony’s funeral. He’s uncuffed before he delivers his speech. He’s not sure what he says. He meant to plan it, but words wouldn’t cohere in his head, and now he’s at a podium, and he can hear himself speaking, but he isn’t listening. By unspoken agreement the audience pretends that a week ago he didn’t try to kill Tony himself.
The picture Tony paints of Project Wideawake is horrific. And still not the point.
“Don’t start with jewelry, you have to build up to it. Flowers are good. Steve likes big peonies, the kind that grows all over France and Italy in the spring. He’s always been a sucker for flashy shit when it comes to romance, so you’re in luck. But don’t take him somewhere too fancy or you’ll make him uncomfortable. And give me a call if he fucks up, I’ll kick
ha, ha
She meets his gaze with hard, red-rimmed eyes. Standing up to him in a way few people dare—the way Tony did.
Steve could ask how Tony knew he was hurt, how he knew where to look, how he was able to arrive in time. He knows Tony won’t answer. “I—you didn’t have to come yourself.”
The other me couldn’t stop talking about Tony OR Iron Man, and Iron Man was right there.

and I’d be a murderer.”
Steve pushes himself to his feet. “Good thing you’ve got me, then.”
“What can I do fer you, Sheriff?”
“Wonder away,” Tony says with a grin. “What do you want to know first?”
I tried to text jarvis too and it didn’t work. I think it’s the wifi in here
Steve has no hope of seeing Tony again. Even if he believed they’d be together in death—and Steve doesn’t believe that, can’t allow himself such a grim hope—he has too many responsibilities. People need a hero. People need Captain America. He won’t see Tony again.
“They will kill you, too!” Danvers says, like he doesn’t know that.
He doesn’t know how he’s done this job as long as he has. He doesn’t know how he’s still standing. He should have flickered and blown out, like a guttering candle—like a dying star.
“Mr. Stark is unavailable,” JARVIS says.

The dildo gleams bright against the dull navy blue of Steve’s bedspread. He shifts on his feet and the gold twinkles at him, and it’s like—fuck, it’s from Tony’s armor and it’s sparkling like the light in Tony’s eyes, like sunlight glinting off the armor, like a repulsor beam bouncing off vibranium.
Tony sets the box down and before Steve can process what’s happening, pulls him into a tight hug. There’s still a cheese knife in Tony’s hand, conscientiously held away from Steve’s back, and this strikes him as darkly funny. Didn’t that anthropology professor say that hugs started as a way to prove you were unarmed? Or maybe that was handshakes.
“Sure,” Sam says. “Just don’t forget I took a class on close reading and modern poetry last semester. I hope you appreciate constructive criticism.”
rhodey
he could have said on a rooftop, in the wee hours of the morning in the old library, soaring above Manhattan, during a stolen moment in Tony’s office.
After they eat, Tony says, “Can you tell me what city we’re above right now?” and Steve reaches out and holds Tony by his wrist, resting his skin against Tony’s soulmark.
I don’t know how though
“Oh. I’m glad to hear that.”

“Whatever. I wanted to see you, and now I have, so,” he starts to stand.
“Yep.” Jen smiles. “C’mon, at least now you’ll know it’s being done right.”

Steve goes back to work. He answers no questions about his restored strength and youth. He worries that everyone guesses—or knows—how he got it, but he can’t tell if there’s any evidence of that or he’s just paranoid.
Nonetheless he is sure that it is not, by any means, a horse.
Steve learns several things in quick succession. One: that Tony, Reed, Xavier, Namor, Black Bolt, and Strange have been meeting in secret for years. Two: that there’s a dead Skrull in the room with them, and before it died, its presence was undetectable to Wolverine’s mutant power, Strange’s magic, and Spider-Man’s senses. Even now, Reed’s tech can’t recognize it as a Skrull.
It turns out what Steve wants is to bend Tony over the bed, slick himself up, and fuck between his thighs. He bites Tony’s shoulder when he comes, drawing blood, and laps it up as he starts thrusting again.
Stark smiles, turning one half of his mustache up like the hand of a clock. “Is that what we’re doing?”
The sixth day of his trip, the temperature rises to nearly 90F. The restaurant attached to the inn is little more than a glorified covered patio, and his waitress spends the whole morning apologizing for the heat. He finishes his omelette and walks out to the beach. It’s packed, and no one is dressed like a local.
“You can’t be found here, if someone—”
Tony sighs. There’s a comforter and a quilt and a sheet and of course all their clothes between them, but they’re still pressed against each other, Tony’s lower back nestled right up to Steve’s waist, and Steve thinks he can hear Tony’s heartbeat. Or maybe it’s only his own. His hearing isn’t at peak levels right now, after all.
Steve frowns. “Weird how?”
“I didn’t give any money to the GoFundMe for her wife’s cancer treatment.” Tony turned his tablet off and closed his eyes. “We don’t pay our staff very well, but healthcare is reasonably priced. It was a small donation. I put it under my name. She’s probably as far away from her wife as possible. They didn’t make their fundraising goal.”
Tony should try to grab it. Use it before Steve can.
HUNGRY
We’re not sure what century it was when you guys were here, though.
Taking this for the cue it is, Honton clears his throat and stalks away.
I imagined the Mrs. Williams mentioned briefly to be Riri’s mom, no relation to Simon, who in 1872 is a bad dude working for Governor Roxxon.
“How’s the coverage looking?” Tony asks. After fielding the last questions and making his goodbyes, he’d only had time to glance at a news aggregator during the elevator ride up to the penthouse.
Tony takes his hand. Steve can feel his sleep-warm skin, his pulse beating in his veins. Alive, Tony’s alive. He tells himself that’s all that matters. That, and the words Steve should have said years ago. “Last night—I was trying to tell you. I love you.”
“As if,” Tony scoffs. “I’m your best bet at fixing whatever AIM did to you.”
They stop for short rests and drinks of water, and then a longer one for some bread and apples. Tony budges over so they’re sitting pressed close. When he finishes eating he rests his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Nah, hold up a sec—how’d you even hear that comment?” Hardison says. “You been on our comm lines, Stark?”
Steve used to owe his body to the US Army. They’re the ones who fixed it for him, turned it into a weapon. So he used it as one, and pointed it where they told him to.
They used to be friends. Tony can’t stop reminding himself of that. But this is what Steve thinks of him now.
, Wong was right there. I told you from the start: a wizard did it.
“And you just left him there?” Steve growls, already grabbing his things and jogging out the door.
“You’re shaking,” Steve says. Tony can hear the smile in his voice. He grabs Tony by the hair as he crowds closer. His other hand rests on Tony’s throat. It feels big enough to wrap all the way around his neck. Tony swallows against it, and Steve leans over to kiss him.
The weird music has stopped, too.
“They said you’d get it,” Steve insists. “That it’d be your vision of the future.”
yes actually!!!
His eyes fall shut. He can’t bring himself to reply, but he thinks she knows his answer.
“Too much Twin Peaks before bed?”
“Tony, wait!”
“I’m sorry. Steve, I’m so sorry—”
“Me too,” Steve says, and squeezes Tony’s left wrist, hard enough that it twinges even after Steve’s gone, pain alongside the buzz of his soulmate touching his mark.
“It’s going to sound strange.”
“Of course. And if—no one wants to see you on trial for treason. You mean something to people.”

Tony’s hands come to Steve’s arms. “Okay.” It’s hard to see the expression on his face from this close. “Okay. What are we doing?”
“I understand there’s a book you’re interested in, and it so happens that I know where you can find it.”
Tony makes that single, sardonic, not quite laughing sound he does when he pretends not to care what people think of him. “How far back you wanna go, Cap?”
Right. But you think we’re compatible romantically?
“‘And more,’” Steve quotes. “That’s a succinct way of saying ‘sexual assault, defamation, criminal negligence, and obstruction of justice.’”
I appreciate it.
“Rhodey has a crush on the new liaison from the Air Force,” Tony said.
“‘Thank you for coming,

“Eating Vision’s cooking seldom is,” Natasha agreed.
“You're never gettin’ rid of me now, Rogers,” Tony says.
– A blow, a fight with the fists
He thinks his muscles might vibrate out of his body. Jen’s still talking, and Steve can hear her, but she sounds like she’s speaking over a beehive. “He didn’t want you stuck in a cell. He would’ve done everything he could to get you out.”
The next time Steve opens his eyes, Jan and Pepper are spooning on one of the deep sofas. T’Challa is curled into a ball like—Steve can’t help but thing—a cat. Jen has somehow sprawled even further, one leg hooked over the back of the couch, the other bent with the top of her foot resting on the ground. Natasha’s sitting mostly as before, except that her spine—still straight—is tipped at an angle from her hips, so her head and shoulders rest on the back of the couch. Rhodes’ snoring is the only soundtrack to the silent video flickering on the screen: a dog, sitting at a table with their human with a tower of Jenga blocks between them, then carefully leaning forward, using their mouth to tug a log out, before leaning back, block still resting between their teeth, tail wagging.
Meanwhile, Sharon and Natasha are both sobbing outright, each grabbing a handkerchief from the first person who offers and dabbing their eyes with it. “You two made that?” Sharon asks, her voice tinny from crying. “It’s so beautiful. I’m going to hang it above the fireplace, oh my god.”
When Steve sees it all, he just laughs and says it’s exactly how he pictured Tony would live. It’s either a huge compliment or a total dig at Tony, but he can’t be sure which.
“They will,” Tony chastises. “So, you’ll probably be able to tell which part he did and which part I did-- duh, ‘cause I’m not an artist--”
Natasha is as poised and regal as always coming down the aisle, completely steady on her feet and holding a bouquet of soft pink flowers. There’s no one escorting her, because she doesn’t feel the need to be escorted, instead, going alone proves that this is a decision
“I totally didn’t have any of that written when I came this weekend,” Steve says. “It was last night at the rehearsal dinner, after you left, that it sort of all came to me. I was talking to Sharon, and I guess she sort of-- saw something, on my face, and then before I knew it I was spilling my guts to her. And she gave me really good advice, and then I got to thinking about all the other times I would’ve been lost without her, and the rest sort of spiralled.”
“Please. You said yourself that Friday helped get you through the breakup with Ty, and if I’d gotten you cigarettes, you would have caught one whiff of them and thrown them out. I know you.”
Steve heads down the hall to Sharon’s room, shooting Tony a thumbs-up for luck as he goes. As soon as Tony steps inside Tash’s room and is met with an explosion of makeup palettes and rejected accessories, he realizes he’ll need it.
Reaching for a chocolate pastry in the middle of the table, Tony takes a small bite before answering. “His new apartment here in Boston.”
The whole thing is a stroke of genius on both Tony and Steve’s parts. The ladies are going to love it.
Tony is at a loss for words. He’s never even had a boyfriend willing to pack him lunch for work, let alone move to an entirely differently state for him. It’s absolutely insane for Steve to be suggesting this, really-- but then again, his explanation makes sense. He seems sure about it. If there’s ever a time to start over in a new area, it’s when you’re transitioning job fields. And honestly, hasn’t their entire relationship been a bit spur of the moment, despite Tony’s heart telling him that it’s been waiting a while for Steve to come along?
He doesn’t say anything else, but his eyebrows pull together in a pensive way. Tony hopes Steve knows that despite all the teasing remarks about his job, enjoying your career is legitimately important to having a happy life, and without that piece, something will always feel missing.
“What do you mean?”
“Okay, fine,” she agrees, encircling him in her arms and allowing him to lean over on her shoulder. It immediately relaxes him, burrowing in the space where her collarbone meets her neck.
Steve shuts him down as fast as he possibly can. “I’m very uncomfortable with this conversation.”
“So, what, you think having a boring job is the right thing to do? Your kids will never have to worry like you did, as long as they don’t notice that you’re totally miserable?”
The decorations are a Tony and Steve joint effort from a trip to Party City they took after brunch earlier, despite how Steve complained the whole time about his artist’s instincts yelling at him for purchasing flimsy paper streamers and aluminum balloons rather than doing something more creative and personal.
So basically, he’s really happy that they’re getting married, and he’s going to do everything within his maid of honor powers to make sure that his girls have the greatest weekend of their lives. Even if that means following Natasha around Sears for seven hours on his day off from work while she tags things for their gift registry.
Tony dissolves into laughter, and catches Natasha giving him an odd look, with a little smile like she knows all his secrets. He closes his mouth immediately.
Sharon and Tash show up arm in arm in stunning dresses, looking every bit the put-together, chic couple they are. The group cheers, and Sharon curtsies jokingly. The party kicks into full swing, then; people dancing and chatting and munching on what look to be painstakingly hand-rolled finger sandwiches, provided by the restaurant. Tony had told Steve during one of their phone calls that the party had to be catered, because he doesn’t like cooking and also can’t be trusted to do it without setting his kitchen aflame. Steve had just laughed, and agreed that they should hold it at a restaurant so they can get other people to do it for them.
“Right, and tonight is the bachelorette party.”
He wants to be able to look at someone like that, one day, and for that someone to look back at him the same way.
family, too, and they support him even when he’s being dumb. But realizing that he has a crush on Steve doesn’t feel like a dumb thing, it feels like a really, really big thing, despite his brain yelling at him that it’s only been two days. Because in actuality, it’s been a lot longer than that, and Tony thinks that ever since their first conversation when Steve mistook him for a Jehovah’s Witness, he’s been heading towards this conclusion.
“I don’t think you’re a slacker. I’ve just been joking around with you, Tony, I hope you know that.” Steve’s tone couldn’t be more sincere, and he meets Tony’s eyes like it’s really important for him to understand this.
Peggy orders a mimosa, and Tony tenses up just the tiniest bit. He’s responsible for his own sobriety, he knows that, and after a couple failed tries he’s now on a good streak, no longer feeling like his chest is going to cave in if he doesn’t have a drink when he gets stressed out. But it’s just… easier, if he doesn’t have to think about it at all. Natasha hasn’t even kept vodka in the house since Tony finally committed to staying sober, and she’s Russian.
When it’s finally his turn, he climbs in with Maria, Carol, and Jan, who was fashionably late as always, with her new boyfriend in tow. Tony thinks his name is Hank, and it’s clear he’s perfect for Jan the second he hands over his phone for her to take pictures with, as her own is perpetually out of storage.
Tony chortles. “That’s- pretty accurate, actually. You really get me, Rogers.”
“Okay, um. The last time I had sex, I put my fist through the wall by accident and my landlord at the time, who was my ex-girlfriend, had to come fix it. She definitely knew what it was from.”
“Alright. Want to… hear about something cool I’ve been researching?” He expects Steve to say no, because most people Tony’s met in his life don’t care all that much about his science babble and in fact actively root for him to not talk about it, but the guy nods excitedly like this is what he’s been waiting all morning for.
“I know that,” Tony replies, rolling his eyes. Emotions make him itchy sometimes. “I should be asking you if you got your part done, considering you barely had time for five minute phone calls with me.”
They decide that it would be nice if as many people as possible that Sharon and Tash requested be invited could come, so it’s best to do the party on the wedding weekend itself. Tash already made it clear that she doesn’t care about having alcohol at the party, because she’s always looking out for Tony, and Sharon understands, too, so there’s no hangovers to worry about while they’re trying to have family brunch the next day or something. Tony is outvoted on the strippers, but he catches Tash smirking at him even as she says no. He knows she would’ve enjoyed it, and she knows he knows.
“Is this going to be your new lockscreen, Steve?” Tony jokes. Steve doesn’t answer, which is very telling.
“That might be a good thing,” Tony jokes. “If it was in a museum, I would never go see it. This way, I can enjoy it every time I go over to Sharon and Tash’s to pester them.”
especially not steve?
“We talked. Not about anything Avengers related, past or present.”
“We’ll both stop,” Steve says. His reply is so simplistic, so mundane that it barely corresponds to the question it’s meant to be answering. It’s jarring after Steve’s earlier fury, laced with determination and forced calm.
“Hey,” Winter Soldier says when the meeting’s ended and everyone is standing up to leave, “wanna hang out while I practice?”
“A year? For treason and sedition?”
you and steve, man
A car from a rideshare app takes Steve to North Beach. He rents a little powerboat and spends the time it takes to reach the island not thinking about anything. Once he’s out on the water, he eats the pizza he bought from a street vendor at Fisherman’s Wharf. It’s cold and congealed and probably wasn’t any good even when it was hot and fresh, but it’s been awhile since he could eat crap without worrying about the consequences, and he wants to indulge himself while he can.
Steve works himself as leisurely as he’d run his hands over Tony’s body. “I saved the footage,” he says. It takes Tony a moment to remember what he’s talking about. “I can show you, if you like.”
“You look great!” Jan cries. She tugs Tony closer to her and lifts her phone to take a selfie. “This is going on my Instagram. It’s a one-of-a-kind Janet Van Dyne piece!”

“Yeah,” Tony scoffs. “

“Well, the Department of Time is in touch with its future divisions, of course,” she begins.
Steve’s gasp turns into a whine, and then into Tony chuckling against his lips. Steve hurries to kiss back, realization surging against him like a hit that doesn’t land—like a strike against vibranium, the force of it absorbed into the resonance of the metal.
Steve’s back on the Raft now, hunched over, numb, exhausted. And he misses not so much the certainty of his anger and pride but the intensity and confidence of it. Emotions are distant. They don’t sit properly in his mind or his heart. They manifest instead in his body, in his eye sockets, under his ribs, in frost forming over his skin.
“Don’t worry about him,” Tony says, not bothering to look away from the woman in front of him. His snakes his hand down the back of her dress as he kisses down her neck. “He’s just here to watch.” He unhooks the woman’s bra and tosses it aside, then adds, “You can touch him, I guess. And come on him. I like to aim for his pretty face.”
Tony gave a small half-shrug. “I’m over it. I never will be. I won’t need time to process it and think about it. I don’t think we can figure it out.”
“Did you mean it?” Steve asked, making Tony bristle. “When you said you would trust me, and what I decided. Did you mean it?”
rhodey?
On seeing him, Natasha—careful not to lower her weapon or let her guard down—said, “James?” Her voice was a step louder than she’d intended.
I’m not right there next to you seeing everything that’s happening, but I think that’s a good thing
We haven’t seen any robots. What kind of robots? Not Ultron?
“Is that
soulmate?”
“That says good things about our team communication,” Tony observed quietly.
“Okay.” Steve closes his eyes and lets his head fall back on the top of the couch.
He’s talking to the other Skrull. Steve knows that. It’s not really Tony. It’s not.
it was really late by the time everyone got out and jan said no one was allowed to talk to her until after she’d had at least two hours alone with tony’s cheese fridge
The first time Steve saw Tony’s cheese fridge, it went like this:
But of course it’s part of it, it’s part of Tony, it’s part of every moment he shares with Steve.
The fella in white stands and turns to face him, not bothering to hide that he’s tossing the room. “Are you a friend of Mister Tillard's?”
“What I don’t get,” Sam said, “is why you two—a tech genius and a strategic genius—are still trying to talk to each other.”
still scrolls and clay jars
Their reemergence has been spotted. Mugwort and Slovenwood are pointed their way, looking mad enough to swallow a horned toad backwards. Steve aims his gun at Mugwort, who’s closest; Tony ignites his gauntlet and blasts a wall of fire across the ground separating himself and Steve from everyone else. Mugwort reels back before righting himself and regarding the fire with disdain.
no another one in another universe
Right. Tony forgot himself. He doesn’t have Steve’s friendship back.
“But I already have one.” Steve grins and snakes a hand down Tony’s arm. “It even has my name on it.”
“No,” Steve says, hating this turn the conversation has taken. He hates being reminded how fragile Tony’s health was before the arc reactor, about the shrapnel that’s still lodged inside him.
. That’s it exactly, Cap. You know me so well. Jesus, did you even tell anyone you were going on this mission? You didn’t, did you? Is it—” he cuts himself off. “Look. I know I—fucked up. It’s been, it’s been shitty, you’re on the run, and that’s on me, so, you can just—tell me what you need and I’ll get it for you. Or get you the money for it. I mean, I can’t get you back into the States, I’m working on it, but I know people out here. Don’t—you can’t just—”
“No, I’m good, I checked to be sure,” Steve nods. “Are you driving again?”
Their plates are eventually cleared away and the night starts winding down, but Steve hangs back to catch up with some of his and Sharon’s family members. Natasha has to stay, too, out of obligation, but Tony escapes and decides to head home for the night. He’ll make apologies in the morning if anyone gets mad at him for running out, but he’s honestly just completely wiped after this whole day. He wants to sleep for a thousand years, and he probably would if it wasn’t his best friend’s wedding tomorrow.
“I want,” Steve confirms, leaning forward to peck Tony’s lips again. He chases it, though, pulling Steve back in, deepening the kiss and straddling Steve’s abs to get a better angle. His hands fall to Tony’s ass as if on instinct, yanking him up just the tiniest bit more. Tony goes wild for it, moving to kiss his way down Steve’s neck, planting his lips on every beautiful inch of it. He wants to do this to Steve every day.
they didn’t even seem to be that much older than us!!!
“What little girl?” Tony tries to follow Steve’s gaze across the park, but the streets are empty. The fog is back, thick and tinged with the rusty orange of twilight.
Great! I’m glad you’re safe for now
“No,” Steve said after a moment.
“Fine,” Tony grouses. He takes his phone from his coat pocket and pulls up the app for the only pizza place in town that delivers. “But I’m buying.”
Another gunshot rings out. It sounds like Rogers' gun, or one like it.
“And don’t mind being photographed with,” Spencer adds. “So make sure the veil is coded to someone you can stand to gaze at all doe-eyed.”
Each time Tony visits, Mugwort and Slovenwood are sitting at a poker table. Night after night they come to the saloon and the hotel to play their cards in silence; they’d probably be sitting in the casino, too, if it hadn’t gotten itself burned down nigh on a week ago. They don’t say a word when they catch sight of him, but the way they look at him is enough to set his stomach churning.
hey so the room we just walked into has a lot of windows and skylights
He’ll do it again, Steve repeats to himself. He’ll do it again. This is the most comforting thought of all.
The slapping sound of his hand on his cock grows wetter and faster. His fist grazes Tony’s skin now and then, a soft pressure against his ass that makes Tony whimper. Steve groans in response, like Tony’s moaning in pleasure, egging him on.
“Think of it like community service.”
Hi Doreen!
we totally made out behind a reference desk!!!
Sudden as a grasshopper’s jump, Virgle’s hollering goes quiet. Light flickers from his chest, like he’s got a gas lamp where his heart’s supposed to be—and then it ignites into flame. Quick as it was lit, it snuffs out again, and Virgle crumples to the ground, a hole in his chest bigger than a prize pumpkin. Blood oozes out of him like an afterthought.

. “Is this—is this why you’ve been so angry? You thought—” he breaks off.
“‘When the time comes, the world will still need heroes. It will still need you. And when the fighting is over and history is written, I can only hope we will be remembered as more than just heroes.’” The letter’s almost over. In a matter of seconds, Steve will go back and sit beside Jen, and if he’s lucky, his mind will shut down again. “‘I hope that we will be remembered as I will always remember us: as friends.’”
, and so far he hasn’t said anything Steve hasn’t heard before—but Steve’s got time. He won’t let Tony leave these grounds until Steve knows everything about registration that Tony does.
of course you do
He’s working out in the Power Gym when Loki saunters in and leans against his treadmill.

Pepper sends a bouquet to Steve’s office. He’s never been given flowers before, and he’s never seen a bouquet like this. It’s huge, a patchwork of textures, shapes, and sizes united by color: crimson peonies with honey-colored centers; golden marigolds with scarlet shot through their petals; flame-like birds of paradise; branches of plump kumquats; and red and yellow gerbera daisies mixed among them all.
Tony doesn’t get to say this, not now. This is a humiliation too far.
of course he doesn’t think that
Steve nods, even though Tony can’t see him. “Okay,” he says quietly. “I can do that.”
He knows what she’s asking. This is where the two of them reminisce about their best friend.
“Message?”
Deals 950 damage. If the target has dealt the most damage on the enemy team, deal 1200 damage instead.
It’s cold enough that Tony’s breath comes out in a mist that mingles with the low, close clouds.
They’re halfway to Apple when Red Wolf says, “What'll we do with the silver? We're not sending it along to Governor Roxxon.”
Tony opens the door to the bedroom. Alicia steps inside, and he follows after her. It’s just Steve’s bedroom, walls the same real-estate-agent white as the rest of the house, utilitarian black-out curtains over the windows, empty other than the old-fashioned bed, a single nightstand, and a pair of matching dressers. Steve’s tidied away the small piles of clothes that usually litter the floor, leaching it of some of its warmth—some big, thick rugs would help with that, Tony thinks—and made the bed with military precision.
“It sure is,” Mayor Hill says.
“Will do,” Hardison agrees.

“Ooh, I’ve heard of those,” Sam puts in.
“You could anyway, if you wanted,” Tony says. “But that’s not what I was thinking. I was thinking something you’d actually feel good about.”
Too late
Wormseed tilts his head, reminding Tony of a barn cat watching a mouse. “I’m in your charming town to find a certain book. It was stolen from me, you see, and when I heard tell that it was in Timely, my associates, as you call them, accompanied me here to retrieve it. Do you know where my book is, Mister Stark?”
There are white lies, like, “I can’t see the scar at all, even when I look for it” or "That color looks great on you." There are lies to manipulate and control, like, “It’s for your own good,” or, “For the glory of the USSR!” There are lies we tell out of love, like, “It’s nothing to worry about.” There are truths omitted out of fear, twisted out of envy, inverted out of malice. There are lies we tell without words, lies made out of our bodies and clothes and the frightened expressions we wear on our faces even as we lift the gun out of our mark’s holster without him noticing us cut through the ropes tying us to a chair in an abandoned warehouse.
James scoffed.
these looked like they were made by the same props department that worked on the first season of Star Trek
“Nah, I’m sure they’ll be on soon.”
He snatches it off the bed and slides it down the flat of his tongue until it hits the back of his mouth. He closes his eyes and groans around the dildo. Swallows around it. Around a piece of Tony.
Steve doesn't point out that Stark's not wearing one. “We’ll figure out who really done it, Stark. Just a matter of time.”
The longer he tells the story, the further Stark loses himself in it. He becomes a clucking wild turkey, then the carriage that it had just flown into, then a dog swimming through a pond. By the time roller-skates finally make an appearance, Steve’s laughing so hard there’s tears coming out of his eyes.
“What?”
When Steve meets Tony’s eyes, he wears an expression that Tony hasn’t seen before, not closely; he’s avoided looking directly at it. It’s the way he looks at Tony across a battlefield.
“The coffee grinder at the general store’s broken,” Steve says, setting it down beside a bar of iron and an empty whisky bottle. The grinder is some newfangled contraption of Stark’s, run off wires and magnets and conductivity.
that sounds really cool actually
.” He can’t even lift his shield right now. He doesn’t want to contemplate it.
“Uh, yeah, I don’t know exactly what kind of spell we’re under, Cap,” Tony said.
yeah! the sunbeams were incredibly prominent and felt really significant somehow
For Wanda’s Purim party, Tony dressed as an astronaut, Steve as a cowboy. Wanda and Vision were both dressed in Hogwarts robes with Gryffindor colors, leading many on the team to speculate that they were Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter, respectively.
“Wait,” Natasha said. “Steve, look at me. What’s going on?”
Hi Sam! You could say that. And I hear you did, too!
“Hello, Steve.”
“It’s his ass,” Steve says sagely. “It’s hypnotic. Reporters get so distracted they forget to be total shitheads.”
An argument breaks out. Is this an invasion? Is this war? Is this their fault?
and stop texting me he still gets paranoid sometimes!
By the time they’ve finished tracing their way across Tony’s back, he’s shaking from the effort of keeping his feet under him and remaining still.
Steve and Straughan walk Daisy over to Stark’s so she can be shod. They don’t need Steve’s help getting there, but Clive doesn’t comment and seems to enjoy the company. Maybe between him and Stark, they can convince Clive to get all new shoes instead of just resetting the loose one. Straughan's always riding in and out of Oak Creek and having her shod by the farrier there, who doesn't fit his shoes properly. She’d do much better with all four shoes of good quality and hammered in by someone who’s actually up to trap with a hammer and forge—and at that, Stark’s fine as cream gravy.
you didn’t need to cockblock me
“Don’t—” he begins to say, but Tony’s already opened it.

James took her hand in his. Tangerine-colored sunlight reflected off his metal arm. “Okay.”
“What the hell is—oh my god is that—oh—oh fuck—Friday call Steve wait no DON’T—”
“No earlier than usual.”
Another voice, a woman’s, maybe Hill’s, says,
Tony goes slow, telling Steve how good he was, the way he didn’t interfere in Tony’s fun, how he laid back and acted as decoration for Tony’s little party. Steve sobs with the joy of Tony’s cock and gives himself over to Tony’s praise.
He has the run of the place, from the grand ballroom with the stone-carved fountains to the stables where Apple is happily being kept, but there's little to do but sit and tinker and fuss in his rooms. His host is somewhere about as well, and they sit together for suppers at a table long enough for Jesus and all his disciples to sit along one side and still have plenty of room for their elbows. The few times Tony steps outside, it's to visit Apple. They share bites of her namesake and he brushes her down like a show horse.
rhodey and I are like one minute away I swear
A huff from Wong makes Steve turn. “Where you takin’ that thing?”
“No one should let you two run a superhero team,” Rhodes said, laughter in his voice.
“I know,” Tony says, though he’s not sure he does. “Uh. It wasn’t just you. Really, we didn’t tell anyone, not even Sue or Medusa knew.”
guys?
“So what happened?”
“Then we’re done for now.”
“I forgot to mention,” Sharon says, after they’ve stuffed themselves and planted their butts into the couch for the night. “I finally got a hold of Steve, after literal weeks of phone tag. He works way too much, and he hates his job, so I don’t know why he won’t quit. But anyways, he says he’ll be my best man, even though he can’t get up here before the wedding weekend itself. I told him it didn’t matter, that Tony would take care of me too. Right?”
Without alcohol and without strippers, it’s definitely not a typical bachelorette party, but there’s karaoke and other party games, and honestly, Tony knows that Tash and Sharon would both just appreciate a few hours spent with their friends after all the hectic wedding planning the last few months. Still, he doesn’t want it to feel lackluster, or like there’s something missing, so Steve had the inspired idea to rent a little speedboat, which he has a license to drive, apparently, and take it out on the water throughout the night on little jaunts around the Bay to look at the night lights of the city.
After Steve takes another five-second shower and throws on his suit so that he doesn’t have to worry about it later, they go back to Tony’s place, because Steve says he feels like he doesn’t have room to work in his hotel room, whatever that means. The apartment is kind of a wreck, since Tony lives alone and doesn’t have a reason to keep his exposed wires and heat-sensitive metalworking tools hidden away like he did when he had roommates. Half-finished projects are strewn all over the living room, which doesn’t have any furniture besides his workbench and a couch he fished out of someone’s trash a year ago that sinks to the floor when you sit down in it.
Eating breakfast in the car on the way to Steve’s hotel takes quite a bit of effort, but he ends up running a few minutes behind due to his absolute lack of desire to yank his own lazy ass out of bed, and he doesn’t want to have the punctuality debate with Steve again. He texts him to let him know he’s downstairs waiting, and Steve steps out of the revolving doors immediately, like he was waiting right inside for Tony to pull up. He probably was.
“It’s so nice to meet you, dear, officially,” Peggy beams down at him.
“Is he really still not pursuing art?” Natasha asks incredulously. “We all saw that mural he did for the church.”
“If Steve is your angel, who does that make your devil?” Carol asks, bemused.
already queued up on the TV. Tony’s theory that she’s actually a godly saint disguising herself to see what mortal life is like continues to hold water.
“You know you sound like your soul has been sucked out by a vacuum literally every time we talk, right?” Tony asks him, in the middle of one of their phone calls when he mentions putting together a document of all the possible guests and Steve audibly groans.
“It’s true. Usually, I act as Tony’s voice of reason, conscience, and general life coach, but it’s been nice to have to burden off my back lately,” Natasha grins.
“Thank god,” Natasha says, spinning around in her chair at the vanity to face Tony. “Which lip color? I think the red is too intense, but Sue says it brings out my complexion.”
So Tony’s first impression of Steve is nothing too strong, although Steve probably thought Tony was borderline crazy, which is what most people think of him. Sharon promises that he’s awesome, though, and Tony obviously trusts her, even though when they next talk, all of the slightly teasing remarks are gone from Steve’s tone and they focus solely on planning the party and the details therein, no matter how hard Tony tries to change this.
“Yes, we are,” Tony insists. “We talked on the phone while I was in the shower. That makes us friends.”
“No it’s not,” Tony argues, “because there’s no way he likes me back. We literally just met for the first time on Thursday. Why am I like this? Why, Carol?”
As the conversation turns, Tony sneakily reaches down at pulls his phone out of his pocket.
“I know how loyal you are to your girl Brooklyn,” Tony says, “so I’m glad you’re able to admit that.”
“Fun’s not over yet,” he responds. “If you want, we could do a duck tour, or we could hit up Dunkin’ Donuts. That’s the most Bostonian thing you’ll do this whole trip.”
Giggling, Tony bites his lip. “But you said-- at the aquarium? That we’re friends.”
“Well, you missed my Uncle Michael completely bursting into tears when Sharon gave him a hug. I think you would’ve found that funny.”
“Okay, why do our conversations always seem to circle back to this? Let’s go to lunch. We can be early, I don’t mind,” Steve breathes out, beginning to stand up and reach for his tennis shoes.
making, knowing it’s the best one imaginable and not needing anyone else to guide her there. Always so independent, but never alone, either; Tony steps forward to take her bouquet, and she thanks him quietly.
“I’m sorry?” she blinks. “What new apartment?”
There are no interruptions, or hesitations, or attempts to pull away other than to get the necessary amount of oxygen before diving back in, and even then, they stay close, foreheads touching and lips only centimeters away from each other.
“This feels really ostentatious,” Steve chokes out at the California King bed, all-tile bathroom and plush carpeting soft enough to sleep on. They’re high enough up that out the windows lies a sky view of Boston worthy of photographing, and god, does Tony love his city.
“Why would I do that with you sitting right out here?” Steve mumbles.
Being much more organized and schedule-oriented than he is, Natasha had called ahead to make a reservation, but as soon as they’re seated, the waiter asks for drink orders, like he’s trying to hurry them through their meal to get through the people in line. Tony doesn’t blame him; he had to work a minimum wage job for a while, but he was completely unsuited to deal with finicky people pushing him around and demanding things from him. Those that can deal with it and still provide good service are a mystery to him.
“I might have to set you up with someone,” Natasha admits, pressing her lips together. When Tony starts to interject, she continues on, saying, “You just always look really sad about third wheeling!”
“So, wait, you guys have known each other since high school?” Steve asks.
“Okay, fine,” Tony acquiesces. “Seriously though, why do you get so worried about money when you clearly have a stable job? I thought the whole point of not pursuing art stuff was so that you would have a steady income, right?”
“You’re an amazing artist, Steve,” Tony tells him. “You’re really, really talented. I hope the reason that you’re staying at your boring job is really about finances, like you claim, and not because you think you’re not good enough.”
At the end of the night, when Tony pulls up in front of Steve’s hotel, they high-five for a job well done. “Good bachelorette party means good marriage, right? That’s how that saying goes? The ladies should thank us.”
“Exactly, that’s why it was a disaster.”
Next comes Sharon, donned by her mother on her side. For her, having Peggy there to give her away is a thank you for all the years spent raising her to be such an amazing woman, and Sharon kisses her cheek before joining hands with Natasha. The priest steps up, the music stops, everyone takes their seats, and these beautiful people that Tony loves so dearly begin their life together with two simple words.
Thus, the party comes together, and then all of a sudden, the week of the wedding is upon them.
Steve is there, looking radiant with a red boutonniere, the chosen color of the wedding. He breaks into a dazzling smile when he sees Tash, coming to give her a hug before she takes her position at the back of the line. Tony and Steve are walking together right before her, as the best men, and the rest of the bridesmaids line up how they’re supposed to, arm in arm, two at a time.
“Yeah, it does,” Steve whispers slowly, moving back in. Tony meets him there, and this time, he’s not breaking away for anything. “Do you think they would hate us if we left right now?”
They’ve lead really similar lives, in an odd way, which is maybe why they understand each other so well. Why Natasha gives him the ice cream first, and lets him pass it over to her when he’s good and ready.
“So without further ado…” Steve says, pushing open the hall doors just as someone inside announces on the microphone,
They shamelessly pet stingrays alongside five year olds in matching bright yellow shirts advertising some kind of summer camp, and the lady working the exhibit-- who looks so overly excited to be here Tony knows she’s faking for the paycheck-- lets Steve hold a starfish. He makes Tony take a photo.
“I live in Boston. You live in New York,” Tony says, as plainly as possible. “I want to be your boyfriend, but--” he shrugs, “--that’s gonna suck, won’t it?”
When Tony sees Steve standing all by himself over by the drinks table, cradling a Coke bottle in his hand like a lifeline, he waves him over enthusiastically. Steve shakes his head, but Tony stomps over to him determinedly. “This is a party, Steve. You don’t have to chain yourself to the sidelines, no one’s gonna want to go out on the boat until it’s dark. Come dance.”
“Do you know how happy I am for you?” Tony whispers to her, meeting her eyes in the mirror.
“I know, I’ve missed out on so many extra days of Tony time,” Steve replied distractedly, looking at the price of some kind of glow stick necklace. He frowned, and slid it back onto the shelf, apparently having deemed it far too high.
Steve, the total Boy Scout that he is, comes to knock on the bathroom door to let him know they have five minutes, now. Tony deems his appearance as good as it’s going to get, and opens the door.
“I never knew you were a modern genius.”
“Oh, so that’s something that’s actually in your daily vernacular, then?”
Eventually, it’s speech time, and Tony has rehearsed his in front of the bathroom mirror so many times he knows it by heart. There will be no going off script romcom style, after he spent so many hours writing and editing and re-editing this speech.
“Is that your job, the one that you keep telling me you love? You build phones?”
“Really?” Peggy gasps. “Are you two flirting?”
“Tony, I have to say, this is not the party I expected you to put together,” Maria confesses. She works with Tash, so he peripherally knew her for a while, until she was officially inducted into their friend group when a guy tried to grab Natasha’s ass on the subway and Maria socked him in the jaw. Tony high-fived her afterwards.
“Thanks,” Tony beams. He doesn’t mention the fact that it’s left over from when he had regular duties as the Stark heir to attend horrifically boring benefits and fancy parties, and that it still fits because Tony is twenty-five years old and his body has somehow remained the size of his sixteen year old self. It doesn’t matter. He knows it accentuates his legs in just the right way. “I hope you didn’t muss yourself up too much in the last hour.”
“So do something about it,” Tony nudges him. “It’s that easy, Steve.”
“I know, we should’ve put money down,” Steve jokes.
“Uh, bathroom.”
“It was a really good speech,” Tony says, nudging him. “Better than mine.”
“Do we need an ironing board?” she ponders.
Inside the main building, the dining hall and adjoining suites have more of a lodge feel to it, complete with walls built from large stones and big chandeliers of some poor animal’s antlers. Tony remembers being kind of put off by that when he toured this place with Natasha, but she said the rustic feel was what she wanted, because it reminded her of Russia a little bit, and even if she left her old life behind, having some part of it at her wedding would be a good way to symbolize the new life she’s about to begin with Sharon. It was all very touching.
“Tomorrow- Friday- night is the rehearsal dinner, but during the day you can do whatever. There are a couple good art museums that I wouldn’t be caught dead in, but the ladies would probably love to take you to.”
“What Tony is trying to say,” Steve cuts in swiftly, his arm winding around Tony’s shoulders casually, “is that it was a labor of love on both our parts. I know I’m not always the best with words, so for me, at least, this was a way to put my love for you guys into something tangible, and memorable. It was Tony’s idea, a brilliant one, and… yeah. I had a lot of fun making it.”
“Correct, and it’s going to be fantastic, our shared brilliance has put together what is quite possible the bash of the century.”
He also gets pulled into other wedding planning duties that he really wasn’t intending to help with, such as hunting down addresses and picking fonts for the invitations, and touring vineyards upstate when it’s not too unbearably hot out. Admittedly, Tony does enjoy the cake tasting, though. He even gets to bring a slice home, and it’s what he takes for lunch to work the next day. All of his coworkers are jealous, especially Bruce, who got married to his high school sweetheart at city hall when they were nineteen and thus never had a proper wedding cake. Tony shares a tiny bit with him.
“I loved the party. Thank you, Tony,” she says sincerely. “The surprise was great, too. I’m sorry for poking fun at you for talking to Steve so much.”
They decide to leave Tony’s car at the hotel and take the T to get to brunch so that he doesn’t have to pay for parking. Because the Boston public transit system is light years ahead of the New York Subway, and no, Tony isn’t biased at all, they arrive on time, meeting up with the ladies outside the restaurant. There is a round of more hugs, particularly between Peggy and Steve, who dwarfs her but still looks like he can’t breathe in her embrace. Natasha and Steve have met before, but only briefly a couple times, so they shake hands and exchange pleasantries too.
“That seems overly sane. We’re millennials, we’re the generation that was fed ‘follow your dreams’ bullshit from the second we left the womb,” Tony remarks.
“I think you’re mixing up several different superstitions and then also adding your own spin on it,” Steve says. He moves to pull the handle of the car and step out, but waivers. “Hey, um, I know you said we have tomorrow morning free, but Sharon is tied up with some- wedding stuff, and believe it or not, I actually don’t know Boston all that well, so would you maybe want to show me around? We can do anything. I know you said you hate museums.”
reruns on his phone to mellow himself out, he gets a text from Steve.
Tony knows that Steve probably knows-- when they were planning the bachelorette, he never once brought up purchasing alcohol or hiring a bartender. It’s Sharon’s doing, of course, but it made things just a little easier on Tony, which was nice.
“Okay, before you guys go in,” Tony says, halting Sharon and Tash as the rest of the bridal party continues through the doors into the reception hall. “Steve and I sort of want to preface our surprise gift, so that you understand it before you see it.”
Parting ways when they reach the altar, Tony and Steve move to their respective sides of the arch. They’re directly facing each other, though, and they have matching dizzy smiles. Steve winks at him, and Tony’s heart skips a beat.
“You don’t have to. You’re young.”
“Lord, was that a euphemism?” She lowers her voice even more. “Is he a total bull in the sack? He seems the type.”
“It’s sort of supposed to symbolize how you two are, like, great on your own, you’ve both accomplished so much in your lives and are such amazing women, but at the same time, you were always meant to be together. To support each other, and love each other. Personally, I think that having someone in your corner- it pushes you to do even better things,” Tony describes. Natasha tilts her head at him, the corner of her mouth twisted ever so slightly, like she knows exactly what he means even if he can’t say it quite right.
“Sharon’s always saying that you should be doing art stuff. Are you any good, or is it ‘bunny in a snowstorm’ art? ‘Cause I gotta tell you, I’m not sure we can be friends if you consider that talent.”
They’re forced to part ways pretty quickly once they arrive an hour later, passing off their gift to one of the event managers at the vineyard to make sure it’s put in the proper place for the reception while they’re busy doing other things. It’s a beautiful venue, even with the sun just now poking up over the horizon, alighting the rows of neatly-trimmed plants lining the footpath with a hazy glimmer. In the distance, Tony can see the pristinely aligned white folding chairs facing towards a silver arch that Sharon and Natasha will be getting married under in a few hours. There are workers scurrying around out there, placing programs on the seats and setting up audio equipment, presumably for playing the wedding march.
“I don’t know, but you really need to calm down,” she says. “Here, sit. Why would you think he doesn’t like you? It seems to me that you get along really well.”
Tony wishes he lived in a world where he, too, was ignorant to the atrocity that is duck tours. “No, it’s like a vehicle that goes both on land and in the water. You do a tour around the city, like landmarks, and shit. You think I would suggest something as boring as looking at ducks? I’m a little offended.”
“Wait, what surprise? It’s not here yet. I mean, it hasn’t happened yet.”
It’s a couple weeks before Steve finally picks up, but still not before a reasonable number of rings. “As I’ve said before, I’m Catholic, so I’m really not interested in becoming a Jehovah’s Witness,” he says, not giving Tony a chance for a word edgewise.
“Well, it looks like that won’t be necessary anymore. You’re going to be having some adventures of your own from now on.”
“You’re gonna kill it,” Tony tells Natasha, the last thing he says to her as an unmarried woman.
Just like that, Tony’s back to ear-to-ear grinning again. “Go ahead. I won’t stop you.”
“I think that Sue is the makeup artist that you hired and you should let her do her job.” Tony nods to the blonde woman standing over Tash’s shoulders, and she snatches both tubes of lipstick away.
The music cues up, and Tony hurriedly takes his place next to Steve. They link together, and Steve leans down to whisper in his ear so they won’t be disruptive, ever the kind gentleman. “Sharon almost jumped out the window with nerves, I think.”
“You kind of sound like you just want to have naked ladies there.” He doesn’t sound judgemental, but he also clearly isn’t purely cracking a joke for the joy of it. Tony isn’t quite sure what to make of that.
The room erupts into applause, and Sharon runs to Steve to wrap him up in her arms, whispering something private, just for them, into his ear. Tony, on the other hand, is stunned into silence. He’s pretty sure Steve meant
“You dated for seven months!” Tony defends himself. “You said he was the nicest guy you’d ever been with.”
It’s an exercize in modern torture, all in all, but Tony will never get tired of Natasha’s company so he endures it. It’s been six years, now, since Tony graduated with two doctorate degrees and left her in the dust while she steadily chugged her way through a bachelor’s in computer programming, and yet they still have sleepovers and go see rom-coms together and gossip about their bosses over Sunday brunch. Tony cherishes her friendship, and he hopes that she never stops annoying him over inane debates about whether fleece or Egyptian cotton sheets are the comfiest to sleep on.
“I appreciate it,” Steve mutters distractedly, looking at his phone. “Okay, what’s the schedule for today and tomorrow?”
“Well, I have an iron, but I don’t have an ironing board. I just do it on the floor, I have hardwood.”
Tony tells Steve to set up wherever he wants, and he ends up pushing the couch out of the way a little to make room for him to sit on the hardwood floor by the window. Quickly absorbed in his project, he doesn’t respond when Tony asks him if that’s actually a comfortable spot for Steve, so he guesses it must be alright.
“You’re finally relinquishing the radio?”
is on.”
Tony scoffs aloud, and Natasha gives him a funny look. Peggy and Sharon have moved into the kitchen to wash dishes without Tony realizing, so she scoots closer to him and looks at his phone over his shoulder. “Are you sure you’re not flirting?” she asks him once she’s done.
“What?” Tony asks. “Is he?”
“Not anymore,” Steve reasons. “I thought we already established that I’m quitting my job. Boston has an art scene just like New York’s, I can do that anywhere. And I want to be wherever you are, now. Plus, being close to Sharon will be nice, and Sam and Bucky are always travelling anyways, I barely see them. I like your friends, I can see myself hanging out with them. This makes perfect sense to me.”
“Stop being sensible and just feel bad for me, please.”
Steve takes a deep breath, like he’s preparing himself for an uphill battle. “It was about you,” he admits quietly. “I was telling her… that I liked you. You know. As… more.”  The wind rushes out of Tony’s lungs, leaving him gasping, and he feels unsteady on his feet. Steve is saying the one thing that Tony wants him to, so badly. His body shakes as he takes a half step towards Steve. “She said that it wasn’t crazy for me to like you so fast. She said she knew in a second, with Natasha, and that if you want me too, we should just… do it. Try it, and see--”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says immediately, and it somehow doesn’t sound cheap, coming from him. “I’ll say something uncomfortable too, if you want. Even the playing field.”
When Natasha asks Tony to be her maid of honor, he’s pretty sure she’s joking.
“Because I don’t hate myself, and I have a job I genuinely enjoy. Why don’t you quit?”
He and Steve are seated at one of the front tables with the other bridal party members, almost entirely made up of Tony’s circle of friends. Sharon and Natasha are sitting at the table to their left, with Sharon’s close family. Tony feels a small, short ping of sympathy for Tash; she doesn’t have any family here because she doesn’t have any family to invite. It fades as fast as it comes, though, since he knows she considers her friends her real family, and they’re all here for her.
"What happened that I don't remember?" Tony asks.
“Mm-hm.” Stark doesn’t look like he believes that for a second, but he fiddles at the casing with some tools until it pops open. “How’s the wild goose chase, then?” he asks, peering at the wires inside.
“You’ll let me use you however I want,” Tony says, like he’s agreeing. It isn’t a question.
yeah I’ll be sure to tell the interdimensional libraries not to bring us there again
Stark smiles. “Then I’m your huckleberry, Sheriff.”
“Bad point.”
Tony doesn’t have the strength to move. Even shifting his weight so he settles against the bedding ignites his body in a fresh wave of pain. He grits his teeth against it and tries not to think about what’s coming next.
“You match too!” Wanda accused when Tony asked her to teach him a correct levitation charm.
“That’s not what I’m saying,” Tony says quickly, annoyed and earnest at once. “I—if you want me there—if you really want to make it better—” He cuts himself off, rubbing a hand over his face.
“They had something to take care of at the pub, I think.”
Tony thinks about it. “Maybe not?”
hawkeye.
Steve chuckles and directs his attention entirely to Sam and the pool table. He’s lining up his shot when it happens—on the other side of the room, Tony is crouched on the checkered dance floor, his head between his knees. Jan is curled protectively over him, grasping his hands. The sound in the room shifts, like a radio station has been abruptly changed, the laughter and yelling over the music giving way to the distinctive cadence of gossip.
There’s one man who has barely spoken a word. His bare hands distinguish him among the men in their identical uniforms. His gloves are stuffed into his belt. There’s blood under his fingernails. Each time they need Tony moved, this man is the one to do it. He draws his fingertips down Tony’s torso. He runs one finger along Tony’s jaw. When Tony flinches, the man smiles and licks his lips. When one starts on Tony’s back with the cane, the quiet one wraps his hands around Tony’s waist to hold him steady against the force of the blows.
– An impressive person or thing
– An intimate friend, one’s right hand man
Tony looks up from the parsley he’s de-stemming into the compost bin. “Hmm?”
Rhodes stretched. “Nah, nothing special, just staying up to do our nails and talk about boys.”
no one ever needs a week to forgive steve
“Real soldier, huh?” Alicia says.
lemme check
if he has had any successful long-term romantic partnerships on this campus I am unaware of them. do you know of any?
But what happens next is that Steve returns with a mug of broth and a glass of water. He helps Tony drink both, petting Tony’s hair and watching him like Tony’s pained movements are mesmerizing.
so it means he likes me, right?
he definitely likes you
Stark's been worse since Bucky died. Steve’s not sure why, since he didn’t think they’d even met more than a handful of times. Still, it’s been a month at least since Steve saw him drink this much.
“That’s an objective statement, the antithesis of which can have only one meaning. Okay, right after SHIELD fell?” Steve nodded. “Before Ultron?” Steve nodded again. Tony took a moment to think. “Was it after this spell was cast on us?” Steve shook his head. “Right after?”
Tony obliges. “Good afternoon,” he replies.
“I don’t think I’d make a very good armor pilot,” Steve says.
Steve nods. “Like Thor.”
Pepper says, “Maybe Tony ran a company and worked as a superhero, but honestly, Steve, just getting out of bed and brushing my hair is a big accomplishment for me right now, and it’s already my job to keep Tony’s millions of employees from losing their jobs, working for Aleksander Lukin, or both.”
“We can’t keep going on like this,” Steve says at last.
“Don’t see as how there’s anythin’ left to figure out. That dark book of spells ‘n curses is ‘bout as real as the fortunes my busted contraption don’t spit out no more.” Stark tosses back a full tumbler of whiskey and signals to Nodding for another. “A man was arguin’ with Worley Honton in public time and again. In the very hotel where Honton was stayin’, even out in the middle of the street. Next thing, Honton’s lookin’ like target practice for a twenny-inch heavy cannon, an’ the only other fella on the whole floor of rooms is the one that’d been hollerin’ at ‘im.”
“Community service. Enforcing the Superhuman Registration Act.”

I know man
Jan snaps a pic of Tony biting into a Rhodes cookie with a rapturous expression on his face. His eyes are closed in elation. There’s a dusting of powdered sugar on his lips and chin when he finishes gobbling the cookie. Steve has a feeling that that expression—and Jan’s photo of it—is going to haunt his dreams.
It’s been years since Steve’s looked so happy. He’s so willing to be misled. How pathetic. Tony’s smile widens.
Steve draws out the foreplay this time, giving Tony time to explore Steve’s body, too, until Tony’s tasted all his favorite nooks and crannies, his back is lined with rosy scratches, and his skin is lit up like a circuit. Steve’s slow preparing him, too, like he knows Tony needs gentleness there. He positions Tony head down, ass up, and fucks him hard and fast.
“You would’ve done the right thing.”
The official team. The registered team.
He stomps in. Steve knows he can step lightly when he wants to, even in his wide jet boots. These loud, heavy footfalls are intentional. “I was worried about you,” Tony says, tromping toward Steve’s bed.
After a mine from an ancient battle knocks out the
“You know,” Barnes interrupts yet again, “we’ve never actually spoken before. At all.”
Wong is first to reach them. He dismounts with a disdainful look on his face and snatches up the book from where Steve's let it fall. “You ever listen to anyone other than yourself, Stark?” he asks, climbing back into the saddle.
“Wouldn’t work anyway, Eliot’s already burned his identity on Hammer.”
This is possible, but inadvisable. L-space exists perpendicular to our own relativistic reality. Prior to you observing it, we have no way of knowing where or when my own L-field will, at any given moment, connect to those encompassing the Archive.
If you know 1872 by heart or have read it recently, I won’t be offended if you skim until you get to the non-canon bits.
In one corner of the room, the man in the fancified white suit shuffles a deck that’s tall as a pint glass. He deals out an abundance of cards to each of them, and his stack’s barely half-gone. Whatever game they’re playing, it’s not according to Hoyle. The fella in green sets down the ace of hearts and the ace of diamonds. The man in black puts out a pair of aces too, and either the light’s playing tricks on Steve’s eyes or they’re both red, too. The one in white plays his cards next: another pair of red aces.
what, like “bite my shiny metal ass”?
Some stories have clear morals. The moral of every Baba Yaga story recorded is “don’t piss off Baba Yaga.” The moral of “Pinocchio” is usually interpreted as “don’t lie.” The moral of “The Frog Princess” is “don’t be impatient.”
So Tony replaces the panel and returns to the analog novel Steve him with. Steve comes back for lunch, like he said he would. He talks about his morning in vague terms, enough to chat about, but not enough to reveal what he’s doing or where they are.
Future divisions, Steve repeats to himself. What a way to run a—whatever it is. Organization or branch of government or bureaucracy.
Tony didn’t cry at his own father’s funeral, but now his eyes are hot and damp and it doesn’t fucking matter anymore. If there’s the smallest chance for Steve to forgive him—to see what Tony’s aiming for, what he’s accomplishing, what he’s staving off—even if all Steve can offer him is
He wakes up early the next morning and takes his motorcycle into the city. Sam is already up and stretching his wings, soaring high above SHIELD headquarters and the highest reaches of Stark Tower. The hedgerows and brickwork of campus soon give way to the concrete and dense bustle of the city, and Steve loses himself in speeding through town, weaving in and out of the sparse, pre-dawn traffic, lanesplitting and swerving and probably getting in a lot of trouble with Fury but having a great time doing it. He has hours before his first class of the day—he’d picked his schedule this semester with more of a mind toward a certain tech genius’ circadian rhythm than his own, meaning that even though they don’t have many of the same classes they’re roughly on the same schedule—so he drives all the way to Park Slope to his favorite bagel shop in all of Brooklyn.
“Who is this?”
“Can you tell me why you don’t want to try?”
Everyone who isn’t looking at Steve, that is.
The battle that begins this story was, at the time the Avengers completed it, considered a success.
The others are engaging with the Skrull duplicates—speaking, aiming, sizing each other up. Luke’s arguing with the Skrull impersonating him, Clint can’t look away from the false version of Bobbi, the Spider-Men face each other with identically wary posture, and Ares shouts at everyone to leave and let him handle the Skrulls on his own. No one listens. Instead, the two groups converge in a rush of voices and weapons.
“How’re you going to do that? A metal suit doesn’t seem like a great outfit to fight a fire-breather.” Steve leans in and breathes, wet and warm, against Tony’s face, as if to demonstrate.
and because of the magical and tech protections on campus and the archives in particular, it made the whole building kinda lock out of the reality that the rest of campus is in

, it’s like breathing to him. “You never let me stop you from doing exactly what you wanted.”
“Good evening,” Tony says when he is scant feet away from the figure. “Might I ask you to open that gate and let me through?”
why—”
One morning when Steve, Tony, Natasha, and Vision all ended up in the communal kitchen at the same time to make coffee and reheat boxes of takeout, Tony said to Steve, “I’m an impeccable judge of character.”
Steve—who was standing closer to Tony than was strictly necessary given the size of the lounge where the party was being held and the number of people attending it—shrugged. “Tony, I didn’t know what your costume was going to be.”
Steve wakes up the next morning in Tony’s bed. He wonders if Tony flew out and carried Steve back himself.
The instant before the Skrull reverts to its true form—sharp and inhuman, the same green as the jungle—is seared in Steve’s memory. This is what it would’ve looked like, that last fight of their war, if the first responders hadn’t pulled Steve away.
The third time Natasha had encountered James, she had been on a mission to the Forbidden Zone, later known to SHIELD as the Dead Zone. This radioactive area in Bashkortostan had been the site of Cold-War-era experiments in both nuclear physics and human genetics. Its use had been suspended after a fatal mistake in nuclear waste disposal destroyed the base. All history of the site had been publicly erased and disavowed.
There’s nowhere else Jan would take Tony if he wasn’t feeling well, and if they came from the Blasting Range, there’s no way Steve could’ve beaten them to the tower. “I know he’s here,” Steve says, hating how whiny his voice sounds. “I’m worried about him.”
The earth shudders a final time, a colossal heave accompanied by a clatter and rumble loud enough to be heard at the mouth of the Mississippi. Mugwort stumbles and Slovenwood falls, catching himself on his elbows and knees.

“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says. He can see the red in Tony’s jacket again and relief surges in his chest. He’s been seeing color since Bruce and Dr. Pym injected him with the antidote, of course, and as much as his returned height and bulk should be sufficient evidence in themselves, it somehow didn’t feel like the serum was really working until he saw Tony.
At the next team meeting, Tony was glancing over everyone’s online schedules, trying to find the best day for them to visit a children’s hospital, and saw that Steve was planning to attend the guest lecture on artificial intelligence Tony was giving at Carnegie Mellon the following month. “You checking up on me, Rogers?”
is there a magician in there? did they make all the doors disappear?
Steve’s expression is hard. His jaw works. He marches back into the ruined building.
, the circuits say to the tangle of veins and muscles and breath that the rest of him runs on. His blood pulses in reply:
A question Tony will not ask is:
“I try not to read other people’s mail,” Friday says brightly. Yeah, she definitely knew.
Tony grins.
actually if they’re on schedule they’re in the mirror dimension now
Well. Now Steve’s one step closer to understanding how they got here.
He remembers Tony undressing him, spreading him out in one of his many bedrooms, pulling the cheeks of Steve’s ass apart. The way he worked Steve open with toys, sloppy with lube, refusing Steve the feel of his skin until he shoved his cock inside, hard and huge and bare. He remembers the names Tony called him, the relentless way Tony took him, hour after hour, Extremis getting him hard again moments after coming, telling Steve about the way his needy hole sucked him in, how tight and desperate and then how loose and sloppy his ass was, how only Tony could fill him up right. He never touched Steve's cock, but didn't stop him from humping the mattress until he came, and kept fucking him into the wet spot like it hadn't even happened.
“What? Isn’t he doing those murals now?” Peggy asks.
Tash chokes on a sip of cranberry juice. “You know, I really shouldn’t be surprised.” She leans back in her chair, looking Tony up and down, impressed with him. “Congratulations, Tony. You’ve finally found a man-- probably the only one-- able to keep up with your crazy.”
“So, yeah, maybe I contributed some small part into Sharon ending up with Natasha. I don’t know how the world works. But, the more I thought about it, I realized that any advice I ever gave her, any favor I did for her, she repaid ten times over. This weekend, I met someone for the first time who’s already become one of my best friends, and it’s because of her. Even today, thinking about the painting that I did, there, and how happy it made me to do it-- like, there’s no way I can’t try and pursue art now. I have to, because there’s nothing else in the world that makes me that content. And I was holding on to my boring day job for so long, and I didn’t listen when anyone told me to stop, including Tony, who made many attempts. But it took Sharon, watching her be so overjoyed with my work that it literally made her cry, for me to
“It’s because you don’t have time, Steve. Because of your awful job.”
Natasha doesn’t say it in so many words, but Tony can tell how much she loves it, too, because she’s tucking into Sharon’s side, like the painting reminds her that she doesn’t have to long to find her person anymore-- her person is right here. Tash looks back at Tony, and her eyes are misty. She nods, once, and doesn’t have to tell him what it means.
“Low-key and strippers are not mutually exclusive,” Tony remarks. “We do dinner, we go dancing, and if a few shirts happen to come off, it’s all part of the fun.”
Steve had shot him a look, and then grabbed the other one.
Steve is dressed in last night’s clothes, albeit with the suit jacket and tie discarded, and there’s no way they both don’t look rumpled and disoriented. A neon sign is practically flashing over their heads, telling everyone who sees them exactly what they’ve been up to the last twelve hours.
Carefully, cautiously, Tony nods. “Okay,” he says. “Okay, sure. Move to Boston. I- I would love that, you know I would.”
Looking around at the restaurant now, Tony can admit Steve made the right call. The vaguely boob-ish balloons would have leaned into the whole “this is a bachelorette party for two lesbians” thing a little too heavily.
Steve sighs, like he’s finally accepting the fact that this is their topic of conversation now. “I went to art school, which was a poor decision. My plan was graphic design, but it didn’t work out, so now I’m a mindless corporate office drone with no future. You don’t have to tell me that, I already know. And, anyways, we’re not friends.”
Tony smiles softly at her. “You should.”
“Sure, if you want to call it that.”
“Fine. I’m not nervous, in case you were wondering, I just want to look good for the photos,” Tash continues loftily.
But he can’t. Because Steve lives in New York, and he lives here. Tony’s panicked reasoning to Carol about why he and Steve could never happen has been mostly shot down by now, but that’s the one sticky issue that remains. He slides off of Steve, and inches away just enough to get his breathing under control and clear his mind. They have to talk about this, it’s important.
He jumps backwards when he realizes Steve is still standing right in the doorframe, frozen with his eyes on Tony. “Wow,” Steve stutters out. “You look- good. It’s a, uh, nice suit.”
“Natasha said-” Tony begins, wrenching his mouth away from Steve’s so they don’t get caught up in each other again. He wants to say this. “She said I should be brave. That if I wanted you, I should just tell you, instead of assuming you didn’t want me too.”
“I mean, if you want,” Tony shrugs, playing it off just in case, although he figures there’s not much he won’t do to keep Steve around after last night. He thinks Steve might be feeling the same, if the twinkle in his expression is anything to go by.
“Yeah,” Tony admits. “I told you I was a genius, Rogers.”
“Among other things. I work at a little organization that uses technology to solve the world’s many problems, so basically I’m a real-life superhero. Right now, my team is working on AI for litter cleanup.”
“You ass!” Natasha laughs, punching his shoulder. “I just said something so sweet to you, and that’s how you’re going to respond? I’m leaving. Have a nice night.”
“Right, of course,” Tony snorts, looking around. “This isn’t a sign of nerves at all.”
“Yeah, that happened a couple times,” Steve mutters resentfully.
“What kind of place do you work that still uses Microsoft Excel? If you show your boss Google Sheets, he’ll probably promote you. Okay, sorry. I’ll let you go. We’ll talk soon.”
There’s a knock at the door, and when Tony opens it, the event manager reminds them they need to be at their places in five minutes, so they start trucking across the lawn, Tony holding up the bottom of Tash’s dress so it doesn’t get dirty before they arrive. Sharon’s party is already there, but she is conspicuously absent, probably hiding behind the bushes somewhere, although neither her nor Natasha is particularly superstitious.
“Go!” Victor yells. The flames are subsiding, the nebulous shadows within reconciling into the silhouettes of the three men. “Now, Stark!”
“S’pose so. Talked to a lotta people. People don’t care much what they say in front of the town spooney.”
“Alright, you two are going to Dr. Cho for some scans,” Rhodes said.
Steve says, “It’s exactly like that now.”
well, since you’ve asked so nicely:
lucky
He’s still wearing his armor, Steve realizes, as he, too, stares at Tony’s cherry-red gauntlets. Steve’s still in his uniform as well. No one has bothered to inquire about their weapons or any of their gear, either because they’re being implicitly trusted, or because the technology here so surpasses their own that they’re of no danger whatsoever.
like rain? or leaves?
If Sam’s noticed Steve’s distraction, he’s kind enough not to mention it.  “Why doesn’t the Academy have a Quidditch team?” Sam muses. “We’ve got enough fliers, after all.”
Steve’s heart soars at the way Tony picks up and settles in like their last words to each other were only seconds ago. Picking up where they left off. Some things, like this, have always come so easily to them.
A normal day in the Academy library then
“Yes, and I don’t know how, because you aren’t actually in my contacts, seeing as we’ve
Steve silences him with a kiss.
Tony scrubs a metal hand over his face. Steve can’t see the red of the gauntlet. It looks dull and wrong,
“I was there in the morning, too” Natasha says. “He didn’t seem to mind how he’d woken up.”
“I know terrible things have happened,” Tony says. He sounds too remote, even to himself, but it’s better than the raw misery it masks. “And I hate it.”
