Holmes strode toward Watson and took his friend’s coat into his hands, snapped it shortly into place. He smoothed down the doctor’s shirt, too. “It has been said, dear man, that what a spot of brandy cannot cure has already been cured. So, if all else fails-”
Holmes and Watson found Mrs Andrews, as her name proved to be, tending to the midday meal in the kitchen. She readily avoided eye contact, a habit that had no doubt been enforced through social caste within the household, and continued working as she spoke, bustling about and occasionally biting orders to other workers.
“State one good reason I should allow you to further accost me,” Watson said, before Holmes could assert something terribly cocky and inarguably charming, and he stole a glance of the detective from beneath his eyelashes. Holmes’s profile was obscured, hard to divine where the slope of his collarbone and shoulder ended and darkness began, and that was only fitting.
He nodded, his existence localised to a myriad of angular shadows and dark curves. “Absolutely, my dear man.”
“So?” Watson said, gesturing. He gripped his cane and turned away from Holmes for something to do. “What conclusions have you drawn thus far?”
She produced a handkerchief from her generous bosom and proceeded to dab her notably dry eyes before gesturing to her husband, who remained aloof. Her mystically-coloured skirts and gown-layers rippled, the visual effect vaguely nauseating.
That was the end for Watson; he came, hot and hard over Holmes’s hand with his mind spiralling and breath evaporating. He was extremely present in his body, helpless to the pulls of streaking pleasure shooting down his spine and Holmes rocking against him. He clutched at Holmes, gasping raggedly, hot open mouth snagging on Holmes’s temple.
An immeasurable warmth swells in John’s chest watching Sherlock coo over his daughter, a feeling far too big and deep to name. His breath is beginning to shake again, and he’s thinking in a fractured repeat,
,” Watson gasped as he jerked back in his bed. The detective stood idly, adorned not by his worn robe but by his crisp suit, flicking the end of his violin bow with one nail. His cool eyes, darkly rimmed, ticked up to the doctor’s with a coaly glimmer of amusement.
“You’re wonderful with Rosie,” John mumbles to Sherlock’s chest instead of anything else, noting how close they are when he can feel the warmth of his own breath bouncing back to him. “God, she’s going to adore you when she’s older.”
“We wouldn’t dare,” Holmes said. “And precisely how much money did you spend before resorting to grave robbing in the hopes of curing dear Colin?”
.” Holmes’s hand was tighter than seemed possible on Watson’s hip and that was fitting, the probable bruise-marks that would remain. Holmes had branded Watson in every other way and Watson really wouldn’t mind carrying the detective’s fingerprints on his hipbone.
They each moved with more intensity every moment, gritty friction and Holmes’s perfect grip, perfect slide and perfect pressure. Holmes fused their mouths together and then ripped away, attacked the doctor’s throat and moaned, “By heaven, Watson, I should like to go to my knees for you.”
“No,” Holmes said, finally breaking off for air. His hands were fumbling at the front of Watson’s trousers. “I thought you so dull as to miss
Watson had and did spend many a moment trying to dislike Holmes for the changes he had wrangled in him, for the pure simple fact that Holmes had been remodelling the doctor with his bare hands since their first acquaintance. It never worked. He was not perturbed.
Watson saw the glint of Holmes’s teeth in a snicker and wished to stomp on his foot, a grin of his own held tightly back, half delirious on these boyish, foolhardy instances of theirs. They relentlessly broke the social norms right beneath the noses of nobles and it was forthrightly addictive. “If you wish I can fix her a tonic, for any lasting issues.”
“Convenience, yes, Watson, convenience.” Holmes began sweeping around the room and examining things seemingly at random. Here, he intently studied the silver dish upon which the food had arrived; there, he licked at a notebook cover before sniffing deeply at its counterpart pen. All the while, his mouth ran like water:
Sherlock brushes Rosie’s hair from her forehead, his long pale fingers so gentle with her. John catches Sherlock’s fascinated smile before he breathes, “There we go. You mustn’t be keeping your father tonight, Rosie, he is in need of a well-deserved rest. Our tea will get cold.”
“That, and the good heart of a man who wields it without incentive.” Holmes blinked at him, luminescent in the lamplight, a dull golden halo around his shadowy form.
“Paganini,” he said conversationally, “is not infernal and incidentally, I play the piece precisely how it was written.”
The sickness was due to extended exposure to, and inhalation of, decaying corpses, Watson ruled after a few minutes’ examination and a rundown of the man’s symptoms. Quite simple and yet, quite deadly, and he spent the greater part of the next six hours concocting tonics for the illness and the pain, sending Mrs Andrews on ingredient runs when required with her pockets jammed full of Holmes’s money.
The detective’s voice rapidly increased in pitch on Watson’s throat, until he shouted, just once, sharp line of his teeth on Watson’s shoulder as Holmes pushed upward and finised. Holmes held their bodies tightly together, rocking through the pleasure, through the electric aftershocks, moving gently until the men were near the end of their panting.
“Well,” Holmes sighed, smiling wickedly. “What an anomalous creature you are, my dear man. Any decent person would have at least
Holmes chuckled shortly and Watson felt a hotness on the back of his neck, a certain prickling of his skull that came with the knowledge that he was still in his bed-shorts and Holmes was so tidy and clean and the world was fuzzy-edged around them.
“Her permission,” he says purposefully, holding his gaze with Sherlock, “has nothing to do with– this.” John swallows, feels Sherlock’s careful fingers against his cheek, takes in the graceful arch of his neck and the shallow movement of his chest. “With us. It’s about
Holmes had the decency to look affronted for at least a moment before he grinned boyishly, his eyes maddeningly alight and Watson simply could not bring himself to look away.
“I rather find my own reasons,” the doctor said, and pressed his knuckles against Holmes’s veins, felt the blood there rushing. Holmes’s heartbeat was rapid, and Watson thought,
Watson knew Holmes was itching for an audience and so dutifully returned his gaze to the detective, held back his silly grin at Holmes’s eccentric antics through only sheer force of will.
Watson thought he heard the whisper of Holmes’s violin bow on strings, and he hurriedly barrelled onward, “Would you stop that
Holmes huffed lightly and smiled sideways at Watson, making the doctor simultaneously feel like he was in on and the butt of some secretive, conniving joke. Watson ignored the heat on the back of his neck in favour of watching the wheels twist in Holmes’s eyes.
“Fine work this evening, old boy.” Holmes’s voice was rougher than usual, and Watson could see the faint blue veins that ran along the inside of his arm like a spider web. “Superb. Solved the case in, what, seventeen hours, with you as an immeasurable advantage at my side. Solved the case
“Come on, then.” John glances up to see Sherlock smile softly. “I don’t think I’ve even seen dear Rosie’s room yet.”
They didn’t talk much as they walked, lit up honey mead yellow beneath each gas lamp, and there was one instance when Watson glanced at his friend and found the detective appraising him with bright, sleepy eyes, a small curve to his mouth, and suddenly Watson was very aware of the feel of their arms pressed together. His grip on his cane tightened. This case felt very significant.
Holmes cut his scarf through the air as he was prone to and wrapped it firmly around his neck. “The only respect due to the good Lady Luxemburg is for that of her monetary insight; indeed, her daughter’s remains were stolen for money, although I do feel that the circumstances of the theft rely heartily on convenience and not status.”
John drops his gaze because it’s easier to control his face that way, and he also feels a bit absurd at the severity of the angle he has to tilt his head up to in order to meet Sherlock’s eyes. Heat creeps up his neck.
“Sherlock,” John says, in a soft, slightly stunned voice. He’s uncertain of what he wants to say next but certain that Sherlock’s mind is whirring, frantic with possibilities of the next few minutes. John feels unbearably shy all of a sudden, because this is
Watson pushed back to look at Holmes’s face, which was lightly red and bright as the sun itself, and he smiled so wide it hurt.
He immediately hissed, half choking on his drink and Watson grinned at the thought that he had caught Sherlock Holmes off guard.
Watson sniffed, satisfied for now. The floorboards beneath his bed creaked, and he thought that his chastising had landed somewhere of importance by how Holmes had not immediately resumed his playing. Watson thought sleepily of the days when he was not awoken by a tortured violin, or the flames of an experiment gone awry, or smoky hazardous gas from an experiment gone to plan. The dark smudges beneath his eyes may be ingrained now, but he couldn’t even pretend to want those mundane times back.
,” she was explaining, and had been doing so for the last half hour. She was seated in front of Holmes and Watson on uncomfortable but very fanciful chairs, everyone present clutching a hot cup of tea for dear life except the Lord of the house, who was standing rather remotely by their lavishly adorned fireplace. He cast them a vaguely despairing look across the expansive main hall, or perhaps that was his general mien.
“The maid had been crying,” he said, flapping a hand toward the kitchen. “There was a spatter of the latest cure-all elixir on her apron, about six drops near the hem, so it is not she who is ill but whomever she has been feeding it to; they do not have the strength to even sit up. They are very near death, I feel, and so does she. She needs money for a cure.”
“And to think!” Lady Luxemburg said, quite horrified. “I have to go through it all again with this recent crime.”
At one point into the night Holmes grabbed Watson’s arm and pulled him close, so Mrs Andrews could not hear his hushed voice.
. He knows what that means – he’s known ever since he met Sherlock, known something there, between them, was new and different and precisely the only thing he’d ever want to think about again.
racket, and at this time of the morning? There are some of us who do not enjoy the murdered renditions of classics come dawn.”
John is already shaking his head. Sherlock seems grateful for the reason to stop talking, which is out of character. He can feel the faintest tremble in Sherlock’s fingers where they touch John. John’s shaking again, his breaths deep and hurting his chest.
He wondered at the sight they must have made, how unbecoming of a man it was to be so expressive, particularly to a mere colleague. Watson thought that this was merely another irreparable change Holmes had instigated, this giddiness akin to falling off a cliff-face that Holmes always brought out of him, as though they were still schoolboys gallivanting about without the worry of having to act like gentlemen.
Lady Luxemburg shook her husband’s hand off her shoulder. “Nonsense, Edmund, I’m fine. No medication will be required, thank you Doctor.”
“Our, ah, our tea will be getting cold.” He sneaks a glance, can’t help it, and Sherlock smiles the instant their eyes meet. He looks like he’s blushing and John abruptly feels like a teenager, self-conscious and foolhardy. “Some crap telly, then?”
“The first wrongdoing here is that I, a mother, had to bury my own daughter those years ago. There truly should be a law against that, you know,” and then she gave Holmes a stern look, as though this was a legislative matter he personally had neglected. “Burying my own legacy, it’s just against nature. I could barely compose myself for any of the formal ceremonies, just ask Edmund.”
Sherlock tuts. “Come now, Watson,” he whispers, and it takes John a moment to realise he means Rosie. Sherlock shifts closer, the crib not very long so John’s side prickles in awareness of his proximity, and leans down slightly. Sherlock tugs John’s collar from her grip carefully, replacing it with the edge of the blanket every movement of the way until John is free and stands upright.
Holmes briefly closed his eyes, and then curled his lip, preening, and Watson thought that he was going to get spoiled if Holmes continued smiling like that, and so often. The tiny angle of his mouth was a hook in the doctor’s skin.
Watson knew the detective like he knew nothing else, not even his medical profession, and that was a vaguely disconcerting train of thought so early in the day.
Holmes’s eyes abruptly struck Watson as the blackest kind of lightning, and he said compulsively, “I should check those too,” and then nodded to Holmes hands, where there were many superficial lacerations. “In case a similar infection to Colin’s takes particular fancy to your blood, Holmes,” and he would have testified to the fact that he was joking, except it was proving exceptionally difficult to jest when the night was pushing them close enough to feel the warmth of breath as they whispered. Watson thought he saw Holmes’s wide, rare smile.
This auditory nuisance was rather customary of the man, expected even, but nonetheless Watson found himself quite cross as he jolted awake. He needed
to. John doesn’t think he can talk Sherlock through this one without working himself into a state; he’s not sure why. There’s nothing
Watson nodded, placing his hand over Holmes’s on his own forearm. Holmes released a breath, nodded shortly back at the doctor. “Very good.”
The detective’s lips fell open hotly and Watson pushed a hand into his hair, feeling abruptly hit over the head, drugged, stupefied and like he needed an anchor. He found the base of Holmes’s skull and curled his fingers there tightly. Holmes instantly pressed forward, jealously incessant as always, his hands flat against Watson’s ribs like a brand.
doing okay.” A breath; careful controlled inhale. “I just want to put my daughter to bed and make sure she dreams of something lovely and then watch crap telly, alright?”
Watson inclined his head, wondering if there was any point in inquiring how Holmes had gathered these clues. He opened his mouth, but Holmes was in the mood to speak in paragraphs, barely pausing for breath, the skin of his cheeks flushed a beautiful colour and his eyes huge flitting obsidians.
Predictably, Rosie’s started to make upset sounds at John’s hushed outburst so he turns half away, starts rocking her up and down just a bit. He feels Sherlock approach, the ghost of his breath across John’s hair, and then his incredibly gentle hand on John’s shoulder.
Watson and Holmes stood as Lord and Lady Luxemburg left, and the instant they were out of the room Holmes grasped Watson’s elbow to gain his attention.
It was, Holmes explained in the hansom cab, a case of a distraught mother and a stoic father and an abundance of ignorant socialites and unaware proletariat. One of mankind’s oldest tales, he thought, and Watson, my lad, isn’t it perplexing how the reign of humans shall forever be denoted as
John cuts himself off, because he can barely stand to hear the words he’s saying, let alone continue saying them. He’s told Sherlock, he’s not
“Come now, old boy!” He waved his hand, flicked his wrist elegantly at Watson’s curtain and a shard of hazed light illuminated the room. It fell across Watson’s bed and the doctor turned his face away. “The morn is nearly upon us – the sun certainly is – and who are we to deny nature’s timely clock?”
,” she whispered it like a dirty word, “stolen, how horrible. It’s for money, I am telling you Mister Holmes. My family is very
,” Watson hissed, furious, and then fused their mouths together forcefully. His fingers were at the buttons on Holmes’s shirt, pulling them apart without finesse or thought, the pale material collapsing to either side of Holmes’s torso and baring the smoothest of skin, untouched snow. Their lips parted with a sticky sound. “You thought me so dull as to miss my own infatuation with you?”
John takes his daughter agreeably, popping his lips at her as she grabs for his mouth and giggles delightedly. John smiles, tired, but loving the weight and warmth of his daughter in his arms, the sweet smell springing from her hair.
“Why do ye-” she whispered, blinking. “I. He, he works as a ground’s keeper, Colin does, for the Luxemburg mausoleum. But he is quite sick at the moment, he ‘asn’t been able to tend to his duties for perhaps a week now.” She swallowed. “So, so you see, ‘e wasn’t able to commit this crime, please don’t think of blaming my ‘usband for this theft.”
Watson felt faintly embarrassed, but not enough to taint the way Holmes was looking at him. “And I suppose you knew of my dedications, yes?” Watson pressed his lips together, attempting to look cross, and Holmes promptly kissed him until Watson would not have even attempted standing up.
Mary turned pale. She looked at John cowering before her raised arms and took a step back. And then another. But John couldn't see her, he still had his hands in front of face. Suddenly the rage drained from her and with a broken sob, she turned and ran.
Thank you to the wonderful Old Ping Hai, who has been super patient in me not finishing up Shift, so that I can begin working on her favorite AU, ballet!lock and rugby!John.
He avoided looking at the doctor for now. Sherlock was a known entity and therefore easier to predict.
"We have to dance for two hours straight with no time outs and no backup string if we get injured. I have seen dancers perform on broken bones, sprained ankles, and even pulled tendons. All while looking as graceful and beautiful as possible. The pain mustn't show on our faces. Our female principals who do pointe can break bones in their toes, ankles, and calves if they don't build up their muscles properly. I'm one of a few male dancers who can do pointe. It is painful and beautiful."
Sherlock offered to cook for John and perhaps play for him as well. John had been happily surprised when the dancer suggested it. He had been careful not to ask Sherlock to play for him after learning of Sherlock's distaste for being asked. So after being offered a chance to listen and to be cooked for, John was giddy.
John followed behind, still not sure what was going on. He ducked into the car when she held open the door, her nose still buried in her Blackberry.
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, the fire slowly dying as he struggled to understand that simple word. But he looked up when John walked through the door. Judging from the bag and the smell of warm food wafting from it, Sherlock knew that he had gone and gotten them dinner.
"We were on our way to Balmoral and because those two wouldn't stop making googly eyes at each other I decided to sleep through the sickeningly sweet glances. Little did I know I was putting my fate in the hands of the two most inept, directionally challenged idiots on the planet."
Greg pulled on the saddle strap to make sure it was snug and shrugged, "Why was it so hard to believe?" He stood up and dusted off his hands on his jeans.
Hey...how's it hanging? Wow, so the holidays, depression, AND this stupid chapter was kicking my ass.
"I'll talk to my mum, but no promises," Greg hedged. He looked down at his feet, hoping she would drop the issue. He didn't want it getting out why he didn't ride anymore.
She really wished she had thought to bring a handkerchief or some– she stopped her train of thought. She was about to say something again. She was nervous. She was going to meet the one and only Sherlock Holmes. She had seen pictures of him and watched him on the telly all the time, but she was actually going to meet him. She had been offered the chance to drive up with Sherlock, but Molly couldn't do that. She probably would have thrown up on his shoes.
He took a deep sigh. "You never wanted to go sailing with me, did you?" John asked as he pulled up to Sherlock's house.
John had got the ultimate revenge though. The guy's girlfriend came over to apologize and stayed for Harry.
John's heart ached for his lover. There was nothing John wanted more than to have Sherlock living with him, but it just wasn't feasible. While John didn't live on the other side of the city, neither was it an easy trip from his flat to the Opera House.
"By not letting me figure things out for myself?" Sherlock leapt off the bed and Mycroft scrambled to follow.
"Good, I make a fantastic stir fry, come over to my place on Friday at eight. I'll make dinner," John insisted.
"Does Mummy know? About what happened between you and Bertie?" Sherlock's voice took on a low growl.
"Oh. Then I'm glad someone did him in proper," John agreed. He looked up at Sherlock and frowned. He was standing closer to the cameraman. Which if Mike was to be believed, the two men
The blond sighed heavy and deep. It was reminiscent of his sigh when he first heard of Sherlock's hospitalization, only more resigned. But he squared his shoulders and lifted his chin.
The pieces of John's broken heart mended at the thought that Sherlock didn't think he was good enough. That John would ever leave the detective. Like John ever could. It showed John that it wasn't that Sherlock didn't feel, but that the feelings were too much. That Sherlock loved him.
John spotted a covered pot on the stove and lifted the lid. "Also, Mrs Hudson has made her homemade chicken and rice soup. Want a bowl before you go to bed?"
John nodded and they made their way to the front door, walking in step with each other. Anderson followed behind, close but not in their way.
"Sadists," Mike muttered, opening the door and strolling out. "Which is to say my parents. But they did put in a tankless water heater, so they weren't complete bastards."
She held it aloft to the cheering attendees, the biggest grin on her face. Greg looked at the book in his hands and the giddy Miss Hooper and knew he had to take a chance. It was time to be brave.
many doors. And trying to figure out which one held a certain annoying publicist without feeling like he was invading the owners' privacy was quite a bit of challenge.
"It's good to be walking again," John admitted. "It appears that I just needed a cause to fight for."
"John," Sherlock repeated, enjoying the way the rugby player's name felt on his tongue. It was warm and made him want to say it over and over again.
The three of them stood in front of the door that led back into the study. John took a deep breath and braced himself for the screaming as Sherlock opened the door.
Sebastian grabbed Jim's shoulder and forced him to sit down. "No contact with Jim, reimbursement for one of the failed shipments, no reimbursement for the lost revenue, and a 10% discount for the next five years."
After a particularly trying day of Mary, (she and James swapped shifts that day because she had a party she was going to that night) James came up to him.
Of course, he wasn't about to light one up here. He was a rebel, not a mass animal killer. One stray spark from his cig and the whole stable could go up in flames. And then he
John opened his mouth to snap back, but furrowed his eyebrows instead when saw that Sherlock was clutching the book to his chest.
Sherlock opened the door and before John could take three steps into the study, he was blasted by screaming.
Sherlock nodded. Langdale was an investigative reporter for one of the best papers in England; if anyone could find out who it was, it would be him. "Mhmm."
Once the game actually started, however, Sherlock found it very hard to watch. Not because it was boring. Oh, no. It was because seeing John in his kit, covered in blood, sweat, and mud made him very aroused.
Sherlock nearly turned red from rage. "What! We are only a few minutes late and you gave our table away?"
Sherlock whirled away from her to pounce on the unsuspecting newcomer, but when his eyes lit on the man, he was blown away. Here was this fit, blond, smiling stranger in a shiny silver suit which really should have looked ridiculous, but really didn't. It took Sherlock's brain a few seconds to catch up.
Without Mycroft noticing, during the first verse, his teammates moved off the pitch to make way for the marching band. As the chorus came in, so did the band and the music over the loudspeakers faded away.
He had it all planned out, he was going to show up first and remain seated throughout the meal and then "forget" his cane and wait for Sherlock to mention it.
"He's resilient, he'll come out of this all the stronger, it just might take some time," Mycroft said.
"This is underwear," Bertie explained, posing with his hands on his hips, head to the side, expression bland. "And this is swimwear." And as far as Sherlock could tell, there was no discernible change between the two.
The next morning, John woke up with an urgent need to relieve himself and no clue of how to accomplish this without waking up Mike or Sherlock. He was thinking about just shimmying to the foot of the bed when Mike woke up and mindlessly made for the one bathroom. John followed close on his heels so that he could at least be second in line for the loo.
Molly ducked her head. "I suppose. I guess with it being Christmas and all, and everyone seems to have paired up but me, I'm feeling a little out of place."
"I think it adds an authentic touch," James said. He turned to look behind him, "So, that's Sherlock?"
"I guess the rich and famous aren't clamoring to be on that blog of yours," Dillon said with a wink.
"I'm not judging," Mr Holmes rushed to assure him. "A couple of the authors I edit for suffer from depression, anxiety, or even worse things like OCD or agoraphobia."
He looked at the detective and scratched the back of his neck. "We should get you into the bedroom. It'll be more comfortable and closer to the bathroom."
With everyone's attention on the other newly enfiancéd couple, John mouthed "Thank you" to Mike, who nodded.
Sherlock's movements became erratic as he began to search in earnest. John just wanted to go up to the detective and put his hands over Sherlock's ears to block out part of the sensory overload that Sherlock must be experiencing. But he couldn't, so he looked on hopelessly.
Mycroft let out a sound that could only be described as a squeal and hugged his mother. "Thank you, Mummy!"
John tried not to wince. A malevolent spirit with a penchant for violence? Sherlock sure knew how to pick his haunted houses. Sheesh.
"Oh, hello," she said, her eyes darting between Sherlock and Anderson. "You must be the nice young men to pick up M– " she stopped and put her hand to her mouth. "Mr Brook," she corrected.
"Age is just a number," Mary huffed, folding her arms in front of her chest and leaning on her back foot.
Also, I CANNOT resist making Mike Stamford the reason John and Sherlock meet, no matter what universe it is.
"I can promise I'll try." He turned to walk away and then turned back. "Thank you for not just killing me or shipping me off somewhere dismal."
"I'm with John on this one, Sherlock," Greg agreed. "You do not control the actions of others. And if you feel that you've done wrong, fix it. But she chose to do what she did. Not you."
"Of course, brother mine," Mycroft agreed too quickly. "And how goes the marketing for Miss Hooper's foray into the magical world of television?"
John opened his mouth to ask more questions, but decided it was better not to. At any case, they had arrived at their stop. Croup got out of the car and held the door open for John. Once he had exited, Croup got back in and the car drove off, leaving John in a dark, abandoned warehouse.
"As in, am I or someone I know insane?" John snapped. "No, but I am far more qualified to speak on the subject than anyone else here."
Sherlock glowered, but Victor ignored it. "I was hoping to catch you here," he said with a wink. "A little bird told me."
But none of that showed on Greg's face as he spoke, "Well, prom is more expensive than the movies, there's the tux, flowers, a limo–"
"Not at all, I was merely noting that it was timing," he looked sidelong at John, "and perhaps your choice in partner, that caused Emilia Ricoletti to have the breakdown which resulted in her assault of your home, the attempted murder of yourself and John, and her eventual suicide."
The band stopped as if on cue and quietly marched off the field as if that was as far into the song they had intended to play.
Greg looked up just as a black sedan pulled to the curb. Greg chuckled. "You are a sneaky bastard, aren't you?"
"You came out of your relationship with Richard just fine," Victor said. "You just put on the best show of your career and he's teaching teenagers in Nowheresville, America."
"That is not the point, however; the point is that this young man was close to my brother and left. He had bought this lovely plantation in India, and Sherlock thought that they were going to go together."
He got off their suspect and let Greg handcuff him. "By breaking his nose from the look of it," Greg said, his chin tilted up to get a better look at the guy's face.
Hello, lovelies! I'm back with a shiny new chapter and you'll notice the chapter numbers have been updated. Yes, come hell or high water there will be only 2 more chapters, regardless of length. Mainly because I've stopped caring about the chapters being a certain number to hit. But also because this little story has been going on for almost a year and a half and it's time to move on. BUT! It will be finished and you can thank Old Ping Hai, my tireless beta of many years, for that. She's awesome.
After a couple of moments of silence, Mycroft cursed, "You went with 'not messing up your hair' as a reason not to have us ride your motorcycle, really?"
Mycroft pressed his lips together and sighed, "Of course I care. I am just a firm believer in doing something because you want to and not because everyone is doing it."
"And we're assuming he has people on the inside to do his dirty work," Sherlock said, tucking the two envelopes into the inside breast pocket of his coat.
"Well, if I have any say in the matter you won't have to worry about it ever again," John said fiercely.
Sherlock sighed. "It's not a slight against you as a person, but as a writer. Don't be afraid to give him flaws. Like drinking, or bad at cards, or even a temper."
They were given a choice of colors; Greg picked silver and Mycroft chose black. They were then given white coveralls and thick safety goggles and led to the arena.
He looked back up at the front of the classroom where Mr Lyons was tapping his foot impatiently. It was clear from the look on his face that he had been calling Greg for some time.
John laughed again. "Fair enough. And for the record, I'd cut rugby if I had to. I need to pass this class."
Sherlock: You'll have to figure it out on your own when "The Summer of the Thunderbird" comes out next year.
John laughed again. "Apparently it was too tame for her. She got bored. She missed the thrum and noise of London."
The best part about the whole thing is that Sarah was just arrogant enough to not believe that anyone outside her circle would know about her party, much less crash it. Or failing that, think it was a different Sarah's party.
He rang up the client and hit total. The machine sprang to life and the customer paid John the amount owed.
John laughed. Sherlock looked up at John and smiled. Greg's eyes went wide. He'd never seen Sherlock smile like that at anyone. It was almost adoring.
"Thanks," John said to Molly, Mike, and Mycroft. He got his stuff and got in the back seat. Sherlock, Greg, and Mycroft slid into their seats and they all waved goodbye.
The PA sighed. "Oh, I'm going to hell anyway." He handed over the file. "This one is a little unusual for us. He's a former captain of Her Majesty's army, surgeon, and combat medic."
Sherlock blushed and Mary scowled. John gave her a wink, sat down next to Sherlock and immediately started asking questions about his cases, and Sherlock regaled them with tales that seemed straight out of fiction.
As they walked around town a bit to let their stomachs settle, Sherlock murmured, "You must think me strange, not realizing you were asking me out on Valentine's Day."
"I didn't want to do this, but with your clear lack of respect for the rules, I'm going to have to fire you. Grab your things and go. You can pick up your last check on Friday," Barbara said, with a sigh.
"Why not? It's what we do," Sherlock said. "The first three you should already know if you were listening to the current drama with David the Idiot, as Gavin aptly named him."
Sherlock shrugged. "Something about childhood trauma making me ripe for a life of crime and that it was only a matter of time before I snapped."
"Fuck," John bit out, "you are far too talented with that thing, you keep that up and this will be over very fast."
John got out of his car and grabbed the bag of goodies he always kept under his seat for when he didn't have time to eat before school or work. He tried so hard not to shake as he walked up to his dad, who was steadfastly ignoring Mrs Stamford's attempts to make small talk.
Sherlock sighed. There was nothing for it; if Greg of all people could see it then there was no point hiding it. “He’s a rugby player, the star of the London team, apparently.”
"Oh, dear! I hope you haven't changed your mind, I've already sent them the check for the first semester."
Hello, darlings! Welcome to the next chapter in record time! I told you that it would be out super fast. And now it is here for your enjoyment. Now, ten won't be out as fast, but now that I have set days off I'll have more time to write consistently. And I hope this will translate to more chapters faster. Plus I've dragged on this poor story so long and I'm only half way through.
"I did it on a lark," Sherlock said with a shrug. "My fencing teacher said I was too lazy to do anything with the sport, so I went out of my way to prove him wrong." He grimaced. There was a reason his fencing teacher thought that, but it wasn't anything
"He was rich, handsome, polished in ways I'm not," John muttered into Sherlock's chest. "I couldn't help but compare myself to him and I came up short."
John nodded. "They aren't sure what's wrong. She complains that there is a pain in her back, but doctors have done all sorts of tests on her back, and they can't find anything. So we came back to England in hopes that they can find what is making her so sick."
Mycroft's usually silver tongue decided that the best time to abandon him was when he needed it most. So he made shit up.
"They really did a number on ya," the voice continued. "Let's see if I can keep you around until live help gets here."
John flinched from the pain. "It hurts like hell, and the ghosts can sometimes break the skin with their intent, but they can't do anything that would cause permanent harm."
"How's the toes?" the doctor asked as he brushed his hand across this boyfriend's shoulders on his way to the fridge.
Sherlock cleared his throat. He held out his hand and John took it, coming to stand next to the publicist.
John shook his head, "Nope, maybe against 'Mycroft recommendation', but no. They know by now that I am more than capable of taking care of you."
"Oh, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson said fluttering her hands. But as she did so, it knocked Sherlock's coffee out of his hand and onto the floor where the hot liquid splashed on his legs.
Now, in spite of the fact that Shakespeare is a dead, white dude, he knows his shit, so we are going to ignore that bit. But what I want you lot to do is to write your own version of this sonnet."
"Hello, Professor," Mycroft greeted in return. As he passed Greg's desk he knocked into Greg's backpack, sending it sprawling to the floor. Mycroft apologized and picked it up. As Greg took the backpack from him, Mycroft slipped something into the front pocket.
Part four is live, everyone! And the part everyone one has been waiting for. Also what I've been calling part 1 of the twist. ;)
Greg huffed out a laugh. "No, of course not. What would you do with that many guitars? No, I'll buy you a drum kit, a keyboard, a bass, and if you're really, really lucky, maybe someday a tambourine."
Sherlock nodded. "In addition to his proclivities toward public sex, the slimy little weasel was caught trying to break into the men's dressing rooms."
Greg turned Stella toward Molly and gently pushed her in her direction. "I'd hate to be a bother, but she is really,
The next time the door opened, it revealed his brother. Gone was the worry and stress that had been plaguing Sherlock since the detective business had hit a slow patch. Before him was the East Wind, the man who would move heaven and hell to get what he wanted.
I already have the next story written, it just needs to be typed up. I don't know how long it is, so it might be in chapters, it might not. I like to write at work but due to some absolutely silly rules, I can't have paper at my desk. Which means that stories that require a shit ton of notes (fusions like this story in particular) can't be worked at anywhere but home. Which has its own distractions, like the sweetest little boy who just turned 6. So I write up headcannons for other shows like "Lucifer" and "Good Omens". Or story ideas that I would love to write. Or in this case a whole story which got completely out of hand and I finished it.
Sherlock gathered him up in his arms and held him tight as John's shuddering breath became something more akin to a sob. John's shoulders shook as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist, holding on for dear life.
The ring was currently in Mike's possession. He didn't want Mary to accidentally stumble on it. And since the cabin belonged to Mike's parents, it was perfect. Mike would bring the ring with him and then slip it to John when the time was right. Of course, having the ring out of sight did nothing for his nerves. The last few hours before they had to leave for the cabin, John texted Mike incessantly.
"Because if we do it for one person then other people will start demanding that we do it for them, too. We take Mark Strong's table and give it to Becks, and he tells people that he can get any seat in our restaurant he wants, then other people come in thinking they are more famous than he is and demand that they be given a table, too. And that simply cannot happen!"
"Not this again, Mary," John moaned. "There is no one in all of London who I would want to bring to the after party. Now leave it alone."
Sherlock looked at him a moment and then pulled it out. He unlocked the screen and handed it to John.
"There isn't anyone available, Sherlock," Mycroft growled. "There is a reason I'm the one doing it today."
"His name is Sherlock Holmes, he's completely mad, absolutely public school, and posh as hell. But he's also the kindest, most generous man I've ever met and of course it doesn't hurt that he is drop-dead gorgeous."
Sherlock sighed. "I would only eat or sleep when you were home, and if I happened to fall asleep before you came home no matter how hard I tried to stay awake and you were gone before I awoke, I wouldn't eat at all. There were times that Mrs Hudson would force biscuits on me, but other than that..."
"I can get out more bacon if you want some," John said, sitting down at the table with his own plate.
John shook his head. This school was going to be interesting, to say the least. And if he swung this right, he'd even get a boyfriend out of the deal.
Sherlock just shrugged. "I grew up on dishes like this and I had the choice of learning to make it myself or hire a chef to get it wrong. I learned instead."
John frowned and looked down at the response in the book, but it didn't match with what Sherlock had just said. But he plowed on, "
"It was fun. My sister-in-law is American and her father firmly believed in honoring different cultures. Mexican food on Cinco de Mayo, a full-on Jewish seder, and Chinese-American food on the Chinese New Year. And this is what he would make. Though sometimes the main dish would vary depending if it was the year of the chicken, or the boar, or the cow."
The sentence was too bizarre for John not to open his eyes and stare at Sherlock with what he hoped conveyed his confusion.
When they exited the car, Sherlock put his arm on John’s lower back, and John tried to use as much of Sherlock’s body as he could to shield himself from the stares. Thankfully, the club had dark reddish lights, making him less recognizable. Not that he knew any rich people who frequented such clubs, but you never know.
No more than two days after he returned he gave John his punishment, in possibly the worst place he could have chosen. Of course, the purpose was to make John uncomfortable with the space.
Sherlock’s lips were sweet and bitter at the same time. They tasted of tea and honey. John used his tongue to try to get more of this sweetness and Sherlock opened his lips wider for him, smiling against John.
John had many occasions to see Sherlock’s chest before, but it always amazed him how much thinner Sherlock seemed in his dress shirts. He was, of course, quite thin, but his chest was sculpted, his wiry muscles strengthened by whatever strange martial arts he trained.
Sherlock left the bathroom then, supposedly to give John some privacy. He returned with two wine glasses, when John was already in the bathtub, safely covered with bubbles. Still, he felt weird, being completely naked so close to Sherlock.
He took the gun with him to the bedroom. Sherlock could easily force the locks open, he might even have the keys from Mrs Hudson. If he tried anything, John had to be prepared.
When John woke to the sound of Sherlock snoring quietly he thought they were home. It was still the hotel, but the place seemed less important than the company and he moved closer, resting on Sherlock’s peacefully rising chest. Moments like these were the only ones he felt truly calm and he wanted to cherish them. He wasn’t sure how many mornings resembling this one he had left so he had to fully use all of them to imprint Sherlock’s heat onto his body.
If even death couldn’t stop Sherlock from playing games with him than John had to keep on playing. He had nothing else to do.
The blessing of a complicated murder case helped distract Sherlock from what John was doing. Of course, John could have bought everything he asked of Sherlock by himself, but it was more fun to make Sherlock do it, unaware of its destiny. He made Sherlock buy him things over time, in a manner that was unconnected, often really just taken in by an impulse. The chair surprised Sherlock, though there wasn’t really anything that suspicious about getting a big, comfortable chair, and he made no comment about it, willing to get everything John wanted. The suit and jewelry weren’t really John’s usual style, but Sherlock was eager to comply when John asked for it. He didn’t even blink when John demanded him to procure the Penguin three-piece light grey suit, that John doesn’t plan to wear except for one occasion. John didn’t even really like jewelry but the simple-looking white gold diamond tennis bracelet from Brilliant Earth caught his eye, even though it was madness to spend this much money on a bauble. Everything, from the Gucci belt to perfume, Sherlock got it all. John even made him buy the wine, in an offhand way. In the end, John bought only one thing in secret.
What he saw confused him. There was a bathtub, filled with water and way too much foam. There were actual candles around it, providing the only light, making the bathroom warm and distorted. John also noticed a bottle of wine on a shelf.
loved jumped off a building two years ago and made me watch it. He’s dead to me,” John gripped the gun tighter to control his trembling hand, “You are a stranger. Get out of my house.”
“I do not! Don’t twist this so that I fit your perversions. I bet you wish I would just come and say ‘thank you so much, Daddy, you are so good to me’!”
“It’s because of last night that I’m telling you to keep your hands to yourself. I don’t want to look tired at my own wedding!”
He managed to mollify his own anger, somewhat, though not completely. Surely, if he pretended nothing was wrong Sherlock would notice, so instead he acted spoiled and didn’t let Sherlock touch him too much. Normally, Sherlock would push harder, but he must have been feeling apologetic, so he did what John wanted without question and stopped his affections whenever John told him to.
“Don’t come until you tried my gift, John,” his voice is commanding, and at least that John can comply with.
He swam for an hour, and it calmed him. Sherlock appeared in the meantime, but he just sat down at the bar, making no indication for John to leave the pool.
Sherlock smirked before turning them around and throwing John down on the bed. His lips went down from John’s on a trail from his neck, through his chest and stomach, up his cock to kiss its head, and down to thrust his tongue into John. His back jumped off the bed and he had to grab the bedclothes for some kind of stability. He was used to many things, but Sherlock never failed to draw pleasure from him with his every touch, and the expert way he used his tongue, the firmness with which he held John’s thighs from closing too much around his head, it disarmed John completely. He didn’t even stop his noises, hoping Mrs Hudson was already out of the guest bedroom.
“No,” he made his way back in the direction of the car. “You are crazy and I am tired of your games. We’re going home.”
The thing was, he knew he could resign. Just not go. He was pretty sure Sherlock would find some other way to catch this guy. Sure, maybe some innocent people would die, but why was that John’s problem? Anyway, he believed in Sherlock’s abilities.
When he was done, his heart was beating furiously. Sherlock’s gaze, his trapped body excited him and he had to calm himself. Standing up from his lap he went to take away the tray and to the kitchen, breathing deeply away from the other.
“Well, I’d like to and I can’t imagine a better partner,” Sherlock answered with a smile and extended his hand.
“A bit from work, yeah. I must admit, I was really determined to steal a date from him. But your friend didn’t budge. And now I will no longer have a chance.”
This was already a lot of stimulation. Sherlock was slow, but he wasn’t quite delicate. His fingers were moving in and out in a manner that was torturous, the tempo of it would never be enough to make John orgasm, but it was just enough to make him frenzied. He could no longer play with his chest, the hand assisting in keeping him from falling forward into the mirror, his legs barely able to stand.
Sherlock was in the middle of sucking the skin around his nipple when the abrupt ring tone made both of them jump. It was Sherlock’s phone, and with one look John could tell Sherlock was going to ignore it, so he picked it up himself, and kept Sherlock away when he tried to go back to his earlier activity.
John followed instructions not sure how he felt about leaving their spot on the couch. Sherlock’s hand made him look up.
It’s hard to take his hand off this place, but this is not the most important part of his body today. He can see Sherlock’s eyes widening when he sees John pour lube on his fingers.
He doesn’t get to the tenth setting. By the eight he can’t even move it in and out anymore, just pushes it in deep with one hand, the other going to his leaking cock. The harsh vibrations against his prostate are too extreme, it takes barely a few tugs on his cock to come with a noise that is dangerously close to a whine. For a moment, there are stars before his eyes and the only thing that keeps him aware is the over-stimulation from the toy. He grabs for the remote blindly and turns off the vibrations.
It seemed like a good idea at the time. If there were any unpredictable side-effects John would notice them immediately. At first, he sat in a chair next to the bed, but it quickly became uncomfortable. He hesitated only a moment before joining Sherlock under the covers. It wasn’t that much of a big deal, he tried to rationalize. Sherlock’s bed was big, there was a lot of space separating their bodies, and the other was sleeping soundly. Moreover, they shared beds before in inns and guest rooms.
He liked when Sherlock showed his dominating side, but he also liked that Sherlock couldn’t quite be consistent in it. No matter how much he wanted to punish John, he couldn’t keep the façade when he turned his head to kiss John with so much feeling. The fingers deep inside John were moving unhurriedly, making him gasp right into Sherlock’s mouth. Craning his neck in that way was uncomfortable so John had to turn it to the front again and face himself in the mirror.
Sherlock: I’d rather not involve you in foreign politics my brother is so fond of. And I see you found a way to occupy your time while I’m gone. Did you enjoy your massage? SH
He read some articles online on the performing couple. Apparently, they were married now, but they used to be rivals. They even argued once so explosively that they were banned from a national competition. It was unclear to him how exactly these people came to be married, but apparently there was no better duet in this century.
When they finished dancing he still had the melody and the movement in his body, it didn’t want to leave. He felt too full of satisfaction and as if he would never be able to get enough of Sherlock at once. He felt like he was overflowing.
The conditions he set were a bit of a problem, especially now, when John desired him more than he ever did. He cursed himself for using that damned vibrator, from discovering a pleasure he could only imagine before. Now Sherlock was back, and John couldn’t even use it.
John laughed, leaning down to bop the pup’s nose, “you see, Gladstone? I can never win with that guy. Will you be on my side?”
“About that, you still didn’t tell me exactly what I’m supposed to do.” John answered while trying to reach for the glass without falling off Sherlock’s lap. Both of Sherlock’s hands around his waist supported him.
On the first day of his two-week break from work Sherlock woke him up at six in the morning. John was in the process of considering killing him with a pillow, but then Sherlock confused him by saying John had to dress up quickly if he didn’t want to miss their flight.
“Me, petulant? I was going along with your stupid scheme and that’s what you think? That I was doing it to get on your nerves? You didn’t seem to be avoiding things that would affect me on that couch.”
“John,” Sherlock repeats in a low tone and John thinks he will never comply, but it’s followed by an unwilling: “Please.”
John didn’t quite get how it was a punishment, but he was sure Sherlock was going to torture him in some way. In fact, he was close to begging for him to start. He met Sherlock’s eyes in the mirror and gave him a slight nod. Sherlock smirked and kissed his cheek with approval.
Normally, John would probably somehow let it go. But that day he had to cover for two other doctors, he was exhausted and hungry to the point of being in tears.
“Is he? You know, John, these days everything seems so suspicious. Everyone values their pride so much. Historically, wasn’t it normal to woo someone by lavishing them with gifts?”
Their arguments were rarely about one specific thing. On a superficial level, yes, they were quarreling about something that happened, but before that point, the tension and aggression were accumulating in John for weeks. John tended to ignore the small annoying things unless they surprised him and he mostly just threw biting comments in Sherlock’s direction. But the added tension of the feeling that he was losing to Sherlock, of being an almost-but-not-quite lover, of the imbalance in their rapport, of Sherlock’s weird approach to relationships, created a conflict within him, a desperation he wasn’t able to completely control. So when something big happened it made him react with an intensity that seemed to surprise even Sherlock.
There was something very intimate in the way Sherlock’s hand felt on the small of his back and the other holding John’s in his. He had never danced with a man before like this, but the experience of being held in Sherlock’s arms shouldn’t be new. This felt different and it made John nervous when they just stood like that for a moment, Sherlock’s piercing eyes not leaving his.
He approached John slowly, touched his arm without hesitation. He raised it a bit, starting to wash it with the sponge. John wasn’t sure how to react, so he did nothing.
Looking back at it, these were not good reasons to act the way he did that night. He blames Irene, even though it was not her idea. She put these stupid things into his head.
Sherlock started breathing, freeing his muscles from rigidly holding his body in one place. He posed his hands above John’s hips and moved him slightly back from his cock.
John moved the hand again, down to his covered nipple, making Sherlock’s thumb move over it. “Here,” he continued onto the other nipple “and here.”
John shouldn’t be surprised to see people fucking in this kind of place. It was the way they were doing it that made him uneasy.
Currently, for instance, he was seated across from Sherlock in, what John assumed was a very expensive restaurant with a French name he could not pronounce. And he believed that nothing could surprise him more than the debit card he found in the new card holder on his bedside table two days ago. The card was on his name, but the leather holder had Sherlock’s initials. A clear enough message. John was afraid to even touch it.
“You want to gag me? Gag me with these.” He took three of Sherlock’s fingers into his mouth and sucked. He imitated the movement on his member and by Sherlock’s sounds, he was doing a pretty good job.
For example, he initially planned to let that incident with ‘Daddy’ remain forgotten. He really did.
Even when he found a small box on his bed and opened it to find a freaking Rolex inside, he somehow let it slide. He went up to Sherlock to make sure the other knew it was not John’s birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s day, or anything that could warrant such generosity. Sherlock seemed unaffected and told John it was ‘just a little gift’ and resumed his work, shushing the other’s protest.
When Sherlock stood up and turned, his face and ears were red and John got momentarily worried for him, but then remembered how angry he was. Sherlock crossed his threshold obediently, without a word. He closed the door behind the dogs and stood right before John, who was wearing a soft pajama set. Even standing in the open door for a moment felt chilly, and John was tempted to touch and check how cold Sherlock’s hand was, or if he was running a fever. But Sherlock’s gaze was clear, he didn’t look sick. He stood unmoving, looking down at John with his impossible eyes as if he was cataloging the changes in his face.
Sherlock leaned down to his lips slowly, giving his upper lip a gentle nibble. John kissed back with open eyes, not trusting the devotion with which Sherlock treated him, even though it made him tremble inside. He went as far as putting his arms around Sherlock’s neck before the other drew slightly back.
He drives a third finger inside and it is on the border of being too painful. It definitely feels too full, but a cock would have been more, so he slowly resumes his movements. There is a lot of movement and he’s the one controlling the speed, so he doesn’t really hurt himself. It eases and John feels mad with how strangely good it feels, how different. Why the hell had he never tried this before? This feels literally amazing, he is harder than stimulating his cock has ever gotten him and the bereft feeling he has from not touching his penis just makes it
He meant to say something in return, but Sherlock turned his attention back to watching a girl in a bunny costume getting naughty with one in a wolf costume.
He didn’t really expect to be overly interested in the music, more on the aesthetic of being in this place. He didn’t dislike violin music, he even liked hearing Sherlock play when he wasn’t murdering the strings, but he was never one of the people who listened to it in their free time.
Tom possessed a sort of dry humor and John found his intelligent sarcasm attractive. Making him let down his guard was a slow and interesting process, but ultimately very satisfying. This was not the sort of guy that was easy to pick up, John could have chosen a much easier pray. The problem is that he didn’t want to.
“I told you, no masturbation without my permission,” Sherlock has a serious face on and it makes John that much more willing to do it.
As soon as Sherlock ordered their drinks, John felt his hand encircle his waist. He didn’t react at first but Sherlock was dragging him closer.
“John,” Sherlock’s forehead was against his, his eyes closed, “I can hear you thinking. What are you afraid of? I would not do anything that you don’t want. But I know you want this. I can see it in every part of your body, hear it in your pulse. Don’t overanalyze this. Don’t deprive yourself of the things I can give.”
John took a white macaron into his mouth and did a mental double take. He did not imagine it would be that good. It looked hard from the outside, but the vanilla inside was chewy. He looked up and saw Sherlock self-satisfied smirk which meant Sherlock could easily see the pleasure John was experiencing.
“What? I can go out with other people, but I can’t masturbate? What kind of a fucked up system is that?”
Not that Sherlock was holding himself back. John had a whole new set of clothes for the week they were supposed to be here. It was really unnecessary, as he had enough clothes from Italy to last him a much longer period. When he informed Sherlock of that, the other just replied he wanted to see John in these clothes, so John automatically lost his argument and just allowed him to do whatever he wanted. Sherlock had good taste, and he usually kept it to John’s liking as well, so the clothes weren’t really an issue. John didn’t even recognize half the brands, but he could guess by the quality of the fabric of his white or dark shorts, his thin colorful shirts and tasteful boxers they were upscale. Besides that, he also had a number of summer accessories like Saint Laurent sunglasses and hats, Armani colognes, even things like a Sony camera and Balenciaga backpack, that were sure to be over-priced. He supposed he looked quite nice in them, judging by Sherlock’s approving gazes.
Sherlock tried to lift up but when John started moving his hips, he laid down again, too overcome with the stimulation. John smirked down at him, trembling and helpless underneath him. Sherlock was indeed very aroused, it only took a bit of John undulating atop him to make John witness his orgasm for the first time, Sherlock’s mouth opening wide with soundless grunts, his brows furrowing as if he was surprised by the sensation. John watched it all with cruel fascination.
His worries accompanied him until he fell asleep. When he woke up he forgot where he was, but a pair of startling blue eyes reminded him.
He will not be the first one to give in. He might lose to Sherlock in many things but this one he can win.
Sherlock licked along the underside of his cock but the contact disappeared right away and Sherlock stood up, towering over John with an expression that made him shudder with anticipation. Sherlock backed him up again, taking off John’s jacket, and John could feel the chill of the mirror behind him. Sherlock held his chin, lifted it up to kiss John in a deceptively sensuous manner. John knew by the way he was being held, by the rigidness of Sherlock’s posture, this was not one of those nice and gentle times.
John was mortified, but that is what you get when you find an incredibly observant friend who also completely lacks tact.
Three hours passed and there was still no break-in. His dogs had quieted down some time ago. John knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep and the temptation to check if Sherlock was still there grew every minute. Finally, he gave in, like he always did. Clearly, those two years have taught him nothing.
But he kept his mouth open, his legs too. He weaved his hand into Sherlock’s soft hair, the other holding him close around his shoulder.
Disappeared into the bathroom for an hour. Told me to wait on his bed, which doesn’t inspire great confidence
He liked acting petulant but it was not a particularly good idea for dealing with Sherlock. The detective took the phone away from him and informed Adler that ‘they were busy’ before hanging up.
Sherlock looked at him and slowly moved forward making John stumble back. As John predicted, he was terrible at this and it was getting on his nerves. He looked down at his useless feet, as much to predict what move Sherlock would make next as to not look in his eyes.
He puts the vibrator in a bit and it’s too much. Without preparation, John could have hurt himself. He thought about it, but his desire for pain is satisfied with just this and he does not like to see himself bleed. There are many ways to experience pain and this one would not have been satisfying, he can feel it now, with how full and intense this already feels.
“Because I want to know,” Sherlock’s hands made their way to John’s sides, skimming over them lightly, “your body,” he kissed the skin under John’s neck, “your history,” he bit on John’s lobe, and John’s hips jumped up, “and your mind.”
He pushed Sherlock’s face harshly away and left him on the floor of the living room without another word.
He decided to add some noise and life to his backyard by building a hen house and buying chicks. Animals were as good company as any, his dogs proving that point by not letting him throw them off his bed. To liven up the space around the house he also busied himself with planting apple and cherry trees.
Sherlock didn’t allow him even this moment of weakness. John gasped when his head was dragged back by his hair, his throat exposed and his eyes opening.
John was afraid that the only way to get out of this unscathed was to distance himself, but treating Sherlock with indifference seemed impossible. John couldn’t once again live with the horrible loneliness he experienced after leaving the army. He already needed Sherlock too much, was too dependent on him, and the thought of Sherlock throwing him away was the worst scenario he could imagine. It scared him how weak he became, and it scared him Sherlock would despise him for it.
John didn’t know much about technique, but he could guess those two were masters of it. They took the audience on a journey through many different emotions, feelings that had no name and no words could describe them as accurately as the sounds.
When they returned it was already late, so John thought whatever Sherlock planned, he might leave it for tomorrow. Sherlock, however, steered John into the detective’s bedroom, setting his nerves on edge, only to promptly disappear into his bathroom, leaving John to sit uncertainly on his bed. He didn’t return for half an hour.
“And what makes you think that I would want to be with you after we slept together? Are you that sure of yourself, you arrogant git? To use your body as leverage against me, that’s just below anything.”
John smirked and started taking off his suit jacket. It was getting hot in here, but he wasn’t going to get immediately naked.
John opted to cooperate, not that he had any choice. Sherlock never stopped his ridiculous investigations in the middle.
The bed dipped under Sherlock and there were lips on John’s neck. John moved forward, but Sherlock just followed, catching him around the waist.
John couldn’t talk. His throat wasn’t able to produce sounds. Sherlock seemed to figure it out, and he moved back, extending his hand for John to take.
“Was it” Sherlock’s mouth travelled to John’s neck, and John realized there was no escape from him, “a relaxing shower?”
“Sherlock, god,” he drives his fingers deeper, scratches against his prostate making his hips jump up, “this feels so good. This feels so –“ he’s head hits the wall when he picks up the rhythm, “- full. How could you not have done this to me?”
John finds it on the small remote and god, that is something. It’s so strange to feel it heat up inside him, but he is definitely not complaining.
“You are right about one thing, John; Sherlock does want to control you. He is the type to dominate others.”
He realized he did something wrong only when the younglings, Greg and most of all, Sherlock stared at him. It probably wasn’t even the words themselves, it was his voice. He didn’t plan to sound so suggestive.
It in no way justified the words that left John’s mouth, when he caught Sherlock’s wrist to stop him, without even a hint of hesitation.
Sherlock doesn’t show his surprise when John calls him, even though John is wearing his bathrobe and nothing else. He can guess right away what the purpose of this call is.
So when Sherlock tapped lightly on his door and John let him in, he decided to blurt this out before he changed his mind.
He knows he will most likely regret this little revenge later on, but for now, he doesn’t care. He’s making Sherlock furious and that is worth anything.
It was all fake. Sherlock never once kissed him, be it on the neck or lips, when it wasn’t connected to this case. It made John wonder how much of the rest was just the addition to this case. The bath? The vacation? Maybe all of this? Maybe Sherlock just got swept along in his acting?
Sherlock let his wrists go to lay his hand on John’s face and lean down to look inquisitively in his eyes. John ignored his worried expression and started taking off his pants. Sherlock allowed it and John didn’t touch him anywhere untoward as he promised. He left Sherlock his boxers to take off himself and started backing up in the direction of the bath.
“You always react so oddly when I say that. I can’t guess if you like it or hate it.” John explained. He meant to tease Sherlock with the question, but now he was honestly curious about that.
“This is the land I received from my aunt Augusta in her will,” Sherlock explained, starting to walk towards the outskirts of the land next to a forest.
John started massaging the foot through the sock and Sherlock exhaled loudly. There were a lot of nerves there, and John planned to use that knowledge.
The thing about vacation is, when you return from it, you realize that you were living in an unrealistic bubble and now reality is going to crush you. And John tried to ignore reality, but the moment he stepped back into their flat, he knew he was screwed.
Sherlock rarely left the site of the crime before looking at the victim, but suddenly he told John to ‘wait a moment’ and disappeared. When he returned twenty minutes later John was surprised by suddenly having his head covered by a black beanie. He didn’t see it very well, as Sherlock put it on him quickly, but he could say it was black, and quite simple, except for a bit of fur underneath that felt really nice and warm on his ears.
“Don’t sound so generous. You started it, now finish it. And I’m not going to ride you, my thighs are already sore, so you better get to work.”
He didn’t expect Sherlock to take off the silicone structure and he didn’t expect to come while it was still not completely off him, but it made him shout. It was the most painful orgasm of his life.
He had to give another command to make Sherlock follow him into the bedroom. Sherlock gave little curious glances to his surroundings, but his attention stayed mostly on John.
He didn’t even realize he closed them, crushing his own hands around the base of the toy just to feel it more. It shields what he’s doing there from view a little. When he opens his eyes and sees Sherlock’s hungry, impatient gaze, he smirks.
John had the time of his life being unhurriedly and thoroughly worshipped in the bath. He was going to let Sherlock adore him, he would take everything from him, everything that Sherlock was willing to give before he got bored of John. Before he realized John was never that special.
Anyway, this chapter was short, but the next one will be longer, and it should arrive soon, as I'm finishing up the last two chapters.
“Do you remember when you gave me a bath in Italy? I had imagined you joining me at that time. Telling me to wash you.”
“You could have, but you didn’t. I know you haven’t touched it. There’s nothing to be afraid of, you know. It’s just some extra money.”
He barely slept, thoughts of the next day keeping him up. For how embarrassing it was, it was one thing to get excited by Sherlock in the privacy of the bathroom, but what if it happened in front of all the people outside? John suspected that was the point, but he was definitely not willing to allow it.
Sherlock was texting all the time in the taxi and completely ignoring all of John’s questions, so John found out at the airport they were apparently going to Italy.
“Show me where you would like me to touch you,” Sherlock’s eyes told John he was similarly running out of patience.
Fine, this wasn’t exactly true. He knew more or less how he got here and he cursed Sherlock for running after the BDSM killer without back-up. He just about managed to reach them and when he saw Sherlock laying on the ground he didn’t hesitate to shoot the man next to him in the leg. He barely restrained himself from shooting him in the head.
John is already turned on, in a hazy sensual way one gets when they drink too much and end up waking up with a complete stranger on the next day. Sherlock should be glad that the only thing John plans to cheat on him with is this toy.
Sherlock looked at him, not in his - ‘you are an idiot unable to ever understand me’ way, but in his - ‘you are my favourite person in the universe’ way.
