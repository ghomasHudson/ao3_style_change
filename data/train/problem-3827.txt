“Gonna beg you,” Dean says, like a threat, getting on his knees in the dirt. “Beg you to take me back.”
“The hell are you making all this racket for, so early in the goddamn morning?” Rufus asks, only half dressed and walking down the drive.
Cas is talking him through it—“That’s good. That’s so good, Dean. You’re beautiful. You’re gorgeous.”
Dean finishes cooking his bacon and eggs and goes to take the spot next to Cas. Cas adjusts his posture as he sits so that their thighs touch. Dean glances at him. He’s close, beautiful. He looks almost human in Dean’s t-shirt and sweats.
Dean nods, pretending this is news he’s processing, tapping against the wheel with his fingers. It’s the answer he expected, but Sam could have put more emotion behind it.
There’s a wave of pain and Dean’s consciousness is brought back to the Empty. He can feel it, crawling up his back, into his lungs. He can’t get enough air. He can’t feel his feet at all.
Cas is quiet. Damn if his eyes weren’t blue as the sky they didn’t have in Boston. Boston must be missing Cas something fierce.
“My momma. Used to pop bottles out back with me and Charlie, and Sam, too, a few times. Those was rifles, though. Could actually hit things with ‘em.”
Dean sniffs against the burning in his eyes. He lies down fully clothed on the bed in room three, and thinks about his own safety, in this house full of women. Sister Jo kept an extensive blacklist of anyone who’d ever hit or threatened one of them, and she had a memory that’d put the smartest minds in the world to shame. Every night, she stood in that parlor and watched every man who stepped through the door. Most every night, there’d be some new cowpoke who they’d never seen before, who Dean would show up to this room and to this bed, not knowing if things were going to end in a fistfight, or worse.
“Said you broke little Jo’s heart. Charlie did come by, but all she asked was that I send someone to let her know as soon as you showed up. Sam was here a few days ago—“
“And how exactly do you know your father hasn’t contacted the authorities already?” Balthazar checks.
Cas takes him by the head and kisses him. Dean, on his hands and knees, keeps crawling forward until Cas falls back, then keeps kissing him, kisses him into the rug, kisses him silly. Cas pushes Dean’s face away and whispers, “I know I promised not to talk—“
He knew which boundaries were safe to cross for the sake of teasing and which would result in a fight if tested. He rolled his eyes often, and half of Dean’s jokes he simply ignored. While Dean could’ve done without the less-than stellar reactions, overall, he was enjoying this more relaxed Cas, who didn’t worry so much about every little thing he said. Cas was still a worrier, of course, but there was a new confidence in him, too.
“My son is the new God.” Cas says it matter-of-factly, but his eyes are examining Dean, as if his mind is on something completely different.
“Not so far. It’s hard, and cold, and dirty. The food’s bad; there are no facilities. The other cowboys don’t seem to like me very much.”
“I—I don’t reckon I can tell you that, Cas,” says Dean honestly. “But it’s good enough for me. More’n good enough.”
An easy question, despite the circumstances. “He’s great. Amazing, actually. Works at a practice downtown. He’s got this wonderful wife, and they’re expecting a baby.”
Cas reaches up to fondle his legs through the fabric of his pants, and Dean fondles Cas’s lips in return, until they part and Cas is sucking his fingers, eyes closed, groping up Dean’s thighs with both hands.
“A-huh. What, you mean all of that stuff on the rug last night was just your average night?” Dean asks.
He lets them hurt him, alone, in the dark of his room. He dwells on memories, lets himself think thoughts that he’s banished countless times; he revels in them. He thinks about Cas.
coupled with the slightly threatening look in Dean’s eyes to even look at Lorna’s expression. He doesn’t understand what’s going on and isn’t sure he wants to. It was the last thing he’d expected to happen. It feels exciting. It feels good.
Now that would be an exercise in futility, wouldn’t it? No. Much as I’d like to, it’s impossible to kill anything within this place. I’m only here to give you a little… orientation. Welcome, Dean, to the Empty.
There’s a moment while Cas digests this, then Dean is rewarded with his gravely voice saying seriously through the phone, “Send me a picture of your erect cock, Dean.”
Dean whistles. “Like getting a cat to lick you after you just bathed in dog soup. Impossible. Best thing ever happened to me. What?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean stares at Cas for a second. He’s leaning on one elbow on the bed, face not far from Dean’s. He hasn’t made a move to get up or get dressed. Maybe he was still willing to stay, then, despite the obviousness of Dean’s feelings. Dean turns out the light and goes ahead and lies down next to Cas. He’s lied to them both enough for today. If Cas was okay with it, so was he. He backs up to Cas again, and Cas puts up with him graciously, wrapping an arm back around him and allowing Dean, once again, to hold his hand. “‘Night, Cas.”
Cas feels warm, so warm, starting from his lips and the place where Dean’s holding his neck, and it’s spreading through him, and there’s love and there’s safety and oh, there’s arousal, too. Cas has never felt anything like this before; nothing so all-encompassing, never all of these good feelings all at once, never in his long existence—except for a little over an hour ago, when they kissed in the Empty. Would every kiss with Dean feel this way? And if so, what was there to keep them from kissing forever? How were they ever supposed to stop?
“You’ll get it back. One of these days your daddy’s gonna realize what he’s missing— maybe not all of it, I’m not saying he’ll understand. But one day he’s gonna need something from you, and you can ask for that camera back. My daddy won’t look me in the eye, don’t keep him from asking for money when he’s short.”
Jo swipes it up. “It was our pleasure, I’m sure. Dean was just saying what a considerate guest you been.”
Cas realizes suddenly. It’s a favor. Just a favor. He isn’t enjoying it. The thought dampens Cas’s mood significantly, but then Dean’s hand is on his bare chest, brushing through the hair there and wandering down low to grip his side and Cas doesn’t care. He will accept all of Dean’s conditions, no matter how damaging. No matter how difficult. Cas drops his head back, focuses on the feeling of Dean’s hand, and is surprised by a warm sensation on his right nipple. His breathing catches. It feels
She doesn’t say anything, just lets him go and tucks her hair behind her ear. There’s a yellowing bruise on her chin. “I done up your bed for you. Can get you some water if you like, or milk. And we got some strawberries coming in, in the garden. They’re real good.”
The memory of Cas keeps talking, tells him he has a great and divine purpose. They were so young. So stupid. They really believed all of Chuck’s lies.
Dean tells him. Cas asks more questions, and Dean answers each, how much he makes, Sam’s tuition, how much it cost for a house, for an apartment. Dean has to guess at the last two, but he answers them all, and then Cas is silent for a long time. It’s like he’s doing the math there on the spot, all in his head. Dean watches, and Cas thinks, and eventually he says,
“I forgive you,” says Dean. “Of course I forgive you. Don’t you ever—Don’t you ever think there’s something you could do I couldn’t forgive you for.”
“Dean. If you’re suggesting I rub myself on you like some kind of animal, and while you’re in pain, no less, I’m not going to do it.”
“Undo my trousers,” Dean says after a minute of this. “Get out my cock, but don’t touch any more than you have to.”
And with that exchange done, Cas and Dean are alone. They walk to the garage in silence but for the sounds of their steps and the jingle of keys in Dean’s hand.
Dean nods and swallows. They fall silent again. Uncertainty surrounds them. Cas seems to be either unwilling to speak or incapable of it, but for once Dean can read the expression on his face clear as day:
Another kiss. This one Dean catches with his lips. It’s like a fun game; Dean only has to say the thoughts in his head and he earns kisses from Cas. Dean raises a mischievous eyebrow.
Cas pulls off his pants and crawls up the bed until he’s straddling Dean’s shoulders. “Is this alright?”
“You ain’t gonna believe me, but it was. Ah—Hain’t no one ever— no one ever teased me like that. No one ever made me feel so good, checking up on me like that. Remembered every word I said. Talk so pretty. You’re so good to me, darlin’. So good. Fuck.”
Dean gets up, leaving Cas prostrate on the rug. He paces the room a few times, breathing like an old carthorse, then he heads over to the pile of clothes under the window. He starts to get dressed.
“I don’t need no more trouble like this here. And I hope this has been a lesson to you. You’re a smart, capable young man. You go and get yourself an honest job, and a wife, you hear?”
“Leave?” Cas frowns, like Dean’s said something confusing. Like he’d never considered it. Like he doesn’t even know the meaning of the word.
Cas leans over Dean, getting close to his face, calmer now, stroking himself slowly. “I’d like your permission.”
, and no explanation. Part of Dean wants to hurl a truck through a window, wants to yell at Cas, wants to demand a reason. The rest of him manages to overcome the urge. His primal urges were what got him into this mess in the first place. Anyway, Cas should’ve laughed him off when he first approached him years ago; was it really so shocking he was getting kicked to the curb now? Was it really so shocking that Cas didn’t want him?
He seems to be genuinely asking. Cas had been dumb enough to write the note, after all. Dean breathes out heavily. “No. No, they’ll be gone.”
Dean laughs, earning himself a jab in the side from Cas’s elbow. Cas is frowning at Balthazar darkly, so Dean leans in close to him to say, “You got big hands.”
good.” That feels even better. Dean closes his eyes and moans, lets himself just make sound and love and feeling.
“So did I,” Cas admits. “But your brother—“ A proud smile breaks out on Cas’s face. “the Empty— he filled it.”
“Benny,” says Dean definitively, pulling on Cas’s lip. He draws little circles on Cas’s ass with his other hand.
Cas talks a little more about it, about the layout of the ranch, about the choices of animals, but Dean barely listens. He’s staring at the focus of the drawing, at himself.
He finally moves to Cas’s mouth, which opens slowly, relaxed and ready to accept him. Cas is all sound, his body still and relaxed but for the hum in his chest like a purr, released as a gasping sigh whenever Dean pulls away from his lips. It takes Dean doesn’t know how long of kissing him before he gradually begins rolling languidly beneath Dean’s body, still humming that low, contented note, hands tightening around Dean’s.
“—Once he spoke to you, or possibly to someone else between Boston and Sister Jo’s. The point is, he didn’t come here for you. So, what did he come out here for in the first place?”
about it—“ Castiel catches himself before the rant can continue. “It took months to get him sober enough to even start on his own damn plan to come out here. We barely know one end of a cow from the other. I’ve been struggling just learning to eat and sleep.”
Dean brushes his fingers downward. He pets through the feathers in wonder. How could heat feel soft? How could light feel alive? There’s a humming sound coming from below him. Even that feels different than normal sound. It feels like love.
It’s not like sex is all he wants. But Cas wouldn’t understand if he asked for more. There wasn’t time for more. Dean wishes there was. How the hell was he supposed to figure all this out now, at the eleventh hour? Cas deserved time. Cas deserved— hell, Dean didn’t know. Better than him, anyway. Better than the Darkness.
Even after deciding to disobey, it had taken Dean years to start to think maybe he hadn’t deserved what he’d got, and when Dean had broken from John Winchester’s philosophy, he’d broken with all of it— if Dean’s actions hadn’t been wrong, John’s judgement had been. If John’s judgement was wrong, so was the world that had created and permitted it. So was the country, so was God, so was everything that wasn’t Sister Jo’s Good Times Saloon. Dean had turned his back on all of it.
Dean gets himself a mugfull and starts sipping from it while leaning against the counter. He’d jumped back into reality a little too quickly this morning, the fear in the back of his chest leaping to the fore. He tries to feel normal again, but it’s hard with Cas sitting right there, and in a black t-shirt of all things.
“It’s fine. Balthazar has been incredibly supportive. He even came up with the plan to come out here together. He’s a good brother.”
It’s strange, Cas thinks, how calm he feels. Was it normal to feel this way, after all of your wildest dreams came true? Shouldn’t he be jumping through the rafters, hollering from the rooftops, singing through the sky,
It doesn’t matter now. Because he’s gone, and soon you will be, too. And then I won’t have to hear about it anymore. The Winchester brothers— the two men who dared to defy God’s will will be. No. More.
“No, uh, but she done it for some of the other girls.” Bela always knew which houses in town were vacant.
“Heard he was run off with his tail between his legs,” says the guy whose name Dean can’t quite pin down. He’s a big guy, without much hair. Worked with John on some odd job once. Sheldon, or Sherb, or something. “Who was that man laid him out?” he asks, looking Dean in the eye.
Sweet thing. Dean smiles and leans in close. “I’d be delighted to.” He whispers it over Castiel’s lips, holding back for Castiel’s reaction. He doesn’t disappoint.
“Yes. No. Shit. I—” Cas’s finger crooks forward and Dean can’t speak for a moment. Cas is kissing his way along Dean’s thigh, irritatingly patient and loving, and Dean’s annoyance distracts him for a moment.
Cas supposed he was partly to blame for this. It had something to do with positive reinforcement. After all, whenever Dean broke out that word, Cas always gave in.
Cas’s voice breaks. “I thought— I thought maybe it meant you forgave me. But, I— I’ll just leave. I’m sorry.”
Cas brushes their thumbs together gently. “I mean, you said that you didn’t usually, with your clients.”
“I’m going to keep you,” Cas says. “Going to keep you and think about this. Think about you moaning on my cock.”
“You don’t have to be sorry for telling me to leave, Dean,” says Cas softly. “You were justified in your anger. I can’t imagine how stressed you must have been. Knowing what I know now, you were amazingly poised. You looked death in the face. You’re like a hero from a storybook.”
Dean nods. They could do that. “You just get whatever you can manage to me and I’ll give it to him.” If Cas ever came back, that was. If Dean decided to speak to him again.
In the morning, Cas is the first to wake for once. He moves to slide out from under Dean’s arm, but it grips him tighter.
It’s easy to oblige. He’s picturing sucking Cas’s cock, blue eyes staring down at him, large hands in his hair
Cas lifts a hand to Dean’s cheek. “Was I the thing that was different? Was it all in my head? It is different, isn’t it?”
There’s an unholy scream and light erupts around them. They are thrown to their knees and back to reality, still clinging to each other. Dean can’t see through the bright light; he’s coughing up slime, crying thick tears of ooze. His throat, his entire body feels as though it’s been drained and then sliced into jerky. Cas lets go of his arms and Dean realizes they were almost dead with lack of circulation. He forces his own shaking fingers apart, feebly tries to rub life back into Cas, but collapses to the floor instead, still coughing.
Crowley, in his insidious, petty, selfish machinations, had given Castiel hope. And so it had hurt like a comet to the ribcage a few weeks ago, when the world was ending and memories of another last night on earth were drifting to the surface of his conscious mind, when that hope, a small, winged, fluttering thing in his chest, was so casually murdered by Dean’s words.
Dean stands to go, but turns before he does. “Don’t think about— don’t think about him. Please. That’s what he wants, right? That’s what he’s doing. Messing with you.
“Hey, Krissy,” Dean says. “That was a killer right, but work on the left. Remember, it oughta come from your legs.”
Balthazar seems to cheer up the more visibly Dean’s in pain, and it makes him a little kinder. He even shares some jerky with Dean in the afternoon and gossips a bit about Cas’s time in grade school—an all boys’ school, according to him, and a testament to Cas’s obliviousness that he’d never gotten laid there.
“Attitude adjustment for both of y’all,” Dean mutters under his breath, once again the only one working out of the three of them.
confused by this, and Dean holds their hips together and keeps kissing Cas’s neck, careful not to leave a bruise.
To Dean, it was the closest thing to home he had, but it was also a sort of purgatory. He did like it, and sometimes he loved it; sometimes he even felt like he belonged there. The problem was that Dean didn’t believe he had the right to belong anywhere.
Dean walks Cas back to the bedroom, but doesn’t go in with him. Instead, he knocks on the door across the hall.
“Why are we in the backseat?” Cas asks as he sits down beside him, and Dean wonders how he ever became friends with someone so dense.
Sam looks at Cas. “Uh, I just. We’re low on paper towels. So, if you do decide to go, can you get some?”
This was the sort of thing that made rich city folk dress up in sparkling jewels and go to huge concert halls where tickets must cost more than Dean made in a week. And, listening to Balthazar, Dean couldn’t fault them for it. After all, the joy was in the performance, in the impossible level of skill necessary to play such a thing. In short, this was something you played to show off.
The hand leaves his buttons and returns to his waist, pressing him against the wall. The lips work their way upward, sending shivers through him until they reach his ear. Dean’s voice is shaky, furious.
“Then I’ll have to make it up to you.” Cas leans over him, and their lips meet. Dean pushes into Cas’s mouth, letting him know just how he feels about this situation. Cas groans around his tongue. They kiss for a moment longer, all tongues and spit, the taste of whiskey mingling between them before Cas breaks away to whisper in Dean’s ear. “What do you want?”
Holy hell. Cas’s hand finds a new, furious rhythm. Cas keeps at it, harder, faster, until, with a note of satisfaction, he makes Dean’s prayer come true. He brings Dean to a loud, gasping climax, back arching on top of Cas’s hand, fingers clinging to the very pillow that Cas suspects conceals his prize.
“Look at me, and that’s all? You’ve got me in your pocket, all tied up. You can see the bruises and bite marks you left all over me, and you ain’t even going to do me the honor of touching yourself while you look at the mess you done made of me?”
Dean laughs again, and this time he falls off completely. “Shoot, you are sweet,” he chuckles. “How’m I supposed to get you off when you keep being such a sweetheart?”
“Pretty impressive?” This is revolutionary stuff. There’ll be flying cars. I never understood why you guys never did the flying car thing. And a moon base. We’ll have a moon base. Full of monsters, of course.
Dean.” Dean accepts Cas’s kiss. He pushes down the urge to shove Cas off, to say he was nothing, just another small town whore with a no-good drunk for a daddy. He accepts the kiss and he deepens it, and he doesn’t break away until he’s ready to whisper,
Cas does, releasing his hold and gripping him by the shoulders instead, looking into his eyes with a pity that hurts worse than the hug had.
Jo goes ahead of them to prop the door open, so she doesn’t hear it when Sherwin Clark mutters at Dean. Donna’s grip on his chest tightens as he tries to escape and she hauls him out. Once they get through the door, the pain and the shame take over so strong that Dean can’t resist them anymore, and he lets himself be dragged through the blinding sun, back across town, up the porch, and into the house. They drag him all the way through it to the washroom, where they strip him down. Jo asks if he’s gotta hurl before dumping him into the empty tub and then dumping a cold bucket of water over him. They boil some water and start soaping him up, Dean batting them away and wriggling uncomfortably and generally making a nuisance of himself while Donna handles the water and Sister Jo starts cleaning him down, complaining over all his bruises and how stupid he was and what the hell was he thinking going to that place and it’s a good thing they knowed to go to the stupidest possible location to find him.
Cas doesn’t object to this, and Dean hands him his book back sourly. Cas offers him lunch and a kiss on the cheek.
“Come on,” he says, barely looking at Dean before walking off toward the barn. Dean hitches Sue-Anne to the porch rail and follows Bobby’s lantern across the grass. “Don’t suppose you’re planning on paying for this horse you want,” Bobby grumbles as he heaves the barn door open.
He asks it with the same nonchalant tone with which he always speaks, and it throws Dean violently from his original train of thought and strikes him temporarily dumb. “No, I— I always figured somebody else would take care of it for me.”
He slides off Cas’s cock, then pulls his fingers slowly out. Cas pants there on his bedroll, lying still and relaxed. “Amazing,” Cas says warmly, and Dean feels it deep in his soul. “You’re amazing, Dean.” Dean closes his eyes and absorbs it, tries to hold it inside, all of it, as he grips Cas’s knee and catches his breath. A moment later, he crawls forward and lies on top of Cas, wrapping his arms around him and listening to his heart in his chest, pumping out a victorious rhythm. Five years of sucking cock was worth it, if only for this. He listens to Cas’s heartbeat, to the wind in the leaves, to the empty sky beyond. Cas’s hand rubs his back. Dean tightens his grip.
Dean balls up his trash and throws it in the bag. He starts the car back up, takes them across the street, and they do a little shopping at a beaten-down old store that seems to have a small selection of everything. Dean grabs him deodorant, toothpaste, chapstick. Cas chooses a colorful t-shirt that says “Lebanon, KS, The Geographic Center of the US,” which Dean puts back on the hook with a gruff “No.” On a shelf of smaller items Cas finds a little prayer-a-day calendar. It’s not that he needs inspiration, exactly, but it has cute drawings of animals on it that Jack might like, so he takes it. Dean gives it a raised eyebrow when Cas places it on the counter, but doesn’t say anything, just gets out his card.
“What’s that?” Dean asks, suckered in now, willing to play along. Cas leans over him, a smile twitching at his lips.
Cas sits on the foot of the bed and begins putting on his shoes. Dean likes it when Cas wears more clothes than him.
“He is very manipulative,” Cas says softly. Dean looks up, probably too much hope in his face. “I understand how it happened— but why didn’t you tell me? When we discussed him?”
“—Yes, yes,” says Crowley, waving his hand. “The process isn’t important. What matters is that people believe I can make their dicks bigger.”
For a minute, they are quiet, as the piece grows more complicated and Balthazar has to focus. The music is dark and loud and thudding, and Dean doesn’t know enough about piano to know what’s impressive and what isn’t, but judging from the frown on Cas’s face, this piece really was beyond him, as Balthazar had claimed. Bal, however, is sitting up with perfect posture, expression relaxed even as the piece isn’t. His hands move firmly and confidently across the keyboard, and Dean thinks it’s the first time he’s seen Balthazar actually be good at something.
After losing yet another hand, Balthazar throws his cards down and makes a dismissive sound. “Honestly, Cassie, ragtime?” he asks, getting up and striding over to the piano. “We are supposed to be spreading culture over the continent, not this schlock. Move over.”
Dean breathes out. He hands the cigarette back, hand steady as a surgeon’s. Bal takes it in hand with the posture of a seasoned smoker, though Dean knows he isn’t one.
Couldn’t Cas have said one easy thing? Just one thing that didn’t seem to melt Dean’s brain and drive his heart out of his chest?
“I hate you,” he finds himself saying. There’s a lot to say it for. For choosing John, for having kids, for leaving them. He doesn’t know if it was her smoking or John’s drinking that caused that fire; nobody alive did, anymore. Some things weren’t for knowing, he supposes. But he has a hunch, that maybe it was the both of them: her smoking, and him making her want to drop the match. Could it have ended any differently, when the world had kept them together long past the time they fell apart?
Dean grips Cas’s arm. Cas is gripping him back. The world is black. He can’t see. He’s gasping for air. How the hell is he supposed to tell him without words, without sound?
“I said, must get lonely for you. Ain’t got no brothers or sisters. Heard you don’t get along with your momma. You got a daddy?”
Cas ignores him, staring out the window again. “You sucked him off? That’s all two dollars pays for, right? The tiger?”
He pops off, coughs, curses “Fuck me,” under his breath, not meaning anything by it but a curse, but then,
Jo. And he’s a repeat. I can get him to come back. Swear it to Christ Almighty I can, if we give him his money’s worth.”
In the bathroom, Dean finds Cas’s wet boxers hanging on the curtain rod. Hand washed, Dean realizes. That explained Cas’s soap question. Hell. Dean had been fucking around with angel deals while his best friend was homeless. He washes up in a haze of guilt, then leaves the bathroom (fully dressed in his pajamas, thank you very much), and goes to his wallet. He’s only got a hundred in cash. He stuffs it into Cas’s pants pocket, and then stares at Cas, still in the wet towel and half-off the bed. He nudges Cas awake.
had been Sam’s question. Dean really had forgotten to ask. It didn’t seem that important, all told. Dean thinks he gets it already, anyway. He couldn’t explain it to Sammy if he tried. But he gets it.
“You’re right, though. I’m not good at reading people. Balthazar had to tell me,” Cas confesses, resting his hands over Dean’s on his hips. “But once he did, it was obvious. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of you.”
“First things first,” says Balthazar as they have breakfast at one of the Sunrise Inn’s two tables. “I vote we go back and stay in the Casa Bonita tonight.”
Jo gives him the same steely glare she gives all the troublemakers in her house. “I didn’t know, Dean. I was advised to optimize the safety of my girls for the night, and I did that.”
It’s confusing, like Cas can read Dean’s mind. Even Dean is having trouble reading his own mind. It’s going too fast. He tries to figure out what kind of wood the chair leg is made of. Looks like oak.
Cas agrees with another tobacco grit “Of course,” and Dean gets them both up to strip the bed. Dean shows Cas where the spare sheets are in the dresser, then throws on a robe and heads down to the laundry room, where he dumps the dirty sheets in the giant tub to soak. Then he heads to the washroom and cleans himself up. He returns to room three with the washroom mirror in hand, and gives it to Cas on the newly-made bed. Cas frowns into the mirror like it’s broken or something. Dean supposes it is a little fogged, but it works well enough.
He’s twenty-two years old again, lying naked under a live oak tree in the night, dreaming of something different. But he’s not afraid anymore the way he’d been back then. He’s afraid of other things, now. Asking, he can manage. “Do you want to come live with me? In Abilene?”
Dean tries to keep track—of the sounds, of Balthazar’s fingers, of the various techniques he knows he’s supposed to be impressed by—but soon he can barely even track Balthazar’s hands as they run swiftly across the entire piano. This sort of piece must take years to master, and here Balthazar was doing it as casually as a party trick, still with perfect posture, eves closed, looking just like a virtuoso should look. By the end of the piece, instead of a few short notes at a time, he’s playing many at once, in quick succession, hands bouncing up and down impossibly quickly, muscles taut, the music so complex it sounds chaotic, until with a final, booming, chord, he finishes.
“I’ve been keeping an eye on the news,” Eileen continues. “Everyone remembers the Empty, so there is a lot of panic. Lots of crazy things to sift through.”
“Not even the kitchen?” Dean wheedles. “For such a polite and well-spoken gentleman, who never did none of your girls any harm?”
The kindness had been the worst part, that rare, kind tone with which he tore Cas’s heart from his chest. Cas wished he could cherish Dean’s kindness, could rise above all this somehow instead of sinking deeper into hidden, covetous desire. He should take some small comfort that at least he’d hidden it well. Then again, sometimes he wishes he didn’t bother to hide it at all. Let Dean see the look in his eyes and understand his devotion, not as the filial thing he assumed all love to be, but something else. Let Dean deal with the confusion, the emotion. Let Dean be the one to sit in discomfort.
Dean hums to himself, and watches Cas’s brow relax as he does. He starts to sing: Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do, and Cas smiles, and sketches, and damn. If that wasn’t sweet as hell.
“Strange gun for a cowboy to have, wouldn’t you say? Couldn’t hit a coyote, or a rabbit, or an Indian. Nothing that far away.”
“Mm.” Dean slides over and kisses Cas, resting his arms around Cas’s strong shoulders. He had the best job in the world.
“—Yes?” Crowley actually has the nerve to sound excited at Cas’s interruption, and it sours the question in Cas’s mouth. “You want all the lurid details?”
, so good. Dean lifts his head slowly upward, coating Cas’s cock in saliva, and then dives back down, erotically far, rubbing against him with his tongue, gagging for just a fraction of a second, then sucking back upwards again, covering the whole length of him twice before descending into a bobbing rhythm, and Cas practically collapses back into the seat in anticipation of a climax that he’s never felt before but instinctively knows won’t take long to arrive.
That’s just fine. Dean isn’t in a line of work where being picky is much of an advantage. He sidles over to the table and notes that they don’t even have beers yet.
Insults are traded, creative ones, words Dean hasn’t heard for a long time, words that make his head and chest throb. Words in a voice that he knows better than his own.
It goes on, until Dean is fully hard again and there’s a giant wet patch on his drawers. Castiel comes up again to kiss him proper, then he repositions his hat on Dean’s head and fetches a pad of paper and piece of charcoal from his jacket.
After a few minutes Cas shifts them around, reversing the position so it’s Cas leaning on Dean’s chest. Dean pets Cas’s hair. Pretending to be calm has actually calmed him pretty well.
“Thought you wanted to ruin me. You don’t like it even a little bit? Don’t want to draw me all pink and fucked-looking?” Dean lets a hand wander down to Cas’s neck.
feels too raw, so soon after fighting over Dean’s lack of boundaries, so he doesn’t say it. But it’s still true.
After a moment, Dean just closes his eyes and leaves his mouth open, tilting his head back for Cas, his beautiful face vulnerable and free and waiting. What a magnificent gift.
The girls bustle around him; Donna tries to talk to him, but he ignores her, putting on his boots and pacing the room impatiently. Cas missing, a locked door, the sheriff come to visit, Sam’s message—Tell the truth about
They roll into town and check in at the motel and Dean’s already made plans. This may be Jack’s case, but as far as Dean is concerned, it’s his vacation. It’s starting to get late, so he grabs Cas and sets out with him before the stores close, leaving Sam and Jack to finish setting up in the room.
The info Cas wrote him about Judaism is easier to look at than the letters themselves. It’s not so personal in subject matter, but it’s familiar, and still identifiably Cas; witty and dry and informative. Dean pours over it until he hears a door open in the hall, then he freezes.
Dean loads the machine. We can see into the living room beyond, where Cas, Sam, Jack, and Eileen are playing a board game. Eileen is winning.
They’re all looking Dean in the eye, Edgar, Rick, and even Old Jim, still on the floor nursing his stomach. Nobody moves. Nobody even drinks. They actually
“It’s conceivable that I might have, as you say. If I were to lose control I could release a pulse of grace strong enough to blind or even destroy you.”
“Dean,” says Cas as they walk back to the car. “I can’t help but notice you introducing me to everyone in town.”
Dean gets increasingly frustrated as he speaks. Sam is still calm. He is CONTENT (not happy) with this Heaven after a long, boring-ass life. At least he’s with another person now. (It’s a strange thought to have, but he doesn’t want to examine why.)
Jack has a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Close on Dean’s face. We dive into Dean’s memories through more old FOOTAGE, now with audio: “I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.” Looks. Touches. Purgatory. “You asked what about this is real. We are.” Prayers. Smiles. “Good things do happen, Dean.” Chuck telling them they’re not supposed to be there, they’re not in this part of the story. “Yeah, well. We’re making it up as we go.” Dean’s reaction. And finally, “Everything you have ever done […] you have done for love.” “You changed me” “I love you, Dean.”
Cas had fixed it. Most nights, anyway. Dean didn’t worry or care if he fell asleep anymore; all he wanted was to lie in his bed and look at his picture til all he could see was Cas. All he wanted to do was think about him. Think about how sweet he was. Think about the way his eyes could practically disappear or be wide and blue as anything. Think about him out there on the range, holding his little pad of paper, trying to draw Dean, frustrated with himself and without a reference, drawing Dean over and over, page after page til he looked right.
Bal offers the cigarette and Dean takes it. He breathes it in, feels the smoke warm and brighten the inside of his chest. Eyes closed, Dean lets it lift him for a moment. He thinks of his mother, of fire, of dry hay, of an ember, a spark, a man’s cry.
Cas thinks to himself. Crowley knows if Dean’s disinterest is anatomical or personal. Crowley knows exactly what Dean’s inclinations are, in his darkest moments, with no inhibitions whatsoever. Crowley knows if Cas has any chance at all. His curiosity gets the better of him, and he interrupts whatever Crowley is droning on about now. “When Dean was a demon—“
“Stop that, this instant, or I’ll have Fergus come break you up again. I expect compensation for my services, by the way, in the form of tea, Cas, if you please, and if this podunk little—oh, my God.”
“You talking ‘bout the horse, or me?” Dean winks. Baby trots back and forth, like she wants Cas to pick her.
He luckily hadn’t needed to skim the sermon to understand the letter; he already knew the terms Cas had used, from Rufus, who had only bothered to explain Passover when Dean had used a combination of bribery and prodding to work him into a rant. The man was not, as Cas had called him, a more convenient source of information. He had cost Dean the rest of that bottle of whiskey they’d bought, not to mention most of Dean’s patience.
With that, Cas fucks him, fucks him so hard he falls off the pillow and they have to set back up and then Cas slides back in easily and does it again, fucks him til he’s crying out just like Cas said he wanted him to. Conscious of the people in the room next to them, Dean bites his own hand to shut himself up, but Cas pulls it away, pins both of Dean’s hands down and fucks him hard until he’s groaning and begging, just the words
Dean frowns at the sky, shadows of grey smoke obscuring the stars. “You need something stronger than tobacco, amigo.”
Sister Jo watches them all from the porch, arms crossed, hair up, too-expensive dress billowing in the wind.
“I—“ but Dean can’t finish the sentence. It was a nice horse. It was the nicest thing John Winchester had ever owned.
“Cas,” Dean says, and he’s utterly unable to stay stoic now. “I’m sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have asked you to do that. You said you didn’t want to, and I should’ve respected that. But you gotta talk to me, man. You can’t just hide in your room being mad at me.”
“I seem to have been restored more or less how I was,” Cas admits miserably. “My grace has been depleted, but is still there.”
good boy,” Cas agrees, sending shivers through Dean’s skin. Cas’s thumbs dig into Dean’s shoulders, massaging them loose, then a hand traces down his back and stops in the middle of it. “Jesus, Dean. Did you break your spine?”
“Naw. I’m fine. Just… let’s just stand here, Cas.” He hopes it doesn’t sound like begging. He just wants to be close, to hold Cas in his hands, to confirm he’s alive. Alive. He’s alive.
“This is what that is, Dean. Having someone who cares about you. Who admires you. I think you want it. I think maybe you need it.”
Cas does it again, still not really fucking or thrusting, too slow, just sliding slowly in and out, like testing a piston, making sure all the parts are working together properly. Dean can feel that spot, his prostate, he supposes, getting teased, not quite happy with the pace or the angle. Dean doesn’t mind it. He’s watching Cas’s face, Cas’s expression of pure wonder.
“Well then, we need a dam—dang—root cellar.” Dean feels like they’re fighting, but Cas is smiling at him. “What’re you making that face for?”
Cas catches them at it and frowns darkly, prompting an “Oh, cheer up, Smiley!” from Balthazar and a painful laugh from Dean.
“Cas—” Dean gasps, but Cas just kisses him. The more they kiss, the less everything hurts. He can even rut up against Cas now without thinking about it, like his muscles remembered they don’t mind moving, actually, so long as it has to do with fucking Cas. He’s getting damn uncomfortable in Cas’s britches, and he reaches down to unbutton them. At that, Cas crawls off him completely, and Dean protests before Cas gets ahold of him in his hand, pumping him a couple times, then sucking briefly on his tip. Dean shuts up with a shuddering intake of breath at the sudden warm, soft, wet feeling.
comfortable mattress. Still, it seems a shame to just go to bed without any more to-do, especially in a place like this. He’d spied a bar, from the lobby, and there had been people down there, and a piano. Maybe he could make some friends. Talk Sammy up, get him some new clients. They had a baby on the way, after all; they needed all the help they could get.
Cas kisses his cheek. “Thank you. Can I show you something? It’s a drawing. I’m not sure you’ll be able to see it, actually, but.”
The corner of Dean’s mouth twerks up, confused, like he wasn’t expecting that word from Cas. “Yeah?” is all he says.
“I wanted—Shit—I wanted you to just take me, like when you stole the Colt. I wanted you to just hold me down and make me feel good. Fuck. Make me feel so good.”
He has a hard time sleeping. Cas is awake, of course, and so he doesn’t mind Dean shifting around, but after a while it’s obvious that Michael won’t let him rest.
The sheriff slaps them down on the little table. “You keep that, too,” he says, gesturing to the confession in Dean’s hands. “And don’t go passing it around. Don’t need the press writing about no homosexual Jewish murderers and giving everyone the wrong impression of Abilene. We’re good people, here. Far as I’m concerned I never saw that note. It don’t exist. Your daddy was feuding with half the people in this town. Folks won’t ask questions about him. this ‘Cas’ don’t seem like a menace to society to me. Is he a menace to society?”
“Hate is a strong word. You were just using me for your own ends. Who doesn’t, these days.” Crowley trails off into blissful silence, his depressing statement hanging in the air for a few moments before he speaks again, voice a quiet growl over the rumble of the engine. “We could use each other again, you know. For more than this Lucifer thing. I could help you.” Cas glances over, but finds no clue as to what Crowley is talking about. He’s fiddling with one of the air vents, tweaking it with a finger. It doesn’t matter what he intends, anyway.
Dean’s lips pull away and there’s a small patch of cold on Cas’s cheek where a bit of saliva was left behind. It grows colder as Dean breathes in, the air rushing over Cas’s skin and into Dean’s lungs, and Cas closes his eyes. He’s in shock. The lips—
. There is too much frustration, anticipation, need. Cas gives in to it, flexes his hips, pushes into Dean just as Dean comes down on him, and—
“Not the way it does for Christians. Jews are not under a mandate to believe in God. It is more important,” he says, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, “to act in accordance with certain principles.”
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean moves back up to Cas’s face before he knows what he’s doing. He stops himself just above Cas’s lips, takes a steadying breath. Controls himself.
The brothers stand face to face, knives drawn, ready to stab each other in the heart. They take a breath.
There’s a strange flicker in Cas’s eye as he says, “Yes. Butterflies, as well. Did you know monarch butterflies migrate all the way to Mexico for the winter?”
“Dean,” he moans, gripping Dean’s shoulders and thrusting into Dean’s hand and Dean leans closer, lips tickling against his ears and sending shivers down Cas’s neck.
Dean goes back and reads the letter a third time, compliments included, stopping before the filth. He feels guilty for making Cas worry. He wonders if he should, as Cas had suggested, ask Charlie about this.
Cas makes a shy, happy little face, like he hadn’t believed Dean when he said he wasn’t going to charge him, and can’t believe his luck now that it’s happening.
“I’m not in the business of telling cowboys what to do. I protect my girls, Dean. That’s what I do.”
“Yeah. Feels good,” says Dean. It looks worse than it is, now that time has passed. He’s bruised up, is all.
Cas stands back up and walks to the foot of the bed. “Tell me what you want, Dean.” Cas was a soldier, damn it. He could follow orders.
You want to talk about truth? About reality? Me, Dean, Mohinder— Didn’t we come from you, from your feelings? So why do you try to ruin us, to impose some grand plan on us? When you write well, when you write the truth, that’s us.
“—No, no. It went great. He’s thrilled.” Dean is surprised at the feeling as he says it, surprisingly good, lighter somehow.
The bed hasn’t been made, so they decide to bring the wool blanket and some pillows onto the rug, where they settle into each other back to front; just like lovers proper, Dean thinks to himself in satisfaction. Dean warms up quick enough with Cas’s arms wrapped around him. He strokes Cas’s arm hair slowly.
Dean feels that, feels Cas’s words roll through his body and down his dick. “Yes, baby,” he manages to say.
They lapse into silence until the bartender brings the beer. Cas thanks him. He seems just as shy and polite as ever. Dean knows it’s a lie, just like his kid, throwing ‘sorry’s’ around while running and crashing into people.
“Mm. Feels good when you say it. You been so good to me today. I wonder what you’re fixing to do to me tonight, while you have me for real and in-person? I wonder what else you’re going to remember doing to me when you’re out there. You gonna tell me about it?”
“Oh, go ahead,” he says, in a tone much too sweet for a man being blackmailed. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you. You’re really taking her from John.”
Cas looks smaller in the tiny room. He’s standing still between the pump faucet and the big tub, hands at his sides, shirt half off, as if unsure what to do with himself. Dean ruffles a hand through Cas’s hair and kisses him, then pulls back, just to see the look in Cas’s eyes. Just to see Cas want him.
The “I love you, Dean” carries us back to present. CLOSE on Dean’s face. Dean is teary. He knows what he needs to do.
“Well, shit,” Dean says finally, friendly as he can manage, “come take a load off. Let me buy you a drink. You drinking, nowadays?”
“Neighbor’s supposed to be helping with the livestock. We should check and see if she’s out there. You can sneak out while she’s busy.”
Chuck levels his gaze at Sam, but, after a moment, rolls his eyes and SNAPS his fingers, teleporting to the witness stand and into his everyday clothes.
My next project is a Western!AU, which is satisfying my need to write an out and proud Dean after all this repression nonsense. I have no idea when it’ll be ready to post, but it definitely will post eventually since I already have 50k words of it. It features: old timey prostitute!Dean, rich boy-turned-cowboy!Cas, almost Everyone as Dean’s siblings, John Winchester’s A+ parenting, old timey benevolent whorehouse madam!Anael, bitter ex!Crowley, not-bitter not-exactly-an-ex!Benny, lots of people wearing hats, and, uh, lots of hats getting knocked/taken off, if you know what I mean. So stay tuned if you are interested in that.
“Dean.” The voice pitches lower, a warning. Dean looks up. Hell, he should know better than to call a man a queer by now. A man could get himself shot for less. He was letting himself get distracted. Lost his head.
“There’s that handsome face,” Dean says as he finally finishes and surveys his handiwork. “Wanna see?”
“Turn around,” Dean orders. “Lean over the edge.” He lays a towel down on the floor and fetches the shaving kit from the vanity cabinet, then he grabs a bucket and half-fills it from the tub. He works the cream into a lather and brushes it onto Cas’s beard, scrubbing it in all the way down to the skin. Then he scrapes the hair from Cas’s face slowly, carefully, tilting his head here and there. He talks while he does it, about Sister Jo, about Benny, about the girls, about the time Donna had frightened one mean customer away with only insults and a bad attitude (of course she’d had a revolver in her skirts anyway). Cas laughs at that, and Dean pulls the razor away to let him do it.
Beat. We watch both faces at once as it finally hits. This is the Bad Place. Dean gets ANGRY. Sam starts to PANIC.
“—No, I ain’t done yet. And I ain’t looking for pity. The point is— The point is, this is serious, Cas. And like I said, it ain’t about who, or why. It’s him. His feelings need somewhere to go. And I’m his favorite target.”
Dean laughs softly at him; Cas is still facing away, like if he looks at Dean, he’ll break. “Thought you done forgave me.”
Oh, it was too easy. Who even used words like that? “I love a rigorous ride,” drawls Dean, letting the words fall out of him thick and sweet as honey. “And I love a big, tough, cowboy talking to me about it. Tell me, sweetheart, you been a big smoker since you was knee-high or is that voice God-given?”
Charlie stands and comes behind his chair, putting her hands on his shoulders. “Dean, this man saved you. That’s right to me.” She leans down and kisses his head. “Now if you’re done apologizing for that shithead, I got to get home and make sure he don’t hit our sister the way he done hit every other Winchester on the planet.” Charlie pats his shoulder and moves to leave.
Dean rolls his eyes. Not like he was new to inebriation. He would’ve got himself some water eventually. He grabs a bottle of water and holds it. “Legally, this here’s a saloon. All the saloons in the dime novels got player pianos.”
Cas has quieted, run out of things to say, maybe. He’s resting his head up on Dean’s pillow, breathing tickling breaths onto Dean’s neck.
A minor tragedy in this chapter is that due to Balthazar's American-ness in this AU I had to cut a joke. So just know that when he and Cas walk in on Dean playing with the cigarette, in his heart Balthazar would say "stop fingering that fag" if he could.
I have a feeling this is going to be the Most Canonical of all these because you can NOT convince me this conversation didn’t happen.
Dean smiles as he lies there, totally relaxed with Cas tense as an angry bear above him. “Sorry, darlin’.”
“Shoot, ain’t nothing wrong with a little of that. Anyone with a problem with it just needs to get out more.”
“Basherter?” Dean whispers back, a stutter in his heartbeat, not sure if he’s managed to remember the word wrong after all these years.
Listen, you dropped all that crap at my door and you left, Cas. You left and I didn’t get to say anything, and that’s not right.
Cas can only stare. It’s hard to accuse Dean of making fun of him when Dean’s staring at him like—Cas has never been stared at this way before.
Cas blinks at him, then his eyes fall to the floor. “No. You weren’t.” He stands, holding his hat uncertainly, staring at Dean like Dean’s gonna change his mind. Dean just steps to the side, leaving the path clear for Cas to get out. Cas walks by and Dean shuts the door behind him. He slumps down onto his bed in the spot Cas had just been sitting, eyes closed, just trying to breathe. It doesn’t seem to be working. His chest just gets tighter and tighter, the air thinner and thinner.
Dean shakes his head, a pool of shame bubbling up inside of him. Cas didn’t even know the man. “We doing this thing, or not?”
Across the table, Dean keeps looking at him. He’s not trying to hide it, either. Whenever Cas catches him staring, he holds eye contact for a few more seconds before glancing away again. Cas isn’t sure what it means. Maybe Dean was just processing, getting used to whatever they were. Maybe Dean was thinking about him, then getting self conscious. Maybe this was just normal behavior for human couples (eye contact was a significant expression of love in many cultures). Whatever it is, Cas doesn’t mind it. He keeps smiling, to himself, to Dean. He listens to Jack describing their time in the Empty. They’d waited so long.
Dean smiles wider. He raises again—no reason not to. Tagg, after deliberating, calls. So does Cas. They show their hands.
He holds her. She’s too big; last he saw her he could still throw her around like a gunny sack. But she’s alive.
Cas smiles at him through the sides of his eyes, which are soft and kind as anything. Dean really can’t stay mad.
Cas licks the side of his cock from base to tip, then tilts his head sideways the other way, kissing at the other side now, seemingly unperturbed by Dean’s distress.
“Alright.” Dean shifts around, bringing his hand up and counting on his fingers. “First off, there’s a lot of people in this world who fall for whores. See ‘em every day. Bela and Ruby could start a fucking parade of all the gentlemen come knocking on their doors. But I ain’t gonna charge you no more, which means that I ain’t your whore, so your brother can put that on his plate and eat it. But, you know what else?”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” but Sam is laughing harder than ever. “Where did you even take him? Happy hour and then McDonald’s?”
Sam blinks at him for a moment, then shifts his weight and says. “Uh, you should shower before shaving. The hot water opens your pores.”
Cas shrugs his shirt off his shoulders, still staring at Dean. Dean handles his trousers and holds his hand as he steps into the tub with a hiss.
he spits it. Though Dean’s heard the name before, he doesn’t know what’s offensive about Wagner. “And for another thing, I’ve lived in New York before. Where do you think I studied? Where do you think I ran to, when I left home? It’s a wonderfully filthy place, with temptation on every corner. Sex, drugs, and alcohol without ever having to walk more than a block. They have the most wonderfully seedy opium dens there; you know you can nearly get high just from walking in? And they’ll let you just marinate there for weeks. They don’t throw you out until your money runs out. And I mean all of it. They’ll take the shirt off your back as collateral. Of course by that point you’re incapable of making any money at all, you’re so far out of your own mind.
“Nothing, darlin’. This is— Just be you.” That was it, in the end. No matter what Cas had done, Cas was still Cas. And Cas had been family, too. Still was. Cas was the sort of family that was good. That made him happy. That made him feel safe. And he deserved that.
good, darlin’.” Dean releases Cas’s mouth, and is surprised when Cas surges forward. He catches Cas’s head in his hands and clicks his tongue. “Impatient. You gotta ask, darlin’. You’re playing fair today, remember? Gotta ask first.”
Cas blinks and looks away. The spell is broken. “I’m sorry. I’ve been told I can be a little unsettling.”
“I’m being sincere. Most of the things my father hates about people are things I’d consider their more positive features.” Cas sketches a little, flips the page, sketches more. He thinks for a minute. “I suppose he’d hate your kindness towards me the most.”
Cas hits Dean a few more times on the torso, then he approaches the bed. He kisses Dean’s back, leans down and kisses his side, tries to reach everywhere he hit.
Dean sighs in relief, a puff of air in Cas’s face. All Cas can think about is Dean’s lips, hovering just over his own. Then Dean’s hands start pulling at the bottom of Cas’s shirt, working it up and out of where it’s messily tucked into his slacks, and a moment later Dean’s fingers are brushing Cas’s sides, spreading fireworks across his skin. It’s so much. It’s everything. Cas wants more. “Then what’s wrong?” Dean asks, brushing Cas’s stomach with his thumbs.
Sam and Dean BOOK IT. They run into the trees near the Roadhouse, never mind that they don’t know where they’re going.
“Fucking seeing green right now.” What kind of name was ‘Tagg,’ anyway? Why hadn’t any of Cas’s letters mentioned him?
“And they got a girl, Patty, will handle the water for you, and bring you food and beer while you soak. She’s real nice.”
Dean scuffs the heel of his boot against the stone step, wishing he had something to destroy. Could go out back and shoot after this, grab whoever wanted to come with him and shoot all their parents’ old guns until they ran out of ammo.
“You paid the telegraph company for eight extra letters just to compliment my drawing of some cattle. I know you need money. I know you’re paying for Sam’s school.
Cas gets on his knees, and Dean leans back, relaxing into the rough texture of the wall and closing his eyes. Cas’s mouth envelopes him gently, sending waves of pleasure up into his abdomen, and Dean grips Cas’s head in his hand instinctively. God, he feels good. Warm and familiar and comfortable.
grace shining from his eyes and his gaping mouth. Dean, from between his legs, watches in wonder until his eyes start to burn. After that, Cas’s face is pink, his chest is heaving, and his fingers keep wringing the pillowcases; he’s overstimulated. Dean lets him have a break and moves up for more kissing. Cas’s mouth is open wide. He holds Dean to him, lips at first not even kissing back, just open, just willing, but then, as Cas holds, as Dean persists, he slowly starts moving them again in a sloppy, wet, sort of delirium.
The man whose name Dean can’t remember breaks it. “It true your sister’s opening for business soon?”
“I didn’t say that. It’s just I ain’t hardly wearing any clothes to begin with and somehow you’re undressing me with your eyes.”
“Get used to it, kid,” says Dean, grinning from ear to ear. “I ain’t going nowhere. Not til your daddy gets sick of—This tie on backwards?” He turns it over in his hand, but Cas just takes it back and stuffs it in his frock.
FADE IN on an aerial shot of SAM and DEAN driving down the road in Heaven to the tune of Steppenwolf’s MAGIC CARPET RIDE. Closer: The windows are down, wind blows through Sam’s hair. The tone of the shot is happy— it’s heaven! We made it!— but the boy’s faces are BLANK.
Sam swallows. “Right. You’re right.” And he begins to compile the components for the spell and to read the latin. It’s a long one; Dean is sure he couldn’t have done it himself. It takes over an hour, without breaks, without misreads. Sam speaks it clearly on the first try.
, radiating through him, tickling his skin, drawing a gasp, unbidden, up and through him, and then Dean is humming against his neck. Cas closes his eyes as Dean’s voice vibrates inside of him as if it were his own. This, at least, he understands. Frequencies were easier than all the rest of it. He lets it dance in his grace, passing through him like waves through the ocean.
Cas hums approval, as if it was a test and Dean chose the right answer. He leaves the room, and Dean stands there for a moment before something clicks in his brain.
In this chapter, one male character fingers another male character while they each compare the other to The Biblical Moses. Which, like, is far from the number one reason I’d go to hell, but I do think it'd make for a decent ice breaker when meeting other damned souls.
There’s more fumbling noises coming from the phone. When Cas speaks again, the quality of his voice has changed— Dean’s on speaker.
“Oh, yeah. If there’s one thing Daddy likes, it’s a big, angry horse. But I got him tame for me by the time I was fifteen.”
But here they were, weren’t they. Cas’s god was looking out for him again, bringing them back together in an unexpected place. “Coulda just written me,” Dean says, a little snottily. Cas doesn’t answer him. It takes Dean a few minutes before he realizes that it’s because Cas has fallen asleep. He waits as long as he can stand to.
“You know, I’m glad you came out here tonight,” Dean tells her. “I’m real glad to see you.” Hell, he hadn’t even been sure she’d remembered him anymore. “But I don’t need you getting your hide tanned for it. Ain’t worth it. Charlie’s good at talking. Stuff like this happens, you talk to her.”
Dean turns to Cas, who’s holding his hat in one hand uncertainly. Dean feels electric. He’s about bouncing in his boots.
Dean wonders if he’d hurt Cas that night, or if Cas was indifferent to the whole experience. He wants to ask: Hey, Cas, remember when I blew you? Was that as traumatizing for you as it was for me? Want to try it again?
“Every man is king of his castle, as they say. But we here are castle-less. Your father threw you out, too, didn’t he? Isn’t that what drove you to sin and prostitution and all that?”
“Thought you wanted to fuck,” Dean mumbles as Cas dribbles oil on his shoulders and begins rubbing them. They were gonna need another bath tonight.
Dean frowns, turns his head though of course it’s not enough to see Cas when he’s right behind him. “Who said anything about using anybody?”
“Hm. My daddy likes whiskey, too.” Dean plays with a glass, considering, then sets it back down. “Can I watch you?” he asks Cas, peeking down at the sketchbook. He hasn’t even started drawing yet.
Dean falls silent and sits back down. He holds his head in his hands and starts counting. He gets to thirty-two before Cas speaks.
“Her sire’s Perdition. Thought you’d see the resemblance. John wanted him paired up with old Junie, and they made Pandemonium here. He’s coming to pick her up in a couple of months.” Dean can see the resemblance, now that Bobby’s told him. “You know I had to convince him to take her?” Bobby goes on irritably. “He wanted another stallion.”
Dean gives in silently and they raid the cupboards clumsily in the dark, eventually finding a large jug of oil from which they pour a bowl full.
Dean hadn’t been able to tell. He’d been too busy acting stupid, himself. “You still drunk?” he asks.
“I suppose so,” says Cas, and it hurts how defeated he sounds, like he doesn’t want to see Dean ever again.
Two Fridays come and go, and for each, Cas asks Balthazar to sing a prayer over the fire, for the sabbath they didn’t keep.
Sam nods. “Sure thing. But Jo isn’t mad at you. The rest of us were. But she wasn’t. Said if she’d had the opportunity to ride off with a blue-eyed dreamboat, she’d’a taken it, too.”
Come on, Sam! Not you, too. And here I’m letting you exist, the very last of my creations. You’ve outlasted Death itself. That’s something to be proud of. Anyway, as I was saying— you know what else people like? Alternate history. So, I’ll make a planet that’s like Earth, but tweak it here and there, right? Like, maybe there were a few more genocides. Doesn’t that sound interesting? And maybe, like… what if cops had superpowers?
Cas looks at him, eyes wide and blue while Dean just waits there, wide open and waiting, until Dean starts to squirm.
“—It is. And you don’t have to defend my actions, certainly not to me. I know what I did. I’m comfortable with it, and I’ve accepted the consequences.”
He brings Cas to orgasm once, twice, three times in what can’t be more than an hour. He’s never tried to give Cas multiple orgasms before, but it turns out the guy has a crazy short refractory period. Angel perks, Dean guesses. With each climax Cas moans louder, writhing more and more desperately beneath Dean’s hands, and the third time he comes, Cas actually
Sister Jo says something, and John replies, “You can’t threaten me! This is a public street. I demand to see my son. I know he’s in there, hiding out like the cowardly little shit licker he is—”
“Hmm. Well, that’s just fine,” Dean decides. “You stay there with your angle and talk at me in that God-given voice of yours. Tell me what it is you want this picture for.”
Dean waits for Cas to say more, but he doesn’t. The moment stretches awkwardly. “You don’t gotta say it back,” Dean says, too late. “I just. I wanna know you ain’t fooling around with me.” He wants to know Cas isn’t going to rent an apartment with him and then skip town with Crowley a week later. He wants to know Cas won’t turn tail and run when a neighbor calls him a queer, or if his rich daddy calls him up to invite him home. He wants something permanent.
Cas’s expression hardly changes. He stares at the drawing of himself for a moment before pulling it up and to the side. He reads through one letter, then another. Dean is dying; to get up, to say something, to ask Cas to say something. That was his heart, in Cas’s hands, being casually read through like the dime novel that held it. Dean gets up and stands next to the bed in suspense, staring at Cas’s expression, but it’s just as unreadable from here as it had been from the tub.
What disturbs him is himself. He wants to be clinical, wants to read his parts off the script and feel nothing. But what really happens, when he hits Dean, is… he enjoys it. And he hates it. He hates that he finds pleasure in it and finds pleasure in the hatefulness of it. It’s more than he can put words to. It’s overwhelming.
Huh. Well, when you put it that way. “Shit.” Dean rubs his head in his hands. He’s so fucking bad at this.
“I—“ Cas looks down at himself. “I just thought, if we were leaving the room, it would be best to be clothed.”
In his room, the door safely closed behind them, Dean puts the bottle down on the dresser and turns to Cas, standing there in the doorway as if nothing is strange. Dean takes a breath. He steps forward. Releases the breath. Cas stays where he is, close. Dean flattens Cas’s lapels for him and
He watches as Cas’s shoulders rise and fall, a deep breath. “The people here,” Cas asks, “they know what you are?”
“And after that,” Cas says, “I got a similar lecture from Donna, who threatened to chop my genitals off with a meat cleaver and feed them to me.”
“Best suck-n’-stick I ever got,” he jokes, and they’re laughing into each other’s mouths, feeling stupid there on the floor. Cas covers Dean’s lips in a slow kiss and Dean can barely kiss back. Cas keeps kissing, kissing down Dean’s cheek before collapsing down on top of him, making Dean groan under his weight. “You heavy son of a bitch,” Dean complains at him. Cas just keeps panting against the floor, the shudders of what might be a laugh rolling through his chest. Dean smacks him lightly on the back for it. Cas kisses his ear. They both keep panting.
“I know you, Dean.” Even with Dean practically brushing him off, Cas is still smiling. He has a confidence Dean has never seen in him before. Dean reaches out and touches one of Cas’s smile lines, just to check. It feels real.
From beside Cas, Dean lets himself have a good look, eyes raking over the dark, curly hair on Cas’s pale chest, following that trail down his stomach and waist to his groin. He’s all too aware of Cas’s eyes watching him do it, making his back prickle, but doesn’t let himself look up. He makes his eyes linger on Cas’s cock, which is only mostly hard, but that’s what the next bit was for. Dean goes to the chair and sits, knees wide.
Switching to Dean a few days later: Dean is irritated that Cas has begun to avoid him and snaps or runs whenever they do see each other. Dean goes to his room to talk it out. He apologizes for pressuring Cas into doing something he wasn’t interested in doing, but Cas insists that’s not the problem. Cas apologizes for touching Dean nonconsensually, and Dean insists that’s not the problem, either. (The real problem eludes Dean.) He asks Cas what’s wrong, but Cas refuses to explain. Dean, after a moment, accepts this. As Dean makes to leave, Cas thanks him for the time they spent together, saying he appreciated it. Dean admits that he did, too.
“Yes, sir.” Why was he bothering to ask about a stolen horse when Dean was already guilty of worse? John would never have gone to the authorities.
So talk. Your client, the defendant, is The Multiverse As We Knew It Until Very Recently, represented by… This random guy.
“Ranchers must need hands. Gotta be at least two jobs in that damn town. And if they won’t give you room and board, we can get a loan from Sister Jo. She likes you. She’ll do it. I know for certain we can get at least a hundred dollars from her.” There’s a smile starting to tug at Cas’s lips, so Dean keeps going. “Can get a place where we all live all together. You keep Bal sober, and I’ll keep him entertained, huh? Can maybe convince the boss to get a piano for the house that he can use, or he could work in the hotel, playing. Hell, they’d have to let him play for tips, at least, right? And in our place, we can have a little room to ourselves. Don’t know ‘bout no silk sheets, but I reckon we can afford cotton.” And he’s succeeded in keeping that look on Cas’s face, like he hung the stars, but it’s a little sad now.
He groans. It’s even better this way— he can get Cas to reach that part of him even as he’s pulling out. It’s not what Dean would call
He holds both of Cas’s hands, framing his face with them, leaning down and kissing, kissing: his throat, his clavicle, the hollow in between
“You know. Tough. Rugged. Handsome, in a devil-may-care kind of way.” Dean tries to pose as he says it, but Cas ruins it with his sharp eyes on Dean’s ass, making Dean feel more than ever like a sissy.
And then his body follows, all of Dean turning onto his side, facing Cas, and suddenly it’s a whole new thing to contend with; legs in conflict with each other and cold feet, and Dean’s eyes, so much closer than is fair, especially before Cas has had his coffee, but there isn’t time to figure it out in the moment.
. And so Dean has had him, held Cas in his grasp for years, and surely even Dean Winchester would have said something by now, if he wanted more.
He was gone for this guy; far stupider than Donna had ever been. Stupider than pissing into the wind.
But instead Crowley hits a lever on his seat and falls back in it roughly until he’s almost laying flat, and then turns on his side, facing away from Cas. “You’re depraved,” he whines pitifully. “You need psychiatric assistance.” And then, mercy of mercies, he pretends to sleep for the rest of the tape.
Oh. Cas had known that, actually, not just from watching Dean in hotels, but from watching him with Lisa. “Apologies.” Cas scoots to the left, rolling onto his side as he does so. The mattress is very comfortable— firm, but giving, and quiet, compared to the groaning springs in Cas’s. Maybe that’s what Dean had meant by inviting him here, to share his superior mattress?
“You recognize this?” He pulls from his vest pocket the little pearl derringer with the crack on the handle. Dean could pick it out of a lineup of the exact same model. His chest hurts with how long it’s been seizing.
It doesn’t make sense. Cas remembers Dean calling him a brother, Dean saying he ‘doesn’t swing that way,’ but here he is now staring at Cas in a way he’s never been stared at before. Love, Cas thinks.
“I will.” Castiel breathes as he crawls on the bed. “Oh, I will. Oh, Dean—“ Dean lets Castiel remove his own brown, smelly old hat while he reaches to tilt back Castiel’s just far enough to kiss him. Castiel presses down on his lips, and Dean accepts him eagerly. He’s already reaching to touch Castiel’s skin. His chest is surprisingly wide and muscled for a relatively skinny guy; he has sturdy love handles and little tummy bump that makes Dean’s heart skitter in his chest. God, but he wouldn’t mind getting absolutely railed by this man. Hell, he should be the one paying, the way he’s lusting right now. “Pretty little whore,” Castiel mumbles over him. “Beautiful boy. Let me look at you.”
Cas wipes his flushed face, then blows his nose in the damn thing, which, fine, Dean’s dealt with grosser laundry in his life, but still. Dean watches as Cas empties mucus into the hanky, until Cas notices him watching and turns away. “Stop it,” he grumbles in that God-given voice.
“—Dean. I promise to listen to you, alright? You told me multiple times to be quiet, to get off of you, and I was the one who didn’t—“
Dean doesn’t need to be told by Cas that fucking someone feels good, but he doesn’t sass. He feels a bit like a limp fish, just lying here getting fucked. He tries to grind his hips, but finds it difficult to get leverage.
Some shots of the boys running through the trees; eventually they reach a clearing and stop, panting.
“Yes,” Dean allows, unable to refuse, aware that letting Cas touch him at all could lead to ruined plans. “Just a taste.”
Cas props himself up over Dean’s head. He brushes Dean’s hair back. “I’m jealous of everyone, Dean. Everyone who gets to see you when I don’t. No matter how old and cranky they are. No matter how they look at you. No matter if they touch you. I’m jealous of your johns, of Rufus, of Sister Jo and her girls, of Charlie, of everyone who walks into that house, the people who pass you on the street, all of them.”
As if something needed to be wrong. Dean leans against Baby and holds a hand out to Cas. Cas takes it and steps forward.
“I’ll just— go over here.” Dean goes to his bed and sits facing the wall, giving Cas a moment to slide naked under the covers.
Cas doesn’t. “You know you can’t hide from me forever,” Dean says finally, and a little affectionately, despite himself.
“Sure you’re getting your money’s worth outta me?” Dean jokes, guilty about lying there while Cas did all the work.
Story time: I almost galaxy brained on this one (at least it was galaxy brained at the time bc tumblr had not had this discussion yet). So Dean very nearly confessed in this chapter and I very nearly let him because the thing is. THE THING IS you can keep all the same narrative beats from canon while adding in a dean confession at ANY POINT after the empty deal because of course cas can’t return his feelings without getting taken by the Empty. Anyway I love the idea because it is such a ballsy play, but I went back and rewatched the confession scene ten times and eventually decided a Dean confession would kind of undercut the confession scene as-written. I also think that Cas would have been more than happy enough to accidentally summon the Empty if Dean confessed. Like fine it’s in just saying it but it’s also in Being Loved and Cas deserves to Be Loved. But I just wanted to ramble here because I think there are strong arguments to be made on both sides and I’m happy to hear them if y’all have anything to add. And how cool would that have been??? Imagine if in 15x20 the writers pulled out a Dean confession VIA FLASHBACK. Major Yuri on Ice shit. Top Tier secret gay agenda move. Imagine what we could have had. Fuck.
“You’re the one that bought it?” Dean’s still catching up. He had never heard anything about the origin of his momma’s derringer; it had simply always been there. It had been as good as a part of her. Holding the thing now, he realizes he’d missed it.
“Well, then, it’s high time you had one. Said your brother brought you here to relax in the first place, didn’t you?”
Dean shakes his head. “I left ‘cause I had to leave. Was just good luck you was there to go with. Made it nice.”
Cas is able to drop the character for a minute while Dean undoes his pants with shaking hands, pulls out his erection, and begins to suck on it. Cas rests a hand on Dean’s head but doesn’t push, just follows the motions, grounding himself in pleasure as Dean swallows him down then slides back up again, swirling against him with his tongue. Dean gives exceptional blowjobs, not that Cas has much frame of reference. But he knows he’s not supposed to let it end here, much as he’d like to. This was about Dean. So when Cas feels a moan building in him, he speaks.
hold up; for so long, he’d been angry, doing everything he’d done out of spite for one man. Now that man was gone, and Dean doesn’t know what’s left. “Fine, I guess,” he says. “Wish I could work.”
He becomes so relaxed that he doesn’t understand what happens next. Suddenly he groans, his own sonic frequency overpowering Dean’s and bringing him swiftly back to reality. He is so distracted by this new feeling of pleasure that it actually takes him a second to realize where it is coming from— Dean Winchester’s hand, rubbing firmly against his groin. And, oh. The feeling. It’s impossible. It’s too much. But somehow it
Dean just moans, utterly beyond humiliation, trying to loosen himself up quickly but not too quickly. It shouldn’t take too long. It’s been a slow few days, so he’s a little tight, but the whiskey helps. Fuck, he wants it. “Want you, darlin’. Want you in me.”
“Cas, you can’t—“ Dean starts, and Cas stops in the doorway. “With everything that's going on, you can't just go dark like that. We didn't know what happened to you. We were worried. That's not okay.”
“—No, Jack,” Dean cuts him off in alarm. “Don’t— Jesus Christ. Can’t a man— say what he needs to say.”
“Dean,” Cas groans, not warning anymore, just long and low and hard, then it’s quiet for a minute, just the sounds of their bodies coming together and their breaths escaping, before Cas’s voice returns, faster and higher and eager. “You like me fucking you?”
“Stay put, Cas, darlin’. We’ll just change out the water. Don’t much like the feeling of cold mud on my ass, is all.” Dean grabs the stopper out the drain and starts another kettle boiling.
Dean has to squint to see the individual feathers, the way they fit together and fall from Cas’s shoulders like a cloak, solid but also shifting. They’re both real and unreal, both light and shadow, diamond and air. Dean is starting to understand what Cas was warning him about—there’s an uncomfortable feeling in his stomach—but he isn’t afraid.
interested,” says Balthazar, still looking at the fucking cock photo. Cas slaps it onto the table picture-side down. The brothers share a look.
It’s only the first of March. Dean gathers his spare change together and walks to the telegraph office.
He can feel Cas’s eyes on him, just some dirty hunter in worn flannel and old jeans, and damn, after ‘Chastity’ in her white lingerie, he’d better make this good. He breaks away, checking in on Cas’s expression once more. There’s something different in Cas’s gaze this time; he still looks scared, a bit confused. But there’s something else as well, something Dean’s never seen there before: arousal.
Dean teases at his mouth with another finger and Cas slurps it up, too, enjoying this strange new thing they’re doing; he starts moving his head slowly around Dean’s fingers, sucking and licking at them, finding a rhythm in it.
It’s a hot day already, the little cemetery empty and dried up. The sky is clear and blue and the sun blazes down out of it, straight onto Dean’s bare head and into his eyes.
Crowley raises his eyebrows annoyingly. “Ohh. Name-calling. Well, you can relax. Fiendish as I may be, I’m not here to torture you.” Evidence to the contrary: Crowley didn’t
Dean leans down and picks up Cas’s hat. He dusts it off and holds it up. “You take care now,” says Dean hoarsely.
He remembers a dream, or maybe he dreams a memory. He’s sitting on a small dock on a lake that doesn’t exist. It’s a sunny day. The fish aren’t biting, but birds are chirping. All is peaceful. Cas is standing beside him, streaks of tears down his face.
“I’m fine.” Cas finishes shoving things in the bag and looks around blankly. But Dean can see there isn’t anything else left to pack.
Dean’s quiet at that. School for Sam had been a dream for the two of them for a long time, something Charlie had always wanted but never been able to have, and something Dean could never even imagine for himself. School for Sam meant money, real money, respectability, maybe even land outside of Campbell Ranch. School for Sam meant freedom from the yoke of John Winchester, maybe for all of them.
The three of them are more companionable, without Tagg and Miguel along. Cas and Balthazar both seem more comfortable, which results in Cas talking more and Bal talking… well, just as much as before. So despite having fewer companions the amount of talk actually increases. In fact, Cas becomes almost annoying. He’d bought all the newspapers he could find in Santa Fe, and as they ride insists on reading the articles to Dean and lecturing him on the background of each one, until Dean reckons he knows more about the news than the reporters do. Balthazar often butts in, and whether he agrees or disagrees with Cas’s assessment, it always leads to some sort of debate. They slip into Yiddish often, much more than they had around the fire with Tagg and Miguel, and Dean begins to understand it in a new way— as an actual language, not just a vehicle for expletives and frustrations.
Cas pushes Dean away, but Dean just laughs again. He’s so happy, it’s infectious. Cas can’t stay mad. “You’re one to talk,” Cas points out.
She’s frighteningly calm about it all. “Of course I’m not firing you, Dean. You’re not coming back.”
“Mm.” Cas kisses him proper, finally, and Dean opens to him desperately, running his tongue along Cas’s. He’s thrusting, too, now, up out of the mud and into Cas’s hand, rubbing between it and Cas’s hard cock. They start breathing too hard to kiss, but keep their mouths over each other. As they move, rain drips from Cas’s lips onto Dean’s, the droplets sometimes bridging the gap between them, making little paths of water like kisses themselves.
Dean groans and sits up, meets Cas’s eyes with wide green ones, framed by long, curling lashes. His mouth is open, his cheeks flushed. “Yes, baby?”
Dean’s hands pull Cas forward hard by the neck. His lips mash hot and hungry against Cas’s. Cas gasps into Dean, too surprised by the sudden onslaught of physicality to be anything other than helpless in Dean’s hands. He accepts Dean’s tongue, his lips, his teeth. Dean starts ripping at Cas’s tie and the rest of his clothing and Cas stands there powerless to even want to stop him.
“She did specify that I have to stay with you at all times and not to touch her girls or she’d ‘flay me alive with a rusty douche pump.’”
“I’m done with you,” Dean snaps, grabbing a couple of still-cold beers out of the grocery bag and heading out. “I’m done.”
“Okay, well, if Daddy comes out here and sees your ‘baby girl,’ we’re all in a mountain of shit.” The lantern light flickers on Sam’s face, harsh and disapproving. It’s the same face he’d made when he’d visited Dean at Bobby’s five and a half years ago and Dean had told him what had happened and where he was going next. Sammy had been only thirteen, but he’d managed to look grown up that day. Dean takes a step away from Baby and pats her shoulder.
“How many more times do you want to come tonight, baby? Should we try one more, three more? Or just keep going til you pass out?”
He thinks about Cas, when he needs to escape. He thinks about that tobacco grit voice praising him. He thinks about those dark eyes on him, looking over every inch of his body and transcribing what they saw to paper. He flexes his hands and thinks about the feeling of Cas’s hands rubbing life back into them, of Cas’s innocent face, not even realizing how sweet he was being. He pays attention to the calendar in Sister Jo’s office for the first time ever, keeps an eye on February 12. He tells himself he isn’t doing it.
“Me neither, babe. It’s okay.” Cas moves his head back in front of Dean’s, and Dean leans in for a kiss. Cas interrupts him.
“Don’t be.” The sentence is an order, given in Cas’s sex-voice, meant to scold Dean for his behavior. It’s not the sort of thing Dean minds at all, in fact he likes it when Cas gets a little pissy with him, but it makes it more than obvious that Cas has no idea what he’s doing to him right now.
It’s been a few hours since Billie left. Michael is still crashing against the walls in Dean’s head, each
bread had burned when Donna had gone out to rescue him. The kitchen still smells of it, even with the window open. Dean lets the baby squeeze his finger tight, its grip strong and needy and making him smile. He wonders if Cas likes babies.
“Well, it’s a load of crap, you know.” Dean whispers it as he picks up a photo of Jack and Cas at some milkshake place.
Bal shakes his head, the look in his eye dark and knowing. “You don’t get it at all. What Castiel should have done, when our father kicked him out, is move to an apartment in Brooklyn, get a job at a factory or a newspaper or somewhere, find a nice Jewish boy to fuck, and let me rot in my hole on Mott Street. He should not have pulled me out of there, and he certainly shouldn’t have listened to my drugged-up ramblings about freedom in the West. Because let me tell you something about my brother. Once he’s taken on a cause, he doesn’t give up. He’s stuck with me for life.”
Cas smiles. He finds some papers in his bag, sits back down, and writes the address out for him. They stare at each other for a moment, fingers touching as Cas hands Dean the paper. The sun’s up proper now. Dean was supposed to keep an eye out for that neighbor lady, but he’d gone and forgot. He slips the address into his pocket.
warmth and pleasure flowing through him from Dean’s touch and Cas can’t remember the rules anymore. He can’t remember who he is, or where he is, all he knows is Dean is the one causing this. “Dean,” he breathes aloud, needing to communicate
“Of course I am.” Dean watches Cas’s gaze as it wanders to his lips, his collarbone, then back up to his eyes. “We had an appointment.”
Chuck considers. He looks over to the stenographer’s typewriter. He can feel EMOTION and TRUTH rising within himself.
“‘M not,” Dean answers. Inviting Cas over was a mistake. He doesn’t want to move. He doesn’t want Cas to move.
“Back the hell off,” Dean snaps, coming between the beds and waving at her with his pants. “Gonna traumatize the poor boy, all y’all. Can’t you see he’s queer? And can’t y’all put your damn clothes back on?” He yells this last at Donna and Ruby, who are still disrobing. They glance at each other.
“And he fired Rufus,” Charlie says. “Rufus complained about you before he stormed off. Do you know what happened?”
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” says Dean, seemingly oblivious. He throws the shirt back on the floor and flops down beside Cas. “Yes, your highness?”
“The hell she is! What’re y’all looking at me like that for, then?” Dean’s heart is galloping painfully, like there’s something broken inside it, but not enough to let it stop. He knows the answer without them saying it, but he needs them to say it anyway.
A tingle on his neck lets him know Sister Jo is watching from the doorway. “You ever get a hankering for one of these things?” he asks her, and Benny looks up at her with a raised brow.
“But you didn’t do anything either, Cas. You didn’t—You’re allowed to stop, you know that, right? You don’t ever have to do what I—”
Dean covers his mouth. “Ain’t your fault. Ain’t mine, neither.” He’s almost surprised to say it; he’s not entirely sure he believes it, but he’d heard it from Sammy’s mouth, and given it two hours to bounce around in his brain, and was Jo really not even a little bit mad? Cas blaming himself would be too much to take on top of all that. “’S nobody’s fault but John’s.”
“—I know,” Cas cuts him off, turning around and untying Dean’s bandana for him before starting on his buttons. “I trust you. I do. It made me feel better, actually, when I realized. He kept trying to rile you, to get your attention. He was making a fool of himself just for your anger. Sad little man. I have your love, don’t I?”
“Thank you, sweetheart. You look half as good as you do after a bath. Which is to say plum gorgeous.” Cas smiles and looks away bashfully, and damn if he ain’t darling, with his nose red from the chill and his hair longer than before, starting to get a bit of chaos to it. “Nice curls,” Dean tells him, reaching a hand out to brush them.
Dean’s never been very good at the point right before a big change. He’s always kicked, screamed, fought for a way out of any situation that didn’t feel like a choice.
“You don’t get to decide everything,” Dean continues, pointing angrily at Cas. “You don’t get to decide how I feel, or what I want, or what the best thing is. Understand? We do that together.”
The sound that comes out of Dean is unearthly, helped along as Cas thrusts forward hard. His hips jerk back into Cas, try to grind against him before he pulls back out—He’s being so unfair. God, and it’s so slow. It’s infuriating.
Oversleeping hadn’t been an option in childhood; milk the cows, clean the barn, fetch the eggs. His momma had had him bustling at the crack of dawn. Later, he was the one who’d had the kids bustling instead.
“You are, Dean.” Cas leans down and kisses his exposed neck. His deep voice rumbles through both of their bodies. “Look at you. You are so good. My good boy.”
What would Cas have to say, looking in a pine box at the man he’d shot dead? John hadn’t believed in God, but Cas did. Would Cas say a prayer? Had Cas said a prayer, as he sat in the small hours of the morning, writing out his confession by the light of a lantern? Was there a prayer for that, for evil acts done with good intentions? Could Jewish people ask forgiveness? Did they need it? What did you pray for, for the dead, when you didn’t believe in hell?
“Hello, Dean.” He was real. God, that voice. Those eyes. And looking right at him, too. Dean was the luckiest whore in the world.
It becomes easy again, once Dean dims the light and gets Cas naked on the bed. This part, he knows he can handle. They’ve both been worked up for hours now, so there isn’t much for Dean to do, no particular pressure to get Cas off. “How do you want me, darlin’?” he whispers between kisses, but Cas just kisses him again, pressing him down into the mattress, hand trawling up Dean’s side, and Dean relaxes into it. Cas could take charge if he wanted to; Dean doesn’t mind. At least he doesn’t until they get going, thrusting together, Cas panting against him, precome making them slick against each other, need building in Dean until he lets out a groan. “You gonna fuck me, darlin’? Gonna fuck your boy?”
“And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight/ You’re a candle in the wii-hindow on a cold, dark winter's niiiight/ And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I miiiiiiiiiiiiight”
“My heart nearly flew out of my chest when I saw you in the bar. You’re stunning,” Cas tells him, and Dean doesn’t object. “And rugged. And I like the beard.”
Dean does indeed come back, only a few minutes that feel like eons later, quietly clicking the door shut, dropping his clothes in the hamper, and crawling into bed. He’s soft and cottony, and Cas lets him line up perfectly flush against his back.
him to talk. Dean shifts on his stool uncomfortably. “Some john,” he says dismissively, taking another drink.
Dean bobs around Cas, sucks gently, feels him hit the back of his mouth. He can hear Cas breathing roughly above him, and he times his movements to that metronome, slowly sucking gasps and moans from his angel until Cas speaks again, frustrated now, wheedling. “Deaaan.” Dean hums around him, which shuts him up; humming always made Cas groan. It’s too loud, in the open, but Dean doesn’t mind. It’s been so long since he’s heard that sound, since he’s heard Cas lose control and just
“Oh. Okay.” There’s a long silence during which neither of them moves. Dean’s normally rumbling voice is higher pitched, strained. “We can talk about—”
Cas raises an eyebrow at this, and Dean smiles knowingly back. They hitch the horse outside the house and Dean lets them in the back. They creep quietly past the bedroom and Sister Jo’s room into the kitchen, where Dean closes the door with a quiet thud behind them.
“—Don’t you say a goddamned thing about my momma. Don’t need you telling me a thing about her.” Dean had already learned more about Mary Winchester than he’d ever wanted to know. “What the hell are you still doing here, anyway? Did what you come to do. You can get the hell out.”
It doesn’t even make sense; they’re in Cas’s room, after all, but the word sounds to Cas like crystal struck in an empty concert hall, a clear note, something so beautiful, something he’s wanted to hear his whole life.
Cas mashes their mouths back together and the hat finally tumbles off his head. If there’s any sign of drunkenness in his behavior, it’s in this kiss, sloppy and wet and eager, his hand pulling too quickly now on Dean’s cock. Dean pulls his hand off and Cas starts groping his chest instead with his other hand. But Dean’s intention hadn’t been to slow Cas up; he pulls him down and rolls him onto his back, straddling him. Dean admires his wide eyes and open mouth for a second before kissing him again, letting Cas grope him a little more, then, impatient, Dean stretches over to reach the chest, finding his oil jar.
“It’s alright, Dean. You’re doing great. You’re amazing. God, Dean. Get yourself ready for me. Please, Dean.”
Dean’s dying in his pants, absolutely dying with thoughts of being tied up naked on silk sheets. It isn’t unusual for him to get hard while giving a blowjob, hell he hated not to be, but this is too much, in his tight pants, behind the tiger. Usually he takes his clients in a private room. Usually he takes his pants off. Usually he doesn’t get this hard, just from sucking. Just from listening. But Castiel keeps on talking, talking about keeping him, spoiling him with drinks and desserts, sucking him, kissing bruises into him, spreading his legs, working him open, and by the time he says, “I want to open you up before God and man and fuck into you, fuck my boy until you come from it, until you scream my name—” Dean accidentally gags himself he’s so out of it.
Bobby shifts forward on his barstool and Dean leans in automatically. He’d learned long ago to listen to Bobby Singer, though most folks in town didn’t think much of him. It had been Bobby who Dean had crawled to first, after John threw him out and before it had occurred to him to come to Jo.
Then Cas’s hand pulls away; his weight shifts on the mattress. He’s straddling Dean’s legs, and then his hands are pulling Dean up by the hips. Dean’s ass is in the air. He’s scrambling up onto his hands and knees. “Alright?” Cas is asking. As if he needed to ask.
Cas meets his eyes and stares for a moment. He lifts a hand and cups Dean’s face, skimming his thumb lightly over his bottom lip.
“For… the experiences. I don’t want you to think I didn’t find them enjoyable, or that I didn’t appreciate our time together. I did. I do.”
Mind the tags, also some chapter warnings i was unsure of how to tag (spoilers): that special brand of Dean Winchester self-harm where he isn't actively trying to harm himself except maybe he is who knows (not Dean), tw for being physically restrained/held down by a partner in a not-sexy way, tw for accidental harm to a partner and for Dean not knowing the difference between that and abuse. I. hm. Look, they still love each other and flirt and all that, really what happens is Dean has a very sudden panic attack and neither of them knows how to deal with it. It's alright in the end.
“You listen to me,” says Dean lowly, pointing a finger to Sam’s chest. “Sister Jo’s got space, and beds. There’s a whole room in the back of extra beds.”
“I, uh, may could have injured myself with the rodeo stuff,” Dean admits. “Can’t exactly compete no more.”
brought him before a jury, Dean doesn’t see how they ever would have convicted him. “Shouldn’t’a brung it up,” Dean says, because he shouldn’t have. What was there to say, anymore? It was all long over. “You still play piano?”
“My shirt.” Dean gestures to the floor by the bed, and Castiel picks it up, inspecting it appreciatively. He ties it gently around Dean’s wrists, asking questions as he goes.
Dean hits Cas affectionately. “See, it’s hard to pull, huh? My pocket ain’t gonna shoot nothing. These things’re built for pockets.”
Cas groans into Dean’s mouth. It feels good, so much better than when he touches himself. He leans forward, leans on Dean’s shoulders. Dean’s hand strokes him firmly.
as if there were no question in his mind that they were going to be this, whatever this was, for the rest of their lives.
He punches a tree, kicks it, starts bleeding just for something to do. Sam stands back behind him, panting, doesn’t try to help Dean. He’s busy thinking.
A promise. Cas smiles at Dean. He gets a hint of a smile back, shy and sweet, before Dean looks up at a tv screen above them, showing a sports game. “So, uh. So, how do you wanna do this, Cas?” Dean asks, beer nearly gone already.
“Yeah. I ain’t got no problem with it, if he is yours. So long as Mrs. Kline don’t got no problem with me.”
He does. Dean is full and pink and hard, and Cas touches him, marveling at him, at the softness of his skin contrasted with the hardness of his erection, at the groan he makes when Cas pulls on him.
“Aw, hell.” Sure, he hadn’t exactly been talking pretty, but Cas got mad when he talked too pretty. “Now what?”
Dean’s head is turning to mud, lying there in the hot blanket with Cas’ voice in his ear, his brain throbbing like it’s the thing that got crushed against the floor.
Dean beams back, so brightly that Cas suddenly understands the word. His hands drag up Cas’s sides and to his face; one of his fingers traces Cas’s lips, and Cas finds his mouth opening before he knows what he’s doing. Dean’s finger pushes into him and Cas closes around it, sucking it gently. It’s like his body knows exactly what to do.
Sam looks up to high heaven, like Dean’s the one being unreasonable. Charlie wraps an arm around Krissy’s shoulder. Sam finally trains his eyes back down. “This is our home, Dean. We ain’t moving into any whorehouse.”
“Sit,” says Cas, gesturing to the little chair, so Dean does, perching on it uncomfortably. Cas sits on the bed. It feels like miles away.
There’s something in Cas’s eyes as he looks back at him. Trust, maybe. Maybe something else. Wishful thinking. “I tend to make foolhardy decisions when inebriated.”
He hadn’t realized. He’d prayed without meaning to, which meant Cas hadn’t played him at all. His own thoughts had.
He pulls Cas’s hand from his mouth and pushes his chest with his other hand, striding forward until Cas hits the wall. He grabs Cas’s other hand and holds them both above Cas’s head.
“Oh. Right.” Castiel just stares down at him, stares down like he wants to be the one sucking Dean off. “I’ll be quiet.”
It’s Tagg’s turn. Dean looks at Cas on purpose now, lets the smile onto his face and pictures fucking him until he can’t speak.
Cas chuckles weakly and shakes his head. God. He looks so human like this. “You’re going to kill us both,” he says.
Dean laughs at him. Sweet thing. “You are just—“ he searches for the word— “stupid,” he settles, still smiling.
Dean’s hands are shaking. God, what’s wrong with him. He’s not the virgin here. He gets Cas’s shirt unbuttoned, and leans down to kiss his chest. It’s pale, with just a dusting of dark hair between the nipples. Dean brushes a hand through the hair, then kisses a nipple, pink and hard with cold, and above him there’s a ratchet in Cas’s breathing.
Every night he received things he’d only dreamed about before; Dean’s touch, Dean’s warmth, Dean’s breath. Dean’s trust was best of all, and the sense that Dean was sleeping better, too. Dean held him so tenderly, as if to protect him even in sleep, and maybe it was foolish, but how could Cas help but think of them a little like secret lovers?
When they’d started this, Dean had expected to have fun. He’d expected to have a man who’d treat him nice, who he could sneak around with and talk to and fuck without money coming between them. He hadn’t expected this weight, this feeling like there wasn’t any choice anymore, but in a good way, somehow. Not a trap, but a path, clear and open before him.
Dean feels naked without his hat on, but does as he’s asked, laying on his side while Castiel kneels beside him, passing rough hands gently over his body, examining every inch of him.
“Oh. Uh. Right.” Dean scratches his stomach. “You know, Cas. You’re a freaking angel. I’m not expecting any whips or chains or anything. Hell, I was blissed out on a handjob a second ago.”
After four weeks exactly, on February 12, the brothers finally come back through Sister Jo’s door again, hats dusted with cold raindrops and kicking mud off against the stoop.
“What I’m trying to say is, this— it don’t make sense. I know it don’t. Took me my whole life to figure it out. But I know it better than you. I need you to trust me.”

They spend the whole night like that, not much clothing, talking, listening to music, making out. Cas still won’t really touch Dean, but it presents a relatively small problem, as he’s comfortable enough with kissing, and Dean is handsy enough for the both of them. Dean knows he’s been in love for a long time now, and it feels at once like he’s always been in love and like he’s fallen precipitously all in one night. At one point Dean finally realizes he’s starving and they go to the kitchen and fry up some frozen burger patties. Cas asks questions, so Dean talks him through the process. While Dean eats they listen to songs from his mixtape, and Cas explains what he got from each, and Dean explains what each means to him personally. There are more I love you’s before the end of the night. Their world feels suddenly much smaller than it did before, but in a wonderful way. Dean holds Cas close to him and falls asleep, for the first time in a long time, not alone.
A small smile on Cas’s face breaks out into a big one, like the sun breaking through the clouds. Cas looks down shyly, then back up again. “I missed you,” he whispers.
“Then again,” Dean drawls suggestively, matching Castiel’s gaze, “sometimes cowboys like to bite me.” Dean licks then bites his own lip. “I like it, too. Might could let you, if you promise to be a gentleman.”
“I’ll tap you if you’re too deep, alright?” Dean wriggles his hand to prove he can tap Cas’s from this position.
Bal has a good if not great voice, and he prays in low beautiful Hebrew, which Dean adds to the list of languages he doesn’t understand. Dean sits there awkwardly throughout, unsure what to do with himself, unsure if a bunch of queers should be praying at all. After the second Friday’s Shabbat blessing, Dean asks Bal, much as he had Cas, once: “You believe in that stuff?”
It’s strange, how little Cas’s talking points matter. Sure, Dean is interested in them. Sure, he reads the letter over again and memorizes every fact. Sure, Dean is scandalized by Cas’s hatred of guns and love of cats and inability to tell cake from pie. Sure. But Cas could’ve just as easily told him he loved dogs and had no siblings and went to the shooting range every week. Nothing would change. They were just facts. They weren’t Cas. Dean was already sold on Cas. Dean wishes he could respond. He can’t. There’s only one week to go. He tucks the letter into his hat.
Dean slides himself onto Cas without waiting for instructions. Cas hisses beneath him, letting go of Dean’s cock and putting his hands on Dean’s hips instead. Dean works himself all the way down, taking Cas to the hilt, so fucking deep. “Fuck,” Dean whines happily.
“Oh, right,” says Dean, anger building. Cas pulls his arm away and Dean lets him go. “Sure. ‘My sincere condolences,’ and that’s it. Not even a fucking ‘good-bye.’ There ain’t nothing to say. Worst bullshit I ever heard in my life.”
“YES, Cas, I thought you knew all the important things by now. Where’s my phone?” Dean climbs over Cas, runs over to his discarded pants, scrounges for his phone, then leaps back onto the bed. He looks at Cas excitedly. Cas stares back, confused as to what is so thrilling about REO Speedwagon. Dean taps the screen, turns the volume up, and puts the phone down on the nightstand.
“You were glad,” says Cas slowly, “that he came to attack you, because otherwise he might have attacked little Jo?”
—moving it around him, pulling on him; he’s dying. Cas gasps from the pleasure of it, so much more than he could achieve on his own.
Technically no Dean, but his presence is felt I assure you. Besides, featured here you'll find: Cas and Crowley bitching at each other, bitter ex!Crowley, jealous!Cas, Cas’s view on the 11x23 no homo debacle, a certain someone's business card, and The Mixtape
anything. He’s totally overwhelmed, only capable now of want. Dean fondles him again, skin on skin this time and Cas has lost all capacity for thought or speech.
So much for that. Dean looks away and takes a swallow of beer. Cas had to go to bed soon. He had a kid to deal with, after all. Then Dean should stop drinking—though he’d have to slow down or order another so he could try to find a way to flirt with the bartender. Then he could bring him upstairs, stay up late fucking and sleep past the time even Cas’s lazy ass would get up in the morning, to be sure they’d miss each other leaving.
“Fuuuuuuuuck,” Cas groans and arches his back, his entire body releasing the dirty word like a sigh. Dean grins. Cas was usually pretty composed during sex; Dean’s never heard him curse so much before. “Am I dead yet?” Cas whispers as he relaxes back down.
Dean lets himself stare openly at Cas’s mouth. He lowers his voice and lets that syrup into it that he hardly used anymore. “Nice, to be able to take a warm bath.” After a practiced fraction of a second more of staring, he flicks his eyes back up to Cas’s.
Dean nods. He feels taut, but also liquid, like a rope caught in quicksand. “Well, congrats. You got one less to look after, now.”
Cas lifts two fingers, and Dean comes and sits on the bed, allowing Cas to touch his forehead. Cas’s grace flows through him, warm and good. Dean knows it won’t do anything, but he closes his eyes and pretends for a second that it will.
being thrown between him and John. It makes his back feel scratchy, makes him want to drink, or fight, or both. “Ain’t no God,” he says. The words fall heavier than they ought to in the dark room, lantern light flickering off the bath water. “Your daddy a church ever’ Sunday type?” Dean’s finished washing Cas now; he lifts himself into Cas’s lap, eager to lighten the mood.
“There I am,” Cas agrees, frowning at his face as if it were unfamiliar. It probably was. A month spent staring at longhorn asses and Dean probably wouldn’t recognize himself, either. Dean leans in and kisses Cas’s cheek, just to prove he can. He keeps the mirror up as he does, so Cas can watch him do it. There’s a smile flickering on Cas’s face when he pulls away.
