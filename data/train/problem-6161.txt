“Miss Potts will certainly notice if you begin attending all of your meetings,” JARVIS says drolly, and Tony shrugs.
“I didn’t see any fighting on the news.”
Carol’s face wipes clean. Her nostrils flare, hands reaching out, as though she can stop Tony from imploding before her eyes. ”What?”
“Tony?” she says, stepping away from the table. Tony glances at the rest of the SI employees, who are studiously not looking at him even as they whisper amongst themselves. Beth doesn’t even spare them a glance as she draws closer. “Are you alright?”
“What is with you two?” Spidey throws up his hands. “No one is talking about necromancy, or necrophilia, or whatever other terrible thing I am going to be accused of before this nightmare of a day is over. I just want you to scan for ghosts, or whatever it is you do.” He wriggles his fingers in the air meaningfully. “Scry for ghosts? Go dowsing for ghosts. Just do a check!”
“No, but, how did that even happen?” Tony asked, staring up at the screen. “That- that doesn’t make any
“Stop freaking out and watch the movie,” Tony murmurs in his ear, breath sweeping over Steve’s neck. He shudders, his reaction met with a low chuckle. “Later, okay?”
Rogers shook his head. He bit his lip, eyes flickering to Tony’s face then back to his arm. “Could you…?”
Steve frowns. “You think I’m depressed?”
Steve sucks in a sharp breath, his fingers tightening on the chair. “Jesus,” he breathes. He closes his eyes, trying to will away the image of a tiny Tony’s small hands fluttering over a deadly weapon. “Tony never talks about his childhood.”
If Tony’s responding laugh is a little wet, well, he knows JARVIS wouldn’t judge him for it. He closes his eyes and leans back in the arm chair, tips his head back and just breathes. For a few minutes, he luxuriates in the comfortable silence. It’s so warm in the bathroom, certainly JARVIS’ doing. The fight against the outrider army had been exhausting beyond belief. Tony just wants to sleep.
“You took a shower and you still smell like bonded sex pheromones,” Bruce deadpanned, and Steve flushed.
Tony gasps as Steve swallows him down again, straight to the root. The low moan that vibrates around his cock is enough to make him boneless, his whole body slumping forward. Steve slides one hand around, reaching up to press Tony back into the wall. His broad palm presses flat over Tony’s sternum, covering the mess of scars there, and Tony groans at the feeling, the sight of the tendons of Steve’s arm flexing to hold him in place even as his head bobs on Tony’s cock.
“You have ten seconds.”
Tony has watched Steve and Natasha fight before. It’s a terrifying, dangerous dance. Steve is strong and quick. He’s a natural at any sport. Once, Tony had taken him to the Central Park tennis courts, thinking he would have to go easy on him. Tony’s been playing tennis since he was a child, just as Natasha had been trained to kill from birth. One would think there would be no contest, against a man with barely any training, but Steve is engineered to move. He is engineered to perform at peak human perfection, to react on instinct, to know where to place his foot to stabilise his body. He knows exactly where to ricochet his shield to bounce off of six different men, in ways that defy a natural, human understanding of physics.
Steve makes a sound that Tony knows well: a low, winded sound of want. It’s surprising enough to make Tony open one eye.
The silence in the quinjet is deafening. Tony sits in the back, Bruce curled up at his feet in twitchy misery. He’s wrapped in a thick white blanket, and every so often he reaches a hand out and touches Tony’s shin, knuckles resting there a moment before he pulls away, anxious and unsure of his welcome. Tony puts a hand on Bruce’s head, just resting there as Bruce settles slowly. His body shifts into something a little less strung, a little more weary.
“You, too,” Tony whispered, and Steve smiled helplessly in response. A faint shiver of pleasure skittered over his skin at the praise, raising the hairs on the back of his neck. “I-…fuck, Steve.” He pressed a hand to the wall, frustrated. “I wish I could…”
Tony turned, jaw cracking uncomfortably as a yawn overtook him. He shook his head a little, wincing when the bar spun dangerously. “Sheriff.”
“You don’t look so good,” he says, and Tony chuckles.
He lowers Tony in gently. The water is cooler than he usually likes his baths, but it’s certainly not unpleasant. A sigh of relief escapes him as he settles, the faint itching that had been spreading over his skin disappearing almost immediately. He leans back with a decadent sigh, eyes closed, sinking down until the water is up to his neck.
“What,” Tony says, turning back to the switchboard. It’s mostly so he can stop mooning at Steve like a fucking tween. Embarrassment creeps hot up the back of his neck.
fucking son of a
Tony frowns, slightly stung, but Steve makes the cutest little noise of protestation at him. He comes over and tips Tony’s face up with wet fingertips, kissing him softly on the brow, over his eyes, the corner of his mouth.
“I wasn’t even sure you were real,” Tony laughs. Seeing him jocular for the first time since Steve’s death takes the sting out of the implication that maybe Steve wasn’t as welcome as he thought he was. Even still, it pulls at something in his chest. Makes him ache. “Don’t fret, dear.”
“Noted,” JARVIS says, amused, and Tony sticks his tongue out at the nearest security camera. “Your feedback is noted, Sir.”
Steve can feel his heart cracking in his chest. It’s a familiar pain by now. He closes his eyes, takes a breath. He lets it all out. “I’m still learning how to be a good friend to Tony,” he tells Hulk, smiling sheepishly up at him. “Bruce is, too. Isn’t that why they fought?”
“You know he’s jealous.”
"Shit. The courthouse didn't need whatever they took back, do they?"
Tony blinks, turning to Steve. “Right,” he says, brow furrowing when Steve won’t look at him. “You’re okay with that?”
“It’s always that kinda kiss, for me,” he says, firm, and Tony takes a deep, heavy breath. “I think…I think you’ve known that, for a long time.”
Tony keeps on walking, right up to the break in the glass partition where Steve had sat and painted weeks ago.
“Oh my god, shut the fuck up,” Clint growled, throwing another pillow at them. This one hit Tony straight in the face, and Steve let himself cackle, pushing Tony into the elevator before he and Clint could get into another pissing match.
“I’m all dressed and I haven’t eaten,” Tony said, but he was already backing up, back towards the elevator.
“Good night, Tony.”
"Oh my god," Tony says. He can't stop laughing. "I've made a mistake."
“And the metadata?” JARVIS prompts. Good old JARVIS.
“Tash,” Steve sighs, and Natasha’s eyes flicker to him.
“You asked what you were doing, not Mr. Laufeyson.”
"It would seem Mr. Laufeyson is a bit more corporeal now, sir. I silenced the intruder alert, unless he is unwelcome?"
“Talk to me,” Tony insisted, and Steve couldn’t resist that. Tony looked lost, and apologetic, and incredibly guilty when he hadn’t done anything wrong. It was Steve who’d fucked up, who’d done the unthinkable, who’d betrayed Tony’s trust. “No, baby, shh, don’t cry, I’m sorry-”
And Tony…has absolutely nothing to say to that.
“Well,” he said, but he didn’t really have a way to finish his statement, so he didn’t.
Tony glanced up from where he was closing up the forge, a small smile flickering over his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stop thinking about it,” Tony said, and his voice was raw, now. It was the closest he’d ever come to begging Steve for anything, and so he turned instead and kissed Tony full on the mouth, framing his face between Steve’s hands to hold him there.
,” he gasps, face flushed pink. “Oh, Lord Christ, Tony-”
Thor shakes his head, then turns to meet Tony’s eyes. His expression is weighted, and unbearably sad. “I wish I could say that my brother simply is seeking companionship after many years spent in isolation with his hatred, but in truth I do not know. I thought perhaps he might have said something to you, or you might have some knowledge of what he intends-”
“I love you,” he said, staring hard at the camera. “Nothing will change that, unless you tell me you don’t want me. I told you, remember? Don’t-” His voice broke, and he swiped a hand over his face, gathering himself. “I love you. Don’t forget.”
Tony nods and faces the sink, swiping a hand over the mirror to clear it. He stares at his face, then reaches for his toothbrush. “Just another day in this old bag of bones.”
“Hi, Tony,” he said.
Tony swallows, because he did promise that. He’d promised that like an idiot, before he’d known how important Bruce would become to him.
“Punching a teammate in an elevator isn’t really heroic either, and Cap’s the golden boy out of us.”
“Hard-line detective and femme fatale,” Tony counters, and Steve nods seriously.
Sorry about posting late! I came down with the worst flu and kinda forgot what day it was, let alone to post. But hey, check it out, we're done! I wrote some extra stuff this past week because it felt like I ended it too soon, so I'm really glad I decided to split the last piece into two.
There’s a short pause, and yet somehow interminable considering it’s JARVIS. “I think you should attempt to mend fences with Ms. Potts, and then ask for her interpretation. As Sir’s last serious partner and arguably his closest friend, I think her opinion might better suit you.”
“I’m going down to the Tank,” he said. “And honestly, I’m glad Bruce is still sleeping. I need to talk to Tony alone.”
Eventually, a familiar tug makes Steve’s breastbone ache something fierce. He closes his eyes, compresses himself down, and lets the data stream he’s been riding without knowing it all this time take him back to where he belongs.
Steve closed his eyes, tension rippling through his muscles at the thought of Tony being locked up behind glass, being able to see him but not touch him. He was shaking, fists clenched tight, and it felt like several minutes before he was able to grasp hold of himself again, rein his instincts in and realign his body and his mind.
“What the hell are we gonna do?” Rhodey demands, brow furrowed. He looks at Tony. “He’s right. One hit could kill you, Tones.”
Steve can’t help but laugh again at the idea of Tony attending mass. “Not at all, father.”
“How long?” he bit out, and there was a rough sigh on the other end.
Steve thought about it, and the idea was appealing in its own way. He got to have Tony intimately, without having to worry about either of them doing something they’d regret. Biteblockers didn’t have a key, and they could only be opened when the heat had passed. A bit of technology on the inside made it impossible to remove while an omega was still producing heat hormone, although it could be overridden by the company’s tech specialists in the event of an emergency. Most came with a special override that you could give to someone you trusted. They even came in different materials and colours. Part of him bristled at the idea, considering the old Victorian tradition of collaring omegas, but he knew that a lot of omegas liked them because it felt like a reclaiming. Another part of Steve flared hot at the idea of wearing a collar for Tony, kneeling for him, serving him, and
“You controlled the cameras of every room you were in while you had Extremis.”
“I thought you said Xavier cleared you,” he says. Steve takes a step towards him, but Tony holds his hands up in repulsor position, an obvious threat. Steve rolls back on his heels, looking like he’s been shot. “I…stay there.”
“I’m here,” Steve tells him, anyway. “You brought me home, just like you promised.”
“Thor’s fine,” Steve says, trying to soothe Tony’s manic babbling. He needs to deescalate this situation, now. “He’s barely even bleeding, and you know we heal-”
“So, no,” he said, and Steve winced.
“Touch-” Steve whines, his hips bucking. “Touch me. Touch me, please, Tony-”
Steve flinches bodily at the word. He presses trembling fingers to his mouth to stem all the things he wants to shout, his heart breaking in his chest, because it’s no use. This is his punishment for his cowardice. This is his punishment for not meeting Tony halfway. This is exactly what he deserves.
"So he's already halfway to affection."
“You know,” he said, “this isn’t…I mean. I really…” He stopped, pulled the cabinet door open. He fetched a mixing bowl and a whisk.
, and if that’s not true loyalty he really doesn’t know what is. “Wow. Just, uh. Let’s just get the Empire State Building done today, okay? Then we’ll only have the Bridge left. Grace’s team is gonna come in and paint tomorrow morning.”
. Did it stay? Can magical abilities pass on like that? And most importantly, did he really believe in all that mumbo jumbo shite?
Tony hadn’t expected anything different, really. But it was one thing to know, and another to watch it from behind the screen of the HUD, his repulsors up and waiting.
“Tony,” Steve gasps, and Tony smiles, rubbing his thumb slowly over the line of muscle that points down to Steve’s groin. “Touch me.”
“I could?” Steve repeats, bemused.
“What am I doing, J?”
“Okay,” Steve allows, “he can disagree. But Tony left because they got into a fight, right? So maybe he isn’t thinking so clearly right now.” He gestures vaguely towards Hulk. “If he was, you wouldn’t be here.”
Tony had nothing to say to that. Silently, he squeezed Rogers’ fingers and then turned, heading back out into the snow.
“Did he not tell you how he first fell from the bifrost?” Thor asks, expression cruelly triumphant, and Tony swallows his tongue. “You thought wrong, Tony Stark.”
“In that moment, some part of her came to me. I could see what she saw; eternity, stretching out before me and in every direction. I understood, finally.” He laughs, a melancholy sort of thing, then glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. He smiles at whatever he sees there, and Tony stays frozen as Loki looks away again, out over the city. “I had resented her, for some time, for not warning me of my fate. For allowing it to happen, or perhaps even encouraging it; it was she who granted me the throne, in Thor’s exile. But in that moment, I understood. It was like…” He pauses, eyes narrowing as he considers Tony, halfway to the armoire and held in place, lest he might break the spell of whatever this is. “It is like asking someone why they did not warn you of a crescendo in one of your metal songs.”
Tony’s startled into his own quiet puff of laughter. The sound of it makes Steve ache. “All of it,” he says, tilting his head up a little to grin at Steve from under the fringe of his hair. It’s such a lovely look on him that Steve can’t manage to breathe, and he doesn’t know what his face does, but whatever it is makes Tony turn back to his work, the smile falling from his face. He sighs. “He asked if I’d been pretending, with all the omega and beta women I’d been with. I said no.”
Loki looks down at the floor, grinning a bit. He looks up and meets Tony's eye from beneath his lashes. "We've been here before."
“Oh, God,” Tony gasps, arching under him, and Steve pants out a breathless laugh into the sensitive, mouth-wet shell of his ear. “
Loki looks nonplussed, and Bruce begins to laugh, quiet and shaking. Loki looks between them, a small crease between his brows. “What?”
“Hey,” Steve says, “I just wanted to say-”
“Steve,” Tony says patiently, and Steve sighs. He rolls his eyes heavenward.
Steve processes this for a long time. The concrete flies by under his feet as he moves, trees shaking gently in the cool spring breeze. JARVIS waits, used to Steve’s silence. He knows everything there is to know about all of them, Steve is sure, even more than they know each other. If Thor is meant to be some sort of god, he wonders, and not for the first time, what does that make JARVIS, who is constrained by fewer fetters in many ways? His eyes are everywhere and nowhere, held within no mind or skin. He’s never thought of JARVIS as limited. Over the years, it has become hard to think of him as anything less than a person. It was a journey, to be sure, but no one who interacted with JARVIS for any length of time could dispute that he had his own thoughts, his own desires, his own beliefs that existed outside of Tony’s. It was apparent every time they argued, in the way he so clearly cared for the team.
Steve lifts his head. He frowns at his own lifeless body, then nods once.
“Where are we going?” Steve asks, playing along, and Tony's wide smile turns into a wink.
Bruce is silent for a while. He digs his fingers into the muscle at the base of Tony’s skull, right above the atlas. “You hate it here, don’t you?”
Days pass, and Strange doesn’t call. Tony leaves two more messages at the Sanctum, increasing in their urgency, but there’s nothing else he can think to do but wait. Briefly, he considers going to someone else, but the fewer people that know about this the better. Also, the only powerful, active magic user he can find in NYC right now seems to be Nico Minoru of all people, which is just…not happening. Ever.
“Don’t care,” Steve gasps, barely verbal. “Want it.”
“Oh, stuff it,” he grumbles, throwing the towel at him. “I’m handling it.”
, he thinks, staring at the large, dark barrel Tash and Clint have slammed down on the team dining table,
His reflection doesn’t answer him. Tony snorts.
But we're not in the theater, and I am not letting you go outside this story, not really. Where we are is more like a pause between breaths. Whether you're inhaling or exhaling, there's a pause just before, like the pause you can feel more than hear before the tide reverses. Where we are is the point of intersection in the figure eight. Turned on its side the eight becomes the symbol of infinity.
“Wow,” Steve says, still laughing, “so much venom first thing in the morning, Stark.”
“Sir,” JARVIS cuts in, “shall I have Mr. Laufeyson removed?”
“Please,” Steve pleaded, but Tony ignored him, pulling out of Steve’s embrace to stand.
Let me repeat that: ALL EXPERIENCES ARE VALID. If someone does not think they’ve experienced trauma, and they don’t have PTSD or any sort of trauma response to an event I would consider traumatic, it doesn’t matter what I think about it, and vice versa. It matters what the survivor (or not, if they don’t feel that word applies to them) feels.
“Bruce, what’s wrong with him?”
“Little bit.”
“You’re not sorry you didn’t let me kill your best friend in front of you?” Tony asks, wry. “Colour me shocked, Steve.”
Tony sucks in a shaky breath. “It’s weird,” he admits. “Hey, you like art. Are you a fan of Hokusai, perchance?”
Steve frowns.
Steve's mouth, caught in the middle of whatever greeting he'd been about to offer, smooths into a surprised o. "I did, yeah."
, is the problem, which means it’s probably something like magic. They’re still waiting to hear back from Wong.
“What’d Steve do?”
He couldn’t stop himself from tensing, his knees closing a little with the force of it wracking through him. His fingers scrabbled at the pillows as he moaned, and Tony wasn’t stopping, just groaning in a low rumble that skittered all the way up to Steve’s hairline. He was pressing his tongue in, his thumbs flirting with the edges of Steve’s hole, rubbing against the sensitive skin as Tony worked him over. Steve was whining with oversensitivity, but Tony ignored his squirming, his crying, because he knew Steve. He knew Steve loved it when he got rough, when he made him take it, when it felt like his body was being pushed to the limits just to satisfy Tony’s desire. Tony pushed his tongue inside, deep as it could go, and Steve sobbed into the sheets, rocking his hips back into Tony’s mouth. He didn’t know if he wanted to get closer or away.
“No, sir. He is stuck in traffic.”
But of course he didn’t say that. How could he? He knew exactly the kind of pained disappointment that would flood Steve’s face, wreathed in dewy sweat that somehow made him gleam ethereal instead of looking oversexed and exhausted like any normal person. Steve had been right, when he’d first pressed Tony to a stairwell and kissed him until his brain stuttered to a screeching halt. He knew and loved Steve too well to hurt him.
He watched Tony for a few more moments, the shine of the armour in the setting sun, the graceful arc of each trajectory Tony took in the air. Eventually, he cut the connection and turned to step inside.
“Marry me,” he whispered against Tony’s knuckles. “Please. I’ve been thinking about it since you asked about the party, in October, and-”
“Please go,” Tony begs, hating himself a little for it. “We both know my self-control is absolute shit. You’re the military man, here.”
“Gonna be good to me, baby?” Tony babbles, because he couldn’t stop if he tried. “Gonna-
“I don’t think Cap is upset at Loki for the reasons you’re expecting,” Tash says, smirking at him, and Steve ducks his head. He can feel the thin skin of his ears pinkening.
"What?"
"Do you?" Steve asks. His face softens, turns pleading. It's a familiar expression, but it hurts less to look at it now. Tony feels the strangest sort of pride looking at him. He feels like something inside of him can finally just lay down and sleep. "I want you to know me. Will you let me try again?"
“No,” Tony mutters. A familiar bright blue dot is hurtling towards him on his HUD map. “Steve’s gonna notice.”
A memory rises, then, like a pale, bloated body floating to the surface of a lake: Clint, letting out a low whistle as they toured the newly-appointed Avengers’ Tower.
Steve turned, doing as he was told. He spread his legs wide, presenting for his alpha, and the sound that Tony released was so wrecked it barely sounded human.
. He’s picked Tony up, and is placing him in his bed as gently as Tony’s ever been handled in his life. “Tony? What’s wrong, talk to me, is it-”
“Remember to be patient with yourself and others,” the professor says, inclining his head in a slight nod. “Perhaps look into contributing to an exhibition. Volunteer to teach art at a shelter.”
There’s a long silence, wherein Tony watches Natasha watching Steve. Her face doesn’t tell him anything, and Tony doesn’t want to turn around. He doesn’t want to look at Steve right now, and he wants to watch Natasha’s face. Of all of them besides Clint, he’s the best at reading her. It’ll be his decision, whether or not to let her out. He knows it, and Steve knows it, too.
“That I do,” Tony agrees, wiping at his face. He strikes a pose, seductive and eye-batting and intentionally ridiculous. It spurs a mocking smile in Loki that he counts as a win. “How do I look?”
He turns and pins Steve with his gaze, penetrating and brightly intelligent. His mouth turns up at the corner. “Have you seen his face, when he gets bad news?” he asks, shaking his head. “I’ve been friends with Tony a long time. It’s never surprise. Before grief, before anything, it’s resignation. Sometimes I’ve thought that if I could have one wish, one stupid worthless wish, it would be to take that from him. That feeling I know he feels, that bad things happening to him are what is true and right and normal.”
"It's okay, J. Tell me if he pops up anywhere else."
“I wouldn’t know if you stayed,” Tony points out.
“I meant what I said, you know,” Tony says easily, walking around Steve to survey the damage. There are a few flecks of melted metal left on his skin, and Tony picks them off with his nails, ignoring Steve’s flinch and hiss of pain at the first, his stony silence after. The skin beneath is red and raw, but not nearly as burnt as it should be. He circles back to Steve’s front, ticking a list off on his fingers. “I got you home. You’re my friend. We can talk about whatever you wanna say later, but you’re not okay right now. You’re gonna be.” He grins, lopsided. “And if you still want me to tie you up later, we can do that, too.”
“Wow,” Tony says, because as much as his chest feels like it’s cleaving in two, he can see it. He can see it, and as always, he’s in awe of Natasha at her most dazzling.
“Well, the guest bedroom’s still where it was,” he says. “You know, one day maybe you could visit a guy when you’re not in dire straits?”
“Do you even know what you’re apologising for?” Tony asks, sounding genuinely curious. He spins around, face tight in the controlled mask that Steve hates more than any awful thing that’s ever come out of Tony’s mouth. His smile is about as real as Spam is meat. “Because, if I were apologising, which I’m not just yet, I know what I’d be sorry for and it definitely isn’t the bit where I pointed out the really rather obvious fact that physically speaking you’re Hitler’s wettest, blondest, bluest dream. Bad call, Cap.”
“He disappears and reappears everywhere, and he’s crazy as a bag of cats,” Tony argues cheerfully. “Definitely the Cheshire Cat.”
The priest huffs a sigh. “Recriminations do nothing but harm, my child. Forgive yourself your trespasses, as the Lord does. Give yourself permission to do what it is that you wish to do: love your soulmate.
“I want you to tie me up this time,” Steve says, and Tony’s breath stops in his throat. “Tie me down, and then use my mouth however you want.”
“I quake in fear, Sir.”
Steve smiles as Friday obliges him. He steps forward, tentatively, hands held out towards Tony.
“I can’t imagine where I might have learned my manners.”
“Bruce says I’m too far into the bond-sickness to take suppressants,” Steve muttered, and Natasha speared him with a glare. “I waited too long. If I take them now, it will throw my biochemistry all out of whack. It might damage the bond.”
“Senator, you can’t believe that registration wouldn’t be smacked down by the courts in a matter of
“Yes,” Natasha replies, and Steve lets out an explosive sigh.
Tony steals a bit of water so he can wipe the counter free of flour with a paper towel. Clint puts the dishes in the dishwasher, and the two of them stand awkwardly in the middle of the kitchen for a moment. Clint hooks a thumb at the dark flat screen.
I ever met a ghost?” He shrugs, waving his waffle. “Don’t think so? But hey, I’m sure somebody has. The soul stone exists. Have you asked Strange?”
Tony shakes his head. He reaches out and taps the same pattern Steve had onto the back of Peter’s hand.
“There’s something else,” Tony says, and Steve huffs a disbelieving laugh.
“Oh my fucking God.” Tony tightens his hand in Loki’s hair, whining as Loki rumbles laughter around him. He can feel the vibrations all the way to his hairline, and he whimpers a little when Loki pulls back.
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Steve says, like he can’t help but say it. It’s sweet. Predictable, but sweet. “I…can I ask, uh. I can’t imagine Howard reacted well.”
“Low blow, J,” Tony says, and Steve freezes. Or maybe he should turn back. “Steve, that you?”
Loki disappears, and Tony blinks at the dark living room beyond the kitchen island before shaking his head a little. "Right." He fills his coffee mug and sticks the apple in his mouth, then heads down to the workshop in the dark.
Steve takes a breath, considering. “I guess I just think that being a good person means caring about other people,” he says mulishly.
Steve frowns at him. “Tony-”
Twenty minutes in, Steve is up by three and overheating in his clothes. He peels his sweater off and tosses it onto the bench with Tony’s suit jacket, rolling his own sleeves up. Tony wipes the back of his hand over his mouth. Sweat beads at his temples, and Steve grins at him, spinning the ball on one finger.
“You’re filthy,” he mumbles, and Steve chuckles lowly.
“Not bad.”
Tony waves a hand and lets the door to the training room slide shut behind him.
Steve glanced around the table, taking in this strange group of enhanced humans and assassins and technologically-enhanced billionaires, and thought that maybe he could do this. He’d lost his old pack, but this new one held some promise.
“You can’t value one life over another like that-”
“She called,” Sam says, fingers laced across his chest. “She says to tell you you’re being an idiot, and to go home and put out your damn fire before it’s too late and the choice is taken from you.” He squints at Steve. “You wanna tell me what’s going on? Should I be worried about this?”
, Steve thinks.
“Would you want her to?”
“Coming,” Rhodey says, and Tony powers up and takes to the sky. “Hey!”
A slightly personal note about the content of Steve and Tony's reconciliatory conversation to follow. Feel free to ignore it if you so desire.
“I’ll be good,” Steve promises, and Christ, this man is going to be the death of him.
Tony grumbles, stretching his arms over his head in a stretch. “I always forget she can sleep with her eyes open.”
“Oh thank god.”
“I know…it’s.” He sucks in a slow breath. “I know I’m not…normal. Maybe it was…shitty, not to tell you-”
Loki laughs mirthlessly, a familiar desperation flickering over his face. It’s there and gone in an instant, but Tony remembers it from the darker days at the start of their acquaintance. It is not a good look on him, even without the gaudy horns. “I cannot.”
Tony licks his lips, eyes tracing the v of Steve’s hips. He slides down the bed a bit, then leans in, pressing open-mouthed kisses to the soft skin on the inside of Steve’s thighs. Steve shivers under him, moaning softly, and Tony smiles against his skin. He worries the tendon there with his teeth.
“Doombots,” Natasha says with a grimace, poking at the StarkPad with her smallest finger. “Can we call Richards and Storm in on this?”
“Nothing to figure out,” he huffs. “And it’s not Steve’s fault, so don’t start on him either.”
“I’m glad,” Natasha says, and Tony turns over his shoulder to glance at her. Her feet are planted flat on the floor, arms braced on the table as she looks him head-on. She tilts her head to the side in that familiar way of hers, like she’s looking right through him. “It was a job.”
“J, if you please?”
I will apologise for posting so late, but I’m sure many of you can sympathise. I will say this: no matter how long it takes me, I am committed to finishing this story because it’s become somewhat personal to me. It’s become important to try to save this contained, fictional universe from mutually assured destruction, even or especially because we might not be able to save the real one. So I can’t promise a steady update schedule, but I will promise that unless otherwise stated, this story is not and will not be orphaned. Please bear with me as I try to muddle through these difficult and real-life relevant issues with as much grace as I can manage. Thank you for all your comments over the past few months. They really helped me to keep going, and I appreciate them all dearly.
“No, Tony’s just smiling like a moony teen in a romcom. That was all me.”
“Does it hurt?” she’d asked him, the first time she saw it.
. I feel so full.”
“I like your cock,” Steve said amicably, pressing Tony into the wall and leaning down to mouth over his bondmark. The growl that Tony loosed in response to that comment made him shiver, goosebumps trailing delightfully all up his spine. “So let’s not waste time, hmm alpha?”
“That’s why I’m asking,” Steve says easily. “You’ll tell me what you think is best for Tony, right?”
“I…I can’t do it this way,” Steve says, and Tony blinks at him. “I need you to control it, this time. I can’t trust myself.”
“Dr. Banner is waiting to see if his presence is required,” JARVIS puts in.
“Good.”
. I know this is not what you were imagining lol but it was a comment that helped me get unstuck when I couldn't figure out what the hell to do with this fic. Even when I don't reply immediately to comments I read them in my email inbox and they really hep me a lot.
“Stop,” Bruce says, appalled, and Tony grins at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello?” he calls.
“We didn’t really,” Clint says with a shrug. Tony turns around to look at him, but he’s peeling his fourth apple with aplomb, seemingly unaware of Tony’s incredulity. “It was a chemistry thing, and then it was a holy shit we’re gonna die thing, and then it was a comfortable thing. When it ended, it was kind of easy. Expected, even. And then I got married to someone else for a little while.”
“Oh,” Tony gasps, and Steve can’t help it. He glances up to look at Tony’s face, and it feels like all of the blood in his body rushes to an organ that he doesn’t currently have any meaningful ability to use. There’s a fine sheen of sweat on Tony’s brow, limning him in the light. His mouth is open, tongue slipping out to touch the corner, and Steve has a sudden visceral memory of how it felt to kiss him, to taste the startled sound he’d made in that dark, cold room. Tony’s got one hand on his cock and his other-
A single tear trickles down Tony’s face. Steve brushes his thumb over Tony’s cheek to wipe it away, but he can’t. He can’t, and then he’s not touching Tony anymore. His hands can’t reach Tony’s skin. His forehead tingles where their skin met for two beautiful seconds, and Steve’s crying, too, now, because he was so close. He was so, so close.
“This isn’t over,” Peter says stubbornly, and Tony lets out a tired laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why are you defending cold blooded murder?” Tony demands. “You don’t even like using guns!”
He’s perfected hopping between the two places by now. If he closes his eyes and concentrates, he can find something that he can only describe as a trail of breadcrumbs. Little blips, like a slight tugging at the corner of his mind. If he follows it, he can feel himself get sucked in, compressed down, pulled like a string through the eye of a needle. He imagines it’s a little bit like what Hank or Jan feel like when they shrink.
Rogers was listing in and out, now. He’d slurred a bit while he was talking, clearly on the edge of exhaustion, and Tony poked around in the cupboards for some crackers, a wedge of hard cheese. He put them on the chair next to the bed alongside a good knife and a board, then set about tidying up. He stuffed the doors downstairs with newspaper, blowing out the lamps and locking up. When he glanced out the windows on the ground floor, he couldn’t even see his own workshop across the road.
“Great,” Tony says, shifting in place. He feels awkward, suddenly, unsure of himself in the face of a battle that’s bound to be bloody. “I had JARVIS put Dr. Cho on standby.” He glances at Loki. “Would you be able to open a return portal to Seoul instead, if J gives you the coordinates?”
“So you’re telling me Steve Rogers drove to
Tony snorted. “You don’t even wear a hat, Sheriff.” He tilted the glass towards Rogers, wincing when the liquid almost slopped out of the glass. “Care to find out?”
. Completely lose his temper in the helicarrier lab (part 1) which, in retrospect, was because Tony was flirting with Bruce and Steve couldn’t stand to look at them getting along when Tony couldn’t even meet his eye.
“The first one,” Tony said, sounding abashed about it, but Steve only smiled and kissed his chest gently again before taking his nipple in his mouth. “Ah.”
Pepper glances over at him, her mouth a droll slant across her face. “I don’t have to trust you for Tony to want you. Tony’s slept with plenty a tall blonde in our years of working and living and being together. So if Tony wants you, you just have to decide if you understand what it means to be with Tony.”
“Hell,” he says again. This is Hell. It must be: temptation, and punishment, and remorse.
“Of course.” She clears her throat as well, and Tony remembers this awkwardness. Neither of them were ever particularly good at emotions. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
Tony moves towards the doorway, but when Steve moves to the side to let Tony pass he catches the fat bruise behind his ear, dark pink and clearly mouth shaped. Steve’s head spins, and he steps back instinctively. He opens his mouth, then closes it again, but Tony hasn’t noticed. He’s walking to the elevator, still babbling.
Afterwards, when his body has been scanned by a million and six magic spells, and the curse has been identified, and Stephen has broken the enchantment, Tony has the grace to feel a little guilty. He scrubs a hand through his hair, then bumps Stephen’s shoulder gently with his.
“Hey,” Peter says, but there’s not much in the protest. Tony smiles at him, small and indulgent.
“Fuck, that was- this is why I didn’t want to see you,” he says, and Steve closes his eyes. The breath punches out of him. “No! No, listen, I meant, I’m not ready. I didn’t want to say something I’d regret, and I already regret that. That was a shitty fucking thing to say, Steve, I’m so sorry.”
He dithers in the bathroom doorway. He glances into the shower, then back towards the bed.
“Leave it to us, Captain.”
Steve doesn’t like that answer very much, but he can see the sense in it. If he was on the outside, he’d be outraged that Tony was being so trusting. He’d be worried for his safety. If anything he should be delighted that Tony’s showing a rare strain of self-preservation.
“So Jim doesn’t know?” Steve asked. That surprised him, at least a little bit.
“I will mute you, you malfunctioning, arriviste Neopet.”
“Is Zoltan gonna tell me my fortune?” Tony intones cheekily.
You can make this figure with your hips when you dance. Over and over you will return to that moment of balance before your weight shifts from one hip to the other. The balance of this story is about to shift. The scenery is changing, as we make our slow way across Mare Internum.
"Thanks, babe!" Tony calls out, reckless and high on adrenaline. He flinches violently at the feel of cool lips pressed to his cheek, inside the helmet,
, Steve thought,
“Why Captain Rogers, are you proposing to me?” Tony inquired, voice teasingly scandalised. “How very forward of you.”
“I’m not so sure they should.”
. He can feel Loki rest his forehead on Tony’s knee for a few desperate, panting moments while they both try to get their breath back. Then, Loki climbs back into his lap and pushes his tongue into Tony’s mouth, taking the kiss from him with a claiming force that leaves Tony weak to do anything but let him take what he wants. He tastes like Tony, salt and bitterness, but underneath he’s still cool pine and winter, and Tony grips his hips kind of helplessly and lets Loki do as he likes. Loki presses messy kisses to his jaw and his cheekbones, his eyelids and his brow. Slowly, he settles, until the kisses feel less desperate and more soothing, and Tony wraps his arms around Loki’s back and pulls him in to rest his head in the curve of Tony’s neck.
“You can’t use that against me,” he says, hoarse, and Tony sucks in a breath. “That’s not fair.”
“He works until 4 PM,” JARVIS said helpfully, and Steve nodded. He wiped his hands on a rag. “If I may, Captain, you have a streak of bright blue on your right cheek.”
“Did you plan this?” Tony asked, sounding equal parts dismayed and impressed, and Steve grinned at him. Tony seemed resigned to whatever Steve’s plan was, anxiety slowly being replaced with a quiet, fierce kind of joy. The sight of his crinkling crow’s feet made Steve step close, within touching distance. He wanted to kiss them.
“I love you,” Tony repeats dutifully, and the sob that tears its way out of Steve’s chest is a violent, squirming thing with too many teeth. It wrecks him bone-deep, inside and out. “
The squeeze is nearly unbearable, Steve hot and tight around him. He knows it must burn a bit, and he goes slow, revelling in the dazed, slack-jawed expression overtaking Steve’s face. His eyes are fluttering, half-shut, irises just a thin ring of dark blue around a wide black pupil. He looks wrecked and ravenous by turns, and when Tony’s fully seated he lets out a low moan, his thighs tightening around Tony’s hips.
“It does, doesn’t it?” Minoru says flatly, and Stein holds up his hands in surrender. Minoru ignores him, and turns back to Tony with a determined expression. “I
“Fine.” He clears his throat. “So, uh. What are we watching?”
Unconscious, stripped of all his barriers, he leans fully into Steve’s hand.
“Well,” Tony tries, “it’s not actually my plan this time, so I’m more reacting than doing.”
“Longer than you know, I think,” he says. “Tony, how long’s it been since Ultron, for you?”
“Tell me,” Tony says. He slides his free hand over Steve’s flank and around, drags his short nails up over his abs. The sound Steve makes is delicious.
Tony does as asked, then dips a pinkie into the dark, viscous liquid and slips it into his mouth. “Mmmm, cinnamon?”
Steve drops the shield and raises his hands, eyes darting to Tony. They’re so blue, damp and frightened, and Tony spares him a grin because he knows that’s not for the guns pointed at his rippling pectorals. He can taste blood, and he watches with vicious satisfaction as all the colour drains from Steve’s face. He must make quite the sight.
“Should I offer to let you fuck me on the hood of my car?” Tony jokes, but the way Steve’s eyes darken is in no way jocular. “Oh. You…totally would love that, wow. Holy shit. Which car? No, don’t answer that right now, I have to go back into the garage and the mental images, wow, no. You’re a filthy fuck, this is
“You like the idea of me being smooth under your tongue? Completely bare, extra-sensitive-”
Walking around in the future is like being a horse with blinders on. He is only able to get the faintest top-notes from most people’s scents, and he suspects that’s only because of the serum. Everyone wears blockers now, not just people close to their heat or rut. It’s like one of his senses had been completely excised from him as he slept. He has no idea what anyone wants from him. Steve is no good with words, unless he’s giving a speech. He’s floundering blind in a new world with no anchor, no pack, and a soulmate that can only barely stand to be in a room with him without shying away like a skittish horse.
“I’m such a fathead,” he groans into his bedspread.
The elevator’s ding is an absolution that Steve embraces with open arms. He steps out and unlocks the door to his quarters with exhaustion hanging heavy in his frame. He wants to lie down and nap, but he knows that’s not a good impulse. It’ll just make him too keyed up to sleep later, set him sparring with Tony’s specially reinforced punching bags down in the gym at 3 AM.
think we were fighting?”
Loki tilts his head to the side, easy. “He is a Hydra scientist, not a fighter. It is his creations and his men you must be wary of. His forces are weak now, but he has a few soldiers at his disposal. And he is no genius; nothing like Stark.” He flashes a bright grin at Tony, blindsiding him with the compliment. “His power, much like Victor in this particular instance, is mostly in number and the occasional surprise. Victor has not left Latveria, but his machines are there, as you know.”
“You are a menace, Steven,” Tony tells him. Then, belying his words, he leans in and kisses one corner of Steve’s unrepentant grin. “I love you more than all of the tentacles in the multiverse.”
"What?" Steve gapes. "When did I say that?"
“Yeah,” Tony says again, snapping the next section of windows apart one by one. “Oh.”
“Thor thinks you’re lonely,” he says conversationally, “but also that you have some big plot in the works. He didn’t seem too concerned about it, though, so good job on that one.” He pulls a cotton Henley off a hanger with his free hand, the other still tousling his hair with the towel. He also grabs a pair of blue jeans.
“Well?” Tony prompted. “Are you gonna ask me? Is there a ring?”
“I don’t have a choice, do I?” he asks, colouring his voice with dry amusement because that’s what he needs to do right now; he needs to make a laughing spectacle of himself. He needs to be amused and amusing and steady.
Tony stares for a moment, uncomprehending. “What?”
“I’m an asshole,” he says. He tips his head to the side, heavy-eyed, to look at Steve’s hologram. His jaw is tight, and he’s not looking at the camera. “Cap.”
Tony glares back at him. “This is how you wanna cash in?”
“I-…” Steve sucks in a breath, then his face twists. His scent is all over the place: despair, longing, confusion-
“No? I’m not sure I understand you,” he admits.
Steve shifts a little as the lights go down and the movie starts, willing his body to come down off of its high. He can feel Tony staring at him, even as the MGM lion roars out from the screen. He squeezes Tony’s hip again, gently this time, and is rewarded with Tony nestling deeper into Steve’s body. Steve wraps an arm around his shoulders, because it seems stupid not to, now.
Franklin frowns. “I’m not supposed to be outta bed,” he says, rocking back on his little socked feet. God but he’s precious. Steve’s probably smiling at him like a damned giddy loon. “I’ll get in trouble.”
Xavier lets out a loud bark of laughter, perhaps the least refined Steve’s ever seen the man. His eyes are a bright, sparkling brown, and once again Steve is reminded strangely of Tony. “I’ll take that as a compliment,” the professor says, and Steve chuckles a little. “I cannot tell you, Captain. As long as we feel you need the appointments, one might say.”
, a slick, sweet voice tells him: mocking, judgement.
“Need me to carry you to the bathroom?”
Steve stays silent.
Bruce laughs. “I thought you got really into traditional medicine when you were dealing with the palladium problem.”
Tony rubs at his eyes tiredly, still flinching against the mid-morning light. “One day I’m gonna donate you all to Brooklyn Tech,” he mutters. JARVIS, predictably, ignores this. “I guess I better shower, huh?”
for us.”
“Oh my god,” he mouths, more breath than voice. “Oh my god, I thought I was going crazy.”
“Eww,” Clint groaned, and Tony leaned back until he fell against the back of the couch, laughing breathlessly.
“Sorry, had a neuroscientist friend in college who was writing a thesis on octopodes—big at the time, they’re so smart and we didn’t have the slightest clue about them—and used to go off on this rant. He had thirteen of ‘em shipped in under the supervision of…” He trails off, glancing up at Steve. He’s babbling again. “Uh. Doesn’t matter.”
Steve swallows. His eyes feet hot and swollen with unshed tears. He’s never heard the scripture like this; plain and easy, coming into him like a song. It’s beautiful.
“You try to set yourself up as something good for the people you love. Come to Stark Tower—it’ll be great! State of the art labs, it’s like Candyland, you’ll love it.” Bruce puts on a terrible fake smile as he impersonates Tony’s sales pitch, so plastic Tony’s almost offended. “It’s an incredibly alpha way of relating to people, which is probably part of why Steve decided to pay Obeisance to you. But Steve’s an alpha, too; he wants to give you things, and you don’t let him. This whole time he’s been fumbling around in the dark, trying to figure out how to make you happy. And he doesn’t know how to be taken care of, and he doesn’t want anything material from you, so you’re also fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out how to make
“Air Force, sir,” he says, “Senior Airman.”
And well, Tony doesn’t have anything to say to that, so he keeps his mouth shut. He sits down at the table, taking the bowl Thor presses into his hands and watching him settle back at the end of the table across from Tony.
“I feel I should point out that, as you are my creator, this might qualify as a situation that warrants a report to CPS.”
“Oh,” Tony says. He lets out a shaky breath, and Steve wraps his hand around Tony’s ankle. They’re incongruously delicate, Tony’s ankles. Slender and fine boned. He rubs a careful thumb over the jutting bone where he’d left his message.
“Can we get married?”
“Steve,” he breathes, and
Steve takes a swift, shaky breath. He makes himself keep his hand where it is. “I figured as much,” he says, even as he can make it.
Amora smiles sweetly, her red mouth curving into a sickle blade. “I bet you did,” she says, and Tony hisses as he’s hit hard from behind, tumbling him head over heels into the dirt behind the cadre. The impact shakes him to his bones, and he barely drags himself up onto one knee before another shot hits him between the shoulders.
After, Pepper gathers up all her things and folds Tony into her arms like he is something small and precious. She presses a gentle kiss to his forehead.
"I'm not really here."
“Wow, my reputation proceeds me to other planets,” Tony says, delighted. He tugs on Loki’s shirt, stripping it off him and dropping it on the floor. Then he slides his mouth down the hollow lines of his neck, nipping at one collarbone, dragging over Loki’s chest to suck a nipple into his mouth. Loki hisses, twists his body into it, then curls his fingers in Tony’s hair. Tony bites, and Loki groans.
Tony smiles down at him, helplessly fond. “And how are you going to do that?”
What is this going to accomplish, anyway? Does he want Rogers’ apology in person? Does he want to talk it out?
“I called Sam Wilson,” Natasha says, not looking up from her soup. “We need help.”
Loki laughs, pressing two fingers into Tony’s mouth and sliding them against his tongue. “I am getting exactly what I want,” he says, fucking Tony’s mouth with his fingers. Tony sucks, working his tongue against them, tasting salt and that ever-present coolness that seems to lurk under Loki’s skin. He thinks about what Thor has said of Loki’s heritage and the Jotun, and wonders what it would be like to be fucked by cold ice. He’s done stranger things than temperature play. He’s sure he could handle it.
“I- what?” Rogers touches his face, then frowns down at Tony, then Bruce. “Is he brain damaged? I thought you said the scans were fine!”
Steve comes first, his hips stuttering against Tony’s. He ducks his head to Tony’s shoulder, teeth clamping down on the muscle there in a way that’s sure to leave a lovely ring bruise in the morning. That, his twitching cock inside Tony’s body, and his hand tightening on Tony’s is enough to send him over the edge not long after, his body jack-knifing in pleasure with Steve still hard inside of him.  It’s the kind of orgasm that whites out his vision in a good way, sound dimming around him as the blood roars in his ears, his body shimmering all the way down to his toes.
**spoilery elaboration: consider Charles’ whole “Hey use your holocaust pain to fuel your powers! That’s not directly against primum non nocere or anything” song and dance. An amazing telepath? Sure. Does he get results? Definitely. Is what he does at all what the American Psychological Association would call ethical? Lol. That in mind, take these therapy sessions with a grain of salt. Xavier’s a genius, but also kind of an asshole sometimes. Steve does kinda need a kick in the pants, tho. Guess we’ll see how this works out for him?
"Thank you," Loki says, smug bastard. He sounds like he's standing right behind him, even though Tony's forty feet in the air. Tony takes down a Hydra agent aiming for Cap, then blows up their evac vehicle. Then he takes down the five men fleeing the burning truck, just because.
Anyway, I hope y’all enjoyed my foray into this weird AU. That’s all, folks! Until next time ~ ~ ~
“If you might direct your attention to the television, I think we are finally seeing the results of Mr. Laufeyson’s promise to you.”
“Okay,” Tony murmurs. He leans in and rests his face in the soft curve of Steve’s neck. His stomach grumbles loudly, and Steve laughs.
“Let’s try this again,” he says evenly. The smile he offers Loki is conspiratorial. Fond. “Come on. If you’re anything like me and Thor, you’ll need to eat after all that excitement. We’ll get you both cleaned up, and we'll see what Clint and Bruce have made for dinner, and we can chat about Bucky. Alright?”
Tony shakes his head, and Rhodey lets out a low curse.
“But moooooom,” Tony whines theatrically, and Steve rolls his eyes.
“But…” Tony sighs. “It would probably be a big help if I didn’t have to worry about him poisoning the well.”
“Bruce says he’s in love with me. JARVIS says he’s no good for me. Pepper was ready to call SVU on him, and Cap says I’m hard to love.” His voice is affectedly casual, and Clint folds his arms and regards him with a squinted eye. He looks uncomfortable, and Tony grins wickedly. “Ask, and ye shall receive.”
“Anything you want,” Steve says, and Tony smiles a little at the sense memory of being tied, of babbling the same thing for Steve. “Tony, I- God, if I hurt you-”
her. Why did I think I could do this?”
Tony’s mouth cracks open in a smile, despite everything. He can’t help himself. “Ah.”
“So. I, uh. I have a confession to make.”
“You’re out,” Peter says stubbornly, but Tony shakes his head.
He’s sitting on his balcony in a plush robe and little else. Wine red. His father’s, once, which he’d stolen just to piss Howard off. But it's comfortable, and worn, and still smells a little like the cigars Howard used to share with Obie. It's probably fucked up to take comfort in that but Tony's drunk and heartbroken, so who's gonna judge him? It doesn't really smell like that, probably, anyway. His father's been dead for 21 years. That's probably all in Tony’s head. A lot of things are just in Tony’s head.
“I'm afraid, Sir,” JARVIS deadpans, and Tony jams his finger into the elevator button hard enough to hurt. “Would you like me to read you the list of U.N. committee members for the accords?”
“As you know, the Democratic Party does not endorse registration,” Durbin says, leaning back in his chair. “Neither do we endorse lethal force being applied to American citizens, regardless of the power they possess. I believe in due process, as per the constitution. If the Avengers can’t abide by the laws of this country, they should answer to the courts like any other citizen.”
“Natasha,” he said, looking up to catch Tony’s speculative expression. “I could handle Natasha, I think.”
Loki hums, entirely unrepentant, and untwists his body from the comma curl he’d been held in. He arches into an exclamation point, textbook open over his chest. Long toes dig into the carpet. The fine blue linen of his shirt slips over his abdomen, revealing a dark trail of hair, sharp hipbones. His neck is one pale, bowed line of mouth-watering temptation.
A small smile quirks his lips. It’s a nasty one, the one that promises bloodshed. It’s a smile Steve’s seen many a time, and it instantly relaxes him. Whatever is happening here, it was planned. Tony planned for this. He feels immediately safer.
Bruce flaps his uninjured hand in a clear dismissal. “So, what awful thing is happening today?”
“I love you,” Tony breathes, fingers digging into Steve’s thighs as hard as he’s able. He can do that, with Steve. He can have anything. “I love you, and you’re mine, too. I’m yours, and you’re mine.”
His tone was dismissive, but it was his eyes that always got to Steve. The real reason that Tony wore sunglasses everywhere was that his eyes were so damn expressive, the last bit of humanity that Howard Stark’s PR professionals hadn’t been able to train out of him. When he was excited and curious they glittered beautifully, deep as polished agate. This, however, Steve wished he saw less often; the quiet, frantic fear of rejection, a bracing for pain that shuttered his eyes, lashes a sooty curtain that made them look almost black. It was a shade of Tony’s expression that he associated strongly with pleasure, and to see it twisted into fear curled a special kind of fury deep in his gut. Sometimes, the part of Steve that had fought what had felt like every bully in New York wished so badly to go back and find Tony’s torturers, to beat them until his knuckles split on their teeth. He wouldn’t, now. He was Captain America, after all. But he wanted to. My god, he wanted to.
“This way everyone will know where you are,” he’d explained to Steve.
“I can’t imagine Sheriff Rogers had any dearth of offers to spend his Christmas at a warm fire with a grateful citizen of Timely,” Tony mused, letting Rogers bully him down the street. “Gonna toss me in a cell for public disturbance and go on up to the Parkers’ homestead for supper?”
“If you wanna play it that way,” Tony drawls, “you can’t possibly think you’ll win.”
“Of course. Shall I make the usual arrangements?”
~~off to sleep for a bazillion years~~
“I know that,” Peter says patiently. “That’s why I’m coming with you. To the Sanctorum!”
“So you’re just going to live with someone who…forced himself upon you?”
“Can you blame him?” Xavier asks, mouth curving into a slow sickle. It could almost be called kind, if it wasn’t so sharp. “It was by all accounts unpleasant, and you were a friend of his father’s. What’s more, much of the information is available to the public. I’m certain you’ve mastered Google by now, Captain.” He shakes his head. “Alas, we have digressed. Your homework is this: find something with which to begin a civilian life.”
“Yeah.”
Jim snorts again and sits back down on the couch. He offers Steve a beer, then shrugs and leans back when he doesn’t take it. He takes a big swig of his own drink. “Do you know what the most astonishing thing about Tony Stark is?”
“Maybe just a kiss,” he said. “For motivation.”
“What?” Clint says, scowling, and Tony rubs his hand over his face.
“Oh my god, shut up and let me sleep.” A pause. “And activate the shades for me.”
Heyyyy, here's where things get a little steamy. You know what that means! Specific spoilery warnings. Skip if you don't need, stay safe if you do.
“After what happened with Hydra, Captain Rogers has made his position on answering to SHIELD again very clear.” Coulson says tiredly. He glances at Tony, face placid, and Tony reads the unspoken question there; why wasn’t Steve with him? Tony stares back. “Not unfairly, I suppose, but that’s off the table.”
“You could have the team take a vote,” Xavier says, a mischievous smile breaking over his face.
Tony smiles, pleased at his own deductive reasoning. "Same one? St. Joseph's right? Wasn't that your dad's name? Was he named after the saint? No, wait, sorry. Backtrack. I mean, how was it?"
“You- I love you,” Tony babbled, and Steve moaned, his whole body shuddering at the words. “Fuck, I love you, you’re so fucking good to me, you’re the most incredible, gorgeous, filthy omega any alpha could want-”
“Jesus.”
Steve walks up to him, ignoring the hard lines of Tony's face. He takes Tony's dripping fingers in his. "You're a good man, Tony Stark."
“J, can we get some lighting in here?”
“That’s the only good news we’ve got,” Rhodey says grimly. “He’s dead.”
“You thought he might kiss you.”
“They find him,” Bruce said, shrugging. He flipped back to the paper trail he was following. “They find us, really. The broken ones, the weird ones, the ones that get left behind, or beaten up, or bullied. They see themselves in Tony. Sometimes me, but mostly Tony.” Bruce laughed, a self-deprecating kind of thing, but there was fondness there, too. “He’s…human, in a way the rest of us aren’t. He’s fucked up in public since he was a kid. They’ve seen him awkward, and pissed, and throwing up in strangers’ bushes. Kids get him, in a way they don’t get a flawlessly gorgeous Russian super-spy, or a nerd who turns into a 1400lb green monster. Tony’s real.”
“Not afraid,” Steve said, and that at least wasn’t a lie. “It’s just what I know, and how to prepare for all eventualities, just like we always do. If you all do as I ask, there’s nothing for me to be afraid of. Except maybe for if Tony’s gonna blow himself up trying to get out of this mess.”
“Of course, sir.”
Nat resettles herself in her chair: an easy, graceful motion. “I will tell you, if you require it to let me go free. But Steve would need to leave.”
Tony stares hard at her, trying to see the trick. He taps a finger against his thigh, then points a disbelieving finger at her. “Is this…an apology?”
It had been four days, and there was absolutely no sign of Tony.
Christmas was a cruel holiday for most anyone in Timely. There was hardly ever enough happiness, ease, or family to go around. Money, too, was hard to come by for some, though things had been better on that front after the gold and Casino and the rail. Predictably, with the money had come bad men, and corruption, and desperation; all bad for the Christmas spirit. If anyone would know about that, it would be a Stark.
“Next time,” Tony says, shakily. He’s tempted. He’s definitely, 100% tempted. “Not right now. Please.”
Steve studies him. He glances meaningfully at the cluttered worktop, and Tony obligingly shoves some stuff over to make room for the tray. Steve puts it down and goes to fetch another stool, and Tony looks down at the spread. Warm thick-cut bread, stew, a pepper grinder, a few paper-thin slices of cheese. It’s…sweet, which Tony is learning is very much who Steve tries to be. When he isn’t putting his foot in his mouth, at least. He reaches out and gently brushes his fingers along one of the two napkins. He doesn’t even know where Steve found these in the tower.
“I want you to scream,” Loki says in a low voice, slipping one finger inside him. Tony bears down a little at the stretch, breathes deep. “I want to take you apart.”
“Bless you, J,” Tony whispers gratefully. Then he lets JARVIS lever him to standing, the motions slightly less graceful than they might be if he was piloting the suit himself. “Fuck.”
“If it makes you feel any better,” JARVIS begins, tentative,  “this situation has generated a positive impact in our predictive models for the outcome of the first UN accords committee meeting. It has proven that this is a dangerous group that required enhanced action, sanctioned or not. The international community will see how poorly the NIA fared when attempting to handle this situation in-house and take note.”
Tony blinked up at the neatly-kept porch in front of them, bemused. “We’re here.”
I’ve got most of the next section written already because it was originally gonna be part of this chapter before I realised that a single 20+k chapter was absolutely bonkers, so it shouldn’t be too long between updates. Thanks as always for your patience and comments, y’all! Getting feedback/being able to chat with y’all is so much of what makes writing this fic worthwhile to me, so please drop me a line. I’m always happy to talk meta. <3 <3 <3 Thanks especially to my little crew of hardcore dedicated readers, who have been my cheer squad through the rough bits. You know who you are.
Lately, Steve often finds himself wondering whether he should be touching Tony at all. Some days, every caress makes Tony freeze, caught somewhere between guilty pleasure and terrified exhaustion. No matter how much he sleeps, he doesn’t look rested.
Tony squinted, but there was no answer that he could hear. Still, Flower’s ears flickered vaguely to the left, and Tony tilted his head down to look at the horse.
“Better someone who heals you instead of hurts you,” Steve explains, voice patient and calm in equal measure. Tony can’t quite believe this is happening. “Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve blinked, tilting his head up to look at Tony, and his face was all joy and brightness. “Marry me, Anthony Edward Stark,” he said, and his voice was firm, loud, filled with laughter. “Marry me, and make me impossibly happier than you already do.”
“You mean me.”
“Great,” Tony says, rolling his eyes. He’s manfully refraining from the easy pun. He hopes that someone’s proud of him for his restraint. And then, because he can’t resist: “Hey… are you Irish?”
“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that,” Steve had said, and hung up.
Tony’s breath is coming in deep heaves. His eyes are wild in his face, darting over Steve’s face, his body. Steve lifts a hand to his mouth, but when he touches the skin there, he feels barely anything against his fingertips.
But Thor is already moving, sitting down firmly on the couch against the wall. “As you know, I am kept apprised of what happens on Midgard while I am away, lest I am needed.” He fixes Tony with a wry look. “Heimdall sees all, and although I had renounced the throne, I am still a prince of Asgard. He must answer my questions as I pose them.”
“Where’s Tony?” he asks.
“I don’t think Amora getting upset at you for killing Loki is unreasonable,” Pepper points out dryly. Tony circles the arc reactor absently with his fingers, conceding the point. “I think…he misses her, actually.”
“Oh,” he says, stiffening. “Is this…do you not, um.” He stops, pulling back further, until Tony begins to slide down the wall a little. Tony grabs on, clutching at his shoulders, and Steve stops. He looks adorably confused, but mostly sad. “Tony, I’ve…you don’t
“What am I, the team pet?” Tony says, laughing, but he lets Thor pull him up and back into the dining area.
“What about that time I cancelled on Jamie last minute on Christmas?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I-…” He clears his throat, tries again. His voice is strained when he speaks. “Are you hungry? Do you need anything?”
“Is that in conflict with my point?” he asks.
“Tony,” he tries. “I didn’t mean-”
Clint held the mask up for inspection, then turned a sharp eye on Bruce, then Steve. “Is Tony toxic now? Is he a mutant? Does he release poisonous spores? What the
would yell at me. Even you made a joke about my ego, like you all expect me to be such a fuck-up-”
“Seems like Stark deserves to get punched sometimes,” he says easily.
“Remember this moment, later,” she says. She closes her eyes, bittersweet guilt and pain flickering over her face. It’s an expression Tony knows well, although he doesn’t much like it. It’s one they’ve shared together, on many a dark night. “Remember this entire conversation. One day, it’ll be very, very funny.”
“He’s the squishy human of the group. Supposedly he got caught in the crossfire,” Rhodey adds, and Tony hums, considering the words.
“I scared you, huh?”
“Let me guess, both tie back to Roxxon?”
“Thank you,” Rogers croaked, the first sensible thing he’d said since Tony found him. His blue eyes were gaining clarity as he warmed, and he reached out a shaking hand to clutch at Tony’s fingers. “My thanks, for finding me.”
him do it the hard way.
“Sir, are you sure this is the best plan of action?” JARVIS says, sounding hesitant, and Tony cackles and splashes cold water on his face.
“What is it about this that does it for you?” Tony asks, because he can never leave well enough alone.
"Bruce found me a therapist here, Dr. Ingram. I like her. She doesn't let me get away with anything." He tilts his head, eyes gleaming. "Did you find someone, like you said? If not, Bruce has a recommendation for a doctor in LA, a friend of his. He does talk therapy and can also prescribe medication. You should call him."
Eventually Tony sits up, his cock slipping out of Steve’s body with a sound that makes Steve flush a little. Or maybe it’s the feel of it, Tony doesn’t know. He leans down to press chaste kisses to the pink skin below his eyes, over the bridge of his nose, even as he reaches up to undo the cuffs around Steve’s wrists. Steve’s eyes are warm and unbearably tender as he watches him, and he reaches out as soon as he’s able, pulling Tony into a low, searing kiss that sucks what little breath Tony had managed to regain straight out of him. He plasters himself to Steve’s front with a huff, resting their foreheads together. He breathes in the scent of him.
“I’m off the meds, and so now we can drink,” Clint explains. “No excuses. You’re on fuckin’ house arrest. You literally have nowhere else to be and nothing else to do.”
“She wishes to know where you would like her to meet you.”
, he thinks, wildly.
“I always want you, and you’re just so easy for me, alpha.” He gasped as Tony shifted, pressing more firmly up against him, and oh. He was probably going to come again.
to be lost. I should have tried harder. I could have talked to Coulson, or gone and tried to talk to the NIA-”
Steve clears his throat and glances around. Tony, thankfully, is not in any sort of compromising position. His shirt’s off. He’s standing at the sink, his torso twisted around as he tries to see the back of his own neck. He touches the skin there, frowning, and Steve reaches out to try and meet his fingers, to touch the place where his hand was. This time, his hand pushes straight through, fingers dipping under Tony’s skin.
“It is Christmas Eve, Stark. You can’t spend the night at the bar.”
“I doubt aeroplane disasters, combat scenes, and a lost love are what you require right now, in your more fragile recovering state.”
“You’re just upset Ben and Jerry’s gave me a flavour and not you,” Tony teased, but he fed Steve another spoonful.
T O M O R R O W, he insists, but Tony is the same, dogged mad man he’s always loved. It’s a treat, in some ways, to see him like this again. But right now Steve mostly just wants to take him to bed. T O N Y.
“Seems there’s a lot of that going around,” Rhodey says. His hand moves through the air like a scythe, as though he’s trying to cut away all the bullshit that’s been spewed this morning. “Did you people learn nothing from Project Insight?”
“I’m making you uncomfortable,” Steve said. His voice was flat, but it was all he could bear right now. He took another step back, away from Tony. “I’m sorry.”
“If you want me to win this fight, stop distracting me and get to the damn roof, Tony!”
“I’m much better at reading social cues than you,” JARVIS says, all charming false outrage, and Tony laughs and closes his eyes. “If I might suggest a radically different course of behaviour…”
, that same nasty little voice inside of him said, and Steve licked his lips, fingers hesitating over the keys.
Tony shrugs. He wanders over to the console, leaning into Reed’s space so he can glance over the readouts. “Oh.”
“You do that on your own,” Luke retorts. Tony laughs and turns to refill his mug. “Hey. You hanging in there?”
Steve’s not quite the monster Tony’d imagined in his wildest fantasies, but he’s big enough, and perfectly shaped, with a little bit of a curve to the right. Tony can feel his stomach tighten, thinking about what Steve felt like buried inside of him, pressing up against his sweet spot until he was literally drooling on the worktop.
“Your blood,” he says, and Tony glances around, as if Strange might mean someone else. “It will be destroyed in the process, do not worry.”
“Natasha told me not let you get away with bullshit.”
“Blast something, would ya?”
“You’ve progressed beyond your original coding,” Steve starts, then shakes his head. “Look, whatever you’re both mad at me about, I can’t fix it if he won’t see me.”
“Yeah, it is.” Steve glances at the floor, shaking himself a little. “I messed up, Sam.”
“Put a curve in it.”
“And Loki?”
Bucky leans in, under the pretext of reaching for the blueberry carton.
There were a few scattered laughs, more confused than truly amused. A spate of whispers broke out anew.
He’d tried to leave two more times, both without success. On the second go, after fighting through what felt like the worst electroshock torture of his life, he’d pushed through the pain and nausea and opened his eyes to find himself passed out on the floor next to his own motionless body. It had taken him another two hours to figure out how to get back to Tony, and by the end he’d been so exhausted and panicked that he’d lay at Tony’s feet for a solid twenty minutes, panting with exertion, trying to wrap his shaking fingers around Tony’s bare, fine-boned ankles and putting his hands right through him every damn time.
Tony furrows his brow, glancing down at his clothes then back out into the garage. A wry smile crinkles the corners of his eyes as he glances out across the dark pillars and the coleopterate metal shapes. He taps the edge of one curdled bruise.
He takes a very long shower, letting the steam open his pores for a proper cleaning as the hot water beats down on his tense shoulders. He has JARVIS put on ZZ Top and swings with it, running the bar over his arms as the shrill guitar wails over him, through him. A shadow moves in the corner of his eye, but when he swipes the heat film from the glass it’s just him and his blurry reflection, alone in the bathroom. The skin under his eyes is bruised and sagging.
“Same old, same old,” Nat agrees, and Tony nods. Then he steps through the doors, and back out into the cold, dark interior of the basement.
“No licenced medical professional will prescribe them in your current state. If your cortisol levels continue to rise at this rate, you’ll have Cushing syndrome by November 3rd,” JARVIS tells him. “At the risk of wasting my time, I’d like to recommend that you speak to Captain Rogers, or at the very least Doctor Banner. Your heart is already compromised; you’ll be at severe risk for a heart attack within a month.”
“You call that mischief? He completely decimated City Hall a few months ago!”
“No, I wanted him to let somebody else do it. Be Iron Man, I mean. I didn’t want him out there fighting at all.”
“Traitor.”
“Mm?” Tony pulled the bottle from his lips with an obscene sound, wiping at his mouth with the back of his hand, and Steve couldn’t have looked away if he tried.
“No,” Steve says frantically. He holds up his hands, his head shaking back and forth. His eyes are wide and earnest. “No, no, you’ve- you’ve got it all wrong-”
“Hey,” Tony says when the machine beeps, “it’s me. Again. Obviously. Dunno what’s going on, but uh, should I be worried? About you, I mean, because hey, this is pretty wild, literally no one being home to guard the Sanctum. Anyway, uh, I guess maybe I should send out a search party if a month passes? What’s the unacceptable timeline for your dimension-hopping sorcerer buddy to be totally AWOL? Please call me back, because this fucking curse is killing me, metaphorically, and
By the time he gets back to the penthouse in the afternoon he’s yawning: a wide, jaw-cracking thing that makes him want to curl up on the sofa and take a long nap.
He thinks, then, of Tony’s fantastical workshop, a place where the future blooms bright: blueprints and formulas gleaming a pale, iridescent blue. He’s spent the past few days doing his best to forget why he’d left the tower, but now, driving back after almost a week apart, he feels inexplicably nervous. He hasn’t gone this long without seeing Tony since they discovered they were soulmates. He feels a little like he’s crawling out of his skin. Separation anxiety, Romanov called it, although she was making fun of him then. He looks down at his hands, clenches and unclenches his fists. He wonders if Tony would scent him again, if he asks nicely.
Tony frowns. He pushes Reed out of the way, and Reed lets him. He glances around, yawns, pulls his limbs back into his pyjamas proper. Then he turns and switches to another monitor.
“I wish I could stay,” Tony said, regret pulling at his features. He pressed a kiss to Steve’s brow, his mouth, his chest over his heart. “Fuck, I love you.”
Tony turned to face him with the kind of swiftness that only came from hypervigilance, and now Steve could see that his eyes were wild, wide and mostly pupil. Before Steve could react Tony had plastered himself against the glass, and it was so much harder, now. He could see every line of Tony’s palm as he pressed his hands to the wall between them, as though he could feel Steve through the barrier.
“Hey, Tony?” Steve heard himself say, before he could stop himself.
“Yes,” Steve moaned, letting Tony manoeuvre him as he wished. “Alpha…”
Steve wraps him up as best as he can. He tucks his feet into the space between Tony’s back and the chair, smooths his hands over Tony’s back. He tucks Tony into the curve of his body.
When he was little, and his father was a particular flavour of merry-tipsy, he would tell him stories about the war; Captain America, his greatest creation. Of course, now Tony knows what a crock of shit that was. If anyone created Captain America, it was Erskine, but more importantly, Steve created himself. The existence of The Hulk and The Red Skull would suggest that Steve was the magic sauce, the catalyst that crafted the man. Still, he thinks he understands Loki, a little; the prodigal son, the desire to prove his worth, the violence and the rage. Tony remembers what it was like to blast out of his cage, to reign destruction upon the worthy. He remembers what it felt like to blow up the enemy with the biggest and best bomb on the market. A Stark, of all men, knows what it is to love destruction. It is what they cut their teeth on: blood and metal.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
As always, thank you thank you thank you to my diehard commenters/followers. I read over your comments when I feel like shit and they help a lot. I dunno that I'd keep writing without you. Please let me know what you think! Your feedback means a lot.
He was saved from Rogers’ retort by distance, whatever he might have said to that forcibly censored by the bright noon light and the bustling street. Tony hummed an old song under his breath, turning to step back around the building and cut through to the Parkers’ homestead. It was a good day, when he could say he’d managed to fluster the sheriff and get the last word in. Even better, he’d only had a bit of drink, without wanting to absolutely come apart at the seams for want of it.
to touch Tony. He
“That would soothe the egos of so many men,” Natasha purrs at him, and Tony can’t help but grin at her.
Sen is sitting on a train on her way to see the witch’s twin when Maria Hill walks into the common room. She looks tired, and she sits down silently across from Steve in one of the armchairs, folding one knee over the other. She’s dressed in her usual business clothes, but when she says nothing Steve turns his attention back to the television. It’s a beautiful movie, and he doesn’t want to miss a trick. They sit in silence while the movie plays on, not quite comfortable but not awkward either. Steve’s never been very close to Hill, and she makes him vaguely uncomfortable in the way that all beautiful, competent women do. He’s not sure he’s ever been alone in a room with her for this long.
[SPOILERS] Tony doesn't know if Steve is real/if Steve is really Steve. Desperate and a little high, he kind of joking but not really invites Steve to stay, then jacks off while imagining Steve is there. Steve, of course, is there, and has a ~~moment of weakness~~ (aka totally jumps him.) Tony is on board with it in the moment but has a Big Emotional Time afterwards. This is not about the sex, but about the fact that he thinks he's literally going crazy. However it is a potentially triggering sex scene. If you need to skip it, it'll be pretty heckin' clear when it stars. You can control/command + F for the sentence "Fuck, I’m going crazy." to skip.
“I shall take my leave,” he says, and Tony turns back to him, opening his mouth to apologise. Loki holds a hand up, and he subsides into silence. “Do not mistake me. I appreciate you holding to your end of the bargain.”
“That’s totally different-!” Peter begins, but Tony waves a lazy hand at him.
Tony clears his throat. He glances down at Steve’s body. Already, the airlock on the chamber is letting out a hissing stream of fog, pale white as it curls up towards the ceiling. The plate lifts, and Steve makes a split second decision. He slips into his body, lines himself up, and closes his eyes.
“I’ve met your Ms. Munroe,” Steve counters, “and she’s about the calmest woman I’ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with in my life.”
“I’m glad you did, personally,” she continued, and Steve raised an eyebrow from where he was buttering his own toast. “But also for practicality. I wanted to talk with you, privately.”
“No it
“Are you asking me?” Maria says flatly, and Steve chuckles despite himself. “This was your idea.”
Steve pushes another piece of waffle in his mouth and tries not to laugh while he’s eating as all of the Avengers dog pile on Luke. He puts Tony out of his mind for the moment. Instead he watches the way the light pours in and turns the kitchen golden, burnishes the skin and hair of everyone in the room and limns them like an oil painting.
“Come,” he groans. “Please. You know-”
Tony brings his other wrist up and does the other side of Steve’s neck, then up, behind his ears. Steve reaches up and holds his hands there, fingers light as a bird on Tony’s forearms. Just the faintest hint of pressure telling him to stay.
“Promises, promises.”
“Okay, Tony,” he says. He cracks a small smile. “Just don’t make me wait too long, okay?”
Joyce makes a face, and Tony tries again.
Steve isn’t sure he’s felt like this before. What he’d felt for Peggy was so different; clearer, less jumbled up inside questions about sexuality and belonging and the
“You see what’s been happening with the mutants,” Pepper warns, and Tony lets out a deep sigh.
So they’d ended up fucking, because apparently Captain America always being prepared meant carrying lube when you were going to confront the man you were in love with about why he was being so shifty recently.
“What if we run into him in the compound?” Natasha asked, but Bruce was already pulling a duffel bag out of the back of the Humvee. He knelt down and opened it, pulling out a series of heavy-duty respirators and handing them out.
“I don’t care about the greater good, Captain.” Steve stops talking, mostly because he has no idea how to respond to that statement. “I care about Tony, and this company, and myself, and my career. I care about being the top CEO in the country and one of ten––counting generously––female CEOs at my level in the world. I care about being the absolute best at what I do, and taking care of the small handful of people I count as my family. I like nice things, and efficiency, and accolades. Tony would be just as happy living grease-stained in a workshop with his armour for the rest of his life. He would be fine if he never had to put on a bespoke Tom Ford ever again. He wants to save the world, and help people, and make amazing things, and I’m not opposed to that. But I also think that Tony Stark’s brain is far too valuable to waste flying around in a steel trap getting shot at when a few hours of sleep-deprived manic engineering can produce medical technology that revolutionises the field the world over. I wish that the cover story that SHIELD had produced was true. I wish that he paid someone to go out there and fly around and fight bad guys in some delusion of heroism. I think being Iron Man is a colossal waste of both his time and potential.”
“Maybe pass on the news this morning,” he said, tossing the peel in the trash. Bruce just chuckled and turned the page.
“Uh huh.” Luke sighs. “Carol told me the team could use you in the field.”
In the upstairs apartment, Rogers was bare of all but his britches, huddled close to the stove. The jailhouse med-kit was open over his knee, and Tony paused just inside the door, dripping ice and snow all over the floor. He wasn’t sure what he was meant to do, now, if Rogers was well enough to patch himself up. He looked strangely aglow in the lamplight, miles of pale Irish skin slick with snowmelt.
“If you send me and Barton out, no holds barred, I promise we can find him within a few days. A week at the latest.” She put a gentle hand over his wrist, measuring his pulse or trying for reassurance, he didn’t know. “There’s a fifteen year old girl out there, Steve, and she’s been shot.” Emotional manipulation. Transparent, but in a way, it was a kindness; here is an excuse for you, to help you sleep at night.
“But…?”
“In truth, I do not know. There are others in the bloodline, but none that have been raised to be king as Loki and I were. They are valiant warriors, but they have not been trained in diplomacy or history, and the leaders of the other realms would not know them, would not have seen their mettle. It would be the same as my father appointing me to the throne all those years ago; I know now that younger, spirited, bloodthirsty version of me would make a poor king indeed.” He lets out a laughing breath, eyes glistening with something complicated and wet and hopeful all at once. “My brother may get his throne yet.”
Pepper sighs, and Tony can hear her begin to move again, murmuring something to someone before putting the phone back to her ear. “He wouldn’t want you to go in guns blazing, and you know it. You’re not just sitting there. You’re strategizing.” She clears her throat a little, voice prim. “You know he hates when you just rush in.”
Steve frowned, leaning back to try to get a better vantage point. “I don’t understand.”
Tony gets there before he does, just in time to get his hands under Loki as he staggers forward. Thor comes after him, less tired, but certainly having come from a battle. Blood is matted in his beard, a few splashes caught in his hair. His chest plate is strangely melted, and Tony surveys the two of them for a few long, silent seconds. Then he swallows, and steps back, away from Loki, because through the portal both he and Tony can see a place that is certainly not one they recognise. There’s equipment visible, there: armour, lying on a stone shelf as dark and richly coloured as onyx, and it is all too familiar. Loki sways dangerously on his feet.
“When he was dying, he gave Pepper his company and Rhodes his suit. I took it for recklessness,” Natasha said to him. He’d been pinned to the mat, panting, sweat beading his brow after a long sparring session. She was breathing hard, but wore her triumph like an old and well-loved coat. “I was wrong. I don’t make mistakes.”
Is that the word? He can’t believe what he’s hearing.
someone for me?” Tony demands, snarls really. “God, just when you were starting to prove yourself-”
“Yes. Sleeping.” Natasha smiles, the barest lift to the corner of her mouth. It’s a smile pretty much reserved only for his antics, and it relaxes him a little. He puts the mug down, rests his elbows on the worktop behind him. “You remanded Steve to psychological review.”
“I just-” Tony’s voice is breaking, now. His fingers are bone white under the flaking bloodstains. It’s Steve’s blood, of course: still dried under his fingernails, caught in the grooves of his calluses. Steve watches him clutch at Carol’s biceps, the leather of her jacket creaking under his fingers, and feels the clench of Tony’s hands around his heart. “Why couldn’t he stay?”
Running down New York's dew-damp pavement at dawn is strange after weeks spent under Amora's torturous control. Rationally, Steve knows it wasn't that long; less than forty-eight hours, even. But he's been a military man long enough to know the way the trauma feels means more than the facts, and so weeks it was.
The scene that greets him in the sunken living room isn’t exactly the one he’d been expecting. Loki is sitting across from Pepper with half of a peeled grapefruit in front of him, eyes alight as he converses swiftly with her in French.
Gonna show everyone that I’m yours-”
“Surely your ego doesn’t need me to stroke it, sir.”
The Germans have always been good at describing the horror of things.
“Not a bad Tony impression,” Steve deadpans.
“And you said?” he manages, completely tonelessly. He sounds like his fucking father.
“It doesn’t seem like that was a very successful plan,” he tells Tony.
“Oh.” Steve takes a breath, a shaky smile making its way onto his face. “You’re not running away at all.”
"You'll see."
It’s a little ink caricature of Tony. He’s standing in the middle of the workshop surrounded by his bots and holoscreens, brows furrowed, and there’s a little censored speech bubble emanating from his mouth. DUM-E is drooping in shame, and Tony can’t help but chuckle just a little at the image.
“Tis just a scratch,” Thor agrees. His blood has traced thin red lines down to his wrist, some catching on the edge of his armour there, some dripping off to splatter on the scuffed metal of the landing pad. It’s a lot of blood, but no more than any human might bleed from a cut on the hand. Steve has seen Thor recover from being impaled. This is nothing.
“Hey,” Tony said, ducking underneath him, pressing himself up against Steve’s front to catch his eyes. “Hey, sweetheart.”
“Why so shy now, Captain? Or was it someone else that decided to peep on me while I was having a private moment of pleasure?”
“That’s one,” Tony said, and Steve took a sharp breath. “Oh, baby, I’m gonna wreck you so well you won’t be able to move.” He dipped down, his tongue lapping over Steve’s abused bondmark, and Steve let out a desperate gasp.
Tony hadn’t had anything to say to that.
“Sweetheart,” Tony said, running his hands through Steve’s hair, and it was good. Tony was so good to him. “Any other omega in your position would have been hospitalised. You only got through like you did because of the serum. It’s alright if you’re still feeling out of sorts.”
“Thank you for the scarf,” he said, and Miss Jones nodded. “Well. Wish me luck, folks.”
, meaning foot. So the more accurate term is octopodes, from the Greek, not octopi, from the Latin.”
There was really no other way to say it. They’d meant to quietly infiltrate the compound, but the alarm had been tripped. Both Widow and Hawkeye swore up and down it wasn’t them, which could only mean that something was happening inside. Steve, struck by an all-encompassing bolt of fear, gave up all pretence of stealth and went full-Terminator as Tony liked to call it, cutting through the swathes of Hydra soldiers with brutal efficiency. Hawkeye had clearly taken up a vantage point in the catwalks above the main ring of the silo, because all around him arrows rained down upon their enemies. The report of a gun and the flash of its firing was the only hint he got of the Widow’s location, moving in perfect accordance with her codename as she slipped and swung through bars and grates and wrapped her limbs around unsuspecting soldiers. Death was a dance to The Black Widow, a serene song of grace and inevitability, and Steve loved to watch her work.
Steve sits in the empty common room for a long while after she’s gone. The sun is starting to sink in the sky, painting the landscape in hues of orange and gold, and Steve stares lazily out the window and watches it weave behind skyscrapers, disappearing and reappearing as it floats towards the horizon. When his mind flashes to Tony falling, it’s not even a surprise. He knows what it is to have combat exhaustion at this point in his life.
Tony smirks at the oath, then leaves the condoms on the table. He sucks a hard kiss to Loki’s nipple as he fumbles to get the cap on the lube open, enjoying the way Loki bucks against him. He rolls the other between his fingers, flicks a nail against it, and Loki lets out a low keening noise, grabbing the bottle from Tony’s hands and pushing him up. He drizzles the gel over his fingers, eyes dark and wanting.
“I don’t know if I can,” Tony says. He’s overwhelmed. Happiness is a dangerous thing, on Tony. He doesn’t know what to do with it. It spills out of him like light.
“Give me five minutes,” Steve says firmly, and well. Tony has to go with him, now, doesn’t he?
Steve flushes. D E S I R E he says, and Tony winks at him. His gaze goes half-lidded, pulling carnality over himself like a well-worn fur meant for luxuriating in. It warms Steve down to his toes.
Loki's face does something complicated.
He takes one last look at the city. Millions of people, all alive and Bonded and breathing. People he’d sacrificed his life for. It wasn’t enough, apparently, but he’d do it again.
did not, to my knowledge, dismantle a Japanese war camp in the fashion described herein, but I wouldn’t put it past her. She’s pretty badass. If anyone has any further interest in the history I'm sneaking in here, please feel free to ask! I’m happy to chat about them and provide plenty more.
Tony’s mouth twists. He takes a long sip of coffee, scorching and black as he likes it. Bruce waits, sitting on a stool and sipping his tea. Dummy is hovering, and Bruce has one hand on his strut, thumb brushing back and forth ineffectually in a strange affectionate approximation of petting. He looks comfortable. Tony knows better than to try to wait him out.
“What did you do?” Rhodey says, walking over to the newly formed crater in the ground. He peers down into it, then turns away. Tony doesn’t bother to look closer.
Is this what it feels like, meeting your soulmate for the first time? Tony feels like he's in an 80's ballad. He expects there to be strings.
Thor turns to survey Tony over his shoulder, his muscles flexing as Loki fights him. “I killed Hasegawa,” he says, firmly. Tony frowns, but doesn’t interrupt. “I did it to make amends for having wronged you, and in the hopes of approaching reconciliation with my brother, who cares deeply for you. As for my part, I should hope you do not require a declaration to know I would kill for you, irregardless should you ask this of me. I have killed more for far less. It is what I would do for any shieldbrother.” His expression clouds, then. “Loki saw something that frightened him, truly. Enough for him to ask for my help, which I think you know speaks to the seriousness of his visions.”
“Now, let us pray.”
“No killing people we don’t like,” Tony says sternly, but Loki just rolls his eyes.
“So, you became boring and predictable because it was unpredictable for you as the God of Chaos, and now you’re switching sides because you were getting…too predictable?”
“What have we got on the Masters of Evil, then?”
Pepper shrugs, looking uncomfortable. “What do you two talk about?”
Natasha swallows, tilts her head to the side. Her brow is furrowed ever so slightly.
“The time before, I mean. At the courthouse.” Tony explains. “He thought he was being kind, or something, probably.”
“And this bothers you.”
Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again, before finally being saved by the appearance of Bruce in the doorway. He looks rumpled, as always, and has a bandage around one hand.
“Riri Williams has been reunited with her family and seems mostly unaffected by the experience. It seems she is quite taken with Sir, and claims that he owes her lunch.” Steve grinned at that. “She offered to sign a nondisclosure agreement if it would make Sir feel more comfortable, but he told her that was unnecessary. She promised not to out him to the public. They shared an embrace. It was…touching.”
“Uh huh. Go. Home. This is the last damn time I’m gonna tell you, Stark.”
“I shouldn’t have kissed you like that, it was inappropriate-”
“So you’re first then?” Steve asks him, and Luke huffs and puts down his coffee mug with a decisive clink.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pepper smiles wryly at him. “Imagine what he could do if he dedicated himself to innovation full time.”
“Wait, first,” Tony says, holding up a hand. “I’d be a bad queer if I didn’t say that there are some folks who’ve got issues with the film. Personally, I have always been a fan, but just so you know.”
Jim nods. He turns his eyes to the television, expression twisted into something wry and almost bleak. “It’s his inability to take anything for granted,” he says, and Steve hums in agreement. He perches on the arm of the couch. “It’s incredible. He’s the richest man in the country and the only thing he’s ever taken for granted in his whole tragic, little White rich boy life is that bad things happen to him. Always.” There’s an overwhelming fondness in Jim’s words that take the sting out of them. But then, Steve has never doubted Jim’s love for Tony.
“Hence the smoothies.”
“Not my choice,” Steve defended himself, laughing. “Sit down and eat your omelette.”
with his tentacles, almost taste the slick wetness of Steve’s mouth as he closes his lips around the tentacle and sucks, hard and intent. His eyes have been swallowed up by black pupil, just a thin blue ring around the evidence of his desire as he tracks Tony’s expression with his eyes.
It’s the smell of ozone that makes him pull away. Tony’s lips are red and swollen, his eyes half-lidded and slightly distant. He swipes the back of one hand over his mouth, and Steve watches the way it distorts his skin, a sharp shock of pleasure breaking through his easy haze and shooting straight down to his groin in a lightning bolt of physical awareness. He can feel all the places where Tony was sweetly vicious with his teeth, and he wishes for the first time that he could bruise, just a little. The thought of wearing a mark where someone could see, where other people could know he’d spent the afternoon necking on the roof like a kid, settles something warm and possessive in stomach. It kneads at the muscles there like little cat’s paws.
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
“Can I send Loki to bother you with his intel?” Tony asks, widening his eyes in what he’s been told is a very fetching begging expression, and Bruce rubs at his mouth tiredly.
Tony nods, watching the numbers click down. “Widow, do a sweep of the interior. There’s anti-surveillance rooms on levels one through four. J, send a bot with her.”
Steve has come back before. There’s no reason why he can’t come back from this. But even with the blood transfusions and the healing factor, he hasn’t shown any improvement. He hasn’t healed. Eventually, they’d made the call to put him on ice.
“Sir,” JARVIS says, tentative, and Tony’s such an
,” Steve gasped, and it was so good he couldn’t see even with his eyes open. They kept rolling into the back of his head, legs shaking from how bad he wanted it. “Please make me come. I want it. I want to be good for you. I want to be good for your knot, alpha, Tony, oh, oh oh
“No,” Tony’d lied, and she’d smiled at him like she knew and pressed a kiss to the centre. The print of her lipstick on the crystal pane of glass was still there in the morning, and he’d stared at it for longer than necessary. Eventually, he’d wiped it off with a hotel towel and stepped into the shower.
should know better, and the fact that no one believes I can be is…it’s worse, even, than if someone,
Steve barks out a laugh, because that was a true statement if he’d ever heard one. Still. “I meant, do you think I want to know what you’re going to show me?”
Steve winces, because that’s maybe the most useless thing she could have said to Tony.
Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently
Tony lets out a helpless laugh. “Coding bias—the AI I programmed is just as bad at reading social cues as I am.”
“Most of the team is prepped and ready to move,” she says, handing him his coffee. “Hawkeye is putting some finishing touches on his arrows, something Banner gave him. I’m not sure I want to know.”
“Remember that asshole is gonna heal and get right back up,” he warns, then winces when Rhodey stomps one foot straight into The Executioner’s skull, crushing it. Amora screeches.
“Do we have a problem?” Cap asks, and Tony curses through the comm.
“Just wondering if SI PR needs to brace for impact,” Happy says easily.
“I do.”
“Please Tony,” Steve begs, “please, I
Steve nods. “Finish up and come to bed,” he says, and something vulnerable passes over Tony’s face. Then he nods, and disappears back into the bathroom.
discussion of consent issues
Loki frowns, hurt flashing across his face, but this time it’s faked. Or at least, Tony thinks it is. He’s learning. “Your injury is my fault, is it not?”
A loud cough cuts him off, and he whirls on Bruce with an honest-to-god snarl curling his lip. He only barely restrains the sound that wants to bubble up with it.
With all of the new players appearing, there wasn’t always much to do for The Avengers. Petty crime was a little below their paygrade, and that wasn’t just Tony being a snob. The fallout from any Avengers battle was massive just due to sheer firepower, and it seemed like a little much to break out the big guns for a mugging or a gang problem. Besides, Tony has an eye on things. He can see the moving parts, the way that Hell’s Kitchen has suddenly become a mecca for hipster heroes, or Reed Richards suddenly being made of rubber, or even that punk dressed up like a spider in Queens. The landscape is changing, and the Avengers are just an admittedly big piece of a bigger puzzle.
“We might die,” Tony deadpans, but there’s genuine fear, there.
He hops up and down a little in the elevator, shaking his arms out. But when the doors open, a familiar low laugh curls into him like caramel. In his heightened state, Tony’s laughter is like a straight shot to his core. He can feel himself blushing, but he can’t stop and turn back.
Finally, a shameless plug: if you’re a stony shipper who is down with A/B/O, I recently posted a
“Evan Freeman, sir.”
“K,” Tony grunts, sounding annoyed, and Steve realises that Tony had asked him a question.
“Yeah,” Tony says, as though he can hear Steve’s stupid, ineffectual nagging. He puts on a plastic smile, a pair of sunglasses. Then he opens the door, gets out of the car, and starts the long trip back to Steve’s funeral.
“Go get him” he said. “Bring him home.”
saw him get hit, even if they didn’t see where he went down.
Kitty dodges a last, desperate attack from Ghost. She slips into the floor to avoid his sharp clawed hands, then comes up behind him and gets him in a headlock. She does something with the glove, pressing it against his neck until a strange, almost hissing sound emanates from it. Ghost slumps, falling to his knees in the small room.
“A few weeks past. Rogers sent me this…this letter,” Tony says, frowning. Rhodey makes a face at the use of Rogers’ name, but Tony chooses to ignore it. “And a phone.”
“We can’t even manage a whole meal together,” Tony points out, and Steve closes his eyes and sucks in a sharp breath. “Steve…”
, Tony. Good luck!” she sings, drawing out the words. Tony sighs, lifting a hand over his shoulder as he stands and walks back towards the door. “Tony.”
He flops onto his back, starfish, and stares at the ceiling.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony smiles thinly at him, and Luke twists his lips up into a grimace. “You should go outside. Take a walk. It’s a nice day.”
Xavier studies him for a moment before nodding. “Alright.” His wheelchair moves so that he is positioned directly in front of Steve’s chair. He puts his hands out, hovering them on either side of Steve’s skull. “May I?”
“I’ve haven’t been beholden to anyone since 1991,” Tony says, “and I don’t think I like it very much now. You definitely don’t.”
“I cannot find his energy signature anywhere in the compound, sir.”
“I’d recommend just taking off the entire firing mechanism,” he says, pointing to Rhodey’s halved shoulder guns. “You’ll have to go without looking like a poorly dressed tank.”
“Yes, boss.”
I also realised after I wrote this that everyone in it was on the Protect Tony Stark train, probably to make up for the brush with potential squick/rape in it. But also I hate the trope where everyone tells Tony he's no good for Steve and fulfills his own personal insecurities, so. There's a story for you where everyone wants to protect and love Tony instead. Even Stephen! In his own grumpy way.
“Hilarious,” Tony mutters, turning towards the large oak doors.
He could tell his words had the desired effect on Tony. He looked overcome with some emotion that Steve couldn’t even try to name, and for a moment, Steve thought he might confess. But then it passed, and a small smile stole over Tony’s face instead, so sweet and genuine and full of hope that Steve couldn’t help but kiss him. He couldn’t imagine doing anything else.
Tony hesitates. “And Bucky.”
“Loki,” Tony warns, and Loki laughs, waving a lazy hand at him.
“We won’t,” he says, and Tony takes a shaky breath. “Together, remember?”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Steve is chanting, halfway between supplication and thanks. He’s struggling to keep his eyes open, eyelashes fluttering. “I need- please, I need-”
“Ooh, we’re joking about that now,” Tony says, and when Cap laughs, he moves quickly, pulling the crumpled cartilage straight. Steve’s laugh is broken in half by a choked-off gasp, and Tony placates him with an apologetic kiss pressed to the end of his chin.
“Get off!” he wheezes, eyes swimming. JARVIS is telling him something, something important. He’s telling Loki to let go. “Don’t fucking magic me, you spineless piece of shit. Let go of me now.”
“Uh,” Tony says, sipping at his cup. It’s fine china, probably actually from China, knowing the Sanctorum. He wrinkles his nose a little at the taste. “Break the curse…?”
Tony shakes his head. He feels like his body is just one bright, raw nerve. He’s so breakable under Steve’s hands. But his body betrays him—tentacles, with minds of their own in the truest sense of the word, have slowly begun to wrap around Steve. They touch the scale and then retreat, feeling gently along the uncomfortable edges of metal until one finds the dip of skin between neck and cowl. The very tip rests there, soft and trusting, against the place where Steve’s carotid beats steady and warm.
They are so, so far from being ready for that conversation. They might not be ready in a decade, Tony isn’t sure.
“I don’t want you to feel pressured,” he tried, but he really wanted to spend his next heat with Tony. He wanted the bite. He wanted to try.
Steve lets out a shuddering groan. He takes Tony’s mouth in a bruising kiss, and Tony grins into it, teeth clacking unattractively for a moment before he controls himself. He feels like his skin is on backwards, like Steve’s hands are touching his insides. His palms are so hot against Tony’s stomach, his thumb tracing a scorching line over his collarbone. He feels raw, flayed open.
“Tony,” Bruce says, and Tony turns back to him. “Does the name Thanos mean anything to you?”
“Even the living get left behind.”
“Are you alright, sir?” JARVIS asks, alarmed. Tony raises one hand with the bird. “I shall take that as a no.”
“I’m gonna try,” Steve says evenly. “You know where he’s at?”
Steve is a revelation like this. In the beginning, Steve had been quite toppy. He was insatiable, and bolder than Tony might have expected, but after a few times it made a strange kind of sense. Steve was sure of his welcome. He trusted Tony. It was humbling, to see Steve let himself be selfish and just take what he wanted for once. It was something he never did, but Steve had confessed, sex-drunk and satiated, that it was because Tony had always been the one to push him to indulge. Now that he knew that Tony wanted what he wanted, indulgence was easy.
A breathless gust of laughter breaks free of Tony’s chest. He wipes a tired hand over his face. “Fuck. Sorry, Happy.”
Spiderman stares at him for a long moment. Almost too long. It’s strange, to see him so still, and Steve resists the urge to fidget as the silence stretches out to awkward lengths. Tony, to his credit, simply meets his gaze calmly and waits.

I will only be embedding the banner as personally I mostly read fics on my phone and find it super annoying when I can't see the whole image and it takes up a lot of scrolling space and just makes my life difficult lol... but I will link in A/N before and after for the relevant scenes!
Beth smiles. She reaches out and claps a hand to his shoulder, her eyes bright. “Give me what you’ve got and I’ll do some digging while you make your phone calls.”
“I’ve eaten two whole meals today, scouts honour,” Tony says, one hand over his heart, the other raised to God. The smile Steve offers him is weak, but it’s there: soft and a little pained.
“I’ll take a mission,” Steve says. “Go down to D.C., help Romanov with the STRIKE team or something.” His jaw is tight as a steel trap.
“I have never felt safer, or more cherished, or more sexy, and beautiful, and deserving, and loved than I do when I am with you, Tony,” Steve said, glaring through the glass to make sure that Tony was with him. “You are the most incredible mate anyone could ever ask for.”
“But you said I’m smarter than him.”
to Steve—had only worsened things. Now they barely needed to speak at all to communicate. Sometimes it felt like Steve could read Tony’s thoughts across his furrowed brow like a ticker tape, plain as the star on his mailed chest.
“I want it,” Steve groaned, burying his hands in Tony’s hair. He pulled him up for a kiss, messy and biting and panting against him. “Tony-”
Peter stills. He sucks in a breath. Then he turns, and fixes Steve with those fearless white-lensed eyes. “Sometimes that’s all he needs.”
who knows what to do with his body, with his hands.
warnings: some intense discussion of homophobia, WWII, the AIDS crisis, internalised homophobia, statutory r*pe
Steve stills. He puts a bookmark in the book he was reading and sets it down carefully on the table. “James is here? Not with Tony?”
But his mother had just offered him a wry smile. “If Minerva is punishing me for daring to have such a clever child, then I shall bear the punishment with grace,” she’d said, leaning down to kiss his brow.
This is the bit where I out myself as a DV survivor. The right to ownership of experience is paramount, for me, especially taking personal experience into account. Some people feel being spanked as a kid for running into the street is abuse, or even their parents yelling at them. Some people don’t, and think their parents were great despite (or even because of) these things. I have a very cut and dry, bruises and broken bones experience, but I also experienced the former, which I do not count as part of my trauma. Not everyone feels the same way. All experiences are valid.
“Shall I start a tally system, Sir?” JARVIS deadpans, and Tony grins impossibly wider. “You are in a good mood this morning. I wasn’t sure, after the events of the night prior, how you might be faring.”
“Did she?” Steve asks. He watches the numbers change as JARVIS takes him back up to his quarters. The Avengers’ levels aren’t on the general elevator controls; Tony hadn’t seen the sense of it, partially for safety reasons. JARVIS’ authentication was required for anyone seeking to visit the upper floors.
This is the end of their strange acquaintanceship: the closest thing that’s felt even close to normal in this loud, over-bright new version of his city. He’s desperate, suddenly, to make the moment last, and he turns to Stark and his slick purple convertible.
“Loki said she can shoot through steel,” Rhodey says, shrugging as he fights with the gun rigging with a little muscle from Dummy. “Seriously, can we talk-”
“What?”
“Well, you’re incredibly tight.” Bruce digs into Tony’s shoulders for emphasis, pulling another groan out of him. “Not sure if that’s from the armour or hunching over your worktop all the time. Maybe both. You should probably be getting massages regularly. Do you get headaches?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The TV turns on, and Steve watches with horror his parting shot in the workshop, from that very first fight they’d had after Loki appeared. He watches himself speak, just a throwaway comment, but this time he can see the way Tony flinches back like he’s been struck. He watches himself walk out of the workshop without looking back, watches Tony stand still for a few long, painful moments, his face expressionless. The footage cuts off, and Steve turns his head back to stare at Tony. He’s making the same face now. It’s the same face he makes when the press is hounding him about his past as The Merchant of Death, the way he looks after a bad night, the way he looks when he’s so deep into his own mind that Steve can’t manage to pull him out for anything.
"Did Loki just save Widow?" Clint says, sounding stunned but also furious. "And what the fuck are those agents doing?"
“Give it to me,” Tony says, dropping down into the seat on Bruce’s right. Natasha puts a carton of food in front of him, a pair of chopsticks sticking out of it, and Tony stares at it in confusion for a half second before processing it as pad kra pao.
When the whiskey has warmed his bones and left him languid, he makes his way to his bed. He lets the cool sheets swallow him up, lets the city glow lull him, lets the darkness come slow. If he dreams, he does not remember it.

“Anyway, he and Sharon would have worked it out eventually.” Tony shrugs, but Peter looks sceptical. He pushes the last of his waffles around his plate, his jaw set a that way that Steve knows intimately from looking at his own face in the mirror.
Tony sucks in a breath. He swipes the back of one hand over his forehead, turns to see Steve's brows furrowed in worry. He remembers his promise, which he's already broken.
“No, because this is for you, and so you’ll still owe me after you do it.”
“What do you want, Tony? If you could move us like pawns, regardless of our wants, what would you do with us?”
What he finds is almost worse.
“Yes, make love to you?” Steve asked. “Or yes…?”
,” Steve gasps, and Tony smiles.
He remembers visiting the VA with Sam a few times, listening to soldiers who'd lost pieces of themselves. The war was different these days, more complicated. It was harder to tell civilian from foe. Some of them could still feel it, strong as before the loss, a phantom imprint of a hand or leg long gone. Or worse; a searing, phantom pain. The mind was slippery like that. The feeling, that memory, meant more than the reality.
,” Steve says, testing the word out. It’s the first time he’s said it aloud.
“Sparring, brunch, and movie nights,” Steve answers honestly. He rubs at his mouth, nerves fluttering. “Tony skipped out on movie night. I was pretty sore about it.”
“I adore you,” Tony whispers, like he’s gifting Steve a secret, and the verity of it makes Steve shudder. Tony’s eyes are so bright. “And I’m so fucking glad you’re alive.”
“I’m not the ideal omega,” Steve countered, rolling his eyes. It was an old fight.
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, firmly now, “who did you give Bucky to?”
“Best of ten!” Clint yelled, jumping up and getting in Tony’s face. Tony growled at him, but he was clearly joking, and so Clint ignored this entirely. “You cheat!”
“Bruce’ll know if it’s okay for us to see each other,” Steve said, nodding at him. He was relieved when Bruce nodded back. “You’ll all definitely know if it’s not. I’m not even sure if it’s a good idea for me to hear his voice in person, although coms should be fine. But most importantly, we absolutely cannot scent each other. Not until Bruce clears it. Do I make myself clear?” He met the eyes of each of his team individually, waiting until he got a nod from each of them. Thor and Clint looked a little horrified, but Nat just seemed determined. Bruce’s expression was all empathy, however, and it made Steve want to break down sobbing at the table. “Break my legs if you have to. I’ll heal. Do whatever you need to do to keep me from him. If you care about us, you’ll do this for us. Please.”
“Anger was not writ into my coding, Captain.”
“You set a bad example for the children, never wearing a damn helmet,” Tony always tells him, and Steve grins at the memory. He loves the feeling of the wind on his face, the rush of it through his hair as he takes a turn. He loves being able to hear the world around him as he drives, the rumble of the engine and then, fainter, underneath, the sound of the trees creaking, a hawk circling overhead, a murder of crows. On his bike, he understands intimately Tony’s obsession with flying. He’s jumped off many a height into Tony’s waiting arms just to feel that same rush with him, the air and the world and the speed of everything slipping past in a blur of colour and sound.
“I’m fine,” Tony says, finally. He turns and offers Luke a plastic, movie-star smile.
Steve nods, because that makes sense to him. He’s seen how Bruce deals with the Hulk, the way the reactor pains Tony in the winters. Powers often come with a price. He thinks of Erskine, lying dead on the basement floor, and thinks maybe he knows that better than most.
Steve knows, in this moment, that this sight will eat away at him for the rest of however long his consciousness abides. It is powerful enough to supersede the image of Tony wrapped in nothing but bright crimson fabric, draped over his hips like some kind of glorious Roman statue. Here, Tony is naked in the entire, golden and beautiful in the lamplight. Steve can see the tendons of his thighs straining, the small divot at the place where they meet groin a shadow that Steve desperately wants to press his tongue to. His gaze lingers there, because he knows that anywhere else he might look is more treacherous.
Tony smiles, then, thinly. Steve’s expression is sombre. He’s still as a statue, eyes gleaming bright. “It was a double edged sword. My parents always assumed I was going to be an alpha. I mostly pass as one, even without blockers, and I’ve always hated doctors, so when I presented my parents didn’t really know. I smelled like an alpha, mostly. It wasn’t until my first heat that they realised something was wrong with me.”
