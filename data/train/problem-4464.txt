Long enough for his hands to come back out of his pockets, and his shoulders to lose their self-conscious hunch. Long enough for the hurt in his eyes to seem nearer the surface.
Cas came to stand by Dean, and because he could, Dean leaned forwards and kissed him again. His heart raced as he did it. Cas kissed him back, and Dean felt as though gravity probably shouldn’t be holding him down at this point.
“Yeah, man, of course,” Dean said, trying to speak loud enough to be heard, but not loud enough to disturb
“It’d be worse for him, being tailed everywhere and having to live like a real celebrity,” Jody said. “It’s so restrictive, he’d go out of his mind.” Dean thought about it - thought about what Cas had said to him in the back room of the Ground Floor theatre about being lonely, wanting to come to The Refuge for one night of being normal, trying to leave the interviews and the persona of Castiel behind just for a night.
mug that pitched Castiel over the edge. His expression didn’t change, but with sudden fury, he launched the roll of tape hard at the nearest wall.
“Yes. It was,” Castiel said, able to answer honestly. It really had been nice to get away from everything. All four of them had been so happy. Coming back to the palace had felt like waking up from a dream. In the car on the way back, Castiel had felt Dean move away from him, physically distancing them. The stony look had returned to his face. Castiel had felt the pit in his stomach open back up, wider than ever, as he realised that this was what the future was going to be. Distance, carefully and angrily maintained.
“Cas…” Dean’s eyes are searching his face, looking for the place where something is wrong. Castiel wants to cut in, insist that nothing is wrong. Take Dean’s hand again, reach for more – he could reach for more, he thinks, and his heart twists, and his head feels light. He could reach for more. Dean might let him. Dean was holding his hand for a moment, there, by choice, as though it really meant something. Castiel’s mouth is dry.
He arrived with the usual beam of light and hiss of pale smoke, which quickly dispersed into the gloom of the dark alley. He'd landed in a crouch and stayed down for a moment, one hand on the hilt of his runeblade, the other bracing his weight on the floor. He looked up, and his eye-tech scanned the surroundings. They reported no signs of life in the nearest twenty metres. He was alone.
He couldn’t take it back now. Like that first look at Cas, across the bar, when he’d sung the Adele song - like every time he sang with Cas around, really - he’d done something he couldn’t take back. Revealed himself in a way that couldn’t be hidden again. He kept his head low, kept playing. His heart was pounding, aching, and he put that twist of pain into the music, into his voice.
“Oh?” Dean said. Castiel could see him thinking things, so he quickly added to the group, “I’ll just take Dean to get it, and then return. I won’t be long at all.”
“Two very grand names,” she said. “This is a historic occasion. But let’s not forget, it’s also the union of these two people who stand in front of me. Before us all, they will pledge the rest of their lives to each other – a promise to love each other, and support each other, and be the rock in each other’s storms. This is a royal wedding, but it’s also the beginning of a marriage that will be like any other – full of small happinesses and strifes, that the two of them will face together, with love to sustain them.”
But that night, Dean bought himself some ground beef and some onions and some smoked paprika and some cheddar cheese and some salad and a brioche bun, and he made himself a burger. Melted cheese dripped down his chin as he ate, offset by the crunch of lettuce and the burst of sweetness from the tomatoes and the tang of the paprika flavour.
Dean doesn’t point out that he’d been hoping for a lot more.  “At least she really loves the place, you know?”
Dean hovers over the phone for a minute, wondering if he can somehow save himself from the third degree.
“It’s just...you seem to think I know a lot about hand hewn beams and things, and I’m afraid I don’t. I think...you have a very high opinion of my skills and perhaps you shouldn’t.  I have skills, I can definitely be of assistance, it’s just...I didn’t want you to get the wrong impression.”
“Sammy,” Dean whispers.  “C’mere.”  He manhandles Sam around so he’s straddling Cas’s thighs on his hands and knees, and then Dean pulls Sam’s cock out of his shorts, half hard and already long, nearly touching Cas’s stomach.  “He’s gonna love this.” he tells Sam.  “Wait til you see.”
“This is more comfortable,” Cas continues in his incredible voice.  “Thank you, Dean.  I simply didn’t want to make you feel foreign here.”
Bobby tips his beer bottle in Dean’s direction.  “No dog too old for new tricks,” he assures.  “Or too dead, turns out.”
“For spending the evening with me.  For making me feel...more like myself.  It’s been a long time and talking with you this way, reminiscing, it’s really been…”  He swallows, and he looks at Dean with a half smile that makes Dean’s mouth dry.  “It was a wonderful night.” He drifts a little closer, close enough for Dean to see how blue his eyes are, the little mark on his lip on one side, how he has the barest hint of stubble.  How god-damn beautiful he is when he looks at Dean like that.
She reaches out to prod his upper arm experimentally, then gives him a coy look.  “A strapping young lad like yourself?  I’m sure I can think of something.”
Dean wonders if Cas sees the way he glitches, as well.  It feels weird to talk to Cas about it.  Almost as weird as it had felt going home with Jesse.  Even though Cas had more or less told him to do it, it feels oddly disloyal.  And now, he realizes that Cas has no idea he’s bi, and at best won’t get it and at worst will think he’s some possessed deviant, but he doesn’t want to lie, either.
Dean goes cold all at once.  He knows he did something wrong, and has no idea what it was.  “Yeah, Cas, glad to help.  If you, ah...if you ever have any questions, you just...you let me know.”
“I think...he does.  Of course he does.  He wants to feel your mouth, Dean.  How warm it is.  Wants to feel your hand on his neck, your lips...”  His voice is thick, and Dean wishes he could do it all for real.
“Dean,” Cas greets him with what seems to be concern as he walks in the door, and Dean is relieved to see him.  Having someone else know about Cas, what he is, and where he is—it’s a tightness in his chest, like he’s given away a secret.
“Do you mind if I eat?” Dean asks.  “You could...you know, if you wanted—have a seat and see if there’s something you’d like?”
Sam shrugs.  “Well, not really.  I mean, it’s Kansas, it’s like, banks and drugs and fronts, stuff like that.”
, Cas says.  He rises over Dean until they’re no longer touching, and then he’s unfolding somehow, opening up and getting brighter, more intense.  This light is warm, Dean can feel it on his skin like starlight.  It’s blue, similar to the color Cas is when he’s not speaking, but it’s...alive.  It’s pure.  It’s not Cas’s speech.  It’s..
“There’s a lot you can do from far away, Dean,” Charlie says, heading into the living room and collapsing onto the couch.  “Talking, for one.  Let him talk through it.  A sympathetic ear goes a long way.  And maybe you can send him something, right?  Like, his favorite snack food, or something he’d find comforting—a drink, a blanket...just something to let him know you’re thinking of him.”
He takes the key out of the lockbox on the doorknob and opens the door to reveal the hardwood floor and ecru walls of the entryway, and peeks into the kitchen before heading for the living room.
They don’t touch like this.  For Cas, it’s felt too fragile a thing to think about before they reach their destination.
Dean puts down the sandpaper.  “Okay, wait.  One—I love that you feel like this somehow makes the house less impressive.  Because, dude, this thing?”  He points at the dollhouse, currently in three pieces, “is a tiny, simplified facsimile of a house, and I have fucked it up at least five times.  And that’s
“Thank you, Dean.”  Cas floats into the chair across from him and leans forward, sniffing appreciatively.  “What did you get?”
It takes considerably longer than it probably should for Cas to get to sleep.  He’s slept without Dean before.  When one of them is travelling for work, typically.  But it’s been a long time, and it’s never been because one of them was with someone else.
“I can’t.  Your Latin is terrible, and I think that’s for demons.  And it definitely wouldn’t work even if I
“Yeah, okay, Dean,” Sam says, shaking his head.  He spoons out some eggs and tosses some bacon on a plate, then grabs another and fills it.  “Need anything fancy, Cas?”
“I...yeah, it was good.  His name is Jesse, he’s a good guy.  We, ah, met through a friend, she’s always trying to get me to go on double dates and I guess she just—”  Dean dares to glance over and his stomach drops out.
“And I can’t let him go back alone.  I left to keep him safe.  And I thought it was enough, I thought it...absolved me, or something.  That, after that, it was his choice.  But I can’t do it again.  I can’t go on living easy when he’s living hard.”  He won’t look at Cas.
Dean leans across Cas awkwardly and kisses his brother’s cheek.  “Morning, lazy ass,” he says softly.
“That sounds perfect, Dean, thank you.  It’s so wonderful to have a nice, strapping young lad around.  It’s hard when it’s just little old me, bouncing around in this big house, naught but a ghost to keep me company.”  She waves at Cas, a ‘calm down’ motion even though he hasn’t moved.  “Not that I don’t appreciate you, dearie.  It’s just…it’s helpful to have someone corporeal about, wouldn’t you agree?”
“It’s fine.  I think everything will be fine,” he says, sounding unconvinced.  “I expect it will be nice and quiet.”
He takes his 9:30 appointment on a showing, all smiles, all professional, and tries not to think about Cas and Jesse, and how nothing feels quite right.
He brings the house in, half assembled, sets it in on the dining room table and then heads to the kitchen.
Dean has blossomed in the time since.  He’s become a member of their neighborhood.  He greets Mrs. Zullo on her way to the mailbox, and Ms. Butler on her way to school.  He helps people change their spark plugs or their tires, tells the kids to put on their bike helmets.  He isn’t that terse, angry, suppressed twenty-five year old anymore.
“Here,” Cas offers quietly, and Dean takes the kit and rustles through it, pulling a penlight out and looking into their guest’s eyes.
Cas looks up from where he’s already huffing away, trailing pleased wisps of coat behind him.  Wide-eyed, he asks, “You
“Come and get it,” he tells them.  He sounds strict, as if he’s somehow withholding something by not handing the cups over to the bed.  Cas kisses Dean’s neck as he grabs Sam’s cup and passes it back, and then his own.
,” he gasps, arching up as both of their mouths touch him at the same time, one hot on the shaft of his cock, the other licking his scrotum with broad, wet strokes.
Thank you for your patience and your feedback, you're all fabulous and appreciated!!!  I'm hoping to post at least weekly through November, I'm working on this (and a few other WIPs) for NaNoWriMo.  I did add a new tag and increase the total chapters to 12, since I realized I needed some things to happen before what I had planned for chapter 6 (now 7).  Thanks again, I hope you enjoy!
“Yeah.  Like that.  So,” he clears his throat.  “Once we’re on the same page, I’d lean in slow, let him meet me half-way,” and he leans forward, watching Cas’s eyes and mouth, wishing desperately that they could do this for real.
“Is this how you want to be?  I want to be looking at you how you’re comfortable.  I thought your eyes would be—” he gestures at Cas’s chest, where the mass of his form had been in the holo.
He gets out of the car and makes his way to the front door, only to just miss being smacked in the face with it as Rowena strides through.
Dean takes a deep breath to slow his pounding heart.  “Somewhere in the middle, I think, is the way to go.”  He finds himself staring.
Dean has no idea.  “Yup,” he says confidently, watching Mary show off the wainscoting he’d installed in the living room. That, at least, had been his idea.
Sam perks up.  “Well, something like that.  We were talking about the power structures—our problem is Azazel, but there are actually a few families out there that tend to trade territory—”
He tucks a pencil behind his ear and grabs a bracket.  “All right, where do you want them?  Same height as the mantel?”
Sam shrugs.  “Yeah, I guess.  My dad just couldn’t get it together.  I mean, he’s better, now.  Still goes off sometimes.  Like now.  But he's got a home.  A plan.  Guys he works with.  It's not
He waits until Rowena’s gone upstairs, and then steps forward, closer to the ghost.  “I wanna make this work,” he says.  “I can’t even think about being with anyone else.  Haven’t for a while.  You know?  I’m done pretending this isn’t what I want.  Okay?  I’ll see you tomorrow, I’m gonna kiss you again soon.  As long as…”  His confidence wanes.  “Is that what you want?”
.  Holy shit.  Holy.  Shit.”  His heart finally slows down as he hits the highway and points Baby back toward the office.
They share a look that convinces Dean he does, and he goes warm with it.  Sure, they’d talked about it, sidelong, hinted at feelings and dreams of a shared future...but Dean hadn’t let himself hope for it.  Not really.  Not yet.
to enjoy the food as it cooks.  More ingredients join the chaos on the small counter when he assembles a sweet and spicy rub for the roast he decides to pick up after work.
Dean looks out on the lake.  It’s peaceful here, a good place to wind down.  He casts into the water, reels the line in slowly.  He’s indifferent to what he might pull, or if he catches anything at all.  There’s never much that he needs, here.  A pole, a beer, the breeze blowing in off the water.  Maybe someone beside him, chatting idly about their day, watching the ripples on the water and making his heart trip just with their presence.
(he’d considered a few words, his first choice close to ‘soulmate.’  But he’d chickened out and gone with the more broadly applicable, ‘close friend.’)
“No!”  Cas’s fingers seize in the fabric of his shirt.  “No.”  He looks into Dean’s eyes.  “Dean, I want more.
I promise, this turns the corner in the next chapter or two (haven't decided how things will get split up).
“Fuck off,” Sam murmurs, waving his middle finger generally in Dean’s direction without opening his eyes.
It's been a very long time, I'm sorry about that.  I'd hoped to have another section done (which would be part of this chapter) but I don't really want to delay this for another few days to get that part completed, so, here you are!  Happy New Year!  I hope you're all doing well, and I hope you know I appreciate you all so very much!  I hope you enjoy this small offering, I'll try to post the second half of this section next Monday or sooner.
Dean jumps and looks over, and Cas has flickered into existence on the passenger side of the car, eyes trained studiously ahead.
Dean wriggles around and kisses him again.  “Sam and I are doing some planning in the kitchen, I got the impression you wanted in.”
The voices in the kitchen are hushed, but Cas can still hear them as he comes down the hallway.  He’s still sweating from his workout, just needs some water.  But he slows down to listen, even knowing he shouldn’t.
Dean chuckles.  “Okay, you caught me.  I did want to talk to you, though.  I...remember those weird journals you had from Grandpa Campbell?”
“You’re a godsend, babe,” Dean says, sliding his arms under Cas’s, around his waist and then pressing his face into Cas’s shoulder.  “Thank you.”
“Oh, Dean,” Rowena croons as she opens the door.  “Welcome, dear.  I was just heading back to the garden.”
a good person or whatever.  It meant a lot, the time we got to spend together, so thanks.  You know, for that.  For listening to me for as long as you did.  For being a friend.”
He puts a coat of sealer on the shelves and props them up to dry, then heads back inside.  “I’ll come do another coat tomorrow morning,” he tells Cas.  “You can let me know if they need another after that, we’ll have them up next week.”
He remembers to lock the door behind him this time, hands shaking as he hopes that the ghost is stuck in the house like all the horror movies say; he’s still clutching the tire iron and trying not to die of a heart attack.
people were who...who felt like that.  Who…  So, I told myself it didn’t mean anything.  I had a good life, Dean.  I just...I never...I
Cas licks Dean’s ear and is gratified when Dean stutters, then continues as Cas moves down the line of his jaw, his throat.
“Hell yeah!  Ellen taught me everything I know, man, so I learned from the best.  And I love cooking, it’s a great way to…”
Cas goes quiet and serious.  “I don’t ever want to scare you away, Dean.”  There’s no hint of humor.
He must make a noise.  Dean’s eyes, sharp and impatient, look over at him and nod to the corner.  “Sit down,” he says.  “Don’t look. I can’t take care of both of you.”
Finally, he’s got a pillow under his head and covers over one leg, and Dean crawls in on one side, and Sam curves in on the other, and despite the likelihood of their imminent death, it all feels pretty perfect.
The carrier lands without incident, and Dean files out with the high class passengers, refusing to feel self conscious in his secondhand water recycling suit and old tech.
“This is the original construction, correct?”  Her brogue is strong and oddly soothing.  She takes charge easily, leaving Dean feeling a little off kilter.  He’s not sure whether to hope for Cas to show or not.
Sam looks over, unflinching.  “I know that, Cas.  I see it.  He’s happy here.  I’ve never seen him so happy.  When we were kids, it wasn’t anything like this.  Maybe it was for Dean, I guess, before...  My dad...he, ah.  He kinda went crazy after my mom.”
The vibrations of Dean’s low laughter make him whine and squirm, and then they hold him down as if they’ve planned it, letting his cock slide between their kissing lips, swiping him with wet tongues as his cock presses through the heat of their joined mouths.  He doesn’t mean to thrust, doesn’t want to take, but he can’t help it.
“C’mon Cas.  We both know who runs the house part of the house, here.  You picked out the wood, didn’t you?  And the hardware?”
He releases Sam abruptly and stalks to the kitchen, starts assembling coffee with shaking hands.  The shower is still running.
He opens them again to find Dean and Sam kissing just above him.  He can see the flash of tongue, lazy between them, and his whole body takes notice.
Sam still has a limp, but he’s started working out —  pull ups and planks that make Cas cringe inside, knowing how painful it was when he’d had his appendix out and tried to get back into shape.
“I’m fairly certain that isn’t a profession,” Cas says primly.  “I mean that I can’t help them keep up on the house because I can’t
It’s after eleven when they’re both in bed and Dean clicks off his light and turns toward Cas. The darkness makes everything a bit more intimate, so when Dean slides a hand up the outside of his thigh, Cas whimpers.
“Yeah,” Dean mutters, yanking his pants up.  “I know that, okay? I’m not trying to tell you what to do, I just don’t want you to get killed out there, is all!  Sorry for caring about you, Jesus!”
The man’s face brightens and he moves toward Dean, more gliding along the ground than actually walking.
A window blows open in the bedroom and Dean starts. “I’ll get it,” he says, and rushes off to close it.
“Well, we’re not done yet, buddy. Hold onto your hat.  Try the Sinatra.  Am I ridiculous, was he even a thing for you?”
“Shhh,” Dean whispers.  “Easy,” he says, and Cas tries to focus on the sound of his voice, tries to let whatever’s coming happen.  Slows his breathing, marginally.  Contemplates baseball and realizes he knows nothing about it.
He’s this close to too much when Cas starts to withdraw.  First from his mouth, then his cock, then his ass, which takes forever.  He can feel them leaving, one after the other, but he’d had no idea how many Cas has shoved in there.  He moans as they continue to slide out, one after the other.
There are more tentacles than he can count, or cares to, now.  They’re plucking at his skin, examining with slow presses of the tiny tips and the thickness further down.  They’re on his dick, now, and he’s so close.
It had been fine when the kid had walked him through.  Not a peep.  Maybe the ghost liked the kid.  Sure as fuck didn’t like Dean, though.
The kiss Dean presses into the hollow of his hip is drawn out, grounding.  More affection than seduction.
Dean sits next to her.  He nods a few times, unable to speak for a long moment.  He swallows.  “Guess you have a lot of practice with Dorothy, huh?” he finally manages, hoping she’ll take the conversation in a new direction.
Dean nods.  Swallows.  Looks out the window to what is proving to be an offensively nice day.  “Yeah, I know, Cas.  I’m sorry.  This just has me…
Cas swallows.  His voice is low and harsh when he answers.  “Well, I mean.  I do.  It sounds like an important skill.”
Dean points at Cas and they laugh.  “Guess I’ll just have to keep bringing them by for you sometimes.  Wouldn’t want you to waste away,” he jokes, immediately regretting his word choice.  “I didn’t mean—”
Time stretches, impossibly long as Cas continues to touch him.  He’s completely unpredictable, moving fast and then slow, stroking Dean’s thighs and then his balls, his cock, his stomach.  Dean’s skin is on fire, he jumps with every new contact, pressure building slow and warm as Cas works him over with infinite patience.  At some point, he sits up, wedging himself between Dean’s legs so he can use both hands to alternate firm and soft strokes.  He works tirelessly, tugging and pressing and bringing Dean close but never over until Dean’s speechless, can barely think, until he’s begging.
Castiel had said they’d meet Dean, but there was always the chance that they’ve come to their senses.  After ten years, after paying for his ticket, after saying over and over that they want to see him in person…
He does what he can, his eyes drifting closed.  “Okay, yeah.  I’d pull him closer then, feel the heat of his body and his mouth, wouldn’t need anything more, just his weight in my arms, his broad chest, maybe he’d move closer, press me back against the wall, show me he was into it, too.  Wanted me like I want him.”
Dean laughs.  “But Ellen taught me better.  Nothing like that at the Roadhouse.  And she really cares, you know?  She fed Sammy and me a lot when we were—”  He stops abruptly.  “Sorry, man.  I just keep talking, huh?”
Dean wants to go for a reassuring shoulder slap, and just barely keeps from making an absolute idiot of himself.  “I gotta run, buddy, I’ll stop by tonight and touch base, see what you think of these families before I bring them by, okay?”
Dean waves it off.  “No, I know.  I was just messing with you.  Hey, I appreciate it.  If anyone needs a boot in his ass to keep growing, it’s probably me.  Maybe you’re supposed to be my guardian angel, huh?  Help me get unstuck?  Maybe
“I look forward to it, Dean,” Cas tells him, and Dean tries not to grin like a fool as he heads out the door.
“Hey, hey!  You can’t murder a guy for not appreciating your woodworking!  That’s maybe a little overkill, you know?”
“She does appear to be for real,” Cas tells him seriously.  “She has some degree of control over...whatever I am, or wherever I am.”
“Hey, now, it’s not like that!  Just a friend with some skills to help walk me through it.  I promise I placed every piece.  What, you don’t believe I can manage a
it’s impolite to initiate physical contact with a Luminate, he’s studied the culture for over a decade.
Breathing Cas in, Dean kisses him, a gentle catch and release of mouth and lips.  He lets Cas come back to him, over and over, and it’s the best thing he’s ever felt in his life.   He could live just for this kiss, for kisses like these, forever.
Cas trails off and blinks out of view.  Dean spins around and finds him hovering over Gabe’s horrifying coffee, nose in the steam, huffing it like some sort of addict.
“He built both our computers, and he fixes and upgrades things around the house.  The TV.  The toaster.  We’ve got dimming switches in every room and he put some kind of miracle AI into the shower.  It’s heavenly.”
The house looks peaceful from here.  No bloody handprints on the windows, no weird faces peering out of the attic.
“Told him,” Dean says, biting off each word as he jacks Cas with single minded attention, “He should find out for himself.”
Dean chuckles and kisses his cheek, his jaw. “Holy shit is right.”  He presses their bodies together and slides his cheek against Cas’s. Finally, he whispers, “You just came so hard thinking about my brother, huh?”
Cas smiles, and he can feel himself blush.  This whole hardened criminal thing isn’t really settling on him very well, he thinks with a huff of a laugh.  “Me too,” he admits.
The ghost laughs harder.  “Oh, no.  I took a course in college.  The conjugations were challenging.  I really am benefiting now, though.”  He shakes his head.  “Nice try.  Really.  You’re very brave.”
He’s back to the mug, sniffing with that look of ecstatic joy.  If he were Dean’s type — which of course he isn’t, because Dean likes people with pulses, to start — but if he was, well this would probably get his attention.
“Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you said live it up, right?”  He runs through a million scenarios in his head, a million ways to say it, or lie and replace pronouns or otherwise edit this into something, and it’s insane because he’s been out for almost twenty years now, but it’s as terrifying as telling his family when he was fifteen and wanted to bring a boy home.
Dean makes a sound in his throat, assent and affront wound up together.  “Yeah, well, they’re not likely to.  Not unless someone decides to take down the Family Arena.”
.  I don’t even know what to think.  No idea how the kid found me.  Who else is coming behind him.”  He looks up, catches Cas’s eyes.  “This could get bad, you know.  Real bad.”
Sam nods.  “Yeah.  It’s been a long time.  You guys have a great thing going here.  I’ll be out of your hair in no time, no worries.  Sorry to, ah, drop in like this.”
Even if there are some people he’s not ready to see, yet.  He tries to reconcile the Mary and John he knew with the people who live up the road, and it just doesn’t quite fit.
She gives him a wide smile and he makes his way into the living room, a little nervous despite himself.  “Is she for real?” he asks under his breath.
Tentacles wind tight around his wrists and also around his calves and his knees and press him up, apart, exposing his ass to Cas’s curious gaze.
He pastes on an easy smile and pops the cap off the coffee, and when he looks up, Cas is sitting next to him with a wide, easy smile that makes his stomach flip.
“If we live, you can probably get it back,” Dean offers.  “As long as the tenants don’t destroy it.”
Cas seems to waffle a second, then, “Let me show you,” he says, clearly excited despite his earlier nonchalance.
Dean comes in from the other doorway to the kitchen and watches like a predator.  Cas had forgotten that he did that.
Cas feels his jaw clench at Dean’s tone and allows himself the arch of an eyebrow in annoyance, but nothing more.  It’s obvious Dean’s on edge, and confronting him about small things, no matter how irritating, isn’t going to improve the situation.
There’s an old black car in the garage where his Explorer usually is.  Dean must have swapped them sometime last night.  Cas finds the SUV parked in the driveway and drives to work in a daze.  There’s a fugitive of some sort in his house, stitched expertly together with dental floss and an upholstery needle.
Cas smiles slowly at the thought, and then he’s abruptly offline again when Dean’s mouth lands in the crease of his thigh and moves inexorably toward Cas’s cock, now fully at attention and aching.
She laughs softly.  “Oh, I think that’s my line, isn’t it?  You parking out in front of my house and all?”
Another shrug.  “It was a good life.  Not always easy, but mainly good.  We had a small garden the kids were in charge of—my brother Michael was the oldest, so he’d give us tasks when my father was at work.  But there was free time as well.”  He smiles and Dean can’t help but smile back.
Cas shrugs.  “There’s not much to tell,” he says quietly.  “I was born in 1897, third of five children.  My father was a writer.”
Cas folds up slowly, the light dimming and sliding back under the main bulk of his form.  He reaches out and Dean meets him, grasps his tentacles where they reach for him.
For once, Cas doesn’t threaten him as he comes through the door. Which is good, because he’s got a bag of tools in one hand and a bag of booze in the other and he doesn’t really want to ding the hardwood or break any bottles.
“I know,” Cas says flatly.  He doesn’t elaborate.  He doesn’t even know how to feel, he’s been on a roller coaster of elation and fear and planning and hoping and wondering - his life hasn’t been this up in the air since he moved to Ohio twenty years ago.
can make up for a guy being eternally stuck inside his old home, watching people leave him over and over.  “Sorry,” he says quickly.  “Stupid question.”
Dean raises an eyebrow, and Cas can feel the argument coming.  “Cas, c’mon.  You know I don’t like it, but it’s not up to me…”
As soon as he pulls it out the scent of vanilla, cinnamon and cardamom fill the air and Cas drifts close.  Dean keeps the cookie next to his coffee in hopes of keeping him there.
“I used to sneak out into the woods and build lean-to’s and shelters, pretend I was living off the land—the pioneer life was very romanticized at the time. We dreamed of the west, all the kids did.  Sometimes my sister Anna and I would play games—heroes and damsels, that sort of thing.  And we had to take turns because she hated that she wasn’t supposed to slay dragons.”  He smiles.  “Things were so different, then.”
“Here you are, now,” Rowena says, setting down a small plate and a cup of tea, and then sitting across from him with another cup, staring at him expectantly.
“Yeah, definitely.  It’s got that simple feel to it. And it’ll work well with the simple cut of the shelves.  Nice and simple, no frills.”
He steps into the kitchen and Dean kisses him quickly before heading back to the stove where three pots bubble.  “The saying is ‘Hi, honey, I’m home,’” Dean laughs.
Dean swipes his panel under the scanner for luggage and his pod is deposited with a thunk, ready to tether.  He sets it to sync with his panel, then has to try again when it fails.  He ignores the impatient huff behind him and the twisting in his stomach.
Cas laughs, the first time he’s really relaxed completely in Sam’s presence.  “I’m sure that’s up next,” he says, and steals some popcorn from Sam’s bowl.
At long last, he steps in and squeezes the breath right out of Cas’s lungs.  “Jesus Christ, Cas.  How on earth did you get so awesome?”
The way they touch him forces his hips to jerk forward, someone’s cupping his scrotum, someone’s got a tight grip at the base of his dick and those mouths, fuck, those hungry mouths are more than he can take, and then one of them slides down again, hot and perfect around him.  The gentle suction slides off, and there’s a shock of cold before the other’s mouth takes over and they take turns sucking him off in uniquely mind blowing ways, different pressure and shapes and techniques, different but equally as intense and he’s lost his rhythm, lost his mind.
It was easier then.  Before Cas broke it all open, scattered Dean’s dreams—those dreams he’d locked tightly away, bound behind the easy things, the fleeting pleasures—scattered and scrambled them irreparably.  Left Dean to clean up the mess.  Left Dean to rebuild himself alone.  Atom by atom.
Cas feels like he’s being torn apart.  Dean had been happy.  They’d been happy, and then Sam had come, and Cas had seen a new side of Dean. The one who watched his brother with hungry eyes, studied him like a wild animal.  Studied him like he might never see him again.  And Cas had liked that Dean, too.  That hungry, lean version.
Thanks for bearing with me, friends I know it's been a very long time.  I hope you enjoy this installment, and I hope to be more consistent going forward.  Not too much further to go!
“It’s so, so good to see you,” he says finally.  “Give me one minute…”  He fiddles with the machine.  It’s not something he can plug Common into and play Luminate back.  It requires knowing each of the words and meanings and structures, waveforms and color protocols.  But once he’s programmed it, he can recall previous iterations of the message.
He’s never been this bad at this.  Ever.  Dean Winchester has been charming humans for decades.  It shouldn’t be this hard.  “Thank you,” he says, looking over at Cas again, marvelling at his beautiful patterns and shapes.
He opens the door to find a stranger there - tall and pale and shivering and absolutely soaking wet.
Dean nods along.  “Yeah, I get it.  Okay.  So…”  He huffs out a breath, contemplating, trembling.  Finally, he asks.  “When we—yesterday, was I reading that wrong?  Did you…Cas, did you want to kiss me as bad I wanted to kiss you?”
Dean snaps his head up.  “What are you talking about?  You don’t need to, like, buy groceries to contribute.  You’re the…”
Dean lets Cas play with the buttons and snaps of his clothes, finds that Cas is a quick learner, stripping Dean down quickly and then looking him over with a million blue eyes.
Charlie sighs.  “Of course, of course.  I’ve got four queued up cause it seemed like...you know.  It might be that kind of night.”
Charlie throws herself at him the moment she gets the door open, and hugs him like he didn’t ghost her for almost a month.  “I’m so glad you made it,” she whispers gently, still clinging like a spider monkey.  It’s like she knows there’s something wrong.
“Yes, I am.  Is it easier, to hear me?  I know sometimes I speak very quickly in Luminate.  It can be difficult for your rods and cones to process.”
He’s still waiting for Cas in the morning, his stomach doing calisthenics while he mainlines coffee, when he sees Rowena walking down the stone walkway.  She hits the driveway and keeps coming, moving easily in heels that look like stilts.  She’s headed
“Yup, got it.  Oh, I think my signal—oh, I think I’m losing—Gabe?”  He hangs up the phone and ignores the return call.
Cas nods.  “I felt the car, the engine is very distinctive.  I was expecting you to come in.  I…”  His face drops suddenly.  “I hope I’m not keeping you.”
The tension drains out of Sam suddenly, and he laughs.  He presses a kiss into Dean’s neck almost too quickly for Cas to catch.  “Hey, I was careful, I promise.  I had to—I got croissants.”
“Cas?  Why are you accosting my boss’s coffee?”  Dean says, and he’s trying to stay annoyed, but the ghost looks just...ridiculous hunched over the way he is, eyes closed like he’s savoring some Michelin star meal or something.
Cas smiles, strained.  “I wouldn’t have thought so?  I thought I did it the right way—built a good life, a good family, a good home.  But...if that were true, why am I still here?  Why am
Then Sam speaks, voice quiet.  “You’re a better man than I’ll ever be.  I’d never take that from him.”
“Do you mean…” Cas’s colors are going wild, and Dean’s glad to know they’re both nervous.  “A kiss?”
Dean goes next, just as Sam is beginning to unclench, comes with a massive thrust of his hips, lets himself fall over Cas completely, holds himself up with one hand and gives Cas a first rate view of his hand and the arc of his come, over and over, striping sideways across Sam’s where it’s already cooling.  Cas doesn’t come, but he might as well have.  His body jerks with every fresh mark.  He groans and his breath stutters and God it feels amazing.
“Dean!”  Cas flickers into existence down the hall and walks toward him.  “It’s good to see you.  Rowena left some dinner in the refrigerator if you want it.  It smelled wonderful.”
Dean has no earthly reason to go back to the house after it's sold...but when has that ever stopped him?
“Wait, I’m sorry,” Dean says, watching the patterns change and move, each tentacle providing a different element of the conversation.  “You weren’t sure if I’d still feel…”  He looks up to meet Cas’s eyes and then scans across his body, distracted by the form.
“Look, you saved me already, okay?  Twice at least, and probably a bunch I don’t know about.  Right?”
Dean grins. “Yeah, wish I could take credit for that. It was all Cas, he asked about what you guys had around here, said she’d love it personalized, and man, he was right.”
Dean fishes for an answer.  Sam and Gabe know each other from high school, Dean can’t trust them not to compare notes. And Sam is notorious for his
But, sue him, he likes seeing Cas happy, and it’s such a small thing. It’s not like Dean’s attached or anything, it’s just that Cas is kind of cool and different and he knows a lot of weird stuff.
He watches as Dean pulls gauze from the kit, tears it open, soaks it in alcohol and then fills the floss container with alcohol, too.  He’s got a towel from the linen closet, and it’s going to be ruined with the blood, but it doesn’t phase him a bit.  He swipes it over the gash and Cas studies the wall art over the bed.
“Oh, Jesus Christ, fine.”  He collapses back down on the mattress and leaves Cas to it.  “I’m all yours,” he says, and it’s only after it’s out of his mouth that he realizes how true it is.  How true it’s been.
He watches her tail lights disappear and looks around once before stepping inside and shutting the door behind him.  “So weird,” he mutters.
Dean nods.  “You’re the expert, man.  I like it.  Hey, these are great pieces—nice and straight, no knots.  You sit her down for lessons?”
Dean grins, suddenly overjoyed.  “You’re such a nerd,” he says affectionately, and heads for the back of the property, Cas floating alongside him.
“Oh, gotcha.  So, that plumber that I had come in, that I paid out of pocket because I didn’t want your great-grandkid to think I was destroying the place, that was because you got emotional?”
Sam is different than Dean was when they first met, but it’s easy to see they’re cut from the same cloth.  Sam is sincere where Dean deflected, and sad where Dean was angry.  But underneath it, Cas can see that Sam thinks he’s worthless, just like Dean did, and Cas longs to prove him wrong.
When Cas looks up, Sam’s mouth is twisted, nostrils flared.  “You both are idiots,” he says flatly, and Cas thinks the conversation is done.
“I’ll tell you. Keep going.  Show me what you’ve learned.”  Dean can barely breathe as a tentacle slides across his balls, cinches around them and pulses gently.
“Thank you.  I know you have work in the morning, Dean.  I don’t want to keep you.”  He looks over quickly, blue eyes shining, full of some emotion that’s too big for Dean to name.
Dean swipes a hand over Cas’s stomach to smooth the come over his skin.  Cas tries not to give away how hot that makes him.
“I...I’ve wanted to,” he admits.  “I mean, I felt bad accepting—before, when we talked about it, I was going to get a post near Centauri so I was closer.  But I just...I couldn’t give up the chance to meet you.”  He glances over and Cas is open and interested, happy.  “It’s kind of like...I’ve been waiting my whole life, you know?”
“C’mon,” Dean says, pulling at Cas’s pants.  “Get your pj’s on and climb in for real.  We’re looking to get up at 6, swap plates at the Gas n’ Sip and then get on the road.”
His smile feels a little strained when he looks over at Cas, who’s watching him and not looking at the cups in utter disgust, so that’s something.
“Indeed you cannot,” she agrees with a small smile. She claps her hands once.  “All right, boys, you’ve convinced me. Well done. Where do I sign?”
“Oh, God,” he murmurs as Cas pulls him out carefully.  Dean slides a hand to Cas’s back, rubbing as Cas touches him.
“Cas?” Dean asks quietly.  He steps forward.  It’s just a dream, but he still wants it.  Still wants this moment, whatever he can steal before his mind brings him somewhere else.  He takes another step and Cas’s coat whips forward and snaps against his leg.
Sam laughs and smacks Dean on the arm; Dean laughs, too, the kind that crinkles his eyes.  He holds up a bite of bacon; Sam takes the entire thing in his mouth, all the way to Dean’s first knuckle, and Cas watches Dean press his finger into his brother’s mouth further, gaze intense and hot, everything slow-motion, and there is no mistaking that expression.  Then the world winds up again, sounds filter back in, and Dean catches sight of Cas.
Dean leans in, down, fits his lips against Cas’s and holds his face like the delicate, precious thing it is.  His throat tightens, clogs, his breath comes rough, he sobs.  Closing his eyes, Dean drags in air like he might drown here.  Happily.
Dean looks around again and there’s an odd sheen to the human he’s looked past twice in his search for Cas.
Cas shakes his head.  “I know Dean very well, Sam.  I know he’s not a bad person.  I don’t think you are, either.  Look, I can’t say if you’re good guys, but I know you’re not bad. I know you don’t want to hurt innocent people.”
And it’s stupid to lose it now, but he’s distracted.  He’s thinking maybe he’s been put back together wrong. Maybe he left his soul back there in that room.  Maybe the Empty took it, along with Death.  Along with Cas.
“I’m sorry, Dean, I didn’t realize it was you or I wouldn’t have yelled.  This...whatever you brought smells truly divine.  My granddaughter used to make a latte with spices in it, it was very similar to this.  It’s wonderful, it reminds me of those happy times, when Alfie was small and the house was full of laughter.”
“Oh,” Dean breathes.  Cas grins at him and licks his fingers, a visual that jolts through Dean’s whole body.  “You.  You’re a sex god.  How?  When did this happen?”
A bed rises from the floor, simple and white, framed in something that looks like Terran wood.  There’s a pole of the same wood at each corner, and when Dean leans over to press into the bed with the hand Cas isn’t hanging onto,  it’s incredibly soft.
Cas opens his mouth slightly, waits for Sam to come back.  He steals a glance over to where Dean watches them, rapt.
He wakes up late, and by the time Jesse drops him off at his car, his choices are to shower and change his clothes or drop by and see Cas on his way to work.
Rowena grins her conniving piranha grin again.  “See you tomorrow then, love.  I’m going to head upstairs myself, I’m just bushed.  Lock the door behind you if you would?”
Cas tries not to think what it means, the way Sam looks at him, pleading and sad.  The way it twists in his stomach, the way he has to force himself not to step close.
It feels like a breakup.  He can’t eat, he can’t sleep.  He does finally call Jesse when he knows he’s at work.  A shitty out, he knows, but it’s better than nothing.  Thanks him for the outing but something came up.
Dean strokes him slowly, pulling him back in. “Yeah, he wanted me to tell him what it was like to be with you. Fuck you.  Have you inside me.”
It’s been a long day, apparently, and Dean finds it hard to stay awake as he watches Cas react to the the heightening mystery, the attack on the ship, Mr. Spock saving the day...  The reveal of Voyager 6 makes Cas gasp.
“I ah, I don’t blame you for feeling the way you do.  Disgusted or whatever.  We’re all a product of our upbringing, right?  But you were a really good friend and I don’t hold it against you or anything.  I really...I know you’re—you were—you
“Yeah, Cas.  Definitely,”  Dean tells him, heating up from the inside.  This is better than he’s dreamed, and he’s, well, he’s dreamed this a
“A black and bleu burger for me,” he starts, then blushes at the slip.  “I mean, for tonight.  There’s this steak I got for tomorrow.  You might, ah, like it, though.”  He cracks open the container and can’t help the joy that fills him when Cas closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
“Shhh, the movie’s starting,” she says, taking his hand.  Something unknots inside him and he has to take another big breath to keep it from lodging in his throat.  He hadn’t realized just how tense he’d been, how much he’d dreaded her wrath, feared her disdain.  He pulls her close and kisses the top of her head.
“Dean!”  Cas’s smile is wide and welcoming, and Dean grins back, ignoring that feeling in his stomach.
Dean smiles weakly, still reeling inside.  “Yes, thank you.”  He tries to remember why he's there in the first place.  Finally, he says, “I’ll, ah, be back tomorrow to finish up sealing the shelves, and we can probably mount them Friday if that works?”
“Yeah.”  Dean takes a bite of his burger and moans, distracted.  “Oh my god,” he mutters, mouth full.  “Heaven.”   He curses himself again, fights to swallow so he can apologize for his afterlife reference.
And now...Cas doesn’t even know how to start picking up the pieces.  They’d had something beautiful here.  Something simple and pure and full of love.  It had been tested early on but here they’d been in this life they’d built, with the white picket fence Dean had picked out and put up in some sort of fit of spite, and Cas hadn’t understood, exactly, but he’d known it was another way for Dean to step into the light.
Dean nods.  “I hope so.”  He looks up, hesitant.  “Cas.  You know I didn’t make them for her, right?”
“Well then, I’m sure they won’t find anything that needs restoring.  Maybe you can help keep it that way, you know?”
It takes a moment for Cas to process it, and he feels the expected flicker of jealousy, but also an intense flare over his skin.
Cas doesn’t know what to say, but then Dean comes in with snack food and seltzer and collapses down next to his brother.
When he gets to the door something in Dean’s gut roils around, same as when he’s at the custom’s place, looking at old parts for Baby, or the anticipation of an early morning on the water in the fall, fishing for trout, or when he finds that one person at Gabe’s stupid mixers who’s a shameless Zep fan.
“Why don’t you slip into something more comfortable?” Dean tells Cas archly as he leans back, body pressed against his brother’s with absolute ease.
“I do,” Cas murmurs into his ear, shifting so he’s leaning over Dean, sliding a hand into his pants.  “I’ve been thinking about this for so long.  I want to hear the noises you make when I pleasure you.”
Dean sighs and relaxes minutely.  Cas watching his fists tighten and then loosen in Sam’s shirt.  “Jesus.  It’s like you know me.”
”  His come falls, hot like a brand on Cas’s skin.  They both groan as it lands and Cas bucks up to meet each spurt.  He’s euphoric with the sensation, the animal noises, the primal feeling that rises in him.
Dean watches Cas sniff it, going fuzzy like he does with the coffee — maybe it’s something about the concentration of it, or the sweetness.
Cas shrugs.  “I think…”  He hesitates and looks around the room.  “The only thing that scares me more than losing Dean is watching him lose himself.”  He sits gingerly on the edge of the bed, as far from Sam as he can manage while still sitting on the same piece of furniture.  “It’s not easy.  But...I can’t tell him how to live his life.  We learned that a long time ago.  His choices are his.  We listen to each other, of course. But it’s important to have...autonomy.”
Dean starts but doesn’t bother to chastise the ghost.  “Well, I hope so.  She just...am I gonna lose a hand if I go in the wrong door?  Did she, like, magic them or something?”
“If you don’t have other plans.  She mentioned that it might be something we could watch after you were done with the shelves.”
One more after this, they had to do some feeling processing before we get to the epic and sexy conclusion I know we've all been waiting for...  :)
Sam laughs and rubs his face.  He takes a deep breath.  “I mean, I don’t know if we know how to do it any other way.”  He laughs softly.  “If we’re talking we’re fighting.  But we care about each other.”
Sam.  Cas has heard that name before.  Not recently.  Not since Dean stopped drinking.  But it’s the one name that used to come up over and over, and Dean was never less than completely wrecked by it.
Tell me,” Cas says, moving slowly between his thighs.  “You must tell me if you need something more, if I cause you any pain.”
How in the galaxy can it feel so natural for Dean to be here, touching Cas, in a port two systems from his own, when he’s never been off Terra 3 before in his life?  It’s unreal.
This is a huge and potentially difficult chapter. I actually cried writing the end of it.  But I promise, it's all uphill from here.
.  He’d set him up with meals in color coded boxes, clear broth in a hot thermos, cold water in a cold thermos, and enough blankets to smother Cas to death.
“Thank you, dearie.  I’m off to visit some friends this weekend, but I don’t want the house empty, and I just planted a willow in the yard that needs attention.  I don’t suppose you’d be free to look after the place for me?”  Dean’s brain stalls as she continues.  “Of course you can go about your usual things, I won’t keep you captive.  It’s just to discourage people from snooping, you understand.”
“Yeah,” Sam says.  He shrugs and looks away, out the window.  “Died.  Murdered.  Guess the end result was the same.”
Cas kisses him, long and deep, then flops over to snuggle into his side.  Dean is dry and covered with a blanket suddenly, and only then does he remember it’s a dream.
Cas sort of freezes, glitches, and then he’s back with a smile.  “Oh, a date.  That’s great, Dean.  I’m happy for you.  You should, ah, tell me about it.”
Cas brightens.  Literally, fills the entire dwelling with bright blue light.  “I’ve studied your anatomy.  Your skin is very sensitive.  In my studies I learned several types of stimulation that might be very pleasant for you.  I would...I would like to try some of them.  I would like to give you pleasure, Dean.”
“Hmmm?” Cas manages.  He folds into one of the chairs at the table and notes how easily Sam is moving around the house, now.
“I may not have done much cooking, but I do know what a long day feels like,” Cas tells him, voice tinged in amusement.
and God, he feels like an asshole.  He ignores calls and texts from Charlie.  He goes to work and does the bare minimum, and Gabe sends him home early the second day.
Dean feels a thrill go up his spine.  A Luminate’s Grace is intensely personal.  It’s uniquely theirs.  Sharing it is how they have children together, it’s how they form romantic bonds.  Dean can’t trade Grace with Cas, but he knows that the offer means a lot more than Dean being naked.
“That was more of an emotional reaction, I think.  I don’t control it, and so I can’t really use it to repair issues and suchlike.”
I am so, so appreciative of all the lovely comments I got on the last chapter.  I will respond to each one, I'm just in a weird spot mentally at the moment.  BUT, each one is precious to me, so thank you!!
Dean grins before he can stop it.  “Right, right.  Funny guy.  I’m just...I’m building a dollhouse for my niece’s birthday, and I thought it would be cool to add some period touches.  You know?  I just...I mean, I built a birdhouse in high school.  Can’t be too hard.  Just been a while, is all.”
The anticipation feels like it might kill him all on it’s own.  He gasps, shallow little breaths that get pushed back out with every new sensation.
“You find me attractive?” Cas asks.  Dean can see that he’s flirting in the way his tentacles blink pink at the ends.
If it had been Sam — any of his friends, really — he’d have teased them mercilessly for being such a sap.
On day three, Dean stops by with a white chocolate latte, Cas’s favorite so far.  He takes the top off the cup and sets it under the tree he thinks of as theirs.  He’s planned things to say, but it’s hard to say them, so he just rambles quietly under his breath.  “I don’t know what they told you about people like me,” he starts out slowly, speaking low into the early morning light.  “Maybe that we’re broken or deviant or that...we hurt people.  And I don’t expect you to change your mind, you know?  I mean, can’t teach a dead dog new tricks, right?” He lets out one tiny whisper of a laugh and then chokes on it.
Cas reels him in by the back of the neck, pulls him close so their bodies align and it’s almost too much—a drought ending monsoon.
Sam shakes his head, eyebrows raised in disbelief. “I mean, you absolutely outdid yourself,” he admits. “And you
Hey,” he fights for words between tastes of Cas’s mouth, whispers against his skin, his lips, his cheek, “are you okay, is this okay?”
“Well, they sound delightful,” Rowena says with a demure tip of her head.  “Perhaps I’ll have one after you and Cas enjoy a few, hmm?”
“Fuck, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  He’s fucking huge but I got him so worked up, babe, he could barely talk—“  He speeds up, jerking Cas in earnest, and Cas is listening but can’t ask, can’t respond, can’t beg to hear how Sam’s mouth tastes.
.  You’re my best friend, my…” he hesitates to say it in Common, in case Cas meant it differently, in case Dean’s understanding is flawed.
Cas laughs.  “Ask Dean, he’s good with those things.  Last time he fixed it, we got thirty new channels.”
Cas glances up and Dean can tell that the coffee has done it’s job — there’s no trademark eyebrow raise to indicate that Dean has said something ridiculous.
to, you have to know…  But it’s a death sentence if he goes alone.  Azazel...you’ve never seen anything like him.  He’s about as evil as they come, Cas, and he’s gunning for my little brother.”  He looks up, eyes pleading.  “I don’t want to lose you, I just..I can’t let him go and pretend like I couldn’t have helped.”
Both of them move inexorably down his body and anticipation makes him jump, his limbs suddenly not under his control.  The brothers reach his hip bones at about the same time, tongues and teeth working there until he’s in a daze and can’t think beyond the feel of their mouths, the anticipation of what’s next.
Sam touches his face gently, traces his lips, his cheekbone.  “Okay,” he breathes, and brushes his mouth against Cas’s, electric and feather light.
“I can only go to the tree,” Cas says, nodding at the big oak that stands in the yard across the street.  “It used to be ours, but when the road got paved they moved things around.”
Cas goes red and Dean lifts his head to kiss him softly, wondering if he went too far.  “Only if you want to,” Dean reassures quietly.
Dean stands outside Charlie’s door for a good five minutes, staring at the eye of Sauron sticker around her peephole and trying not to crush the flowers he brought—a thoroughly inadequate apology.
It feesl like it goes on forever—the rutting, Sam’s face close enough to touch, his dick huge and impressive and getting more and more swollen with every second.
Dean lets his gaze trace the line of Cas’s sharp cheekbones, his lips before he leans in to kiss him, hoping it says all the things he struggles to put words to.  “Not gonna rush,” he whispers.  Cas pushes in hungrily.  “We have time, okay?”
“No, not yet,” Dean tells him.  He should have called, he knows he should have, but he hates not having good news.  “It can take time, but the house is in great shape, it’s just a matter of finding the right fit.”
He scrubs a hand through his hair and sighs when, at 8, he finds himself surrounded by a mess of dishes and muffins and high-end ingredients.  Every discarded pair of pants is thrown haphazardly over his mismatched kitchen chairs.
It’s awkward, the morning after their first kiss.  Dean stumbles through typically easy chatter and blushes every time Cas looks at him too long.  Luckily, Cas has the same problem.  They don’t talk about it, of course, but that kiss has been playing on prime time in Dean’s brain for the last twelve hours.
God, look at all this.  Look at you.  I mean, we never dreamed anything like this was possible, back when we were kids.  You, this, it’s everything we—he ever wanted.”
“Hey, did you ever…”  Dean doesn’t quite have the time to stop his mouth before it opens.  “Wow, nevermind.”  He laughs nervously.
When he finally remembers how to open his eyes, he looks down to find Sam and Dean kissing again, mouths wide and messy.  Dean’s hand sits intimately inside Cas’s thigh, and there’s come dripping from the corner of Sam’s mouth.
“You seem like you’re very good at it,” Cas says, taking a deep breath like he’s savoring an especially wonderful bite.
Sam smiles a crooked smile full of perfect teeth, his expression bashful, and Cas almost laughs with the normalcy of it.  The
, that neither Charlie or Sam would let him hear the end of this—hauling a half built dollhouse to a house he doesn’t own, to meet a dead guy he barely knows, at an hour he definitely wouldn't be going out otherwise.
“He pressed me against the fridge.  Kissed me, slow and hot - haven’t kissed him since he got so damn huge, kid’s got muscles like you, babe, built like a gladiator.”
“Cas!” he yells as he opens the door, shaking the inspector’s report in one hand.  “You want to explain this to me?”
He wracks his brain for a reason that’s vague enough not to inspire five million questions, then shakes his head.  It’s a lost cause with Charlie.  The girl is
“I hope you like ‘em.”  He stops himself from adding ‘ma’am’.  He’s a grown ass man, after all.  “Let me know if you’ve got favorites.  If I’m coming over a lot, I want to be able to give you
Cas is fascinating.  Dean’s always known that, but in person it’s more obvious.  He’s smart as a whip — he’s an engineer with a team that creates new technologies used across the galaxies.  He’s funny in a dry sort of way, and is always trying to do the right things, make a difference.
Cas shakes his head, the war of fear and absolute certainty making him light headed.  “I don’t believe this has been a lie.  The years we’ve spent together?  I know this is you, too, Dean.”
“What can I get you?” she finally asks, lightening the mood.  She heads for the little kitchen and opens the fridge.
“Yeah, sure,” Sam says, and it’s clear he has no idea what’s going on with Dean but he’s willing to let the explanation stand, and that’s fine because Dean also has no idea what’s going on with him.
A whine escapes Dean’s throat.  The words and the warmth of Cas’s breath make every hair on his body stand up.  The addition of Cas’s fingers, rooting around in his boxers, does the same to his cock.
Dean laughs.  “Cas, is that you?  Can I…?”  He reaches out for a hug, then draws back in embarrassment. The human-like form throws him off, but he
“Flattery will get you everywhere,” Dean jokes, standing up with a sigh.  “I’m ah, I’d better head out.  It’s getting late.”
“There you are, baby,” Dean says softly.  “I was trying to tell Sam it was okay if he kissed you. But the bitch doesn’t believe me.” His tone is affectionate.
Dean slings an arm around him as he gets up from checking the plug behind the nightstand.  “Ready to go?”
“Oh,” Cas says again, full of grey-blue wonder.  “I’m not...I’m not going too deep, am I?  I know your structure can…
It’s crazy.  Everything about this trip is crazy.  Everything about this routine and how easily they’ve settled into it is absolutely insane.
Dean flushes, his skin going warm.  He takes his dishes to the kitchen and washes them, taking a few deep breaths before heading back into the living room.
There’s a handprint on his jacket, now, flaking and dark. But the marks on his arms are all him.  The bruises of the next battle, because what else is there?
He’d been expecting Cas to look the way he did on his ICEP ID - a blue tinged and glowing form of tentacles and feathers and tiny blue eyes in delicate formations along the main body mass.  That, Cas had told him, was the form that was most natural for him when he was material.
And his heart breaks when he realizes it's just like it used to be, when Dean could only say ‘I love you’ by hanging on too tight.
“We have two days, and I’m here whether you can touch me or not.  It’s enough.  It’s more than I ever thought I’d have.”  He stretches a hand between them.  “Talk to me.  Tell me about your week.  Your life.  Tell me what you’re afraid of.  Tell me everything.”
Dean stumbles in and mumbles under his breath, looks almost himself if Cas ignores the bags under his eyes.
“Did you like it?” Cas asks as Dean strokes him, and he’s trying to listen but it’s so hard when Dean touches him like that.
, so Dean isn’t going to struggle to convince the guy — it’s what comes after that he’s not too sure about.  Gabe likes the quick turnaround, he’s not a big fan of fiddly negotiations.  His solution would be something along the lines of ‘burn it down and collect the insurance money.’  Or, in this case, ‘give the keys back and wish the kid luck with another agent.’
But this is an undeniable truth.  That Cas feels it, too.  There’s still a lot to learn, a lot to grow into, but
He rolls his eyes and smiles despite himself as they all watch the kids chasing each other around the folding tables. “I guess it has been a while,” he admits.
Sam laughs, and Cas can’t tell if the hollowness is in Sam’s voice or just the ringing in his ears.  “Well,” Sam retorts, “I’m growing back a significant chunk of my abdomen.”
“Oh.  Hello,” Cas says, stepping into the kitchen to find the giant - Sam - wearing his sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt.
Cas catches his arm.  He holds him, fingers solid and strong around his wrist, and he’s warm, and real and he feels amazing, and Dean is completely overcome by that contact alone.
“Right, of course,” and he’d known, of course, that Cas had had a family, but the name, Hannah, hits differently.  Made it real, somehow.  Cas had been part of a family, a married man, a father, and now...what was he?  All he had was this house, the last piece of his life, his family, and Dean is suddenly hit with how lonely it must be here, with everyone dead or moved on.
It’s the same way he is with Cas when he’s sick.  When he’d had the flu the previous fall, Dean hadn’t stopped griping at him the whole time, but wouldn’t let Cas do a thing for himself for
“She died when you were a baby?”  Dean had been vague about timelines and details, but Cas is piecing it together, now.
Dean yanks the door to his apartment closed and performs the daily battle with the lock.  Humid days are the worst - the door gets swollen and he’s never sure if one day the door jamb is going to win. As it is, he hasn’t been able to throw the bolt for two months.
Charlie gets reservations for two weeks and it’s just as well, because Dean is busy working with lawyers and getting all the paperwork set for Cas’s house.
“That we’re…”  Sam grimaces and scrubs his face with his hand in a familiar gesture, and Cas smiles briefly.   “We’re not the good guys, here.”
When he goes to grab the tung oil sealer from the bag in the guest room, he finds two DVDs — 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and 'Star Wars: A New Hope'.  He laughs and holds them up.  “Cas, what is this?”
“For the house.  I'm gonna find a good fit for you.  You deserve that, after building it from the ground up, having your family here—your wife and your kids, your grandkids.  That’s really amazing, and I just want you to know—I’m gonna make sure you get a good fit.”
Her face goes shuttered for a moment, and the look when she meets Dean’s eyes is...chilling, honestly.  “I did.  My son passed a few years ago.  But even so, I think the house will find me a good fit.”
“Wonderful, what a stroke of luck this is!  Here, have a key,” she plucks one from a dish on the island, “and feel free to stick around, I won’t be in til quite late, I’m afraid.”
Synced up, the bag follows him through the port and he makes his way to the 600 nm gate (a shade of yellow he has to double check with his panel) and out into the bustle of the EMspheres, where they slow for passengers and then speed away along the track.
The way Cas moves—slow and deliberate and curious—disarms him completely.  No one has ever examined him like this.  Tested his reactions, explored his body.  Cas is in no rush and has no shame, he rubs Dean’s shaft with two fingers, varying the pressure until Dean arches against it, then uses a loose fist.  Tightens it down until Dean gasps.  He holds Dean’s balls gently, stroking them with his thumb, and Dean wonders if Cas used to do this to himself.  If he used to imagine doing this with someone.  If it’s odd to finally be touching a man after being brainwashed his whole life.
Cas grabs the covers on either side of him and tries not go completely airborne as they work together, one finally moving up to take his cock in their mouth, working their tongue underneath and Jesus fucking
They sit quietly together having coffee, and it feels like something Dean could do every single day of his life, and it would never get old.
Bobby laughs.  “She’s given up makin’ pies and now Ellen’s taken her into the hills, teaching her to shoot.”  He looks happier than Dean’s ever known him.
He turns the car around, finally, and makes his way back to the deceptively peaceful house.  He parks in the driveway, and takes many deep breaths.  “You’ve got this,” he repeats softly.
It had been like this for a while when they first met - gruff, short sentences.  Shadowed eyes and that gorgeous jaw always clamped a little too tight.
His voice is barely a whisper.  “I’d kiss him slow to start, no tongue.  Just that soft way you explore someone’s lips, getting a feel for what he likes, you know.  I might...I might hold the back of his neck.  Not tight, just set my hand there.”
Sam shakes his head.  “Us. Right. He’s not the only one.  This is honestly...I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.  How are you okay with it?”
“No, no.  Nothing like that.  Just work, like I said.  Tell you what?  Let’s go grab that steak with Charlie, huh?  Nothing serious, just, get out of the house.  Promise I’ll be better company, okay?”
“Yeah, right. I get it, it’s no problem. Hey, one of my mom’s friends wants me to show it to her. Do you need to be there?  She wants to go tomorrow afternoon. I don’t have classes so probably around three?”
Cas smiles crookedly and heads to the bedroom.  Everything inside him is uneasy, off kilter.  He knows Dean loves him.  He’s never doubted it.  But Sam has changed something.  Sam has changed
He pauses.  Holds up a finger.  “Wait, let me get more coffee.  Do you have a list of players?  I can probably get some information on the political climate without arousing suspicion, I’m constantly researching policies and state government structures for work.”
It doesn’t mean anything.  A guy’s allowed to order out and bring food home.  Since he’s already made plans to stop by to see Cas, it just makes sense.  He’ll be getting home late and won’t have much time to cook.
“Yeah, yeah.  Well, you’ve got enough to keep track of at work, Mr. City Manager.  I’ll keep track of the potlucks if you take care of the rest of the city.”
Cas goes hot.  He wouldn’t ask for it.  Not with something so new.  But now that Dean has put the idea in his head, he has to have it.  His dick tries valiantly to rally.
The look of gratitude on Cas’s face is pure. A little heartrending. Noone’s done anything decent for the guy in too long.
The brackets go up easily, and then Dean takes the boards to the backyard.  The faces are already smooth and they’re cut to size, but Dean sands the cut edges and wipes them down.
Jesus, are you kidding, you fucker?  Last time you didn’t even give me a chance…”  He tries to be furious, but it’s hard to hold onto.  There’s nothing here to be angry about.
“Whoever you are,” he warns loudly, brandishing the tire iron like his pounding heart isn’t about to vacate his chest.  “I’m not afraid of you.”
Cas shines yellow-white and then tinges pink again, and then moves back into his typical blues, as Dean squeezes his tentacle gently.
“Oh, yes.”  She touches his arm, fixing him with a strangely motherly gaze.  “You’re lurking, dear.  You look very questionable out there in that ridiculous muscle car.  You need to park in the driveway like an actual guest.  You and Cas can have coffee in the living room in the morning.  I’m generally out in the garden til at least ten in any case.  You won't even know I'm here!” She gives him two quick pats to the shoulder and then gives him a disconcertingly wide smile.  “Now, don't keep Cas waiting.  And lock up when you go, won’t you?  Ta!”  She breezes past him toward the garage.
Dean tries not to fidget.  “What do you think?” he finally asks.  Dean knew what to expect—Cas in the holos is very much Cas as Dean has been seeing him.  But Dean has never sent nudes.  He sort of wonders, now, if that was a mistake.
He feels like he missed that opportunity, now, but he fumbles out the waveform creator he’d made when he and Cas had first talked about meeting—the one he’d programmed with a message in the Luminate language.
Dean let’s himself in at 7:09.  “Hey, Cas,” he calls, setting down his duffel bag of hastily gathered tools.
.  He’s hurt, and he’s sweet, and he’s scared, and he’s putting on a brave face that is fooling no one.
“Leaving.  Leaving without…”  He shakes his head and turns back to the door, heads inside and goes straight for the bathroom.  Cas hears the lock twist.
Dean’s breath shudders out of him, full of some repressed emotion, and Cas is ready to hear a story of star crossed lovers, some wrong side of the tracks story, but what Dean says is:
“Was that...okay?” Dean laughs softly.  “Oh my God.  That was, hands down, the best sex I’ve ever had in my life.  I can’t…”  He lies back for a long moment.  “Can you--is it good for you if you come here and sort of...lie down with me?”
“I hope you boys are decent,” Rowena croons, taking her time in the hallway before finally making her way into the living room.  She smiles at them, broad and sharp.  “Ah, you got the movies, wonderful.  I wasn’t sure which you meant when Cas brought it up, and I thought, who better to show him than you, Dean.  I trust you had a good evening?”
She leads them through the rest of the house, asks if the wide planks in the master bedroom are original and Dean smiles, recalling Cas’s tale of his hopeful wife and her two brothers taking an old bus up north to pick up the raw wood. He couldn’t say no after that, apparently, so he put in another month of evenings and weekends to finish the boards and install them.
on Rowena’s huge TV, and it’s just as awe inspiring as it was the first time Dean saw it.  He has half an eye on the windows the entire time, half an eye on the clock.
It’s his fault, of course.  Being distracted.  Not being able to put himself back together.  Not being able to be satisfied with pie and burgers and other people’s credit cards.  Thinking too much when he should have been fighting.
So when the lights fade into the soft green indicating it’s time for the passengers to clip in, Dean moves hastily to the cabin and seals into his six point harness for landing.
“Look,” Jesse says quietly.  “It’s probably too soon, but I’m just gonna say it.  Do you want to come back to my place?  I had a good time tonight.  I wouldn’t mind if it kept going.”
It’s unreal, watching them, Dean pressing against Sam’s ass, pushing him forward into Dean’s hand, Sam breathing hard and ragged, sometimes dipping low enough that the wet head of his cock touches Cas’s stomach, and they suck in a collective breath with the sensation of it.
Dean’s face is suddenly drawn.  Sick.  Sallow.  “Guess it runs in the family, huh?”  He’s got a death grip on Cas’s hand.
Cas knows he’s stumbled into something intensely private.  Something he has no right to be eavesdropping on.  He takes a breath and strides into the kitchen, grabbing a cup and pressing it against the dispenser on the fridge door before he turns toward the brothers.
He stands in the hallway, processing, and then he smiles, remembering the food.  “Oh, hey, I’ll be right back.”
He doesn’t want to give up, but this is Cas’s place. He takes a deep breath. “I won’t come back.  I know it’s uncomfortable, probably, for me to be here.  I just...I wanted you to know that.  Okay?”  He looks around, and he’s sort of hoping Cas will appear and apologize or explain or even be angry, but of course he doesn’t.  “Okay, then.  Guess...guess this is good-bye.”
It makes it hard to breathe, all this attention.  There’s not an inch of his body that isn’t sparks and electricity.  Dean’s hand has abandoned Cas’s and is now inching down his ribs, and if this follows previous experience, that hand is going to be sliding over his cock soon.
“Yeah, Cas,” he finally says.  “Me too.”  The tears are falling, now, over his face and down the lines of his throat. “Me too.”  He slides across the seat, sitting as close as he can without accidentally ending up in the ghost, and wishes more than anything in the world that it was ninety years ago and he could hold Cas’s hand.
, it seemed more real than the world.  Bigger.  Brighter.  I had to look away, it was so vibrant and crisp.  It was too much.”
“She said you’re hurting her reputation with the neighbors by ‘lurking.’”  His fingers curl around the last word and Dean grins.
Cas smiles at Dean and takes a few sips before sneaking a glance over the edge of the mug.  Dean sits beside him, Sam at the foot of the bed.  It feels good.  Comfortable.   “Did you have a good night?”
“Oh,” Cas says quietly.  His eyes blink away as Dean strokes him, then pop back into being.  “That feels very...nice,” he says.
Sam laughs it off and pulls his hand away, and when Cas looks up Dean is standing in the doorway with a look on his face that is impossible to decipher.
Dean sighs and moves into the living room, taking a seat on the couch gingerly.  Obviously a different approach is needed, here.
Cas sits next to him as he eats and Dean pushes some of the pie to the side so Cas can enjoy the delicious steam.  He starts the movie and Cas watches, rapt.
the world grinding to a halt.  He looks over his shoulder and Dean is still, almost as pale as the man who just fell into Cas’s arms, looking like he’s trying to drag air in and not having much success.
Dean tells Cas he had a date with a guy and Cas disappears, and Dean assumes it's because he's homophobic.
Dean grins.  Nerdy little dude.  He loves it.  “Yeah, makes sense, let me see…”  He knocking on the wall to look for a stud when Cas sets a translucent finger in front of him.
“He’s always felt responsible, Cas.  Danger of being a big brother, I guess.  You both worry way too much.”
“Yes of course.”  Cas winds the tip of his tentacle around Dean’s fingers, pulsing gently, and pulls Dean just a few meters away.  “I didn’t wish to make assumptions, but I did want you to be comfortable here, so I had this brought just in case,” he says.  “There are also human accommodations in the lower layer, if you prefer them.”
And he’s thought it before, in weak moments— that he loves Cas, that maybe they could be happy together, given half a chance.  But he’s avoided expectations up til now, he never wanted to open himself up to that world of hurt.
Cas feels like a character in one of Dean’s cowboy films, like he’s the assistant to the gruff but capable doctor.
Cas chews his lip.  The words escape before he has time to rephrase, to soften it.  “You want to be with him.” It’s not a question.
“Deal,” Cas laughs as he heads into the bedroom, shedding his suit pants and pulling on sweats.  “I’ll be back soon,” he calls out, heading for the three season porch in the back.
Dean thinks it through, can’t find a way Sam can pick that apart. “Yeah. So I could show him the pieces and stuff.”
Dean grimaces.  “That's never good,” he says, but there’s no bite to it. It’s more...resigned.  "What’s up?”
was the soft one.”  He starts to laugh but chokes on it and grabs just above his thigh.  Cas hopes he doesn’t bleed through the dressing.  He really likes those sweatpants.
Cas’s mind spins over too little information, moments, names, the questions that used to make Dean clam up and shake his head.
Cas tries not to think too hard about that look as he fishes the first aid kit out from under the sink.  That look of deep regret. Longing. Sorrow.
Cas’s fingers fiddle with the buttons of Dean’s shirt, his body pressed along Dean’s in a way that feels completely natural.
Dean pulls up the driveway and slides the new files between the cups, balances the tray in one hand and unlocks the box to get the key with the other.
“Sammy,” Dean whispers, and then he hauls Sam’s head down abruptly until his mouth is against Sam’s ear.  “You better have a
“Said he’d missed it, told me I was real lucky.  Couldn’t shut up about how sweet, how perfect, how fucking hot you are. ‘S if I don’t know.”
Dean strokes over the tentacle in his hand in reassurance, getting a buzz of energy in acknowledgement.
Cas smiles.  “I’m glad you came,” he says, and Dean would put up a thousand shelves for a thousand manipulative homeowners just for that.
Dean feels a chill go through him.  He lowers his voice to the barest whisper.  “Are you okay?  Is she...is she like...a devil worshiper or something?”
He picks up the food from Oscar at the bar, managing to escape the third degree from Jo.  He leaves a good tip and then gets out of there before any of the nosy crew can catch sight of him.
She rolls her head up to catch his eye and quirk an eyebrow.  “You are not immune to the influence of the patriarchy, Dean.  By which I mostly mean, your dad.”
Anyway, he’s having fun. He hasn’t had a friend like Cas in a long time and it’s nice. Nothing wrong with that, enjoying someone’s company. He’s a ghost, for cryin’ out loud! It’s exciting!
Cas laughs.  “Well, he’s gotten better, there, thank goodness.  Unless we're driving somewhere," he amends.  "Which we don't get to do very much anymore.  But he'll say..."  He trails off, snorting laughter and adopting his best ‘Dean’ voice.  "Driver picks the music--"
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Cas,” Dean tells him firmly, and Cas gives him a tremulous smile and nods before he fades away.
Dean gets bad news from the home inspector, visits his brother on a special occasion, and gets a call from someone unexpected.
Circling the island to peer in the bags, Cas laughs.  “I will not.  It all looks delicious, Dean, thank you.  I wish I could contribute.”
It’s infuriating to feel like a storm is brewing and he has no control over it.  No control because they keep pretending it’s not happening — both of them, and it’s making him insane.  Their furiously quiet conversations stop as soon as Cas shows his face.  They keep pretending everything is fine and it’s absolutely clear that it isn’t.   It’s starting to feel like he’s the fugitive, here.  In his own home. In his own relationship.
Dean kisses him, a quick peck to the cheek.  “He was worried for us, Sammy.  Wanted to make sure we were okay first.  For a man who does what he wants...he’s slow.”
“I need you to believe me when I say it’s okay.  You don’t have to steal moments with him when I’m not around, you can just...be with him.  I want you to spend the night with him. Before everything else changes, too.  I want you to know that when you wake up, I’ll still be here.”
“Uh,” he continues.  “I got some honey bourbon, some Bookers, some Jack Daniels Sinatra — couldn’t really resist that,” he says, grabbing the set of tiny solo cups he’d picked up out of the bag.  He’s second guessing those.  Cas has got to be used to sipping out of fine crystal, right?
“I do.  It helps a lot, Dean.  You don’t have to be there to show that you care.”  She tips until her head is resting on his shoulder.  “You don’t want to talk about it, do you?”
Cas smiles and follows him up, then drifts out of the room when he changes his clothes. Dean wants to call him back in, but he doesn’t.  He’s been talking himself into being patient the last few days.  He won’t rush Cas.  This is too important.  “All right, man, I’m decent,” he calls when he’s done. He flips the light off and climbs under the covers as Cas floats in, and then Cas sits on the bed next to him, too close and way too far, perched there like he’s going to guard the room all night.
It really is. The house is stunning, and the main section, which has two additions, now, is solidly constructed - post and beam, and the headers are still visible in the kitchen.  It’s one of the features he’ll highlight...
Dean nods once.  “I would.  Like.”  He opens the door and turns back once to see Cas staring after him.  “Goodnight, Cas.”
Dean sighs.  “He’s a friend, okay.  An online friend—no, not like that, Charlie.  Head outta the gutter.”
scream in my ear, please?” Dean manages, sliding the tray onto the kitchen island and turning back to grab a chair.
Cas laughs softly. “Yes, I suppose it is.  I just meant...Dean is having a hard time believing that I’m all right with…”  He gestures loosely at Sam, then encompasses the room.
Cas looks down at his hands.  Yet again, he’s not sure what to say. How to talk about something that's barely formed at the back of his mind.  “It’s not important, I’m sorry,” he finally says.  “We need to focus on keeping you safe.”
If Cas could articulate anything in the moment, he might try to say something smart.  As it is, he just managed some sort of high pitched cross between a grunt and a whine.
“ENTER NOT, THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING,” the voice comes, and Dean just manages not to take off again as he spins around to see the dark form again - now more of a terrifying man-shape in a trenchcoat.  Dean swings, hitting him right in the - no - right
and he’s been dead for a long time and why his opinion should matter anyway is completely beyond comprehension.
Dean jumps and spins, catching his camping chair with his foot and nearly sending it off the pier.  “Cas?  What…?”
.  Dean knows everything, and loves him anyway, and Cas is overcome with gratitude and comfort.  As much as absolutely everything has changed, this hasn’t.  Dean still knows him.  Loves him.  Does things just to make Cas happy.
From his perch next to Dean, Cas somehow talks him into telling the story about getting locked out of the house when he was 12 and taking the door off the hinges.  Then the one about Sam getting the flu so bad Dean skipped school for five days and almost got suspended.  That somehow leads into the time Ellen let him into the commercial kitchen and he ruined an entire day’s worth of bread by adding sugar instead of salt.
.  Like a tongue.  A wet, hungry tongue, lapping at his hole.  Dean is almost disappointed by how human it is, and then something whip thin penetrates, passage eased by the mess that’s been left behind.  Another joins it.  Thin, still, but strong, and they start moving inside him, careful and curious, pushing and prodding like tiny fingers up inside him, even as that wet tentacle keeps licking at him.
He wears a blue t-shirt with a new flannel—why mess with a classic, he finally decides.  And he contemplates a long while before shaving and throwing on a light cologne.  He looks good, or so people tell him, but it doesn’t hurt to show a guy you put some effort in.
“I’d start slow,” he says softly.  “I’d watch how he looked at me and then look him over, let him see where I’m going. You ever do that with someone, Cas?”  His voice cracks.  “Look them up and down, watch their face, see what they really want?”
And then it all begins in earnest.  What had started as an early morning distraction gets intense as Dean joins in, nibbling on Cas’s ear.
“So,” Dean says, busying himself with his bag of tools.  “Did you need me to stain or poly or something?”  He looks over the boards again.
Dean strikes the observation from his thoughts as Cas continues. “Tell me about Ellen.  You said she was a family friend?”
Cas smiles at the correction and feigns ignorance. “I hope so!” he says, loosening his tie and unbuttoning his shirt with one hand as he puts his briefcase in the closet with the other.
Castiel’s smile goes wide, nearly inhuman, and a blue glow shines behind his teeth.  His fingers pulse quickly, blue-purple in something pleased and vaguely...embarrassed.
Dean laughs, and Cas joins him.  “God damn,” Dean gives a huge, contented sigh, luxuriating for a moment in loose-limbed bliss.  Then he rolls over toward Cas and asks,  “Did Cosmo teach you how to get your dick sucked?  Cause that’s what I’m doing next.”  When he tries to lever himself up, his arms give out.  “In a minute, when my entire body stops feeling like goo.”
“Oh, I don’t think it’s really polite to invite myself for dinner.  Do you think?  I guess I have an extra meal.”  The idea of feeding Rowena irritates him, but he shoves it down.  It wasn’t like he had very specific plans for that steak, or anything.
He turns and ferrets out the paper bag and the newspaper that Sam dropped by the door, and grabs Cas’s hand as he heads for the kitchen and turns on the oven.
, he doesn’t say.  “Closing in two weeks.  That’s super fast, Alfie will have a check in hand before next semester, no problem.”
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas says.  He leaves the book and glasses on the bedside table closest to the door and turns to leave.
Cas knows he’s doing the right thing.  He knows he can trust Dean.  He knows that letting Dean and Sam be together is important.
Even expecting it, he jumps, then heaves a sigh. “Cas, c’mon! You know I have to sell this place, right?”
“Well, we’re off to a great start,” Dean assures him.  “I’m really…” he clears his throat to hide the lump that rises.  He can’t believe this is real; he can’t remember anyone ever doing anything like this for him before.  “Thank you so much.  It’s amazing.”
Something happens in Cas, something that threatens to be a sob, but is absolutely fury when it exits his body.  “We’ve been
Cas reaches out to curl a tentacle over his cheek, along his lip.  “I know,” he says.  “I can see that you’re sincere.  I think your Grace...it takes more time to show.  But if you want to show me, I want to see it.  I want to see you, Dean.  I’m glad you were able to see me.”
“I was think about five inches lower?  About two feet out on either side.  That way, Rowena can put taller pieces on the shelves and still have them work well with what she displays on the mantel.”
,” and he’s rocking back and forth as more tentacles slide across his skin, over his ass cheeks, his thigh, and then press inside him and pull him wider, that same broad tentacle swelling to fill him, push him, spread him open until he’s gasping.  “There,” he manages, “Like that, just that, just,
“Mmmm,” Cas grumps.  Then he opens his eyes a bit and sighs, rolling back and lifting his hips so Dean can pull his jeans off.  “Sorry.”
Dean shakes his head, huffing a laugh.  “Yeah, yeah, it is.  She’s gonna watch them with you?”  He ignores the disappointment that threatens.
Dean kisses his hip, one of the few places not currently covered in come, and then jumps off the bed before Cas can begin to articulate his feelings.
“Dean,” he says quietly, looking at the grain of the door.  He doesn’t even know what to say.  There’s so much he wants to know, and so little he has a right to.
He likes Jesse, he really does, and the guy knows what he’s doing, and Dean tells himself it’ll come together soon, it’ll all fall into place and he won’t keep thinking about a ghost while someone else has hold of his dick.
Intergalactic travel has come a long way in the last ten years, and he’d done training in zero grav back when he thought he might actually have a chance at getting a post off-world.  But he still hates the flying bits, where he’s just one mote of dust hurtling through the galaxy at lightspeed
Dean chuckles.  “Ah, Charles.”  He takes a sip to buy some time.  “Yeah, it’s Cas, but it’s not like that.  He’s just having a tough time and I don’t know how to help, you know.  From so far away.”  The feeling that’s been making him constantly queasy rises up again and he sets his beer down.
“Did you hear—did you know… “  He takes a deep breath.  “You think you can put up with me for a whole weekend?”
Cas reaches out to touch his arm, smooth over his bicep, and Dean catches his hand like a lifeline, holding so tight it hurts.
Sam looks up, his expression cautious.  “Yeah, we were.”  He shrugs self-consciously.  “Inseparable.”
“Nostalgia’s a weird word.  I just wanted to have a look at ‘em.  It’s no big deal, really.  I was just thinking about ‘em and how mom used to talk about him and stuff, and I guess...I just wanted to see.”
“Yeah, Cas.  Yeah, for sure.  So, I’d hold him against me, gentle, and I’d take my time, open my mouth, feel his breath, maybe his tongue—give him a chance to back off if he’s not into it.  It’s a first kiss.  I want him to feel good, excited.  I want him to want more.”  It’s like...like phone sex.  But a million times better.  He’s sporting a semi, desperate to hear Cas tell him what he’d do, what he’d want.
“I don’t like it, Sammy.  You’re one guy.  This is big.  This is really big and, man...I...I never thought I’d see you again.  I
“Really?  That would be amazing.  Honestly.  You’re a lifesaver.”  He grimaces.  “That came out wrong.”
Cas is looking down when Dean glances back over, and he suddenly feels like kind of a dick.  Way to overreact, there.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, earning another glare.  He turns back to watch the screen in silence, but Dean catches his small smile.
“Well, yeah, of course, Cas.  Like you said, you built this thing, that’s amazing!  I mean, look at me!  I just mixed up the dormer and the porch roof, and now I’m going to have to see if I can wedge it apart somehow and try again.  And you built
But Cas feels free.  He feels content.  He looks at Dean and he doesn’t remember ever loving him more than he loves him right now.  And a moment later, he feels the same.
Dean’s stomach plummets.  He remembers his promise.  “Yeah, man.  Me, too.  I’m, uh, not sure I should be driving quite yet, though.  You all right?”
She’s invited him over at least once a week since his ill-fated date with Jesse, and he hasn’t responded even once. Even when he considers how much leeway she gives him, he’s not sure what his reception will be.
.  His essence.  The deepest, most intimate parts of him.  It curls like something living, tracing patterns in the air.  It doesn’t move along Cas’s material form, it nestles inside it.  It is everything that Dean loves.
Sam turns, honing in on Dean like he has some sixth sense.  “Look how domestic you are, man!  And dad always said
The door is open, but Cas doesn’t want to just walk in.  It may be temporary, but the room is Sam’s for now.
“And it’s perfect that I ran into you here because I just met this guy, Jesse, and he is the absolute sweetest!  I think you’ll love him!”
Still contemplating his options, Dean makes a pit stop at Mallory’s and gets his standard large dark roast and one of the horrifying confections Gabe likes so much—vanilla nut maple froofy something-or-other.  Hopefully that’ll get the guy off his back until he figures out what exactly to do about the house.
“Hey, there,” he says, voice a bit rough.  “I’m Sam.”  As if Cas doesn’t know who tried to bleed to death in his guest room.
“Now, now,” she says cheerfully.  “Don’t want to scare young Alfie, do we, dears?”  She turns back while Alfie looks at Dean in confusion.
Dean’s hand spans the back of his neck, pulls him back, and then Cas is staring into Dean’s eyes.  “Cas, you know it’s not safe, right?  You know
She nods, smiling broadly as she takes in the large room.  “Very nice, good southern light.  I grow herbs, you know.  And some flowers.  This is perfect for it.”
The ghost, typically fully formed and ready to scare people off as soon as the door opens, trails slow wisps into the hallway.  They form his trenchcoat, his hands, and then his crestfallen face.
Cas fixes him with an icy ghost stare.  “Yes, Dean, it was.”  He looks away.  “It was very kind of you to have it repaired, and I do appreciate it — Alfie can’t really afford those kinds of costs now that he’s going back to school.  Anyhow, the fact remains that I can’t do anything here to physically maintain the house.”
But Dean’s on a roll now, he’s gonna get rid of this evil fuck just like crazy Grandpa Campbell used to.  He speaks more loudly now,
He knows it’s crazy.  Cas has seen most versions of him at this point—torn jeans for hanging cabinets, khakis and a fresh-out-of-the-package button up for work, and lots of jeans and flannels.  But he packs and unpacks twice before throwing in one of everything.
“Custom, aren’t they?” she asks, running a long finger along the simple beaded edge of the framing.  “Beautifully done, still sturdy and gorgeous after so many years.”  She turns to Dean and fixes him with a meaningful stare.  “They just don’t make them like they used to, do they?”
He grins as they hang up.  He doesn’t see enough of his brother.  This is a weird excuse, but he’ll take it.
“Whoa, whoa,” Sam says.  “What are you talking about?  I had to run some errands.  I got breakfast.”
He flips the DVD over in his hands, wondering what her game is, why she’s doing all of this, why she trusts him.  Finally, he shrugs and loads the DVD player.  Who is he to argue with this kind of meddling?  He can’t think of anywhere he’d rather be.
“It was good for you?” Deans asks, curling into the vast cocoon of Cas’s limbs.  “I need to—I really like to, uh...serve my partners?  You know?  I mean, I want to be able to give you something back, make you feel good.”
“Mmmm,” Dean agrees, and Cas is reassured as Dean’s lips spell his dedication across Cas’s shoulders.
familiar with how it looks in Cas’s language.  He’d programmed it to the nanosecond before swapping it out.  He knew it, and he knows that’s what he saw shimmering over Castiel’s hand.
And Cas’s mind, which has been reeling for the past 14 hours, gets stuck on that, uncomprehending.  “Your...your brother?”
“I didn’t…I wasn’t sure.  I’ve been able to walk in dreams before—with family.  When they needed reassurance or guidance.  But I can’t with Rowena, so I wasn’t certain if it was possible outside a blood relationship.”
Dean takes a deep breath.  “All right, then.  Just, you know, tell me if there’s a problem.  I’ll figure something out, okay?”
She slams the caps off on the counter and hands him his bottle in exchange for the flowers.  She puts them in a vase as she speaks.  “That’s awful.”  She looks over.  “Can I help?  I mean, a good game night can fix a lot of ills, and when that fails, y’know, sometimes some computer magic can help.”  She waves the fingers of her free hand.
In the ride to Cas’s home, Cas asks Dean about his life—how are Sam and his family?  Has Mary moved to Terra 4 yet?  How is Bobby handling Dean’s departure?  And look, Dean hasn’t worked with many immaterial beings before, but this feels absolutely as fantastic as he’d imagined, having a real conversation with Cas without having to worry about delays for solar storms or satellite issues.
He doesn’t have a plan beyond comfort when he hears the door open, but it’s not the bathroom door.  It’s behind him.  The garage door.
Cas smiles.  “Thank you, Dean.  It is wonderful to have you here.  I do hope I’ve been of some use.”
“I figure we’ll start with refreshments.  I didn’t know what you’d have seen before, so I figured we’d do a little taste test.”  He glances over to where Cas hovers and corrects himself.  “Sniff test, I guess.  Here, I got…” he pulls out the first three sample bottles and then rubs his hands on his jeans.  He might have gone a little crazy.  It was hard to know what Cas might like.
“Yes,” Dean cuts him off.  How can he be so damn sexy and clinical at the same time?  “Yes, please, whatever you want.”
But, he’s getting distracted. “Look, the house is great, I can understand why you’d want to stay here.  But, like, why didn’t you bother the kid who’s selling it?”
Dean looks up and the guy is still kinda translucent but he’s looking quite a bit more human now and he’s hiding his mouth with his hand and he is
Dean kisses him, long and gentle, smoothes fingers along his jaw and throat.  Cas smiles and just basks in it.  It feels like it’s been a long time since they had something so unhurried.
“In the flesh, dearie!”  She turns to the stove and puts the kettle on.  “Nothing for you to worry about.  Just means I can sense your ghostly friend.  Do sit down, won’t you, I’ll bring you a cuppa in a moment.”
Cas takes a deep breath.  “A hospital?  A safehouse?  A friend’s?  I don’t know, Dean.  You were a little vague with the details the last time we talked about your family.”  Cas crushes down his anger.  He knows that this is Dean’s way of getting space, of getting people to run away.  Cas thought he’d proven himself and gotten past all this, but apparently not.  He doesn’t let his hand drop away from Dean’s arm, just repositions so he can hold Dean’s hand, palm to palm.
Rowena’s paperwork moves through effortlessly.  Every day he’s got something else coming through to initial, confirm, sign.  The title search goes through in two days—he’s never seen anything like it.
Dean’s mouth is filled, tentacles writhing inside him like they can’t control themselves anymore, but never too deep, not even once.  He sucks desperately as Cas keeps moving that huge tentacle, thick and slick and still wriggling like nothing he’s ever had in his ass, and his dick,
“Of course you do. Anyhow, you and your mystery friend did a nice job.  It looks great and she loves it. She’s showing everyone that design in the shingles up there, and the bushes that are ‘just like the ones out front.’”
Cas nods, wide-eyed.  “Yes.  Dean, you must know how I feel.  It’s only…I don’t have any right to keep you—“
They’d been skirting around it since that awkward moment in the car, where Dean should have said something and didn’t.  The moment is gone.  And while, in that moment, he’d thought Cas was trying to say he had feelings for Dean, that seems less and less likely as time goes by.
Cas wakes to the press of kisses along his shoulder and neck, and while that’s all very nice, he’d rather be sleeping.  “No,” he grumbles.
“He kissed me, really.  Big moose like that, I’d have to climb him if I wanted to start something. But he didn’t push it. Told me—“
Dean stands in the doorway and watches Rowena step into the garage, the automatic door already rising.  Glancing back at the house, he sees the lights are on in welcome and when he turns back, Rowena’s Z3 is already sticking its nose into the driveway.
Cas reaches out to touch him, hesitates, and then keeps going, resolute.  He strokes the back of Sam’s hand with his thumb.  “We just want you to be safe.  Dean would...we just want to help.”
, the same way he knows Cas’s expressions.   “Yeah, I know.  Me too.”  He kisses Cas’s forehead and when he looks down, Cas’s eyes are squeezed shut.  He kisses him again.  “You okay, need some space?”
“We got tung oil, it’s got a nice shine without the high gloss.  That always looks a bit fake to me.”
Dean laughs nervously.  “Right."  The dark makes him say things that don't come easy in the light of day.  "Jesus, Cas," he whispers.  "You’re amazing.  Do you know that?  Have I told you that?  I have no idea how this happened, but I’m so glad.”
Cas watches him for a few long moments, Dean can see him out of the corner of his eye as he starts to pour the third one.  Finally, Cas moves forward and sniffs, and that look of enjoyment crosses his face, the one that makes Dean feel accomplished, somehow.
Sam’s going to pay for that now, and isn’t that exactly the kind of balance Dean never wanted in the world?
Dean met with the kid who was selling the place a week ago, but he likes to take a walk through on his own before he brings people in. It’s a good time to get his story straight, get a feel for the place.  See if there are any areas that feel empty or dark, that he can fix with a lamp or a little table.  He’s good at this part.  Even Gabe says so.
Cas laughs softly.  “Yes, it was fine.  Once the inspector left, the mother came and took it out to the rest of the family.”
“Hey, buddy!  Hang on, let me…”  He hefts the first set of bags onto the island and goes back for the other two, he has to make two more trips to grab what he brought from home.
.  I like knowing what you liked, how you lived and what you did, all of that.  Shut up and let me watch it.”  He keeps his voice soft.
“I need you to know,” Cas says gently, “This is your dream, but I’m not part of it.  I’m not your subconscious.  Anything that happens here, I’ll remember when you wake up.  So, I just need you to know that.  Before...before you say anything.”
Cas is smiling with soft affection when Dean turns to him.  It makes Dean want to kiss him all over again.
“Right,” Cas agrees.  “A group of people who establish rules, control territory and bribe politicians and cops to get what they need where they need it?”
Terror floods through him, and his feet are already halfway to the door before he even processes that he's running. Dean is a brave soul with a brown belt in ju jitsu, but this is well beyond anything he’s signed up for.  He slams the door behind him and runs as fast as he can to the car, starts her up and peels rubber on the way out.
“I shouldn’t have come here, Cas.  I’m sorry.” Sam says quietly.  “I knew Dean would help, I wanted to see him, but I should have found another way.”
Cas is looking embarrassed, now, looking around at anything but Dean.  He sighs.  “I mean, I did build it, but not the way you say.  I didn’t...cut down a forest and make a house out of it, if that’s what you’re thinking.  I ordered it.  From Sears.  And then my brothers and Hannah’s brothers and I put it together.”
Dean slides back a little, and down, so he and Sam are symmetrically aligned along Cas’s sides.  “I put on coffee but we have some time.”
“Well, you and Cas have a lovely breakfast, I’ll be very busy in the back garden for the next…oh, hour or so.  You just yell if you need me!  Ta!”
“Yes, Dean, please,” Cas is just as desperate as he is, just as lost, it seems, and he presses forward again, as eager as Dean is to kiss him again.  Again.  Just once more.
“Hell yeah, man.”  Dean doesn’t need a lot of convincing.  He tells himself it’s because it’s Star Trek.  “Let’s do it!”
Dean shrugs and gestures Alfie to follow along as Rowena strides over to the built-ins around the fireplace.
Cas looks up.  Sam is right there, hair tucked behind one ear, falling over his forehead on the other side.  He’s very lovely up close. The soft upturn of his nose.  The tiny lines when he smiles. The slight blush in his cheeks as Dean calls him out.
“I think he does,” Dean offers, and this might be the only downside to having the two of them working on him together.  The quips.  The teasing. The long drawn out—
He pulls around as he’s told and follows Rowena to the front door, much as he had when he showed her the house.
Warnings for: internalized homophobia, anticipated homophobia, Dean/Jesse (not explicit), highly emotional scene.
Dean folds into him, head down and pressed into his chest.  “Always too good for me,” he says, and it would be too soft to hear except Cas knows the rhythm of it.  He’s heard it a million times.  Another thing he thought they’d left behind.
Dean laughs softly, strokes a tentacle and then forms a gentle fist around it.  Pulls very carefully.  “It is easier, but I
“Morning, Cas,” Sam says, and Cas has no control over what he does next.  He pins Sam to the wall, heart beating out of his chest, something like terror pouring through him.
The ghost shrugs and seems to perch on the arm of the couch.  “Not that I know of.  I like it here.  I built this house.  I’d really prefer that everyone
“Oh, I picked up dinner on the way over,” Dean says, heart rate picking up even as he keeps his voice nonchalant.  “I had a long day, I just wasn’t up to cooking.  You know how it is.”  He closes his eyes.  He keeps making the stupidest comments.  It’s like Cas brings out the dumbass in him.  “Probably not, huh?”
Sam is still working. His fingers run slow lines against the V shape of Cas’s hip cuts—a fascination the brothers apparently have in common.
Sam strides past Cas, reaching out and then letting his arms fall to his sides at the last minute. “Shit, Dean, I’m sorry,” he says.
He presses forward, flattens his hand against Dean’s side, brings his mouth nearly to Dean’s.  “Tell me,” he says, voice rough.
Dean looks over, wanting to stop Cas with a kiss or a hand on his shoulder.  He interrupts instead, glaring.  “
“Sensei would appreciate your terminology,” Cas says, passing behind Dean to get to the hallway and noting how full the pots are.  “Did you invite the entire town?”
I wanted to post this past Monday but I just didn't have it done.  So, happy Thursday!  Fair warning, this chapter is NSFW!
He weighs his words carefully.  Finally he says, “Sam, I’m not asking him to choose between us.  Would you...is that what you need?”
“Fuck off, bitch,” Dean mutters, but his face isn’t angry.  It’s worried.  Scared.  Lit up from the inside like something has been ignited.
Dean looks up and catches Cas’s eyes, and he forgets for just a moment that Cas isn’t really here, not all of him, that their relationship is transitory, temporary, just like Cas himself.
Something snaps over Dean’s features - an emotional lockdown like Cas hasn’t seen in years.  “Get him inside.  Guest room.”  Dean strides forward and grabs the giant’s legs, and they move down the hallway and heave him onto the bed.  “Get me the first aid kit?” he asks quietly.  He doesn’t look up.  His eyes are fixed on the pale man’s features, like he’s looking at a ghost.
“Did you need something?” Cas asks.  “According to my calendar I’m free for the next...lifetime.  Yours, obviously.  Not mine.”
“No fighting before coffee,” Cas grouses.  “Kiss me,” he tells Sam, and Dean chuckles as Sam leans in.
Charlie’s friend, Jesse, is nice.  Big guy, quiet.  Dean notices right away they’re dressed like twins—Dean in his green flannel, Jesse in his black, and Charlie is beaming across the table any time she’s not giving Gilda the doe-eyes.  Dean doesn’t want to disappoint her, and he doesn’t want to hurt Jesse, either.  But his heart just isn’t in it.
Dean is teenage-first-date levels of nervous when he rings the bell the next morning at eight, coffee holder and Tupperware in hand.  He’s not sure about his reception, doesn’t even know what he
wants something ‘more authentic’, he can build his own damn cabinets!  You’re lucky I didn’t give him a heart attack.”
“I brought some new files, have a look,” Dean says, pulling out the profiles on the two families that have shown interest in the house.  “I think they’re promising.  The Doans have two kids, older boys who need a yard to practice in—they both play baseball, I guess they’re pretty serious about it.  They love old construction and they’re looking for a place to restore, not gut.”
Cas looks up at him, expression going from curious to amused.  “I am.  Are you?  Believe it or not, hand jobs were not invented by your generation.”
Dean pulls up, schooling his face, reminding himself that he did exactly what Cas asked him to do.  He lived his life, he took a chance.  That’s all.
Sam looks at him for a long moment.  Licks his lips.  “Does it matter?  I’m not the one who left.”  He holds up his hands, keeping Cas quiet.  “And he had good reason, don’t get me wrong.  But I just think...you’re talking to the wrong person.”
Heaven isn’t what it was last time he was there.  It’s just another thing that doesn’t feel quite right, that isn’t the same...everything is just
She digs an elbow into his ribs with expert precision and he winces, forcing himself not to rub the site of the attack.
By the time Charlie grabs him in a hug from behind, he’s halfway to a buzz and they’ve managed to while away 20 minutes, no problem.
When he sets the plates down, it’s one for Cas and one for him, and Cas tries not to think about it as anything other than a passing kindness.
You.  And, um, and—”  He looks up as if he can will the tears to stop and his breathing is ragged.  Dean can hardly breathe with the way his entire body feels ripped open.
Dean nods and they walk to the parking lot together.  Jesse grabs his shoulder before he goes.  “It was good to meet you, Dean.”
Dean swallows.  ”Yeah. Sure. Well. I’d…”  He loses himself in Cas’s eyes.  Lets his gaze flicker over Cas’s face, his high cheekbones, his mouth.  Flickers back to his eyes just as Cas licks his lips.  Every nerve in Dean’s body fires, alive and electric.
The light buzzing in his stomach sinks like a stone.  “Oh, God, what now?  You didn’t tell her I was mean to you, did you?  I think she’d literally skin me alive.”
“You do seem to be an excellent cook.” Cas declares at last, drifting back to his coffee.  “Thank you for bringing them.”  He pauses a moment before adding, “Rowena will be very appreciative.”
He takes a bite of the burger, and it’s just as good as he remembers.  He wonders if he cares that it’s not real.  Decides he doesn’t.
It takes some time for them to look back at him, but it doesn’t occur to Cas to mind—not when he can watch them like this—so intimate and gentle.  He can see them vying for power, angle shifts and quick bites, but he’s not even sure if they know they’re doing it.  It might just be an extension of how they are with each other.
“This might be totally out of nowhere, but, uh. Do you - do you wanna…” A large part of Dean wanted to just upend the milkshake in his hand over his own head and walk out. It seemed easier. It seemed more fitting for a guy like him. But Castiel was looking at him questioningly. “Do you wanna make this… like… a date?”
He frowned. The immediate urge was to taste it. The second thought was that it might be some kind of drug. But what sort of drug-user would leave their stash in a line, up against the glass of a window? Tentatively, Castiel raised his finger to his lips, and licked at one of the crystals.
“Bye,” Dean said, hurrying to end the meeting with a click, not wanting to be faced with even a second of screentime with just himself and Castiel. He tapped to ring off, just as Castiel said,
“So, Charlie probably told you I didn’t meet her yet. Or not since we were kids,” he said gruffly. “Lisa. My, uh, who I’m supposed to marry.”
If he left, would he ever come back? Castiel wasn’t sure. But it was beside the point, because Castiel knew he wasn’t leaving. Nothing that happened at the ceremony could hurt as much as the idea of Dean looking around for Castiel, and finding him gone.
The cars eased into the airport. Castiel stared out the tinted window, trying to stay calm. Nothing felt real, from the hurly-burly banter of the other bachelors in the car to the shining chrome of the airport entrance.
There isn’t anything that Castiel can say in answer. No explanations he can give that will make sense outside his own mind. All he finds himself doing is looking at Dean – looking at him more openly than he has done in a long time, half tight-lipped and wanting the conversation to end, half hoping that Dean will finally piece it all together. He allows himself to stare, frankly and directly, pushing away the guilt and shame that push back at him and tell him to look down, step away, move back, leave. He stares like he once used to all the time, letting down the walls.
He saw someone who was half-free, and half-bound. He could leave the house and walk around without being chased and harassed, but he couldn’t publicly own a whole part of his identity as a singer and a talented musician. He was out, but out as gay, not as gay asexual. His mask left his face half-uncovered and half-hidden, and that was Cas' life all the way through - open, visible, genuine, but only up to a point.
“Dean…” Cas said, breaking it with a single word said carefully, like strong hands cupping an eggshell.
The trees welcomed them, open-branched with leaves slowly moving in a light breeze. Castiel breathed in deeply, letting the smell of rich earth and sap and flowers ease the tightness in his chest just an inch. On either side of the path, among the ferns, he saw teasel and harebells growing. The summer had been a kind one, and the blossoms were still open and bright.
He walked away, a little more quickly than normal, and left the teachers’ lounge. Charlie watched after him, until Dean put his hands on his hips.
“That wasn’t the plan,” Castiel said. “We said the fewer people who know, the safer we are. I think that’s still true.”
He breathed out. He’d done it. He’d gone all the way through the house, and found nothing more worrying than some odd interior design choices and the local eight-legged populace.
The idea of having had it for barely a few seconds, and then losing it. Castiel reaches for words, for anything – something that will show Dean how much it all means to him, how far he’ll go to make it work.
“Right,” Dean said, because Cas still didn’t seem to be ready to talk, though he’d finally managed to stop looking at Dean and was now eyeing Jody as though she were a stranger. “Yeah. Uh… so… I’ll see you for practice tomorrow? Are we still on for that?”
Maybe it was broken, Dean thought. Maybe even though – even though they both – even still – maybe they’d broken it too much to fix it now.
“Listen.” Castiel tried to gather himself. Under Gabriel’s questions, he felt the calm that had filled him before the call being shaken. “Can you try to imagine it from my side of things? I was trying to figure out how to tell you, and you kept trying to get me together with women who I couldn’t turn down. And with our upbringing… there’s no way I could assume that you’d be alright with it.”
“Because,” Castiel said, trying not to look into Dean’s eyes, and instead facing forward to try to find a path out, “I should be out of the picture.”
The lines on his face were suddenly brutish, hard. He looked different to how Castiel had ever seen him before, even when they’d been facing the revenant together. He looked single-minded, furious, white-hot with anger. And when Castiel saw him like that, something fell away.
Castiel can barely breathe. Against the odds his hand is being held by Dean. Against the way that his words desert him, against the thousands of reasons that the two of them shouldn’t have ever even met, let alone be standing here together in a garden. Against all of it, Castiel’s hand is squeezed tight in Dean’s.
“It’s not,” Dean confirmed, not knowing what else to say, and wishing he could come up with something wittier in the moment. The guy was
But Castiel was sitting in the car with a wedding ring and a set of photographs in an envelope that were burning a hole in his pocket. If he just leaned forward too far or if one of the guys in the car insisted for some reason that he turn out his pockets, then…
mode but now I’m like, I don’t know. And the concert… and the video going viral and everyone knowing… and…” Dean broke off. He could feel, in a vague and absent way, that his heartbeat was speeding and his breath was coming short in his chest.
Out of the top of Dean’s head – impossibly, completely impossibly, but also absolutely undeniably – spiralled twin branches. Horns. No – antlers.
For a second, Castiel stood still and drank in the sensation of being alone – of no one knowing exactly where he was. The last short while had been a mess in so many ways. In the hush of his own space, he felt a part of him relax.
“We just don’t tell anyone,” Castiel said, feeling like one domino telling another that no one had to know they’d fallen down. But across the room, Dean was nodding.
There was no way Sam wouldn’t figure it out. Dean might be able to literally stand at a Castiel audition with a guy called Cas beside him and not put two and two together, but there was no way Sam was going to miss it, not when he was already going to be on full bloodhound mode after all Dean’s recent revelations.
He supposed he could take the wards down, now, if he wanted. Even if the revenant came back, he could talk to her. He could ask what was wrong. If she needed him to take more pain. Or if she wanted the pain back, that she’d given.
Castiel stopped himself. He could feel angry at Mary, but it felt like too much of a betrayal to put those feelings into words, and hate her that consciously and deliberately.
be here. He didn’t even slightly belong. He was just a freaking mechanic. He was a total nobody. Everyone was going to laugh the second he opened his mouth up on the stage - or, God forbid, they
It’s said in a way that makes Castiel want to believe he’s asking for all the things Castiel wants to give.
“So… what are your pronouns, then?” he said, in a voice that was way too casual and totally wrong, but the woman’s - person’s - expression brightened into genuine happiness when he asked.
Dean held still just a few inches from Castiel, wanting to let Castiel speak – keeping himself in check against the fact that all he felt like doing was melting back into their shared touch.
, though, their Paris pics had been subject to their friends’ wink emojis and innuendos. Jo’s mother had even called to ask if they were getting married. There were only so many times that they could reply to insist that the
“Okay. Okay, cool.” Dean set aside his misgivings, and they walked further into the store. Cas was walking with a kind of giddy purposefulness and Dean followed his lead, heading past the fruits and vegetables and the dairy section. The lights above were garishly bright and there were no windows, giving the place the usual unreal and timeless feel. Children were squawking and parents were hushing and teenagers were laughing in big groups and dead-eyed college kids were walking past like zombies swinging baskets full of instant noodles, and Cas seemed utterly unbothered by all of them.
Some small burst of relief, there. Dean’s expression eased. He put his hands in his pockets, lifted his chin, as though remembering the role he was playing. Who he was, now.
“Look… I can go. But I don’t want to,” Charlie said, shoving her hands into her pockets. “I’m not always, like, clued in with feelings or whatever, but… I’m here for you, you know? We can get in that car you’re fixing and just… talk.” She smiled at him, but it was a nervous smile, no warmth in it. He’d upset her.
“Absolutely. Nah, but I was just thinking, if it were the other way round, and you were pissed at me for not telling you that I, like, work with cars, I’d be like… dude…maybe I just didn’t wanna say, didn’t think it was relevant, and anyway I don’t have to, because I don’t owe you crap. Just because
Her voice was becoming clearer inside Castiel’s head, as though she were coming closer. The tone of it was too hard to read through the pain and the dark.
Friends, it's here!! I hope you enjoy this chapter nugget. Deep-fried and full of goodness. The next chapter will be up in a week, Friday the 10th! Good luck with this week, my dears. I hope it brings you many delights <3
“Chin and mouth,” Donna said breezily. Dean snorted, and Donna leaned back, raising one eyebrow. “It’s gotta be a beautiful mouth, you know. It’s all people can see of him. They take haitch-dee pictures and zoom in on ‘em. Imagine if he had some mustard stuck there.”
Dean’s brain took a second to catch up – and then he pressed his lips together to hold in a laugh. Cas tilted his head to one side.
WOOF I was a little worried I wouldn't get this posted! It's coming to you from Salzburg, Austria. Today I ate schnitzel and a lot of cheese and apricots - in other words, life couldn't be better. MOUNTAINS ARE EVERYWHERE. MOUNTAINS, GANDALF. I managed to find good wifi to get this up and I'm feeling most pleased indeed about that. I hope you all are having an excellent time out there - apologies for the brief hiatus, I want to do my best to make the deadline for the DCBB because I'm so excited for the fic I'm doing for it!! So many writing things I am excited for, so so many.
. A librarian’s salary definitely couldn’t handle an unexpected tax demand or an electricity bill two weeks before payday.
But through those doors was also Cas, who had asked him to come, and left Dean no other way to contact him. If Dean walked away from this dumb audition for a dumb singer with dumb songs, he’d also be walking away from any chance at seeing Cas again. He wanted to be OK with that; he really,
“Thanks,” he said, as he stood up and headed for the door. The next person in gave him a wobbly kind of smile, and Dean smiled back. He checked their label:
If it had been only Cas sitting with him, Dean realised, he would have carried on talking. He would have said how it had felt to come here the first time, how painfully excited and terrified he’d been. How much he’d wanted to fit in and how much he’d felt like he stood out, and how much he’d been accepted for doing both. How he’d met Charlie here. How he’d met
Castiel lifts one shoulder, a little diffidently. It had been necessary, so he’d done it. As simple as that.
He settled deeper into his chair. He could still feel his heart pounding. It gently slowed as the minutes unraveled, with Castiel still thinking about Dean’s expression. And the way he’d leaned in close, at the start.
“That’s because I did,” he said. “Handstand.” And when he saw that Castiel was trying not to laugh, he began walking his right hand up and down. “Yeah. Look at that. I learned that.”
Charlie’d said. But didn’t she see how stupid that would be? How pointless? It was too late, anyway. He’d already blown it.
She sounded almost nervous, and Dean lifted his head. His first, most horrible thought was that Charlie had somehow orchestrated the whole thing as a prank – that Castiel didn’t really want to date him, and it was all some huge joke – but no, that would be wild –
“You don’t have to say it back,” Castiel said, his hand still resting on Dean’s. “I know that it’s not…”
“There have been people in my past who haven’t been open to me being who I am,” he said. “Any anger I’ve been showing towards you has been misplaced, meant for them. You deserve better than second-hand anger. But it's… it's - I get lost in it, sometimes.”
One of Castiel’s hands moved forward, ever so slightly. And then Dean’s, just a little. By degrees, they reached for each other, until Castiel had Dean’s gloved hand in his own, and pulled on it, leading him towards the doorway into his home.
“You know how I feel,” Dean said, and the anger was burning through in his tone of voice. “I don’t get why you’d send those messages, if you didn’t… you know… the same. Feel. The same.” Anger gave way to awkwardness as his sentence stumbled.
He blinked. A notification – a text. He tried to pull down the notif to read what the text said, but he accidentally closed it instead. Treacherous little journeyman thumb, he thought. Maybe if it spent less time overexerting itself on social media scrolling, it’d be able to open a text message.
They were watching TV on the big old box in the living room. The signal wasn’t too bad, and they’d managed to find a documentary on whales that they could both settle into. The narrator was talking in a voice slightly fuzzy with static, describing the migratory pattern of a mother whale and her calf.
Obviously Dean did want Castiel to come, or he wouldn’t have asked. And drawing attention to the fact that Castiel was only going at Dean’s request would make Dean uncomfortable. He’d always hated asking for things that weren’t objectively necessary.
It wasn’t that he didn’t have anything here he thought was worth sharing. The forest was beautiful. His house was beautiful. It was just – he couldn’t post pictures of the forest for likes. Something about doing it would cheapen it.
Cas said nothing, only waited; Dean shrugged his shoulders, and a feeling managed to lap its way briefly over the numbing wall of shock - a slightly frantic, fervent confusion.
“I’m doing better at shaving,” he says. “And I’ve learned not to brush my teeth before drinking orange juice.”
Castiel thought to himself, looking ahead of him at Dean’s back, his shoulders, the short hairs on the nape of his neck. He thought it because he could, because it was true, and because he wouldn’t be able to think it for very long.
“I know,” Castiel said to himself, and threw off the covers. Yes, he could called Hannah and accept the texts and calls of derision from crowing former colleagues. Yes, he could call his brother back. Yes, he could call a taxi, though he had no money for a long ride, and the only way he’d have enough money would be to take the taxi directly to his brother’s house and ask him to pay it, and that would be a thousand times worse than just calling his brother back.
Dean was quiet, and Sam let him be, this time. Through his mind were running images of Sam - just moments between them. As kids, Sam grinning at him with paint on his face. As teens, Dean showing Sam how to shave and them laughing themselves stupid. Having their first drink at a bar together. The time Sam had broken his leg and called Dean instead of an ambulance. The way they’d stood beside each other at the funeral for their parents, not touching, but keeping each other upright just by standing exactly beside each other and not moving away. Throwing potatoes across the kitchen at each other at Christmas. A thousand times they’d caught each other’s eyes down all the years and looked away smiling, because the look itself had been enough to share a joke.
“Ah. Right. Thank you.” He rang off, and then sighed when he realised he’d forgotten to ask about the cleaning company.
away from him. Dean looked back towards Jo, who was looking mortified and also giggling. “Anyone?” Dean said. “English?”
“This version of you was,” Castiel said, through gritted teeth. “Didn’t you say you were alive before? And dead? You were something else before this happened to you.”
Castiel surfaced from sleep with his face crushed up against a wrinkled pillow, and the first thing he saw was Dean’s face.
Castiel nodded silently. Had she lingered a little pointedly on the word ‘friendship’? It had been so subtle, if so, that Castiel wasn’t sure.
And then he remembered Cas saying that he hadn’t had a lot of experience with romantic stuff, and Charlie saying that romance had been complicated for Cas in high school. Maybe he really hadn’t been paid all that many compliments about how he looked. The magazines raved about his voice, his charisma, but they couldn’t flatter a face that was always hidden behind a feathered mask.
Dean pretended to inspect the toothbrush, flicked off a non-existent mote of dust, and then put it back in the bag. Castiel watched him put on the little show, trying not to be charmed, or at the very least trying not to show it.
He went and ate some food to settle himself. Once he had an entire plate of pasta inside him, he felt slightly more able to go back to his laptop and open it up and check his email. Sure enough, there was the transcript in a message from Castiel.
He passed Donna in makeup and gave her a quick thumbs up, heading out through the door and back into the main theatre. He took a seat at the end of the row of other auditionees, which was now around ten strong. The person sitting next to him - red-haired, with a label that said
“The pictures. The wedding pictures.” Castiel put his hand back into his pocket, a little clumsily as his coat was rucked up behind him on the sofa, and pulled out the envelope that Balthazar had given to him. “We could look at them, and see if anyone else was there.”
“When I was speaking to the revenant, she said that the world has shapes for creatures like her. That she became what she needed to be.”
“Jesus, Cas,” he snapped, leaping up to halfway to sitting, and then closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose. “Fuck. Okay. Hello.”
When he looked up, he saw that Cas was still looking ever so slightly flustered, and it took Dean half a moment to realise why; he couldn’t still be thinking about that joking compliment that Dean had paid him, could he?
Was Cas not Cas’ real name, just some kind of nickname? Maybe he was one of those people who preferred to go by his middle name. Or - he’d said he didn’t get on with his family, so maybe he had too many bad associations with his given name of Jimmy, and usually went by one that he’d chosen himself.
“Hey, Ash,” Dean said, making himself grin; he’d been absorbed in the little world that he and Cas had made, forgotten that they could be seen and touched by other people for a minute.
Slowly, Castiel’s eyes crept over to meet Dean’s. But Dean was staring at the floor, his jaw tight. Castiel looked past Dean to Sam, who was staring at his brother.
Dean started the car. He could think about it later. Just trying to imagine it was stressing him out. Instead, he put the Impala in Drive and hit the gas, heading for the Ground Floor Theatre - via the nearest grocery store, where he made a quick stop-off.
He took a hurried, unthinking step towards the fridge, grabbed the Save the Date, and tore it down the middle. It wasn’t enough. He ripped it again, tearing it into shreds that he dropped, and it still wasn’t enough. Curling his hand closed tightly, Castiel turned to the wall and smashed his fist into it, as hard as he could.
“I mean,” she said, as Dean took it and began to scroll down, “they’re YouTube comments, so you have the odd troll, but…”
He swayed just slightly. None of it felt real enough to ground him. He kept doubting over and over again. Had he fallen into a dream?
like… with Sam… now that I’ve thought about it, I’ve realised how crappy it feels to have been keeping this whole thing, this part of my life, from him, all this time. Just - everything feels like it’s gonna go to shit if I go forward but I can’t go back.”
“Yes, of course,” Castiel said after too long a pause, stepping back to make space for her to come through. She walked into the room, and stopped a few steps in, looking around her.
He peered out of the window, into the gloom. Night was almost total, now. The forest looked lumpen and strange, and he could hear creatures starting to sing somewhere out in its depths. Maybe tomorrow he could go and look for them. The shrieking and calling wouldn’t sound so eerie if he could see the thing that made the noise, and know it wasn’t so big and bad, not really –
“Oh, God. That was good. But hey. What you were saying… it’s good to hear. That’s good stuff. I’m happy for you, dude.”
“And I’m out,” came Sam’s voice. Castiel’s eyes snapped open to see Sam getting to his feet, towel wrapped firmly around his waist, and heading for the door.
Mary walked towards them. There was something definitely off-balance about her, though she moved with her usual grace – some uncertainty in her step. Her eyes moved from her eldest son to Castiel and back again.
“Well, before I had any of that, I had you,” he said, each word a curt blow. “I had this. And if it means nothing to you, then you should just tell me that.”
Dean felt the sudden, intense impulse to throw the phone out the window, the tension too much. He remembered the phone didn’t belong to him, and repressed the urge.
“To be fair,” he said, “I ordered the same lights. There wasn’t any recon. I just had this.” He waved the remote.
“Yes,” Castiel said. In his mind, the crushing weight of the dark was shifting, just slightly, like a night being lit for an impossibly slow moment by a crack of lightning.
“Yeah, definitely. He hadn’t guessed, I don’t think. But he was awesome. He said some good stuff. It was kinda like you said, actually. Like, he knew that what he was seeing, my apartment and everything, it wasn’t all there is to me. I didn’t think he’d be picking up on it but he was, and… yeah, I don’t know. It’s just good.”
Castiel submerged it with a stern hand. No. He wasn’t going to think like that. The second he started trying to plan out a way to stop the wedding was the second he’d start getting his hopes up, and those hopes would only ever be disappointed. Even if he did manage to stop the wedding, Castiel could picture the look on Dean’s face: disbelief and horror that Castiel would do this to him.
say that around him. It’s ammunition for his plan to raze the palace and build a clean energy factory, or something.”
“No,” Castiel retorted. He threw his comb back into his suitcase. “Last night, you were talking as though there couldn’t be anything worse than going through with the royal wedding, and –”
“It’s not…” Dean muttered, a broken-off answer to a thought inside his head. “Just – I don’t know what you want me to do. Can you hear me thinking about you? ‘Cause it’s all the time, man. I don’t know what to do. Last time I saw you, you told me… but now you aren’t even…”
His eyes were moving over Castiel’s face. Castiel sat quietly, letting Dean look at him, letting them both exist slow and unhurried in this moment. The familiar smell of salt water and cool sand was in the air.
Dean held out his hand for Castiel to take. Castiel ignored it, and got himself to his feet. The Hunter turned away as though he hadn't even really noticed, kicking the foot of the guy they'd taken down.
“It’s not a big deal,” Dean said, hating himself even more for selling himself out, undercutting himself.
“I, um.” He starts to speak, and his voice is low and rough. When he pauses almost immediately, Dean shifts his weight from one foot to the other, licks his lips. Castiel searches for the words. “I tried staking that peach rose. But it didn’t do any good.”
“Well,” Cas said, and as he thought about it, Dean threw a quick look over his shoulder and was relieved to see that Ash had taken the hint and made himself scarce. Dean had no idea if anything was actually happening between him and this guy, Cas - or what sort of thing it might be - but he wanted the space to find out. “Well, no, not necessarily. Anything you want to recommend.”
Castiel scrolled some more. The voice in his mind was very loud but outwardly, he was just sitting in his living room, eyes fixed quietly on his screen.
“Wait,” Dean said, hopelessly, but Castiel was already leaving. He didn’t say goodbye, only walked away from him in the dark. Dean watched after him, his cheeks aflame, his mouth trying to shape words that wouldn’t come. Was it already over? Had he really managed to screw it up this fast?
“Well…” Gabriel paused for a long time. “Maybe you had to go too far because I was already way over the line,” he said.
“I think it’s just a fracture,” the Angel said to her gravely. “I’d go to a med-bay as soon as possible.”
He left his suitcase with an attendant outside the plane to be stowed in the hold and climbed the short metal stairway up to the plane’s interior. He could hear Ed and Harry talking loudly about coming back to the city soon, to general calls of agreement. Castiel listened for Dean’s voice among them, but didn’t hear it.
“What a talent.” Somehow, the words coming out of Cas’ mouth were just the right level of dry - not too biting with the irony. Dean wondered whether it’d be too much to ask if Cas wanted to go outside to talk for a while. Maybe he could just ask if he wanted to go get a drink together, to start off with.
“Head right on in,” they said. “You want to go through the doors there, and you’ll find Jody, who’ll be taking your music. Then you can go through to makeup…”
“Okay, next, Meg Masters,” called Jody, and a dark-haired white woman gave the group around her a quick, confident smile before stepping out onto the stage. A rock song’s first strains sounded, and Dean’s face lit up.
Castiel swallowed. He didn’t know how much more he should say – and maybe he’d already said too much. Dean would hate to think of Mary’s face looking like this. The whole point was supposed to be that Mary and Sam never felt any hurt. There was something surreal about seeing Mary in front of him knowing what there was between him and Dean. Castiel felt a little outside himself, watching the way her eyes dropped to the ground, her mind visibly racing.
Dean sat down, and didn’t know whether to look at him or not look at him, and tried to do both at once.
Dean shook his head, trying not to laugh with her, and failing. Once they’d started, it was hard to stop; Dean covered his mouth with his hand, trying to press the smile back and be serious, but Charlie was outright giggling beside him.
“You’re a disgrace,” Anna Celeste interrupted. And even through the crackling of his every nerve, Castiel felt something in him go cold. The pain he carried, as though it had been waiting for his call, found its target. When he spoke, every word was sliced to neatness by the hurt inside him.
Dean’s face seemed to fall. Maybe he’d been hoping Castiel would insist on selfishness, demand that they elope. A part of Castiel still wanted to.
Dean swallowed. Cas had been thinking about this a lot - but why would he be thinking about it? He was already out, publically, wasn’t he? He didn’t have to hide himself away, everyone knew that he was gay. Why would something like this be on his mind? Maybe he wasn’t out to his family in Alaska, but it seemed impossible that they wouldn’t have picked up just one of the many magazines where Cas mentioned in an interview that he was gay.
Castiel, realising that he was sprawled over Dean like a limp doll, took in a sharp breath and sat up. He blinked, slowly, letting his spinning head settle.
Embarrassing. Embarrassing to be alone and so angry. Embarrassing to have lost his job. Embarrassing to be himself, right now, to be the person having to tuck his tail between his legs and run away from the city that had been his home for almost a decade. He needed to go and fetch the tape, but somehow doing so felt like losing.
Dean gritted his teeth. He knew where that line of thought and feeling went – somewhere Castiel didn’t want to go. Somewhere that would leave Dean on the end of a phone in the middle of the street with a pit in his stomach and a reservation at the nicest restaurant in town that no one was going to keep.
“Shit,” Dean said, the tension breaking out of him in a laugh that was just a little too loud. “Sam, I didn’t kill anyone. What the hell?!”
For a while, he just stared at the phone. It lay, innocuous and silent, on the dash. He could make out the thumbnail of the video - a shot of Castiel in his mask, blown up to be full-screen - and a white triangle in the centre that he could push to make it play.
Dean Winchester? Castiel felt a little flip in his stomach. He’d been hoping to get to chat to Dean for months, now – they’d shared a class last semester but somehow had never got to talking, just traded looks across the room. Castiel had thought he’d lost his chance when the semester had ended and their shared class had been over – but then Charlie had added Dean into the chat at the start of the new year, introducing him as someone she’d met in one of her computing classes. Dean had been quiet so far, though, just lurking and reading messages.
“And that's why you shouldn't give honey to babies,” Cas finished, when their fourth mojitos showed up.
“You know,” Dean said, “my favourite milkshake flavour is actually a mixture of our two. Like, both together.”
“Assbutt?” he managed. “Ass… butt?” The second time, he put the wobble in the middle. Castiel folded his arms.
I went to Pride!!! It was bright and colourful and amazing and I saw a knight in full armour carrying a rainbow flag and an ace flag. I mean, what an absolute legend. There really weren't enough ace flags around the place so next year I'm going to have to get me one of those (though a few people did spot the ace and nb flags painted on my cheeks and were like !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and we shared a !!!!!!!!!!!!! moment). I'm rambling! Yes anyway. I hope everyone's week was a good one. Wish me luck with my forays into baking this weekend, I've got to make a birthday cake for my sister and I'm aiming for four tiers of chocolate orange deliciousness topped with orange buttercream. If I manage to pull it off I'm going to be like Kronk with his spinach puffs. ANYWAY. Have a good week out there!! <3
But the knocking came again, insistent, as though the person outside knew already that there was someone on the inside.
“If it means we’re the same,” Castiel says. And his reasoning isn’t even clear to Castiel himself, now. It just feels as though if they’re both human, if they both are the same thing, there’s a chance they could both feel the same way, too – it makes no sense, and yet Castiel can’t imagine letting go of the thought.
“Uh… yeah, alright,” Dean said, looking confused by the offer but too nervous to care. He turned to Castiel. “Cas,” he said. “You don’t have to come.”
A loud, cheerful jingle filled Castiel’s bedroom, and jolted him awake. For a few dazed seconds, he stared around the dark and curtained room with a sense of déjà vu; apparently, his life was now waking up in strange rooms and not understanding what was going on.
Of course Dean knew that Castiel had been planning to drop by the orphanage on his way back to his own apartment. Because Dean knew Castiel.
Movie? Dean’s worn-out brain struggled for a second, and then light dawned. That was right. There was a one-off showing of Tombstone this Sunday, part of a Western Weekend at their local movie theatre. Dean had asked a few other people – his brother, a few of his friends, even his other coworker Charlie – but none of them had wanted to go. As a last resort before just deciding to go solo, Dean had asked Castiel. The two of them only really talked about work-related things when they talked at all, and Castiel was a weird mixture of dorky and aloof, but Dean had marginally preferred the idea of going with him to going alone.
He signed using the digital signature software, his name looking clumsy as he drew it using the trackpad.
“I did it for you. Because you needed me to. But I also did it for me… because I wanted to. I suppose…” His mouth was suddenly dry. But why should he be embarrassed to say this now? “Whatever way you look at it, I did it because I love you.”
“I haven’t been to Someria,” Castiel said, trying to take the attention away from Dean. “But I’ve read a lot of good things about it.”
The way Dean coloured ever so slightly - Castiel was caught between admiration and a scoff. Did Dean really have any shyness left? Surely someone with a reputation like Dean’s had to be past that by now. Castiel couldn’t imagine there were a great deal of people here who hadn’t known the pleasure of Dean’s company in some way or other, over the last few years since he’d joined Harmony building’s party scene.
“But, yeah, the lake here is great,” Charlie said. “I never knew about it until I started working for the royal family.”
Dean’s chest squeezed. He put his hands up into his hair to make sure all the bubbles had been rinsed out.
“What’s going on?” Cas demanded, stepping over to take the laptop. Jody looked over at Dean, her eyebrows raised.
“Oh my God,” Dean said out loud, only now remembering them saying that. “He’s literally right there. Oh my God.”
“Finally applying for a different job?” Bobby asked, pulling a mint out of a pocket, inspecting it for cleanness, and then popping it in his mouth.
They went downstairs. Still in silence, in the quiet and the dark. The stairs made hollow sounds under Dean’s feet. Castiel wondered what his shoes were made of. He wondered what Dean was thinking.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said, trying to brush it off. He’d somehow managed to give himself a completely dead leg.
“No,” Castiel said. He repressed a shudder. There was something about the way the nex used his own thoughts to speak to him that made his skin crawl. The twisting knife of happiness dug in deeper, and his sensation of discomfort eased unnaturally.
Statuesque, he sat perfectly still and completely silent as other guests found their places all around him, and talked past him about the cathedral decorations and the promised splendour of the reception banquet. Castiel, as a close friend of the family, had been given a seat close to the front of the cathedral, with only one row between him and the seats at the front where Mary was already sat. He watched the back of her head while, on either side of him, conversations fluttered and fussed.
“It's OK. It was a dumb question.” Dean realised that his refusal was going to lead to this becoming a
Castiel stared at her. And for a second, he couldn’t help but hate her, just a little. She had the weight of a country’s wellbeing on her shoulders and he knew why she had to try to pull this off – she’d explained it all to him, the economy, the riches of Someria, the politics. But in front of her was her son, clearly letting himself be trapped in a cage that she was building around him, allowing her to do it just because he loved her that much.
Dean held out his hand to take back the donut box as he spoke; Cas reached inside and took one before surrendering it. He bit into it as he finished his sentence, leaving a big smudge of powder across his top lip. Dean considered using his thumb to wipe it off, using his lips to kiss it off, taking Cas’ hand to use
They’d already talked so much, though. So much more than normal. And it had gone well. Dean decided to quit while he was ahead.
Dean nodded to them with a smile in parting, and headed towards the doors to the theatre itself. It was surreal, somehow, to be back in this place - so soon after the auditions, and yet it felt like a lifetime ago that he’d last been here, hoping to catch a glimpse of the guy he’d met in the bar the night before. The guy he’d been about to find out was an international megastar. The guy he’d been going to run away with, out a window.
Wide-eyed, still sitting on the sidewalk, Dean took this in. Something light crossed his face, then anger, then confusion.
“Your Majesty,” Charlie said, bowing even though the Queen’s back was turned, and then turning to Lisa. “Your Grace. Would you walk with me through the palace this morning? We have some particularly fine, um, glasswork, and… paintings, and… yeah.”
“Honest,” Cas said. “Honest about what you want. Whatever it is, the choice is yours. I’m in your hands.”
The way he’d phrased it, or maybe it was his tone of voice, was a teenager asking his crush if they could have a second date. And Castiel thought that he had to be the only one who would have heard it, the only one paying attention to himself that much – except Dean raised an eyebrow, and his smile returned, a little more winning.
“How far is it to where you live?” Cas said. Dean shifted the car into Drive, and put his foot on the gas.
Claire looked at him silently. Castiel could see it in her face: anger, and hurt, and confusion. Every emotion that he’d wanted to throw at Lisa, too, and had been unable to.
All this time pulling away, suppressing, hiding in his own house - keeping most of himself locked up behind plain and empty walls, thinking that Sam wouldn’t notice, Sam wouldn’t care, Sam wouldn’t see the difference because this was who Dean had always been to him, just a plain old car guy and not much more. But Sam had seen. Sam had known.
With his head on one side, he considered what he was seeing. A little border of salt, poured along the sill on the inside of his living room window.
Dean was tensing under his, Castiel’s, touch. It was Castiel’s kiss that was making Dean breathe quicker.
“That was years ago. Castiel, you take a bath every day. You know what pomade is. You own Versace underwear.”
“Sure,” he said easily. “We can take the coastal road. It’s the fastest way there, trust me. Better than tripping over roots all the way there. Those things get too damn long.”
“Yeah. But right now, man, I’m just happy to see you,” Dean said, and was rewarded with a quick blink and a surprised curve of Cas’ mouth.
But… no, she was more than that. She was his movie buddy. She’d dropped everything to come shopping with him today, as soon as he’d asked. And she wasn’t expressing even one cent’s worth of annoyance over Dean’s shopping method, or lack of it.
“Hell yeah, he would,” Dean said. He grinned at Cas through the half-dark of the bar. This was going well, right? Dean was sure this was going well. The conversation seemed to be flowing.
“More than being an international superstar?” Dean said incredulously, and Cas shrugged. “Well... look. Right now, we’re just here to have fun. We can talk about whatever you want whenever you want, but in the meantime, we can just hang out, right?”
What did he do now? Castiel had sent all those messages privately. Did that mean Dean had to pretend he’d never seen them? Dean grabbed suddenly for his laptop, pulled up a search browser and typed in
He had the keys to the house in his pocket, already picked up from the realtors’ office back in New York. Castiel could feel them digging into his hip, an uncomfortable talisman to the house’s strange world, a reminder that he wasn’t just a visitor to this place – that he belonged here, now. This was where he was going to be living.
“Thank you, Ma’am,” Castiel agreed courteously, and bowed his head to her as she turned away from him. The group straggled towards the cars that awaited them in sleek dark resplendence.
He buries his face in Dean’s neck and feels him tremble.  “I always thought we should go on a real roadtrip,” he says quietly.
Dean turns around for another kiss.  “Got me there.  Go get changed, dinner’s in twenty.  If you’re quick, you can go do bendy stuff on the porch.”  He wiggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“She, ah, she said it might be better if I watched with you instead.  I guess it’s not really her ‘thing.’”
Cas can feel eyes on him as he walks out.  They’re unusually silent and Cas tries not to take offense.  They seem irritatingly surprised by the fact that he has ideas and interests.
Cas laughs, relaxed, and Dean feels his shoulders drop as well.  “It must seem strange to you, now, but, yes, from Sears, and no, not Lincoln logs.  You’ll find it did prepare me well, however, for reading directions,” and he points out where Dean is about to attach the dormer out of order, and ruin any chances he has for getting the shingles in afterward.
Cas wakes with Sam’s head pillowed on his chest and Dean...is gone.  “Dean?” he hisses in alarm, trying not to wake Sam.
, it’s worse knowing that it’s not hatred on Cas’s side, it’s something else, and just thinking about Cas having gone through that, of having never been able to do anything about it, having him so close, now—
Check and mate.  That’s what he gets for trying to make nice.  He considers how to back-pedal, then shakes his head and sighs.  “Of course, what can I do?”
Sam shrugs. “Look, if it was some hacked up radio alarm, sure. But it’s always been more about the prank factor than the aesthetics with—“ he looks over with wide eyes. “Dean, tell me you haven’t set some horrible trap in that house. Is it clowns?  I will literally,
