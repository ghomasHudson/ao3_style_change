“Coffee. Lunch. Damn trench coat. How could you forget that?”
Cas smiled slightly, and began to pack away his first aid kit.
So the dean kept it quiet, and worked.
‘You and Sam can wait in the living room.’
“Hey, um, how often does, that happen?”
It was quite relaxing though the damn thing looked like a damn pimp mobile and sometimes Dean just couldn't help but giggle at it and wonder who the hell has this car.
It didn't work.
“Dean.”
Dean nuzzled his head against cas’ thigh, as cas slowly let his trenchcoat fall off his shoulders.
“Ran into Meg at the store today.”
“Thank you, i don't know if i would have been able to survive the rest of the day without this.”
Charlie screamed.
“You are the best in the world.”
He went to his room and got Cas some sweatpants and his led zeppelin shirt. It was his favourite, and he wouldn't admit it but, he wanted to see cas in his clothes.
“Are you ever planning to come out? I mean, you two are practically married already, why haven't you made a video with Dean yet ?”
And classes went as slow as humanly damn possible.
‘Your girlfriend?’
Not five minutes later, Castiel walked in, and Dean looked too happy. He stood up walked over to Cas, put his arm around his shoulder and kissed his cheek, before cheerily saying,
Of course Dean still loved to go out and get laid. He was a hrony twenty something year old, of course he was gonna go out to clubs.
“Karma's a bitch.”
Then it stopped, and he peaked around the corner.
Dean looked at him with slight confusion.
Cas did. He was intrigued to see his boyfriend's video. Oddly though, cas wasn't in the video, he didn't know what had happened.
Dean just laughed slightly, as cas huffed slightly, fake mad.
Unfortunately, this led to Dean's rekindling of his school boy crush on Cas, but this time he couldn't run away, he didn't want to run away.
Cas kisses Dean again.
Either way, hope this was okay and you all have a wonderful day/night.
________________________________________________________
But he kept his distance, he would smile or wave, sometimes Dean would reciprocate, other times not.
The rest of the class was a mix between awe and amusement and that one day has forever gone down as the best coming out story ever for dean and Cas.
And that's how it began.
Bobby took the note.
‘Me and cas are not dating. Why does everybody think that !?’
Dean felt a little awkward, he couldn't afford to lose Sam, both literally and figuratively.
Hopefully you enjoyed this :)
________________________________________________________
Dean arrived at Cas’ apartment building in a few minutes.
New chapter !! Fair warning, gonna be a little angsty.
Sam could’nt help it, he had to thrid wheel with them for years with there eye sex and being very obviosly in love with eachother, how could sam pass up this golden opportunity to poke fun at his older brother.
“That idjit.”
So cas just stood, and waited as grunts and punches landed.
“You don't need to do that, dean. I'm not worth it.”
________________________________________________________
They decided to head to a local bar which also served food because that is a necessity for Dean Winchester.
Cas left to go and get some sponges and cleaning supplies, leaving a mug of coffee on the kitchen counter for Dean when he finally dragged himself out of their bed.
After hesitating, he finally opened it.
He walked down the stairs to see Sam looking all huffy on the couch.
Dean went off to the bathroom to shower and get into fresh clothes.
Dean had practically stopped talking to cas altogether, but that didn't stop his thought.
Dean had a lot of questions, but right now, he was more concerned for cas.
‘It was meowing coming from the bush so I went out to get the poor creature. The little thing was trapped in a thorn bush, and it was raining so I grabbed him. The thorns scratched me up a bit as well as the kitten but it's fine. Then I realized I left my keys inside, and just ran to your place out of concern for the little guy.’
If only he knew what happens in the bathrooms of the clubs.
He leaned against the sink, where Dean had been sitting previously, and pulled out his phone, texting dean.
And just like that, a wave of questions about him and dean came flooding at him.
Hopefully this was okay, and i'll see if i actually update again hopefully soon, but, that's iffy :P I think this chapter might be a bit longer so, hopefully that might tide some people over :))
‘Why? You know i don't care.’
About 30 minutes later, a shivering castiel knocked on the front door of singer 's salvage yard, hoping Dean was still there, even if his beloved baby wasn't in immediate sight.
“Yes dean winchester.”
Hopefully you liked this chapter, i know it isn't to great, but hopefully it was enjoyable.
“Please just watch one video, I swear!”
“Where the fuck have you been!”
Bobby simply shook his head. It had been over a week since cas was last here. Bobby didn't know why he stopped coming over.
Dean was actually pretty happy.
Meg said. Cas was on the verge of hysterically laughing. Jess was basically deans child, he even gave Sam a soup recipe when she was sick. Not to mention the fact that dean and himself had been dating since their last year of highschool.
Each time cas would text dean, sam would ask if that was the ‘mystery girl’ and every time dean would just laugh a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can't get out of everything with kisses.”
But surprisingly, they had been dating for over two years. Most of their friends and family knew as well as many teachers, though of course most students were completely oblivious to the fact. All until one douche bag kid made Dean happily spill his little secret to shut him the hell up.
Every Sunday when dean and cas went out on their now scheduled ‘date night’, sam would make a snarky comment about dean having an actual girlfriend and all that.
When the lunch bell went and all the students left, he stayed behind for a minute, trying to get his tired body to move after suffering so many classes with devil children. He hated tuesdays.
“Just shit. Can you just fuck off ?” Dean really didn't have the patience for this right now.
‘Am I gonna meet him again? I doubt he even remembers me.’
Dean got in baby, and before he drove off quickly said a ‘i’ll text ya’ before speeding off.
Dean seemed to squeeze tighter around Cas’ waist. Cas only snickered and slowly made his way out of the bed.
It kept like this, this mutual pining for weeks.
“How has the feedback from the video been?”
“Shit happened.”
Cas shouted through the home, not knowing where he is.
Cas said playfully.
“Those are not appropriate. I am already treading incredibly close to unprofessionalism as it is talking about my romantic life, let alone my sex life.”
‘Good, what are you watching?’
Around half of the class began to crowd around megs desk and immediately went quiet to listen to the video.
He looked like he was trying to shrink as small as he could.
His night classes didn't start around 8:30.
Just as last time, half the class gathered around megs phone to watch the new video.
Soooooo, hi. I think it is just accepted now that I don't update regularly, but hopefully this is decent, I know it's not the best, bust at least we're almost done.
“Thats understandable I suppose.”
That was it.
Cas could tell Dean was nervous, he didn't know what about, but he suspected it was probably about the video, maybe more backlash than he had led on? Dean did always cook when he was nervous.
Cas was lightly snoring, and dean could feel his heartbeat, a calming rhythm beneath his ear.
‘Sure.’
Cas just sat there, on the floor of the boys bathroom wondering what the hell just happened as Dean ran away.
He's thankful Bobby nailed that into him.
Thankfully Deans slight panic was temporarily subdued with a goodnight text from cas with a sleeping bee.
“Oh, is he gonna be back soon?”
So here dean was, stuffing his face with fries and a burger, as cas sat there sipping a black coffee.
“What the fuck do you want.”
Dean awkwardly coughed,
Sorry for abandoning this for a month. I sorta lost inspiration, but then i refound it, so im gonna try and finish what I have planned for this by Monday latest. Also to my only irl friend that knows about this fic...hi.
Cas says seriously.
“Funny how you can hide these at home, but not on the internet.”
John had to go out and do odd jobs for a few weeks, while Dean looked after sammy.
Before he walked out though, he quickly wrote down that he was going on a date on a post-it note and stuck it to the fridge.
They all continued to watch in silence until Dean began talking about his amazing lack of speeding tickets, which Sam immediately called out as false.
“Dean, it's beautiful.”
“You cant be gay if you were in the army.”
Dean said.
“No you dont.”
After a while, he just couldn't put up with this oddly cooperative class.
It started with small things, always smiling when he heard cas’ name, barely noticeable butterflies when they would touch accidentally, and the sheer loneliness Dean felt when cas was gone.
“Um, pretty frequently i suppose.”
Cas smirked.
Sam just, nodded and walked out.
He smiled, loving how cas smiled at that.
And he kissed him.
Cas said in a lighthearted tone, but Dean just looked down like he was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Season 08/episode 13
He leaned across to cas, still sitting between the sinks, and kissed cas.
Cas was already standing outside the buildings, in more casual clothes but still with the trench coat on.
“I know how much you love to see me on my knees angel.”
When cas yawned, dean told him to head to bed, cas initially declined, but dean just told him to head to his room and what door it was and cas left, dragging his legs across the floor before he shut deans door.
“You gonna make a video today?”
Cas smirks slightly, and deans chuckles under his breath.
“Don't ya think jess and dean would be cute together?!”
“Aren't you meant to be in class.”
________________________________________________________
‘By the way, cas is staying the night.’
Dean looked up to see a worried cas, only an inch or two from his face.
Dean just didn't know what to do.
Meg really did want an answer out of him. Though she didn't understand the lengths cas was willing to go out of stubbornness and pride alone.
‘Holy shit...YOU’RE THE GIRLFRIEND!’
This was probably one of the most awkward situations that Dean had ever been in.
Dean was made to travel across the country, he was barely able to make friends, let alone keep a relationship, and a long distance one at that.
Dean giggles as Cas begins to kiss his freckles across his nose.
Cas looked like he had been punched in the gut, his eyes down cast.
Cas came through a minute later, dressed in deans clothes, and Dean tried his best to suppress the blush rising in his cheeks.
Dean whispered. He was almost childlike. All quiet and small wrapped around him.
It was a surprisingly calm Sunday seeing as the terrifying world of the internet could figure things out about Dean he didn't want them to know, yet.
“CAS HELP. KIDS ARE POKING HOLES IN THE HOBBIT MOVIE AND I DON'T LIKE IT !!!”
Hopefully this was at least okay, and you enjoyed it :)))
Bobby heard the impala’s engine start and slowly fade off as they drove away.
Cas chuckled, startling dean.
Dean didn't want to focus on having to cover up the fact cas was a guy, so he deflected.
Dean said, tone light as if everything was forgotten and unimportant.
“Fucked up at school slightly and, i'm just tired.”
“Oh,ok, if you need anything i'm here.”
“Ok, ok, sh, one at a time.”
________________________________________________________
Cas asked, smirking.
“Sure boy, but why don't you just say goodbye in person ?”
“Aw, don't be like that.”
Dean and cas began to discuss how they met and other fun tales, with a few kisses and flirtations along the way.
“Well then you shouldn't have left so many.”
Monday was slightly more frantic. Dean was awake a little after Cas came out his shower, which meant a good, real breakfast and coffee in a real mug instead of a travel one, but also a both somewhat tired but energetic dean, and a cas trying to remember where he placed his marked papers.
Well in all honesty, it wasn't that surprising, he was probably passed out on a couch or in a ditch.
“Yes. to. All. then.”
Yep, seemed to have completely forgotten about Cas.
It was a long day.
Dean - I mean, I'm good to go now, if you want… :)
dean loved this. The lazy morning kisses that left him feeling lighter than air and as if the world could end yet he would still be there, wrapped around cas' waist, smiling like a goof as cas continued to plant kisses across his forehead.
Unfortunately, he knew that their time had passed, that he missed his opportunity.
“What are you sticking up for your boyfriend?”
The class was curious, but did not complain.
Dean wasn’t entirely sure how Cas had even been able to drag him here.
Then, they kissed.
Unbeknownst to him, dean had uploaded a new video, a short vlog type with no editing, right in the middle of his class.
Cas simply sighed,
He ignored the texts. He didn't know if they were from Sam or cas, but he just wanted to live in ignorant bliss, even if it was just for afew hours.
“Now, you all know im bi and I'm dating someone. Who you just saw, well, the love of my life.”
He quickly drives off to work.
“Wow. this is one hell of a surprise.”
Of course this peeked cesar interest, jesse didn't talk much but even he seemed interested in who this mystery person was.
Dean had his suspicions, but also knew, teenagers would through homophobic slurs, at people who weren't even gay.
“Better be, cost a damn fortune.”
He would never admit that he liked that feeling, of feeling safe and secure.
Cas replies, already knowing Dean would be blushing as red as a tomato.
“Why did you leave the note ?”
They ate their breakfast watching weird morning tv ads and laughing at the sheer stupidity and uselessness of the items. Afterwards Cas sent Dean off for a shower as well.
Grumpily, dean was walking down the halls, hearing as his feet thudded against the linoleum, not caring or noticing where he was or his surroundings until he heard whimpers and fucking near evil laughter.
He carried on about privacy, and a little about cas without revealing anything important that could identify who he was dating, so Cas slowly zoned the video out, smiling to himself. Until he heard meg.
“Oh, sassy cassie.”
Cas sat beside him and wrapped his arm around Dean's shoulder.
Sam even convinced Dean to take some engineering night classes, as well as a few mechanic night classes.
Cas said as he took a plate next to Dean on the counter, half the eggs already gone by the time he made it to the couch, dean in tow.
At bobbys, Dean was napping for no more than ten minutes.
Cas moved from deans head to his forehead to his cheeks. Peppering kisses across each of his freckles.
“Sure. Now please don't destroy the class while I'm gone.”
They stayed like that until Dean pulled away, a smile carved into his face.
Cas just kissed him.
So, a few gay bars, a few nights of stress relief and dean was confused and scared and just wanted to run away again.
“DEAN WINCHESTER UPLOADED A NEW VIDEO!!”
‘Hello dean.’
Meg was obviously running to the door, screaming about it like she was starting a damn revolution.
“Actually, really good. A few asshats here, but there was an entire army to tell them to fuck off for me so.”
Cas simply sighed, how did she have this much confidence.
Dean over heard but new charlie could stand up for herself, so he didn't intervene, and honestly, he wanted to know how charlie was gonna reply.
Dean laughed slightly, and stood up to go and pick cas up.
Dean said as he got up.
“Let's get to bed.”
It was a calm morning. Dean had woken up next to his (newly human) boyfriend, nuzzled into his chest like a cat.
Dean - you are NOT picking me up in that pimp mobile of a car, we're taking baby. I’ll pick you up :P
Why did he kiss cas ? Why did cas kiss back ? what had he done ? What was Sam gonna think ? or bobby or dad ?
“Love you too.”
hey, so i hope it wasn't to bad of a chapter, but thank you for reading this shit anyway :))
They chatted through the drive, as well as at the diner.
Cas went into work the next day, smiling so wide, charlie noticed and he obviously told her. How could he not?
“Would you like me to dislocate and relocate your shoulder to prove it?”
He shouldn't get attached, he should go back to his one night stands, no strings attached, because then it didn't hurt when you left.
He heard dean call from their bedroom, or filming room as it is referred to throughout the day.
‘Um, so, I'm bi, and I have a boyfriend.’
Cas woke up with his alarm blaring and his boyfriend wrapped around his waist. He loved the man but he clung to him like a koala when he was asleep, hell, even when he was awake. Cas didn't mind, but it did become a hassle when he was having to get ready to teach a bunch of snotty teenagers at 6 in the morning.
There were a few more scenes like that. Cut scenes of cas and dean's domestic life.
“I love you dean.”
“Oh, and don't worry I wont hit on you.”
Dean wandered through to see Sam, his 6”4’ giant of a brother, sitting cross legged on the floor with a tiny kitten in his lap.
“Hey cas.”
Dean said as he handed each item to cas.
“Fuck sake dean, I know you were out, but you always send one of those ridiculous texts with a winky face that make me want to kill you beofre you leave whatever bar. Jesus. Next time don't freak me out like that.”
Zach was kinda surprised, well, most of the class were, but dean didn’t stop there, he wanted to make this kid feel so embarrassed.
Not to mention housing in california is expensive, so halfing rent isn't the worst idea.
‘castiel, you are Sam, would one of you mind helping me with him?’
Cas was so happy Charlie existed at that moment.
A Few more questions came in like that, simple to answer questions.
Dean laughed slightly.
“Deans not out online yet and...i'm camera shy. Anyway, don't forget your filming with Dean tomorrow.”
It was just past 5:30, and he was already changed, and he really did want to go out on a date.
Meg asked if he could put it on the board as they finished up revision questions for a test which was highly opposed to.
Sam laughed slightly before saying,
And cas simply sat and listened.
Before dean was able to walk further away, Sam said one more thing.
Dean giggled slightly at the last part. Unfortunately that little bit of happiness disappeared when he seemed to think the weight of the situation seemed to return.
Cas was busy all morning and afternoon, as his boss was an ‘assbutt’ according to Cas, but both of them were free that night.
Season 11/episode 19
It was 8:20 when Dean realised he was gonna be late.
Dean loved cuddles, he loved feeling cas next to him, knowing there was someone there, feeling the heat off his body and knowing he was safe, that someone was there to protect him.
Dean sighed. Cas only giggled and placed a cup of coffee on the bed side table and gave dean a peck on the cheek.
When Dean eventually got to his room, he found cas snuggled on the bed, burritoed in the blankets.
Cas smiled, but Dean knew it was a sad one, it didn't reach his eyes, his once bright, bright blue eyes seemed almost grey now.
He got dressed, and was making coffee when he felt Dean wrap his arms around his midsection.
Cas brought up, He had told Dean about Meg before.
“Goodnight dean, i love you.”
Dean looked somewhat terrified, though he was somewhat shocked out of the small feeling of fear building up by cas laughing, not hysterically but still.
He began walking off towards his room.
Meg giggled as cas shut and locked his door, using the free period he had to mark work.
Bobby was confused, but Dean didn't reply when he asked what he was doing home so early, only mumbling under his breath that he needed to go to bed.
Dean never realised he was falling for cas, until Sam brought up a girl he was falling for.
Castiel was happy, he was crying.
Dean mumbled.
He really hadn't changed.
Dean said teasingly, somewhat effectively lightening the mood, as cas mouth quirked up in a small smile.
Shit. Dean Winchester was falling for Castiel Novak.
“Can i return back to my class now dean.”
Sam, even Bobby, noticed cas’ absence from the home, as well as Dean's sour mood.
‘Okay, well, i’ll get you some dry clothes and you can stay here for the night cause its late, i'm not driving in that and you're not walking home with a cat in that.’
They talked about useless things.
Cas was half way out the door, yelling goodbyes to dean before he was stopped by dean as he yelled for cas to wait and walked up to him.
Sam said with a laugh, the only response he got was Dean flipping him off with a smile on his face.
Dean peeked around the corner of the place he was hearing the noises come from.
Cas seemed slightly relieved that Dean had yet to do..well anything to hurt him really.
“What shit ?!” Sam still didn't seem to pick up on Dean's tone.
Dean would rather be seen as a rude pig than have to discuss his 16 year old self emotions.
dean liked this. so did cas, the easy morning conversation and light touches.
Dean seemed to relax a little before tensing up again.
After a homemade dinner and some cuddles, dean and cas went to bed, dean soundly asleep still in cas’ clothes.
“You are a god amongst men, Dean winchester. Bye love you.”
He didn't know what was wrong, he didn't know if he was the cause, if Dean needed a hand or a shoulder. And it scared him knowing Dean was going through something and he couldn't help.
Cas explained what happened and Dean just burst out laughing.
‘Yeah.’
Sam rambled, Dean felt kinda bad, he was drunk and didn't really want to think about his brother, but Sam looked like he was going to either punch Dean or hug him.
“When did you have friends ?”
“Don't scare me like that!”
Dean - Yea !! sure dude whenever you wanna hangout i should be free :P
The title of the video intrigued cas ‘My true love’.
Meg obviously began screaming about cas and dean, even coming up with a ship name.
Working at the auto shop was actually pretty fun. The dudes there were pretty chill, lightly homophobic, but, survivable.
And it wasn't until one Sunday that they finally took a step forward on the relationship front.
Cas wasn't angry, so much as he was concerned.
As Dean signed off, cas kissed Dean's cheek and cuddled closer.
________________________________________________________
Caesar asked because he was rightfully curious.
When cas came in from work that day, took off his shoes and loosened his tie, he realized the entire apartment was dark, except little flickers of light around the home.
“Yes.”
He still didn't like chick flick moments, they were too touchy feely and Dean especially didn't want to tell sam how he found out, cause he knew sam would ask, and he knew sam would hunt down cas and make them discuss like it was damn therapy.
“Who would've guessed Dean Winchester would be a bottom.”
They were so close, so close, their noses were practically touching.
Dean laughs slightly again.
They have done that a lot. Flirt while Dean is filming and making Dean edit it out. They have a folder on Deans laptop of gay cut scenes, from flirting to make out sessions caught on camera.
Dean huffed out a laugh.
Cas didn't know what to do, so he just slid it under his pillow and went to sleep.
Meg seemed to be smiling like a devil.
So, he fell asleep, lying on top of his blankets, not even having taken his shoes off.
“Tell me dean. Or I will lock you in the last stall, and no one likes the last stall.”
‘No castiel.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas was honestly beginning to think that Dean truly didn't want to be his friend anymore.
It wasn't until, 20 minutes into dinner that cas finally asked.
“Dean Winchester ?!”
“Guys we’re filming!!”
He couldn't do it, he couldn't tell sam. It was just too much to let out to his baby brother, he couldn't deal with the possibility that the kid he raised would look at him differently.
Dean said, smiling, handing the flowers to cas.
“Why did you make me walk ?! Your lucky bobby came to get me, or I would be really mad.”
A random girl said.
Sam was right, that was Dean's regular routine, but Cas talked about a Bee documentary for 30 minutes straight and Dean couldn't break him with how bright his eyes got when he discussed how important they are.
Bobby and John walked inside. John just told Dean to meet him outside with Sam at 5.
“I'm...gay?”
Dean honestly couldn't handle Zachs dumbass, so he decided the one guy who could actually shut this kid up, his gay, veteran boyfriend.
Dean said, realizing that he fucked up.
“Wow Sammy, I thought you were meant to be the one who was emotional and shit between the two of us.”
“Just asking stuff like who was that, and debating if you're actually a guy or not.”
So he did the first thing he could think of.
Dean asked, giggling slightly because obviously something funny happened.
Dean tried to smile,but he was running on 2 hours of sleep, 3 cups of coffee, and anxiousness he had ruined everything.
But he had to.
“You know I have a ring I need to put on you, gotta follow the wise words of beyonce.”
Cas replied, slightly disheartened but happy Dean was smiling and giggling. Dean gave him a kiss and sent him to the shower to clean up and try to get rid of the scent of sweat and sex no matter how much dean enjoyed it.
Dean didn't say anything, though he was surprised how oblivious Sam could be for a smart lawyer man.
Dean was kinda surprised. Did they forget he was here ? Even Charlie was silent, a look of sheer dumbfoundery on her face, unfortunately, Zach took that as a sign to continue.
“For fucks sake are you really so damn weak you can't even push yourself back up. Now that's just sad. But what can you expect from a little fairy.”
Sam just gave him a bitch face, followed by a sigh.
Dean came through a few minutes later with three plates of sandwiches and three glasses of water.
So, Dean got a job with Bobby's friend Rufus, and Sam worked part time at the grocery store only a block away.
“If gay guys cant do anything ‘manly’ how has my bisexual ass been able to teach you mechanics ?”
Cas looked down at the cat, signalling that was the ‘him’ he was referring to.
He looked down to see this kid, probably the same age as him, looking like he had seen an angel, while slowly standing up, trying not to further hurt his already bruised bones.
Dean had to try and not begin cackling right there and then. Zach sat there, almost in shock someone had talked back to him.
“Well, your half normal, so that doesn't count.”
“Well, i have to begin to set up for my next few classes.”
“His name is castiel, and we've been together for almost 10 years. And now, it's gotten even better.”
“This isn't  funny dean.”
I am so sorry for leaving this for so long with no update especially when there was only one chapter i was just to lazy to finish this.
Dean was kinda surprised at first, but soon melted into it, this always helped clear his head.
Cas became stern again, a look of determination on his face, and Dean knew he couldn't escape it this time.
“Aw, babe you know how to treat a man.”
He knew they would be leaving, so he packed his stuff up, there wasn't much there to pack anyways.
“I need to go to the classroom to get my stuff.”
Aaron looked back after the comment to see Dean's reaction, because the way he reacted to him flirting with him seemed to indicate that he wasn't entirely straight.
Sam and Dean decided to move in together because dorms are already bad, but Sam was always concerned about Dean, and he knew for a fact he was sleeping in his car.
Cas said with a little smile and Dean was gonna melt.
"how long have you been awake?"
Charlie had a point.
“Ok angel.”
“Dean, you are going to have to tell me eventually, and i would wish it to happen before my coffee gets cold.”
“You're a pain in the ass, i'm going to sleep, you got to get to work.”
“I-I didn’t want to leave on bad terms...and i wanted to admit it to myself, i wanted to know i wasn't crazy, that it did happen. I wanted the comfort and content i thought i would get from it...it wasn't the most successful, heh.”
“...Dean, It's 7:45 on a Monday, you got work in 15 minutes.”
These suspicions were quickly answered when Dean finally got to cas and rapped one arm around cas’ waist.
John Winchester may have been their dad, and yes Dean did idolise him, even if he shouldn't, but nothing made Dean happier than going to their uncle Bobby's place.
“Jeez, who shit in your cereal?” Sam seemed to begin to pick up on Dean's tone.
Dean still kept giggling before opening his arms, inviting cas for cuddles. Cas gladly accepted. They sat there, cuddled up, doctor sexy playing in the background, both happy that it would be saturday tomorrow.
Here you go, I'm not gonna let my angel suffer stale coffee and tasteless school lunches.”
Charlie looked the guy up and down and smirked,
‘Jerk!’
Dean had left, he probably went back to bobbys, which was all the way on the outskirts of town.
To no one's surprise, meg masters spoke up first.
‘So more like you and cas then.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Scared it might be a fight of some kind he moved faster to get there and stop anyone from getting too injured.
Meg seemed pleased at the disgruntled sigh from her teacher as she walked towards him smirking devilishly.
When they got outside the front doors of the school, Dean was there, standing outside his car with a bouquet, and shyly waved at cas.
Little did they know of a small mistake on Dean's part as they were cuddled up peacefully in bed, and the first flood of comments that came flooding in.
Dean mumbled, which made both of them laugh.
Cas seemed satisfied with that answer.
Cas just froze, he couldn't move, he wanted to. He wanted to be brave like dean when they first met, but he couldn't move.
Cas said as he began to drag Dean off the floor and to the bedroom.
“Yeah, a little.”
Due to the open layout, while Cas was sitting on the couch he could see into the kitchen and talk to Dean and Charlie easily without shouting.
‘Hey, can we talk about what happened pls?’
Now Dean was curious, and ready to fight a hoe.
‘Uh, yeah, it is, heh.’
Sam mumbled before taking a drink of his beer.
“Suuuuuure, bye Mr Novak!”
‘And dean, sorry for assuming cas was a chick and all and uh, remember to keep the noise down, thin walls.’
So maybe Dean didn't come home that night much to Sam's anxiety. But he showed up the next morning, walking into the kitchen where Sam sat, coffee in hand looking like a distressed mother, with hickeys on his neck and a smile on his face.
TW - use of homophobic slur, it's only used once but still.
When it was just Sam and Dean, Dean would just drop Sam off then relax until time to pick Sam back up. Now at bobby's though, he had to go to high school. Bobby really was like their dad, which meant he was serious about ‘education’ and other stuff responsible parents care about.
“Yeah, yeah. Feel bad for whoever you were with though, you still smell like the garage.”
Cas knew how scary coming out can be, he knew how John made a horrible impact on Dean, and he knew that Dean would be crushed if Sam ended up turning on him.
Some students he loved to have in his class, like Alfie, then there were some that just decided to dig into his life just to get out of work, mainly a girl in his sophomore class named meg. She was actually very good but just didn't like to apply herself and was willing to say anything to get out of work.
He got up and began to walk down the hall, dragging his feet, hoping the stale coffee in the teachers lounge might wake him up enough to make it to the cafeteria. Until he heard insistent screams of excitement and a large crowd down the hall.
“I believe I should be asking you that, it's not even 8am, and to answer your question, receiving supplies for my home.”
“Are you two married?”
The absolute seriousness in Castiel's tone and face had dean almost cackling, and charlie and even Alfie very much cackling. Zach seemed thoroughly embarrassed enough to turn around and mumble what sounded like an apology.
Cas looked up to see a smiling dean leaning over the passenger side, and talking to cas through the window.
Cas said as he began to handout worksheets.
Dean sat up, and grabbed the sides of castiel's face, only inches apart.
That made Dean burst out laughing.
“I'm not, pouting.”
He never wanted to see his students outside of work, let alone his most intrusive student seeing him outside of school with a basket full of pie, cleaning supplies and condoms. Unfortunately he couldn't escape.
“I love you too angel.”
They both began to walk down the corridors, not entirely sure where they were going.
Cas returned to his classroom, lunch in hand. It wasn't until he was halfway through his PB&J that he realized what had happened, and that next period would not be fun.
Dean called up Bobby, who said he had a friend who had a mechanic shop not too long away from a two bedroom apartment Sam was eyeing.
Though, at least Garth was chill.
But he still had a fucking night class, and Sam would kill him if he didn't go.
“But there has to be like, a real reason.”
Then he heard Dean, screaming profanities, then the metal clanking of someone being pushed against the lockers.
“But there is a sex life ?”
“Thanks, but you can go now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So everyone. This is my boyfriend, castiel, or cas.”
“Fucked up ??”
After Sam and Dean were dragged off by their dad again, Dean became surprisingly closed off for a few weeks.
Cas said, pouting, before laughing slightly as well.
As I just sat there, laughing slightly under his breath as he ate his sandwich.
Dean exclaimed over dramatically.
It wasn't until after sam left for stanford that the side of dean that would watch reruns of gunner lawless’ matches just to see him in tight spandex because without sam there for him to help with school work, cook for, raise, he didn't have anything to distract his brain.It had been years since dean mey cas and had a not so small gay (or well, bi) awkening.
“They were just saying some shit about...you...so i tried to beat them up, turns out one of the dudes was packing a knife, and i left mine in my car.”
All the kids and Charlie were  awing, or taking pictures, until the bell rang then they were off.
Alfie was a quiet kid, but surprisingly good in Deans class. Dean, being Dean, was the teacher many students came to when they were going through something. One day, Alfie came to him, almost in tears because of how scared he was because he thought he might be gay. Dean felt bad for the kid, he knew that panic and was more than happy to help the kid, as well as tell him that if anything happens, he was always there to help.
Sunday morning began as normal, with one big difference though. Dean was awake before cas. This rarely happened as cas always woke up at the ass crack of dawn.
Or that's what they thought.
Dean quickly ushered cas inside, as Sam came up to the random man now standing in front of the door.
Dean looked up and saw a giggling cas, and attempted to politely make his way to him, everyone of the kids confused but intrigued as to why their youtube icon was making his way towards a teacher.
“How do you know ?”
Bobby opened the door, and found a tired looking castiel, shivering slightly on his porch.
Dean said over dramatic and comical.
Rufus was slightly pissed since he cut it so close. The other guys kept saying shit about the hickey, and the customers were shit. Ranging from boring stuff they could've done at home, to someone who had never cleaned their car in 3 years, to customers being annoying.
Cas knew he would help Dean clean, he just couldn't say no to him.
Dean went up to the door, only to open it to a drenched cas, with scratches along his face, pajama bottoms and shirt, trenchcoat torn slightly, little bits of blood dried into the bottom of the sleeves of the trenchcoat and a shivering ball of fur held costly to his chest.
Soon cas and his entire class followed by charlies and her because she had heard it and jumped on the bandwagon.
It has been weeks since that first time Sam said anything.
It was actually really good.
“Now stop reading you nerd and cuddle me!!”
“Yeah maybe even in that maid outfit you tried to make me wear when you thought you were a top.”
Sam was sitting on the couch, watching something boring probably, with a knowing smirk on his face.
Dean couldn't help but smile as cas sleepily kissed his jaw before snuggling in and slowly falling fast asleep, snoring lightly like the kitten currently resting in the living room.
Cas hesitantly sat down, kinda confused on the whole thematics.
“DEAN POSTED A NEW VIDEO!”
“What about me then?”
“Soooooo...what...what do you want to know ??”
Dean just shrugged and yelled at Sam to hurry up as he went to sit outside.
Cas had talked to dean during his lunch over the phone, they talked about meaningless stuff, but they also discussed what questions are probably gonna be asked during cas’ next classes.
“Hey everybody! So i bet most of you are wondering about the person who interjected during the last video with charlie.”
‘WHOS ANGEL?!?!?!?’
“You ok cas ?!”
Dean said as he pointed at the lasagna and pulled a chair out for him.
‘Yeah, yeah, okay thanks and all but that's all the chick flick moments used up for the year.’
“I’ll make you coffee if you stop whining.”
Cas laughed, holding his left hand out for Dean to put the ring on him.
The kiss became deeper, but both knew this time, it wouldn't lead anywhere, just kisses then go down into the kitchen where dean would make breakfast for Sam and cas, holding cas' hand under the table, hoping Sam doesn't realise.
Sam asked. It wasn't in an accusatory tone, but a concerned and curious one.
Then he saw Dean, sitting down at the tiny dining table they never used with candles and even in a suit.
Cas sat next to Dean on the bed, where Dean laid his arm across cas’ shoulders.
He got home, took a shower, got into new clothes and got shit for class ready.
‘Um...kinda, yeah.’
So, he did.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean! Dean!”
Three dudes were mocking and kicking this lump of clothes on the floor is what it looked like, but dean knew there was derinatley some poor kid under there, and he reached a whole new level of anger when the douche on the far left crouched down and fucking spat in this kids face.
The kid just looked tired, and sad.
Cas breathed a sigh of relief and walked off to pay for his items.
It was his last class, his sophomore class. He decided to give them a free period and push the test to thursday.
‘Sam you take the cat, I sort him out.’
Dean and cas laugh slightly.
________________________________________________________
Cas said, slowly loosening his tie slightly.
"Not long."
“Why you out here so early with a basket full of cleaning supplies and food.”
Dean asked, he was honestly curious why cas wasn't in class, he looked like a geek sorta kid, Dean thought he’d be like Sam, so eager to go to school.
Cas could see Dean slowly deflate.
Meg screeched, and looked at cas. He already knew what he was gonna ask so he already started putting the video on the board.
‘Who is this cas?’
Dean says suggestively, giggling after with Charlie making a disgusted look beside him.
Dean burst out laughing of course.
Dean Winchester just kissed castiel novak.
When Cas returned with damp hair and in a borrowed pair of deans fluffy plaid pj bottoms, he was greeted by the intoxicating scent of bacon, eggs and toast.
Then cas simply told dean that they were going to a place where he could tell cas why he up and left because, ‘a pretty vague note wasn't enough of a reason’ according to cas, and dean understood, he did, but God almighty he didn't want to sit down with cas and talk about emotions and the past.
‘I thought cas is you’re gay thing.’
Meg asked. Cas was slightly terrified and didn't know what to say. He didn't want to tell a bunch of kids he fucks their favourite youtuber, and he didn't want to out dean. Thankfully Charlie came to the rescue.
He told cas about his dad, both how he was a homophobic asshole and how he came to bobby's that day, telling him and Sam to pack up and leave, and he did.
“Yeah, charlies coming ‘round tomorrow, I need to do editing.”
“Okay, i might have fucked up, please don't be mad.”
“Ok, ok.”
It wouldn't be the first time.
Dean seemed shocked by that statement.
‘Your girlfriend and friend have the same name.’
“I could never be mad at you. What happened?”
Dean's statement  actually made cas huff out a laugh, it was endearing, almost cute, like a kitten, at least to dean it seemed that way.
Instead, it just worsened them. They always say forbidden fruit is the most appealing.
He knew Sam knew what he was doing, but Sam knew not to push.
Dean and cas giggle at that.
He knew he was bi for years after his little thing with cas.
“What's your name kid?”
“Cas, babe, be in my video ??”
Charlie only rolled her eyes.
So obviously Dean had to be the one to give him the car.
“Does he have hickeys all over his neck.”
“The demon kid from your class that asks way too personal questions?”
Cas wasn't even walking anymore, so he made himself continue walking down the street to bobbys.
Sam took the little kitten from this castiel guy, who seemed oddly familiar, but he just couldn't put his finger on it as he took the little cat to the kitchen to clean him as dean led cas to the bathroom.
He didn't want to sit on a dirty bathroom floor, but he just didn't understand.
________________________________________________________
How couldn't he be? Dean kissed him then ran off, and cas new how confusing and scary a sudden gay panic can be.
Dean was giggling under his breath as he made his way to his room. He had never been more glad to give his number to a guy, just the way cas typed messages like mini letters was incredibly endearing.
The dude doubled over, and the sheer stink eye dean above the rest of them was enough for them to pick up their friend just beginning to pull himself off the floor, whispering shouting insults.
"Come on honey, lets go get breakfast."
Cas - That would be perfectly acceptable. I will pick you up. Sincerely, Castiel.
Dean pouted as cas giggled and kissed Dean's cheek then hooked his finger at the front collar of his uni jumper to expose Dean's neck.
dean couldn't help but smile and giggle slightly, he could feel cas smile back.
Dean asked with pleading eyes.
Of course it had consequences.
He got in his baby and he drove.
He became a ladies man, detached and the epitome of toxic masculinity.
He got home from the night class at roughly 11 that night. He came into the apartment, text cas about how cas wanted to be a beekeeper one day, or maybe volunteer to help one. Dean couldn't help but smile slightly down at his phone as cas rambled about the environmental importance of bees.
Shit. This made cas blush like a damn tomato. Why couldn't he have worn a turtle neck, dean had hidden hickeys before.
“Yeah. thankfully she didn't ask anything, but I never thought I would have to attempt to hide a box of condoms under sponges and pie from a student.”
Cas had a soft look on his face after dean told him that, so deen said the next thing in a hushed tone.
Maybe he just couldn't be friends with the openly gay kid, maybe he couldn't deal with the gossip or having to constantly protect cas, or maybe cas was just annoying.
While Dean wanted to throw his head into a wall because he’s a dumbass, Sam decided to speak up.
Probably one hell of a beating.
“Watch me. I think the videos finished uploading.”
Before Dean could even get a word in, Sam began spewing shit.
Dean smiled one of those cocky smiles.
Cas said in a tired voice.
Now cas’ was confused, nervous and excited.
Cas said as he kissed deans cheek and walked out to the car, but not before he heard dean call back a,
He seemed unsure, as if all of a sudden, Dean would turn on him.
Cas’ car was the last of the day, Rufus wouldn't care since Dean was finished, and cas had that look crossed between a pouting puppy and an angel about 0.5 seconds away from smiting him.
Dean said, not really thinking as he grabbed 3 plates and glasses.
He heard footsteps coming up stairs where Dean was.
“You're so pretty, pretty eyes, pretty face, i bet your pretty all over.”
When Dean returned, he came back to a cosy castiel with a blanket, popcorn and the first season of Dr sexy ready to play.
“Awwwww, your pouting.”
Cas returned home and heard the chaos in the kitchen. He set the bag of supplies by the door and took his shoes off at the door, going to sit on the couch in the living room as Dean and Charlie made a mess in the kitchen.
Hopefully this chapter was good !! :))
‘Either way, I'm gonna make some PB&Js.’
The kid looked so proud of himself for that one. Dean was getting annoyed, but what finally tipped Dean over the edge was seeing Alfie become so tense.
Of course, Dean being Dean, tried to challenge Cas to a drinking game, which left two very intoxicated dumbasses going up to Cas’ apartment without falling down 3 flights of stairs.
“Ok, love you.”
‘You guys argue like brothers.’
cas only chuckled, as dean turned a new shade of red.
Dean only groaned before saying.
Neither know who started it, but neither of them were planning on stopping it.
It was at least an hours walk to bobbys, so cas went off, putting his headphones in to block the thoughts of, well everything that had happened.
“Why?”
“Dean.”
The bell had rang minutes earlier, and now everyone was seated in their classrooms, well, besides cas.
Cas asked, laughing as Dean jumped at cas’ entrance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“See you at lunch.”
“Well, let’s never mention that chick-flick moment and, catch up or some shit.”
Sam noticed immediately, but Dean just said he missed having his own room at bobbys and smiled, and Sam didn't push. He knew Dean better than that.
"ok angel."
The next 15 minutes were filled with Sam, Cesar and Jesse discussing how many times team free will had died and how Castiel was obviously in love with dean and vice versa.
It was a beautiful ring. A silver band, but instead of a plain silver band, the ends were wings, one wing above and one below, with a blue gem between the two.
Dean sat down next to him, watching the brothers on the screen as he got quickly engrossed in the show until he heard a loud knock on the door which made both of them jump.
‘Hey cas. Um, sorry for running off. Sorry for kissing you well not really.  Hopefully you don't hate me too much. I just didn't want to leave on horrible terms and hopefully you see this. But well, bye. And make sure to use that shit I taught you against those dickweeds. Sincerely dean.’
And cas kissed back.
It was his last period, which was with his sophomore class, with meg.
Kevin said. Kevin was an amazingly smart kid, and Cas was happy he did something other than study.
their happy little world however was ruined by a dumb moose.
“Just gotta ruin such a romantic moment, dontcha.”
“Who said it was a girl.”
Dean replies, giggling slightly.
One of the students pipes up. Whispers began to travel around the classroom about Dean's mysterious lover, until Meg speaks.
Dean said as he began to grab cas’ trenchcoat and help him get it off.
“Gotta get to work, please don't somehow blow up the house when im at work.”
Cas didn't even know if Dean wanted to be friends anymore, if maybe all the rumours and gossip about cas had finally gotten to him.
“Now bed.”
Deans dad may be a homophobic ass hole, but bobby nailed it into deans head that you accept people and that's the end of that.
“Hey are you, like, okay?”
“Nothing cas, can you just, leave me alone.”
‘Cause y’know, dad and shit. I know you say you don't care when it comes to like, your friends and shit, but what if it is different with me?’
‘I wouldn't do that to you! You're my brother, you're the one person who I could never hurt!’
“I kinda forgot to edit the part when we were sort of flirting out and now people are commenting about it and I'm sorry I know you didn't want to be in any of my videos yet so please forgive me ?”
After sam left, john wasnt around much after, he practically just told dean to fuck off and do whatever he pleased.
Hopefully this is good, since its been a while since i have updated. And thank you too everyone who has supported this dumb fic, whether through comments, bookmarks, kudos etc. it means a lot :))
Cas walked through to the living room, where he saw a somewhat stressed dean scrolling through comments. Now Cas was worried, Dean loved his audience, and if he was stressed about the fans, then he was not doing well.
“Nah, i’ll stick around.”
Cas came home to Dean watching tv cuddled up on the couch in cas’ uni jumper.
Cas was miserable the whole week. Dean didn't contact him at all.
Bobby trusted dean, but he also new the boy could be a dumb as a doornail, so of course he checked the note.
It was close to 11 at night when Dean came home.
‘So i get upset when my friend dies, doesn't mean i love him.’
‘Cas is this angel guy who literally rebelled against all of heaven for dean adn he even said they have a ‘profound bond’ and this dickhead (directed towards dean) is practically married to him, and dean before you say anything, you grieve like a fucking widowed wife everytime he dies so don’t even try.’
...soooo...long time no see.
‘Yeah everthings fine.’
Cas smirked.
The sheer devilish smirk on meg's face, and the blush on cas’ was more than enough to answer those questions.
Sam said teasingly, heading to his room to sleep.
Not to mention, cas was a dude. Oddly enough, this wasn't the factor that made dean absolutely say no, honestly, he didn't really care that cas was a dude, but he knew his dad would.
Dean knew he was bi.
Dean asked, spooked.
This left cas blushing even more, and made more whispers carry ‘round the room, some opposed to the idea others agreeing.
Cas was so worried, thoughts about what went through Dean's head, what Dean was doing now.
And the video ended.
Dean was lying. Cas knew he was lying.
‘Jesus ! get in here before you fucking freeze to death.’
They talked about deans night classes, cas’ wish to quit his job and adopt a cat, they enjoyed it.
Cas was severely regretting his promise. He promised his class that if they finished the handout then they could chat or go on their phones and what not. Now he was left with 30 teenagers screaming, until Meg piped up.
________________________________________________________
Cas said as he looked down, only to find Dean staring at him.
Dean asked, worried slightly.
Sam said, wiggling his eyebrows and dean just looked at the ground.
“We’re engaged. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him and I couldn't be happier. So cas and cas’ class that i know are watching this, come outside.”
“Are you two, like, together together?”
“In here.”
“Hello Dean.”
After about a month of this friendship, Dean realised maybe, he wanted something more.
Yeah dean was fucking furious.
Sam said, with a mix of a tired parent and the giddy younger brother he was.
Dean said, trying to act cool.
Dean couldn't help but grab cas neck and pull him in closer.
Dean smirked.
After the events on the couch, Cas decided to attempt to make Dean some breakfast. Yeah, that ends with cas on Dean's shoulders attempting to shut the damn fire alarm off.
“So, um, castiel james novak, will you always stay with me, and marry me ?”
Dean said before going back to eating his burger, trying to hide his small blush because of course time had agreed with Cas, he looked like a fucking male model, all dressed up in suit, while dean sat there (‘barbecue sauce on my titties’ sorry, i saw a chance and took it), face covered in sauce, smelling of sweat and oil because the universe hates him.
Cas walked in and saw Dean still filming.
It had, and Cas turned over to turn the bedside lamp off.
“Wonder what kind of car he drives?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, yes i am dating someone, but they are camera shy, and i'm sorta posting this without them knowing, and yeah. Just, please don't go all stalker on me, and allow us some privacy…”
Cas - Hello Dean, I enjoyed today and would enjoy future outings. Sincerely, Castiel
Cas didn't know how to help Dean relax, so he did the first thing that came to mind and kissed him.
also, please leave suggestions of destiel fanfic prompts you want if you have anything in particular you want to see.
He was simply walking up and down the hallways, he didn't want to see Dean this period, so he just wandered, until he heard yelling.
She was talking about the pride parade she was going to with one of her friends, they were in the I.T. rooms since they were having to make a presentation, when a kid, Zach, butted into the conversation.
Sam was sitting on the couch in the living room of their apartment.
And in front of the lockers sat a bruised and slightly bloody dean Winchester.
“Yeah, just gonna be here for a month or two, just staying with my uncle bobby for a while.”
“Dean, why are you avoiding me.”
That night, Dean and cas were lying in bed. Cas reading and dean happily staring at his beautiful boyfriend,
Rufus was actually pretty decent, if you gave him a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.
“Don't worry dean. You don't have to lie.”
“Um, so, yeah, kinda. Ok. So we have been together for almost ten years. Since damn highschool. And i love you so goddamn much, i would die for you. And i want to stay with you, forever, so um…”
It was then he heard what deans video was about.
He didn't know how he ended up outside sams door at 3am after not talking for almost 6 months.
“Cmon sam, dads here. Get packed.” Dean sounded almost emotionless, like he was on autopilot.
“How long have you two been dating?”
Dean sat down, and began a conversation about nothing in particular.
“I want an explanation, an actual explanation on why. I finally have a chance to get the truth, I’m not going to pass this up, and I'm not going to let you half ass an answer.”
Dean wasn't sure why he wanted to hide the fact he saw Castiel again, he was sure Sam had forgotten entirely about cas, but he didn't want to integrate these two parts of his life.
Dean said, beginning to head off to the school, until Dean grabbed his hand. Dean simply looked at him, confused as kids came pouring out of the school.
He continued that pattern until he deemed to have kissed each freckle across deans face, finally planting a light, lazy kiss to his lips.
Now the dean was blushing.
dean was slightly startled from cas' sudden awakening.
He tore out a piece of paper from one of his school books and a pencil, and wrote a note for cas. He didn't know if cas would stop by, but even if he didnt, at least he could get it off his chest.
Cas didn't mean to spam dean, but he was worried.
“What! Cas! Of course you're worth it!”
Dean said, his blush growing slightly.
Dean kissed cas’ head before falling into a peaceful sleep away from the worries of the world.
After seeing Alfie all tense, dean had to speak up,
“Are you okay dean?”
“Too bad, pack.”
Sam said, with the annoying, teasing little brother tone.
Dean rose off the coach, leaving the plates on the table.
Then it cut to deans proposal, he had set up cameras.
Dean just nodded.
Sam and cas talked merrily just like how it was years ago, sam and cas talking excitedly while dean was stuck in the middle not so covertly staring at cas.
The visits were always few and far between now that John decided that Dean and Sam could be left in a different state from him now. Though Bobby hated John doing that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you staring at ?”
When dean returned from the date getting messages of cas saying he heard what sounded like meowing in a bush, dean couldn't help but laugh slightly as he told him not to go out unless he wants to be a guy who dies in the horror movie or attacked by a racoon.
“67 chevy impala, and don't ever get dean winchester started on his car, he’ll never shut up about it.”
Cas answered without thinking. It wasn't until after he realized what he had said.
‘Welp, tell her i wish her luck.’
...sooooooo, this chapter is just a tad bit late...apologise. I just sorta, forgot this existed and schools been stressful, but imma try and throw the last few chapter out between today and tomorrow, but knowing me, this probably wont be finished until 2022 hehe. but, i hope this lives up to expectations :))
“Are you new? I've never seen you around before.”
“Yeah yeah.”
That's it, the end. If anyone wants an epilogue, leave a comment and i'll write one. But thank you to everyone who has left a kudos, bookmarked or anything to support this little fic :)
When will cas learn his lesson about letting his students have free time.
20 minutes later, Dean heard a car outside. He pulled himself off the bed, and saw his dad talking to bobby outside in the front yard.
Dean decided that Cas would probably head to bed after he replied so he decided to simply put his phone on charge and reply in the morning, a good thing to wake up on Saturday too.
He just wanted to help his friend. Did he find Dean incredibly attractive with fanfiction green eyes and freckles, and yes he may have been harbouring a small crush.
Cas moved slightly to pat his head.
(Smut would be here, but, idk how to write, if you want it, comment and i'll add it at the end of the fic. All that's really important is cas left hickeys, a lot.)
Dean blushed slightly, cas could see it but he didn't bring it up. Instead disinfecting a cut on the dean's cheek.
By the time cas had finished his tale, Dean had wrapped up his arms and gave him a towel to dry off a bit.
“Yeah. Fine.”
I mean, he wasn't gonna pass up this opportunity to see who had this absolute gem.
Zach became very quiet before replying with,
That got deans attention, he smiled and nodded his head yes, still not getting out of bed.
cas leaned down and kissed deans messy bed head.
Everyone was in shock, not only by the fact they were dating, but that Mr Novak was dating Mr Winchester. The cool, funny, nerdy, layed back mechanics teacher was dating the sarcastic, socially inept, baby in a trench coat history teacher. Or that
“Hello meg.”
Cas loved his job, when he had a good class. As it turns out, kids would rather vandalise the desks and scream than do any actual work.
“Love you too.”
This is the last chapter. Hopefully it's a good one. And a special thank you to @Flowery_meadows2811 for all the comments on every chapter, it was really encouraging and made me so happy, so, thank you.
“Yeah, think so. Know what, let's surprise ‘im, i'm gonna upload it now.”
It was worse when John noticed.
“This, is my awesome, bad ass, fully gay, veteran boyfriend.”
If Sam ever asked, he would say it never happened, or that he doesn't like shit like cuddles.
So Dean did the only thing he could think of at that moment.
‘So are you finally gonna talk to me about the boyfriend situation?’
Cas could only cave with those eyes.
Cas kisses Dean's forehead and begins to head for the door.
“Um, is dean home.”
Everyone was very confused as dean picked up the phone, talked to someone for a minute, hung up and then looked at Zach like he had just caught him in a checkmate.
“Well I want ‘my man’ to keep making me breakfast.”
They would partner on projects in classes, they went to each other's houses, though cas normally went to deans to escape the ruckus of his family, the whole shebang. They were best friends, Dean even taught cas shit he had learned to defend himself.
Cas sat in his bedroom, note in hand, trying to hype himself up to read the damn thing.
“You sure you wanna hang around the ‘cock sucking fairy’?”
‘More like an old married couple.’
“Well, thank you mr singer.” cas said, voice quiet, but before he could  leave booby yelled him back.
“I'm fine just leave me alone Sam, please?”
Throughout the time dean and cas were friends, dean fought off every one who even looked at cas the wrong way, and cas helps dean with school work.
“I mean, at least lesbians are hot, but gay dudes. I mean they can't even do anything ! like no gay guy could do something like mechanics or manly shit.”
Dean whispered, burrowing his face into cas’ back as he poured the hot water into two mugs.
Dean ran to his car, thoughts running threw his head.
‘Shit Cas, I gotta go, night classes.’
“Making some now hun.”
Cas loved mornings like these, though he still had a classroom to teach.
Cas seemed annoyed. Not angry, just confused and kinda hurt. Did he do something to annoy dean?
The colour from deans face vanished as he released, he was fucked. Sam just smirked.
Cas said, with a straight face.
“Fucking fairy.”
They had a short lesson since cas could not put up with this and just gave them questions to answer then free time when they were done.
It wasn't the best shift. It was probably his least favourite.
It was a lovely morning, birds singing, sun shining, flowers blooming and best of all, a handsome shirtless man wrapped around cas’ waist like an adorable koala.
“What were you doing dean. 3 on 1? did you want to get your ass beat!”
Dean got to work with 2 minutes to spare.
Cas - alright. Sincerely, Castiel.
By the time he left, he promised Rufus a bottle of whiskey and wanted to sleep for a week.
Lies, of course.
‘He just doesnt know you’re a guy.’
After a few hours of talking, dean steering away from the relationship talk and cas and sam following, knowing this wasn't something they could push dean to talk about.
“Hey it's ok. I'm not ecstatic about it, but please don't be upset, what are people saying.”
When he finally got into his baby, he just sat there. Trying to rap his head around everything that just happened in the last 5 minutes.
Meg rolled her eyes.
It was a nice moment, rudely interrupted by the fact of why they were here in the first place.
“Dean ?”
sorry i vanished, but here's the next chapter, hopefully its not too bad.
“We get it, your a gay, will you shut up about it ?!”
He got one hell of a surprise.
Sam stood up holding the little kitten and silently guiding cas to the living room where the show is still playing.
________________________________________________________
Cas just giggled and fixed his bag.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes.”
Dean looks after Sammy, the end. So he had to ‘get over this pansy shit’ as John put it.
When he got out he was far too excited to see a message from Cas.
Dean mumbled.
He never told Sam of course, he researched, so he heard horror story after horror story and while he knew Sam would never beat him up, or shoot him or something, he also didn't want Sam to look at him differently.
Dean just stood there with a look of confusion and a you can figure this out dumbass expression.
He said as he pointed to cas’ face and bruises.
He was about 10 seconds away from chasing the fuckers down until he felt his flannel being tugged lightly.
“See you at home babe, i got your favourite ice cream for dessert.”
The morning started as always. Just a regular tuesday, heat of the moment softly playing through the house on the kitchen radio.
Sometimes not even clubs.
Dean replied, smiling sincerely. Cas was as red as a tomato and dean just kissed his cheek and snuggled closer.
“No, no, nononononono, cas, it's just, stuff, just need a little personal space for a little bit, don't worry about it.”
Cas just looked over to dean. He looked ready to kill a bitch, yet cas couldn't help but find it cute, he looked like a cartoon character, his face turning a slightly red shade.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was silently hoping that would be enough to shut this kid up, unfortunately he wasn't so lucky.
Dean and Cas were cuddled up in bed, Cas reading a book and Dean editing.
“Back to work!”
Next period was oddly quiet. Even meg masters wasn't interrupting his lesson.
Cas took the note and bobby gave him a lift home.
He was not so lucky.
He seemed cautious, but Dean picked up cas’ bag and gave it to him.
“HEY MR NOVAK!”
Either way, hope the chapter okay and worth the wait (it isn't) and be sure to check the notes at the end.
“Don't worry. If it helps, my entire sophomore class supports you, a little more than whole heartedly.”
“I never heard you complain.”
After another minute, cas finally pulled himself together.
________________________________________________________
When cas got home, he didn't see Dean on the couch as normal.
Cas said as he opened the door, and took a seat next to dean.
Cas asked dean. Dating a well-known youtuber meant knowing that if you come back to your boyfriend and best friend in wigs doing ddr and singing with blow up microphones, it was a calm day.
“You nervous about the video today.”
“I'm not sure, dean.”
He didn't need to leave for a good few hours and Sam was still at school.
It was calm at first, sitting at one of the few free tables having drinks and chatting, Dean about the guys he worked with and how he was worried the new guy Garth was gonna get beat, and Castiel talking about how his boss Zachariah was horrendous and how he would happily smite him if he had the ability to.
And then dean came on screen, current dean.
“Since the last year of highschool.”
Sam didn’t respond, instead talking to the cat in a baby voice.
“YES. NOW LEAVE PLEASE.”
Dean said, quiet.
“Damn, you think his girlfriend did all that?”
As he was grabbing some … stuff, for Dean and himself he saw Meg at the end of the aisle, and immediately turned around.
So Dean explained, pretty poorly with jokes that were not the best. Explained that he was bi, that during their time together in high school, cas was the first guy that he had to face that he had a crush on romantically, not a celebrity who he write off that he admired, not an older guy he could say he just idolised, nothing to get him out of the feelings, and he was 16 and didn't know how to deal with that, so he ran.
Dean kissed him, then ran off.
Sam stormed into the room, not pissed, but definitely not happy.
“An angel.”
“No.”
He hoped that maybe dean was still in the student parking lot.
“Have you finished the video ?”
Then the video cut to when cas was in the coming out video.
“So blue, even have gold in ‘em.”
Cesar seemed upbeat and bright while Jesse looked ready to punch Dean depending on his reaction.
He said with a slight giggle towards his older brother.
And within a blink of an eye, Dean was running out the bathroom to his car, muttering the word sorry, over and over again trying not to cry.
Meg obviously said. This left cas desperately trying not to laugh hysterically. This was one hell of a class.
Dean said in a lighthearted tone.
Dean said in one breath, then looking down like he had done the worst thing in the universe.
One dean was terrified to get it.
Dean began to shuffle more, he began to move off his seat, and cas still confused and oblivious, until Dean was on one knee.
Destiel.
“For them, it's reason enough.”
“So, yeah. Im bi, and this is my boyfriend.”
Cas realized this was all of the cutscenes from previous videos. He was slightly concerned in case Dean showed one of the more heated cut scenes.
Cas woke up at his usual time, which was, according to Dean, too damn early to function. Cas wasn’t a fan of waking up early on a weekend either, but sleeping patterns are a bitch to break.
Cas said, and he could see deans shoulders relax at the comment.
________________________________________________________
He pulled out his phone, ignoring the other notifications on his phone and texted sam, ‘your gonna have to walk home’.
He didn't want to be a dick to his brother, but right now, all he wanted was to sleep in his bed at bobbys, and just, not think.
Cas and dean had discussed that cas wouldn't tell his class. He was confused why, but he didnt question it.
Dean asked. Cas simply looked at him with a face of pure ‘you cant be that dumb’.
Cas said as he leaned his head against dean's shoulder.
He didn't want to leave but if he didn't he would never hear the end of it from Sam.
Cas turned around, unravelling the blankets to allow Dean under them before cuddling against Dean's chest.
He gave them to cas who was still sitting in the bathroom, handed them to him and told him to meet them in the kitchen area.
Dean smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes and cas could tell he felt bad about it, and he couldn't hold a grudge, not when Dean's green eyes looked so dull.
‘Is it okay?’
When one sunday cas asked about sam, remembering about him from when they were kids, dean ended up blabbing about him how cas does about bees.
Dean only lived up the road from the bar, and Cas in the apartment blocks just next door apparently.
"Guys get th- sorry."
It was the third period on a Monday during June that this little incident played out. Charlie was in deans mechanics class, she was more into computers than fixing cars but, she had to take it, luckily, dean and charlie were both nerdy enough to make charlie enjoy the class.
Dean replied, smirking.
‘That your date?’
When they finally got into cas’ apartment, they flopped onto his couch, deans head in cas’ lap.
‘Sooooo, how was the date?’
Dean held out the note.
He already had to deal with his dad the entire month of June mumbling gay slurs under his breath. He couldn't imagine what would happen if he came home with a dude.
‘Alright Dean, I can walk home so you wont be more late, I hope you have a good night.’
Sorry, this probably isn't gonna be the best but hopefully it's enjoyable. Also sorry this chapter is slightly shorter.
Dean just sat there, cheeks stained red as he grumbled and drank his beer.
Cas said and walked out with charlie, thanking her profusely for getting him out of that sticky situation.
“Your just mad my gay ass has slept with more girls than you.”
“Surprise them? How? You barely have a schedule.”
“Where have you been ? You normally come home quick so you don't have to smell like sweat all day.”
‘Dean please respond’
‘He doesn't remember you, i, uh, have told him about you though.’
Though seeing what he goes through, I can't imagine school is fun.
Now cas was intrigued, silently listening in on the video.
So Dean did, he stuffed all the feelings deep down until he didn't have to look at it.
‘Where did you get the cat? And why did you bring it here instead of your apartment?’
“Hey bobby, if cas comes by, can you give him this please?”
Everytime they hung out, they would fall more for each other.
“Night angel, i love you too.”
Sam was about ten minutes away from tearing his eyeballs out if he and Dean went to a diner and Dean practically fucked the waitress with his eyes again.
Cas said. He liked dean, and even if it was only for a month or two he wanted to keep dean close.
He was working on a random car.
The video began to play, but it wasn't dean, well it was, but it was an older video. The one where Dean was telling a story of Sam's trip to the ER after some superhero accidents. Though it was the cut scene.
‘Fuck you.’
Dean replies.
Dean wasn't scared of many things, but falling for someone, a guy no less! It was terrifying to him.
Dean understood why cas was so adamant to get Dean to answer, it's one of those scenarios that you fantasise about, being able to get answers from people you are likely never to see again.
