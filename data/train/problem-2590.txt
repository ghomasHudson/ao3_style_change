“How do you think he earned his nickname—Three Continents Watson?”
“Yes…” he finally manages.
—but it’s more than that, it’s different than any climate Sherlock has smelled before, it smells… wilder somehow, brighter, richer. Threaded through the scents he recognizes are dozens that are new to him—wild smells, tropical smells, complicated and teeming with life.
“Good. I’m not sure I can keep this up, otherwise.”
The moment his knee sinks into the mattress, he forgets all of his displeasure.
He’s starting to wonder if he maybe he should go look for him, when Lestrade, seeing Sherlock waiting by the gangway, crosses the deck towards him, a bemused expression on his face.
more, so Sherlock opens his mouth against John’s, pushing his tongue into John’s mouth, his hands moving between them, slipping under the worn material of John’s shirt to feel the heat of John’s bare chest against his palms.
, John thought, half-mortified, half more aroused than ever as he ducked his head sharply away from the window, hoping that his hat shrouded most of the blush on his face.
It’s because John is like no one he has ever met. John is fascinating, contradictory, like a sudden beam of sunlight in an otherwise darkened room. Sherlock yearns to know everything about him—where he came from, what interests him, how he came to be the man he is today. But more than any of that—which Sherlock wants with every fiber of his being—he is realizing that he wants John to be interested in him too. For John to take notice of him, to
He turns his hand so that the back of it is pressed against the wood, tilting his palm up until it fits neatly against John’s.
He wants to make John feel better but he doesn’t know what to say.
Billy nods again, tucking the handkerchief into his pocket.
Embarrassed about what?
“Y-Yes, sir.”
Still, he hesitates. His fear of their derision is like a shadow hanging over him, haunting his every movement.
He gasps, the sudden return of his breath hurting his lungs.
He could feel sweat along his hairline, as though the power of the memory had actually carried him back to that day under the heat of the desert sun.
He cannot remember the last time he felt this afraid.
But even as his rational mind tries to convince him everything is fine, he cannot seem to shake the lingering feeling of dread the dream left in its wake, and he’s overcome with the desire to see John.
“Let me—” He watched Sherlock lick his lips, his eyes dropping to John’s mouth as the hand that was on John’s bicep moved down between them, sliding hot along John’s hip. “Can I…?”
“I believe you. I believe you! Sherlock!”
There isn’t much to put away so it doesn’t take him very long—the most time-consuming task is picking up the shards of glass scattered over the floor.
The room at the top of the house, he’d said. John slid the key into his pocket. He’d been holding it so tightly in his hand that the pattern at the key’s base left a mark in the center of his palm. He stared at it a moment longer, then flexed his fingers.
Part of him feels ashamed that he’s doing this, not an hour after he just came between John’s thighs, but he cannot help himself, it’s as if John has awakened something within him that has always been there, slumbering and dangerous, just out of sight, that now refuses to go back to sleep.
Hope you liked it!
in order to dodge the curious gazes of her fellow-passengers.
“LAY OFF!”
“What? You don’t like it?” Marty Jones eyed Sherlock with a sadistic glint in his eye. “You from the RSPCA or something?”
Sherlock watches as Billy stoops to lift the heavy coil of rope and sling it over his shoulder, before climbing back up into the rigging.
Even so, it does not take long for Sherlock to feel himself approaching the edge of his release—there are too many factors working against him—it’s not just the warm pressure of John’s stroking fist, the steel of John’s thighs underneath his own, the water all around him—it’s also the tantalizing slide of John’s cock between his arse cheeks, the head of it nudging again and again against his arse hole, making him want to push back against it.
He pauses only a moment to think back over everything John has taught him; about what he remembers of John’s reactions the first time he did this, and finds that even the memory of the act is enough to make a pang of desire move through him, sharp and searing.
Maybe he has made a grave mistake, but for now, all that matters is that Anderson will be removed from his position.
John took both of Sherlock’s hips in his hands. “You ready?”
Even John’s script looks more agitated this time—the letters are not so neat, the drips of ink between the words almost as frequent as the words themselves. Where did John even sit to write this? He has no desk. Did he do it at the board pulled down between the cannons during dinner, with his messmates laughing and drinking around him?
John’s hands shift on his back then, his head tilting upward slightly so that his mouth almost brushes Sherlock’s ear.
John waits. Even his patience is more than Sherlock can take—it just makes the ache of longing in his chest all the worse. How—how will he ever possibly convey to John how much he means to Sherlock? He can’t, he can’t, but John’s hand is warm on Sherlock’s knee and he wants to say something that will make John inch it further up his leg, instead of keeping it still and frozen like it is now.
“Need me to what?” John asked, grinning devilishly up at Sherlock before dropping his mouth to Sherlock’s other thigh, this time letting his tongue come out, dragging it hot and wet against the sensitive skin.
He is certain he will die of joy.
Aidan plays the melody twice through. It’s a simple tune and Sherlock is about to lift his instrument back beneath his chin to start playing when John steps forward beside him.
, Sherlock—
“Woohoo!” Billy’s excitement at this revelation makes him leap—just once, into the air with delight—like a young billy goat, Sherlock thinks, and then is immediately horrified by the thought. The boy has made him absolutely sentimental.
The affection with which they greet him is heartening for Sherlock. It isn’t just that they’re grateful that he has relieved them of Anderson’s tyranny, which as far as Sherlock is concerned would be victory enough, but it’s clear—it’s been clear for a while now—that they genuinely like him.
“Good. That’s very good. I was wondering if…” Sherlock can almost hear the groan of the rusty cogs turning as he struggles to remember the proper way to phrase such a request. “That is, I’d like to ask if I might have the pleasure of your company later on this afternoon perhaps…” Sherlock’s eyes flick to the worn drawstring bag that is perpetually dangling off of Ms. Grimsby’s arm. “Over a game of whist?”
Sherlock turned in the direction of the door they had come through.
But now that Sherlock tries to remember a time when John said as much, he finds he can’t.
“We’ll meet you there. Yes, yes, I’ll wait until you get there with the warrant.” He heard Sherlock’s impatient footsteps as he paced the landing. “Come on, John!”
John’s lips against his are thin and chapped, but oh, how sweet they are to Sherlock when they part against his! When the warm pressure of John’s tongue pushes at the seam of his lips, and then his mouth is full of John, his fingers curling in Sherlock’s hair, the taste of the sea there in the reaches of his kiss, and Sherlock can feel his smile as it lifts his cheeks.
need to do,” and here, Sherlock gasps again as John readjusts his fingers around Sherlock’s, “Is help me open up, a little bit at a time. Do you think you can do that?”
Sherlock thought it wasn’t possible for him to feel any happier in this moment; he was wrong. He can feel the glow of his pleasure at John’s words lighting him up from within.
Billy readjusts the buckets in his hands. “Well, don’t thank me just yet, Mr. Holmes. Wait until I’ve brought you what you asked for, at least!”
He quickened the pace of his strokes, listened to the sound of Sherlock’s breathing speeding up, magnified in the intimate space between them.
, you did.”
“And what did you say?”
“I’ll sit, thank you.”
Next chapter coming very soon! As always, comments are very much appreciated. :)
“You did well today.” His voice is full of quiet approval. “You’ll need to keep practicing, and more than anything else, you should work on strength training.”
“N-no, sir.”
John drops his hands and steps away and Sherlock instantly regrets his words.
Next he heads up on deck, but here, too, he is disappointed.
Sherlock takes it, eyes still searching the crowd for John. He places his violin case at his feet, so he can hold his drink with both hands, and then settles himself against the sun-warmed railing to watch the madness unfold.
There are certainly tangles in Sherlock’s hair—the salt and the sea air have done their part to ensure that—but John is so careful that the teeth of the comb against Sherlock’s scalp are as gentle as his fingers and feel almost as good.
When he finally pulls back for air, his heart is pounding hard against John’s side.
that he allows himself a little moan of pleasure at the fact that he is allowed to do this, with
Sherlock remembers now with sudden, stinging clarity how John begged him to be quiet, how he failed to do so. A slow trickle of horror creeps cold through the pit of Sherlock’s stomach at the realization of just how loud he really was.
“Do you know why I’ve smoked so many cigarettes this week?”
Sherlock looks again at Stevens who’s clearly not someone who can take a joke. He’s glaring openly at his crewmates, his expression darkening with fury.
Of course, Sherlock has never had a sweetheart. Girls are no different than other people—worse even. He finds them difficult to understand, impossible to communicate with. They are like a different species altogether, utterly removed from him, too talkative, too changeable; too full of lightness and levity.
He watches John’s eyes move over the contours of his face, tracing every curve, every line. There is something infinitely tender in the way he seems to be studying Sherlock now, but Sherlock can still see traces of that deep sorrow in his gaze.
there.
He lets it fall down over his fingers, unspooling in a soft, slow tumble of silk, and he finds his breath leaving him in a long sigh at the feel of it, at everything it represents to him.
“Come on.” He eases an arm under John’s shoulders; helps pull him to his feet. John leans into him heavily—gives him all his weight—
“I said I love you.”
“You there! You dropped something!”
To John’s quiet delight, Sherlock also filled his plate and began to eat with steady vigor.
Something in John’s voice softens. “You can’t actually believe that?”
He doesn’t know what to make of the fact that this stranger just went out of his way to protect him.
“I heard your cry for help on Friday afternoon. I was working at the pumps.”
“You two clearly care about each other a great deal. What should it matter that you’re both…” Molly’s cheeks flush dark again. “Both gents. I can’t see why that should make any difference.”
“I was thinking how someday, I’d like to take you there, show you every flower, and then lay you down under those scented boughs.”
There was an unopened bottle of wine beside the two place settings, and looking at it, John realized he recognized the label. It was from the same vineyard as the wine Sherlock had served them the night he had come back from New Zealand. The grateful wine merchant must have given Sherlock several bottles.
He can still feel the ghosts of Anderson’s fingers around his throat. Sherlock takes another deep breath to dispel the image of Anderson’s contorted face from his mind.
“Are you quite sure?”
John’s flesh is hard and hot under Sherlock’s hand, but also, soft, so soft, like living silk. Sherlock can feel John’s pulse along the length of him, can feel every vein, every ridge of flesh, and he is breathing hard now, so hard he almost cannot catch his breath.
The metal was almost too hot to touch; he felt it burning the flesh on his palms but John’s hands closed gratefully around the first rung and started to climb.
But of course there isn’t—violins are not easy to come by, especially not here, in this portside tavern at the edge of the world.
John says nothing but the look in his eyes is enough to melt the stanchions on the side of the ship.
“Are you headed to the forecastle?” Sherlock asks, knowing full well that’s where Billy is headed if he is to take his supper.
“What is it, lad?”
“Oh, this was only the first of many… I have a whole afternoon of surprises lined up… just you wait. This one I think you’re really going to like…”
John felt Sherlock shift against him, curling closer. John felt the heat of his breath when he spoke, his voice low, full of intent. “What I said earlier, I meant it.”
There was murder in John’s eyes plain as day, and killing a fellow sailor isn’t a crime Sherlock imagines John would be able to easily escape from, no matter how charming and well loved he may be.
Sherlock whimpers into the kiss and feels John speeding up his strokes.
“But that was selfish of me. I care about you too much to treat you like that.”
“Lieutenant Lestrade has spoken with the captain and he has amended his earlier decision.”
John placed a hand on one of Sherlock’s thighs to keep him spread, his thumb stroking absently over the sensitive skin as he pushed his slicked finger in.
“I will, sir,” Billy says, somber as ever. “He…” Billy fidgets again, as though deciding whether or not to say what he clearly wants to. “He misses you too, sir. I think it’s making him a bit mad.”
However, another part of John was acutely aware of just how long it had been since either of them had eaten anything substantial, and the growling in his stomach was starting to become violent.
“Good afternoon, Madam,” he says, with the customary bow.
“Just one drink, Johnny. Come on, you’ve got hours left still.”
“…is that even if he
He looks down at John.
And then on Saturday evening, just when Sherlock’s patience is about to break (has it really only been two days since John came to see him? Not even two days?), he wakes from a fitful doze to the sound of a knock on his cabin door.
As John stares up at him in incredulous fury, he swears he can make out the wince of regret on Sherlock’s face at his choice of words.
“So when you say you used to fantasize about me in the bath, does that mean…?” John let the question hang in the dripping air between them, unfinished.
“How did you—? I didn’t—I never—”
“Sherlock, I need my hand back.”
“Oh. Well.” His discomfort feels as though it’s strangling him. “It was nothing.”
John moves the cool cloth to Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock tilts his head back with gratitude, elongating his throat.
There was a faint crease between Sherlock’s eyebrows as he looked down at John. Sherlock settled his weight back on John’s thighs. “What’s the matter? Why are you—?”  As his hips met John’s, his mouth fell open in surprise. “Oh!”
Time lost all meaning. John did not know how long he shuddered in the circle of Sherlock’s arms, his immediate surroundings fading around him in the wake of the fireworks display going off in his own body.
John let out a moan.
“If there’s one talent I’ve learned doing this work it’s knowing precisely when a four hour shift is up. It’s in my body, you see. Every minute that passes, I feel it.” He taps his own chest, smiling wryly up at Sherlock. “If you opened me up, you’d likely find an hour glass full of sand in place of a heart.”
John trembling between Sherlock’s legs, his eyes squeezing shut, his body pushing up into Sherlock’s weight—it is beautiful like the stars are beautiful, like the first curl of frost on the window in winter, like the light of the sun on Sherlock’s cheeks. It is rare and so delicate, so brief, Sherlock wishes there was a way he could capture this moment and all its sensations and bottle it up somewhere, to ensure that he could have some part of it always within himself.
Sherlock leads Molly from the dining room.
Sherlock is so caught off-guard by this comment that he snorts into his drink.
She stands for a moment with her hands on her hips, looking him over, her eyes full of merriment.
“I was going to take the door off its hinges, but it would have taken too long. John, you don’t know—”
“I was…” Sherlock drops his head, embarrassed, even to tell Billy the cause of his reckless decision earlier. “I was coming to find you when I ran into Stevens. I wanted to give you my response so you didn’t have to come looking for me.”
“No?”
He was careful to keep several centimeters of space between them. Even so, his body seemed to bridge the gap between them. He could feel the heat from Sherlock’s torso all along his side where they almost touched.
“Well, for whatever reason he has it in for me. He—” Sherlock hesitates, still uncertain how much detail to disclose to Molly. Her being aware of his feelings for John is a far different matter from her being aware of what they do together in private.  “John and I were alone together last night. In my room.”
The next morning, as soon as he wakes, he swings his legs over the side of his bunk and pushes himself to standing.
John felt his rage leap back to life. The look in Donovan’s eyes made up his mind.
He looks up at John, his voice full of reverence—he needs John to
, and
As usual, Colonel Jackson is abreast of all the most recent news.
He lifted his eyes back to Sherlock’s.
—began to thrust.
“It’s something I’ve spent many a lonely hour imagining.”
He hurries to comply, and he finds that his third finger slides in just as easily as the second.
John ignored him and kept pacing. “It’s sick. It’s sick and I won’t—”
In the half-light from the illuminated city below, the angles and curves of Sherlock’s face were thrown into dramatic relief, accentuating the hollows of his cheeks, the dip above his upper lip, the groove at the base of his throat.
“You’re a liar. I know you took it.”
He’s close enough to the quarterdeck that he can hear the captain talking with Lieutenant Lestrade. Their discussion is of little interest to him, as it’s almost entirely comprised of technical nautical language he does not understand. He’s only half-listening when something in the captain’s tone signals a shift in the topic of conversation.
He tries—without success—to think cool, sobering thoughts, to drag himself back from the edge of his own fledgling arousal until John returns, but it’s a losing battle. The sponge feels too good against his skin, the fragrance of the soap working on his already hyper-attuned senses and opening them to every pleasurable sensation that this experience affords—the coolness of the water, the warmth of his own body under his hands, the bottom of the copper tub so hard against his knees.
Sherlock sat up and reached out for him, but John pushed him back against the pillows with a hand on his shoulder, careful to keep his distance.
A long arm threaded itself around his waist.
When he speaks, his voice is like sex itself.
He cannot really but if he keeps his eyes closed and concentrates very hard then he can relive every song he’s ever heard John Watson sing in his presence and that is almost good enough.
He wants to go slowly, wants to take John’s pleasure and spool it out long and easy like John does for him, like a strand of honey, shining and golden, as it falls from the spoon.
John wakes to darkness.
“We use a bucket of saltwater to get it clean and then a block of sandstone to do the scrubbing. It’s hard work, and tedious. It’s hell on your knees. Worst of all is when it’s cold out. You’ve got to be barefoot to do it. And it’s got to be done every day.”
Sherlock carried him up all seventeen steps, never pausing once to catch his breath.
And Sherlock knows, in this moment, that he is willing to sacrifice anything to keep this—he will do whatever it takes, no matter the cost.
“I was just… looking for someone, that’s all.”
He crosses the room to the door and goes through it without looking back.
“You beauty, you absolute impossible beauty…”
He reached down, closing his hands over Sherlock’s arms just above his narrow elbows and
“I know who stole the manifest from your cabin.”
Donovan’s face looked drawn, and her eyes when she looked at John were full of pity.
“Nice to have made your acquaintance.”
“What’s the matter? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“More, J-John. I need m-more.”
John’s hands are still in Sherlock’s hair, fingers threaded through his curls; Sherlock can feel them tense in response as his mouth drops to the skin beneath John’s ear. He lets his mouth linger there, kisses him more slowly, mouth opening and then exhaling so John can feel the warmth of his breath.
Sherlock cannot hear their conversation; he is too far down the deck.
“ANDERSON!”
Suggested cocktail accompaniment for this chapter: Sex on the Beach 😏
Still, the possibility made something in his chest ache.
“Here, here!”
Sherlock blocked his path, his voice dropping to a lower register as he switched languages abruptly, all good humor gone from his face. “
“But if I catch you anywhere near this part of the ship again, I swear to god, Sherlock Holmes, I will throw you in the brig myself.”
“That’s where I’ll finally take you the way that you want…”
But what’s most interesting to Sherlock is the fact that Knott seems to know more about the captain’s business than anyone else on the ship. Even though he has no proof that the conversation he just overheard has anything to do with the captain, Sherlock has a sneaking suspicion that that is precisely what the men were quarreling about.
The crash of the waves against the surf is louder now that they’re out on the beach facing the ocean. The sand is warm under Sherlock’s bare feet. He feels a jolt of excitement move through him in spite of himself. He hasn’t done anything this ridiculous since he was a boy.
to get to him. “How did you…?”
“You’re incredible.” Sherlock says, grasping for words. “That was… absolutely incredible.”
They carry their full buckets back through the trees to the hut, and then continue to make their way back to the stream until the copper tub is filled almost to the brim.
Sherlock wishes he could talk to him. Just walk across the deck and take John by the hand, pull him away from his work so they could go and speak together in the privacy of Sherlock’s cabin, so that they could mourn together the opportunity they have just lost.
Even with no knowledge of naval custom, Sherlock can tell from the expressions on everyone’s faces that what the captain has just done is a breach of etiquette.
Sherlock can feel his laughter bubbling up inside him again; he manages to quell it, but one corner of his mouth ticks up in a smile.
John pushed his hand up into Sherlock’s curls, and heard Sherlock gasp in appreciation.
“Indeed,” Sherlock says, unable to keep from staring at the vivid scar bisecting the man’s face.
John is still laughing as he moves to stand but before he can rise to his feet, a shadow falls over them both, blocking the light of the late afternoon sun.
“About last night.” She interrupts him, looking briefly startled by her own audacity. “I think…perhaps, it would be best if you went back to see your psychiatrist again. In fact, I took the liberty of scheduling an appointment for you this morning.”
“Well, that’s me. Got to get back.”
Sherlock nods, distracted, breathing hard against John’s fingers, not bothering to close his mouth.
Sherlock drops to his knees in front of her, the speed of his movement alarming. He takes her hands in his.
Sherlock leaned in, his other hand warm against John’s knee. He tipped his head up, gazing at John through lashes that were low and heavy over his eyes. He blinked slowly and even the action of him shutting and opening his eyes again was somehow sultry, laden with the implications of sex.
is the one who should probably be apologizing.
Sherlock has never seen the pumps in action, but he has seen the handles for the contraption, located just aft of the main hatchway on the lower gun deck—and he can imagine now the team of men, their bodies straining as they push and lift—push and lift again—to drive the excess water from the ship’s hold.
“You’re an arrogant prat, you know that?”
“Champagne, sir?”
John felt Sherlock’s hands clench compulsively in the material of his jumper. His eyes were haunted, once again fixed on some distant place over John’s shoulder.
John opened his mouth to protest, but then shut it and took a step back. He nodded. “Right.”
There on his outstretched palms is a shining white cake of new soap. And not just any soap—it’s the kind of fine, hard soap that is shaped into neat squares and sold wrapped in silk paper—the kind of soap preferred by members of the nobility and gentry. He hasn’t seen soap of this quality since before he left England.
“He hurt you, didn’t he?”
He is standing now, and before Billy can walk away, Sherlock regains enough of his wits to ask him, “When can I find you? To give you my response? In an hour, where will you be?”
“Good, that’s good. Now shall I show you how to block?”
“I know you wouldn’t. Not on purpose. But it’ll go smoother for everyone if you let him alone for now.”
Distantly, he can hear the chaos of the celebrations above—the sounds of drunken laughter, the pounding of footsteps, the slightly off kilter music of Old Leroy’s mouth organ.
“I can feel the life energy leaking out of me as my brain atrophies. Soon I won’t be able to move at all.”
“What have we here? Someone is eager to get me undressed I see.”
“Good.” Knott studies him a moment longer, his expression intent. “I’m not going to ask you why you took that paper, or why you gave it back, but I want you to know that I don’t condone stealing, and if you have any sense at all, you will keep your distance from George Ferguson. He’s a greedy, reckless man, and at the rate he’s going, I will be very surprised if he makes it through this voyage alive.”
, whose aversion to other human beings was deep and unmovable. Apparently John was the exception.
, yes… look at you, you beauty… you’re so beautiful like this, so beautiful...”
This piece of information, above all else, is what makes the fear stick to the insides of Sherlock’s ribs, making him feel vaguely sick.
Unbidden, into his mind, streams the memory of years of insults from other children, from his hated cousins who would tease him, with Mycroft acting as their ring-leader until Sherlock ran, crying and red-faced to tell the Nurse.
As far as John was concerned, it was something ugly and potentially disastrous, now barring their way forward, and it was going to take some very delicate handling on his part to make sure the obstacle was removed without damaging either of them, or their relationship. He had absolutely no idea how Sherlock would react if he brought it up but he couldn’t face the prospect of not saying anything because he was too afraid that Sherlock himself would never acknowledge it, and the possibility that Sherlock might pretend it never happened would surely drive him mad.
“Good evening,” Sherlock whispers.
Sighing in exasperation Sherlock leans in again, his voice deliberately low.
The delighted expression on John’s face is enough to make Sherlock weak with gratitude. The thought of washing himself with hot water—of being able to get
He digs his knuckles into his eyes as if in doing so he can chase away the image of the look of disappointment on Burns’ face.
He really believed, after Anderson had taken control of John’s mess, that that was the end of it—that the night of the party had been his one and only opportunity to take part in something like that.
“Listen, Billy,” Sherlock turns suddenly, and puts a hand on Billy’s shoulder. “I want to ask you something.”
“Luckily you don’t weigh much.” He was halfway to the mouth of the alley when he heard sirens in the distance. “Thank God,” he muttered.
“Far as I know, they never found anything.”
He is trembling from head to foot, shaking with the force of his anger—he wants to strike out at Sherlock, to hurt him for what he’s done. Sherlock seems to sense this; that the power of his rage is equal to that of a caged animal, starved and wounded. He lays his body over John’s, half in and out of the water, and lowers his mouth to John’s ear.
Sherlock’s head flies up with interest.
John tipped his chin up, licking his lips. “Please,” he said, looking up at Sherlock through damp lashes, his voice a needy whisper. “Don’t stop.”
Clearly audible through the floorboards are the raucous sounds of the men above them, the light filtering down through the cracks blinking in and out as they move about overhead.
He was halfway up the fence when John got to the bottom.
After all the built-up sexual tension of the last week, he was slightly worried about how long he was going to last.
John had never seen Sherlock weep.
The young man to Sherlock’s left speaks up again. Sherlock can tell by the lurch in his voice that he’s had more wine than he can stomach. “But seriously? Captain Thunderbrows wanting to throw a party? Can you imagine—
“The sailor, Mr. Holmes, whose well-being you’re so concerned with—I’d like to know his name.”
John presses a kiss to his ribs, as if he can’t help himself. “Yes?”
He froze under Sherlock’s mouth, unable to believe what was happening, his body stiff as a poker. Then he felt Sherlock’s hand reach out to take his coiled fist, tangling their fingers together, and the shock of Sherlock’s warm palm against his own made him gasp in surprise.
The water is pleasantly cool—but not cold—and it feels utterly exquisite in contrast with the warm air, made all the warmer by the blaze of sunlight beating down on the beach.
They spent the rest of the morning ignoring one another, or at least, John had the impression Sherlock was ignoring him. John tried to take advantage of the relative peace and quiet to update his blog, but Sherlock’s moody silences were somehow almost as loud as his tantrums and he found he couldn’t concentrate.
“It’s only going to make you hotter,” John said, his lips sticking against Sherlock’s neck. “You’re going to be dripping with sweat by the time I’m finished with you. Dripping with sweat and your own come.”
“Good.” John sits back on his heels. “Well, I should go finish building the fire for later…”
Sherlock nods, his curls brushing John’s cheek as he leans in. He can’t speak—he’s too overcome by the intimacy of this moment, at the feeling of his slick finger poised against this place on John’s body. Even though he’s done this before, something about this time feels different, more charged, perhaps because of what it’s leading up to.
“I heard you…” Sherlock looks down at his hands. He’s too embarrassed to look John in the eye while he says it. “Singing up on deck. And I was worried…” Sherlock’s throat threatens to seize up but he forces himself to continue. “I was worried you didn’t want me anymore—” Sherlock feels John shift against him in protest, but he rushes on to finish before John can start speaking. “That you’d realized I wasn’t worth the risk. I thought that the song was a message for me.”
This explanation seems to satisfy the assembled company, except for Ironsides who is apparently still mourning Molly’s absence. It’s common knowledge that Ironsides always grows a bit maudlin around his third pint, so everyone ignores it.
Moriarty slipped nimbly from the table and landed on his feet with a squelching sound.
“I’m sorry, I’m going to have to hear you say it. Let’s try again. Is Sherlock Holmes still alive?”
They were on their way home from an especially draining and exhausting ordeal, from which they had emerged victorious, technically speaking, in that they had successfully taken into custody the criminal they had been seeking to apprehend.
The other sailors laugh good-naturedly, except Burns who’s gone back to his sewing, and John, who Sherlock notices has gone very still beside him.
“Why didn’t he come tell us himself?”
But god, that doesn’t stop him from
” He glanced up to see Sherlock’s head tipped back, the muscles in his neck tensed and straining. John lowered his mouth again to encompass the whole of Sherlock’s cock and felt Sherlock’s hips rise to meet his mouth. His left hand was tracing light patterns into the skin of Sherlock’s inner thigh, and he pressed down when he felt Sherlock’s hips thrust forward, increasing the suction from his mouth while holding him in place. “John!” Suddenly there was a hand in his hair, gently pulling him back. “Stop.”
“Don’t try and change the subject,” Sherlock snapped. “Something’s wrong. I can tell. What is it?”
How can touching John here affect him so much? When he hasn’t even touched himself?
“Let me.” In two long strides, Sherlock had closed the distance between them and his agile fingers were at John’s throat, pulling apart the silk.
Sherlock needs to think; there has to be a way out of this—it can’t end like this—not now. But the fear is blotting out his ability to think, like spilled ink covering a page; he can’t get his mind to cooperate, to focus.
The implication that he would do something foolish enough to put John’s life at risk makes his insides curl up with horror.
His world has narrowed to the space of John’s heart and his only concern is to ensure that it is beating. Nothing can stop him in the state he is in—the difficulties, the obstacles in his path—everything else falls away.
Sherlock can see him gesturing with distaste at the mess around him.
Thankfully, the relationship hadn’t progressed far enough to warrant any screaming rows. There were just several frustrated conversations and a lot of uncomfortable silences. It was perhaps fortunate that most of these conversations took place within the first few days of the trip, so by the second week they were able to go on some sight seeing ventures together. The situation was made all the more awkward by the fact that Sarah was paying for the entire trip.
The hand that was covering his mouth slips around to hold him between his shoulder blades, John’s voice still warm against his ear, murmuring encouragements.
“What?”
Sherlock is embarrassed to find his own throat growing tight with emotion as he thinks back over all the awful things people have said to him over the years, all of the terrible names he’s been called. They hurt, every one, no matter how hard he pretended he didn’t care, no matter how hard he tried to convince himself that it didn’t affect him. He can still hear his cousins’ mocking voices in his ears as clearly if they were standing before him.
The men seem to know Lestrade will be making an announcement soon; a small group of them have gathered in the ship’s waist, standing a respectable distance back from the lieutenants but waiting somewhat impatiently for the men to finish their conversation. The men in the sails seem to be waiting too. Sherlock expects they are all eager to hear the final pronouncement about how their time will be spent while in port.
Sherlock kept his head bowed, raised the glass to his lips and took a long drink.
“J-John…”
Stamford says nothing in response to his, but he winks at Sherlock when he hands over the mug, and unwilling to disappoint the sea of expectant faces circling him, Sherlock takes the mug, raises it to his lips and does his best to swallow as much of it as he can in one go.
It was pathetic. John should be able to unseat Sherlock easily—Sherlock was nothing but skin and bones. He was much stronger than the slender detective but exhaustion had made him weak.
“Can you believe them? Can you believe the nerve?”
John licked at his parched lips. He couldn’t think.
“You do seem… preoccupied of late. Is there… is there something in particular that’s troubling you?”
Sherlock manages to catch them before they leave, suffering through several minutes of Ms. Grimsby’s indictment against the new ladies’ fashion (“These muslin dresses are far too thin. Half the women on this ship may as well be walking around nude as far as I can tell!”), in order to improve his chances of speaking with Miss Hooper in private again tomorrow. It is his only success of the evening, if it even may be counted as such.
Sherlock opens his eyes to do as John asks, raising himself off the pillows to give John the room he needs to free him from the garment.
And then John’s fingers are snaking in against the delicate skin of Sherlock’s throat, moving so gently down the sides of his neck and into the dip between his collarbones.
Just one more minute, though, of this bliss, this loveliness, the pounding of John’s heartbeat so strong against his own.
Sherlock lets out a long breath in an effort to calm his still raging heart.
He reaches down to push Sherlock’s curls out of his eyes, peering down to find his face. “How are you, my love?”
He looks at John with dismay. “I can’t go lie down! We only have so many hours left, John! I can’t afford to waste any of them
*blows small official horn*
“I don’t know,” he said at last, softly. He looked up at John, and John saw his expression was full of conflicted remorse. “I hadn’t planned on it. The point was to ascertain how you really felt, to confirm that you were indeed… physically attracted to me, but I’m afraid…” Sherlock dropped his eyes to his lap. “I might have done. If Lestrade hadn’t phoned.” Sherlock’s eyes flickered upward once again and John saw this time that they were dark with longing. “I wanted to.”
He kisses the line of John’s bared throat, tasting sorrow and sweat, the acrid taste of overwork, of suffering—hoping that the gliding touch of his mouth will temper the bitterness slightly, will help John to forget.
The hollowness inside of Sherlock, impossibly, seems to expand.
John attempted a laugh, but it came out all wrong. God, what was the matter with him? He couldn’t seem to sustain one emotion for more than fifteen seconds. He was a complete mess.
This last month has been a particularly difficult one for me- then things got better and then I was traveling (still am) and my computer's falling apart soooo for a number of reasons I have had very little time/ability to write. This chapter was going to be much longer but I figured... eh, why not just post what I have so far? I figured you would all appreciate having something to read in the interim while I try and whip the rest of this chapter into shape. Also, it's Christmas! So think of it as my little holiday gift to you, whether you celebrate Christmas or not. I hope you enjoy it!
“Your hair.”
He looks up at the other man, a poisonous retort already forming on his lips, when he’s stopped short from answering by the look on Deverall’s face.
And now, even in John’s absence, the feeling remains. His skin feels thin—translucent even, humming with the memory of John’s touch. His body feels so new to him, feels different, full of possibility. He never knew he was capable of so much feeling.
“I never was…” John manages, his voice breathless, but somehow also slow and heavy, the sound of it like honey pouring off a spoon, shot through with sunlight. “Not until I met you… you and your impossible hands...”
“Here, here.” Several other voices echo Burns.
John’s other hand is still clenched sticky and hot against Sherlock’s hip, trapped between both their bodies. Sherlock’s waistcoat and the linen shirt he wears underneath are bunched up, twisted from his desperate thrusting into John to bare a strip of pale skin. He can feel the softness of John’s blue shirt where it’s pressing into his naked stomach.
He wants to go on kissing John all night long, exploring John’s body with his mouth—there is so much of him to taste, to touch—but the candle on Sherlock’s desk is guttering in its pool of wax, and fatigue is crowding in to slow his thoughts.
He tilted his head to the side as Sherlock’s mouth worked its way down his neck, sucking and biting softly. John made a helpless sound that he would have been embarrassed about had he been in his right mind. Instead, John made the sound again. He could have sworn he felt Sherlock grin against him.
“Exactly the question you should be asking, Doctor.” Donovan shoved him suddenly, hard.
Billy nods to him with a determined look on his face before turning and making off down the corridor.
Sherlock was so close, John could feel the heat coming off his body. He felt himself leaning into it instinctively, like a plant tilting toward the sun, and realized that his towel was slipping. He reached down to keep it from sliding further down his hips and saw Sherlock’s eyes follow the movement.
John turns back to Sherlock suddenly and then it’s hard to remember to be jealous because John is tucking his hand in under Sherlock’s bicep to pull him closer, his voice shining bright with eagerness.
John nods and steps aside.
“I’m sorry, sir. No passengers.”
Unable to help himself, Sherlock adds, “But to be perfectly honest, just looking at the shape of the box, any idiot would be able to tell there are sword blades in there.”
John enjoyed the ensuing several minutes of silence before Sherlock’s voice rose up from the sofa in an incantatory wail.
“Go around… assessing people’s desires and then just taking what you want!”
There’s a sniffling sound and Sherlock hears only a mumbled reply.
After all this anticipation, after getting his hopes up only to have them smashed once again—it’s almost more than he can bear.
This is how it should always be between them, John’s beautiful golden body arching in the sand, Sherlock lying naked and worshipful between his legs as the waves rise around them.
“You—? Never mind. I don’t want to know.”
Sherlock held his gaze. “Only if there’s jam for the toast.”
Matthews nods. “It used to happen more in the early days. Things have been better in the last few years. But this is worse than we’ve seen in a long time.”
Special thanks go out this chapter (but also in general!) to
Sherlock almost drops his paintbrush.
asks a voice in Sherlock’s head, a voice he’s never heard before—a gentler voice, so unlike most of the voices that speak to Sherlock.
that the fresh and painful-looking bruise on the glowering man’s face is the result of John Watson’s fist.
“John?”
Not releasing his hold on John’s wrists, Sherlock leaned down, and licked the length of John’s throat.
“Of course, sir.”
Billy nods, face illuminated by a sudden grin.
John pulled his fingers out and snapped the bottle open, slicking the length of his erection with the cool liquid. He almost groaned as his fingers made contact with his heated flesh—he was already so far gone it was going to be a miracle if he lasted more than one stroke. Just the sight of Sherlock stretched over the coffee table with his thighs spread was too much.
Sherlock does not need to be told twice.
I hemmed and hawed a bit about whether or not to post a link to this yet, as this song is going to return in future chapters with more explanation, but I figured why the hell not? Those of you who'd like to know what it is now are free to listen, and others who want to imagine something else entirely until it comes up again in the fic are free to do so!
He feels John’s fingers on his temples, tilting his head up a fraction of an inch more, and the warmth in Sherlock’s belly grows at the feeling of John manipulating his body, however minutely, and through the warm haze of his contentment he finds himself thinking,
It would be one thing for him to treat the man coldly or rudely, but his total lack of interest in everything the man represents makes it clear that he has no interest in the ship’s cargo.
John’s smile lifts at one corner in amusement. “May I come in?”
, when he’s the one who so desperately needs comfort.
“Everything’s all right now.”
“Just what are you suggesting, Mr. Holmes?”
That was two boats down but there was still one more on deck, only half full. At the sight of the flames, the panicked guests swarmed the armed guard controlling the flow of traffic, fighting to get by.
But he does not know how to explain that without making John more upset.
“NO!”
John lets himself be pulled, his clothed body covering the length of Sherlock’s, making Sherlock gasp at the rough feel of John’s trouser-covered thighs pressing in against his own, the heavy weight of John against his aching erection almost more than he can take.
John was in a warm little world of Sherlock’s chest against his own, Sherlock’s hands on his shoulder blades, his leg tangling with Sherlock’s, and Sherlock’s mouth on his—warm and wet and open.
“I see.”
It’s always slightly surprising to see John beside other men because in truth, he’s quite short. Somehow it’s very easy to forget, even if standing beside him, John is half a head shorter than Sherlock.
John is wearing his jacket but has no shirt on underneath, and Sherlock cannot resist sliding his hands up the hard planes of John’s abdomen to find his nipples, already erect, and brush over them with his thumbs.
Sherlock finds he has no idea what John is about to say. This is another thing Sherlock likes about John—the fact that Sherlock cannot anticipate how he will act, what he will say, like he can with so many people. This is one of the primary reasons why Sherlock finds so much of the world dull and unworthy of his attention, because people are so easy to read, so predictable. They all seem to share the same petty interests and ambitions, but not John Watson. He is something else entirely.
John blew out a quiet breath.
“Oh god. I did, didn’t I? I kissed you when I was out of my mind.”
sun. Oh god.
It wasn’t a question. John knew he was right. “You were testing me to see how I would respond to you.”
“I should—I should probably warn you,” Sherlock gasped as John’s mouth concentrated on the opposite nipple. “I could come from this… which would be,
Sherlock cries out as John’s mouth sucks a kiss into the side of his throat.
There’s a collective chorus of disapproval at this announcement.
He could feel Sherlock’s hand trembling against his hip. “How does that feel?” His voice was thick.
“He told me what happened to his fiancée, how he learned of her death in the first few days of his recovery and how much the news had affected him. I almost couldn’t believe it myself when I heard.”
John put his face in his hands. What was happening to the world? Sherlock offering to sleep beside him to keep his sleep free from nightmares? Maybe he was experiencing some rare brand of guilt over the fact that technically it was his fault that John had been nearly blown up by Moriarty. Or maybe in the world of Sherlock’s brain it was a perfectly normal thing to offer to do. John couldn’t figure it out.
“I know, I know,” John breathes, voice low and soothing, mouth moving now to place a kiss on the bone of Sherlock’s hip.
I cannot thank all of you enough for reading this story, and staying with it all the way through to the end. Your support and insights and encouragement have meant the world to me. I have never finished a story this long, so finishing this is kind of a big deal. Knowing all of you were out there eagerly waiting for new chapters definitely helped keep me writing through some very busy times when I otherwise might not have found the energy to focus on this story.
“You’re everything,” Sherlock repeats, tipping his mouth forward into John’s to find the pale pink heat of John’s tongue behind his teeth. Sherlock licks at it, delighted by the spark of feeling when he finds it and it pushes back against him.
Sherlock freezes, momentarily chastened, but he can see the humor in John’s eyes and the shame that threatened briefly to engulf him evaporates in an instant. He is about to open his mouth to ask John what it is when John sits back.
“Leave me alone, Mycroft,” he says through gritted teeth.
The warm heat of Sherlock’s mouth slid up his thigh, drifting close to the base of his cock but not touching, moving up to graze the crease of his pelvis, alternating the press of his tongue with the pull of his teeth. The way Sherlock’s mouth was moving against him made it clear that he was
He drops beneath the surface of the water to cool his burning cheeks and when he resurfaces, John is upon him, breathing hard, his blue eyes glittering like sapphires.
Sherlock made a sound of protest and reached down with his other hand, but the drugs had made him weak, and John grabbed hold of that one too and easily pushed both of Sherlock’s wrists up above his head.
The same man called out, but now his voice was wavering with panic. “It’ll take ages for all of us to give you our things before we fit through the door! The fire’s moving too quickly.”
“Well,” John says, his expression sobering as he takes one of Sherlock’s hands in his to guide it down between their bodies.
Flattening his tongue against the underside of Sherlock’s cock he wrapped his mouth around the head and swallowed the first few inches. He heard Sherlock suck in a sharp breath, and lowered his mouth several more inches, hollowing his cheeks to create suction.
John is watching him with a rapt expression on his face.
Miss Hooper’s eyes flicker back towards him, the nervous smile returning to her lips. “I think perhaps it might be the same for you.”
Panic floods him.
John had never felt angry about Sherlock’s ability to read him before—it was always astounding to him, dazzling, something to be praised. In fact, he found it almost comforting, the idea that Sherlock knew him better than anyone, sometimes better than he knew himself. But for the first time, he felt too vulnerable, overly exposed as if he had been stripped of his skin, and Sherlock was standing before him, fully clothed, gazing with a clinical eye at all the messy inner-workings of his heart and blood and organs.
“How did I get so lucky?”
Mr. Knott is present, but he is quieter than ever; he speaks with no one, working through his soup and plate of boiled meat with steady industry before pushing back his chair and excusing himself from the meal before the plates have even been cleared away.
“Right.” Taking hold of John’s arms, Sherlock flipped him around and walked him backwards across the room to the couch. His eyes never left John’s; something in that look—like Sherlock wanted to devour him whole and then lick the bones clean—made John’s erection throb against his leg.
The urgency in Sherlock’s voice is drowned out by the hubbub of the sailors changing shifts, as those who were working down below begin to emerge on deck and John’s half of the crew moves to take their positions again. The sudden influx of people means there is twice the amount of noise.
Not for the first time today Sherlock finds himself wishing he could stop time, freeze it so that he could exist forever in this moment.
John goes on holding Sherlock’s gaze, his irises the color of a storm at sea.
Gingerly, Sherlock reaches out and pulls another cobweb from John’s hair.
Dropping to his knees, Anderson looks underneath the bed. He flings the pile of discarded clothing aside as if it might be shielding something from view.
The guest was right. The flames had now engulfed the entire far wall and were licking merrily along the expensive carpet. John was halfway to the door and he could feel the heat on his back. A woman beside him was sobbing as she pulled off her earrings.
John holds it out to Sherlock when he’s finished peeling it.
“Do those every morning, or as often as you can. It’ll give you something to help pass the time as well.” John grins at Sherlock, and then stoops to pick up his jacket. “Well, I’m off for the next watch.”
Sherlock cries out, bucking upward with his hips and John’s fingers fly immediately to Sherlock’s mouth to silence him.
He watches the man take a moment to gather himself so that he can speak calmly.
For a moment, John didn’t understand the invitation. Sherlock knew he didn’t smoke. But then he saw Sherlock’s hand on the door out to the balcony and realized Sherlock was inviting John out with him into the cold.
“Anyone with a pair of eyes would be aware of it. Haven’t you seen the activity on deck? The captain’s been working the men to the bone to try and get maximum speed. Surely you’ve heard the noise from the pumps?”
Nothing except the only thing on earth that could stay Sherlock’s hand, which is the promise of John Watson’s suffering if he were to do so.
Sherlock huffs his displeasure but then John leans in and kisses him softly, and Sherlock melts.
He hauls himself away from the longboat at his back, and makes his way as quietly and as quickly as he can back toward the stairs leading below deck.
He opens his mouth against John’s, licks the lovely soft expanse of John’s pink bottom lip.
John is not looking in Sherlock’s eyes.
Billy lowers his bucket and turns to give Sherlock the full report. “Colonel Jackson arm-wrestled half the crew. Mr. Summersby got so drunk he took all his clothes off and tried to climb the aft-mast—Mr. Burns had to go up and get him down. And two of the midshipmen—Cunningham and Cherry got into a fist fight and Peter Cherry broke Cunningham’s nose.”
Without a second thought, Sherlock seizes the brush.
“…Fifteen the first time I kissed a lad. I was drunk as Judas, but my god, I never knew kissing could be like that.”
“Well, I won’t keep you from your game,” John says. His tone is carefully light and pleasant, but Sherlock can feel the tension still coming off him in waves.
“OI! What’d you think you’re doing stopping in the middle of the room like that? Watch where you’re going!”
song.”
,” John’s cock surges against his belly as Sherlock’s searching fingers rub against the spot. “I don’t know exactly but it’s—” John makes a stifled sound, tipping his head back. When he finally lifts his head to finish speaking, his voice is rough. “It feels incredibly good, I can tell you that much. Oh my god, Sherlock,
“Perfect,” he breathed, tugging gently on Sherlock’s buttocks to expose the tender flesh beneath his balls, leaning in before Sherlock had a chance to realize his intentions and licking the line between his arse cheeks.
He isn’t sure what he’ll see when he looks down, and somewhat to Sherlock’s relief, at first he can’t see much.
Sherlock’s laughter is infectious. Molly is laughing now too, her parasol shaking with the movement.
He guided him as gently as possible from the cab, and over the threshold of the front door. The stairs were a challenge. Sherlock was groggier than before and he seemed unable to do much more than lean heavily against John’s side as John struggled to get each of his long legs up and over the individual steps.
John’s fingers are still on Sherlock’s chin and it feels right—it feels better—to have this contact with John, to experience the slight increase in pressure in his grip as Sherlock’s mouth stretches around him.
The men stare at him for several heartbeats, apparently uncertain as to what to make of this speech.
“John,” he pleads, when John lifts up a bit, not sure what he is asking for, but very aware that the hot aching length of his cock needs some more pointed stimulation, needs more friction, more pressure, more
“Ah, well. Another time then.” Sherlock bows again. “Good day to you ladies.”
anticipate John wanting to spend part of the time without him.
“You think he really
He feels, rather than hears, John’s groan against him; and then he feels John lifting his mouth away and a throb of resentment moves through him.
It feels so good but it’s not quite enough. Sherlock wants more pressure, more of John against him.
“Very good, John,” he said, and this time, John got what he wanted, as Sherlock bent forward and licked the length of his crack. “Very, very good.”
. Why do we have to do it like this? In subway cars rigged with bombs, on the tops of buildings, by your
The brief shimmer of excitement he felt as he was getting dressed is rapidly diminishing in the presence of the well-dressed, chattering crowd. There is absolutely nobody in this room that Sherlock has any desire to talk to, and there is nothing to take his mind off the dragging minutes as he waits for the sun to sink below the horizon beyond the windows.
The crowd falls silent and it occurs to Sherlock that this is the quietest he has heard them all evening. All eyes in the room are on John. The musicians have set down their instruments, and even the men playing cards have turned from their game to watch.
But now, they’d finally,
He grinds his fists into his temples.
“How now my bathing beauty?”
He does not dare look over at John.
John pushes his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “No, love. It really happened. I’m really here.” His fingers card through Sherlock’s hair, and then gently he guides Sherlock’s face until he can see him. His voice is filled with tenderness. “And I really love you.”
Sherlock is floating somewhere above his bed—his body has ceased to contain him.
Sherlock kissed him again, pushed another finger in, and John gave a low cry at the sensation, lifting his hips. The burn was worse now but the slight pain only served to heighten his arousal.
That night John dreams of smoke.
But John’s words, although Sherlock knows they are meant to reassure him, have the opposite effect. With a jolt, Sherlock remembers the limited nature of their time together. He wonders, with a feeling close to panic, how much time has already elapsed? Half-an hour? Three quarters? More?
Sherlock doesn’t have the breath to respond, he nods at Deverall before he disappears through the open door.
“I’m starving. Curry?”
He doesn’t care what Amesbury thinks of him—the man is petty, dull, and utterly without merit in any way—but still, Sherlock cannot stop the shame that heats his cheeks as he descends again below decks.
Sherlock leaves the breakfast table irritated by the reappearance of Miss Hooper’s melancholy smile, furious with himself that he did not take greater advantage of the time he had with her yesterday. He should have stopped to consider the fact that an opportunity such as it was would not arise often. And now the poor girl is trapped in her aunt’s dull company again.
it’s not enough.
Just the sight of Sherlock, kneeling in front of him in his three-piece suit, his silk bowtie still hanging around his neck, the dark waves of his smoothed back hair catching the light from the window—it was almost too much for John.
“Actually, um.” Sherlock stares hard at her left elbow. “We could um… that is… would you care to dance?”
“Nod if you can hear me.”
. Either that, or Sherlock will travel back to England with John. He’ll simply tell the men working in the Bombay office that Sherlock Holmes was lost at sea. They can send word back to his family. “Drowned,” he’ll tell them. “In a storm. He was thrown overboard.”
“Why not?”
Over Moriarty’s shoulder, John could see that the door was still wide open. He stared at it, hopelessly, out of his good eye.
“You are lucky, sir,” the man tells him in thickly accented English. “I am just about to leave. Only waiting for—”
Sherlock shakes his head again, full of wonder.
Sherlock tries to refuse but she presses it into his hands. “I insist. My uncle gave it to me when we left Portsmouth. He was so afraid of the tropical sun he gave it to me even when I reminded him it was a man’s hat. He’s a bit of an eccentric fellow.” Miss Hooper’s mouth softens at some memory, before she looks up again at Sherlock. “Please. You will be doing me a service if you take it. I assure you, I have no need of it.”
Sherlock thinks back to the night of the party, wishing now that he’d had more presence of mind that evening to be alert for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. He had been so bored and impatient waiting for John that he hadn’t given a second thought to any strange goings on.
John abruptly lost the thread of what he was saying as Sherlock’s mouth did something unbelievable and exquisite to the side of his neck.
John thrashed, wild, desperate, a guttural moan pulled from his throat. The abrupt movement caused the edge of the blade to sink in.
“It’s good for yeh! Scrap of a thing like yourself, you look like you could do with some eating up!”
Sherlock did. John let out a strangled shout, his fingers slipping off Sherlock’s neck as his head fell back, heels digging into Sherlock’s back.
The energy between them that was there up on deck is between them still, shimmering, hot—like a wall of flame, like a living thing twisting its way up Sherlock’s spine, making him feel dizzy and light-headed, shivering, hot and cold at once.
Before Anderson can open his mouth a voice cuts over him.
Sherlock sags back against the cables, half-dragging John with him, his hands still limply clasped in the front of John’s jacket, his bones turned to liquid.
He knocked again.
He’s embarrassed by his jealousy—he knows it is childish—foolish even, and he’s reluctant to make it known to John. Then again, maybe saying it out loud to John will make it easier to banish from his mind.
Sherlock takes another step beyond his reach, just to be safe, and is about to continue his way down the hall when he realizes the Colonel is still speaking to him.
His swollen cock is throbbing insistently against the front of his trousers, begging for attention, but Sherlock will not touch himself. It doesn’t feel right that John should be up on deck in the darkness, suffering under Anderson’s petty ministrations all because of Sherlock.
As hard as he tries to feel nothing but sheer confidence and self-possession as he walks through the door, Sherlock cannot stop the low hum of nervous tension building in him at the reality that he is at last going to come fact to face with this man.
“Stop being such a fucking tease!”
“I can’t… God, Sherlock, your mouth—”
The sooner Sherlock is able to deduce what’s going on with the captain, the sooner he will gain the leverage he needs to get Anderson
He could feel Sherlock struggling to lower his hips back to the couch, to give John some air, probably mortified that he’d lost control of himself so profoundly.
Ironsides lays a comforting hand on Burns’ shoulder. “I think you’re a most striking older gentleman, Burns.”
He’s shorter than Sherlock realized. Now, standing near to him it’s clear that if he were to straighten up, the top of his head would come only to the level of Sherlock’s eyes. Something about his presence on the quarterdeck always seems to add several inches to his height.
Sherlock can feel his face growing hot with irritation at Deverall’s incisiveness. He’s normally able to lie more convincingly, but he feels caught off guard by Deverall’s questions. He’s not sure whether to blame the alcohol he’s drunk, or the shock of being interrupted in the midst of finally making his escape with John. Either way, he’ll be damned if Deverall manages to ruin this for Molly.
“You’re not,” John’s voice is dreamy, low and sinful. “Everything about you is the opposite of ordinary.”
John must see the change in Sherlock’s face because all at once his voice is softening, his palms smoothing up Sherlock’s thighs with utmost tenderness. “No more of that, remember? I'm here because I
But looking at it, that sounds greedy and ungrateful, so Sherlock adds a parenthetical
Sherlock reads over the letter John sent yesterday before he goes to breakfast as if to say to himself:
Miss Hooper nods, and then reaches down to press Sherlock’s hand briefly in gratitude. “Thank you.”
“Oh, my love,” John’s voice is a sigh against Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock nods, breathless, all too aware of the shallow rise and fall of his own chest, how slick it is with sweat. He feels a drop creep down his abdomen.
Sherlock was white as a sheet.
Sherlock opens his eyes and looks up at John to find him grinning mischievously.
“Yes,” he breathes into John’s hair, his voice faint with anticipation. “Yes, I want to hear it.”
a result of Anderson’s own wishes. Anderson would have had to request the change in leadership, he would have had to ask for permission first and the only person on board who has the authority to do so is—
Sherlock’s entire body shivers once, hard, and then John’s mouth is opening on his and his tongue finds Sherlock’s—lovely, warm and wet, and Sherlock moans softly and leans into the kiss, opening his mouth as wide as possible to invite John in.
And at this point, his lack of knowledge about Marcus’s real identity seems to be more of a potential danger than his knowledge of the truth. If he really does fear that Lestrade will break Marcus’s heart, he may well do his best to keep them apart.
John felt a stab of sympathy, thinking of Sherlock alone in the flat for two weeks, realizing in a sudden blaze of feeling how he really felt about John, utterly uncertain what to do about it. It occurred to him that Sherlock was probably even more unsettled by the revelation than he had been—at least John had experience with these kinds of things, feeling sexual desire, falling in love. As far as he knew, Sherlock had kept himself very far from anything like this for the majority of his life.
“Will you think I’m completely mad if I tell you that these four days have been the longest of my life? Four days!” John laughs but the sound of it is utterly without humor; it is a breathless, desperate sound, like a man drawing in his first lungful of air after almost drowning. “God, Sherlock…”
All that risk had been for nothing.
He will never forget a word of that note, even if he lives to be a hundred.
The note of steel in John’s voice as he says this makes the hot feeling in Sherlock’s chest leap higher, and he can feel a blush climbing up his throat.
“How long have you been watching me sleep?”
“Two months before I was sent home for medical leave, we were doing a routine drill in the desert when a gang of snipers ambushed us. Most of my men knew what to do, but there was one soldier, a new recruit, Perkins—was his name, he panicked. He ran out, got shot. I could have stopped him. It was my job to stop him, but I didn’t get there in time. He bled out in my arms. He was fucking terrified and there was nothing I could do to help him.”
“That’s good.”
But the look between them is interrupted by a new set of shouted orders from the lieutenants, and now everything feels like it is happening at once, as a group of sailors push past Molly and Sherlock to position the first of the longboats into place above the water, and Sherlock sees the captain begin to descend the stairs down from the quarterdeck, followed by Deverall and Lestrade.
His hands slide up Sherlock’s back, his breath a sigh. “I wanted to make you feel better... and to tell you the truth, I couldn’t wait.” John shuts his eyes then and their faces are so close together Sherlock can see John’s lashes trembling against his cheeks. “God help me, I couldn’t wait.”
John put his hand over his mouth again, this time unable to deny the enormity of what Sherlock was telling him.
He glided toward the attendant, proffering the invitations with a disinterested flick of the wrist.
It was difficult to tell through his waterlogged haze but judging by the force with which John slammed the door of the cab when they pulled up outside 221, Sherlock feared the answer might still be ‘acute.’
He still felt strange; his head woozy, his skin oddly thin, as though the world around him was waiting to press in through his flimsy defenses, but he was desperate for a drink of water, and desperate to escape the heat of his room. He couldn’t bring himself to go back to sleep just yet. There were too many hot and poisonous things lurking just out of sight on the edges of his mind, and he wasn’t ready to succumb to them again so soon.
He continues stroking, the rhythm of his movements faltering only slightly as John resumes his own attention to Sherlock’s cock and the place inside him.
Sherlock’s eyes climb all the way up to the very top of the mainmast where John often sits, but the sailor currently keeping watch is not John; neither are any of the men Sherlock can see in the rigging.
She wipes at her eyes, her expression apologetic, even through the tears.
The captain has emerged to oversee the proceedings; Sherlock can feel his presence on the quarterdeck without even seeing him—like a long shadow cast over the working bodies of the men.
pale fingers lifting, warm press of your mouth
That’s it then. The poison was never intended for Lieutenant Lestrade. Somehow he must have gotten Knott’s glass by mistake. Or maybe it wasn’t a mistake at all…
“I know,” he says, voice low with shame.
John lifts himself onto his elbows to smile down at Sherlock, a lock of salt-stiffened hair slipping down into his eyes as he does, the sun, a glittering halo behind his head.
It takes all of Sherlock’s effort to tune back in.
He starts to rise to his feet, embarrassed that he’s been caught out, sure that the young man is making fun of him.
“I… I don’t—”
seen Sherlock this affected before.
But there, underneath his pleasure, Sherlock can see something darker too: there is sorrow there, written into the lines around his mouth, between his eyes, hidden in the recesses of his face.
To John’s great relief, when he set the steaming plate at Sherlock’s elbow, he reached for the fork without hesitation and began shoveling curry into his mouth. He still hadn’t removed his eyes from the computer screen.
“John.”
Sherlock has seen John in all states of physical duress, has observed the power in his arms as he tows the line, muscles hard and gleaming under the sun, his face running with sweat as he turns the capstan, body bowing against the weight of the anchor; but this state of exertion is like no other Sherlock has witnessed.
“Good—good. Wait right here.” John squeezes his shoulders lightly, his expression intent. “Do not move from this spot.”
It’s glorious, but
“We’ve got your hand all ready for you here, John.”
He threw his head back with a scream and then he was coming, his body shuddering and clenching around Sherlock’s cock, wave after wave of pleasure moving through him as his cock throbbed between them, spurting pulse after pulse of hot liquid onto his belly, onto Sherlock’s chest. The pleasure kept coming, and John felt distantly that Sherlock had stopped thrusting. With the last ounce of his energy he lifted his head.
John shut his eyes, savoring the feel of Sherlock’s heartbeat pounding steady and sure against his own ribs, his calf twined around John’s thigh, Sherlock’s fingers loosely holding his wrist.
He put pressure on the blade, ever so slightly, and John felt the first spike of pain lance through him.
“Oh… oh yes.”
Sherlock sighs at the sight of it, shifting forward on his knees with that same anomalous grace that seems is only ever granted to him in John’s presence, and without pausing, he takes John back into his mouth, humming softly with gratitude at the heavy weight of that blood-hot flesh as it meets his tongue.
Sherlock’s own trousers are uncomfortably tight with the force of his erection, his breathing fast and shallow as John’s mouth slides up to Sherlock’s ear, his voice warm and heavy as his hand begins to pull loose the fabric of Sherlock’s shirt from underneath his waistcoat, John’s fingers sliding in against the bare flesh of his hip.
“It’s obvious you were never going to catch up with me,” he pants, tilting his chin up and trying to look imperiously down at John. “And I’m ready for my kiss now.”
Sherlock
The suit was his own, (of course, with Mycroft for a brother, you’d
He had been holding too much inside himself—so much,
Sherlock began to rub his cock through his trousers, his mouth dropping back to the side of John’s neck and
His head fell back against the mattress as Sherlock’s mouth closed over the head of his cock, cheeks hollowing as he swallowed half of John’s length in one slow slide.
“It wasn’t just a dream. And I kissed you back, John. I kissed you back because as soon as you said it, I realized you were right. I won’t waste anymore time. I won’t do it. Not with you. Not after… everything. So I offer you this as proof.”
“What is?”
“You may trust my judgment in this matter, Lieutenant. I’ve been a naval officer for too long not to recognize the signs. Anderson may be a fool but I have a feeling his suspicions on this matter are not unfounded.”
The wind snaps in the sail above them.
“You were…” John struggled to maintain the thread of what he was saying as Sherlock’s warm, ripe mouth began traveling down the skin of his throat, pausing to suck at the curve of his shoulder. “You were telling me which ones smelled the best and which ones…” John’s fingers clenched on Sherlock’s. “Which ones…”
He works at it late into the night, hunched over the paper, pages and pages of notes spiraling out of him until his candle burns itself to nothing and he lights another, disregarding the fact that he may regret this decision later. He only has so many candles to his disposal on the voyage. But for the moment, Sherlock doesn’t care. He couldn’t stop writing even if he was dragged from the tabletop.
They stayed like that for what felt like minutes, exploring each other’s mouths, John using his purchase in Sherlock’s hair to bring him closer, his leg working its way between Sherlock’s.
As Sherlock listens to the words John is singing, it strikes him that maybe the reason there is so much emotion in John’s voice is because he is thinking of a particular person as he sings. At this unwelcome thought, Sherlock feels a spike of sorrow in his chest.
Sherlock buries his nose in the scent, inhaling deeply, wriggling his hips against the mattress as the smell brings him a renewed flood of memories—the taste of John’s skin under his tongue, the smell of that golden hair beneath John’s arm—so strong, so viscerally the smell of
Sherlock does not let him finish. Using his grip on the front of John’s shirt, he drags John’s mouth up to his own, pushing his hips forward into John’s as he does so, his own voice a low whimper caught in his throat as John slides his other hand around to grip Sherlock by the arse.
“There was no stake out,” Sherlock said, tugging his gloves back on over his knuckles with fastidious care.
“What—” Sherlock swallows around the tightness in his throat, forces the words out. “What led you to it? A life at sea?”
John let a long breath leave his nostrils, watching the engorged head of Sherlock’s cock twitch in response, the muscles in Sherlock’s thighs tensing under John’s weight.
They turn to go but before they can make their escape, Miss Gibbons reaches out a hand to press Sherlock’s arm briefly. “If anything should go wrong with the ship in future,” she says with a nasty smile, “I guess I’ll know who to blame.”
Sherlock undid the last few buttons with enviable ease and John pushed Sherlock’s blazer off his shoulders, taking the shirt with it. He sighed, as the long pale expanse of Sherlock’s chest was uncovered. He ran his hands down the plane of bare flesh, still disbelieving.
John slid his hand back down Sherlock’s chest and took hold of his cock, slicking his fingers liberally in the fluid leaking from the tip and stroking down the length of it once, slowly.
Sherlock can feel himself responding to it, body going pliant in John’s arms.
He follows behind John, silent as a shadow, as he makes his way to the staircase leading to the upper decks.
He licked his way back up Sherlock’s spine, tasting sweat and the heady taste of Sherlock’s skin that was so distinctly his own. Burying a hand in Sherlock’s curls, he pulled his head back, biting down hard on the side of his neck.
He knows he’s already used some, but just a little bit more won’t make any difference… and he’s enjoying so much the world of his dream, he’s wondering if he can’t help his imagination along…
He looked down to see Sherlock, sitting back on his heels, the picture of serene propriety, save for his swollen, shining mouth, and the fact that John could see his chest rising and falling rather too quickly beneath the front of his waistcoat.
With a burst of sudden energy, he springs off the bed and begins picking up the items that lie in disarray around his room, and putting them back in their proper place.
The captain’s smile widens. “Death, Mr. Holmes. The punishment is death. Take care to remember it, in the day’s ahead. Now, if you would do me the kindness of removing yourself from my presence as quickly as possible, I would be much obliged. I do have a ship to run.”
John tastes like the liquor he has been drinking—sweet and full of fire.
Sherlock’s eyes seem to have taken on the color of the ocean behind him. He brings his face right down to John’s, turquoise eyes sparking. “Would you prefer to die here with me instead?”
“Sherlock…”
He passes the time rehearsing the very stern lecture he plans to give to Sherlock about the social incorrectness of faking your own suicide and tricking your best friend.
Desperation seizes him. “No… you’re doing it again! Don’t.”
She begins to back away.
Sherlock feels his stomach go cold with dread but then he hears a familiar voice call out to him.
Frustration—fondness—exasperation—relief.
“OUR WHAT?”
The way he says it makes it clear that he suspects another reason.
“Hello, Beauty.”
“Come on!”
somewhere near by—makes a shudder of revulsion crawl down Sherlock’s spine.
He tries to use every bit of knowledge he has gathered about performing this activity on John to his advantage now, and it frustrates him that he can’t do all the things he would like—that he can’t touch John in all the ways that he would like. He wishes that he could ease John down onto his back and pull his knees up, spread his thighs apart, so he could have access to
Sherlock’s answer is a sigh as John’s fingers grip him more firmly.
John stopped dead in his tracks at the sight that greeted him.
“I imagined
John pushed his tongue deeper, seeking out the entrance to Sherlock’s body, stroking when he found the wrinkled hole, pushing Sherlock’s cheeks apart to give better access to his mouth. He began to lick the sensitive place in long, slow strokes.
“If we’re trading apologies, then I suppose I should tell you I’m sorry I pinned you to your bed.”
—speaking thoughts he has had so often they have become a part of himself.
Sherlock swallows hard around the knot of jealousy congealing in his throat. It’s stupid to be envious of someone John knew before he even met Sherlock—stupid and petty. But Sherlock finds an ache opening up inside himself at the knowledge that he will never get to know this John—this younger, carefree foolish John as yet untouched by the miseries of the world.
John’s voice is rich and lovely. He seems to know the rise and fall of the melody as well as he knows the feel of the ship under his feet, the rope under his hands. Sherlock can tell by the loving way John’s voice curls around the notes and seems to savor each one, that it is a song he has known a long time, that it means a great deal to him.
Sherlock is almost impressed.
“Yes,” John says, breathless, recapturing Sherlock’s mouth between every word, his own hands going to Sherlock’s half-unbuttoned waistcoat and pulling at the buttons, twice as fast as Sherlock could. “Yes, yes, yes.”
Sherlock’s eyes are flickering around the flat. He takes in the flowers on the desk and pulls a face. “Oh,
Thanks for reading! And as always, comments are greatly appreciated! :)
Sherlock huffs his disbelief but John catches his mouth before he can turn away, fingers tangling in Sherlock’s curls, settling his weight more firmly between Sherlock’s legs and rolling his hips until Sherlock is gasping into John’s open mouth, thighs spread as wide as they will go across the bed.
This time, when John takes Sherlock’s wrist in his hands, Sherlock’s fingers grasp him back. He stares up at John, his blue eyes brilliant against the red of the blood, his grip surprisingly reassuring, strong.
Molly turns to look at Sherlock and the exhilaration on her face gives Sherlock an absurd feeling of hope. If Molly can be this excited, even when confronted with her grim fate of being bound to the ship, how can he possibly feel anything less?
“It was so stupid of me, John. It was my fault. I could have prevented it. I
However, instead of kissing Sherlock properly like Sherlock wants, he lets his parted lips just graze Sherlock’s, the movement deliberately delicate, providing just enough contact to make Sherlock ache for more of him.
He wrings out the sponge, sets the cake of soap back on the corner of his desk, and dresses himself—feeling more awake, more alive than he has felt in days. He has forgotten how good it feels to be properly clean.
He approached the funny-looking little door, his heartbeat pounding in his throat. Other than his elevated heart rate and the sweat prickling his palms like so many little needles, he felt eerily calm, hollow, wiped clean of emotions.
Sherlock’s breathing was ragged against him.
But John just smiles, shaking his head.
“Shut up and put your arms around my neck.” Stooping down, John slid one arm under Sherlock’s shoulders and the other under his knees and lifted him with surprising ease into the air. He caught the wince of pain on Sherlock’s face. “Sorry,” he grunted. “Hold on and I’ll go as fast as I can.”
There is the usual period of stunned silence that occurs after any of Sherlock’s remarks and for a moment Sherlock wonders if they’ll all just ignore him and proceed with their individual conversations, but then to Sherlock’s profound relief, Colonel Jackson speaks up.
The nightmares are hard to take.
Sherlock doesn’t like the way Stevens is watching their conversation from down the line. He can feel the other man’s eyes on him, like a brand on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
“I’m so sorry.” The tears are streaming down her face and for a moment John is jealous, jealous of how easy it is for her to express what she’s feeling. He will never be able to cry like that, not even for Sherlock.
This can’t be real—only dreams
It doesn’t make sense—any of it.
How is it that time can move so differently between one day and the next?
“I- I have an idea.” Sherlock lick his lips, struggling to catch his breath.
cheating on you with her aerobics instructor, I’m sorry to say. But you knew that really, didn’t you? Deep down.”
John is still waiting so patiently.
It isn’t that the man has done or said anything to raise Sherlock’s alarm, but there’s something in his presence that rankles Sherlock, like an itch under his skin, something about his mood that acts as a counter to the general good humor of the group of working men.
Sherlock’s body feels warm and loose and every second John’s tongue works at him, his body melts a little more, pouring forward into John. He can feel the movements of his own mouth becoming increasingly desperate as John’s hands rub small circles at the base of his spine, thumbs seeking out the notches and smoothing over each one with attentive delight.
“It’s… strange but good. It will feel even better in a minute… it just takes a bit of getting used to when you’re out of practice.”
He hears John drag in a ragged breath above him as he makes an effort to still his straining hips. “I’m not—I should warn you I’m not going to last long… it’s been too long, and your mouth—
It was real then, everything that happened. It wasn’t just a dream.
“It’s something I…”
In one swift upward stroke he slit the garment in two, along with the t-shirt underneath. The blade just missed the underside of John’s throat.
“Oh, John. John, John, John. My John, I’ll never leave you again.”
The room is so quiet Sherlock is certain they can all hear the dull thud of his heartbeat, the sickness rising in his belly.
John holds himself still, breath coming out warm against Sherlock’s lips, and Sherlock is grateful that John understands, that as much as he wants John to keep moving, to press in further, for his tongue to come out and find Sherlock’s own—he needs a moment to absorb the feeling of just this, the miracle of John’s mouth against his again.
It feels so good, just lying here beside John. He feels more aware of his body and all of its sensorial dimensions, as if the ocean has awakened some slumbering but fundamental part of himself. And instead of the unpleasantness and revulsion this awareness sometimes brings, it’s only positive now.
And then he rises from the table, and without another word, pushes his way through the crowded tavern towards the door.
“And you’ll want to be clean for what I have planned…”
As soon as the cab started moving, his head drooped down to land on Sherlock’s shoulder, his body melting into Sherlock’s side. Vaguely, he registered Sherlock stiffening beside him at the contact but he was too tired to pull away. He shut his eyes and began to drift as he felt Sherlock gradually relaxing beside him, his hand coming to rest on the top of John’s thigh. John turned his face toward Sherlock’s neck with a sigh and he felt Sherlock lift his chin to accommodate him. Sherlock’s fingers began to move slowly against his leg.
“And I guess you wouldn’t want to know that they’re down there right now getting a nice stockpile of the goods. I believe Sawyer and his companion will make quite a profit.”
John settles his head on one hand and smiles up at Sherlock, blinking sleep out of his eyes.
She leans in towards him and says in her brittle old voice, “I didn’t want to say anything in front of the others, but I wanted to let you know that any time your young man needs a place to hide again, you can count on me.”
“You have given me everything, John.”
He purses his lips together as he tries to think how to respond but before he has a chance to she intervenes.
(See the end of the chapter for
John was right. The heat from yesterday—the heat that he said signaled an impending storm—has gotten worse. The air feels even more loaded than it did the day before—full of pressure, crackling with an electric presence that makes the hair stand up on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
The roar of the crowd intensifies and Sherlock feels warmth fill his cheeks as it dawns on him that they are cheering for
“I think he was relieved to know that Lestrade was finally going to catch something of a break. It’s clear from what he said that he knows how Lestrade feels about Molly. I think… I don’t know, but I think he may even try and help them find some time alone together. So… I don’t think he’ll ruin it,” Sherlock concludes somewhat reluctantly.
He finds himself thinking longingly back to the bucket of hot water John brought him after his illness—god, what a luxurious experience that had been.
He can already feel the tightness gathering, the feeling like a spring coiling tighter and tighter at the center of himself. His fingers clench in the lapel of John’s jacket, his mouth falling open.
When he finally sits up, he flips his head back to be sure that his hair is pushed off his forehead instead of running into his eyes.
The mood today, Sherlock is hardly surprised to see, is a somber reflection of the dismal proceedings of the afternoon.
Her face is turned toward John and although Sherlock cannot see her face he can see John's expression as he looks at her and the look on John's face is one of unmistakable adoration.
If a few men are still down below then John must be one of them. Sherlock could ask Deverall—he could do it. But his distasteful jealousy for the other man stops his mouth as effectively as any gag, and before Sherlock can think better of it, Deverall has stepped up to the gangway to climb down the ladder.
But he shuts his eyes and waits for the feeling to pass.
He can do this. He just hasn’t been concentrating hard enough.
He keeps at it until he can walk the length of his room without holding onto the bed—and without falling over. As soon as he accomplishes this goal and has dropped back to sitting on the bed, he is disappointed to find that he is exhausted from the endeavor.
John’s words are soft, his voice shallow with arousal, and they can both feel—Sherlock can sense it in John’s body as clearly as though it were his own, in the tightening of the muscles in his chest beneath Sherlock’s hands—as soon as John finishes speaking how quickly the humor of John’s sentiment dies, as the reality of their situation once again makes itself known.
His hands are giant’s hands compared to John’s small, strong ones—Sherlock’s fingers long and spindly, ghostly white, pale in the darkness against the warmer tones of John’s sun-browned skin.
“I think you’d do better if you stopped askin’ so many questions. Askin’ questions leads to nothing but a licking.”
“Spiders.”
The tears are still creeping down his cheeks but more slowly now.
The silver-haired Burns nods and turns back to his companion.
Sherlock nods.
“It’s so good, John,” he gasps, his own breath panting out around his words. “You feel s-so good.”
Surprise ripples through Knott’s expression—he didn’t expect that. Sherlock sees he is impressed.
“But—how?”
He draws his mouth up slowly, and then allows himself one more self-indulgent lick over the slit, circling the head of John’s cock with his tongue, before swallowing it down again. Then, keeping one hand at the base to guide his movements, he begins to bob his head in a steady rhythm, his other hand on John’s splayed thigh.
Sherlock freezes, his heartbeat roaring in his ears.
Sherlock’s heart pounds harder in his breast; he’s stricken with the sudden, irrational fear that Ferguson will be able to make out the outline of the stolen paper under his jacket.
“I’d like that.”
He knows that this far into the voyage fresh food is sadly lacking, and it’s no fault of the cook who had to prepare it, but Sherlock’s sympathy for John’s friend Stamford does nothing to make the food more appealing.
Sherlock’s fingers were circling the swell of John’s palm, his touch inquisitive, appreciative, not quite light enough for John to convince himself he was imagining it.
John is looking at him with a frightened expression on his face.
Sherlock does not move; he does not breathe. His face is turned away, pressed in against the damp and splintered wood. He’s wearing a dark jacket. Maybe Stevens has bad eyes, maybe he won’t see him, maybe if he is lucky—
Looking over at his companion in the lamplight, Sherlock can see sweat standing out on his brow, and notices with a sharper pang of worry that his color is not right.
John grins at Sherlock through the darkness. It’s the first time the emotion on his face has looked genuine since their run-in with Stevens. “Just gets riper and riper the further down you get.”
“Lift your hips for me now.”
Sherlock is frozen, overwhelmed with the desire to reach out and touch, to try and offer some kind of comfort, but he’s afraid—afraid that it won’t be enough. And it’s all he can offer. If that fails, there’s nothing else he can do.
But as he moves to take his seat, he looks again, and sees that many of the glances are not accusatory or scandalized at all but rather curious and full of cautious interest.
Now that the angle is right, Sherlock can finally let himself go, his whole body thrusting into John’s, rising and falling in John’s lap, as steady and even as the tide, the sweat running down between their foreheads mingling, their bellies pressed together—warm and slick and filthy.
He’d taken his cock in his hand without even realizing it and suddenly he was coming, arching up into his fist as the freezing water pounded his back, sobbing with the intensity of his release.
Sherlock considers this. He has heard about press gangs, the navy’s infamous method for forcing men into service as a means of crewing warships, but as far as he knows the practice is limited to men who already have experience at sea.
John’s hand around Sherlock abruptly loses its rhythm as Sherlock repeats the movement, this time pushing downwards with his hips to stroke back the opposite way.
This time, John couldn’t hide his rage.
He often needed to test the effects of various chemical compounds, and who better to act as a guinea pig than his flat mate? It was a perfectly logical option. It wasn’t as if he could test the various tonics and tinctures on himself. How could he possibly keep track of the results?
He broke away with real effort. “No fair! You’re still—pants!”
He heard Sherlock make a sound like a sob beneath him, and rise up on his elbows to push himself closer to John. He let go of John’s arms and reached up to cup John’s face between his hands, kissing him back with equal tenderness and fervor.
John shrugged, feeling doubly foolish.
“Until tomorrow.”
“Keep your elbows tucked, forearms close to your body. Remember move with your hips. Counter my blows with your hips.”
Sherlock didn’t notice, his dark head was bent over John’s other foot, pulling the sock into place.
John struggled to maintain distance between them as he dragged Sherlock closer to the bed. Sherlock opened his mouth and his lips traveled, soft and hot, along the underside of John’s jaw. John gritted his teeth against the sensation.
Sherlock glances back up at John. There’s sweat glistening on his forehead, on the curves of his pectorals. His nipples are erect and flushed dark and Sherlock’s mouth fills with water at the sight of them. He’s half-tempted to bend down and take one into his mouth but he doesn’t dare move.
He’s so deep in the blank fog of his own wretchedness that when another knock sounds on his cabin door a while later, he almost doesn’t hear it.
his body contracting around John’s finger and the sensation only adds to the force of his release, his torso curling, heels slipping on the mattress as his body draws in against the force of it.
Sherlock is momentarily startled out of his discomfort by the realization that this is the second time Miss Hooper has told him that he’s done something kind. Sherlock is not aware he has a kind bone in his body.
John’s wet hair is slicked back from his face, and Sherlock thinks, not for the first time, how handsome he looks with his hair pushed back off his forehead. Sherlock studies him up close. There are little beads of water standing out against his skin like jewels—gathered in his eyelashes. Sherlock is seized with the desire to kiss each one and realizes with a giddy swooping sensation of glee that he can.
“It’s always a bit strange at first, but what you’re feeling now shouldn’t last long. It usually takes a couple of hours before you get used to it.”
Sherlock has never heard anything like it.
“You better return it to me in decent shape!”
“I just can’t—” Sherlock’s breathing was shallow. “I can’t stand people like him. Hurting other humans is one thing. They so often deserve it, but animals…” Sherlock shook his head, his blank eyes still unseeing.
John felt Sherlock’s tongue push against his own and John tilted his head to take Sherlock deeper into his mouth. The sound Sherlock made in the back of his throat in response was enough to make John’s knees give out. He clung to Sherlock’s back, his leg pressing in between Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock dragged his teeth over John’s bottom lip. Oh god. They couldn’t keep doing this on the street—they needed a bed, yes—a bed would be good.
John dropped the bowl.
John turned his attention back to his computer and tried to tell himself he wasn’t just staying away from Sherlock because he couldn’t deal with his feelings. Updating the blog was important. They had followers now who wanted to know the details of what happened. He was also hopeful that writing about the encounter with Moriarty would help purge the experience from his mind.
He fired again, and this time one of the dogs broke away, yowling.
Sherlock has done nothing in the last two days save for mope and wander the corridors of the ship thinking of John.
He regrets saying it now—wishes he could take the words back. He reaches for his pint for something to do with his hands and drinks down half of it without looking at any of their faces. When he sets it back on the table he stares into it as though it’s the most fascinating thing he’s ever seen in his life, watching the foam cling to the tankard’s tin insides.
