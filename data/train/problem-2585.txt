As it was now, he had to save all of that for later and make his friend presentable before heading out for the evening to the task that awaited him.
Henceforward, Mycroft will be your only source of communication and that option needs to be used very sparsely to avoid catching unwanted attention. When receiving your invitation to Magnussen’s house you need to tell Mycroft so he can forward this information to me, but beyond that, don’t reach out to him unless it is a case of emergency.”
As usual he had mixed feelings when seeing Sherlock like this.
John pulled a face at those words.
John was tempted to tell him that he might actually have the opportunity to work there himself soon enough but then he decided against it. Better to see where this ended before he went ahead of himself and told things that might not actually happen.
“Although it never was his favourite way of administering drugs, he occasionally snorted back at university. It caused him terrible nosebleeds, so he stopped doing it, but who knows, maybe he’s less concerned about ruining his septum these days,” Mycroft dryly commented, standing behind John’s back, peering over his shoulder at his wayward little brother, hands crossed over his chest in a protective stance.
But still, it nagged at his attention and the thing that struck him as really odd was the fact that there was a rack to begin with. What purpose did it serve if it was unable to be of proper use?
Hesitantly John followed, unsure of what this was all about, even more so as the room was quite dark and his eyes had quite some difficulty adjusting to the dimness at first.
Instead of answering Mycroft walked over to the door and opened it for the both of them.
It’s not a reprimand, simply delivered in a factual tone, Mycroft forever being the pragmatic one.
Sherlock stared back for a second but did then turn his eyes away to switch his attention onto the host without verbally acknowledging John’s presence. He looked a bit uneasy and John wondered if he had made a mistake by coming here.
“You looked positively sick when he kissed you! You can’t expect me to believe that you enjoyed that spectacle in there?”
The realisation of this makes his blood boil as he considers the invasion of privacy that has been breached without him having so much as a clue.
Then Lestrade came pounding up the stairs and broke the moment by waving a document in his hand and talking rapidly, pushing Sherlock into case-mode and the game was shortly after afoot.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and after a second’s hesitation, he spoke, trying for a flippant tone.
Mycroft’s face turned cold, his stance suddenly straightening considerably in his dressing gown, no longer any traces of vulnerability left.
Stranger: How would I know? SH
Suddenly his eyes got wide and his breathing changed, "Sherlock, I just stormed out of my house after calling my sister and father drunks!"
Sherlock groaned, "There's always something."
You: edward steerrt is wrhee it isd ahaaa -jw
Sherlock almost laughed, almost. He may not have known him for very long, but Sherlock knew John was different from other people; John was strong and wasn't sniveling all over the place as if the world had ended, because John knew it hadn't; he knew it was going to keep turning no matter what happened tonight or what happened tomorrow. Sherlock could see John's mind working out every single possibility and mapping the possible after effects. That's how John was different, but John couldn't hide his story from Sherlock, he had tells he didn't even know he had, and Sherlock could tell he was in his fight mode—survival mode.
Something snapped in John, suddenly he wasn't anxious, he was angry. This fucking hypocrite. "You know, she does seem a little different. She kinda reminds me of you dad." He laughed though none of this was funny. "Hell, why don't I take up drinking too?! We can be the drunk Watsons, and all of the neighbors can point and laugh as we stumble down the street!"
"Well you're certainly not going alone! If you're going to be stupid, you can at least be reasonably stupid. Don't look at me like that, you know I'm right."
"Actually, it might be best if I go home. I shouldn't have left with both of them drunk," he started to get up and Sherlock gave him a panicked look, "one of them's probably murdered the other by now."
You: i TOLDD YOU i dont havbe my shojes i semm to have lsot them -jw
"Mum!" Sherlock tinged pink slightly.
"Sorry," was all he said.
"Harry," John's voice cracked with anxiety.
"Oh yes, of course! It was lovely to meet you, John!"
"See you tomorrow."
Sherlock scoffed, "Please, she loves you like a son already. She didn't shut up about you after you left, she'll go crazy that you're staying."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
John was losing a lot of blood, noticeable not only by the amount pooling at Sherlock’s knees, but also in John’s pale skin. He was shivering but also sweating, going into shock perhaps; Sherlock pressed his knee to the wound to keep pressure on it while he took off his jacket to lay on him. His eyes were going glassy and having trouble staying open.
Stranger: He was a soldier, he could have knocked me flat. sh
"Dad I'm leaving!" he called on his way down the stairs.
"She was nice," John noted as they continued walking.
"Chemistry."
"No."
"You what?" John asked, wide eyed.
Stranger: Ugh. Tell Mycroft you can’t come in until you’ve showered, or he’s drowned you in the Thames. SH
John shut the door behind him, a feeling of unease in his stomach. "I'm home!" he called out.
"Tomorrow," Sherlock agreed with a wave.
"Stop doubting yourself, of course I still want to be friends with you."
Before his dad hung up he added something, "Tell Harriet I need to speak with her when she get's home, I got her report card today too."
You: at a bagel barf i thnink -jhe
"I invented it, I'll be the only one in the world. When the police are trying to solve a murder and ultimately failing to do so, they'll call me," Sherlock explained with a mix of pride and smugness. "I'll tell you one thing, if your scalpel work is anything like your handwriting I won't be going to you to patch me up," he teased.
This boy definitely knew how to shoot it; John was dodging bullets left and right all the while trying to cover Sherlock, the lunatic chasing after the trigger happy preteen.
He shrugged off his amazement, "It's alright."
"No. Girlfriends aren't really my area," Sherlock hinted.
Stranger: Your shoes? Things that go on your feet? SH
Stranger: Thank the lord. SH
Sherlock tsked, "That's all wrong," and the next thing either of them knew, it was seven o'clock.
"But..." John started, "Elephants can't jump."
"Where are we going?"
You: YESS I MNAY NOT BE AS CLEVER AS YOU SHERLY BUT I KNOW THNIGGS-JE
John pursed his lips and shook his head.
"No."
"If I tell you, you won't do it. I don't offer my tutoring services for free," he added with a smile.
He didn’t look away as John was blinded with flashlights in his eyes and poked with needles, he resisted to urge to remind them he’s allergic to codeine, they know, he didn’t look away as they loaded him onto a board and wheeled him into the ambulance.
There was a sharp tap on his window at around 8, John froze on his bed having been waiting. He got over his moment of "Maybe I shouldn't go," and looked out the window to signal that he was on his way down.
"Yeah, go ahead. Have fun, you deserve it Mr. Straight-A-Student! Do you need some money?" He pulled out his wallet and passed over a chunk of cash.
Stranger: Yes, I agree. But he also has a car, and knows where you are. I lied about Edward Street. SH
Stranger: Ah. Mycroft, I mean it. I /will/ shoot him. SH
"Love you too, bye." He hung his head, still leaning over the sink
"I'll get my mum to drive you home."
Sherlock watched carefully as John crossed the bathroom and slid down the wall, bringing his knees into his chest and tangling his hands in his hair. He walked over and sat next to him on the dirty bathroom floor.
It soon became apparent to John that Molly had a bit of a crush on Sherlock, every time he glanced at her as he told the story of how one of his teachers was wrong that day, she blushed and looked away.
"Are you good at math then?" John was eyeing one of the shelves, reading over its contents.
"Then why does she blush around you all the time?" John challenged.
John knew that eventually someone would get lucky and hit him, though when it happened it wasn’t how he thought it would; he’d assumed it would be by a grown adult, but this was a twelve year old boy shooting at him, with surprisingly good aim. Maybe not so surprising, he was in a high stakes gang, everyone needed a gun and they needed to know how to shoot it.
Sherlock entered the room again fifteen minutes later and could already see what John was opening his mouth to tell him. "Oh, do make up your mind," Sherlock said, though the corner of his mouth had raised and he seemed relieved.
"What took you so long?" Sherlock asked as he closed the door.
John made a half-arsed attempt at straightening his posture so he didn't look so pathetic; Sherlock pretended not to notice as he set the clothes down next to him.
"Ello, John," his dad greeted.
"Mum," Sherlock warned. "I'm sure John would like to go inside now."
"Am I wrong?"
John turned towards the window of the cab, opting to ignore Sherlock completely.
Stranger: Impressive. Bend down and tie your shoelaces without throwing up or falling over. SH
"Her study, I'd assume," he replied in a bored tone.
"It's not due until next week."
Stranger: Yes, and do you have any idea where edward street is? SH
"How about we study and then drop you home, and then later tonight I'll wait outside your house and if you decide to come with I'll be there and if not, no hard feelings," Sherlock suggested.
"I'm open to it." He sat down and beckoned John to sit next to him. "What about you?"
Sometimes the best way to fight, is to surrender. In certain situations, if one chooses to fight right away,  they'll find that they've unintentionally hung themselves. If they surrender, however, there will always be a chance to fight again, so they might as well try to bargain with the enemy first.
“John! Do not close your eyes. You are not tired,” he demanded, slapping the side of his face. John blinked awake for a bit, but soon after was drifting again, much to Sherlock’s panic.
"Is this what kind of a friend you are? Controlling and manipulative?"
You: i dontf think so -jw]
"I said shut it, Sherlock."
Sherlock sighed heavily in defeat. "Fine. Give me ten minutes."
"I don't need money. Do you want to go to your place or my place?"
"I'll have you know, it's almost impossible to open a bag with a fertile pig without a bit of splash, especially when you're working by yourself. Anyways, mine stench is explainable, you, however, stink of bourbon. Though judging by your lack of inebriation tonight I'd say your father was drinking it, your whole house probably smells the same."
"Glad someone is, did Harry tell you where she'd be when she decided to disobey me?"
"Well, the idea of that makes me shudder." Sherlock laughed assuming he meant the idea of the assignment being due tomorrow.
"It interests me," he shrugged.
John laughed this time and Sherlock grinned, and when John went home after his stay at the hospital no one said anything when John woke up in Sherlock’s bed after not being able to stand the couch any longer.
Once they were in the cab Sherlock started explaining what he needed to observe, "This is just an everyday robber, but I need practice at identifying criminals and what sets them apart from normal people."
"John Watson," he held out his hand to shake, but Mycroft simply looked at his hand and back up to his eyes; he let it drop. "Are you Sherlock's brother then?"
Stranger: And you, presumably, are not. SH
"Me?" John exclaimed, "What about you? You reek of formaldehyde! Did you have a biology experiment you decided to swim in today?"
Suddenly something surged through his dad, causing him to flop over the back of the couch and land sharply on the floor before he sprung back up, "Wait! Give me a hug!" he semi shouted.
“John just stay awake for one more minute, the medics are here. I swear to God John, if you close your eyes one more time I’m going to dump acid on your bed and you’ll be sleeping on the couch for a month!” Sherlock’s voice trembled with fear as John disobeyed him.
"I'll feel guilty if I don't pay you something; I think your place would be best." There's never any telling what awaits Harry and him after school.
"No."
You: i azm john hanish watsono -jw (haha gott it)
“It’s already been done,” Sherlock said, clenching his gut so the feeling of panic and worry would stop bubbling inside to explode. He had to save that for when John wasn’t hurting. John was hurting, his gut told him. He could hear the sirens, he looked up to find that George had ran while Sherlock was distracted.
"Well you never bring anyone over," she turns to John in the car, "I'm always telling him to bring sweet little Molly over, but he never listens to me. Have you met her?"
"It's nice to meet you," John stuck out his hand.
"Idiot," Sherlock said. "You've been staring out the window the past two minutes, where did you think you were?"
"She likes you, you know?" John smiled when Sherlock looked confused. "She has a crush on you."
John sat across from him, taking out his chemistry textbook, knowing he wouldn't be eating today because they'd been assigned three pages worth of problems. He could feel Sherlock's eyes on him as he worked, but did his best to ignore it.
His voice trailed of for a second, and when he spoke next, his voice was hollow.
“That Trevor bloke is going to go ballistic, I swear. He always acts so superior when visiting this place but he looks like one step away from the cuckoo’s nest whenever something doesn’t go his way.”
John sighed and rose to a seated position on the bed. He felt a bit sticky and longed for a shower but realised that a wash needed to wait until he got back to the barrack.
So it was a true herculean effort that John managed to sound more or less normal when he answered Magnussen’s polite request, remembering Sherlock’s words from the other night, about playing his role as impeccably as he possibly could.
It had naturally been tempting to make him disappear. Mycroft had many times fantasized about doing just that as he had the means to pull it off if he wanted to, but the problem of Magnussen still remained, and that man was a whole other level of difficulty.
Miotic pupils.
John could obviously see the allure.
Then he finally turned his head to look at John, a small smile playing on his lips.
“Why ever not? Are you keeping some skeletons on display in one of your many rooms? I thought you never left any evidence of your affairs out in the open, considering how many times I have stressed the importance of never leaving a trail to be abused by others.”
Except for one thing.
Mycroft observed him expressionlessly.
But he wasn’t going to waste more time pondering the outcome of that despicable man when he had far more exciting things to think about and look forward to.
To his displeasure, none of these options gave him any satisfaction though, not even when moving on from theory to action by throwing a few shirts down on his bed as if to pack them in a suitcase, or snatching Sherlock’s very expensive headphones down from the bison skull and dumping them in the bin.
When they finally broke apart from the kiss, John panted for air and Sherlock’s lips looked swollen and debauched.
John waited for a second, hesitant if he should risk a bullet to his back for replying, but as there was an evident pause to the monologue, he took the opportunity to speak his mind.
“Was there ever anything inappropriate going on between you and your patient, Dr Watson?”
But he had a funny expression on his face while making these denials which made John silently question if he did in fact have some knowledge about the stranger’s identity.
It was disconcerting to watch the man that had held Sherlock and Mycroft’s fates in his hands so tightly, now incapacitated and limp on the bed, half naked, glasses crooked, utterly vulnerable and defenceless.
Sunday came and went and so did Monday without a word from anyone about Sherlock and the state of his situation or the fact that John had walked out of the house in the middle of the night, without an explanation.
Being a person who seldom backed away from a challenge, he knew what the answer had to be.
Sherlock didn’t answer, too engrossed in something he was reading on the screen.
But seeing how close to comatose the younger man was, maybe it was a good thing that his brother was there to answer some questions on his behalf.
“It’s not criticism, most people make terrible actors. “
“Mr Trevor invited me the other day. Came by the facility to give me back my medical bag that I had accidentally misplaced and he took the opportunity to extend an invitation.”
The thought had not crossed him back then, naturally, as he had not been aware of the surveillance of the living room yet, but now it seems plausible that someone with Mycroft’s obsession with information and surveillance would not have settled for only
“But you were a bloody teenager! High on cocaine for God’s sake! Surely that would be considered justifying circumstances?”
“So is keeping a stolen service weapon from the army, tucked away under your mattress,” came the cool reply. “Now, start moving.”
And besides, Sherlock isn’t around to scold them anyway.
“Oh, it’s a two-edged sword, I assure you.”
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
“Magnussen implied that my brother’s prying annoyed you...” Mycroft tried but was immediately interrupted.
on your part towards my brother, but let me make this clear, a fantasy is all fine and well to a certain extent, but when it starts clouding your judgement it’s wise to know when to take a step back and accept reality for what it is. He is going to be married in less than two months and there is nothing you can do to alter that fact.”
His lips purses occasionally and twitches as well as he recollects certain moments like the argument about strychnine in the sugar bowl that had simply been labelled with the letter D as in “danger”, perfectly logical in Sherlock’s opinion but straight out preposterous not to mention alarming for someone about to pour a spoonful of it into his morning coffee.
He remembered feeling the same thing once after abruptly quitting cocaine and he had succumbed to the drug because the hallucinations had been deemed too real to handle back then. He had overdosed shortly afterwards and been forced to quit anyway, so no huge defeat in his opinion.
“Why would a few hours alone, working on a case you yourself initially assigned to me, mean that I somehow have treated John unfavourably? I left the phone behind because I didn’t need it, not because you two should read it as a sign for you to interfere.”
“Wait, what? Mycroft had secret missile plans in a safe in his office?”
Magnussen circled him and then he reached out and let his hand touch one of the arms that was stretched above the head, letting the fingers move over the firm muscle beneath the smooth skin in appreciation.
The invention of Jeremy Marcus proved easy enough, using a combination of his own personal traits combined with the ones of a criminal element they had caught wind off six months ago by the name of James Moriarty.
“How do you know I actually went to all that trouble? Maybe I just decided to take the actual stuff instead, to save myself from going through the hassle of faking an overdose?”
As a child Mycroft used to dream of wanting to hide Sherlock away somewhere to prevent others from taking pieces of him, to take him away from his brother. This is as close to that dream as he has ever come, and only because it became a necessity .
And a few weeks into their affair he realised that he was dangerously close to actually falling in love.
After a night of very little sleep John paced in front of the barrack, waiting for the car to pick him up and take him to his new patient.
But what about the second effort? Or the third?
“What the hell have we just done?” John laid spent on the bed, his skin still glistening from sweat and stared up at the ceiling. “This might have been the most ill-advised decision I’ve ever made…”
“How do you know that it’s a medical bag?”
“Let’s go inside and I’ll fill you in.” And without waiting for a proper invitation, Magnussen stepped past Dr Roylott and disappeared inside, not bothering to see if the others were coming as well.
“Sorry, sorry, just stretching my legs,” John begins and straightening himself to look more put-together. He feels short in the presence of these men in black suits and it irks him that he cares, but secretly he does and he tries his best to look taller, more solid, like the former army doctor that he is.
It was a threat of course and for less than a second the idea of Magnussen having anything on him made Mycroft’s head actually feel dizzy, although he outwardly remained as impassive as ever. If Magnussen had something, what could it be and was there a way out of it?
“You must have killed people during your time in the army. I don’t understand why you’re so squeamish about the subject of killing someone all of a sudden. It’s not as if anyone’s asking you to do it, Mycroft will handle it. Besides, those hands of yours are hardly lily white and untarnished from blood.”
"No, not yet of course. But selling him out in the way you are about to do, what else would you call him by the end of this evening?"
Pemberton was apparently both stupid as well as unrepentant and immediately snapped back.
With his scrutinizing eye he noticed that there was something a little unsettling about the other man as he stepped inside Mycroft’s office.
John nodded.
He has brought a case with him that he wants Sherlock to take a look at but Sherlock is naturally having none of it, as per usual. There is more sniping between them and Mycroft reaches out his hand to grab at Sherlock’s wrist as if to rein him in or calm him down perhaps.
“What the hell.....” he blurted out and at the sight of his surprised outburst Sherlock’s mouth twitched a little in amusement.
John stares at the photo as the memories wash over him.
And then it hits him the way he imagines Sherlock must feel like when he has a breakthrough in a particularly tricky case.
Alarm bells immediately went off inside John’s head as he recalled his own hasty departure earlier today, the state of Sherlock’s appearance, the carpet in the dining room that was bound to be both smelly and a bit stained after their sexual activities. Even if both of them had tried to take most of the ejaculation into their mouths and swallow it, he vividly remembered cum dripping down the sides of his lips, eventually ending up smeared on the carpet. Not to mention the smell of post-sex that always lingered in a room afterwards.
He actually had to bite his own tongue to prevent himself from blurting this out. Such words were neither demanded nor asked for. If anything they would probably cause Sherlock to stop what he was doing and get a pitiful look in his eyes instead before making an awkward excuse and withdraw. So instead of succumbing to the impulse of declaring his secret feelings John steeled himself and allowed himself to only feel the physical part of what his body was experiencing and not what the heart wanted him to express.
John snorted at that.
Why was everyone he came into contact with at this place stark raving mad? And how had he failed to realise this sooner?
This place was quite the opposite with so much to look at that it almost made it hard to know where to rest your eyes first.
He blinked several times, as if woken from a deep and heavy slumber, his head not fully capable of properly grasping the situation. But then he slowly rose from his bed, his heart increasingly pounding rapidly inside his chest as he straightened his back and stepped out through the door, ready to face whatever was waiting for him outside.
Sherlock really needed to tread lightly with that man or he would risk aggravating the doctor even further than he had done previously and they could hardly afford a second falling-out.
“I find that piece of news highly unlikely. I haven’t heard a word about you resigning from your duties.”
At the end of what looked like a corporate maze, in a room without any windows, and the only source of light was coming from a dimly lit panel in the ceiling, Mycroft was sitting in front of an elegantly decorated table, complete with a tea set of fine china, cake and a white tablecloth. Two cups were already prepared, the steam rising from them as John entered the room and Mycroft in greeting raised his cup before taking a sip.
The man waivers between the evident anger John is showcasing and the very long shadow of doom his employer casts, but as one threat is present right now while the other is not, he finally does what he is told, grabs his phone from the table next to the computer and leaves.
“How so? Where is Dr Watson by the way? Have you sent him away on account of my visit?”
“It rather depends on the one doling out the punishment I think,” he said cheekily, the hint of mirth in his eyes.
He kept all his secrets and blackmailing material in some sort of vault that only he had the ability to gain access to. Both Sherlock as well as Mycroft had tried it a few times but all their efforts had been unsuccessful so far.
As he made as how of slamming unnecessarily hard in the kitchen cupboards while trying to look for a clean mug to take his morning coffee in, John heard the front door banging shut downstairs.
“I see. He got in trouble then, I take it?”
As they entered the elevator and she pushed the button to the top floor, she offered a more detailed description than what she had given earlier.
Sherlock wasn’t here and damn if he was going to stand there and actively listen to the filth that was being said right now.
He had not yet had the pleasure of enjoying his breakfast but as he had been up several hours already, it didn’t feel out of the question to take a sip or two from the Laphroaig he had available whenever he needed its soothing effect on his nerves. Whatever was necessary to get past this visit that he feared could take hours, depending on Victor’s unpredictable temper and inquisitive investigation.
Could John really live with himself if not coming to Sherlock’s aid if something actually happened to him?
Less than a minute later they are out of the flat, climbing into the black car Mycroft has at his disposal and they’re off.
So instead he decided that he needed the distraction of some actual work to clear his head and stop agonizing for now. So after a quick shower and a change of clothes he headed over to the facility and joined his co-workers for the afternoon shift.
Sherlock looked at him, eyes hard now, more similar to Mycroft than John had ever seen him before, and he felt the ice in his chest seep out into his system, veins running cold as the harshness of realisation hit him.
“No, he usually works by pulling the strings from the shadows, most people don’t know him as anything beyond that Scandinavian media tycoon who owns a lot of our gossip rags as well as a right-winged news channel that runs 24-7 with nothing but pre-ordered propaganda in favour of those who follows Magnussen’s orders and keeps his businesses afloat.
But this!
When Sherlock finally moved out of here this room would need to be sanitised from top to bottom.
“Sherlock is currently suffering from a drug induced coma caused by an overdose and has been moved to a private facility where they are doing their best to bring him back from his unconscious state.”
A far as plans went, it couldn’t have been more straightforward.
“A zoo has the option of safety. This has not.”
That meant nothing of course.  Sherlock would be there.
Despite being a person who didn’t feel the need to resort to the killing of others unless strictly necessary, Mycroft actually looked forward to disposing of this particular creature and he could even find some comfort in the idea of sealing Victor’s fate by giving the order himself.
This time there was a small but distinct crack of the material and encouraged by his success he raised the fire poker again with determination.
Sherlock gave him a crooked little smile but didn’t deny his words. Instead he just put his pants on and then reached for his discarded packet of cigarettes on the table before he walked over to the large window where he leaned against the pane in a relaxed position.
Normally Mycroft wasn’t a person breaking social codes by interrupting other people’s dinner parties and as he realised that Magnussen wasn’t alone, he felt like backtracking out of the room again, excusing himself.
“Sorry to be unable to provide any entertainment value at this last hour,” Sherlock muttered.
Or, and it was difficult to say if this theory was even worse, the fiancé was a compulsive cheater and it was Mycroft who ordered the tests to be made. It was fully plausible that the older Holmes brother would be able to carry out such an order considering what John had managed to piece together regarding Mycroft’s personality.
For a second Mycroft almost thought that Magnussen was going to add some pointed remark about the food and his eating habits, but of course he didn’t. Not everyone was as straightforward and untactful as his little brother.
He was not obligated to go back to work for the rest of the day so at first he lounged about a bit, read a little, watched some telly and enjoyed the freedom of a day off. But as everyone else were away at work and the barrack was empty, he soon grew bored and after a lonely lunch with a soggy microwaved Tikka Masala, he decided to join the others for the afternoon shift.
Their eyes locked for a second, a silent war of wills raging between them, as had been their habit since childhood. But Mycroft did not budge and perhaps this was the best proof of Sherlock’s state of mind that he was the one to give in first, far earlier than he usually did.
Sherlock seldom smiled, neither in real life nor on photos, he almost always looked very serious and when he did occasionally twitch his lips, it was in a gesture of sarcasm or insincerity.
The other man was younger, in his early thirties perhaps, tall and somewhat sturdy, chestnut-brown hair combed back from his face and the generic appearance of a businessman with a grey crisp suit and a tie.
Sherlock had talked very little about Magnussen’s visits to his bedchamber, never going into any specific details, but he had mentioned that Mycroft’s security cameras always monitored them in case Magnussen would slip up and say something they could use against him.
“What do you mean?”
A deep sigh was heard and the tall dark figure in front of him, once more obscured by shadows as the moon had disappeared behind a cloud, slumped, as if in defeat.
Mycroft lets out a heavy sigh while he lets his hand draw slowly over his face in exhaustion.
John turned his head and saw a tall, thin man with a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles and a penetrating stare stand next to him, his eyes shifting from John back to the painting again.
This caused an uncomfortable churning at the bottom of his stomach just thinking about it, and this was hardly the place to address such an issue, and yet, there was a limit to what he was willing to endure.
And with that Lestrade taps the front of his pocket with a look of affection on his features before his attention turns once more to the box of old items that’s still in front of them. John silently takes a deep breath to brace himself and then he turn his attention to the box as well, letting the memory linger for as long as it takes for the dull pain to slowly subside.
Shaking his head to rid himself of the quite idiotic blathering that he has no use of right now, he walks further away from the surveillance room, going down the hall.
“As I said.
The dark figure in front of him shrugged.
This John didn’t look disappointed thankfully.
“Like I said then, we need to make it work.”
It would have been tempting to just decline. Sherlock had no wish to expose himself to whatever chiding Mycroft had in store for him, but the option, that his brother decided to voice his misgivings in the presence of John was far worse, so reluctantly Sherlock followed him down the stairs, to the front door to send Mycroft off, leaving John in the flat to put the kettle on.
“And I agree, it needs to be on speaker.”
This short epilogue  will offer a darker twist to the story, so those who liked where we left our happy couple in the previous chapter should stop reading after that and consider it the end.
Magnussen’s smile widened a little.
Then Magnussen sighed and gave Sherlock a long evaluating look, rationalising that his guest at least would not be able to go anywhere while he left to sign the delivery.
“I’m afraid the staff has gone to bed but I trust you know the way out of course.”
The building where the media mogul resided was, as would be expected, a towering construction with a rotating sign at the roof top with the letters CAM announcing to the world who the owner of this corporation was, all in line with how John had remembered his home to be, the very opposite of Mycroft’s humble discretion regarding details and the wish to remain anonymous.
Mycroft was the one who decided to speak eventually, the natural taker of control of every situation and as he turned his eyes to look at his little brother there was a hint of disappointment in them, flashing behind the perpetual coldness.
A few hours later he was abruptly woken by someone shaking him ruthlessly, his name being called and as he pried his eyes open to look at what was causing such a disturbance he saw the same woman who had taken him to Mycroft on his very first visit to the Holmes household, standing next to his bed, shaking him by the arm.
But John wouldn’t have like this at all. Because he was also a protector.
In a rare moment of physical contact between them Mycroft reached out and grabbed his brother’s chin so he was forced to meet his eyes when he spoke.
“I must confess that I also do enjoy the opportunity to show him off, you know, allow people to see what I have. What’s mine and only mine, so to speak.”
He knew at the time that he might have been dangerously close to crossing the line to pantomime, he is not after all the real actor of the family and didn’t really know how far he should take it.
“Sherlock. His name is Sherlock. He prefers to be addressed by his first name and not Mr Holmes. So if you could abide to that rule....?”
“Sorry, I just went there to perform health checks, nothing more. I have no idea what this is about.”
And that’s when John notices it.
But the window was empty now.
John couldn’t help but roll his eyes for emphasis, once he had begun allowing jealousy to seep into his words it was surprisingly difficult to stop it seemed. But whatever Mycroft had picked up on regarding any underscoring tones in John’s words he didn’t address them, instead he just crisply replied:
“A pleasure to meet you, Sherlock. And what is it that you do? Aspiring to be like your brother and enter the corridors of Whitehall, perhaps?”
“What do you know about it?” he asked suspiciously but if this annoyed Mycroft, he didn’t let it show, his features remaining as impassive as before.
“What is it that you’re scared of exactly?”
When the dealer came by and presented him with the stolen missile plans Victor was still very bitter and heartbroken about our break-up so he had the surprisingly cunning idea of putting the plans into a zipper bag for preservation, my DNA and fingerprints all over them and then put the whole thing away for safekeeping until he knew how to use this ticking bomb to his best advantage.
“ I wouldn’t have thought you to be a humanitarian, Mr Holmes.”
He stepped over to the end of the bed, reached the stick out and effortlessly captured the snake by the noose and swiftly put it in the burlap sack. It was the movement of someone used to handling the snake, effortlessly and in full control.
Sherlock shook his head disapprovingly, as if Mycroft was suggesting something ridiculous.
Everything John has been told about Mr Marcus has been second-hand information, none of the men he talks to has met with him in person, but they have all heard of him. Even Mycroft can’t describe him in detail because they only communicated through phone or e-mails.
“Well, your shortness of breath...,” Mycroft began but was interrupted.
He recognised none of them by appearance, so at least he hadn’t interrupted an evening with someone that could tell people
John was beginning to feel that he had no business being here, Magnussen was clearly interested in juicier things then the tales of a scorned lover if his own words were anything to go by.
“It will be here in five minutes.”
Tired fingers pinched the bridge of his nose for a few seconds, while trying to collect himself. Exactly four seconds later he removed them and leaned back in his chair, facing away from his desk, composed and neutral once more.
Apparently there had been ginger nuts accompanying his tea the previous four times and the lack of them now was apparently perplexing to him.
“No.”
But he did agree with Magnussen on one thing: it was much more preferable to be on the team that dictated the rules of the game, rather than being the one others toyed with, for sheer amusement.
Now the doubt was back in Victor’s voice.
As Mycroft swallowed down yet another piece of the food on offer, this time a bruschetta with cream cheese, asparagus and crab fish, reaching for a glass of sparkling wine to wash it down with, he felt himself being watched and as he turned his head he was met by the calmly amused smile of Charles Magnussen who was standing a few feet away, glass in his hand and assessment in the cold dead-eyed stare.
“Well, that’s another shirt you owe me, Dr Watson. This used to be a favourite of mine. Apparently it brought out the blue tones in my eyes, according to the sales person.”
“Yes, but since when have you ever listened to me? Or anyone for that matter?”
Whatever the reason, he is sure it will be matter of no importance and consequence to him and he actually whistles a small tune as he grabs his umbrella from the stand, twirling it in his hand for good measure before he heads out the door to meet with John Watson.
The more John thought about it, the more advantages did he see.
He was firmly pushed aside to make room for whatever it was that these men were doing but then one of them more gently had pulled him by the arm towards the door, spoken to him even if he afterwards couldn’t remember what had been said, then he was escorted out of the room, the door closing firmly behind his back.
“I’ll bet there is no one who’s had to endure what I went through though.”
Sherlock shook his head, haughtiness for a second flashing in his eyes.
“I know everything there is to know about you.....” the voice replied from the darkness behind his back.
He had been penetrated orally while passed out.
Charles Magnussen had meanwhile made his way over to the head of the table and now inspected the foursome seated on each side of him, his eyes running from Mycroft to John, then across the table to Sherlock and finally Victor, and John suddenly got the distinct feeling that everyone else around that table were only there as extras, a part of the tableau presented but of no interest or value to anyone.
Mere seconds before Lestrade had entered the room where the photo was taken, he and Sherlock had been engaged in a passionate kiss, John’s hands deeply buried in Sherlock’s silky black curls, the sun warming their bodies as he had press them up against that window.
He looked like a man who had spent the last couple of hours pacing frantically back and forth, clutching at his hair. The normally rather neat haircut was sticking out at all angles, and he seemed rather wired up.
And even if Mycroft had initially not realised how far his brother would go in his efforts to get to Magnussen, he had to concede that John might actually have cause for concern. Or perhaps
“You’re such a talented little cocksucker, aren’t you?” he said and increased the pace even further, knowing that Sherlock could handle him being a bit rough, despite a small gagging sound coming from the outstretched mouth.
It was suddenly difficult to broach the subject that had brought him in the presence of the media mogul. In this sobering light, with no Sherlock in sight, and considering that no evidence suggested that Magnussen had anything to do with his disappearance after Sherlock had drugged John Watson into a forced sleep of oblivion, this suddenly seemed very futile and embarrassing.
The place must have stayed abandoned for years and he wondered how Sherlock even knew about it to begin with.
There was something in his voice that sounded strange when he said this but as he didn’t elaborate any further John didn’t ask any questions about it.
“Could you for once just act accordingly and stop playing theatrics? I can hear from your breathing pattern that you’re clearly awake. Just let us get this over with, you know I won’t let it go anyway.”
“Oh just put in the usual nonsense about my deplorable eating habits and the smoking, he loves to read about that, makes him feel entitled to nag about it afterwards. “
standing out specifically as a phrase often used by the future husband to be.
It doesn’t automatically mean that John would have succeed in his endeavours to become more intimate with Sherlock, considering his poor dating history and the frankly subpar technique he uses when trying to get a person to sleep with him.
And so forth it went on for the rest of the lunchbreak.
“On account of my own position as well as that of my future brother in law, it is necessary to sign a contract of secrecy as assurance that all of this remains confidential. I hope that won’t be problem?”
Mycroft resisted the impulse to reach out and placate the doctor with a calming hand. He abhorred physical contact almost as much as he hated someone making a scene. This was just another horrible situation aamong many this evening that he would simply have to endure before it was all over.
“Don’t be
Suddenly the door to the barrack was opened and a woman, smartly dressed in a navy-blue suit, her heels clacking against the hard floor as she walked, came striding in his direction.
He took his time, inhaling the scent of the other man, after having pried the cigarette out of his hand and thrown it out the window, allowing himself to roam Sherlock’s firm and lithe body, the silky touch beneath his fingertips accentuating the sensation of pleasure he felt pooling in his stomach as he basked in the realisation of being allowed to do this openly for once, to display whatever affection he wanted without the fear of anyone catching them.
No news of Sherlock’s condition and the realisation that the situation was beginning to look very grim had hit him hard, feeling like the situation was spiralling uncontrollably out of his hands had caused him to drown his sorrows in a glass or four, not counting the whiskey Mycroft had offered him this morning.
Yes and that’s what worries me,” he finally said.
His eyes blinked a few more times before they went completely dark and his body turned limp in the chair, all sounds fading away into the background and soon turning completely mute, as if someone had pressed a button to achieve utter silence.
“If I might use your bathroom for a moment, I’ll be right back.”
Those last words were uttered with a despicably sweet voice dripping with sarcasm and Mycroft pursed his lips at the obvious dig at his ability to stick to the truth.
Granted, he would probably have wanted to inform John of the situation, but still, in hindsight, it had been an unusual move. Mycroft had said so himself, that he came to see if Sherlock was actually still there, and the door to Sherlock’s bedroom had been closed, had not going there first been a more logical choice?
brother, not some cheap trollop for him to subject to any carnal urges, if such feelings were even to be evoked. He will respect decorum, I assure you. Like I told you earlier, he has a very cold temperament, very difficult to provoke.”
He knew he wasn’t going to let Sherlock end up harmed without at least trying to prevent it, however much it chagrined him to admit this.
Sherlock continued up to a third floor where he then turned left.
As he cycled home through the darkness 40 minutes later, his head full of guidelines and advice, his body surging with nervous anticipation for things to work out in their favour, his thoughts kept lingering on Victor Trevor for some reason.
So he nodded his head once and said:
It was the unexpected fact that a snake was slithered across Dr Roylott’s chest and had its fangs buried in the man’s throat that made John’s eyes widen in shock, just staring, unable to either move or react.
He switched his attention back to the scene on the bed and turned Magnussen around to check his vitals as well, even if subconsciously knowing what he was going to find.
And it was true, wasn’t it?
So alone it was then.
“Of course. And we are. Meanwhile, you are making yourself useful in here I see?”
The dining room was as luxurious as the other rooms with a huge white table in the middle, heavy velvet burgundy drapes around the windows, two intricate chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and the table set with large crystal vases overflowing with red sponge-like flowers while the plates were looking like they were made from actual gold. A black deer made out of porcelain stood in a corner to overlook the guests seated at the table and John was once again struck by how the interior design constantly toed the line of being too gaudy and over the top. Money clearly didn’t always mean that a person could pay for good taste.
But just as he had left the room, he was to be replaced by yet another unexpected presence, this time in the form of the grand superior of civil servants himself in all his arrogant glory.
“Of course. The moment my contact at the facility where Sherlock was being kept informed me that Magnussen had showed up and taken Sherlock with him, our plans changed according to the new direction of events. Going back to the house accompanied by Magnussen was always going to be a possibility and there is no use refusing an open invitation to the lion’s den if you have been caught in a lie anyway. We were prepared to deal with almost every type of scenario imaginable.”
“What I’m trying is that yes, I
And with those parting words the two men left.
addicts say. The incident this weekend was hardly your first time. Mycroft says you’ve been losing weight for a while now…”
He exits the surveillance room while buttoning-up his waistcoat once more and straightening his tie.
Magnussen gave him a cold stare but then turned his back to the other two in a show of privacy which seemed ludicrous considering where they were standing, in the middle of the rural countryside, darkness all around them, in front of the gates to the house of a man who might or might not have met with Sherlock this evening.
“I already told you,” John interrupted. “He lied me straight in the face and then he apparently drugged me to give me the slip. And frankly I don’t even care where he went. I’m tired of his games. I’m tired period. I want you to leave, Mycroft. Now.”
As he crashed into bed, the last thing his tired mind remembered was the image of Sherlock perched on top of that crate, with his legs crossed, his elegant hands moving as he spoke and his eyes sparkling with excitement.
“So that plan of yours, want to take me through it? I believe we still have a few hours before morning is here, so spare no details and start filling me in,” he said.
John sighs heavily.
He did not intend to go back to work upon his return this time, instead he was going to write up a fake report to send to Mycroft, take a shower and then enjoy a long restful nap.
He had tried to use his time wisely, thinking over the plan in his head during the long hours he had spent at the place Mycroft had managed to turn into a makeshift private clinic. It had been essential to make this situation look what they wanted it to appear like.
John had opted for too small and subtle hints so far and the object of his desires had stubbornly remained oblivious, to Mycroft’s great relief.
“Killed off you mean.”
“He isn’t feeling very well, Victor. He is sleeping most of the time, he needs his rest….”
“Eagerly looking forward to what it is you’re going to show me. Considering the nature of our victim, it is bound to riveting.”
As if being able to read what John was thinking, Sherlock slowly shook his head.
Not that he has ever particularly warmed up to the man who is Sherlock’s older and occasionally wiser brother. Mycroft’s personality tends to grate on John’s nerves, a feeling he is sure is fully reciprocated. They have learned to tolerate each other for Sherlock’s sake but there is nothing beyond tolerance and a half-hearted attempt at politeness.
“So, I see you didn’t bring anything with you, how do you suggest that we proceed with this?”
The man is as elusive as the fictional Jeremy Marcus and an expert at leaving no traces behind, and no one has ever managed to put a face on him, being more like a menacing presence than a physical man.
“I’m not interested in knowing if my traits are becoming or not. What I care about is knowing what my future husband and his doctor gets up to when no one is around to see it. It makes perfect sense for a man to look after his investments.”
“Then you shouldn’t expect someone else to do it for you,” John pointed out, crossings his arms over his chest resolutely.
It's staring righ at him and he slowly puts his hand out to reach for it.
But Dr Roylott did not seem concerned about this.
“Yes, yes, we had this conversation already. In fact, it feels like ever since we began looking for that mysterious vault, we have been doing nothing more than move in circles around the same subjects over and over again. I’m happily washing my hands of this whole mess and leaving you to deal with it on your own!”
John widened his eyes in shock.
Even Mycroft looked appalled by the demanding tone from Magnussen, despite being a person who never tolerated resistance himself. The bane of his life being that his own little brother was the one who constantly gave it to him.
That nutty old lady that insisted that she was only renting out her flat to them but almost bent herself backwards in her efforts to help them, well,
“They insist that it must be the receiver who does it. I tried explaining that you are busy at the moment but the delivery man was very adamant. And apparently it was a pressing matter. “
“Whenever I finally think that things are becoming reasonably normal between us, you go ahead and pull something like this. You just can’t help it, can you? All the tricks, the lies and the deceit, when does it ever stop with you?”
“Come now, this isn’t a court hearing, no need to be so stingy with your replies. I think you know what I might be referring to. Considering that Sherlock is engaged to be married very shortly, did the two of you, despite that fact, engage in something inappropriate? Anything intimate?”
He was allowed to wallow a little bit surely?
Mere minutes later the front door was slammed shut forcibly in his wake and the sound of his determined footsteps echoed down the stairs as he left.
“Nothing particularly exciting happened between Magnussen and myself. After he had insisted on taking a walk through that boring art gallery with the gaudily painted ceiling, we went on a ride along the river in his car before ending up at his flat around 01.”
“Oh, I have sprung into action already, believe me. I have every man at my disposal working on the case as we speak. But I’m also a realist, Dr Watson, and this time I’m afraid that the odds are working against us.”
This had naturally not soothed the already full-blown temper of Dr Roylott and the next blow had been to the side to his head, the probable cause for his black out.
Magnussen’s nightly visits will stop after the wedding, so there is always that to look forward as well.”
Did he perhaps think that John wouldn’t fit into this different type of environment were people paid others to spy on each other, because that was in a sense what he had come to realise that Mycroft wanted from him with his medical reports, a world where people controlled one another beyond reason, were in charge of Government-owned facilities where you looked at the staff like replaceable little cogs in a larger machinery that no one but a few select were privy enough to be knowledgeable of.
When one of his closest colleagues had been targeted by Magnussen a few weeks ago and had opted for suicide instead of facing the humiliation of public exposure, Mycroft knew that whatever fire Magnussen was trying to start, now was the time to smother it.
“You know, you have a spectacular way of making a person feel even more of an idiot than they did to begin with.”
“Well, as there was one so very conveniently available.”
The cheeks were glowing red and almost glistening from dampness and the eyes were closed, his breathing shallow, indicating that he had trouble filling his lungs with sufficient amount of air and Magnussen stopped a few feet away from the bed to look at the thin form beneath the bedsheets, trying to assess what the cause for this was all about.
John immediately lashed out.
John nodded.
He had never told John that he loved him or that he wanted things to continue after the wedding so what Sherlock really felt about anything was anyone’s guess.
Outwardly Magnussen looked like he usually did, a good suit, nothing too flashy but rather clean Scandinavian lines of a high-quality cut, the thin hair meticulously combed back, beard trimmed. His usual armour of appearance.
He went quiet for a second before he spoke his final words.
He could only see the backs of people surrounding the vehicle and most of them were co-workers while a few of them wore those white lab coats that were significant for staff members working in the reasearch facility.
Sherlock snorted and tightened his lips in irritation.
“I’ll make you work really hard, Doctor Watson,” Sherlock managed to mumble into the kiss.
There was something ominous about the way he said it though that made John’s stomach clench uncomfortably. And for a second he wondered if Sherlock might be contemplating a real overdose if the plan actually did fail.
It was a relief to know that Magnussen was beaten, even if the notion of it still was difficult to actually grasp. After being used to Magnussen throwing his intimidating shadow over their lives it wasn’t easy to realise that it could all truly be over now.
“I’m calling for my own transport home, so don’t bother coming with us. I have had enough of your company for the evening, Mr  Magnusseb. John! We’re leaving!””
“Well, then shut up and let me continue.”
“I didn’t bring anything for the simple reason that I was hired yesterday evening and the only thing I have left from my medical days is packed away in a self-storage in Hounslow. But I can check for vitals all the same, take notes of some basic information and then make sure to be better equipped the next time.”
There was a satisfying rip of fabric being torn, buttons scattering across the floor when John decided to rid Sherlock of his tight blue shirt by tearing it open with his hands to get access to those firm abdominal muscles visible beneath Sherlock’s soft skin.
He told himself that it most likely was on account of Sherlock being engaged, he had no true reason to hate the other man, he didn’t even know his name for God’s sake, and yet he couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable when he recalled what Mycroft had told him about the fiancé continuing to care for Sherlock’s welfare in a rather controlling fashion well beyond any normal concern from a spouse.
John who was seated in front of the telly, trying to focus on a decent documentary about the cold war, stared at him while processing this information.
John downs the remains of the whiskey in one go and then casts a final glance at the picture of Mycroft frozen in place on the screen, hovering above Sherlock’s still seated form.
John let out a choked sound of rising astonishment.
“What tipped
The delightfully thrilling man with the manic mannerisms that had alluded to all sorts of criminal activity and unsavoury behaviour despite Sherlock’s presence. He was clearly a bit unhinged if he allowed himself to make revelations like that in the company of a stranger, even if he probably had thought that Sherlock was one of Magnussen’s usual young men that he brought home for a night of entertainment.
“Now my other agents inform me that he apparently developed some sort of unhealthy obsession with Sherlock. Not too openly it seems, even if there supposedly was some lose gossip about his insistence of being the one in charge of camera surveillance. Naturally, that never reached my ears but believe me when I say that heads will roll on account of that omission of information.”
“He said that he fell in love with you on the very first day that you met. Doesn’t sound like just friendship to me,” John interjected.
“I thought that would make you happy, not be something for you to criticize.”
“I need to remember this case for the days when I’m old and grey and police work is far behind me. I need to remember that there were sunny days as well,” Lestrade had said and then ordered John to come join the photo, probably more out of politeness than actual need for him to be in the picture. It would have seemed rude to not include him as he was standing there anyway.
But no, this time, he had clearly made an exception and why was that?
Sherlock gave his brother an irritated glare.
He puts as much contempt as he can possibly muster into the word “
But as no one was seemingly waiting for him outside he decided that there was nothing more for him to do but to return to bed and get back to sleep, God knew he needed it badly if this was what his mind managed to do to him when he didn’t have enough rest.
Well.....
Granted, there isn’t much to indicate that the man in front of him is truly upset, it’s the small details, like the omission of a handkerchief in his breast pocket, the small pattern of crumbs on his front and the fact that his face has an expression that John up until this moment has never before seen on the man that is the British government, an expression he quite frankly didn’t think was part of the built-in hard drive that is Mycroft’s personality  because it would go against everything John so far has learned about Sherlock’s brother.
The problem with this relationship lark was that when you absolutely needed a little privacy it was impossible to be had and there was absolutely no way he could possibly tell John any of recent events without angering him. Worse than that, John might actually leave if confronted with this latest development and where would that leave Sherlock?
Sensing that the moment to make a decision was shrinking by every second passing by, but still wavering back and forth, the situation was taken out of hind hands quite unexpectedly by a loud crash behind his back and as he turned around to see what the commotion was all about, he noticed how the chair Magnussen had been sitting in was now toppled over on the floor, the man himself sprawling next to it.
John remembers Lestrade saying something about Sherlock striking a rather dramatic figure against the lighting from the window and had raised a camera to take a picture of it. It had been Anderson’s camera, the one he used while working, taking photos of crime scenes. Why Lestrade had it, John can’t recall, he just did and he was the one to take the photo.
“No matter. It will be a nice little surprise. He likes surprises, doesn’t he? Everyone usually does.”
As he no longer felt his legs he couldn’t tell if the situation was the same down there but his other arm went through the same liberating feeling and he actually managed to raise one of them, the one without the bite, so he could see it in front of him for a few seconds before it limply fell down across his chest.
Angrily John turns his head to stare at the agent who looks nothing but calm and unaware of the myriads of questions whirling inside John’s head this very minute, threatening to cause a major blow-up any second.
“There is a difference. I did it out of protection. Those I killed during my army days were bad people, people with weapons coming straight at me, intent on killing me if I didn’t shoot them first. Not people I actually knew.”
"Oh, I'd say it's classic behaviour for someone hoping to end up with a happy result by end of the evening!"
But a quick look at Dr Roylott who stood huffing, fury evident in his features, fists raised, told him that it was he who was the culprit.
Considering John Watson’s strong attachment to his patient and the way he had left his assignment in the middle of the night, not to return again, there was a big chance that there was something to be exploited if he managed to figure out what the situation actually was all about.
“Ah, yes, I recall now. Sherlock took it all rather well considering the circumstances. He was rude to the bloke of course but he wasn’t as scathing as I would have expected him to be.”
“I already gave you the answer to that.”
By the end of that night Magnussen was gone and Mycroft was free, but Sherlock was no longer breathing.
Sherlock did remember this feature from when they had met at Magnussen but the surroundings, the shadow he presented, made the impression even more remarkable than what he recollected.
He has been to Jeremy Marcus’s flat, watched the emptiness of the rooms himself, he has been to the river banks where Sherlock was headed on the night of his disappearance, he has tried talking to Molly, Lestrade, Gregson, Dimmock, heck even to Anderson, but so far he has nothing to show for his efforts.
“Yes, this was only a foretaste of things to come.”
“That’s what my mother said. But I can’t help it that I miss him sometimes. You should have seen him, he looked like a proper gentleman, always dressed in a suit. Mind you, not one of those stuffy ones, but sexy and tight-fitting, probably bespoke even if I never got around to ask him about it. He looked like he had been poured into it, you know, suiting that fit body like a glove or something.”
“I understand your protective urge to be the one saving him, but I’m his brother.”
What happens next is more a spur of the moment kind of thing than anything else and only possible because he spots a phone charger, most likely belonging to the agent, hanging limply from its socket on the wall.
John was just about to turn around to announce that it was time for them to leave, when his eyes caught something lying on the floor a few feet away from him.
John felt something sharp and hard twist in his chest as he once more opened his eyes and the image vanished.
Possessing Sherlock was like trying to break an unruly horse, it took a special kind of mindset and a will to succeed, Victor Trevor had certainly not managed it and despite many efforts Magnussen was still uncertain if he had done so himself.
That idea felt strangely unnerving, despite knowing that it didn’t matter in the long run. He would not be around to see who grieved his disappearance or not, he would not be the one left behind forever wondering.
The car pulled up in front of a white Regency style house and John got out and looked up at the building towering in front of him. It had several large windows where shadowy figures passed by, an enormous chandelier hanging from the ceiling in the room most visible from the street and the whole exterior projected luxury and wealth with every detail, from the polished façade to the gilded number plate on the door. No name though, no hint of who the house belonged to.
doing here?”
That he assumed it to be posh was solely based on what he knew of Sherlock and Mycroft, because with their public school way of speaking, the large house, the fact that they had servants and the way they dressed in expensive clothes told him that he dealt with people that belonged to a higher class than the average. He did not really know anything about Victor Trevor but assumed that Mycroft would never allow his little brother to marry some random pauper so most likely he was well off too.
Now John’s eyes actually narrowed.
And believe me, in the beginning we tried everything we could to get out of this mess. But to no avail. I’m still destined to marry Victor in less than two months and there is nothing to be done about it.”
“I’m calling my pilot so he can pick me up. You can escape if you want to, but I’m not offering you a ride in my helicopter. I’m not aiding a possible killer to escape. You’re on your own.”
“I don’t like repeating myself and I know you heard me perfectly fine the first time.”
Roylott whipped his head in Magnussen’s direction now. “Why the bloody hell did you bring these men here? You and I have no beef, but I won’t stand for this worm trying to act stroppy with me and if you side with him...”
“Dr Watson, happy to finally make your acquaintance. I have been hearing a lot about you for the past couple of weeks. “
“I would also like to inform you that I’m going to resign from my current position as well. In case you were planning to fire me. There is now no need to make such a threat as I’ll leave by the end of the month.”
John rolled his eyes even if no one could see it.
After that initial visit to Sherlock Holmes’s bedroom, where he had been given a first taste of what had driven Victor Trevor off the rails, Magnussen had commissioned a painting that quickly become a favourite of his, to be placed in his London residence as a reminder of what he had, a mere phone call away.
When Sherlock had dared to point out that John’s unjustified and quite childish jealousy was threatening to overcloud facts with silly imagination, and that the problem hadn’t been  Magnussen's sexual pestering, but rather the fact that Mycroft’s plan had been futile from beginning to end, did nothing to calm John down.
Deciding that there wasn’t much he could do about the situation at the moment, he went to work as usual to get on with his day as he normally would, hoping that he would hear from Sherlock eventually. In the meantime there was always that issue with Pemberton to deal with while waiting for his brother to cool off. He wasn’t going to embarrass himself any further by making any calls that would only go unanswered.
---------------------
It was either a hasty exit or the threat of actually turning on Magnussen physically.
John immediately lashed out.
“You can come as you are and change into your work uniform later. Your presence is asked for quite urgently.”
“I think your brother has allowed me to ravage you to my heart’s content if I only make sure to keep you on the straight and narrow from now on.”
“What for? Who’s asking?” John said, frowning.
“And yet, the concept of
John realised that being bitten in the throat in comparison to the way Sherlock had been bitten in the hand was a huge difference and considering the semi-paralyzed state Sherlock had been in, there was a risk that Dr Roylott’s destiny was coming to an end much quicker if his airway stopped functioning properly. Also putting into the equation that blood was now flowing from three different locations on his body made it even more believable that Dr Roylott would not survive this ordeal.
, John thought but didn’t say out loud.
He heard Mycroft talk in the background, and he did his best to mute the voice inside of him who continued to accuse him of his carelessness and try to concentrate on what was happening in the room instead. There would be plenty of time for regrets later, whatever the outcome of this situation would be.
"So we're friends then?" Sherlock asked wearily.
"Look who decided tuh come home tonight, Johnny. Even thow she's grounded n isn supposed tuh be out."
Sherlock and John have different viewpoints on why John comes along on cases. To Sherlock, John comes because he is helpful. He talks to families, he stops people from downright bullying Sherlock, he provides a unique view on the world which sometimes helps to solve cases, and he shoots like a sniper. To John, he goes because he needs to protect Sherlock. When Sherlock jumps, he jumps with him, it’s as simple as that. Which is why when John saw George the gunman take aim at Sherlock he didn’t think before he jumped in front of him.
You: SHERLOCK SOME CAR ISD FOLLWOSING ME- JW
You: two of me? waht aree you tlaking about. idk i showered tofsday-hw
"I want to be a doctor," John replied easily. He opened his notes and got out his assignment.
Stranger: John? SH
Stranger: Neither is yours, Mike. SH
You: Why not? He tried throwing things at /me/ too. -MH
You: That sounds like something a child would say. -MH
John reluctantly took a step forward, his dad practically lunged at him and fell in his arms. "Dad, Sherlock's waiting for me; I'm gonna smell like booze," he complained.
Stranger has disconnected.
Sherlock smirked, "I'm going to be a consulting detective."
John didn't notice Sherlock looking at him like he was a creature from an alien planet, or a pup that was easily startled, yet a brave soldier at the same time.
There was a moment of silence as Sherlock thought of what to say that might offer some sort of comfort to John. He didn't normally care about other people's comfort, nor did he offer to tutor them or invite them on outings. He could sense something different about John though, he could tell he wasn't as stupid as other people and he wasn't mean to Sherlock like the other students.
Sherlock grinned mischievously, "Oh, I know."
You: Your snark is not appreciated, Sherly. -MH
"I need an assistant for something; we can do it after we finish studying."
"No! I need help with chemistry," he said as he tried to dial his phone, his hands were shaking too much and he couldn't stop pressing wrong numbers.
"Molly, this is John Watson; John, this is Molly Hooper. I walk her home after school," Sherlock explained.
Stranger: Oh, Christ. What do you want me to do about the fact you’re lost, drunk and shoeless? SH
"Sammy invited me to a party later and then I'm spending the night at hers."
You: Apologizing would imply that I care, which I don’t. John obviously told you he was leaving to go pubbing; you should have stopped him. Again, I don’t care. -MH
John chuckled, "Then how do you know what you're doing?"
"I'm home!" Sherlock called out as they entered.
Because John was a fighter, Sherlock could predict his next move.
"That's not much better, Sherlock," John chuckled incredulously.
"Sherlock, dear!" a voice came from another room, the person it belonged to coming to greet him. "How was school? Who's this? I'm Mrs. Hudson, the housekeeper."
"I didn't think so."
"I can't just sit here and do nothing!" John exclaimed.
"You could get hurt!"
"See, I told you you wouldn't want to do it."
John chuckled halfheartedly, "Not really." The warning bell sounded, "I'll meet you at the front of the building after school, okay?"
"Yeah, why wouldn't I? I'm not stupid, I knew you were going to find out eventually. You have a reputation you know."
"Oh! Thank you, John, that's so sweet of you! But, please call me Wanda or mum," she gushed. "It's so nice to have Sherlock bring a friend over for once!"
"Oh, hush up. Where did you say you live, John?" The ride took barely ten minutes and when they pulled into the drive John nodded to Sherlock which bedroom was his while Wanda chattered her goodbyes. "Come back soon, okay John? You're welcome over anytime; don't be afraid to just drop by! If Sherlock's out you can just stay and chat with me till he get's back, not that he ever goes anywhere. I swear he wouldn't get out of bed it I didn't force him to—"
You: On second thought, it’s not that far of a walk for a former soldier. He could do with a bit of exercise. -MH
John was gasping for breath that wouldn’t come, clutching onto Sherlock’s arm and hoping to not pass out. “Was goin’ to shoot you.”
"A fish lives in water," John replied, not seeing how the conversation turned.
"It was nice to meet you, John."
"What? You can't come with," John said as if Sherlock were crazy, though it's not as if he had any room to talk.
"I'm fine, I just, I need to call my dad," he said between heavy breaths. "I need to, tell him I won't be, home till later tonight."
You: i seem to have losrt my shows hserlfocvk -jw
Stranger: Please tell me you’re not naked. SH
"Sorry, yur right, ssorry. God, you must be so ashamed o' me."
"Live a little, one night of no homework won't ruin you."
"You're acting different than before."
"You can pay me in a favor," Sherlock offered.
"Dickhead," John muttered through his grin. "I thought criminals were supposed to be like everyday people, how is this going to help? Do you even know what you're looking for?"
"Do you want to hear what I've deduced about you?"
"Wow."
"Why not? Is it dangerous?"
"I'll see you tomorrow," Sherlock said.
"No!"
"I have to be heading back," John said as he rubbed his eyes.
"You've known me a day! How can you know that?"
When John first saw his father hit his sister it was at the dinner table; he had found the report card she had been hiding from him that said she was failing two of her classes. John was 14 at the time, Harry 16.
Sherlock quickly spoke up, "Don't listen to him, he's an alcoholic too, recently divorced, frequently chooses booze over rent, and about to be evicted. You did the right thing, it'll turn out fine," he said nonchalantly, as if John's life wasn't in danger, because it wasn't in Sherlock's opinion. "Worse comes to worse, you can always live with me."
"I'll still do it," John insisted. "I promise!" he said after Sherlock gave him a look.
"You want to chase after a criminal?!"
Stranger: And what do you mean, the smell? SH
Stranger: I have barricaded the door. SH
They met at the front of the building after school like they said they would, but Sherlock said they were waiting for one more person. A couple minutes after a small girl walked over to where they were standing, "Hello," she greeted.
You: SHHERLY SHERL YSHEYLOCK -JW
Harry and their dad stared at him in shocked silence for a moment before he decided to leave and stormed out of the house. He didn't know where he would go, but suddenly the night air wasn't cold to him and it didn't matter if he ended up sleeping under a bridge, he just needed to get out of that house.
Stranger: Yes, it’s mycroft. Get in it. SH
Sherlock smiled, "Excellent! This is me," he gestured to a gated off house. It was bigger and fancier than John's, but still cute and modest; he loved it.
"She blushes around everyone, it's what she does."
"Why? Do you want to be cop?"
John shrugged, "I'll see you tomorrow then, yeah?"
Sherlock blinked, "Normally kids put off their homework until the night before, I just assumed it was due tomorrow," he chuckled.
Stranger: He’s completely inebriated. Throw something back, I dare you. SH
"I don't know! How much do I owe you?" he asked the cab driver.
You: No you won’t, Sherlock. Don’t be so dramatic. I’ll have him home in an hour fully clothed and smelling fresh, but from the state of him I’d say he’s already taken a swim in the Thames. -MH
"I will," John replied a little sadly.
There was still a five minute walk ahead of them and neither of them knew what to fill the silence with, finally, however, John thought of something, "So, what's this favor you want me to do?"
"Oh, right. Assuming I actually come," he joked.
"You like it?" Sherlock asked with a grin, he was being cocky and John could tell.
"Fuck off, John!" She pushed him away; he slammed her locker shut before storming away. "Dickhead!" she called after him.
"I'll be right back." He left John in the kitchen.
"Have you taken it before?"
"Central London."
“Then you let him shoot me! You don’t jump in front of me!” He pressed down harder as he spoke causing John to vocalize his agony as electric bolts shot through his chest and dissolved through his entire body.
You: im not nakedd appartently he was tlakign abno ut hte smell -jw
"See you tomorrow, it was lovely to meet you too." John got out of the car and waited until they pulled out of the drive to go through the door and face the storm he was dreading.
"Do you want to be a scientist when you're older?"
Sherlock heard the gunshot followed not shortly after by a gasp of pain and a lot of weight collapsing on him. “John?” He asked as he shifted the weight off of himself and gently laid it on the ground. “John! You idiot! Why would you do that?!” Sherlock shouted, putting pressure on the wound.
John looked outside to see they were outside his house, "Holy shit, I didn't even know we were here."
Sherlock eyed him cautiously, "We can reschedule for another day if you want," he suggested.
"I can and I have! I'm staying up all night to make sure you stay put, whether you sleep soundly or not."
"Oh, you caught onto her crush too huh? It's hardly her fault, Sherl is such a catch!"
Stranger: You’re inebriated, aren’t you. SH
"It's not that, I want to."
John wasn't sure what he'd just done, or what the ramifications would be. One thing was for sure, he did not want to know what was happening at home right now. His head spun just thinking up possibilities; he walked over to the giant bed to sit down, not trusting his wobbly, anxiety-ridden legs to hold him.
"No, an elephant is an elephant from the moment it's conceived and a fish is a fish the moment the egg is laid. You could just say the elephant is swimming and the fish is just jumping, but fish swim and elephants jump. Everyday people have the potential to commit crimes, and criminals had to be everyday people before they committed the crime. Criminals can be everyday people because they are everyday people, but once they've committed a crime they are a criminal that can act as an everyday individual."
You: what about edwaed street? you liekd?? how could you! -jw
You: SHERLOCKKKKKK -JW
"And you are?"
The guest bedroom looked as impressive as the rest of the house, causing John to shudder at the idea of Sherlock ever seeing the inside of his own house. He could almost swear he'd seen it in an interior decorating magazine that he'd looked through in the waiting room of a doctor's office. The bed was a queen with the fluffiest pillows John had ever seen; even the sheets looked better than anything he'd ever seen first hand—he didn't know what a thread count was, but he was sure these had a high one. There were two windows, both looking out into the driveway so the room was partially lit by street lights. There was also two mirrors, one above the dresser and one full length mirror next to the door, which surprised John more than it should have.
George’s aim hadn’t failed and would have hit his target had something not blocked it. The bullet hit John in the chest, just below his left shoulder, about five inches from his last bullet wound.
He was suddenly shoved to the side as medics surrounded John. He let himself be relieved for one second, which seemed to cue to the bubbles inside him to burst. He was shaking when Greg found him and pulled him out of the way.
"Alright, I'll see you later, love you."
“Sh..erlock. Sto..p. Just call...999,” he gasped out.
Stranger: Wonderful. Really, I can barely contain my excitement. SH
"You don't have to go," Sherlock reminded him.
Sherlock's head snapped towards John, "You still want to be friends?"
His appetite would disappear until all of his school work was done; if he got homework from his morning classes he wouldn't eat lunch until all of it was done. When his friends should have been concerned, they became annoyed. John was no longer fun to be around, all he did was focus on school, when the second semester of school started and the transfer students came in his spot at the table was soon filled.
Stranger: And I didn’t ‘let’ him, Mycroft. He went. SH
John was becoming afraid of their father; Harry kept making reckless decisions.
"I'll show you to the guest room. I might be able to find some pajamas in your size as well, but you'll have to stop by your house in the morning if you don't want to wear those clothes to school. Or you can borrow something of mine, up to you," Sherlock shrugged and led John upstairs.
Sherlock shrugged, "I'm better at science, but I understand the math that's involved in it."
Stranger: And that’s a low blow, even for you. SH
While Sherlock went to go talk to Mycroft about covering for him as they snuck out, John thought up every possible outcome and any possible solutions. The problem with that was he couldn't come up with anything that ended well. The more he thought about it, the more staying put sounded like the best and most logical decision.
You: WHY AM I SHOUTINGV? -JW
John went silent for a moment, "You can smell it on me? That's impossible, he hugged me before I left, but that smell wouldn't have stuck on that long."
The sounds of footsteps echoed through the building as police and EMTs stormed in.
"Why would you bring it up?" John asked getting frustrated.
That gave John a warm feeling in his gut and a smile on his face. The cab pulled into the driveway and Sherlock tossed a few large notes towards the front seat before dragging John excitedly inside.
John sighed, unbelievably tired. "Fine."
"Yah know, I can't really tell. Does she seem differun tuh you?"
"You're not," Sherlock stated before he launched into an in depth explanation. They only got through one page worth of problems before lunch was over and neither of them had eaten a thing.
"That's not necessary, I can walk," John dismissed.
"And what is your master plan, then? Are you going to go back there, in the hopes that your father and sister are just shouting at each other? What are you going to do if, god forbid, something worse is happening? You're still just a boy, John.
There’s really only one time John’s getting shot at, and that’s when he’s on a case with Sherlock. Thankfully, most criminals who own guns don’t know how to aim, so he’s never actually shot, but there’s a reason poker players don’t step away from the table when they’re losing. They know that eventually they have to win.
"Hello?" his dad answered on the second ring.
"If you want to be," John shrugged, looking straight ahead.
You’re now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!
"Oh, how lovely!" a voice came from the other room. "I'll put on some tea, John make yourself at home!" Sherlock eyed John in a told-you-so way, to which John rolled his eyes.
"This isn't fair! You can't hold me hostage!"
"What was the point of that exactly?"
John could feel himself pale, "Okay." Click.
John was so angry his eyes started dripping hot, angry tears.
John was fucking shocked, "No reason! They're my family! My sister could get hurt!"
You: grweg is at the bagel bar bozo -hw
"No! We can't, my dad, d-doesn't like me bringing friends home," he lied and started pacing.
"Hey, dad," John looked to where Harry was sitting on the couch, "Harry."
"Yes please, if it's no trouble."
"Thank you, but I need to go back for my bag anyway. I can wake up early and walk there, you won't even know I've left, so don't worry about needing to wake up early or anything," he rambled anxiously.
John scoffed, "Most logical what? It's certainly not a plan, I don't leave my fate up to hoping everything will turn out okay, Sherlock," he said bitterly.
Sherlock scoffed at his pathetic attempt. "My mom's a mathematician,"  he explained as he set his bag at a table and went to grab a couple of books off the shelves.
"Do you want to be?"
John peaked at Sherlock from the corner of his eye, "I'd like that I think."
"It was good, I'm almost done with the assignment." He decided to press his luck and ask instead of risk getting caught sneaking out, "Do you think I could go back to his place tonight? He said something about catching a movie or something."
"Just shut it, John! You're not going back and that's final. Your neighbors are only 3 meters away from your house, if anything serious happens they will hear it and call the police. John, I am asking you to stay here for the night, and accept the safety I am offering you. I'll walk with you to your house tomorrow and wait outside while you grab your things, what happens past that depends on what is happening tonight, and for this night I am asking you to think about yourself, because—forgive me—I don't logically see how you going home right now will be of any benefit to you."
"Will you help me then? I want to make sure I'm doing this right."
You: hes reading over my shouldeerfthe girt -jw
Stranger: I am 100% sure he’s either drooling on your shoulder or informing you he’s been abducted by aliens. Which is it? SH
Stranger: …first time anyone’s spelt my name /that/ badly. You’re on Edward street, John. Get a cab. SH
"No you're not. You're curious, just like you were curious about the burglar, and all those people you deduced when we were waiting for him. I don't see why though, so what if he likes an occasional glass of bourbon, lots of people do," John defended.
Stranger: Do you even remember what naked means, John? SH
"John? Is everything alright? You're supposed to be in school."
"If you wanted to and you still want to be friends with me," Sherlock said a little unsure.
Stranger: Then walk. It isn’t far. Three blocks. You might have sobered up by the time you get back here. SH
Stranger: Mycroft sent a car. SH
The second time John saw his father hit his sister was a year later, they had both just entered the house from school, he was waiting there for her. He forced a bar of soap into her mouth and made her bite off a chunk of it before he pounded on her. John could only stand there and watch horrified and stay out of the way. He hated himself for not defending Harry, but he was so shocked and blindsided he hadn't even thought about it, which made him feel even worse when he thought about it later that night.
John prepared himself for another storm as he exited the vehicle. The lights inside were still on, which meant either his dad had passed out on the couch, or he was still up. He opened the door as quietly as he could, but to his dismay his dad was still awake. And Harry was home.
"We're not done."
Stranger: Ok, john. Get in the car before I have Lestrade arrest you for public indecency. SH
"You've obviously been raised to be the parental figure for Harriet, but you are not her father and no one is going to blame you for being self preserving."
"I can't tell you."
"Mum, John's staying!" he called out.
"Hey dad, it's John."
"Fuck that, I'm always grounded! Just call him at home, he doesn't have work today anyway."
You: WHAT STREET AM I ON -JW
John woke up to machines and doctors, though only one person held his interest and he was holding his hand. Once Sherlock noticed John was awake the mask slipped off his face and John could see pure relief and sadness; he tried pulling his hand out of John’s but one grip from John stopped him.
"You have to fence that equation," he said suddenly.
“It’s alright, they have his records, they know, Sherlock. He’s in excellent hands,” Greg comforted as he urged Sherlock to sit. “Will someone get me a blanket!” Sherlock was still shaking and breathing heavily, his heart beating overtime.
"Do you think you could help me after school? I'll have to ask my dad but I can probably pay you to tutor me," John asked as they packed up their notebooks.
"No she doesn't!" he defended.
"Thanks, I don't know what time I'll be back, so it might be late," he warned.
"You've known me for one day, how would you know if I was off?" John scoffed.
"Ta," John said getting in the car. "How'd you know?"
You: eww myscroftt is mean and has a stink fsace =jw
The question stumped John, he'd always been so focused on his studies he never really noticed anyone before. "I don't even know what gender I like, or if I like both, or other genders," he confided. "I guess I'd never really thought about it."
"You seem off," Sherlock narrowed his eyes trying to use some of the tips Mycroft had given him when deducing someone.
Sherlock glanced sideways at him, "None particularly." After a few moments of silence he spoke again, "Do you like anyone?"
"You tell him, I'm not coming home tonight," she explained.
