"Yes, sir," Steve breathed, his cheeks flaming hot as Tony sauntered back towards his lab, all perfectly mussed brown hair, back as straight as a ballet dancer, lean, toned limbs, and the most beautifully round ass that Steve had ever seen.
“Uh huh,” Tony replies, sounding so much like Peter that a sharp pang of guilt pierces Steve’s heart.
"Steve—baby—you're taking too damn long!" Tony grunted, each of his gasps and moans only adding to the pleasure pooling in Steve's gut. "Please… honey… I'm begging you!"
"Hey, if we're doing some sort of pizza-eating contest then I wanna be in on it too!" protested Clint. "I know I'm not a goddamn god or anything, but I'm pretty sure I can hold my own when it comes to pizza!"
"And so… you decided to try and burn off your skin?" Tony said warily, backing away when Steve tried to kiss him.
And then at the end of July was their three-week trip to Ireland, where Dad was planning to surprise Papa with a fully-furnished Irish cottage right on the outskirts of the town were Papa's parents grew up, with a quick two-day trip to Dublin thrown in for Peter's sixteenth birthday. Dad had made all the arrangements during the time that Papa was missing, his way of trying to stay optimistic about Papa's safe return, and just the previous night he had shown Peter pictures that the contractor had sent him of the completed house, including the memorial he'd ordered that commemorated Papa's father's sacrifice on the battlefields of World War I, where he was killed fighting for his adopted country. Dad had also made a sizeable donation in Papa's ma's name to one of the nearby hospital's neonatal intensive care units. The NICU at Mount Sinai hospital in New York where Peter spent the first six weeks of his life already sported a large commemorative plaque in Dad's name since he donated money and new equipment there every year, so Dad thought it was best for Papa's ma to be remembered in the Irish hospital since she had worked as a nurse.
"Yep," Quill answered, holding out his left palm. "Held the Power Stone right in this hand. Boy, did that hurt like hell! It also almost ripped me apart until Gamora, Drax, and Rocket grabbed onto me."
"So whatever or whoever it was that caused this either managed to evade our methods of detection, or the threat came from somewhere within the Compound," Steve continued. "And if that's the case, then we need to think about re-vetting the former SHIELD personnel that are assigned here."
And if that was the case, then Peter didn't think he wanted to know what she'd been forced to make Papa see, not to mention the fact that Papa thought he was fighting against Dad when Peter first got there. No wonder Papa had told him that he didn't know what was real anymore.
"Yes, I will," stated Shuri. She glanced up at Peter, then towards another of the floating tables about halfway across the room. "You are also injured."
Steve hesitated. He had just visited with Peter the day before so he knew Peter wasn't expecting to see him again until tomorrow, but…
Regardless, standing there surrounded by nothing but dull grey metal and the occasional flashing light, Peter was absolutely freezing. He'd turned on the heater in his suit—actually, the heaters in both of his suits—but still had to keep his jaw practically locked so his teeth didn't chatter as he and Dad fiddled with the ships controls, trying to figure out how to drop the dumb thing out of warp.
"Good morning, Captain," Doctor List said as he arrived at the window, the young red-haired woman standing next to him. "I trust that you slept well?"
Uncle Thor's face immediately fell, and Peter winced, glancing towards Papa who was sitting on the opposite end of the couch.
And if Thanos was on his way to Wakanda, that meant that Papa and the rest of the team would be forced to face him without Dad and Peter since they were now pretty much stranded on the sorry excuse for a planet, surrounded by a bunch of self-proclaimed—but definitely not plucky—weirdos.
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats, finally giving him a nod. "All right. But I would appreciate it if you'll let me do most of the talking, at least at first."
"God, you're just so fucking gorgeous," he whispered once Steve was completely naked, in absolute awe of the exquisite man hovering over him. "How'd I get so damn lucky?"
Steve smiled, his blue eyes twinkling in the barely-there light as he leaned down to kiss him. "I'll see you soon."
" Peter began. He pulled a chair over for Uncle Bucky to join him and opened the book, pointing to the chapter on asthma treatments. "But it even says so right here. Since they didn't have inhaler technology back then, I guess that was the only way they knew of to get the asthma drugs down into his lungs. But even then, Papa told me the drugs didn't really work all that well and that they made him hallucinate too, which is just freaky anyway."
It was yet another beautiful spring in Langara. Steve donned his sunglasses as he sped towards the hospital, the crisp wind whipping past his cheeks invigorating him almost as much as his morning run.
There was a short pause as Peter pondered Uncle Bucky's question. Now that the Phoenix mission was only a few days away he had honestly been wondering that very same thing. Wondering if it was really worth risking so many people's lives—or livelihoods—on something that wasn't a given. Wondering that even with all of the optimism that Papa tried to project during their nightly meetings, if deep down he feared that something might still go wrong.
"I'm sorry, sir, but Air Corps regulations prohibit me from discussing my personal life while on duty," he stated. "And since I have been cleared by the base's medical office and am now officially back on duty, I am therefore unable to provide an answer to that question without being in violation of Air Corps protocols. Sir."
"The Planck Scale? Yep," answered Tony. He turned to Scott. "Which means that when Pete and I were messing around with these things, we chose to chalk that part up to Pym being nothing but a delusional old man and then ignored it."
"Oh," Bucky said as he looked away, so softly that Tony had to strain to hear him. "Хауард liked cars too."
Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "You heard—? Wait, nevermind. No, I'm—I'm fine. The Meridians were just an extra bit—"
"Ah, yep," said Tony. "When I got assigned to the X-300 program I asked Colonel Phillips if I could move over here. I'm usually up working past the blackout time, so it just made more sense." Tony didn't add that his main reason for the request had been because he just couldn't stand working alone in a tiny, windowless room with only a small handlamp for light. Only certain sections of the base had electricity during the blackout periods, and Tony's office was now in one of them.
"Yeah, that's more like it," grumbled Tony. As much as he appreciated Bruce and the work that he did, there were occasions where he tended to get ahead of himself, and at the moment Tony had absolutely no patience for it.
"Hey, Steve," Natasha said as she came into the lab, her eyes flicking briefly to his unkempt whiskers.
"Are you kidding? I'm looking forward to it!" said Uncle Sam. "It might be the only time I can honestly say that I beat Captain America."
"Oh. Well, that kinda sucks," said Ned. He blinked as the blonde girl entered the classroom, sitting down in the center seat in the front row as the rest of the class filtered in.
"Let me," he murmured. He tapped Steve's shoulder, indicating for him to roll onto his back. "Get your pants and boxers off for me, yeah?"
Peter thought as he whipped around to search for the potential perpetrator, and saw nothing except sand.
"Y-yeah," Peter stuttered. To be perfectly honest, he was far too distracted by Gwen's close proximity and the gorgeous smell of her hair to pay much attention to the stars. Especially since despite the hot chocolate and wearing one of his regular heated Spider-Man suits underneath his clothes, he was starting to get really cold being outside after dark in the middle of March.
Which meant that Tony had better make it a message worth listening to, if by some miracle Steve ever found it.
As capable as Tony was of designing complex flight simulations in his head, the more complex the simulations the more difficult it had become for him to translate those ideas onto paper. Peter was the artist in their family, not him, and Tony wasn't about to add to Peter's stress level by having to ask him to draw stuff out for him anymore.
None of his provisional battle plans had ever included the possibility of Tony—or Peter—going off into space. Not a single one.
"Jesus Christ, Pete! What the hell are you doing up there?" Tony exclaimed, sucking in a deep breath as his heart slowly meandered its way out of his throat. It wasn't the first time that he and Steve had found Peter sitting up by the ceiling, and knowing Peter it wouldn't be the last either.
"Steve," Tony said, or more like whined when Steve's warm hands slid even further down to his waist, spending what seemed like hours teasing the skin just above his ass. Tony made an impatient noise in his throat, glancing back at Steve just in time to see the grin stretch across his full lips, his face flushed and his blue eyes nearly blown black.
“Oh, I highly doubt that,” Tony said firmly.  “Especially if it’s going to ‘change modern warfare as we know it’, like you always say.”
“Okay, so… how ‘bout you think of it like this,” Peter cut in.  “You know how I like to sleep with my bedroom door cracked open, right?”
Uncle James wasn't as good of a cook as Papa or Uncle Sam, but he was decent enough, and a half hour later, filled up on eggs and toast and bacon, Peter loaded up a tray with a full plate and a fresh cup of coffee and headed for Dad's lab.
With a frustrated sigh, Dr Strange stepped to the side to reveal another man standing behind him, one who caused Steve's belly to drop to his knees.
"So, can you tell me what happened to Uncle Thor?" Peter asked once they were settled in the kitchen, kneading homemade pizza dough. "I've never seen him this twitchy before."
"I wouldn't hear of anything else, Mr Wilson," Stacy said proudly. "And I would appreciate the agents' help if they don't mind."
And, since in that moment he didn't even think he could have moved if he’d wanted to, that stance made even more sense.
"I'm not testy," Steve snapped, huffing when Bucky raised an eyebrow. "I just don't think we should be so quick to judge someone when we don't know what's—"
said we needed to investigate every possible HYDRA hiding spot.  So we came out here, and now we’re stuck in this goddamn place and I don't know if we can ever get out again!”  He lets out a choked-off gasp, turning on Steve.  “And if you say ‘language’ to me one more time, I’m gonna—!”
"I'm not opposed, Captain," Stacy said. "As a matter of fact, I was very impressed by that boy of yours when he came over that evening, and I felt bad that it had to end on such a lousy note." He heaved a heavy sigh, shaking his head. "I guess I'm just not quite ready for my little girl to grow up. She had never shown any interest in boys at all until we moved over here, and—"
"Yeah, well, instead of arguing about it, why don't we just work on getting you back here, yeah?" said Tony. "'Cause that'll just be the easiest way to solve all these problems."
"Captain Rogers has arrived in the penthouse, sir," JARVIS said, a second before Tony picked up Steve's steady footsteps heading towards the lab, followed by Sam and Bucky. Tony's heart gave a flutter as his tall, blond-haired, drop-dead gorgeous husband came into view, dressed in a pair of jeans that showed off his magnificent ass to perfection, and his New York Mets sweatshirt and baseball cap that almost exactly matched the blue in his eyes.
Once all the food was gone and the dishes piled into the dishwashers, the team headed into the airy common living room to watch football and play chess, which eventually morphed into a massive game of Twister that soon had Steve clutching his sides at its hilarity. Peter was so flexible that he could pretty much bend in any direction, not to mention his ability to stick to any surface, while Clint had everyone else laughing so hard that he made it impossible for them to hold their positions. Eventually he, Natasha, and Bucky all collapsed into a giant heap of limbs, allowing Peter to emerge victorious once again.
Minus Peter's months-long coma, of course, there at least was that. But Peter was having a hard time shaking the thought that the lake incident was his fault. He'd been the one begging Papa and Dad for that last round of waterskiing, trying to master dropping a ski, and then…
"That's good," said Peter, just before downing the extra milk from his bowl. Then he wiped his chin with the sleeve of his oversized sweatshirt, wincing when he noticed Steve's raised eyebrow. "Sorry, Papa. Um… I'll get a napkin."
"Yeah, Sam, I know that." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. "I honestly don't know what the hell I would do without this team," he said softly. "If it was just me, I'd've already tried to—but I don't—I just don't know if—"
Which for all intents and purposes were already complete, since Peter apparently never made any mistakes.
As to why the Langaran officials never made it a priority to look for this person remained a mystery, as did the tech that he allegedly stole.
He had just turned back to face the others when a sharp breeze suddenly blew through the hole in the ceiling, accompanied by flying papers and leaves and a loud, groaning noise that reminded Steve way too much of the
In fact, now that Tony thought about it, Peter had been especially moody ever since he and Steve had gotten home from D.C. He had tried to brush most of it off as Peter just being upset about the whole registration act thing, but not even that was enough to explain all of it.
"Shh, buddy, it's okay now," Tony soothed, brushing his son's tears away with his thumbs as Steve's arms tightened around them both. "No one's gonna get you, we promise."
"Dad," Peter said as soon as the door closed behind Uncle James. "Dad, we've gotta—I mean, if it's not safe anymore, then we've gotta—"
"It's probably them, Pete," he finally said, ignoring the stab of fear piercing his side. "Actually, not even probably."
"I'm better now, hot stuff," Tony said, rising onto his tiptoes for a kiss. Then he stepped back, narrowing his eyes. "But why'd you ask me that?"
But since Steve didn't do any of those things, then he’s not truly brave.  He’s just a pretender.  An actor in a tight spangly suit prancing around a stage who for the last three years couldn’t even afford to continue paying his coach.
Even though he now desired the one man he thought he’d hated more than anyone in the entire world so badly that his entire body sizzled with it, still the shame didn't come.
The irony that it was now him who couldn't seem to tear himself away from the repeating loop of news footage wasn't lost on Tony as he paced back and forth in his lab, impatiently waiting for Steve and the others to get home so Fury could debrief them. He'd already sent a disgruntled Peter to his room, not wanting him to be exposed to the live-feed coverage of rescuers pulling burned and bleeding bodies out of the wreckage of what used to be some kind of scientific research centre. The kid didn't need to be watching that kind of stuff, not when he'd already lived through something far too similar for Tony's taste. Twice.
But, just like he hadn't been fast enough the one other time this had happened, he wasn't this time either.  His heart skipped at least three beats as he watched the books land in succession, the sound of their impacts way too unbearably close to the sound that haunted his nightmares.
"How out of commission?" Steve asked. He curled his hands into fists, trying to stop them from shaking. Despite James's apparent prior knowledge of Carol, having some unknown woman/being gain entrance into their secured home was not something he was prepared to let go of so easily.
"Yep, that's the one," Steve said with a nod. "It's always something that I wished my papa and I could've done. After that, I've already promised Peter that he can teach me how to climb a tree. There're so many beautiful oak trees in the woods behind that lake cabin that would be perfect for climbing, so…"
"Captain, we must hurry. Please, follow me," Shuri said as she led Steve and Peter through the crowded plain, which had fallen completely silent in the aftermath of Tony's snap, save for an eerie sort of whistling noise left behind as each member of Thanos' army faded into ashes.
"Stop," Bucky said as his spine went rigid, his head shaking frantically from side to side but his eyes still wide behind the glasses. "No, I don't wanna, please don't—!"
With a triumphant huff, Thanos released Peter, who immediately collapsed into a heap on the ground, his legs as weak as a newborn baby's as he sucked the stale air into his starved lungs. Not even a second later Dad was at his side, pulling Peter into his lap and hugging him close.
“Hey, Dad?” Peter asked as the elevator slid to a halt, startling Tony from his standing semi-doze.  He rubbed at his eyes, ignoring Peter’s pointed look as they stepped into the garage.  He didn't want to think about how many times Peter had tried and failed to get his attention.
. Then SHIELD would've never gotten their hands on it, and tried to mess with it, which is what drew the Chitauri to Earth in the first place, and—
"And who told you that?" demanded Steve. "Tony wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary today, so—"
With a single nod, Steve pressed a kiss to Peter's temple. "Peter, Dad and I are just gonna go and stand in the back of the room so Uncle Bucky can sit with you, okay? He's—it'll be better for you with him here. All right?"
"They really need to get you some more help with that stuff," Papa said as they piled into the penthouse elevator. "It's getting to be too much."
But she was cut off by another ear-splitting howl from Thanos, nearly causing Peter to scream right along with him. His senses were already stretched so thin they were nearly at the breaking point, even with his adaptive suit, and he wasn't sure how much longer he'd be able to keep going.
"No!" Papa shrieked from somewhere behind him, sounding very far away. "No, please, don't hurt him! He's only a boy!"
Peter raised his eyebrows as he took a sip of his milk, suppressing a shudder at the memory of seeing Dad and Papa's crumbling gravestones and watching Gwen fall to her death, the illusions Wanda had forced him to see while under HYDRA's influence. He had told Uncle Sam about them during one of their recent sessions but had so far kept them from his dads, not wanting their overprotectiveness to get any worse.
that it made sending a violent shiver down Tony's spine. Steve jumped and gritted his teeth but was otherwise silent, likely because he didn't want Peter to see that he was in pain.
"Holy cow," Peter laughed as he inspected the cartons. "This is absolutely hilarious! You know we have to get these now, right?"
Bucky shrugged, bobbing his head back and forth. "Yeah. Like I said, I've never seen you so goddamn googly-eyed over anyone before, so… maybe the guy's better than his reputation says."
"Sounds like a plan," croaked Tony, his gasp swallowed by Steve's mouth as Steve somehow managed to shut off the shower spray with his elbow and guided Tony out, quickly toweling them both off before hoisting Tony into his arms and carrying him towards their bed. Tony shivered as the cool, dry air of their bedroom hit his overheated skin, but kept his eyes firmly on Steve as he laid him down and crawled up over him, cupping his cheek, his lust-blown eyes still radiating that ever-present edge of fear.
When it came down to creating the guest list, both Tony and Steve agreed that they wanted a small wedding. Just the other Avengers, their friends, and Rhodey’s family who were also as good as Tony’s wedding. No press. No outsiders. Just Tony, Steve, and the people that mattered to them.
Steve had been pretty self-destructive before he got with Tony. He didn’t think about himself in or out of battle. But Tony made him better. They both made each other better. They gave each other the strength to get help when they needed it. They encouraged each other to think things through. They supported each other through and through.
Tony lived of course. He lived and invited the Avengers to stay at the tower. That had been the breaking point in his and Pepper’s relationship.
Tony looked up at Steve with surprise in his eyes. All Steve could do was lean in and kiss the surprise right off his face.
They worked well together to fix the turbine. There was no doubt that they would. Soulmates were made to be the perfect match to each other. Of course, they were able to work well together. But that didn’t stop Coulson from dying. That didn’t stop Tony from grieving and figuring out Loki’s plan. That didn’t stop Tony from flying off to the tower to try and get a jump on him. That didn’t stop the portal from opening and all hell breaking loose.
As Steve got closer, Tony opened his eye and looked up at Steve. He coughed and a small trickle of blood rolled off of his lips.
But now he was on the road to healing. And Steve was right there. Right at his side offering the support Tony needed and craved.
To say that Tony was distressed at the news was an understatement. Losing an eye was a big deal. This was not only major surgery but also a major life change. So not only was Tony not feeling well, but he was also panicking at the thought of surgery. Tony had had surgery a few times now. He hated it. The uncertainty made him feel faint.
So yes, Tony was happy. So fucking happy. Despite everything. Despite the pain. Despite losing an eye and his voice, he was happy. For the first time in a long time, Tony knew that he was worthy of love. That he was worthy of happiness. It was all because of the little life he’d forged.
Well, at least Tony knew that he was still getting married to Steve. Actually, that had been one of the things helping Tony keep it together. He loved Steve so damn much. Tony wanted to cling to the happiness he’d found with Steve. But this…? This was a major set back and Tony didn’t know how to feel about anything anymore. He just hurt all the time and he was scared. So damn scared.
Steve, still in his beaten and bloody uniform collapsed against the while walls of medical and slid down to the floor as he began sobbing. It took a great deal to get Steve crying. Now was one of those times. Steve’s head fell between his knees as his arms flopped over his knees. He just sat there sobbing in his soiled uniform, Tony’s blood still on his hands. He ignored the fact that the dirt on his unfirm stained the wall behind him. There were more important things on his mind.
“Hey... Hey... Shhh, Tony. Shhh. Love. Don’t talk. Don’t talk alright. Help is on the way. You’re gonna be alright.” Cried, Steve. His composure was slipping and Steve was absolutely terrified. The love of his life was bleeding out on the concrete and he was powerless to do anything except offer comfort.
Three days after Tony woke up, he was struck down with a horrible infection. His injured eye had begun to swell and cause Tony extreme pain and discomfort as the infection spread around his face. It broke Steve’s heart to see Tony laying there in pain. He couldn’t do anything to help but hold Tony’s hand and whisper encouragement.
Steve was a nervous wreck as the doctors and nurses took Tony off of the sedation. He just needed to know that Tony was alright and he was getting incredibly impatient. Surprisingly in their relationship, Tony was more patient than Steve was. Not by much though.
Steve lead Tony over to the plush cream couch by the window. There were small splatters of paint and pastels covering the cushions and there were some blank canvases sitting in the corner. The space looked lived in and Tony was happy about that. It was such a stark contrast to his own room. Tony hardly spent time in his, with the exception of his heat. Plus, Tony put a lot of work into designing the Avenger’s rooms. He was glad they liked them.
Seven months. It had been seven months since Tony’s accident. Seven months and they were finally getting married.
“Just remember Tony, you’re not alone. I’ll be up there translating for you. The team will be waiting in the wings and I’m 99% sure that Pepper is going to glare somebody to death if they step out of line.”
It took Tony three whole days after that conversation before Tony even considered trying to hold Harley. He was so scared after everything that had happened. Tony cried the first time he held his son. He was shaking so badly that Steve had to help support the baby. That became a bit of a trend. For weeks Tony refused to hold Harley without Steve’s help. Steve had just told everyone that Tony wasn’t doing so great after the birth. He wasn’t going to betray Tony’s trust by telling everyone what had happened.
“Well, you sure know how to treat a man.” Smiled Tony as Steve took him by the arm and the two walked in and took their seats.
“Fuck, I love you so much.” Gasped Steve as his hands slid up to take Tony’s shirt off. Tony pressed the sign for I love you over Steve’s heart before the two methodically ripped their clothes off.
“Tony. His name was Tony.” Sam’s eyebrows shot up as he took a seat next to Steve. He couldn’t be talking about Stark? Right? Bucky and Bruce walked over to join them and to listen to Steve’s tales.
The flight was a few hours long but once they landed, the two newlyweds practically sprinted from the jet and up to the house. It was dark out when they arrived but then knew the way up to the house. When they arrived, Tony quickly unlocked the front door and turned on some lights. Some of the others had been there a week prior to make sure everything was ready. Tony and Steve were very grateful for that. It allowed them to get right down to business without having to worry about anything.
And so, with one last deep breath, Tony raised his hands so he could sign while Steve got ready to relay his speech.
“I need a med evac to my location right now! Tony’s down! I need medical!” shouted Steve as he checked to make sure Tony was still alive.
Soon enough they were both naked and wanting. Steve pushed Tony down onto the bed and covered his husband with his body. They kissed each other senseless while they ground their bodies together. It was as if they were trying to become one body. One love. One life.
Tony had been down in the lab for the first time in months when Steve dropped that question on him. He’d been playing with his bots when Steve came storming in with a shit-eating grin on his face and his puppy-dog eyes going full force.
The team heard the explosion through their com units before Tony’s connection dropped. Instantly Steve began to panic. He began shouting over the coms for any information pertaining to Tony. He was worried. Tony was likely hurt and he wasn’t there with him. Luckily, Rhodey was nearby and he gave Steve a lift to the lactation JARVIS said Tony was at.
“Mr. Stark, you were injured quite badly. Because of the blast, you have a small fracture to your right knee cap that will heal with time. As well, your right eye was badly damaged. We won’t know if you retained any vision until the bone there has healed and we can remove the bandages.
“You’re looking a lot better this morning.” Smiled Steve in an attempt to defuse the tension in the room.
Tony had always had a crush on Steve Rogers. Even when he hated the man for making his own father hate his son, he still had a crush on Steve Rogers. He was the Alpha of Alphas. He was smart, kind, actually helped Omegas. Not to mention that he was absolutely gorgeous.
“Oh, Tony.” Sighed Steve as he saw the tears begin to form. He took Tony into his arms and rested his head against Tony’s.
It was six days before the doctors took Tony off of the sedation. Six days filled with worry. Six days were Steve didn’t leave Tony’s side. He had his friends bring him things he’d need when he needed them when they came to check in on Tony. But Steve? He didn’t leave his Tony. He pretty much lived in medical. The only time he left was to go shower.
“Well, I’ve sort of been wanting some tattoos for a while and if anyone can make an ink that will work in my it’s you.” Smiled Steve and Tony blushed a bit.
“Well, I can’t stay here. I’ve got work to do. No doubt the suit is blown to shreds and all of your guys’ gear needs work. Plus I’ve got that huge project I have to get done for Pepper. Fuck, she’s going to kill me once she gets here. No doubt she’ll yell.” Rambled Tony and Steve just sat there in worry. He already knew that Tony was overworked, but his planning to push aside his own health because of all the work he had to do was going too far.
“You ready for me baby?” husked Steve as he hovered over Tony. All Tony did was spread his legs wide and send a sultry look Steve’s way.
From there the two got to know each other beyond the personality profiles that SHIELD gave them back during Loki’s invasion. They joked and learned about each other. Tony learned about Steve’s childhood and his hopes and dreams while Steve learned about all the bullshit Tony went through as a child. By the end of that talk, both of them loathed Howard Stark.
“Steve, SHIELD is here with the air evac. Keep him awake.” Shouted Natasha and Steve nodded as he fussed over his fiancé.
“Make sure that you wash your hands and put on a mask before you go into his room. Mr. Stark is in a delicate condition and we don’t want to introduce any kind of infection.”
“They’re calling you a hero because you are one you dumb ass.” Chided Rhodey with a smile when that particular news report came up. “They were too stupid to see it before.”
“You… you lost a lot of blood. Your heart and your body couldn’t handle giving birth. Your… your heart stopped twice Tony. Twice! I thought I was going to lose you!”  cried Steve and Tony frowned. Why was Steve so worried about him? Harley was fine so why was he worried about Tony?
As the pain meds did their job Tony began to feel a little bit better and was in a better frame of mind to listen to the doctor.
So pretty much everyone was excited about the baby. The team was supportive and talked a lot about the baby to Steve. Tony mostly just existed and smiled when he wasn’t throwing up or feeling achy. Sometimes he wished that the others would talk to him. But, as Tony’s hormones spiked and got all wonky, so did his own insecurities.
When the doctor came out and told them that Tony was alive and would heal, Steve just about lost his cool and started crying. Luckily, he held it together to hear the information the doctor was giving them. Tony’s femur had a clean break but needed to be pined and held together for the next two months. He’d be in medical for another week at least to allow things to settle. After that Tony would be confined to a wheelchair for a while to keep the pressure off of the bone.
“Come on Tony, surely there’s a name that you like.” fretted Steve one afternoon. The two were sitting in Tony’s lab. Tony was on the couch working on some designs while Steve read through a baby naming book.
"Why did you do that Tony? Why? You should've been more careful.” Asked Steve. It wasn’t meant to be a reprimand but in Steve’s tired and stressed-out state his words sounded harsher than he meant.
Steve was quick to slick himself up and slide into his lover. Tony moaned loudly and Steve was no better. They’d both been so pent up lately. They needed this. They really needed this.
The building was still standing when they arrived and Steve took a mad dash to the basement to find Tony while Rhodey scanned the area for threats before tailing quickly behind him.
“What’s on your mind?” asked Steve as he saw Tony’s hands fidgeting. Tony also wasn’t looking at him and that was a huge red flag that something was wrong. The nervous energy that permeated the room was also a big giveaway.
“J, put me on a private line to Steve.” Spoke Tony, his voice oddly level for what he was about to do.
So, with the easy stuff handled and out of the way, Tony and Steve had more time to focus on some of the harder things.
After nearly six hours one of the doctors came into the hall to let everyone know what was going on.
There were days were Tony woke up in pain. Days where Tony became so frustrated with himself that he’d start crying silent tears. Days where his own silence was too much to bear. Those were the days when Tony wanted nothing more than to just scream at the world. To scream and let it all out. To scream about the injustice of it all.
"Not yet," Tony said carefully. "Bruce is working on it, but it's gonna take awhile. JARVIS says the encryption on this stuff is at or above Project Insight levels, so we can't rush it if we want to be able to transfer everything that's there."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Tony, hold on! Tell me what's wrong!" Steve said as propped himself up on his elbow, his other arm tightening around Tony's waist. His disheveled blond hair was sticking up in all directions, and he had such an adorable
"The suit performed beautifully, sweetheart," he said as he pressed their foreheads together. "Better than I could've hoped. I'm just—not quite used to it yet."
“Yeah, buddy, I know I did.  And I’m sorry, I really am.  But you know how cranky Obie gets sometimes.  And if I don't get this missile schematic done before I leave then I’ll be having to deal with him for the entire goddamn weekend, and I know how much you hate it when he bugs us at home.”
looks. "Not 'just' just, honey. I only meant that you're his parent, so that automatically makes you old. It's no different for me. And there's no way in hell that you look a day over thirty, so don't you go on boasting that you're ninety-four and think you can get away with it."
“I know you haven’t.  ‘Cause Obie’s kept it hidden from you.”  Peter shifted, pointing to the document.  “Look here.  You see where it mentions the Iron Monger?  Dad, that’s got to be Obie!  It’s just got to!  Who else do you know who talks like that?  There's no one!”
"Thank you. Now, I'm not saying that what you did wasn't dumb, 'cause it was. You lied to me, Steve, and you lied to me about my son, which makes it about a million times worse. But from what Pete told me he thinks you're a pretty cool guy, and—"
Tony smiled softly as he glanced over at his husband, his breath hitching as he took him in. Steve's thick blond hair was tucked under a bright blue New York Mets baseball hat, and he was wearing the wire-rimmed, aviator sunglasses that Tony adored. That combined with the way his left hand was resting right at twelve o'clock on the steering wheel and the way the dimple in his right cheek was staring so boldly in Tony's direction that it may as well have been a flashing neon sign… it was taking entirely too much of Tony's willpower to keep his hands to himself so Steve could drive.
"Pretty sure," Gwen said as she leaned back, allowing Peter to take her place. "Up there, slightly to the right of the North Star. Do you see it?"
Now, as for the brace around your neck. You suffered some extreme damage to both your vocal cords and your artery. Fortunately, we were able to get your artery stable. Unfortunately, we were unable to save your vocal cords and they had to be removed. It is unlikely that you’ll ever talk again. I’m sorry Mr. Stark.”
“No Tony, I’m not. I thought you knew that. We’ve… we’ve been going out on dates for months. I’ve kissed you awake every morning. You’re everything to me Sweet thing.”
Hey there everyone! I hope y’all are ready for a new chapter! It’s time for Tony to face the public for the first time in months. So, who’s ready? Read on to find out what happens and enjoy. -Shadows
Three days after that Steve had come home with a goofy grin on his face sporting his first tattoo. There, right over Steve’s heart, written in a bold script reminiscent of Tony’s blocky handwriting, sat the last words Tony had ever spoken to Steve.
He started by asking JARVIS to scan him and finished with a pregnancy test. Tony had absolutely no idea what to do as he looked down at the little pink plus sign. There were tears in his eyes as he thought about the implications of what had just happened. Apparently, super soldier sperm was stronger than condoms.
He and Bucky talked it out for a bit but Steve didn’t change his mind. He loved Bucky and Sam and everybody there, but he just couldn’t deal with it all anymore. He needed a chance to make things better. Maybe if he went back far enough he could fix some things. He just needed a good place to start.
“Hey, Tony. is everything alright?” asked Steve as he opened the door and got a good look at Tony’s exhausted face.
“Fuck I sure hope so.” Sighed Tony as he laid back a little further on the bed. “You know what. I’m pretty hungry. We should get out of here and get some snacks. I like snacks.” Smiled Tony and Steve knew it was likely the pain meds talking because Tony’s eyes were getting a bit hazy.
They just laid there together, arm in arm, while they came down from their highs. Tony had his head pillowed on Steve’s chest and one of Steve’s hand were buried in Tony’s hair while the other rested on his ass. It was a moment of pure contentment. A moment of no worries. A moment of freedom. After all that had happened to them, they could finally take a break.
But the thing was, after Tony’s heat broke and he’d passed out from exhaustion, Steve didn’t leave. When Tony woke up the Alpha was there with water and snacks. Naturally, Tony thanked him and the two parted ways a few hours after that.
Natasha sat off to the side and got out her phone to pass the time. She knew that Tony would be in surgery for a long time if he were to survive this. Although they may have had a very rocky start, Tony and Natasha had grown close over the years. She really hoped that one of her best friends wasn’t dead on the operating table. Natasha also posted the situation to the Avengers' Twitter account. They had some PR rules that had to follow since they became a full-on organization and keeping the public informed on importing happenings was one of them. This was what the post read.
This week, Steve had planned the whole affair. Tony had been out at board meetings all day and was just exhausted. That was one thing Tony liked about Steve. He took charge. In most of Tony’s past relationships, he was the one to plan everything and put things in motion. It was nice to just sit back and be pampered for once.
“I’m here because I’m your teammate and I care about you.” Spoke Steve very steadily. Tony just glared back at him.
Half a second later the bomb exploded and Tony was thrown back as his body erupted in pain. All Tony saw was red as he hit the ground.
Steve pulled Tony into his arms and smiled when Tony smiled up at him. He loved holding Tony and Tony loved being held. They fit perfectly together. They really were made for each other.
“Oh, well… that reminds me.” Smiled Steve as he reached for the circular leather bag that was sitting next to him. Sam watched in intrigue as Steve unzipped the bag to unveil a new, sparkling shield.
Once the infection was detected, the doctors started Tony on a course of antibiotics and twice-daily cleanings of the area. It was horrible to see Tony hooked up to even more IV lines. It was even worse when Tony had to have his eye cleaned. Tony would grip his hand in an iron vice as tears rolled down his cheeks from the pain. Steve wished that he could take Tony’s pain away. His love had been through so much already. Had endured too much. Tony deserved so much better.
“Oh, Tony.” Sighed Pepper as she brought her friend into a hug. She was soon followed by Happy and Rhodey and the four friends eventually ended up in a puppy pile on the floor.
Sam paused and looked at Steve for a moment. He saw his friend's eyes shining with happiness and that was enough for Sam. He always liked seeing his friends happy.
What Tony didn’t understand was why Steve Rogers kept hanging around him. It had been months since the Avengers had settled into life at the tower and they’d gone on a few missions together but that didn’t explain why Rogers would come down to his lab armed with snacks and ask him all sorts of questions about his tech.
In October of 2015, the Avengers got a call out to deal with a villain going by the name of Dr. Doom. Doom was a weird fellow. He was the leader of the very small country of Latveria and he had an affinity for technology. But, instead of using it for good and helping his people, he decided to make killer robots and terrorize everyone else. Normally, a group called The Fantastic Four dealt with him and his antics, but they were busy doing something else that day so the Avengers took the call. Actually, the Avengers had worked with the Fantastic Four on a few occasions. Their guy, Johnny Storm sure looked a lot like Steve but like, less beefy. Bucky and Tony liked to tease Steve about that.
Turning on his heel, Tony hurried back to his office, relieved when he found that whoever Rhodey had ordered to clean it had thankfully left his desk untouched, as everything was still in its same semi-organised chaotic place.
"Yes sir, but I'm afraid Mr Hammer has just recalled several of the suits back inside the structure," said JARVIS. "It appears that he underestimated the ease with which you were able to take them out."
"If you're sure," Steve said, his lips barely brushing the shell of Tony's ear. He slid his hand under Tony's ass, pressing him up against him and moaning at Tony's answering groan. "But I'm gonna take my time with you. Give you a bit of your own medicine, hmm?"
"Well, yeah, it is, but… no one's ever called me by the whole thing except my grandma, and she died when I was ten." He sucked in a deep breath as he looked over at Steve. "Your ma took care of her when she got sick, remember?"
"Oh, sure. Sorry," Steve said as he shoved the rest of his roll into his mouth, washing it down with the last of his superwater. Being caught out of quarters when the blackout hit was not something he needed to experience more than once.
"Peter—" Gwen started, but Peter cut her off with another kiss, hugging her lithe body as close to him as he dared. He wanted so badly to do more than just kissing, but he didn't dare push anything. Her dad was a cop, after all. And he was a gentleman, like Papa said.
Steve didn't ask if Tony had known the specifics of that trip once he returned, but he had a strong suspicion that he did. For how much Tony—and Steve as well—liked to speak of Peter's uncanny perceptiveness, Steve was convinced that it was just one of the many, many traits that he shared with his father, even if Tony never liked to admit it.
Steve smiled even wider, revealing his dimple. "Yes, I'm sure you're right. That probably means that I should polish my shield on the way there, hmm?"
"Mmm, long as it's in the morning," Tony mumbled, already half asleep. He felt Steve's fingers weave into his hair, his fingertips pressing against his scalp in just the way that he loved. "Oh gods, babe, that feels amazing."
Steve dipped his head, kissing Tony firmly on the mouth before taking his hand and leading him into their bathroom, very much aware that Tony was trying to distract him, but also very grateful for it.
"Okay, right there, JARVIS," said Peter. "Can you please triangulate the position where that camera is paused?"
"Wait, it was already on the news?" Peter hadn't turned on the TV at all since Dad had gotten home the night before, but if the news was already reporting it then it was likely that the entire world had already heard about it, which meant there was probably an entire army of reporters camped down at the base of the Tower, waiting for a statement.
"Howard Stark, you are hereby under arrest for conspiring with the enemy to bomb the Langaran mountain power plant," he said. "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be—"
“Very good, sir,” answered JARVIS.  “And, I have just received word that the replacement medical supplies have been successfully delivered to the Foundation in Sokovia, all locks intact.”
Tony let out a chuckle as the banter continued, a slight flush creeping up his neck as Rogers continued praising the aircraft like he was getting paid to do so.
And in true Midtown fashion, their team didn't miss a single one of their questions, earning them the National Championship and several ear-splitting whistles from Sam Wilson.
“Don't wander too far away, okay?” he calls after Tony, because apparently he just can’t keep his mouth shut.  “There's no way of knowing what else is in here!”
“Uh—uh huh,” Peter said.  He sniffed, his red-rimmed brown eyes glassy and exhausted as he leaned his head against Tony’s chest.  X-rays had shown that Peter’s pinky finger had suffered a break, but thankfully it was a clean break, requiring only a splint to keep it immobile for the next four weeks or so while it healed.
“Be careful Tony. We don’t know if Doom has hidden anything around the area. We just took out the last bot. We’ll be at your location in five minutes after we scout the area.” Replied Steve, his voice sounded worried but this was all part of the job.
“I think that’s a great idea. The two of us coming together. We could add accents of purple to play into that.”
As the doctors and nurses took Tony off of the sedation they warned Steve that it may take a little while for Tony to come around and that once he did he would be very disoriented with everything that had happened. Steve promised to call them one Tony woke up for more than a minute. They all left the room Steve was right back at Tony’s side. Right where he belonged.
“Hey, Sweetheart. Glad to see you awake. We’ve been worried about you.” soothed Steve as a tear rolled down his cheeks. That left Tony a bit confused. Had something bad happened?
“But… But he’s you kid too,” said Steve, his voice sounding small and slightly distant. Tony wasn’t going to dig into that. Nope. not at all.
In return, Tony told Steve about what happened in the bunker in Sokovia and what he’d seen. Steve managed to talk Tony down from his panic and his idea to relaunch the Ultron Project. They also worked together to take down the Maximoff twins. Apparently, they had a misplaced vendetta against Tony and neither could really be reasoned with. The new SHIELD were in charge of keeping them contained.
Tony was laying on the ground covered in very obvious cuts and scrapes from the bomb. But that was what was concerning. What was concerning was the very obvious break to Tony’s left femur.
“Maybe I’ll just have to wrap you up in bubble wrap.” Smirked Steve before his eyes went dark. “Or maybe I could just keep you in bed forever. Keep you here and happy and full of me.”
Tony just smiled back and curled in close. He deserved the comfort after that press conference. He hated press conferences.
During the times Tony was more lucid, there were tears in his eyes. Tony never cried. Steve knew that that was because of how Howard has raised him. So seeing tears so regularly let Steve know exactly how horrible Tony was feeling.
The second Tony and Steve set their suitcases down in their room, their hands were all over each other. They were kissing like mad as Steve lead Tony over to the bed. He sat down on the edge and pulled Tony into his lap. Tony couldn’t help but grind down on his husband.
“I… I never thought… I didn’t think… I thought I was all alone…” stuttered Tony his voice barely rising more than a whisper.
They were happy. Very, very happy. Tony couldn’t ever remember being this happy. Neither could Steve. They were together. They had good friends and family. They were happy.
In all honesty, Tony could confidently say that he was happy. He’d never expected to be happy. After an abysmal childhood, a rocky adulthood, and a tumultuous time as a hero, Tony had honestly expected to die sooner rather than later. But now? Now Tony had Steve. He had friends. He had a family! He was a hero. People loved him!
“I… I can’t! No! Can’t hold him! Please don’t make me. Please stop lying. Not my son! Not mine. Can’t get attached.” cried Tony as his panic increased and his breathing became unsteady.
For once in their lives, everything seemed to be perfect. There hadn’t been a callout in a few months, SI’s stocks were doing amazing, They were happy. Neither Tony nor Steve could ever remember being this happy.
Tony drifted off to the sound of yelling and feet running closer. He felt warm. So, so warm. Tony liked the warmth.
After calming down some, Tony felt exhausted. Steve made sure he was comfortable in his arms before Tony slipped off to sleep. He needed the rest. There had been a lot of big emotions and no doubt he’d be having a meeting with his therapist the next day. She really was a good therapist.
“I had a feeling that something was wrong when you said you didn’t want Harley to have your last name. I was hoping that you’d say something and I didn’t want to push you. It really didn’t seem right that Harley didn’t have your name so when I was given the birth certificate I put Stark-Rogers. He’s yours too Tony. I just wish I’d been better for you.”
As Tony entered his sixth month of pregnancy, his ever-growing discomfort and insecurity over the entire situation were not helped by Steve continuously waiting to figure out a name for his baby.
If anyone had asked Tony when he was a teenager how he thought his life would turn out, He would have said something along the lines of “I’ll probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.”
“Is this OUR broken femur? No! It’s mine and I’ll be a fucking baby about it if I want.” Panted out Tony as Bruce went about splinting his leg. Tony was in so much pain that he didn’t even register that he had Steve’s hand in a vice grip.
The next day when Tony and Steve told all of their friends there was a flurry of excitement. Everyone was smiling and money was exchanged as bets were won. Natasha and Rhodey took home a lot of money that day. But, even with some bets lost, every last Avengers was extremely happy for the couple. The same went for Pepper, Happy, and Rhodey’s family. They all had a bit of a celebration at the news.
Three days later found the two lovers lying together in Tony’s medial bed once again. Tony was fiddling with some new blueprints while he relaxed after a gruelling physio session while Steve was scrolling through social media with furrowed eyebrows.
They were interrupted when one of the nurses came into the room. She checked Tony over to make sure he was alright before she gave him some more medication. She didn’t ask questions about the tears in both Tony and Steve’s eyes. Once she left, Steve checked on Harley and then crawled into bed with Tony and held him close. Tony melted into the touch. He never said it, but Tony loved to be held. Hell, he loved to be touched. He hadn’t received nearly enough positive touch.
It was silent for a few moments as Steve held Tony in his arms. The silence stretched on for eons as the two sat there. The only sounds were the beeping of various machines and baby Harley snoring away in his cot. The entire time Tony just laid there in Steve’s arms and allowed himself a moment of comfort.
FREEEEEDOOOOM! It’s finally time for Tony to be set free! Who’s excited? I know I am. I hope y’all like this chapter. The weather is warming up here and it's so exciting! So, get out and enjoy the warmth. -Shadows
The jet sped off back to the tower the second Bruce had Tony securely started down to the tiny medical bed they had there. He was still loosely holding Steve’s hands and was beginning to nod off. Tony’s voice was slurred and It was a battle to keep him awake.
Steve eventually had to get up to grab the lube out of the suitcase. But, when Steve turned back around to start prepping his husband he saw Tony laying on his arms with his ass on display. Tony looked back at Steve with a wink and Steve very quickly got the memo. He kneeled behind his love and brought his hands up to massage at Tony’s cheeks. His ass was so plush and amazing. Steve could stay buried there and be happy for the rest of his life.
“I’ll cut right to the chase,” began the doctor and Steve and Rhodey listened closely. “Mr. Stark is in bad shape. The metal in his neck sliced through his vocal cords quite profoundly. We tried to save them but the damage what extremely extensive and they had to be removed. I’m sorry but in his condition, it is extremely unlikely that Mr. Stark will ever talk again.”
"We need to protect the stone!" Steve yelled as he launched his shield at another speeder, causing it to crash right into one of the flying whale-like things. "We need to keep Thanos away from the Soul Stone!"
“Oh, you don't say?” he said as he took another sip of his coffee.  He was trying to stall for as long as possible, but even he had to admit it was starting to get ridiculous.
"All right," said Davis, narrowing his already beady eyes. "Just one more question, then, Mr Stark, if I may."
"Copy that," Steve murmured. He drew in a deep breath as he glanced around the circle, at his teammates who he had come to love as though they were his own brothers and sisters. Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Thor, and James, who had been there from the very beginning, Pietro, who had become the son Clint had never thought he'd have, and Scott, Gamora, Nebula, and Rocket, who were all there because they believed in the Avengers, believed that their team could actually return things back to normal.
"I do," Steve murmured as his arm slid around Tony's shoulders, drawing him closer. "Just like with you, I didn't have a choice. You Starks are pretty charming."
"Looking pretty snazzy up there, Cap!" Sam called from his spot about a metre or so away from Bucky. "Are ya ready to get started?"
"Yes, yes, I will be glad when all of that garbage has been finally removed from D.C.," said one of the other members, some Senator from Wyoming or something whose name escaped Tony at the moment. "It is such an eyesore in the middle of our beautiful capital."
"Tony!" Steve screamed, his throat raw from all the dust and debris and yelling after his husband and son. His heart was thudding so hard it felt like it was going to shatter as he scanned the sky, clutching his chest.
"Got another headache, little guy?" Papa asked as he started the engine, gesturing for Chief Stacy to get in front of him. "Did you forget your glasses again?"
"Grandpa was here," he said softly. "He came by early this morning and I wasn't gonna—he asked me not to tell you, but—"
"Christ, baby, you're incredible," Tony murmured into Steve's shoulder, his fingertips trailing along Steve's sweaty back and sides. Steve raised his head, softly kissing Tony's lips before carefully pulling out of him and rolling onto his back, gathering Tony into his arms and drawing the sheets up over them. He knew they should probably get cleaned up and get something to eat before Peter and the others got back, but he was too relaxed, too content, too satiated at the moment to even want to move, much less attempt to make it into the shower that seemed way too far away at the moment.
"I… uh… I should've asked what you liked last night when I stopped by," he said as he spread the contents of the food bag across the centre of the blanket. "But since I didn't think of it I kinda just brought a little of everything, so I hope—I hope it's okay."
"Yeah, he's hanging in there," said Tony. "He's tough as nails, that kid, even if he doesn't look it. He's gonna pull through."
"Ah…" Steve shot Natasha a questioning look, getting a shrug in response. "Ah, sure, Scott. JARVIS, can you please direct Mr Lang on where he can park his van? We'll meet him at the front door."
Steve squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose. It was even worse than he'd feared.
"Contemplate-y?" Dad said, smirking as he sat back down, assuming his elbows-on-knees position. "Is that even a word?"
You know it’s 2020 when there’s as many currently named tropical storms/ hurricanes as I have children 😑.  I’m praying that everyone in the path of those storms, as well as the continuing wildfires, stays safe! 💖
Peter grinned as he flipped through the book, finding the page he had marked the night before. "Wanna know where it came from?"
Of course, Tony now realised that he had been an absolute fool to believe that it would just end like that.  That he’d been a complete idiot to not have guessed that when he didn't see neither hide nor hair of Obie for the entire rest of the day, it meant that Obie was up to something.
He’d been trying to ignore the fact that Steve Rogers was literally the living, breathing embodiment of Tony’s vision of the perfect man, limiting their conversations strictly to small talk when he picked Peter up in the evenings.  He’d even backed off on allowing Peter to invite Steve over for dinner, thinking there’d be no way that Steve would ever agree to such an invitation.
But first, they had a battle to win. 'The most intense and difficult battle of their lives,' based on what Peter had heard from Dr Strange.
"Both Starks can take up elevated positions," Dr Strange said. "The rest can then spread out along the ground. I'll be waiting in plain sight, as when Thanos arrives he will no doubt be drawn directly towards the stone."
"Of course it was," Steve said as he shook Stacy's hand. "Tony and I have arranged a car to take you and Gwen back to the city whenever you're ready."
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button, and leave me a comment if you like!  😊
" Tony finally said, rushing the words. He forcibly snapped his jaw closed, swallowing hard. "How in the hell are you even real?"
"'M tired," Peter mumbled as he tried again with the backpack, this time missing his shoulder completely as it landed on one of the adjoining seats. Steve let out a chuckle from behind him as he picked it up, placing his free hand on Peter's shoulder.
"Not like there's any other places to hide out here," said Sam. "Redwing's sweeping for more stragglers now, Cap."
"Okay, buddy." Tony leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Peter's forehead. "I'm gonna get Papa back in here so we can both say goodbye, yeah? Let you get some sleep?"
"All right," he said quietly. "But let me clear this with King T'Challa first, okay? I want to reassure him that the Soul Stone will be returned to his people as soon as we're done using it."
"No, it's not." Peter let out a heavy sigh, punctuated by another wet cough as he glanced up at Steve. "So how come you're not at work?"
"Can I help you, sir?" asked the cadet overseeing the computer lab as soon as Steve stepped inside. She had shot to her feet so fast upon seeing Steve that she'd bumped into her desk, the resulting scraping noise on the polished linoleum floor sending a shiver down Steve's spine. He'd always hated that sound.
Clearing his throat, Tony planted his feet and squared his shoulders, keeping his repulsors aimed directly at Hammer's chest.
A bolt of pleasure shot down Tony's spine at Steve's words, and the way his lips tickled the sensitive shell of his ear. He tilted his head up to meet Steve's mouth in a firm kiss, whimpering when Steve's tongue swiped across his bottom lip just before he pulled away.
If Steve hadn't possessed his serum-enhanced eyesight, which was thankfully completely healed following his run-in with the blinding yellow beam, he would have missed the flinch that O'Brien tried very hard—but still failed—to suppress. As it was, the general managed to catch himself before it became too apparent, but the effect was clear. In his arrogance, General O'Brien had completely underestimated Steve.
Peter glanced over at Gwen, who gave a subtle shake of her head. "I'm sorry, I'm not sure who you mean—"
Swiping at his eyes, Tony pressed his palm over the arc reactor, trailing his fingertip down the chain holding Steve’s dog tags.
"No, I definitely do not," said Steve. "In fact, I was kind of hoping that we could recreate our wedding night, if that's okay with you."
cool, and Peter has no doubt that Dad will be able to pull it off someday.  As long as it doesn’t kill him first.
“Maybe this weekend, Papa?” Peter asked as he and Tony stepped into the living room.  Steve’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of them, his two beloved boys that looked and acted so much alike, and who he loved beyond reason.
"Goddamnit," Tony said under his breath as he read one particularly interesting line of code, tapping it to enlarge it. "Hey, JARVIS?"
"Yeah, okay." Tony slammed down the receiver, hurrying back to Peter's room to find Howard sitting next to him on his bed, poking him in the ribs.
Regardless, Tony was too damn tired to want to think about it at the moment. All he wanted was to get through his work for the day as quickly as possible so he could get to the hospital in time to see Peter before curfew began.
“And, Steve,” Natasha says before Steve can answer.  “I’m sure Tony’s fine.  You know how he is when he gets to tinkering with new toys, and I’m sure HYDRA’s got a few in there.”
"I have already alerted the rest of the team, sir, and Mr Wilson is inbound to your location along with the Mark thirty-five armour," JARVIS cut in. "However, be advised that the armour is not yet fully equipped with your standard armament."
"That's never gonna happen, mo grá, I promise you," stated Steve. "Without you and Peter… I don't think I'd be able to survive, so…" He pressed a firm kiss to Tony's lips, brushing the tear away with his thumb. "Now, let's go see what Thor has to say, all right? The more intel we can get on these infinity gems, the better we'll be able to figure out a way to stop them."
"Well… I might've managed to figure it out because I realised I was falling in love with you," Steve said, rushing his words. He took another tentative step forward, his expression so earnest and pleading that Tony's heart lurched. "I asked Colonel Phillips to try and make sure that you were able to leave in time to visit with Peter, and when I saw how much happier you both were because of it, I just—it made me really happy."
"There's no way in hell that I'm going anywhere, Steve," Tony snapped. "There's just no goddamn way. I'm
But, as Peter suspected, the rain sounds didn't help much, if at all. And when the alarm went off the next morning, having not slept a single wink, his body stiff and sore from being curled into a tight ball the entire night, it hit him then that it hadn't been just a dream after all.
And, if that wasn’t enough, all four walls of his cell were covered in ice, the only exception being the small, square window, through which the man was now intently peering at him.
"Yeah, I get what you're saying." Tony slid off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. He'd noticed that Peter's hearing seemed a bit more heightened as well, and there was also the fact that he'd said he could smell his peanut butter sandwiches almost a full minute before Bucky had arrived with them.
"Captain Rogers!" Colonel Phillips called—or rather, yelled—through his open office door, which just happened to be only a few doors down from the computer lab. "A word, if you don't mind?"
Tony’s hands tightened on the steering wheel as he bit back his sharp retort.  Unfortunately, as much as he hated to admit it, the kid had a point.  Especially since at the moment, Tony honestly could not remember the last time he’d last set foot inside any retail establishment that wasn't a restaurant or coffee shop.
"Goddamnit, buddy, you're not supposed to be here!" Dad exclaimed as he flew up next to Peter. "You just scared the hell outta both of us!"
As Steve continued to talk, he noticed Tony’s eyes dropping further and his hand beginning to slack in Steve’s own. And that was when Steve truly began to panic. If Tony fell asleep now he might just slip off forever. He couldn’t lose Tony. He just couldn’t. He loved him!
“Cap, I named my bots DUM-E, U, and Butterfingers. Do you really think I’m cut out to name a baby? No. I’m absolutely not! This is your call.” Spoke Tony. He tried to keep his tone light and joking so as not to alert Steve to the real reason he didn’t want to name the baby. Steve was just asking as a courtesy after all.
Tony had periods of wakefulness followed by long periods of rest. The extent of Tony’s injuries mixed with the medication he was on just left Tony utterly exhausted. So, he spent his time sleeping. When he was awake Steve was at his side just talking to him. He kept Tony grounded. He didn’t know how he’d be dealing with all of this if Steve wasn’t at his side.
Bucky and Sam tried their best to help Steve through his grief but to no avail. He’d been through too much in the last five years for the comfort of friends to do much. They tried though so Steve had to give them that.
So, Steve just sat there and held Tony’s hand in his. He thanked the universe that the love of his life hadn’t died in that explosion. They could deal with everything else together, but Steve knew that it would irreparably shatter him if he were to lose Tony.
Steve smiled as he looked at Tony. He could hardly believe that they were here! This was the moment they’d’ long been waiting for. They were finally getting married. After so much they were finally getting married.
When Tony woke up again hours later it was to the sound of crying and Steve singing. Harley must have woken up wanting something. Tony just laid there in bed watching Steve with the baby. He was good with Harley. Tony knew he would be. Steve was made to be a good dad. Tony wasn’t.
You could have heard a pin drop in that room if it weren’t for the various beeping noises coming from the machines that surrounded Tony’s bed. Both Steve and Tony sat there in shock over Steve’s words. Steve, because he hadn’t expected himself to just blurt that out. Tony because he had been so certain that Steve hated him and that his crush on the soldier would never be reciprocated.
Steve was out with Sam and Bucky doing hell knows what when Tony asked his friends for help. He hadn’t been doing so great over the past few days and Tony had grown enough to know that he needed help. But this wasn’t something he was ready to converse with Steve about. So, he called in Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy.
Steve Roger’s did not hate Tony Stark. He didn’t, but the man just got on his nerves from the moment he’d met him. He was rich, loud, self-centred, and always got his way. He was nothing like Howard Stark. It was annoying. Sure, Steve had seen Tony go from self-centred to extremely selfless and sacrificial time after time, but that didn’t help his annoyance with the man.
“So, how does it feel to be back home?” smiled Steve as he pulled his shirt off and flopped down on the bed.
But once Tony met the man he had a whole new set of problems. He could tell the second they’d met that Steve Rogers hated him for not being Howard. He could smell the disappointment and hated off of the man. He must have read Romanov’s profile on him and based his decision off of that before even meeting him.
“Stark? Don’t you dare. You’ll die!” shouted Steve through the coms as soon as JARVIS confirmed the link.
Steve was a wreck as he and the others waited for Tony to get out of surgery. None of them knew how bad the injury was nor if Tony was alright. Steve was having an especially hard time. He felt so helpless. All he could do was sit there and wait while the man he’d fallen for under-went surgery. He felt helpless and angry and he couldn’t do anything. All Steve could do was wait and hope that Tony was alright.
“You’re doing so well Sweetheart. Just hang in there.” soothed Steve once Tony had been situated in his hospital bed and had been checked over by the doctors and nurses. He was progressing pretty fast and they were pretty sure that the baby would be there by morning.
So when Tony was about to go into heat six months after the other Avengers moved into the tower, and Steve offered to help, Tony didn’t say no. After all, Steve was being a gentleman and Tony wasn’t going to pass up on this opportunity. Maybe he was a masochist.
“Anthony Edward Stark, you mean the world to me. You are my first, my last, and my everything. I wouldn’t be half the man I am without you. You are the absolute love of my life. You’re my soulmate… and it hurts to see how little you think of yourself. If I could go back and punch Howard and Stane in the face then I would. You deserve the world, Tony. You’re my world.” Spoke Steve, firmly yet gently. He needed tony to know how much he loved him.
They already knew that they wanted to have the wedding at the compound. Not only was the location secure, but it was set up to host functions. So, with that in mind, it was a huge hassle trying to figure out decorations.
Three weeks after sharing his heat with Steve, Tony started to feel sick. He was throwing up often and he felt dizzy. That… that wasn’t good. Initially Tony just thought it was a stomach bug or food poisoning from Clint’s cooking. But when it didn’t go away Tony knew that there was a problem.
“You… you what?” asked Tony as he stared down at his hands. He couldn’t bring up the courage to look at Steve.
The next day they had an Avengers call out that left them both exhausted and Tony with a few nasty cuts. Steve worried and Tony assured him he was fine. The rest of the week followed in a similar fashion. Most weeks did. But, no matter what shit went down, they always had their date night to look forward to.
They had JARVIS take the controls and the two cuddled up together for the flight. There was some light kissing but nothing more. They wanted to save the main event for when they arrived at their destination.
“Hey, hey baby doll. Shh. Shh. It’s ok. Just stay still Tony. You’re safe. I’ve got you.” Soothed Steve and once Tony recognized the voice he sank back into the blankets around him. Steve was there! He’d make sure he was alright.
Tony awoke three days later to the irritating sound of a heart monitor. It took a little bit for Tony to finally manage to blink his eyes open, but when he finally did he was met with Steve holding his hand tightly while tears pooled in his own eyes.
Tony lifted his left hand a bit to feel at his neck. There was a hard case around it. A neck brace! There were also bandages all over his right eye. That must be why he couldn’t open it.
Steve didn’t know how to respond to that. Or well, to any of what was going on. Tony Stark was his soulmate and from the look and sound of things, it appeared that the man never thought that he’d ever have one. There was a certain insecurity in his voice that Steve was able to pick up.
That seemed to be a repeated phrase between the two of them since the incident. Just a reminder that they loved each other while the very fabric of their happy little reality had been shattered and replaced with doctors and IV drips.
It wasn’t long after that that the anesthesia took hold and Tony was being wheeled off to surgery. Steve had a few tears in his eyes as he watched Tony go.
The other Avengers took care of Loki while Steve helped Tony onto the jet sent for them and onto the carrier where medical was waiting. Despite their earlier arguments, Steve didn’t leave Tony’s side. They were soulmates. Their bond was special. He wasn’t going to just up and leave.
But for once, luck was on Tony’s side. Neither knew what happened, but after the kiss, Tony’s heart started again and Tony was shaken awake by a coughing fit. Steve all but shouted in joy as he helped Tony sit up to relieve the pressure on his chest.
Because of Tony’s past history, Steve was allowed to stay with Tony the next morning when they were putting Tony under. That morning was stressful. Neither of them was really dealing with the situation very well, but Steve put on a brave face for Tony.
The two set over an hour just talking and eating. It wasn’t often they got so much uninterrupted time to themselves so they took advantage of it. They shared stories of their day and laughed about how awkward it was in training with Steve being the leader of the team but Rhodey being a much higher military rank even though Steve was army and Rhodey was air force.
JARVIS was the one to alert Steve to the fact that Tony was out of surgery and being taken back to his room. Steve said his goodbyes and raced back to medical so that he could be at Tony's side. He thanked the doctors profusely for helping Tony and then sat down at his fiancé’s side and just held his hand. Tony’s face was absolutely swathed in bandages that had tinges of blood around the edges. He was glad that Tony was still asleep because he knew that if Tony was awake that he’d be in pain despite the pain meds he was on.
Steve sat there in shock as he absorbed the news. Tony was pregnant. Tony was pregnant with his baby. Well, that certainly explained why Tony looked so nervous. And yes, this was coming as a huge shock. They had only shared one heat together and now they were going to have a baby.
Steve took his sweet time opening Tony up. He drew out every little sound from Tony until his lover was pliant under his touch. Steve loved how submissive Tony often was for him. Tony had always liked being more submissive in bed. He just didn’t get to indulge in it as much. Not until he got with Steve.
“You know I’ll never say no to dancing with you. And to think you were once nervous about dancing with me.” Smiled back Tony as Steve took him into his arms.
So here we go. Finally, the turning point where the angst slowly starts to turn into fluff. I hope you’re ready. Also, this one’s a little short cuz I’ve been busy with school. I’ve got so many projects and pictures to take for my classes. Actually, huge self-plug. If you like photography and cool low light stuff, follow my insta,
“Fuck, Steve. So close. Right there, so fucking close…” cried out Tony as Steve’s thrusts picked up.
And Tony did. He came with a whine and had Steve following a moment later. Tony was just so sweet and so tight and making all sorts of noises. Steve couldn’t help himself.
"Did I ever tell you that you're an excellent father?" Steve asked as he and Tony made their way to their suite. He'd meant the comment as a sincere—if not a bit rhetorical—compliment, and so was alarmed when Tony's head whipped up to look at him, his brown eyes alight with fear and self-deprecation. He immediately paused in the hallway, reaching for Tony's elbows. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
"Watch your step as you go inside, Peter," Ms Sharon said as she guided him into his tiny bathroom. "Don't want you to trip."
"Yes, sir," JARVIS said, and Tony could just picture the quizzical, raised-eyebrow look that Mr Jarvis used to give him whenever he had asked him something less than brilliant.
"Stay here," Colonel Rhodes said once they pulled into the parking lot. "I'll go and grab a wheelchair."
Of course, Tony had had no idea that was the case when Regina was hired, and neither did anyone else at Stark Industries.  Including Obie, who had given the final go-ahead to hire her.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony says quickly, in that awful dismissive way that Steve has already come to loathe.  “I’m just…”  He lets out a short laugh, throwing up his hands.  “I’m just the one who led us down into this goddamn booby trap, but hey, at least you're not gonna bleed to death anymore, so—”
"You can get out now too, sweetheart, if you're tired," Steve said once Natasha and Bruce were gone. "I'll stay with him."
"You do remember that none of my PhDs are in repairing spacecraft, right?" Bruce said, obviously just as frustrated as Tony.
Taking a sip of his coffee, Tony pulled up Beck's employee file on his tablet, skimming down the list of projects he had overseen in the ten years he had been with Stark Industries, including the arc reactor installation in the SI building in D.C., a few items for the weapons division that never ended up panning out, and specs for various electronic devices over the years. He had just about reached the end of the list when something caught his eye, causing him to let out a gasp.
Opening the door, Tony was pleased to see that he had been spot on with his assessment.  Not only was Obie sitting at his grand desk puffing on one of his smelly cigars, but he was even leaning back in his chair, resting his perfectly polished black Berluti loafers on top of it like he didn't have a single care in the entire world.
“I am afraid at this time I cannot locate an official requisition for the other three thousand rifles, sir,” JARVIS stated.
"JARVIS, can you please cancel my alarm for the morning?" he asked quietly. He could always go for a run later in the day if the weather cleared up. "Just let me know once Peter wakes up."
"Well, maybe if you talk about it a bit, it might help?" Peter continued. "My dad and my grandpa never talked all that much when I was little, unless you count bickering as talking, which I don't, but… I think it's partly why their relationship is so bad. Well, that plus the fact that my grandpa's drunk a lot of the time, but… I know that's not a problem with Uncle Sam, so…"
Steve's stomach growled then, a sharp reminder that he was once again late to meet his teammates for dinner. He glanced down at his abdomen, silently telling it that it was just going to have to wait a bit longer. He wasn't yet done.
"So, my mom was asking if I thought I needed to buy a new shirt to wear to The Lion King?" Ned asked. "What do you guys think?"
Burning hot rage welled up inside Tony's gut, and he let out a growl as he was finally able to connect the hose, nearly sobbing when Peter whimpered softly and smacked his lips before sucking in a deep, rattling breath.
"Good boy," Tony murmured. "Now, we've got a little over two hours before we need to go get Pete, so go on and get all hot and sweaty while I go and daydream about getting you all hot and sweaty. Okay,
Especially given the current volatile political climate. President Cole had only technically been in office for less than three weeks, and Tony had already heard a few rumours about a legislation package in development that was planning to revive the previously shot-down anti-vigilante bill, only this time with new changes in wording that could be interpreted as labelling the Avengers themselves as vigilantes unless the team agreed to fall under the control of the government.
Peter tipped forward into Dad’s chest, relieved when Dad wrapped his arms around him.  “Uh huh.  You promise?”
"And how in the hell are we gonna do that?" demanded Rhodey. "I used up almost all of my ammo on the first—!"
"Yes," she said. "When I said that I've never seen you so happy, Steven, I meant it. And Tony is nothing but charming, that's for sure. And he absolutely adores you."
The sound of Steve's heavy footsteps approaching broke Tony from his thoughts, and he looked up, his heart doing the little fluttery thing it always did whenever Steve entered the room. He was obviously fresh from his shower, with his flushed cheeks and his still-damp hair combed back, wearing one of Tony's favourite blue t-shirts that matched his eyes and looking so unbelievably sexy that Tony's mouth suddenly went dry.
"Then we'll fucking head into it!" Tony yelled, the final remnants of his patience finally fraying into nothing but wisps of thread. "I can't believe we're all still sitting here on our asses when we know where he's headed! This is
"No, I don't," he finally said, peeking at Steve over his shoulder. He bit down on his pale bottom lip, his glassy brown eyes filled with guilt. "Sorry, hon. I'm just…"
"Well, that's because Chester is a good man who's unfortunately stuck in a bad situation," Grandma stated. "The same of which could probably be said about your father."
"I would then venture to believe that he would therefore decline the offer of this armour as well, sir," said JARVIS. "Would you not?"
"Mmm," said Stane, running his fingers along his salt and pepper goatee. "Well, then I guess we'll just have to try something a bit stronger." He stepped back, jerking his head towards the far corner of the image. "Get the sceptre."
Peter had just pulled out his two laptops to start working on the HYDRA files when JARVIS announced that his dads were on the line. He quickly hid the computers under his blankets, running a nervous hand through his hair as he grabbed his tablet.
He could now easily out-eat Papa, which, according to Dad, was supposed to be just about impossible.
of a badly-landing aircraft cut him off, and Steve took off running towards the runway just as Bucky's X-302 skidded to a stop. Air lodged in Steve's throat as he caught up to the aircraft, the cockpit and engines covered in flames as members of the fire brigade smothered them with their fire-suppression foam, the billowing black smoke burrowing deep into Steve's lungs with every single one of his ragged breaths.
"What the hell does that mean?" Tony snapped, swearing as the Hammer suit tailing him fired a compact missile, impacting it between his shoulder blades and briefly knocking him off course. "What do you mean you can't get in?"
"Preferably without burning down the palace, correct, little sister?" T'Challa said firmly, earning an exaggerated scoff from Shuri.
Somehow, Steve had managed to figure out who Peter was. It was the only explanation Peter could think of for his goofy reaction when he'd said that his father would probably like him if they ever met. Steve's face had turned as red as a beet, which could only mean that he'd already decided that he liked Dad, and Dad had seemed so giddy on the phone it was obvious that he really liked Steve. It had been so long since Peter had heard anything resembling excitement in his father's voice that he had almost forgotten what it sounded like.
been on Steve’s to-do list for that day, an issue that he was forced to rectify only seconds before he walked through the door.  Trying to keep himself from breaking down right in front of Peter had been less easy, but he’d still managed to do it.
"Ah huh. Even if they're now inspiring other people to try and play superhero?" asked Mr Stacy. "Does that change your opinion at all?"
"Yeah. I know lots of people who blame him for what happened. But it's not really fair, is it? It's not like he's the one who blew up the power plant and caused all this mess. He wasn't even at the base when it happened. He was at the hospital with my dad."
"Look at me, Tony," Steve said as he trailed his fingertips down Tony's arm, intertwining their fingers. "I love you, mo grá. I love you so much!"
Not exactly what he would've expected from a bunch of stuck-up pilots, and while Tony wasn't quite ready to completely dismiss his long-held stereotypes about pilots as a whole, pieces were chipping away pretty fast.
"Well, neither did I," he admitted. "Even before the serum, I never thought that I would—" He broke off, gulping against the knot in his throat. "You know, I grew up taking hits, just about every single day. And in a way, I used to welcome it. 'Cause if all the bullies were busy hittin' me, that meant they weren't hittin' someone else. And then once Pearl Harbour happened and the U.S. entered the war, I begged the Army to take me 'cause I knew it was the right thing to do. I was gonna die soon anyway, or at least that's what all the doctors kept saying, so I figured that I may as well die fighting some of the biggest and baddest bullies around, right? And then after I got the serum, well… then I could finally fight back. Finally give them a taste of their own medicine, you know?"
Steve somehow managed to look at such a godawful hour to remember what he was going to say. How was it possible for him to be that hot so early in the morning, especially when Tony was certain that he resembled little more than a semi-human brillo pad?
I have more stories in the works!  I am hoping to post the first of my Marvel Trumps Hate auction winners in the next couple of weeks, which will also be part of the Pieces of Echoes series.  I also am participating in the Fandom Trumps Hate auctions, so be sure to look for my listing! 😊
Peter tipped his head back, inhaling a deep breath through his nose. Grandma had increased both his oxygen flow and the dosage of one of his medicines earlier in the day, worried about his increasing heart rate, and the last thing Peter wanted was to somehow alert her to what he was doing.
After the chorus of affirmative grunts, Steve steps back inside the Quinjet to replace the tablet and gather up his cowl and shield.  Securing the shield onto his back, Steve fastens the cowl under his chin as he heads towards the jet’s aft section, where his brand-new Harley Davidson Street 750 motorcycle sits secured to the floor.  Tony presented him with the bike the night before they left for the mission, and while Steve knew he shouldn't read too much into things—Tony has supplied all of the equipment for the six of them ever since the Battle of New York—he still can’t help but let out a smile as he unhooks the binding straps and grabs onto the bike’s crisp, leather-covered handles.  Rolling it down the ramp, Steve arrives just in time to catch Tony as he steps into his armoured suit, the shiny red and golden metal encasing him into its protective shell.
“Yeah, yeah, I get it.  You're hungry,” Steve said as he gently placed her on the floor.  After preparing their dinner, a can of tuna for Ashes and leftover Chinese food for him, Steve crossed the relevant steps off on his list and reached into his foot locker, retrieving his sketchbook.  After not having sketched all weekend, Steve was looking forward to flexing his drawing muscles again.
And then, once Peter was fully recovered, Tony was finally going to cast off Howard's iron veil and move them both out of that house, finally leaving all of its toxic memories behind. There was a beautiful three-bedroom log cabin situated out on a nearby lake that he'd had his eye on ever since he was assigned to the X-300 program, and it had just recently come up for rent again. The cabin would be perfect for him and Peter, nice and quiet with plenty of space for them to each have their own research areas but still close enough to the base for Tony to get to work easily.
"Oh gods, buddy, I'm sorry," Tony said. "I shouldn't've snapped at you. But here I've been thinking this whole time that you and Steve didn't even know each other and it turns out that you've known him even longer than I have, so you'll have to forgive me if I'm just a bit confused as to what the hell's going on."
“Yes,” Steve whispered as he drew in a shaky breath.  “I was just thinking… what—what’re the odds of—
In fact, they hadn't had to buy new sheets in almost two weeks now, which Tony was sure was a new record.
Or rather, he heard him mention the name Stark, and more specifically, "That Stark bastard's goddamn flying suits."
"Uh huh." Peter allowed Papa to lift him to his feet, setting him back down on the couch. He did feel a bit better after he ate a few slices of Papa's awesome homemade pizza, and after tackling his physics and chemistry homework and taking a long hot shower, he crawled into his bed, cuddling his polar bear to his chest while his dads hovered over him.
Thankfully, Mags chooses that moment to appear with their food, covering their small table with plates of pizza and baskets of breadsticks and dipping sauce, along with cups of Dr Pepper and water.  Apparently already basking in his so-called triumph, Peter decides to change the subject, talking a mile a minute about the project he and Ned are working on in chemistry while they eat.  By the time there’s nothing but crumbs remaining, Tony is certain that his beloved son is either going to change the entire world with his chemistry experiments, or cause it to explode.
But, really. It's not like he was just going to turn his ears off whenever the medical people started gossiping about him or his family, and especially not while they were discussing Peter's condition right in front of him. Even after Ms Sharon had asked the doctor to be quieter he'd still insisted on spouting off to the medical student he'd had shadowing him, no doubt trying to show off.
Steve gave a shudder, his mouth already watering. "Well, all right then. But just remember, I'm gonna take my time."
"There are ten of us here, Mr Stark, including Peter and the young lady who opened the cell, and her brother, who I'm pretty sure just took out most if not all of the resistance left inside here. Sergeant Barnes and Agent Romanoff just went to have a final look."
"No, I don't mind. And we were thinking of just holding the party outside, in the front yard. We'll get some tents and tables and portable bathrooms so there won't be any need for people to be traipsing around inside the buildings."
Steve let out a frustrated noise as he glanced over at Peter. He knew that Dr Cho had warned him it could be days before Peter woke up, but the thought of leaving him made Steve's heart feel as heavy as a lead balloon. The chance—albeit small—that Peter would wake up and find himself alone was almost too much for Steve to bear at the moment.
“Can you do that for me, Miss Potts?” Tony repeated.  “The statement will need to be released the moment our contracts are fulfilled.”
"Only that your relationship with him wasn't that great," Steve said, laced with sympathy. "And that Howard never really recovered from his arrest and trial."
A massive knot rose in Peter's throat, guilt stabbing him like a knife. Dad was so certain that he was going to be okay, but—
“Yeah,” Peter whispered.  “Daddy, do you think Obie’s selling weapons to the insurgents in Sokovia?  I mean… that’s where all the signs seem to be pointing here.”
—to Steve the ring was a tactile symbol of that very hope. The three stones in the ring, the blue stone flanked by the two red stones, represented each of them: Steve, Tony, and Peter, with the etched phoenix a symbol of their rebirth as a complete family.
"With all six stones I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist," stated Thanos. "I call that… mercy."
And then, as he took his seat at that table, flanked by his husband and son as he looked out onto the rest of his amazing teammates, Steve raised his bottle of his favourite Irish beer, waiting while they all took hold of their own various beverages.
"Then I am afraid that I have misled you, which is not at all my intended purpose," Thor replied. "Along with the assistance of Dr Selvig and Jane Foster, I was able to defeat the Dark Elves, yes. But, as much as I tried, I could not destroy the Aether. Not with all of my power channeled through my hammer was I able to destroy it. And now, without my hammer… I fear that it would be truly impossible."
Ned narrowed his eyes. "Yeah, but since when have you been such a slacker? Normally you'd have a project like that done in a day or two."
"And when I'm not telling you that stuff, I'm just supposed to sit here and listen while you complain about it? And then just nod and tell you it's normal?" Gwen continued. "Is that what I'm supposed to do? Well, I hate to say it, Peter, but I don't think I can do that. Because it's not normal. None of it is."
He found his two boys and Thor already seated around the kitchen table, with an already filled plate and a fresh cup of coffee at his place next to Steve. Tony planted a quick kiss on his husband's cheek before sliding into his chair, ignoring Peter's wrinkled nose as he took a big gulp of the coffee.
It was an X-302, an exact copy of the aircraft Steve was flying. The only difference was the paint job.
"Just some small plans that I made," Steve murmured, winking as he kissed the tip of Tony's nose. He slipped his phone from his pocket and turned on the music player, with Tony letting out a wide grin as the crooning voice of John Legend filled the room.
"Then make sure you guys watch your backs," Sam said, swooping over Tony's head, his dual guns blazing. "I don't really feel like having any civilian casualties on my hands today."
Tony looked up at him, his brown eyes filled with such torturous anguish that Steve nearly broke down completely. "Steve…
"True. But still… something just doesn't sit right with me about HYDRA using these disposable soldiers. I mean, it's not that I can't see them doing it, but even if their only goal was to get at Pete, it doesn't seem right that they would try almost the exact same thing again after it didn't work the first time. They're smarter than that."
Gwen bit her bottom lip, shifting nervously on her feet. "It's for a physics internship," she said. "At Oxford."
"Yep. And Strange said that because of that, it was too fast for him to safely generate a portal," answered Tony. "Which means, if we use warp as a basis for our travels through this quantum tunnel, then we technically don't need that final variable because it doesn't factor into the warp calculations."
"Oh yeah, we both went out there just the other day," replied Bucky. "Erin's doing okay. The kid keeps her pretty busy, I guess he's starting to pull up on the furniture now? She said she barely gets a chance to sit down with how active he is, so that's probably a good thing."
"I'm so sorry to have to wake you, sweetheart," he whispered in Tony's ear as Tony let out an annoyed moan, his brow furrowing into a frown that looked so much like one of Peter's that on any other day it would've made Steve laugh. As much as he often had to fight to get Tony to sleep, once he was asleep he was just about as difficult to wake up as Peter, and that was saying something.
Barely fifteen minutes later Steve was on his motorcycle and racing towards the hospital. But he had no sooner set foot on the paediatric floor when he suddenly stopped short. So much had changed since his last visit that he couldn't believe it had only been a couple of days, and he needed to make sure that he didn't reveal anything inappropriate to Peter.
"Off," Tony gasped into Steve's mouth as he slid the t-shirt up his abdomen, his fingertips searing heat into Steve's skin with every touch, just like they had ever since the very first time he brought Tony to his bed. They had been together now for over three years and married for almost two, and yet Tony's touch was still able to completely electrify him every single time they were intimate.
Steve frowned, tapping his fingers on the back of Tony's hand. "That's another odd thing that I noticed in my research. I found a list of civilian scientists that had worked for the Air Corps over the years. Your name was on it, and Howard's, and a guy named Justin Hammer that—"
The ring—a simple white gold band inlaid with three small stones, one blue stone flanked with two red stones—was absolutely
Tony said as he kissed the same spot again, pulling a low moan from Steve's throat. "And I intend to discover more of those places tonight, as long as you're up for it."
"Shh, it's okay, honey," Tony said, kissing him softly on the lips. "I'm gonna take good care of you tonight. Put that super soldier libido of yours to good use."
“That sounds like something Obie would say,” he said to his cereal bowl, so quietly that Tony had to strain to hear him.
"Mr Stark! Do you plan on continuing to work for the Air Corps now that General O'Brien has been arrested?"
"And you did, Steve," said Natasha. "You did rid the world of HYDRA, even if it wasn't quite in the way that you thought."
