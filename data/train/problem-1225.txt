"Don't what?" said Harry innocently.
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could ye? It's not been an easy journey."
"Relax, Sherl. I'm sure it'll be okay." John wrapped his arm around Sherlock's waist and led him out of the room. "We'll see you in the morning, Harry. Please  don't call room service." Harry bid them goodnight and tried his best to go to sleep.
“This court case is going to be quite difficult, as the only evidence is in your head, so stay strong, but there’s no guarantee he’ll be charged.” Harry nodded, already with a plan beginning to form. As he followed everyone else out of the school, he began running through laws and protocols in his mind, switching between muggle and magic until he had what he hoped was the perfect case.
Draco came into the room first, already fully dressed, but without his hair slicked back. It was the first time Harry had seen him without copious amounts of gel in his hair. Harry reckoned he looked a lot better without it. Draco looked at himself in the mirror above the fireplace and sighed.
After all the presents had been opened and everyone had been thanked, the seven of them went out for lunch, as no one in the Holmes-Watson family could cook.
“The trial’s in half an hour, so you better get changed,” said John once he saw his son was awake. Harry nodded and stood up, slowly regaining balance and consciousness as he walked up to his room.
Because school for Harry was starting the next day, there was little time for John and Sherlock to discuss the events of the morning. They were both fine with that. Harry had been looking forward to school since he had moved in with Sherlock. Learning was such a fun thing for him, and Sherlock had said that if he got good scores in everything he would be allowed to start working cases and going to crime scenes. That was the best motivation for Harry and he made a vow to work as hard as possible on every subject.
An hour later, all five of them returned, none empty handed, but none completely finished.
"Come on Harry," said John, pulling the boy towards the back door.
“I don’t have a warrant,” said Lestrade before they entered the old castle.
"So, what do you think it's guarding?" asked Harry.
"Hmm... Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" Harry scowled at his teacher. What he was asking wasn't going to appear in the curriculum for a good few years. Snape was trying to trip him up.
"We have the legal documents that disagree, Hagrid. And why would Harry's 'real' parents leave him with such awful people?" asked Sherlock. John took a slightly less logical approach and punched Hagrid in the gut with all his strength. It barely fazed the giant man, but John's kick between his legs certainly did.
When Sherlock and John had replied to his letter, Sherlock too had been frustrated by the lack of science, but intrigued by the mystery. John had been more worried about the three-headed dog and the threat of death that could come to the curious. He had also been concerned about Harry being the Boy Who Lived and the possibility of a dark wizard coming to the school to find whatever had been moved from Gringotts.
School was slowly becoming more and more time consuming as the weeks went on. The teachers all had their reasons, such things as 'exams are only eight months away,' and 'you'll thank us later'. Harry couldn't stand it. He adored learning, but the piles of homework in addition to the case file Sherlock would send him every week, meant there was little time left that he could spend investigating the secrets of the school.
Eventually, he managed to fall into a fitful sleep. When he woke at eight the next morning, he was exhausted. He sat up and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. After putting on his glasses, he got up and made himself a giant cup of instant coffee. It may have tasted terrible, but four shots did wonders for waking up in the morning. Unfortunately, he drank eight shots instead and got a bad case of the shakes. He sighed and clenched his fists. Sorting out his coffee problem was a task for another day.
Eventually, it came to four o’clock and the five of them headed back to the flat, laden with presents.
Once she had disappeared from Harry's view, he left the owlery. Distracted by thoughts of the third-floor corridor, he didn't notice a fellow student running towards him. He collided with a very puffed Neville Longbottom and they both hit the floor.
That whole conversation was forgotten when Sherlock and John came in, announcing that it was finally time to open presents. A small cheer went up as John sat beside the small tree, handing out the gifts.
"I didn't know you had a son," said the military man. Sherlock ignored him.
“Har-Potter!” someone yelled, bringing Harry out of his thoughts and back to the great hall. He turned to see Malfoy approaching once again.
Every day of that fortnight was spent in almost panic-inducing anxiety. Harry was terrified that Dumbledore would escape, or wouldn’t be charged, or cast another spell and get Harry sent back to the Dursleys. He’d started having nightmares, what little he could remember of his aunt and uncle haunting his every resting moment. All thoughts of the Philosopher’s Stone were pushed from his mind, replaced with him waking up in the middle of the night, terrified that he was back in the cupboard.
"I'm going to do as much investigating as I can into Hogwarts. There may be another, better school that we can send him to. Until then," he turned to Hagrid, "you are not welcome here. Leave now, or I will have you forcibly removed." Hagrid tried to apologise, but was met only with harsh words. Eventually, he turned and left the Holmes House.
The car slowed to a stop and the doors were opened by the chauffeur. Harry stared in awe at the massive building before him. He had never seen it before, as the relationship between Sherlock and his brother was far from familiar.
They went even deeper underground, the cart going even faster, passing waterfalls and flashes of fire that dropped out of view before Harry could get a good look at them.
"Okay," said John. He kissed Sherlock on the cheek and left the room. Sherlock stood there, dumbstruck for a few seconds, then he came back to his senses and told Harry to get himself some breakfast. Harry obliged happily, thinking about the interesting people he was going to meet today. As he reached the kitchen, he saw there was a box of Coco Pops on the bench. There was a note attached.
The ornate rug in the landing was scratchy and kind of ugly. Harry wasn't a big fan of old-fashioned things like castles or oil paintings. He liked learning about them, but seeing them in real life was weird. They had been made by people long dead. It just made him uncomfortable. Especially the suits of armour.
"And your coats need to be locked in do they?" Sweat appeared on Mr Dursley's brow.
"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff. Everyone bent their heads and were carried through a curtain of ivy which hid a large opening in the cliff. They floated through a dark tunnel that seemed to take them right underneath the castle.
He walked to his dorm, annoyed about how little he had found out. For some reason, Flamel didn't show up in Modern Alchemy: Everything You Need To Know, or in The Greatest Discoveries in 20th Century Alchemy. A few of the books had mentioned him, but never saying anything more than his name.
"Where do you want to go?" asked the cabbie.
Days passed with Harry barely leaving his room, in a caffeine-induced craze, trying to find a way to prove that without even a shadow of doubt, that Sirius Black was innocent, and that Dumbledore was completely guilty. It was proving quite a challenge, but on the morning of Dumbledore’s trial, Harry sprinted from his room, a binder filled with hundreds of scribbled notes under his arm and proudly dropped it in front of Sherlock.
“We slowly walked through the house, checking each room before arriving at the final one, right on the top floor. The door was open and the dust masked all footsteps. The aurors went in first, wands raised, ready for trouble. And trouble they met.
"I am Professor Snape. You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He had the ability to capture the full attention of every student in the room without even trying. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses ... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death – if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
(See the end of the chapter for
Over the next few months, Dumbledore refused to acknowledge Harry’s existence, something that Harry was perfectly fine with. He had more important things to worry about, such as homework, schoolwork, and slowly but surely warding the door to the third-floor corridor in an attempt to stop anyone who knew a simple unlocking spell gaining access. It was unbelievably easy, and Harry couldn’t understand why none of the teachers had done it. Surely they would use every measure available to keep out unwanted visitors. Harry disregarded it as an oversight, but still kept a watchful eye on the corridor, setting up a bit of magic surveillance, just in case.
Theif, you have been warned, beware
When the sun began to set, Harry was explaining the finer details on how the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a woman in London had been brought to light. Fred and George had wanted to know everything about every single case. Though they already followed most of them through muggle newspapers, it was different to hear such detailed first-hand recounts of cases.
"No. I know a spell that could help find him though," said Harry, pulling out his wand. "What's its name?"
Another Sherlock Holmes wasn't exactly what the world needed, but it seemed like that was what it was going to get.
"Give me a minute, Malfoy." Harry slowly got up and pulled on his uniform. Hedwig's cage was still sitting on top of his trunk and she hooted softly. Harry opened the cage and she flew onto his shoulder. He grabbed a treat and fed it to her before grabbing his school bag and leaving the dormitory.
“Is that true, Mr Holmes?” McGonagall asked, looking sceptical.
Instead, he focussed on learning about the magical world so that he could one day understand how magic worked.
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others, it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus", the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
“How the hell am I supposed to find a Death Eater if he can teleport?” asked Sherlock angrily. “And who the hell is the Boy Who Lived?”
"No. Excuse me." the four of them had reached the end of the hall and were now standing in front of a tall desk with an old goblin sitting behind it. "We would like to access Harry Po-Holmes's vault, please." The goblin leaned over the desk and scowled at Harry.
"I dunno. Something that wouldn't be safe anywhere else," replied Harry, wishing there was just a bit more information at his disposal.
Hermione dropped the book down on a nearby table with a loud thud before opening it and flicking through the pages, stopping around halfway through.
Around an hour later, the bell went and Harry went off to his next class, trying his best to avoid other people. The news of his identity had travelled like wildfire and he was met with someone wanting to see him at almost every corner. Everywhere he went he was followed by whispers and pointing fingers. He was glad for the distraction that work provided, but he knew he had made the wrong decision when it came to Snape. Maybe it had been a mistake to come to Hogwarts at all. The house system didn't seem too smart, as teachers had favourites. The whole school had something off about it, but maybe it was just all the antiques giving Harry the creeps.
"Do you know what the sorting ceremony involves?" Harry asked Draco.
"Maybe whatever this guy was trying to steal." Hermione handed over the newspaper she had been reading and pointed to a small article.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I had hoped that my father was wrong about that man," said Draco.
Sorry it's so short. The next one will be longer. Thank you so much for reading and commenting!
The five of them hurried through the busy platform and through the barrier, back into the muggle world. Harry bumped into a somewhat familiar person with bright green hair, but they were soon forgotten when he saw his dads. He dropped his trunk and ran towards them, hugging them both tightly.
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
"Of course he is. You can't expect him to stick around all day, can you?" said Draco through a mouthful of chocolate.
"How did you do that? That's a fourth year spell," asked Draco and the girl.
He kept on waving until the platform was out of sight, then he flopped into one of the chairs and sighed.
Whether we be old and bald
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hurry up!" Called Harry as he sat in the hallway. Sherlock and John weren't ready yet and he was getting worried. The last thing he wanted to be was late on the first day. Finally, Sherlock and John emerged from their rooms. They both took some paracetamol then John made Harry his lunch. The left at 7:00, leaving half an hour to complete the six-minute walk to St Mary's Bryanston Square Primary School. It took all of Harry's self-control to not sprint ahead of John and Sherlock. Instead, he held Sherlock's hand and walked beside them.
"Good morning, Harry," said Mrs Hudson as she walked into the flat.
"I hope he doesn't come back," said Harry causing everyone to jump.
"I am not Vernon Dursley, and if you had any part in placing Harry in his 'care' then I would kindly ask you to leave, and if you refuse, I will not hesitate to call the police," said Sherlock sharply. The giant looked quite taken aback.
“The person. They had, umm… er… I can’t remember,” said Hermione sadly. Harry looked at her oddly, until that conversation also slipped from his mind. He checked his watch.
Finally, the gates opened and the new parents were lead to one of the school assembly halls. There were around a hundred chairs set up with some space left on the floor for the kids to sit. The seats were quickly filled up. Harry was one of the first children to sit at the front of the hall. The others took a long time to separate from their parents. There was quite a bit of crying. Harry sighed and began to deduct the children and parents around them. The couple closest to him had a large white dog and a black cat. Neither of them wanted to be there. A child sitting a few metres away was extremely spoiled and very overweight. The blond mop of hair was very familiar, then it dawned on Harry. He scanned the crowd, his face filled with fear, but he couldn't see the Dursleys. He looked back at the child and saw that it wasn't Dudley, just some other kid. Harry relaxed. He was safe.
“I don’t. It’s probably the wrong Harry. It is a common name,” said Harry, shoving the letter in his pocket. Harry thought for a moment before grabbing a scrap of parchment and borrowing a quill.
"It'll be fine. If we get caught, just say you got lost. It's a big castle." Draco didn't seem too happy with that response, but he stopped complaining.
“Well, Potter, I was going to give you some help for your headaches, but clearly you don’t want any.” Harry looked up and turned.
"Dunno. I just made it up and hoped it worked," replied Harry. Draco looked at him in disbelief. "It's just Latin," said Harry, feeling embarrassed.
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work in alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.
"Where did you get this?" Sherlock asked. Harry didn't know what he was talking about, so he shrugged. "The scar, on your forehead." Harry still had no idea what Sherlock was referring to and told him just that. Sherlock frowned. Most children, even two-year-olds, would notice something like that. Unless there was something impairing his vision.
"Where to?" asked the cabbie in a strong northern accent.
"You're a smart boy," said Griphook.
"How's your room, Harry?" he asked.
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
"Hello?" called Harry, his eyes scanning the stacks of thin boxes behind the counter. A man with silver hair and unblinking, grey eyes appeared behind the counter.
For I'm a Thinking Cap!'
"Scotland Yard, please." The cabbie nodded and drove off. Harry sat in the back, silently wondering why anyone would want to do this to him and his family.
"Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.," Harry said, reading the gold lettering above the door. "2403 years ago." He pushed the door open and stepped inside the dim shop. The shop appeared empty.
"Hey there." The kid looked up at the sound of an unfamiliar voice. He saw the blurry outline of a man. He had told the Dursley's that everything was blurry, but they said it was because he was always crying. He had accepted that there didn't seem to be any other explanation.
anyway. this is goodbye
*  *  *
Harry could now see the head table properly and began to deduct what he could about each of the teachers. A lot of them did not want to be there, a few of them looked bored out of their minds. None of them were overly suspicious, though there was one with a turban who seemed way too nervous and another with greasy black hair that glanced at Harry with such a look of hatred Harry had a feeling the teacher would let him die without a second thought. Harry shivered slightly and went back to watching the Sorting Ceremony. There were only two kids left, a Ravenclaw, a Gryffindor, and a Slytherin who greeted Draco as a friend, but eyed Harry wearily when he sat down.
"Kings Cross, please," replied John. The cabbie nodded and they drove off towards the station.
"Are you ready to go, Harry?" asked John after his son had finished his cup of coffee. Harry nodded, feeling nervous.
Thank you guys! :)
They didn't do much for the rest of the day. They were all feeling tired and anxious. Harry tried not to think about the letters, but he hadn't had enough time to grab any other games, and he'd already finished Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. He decided to restart and do the Nuzlocke challenge. He found it quite easy. He had already memorized all the stats for every single Pokemon and had uncovered a few easter eggs that helped him out quite a bit.
Where those of wit and learning,
Vault 713 has always been an interesting one. The first owner was found dead inside the vault after attempting to enter it without a registered goblin a few years before. This was the first of many wizards and witches who would suffer while using this vault.
Dear Mr. Potter,
“You look like you’ve been through hell and back,” said Draco. Harry rubbed his eyes and yawned again.
"He also wanted to send me back to the Dursleys, the people that starved me and locked me in a cupboard when I was three," said Harry. Fred and George looked at him in disbelief, but Draco only shook his head, disappointed.
"Hey, Dad, is John going to be my other dad?" He asked. Both men went bright red.
There's nothing hidden in your head
Once he was sure it was safe, Harry led the others silently across the hall, unlocking Dumbledore’s door and opening it silently.
And I can cap them all.
After an hour of tossing and turning, Harry sat up and turned his DS back on. He was pretty close to finishing the game, again. The one issue with having a Mind Palace with an entire floor dedicated to Pokemon meant he could complete all the games pretty quickly. He knew every route, every battle statistic, all the Gym leaders' pokemon and how to defeat them.
The tables were laden with breakfast foods and drinks. Harry saw a pot of coffee and was pleased to find it was actually not instant. He poured himself a cup, then piled his plate high with pancakes and waffles, then drowned them in syrup. He also grabbed a glass of orange juice then sat in an empty table in the back corner of the room.
In an effort to distract himself from the shaking, Harry made a cup of English Breakfast Tea, then two more to give to Sherlock and John.
"We don't teach maths, only arithmancy." Sherlock and John looked rather surprised. Harry was too, though he was distracted by a passing witch talking about potions and said nothing.
"Well, there was this one crazy case where these guys came in claiming that their comic books were coming true-" Harry launched into the story of what John had dubbed 'The Geek Interpreter'. While there was very little illegal activity and no dead bodies, it had been a most interesting case.
"We'll start with your uniform. Madam Malkin's it right over there, but I think I might get a drink. I'm not the biggest fan of those carts," said McGonagall. Harry nodded and the witch walked off. Sherlock and John followed her, leaving Harry alone in the street. He smiled, the money bag heavy in his pocket as he raced over to the shop.
"It'll be fine, Dad," said Harry. Sherlock did not look reassured, but trusted that the goblin would not endanger them. It was clear that all goblins hated wizards, but Sherlock could tell that Griphook was not going to put them in harm's way unnecessarily.
"What spell is that?" asked Draco.
“Who was that?” asked Hermione.
Harry looked at the letter, confused. He didn’t have a dad, and who was Sherlock? Was that the same person Fawn was talking about in his dream, all those weeks ago?
The entrance was dusty and plain, no signs of forced entry. Sherlock walked through, taking in every detail. Harry followed close behind him, much more nervous that he usually was. He almost screamed when Fred and George came up behind him.
Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.
"New students," exclaimed the Fat Frair, smiling at all of them. "About to be sorted, I suppose?"
"Because, as I said, the Dursleys were not fit to take up the job. And his name is Harry Holmes," Sherlock said. "Now, I would like to know why you, an animal lover from Scotland who most likely lives in a small wooden cottage on the edge of a forest, have broken down my brother's front door in the middle of the night. I would also like to know who you are."
“That’s gross,” said Harry, chucking the dead frog out of the window. It landed in a passing garbage truck.
"I'm going to the library," he said, turning on his heel and walking quickly away from Draco. It took a few seconds for the blond to notice his friend had gone, but once he did he sprinted after him.
"Right, have you got your ticket?" asked Sherlock. Harry nodded and pulled out the piece of paper.
When the train pulled into Hogsmead station, the sun had set and the night was beginning to cool down. Students were rushing onto the platform, glad to be out of the confinements of the train. Harry and Hermione were so wrapped up in their discussions they didn't even notice until Draco clapped loudly to get their attention.
“Sherlock? Like, Sherlock Holmes?” asked Hermione, reading the letter over his shoulder. “How do you know him?”
"No," said Harry. The barman looked crestfallen. Harry looked at him, confused. Who would be that eagre to know him? He was just some kid.
Harry shivered slightly. He had been in his fair share of banks, most of which had been robbed the day before, but none had given off such an aura of menace. Harry could tell they were hiding more than money down there, and he was going to find out what else was down there, but that would have to wait, as McGonagall had pushed open the door and was waiting for Harry to join her inside the bank.
"Can anything impress you?" said Harry through a laugh. Draco smirked and shook his head.
"Are you sure you're alright?" asked Draco as Harry once again raised his hand to his scar.
sorry it’s been so long. exams on top of more pressing work, and my own personal things took up far more time than i would’ve liked. I’m far from out of it though. I’ve got a couple more weeks of very little free time, and then, if i’m not burnt out entirely by that point, we’ll see how it goes
Harry looked at her and did a few quick deductions. She was a teacher and had been for a long time. She was also a deputy headmistress. Harry remembered the letter.
"More interesting than anything else," replied Harry as the horse-like things began to pull the carriages away. Harry watched them until they turned a corner and dropped out of sight. In all the books he had read, there had been no mention of any creatures matching that description. Harry made a note to ask one of the teachers when he got the chance.
“You should ask Madam Pomfrey for a sleeping draught. One of those dreamless ones,” said Ron, seemingly having appeared from nowhere. Harry jumped slightly before nodding.
"DAD! DAD!" he yelled. Sherlock and John sprinted into the room, then stopped when they saw the letters. John grabbed Harry's arm and pulled him out of the room.
There were another two hits and the door broke in two. Standing in the doorway was a massive figure. It took a moment for Harry to register what he was seeing as the man was so large.
"Molly," he hesitated, "he also might need glasses." Molly nodded. "And, thank you."
"Yeah. It was just my life," replied Harry, wishing that the case he was on at that moment had more evidence. Then he had an idea.
"I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"Sure," replied Harry.
“And I never thought I would be friends with a Slytherin,” said George. Draco smiled and relaxed slightly, fiddling with one of his gifts.
thank you so much, honestly, for sticking around. you have no idea how much it means to me to see people reading and enjoying what i write, no matter how awful it seems to me. it’s a massive help in keeping this story going, and where would a writer be without their readers?
"The ... Um ... Door. It won't stay closed," he said. Sherlock held out his hand for the key and Mr Dursley slowly placed it in his palm. Sherlock unlocked the door and was appalled to see a young child, no more than three, huddled up in the corner, hugging himself and crying. Sherlock turned around and punched Mr Dursley in the face. Mr Dursley cried out in pain and Greg Lestrade ran inside.
Another thing that concerned the three of them was Albus Dumbledore. The old man had a few too many secrets and an uncanny knowledge of Harry's life. Just about every week, Harry would be called into the Headmaster's office. Each time, they barely spoke, but Harry always left with a splitting headache.
"Good doggy," he said softly, trying to recall everything he knew about three-headed dogs. It wasn't a lot. One thing that did stick out was that they liked music.
"I think so. I guess we'll find out tonight."
Even though he’d never attended a full lesson, Harry’s potion skills were incredible. He credited the immense amount of chemistry he’d done as a child and the hours spent reading potion books. Harry had made a few adjustments to the tracking potion, not only making it faster to brew, but also to make the pin adjust every single time the headmaster moved, allowing a sort of gps to be on him at all times. Harry also filled it with spells to override any anti-tracking spells that the headmaster might have thought of.
"You're Harry Potter?" said Draco incredulously. "Do you have the scar?" Harry nodded, really wanting to know why he was famous.
"Platform nine and three quarters, located in the barrier between platforms nine and ten," said Harry, thinking they probably should've written that on the ticket.
“Honestly, not your best joke, Fred,” said George, cracking a smile. Fred smiled back, mirroring his twin exactly. Draco sighed and turned to Sherlock and John.
"How can she run so fast?" asked Draco as he leaned on the door to the Ravenclaw common room.
"How long until I can go home with you?" He asked. Sherlock picked up the diagnostics sheet and read over it. While Harry was still malnourished, there was no reason for him to stay in the hospital much longer. Sherlock was planning to pick up the stuff from IKEA later that day, but he saw no reason why he couldn't go earlier.
Everyone relaxed slightly. As much as Sherlock looked down on the police, he knew that they could help him.
"Who do you reckon is sending the letters?" asked Harry.
Professor McGonagall reached the front of the Hall and placed down a three-legged stool and a dirty wizard's hat. Harry looked at it closely, as did everyone else in the hall. It was covered in dirt and patches, with a few tears here and there.
"Come on, Mr Holmes. There is still the other vault for you to see," Griphook said. Harry nodded and hurried out the door. It slammed shut behind him and Griphook locked it before climbing back into the cart.
The common room was pretty empty, only a few older students were hanging around. The giant squid was visible in the lake. Harry looked at it for only a few seconds before walking out of the common room and into the dungeon hallway. He pulled his robes tighter around him, glad that the uniform was well-suited for living in a castle.
“What plan?” he asked. Dumbledore refused to reply. “WHAT FUCKING PLAN?!” Harry said the spell again, sending Dumbledore to the ground, writhing in agony, but still said nothing. Harry kicked him in the ribs, his leather school shoes breaking the old man’s rib with a loud crack. “WHAT FUCKING PLAN GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE AWAY MY FAMILY!?” Harry kicked him again, rage filling his every nerve as he looked down on the headmaster.
By the time they finished breakfast, Harry was shaking so hard he had to clench every muscle in his boy just to walk to the lift. Sherlock looked at him, slightly worried, but John didn't pick up on it, unsurprisingly. Harry had always found it funny that even after living with Sherlock for years, John struggled with the simplest of deductions.
Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
"How about I take a small trip to grab some stuff, then pick you up this afternoon and you come home then?" he asked Harry. Harry smiled and nodded enthusiastically. Sherlock laughed and told one of the nurses he would be back soon. Then he walked out of the hospital and hailed a taxi. Though not overly happy at the prospect of going all the way to IKEA and waiting around, the cabbie soon obliged when Sherlock shoved a hundred quid into his hand.
"No problem," replied Harry before going back to eating his waffles. John looked at his son's empty coffee cup disapprovingly.
So try me on and I will tell you
Sherlock sighed. If a child was going to live there, it would need to be cleaned up. He began tidying and soon found a rhythm.  Only an hour later, the flat was cleaner than he'd ever seen it. Sherlock sat cross-legged on the bed, pleased with his work. He had never been a huge fan of children but raising one of his own excited him. He would teach Harry everything he knew. New experiences were rare, and life was short.
The next day, Harry woke to the smell of frying eggs and bacon. He got up quickly and washed his hands before sitting at the small table. A plate of food was placed in front of him. A full English Breakfast. It was slightly burnt in places, but Sherlock was still only just getting the hang of cooking, so Harry ate it without complaint.
"You're all done, dear," said Madam Malkin to Draco. The boy hopped off the stool.
"It's Holmes, actually," said Harry.
Thanks so much for 107 kudos! This is so insane!
"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a place of immense secrecy," read Sherlock from Mycroft's text. "Every year, twenty or so children that have been signed up for secondary schools will be taken off the register with no explanation. Before this happens, parents will often report being sent hundreds of letters from this mysterious school. That was all I could find. Any details about the school itself are for the Prime Minister's eyes only." Sherlock sighed.
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.
yeah, i just can't do it anymore
"Well," said John, "I best be off. I think I'll see you tomorrow."
"Your hu- very well. As you can probably guess, I am here from Hogwarts. The headmaster would like to know why you sent Hagrid back, and whether or not Harry would be starting term with us."
"Well, it could be the Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw, the Deathstick, the Resurrection Stone, the Philosopher's Stone, any number of lost wands, honestly, there are so many cursed or enchanted or magical objects in the world that could be hidden here, it's impossible to narrow it down," he said, sounding defeated.
(See the end of the chapter for
The group of first years began to move away from the station, led by Hagrid. They walked through a dense patch of trees, a few people slipping on the gravel path.
Harry woke with sun streaming on his face. He had just had the most interesting dream. Then he felt the unfamiliar quilt and silk sheets. He put his glasses on and looked around. He was at Mycroft's home, but that didn't mean the events of his dream were true. They just happened to be set here.
While Harry certainly wasn't unintelligent - how could you be with Sherlock Holmes for a father? - he still struggled with the work. Magic went against just about everything he knew about the world, and it annoyed him. Science was the basis of so much of his world view, and magic just chucked it out the window.
“And they’re all going to fit in our flat, how?” asked John.
“You’re off this case,” said John.
“We’re shopping with muggles?” said Draco in disgust.
“Why can’t you take a hint, Malfoy?! Just piss off and leave me and my friends alone! God, I hate you so much. Piss the fuck off!” Harry realised a moment too late that he’d been telling. Hundreds of eyes burned into his back as he glared at Malfoy.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." Her eyes lingered on Neville's cloak, which was clasped under his ear. Draco smoothed his flawless hair back nervously.
"This is where we part. Here's your ticket," McGonagall handed Harry an envelope. "To get through to the platform, walk quickly through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. And run if you're scared." Harry thanked her and said goodbye, then followed Sherlock to a staircase.
"I'm adopted," said Harry. "My old family name is Potter." This made both Madam Malkin and Draco gasp.
"Bored," he whispered to himself. He smiled, but it was replaced immediately with a feeling of sadness. He missed Sherlock and John so much. He'd never been away from his fathers for so long. After thinking for a moment, he reached into his trunk and grabbed a few sheets of paper and a pen.
"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."
"Okay. You guys try and find a place to stay, and we'll send some officers to inspect your flat." He grabbed his phone and began calling officers together. John pulled out his phone and began looking for hotels with vacancies. He found one and booked a room, then the three Holmes left the building and hailed a taxi.
“Eventually, the spells ended, and Sherlock and I went into the room. Both aurors were knocked out on the floor. The murderer smiled before turning on his heel. Sensing what he was about to do, Sherlock jumped forwards and grabbed onto his arm, disappearing with the wizard.
"If you're not Dursley, then who are ye?"
From that day on, a new routine was formed. Every day, Harry would get up and watch some TV, then Sherlock would come and teach him all about the world, maths, English, and every other subject that came to mind. The one that they spent the most time on was chemistry. Then they would go on a case and Harry would try to solve it first, only asking if he was truly stuck. Then Sherlock would go over his deductions and point out any mistakes. Then they would go home and John would fill in the gaps of Sherlock's schooling with online courses. After that, the three of them would go through London. Harry would be searching for new friends, which rarely happened, and Sherlock and John would become closer.
“Why all the dead people?” asked Draco, gesturing to a group of pictures with blurred out blood.
"Why'd you have to run?" asked Draco between gasps.
Sherlock's phone started ringing again.

“I think it’s best you five got to bed,” said John, checking his watch. Everyone nodded and slowly made their way to bed, yawning and dragging their feet.
"Do you know any other spells?" Draco asked.
"I just wanted to make sure you weren't poking your nose in places it doesn't belong. I would hate to have to send you back to the Dursleys," said Dumbledore. Harry saw a glint in his eye and his brow crease in concentration. Harry immediately threw up walls around his mind, concentrating to push out the invader.
"I think I'm gonna head back to the common rooms." Harry stood up, one hand still pressed to his forehead and started walking out of the room. He was stopped by none other than Dumbledore.
Many tears were shed that day, by Harry, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Molly Hooper and her new boyfriend, Jim, and the grooms themselves. Even Mycroft looked as if he might smile. The loudest sniffles were from the Holmes parents. Quite the opposite from their cold children, the Holmes parents were two of the happiest and emotional people Harry had ever met. It was quite funny.
"Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favoured it – it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course."
Harry and Draco hurried into the great hall, sitting opposite Hermione at the Ravenclaw table.
"That's quite enough, my boy," said Dumbledore, chuckling once again. Harry scowled at him and slipped his wand out of his pocket, whispering a spell.
They were sleeping when he opened the door to their room. He put the cups of tea down and woke them by saying their names gently.
Sorry, this took so long and that it's so short. I rewrote this chapter several times, stuff happened and I wrote less often. And if stuff doesn't make sense, point it out. I wrote most of this in the middle of the night.
"You can call me whatever you want."
“Alright, but my dads are gonna be asleep for the rest of the day, so we’ll have to go alone,” said Harry as he picked up his wallet. Mycroft had been giving him over a hundred pounds every month since he’d been adopted, but hadn’t given him access until only a few months before. He also grabbed his bag full of wizarding money in case they went to Diagon Alley.
A massive, three-headed dog stood over them. It looked startled by their sudden appearance, and Harry knew it was the only reason they were still alive.
“No reason,” said Harry, picking up a few pictures that had fallen off his walls while he was gone. “Anyway, what do you guys wanna-” he was interrupted by John knocking on the door.
“Scotland Yard,” replied Sherlock. Harry looked around and saw that his father was right. They had landed right in the foyer, very much to the surprise of the police officers walking by. Lestrade ignored them and marched a disgruntled Dumbledore into a holding cell that McGonagall quickly secured with a few dozen spells.
When John walked in to check on him, Harry was deciding whether or not to take his revolver. He finally settled on leaving it behind. If he was going to be attacked, something he hoped wouldn't happen, he would just use his wand.
"Can I-" Draco's hand was hovering over a chocolate frog. Harry nodded and inspected a packet of Bertie Bot's Every Flavour Beans, opening it cautiously and picking one out.
“I’m sorry. I’ll make sure Dumbledore pays for this,” said Harry, a steely glint in his eye.
Also, thank you guys so much for 209 kudos! You're all awesome.
The three of them arrived at the library and began their research. Hermione scanned the shelves carefully, picking up only books that looked useful, Draco grabbed them at random, and Harry edged his way over to the restricted section.
"Firs'-years! Firs'-years! Over here!" Rubeus Hagrid yelled. The massive man towered over everyone on the platform, a sort of beacon for those that had never set foot in this station before.
A few minutes later, John and Sherlock came down, hand in hand. They each grabbed a plate of toast and a cup of coffee.
I know I promised a long chapter, but this is too long even by my standards. This is what happens when you don't have a life.
Finally, the day arrived and Harry was able to go home. He practically sprinted to the train, his friends following close behind.
When they reached the Hospital Wing, McGonagall quickly explained everything to a confused Madam Pomfrey. The moment she realised what had happened, she healed Dumbledore and conjured some handcuffs which she then handed to Lestrade. Dumbledore stood up and turned on his heel as if trying to dissipate, but a frown appeared on his face when he realised he could.
He’d asked Hermione about it, and she’d said it was probably from a movie or something. Harry had agreed, at the time, but he’d never really watched movies. The Dursleys hadn’t let him. Though something about the Dursleys felt off too.
"What are you going to do with him? He's been removed from the Dursley's custody." Lestrade was unsure what Sherlock was going to say. What he defiantly wasn't expecting was Sherlock saying;
“We’re going to the scene. It’s a murder. Do you want to come?” John asked. Harry nodded and grabbed his gun from under his mattress. He put on his holster and covered it with a hoodie.
There were dozens of colourful shopfronts, all of them adorned with enchanted decorations floating or dancing to attract customers. The customers themselves were just as interesting, all of them wearing long robes that brushed along the cobbled pavement. A lot of them had large hats that looked like something you would find in a costume shop.
“Onto Diagon Alley,” declared Fred, marching ahead of the rest towards the leaky cauldron. A few people looked at them oddly as they strolled through the streets, but they didn’t care.
It took a lot longer for the cart to stop, but once it did, Griphook grabbed the clankers and handed them out.
Harry 's first class was Charms, it was quite fun, but he missed a homework assignment. In spite of that, Professor Flitwick did nothing but praise him. It was unbelievably frustrating.
*  *  *
"Hurry up, Harry," Sherlock said, his voice wavering slightly. Harry turned to see that the rest of them had reached the other end of the cave and were waiting for him. He sprinted after them, turning back at the last second, vowing to save the dragon, even if it took him years.
Harry checked his pocket for Dumbledore’s wand countless times over the course of the day, not trusting that the headmaster would be unable to get it back. He considered breaking it a couple times, but couldn’t remember if it was legal or not. Eventually, he decided against it and just kept the wand in his hand.
Draco didn't say much for a while, instead deciding to stare out of the window. Harry chose this time to grab a book out of his trunks and starts reading. The two remained in a comfortable silence until the compartment door was slammed open and a bushy haired girl with large teeth and her brand new Hogwarts robes on stepped in. Harry looked her over. She was eleven, a first year, and magic was completely new to her. She was also smart, right-handed, and almost always reading.
"My full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes."
"It was one time," he said, raising his hands in defence, "and we made a deal Harry." Harry smirked and got up to grab another cup of coffee.
Everyone finished singing at different times. At last, only a set of red-headed twins were left, singing a slow, funeral march. Dumbledore conducted the last few lines with his wins, then once the twins were finished, he was the one who clapped the loudest.
"Is that 'Arry Potter?" he asked, leaning over the bar to get a better look.
I'll eat myself if you can find
Sorry for the late update, and for how bad the chapter is. I managed to forget about this for a week because I closed the tab.
The only thing he could be sure of was that his meal-time headaches had started again. What caused them remained a mystery, as did why they stopped for around half the year.
(See the end of the chapter for
John and Sherlock came in a few moments later, sitting down on their respective chairs.
"Yeah. Do you know why I'm famous?" Harry asked, knowing it was a stupid question, but needing the answer. Draco nodded.
Anyway, thank you to everyone that's read this far. You're all awesome!
Thank you so much to everyone that has read it! You're all awesome! And any suggestions on what should happen would be great! (I have some vague ideas that can't be implemented at the moment)
"What did he want?" asked Draco as Harry left the office. He, Hermione, Fred, and George had followed slightly behind Harry.
"The colour doesn't mean anything," explained Harry. "It's just what your wand core is." Draco studied his wand closely then tried casting a spell.
"First-years should note that the forest in the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. A few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
The three of them started walking to the library, trying to figure out what could be hidden.
“Bye,” said Harry sadly to an empty staircase.
His suit was already out, hanging on the door of his wardrobe, his freshly shined shoes beside them. The thought of putting them on, going into court, and risking Dumbledore being freed made him sick to his stomach, but he forced the feeling down, deciding to deal with it later, and got changed, anxiously adjusting his tie before heading back downstairs.
"Because you're never going to see them again." The look of joy was so absolute on the little boys face, it made Sherlock himself want to smile.
Snape paired each of them up. Harry was paired with Draco, something both of them were happy about. It turned out that Draco was quite good at potions. Things seemed to improve for Harry once the lesson began properly, but he saw that Snape would take every opportunity to pick on and insult the Gryffindors.
"Do you want us to say goodbye now and let you find some friends, or stay here 'till you have to board?" asked John. Harry turned to look at his parents and thought for a moment before running to both of them and hugging them tight.
Mr Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well … how curious … how very curious …" He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious … curious …"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had also been plagued by nightmares. Dead bodies and crime scenes littered his sleeping mind, as did an odd-looking flat, the walls covered in newspaper clippings and a Cluedo board underneath a large mirror. There were other things in the flat too, things that might be ordinary alone, but together, were just a bit off. Harry couldn’t figure out what these things were, as dreams were always difficult to remember. For some reason, everything in his dreams was extremely familiar, even though he knew they were all made up by his imagination.
“Bold of you to assume I paid attention to any classes last year, least of all History of Magic,” said George. Hermione sighed.
"RAVENCLAW" shouted the hat.
"Okay... Dad," said Harry.
"Who are you?" asked Sherlock. His voice and hands were shaking. "You're trespassing on private property. I will warn you, I am armed!"
"Well," he said, "you don't have to go. I can homeschool you, then you can come on cases with me. You can do other things to make friends." Harry's face lit up immediately.
Harry folded the letters and shoved them in an envelope, then left the dormitory, heading up to the owlery.
Suddenly, Harry’s feet slammed into the ground. He let go of the kettle and stumbled, trying to regain his balance. There were a few groans and a crash behind him. It seemed the others were unable to stay standing.
"Not those imbecile muggles, your real father, James Potter!" There were many gasps around the room. Harry could feel all the students staring at him, but he didn't look away from Snape.
"It could be You Know Who," whispered Fred.
"Good morning, Harry," said Sherlock as the young boy woke. There was a flicker of panic in the boy's face when he couldn't recognize anything, then he looked at Sherlock and relaxed.
The grand ceiling was dozens of meters above them, and just like the walls and the outside, it was a snow-white marble. A massive chandelier hung from the ceiling, lighting up the long desks that ran along the walls. Behind each of them was a strange creature. They looked a bit like humans, except they were very short with wrinkled skin and long noses. Lots of them were counting coins or examining large jewels that were dwarfed by their long, spindly fingers.

shit happens and stuff, and it's not like i don't think all of you are awesome for reading it, but i rlly gotta wonder why you got this far,, it's a bad story.
“It’s awesome,” said Harry, slightly out of breath. He looked out the window briefly and saw a woman at the front door, looking hesitant. “Client,” he said, going back down the stairs to open the door. Just as the doorbell rang, Harry opened the door and invited the client inside.
"I'm not going to hurt you, Harry," he said. The boy looked up, a tear sliding down his cheek.
Harry finished the meal quickly and sighed happily.
Draco took a long time to respond, standing there, thinking.
Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,
"You know, hiding or suppressing your emotions has been shown to reduce mental health," said Harry. Draco's mask slipped.
"I'm not supposed ter do magic, 'specially not in fron' of muggles, but I guess you're not gonna let him go if I don'," Hagrid sighed and raised his pink umbrella, pointing it at an innocent vase. He muttered something under his breath, and the vase exploded.
"What do you keep in here?" He asked, knowing that Mr Dursley wasn't going to tell him the truth.
Harry wasn't too happy about being called out, but answered the question quickly.
"Cool," said Harry, examining the remains of the vase. He looked at his fathers. "Can I go?" he asked.
“Right then,” he said, strolling towards the building, one hand on his badge, the other hovering over his gun. Harry raced after him, wand hidden in his pocket, but dozens of spells racing through his mind. Lestrade burst through the door into the lobby, startling the elderly receptionist. He brandished his badge and warrant before demanding to know who had entered in the past day.
“The basement one’s empty, right? I’m pretty sure parts of it are furnished already.” John nodded and the seven of them left the station and hailed a couple of taxis. For Sherlock’s sake, Fred and George drove with John, though they still pestered the poor man with hundreds of questions on the long journey to 221b Baker Street.
*  *  *
"Sorry,’ said Harry, "but what’s curious?"
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
After about a month of this, Harry did the only logical thing. He sat them both down on the sofa as if they were clients, and began to talk to them.
"I wish I had a cool name like that."
Then something happened that almost took his mind off of his nervousness. Several pearly-white figures were floating into the room, through the walls and ceiling. Just about everyone gasped, there were even a few screams. The figures glided across the room, talking to each other and ignoring the students below them. They seemed to be arguing.
"I will free you," he said to the dragon. It tilted its head slightly, as if it understood him.
I also think that I should stop posting at 1 am.
There was a knock on the door. A tearful looking boy poked his round face into the compartment.
"I'm fine Professor. I just have homework to do." Harry tried to walk past him, but Dumbledore subtly blocked his path.  "I've really got to go," said Harry, ducking under Dumbledore's arm and making a break for the door. Dumbledore didn't pursue him, but Harry didn't bother slowing down. He sprinted down the many stairs into the dungeons, stopping only when he was outside the common room. He caught his breath before saying the password and stepping inside.
"That's what Uncle said." The boy's voice was little more than a whisper.
"Me too. See ya later, 'Mione." Hermione nodded as Harry left the library and followed Draco.
When Neville was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted "GRYFFINDOR", Neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag".
An hour later, he was halfway through the book and had a rather in-depth knowledge of occulemency and legilimency. It took a few more hours for him to fully understand every aspect of it. He got out several books so that he could begin learning occulemency that night.
"I will arrange a car for you," said Mycroft, leaving the room.
“Five to central London, please,” said George, also offering his hand. Stan shook them both awkwardly before announcing the price and, after Harry paid, welcomed them on board.
"Freak!" He heard someone yell on the other side of the door. The name made him shudder. Freak was a name he was only too used to. "You can't do anything! Stupid child!" This confirmed Sherlock's suspicions, the Dursley's would never speak to their son that way. That meant there was another child in the house. He knocked on the door.
"About time you got some," said Draco's mother, patting her son's shoulder affectionately. Draco turned back to smile at Harry, then let his parents walk him out of Diagon Alley.
“What have you done?” Harry turned and looked at Professor M, standing next to Sherlock, John, Mycroft, Lestrade, and Draco.
"No, I suppose not," replied Draco.
It was far emptier than it had been the first time Harry had been there, but quite a few people recognised him. He dodged most of them, but a few had to be hit with a small spell to make them go away.
"I'm sorry, Harry," said Neville as he climbed to his feet.
*  *  *
There was a grand gravel driveway fringed with a traditional English wood. Where the wood ended, there was a massive lawn with a hedge maze and statues all around. The driveway split and went around a large fountain made of white marble. The Manor itself was three stories tall, made of red brick and covered in ivy. Harry could tell that each branch of the vine had been perfectly guided to give the nicest possible result. The dozens of windows were all in perfect condition and there was not a shingle was out of place and there was a small amount of smoke coming out of every chimney.
i doubt anyone here was seriously invested, as slowly they story has gotten worse and less believable (the most in character part taken from the bbc sherlock series)
The professor pulled out a roll of parchment and began taking the register. When Harry's name was called, there was a moment of hesitation before the professor moved onto the next person. Harry was slightly thankful that he hadn't said Potter. It seemed that his old name would give him nothing but trouble.
Harry had never been to London before. All the sights and sounds were awesome, if slightly overwhelming. When they went on the London Eye, they got a pod to themselves. Harry stood right up against the glass, staring, awestruck, at the city below. They went higher and higher and Harry looked at everything. He ran around the pod, looking at all the views of London city.
"Griphook!" he called over his shoulder. Another goblin appeared, this one quite a bit younger with black hair. "Take these four to the Potter vault, then to the Holmes vault. You'll need the clankers." Griphook nodded and grabbed a box of funny-looking bells then led them to a door at the very back of the hallway. The goblin pushed it open and led the four into a dark, stone hallway lit with flaming torches on the wall.
"Well," said Harry, "until you can get over your grudge with a dead man, you are not going to be able to give me an adequate education, so I don't think I'll continue this class." Harry shoved his quill back into his bag and walked out of the classroom, down the hall, and into the corridor that held the Slytherin common rooms. He stood outside the concealed door for a while before turning on his heel and walking to the library. This seemed as good of a time as any to work on his homework.
“Where are we?’ asked John.
Once Harry had finished, Sherlock had the plate taken away.
“So, what brings you here?” John began as Harry left the room and led his friends to his room.
"Yeah, but it's hiding something, so there's a mystery. That's the awesome part," replied Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Guys, you can’t do that. It’s an actual murder scene,” he hissed angrily. Fred and George apologised, both looking guilty. Harry sighed and continued walking, his hand on his gun.
(See the end of the chapter for
The front of his trolley collided with the barrier and Harry expected to crash. Instead, the trolley passed through the wall as if it wasn't there. The rest of him followed. Harry squeezed his eyes shut when the brick was inches from his face, but forced himself to open them when there was no collision. The sight that greeted him was incredible.
Harry looked up at the front of the class, hoping to thank whoever scared away the kids, but the face he saw was filled with such hatred, the words died in his mouth. At the front of the class stood the greasy-haired teacher from the welcome feast.
"Woah indeed," said Sherlock from behind him.
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
"Sleep now," Sherlock said softly. The boy happily complied, falling into a deep slumber within minutes. Sherlock then brought out his phone and dialled a number.
"What is your problem with me? I've never met you before in my life, yet you hate me! Why!" Harry cried.
“Do you wanna head into London for presents and such?” asked Hermione.
When dinner ended, Mycroft left to his study. John, Sherlock, and Harry moved to a living room and watched TV together like they did most nights. None of them spoke of magic or letters. The only thing that was said were Sherlock's comments about the shows they were watching.
"Wizards are old-fashioned. I'm sure it'll sort itself out one day. You're a very difficult person. An incredibly sharp mind, Plenty of courage, I see. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting ... So where shall I put you?"
"All of it. I was just around the corner." John and Sherlock quickly stood up and enveloped the boy in a warm hug. "I'm fine," he said, pulling away. "I don't really care what that guy says." He was lying and everyone knew it, but they let go anyway.
"Dammit," yelled Harry. The rest of the page was covered in a giant inkblot. Harry sighed in defeat and shoved the book back into a shelf.
Even with his wand shining a bright light into the hole in the floor, he couldn't see the bottom. There was no ladder, and he didn't want to risk breaking a leg, so Harry closed the trapdoor and sat on top of it, wishing he knew just a few more spells.
"Well then, I think we should wake up Hagrid and give our guest some breakfast," Mycroft said, leading Harry into the sitting room where Hagrid was snoring. "Excuse me, sir," said Mycroft softly. The giant man stopped snoring and opened his eyes slightly. His face was filled with confusion, then his beetle-black eyes settled on Harry and smiled.
"Slytherin would be nice," said Harry.
Mycroft told his brother all he had found and also asked him if he thought adoption was really the right choice. Sherlock, of course, told Mycroft that he could do what he liked, besides, Mrs Hudson could help out.
"How have you been, Harry?" Dumbledore asked as Harry walked in. "Is Slytherin treating you well, or do you want to transfer?"
"Yes, I am. I'm Draco Malfoy. What's your last name?"
The week following Harry leaving the Hospital Wing was probably the weirdest one he’s had in a long time. For one thing, Ron kept on trying to talk to him about things that he was fairly sure never happened, and Malfoy kept on trying to talk to him, not insult him, just talk. If that wasn’t strange enough, Harry felt strangely guilty every time he insulted the blond git, as if the hate was unfounded. It wasn’t though, Harry was sure of it. He was sure there was a reason that they hated each other. If only he could remember it…
"I've already told you, the name is familiar, but I can't remember why," said Hermione exasperatedly. Hermione was going to say something more, but stopped when she saw two redheads approaching.
"You're very late, Weasley. Five points from Gryffindor." The boy opened his mouth to protest. "Speak and I make it ten," said the professor. The Weasley closed his mouth and sat down next to another Gryffindor.
This year so far has been a wild ride and I’ve had very little time to write, so I’m really sorry that you had to wait so long.
He stayed silent after his speech, letting the words sink in.
And thank you all so much for reading. Updates are slowing down because I suddenly lost all motivation to write this, hence the rewriting and editing.
"Why're you looking after Harry Potter?"
Eventually, he did.
Less than a minute later, Hagrid was on the ground, blood streaming from his nose and John being held back by both Sherlock and Mycroft.
While Sherlock taught Harry everything he would need to know academically, John taught him how to talk to people and how to be social. The one thing that Sherlock had taught him was too never say any deductions while at school. It would lead to nothing but insults, he had said. Harry couldn't figure out why, but that was something he knew better than to question.
*  *  *
"Mornin'. Listen, we found out something awesome last night," said Harry quickly.
"Excuse me, Madam Pince." The stern woman looked up from her book, eyeing Harry suspiciously. "I was wondering if you had any books on Occulemency?" Harry put on his best innocent eleven-year-old act. Madam Pince looked at him carefully, trying to find any evidence that the book Harry desired could be harmed. Upon finding nothing, she pointed him towards an empty isle near the restricted section.
Harry stayed behind to bid his dads goodnight before climbing upstairs and clambering over Draco, who was sleeping on a mattress on the floor of Harry’s room. The second his head hit the pillow, Harry fell into a deep dreamless sleep.
"But how would he get in undetected?" asked Harry. George was about to reply, but was interrupted by a nervous-looking first year.
*  *  *
"What is the difference, Holmes, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
"Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
"Trevor, I think."
"Here we are," said Harry as they came before the large wooden door. Harry checked that the hall was empty before whispering "alohomora". The door clicked open and they hurried inside, closing it softly behind them.
"I'm gonna be a wizard!" he said after a long rant about the friends he could make. Mycroft smiled at the boy's excitement, a rare sight.
The dog whined slightly in its sleep.
The foyer was rather sparsely decorated, nothing more than a few paintings and a coat stand. The rest of the house was quite similar. Mycroft was hardly one for sentimentality. The man himself was not there to greet him. In fact, Harry didn't see him until after they'd all been led to their rooms and dinner had been announced.
"Here you go," he said, giving the toad to the girl.
"Hey, Harry. Rough day?" Harry groaned in response. Sherlock sat down on the edge of the bed. "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked. Harry turned and sat up.
It was dim and loud, the only light reflecting off of the eyes of owls. Harry spent a while looking at all the different owls until he settled on a snowy white one.
"Maybe we're just slow," said Harry while he tried to get back his breath.
fuck guys, i'm really sorry, but i'm not writing this anymore
"I'll be a better guardian than the Dursley's." And this was a point that Mycroft could not disagree with. Sure, his brother was often cold and emotionless, but whenever he was around Harry, everything about him changed. He became like a regular human. Not a highly functioning sociopath as he put it.
The school started bellowing
"Granger, Hermione!" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
With some interesting stuff,
When the train finally slowed to a stop, Harry knew that Hermione was going to be one of his closest friends before the month was out.
When they reached the platforms, Harry took a deep breath before walking quickly toward the barrier. He wanted to speed up, but knew that he could risk losing control.
maybe once i get my degree i'll revisit it, but until then, say goodbye to the characters you probably didn't like and any dreams you had for the series
"Well, wizards aren't quite human," said Griphook coldly, glaring at McGonagall, as if expecting an argument. She said nothing and the four of them continued walking through the bank, passing vault after vault until they reached one that clearly hadn't been touched in years. Every single crevice in the iron door was coated in dust. Griphook raised a finger and stroked the centre of the door. It dissolved, revealing a vault that made the Potter's fortune look like spare change.
Even though every student was at a different level, they were all given the same tasks and the same help, though Harry saw that the better you were at the subject, the more attention you would get from the teacher.
"This place is quite small. Don't you want your own room?" Harry nodded. "I'm going down to the hospital today. I need to do some experiments. You're welcome to come, but you'll have to stay with Molly." Sherlock may have no issue with Harry solving crimes, but he would prefer it if the boy stayed away from the morgue for another few years. Harry agreed to come and they got ready to leave.
"Sherl, honey, relax," said John, "The police are going to sort it out. We'll be fine here."
Slowly, the seven of them moved down to the hospital wing, all of them asking dozens of questions, few of which could really be answered.
"I'm not sure. I can't see why anyone would do this. It doesn't make any sense," replied Sherlock.
A few hours later, Sherlock and Harry Holmes left the building and went to buy some celebratory ice cream. Harry told every person he met that he just got adopted. Everyone responded with smiles and congratulatory words, though a few often looked at Sherlock warily. He would grin in response and they would quickly move on.
Harry looked at it suspiciously, then carefully inspected it. He could see no signs that it was dangerous, but he didn't want to take any chances. Going into the kitchen, he grabbed his chemistry safety gear that he never used and pulled on some thick rubber gloves and safety goggles. He carefully broke the seal on the envelope and tipped the contents into his hand. Nothing bad happened, so he unfolded the letter and began to read it.
“This has been the best Christmas ever,” said Draco when they arrived back at the flat, all fairly tired. “It’s nice to be around people that actually care about you,” he said, sitting down on the couch. Harry looked at him sadly before sitting down beside him.
"Really Sherlock, just think about it. Do you really think you're the most suitable candidate for the boy's guardian?" Mycroft asked for what felt like the millionth time.
You can keep your bowlers black,
"Wh-what?" said John.
“Do I know you?” Harry asked, feeling like the person was familiar.
A few spells later, Draco's wand was also warded, though his glowed blue instead of gold.
"A sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death." Snape looked disappointed.
"Take him to the hospital wing," spat Snape at Seamus. Seamus grabbed Neville's arm and walked the whimpering boy out of the classroom.
“Can’t this train go any faster?” asked Fred, tapping his foot in impatience.
"And I you. Would you mind helping me get my trunk in here?" Harry nodded and the two of them left the car to grab Draco's trunk.
You're in safe hands
"I can see them too." Harry turned and saw Neville clutching his toad. "Not everyone can. They're pretty scary though."
I am currently editing chapter 16 because I hate it and I can't write chapter 17 because of that. I also fixed a few things in this chapter. Sorry.
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.
So if you seek beneath our floors
"Why is this castle so big?" he asked no one in particular when he sat puffing on his bed. He went through all of his pockets and his entire trunk before finally finding the small card. He flipped it over and read it, tucking all the information about Nicolas Flamel, the alchemist, in his mind palace. Once he had read it, he shoved the card in his pocket and went back to the library, finding as many books as he could on alchemy, before sitting in a small corner and reading. He stayed there until the sun set and the librarian yelled at him because the library was closed.
“Can you get us there?” he asked Professor McGonagall, wand clenched tightly in his hand. She came over and inspected the map before nodding and holding out her arm. “Lestrade and Sherlock,” said Harry before grabbing his teacher’s arm. Sherlock and Lestrade were quick to catch on and both grabbed McGonagall’s other arm. The second they were secure, McGonagall turned on her heel and the four of them began squeezing through space before arriving at the gravel driveway of Shieldhill Castle.
"Where am I going?" He asked.
Around an hour later, the younger Holmes's family were being driven through the grounds of Holmes House. House was quite an understatement, thought Harry.
"Yes, well, you didn't. Can we get to buying my wand please?" Harry was starting to get quite uncomfortable. This man was too close and he knew too much about Harry. Ollivander nodded and stepped back.
"Mycroft. So you've found out more about the school? What do you mean wizards? Are you quite sure? There's no such thing as magic, brother mine. I don't really care what the Prime Minister says, the man's crazy. Magic is impossible. Call me again when you find some real information." Sherlock hung up and flopped onto the sofa.
Harry heard the words of a fat monk. "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance-"
I should not be awake right now.
Sorry this took so long. I'm back at school and lockdown is over, so I've got a lot less time. Thank you for reading. :)
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilt potion away with a wave on his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"
“While Sherlock and I were still in the hallway, dozens of spells were fired, causing the entire house to light up. We waited patiently, both knowing that entering the room armed with only guns was a death sentence.
Enter, stranger, but take heed
"Harry, my boy, are you alright?" Harry quickly shoved his hands in his pockets, his right now holding tightly to his wand. He looked at the headmaster, figuring out pretty quickly that Dumbledore didn't really care about the answer. His concerned expression clashed with his sparkling eyes.
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"
"I'll wait outside," said McGonagall. Harry was just about to walk in when someone came out and bumped into his shoulder. They had bright green hair and were wearing a pure white hoodie, a black necklace with a silver ring, and black aviator sunglasses.
A few hours later, Harry was sitting on Sherlock's bed playing with his new glasses as Sherlock put together a bed. He had been trying for quite some time and had almost achieved his goal when he dropped a plank onto his toe. He swore. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry shrink back into a ball, covering his head with his arms. Sherlock immediately felt guilty.
Neville whimpered as boils began to pop up all his face.
"You're welcome, Sherlock." She said in an even voice. Then she left.
His laughter was cut short when Lestrade whipped out his taser and shot it at the headmaster. Dumbledore began shaking violently and slid off the chair onto the floor. Lestrade ran over, disarming the wizard and handcuffing him with the cuffs that both McGonagall and Harry had enchanted. Then McGonagall cast several more binding charms and stunned the professor.
Harry yawned and got up, grabbing a dressing gown as he left the room. He felt like he was in a hotel, there was nothing personal or homely about Mycroft's house. It was strangely sterile even though there was nothing that wasn't a priceless artefact that was at least a hundred years old.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Did Dad get in a fight?" asked Harry, putting his book away. Sherlock nodded, but didn't elaborate.
One day, I'll post on time. Until then, sorry
Hermione started whispering in his ear about just about every spell she had learnt, but most of the kids had never even used their wands, so Harry knew it wasn't going to be any kind of test, apart from maybe a personality quiz, but that seemed unlikely. Harry was starting to get more and more nervous. If there was one thing he couldn't stand, it was not knowing what was going on.
"Hiya," the first one said.
"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him ..."
Harry smiled. Vault 713 had come up more than a few times in the books he had been reading. He handed the letter over to Hermione then grabbed one of the books he had read - The Curious History of Gringotts - to refresh his memory.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
"We don't have all day," said Draco from behind him. Harry jumped slightly, not realising the boy had crept up behind him. He scolded himself slightly. He would not let his observation skills slip. Especially not in a place with so many secrets.
Mycroft Holmes, the eldest of the Holmes children, held a small position in the British Government. That is to say, he was the British Government.
“Draco!” he yelled. The blond turned, and was shocked when Harry ran into him, holding him in a tight embrace. “I’m so sorry for everything I said. My memories were all messed up. I thought you hated me.”
"I'm gonna go back to the room," said Harry. John and Sherlock nodded and said they'd see him later, then the doors closed and Harry immediately started to shake uncontrollably.
"Hello," said Harry. He seemed quite a bit happier than he had yesterday. Sherlock smiled at him and handed him a tray of food. The boy looked shocked and Sherlock's smile faltered.
"This is so cool," he said. "All of this is mine?" he asked Griphook. The goblin nodded.
(See the end of the chapter for
The day dawned and nothing unusual happened. Harry woke at a usual time and walked into the kitchen to see Sherlock making waffles and John arranging gifts on the table.
“How’d you beat a wizard?” Harry asked Sherlock.
"Why aren't you writing all this down?" he snapped at the class. Everyone grabbed their quills and began scribbling down everything that had been said.
Sherlock was already waiting in a taxi with the client. Hermione and Harry joined them, Draco, Fred, George, and John finding another.
Harry put down the letter and laughed. All this worry and it was just a prank. He chucked the letter into the bin and went back to watching TV.
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
"Morning, Mycroft," he said cheerily to the eldest Holmes. Mycroft said nothing, not even bothering to look up from his newspaper. Harry walked up to the table and saw a large range of cereal boxes and a jug of milk. He made himself a bowl of coco-pops but felt too excited to eat.
Dear Harry.
"See you later Dad, John," he said while hugging them. Then he sprinted back to meet up with the other kids. They were led into a large, colourful classroom and the day began.
As he watched the owl go, Harry felt as if he shouldn’t have sent it. Well, he couldn’t exactly stop it. It seemed odd that he would get that letter. As common as his name was, there weren’t any other Harrys at Hogwarts. Maybe the letter was meant for him, but he didn’t have a dad. That he was sure of. Right? Now that he thought about it, he wasn’t so sure. How could he remember calling someone Dad if he knew he’d grown up with the Dursleys? One of his memories was wrong, but the one with no proof felt so much more real. What had Fawn said? Just remember and the charm will be broken? It was something like that.
"Oh my god, Sherlock!" She quickly led them to the children's ward and Sherlock placed Harry down on an empty bed. Harry seemed reluctant to let go, but Sherlock told him that if he didn't, he wouldn't get better.
"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.
"S'pose you're right, Dursley," said the intruder.
"At least I don't smoke in hospitals," said Harry, looking pointedly at Sherlock. John looked at him, disappointed.
"Goodbye, guys. I'll miss you so much. I love you." Then he let go and pushed his trolley over to the train and started loading his trunk into a car. Drawn out goodbyes led to tears, Harry told himself as he struggled to lift the trunk. He looked behind him and saw John leaning on Sherlock, a few tears rolling down his face. Sherlock was doing his best to comfort his husband, but Harry could tell he was fighting off tears of his own.
"Hogwarts, dear?" she asked. Harry nodded. "Got the lot here - another young man being fitted just now, in fact."
"Thank you," said Harry. "But what exactly is Hogwarts?" he asked.
“You can bus home if you want,” said Harry harshly, looking down slightly on his friend.
As they walked past the cupboard under the stairs, Sherlock noticed that the door was regularly slammed and it had a padlock. He moved closer and heard a quiet sobbing coming from within.
Three days later, it was Christmas. Everyone, aside from Sherlock and John, were up bright and early, earlier than they would even get up for school. They waited for Sherlock and John by watching TV, something that utterly fascinated Draco, Fred, and George.
"Wait, like Sherlock Holmes?" asked the first, a look of awe forming on his face.
Draco nodded in understanding, then a grin crept onto his face.
Comments are highly appreciated, negative and positive feedback welcome.
"It's Holmes," corrected Harry. "Harry Holmes." Once again, Hagrid looked confused, but he said nothing. Instead, he sat up and began rummaging around in his massive coat until he pulled out a packet of raw sausages.
Mr H. Potter,
They were immediately met with the strong stench of alcohol. Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust and concentrated on the people milling around.
“I know you didn’t go straight home,” said Sherlock when he came into the room. “But, if you show me how to make the tracking potion, I won’t tell John.” Harry nodded and grabbed the potion ingredients and a cauldron. Everyone came down from his room to the kitchen.
“I should hope not, young Harry,” they replied before slipping off into the crowd.
"I think Hogwarts will do," said Harry. "It's much closer to home." If anyone had an issue with Harry's decision, they didn't make themselves known.
Harry found him a few minutes later, walking towards the potions classroom.
"The Ritz, most likely. There was a rather large sum of money transferred to my account this morning by my brother, Mycroft. I have a feeling he might be in on it too. He does adore Harry."
Harry was pacing the room playing pokemon again when John and Sherlock came in. Sherlock's arms were filled with letters. Harry stopped pacing and immediately started shaking again. John looked at him worriedly.
He woke up an hour or so later, John sitting beside him worriedly while Sherlock read the case against Dumbledore.
Your top hats sleek and tall,
(See the end of the chapter for
“What I really want to know is what’s school like?” asked John as he helped carry the numerous trunks up the stairs and drop them in the lounge.
Lestrade tore Harry from his thoughts by telling him that the court was being organised, with a lot of help from Mycroft. They had decided on a magic/muggle mix that, if all went to plan, would sentence Dumbledore to a max-security, magic proof prison for a good while. Even though Azkaban was the wizard prison., they’re practices were inhumane and Harry wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he was the reason someone had to go through that.
They talked in length about all they had found out, quieting only when a teacher or student walked past.
"I could've, but the buffet breakfast finishes in forty minutes, and the waffles here are supposed to be incredible," said Harry. John sighed and ruffled his hair.
*  *  *
After the thirteenth suspicious death surrounding this vault, no one dares use it. It remained empty for decades, until Nicolas Flamel decided he would try to break its supposed curse. Though no one knows what he put in there, many have theorised that it holds the-
"No. Father never told me. He said he wasn't able to. It must be something that you cannot be prepared for." Harry suddenly felt very nervous. While Slytherin sounded like a perfectly good house, one of the best perhaps, the way McGonnogal said its name made Harry think being a Slytherin was something that was frowned upon.
"You never know what could happen. Don't worry, I have a licence," answered Harry.
"Thank you, Dad."
"How much did you hear?" asked John.
"That is pretty cool. It's a shame I don't remember any of it, then again, the death of my birth parents doesn't seem like a fun thing to remember," said Harry. Draco nodded.
"Thank you!"
Eventually, the cart slowed to a stop and everyone got out quickly. They were standing in front of a large door. Griphook took the key out of his pocket and opened the door. It opened to reveal a massive room filled with thousands upon thousands of golden, silver, and bronze coins.
“Sorry. Old habits die hard and all that,” said Draco, running a hand through his hair. “Anyways, meet back here in an hour?” Everyone nodded and departed, all looking for the perfect presents for their friends.
"But you're a child."
"Is there mind-reading magic?" Harry asked Draco as they walked back from Dumbledore's office one day, Harry rubbing his temples in an attempt to soothe his headache.
“Woah,” said Fred as he looked around. The walls were covered in case files, newspaper clippings, and pictures of both victims and criminals. Hedwig was sitting on the windowsill, a dead frog in her beak. Upon seeing the six visitors, she dropped the frog and flew to sit on top of Harry’s cupboard.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
The next day, another letter arrived, and the next, even more. Harry was starting to get annoyed. He wished his dads were home so he could tell them, but he didn't want to disturb their honeymoon. Instead, he just sat through it, every day throwing out dozens of letters. It got to the point where there were so many he began burning them in the fireplace.
He left.
"Boot, Terry!"
"Brother mine, could you be so kind as to do some research into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry? Don't laugh, they have been plaguing Harry with letters. Ask Lestrade if you don't believe me." Sherlock hung up with a sigh. "He's gonna look into it. He'll text if he finds anything." Harry and John nodded. Harry felt slightly better. If anyone could find out about Hogwarts, it was Mycroft.
He collapsed on his bed and eventually fell asleep, his dreams filled with thoughts of home.
Standing at the top of the steps was a stern-looking woman wearing emerald green robes that reached the floor. Her dark hair was in a tight bun at the top of her head and she looked very impatient.
"And why are you here?" The man asked. Sherlock sighed. He recognised the man as Vernon Dursley. Hardly surprising, as that was the reason he had taken this case.
“You won’t have a case if he’s dead,” replied McGonagall. Mycroft nodded and went over to help.
"Is this yours?" he asked Neville. Neville turned and looked at Harry's hand.
John and Sherlock were waiting for him, and together the family walked together down onto the street and into a waiting taxi, all of them hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.
“This was one of the first things we learnt in History of Magic this year,” said Hermione indignantly.
Harry arrived home and flopped onto his bed, sad and bored out of his mind. Sherlock knocked lightly on the doorframe.
A few people nodded.
"I need answers as soon as possible, and I knew someone who will hopefully give me some," he replied. Draco looked at him oddly, but Hermione smiled. There was little more exciting than a mystery.
"Jeez Sherlock, what did you do that for!" Sherlock said nothing, only pointing at the cupboard. "Oh my god," Lestrade whispered. He turned around and faced Mr Dursley, who was holding a bleeding nose. "Mr Dursley, you are under arrest on suspicion of child abuse and neglect. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence." Mr Dursley was so shocked he didn't even try to stop Lestrade from handcuffing him. It was at this time that Mrs Dursley entered the foyer and let out a scream at the sight of her husband.
Standing at over two meters tall and at least a meter wide, the bearded man in the doorway was quite a terrifying sight. Harry hid behind John who grabbed Sherlock's hand.
"Can we please go in, Mrs Hudson?" asked Harry, doing his best pleading voice. Mrs Hudson nodded and they went inside.
"Have you asked Mycroft to look into Hogwarts? That could give us a lead," suggested Harry. Sherlock nodded and took out his phone.
A few minutes later, the family was standing outside the hotel waiting for Mycroft's car to pull up. When the black vehicle finally arrived, the three of them climbed in and were driven to the English countryside.
"That's inhumane, what wizards have done to that dragon," said Sherlock.
"Are you coming?" asked Draco, already standing in the doorway of the Great Hall. Harry nodded and they walked in together. A few whispers followed them. Many students thought that Harry Holmes might be The Boy Who Lived, but most weren't convinced. Even so, Harry flattened his fringe over his scar, making sure no one would see it. It was unlikely he'd be able to keep the secret for long.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
"I am never drinking coffee again," he muttered to himself. It may be nice in the moment, but it was not worth it. He sighed and clenched his fists. There were worse things that could happen, but when you can hear and feel your heart beating way faster than it's supposed to, things start to seem pretty goddamn bad.
He walked through the castle in silence, not passing a single perfect or teacher. When he reached the third-floor corridor, the door was locked. He quickly opened the door with a spell and slipped inside.
"Don't," said Draco without looking away from the shelves.
Harry woke up at 6 on the dot. Even though school didn't start for nearly two hours, he got up immediately and got changed into his uniform. It took him a while to figure out how to tie his tie, but once he did he ran out of his room and into the kitchen. John and Sherlock weren't up so he ran into Sherlock's room. The last thing he expected to see was both of them fully dressed tangled in each other's arms on top of the duvet. He didn't think too much about it and instead woke them by yelling rather loudly.
“You’re the boy who lived, Harry,” Draco whispered.
Hedwig was just waking up when he arrived. She flew down quickly and stuck her foot out, allowing Harry to tie the letter on and tell her who it was for before she flew off.
“So a Death Eater?” asked Draco. Harry nodded.
"Would you be so kind as to get the hell out of my head?" Harry asked, glaring at the wizard before him. Dumbledore chuckled and the pain behind Harry's eyes lessened, but he could still feel a presence in his mind. He began forcing it out, using all his concentration to lock up all thoughts but the ones focussed on removing the headmaster from his mind. He clapped, suddenly, and Dumbledore lost concentration, though only for a millisecond. It was enough. Harry pushed him out of his mind, but kept on going, forcing himself through Dumbledore's defence.
Or young with scabby knees,
Lots of love,
It took two weeks for Griphook to reply.
“I-I didn’t h-have a-a choice,” said Dumbledore, gasping and spluttering.
"Maybe you will," said the dragon. Harry took a step back in shock and looked at his companions to see if they had heard it. "They cannot hear me, young one. You were blessed with serpent-tongue. You can speak to and understand all snakes, and all dragons willing to listen."
"Canticum," he whispered, the runes on his wand glowing gold. A soft melody started, the sound not seeming to come from anywhere in particular. Harry recognized it as the national anthem and began humming along. The dog's eyes began to droop closed and it slowly lowered itself to the ground. Harry kept the spell going as the two boys edged around the massive canine.
What greeted them wasn't quite what Harry was expecting.
This went on for a while, the pile of wands slowly growing larger. Harry was becoming impatient when Ollivander brought another one. The second it touched Harry's fingers, a warmth spread through his arm. He brought it down in a swishing motion and sparks burst from the tip. Harry smiled and turned around, laughing slightly at the shocked look on Sherlock's face.
Or perhaps in Slytherin
“I have my ways,” said Sherlock, his hand briefly hovering over his hidden holster. Harry grinned and turned back to his friends, all of whom were discussing John’s story. Harry felt no inclination to join in, instead, he let the conversations roll over him as he relaxed, thinking about ways magic could be used to solve crimes.
As they reached the edge of the grounds, McGonagall instructed all of them to grab the kettle she was holding. They did so and were immediately swept off the ground, spinning through the air. Harry’s hand felt glued to the kettle, and as the spinning got faster, he felt as if he was going to be sick.
"But the whole point of magic is that it's outside of what we consider possible. It doesn't have to obey the scientific laws of the universe because it's not scientific," Harry said. He had always wanted magic to be real, because who hadn't, and had spent a considerable amount of time thinking about ways it could exist.
In the centre of the back wall was a large alcove lined with bookshelves, within it was a marble statue of a woman wearing a tiara. The rest of the room was covered in bookshelves and massive windows allowing sunlight to shine on the students working in various armchairs dotted around the room.
Where you ought to be.
“Why else would I be wearing a Gryffindor uniform? Think back this past two weeks, why was I in your house?” McGonagall looked as if she were about to respond, but stopped, thinking about it for a moment before walking over to the Headmaster and helping him stand.
"Hello. Have you seen a toad? Neville's lost one." Her voice was quite loud and fast, in a tone some might call bossy. Harry had a feeling there weren't many people that listened to her at her home or old school.
"I think we should leave," said Sherlock. Everyone grabbed their coats and left the flat. John hailed a taxi and the clambered in.
"What's your name?" He asked.
“Next time, we’re taking a taxi,” said Hermione as they walked towards a mall.
“Well, it started out fairly normal. We arrived at his house and broke in without setting anything off. The house was rather odd, for one thing, there was almost no furniture, and at least an inch of dust covered everything from the floor to the curtain rails. If that wasn’t strange enough, the fireplace was lit, and the fire was bright green.
“She came home one day to find her fiance dead on the floor. There were no signs of forced entry and no obvious causes of death. Also ‘The Boy Who Lived Shall Die’ was written on the wall.” Harry gulped. Hermione paled slightly. Sherlock looked at them questioningly, but they both shrugged.
Once all the tables were cleared of food, Dumbledore stood up again and delivered another speech.
"Oh well, it could be worse. I could be a Malfoy," he whispered to Draco, who looked mock-hurt and rolled his eyes.
When it became unbearable, as it usually would, Harry got up and left the Great Hall. The moment he left the room, the headache disappeared and a feeling he hadn’t even noticed lifted off his shoulders. He sighed and leaned against a wall, wishing his dreams would leave him alone. Sleep hadn’t been coming easily as of late.
When they came home later that afternoon, Sherlock began the rather small task of packing. They had bought some boxes and were done in a few hours. It tired them out, and they both fell asleep quickly that night.
The letter was written in neat cursive with blood-red ink.
He sat there for several hours before any of his friends woke.
"I'm Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. And this," he said, reaching into one of his hundreds of pockets, "is for you." he brought out a slightly crushed box and handed it to Harry. The young boy analyzed it quickly and, once he saw that there were no traps or dangerous things, opened it. Inside was a large chocolate cake with 'Happy Birthday Harry' written on it in green icing. Still wary, Harry closed the box and put it down on a side table.
"Wait up!" called Draco as he and Harry took off after her. Fred and George exchanged a look before following.
“You really are hopeless,” she said sadly.
"Wait up, Harry!" called John from behind him. Harry slowed slightly, allowing his fathers to catch up with him.
While Harry, Draco, and Hermione had once again been trying to find out what was being hidden, and once again having no luck, Hedwig had flown through the library window and landed loudly on the desk, a letter tied to her foot. Harry took it off and opened it, Hedwig flying away immediately.
"You really should get up, Holmes," someone said. Harry groaned, but sat up, rubbing his eyes. He grabbed his glasses and put them on, allowing the dormitory to come into focus. Harry saw Draco standing over his bed, already dressed.
"Yeah, she is." The snowy owl was quite the spectacle and many a jealous eye was trained upon her as they made their way back to the Leaky Cauldron.
"It's a school where kids with magic go to learn how to use their powers. You're a wizard Harry." Hagrid looked at Harry expectantly, looking for surprise or disbelief. Instead, Harry had a wistful expression on his face.
Anyway, I got past the bit that I didn't want to write so the rest of the book should come faster now.
“So, what happened with the case?” he asked. John sat down in his chair and got ready to tell a story.
"SLYTHERIN!" This was yelled out loud. Harry smiled and took off the hat, walking over to the Slytherin table and sitting down beside Draco. He now had a much clearer view of the head table and all the teachers sat there.
McGonagall stepped forward and unrolled a long roll of parchment.
Hardy flipped the card over and was surprised to see that Dumbledore was gone.
When John and Sherlock finally got up, they were greeted by Harry and his friends rolling on the floor in laughter. Eventually, they stopped and sat up.
"Good morning guys!" he said and gave them each a hug. They sat down at the table and Harry opened his presents. Sherlock bought him a whole range of new chemicals and substances for his chemistry experiments, John got him a full box set of Horrible Histories DVDs and books, Lestrade gave him an old real police badge with a note saying to never let Sherlock have it, Mrs Hudson's gift was a large selection of games and a DS, the last gift was from Molly Hooper, it was the game operation. Harry thanked Sherlock and John, then went to his room to start reading the books he had received.
"Mornin'," said Harry.
"How would it be more safe here than it would be in Gringotts?"
The tracks began to tilt downward, and the cart started to gain speed. Within minutes, they were hurtling through the caves, turning sharply every so often and coming dangerously close to the walls. It was like a rollercoaster, and Harry thought it was awesome. Sherlock and McGonagall were having a lot less fun, both of them tightly gripping their seats, slightly green in the face.
"The stomach of a goat," answered Harry, hoping this would be the last question.
"Why? Because I'm going to adopt him."
Harry raced through the castle, charging through groups of people and walking through several ghosts. When he arrived at the gargoyle protecting the headmaster’s office, he yelled the password and ran to the staircase before the gargoyle was even fully out of the way. He sprinted up the stairs and burst through the door.
Minerva McGonagall
Harry had all but gone into shock after discovering the missing wand and—the slightly more pressing issue of—the missing headmaster. It took mere minutes before Sherlock, John, and Harry were piling into a police car. Lestrade turned on the sirens and sped through London, not taking his foot off the accelerator until he screeched to a stop outside of 221b. Everyone sprinted out and up into the flat, Harry summoning his trunk and all his potions things before making a tracking potion faster than he ever had before.
When they came to the living room, Fred and George stopped in shock. A young man of around thirty was splayed out on the floor, a look of pure terror on his face. There were a few footprints in the dust, leading from the centre of the room to about a meter away from the wall before disappearing entirely.
"We should get going," said Griphook. Everyone agreed, and a while later, they had rejoined John and were standing on the steps of Gringotts, all ready to explore Diagon Alley.
"Oi! You are Harry Potter!" exclaimed Tom. The chatter in the pub stopped and people started craning their necks to get a look at Harry.
Around half an hour later, three sheets were filled with everything that had happened in the past week, mainly focused on the mystery around the third-floor corridor. Perhaps his dads could shed some light on it.
The family sat in silence for several hours, all of them waiting anxiously for Mycroft to reply.
"Uh, okay then," said Hagrid, awkwardly shoving the sausages back into his coat. Mycroft didn't look overly happy at the unhygienic food handling but didn't comment. "I'll follow you."
"So neither of you have heard about Nicolas Flamel?" asked Harry for the umpteenth time.
She led Harry to the back of the shop where a blond boy with sharp, pale features was being fitted. He had swirling silver eyes that shone in the dim light. He was wearing long black robes that were pinned up in various places. Madam Malkin stood Harry up on a stool next to the boy, then pulled some robes over Harry's head, pinning them in various places. Harry was glad she hadn't told him to take off his hoodie.
"I wonder which restaurant it is," said John.
Just before the five of them left, Harry scribbled a quick note explaining where they were going and stuck it to the fridge. Then they left and walked onto the busy street. Harry kept an eye out for a taxi, and, upon spotting one, stuck his hand out over the road. There was a bang and a massive, purple, three story bus appeared in front of them. KNIGHT BUS was emblazoned on the side. Harry took a step back in shock and tripped on a loose brick.
Suddenly, the door to the office burst open and five people sprinted into the room.
"What did you do to it?" asked Draco, awestruck. Harry quickly explained the warding and runes, happy to see the shocked expression on his friends face.
"I'm not the right person for this," Molly said to Sherlock.
It took three days of paperwork and watching the headmaster to secure a court date. It was two weeks away.
"No," said Griphook. "The wizards did this. They do not trust us to protect their riches. We do not need this dragon." Harry felt sick. This was the society he was joining.
"And does Mr Holmes have his key?" he asked in a low growl.
"That's a nice owl," said McGonagall when they left the shop. Harry smiled at her and inspected the owl properly now that they were in light.
All at once, the boats began gliding along the smooth surface of the lake, sending slight ripples out towards the distant banks. Harry peered over the edge of the boat and saw flashes of red and a few tentacles. Immediately, Harry knew there was a giant squid living in this lake, which wasn't technically possible since they needed salt-water and high pressure to survive, but both the lake and squid were probably magical, so Harry didn't spend too much time thinking about it. Though he would love to see the squid up close.
“Why did you do it?” he hissed. The headmaster smiled his horrible smile and said nothing. “Vulnero,” whispered Harry. Dumbledore cried out in pain. “Why did you do it!” Harry asked again, yelling this time.
"Well then," said the Professor, "we need to buy your school supplies. John, Sherlock, would you care to join us?" They nodded.
They were particularly bad one Wednesday morning, the same morning that Malfoy decided to talk to him.
A butler led Harry to the large dining room. Sherlock and John were already there, having a heated discussion about magic. Upon seeing his son, John stopped talking and turned to Harry.
- Mrs Hudson.
"That's Hagrid. He's from my new school!" Harry began to explain everything he knew about Hogwarts and magic, and everything he picked up from the way Hagrid looked and acted.
"Do you need some help with that?" Draco asked. He didn't wait for an answer before helping to lift Harry's trunk into the train. The second they had it on a rack, both of them let go of it and hugged each other.
*  *  *
Stuff happened, as it so often does, and I barely had any time to write, so I’m sorry this took so long, but I hope you enjoy it, and thank you so much for reading. It really means a lot.
"Do you wanna hang out for the rest of the day?" asked Draco.
"It's fine. Most people can't even lift a feather on their first try. I'm impressed."
The month leading up to his the first day of Hogwarts was spent reading and memorising all of the books Harry had bought. Using what he had learnt about wandlore, Harry had taken his pocket knife and carefully engraved the wooden surface with protective wards so that people couldn't steal it, he couldn't lose it, and he couldn't be disarmed. He also made sure that it wouldn't be broken, but to work properly, the runes would need a specific spell to be cast, and Harry knew it was illegal for underage witches and wizards to use magic outside of school.
Harry very quickly grew to adore his new life. Every day began with a large breakfast and he was allowed to watch whatever he wanted on the TV. Then Sherlock would begin to teach him how to read and write, and the art of deduction. Harry caught on quickly, much to Sherlock's delight. Once he was good enough, Sherlock began to dig up old case files and give them to Harry to solve. Within a week, he was taking only a few hours to solve cases that would usually take the police several days.
When Sherlock and John finally came back, Harry was very happy to see them, but unbelievably annoyed at the sender of the letters. He gave his dads a day to settle back in, then told them all about the letters. They laughed at first, then got annoyed at the sender too. They decided not to do anything though, and instead decided to wait it out and see what would happen on the 31st. A date that just so happened to be Harry's birthday.
"Very sorry, but I was slowed down by Peeves."
And learn until our brains all rot.
“I dunno. Electricity ‘n’ stuff.” Draco huffed but stopped asking, instead pointing out times where the show was wrong and there had been magic involved.
To achieve their ends.
"I don't want them to drag me home," explained Draco when they ducked behind a piled of boxes to avoid the older Malfoys. "Where are your parents?"
“This is light?” Hermione ignored him, scanning the page for what she was looking for.
A treasure that was never yours,
A few minutes later, the two of them were leaning out of the windows, waving at their parents as the train started to move away. Harry saw a little girl with red hair running after it. The sight made him smile slightly, but sing the tears running down his fathers' faces made him sad.
"Goodmorning, guys," she said, folding up the newspaper she had been reading.
It’s like one in the morning
He sat back down. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. Everyone else was cheering and clapping, but Dumbledore was acting weirder than your average eccentric old man. Harry pushed the thoughts away. Headmasters rarely interacted with the students, so Harry felt sure he would have no issue avoiding him.
"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside, I read about it in Hogwarts; A History," whispered Hermione. Harry tore his eyes away and looked around the rest of the hall. There were hundreds of students sitting around four long tables. All the teachers were sitting on one table at the very end of the hall. Harry recognised the old man sitting in the middle as Albus Dumbledore.
"D-Dumbledore, wants to see you in his office," she said to Harry. Harry sighed and nodded, looking at his friends apologetically before following the student to the headmaster's office.
"Where were you Draco?" he asked.
"He's our son," he said, his voice breaking. He collapsed into Sherlock's arms and Mycroft stepped away, offering Hagrid his hand. Hagrid shook his head and slowly got to his feet, backing away from the couple in front of him.
"Yeah, sure," replied Harry. "How many letters did we get?" he asked.
"You could've given us five more minutes," complained John.
"I don't know. You'll have an answer in a few months," Sherlock replied. He and John looked at each other then quickly looked away. The rest of the walk was in silence, no-one really feeling the need to talk.
The next day, Sherlock hired a van and they drove all their stuff to the new flat, 221b Baker Street. They unpacked and spent the day settling in. Harry explored each and every corner, searching for secrets and treasure. He didn't find much and soon grew bored of this endeavour. Then he curled up on the new sofa with a book and practised reading. He was very good at it and only had to ask for Sherlock's help a few times. The book was kind of boring though, and Harry soon switched to practising his writing. Sherlock said that he was going to start school in a few months, and Harry did not want to be behind.
"YOU'RE HARRY POTTER!" Immediately, every student in the hallway ran towards him. He dodged their outstretched hands and ducked under their arms before sprinting away at top speed. They followed him until he reached his class. A few kids followed him into the cold classroom, but upon seeing the teacher, quickly backed out.
"He is our son!" yelled John, trying to escape from Sherlock and Mycroft's grip.
Finally, Mycroft gave up. Like all the Holmes, Sherlock was unreasonably stubborn. He would do almost anything to achieve his ends, even if it endangered himself or others. Not the most endearing of traits, but Sherlock was intelligent, and, through that, slightly responsible. Maybe a child would encourage him to drop, or at least lessen, his emotionless facade. Besides, the boy would receive a great education and an interesting childhood. Mycroft had no doubt that as soon as he was healed, he would be running through crime scenes and doing his very best to solve them.
Also, I realise these past couple chapters have been pretty dull, but the story should start properly soon.
"He'll turn up," said Harry.
John Watson did come back the next day. In fact, he moved in the next day. Within a week, he was basically a second father to Harry. He was constantly astounded by the boy's intellect, even more than he was by Sherlock's. Both Sherlock and Harry found this very entertaining. However, there was one thing that only Harry was picking up on. It seemed that John was slowly falling for the mysterious detective. Harry, though not particularly good at it, had watched enough crappy soaps to see when love was in the air. He had confronted Sherlock about it, and the detective had gone bright red. It was funny to see them dancing around each other, John with a new girlfriend just about every week, and Sherlock with his emotionless facade.
“Special circumstances,” replied Sherlock, helping Lestrade lift the limp headmaster. They turned to take him out of the room, but McGonagall stopped them, insisting that they dissaperate. No one looked too keen, but there were no verbal complaints as they linked hands and began twisting and squeezing through space once more.
Four hours later, Sherlock and John made their way up the stairs to the flat, holding hands. Both of them were more than a little drunk. The stumbled through the hallway and into Sherlock's room. They then collapsed on the bed and passes out.
"Quidditch will be held in the second week of term. Anyone interested in playing for their house team should contact Madam Hooch.
Harry walked down the large staircase and was surprised to see a large shape on one of the sofas. Harry realised it was Hagrid, the man from his 'dream'. Harry pinched his arm and winced. So, the night before hadn't been a dream. That meant magic was real, and Harry was a wizard. The boy almost yelled in delight but refrained from doing it in fear of waking Hagrid.
Anyway, thank you all so much for reading!! You're all super awesome!!
Just as Harry, John, and Sherlock were leaving the power, there was a knock on the front door. Harry opened it, making sure the chain was securely in place.
"Hungry are you," said Draco, smirking.
"Why on earth do you have a gun?" asked McGonagall.
"Well done for making them see sense. Now, you've got a big day tomorrow, so you go get ready for bed and don't wait up for your father." Harry nodded and ran up the stairs into his room. His brand new uniform was hanging off his wardrobe door handle. The uniform consisted of a white button-down shirt, a blue and yellow striped tie, black dress pants, and a navy blue blazer. His brand new school shoes were sitting on the floor next to his wardrobe. Harry stared at it excitedly. He was going to school tomorrow! Harry smiled again and changed into his pyjamas then climbed into bed and almost immediately fell asleep.
Suddenly, one of the tears by the brim opened up and the hat began to sing.
"Because you are the boy who lived," answered McGonagall. She was holding a stick in her hand and she tapped it against a brick. It must have been a magic wand because the brick wriggled around, then dropped out of the wall. The hole that it left began to grow and grow until the four of them were standing before an archway.
"So find someone who is." He was getting agitated. Molly nodded and called some people. Soon there were nurses all around the bed. Harry was starting to get afraid. All these unknown people and unknown environments were making him nervous. Upon seeing his discomfort, Sherlock held his hand. This had the desired effect and Harry relaxed.
"Are you sure about this?" asked Draco for the hundredth time as they made their way up to the third floor.
"What is that place?" asked Harry.
Set Gryffindors apart;
“You can help from home. I’m not putting you in danger for one murder,” said John. Harry knew it was pointless to argue, but that didn’t stop him.
(See the end of the chapter for
But don't judge on what you see,
Nobody answered.
While this was happening, Sherlock was working frantically to get the paperwork complete to finally adopt Harry. Many council workers had come over to inspect the flat, all saying that it was adequate but small. Sherlock would assure them that he was looking for a new place to live. Sherlock hated the people and the intrusions that they provided. A few had given him stern looks when Harry had gone up to them and told them everything about them. One of the many ways the two were similar was their lack of filter.
"But that's illegal!" exclaimed Fred.
I am sorry though.
'We can't find anything, but your flat is filled with hundreds of letters. What happened here? We've got a cleanup crew in here, so you should be able to come back in a couple of days.'
Finally, after a month of inspections and questions, it was the day of Harry's adoption. The process leading up to this would usually take around six months, but Mycroft had pulled some strings to make it go faster.
Albus Dumbledore
"Usually, I would be happy to," said Sherlock coldly, "but you are trespassing on my brother's property and just destroyed his front door, so I must say no." The giant smirked.
The headmaster was sitting in an armchair right in front of the door, a devilish smile on his face. With a flick of his wand, he disarmed Harry and laughed slightly when Harry’s wand landed in his outstretched hand.
When they finally arrived, Harry and Hermione practically leapt out of the cab, followed closely by Sherlock and the client.
“Friends from school,” said Harry as the client opened her mouth to ask. She nodded and closed it before taking a seat on the sofa.
"The Prime Minister has assured me that there is no better school than Hogwarts that speaks English, but given that you," he turned to Harry, "are fluent in French, you could possibly be accepted at Beauxbatons in France. It's up to you." Harry thought for a moment. Though he was fluent in quite a few languages and would have no issue spending a lot of time in France, it was very far away from home.
"So your name is Sherlock?" Sherlock nodded.
Just before Harry began walking towards it, a puffing Draco put a hand on his shoulder. He leaned over, trying to catch his breath.
When he reached his dorm, everyone was asleep. He got ready for bed as quietly as he could, lying down and setting his glasses on his bedside table far too loudly for the time of night. He shut his eyes and willed himself to go to sleep.
Sherlock was holding John close to his chest, whispering words of comfort and stroking his hair, occasionally sending glares at Hagrid.
Unfortunately, when you have basically no sleep, your mind is not quite up to scratch, so upon entering the great hall the next day, he was once again met with a headache and Albus Dumbledore's twinkling eyes. As hard as he tried to block his thoughts and put up a wall, it was fr more challenging than the first assumed. Instead, he ate as fast as he could and left the hall the second he finished.
“It was at this point we realised we were slightly out of our depth. As Sherlock silently investigated the house, I texted Mycroft, who in turn informed the magical section of the government of our location. Less than a minute later, Sherlock and I were joined by two others, aurors I believe they were called.
Harry kept on looking through the shelves until he found a silver revolver, much like the one Sherlock used, only way cooler. The grip was lacquered wood, the silver barrel covered in runes, and the trigger and hammer were pure gold.
“We’ll see you in a few hours,” said John, following his husband out of the flat.
Molly, I have a child who needs medical attention. He is severely malnourished and dehydrated.
Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
'But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,' said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
Dumbledore flicked his wand and a long golden ribbon flew out of the tip. It flew high above the tables and twisted itself into words.
"Well, we've got Dumbledore. Whether he's trustworthy or even a good person doesn't matter. Enough people respect him or are afraid of him to know to leave Hogwarts alon-aaaa." A sharp pain shot through Harry's scar.
The professor finished calling the names and looked up at the class with his cold black eyes.
A smarter hat than me.
Dumbledore glanced over at the Griffindor table.
He went on for a long time, just thinking out loud.
The first few days passed in a blur. Between having to navigate the ever-changing one hundred and forty-two staircases and having so much classwork you couldn't take a second to stretch your wrist without missing something important, Harry soon became quite tired. Every morning he would struggle to rise, and every night he would be asleep the second his head hit the pillow. On top of that, whenever he was in the great hall, he would get a horrible headache that felt like someone was shoving a wooden stake through his brain.
Of what awaits the sin of greed
The Sorting Hat can't see,
"They're goblins. Very intelligent, and very protective," answered McGonagall. "This is one of the safest places in the world, if you are caught attempting to steal something, the goblins will be ruthless." Harry looked at each of them warily and saw the intelligence and cunning behind their beady black eyes.
"Woah," he said as he saw Hogwarts for the first time. A massive castle stood atop a high mountain, an assortment of towers and bridges with hundreds of sparkling windows emitting a soft, yellow light. Below the students was a small group of boats.
It was a long time before John and Sherlock came back. Ten hours, to be precise. Harry spent each and every one of them pacing in the living room, stopping only to brew a cup of coffee whenever he felt even a little tired. While it was not unusual for a case to take this long, there had never been magic involved before.
Good luck with your first day. I thought you might need some extra energy.
"Just my wand. The shop is really creepy and I didn't feel like going in there alone," Harry replied, standing up. The three of them walked through the cobbled street, stopping outside an old shop-front with peeling paint and dusty windows.
"Harry, Harry Potter."
By the third day, Harry was so tired he was unfazed when Peeves the resident poltergeist snuck up behind him, invisible, and grabbed his nose before screeching "GOT YOUR CONK!" Unfortunately, Harry had been too tired to do his hair that morning and his fringe shifted, revealing the lightning scar on his forehead. One kid saw it and cried out,
The next day, Harry woke at around midday. Sherlock and John had already left for their honeymoon. His suit was lying crumpled on the floor where he had left it last night. He picked it up and hung it back in his wardrobe, then he went to the living room and watched TV with a bowl of Coco Pops.
"Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Pot-Holmes?" It wasn’t a question. "You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work."
The Slytherin first-years followed a prefect out of the hall and down many staircases, through a cold hallway until they came upon a blank wall.
Sorry this took so long. School really does suck the creativity out of you.
"Yeah, he made the Philosopher's stone," said George.
"I've got school today!" exclaimed Harry. Both men sat straight up. They looked at each other, slightly confused. Then they groaned and rubbed their heads.
“Oh. Okay,” he said. The rest of the ride was silent. Harry felt sick the whole time, but said nothing to Sherlock.
"It was sooo boring. None of the kids knew how to read properly and we spent the whole day going over the sounds of the alphabet. No one wanted to be my friend and several kids called me 'four eyes'." Harry sighed. "I thought school was supposed to be fun." Sherlock pulled the young boy into a hug.
It was quarter to ten when the taxi pulled up outside the station. Harry burst out of the door the second they stopped and grabbed his trunk, loading it onto a trolley, before grabbing Hedwig's cage from the car and putting it on top of the trunk. She wasn't overly happy with the rough handling and hooted in annoyance. Harry apologised and gave her an owl treat, then started pushing the trolley into the train station, practically sprinting in his excitement.
"Accio Trevor," said Harry, his wand glowing bright gold. The girl looked at it in shock. A few moments later, a green thing flew through the air and landed in Harry's outstretched hand. Trevor the toad croaked quietly and Harry cast a few healing spells just in case.
When they finally arrived home late that night, Harry immediately fell onto his bed and fell asleep smiling. It had been a long day. Sherlock smiled as he tucked him in, then he went through the apartment, making sure everything was tidy, then he himself went to sleep.
"Woah," said Harry, stepping inside the room. "This is all mine?" he asked Griphook. The goblin nodded. There was a money pouch on the floor. Harry picked it up and shoved some coins into it. It felt weird knowing that he was holding more money than all his pocket money from the past eight years combined.
To Mister Holmes,
“Just leave them alone,” said Draco, “for the sake of all of us.” Harry smiled.
Harry had never seen such an incredible place. It was lit with hundreds of candles, floating high above the heads of the students. Harry looked at them in awe, then saw the ceiling. There must have been some sort of enchantment to make it look exactly like the night sky. Harry could see every star, every constitution, every little detail.
