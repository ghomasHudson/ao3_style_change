“Um, Sergeant Donovan’s just been explaining everything, the two pills. Been a dreadful business, hasn’t it? Dreadful.”
In response, the strawberry blonde woman smiled in a way that held no warmth. Her voice however was silky as she replied “After you,
The Water-Spirit thought to himself that John, as little as he knew him, didn’t seem like the type who’d forgive something as awful as that.
“John! You have to help me!” His friend moaned, sounding panicked and utterly knackered even from the separation of a telephone line. “I did everything I was told to do, I mean it was written all down in the pamphlet but-”
“Just didn’t sleep much last night, honestly.” John replied easily, blue eyes warming with amusement as he took in Greg’s state. The man’s green apron was inside out, and his hair was tousled from running. He had been late for work, and the boss (one Sally Donovan) was probably going to have his head later on. Greg didn’t seem particularly bothered by it though, his smile lazy and warm even as he wrote down an order from a pretty woman in a dark blue dress. John wrote her name on the plastic cup,
(because Sherlock was in such a state that his will to be as rebellious as possible crumbled to ashes) had left him, and by all accounts had shown no intention of returning. He may have told Sherlock where he was going, but the Dragon found he was struggling to recall the soldier's words. They came slowly to him, thick and sluggish and unreal with his haze of fear. All he could remember was the adrenaline spike, the pounding of his own heartbeat, and how John's eyes for a moment had flashed raw terror before smoothing into their usual caring tone. His hands tightened about his knees, sudden despair drowning him.
A pealing sound of agony tore from its lips that made the young man's ears ring and almost drove him to his knees. Confused blue turned into pained and furious red, and with a mighty shriek of agony the beast turned and transformed, becoming a fully-sized Dragon for just an instant and almost closing its teeth around the Handlers' head before a second taze from the Lieutenant brought him down.
John searched and searched, finding himself stacking the books and ordering them according to topic, to information held. A part of him whispered that it was beyond foolish, stubbornly insisting that there was no possible way any of said creatures even
“Would've had to come here in a few days anyway, being a medic and all. I'm in charge this shift, if you need something, don't be afraid to ask.” He turned to Sherlock then, silently sizing up the Dragon's form for a moment before he got to his diagnosis.
Aliens used to be in many ways the stuff of fairy tales. If John thought really hard on it, a fuzzy childhood image came to mind of sitting around a campfire, his sister by his side. They would tell tales, ghost stories and alien abductions being painted in lurid detail over the sugar-sweet melting of marshmallows and chocolate. The stories were often fueled by the darkness of night, and John by the end of the night would feel warmed by the cheery flames crackling away and the scratchy texture of his mother’s pyjama leg, his cheek leaning against it. He used to fall asleep during the summer to the whisper of U.F.O’s and of far-off galaxies, and they spotted his dreams and made him wonder what it’d be like to travel to a new star, a new place. He grew up thinking that meeting an Alien would be like meeting an imaginary friend- something wondrous and strange.
Sneak found the embrace a warm thing, slightly troubling but not terrifying. His eyes fluttered closed of his own volition, and softly he sighed. The steady, even breaths of the ex army doctor soothed Sherlock's own reservations, and he held onto Sneak, pretending he was clinging to John. He listened to his flatmate's heartbeat, and counted the measures, thumping solidly against his chest.
Major trigger warnings in the chapters ahead! this is not a happy fic but if you're reading you likely already know as much! ^.^'' tread carefully, yeah?
“It's fun, isn't it love?” And her verbal agreement sent a pang of small relief through John, glad she was using more and more words.
It was a lullaby filled with a haunting kind of certainty, and for a moment the boy caught a glimpse again of the hunger underneath the boy. Sherlock was not quite human-looking in the light of the moon, all pale edges and dark shapes. He did not seemed overly worried or concerned about his own family, and though his sentences were simple, John got the uncomfortable feeling that the creature was much brighter than he appeared to be. If John had been older, he might have voiced that Sherlock's grip upon his wrist was vice-like, or he might have at least questioned why Sherlock paused once only to scoop a hollowed out shell from the sand. It was a mussel half; its pearly inside shimmering in the pup's palm before the two boys were overshadowed by the outcrop of the cave.
Lestrade's features relaxed, a small smile coming to his face as he leaned back into the seat. He passed a hand over his face, scratching at the day-old stubble that had managed to accumulate under his chin (there had been a case, barely any time to sleep let alone shave). His voice thawed into something that was a bit warmer as ruefully he shot a look of apology at John even while rubbing the back of his neck.
“I’m sorry.” John said, and Sherlock knew that he meant it. It wasn’t enough, and yet it was like a balm to the jagged hole that had nearly been ripped out of him at the thought of John’s passing. The Dragon made a small, helpless noise at the back of his throat. Sherlock couldn’t tear his gaze away from John’s face as he cupped his cheek with one hand.
The moon was full in the sky, swollen and pregnant with light that shone down on the blackened waves like reflective mirrors dancing along the water. Breaking the calm pools that filled the darkened cove by the sand of the beach, silvery bodies swam to shore. Their calls barked softly into the warm air of summer, calling their pups to follow them and leading them with gentle nudges and notes of song that drifted above them. He swam after his brother, body twisting lithely, smaller than the others but not by very much any more. It would still be a while until he was grown, but his coat was no longer soft and downy. It was losing its cotton-like appearance. Like the other pups his age, he celebrated his growth by ducking and twisting through his pod.

Everything. Even you! Even Sherlock Holmes! What is the point of staying alive if there is nothing that can hold your interest?! If there is nothing to break and burn!” John's voice shouted across Mycroft's office, and it echoed deafeningly in the man's ears so that he barely heard the whispered lament of the madman. It was as soft as a downy feather.
On the one hand, she wanted it. Badly. She wanted to play games, wanted to have Mr. Holmes as a friend. She wanted
Really, he had only taken note of them when he had spent one evening trying in vain to clean up a little, worried about Mrs. Hudson's inevitable distress when she would find the enigmatic detective had all but shot holes in the walls again. One had slipped and fluttered its way to the carpet as the army doctor had pushed a pile of old cold-cases to the side, and the rounded face that had looked up at John caught his eye almost instantly. Picking it up, John
“I need a job.” John stated, as if to the flat, or perhaps the air inside of it. Sherlock for his part certainly didn’t reply, currently lodged as he was in a text on apiaries (somewhat deliberately). John sighed at his partner’s recalcitrance, fixing the man with a pointed look until the detective had no choice but to set the tome down. John’s voice was gentle, and he looked at Sherlock with kindness in his eyes. Far too gentle, in Sherlock’s mind. “I know we have the money, but I want… I want to
Sherlock was lying in an open field, warm summer sun tossing his curls and making it so that they fell into his eyes. He could feel the touch of the grass beneath him, smell its sweet scent and taste it in the back of his throat.
John stared at his hands, not daring to glance at the detective. It felt like there was a frustrating block to his thoughts, somehow. An inexplicable weight that kept him from explaining seemed to sit sickly inside of his gut. He did not want to burden Sherlock with his pain, but it had been a long time since John had told anyone about any of his past, and now it seemed like the only real option. After all, Sherlock
budged. She swallowed the instinctive cry that wanted to leave her throat, panicked thoughts coming to a dawning horror as her mind demanded answers.
So, weeks passed without anything really going amiss, save for a general feeling of seething arguments left unsaid and the strange dreams that John had late at night. The ones that made him toss and turn, only to wake in a cold sweat and clutch at the blankets. The ones that left a name lingering as an echo on his lips, only just forgotten. Dreams where the moon hung over the ocean, pregnant and ivory white and turned the entire sea to silver, save for a shadowy figure in the distance. The one that sang as they called to him with outstretched arms, their eyes the only visible part of their features. A beautiful, hungry blue-teal. The one where he couldn't really be sure if it was a dream at all, or if it was always on the edge of a nightmare.
so much nicer than Afghanistan, Sneak concluded as he inhaled deeply a large breath of fresh air, whistling to himself a chipper tune. His hands were in the pockets of his jacket, but they twitched with anticipation as his sharp eyes looked about for a tube line to take. It didn't look like there were any exactly nearby, and he sighed a very much put-upon noise as he realised he'd have to use some of the money that was sitting in John's wallet. Though he personally had no qualms about using a couple of quid to get by, he knew with certainty that already Daniel was watching him closely. Though the other personality couldn't kick Sneak out of control when he was serious about being let out, he'd make the man's life a living hell if he did anything to make John's life harder for him. As it was Sneak knew for a fact he'd be unimpressed with him for so casually ditching Sherlock Holmes, even if Daniel didn't trust the detective as far as he could throw him. He walked to the corner of the rain-muddled street, raising a hand to hail a cab even as he looked at the clothes he wore with mild distaste.
Sherlock’s expression, once open and beguiling, now flattened into something critical. He eyed John with scientific interest, a rumbling purr leaving his lips in melodic harmony that was filled with fascination and confusion alike.
Rolling his eyes, John looked around vainly for some hint of Mary. His sister would likely soon find not only her friend but the spiced wine, and John didn't want to be alone for the duration of the festival. Already his patience was beginning to run a little thin with Harriet, his love for his sister slowly being eaten away by his irritation. As much as the Watson siblings loved one another, it was usually a battle between them. Predictably, John soon heard the delighted cry that meant Harry had found her friend. She spun to John, looking at him with round, pleading eyes. A silent request to make himself scarce. He couldn't help but soften at that gaze, acquiescing softly.
And just as John reached the window frame, Sherlock lurched inches from the London cobblestone blow, wrenching himself upwards from his free-fall in which he could feel his heart pound and the wind rush through his ears.
Sherlock's thoughts were cut off when the sharp scrape of his friend's chair alerted him to John moving. Before the detective could move, or even properly think, the army doctor was there. Pulling him in an embrace. Closing him in a shield that seemed to be made of warmth and safety and
He opened his mouth to lie, to make up any story that would let him back out of the harebrained scheme that had trapped him in this situation. But… Greg was looking at him with an expression that Mycroft could read all too easily: Worry. He barely knew him, and yet Greg already cared enough to pick up on the fact that something was wrong. Mycroft didn’t
Irrelevant. John doesn't know it, but there were months where they lived on the streets. Most of the time though they had made him sleep through it.
He drove a touch faster, knowing that Sherlock would be impatient to return to the water. Despite his reservations, John still held some fear that the Selkie of his childhood would go and vanish, either by choosing to leave his seal pelt behind or by some other darker means.
Victor watched as the man in the suit seemed to acknowledge him for the first time, although there was little doubt in the young man's mind that the mysterious official had seen him from the beginning. His pale eyes flicked over him in such a way that was distinctly Sherlockian, and the brown-haired teen felt as if a layer of skin had been peeled from his body in that single glance. Unlike Sherlock's usual assessing pattern of deducting then promptly blurting out whatever he had seen, the cold figure smiled a reptilian smile. Victor was rather reminded of the snakes he'd used to sometimes poke with sticks in his yard when he had been a child. He found his upper lip curling in decided distaste.
Sherlock had a plan for wooing his mate, despite what his brother seemed to think. Lying with lackadaisical limpness on the couch, the Selkie’s pale eyes seemed to glow in the dark like beacons. John, after restlessly setting a cup of strange, boiled liquid on the side table for Sherlock to consume, had tottered off upstairs, citing exhaustion as the culprit of his absence. The Selkie didn’t believe him, as not a moment later there had been the sounds of pacing on the upper floors, worn beams giving John away as much as the tense line of his mouth.
It was a shit ending, really. Some Dragons claimed to their children that if they listened during a snowstorm, they might hear the cries of the princes. Utterly foolish, and entirely morbid. His head bowed, and he wondered to himself why the story never sat well with him, like an ice-pick in his chest.
When the Human broke apart from the Selkie, he found his wrist was aglow. Runemarks hummed under his skin, pulsing bright blue in their radiance.
The first time Sherlock actually had issues with food, it hadn't turned into an actual problem. No, that hadn't happened until his late teens really. But he could still remember not being quite comfortable around it, yet not for any real reason of his own. No, Shyla had not hated food.
“You need to say that to him, little one.” And he growled then, letting words flow from his lips that sounded like hissing but fell together like a lullaby.
If the detective noticed how his blogger suddenly took longer showers, he didn't seem to comment on it.
Waiting for John to awake, Sherlock marvelled at how fragile Human beings seemed to be. Although even he had been struck by the magic's power , his new Mate appeared to be out stone cold. The pup might have been worried, if it weren't for the steady rise and fall of John's chest. Although Sherlock had little doubt that his kind were stronger physically, it still amazed him. His fingers tentatively reached out to stroke the side of John's cheek in curiosity, marvelling at its chubby-like softness. Already, Sherlock was losing his baby-fat, becoming leaner and more angular. John, however seemed to still have a ways to go before any muscle would be likely to form. Still, that did not bother the pup. He had no doubt that John would make a good Mate. Once he became like Sherlock, of course, and joined him in the waves. The thought sent a flutter of contentment through him.
He used the word he had learned from his picture book on animals back home proudly, smiling when Grandma's wrinkled cheeks turned upwards in a small smile that was worth its weight in gold.
Irene Adler was indeed, a sight to behold. This was mostly due to the fact that she seemed to have a penchant for wandering about completely and totally naked. She entered a room like she was utterly unconcerned of the consequences, all sharp smiles and curves that made John’s eyes linger and his lips pinch in distress.
Sherlock opened his eyes to find John standing beside him, both of their eyes wide as they took in the village that only a night before had experienced rain for the first time in years. It was a sight to behold, and one that even the Water-Spirit had to admit, was rather spectacular.
Damelia didn't acknowledge them other than the way all slaves were forced to. She bowed once lowly then straightened, apparently preferring to observe the hordes of students for any sign of danger than to talk to two gangly strangers ogling her like she was property. John immediately felt a little embarrassed for being so obvious, but it was hard
Sherlock had chosen dark colours, things that reflected against his pale skin and made it seem downright translucent. A pair of dark black trousers, tucking in a shirt that was a deep plum purple, the colour of an African Violet. Over that ensemble, he had chosen a charcoal
something he tried not to let rankle him. He settled for a smile and a nod, nothing that would give too much away. Thankfully, Greg seemed to notice his discomfort and came to the rescue.

A Selkie too often forgot that their lover could not breathe in the water. Those who courted a Selkie, without fail found themselves drowned.
She opened the door, raising her head to greet the man she had decided already to give a chance. However, the person she saw made her draw up short. Memories from a few years now, of silver-blonde hair and blue eyes. Of scars. “Walter Johnson”, and yet apparently, not.
Dodge looked at John, who had gone rather sickly pale at not only the idea of the permanence of this, but also with the idea of
Without even sparing a glance at the women behind him, the pale-faced figure's gaze unerringly locked with John's.
able to rage and spit ice and snarl, but everything was suddenly too much to handle. He felt himself slipping, and for some reason that scared him almost as much as it was delightful.
She could feel him, John. Asleep, deeply asleep. Tucked away so that he couldn't see their hands that
A small, hysterical bubble of amusement, mingled with horror and hysteria, broke from John's lips. Giggling, he looked to the detective, and found himself unable to stop. The shaking puffs of laughter filled him, filled the flat almost eerily, their edge strange and too high. Sherlock remained silent, although his dark brown lowered in what only John and a few others would be able to recognise as concern.
She had also left him the flat, which even though it was obviously beautiful, was currently blazing in flame.
The statement had been met with silence. Thick like cotton-wool, it wrapped about the kitchen, the tea mugs set before them, untouched and now undrinkable. Shyla continued to look down at her hands, which tightened and loosened at uneven intervals in her lap. Her chin clenched as if expecting a blow. Mycroft through the blank haze of his own mind suddenly screaming
He licked his lips in excitement, a familiar boiling sensation rippling deep in his blood. Excitement. Lust. Adrenaline. All of it filled him to create a glowing heat like none other deep inside the man's chest. Something dark and alluring. Depressing thoughts were pushed aside as he quickly drew a schema in his head of the outfit he'd buy before he'd arrive at his destination.
He took a deep, steadying breath. There wasn’t anything to be afraid of, John reasoned to himself. If he wasn’t supposed to be here, then there’d be a wall or something keeping him out.
he did something wrong or John called him over for company, and so Sherlock found even as he knelt at the foot of the stairs that he felt uncomfortable, awkward even. As it was, John's piercing gaze seemed to make the skin on Sherlock's arms crawl, the masked horror and... was that

“Your village will suffer at least a hundred years more before I even consider giving them the barest drop of water. You want childish, John? Fine. I will be childish and cruel. Your village’s destruction will ultimately be your fault.”
“Selkies are not the only things that kill in this world. Humans kill too, and yet you do not seem to fear them in the same way. To kill for food, or to protect what is mine, that is my instinct. Other Selkies protect their herds from outcasts, and their children from threats... Yet Humans… Humans kill for pleasure. Humans kill for the sake of killing. It is a concept I do not understand, and an ideal I have no wish to learn.”
Mycroft was, or Sherlock for that matter. A Gem on the outside merely looked the way they wished to, but it sometimes was painfully clear just how alien Earth’s newest inhabitants were.
“You are… my queen’s ally,” she murmured, more of a statement than a question. Dark eyes regarded Mycroft warily, reading his tall figure. Ever the diplomat, he’d extended his hand in welcome. His accent was likely a little rusty, but passably decent.

in Irene Adler. “You wanted physical evidence of your encounters to use as leverage should it be necessary… but someone didn’t approve.”
Evening cast itself in pale moonlight, illuminating John's pale figure and turning his eyes a brilliant, silver sapphire as he looked up at the detective with wide, unfamiliar eyes. His gaze was large and saucer-like as they took in the length of the flat, flashing with confusion and a lack of recognition as a voice that was softer and higher than John's whispered.
Yet a small kernel of hope glowed inside him, because Sherlock was no longer looking at him piteously. He was no longer treating John like he
John could feel deep inside of himself that something was wrong. It was a rotting tooth, a prickle down his spine. His limbs felt detached from him, as if he were a water balloon floating in a pool. Nothing was quite real, and nothing was present.
“So… Sherlock’s a defective Gem, then. I still don’t understand why that makes him so embarrassed though. It’s not like I’m going to judge him for it, most people think
Sherlock looked at him uncertainly, shuffling shyly from foot to foot as he was suddenly overcome with a bout of self-consciousness. Trying not to let it show, the Dragon spoke rather gruffly in John's mind.
The young boy could see that, etched into every inch of the creature's skin. It shouted at him, like a vivid splash of paint on pale moonlight. His very brain did not want to comprehend the existence of this strange hybrid, the strange in-between of beast and man. But possibly worse, was the fact there was just enough
John looked at his friend skeptically, after a moment considering his love life as of late. He hadn’t dated anyone in nearly a year and a half. That wasn’t exactly normal for him. In fact in secondary, he’d been more than a little bit of a womanizer.
He tried to sound firm, but Mike's eyes were glittering with resignation. Both knew instantly that he was lying. John's face broke out into a wide grin, and he heaved a
Sherlock wasn't listening. He was too busy pulling himself into the cab and barking directions to the driver.
a family of upper standing would have never have allowed it, not if they cared about their name.” Blue eyes narrowed in thought then, alighting only when John's hands came together, clasping in answer.
Anything could happen, the least of which being his Dragon could very well decide just to lay waste to his flat. He could accidentally hurt himself on something sharp, hurt someone else (it was still up to debate if it would be on purpose or by accident) if they decided to walk in, or he could even wind up causing such a racket that another tenant could complain. Teetering between feeding his friend to the wolves and possibly feeding Sherlock to them, John wavered. Looking at the book lying heavy before him, the soldier felt as if the green leather cover sat accusing him. Its golden-coloured pages promised solutions not just for him, but for so many others. He was quickly realizing that up until now, he hadn't thought outside the realm of his own problems, facing the terrifying challenge of raising a Red-Card Dragon from savagery into some semblance of civilized intelligence.
. He was kind, sometimes desperately so, and the Dragon knew in the pit of his gut with sudden certainty that the young soldier would never order him to subjugate. That in itself, was the problem.
For a moment, Sherlock feared that Not-John wouldn't take the deal. His expression was decidedly uninterested and impassive. Unfocused.
John frowned, his brows drawing together in confusion as he looked at the woman. He knew for a fact that he would have remembered had he met someone like this before, or at least been able to recall those milky eyes and hair. As it was, he was ensnared by the stranger’s gaze, unseeing and yet looking at him with such clarity that the young man felt rather exposed.
However, after a second he sighed, slipping back down onto the sand, returning to his people sulkily even as his mind still explored far and wide.
Sherlock, all but torn to pieces in an alley. Raped or beaten, his curls sticky and matted with blood. Thick, coagulant. The detective's coat burned, like Lizzie Adam's dress had been (the third victim). John waking to find the detective gone from his bed downstairs, thinking he had merely wandered off when in fact he had been drugged unconscious and kidnapped (Erren Brown, fifth victim). The dreams had cost John more than a few cups of tea and beauty sleep, and naturally Sherlock pretended not to notice. The detective focussed on the case with the keen senses of a cat, pushing further and harder than other cases in a cold and calculating desire to avenge that he had no idea he had possessed until now.
and been done with the whole awful mess. But there had been something about the way Seb's voice had echoed in the library, how Sherlock felt suddenly as if he were an island, drifting all alone.
“I was nearly ten before I finally got out of the Foster Care system and into a proper home.” John replied easily to Sherlock's question of his past, clinically detached and polite as he gripped his cup between his hands. Its warmth was soothing, grounding him to the present even as his eyes were far away and tainted with something cold and worrisome.
he made the bed every morning (the sheet so tight you could bounce a coin against it) and the way he woke without hesitation at five thirty in the morning every weekday. It was in his hands, steady despite their tension, less likely to tremble when faced with stress as opposed to boredom.
In the back of his mind, two personalities shifted. One in unease and despair, the other in morbid interest.
“What are you on about?” Greg wrenched his leg free from the man’s grip even as his mind whirled to James Brennon, head of the forensics. He wasn’t sure why his instinctive thoughts leapt to believe a drug-addict, but quickly enough reality crashed down on him enough that he shook his head in denial. “You’re out of your tree. Not to mention high as a kite. You’re going to have to come with us.” He knelt then, making as if to help the kid up onto his feet. However the young man scowled, curling away from Lestrade’s hands and making himself smaller up against the wall. There was a crafty gleam in those pale eyes, and Greg mentally prepared himself to stop the man from doing a runner. He was unprepared for the verbal assault he received instead.
to ask how Sherlock can look at a person and see their entire life like a road map laid out in front of him. He
seem to know how to get two people to notice one another. For gently, Mary came forward, blue eyes filled with careful concern, and she asked in a rich voice that made John think the stars were made from the timbre of her speech “Are you all right? That looked like it rather hurt.”
When she recovered, Morstan asked the question that was hovering in the air, breathing it into the silence. With it, John felt the ice inside of his chest only grow to fill his blood.
“He’s showing improvement from last night,” Mycroft stated at this particular meeting, seated in a comfortable leather chair. Across from him, Sherlock had made himself a sprawl, lying upon a plush sofa that someone had brought in specifically for this room. It was a makeshift library, clearly out of place in such a sterile building. Old shelves cast golden tones in the room, warming the normally frigid features that gazed up at Mycroft with contempt. “They had to do another operation on his shoulder, to get more of the shrapnel out. With any luck, he’ll wake up soon.”
Sherlock all but purred in pleasure as a hand wandered up to his curls, stroking gently. “Hi there, Love.” John reached to turn the waffle maker off, sensing the mood shift even as Sherlock pressed closed lips to the flutter of his pulse.
“There's.... There's one that's bright red. Like the colour of blood. Shouting's coming out from it, horrible noises. Crashing and banging.....There's a little one, right next to it.....I can.... I can hear laughter.... children? Must be....”
“Sherlock would likely gnaw his own leg off before he’d do something like that, so you’re safe on that front. The issue is that Sherlock’s heart- the reason you’re in this whole sticky situation, can’t regrow without a consummated marriage, meaning he can’t go back to his God status.”
Though right now he really didn't really feel like eating. His stomach was doing harsh flips inside of him, and his intestines felt as if they were tying themselves into knots.
We’re currently trying to suss them out, to see how far this goes in the command chain, how much we’ve been compromised.”
Sherlock would never make the same mistake again after him. Which was why in a way, the detective had to thank his old friend. Without Victor, he might have dismissed John. Or for that matter, Lestrade.
Sherlock's only reply was to snort, tightening his embrace. His voice was arrogant, but his grip was possessive.
John went to war expecting not to make it back home- and in some ways thought he was better for it after years of watching his mother and sister drink themselves into an early grave, his father an early death that loomed over the household like the pain of a phantom limb. He thought he could escape those memories if he sanded them away with battle, training drills and pushups in replacement of the quiet nights filled with too many unspoken words.
And Sherlock, suddenly quite vulnerable and unsure of where to look, might have responded, if not a Draconian shriek had pierced the air at that exact moment. John's neck snapped around as he looked for the source of the sound, eyes widening as he saw a soldier with dark ginger hair standing over her Dragon, remote in her hand and trembling as she looked with horrified eyes at the crumpled form of the magnificent creature lying at her feet. Her gaze was slowly filling with tears.
and the detective growled, obscenely pleased at the notion. It was then he saw that John was still painfully hard and seemingly a bit too dazed to do much about it. The man was pressing his jean-clad erection against the mattress, rutting against it and whining in frustration even as he kissed Sherlock back. That wouldn’t do. Sherlock wasted no time in reaching for John’s belt, helping him shuck out of his trousers so that the detective could return the favour.
Likewise, at about the same time, John came home one fated evening to find to his surprise Sherlock gone, and the elder Holmes sitting placidly in his place, twirling the handle of his umbrella absently. Clutching an armful of groceries, John paused in the doorway, a curious mix of tentative curiosity and open distaste wavering on his features.
that he's covered with a scarf about his neck-” Sherlock stepped forward, ducking past Victor's frame. His fist came around before he could quite stop it, landing squarely across Mycroft's cheek. The satisfying
Sherlock's curling smile somehow brings to him a small measure of safety, even as his hand began to tremble at his side, and he could almost
Claude piped up suddenly, and Conrad snarled a verbal and emphatic “NO.” that made Sherlock flinch slightly away from his intent listening at the door. The voice sounded like John, but raspy and rougher. Like a person who smoked heavily and shouted orders over gunfire.
Sherlock was wearing one of the shimmering, eye-catching robes he seemed to favour so much, not a curl out of place despite the earliness of the morning. At least, John thought it was early, time was hard to read in the Water-Spirit’s palace. He did his best to seem composed, though he thought perhaps by the careful glances and distance Sherlock put between them that his betrothed didn’t quite believe it. John could feel the Water-Spirit’s hesitance, and the tips of his ears flushed as he remembered last night and what had happened.
His hatred turned into a hating of everyone as he watched fellow soldiers torture a Gem with a form that was childlike and small, killing them over and over only to wait until they revive to torture them again.
But he was already beginning to slip into sleep, and John was coming forward into control. In the end, only one personality was allowed that purpose, that life. Only one could at the end of the day claim the right to live, and he was so unaware of the gift that was. The Alters shifted and muttered at the knowledge of it, chafing in their own confines like animals kept in the iron cage that was the human mind. Illusions, that’s all they were.
“So, you want to know what it’s like being married to a Holmes.” Greg stated plainly, seated cross-legged in front of John. The statement was blunt, but it was true enough, so John nodded and resisted the urge to flush as he felt Sherlock’s eyes on him. Still, he managed to keep his voice from wavering when he spoke.
“Mm, lemme see now... I think we can come to an understanding.... a trade... information for a little extra...” And the man pricked the corner of John's neck, red blood trickling brightly down their skin. Claude could taste lava on her tongue. She screeched.
He ran into Mike Stamford nearly three months into his return. Too many days for John at the time were spent aimlessly wandering parks, drinking cold cups of coffee and dreading the fact that he could barely afford said meagre lifestyle. Army pension his arse, it did little to help the fact that he had lost both sleep, weight and purpose, his life marked in the number of times he sat in front of his therapy-mandated blog, staring into space.
Pressing a kiss to her father’s forehead and clutching her small Dragon to her chest, she sheathed her dagger in the bodice of her dress. On silent feet, Rania slipped into the room where her brothers slept, sightless but her eyes wide open.
He rather roughly cut off Sherlock's vocal attempt to show his displeasure by nudging the Dragon in the side, scowling and sending a mental plea of
“Depends on where you're posted. Low-risk operations means you'll have to wait at least a few years. However since you two are medical boys chances are you'll be sent to the really important lines. I'd say by your first year.”
Bill sighed, stepping forward and tilting his chin up in defiance even as he complied to Wilkes' order. John was not relieved. He could tell that whatever was to come didn't sit well with his friend, and that he had seen something like it before judging by how reluctantly he'd complied to the request. John found himself only being soothed by Sherlock's quiet analysis of the Colonel before them, thoughts flitting to and fro with an impressive degree of efficiency.
With that rather gloomy thought, the little boy buried his head in his elbows and attempted to not jump at every noise that came in the dark.
Sharp teeth grazed John’s collarbone, and he whined despite himself.  His head felt fuzzy - a mix of adrenaline and lust shooting through him in surprisingly equal waves. He was terrified, but a part of him was also feeling very much alive in a way he never seemed to replicate when he wasn’t in immediate danger. Sherlock’s lips pressed to the skin of his neck, sucking in a way that made the soldier’s toes curl and his heart drum in a frenzy. In the darkness of the hidden post, no one would come looking for John for a good hour at least. Not while they themselves were being attacked by Demons.
One could only stay frozen for so long, pretending time didn't exist. Locked in a stalemate that had no foreseeable end.
, instead he felt a strange ache in the back of his throat. Because Sherlock wasn't insulting him, wasn't calling him an
In a surge of frustration, he punched the mirror in his bathroom, snarl shrieking out embarrassingly high when his knuckles had connected with the glass.
“The stitches we put in for the abrasions you suffered around the fracture will tear if you try, and we don't know how the bones will shift with the transformation. I'm sure your Mistress will understand-”
, and that even if they did they most certainly would not grow in a curving single-file line out into the beyond. He knew a trap when he saw one, even with his brain half-fried and in distress. His eyes narrowed into calculating slits, noting that the Human had vanished at some point in the night.
This, so close to a posting, this was trust, and the Dragon marveled at the lengths that the wonderful, foolish,
John, but it meant that now they faced an issue neither knew entirely how to solve. Like a Rubik's cube, hopelessly tangled and scrambled so that no colours marked the right sides, They
being awake and yet.... not. An inbetween from reality and the realm of dreams, John floated placidly caught between dark and light in a sticky, cool grey. It clung to him, somehow dimming his body, making it blend into a canvas of faded layers of cloth. He got the distinct impression that he was awake, and yet he could see nothing. No Sherlock, no
“Take me to the body, then.” Sherlock murmured, a chill wind picking up and tousling those curls, doing nothing to hide the man’s excitement. John felt a similar leap of thrill in his chest, beating in tandem with their footsteps shared as one along the rolling hills that would lead them to the torn apart body that was once Ernest Dailey.
It is the sound of a bullet shattering through glass that makes Sherlock first think that John Watson is extraordinary. The sound crashes past his ear, hitting the cabbie/serial murderer square in the shoulder as he topples backwards with the force of it like a pin struck by a bowling ball. His knees go out from under him as Sherlock's dark curls whip about, staring at the empty window in shock and rapid calculation as the bottle of pills falls from his slack fingers.
Its focus had slowly moved away from him, eyes sweeping over the expanse of the room with an almost nervous energy. The Dragon's eyes roved over the four walls, taking in its prison for the first time. Strangely though, it didn't seem perturbed by it. The angry, deafening snarls it had once been using had stopped almost completely, making way for a kind of trickling burble, like the Dragon wasmuttering to itself. John could hear Dragon-Tongue mixed into the strange noise, and he didn't even wince when he was abruptly dropped onto the ground. Instead he curled into a compact ball, pressing himself against the wall as he took in great shuddering breaths. The Dragon, distracted now for whatever reason, backed away from him slowly, blue eyes flicking about the room with a sort of driven impulse.
Hamish clapped his hands together in affirmation, smile wide and as awestruck as John’s always was when Sherlock did something clever.
That was the reason in the end why he turned, grabbing his coat, shucking it up and over onto his shoulders. For Sherlock knew without a shadow of a doubt he
The abuse had already started then, for him. Abruptly, he had to bite his tongue, hard enough that he tasted copper. Best not to linger too long in front of dark doors, he knew that much by now.
An eye for an eye, it seemed. It wasn’t John’s handwriting, but then again you’ve seen how the letters of his penmanship change with his personalities.”
Which was why in the end Sherlock suddenly surged forward, crushing John's lips against his own. Hoping that the sudden attack might break through the illusion, smash it to pieces.
Those thoughts were safe, in the solitude of his bed in the dark. John could think of these encounters while touching himself and not feel as if he were stepping on something dangerous, something taboo. The Gem in his shoulder hadn’t really decreased his sex drive, and so he found himself often trying to recreate those drunken nights, later replacing the images of those women with images of Sarah, from work. None of this frightened John really, until the images as the weeks passed began to shift, tumbling towards faces and scenarios that were both alluring and alien. Blonde hair began to turn to raven curls, sometimes in the light of the moon the darkest shade of blue John had ever seen. Daydreams of soft thighs became lanky limbs, delicate fingers and large hands. John could ignore this, guiltily encourage it even some nights- but his limit was when he came and Sherlock’s name nearly spilled from his lips, hoarse and needy in the darkness.
“Mycroft, these are the twin princesses Ming and Rei from the east, their friends Chun li, Kareem and Muhammed.” He pointed out two Dragons with identical faces frocked in green robes, along with a girl with long dark hair braided down her back and two boys with clothes that placed them as part of the princesses’ party. They all smiled, nodding and making some token of greeting. Mycroft smiled reflexively, bowing to the royal children with his mother’s words in his ear-
And the man shivered, feeling a chill weave itself up his spine like a coiled, clinging plant. John found himself scrambling for the rusted keys, the lock tumbling into place as he turned the brass handle and pushed his way inside. He was met with the silence of a place he hadn't visited in over a decade. The stillness of the air made him freeze, musty smell seeming to cling to the very hall he walked into.
If he had known that his brother would pay a call for breakfast, Sherlock might not have decided to leave in that moment to go to the fountain, if only because John would meet Mycroft totally unprepared.
where it was distributed. He did not like how despite his hormones and despite the years, he still had a curve to his thighs and hips if he ate too much. If he went too long without a case. He did not
the other personality that had lingered in John for just an instant. He would be a fool to not take into account what
The young man thought, and tilted his head to the side as if to get a better look. Northern Dragons were a bit of a novelty. They tended to be very powerful creatures, strong and good for battle, but because of the fact that they had to maintain a certain body temperature at all times they weren't often taken in. Coupled with the fact that their scales could shift colours to blend into a variety of different environments, they were also exceedingly difficult to keep track of or to catch. John caught a glimpse of a trademark pale blue eye as the creature blinked once. But it must have closed its eyes again the next second, as there was only shadow once more.
“You're free to try. But I have a taser on me, and something tells me you're smart enough to realize that if John woke up feeling like he just became scrambled eggs he might be a little annoyed.”
The elder Holmes’ parting words before he left Sherlock to his waiting game rang in the detective’s ear, niggling its way under his skin.
It wasn’t God that answered John’s call. Instead it was something else, a piece of something that had wound up in his shoulder. The soldier could remember the warm glow of it sometimes, imprinted on the back of his eyelids. It whispered to him a name, even as the world crumbled away and left John bereft in a sea of darkness, alone and afraid.
“Everyone, armed and ready. Don’t attack on sight, but don’t let your guard down. John, Bill, if there’s a Dragon amongst their ranks, give the signal. Rory, you and your dragon will send a signal if we’re attacked.” The captain’s Dragon Farrow shifted as he spoke, becoming his true form- a mass of green scales and teeth. As one, the squadron moved closer, preparing for any kind of confrontation.
With the Game beginning, Sherlock decided at first to proceed cautiously. After all, he wanted to test the waters, not blow them up before he had barely gotten started.
He watches as those blue eyes flinch just slightly, and then smooth over into grim acceptance and resignation. His shoulders align themselves with military-like straightness as if bracing himself for some sort of fight.
He was only slightly surprised when his own weapon was thrown back at him, the man’s voice faintly amused.
With every day, during which he was forced to coax, beg and borderline bully Sherlock into letting himself be mounted, John felt something inside of him bend. Pressing into the line of his ribs, adding pressure until he felt like he was trying to breathe through a straw. It was like struggling to move a brick wall, and John despaired over the fact that as much as it was necessary,
, then they hadn't been active since John met Sherlock. That meant that this personality wasn't one that usually came to the forefront, not like Daniel or Claude.
“You don’t. The first visit, we’ll keep an eye on him. If there’s even the slightest hint to Moriarty about him, then we’ll sit Hamish down and tell him. But he is not his Father Sherlock, just as Hamish isn’t us. We can’t hold on to grudges of the past. I learned that the moment you returned to me after...After your Fall.”
“You’re new, but you’ve got some of the best aim I’ve seen in years with a gun, and what’s more, good instincts.”
Sherlock woke to the bang of a bullet echoing in his mind. The Dragon reared from his cot, drenched in a cold sweat. But his waking revealed no dangers, and the desert was quiet and dark even as the moon spilled over the base, drenching everything in a pallor like bone. Heaving quietly in his blankets, the Dragon shivered, though he had never been cold a day in his life. Across the tent, he saw Murray's form, sound asleep and shifting only at the sound of his harsh breaths. Sherlock struggled to reign them in, silencing them with a sharp bite to his wrist. The skin came away puckered and angry, but it calmed him.
“I like you too,” he blurted out, unable to come up with something more eloquent. Greg groaned, turning to pace irritably at the edge of the cliff-face. His voice was a growl of irritation.
the flat, the cold loneliness that had lingered in it before. It was strange, but ever since Sherlock had entered his life, John hadn't been bored. Suddenly, life had a purpose and an interest, and its name was Sherlock the Dragon. He no longer felt an oppressive need for routine, no longer felt as if the days dragged on. The idea of someone coming and taking the Dragon away, just when John felt Sherlock was beginning to trust him was painful. He could picture the betrayed look on the creature's face, picture how wide those blue-green eyes would get before narrowing into slits of hatred. It couldn't happen, John wouldn't let it. He glared at Mike, willing him to see that he wasn't going to budge until his friend agreed.
Molly came in just as the crash of one of the many fine vases could be heard, and she gasped at the state of the room, and at John before running over, attempting to stop him. John let loose an inarticulate cry of fury and agony at her touch, wanting to strike out and instead sinking to his knees. The sharp bite of porcelain cut into his skin, but he barely noticed.
There was much about Mrs. Lena Hudson that not many people knew. Having moved to London nearly thirty years ago, she had developed a rather prominent British accent overtime, and thus could pass fairly well to an untrained ear and untrained eye. Coming originally from District Seven in America (What used to be Florida), the elderly woman held a fair few trade secrets from her youth that one might not necessarily expect. For instance, she knew how to peel an orange so that its skin would unravel in a perfect spiral, having eaten many in her childhood with her younger sister (now dead and gone, sadly). She also knew how to appreciate a little bit of rain, since her home-town had scarcely been more than a desert during the summer, and so London by comparison was a viable rainforest. But most of all, Lena Hudson knew how to spot a soul that was hurting from a mile away, because she recognized the primal ache that both man and beast tried to hide when the ones they loved wounded them.
“Yeah, I’ll see you tomorrow,” he promised, taking Mycroft’s hand and giving it a small squeeze. Greg stood from his chair, making his way to the hall.
singing in his blood. He hovered only a moment, asking Sherlock the one inquiry that would decide whether or not the soldier would lean forward, or try to escape one last time. “Different how?”
Mycroft entered his brother’s realm on the eve of their hunting night, the tap of his faithful parasol warning the younger Incubus of his impending arrival long before his brother actually took corporeal form. Sherlock had laid himself out on the single piece of furniture that inhabited the room that was otherwise filled with clutter; a pale figure that was both ethereal and dead-looking when absolutely still. He would look like a corpse to any human eye, but Mycroft’s sharper vision could see the barest rise of his brother’s chest, the minute shivering of the massive wings that stretched out lazily from Sherlock’s back like twin sails enshrouding him. A figure made of darkest shadow and alabaster skin, the Incubus bothered to open only one eye, lazily reaching out one hand to gesture at his brother in a shooing motion.
Sneak's smile was languid as he laughed, shaking his head in faint disagreement as he replied “No, you wound up on the
Louder. More of a growl. Sherlock twitched and shifted shamefully, his movements jerky as if he was barely aware of how tense he was. His blue eyes melted into gold, slitted and narrowed.
“Is it safe in those rocks for him? I mean, anything could happen if he goes on his own. I don't much like the idea of him slipping and hurting himself and not being able to get help in the dark.”
The idea of Sherlock even having a mother sent a vague sort of horror through John, but he supposed that all things had to have come from something. His knowledge however of the lore of the Water-Spirit’s family was admittedly limited however, as for some time he hadn’t attended the temple. He reached towards the teapot sitting upon the mat before him, pouring himself a cup of the herbal-smelling tea he had noticed before and taking a long sip.
Molly thought, wondering with fear what she had done. She looked into the mirror, cracked and broken from an event she couldn't remember, and realised with a jolt that she looked terrifying. Her copper-brown locks were messy and wild, her dark brown eyes
John found his thoughts begging desperately, his eyes fluttering closed. He wished in that moment harder than he ever had before, equal only to being shot out in the desert, bleeding under the hot sun and pleading for his life.
Her words sent a chill through John's spine, and he swallowed nervously and nodded in affirmation. The air holes were just large enough that John could fit his hand and the lower part of his arm into it, but he hesitated for a moment before doing so. Inside the Crate, the Dragon was obviously disoriented, also fairly angry. Normally he wouldn't think of doing anything that could provoke it further.
lighter he had bought for such an occasion to his lips. The curling ember glowed by his palm as he inhaled deeply, eyelashes fluttering closed for a moment and chest swelling until he exhaled with a rush. The smell of smoke to Sarah was something akin to familiarity, and it did not bother her. She continued to stare at him, eyes tracing the lines that marked and twisted over his skin. Lying on her side,
“I moved them to the living room.” John answered in response to the direction of the detective’s gaze, grinning in that self-conscious way he had. “None of them seemed particularly life-threatening, so I took the risk.”
Then the Water-Spirit turned, walking away from the flagstone courtyard, empty of life and people, as it had been for nigh a hundred years. Always lifeless, stone dead and stone gardens, flowers frozen in time like the woman, crying her eyes out and watching Sherlock as he left with eyes dead and glassy with fear.
Looking up, the teenager found himself face-to-face with a rather peculiar figure. A teenager, probably around the same age as him, stood tall and angular amongst the line-Up. He had dark, curly hair the colour of midnight, and his pale skin seemed as ethereal as it was unsettling. More strange still, his eyes were a curious colour, not quite blue and not quite green. He stood with his head cocked slightly to the side with an impatient expression, his stare as piercing as it was cold. A deep blue scarf was wound about his neck, keeping the chill out.
Dodge was all hard edges and solid confidence, a strength that was always on display. Her shoulders remained ramrod straight, and she held herself in such a way to appear taller than she was. She nodded sharply at John by way of greeting, short mahogany hair dipping as she was ushered into the flat. Her boots thunked solidly on the floor. What she saw was, admittedly, better than she had been expecting.
in the unspoken way in which he held his ground, and yet Daniel didn't seem to notice. Or perhaps not to care. His voice was deadly calm as he clutched the rucksack over his shoulder, but his body was a
so as some of you may know, I am officially back from hiatus! :3 glad to be up and writing again, and excited because this story is beginning to pick up and Ii get to introduce one of the final Alters to meet! >:3
Unfamiliar feet followed his human’s recognisable ones, and yet there was a timbre to them that the Selkie’s sensitive ears picked up on vaguely. Graceful but self-assured, as if the owner of said footsteps were walking in their own home. If he hadn’t been so lost in a haze of pain and burning, he might have been able to recognise the familiar pace of his brother, walking in the long shadows the walls of the cottage provided.
It was nearly eight in the morning when the army doctor’s eyelids fluttered open, and Sherlock immediately found himself heaving a silent sigh of open relief as the man blinked in confusion up at the ceiling.
After all, he wasn't about to just let a Red Card Dragon have free reign of his flat. At least not tonight. The pamphlet titled
He found himself shouldering Sherlock’s weight, a determination settling in his gut for that not to happen, whatever the cost.
“One of the newbies I see! Medical ward too? I recognise your face from the profiles given to me. What's the name... Watson?”
He watched them, dark curls soaked through the edges with silver from their light. His eyes were unreadable blue orbs, piercing in the night. He was lost in the depths of his own thoughts, blue robe trailing behind him in long sleeves and train across empty stone corridors. Only the nervous stone guardians, frightful creatures crouched and still on the rafters of the home and on the edges of the reaching walls saw him as he retreated into the shadow of his own roof.
Sebastian Wilkes when he had first arrived had appeared to be made of sharp smiles and the shiny edge of inherited wealth, stalking through the halls of Eton like a peacock, head held high and proud.
What he found instead was the wide, sunny smile that Hamish gave James as he lead him upstairs to his room, and the way James looked once up at the detective, large eyes blinking an unspoken apology. It was then Sherlock knew that the boy was aware of his heritage, and that he was ashamed of it.  Deeply ashamed.
With the glow of a cigarette between his lips, Sherlock smoked, and thought. The savour of nicotine on his tongue was as soothing and bright as the stars, peeking out from clouds overhead.
Sherlock seemed ecstatic to have the other Selkie about, and it didn’t take John long to figure out why. Though he didn’t understand any of the barking language that Sherlock and Lestrade shared together, Sherlock seemed to quickly switch over to his crooning song so that John might better comprehend what was going on. Lestrade, after a moment’s pause, followed suit.
Seated on the bed, John and Sherlock found themselves rather curled about one another, like kittens in a basket seeking out warmth. Under normal circumstances, the level of intimacy would have perhaps unsettled John, as he was unused to such things without one of his Alters stepping in and taking over. Yet he felt comfortable, with Sherlock. Open. His head rested on the detective’s chest, and their joined fingers toyed idly with one another even as Sherlock’s eyes stared somewhere into the distance. His rumbling voice hummed vibrations against John’s ear, like the purr of some great cat. It was a rather soothing noise, if John were being honest with himself. “My mother’s first husband came from a richer line, purebloods and rahs destined to be in control of large companies and finances. As such, Mycroft and I were born in a lap of both luxury, and responsibility. We were cared for by our Nannies as much as our own mother, though Mummy even back then made it clear that we were loved and very much wanted. Still, she had her teaching job- mathematics and physics and whatnot- and so there were large stretches of time where my brother and I were left to our own devices.”
The Dragon's gaze swept over John with minute speculation, noting that the Human before him showed tell-tale signs of sleep deprivation and stress. His pupils were dilated from drinking too many caffeinated cups of tea, and dark circles hung under his eyes. The blue-striped jumper he wore wasn't quite as tacky as the beige one he had worn the other day, but it made him seem younger somehow. Sherlock found he was looking at not so much a soldier, but something between a man and a boy. His blonde hair was slightly ruffled, making look not unlike duck feathers sticking out in every direction in golden tufts. Though short, it was just long enough that the Dragon had the inexplicable urge to run his hands through it, if only to test to see if hair could really be as soft as it looked. Quickly though he did away with that thought, mentally kicking himself even as his nostrils flared to take in the smells of the flat around him.
It might have made John just a little bit jealous, if Elena hadn't decided to show her affection for her other parental figure in a completely different way.
“My brother showed up to the crime scene, high as a kite and demanding to see his friend. It was also there he happened to meet Gregory Lestrade.”
She flashed him then a smile that was disarmingly affectionate, and it was all Molly’s openness and ease that appeared on Iolite’s features. “She won’t shut up about you, truly it’s nice to hear her be so vocal."
at dodging direct questions, the army doctor had found sometimes indirect hints would tell him of Sherlock's mental state. He noticed how sometimes the detective would look at him, as if he were fragile. Made of glass. John noted how the man's hands would seem to twitch as he'd stare longingly at the door, only to freeze when those restless eyes landed on John's form curled in his favourite chair. John heard the soft
“....Perhaps. Yet, the question that I would pose to you would be, would Sherlock have wanted my presence?” John didn’t answer, hands tightening at his sides. His reply would only be what the older man expected it to be, a resounding and screaming NO written into Sherlock’s current absence, something John saw now was deliberate, likely the result of Lestrade calling him away to a case. Mycroft continued to fix upon him a look that was as pale as it was knowing, something dead and cold in the expression. The army doctor found himself sitting across from the man, not bothering to offer tea. Somewhat childishly, it was of John’s opinion that the man didn’t really deserve it.
One, something had happened to John, and as such he was now a Dragon up for auction (A lack of collar meaning his tags were being reordered). This was an option Sherlock’s mind shied away from, something painful and raw and
When the soldier asked his partner what had happened, Sherlock refused to respond. His tense posture however spoke of something feral, unguarded. It was clear to John that whatever had just happened was not normal Dragon etiquette. Moreover, it appeared to have shaken Sherlock to the core so that no amount of soothing would calm him. The Dragon remained tense, snapping at John's teammates, who were only vaguely aware of anything happening at all. Yet as John listened, he could hear the thoughts of the other Dragons in the truck, uneasy and afraid. He felt himself frown, trying in vain to ascertain what was causing them such distress.
It was created as a realm for the moon goddesses’ children, the many stars that litter the night,” It was a familiar bedtime story, one John had heard many times in his own village. It changed from his memories of the tale as the woman went on. “But the darkness became difficult to control, gained awareness, and with it, came the wolves.” The music box played, and an image in John’s mind began to flicker to life.
As it was, Sherlock was elated by John's scent. Like sunshine and the rich, salted smell that came from shallow tide-pools, it was just the kind of flavour the young pup enjoyed the presence of. Comforting without being too heavy. That, coupled with the fact that the child obviously thought he was just as interesting as Sherlock found
Forgetting about his loneliness, the Selkie licked his lips in a sudden stirring of hunger. It had been
The closing of the door was like a balm, and soothing silence replaced the chatter. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see John’s shoulders visibly slump in relief, head lolling downwards as if he could scarcely bear to hold it up. The man’s hands came to his temples, and Sherlock watched as John kneaded at his own scalp for a minute before deducing quietly.
, and not that horrible kibble he had been forced to eat in the Kennels. Not even half-frozen rabbit had this kind of promise behind it.
“It’d do it for me,” Greg chuckled, looking at the painting of the solemn-faced Dragon. It was true that in the dim light of the torches, Rathbone did look rather menacing. It wasn’t Mycroft’s favourite painting, but Greg seemed fascinated enough that he didn’t really mind.
Bill didn't look up from his folding of clothes as he spoke, but his voice held an edge of caution. His green eyes burned under his fringe of dark hair. John wordlessly reached out once to stroke the edge of one of Sherlock's wings, watching as they turned a dark and unreadable blue.
At least until a bullet ripped through his shoulder, and John for just a moment, thought he could hear a distant and strangely familiar cry.
Though his power was not unheard of, many viewed Mycroft as odd. This was because of his Magic, his abilities. From a young age, he was good at most types of Magic, but in particular he held an affinity for Shape-changing. Every Dragon felt more comfortable in their skin, but Mycroft found he had many skins he loved for different reasons. It was a rare gift, one that in theory should have been celebrated for a young prince to have. In truth, it made it hard to have friends in the rookery. Hatchlings didn’t like waking up to a naked, pink, two-legged thing wandering about. They liked it less when Mycroft shifted into other things, brought forth from his own imagination. Things with fur, and too many limbs and too many wings. Some were colourful and beautiful. Others, slithering and deadly.
He does not know who Sherlock Holmes is, but if he is sharing a living place with The Body then that means it is his duty to ensure that he is safe to be around. Him or Conrad, but Conrad would break things and get too angry for a stealth job. After what happened the last time he wouldn't be trusting Sneak further than he could spit either.
Sherlock didn't think himself fat. That was too simple an issue. No. He merely didn't like where the fat on his body
Mycroft's voice was unamused. His tone was faintly disapproving of the possessive way in which Moriarty caressed the detective's name, and his drawl was smooth and deliberately detached in order to appear in control. A game, a puzzle, and Jim leapt upon it eagerly and lapped at it as if it were sweetest milk.
He could feel sweat beginning to trickle down his forehead as the creature pressed down harder. He whimpered as he tried to claw at his throat. An instinctual, useless action. It offered no relief.
Sherlock watched as John slowly turned red, hating his own actions as much as he was actively hating the Human that was making the soldier cringe like a schoolboy caught stealing. It was a decidedly defensive posture John had adopted, and unwillingly the Dragon caught another flicker of insight into John's childhood that made his temper sky-rocket even as his scales burned a steady orange-red.
And Sherlock didn't follow, because in the end, John always had the last word. And his words cut into the detective, leaving him feeling as though he
the other personalities, as none as of yet had woken to even give him a telling off for interacting with the youngest personality. Not that Sherlock had done anything particularly ghastly to Claude, rather he had come to somewhat befriend the child, showing her his many experiments (The eyeballs in the microwave had made her squeal in fascination) as well as engaging in many a round of
The detective looked at his companion then, the set of his jaw hard. He looked resolute. “I had no desire to begin our friendship that way, not with anything so invasive. I still dont… I don’t want to. Not if it’s not okay with you.”
Yet, he also knew that it could not work like that, and that kind of dreaming was foolish, even for someone who sang children’s lullabies to their Dragon.
Soon he caught the eye of someone, a rather pretty girl with strawberry-blonde hair and deep blue eyes. She appeared to be around Sneak's age, and sat a little bit away from the bustle of youth that crowded the dance-floor. Her dress was racy and red and spoke recently divorced -
And the man woke to the dying echoes of a voice lost to him, and he sat up in the leather chair of his home sharply with a retort already on his lips before he realized it was all an illusion. The dream left him with a feeling of happiness
Then he grabbed the file in his hands, thumb brushing over a piece of black and white paper that had wormed its' way out of the organized rubber band. A pity really that Sherlock hadn't seen it, because written in its' block-type print were words that Mycroft would have been sure he would have wanted to know.
with an armful of files and the expectation of seeing the detective crashed out on the couch, or John making breakfast.
“Hm, I think the first day really. I saw your experiment, the one with the thumbs. Knew you were trouble then.” His tone was almost playful, and for a moment Sherlock forgot himself, almost smiled despite the fact that his goal had been only to ostracise and get rid of the peculiar man who had rather forcibly wedged himself into his life. Pressing the last of the bandage to the jut of his collarbone he straightened, refusing to wince as he inhaled- unable to quite exhale fully. He reached for the button-down lying on his bed even as he spoke.
Yet it didn't matter. Sherlock tried not to rub at the chafed skin, instead standing his ground perilously in the frame of the door.
John made a tutting sound, merely fixing Sherlock with a small glare. The detective always seemed to wilt under such a look, it reminded him too much of his mother. Sherlock fidgeted in place, frowning in displeasured acceptance. It was probably the best John could hope for, even if the detective did make to go sulk on the couch.
John's cheeks were pink from exhilaration, and he smiled as down below the crowd had broken into a rowdy rendition of
She took a deep breath, and with the motion her shoulders sagged, her hair creating a curtain that hid her face. Safe. For now, everyone she needed to protect was as safe as they could be.
What was left of the strawberries were left, rather forgotten in the waking glow and the sound of John’s voice murmuring softly in Sherlock’s ear.
But on the floor, Cerioth tensed. His dark eyes narrowed into slits and the muscles in his arms flexed almost imperceptibly, and John soon saw why.
this part of himself, of pretending to be a Dragon with a normal Specialty. Something warm rose up inside of Mycroft, dangerously close to being tears. He blinked them away, furious at the emotion. His father’s voice warning him to never reveal his gift to others was drowned out by Greg’s presence, suddenly coming forward until the Dragon’s snout nearly touched Mycroft’s forehead. Hot breath washed over his face, Greg’s voice echoing in his head.
Of course, as soon as Sherlock noticed that John was staring, the walls seemed to come over him like a liquid tide. John watched as those fine features abruptly schooled themselves, though not even Sherlock could completely hide the dark flush that heated his cheeks. John, still Citrine in appearance took initiative, closing his eyes and shifting back into his more familiar form. The last dying dregs of music from the radio seemed to fill their awkward silence, drifting away to nothing. The two of them stared at one another for a moment, and all John could hear over the pounding of his own heart was that damn voice:
“I’m sorry if I’ve frightened you, or if I’m not what you expected. But I felt like it would be best if I showed you before you heard it from someone in court.”
flat than the detective himself. He had noted that Claude appeared to get distracted quite easily, and this time was no different. Sherlock watched with some amusement when John stood to walk over the mantel of the fireplace, picking up a rather macabre ornament of the Detective's, precisely the skull. John's hands treated it with delicate fascination, his eyes wide and childlike as he turned the object over in his hands, fingers tracing over the polished edges with interest.
John cut off then, throat suddenly tight as he refused to think further. As if sensing the direction his thoughts had taken, the Dragon quietly replied
John sang the last bit, voice rising and lowering. It was not a happy tune, rather, it sounded like the haunting dirges of a lullaby. If Sherlock had been a more honest man, he might have admitted that he was slightly afraid of the figure kneeling in front of him, even as John slumped boneless against his shoulder and sighed. His breath was a puff of hot air next to the shell of the detective's ear.
Mrs. Hudson laughed, the sound airy and bright. He could mentally see her brushing away his confusion.
John could feel the man trembling, could feel the heavy leather of the collar. He felt all of his anger abruptly wash out of him like a soothing tide. Replacing it was a wave of sadness and shame. Without thinking, he found himself stroking the top of Sherlock’s curls, running his fingers through them in an attempt to comfort the man who was now coming apart on top of him. Like a child finally going to pieces, it wasn’t long before Sherlock began muttering apologies. They started off in John’s head, broken, fractured images of begging and panic and fear and
like his sister would be. The thought did little to cheer him up however, it was simply too cruel to brighten his mood. Guilt filled John for even considering it.
The running water of the sink was loud within the confines of the men’s toilet, reverberating noisily inside John’s pounding head as he splashed water on his warm brow. He winced at the cold droplets, bracing his hands against the frame of the sink and taking a few deep breaths before he looked into the mirror. What he saw made him groan in frustration. His cheeks were pink like some blushing school girl’s, and he looked thoroughly guilty about the entire thing by the tightness about his eyes and mouth. One look, and Sherlock had thoroughly upended his normally reserved emotions and made them as clear as day.
“Fascinating. You truly are nothing like what I've read of John Watson. You are different down to how you hold yourself..... Tell me, just how many of you
Harry had forgotten to close the window again. John's first thought was to the light blinding him, shining so brightly that even with his eyes closed it burned. He winced at its intrusion, slowly coming back to himself, rising from a blackness that seemed endless and deep and somehow strange. Not quite like sleep. Something far softer and yet more clingy, pulling at him even as he wrestled to feel his limbs again, clench his hands in unfamiliar sheets and breathe. Like swimming in dark and unfamiliar waves, he thought he caught glittering slivers of moonlight, slipping and sliding behind the darkness of his eyes. As he struggled to open them, John realized that the silver slivers were wind-chimes, blowing softly in an errant breeze.
convince the others to tell John. It's obvious you aren't... satisfied with the way things are as they stand....”
“I haven't. I haven't used and I haven't cut. Or burned. Or injured myself deliberately in any way aside from the meals...You can
It was a hollow feeling, to starve when there was food only a short distance away. Sherlock considered the sensation as he lay on top of his bed, comforter scrunched into a nest-like ball to his left from when he had needed its weight pressed all around him. Now it was too stifling, and he found his shirt rucked up past his navel and the sweatpants he had donned for the day hanging loosely from his hips. He didn't look down, instead his fingers mapping out the edges of his clothing, toying with the waistband's cord. Arbitrarily he felt nausea swimming low in his throat, as if his stomach believed he could vomit out the sensation of hunger if it only tried hard enough.
Bill's shoulders relaxed minutely upon being addressed directly, gaze cooling from emerald to chartreuse.
John finally got home by the time mid-afternoon rolled around, his errands having left him laden with bags of both groceries and new clothes for Sherlock. The tea-tree oil smelled sharp and strange
Molly flushed at his stare, hastening to explain herself. “That government man that found us… he seems well, cold. You’re not being held here against your will, are you?”
Sherlock had dreams of his own, though he was not inclined to sleep often. Being the son of the goddess who could travel within people’s sleeping memories meant that most of his dreams lead to a lecture or seven, and truthfully this did not encourage him to rest his transport often.
It coated everything, like slick, sluggish tar. Sherlock likened it to staring out at the world from the inside of a jar of molasses. Heavy. Silent. Waiting.
John watched the crab shuffle back towards the water without a care in the world, claws clicking excitedly. In the moonlight, her shell looked like a polished stone. She disappeared into the waves, letting the tide take her back out to sea. Sherlock watched her, and there was a fondness and curiosity in his eyes that John found he had come to recognise. It was so often directed at
Hesitation, thought. Claude licked her lower lip in consideration, eyes screwed shut in memory. When she answered, it came out almost like a question.
It was in the end Sherlock’s choice to move away, and he did so just as John felt as though he might lash out. The Selkie rose to his feet smoothly, all angles and grace, his bare backside on unselfconscious display. The creature’s scars were shiny and whip-like, curved over corded muscle and flesh. John’s eyes were drawn to them just as much as they were unwillingly drawn towards the bow of Sherlock’s strong calves or the slender arch of his neck. Standing strong in the dark, the Selkie’s eyes were ghost-like as he sang once more, bare feet already moving towards the ocean.
Already he was dealing with a creature that was mad at him, and probably wouldn't hesitate under normal circumstances to rip his throat out. But John figured he was probably already dead anyway if he didn't do
However, he wasn’t alone. Before Lestrade came to greet them fully, Sally was already pushing her way through the crowd. On her face was a tight scowl, bitterness in the line of her shoulders as she called to Greg as if he were half-mad.
“Y-you want your cloak back, but you also want m-me.” Saying it made it more real somehow. Still John pressed onwards. “Give me two months, about sixty nights to decide whether or n-not I want you. Get to know me. Let
good. I'll have to do it again tomorrow morning, but overall your back looks like it'll heal up nicely. I got a few other things for you, if you'd like to see them.”
tune, something hypnotic and light about the melody that drew his interest. Mouth still sweet from the lingering taste of chocolate, Sherlock was slightly irritated as he realised the soft, rumbling and vulnerable noise that echoed throughout the flat was coming from himself. He rolled his eyes as he took into account
“That’s why you saved us then. Because you thought we might have your book.” John came to the conclusion aloud. He’d hate to be the one to disappoint the man and admit that it had been stolen.
The wolf hummed, his ears twitching agreeably. He was closer now, Irene noticed, and she could see that he was much larger than any wolf should be. His muzzle alone could have ripped her leg off, snapped her in two without effort. This close, she could see his fur wasn’t just black- but the absence of all other colours. It made the wolf seem unreal, a shadow or a dream.
Yet it was the only time outside of missions that any of the soldiers were permitted off compound without previous notification, and as a result the soldier couldn't bring himself to quite mind it, even if he went to bed with blisters along his feet and an ache in the base of his spine.
Moriarty laughed at the accusation, eyes widening in disbelief. Without him using his abilities, the pupils were cool brown, nearly black and pupiless. They were unsettling to most in the way they never settled, flickering back and forth mindless and mad.
“Failures.” Mycroft stated bluntly, his head tilting to the side. “The reason Sherlock and I are considered brothers, is due to the fact that we were made in the same batch of Gems. We were both intended to form Diamonds, leaders. It’s an extremely difficult Gem to bring into fruition. Yet where I came out fully formed and functional, my sibling… Well, in another time, their Gem would have been destroyed. When under extreme stress, he can’t maintain his form, and there are… other nuances that make him an outlier to most of Gem kind.”
that caused him to sink to his knees with a low hiss of pain. Through the ringing of his ears, Albert sounded intrigued.
He broke off then, and John could feel the darkness coming back. Now he fought it desperately, trying to keep away Sherlock's haunting repetition.
Its roar surged with the simultaneous bubbling of emotion that ripped through Sherlock's chest, making him taste hot iron on his tongue as he struggled to
, coat whirling behind him as he paced and hastily made room for John in his favourite chair (as it was filled with files and cases that had been thrown about in Sherlock's haste to find clues as to John's earlier whereabouts). He felt himself coiled, wound up on cigarettes and the leftovers of adrenaline and (as appalling as it is to consider) worry, and as a result he paced through his temper, attempting to reign it in lest it lash out and shatter the frail, hunched figure obediently trailing behind him. Sherlock was furious. Furious with John. Furious with himself. Furious at Mycroft because he took too long and he didn't think that he could
He took in the familiar scent of tea and earthiness, a trademark of John that Sherlock found himself rapidly starting to associate with 'safety' (Much to his annoyance). It was the strongest flavour that rolled off of his tongue, but now that he had a better chance to analyze, he could tell right away it wasn't the only one. Under the predominant scent of the Human, other smells lingered like accompanying flowers to a bouquet, surrounding the centre that was John. Strings of sandalwood cleaner and violet perfume (girlfriend? No, not the scent of a young woman) mingled and wound around the sharp scent of gun oil and boot polish, probably from up the stairs where John's bedroom door stood open. With it there was the muted smell of bacon from the other day, followed by a newer scent that was equally delicious but that Sherlock didn't recognize.
He was twelve when his father picked up and left his family, and the elder Holmes could still sometimes hear the screaming rows the normally quiet man and his mother used to have if he thought back on it. Young and a bit of a mummy’s boy to begin with, Mycroft had viewed Arthur’s departure as the final straw, and decided from a young age to cut all ties with the man. His mother did very little not to encourage him, her own hurt and Arthur’s more nonconfrontational nature leading to a long silence that would only be breached in the aftermath of a few significant events. Mycroft grew up under the ruling of a matriarch that did not bend, and as a result he found in many ways he both respected women, and knew that the moment one underestimated them, they would find themselves poisoned without the slightest hint of remorse.
“I… I…” The Dragon blinked, seeming to tremble once with the force of some unseen emotion. Sherlock’s voice was filled heavily with reluctance, and a fear that he was working to hide but could be seen in the shifting patterns of rolling reds and greens of his scales. John stared at the Dragon, knowing somehow instinctively what his friend was about to acquiesce to. He felt his stomach twist itself into knots, and very suddenly the rest of the crowd faded away in his ears, turning into white noise. He felt rather than heard Sherlock’s presence in his own mind, caressing his thoughts as gently as one might kiss another’s cheek. It was an action that caused the soldier to shudder in Mike and Bill’s grip.
He grinned at the last bit, eyes sharpening in a predatory way again. He reached out almost casually and stroked a White Collars' head, grabbing a lock of her soft ginger hair and bringing it to his lips in the mockery of a kiss before he laughed at her petrified growls and turned towards the exit. His last words rang in John's ears, echoing dreadfully down the halls in bell-like shivers.
John grinned a bit, watching as the Selkie sulkily rubbed the spot where the rock had come into contact. The soldier saw a bit of the child he had once known in the petty wrinkling of Sherlock’s nose, lordly disgust at the world making John fight a smile even as he curled the stone close to his lips, breathing hot air over its surface. Sherlock watched, reluctantly fascinated even as John once again pressed the stone to the skin of the Selkie’s arm. The soldier’s voice was indulgent, quiet as he gifted Sherlock with new vocabulary. “That is
The detective counted down slowly, and all too soon reached one. Half-holding his breath, Sherlock waited for the change, any clue of a shift, and was not disappointed.
Sherlock’s gaze was measured as he made sure that John was paying him attention. The Human’s eyes widened as he saw Sherlock bring the fruit to his lips, biting into the fruit so that it crunched with a clear, crisp sound. John watched as the Water-Spirit chewed thoughtfully, bowed lips stained purple-pink by the fruit’s juice. When he swallowed, John felt something peculiar shudder through his body, there then gone.
The word was not a typical nickname for Hatchlings, nor was it true Dragon-Tongue. It was an old language, the language of royalty. It was not entirely a nickname, but a title. It was one Mycroft knew and loved, something he shared with his family:
That joy soon dissipated however upon his return into his own home, the shadows of two figures standing in his living room sending reality crashing back to him. John looked at Sherlock, who seemed a little pale but otherwise healthy, feeling a prickle of apprehension consume him. He had earlier tied the Selkie up for a reason, and with him now free John could see the smooth, predatory muscle along the Selkie’s bare abdomen and shoulders. Combined with the added backup of his brother, John knew that he would stand no chance, not if Sherlock truly decided that he wanted him.
Sherlock mused to himself, tossing his coat onto a hook reflexively and suddenly itching for a cigarette. However he knew that if John came back to himself, he'd be angry. In fact, he might be angry in any case as it was, considering he would probably taste the nicotine in his own mouth and smell it on his clothes. Then there was the whole “Secret” being out, if John was even aware of his condition. Not everyone was, from what Sherlock remembered in his studying. Some people lived for years, not even considering the Blackouts as anything other than exhaustion or coincidence. Some people didn't even Blackout, but were aware of what was going on the entire time. It was a complicated condition with little actually known about it. His mind whirred with analyzation, allowing himself a small smile at the fact that at least this was
Sherlock shrugged then, the sharp jut of his collarbone flexing under John’s head. The ex-army doctor resisted the urge to berate the detective’s faked nonchalance. It was evident from the stiffness in Sherlock’s voice that he was uncomfortable. Social conventions did not work easily for him, and even now John could taste the words his companion was leaving unsaid. Things like the bullying at school, because of course Sherlock would face that, things like the guilt over being a main reason of conflict between his parents. They were there though, all written just under Sherlock’s skin. It just took a while to see, to understand.
an anxious thing when there’s politics going on- which is nearly all the time here, as of late. Ryuk here tells me that not a day goes by where the poor girl isn’t fluttering over some imaginary issue. ” Rania apologised in an easy kind of grace as she patted her Dragon’s head, sightless eyes crinkling with her smile as she took a sip of tea before continuing. The pleasant expression faded away with the weight of her news however, Ryuk shifting about her neck, bristling as if under threat.  “I do hope I am not inconveniencing either of you with my request, but I’m afraid after the events of a few nights ago, I fear for my own safety should I continue to live in the palace without protection.”
Kandahar was the kind of place that looked like it had once been a thriving city, black-top and pavement left to crack and in a state of disrepair, sand drifting into every possible crevice and pore. The buildings were white or tan brown, and they stood with the precarious nature that old houses took on when they were left to neglect. Despite the dilapidated nature of the structures before them, John saw many people peering curiously out of their windows at the progression of soldiers, their faces of all colour and race, but the majority of them wore desert-like traits. Weathered skin, dark eyes and dust-covered curls peeked from around bullet-riddled walls, and adults and children alike glanced at them with a mixture of suspicion and grudging respect.
Mycroft hissed in response, his own eyes glowing with uncharacteristic fury.  “You’re irritable, more so than usual. Can’t think any more, can you? Likely feel sick, drained and lethargic. You’re barely standing as it is! Sherlock,
Even more frustrating was the unwanted presence of the man in the suit. He came with annoying predictability, always at four, and always clean-pressed and with a vaguely disapproving air about him. Sherlock tried hiding from him at first, using his form to climb or curl into alcoves in the halls or to tuck himself into closets or under his bed. Yet Mycroft seemed to have an innate sense of his presence, and would invariably enter the room he’d sought his escape in. He brought with him tea, sometimes food if he thought it might be a day Sherlock would be inclined to eat. He offered information on John’s welfare like treats, and the Dragon found he had trouble resisting the offerings.
He only had a second to gather his somewhat petulant and stunned thoughts before he was being hoisted up into a sitting position by his shirt collar. John’s blue eyes burned into his with fury as he was lifted in a rather startling display of physical strength. Daniel’s Scottish lilt was low and threatening, hissing into his ear.
Before he could linger on the image too closely however, Dodge cleared her throat to gain everyone's attention.
“First rule to being the partner of a Holmes, you have to know how to get them to leave you alone when you need it. Having a spine is the only way you’re gonna avoid getting walked all over.” His dark eyes twinkled with mischief, but there was a serious note to his words. Greg set his cup down, rubbing his hands together as if gathering his thoughts.
There had been nothing, and as the evening came upon them with a blood red sunset, John had felt his abdomen tighten with unease. As night fell and even Molly’s chattering drew to an awkward close, John felt himself beginning to sweat as the percolations of his fears took over the forefront of his mind.
Wordlessly Sherlock nodded an affirmative to John. He had managed a few hours, and though it wouldn’t be enough for most to claim as a “restful” slumber, it was enough for the detective to function.
“Your head of forensics is stealing opiates and pocketing them on the side. Not that he’ll find many of them here, in a heroin and crack den.” It was the accent that caught Lestrade’s attention, polished and crisp where most of the people he brought in had the rounded edges of the lower class. His eyebrows rose as the bundle of rags shifted, revealing under a mass of greasy, raven curls a pair of eyes that had pupils blown but were still very startlingly aware. It was a kid, or what Lestrade would have considered to be a kid. Really, it was a young adult. The man’s sallow complexion and obvious starvation made judging his age hard to tell, but the D.I could see enough under the rags to tell that they were probably no older than early twenties. A mouth that was chapped and bleeding from sunlight exposure was pursed in annoyance, and nervous hands tapped away on knees that had bones pressing out from the skin like knives.
Not even when as Sherlock turned and guided John away, Claude looked back at the man with wide, tear-filled eyes, and mouthed an apologetic
The atmosphere was arid and hot on John's face as he walked down the steps away from the plane. It hit him like a slap, making him wince and suck in a breath. His uniform felt too big and loose on his frame, nearly dwarfing him and hanging heavy on his shoulders. It made him feel as though he were a little boy again, dressing up in his grandfather's old uniform and pretending to do drills with the other kids. The memory floated in his mind as he roughly lugged his rucksack over his shoulder, swallowing his apprehension. Kandahar. Or at least, what was left of it.
the Bond even got to this state, John had little memory. The incident of his shooting was hazy, to the point where he’d had to ask if Hajera had even lived through the onslaught. What John could remember was mostly pain, and dreams that felt more like visions. He didn’t know what it meant, and from Sherlock John had only managed to pry out slivers of information. The Dragon had seemed to be carrying well-concealed guilt, and John didn’t understand but he was bloody determined that once he was out of his blasted bed, he’d find out why. He didn’t like being coddled, it set his teeth on edge.
When John finally slumped against him in defeat, Sherlock nearly didn’t hear the exhausted whisper. As it was, he did.
“I’d like to see that,” he huffed, shoving his hands into his dress pockets. Mycroft couldn’t help but notice how Greg’s eyes were illuminated by the goblets of sputtering gold fire placed in intervals throughout the room as he looked around. His gaze finally seemed to land on Mycroft, a small smile curving on his face. “I guess we have some time to kill, at least. What do Northern Dragons do for fun?”
All Sherlock felt were the beginnings of boredom and annoyance trickling in his veins. The figures below were like sheep, awaiting an unknown fate in the dark with wide eyes and panicked expressions. Dull, all of them. A part of Sherlock’s colder side wondered if they didn’t deserve these fall evenings, the huntings and the slaughter. After all, in a way his kind were the first to contract with humanity, even before the Fae and the elves and centaurs. Once a year they fed, and then they left humans alone for 364 days, gorging themselves on leftovers to tide over the leaner months. It was a simple trade, but one that the humans seemed to have forgotten. Sherlock could already see that this year, the village had been more properly fortified. His eyes narrowed, feeling the prickle of magic in the air that made the back of his neck tingle with warning. He called out to Molly, warning his Darklings.
To the Detective's utter surprise, a growling and yet familiar voice responds. Its' laced with a Welsh accent, and its' far angrier than Sherlock's ever heard it before, but there's no mistaking the lilt to it. The base tone.
The girl shook her head, trying to dislodge Daniel's nattering inside her ear so she could respond. Outside, John's body jerked slightly in response, twitching with annoyance.
In the bathroom, loud splashing noises could be heard. John figured the floor was probably soaking wet by now, as his new Draconian housemate seemed determined to spill half of his bath all over the tiles. He rubbed at his face tiredly and sighed, figuring he'd probably have to apologize to Mrs. Hudson for that. Yet another thing on John's long list of
John realised then how lonely he felt, how fragile. Big, angry tears threatened to fall again and he bit his lip harshly. To his surprise, Sherlock seemed to understand, if only a little.
John could feel the Dragon was retreating back into his calculated stare again, the sensation prickling the hair on the back of his neck. He refused to lower his gaze from those cold irises, and he smiled nervously.
Merina Watson often found herself rubbing at the temples of her forehead, continuously stressed by her children's bickering as well as her husband's stubborn refusal to address the issues she sought to solve. Often she could be found sitting on the front step, moodily clutching at a cup of tea and staring out at the endless ocean waves, remembering her childhood upon the shore below. John soon learned that tea calmed his mum in a way nothing else seemed to, and quickly asked his grandmother to teach him the secret of the kettle and tea leaves. Though he was not allowed to make it on his own lest he set fire to the house of himself, John soon could be seen in the kitchen, watching the water in the kettle boil with large, serious blue eyes.
That unfortunately, was the moment Mike gently tapped on her bedroom door, wondering if his Dragon wanted any breakfast. He had just been getting ready to go out on a date with a nice girl he'd met at the café down the road, and had even put on a new cologne she had bought him. He opened the door just in time to see Molly's expression crack in fear before he was very suddenly being thrown backwards, and the young soldier cracked his head against the wall and saw stars.
John looked up before he could stop himself, staring at Sherlock with surprise. His Dragon's brows were furrowed in confusion and their blue orbs glowed with something that wasn't quite fear, but
Sherlock's throat burned with the effort it took to stop the strange lump from conquering his composure. He
The thought was petty and vindictive, but John really couldn’t bring himself to care. Not when he was absolutely shuddering with the aftershocks of nerves, and most certainly not when he could still hear the straining of the bed springs, if he listened carefully.
Too late, John realised what the idiot was about to do. Lunging for the skinny git, his cry of fear as Sherlock
The other soldiers in the line-up had their Dragons transform as well, snapping their fingers or uttering a short command. Sherlock did not wait for John's mental request, instead crouching to strip his uniform from his body and folding the clothes into a neat pile on the desert floor. He then transformed, skin mottling over to a thousand different shades of blue-silver-red, settling only when John found himself standing in the shadow of his Dragon's true form. Hand instinctively reaching up to stroke Sherlock's frost-cold snout, John could still not bring himself to quite believe the
Conrad could hear the footsteps running towards him. He is surprised that he recognizes their lilt and their timbre, as he has done his best up until now to ignore Sherlock Holmes and his very existence. Gritting his teeth, he doesn't bother to open his eyes as the Detective bolts from the cab he's taken and unerringly towards the alley he's tucked himself into, deep baritone shouting over the noise of London in exclamation.
This was what lead John to staring at the date after they moved the final piece of furniture down to Sherlock’s room, mentally tallying up his plan. January fourth. Two days from the detective’s birthday. Not that Sherlock had said anything, he seemed determined to pretend as if he had come into the world fully formed, already spouting deductions and trouncing about in his great coat.
Sure enough, Bill’s cot was empty. John was forced to push away the rising anxiety bubbling up his throat over Sherlock, jumping down from his bunk to search for his uniform. Without another word Dodge turned and left, tent flaps billowing behind her. John laced his shoes, his thoughts silently calling out for his Dragon, so far unanswered.
It was only when he knocked on Mike Stamford's door that John realised with a distant kind of horror that he had neglected to tell Mrs. Hudson he was going out.
Mrs. Hudson (As she had introduced herself to him cheerily) didn't seem to much care for Sherlock's obvious barriers around his horde. Though she was careful not to step directly into his little corner of territory, she had a tendency to flutter just outside on the edge. Though Sherlock snarled at her
It sort of happened, after a bunch of the men and women from town coerced him into a drinking game after the children had all been sent home. John had never been terribly lucky at cards, and he soon found the cup they handed him filled with an impressive concoction that had he been a little more sober to begin with he likely would not have drunk.
There was the sound of crackling parchment, the faint smell of smoke. Cerioth felt sour helplessness lodge itself in his gut as the footsteps receded beyond his hearing.
John shifted unconsciously in his sleep as the first pattering drum-roll began outside. His mind did not recognise the sound, and so it made sense that he’d shift, sleepily opening his eyes and blearily watching as the window that he faced became blurred, streaked with water. He couldn’t make sense of the image, tired as he was. Yet somehow, he could make sense of the shadowy figure that stood silhouetted in the evening clouds, silently commanding the monsoon that occurred outside. Sherlock’s head was tilted upwards, and his lips were slightly parted in the dark, as if he were caught in the midst of deepest pleasure. His hands spread out beside him, and with the strike of lightning outside he appeared positively luminescent, a ghost.
Though it was an order, it was a gentle one. Cerioth listened automatically, fingers cupping the jingling ring of metal tightly before releasing it into her waiting palm. The edges of the keys glinted in the sunset, dark gold and blazing silver. It reminded the Dragon of precious treasure, and his base instincts absurdly found comfort in their shine. Still it did not last long, and he soon found himself drifting slightly again as he reflected on the past, Dodge's words to John ringing in his head.
John was only startled out of his people-watching by a light voice, commenting towards him across from the truck.
, now the blonde felt anger well in him, his teeth clenching in annoyance. It was with more force than he’d intended that he spat his accusations.
John mistook it for longing, but then again, that's exactly what it was. Even if Sherlock was loathe to admit it.
The detective sneered, eyes flashing cruelly as he towered over John. At his full height Sherlock was terrifying, menacing, and John had a dizzying moment of wondering what Sherlock must have been like as a woman, nearly five foot nine and made of thunder.
His mother bit her lip as he turned uncaringly away, her eyes burning after him even as Sherlock concentrated, brought forth his instrument into existence. It was a stringed beauty, polished and with a bow that he grasped in one hand. His fingers danced over the neck with reverence, ignoring Lana’s ire. It was easier that way, to ignore her desperation.
He would watch those bodies kick and flail, unable to breathe when he so easily could, lean towards their life source and energy, slowly slipping away into the water. He thought he could taste it, if he only got close enough.
Sitting on the park bench, John held Sherlock's hand in his own. The Dragon's face though petulant, was filled with a warmth well hidden by exasperation.
Always variations of the same thing, time and again. Ever since he'd been first introduced to therapy, due to his lingering fears as a child. Irrational things, sleepwalking shadows that he imagined would come to take him away, their sweet songs at once a vague memory as much as a hallucination. Sometimes, he'd wake to find himself halfway down the stairs of his home, jacket and shoes on.
so I do not do something that will damage my palace, and you in it.” John fell silent, realising that though the thunder had dissipated, the clouds had not. They were amalgamating around Sherlock in fact, above his head in a black wreath that sat like a weight. They came down, encircling Sherlock, lifting him into the air.
had described the blackouts in the past, that fact was a strange and rare occurrence. Normally, the army doctor admitted to changing his personalities anywhere from once to twice a week, and never the same personality, judging from the situations that
“There are plenty of books in the library.” Sherlock offered, but John merely shook his head. He sunk his towed head further into his pillows, staring up at the plain white ceiling in defeat.
Gems as a race tended to choose their forms to best-suit their purpose. In the old ways of Gem Homeworld, a caste system had once existed that had been rigidly upheld. Though that caste didn’t exist to the same extent on Earth, many Gems still chose their forms to best suit what they would have once been made for. The pretty ones did showings, the strong ones became gym instructors or action stars, and the brilliant ones… well, John assumed that they either ended up like Sherlock, or actually earned respectable careers.
Sherlock dreamed of cool fingers wiping away the blackness, and very quietly murmured something in Dragon-Tongue in his sleep that made Cerioth's bright eyes stare with a silent kind of longing at the impossible expanse of open field stretching to their left towards The Wilds beyond. It was only for an instant, but the servant felt a pair of dark blue eyes on him and knew that the young man in the back seat was possibly far more observant than even he himself knew.
Yet Shyla… she was always stirring up trouble it seemed. He didn’t like to think that this might be a rather underhanded cry for attention, but truth be told it wouldn’t have surprised him much. She was constantly blowing up things, lying to people and even once when she had been younger she’d gone to a police investigation, accusing the police of “bad investigating” and claiming that some child had been murdered instead of drowned.
It distracted John enough that he didn't think about how he'd have to somehow mix soap into the equation to thoroughly clean the Dragon. Or that eventually, he'd be forced to get close enough to him to treat his wing. There had been so much grime covering the creature's skin that his complexion had been more grey than white, though the fever may have been partly to blame.
The barb was only mildly effective, considering the tense curve of the man’s spine lessened with a mere passing of John’s fingers through his halo of curls. His ring glinted, silver and gold in the afternoon sun pouring into
, a place that apparently had such a wide variety of spices in their Chow Mein that the lanky Detective had bothered to store its' name in his Mind-Palace. He rambled easily at John about how to recognize quality Chinese food even as the bell chimed over their heads, jingling pleasantly and informing the staff of their arrival. They get a table that's near the window, greeted by a pretty Asian waitress that has her long, dark tresses tied back with a pink ornamental hairpin. John smiles at her warmly, thankful to be in the company of beautiful women and surprisingly enough a good friend. Sherlock's hands smooth themselves against the deep red tablecloth as he picks up the plastic menu, dark curls peeking from just above the top and blocking his expression (which had acquired a peculiar level of sulking when he noticed the Doctor's attentions and where they lay) from John's view. Pouring himself a cup of green tea and humming in pleasure at it's relaxing flavour, the blonde Doctor sat back and marvelled again at how everything seemed so, well..... peaceful.
sweet. Though it wasn't much, it was enough. John blinked, for just an instant coming back to himself, only to find the creature's hands wrapped about his throat. The little boy did only what he thought he could: lashing out, John kicked the pale boy right where he knew it would count.
it clicked finally for John, making his distress and inner fear soften into something slow and painful. Sherlock constantly felt as if he was only a breath away from losing complete control of his life, his body, his very home. For someone
He told himself this even as his leg twinged his pain as he descended down the stairs of the deck, and his left hand trembled minutely at his side.
The knocking continued as he reached the bottom step, and John darted into the living room to see that Sherlock was eyeing the front door with a mixture of interest and apprehension. He darted his gaze towards John, head tilted in question. John in return shrugged, unable to give much by way of an answer.
Sherlock made it, flinging himself forward just as a bullet cracked through the air. The Dragon watched in slow motion, seeing the donkey-drawn cart in the distance judder with the hit. He watched through eyes that were at once his own and yet not as a blonde figure crumpled, falling from the seat. The Dragon felt a ghostly echo of agony tear its way through his shoulder.
“Astute observation.” The detective said dryly, even though the corner of his mouth ticked with something automatic and restless. Sherlock watched as Sneak seemed to hone in on the action like a cat, head tilting to the side in predatory instinct as he let puzzle pieces come together from previous conversation.
“…I think; I mean I hope… I want to love him, y’know? It’s just… hard when the choice was taken from me. From him.”
harmful ones.” Mycroft's lips twitched, and Sherlock's hands tightened, curling in at his chest. This was not his brother. This was not
He fumed, and with his anger smoke blew from his flared nostrils. Sherlock tensed in response, growling a warning just in time before heedless of his collar-bone, the patient transformed.
Feeling not for the last time as if he was a pawn being jerked about a chess board, John felt his feet pulling forward against his will, towards the direction of the cottage. He could only gather enough control on his way to scoop up the half-filled pail of water, which had made its way meticulously back to shore, the way most things lost at sea did.
The only one who saw was Sebastian Wilkes, who approached the young man while he was reading in the solitude of the library, asking for tutoring in exchange for a bag of white powder. Sherlock's cerulean blue eyes picked out instantly what the rich young man wanted, and what he had to offer.
Lestrade clicked his tongue against his teeth in thought, searching for a memory that might comfort John. This was rather difficult, as he was not entirely certain what upset the man in the first place. He could make an educated guess, as Mycroft had spoken (rather, ranted) about the deal that had been made between the three of them.
John’s heart monitor was a steady blip, and Sherlock willed it to keep on being steady. “One day, sentinels on the mountain found a trespasser. It was not a Dragon, in fact, it was something the Dragons had never interacted with before. A human man. The man was amazed with what he had stumbled onto, and claimed that he came peacefully. He had heard stories of our kind, and had come to learn. The king, kind but foolish, believed him.”
very often. He feels rather than sees shadows shift in the darkness, possibly preparing to subdue him if necessary. He feels his body tense, preparing for battle. Even if he loses, he'll do his damnedest to ensure that at least one other person goes down with him. He'd have to make sure he was quick about it though, because he can feel his control slipping. John is waking up, fighting him subconsciously.
At the beginning of the last week, Dodge phoned John to let him know that he had a day to get Sherlock used to the idea of her bringing Cerioth over for the equivalent of a 'play-date'.
John felt a dull flush rise from his neck to his cheeks, surprise etched into his features. Some of it must have showed, because the woman laughed a little, the sound clear and bright.
Sherlock could remember the first time he considered killing someone, and it lingered with him to this day, though he knew not the circumstance in which it happened, nor what land could be so blessedly cold and remote that he could feel completely at room temperature.
Finally, she took a deep, explosive breath. It made John's chest heave, his blue eyes fluttering closed as if dispelling the ghost of a nightmare. Claude mumbled her answer as she faded away, tone quaking slightly as she whispered her purpose. The terror in her voice sent a faint chill trickling down Sherlock's spine.
Yet the detective seemed utterly intent on the puzzle, and it took John a while to realise why. Sherlock held a nervous energy about him throughout most of the week, darting around John as if he were sitting in a bonfire. He was erratic, often trailing off in his sentences, and he would not look John in the eye. They did not speak of the Fusion, and John was reluctant to bring it up himself, their relationship somehow fragile.
must be aware that there are quote on quote “freaky” things about me that have nothing to do with my physical body.”
Many things were much the same, the mirrors refusing to show his reflection until he would run a hand over them, the many hand-carved chests looking black and muted until he set to polishing them with a rag. Once John set his mind to make a place somewhat habitable, he didn't stop. Slowly, the man worked his way to the large fireplace in the centre of the living room, and he knelt to check and see if the flue was clear and relatively clean.
“Come on, little one. You can do it. We're only just beginning, can't give up now.” He pressed a hand then to the egg, smoothing his palm over it. John felt something hot and hard lodge itself in his throat as he felt only coolness. Above him Sherlock shook.
“No matter what you happens, you mustn't let go of my hand.” John opened his mouth to ask why, but the words felt heavy and slow in his throat. It seemed like between one blinking second and the next, the world he knew was pitched forward, tilted so he had no choice but to slide. Slide John did, down into blackness thick and impenetrable. Only the sturdy warmth of the hand looped in his own kept John from screaming in surprise. Together, he and Sherlock tumbled, deep into a dream world, and deeper still into John’s mind.
“Sheet music. And an ally. I want to work with as many of the Alters as I can, and I need someone to defend my corner when I
They came to the rock face they would have to climb to reach the cove, sharp and jagged edges rising high into the sky like a mountain they had to pass. Without preamble John leapt up, gripping the first foothold with his sandalled toe and heaving himself upwards. Mike soon followed, not eager to be left behind. They clamoured over the slick stone, giggling to one another light-heartedly until John nearly slipped and came perilously close to cracking his skull open on a rock. Then they treaded with more care.
Once actually in the room, John had struggled to find a way to restrain the creature, should it arise and panic or worse. Eventually, the army doctor's thoughts had flicked to his grandmother's old fishing boat, tied not far on the moor of the beach. All but running, John had collected the heavy twine rope that had knotted it in place, feeling only a slight and brief remorse for beaching the vessel so that he could properly tie the Selkie down. John had never been one for knotwork, but he could manage a basic set of ties. The rope was long enough to do the job, and soon he was faced with the sight of a very tall, very naked man completely bound to a bed, unconscious. For a moment, the army doctor couldn't help but shake his head, marvelling at how far he had already fallen. Once upon a time if someone had told him that this sight would be in his future, he would have laughed. Long and hard.
Sherlock's voice was as remote as a still pool of water, yet it held in it a kind of intensity. The depth of his timbre sent shudders through the other personalities, and Sneak's smile only widened in delight at the sensation, rippling across his thoughts like a wave.
as he dumped his second bag of ice into the mix. He only turned it off after the tub was half-full, dipping his hand in and shivering as it came away dripping and ice-cold.
John was getting used to feeling like he was walking on eggshells in his own home, and it frustrated him and made him despair in equal amounts. He felt like he had been so close to getting Sherlock to open up, so
The sight warmed Greg, because until that moment he had rarely seen Sherlock smile. Now he offered the tiniest of upturned mouths towards the D.I, hidden by the time he reached the crime scene and corpse. The detective’s voice rang out across the street, spouting deductions at full throttle, showing off genius casually and confidently with a voice that didn’t shake from spinning highs or crushing lows. Sherlock was happy, at least until one of the forensics team recognised him as the man who aided in benching Benson.
Sherlock beamed proudly, hands fingering the scarf about his throat like it was the most precious thing he had ever received.
Sherlock could feel his Mate’s concern, despite the fact that he was working on trying to block out the tide of emotion and thought that was becoming the dangerous norm for the two of them. It was built on the fact that Sherlock could admit that he was, in fact, going mad with forced inactivity. There was only so much physical activity one could do, before white walls drove one to do something drastic. Sherlock had grown so used to confinement, that his taste of relative freedom during wartime had made it unacceptable. His mind played tricks on him, made the walls feel as if they were pressing against his skin. So to fight the inexplicable urge within him to scream, he demanded that Mycroft give him something to occupy his mind.
