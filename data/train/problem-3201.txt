. Right.
Cas was hurt, and Dean wasn’t there. His mind wandered as terrible scenes flashed before his eyes. Cas lying broken and helpless. He squeezed his eyes shut tight, but it couldn’t block out the paralyzing terror he felt.
“And stay out!” Dean yells after it. That goddamn cat is always leaving dead mice everywhere and pissing on his lawn. And it’s forever staring at him and hissing. He’s half convinced it’s possessed.
Dean’s eyebrow arched and he broke into a wicked grin. “Oh really?”
“Well it’s not like you need sleep anyway, right?”
“Gosh, you’re cute,” Cas muttered. “Fine, here. You can try some.” He offered the cat a noodle and she sniffed at it. She took a tentative lick, and then wrinkled her nose. But she watched Cas carefully as he ate his dinner, and when he was done, he offered her the bottom of the bowl where a few bits of macaroni remained. She sniffed at it delicately, then with no grace whatsoever, shoved her head completely into the bowl and licked at the sides. She cleaned most of it up, and when she pulled back, her face and whiskers were covered in cheese. She sneezed again, and it flew everywhere.
Sam spluttered. Evidently he had given Dean a drink the previous night to combat his allergies to cats. Something stronger than Benadryl, as the girl Dean was trying to hook up with lived with several and he hadn't yet been able to spend the night on account of how sick they made him.
“You’re both crazy.” Dean scowled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean stared, aghast.
“Absolutely not. If we take on a boarder, I won’t get to watch you cook naked on Sundays anymore.”
Ignoring him, Dean made his way to the kitchen where he found a note from Cas:
Charlie, it's still so good to see her face again. Her laughter fills the room, and with it, Castiel can almost see Dean's spirit growing lighter again.
came the sound of Balthazar from the far corner of the room.
Dean smiled back, but for whatever reason, he hadn’t sat down yet. He just stood there, with a soft look on his face. Then his gaze dropped to the floor and he shuffled a bit on the spot, scuffing his bare foot on the floor.
Dean stares resolutely at the ceiling, trying to act calmer than he feels.
“Oh thank God,” Dean groaned, and slammed his book shut. Cas perked up, and looked curiously at Sam.
He was saved by an incoming call from the garage where his car was being kept, and Dean excused himself, hoping to hear that his baby was nearly ready to go. It was a quick job, and Dean wanted to do the work himself; the garage was just going to get him the part he needed. Or at least, he thought they were going to.
The plane jolted terribly.
Later that night, Cas presses soft kisses all down the inside of Dean’s thighs and swallows around him. He makes a valiant effort, and normally Dean’s dick would be very appreciative of the swirls Cas’s tongue is making— the way he hollows his cheeks and trails one finger a little further back. But tonight, Dean finds himself a little too distracted by stray thoughts about Cas’s strange behaviour, making it difficult for him to… fully participate.
Cas sent a very long reply.
It was nothing like kissing him as a frog. A lot less slimy, for one thing.
"Meg's been here almost nine months now," Cas says. "Nobody seems to want her."
-----
"Cas?" Dean gave his shoulder a desperate squeeze. Cas winced, and the relief that flooded through Dean was palpable. It was only then that Dean realized that the wings were… wings. Not the etched shadows he had seen on dead angels before, but actual feathered wings. Huge and jet black, with a deep iridescent blue along the tip of each feather. He pulled back, suddenly reticent to touch them, unable to do anything but stare in complete awe.
Dean shifts uncomfortably. “Well, we can’t use our hands, so we’re useless on our own. But if we teamed up. . .”
Again, Cas grabs his arm to steady him. He gently pries Dean’s hands away from where he’s yanking at Cas’s tie in frustration; the knot keeps getting tighter and tighter, unyielding no matter how many times Dean’s done this before and been smooth as fuck about it.
you hate cats. I didn't think you'd be interested."
It’s no use and the conviction with which Cas says this is unsettling to Dean. So he changes the subject to Kelly and the nephilim.
~~~~~
Castiel freezes, a cold dread trickling down his spine. He thinks back again to the field he woke up in— his first solid memory after the rift. How
“Nothing.” Dean clears his throat, stands, and stretches. His t-shirt lifts to show a sliver of his belly. It’s trimmer than Castiel remembers, and he misses the softness of before. He’ll suggest they stop for a proper lunch today and find a burger joint somewhere.
“You’re staying, right?” Dean looks at Cas nervously. He needs to make sure.
“I’m sorry,” Dean mumbled. “I’ll uh—I can go. I just—”
“Right.”
He was in the middle of typing out an apology text when he got a reply from Cas.
Sam and Mary are both apologetic and Sam gives his assurances that Dean will be better in the morning once he’s had a chance to sleep it off. Cas isn’t so sure.
They stare at each other for what feels like forever. In only a few short minutes, everything has changed and the weight of it hangs heavy in the silence between them.
He nipped lightly at Dean’s pulse point and Dean swore under his breath.
Relief flooded through Dean, fast and fierce. He started towards Cas on instinct, wanting nothing more than to take him in his arms, hold on tight, and never let go. But he stopped short when he saw the look of fear in Cas’s eyes and his defensive posturing. Dean swayed on the spot in mid step before carefully setting his foot down and doing his best to stay where he was standing.
Dean’s head shot up and he spun around to shield his ass from view.
Dean had intended to remain silent as well to preserve his concentration, but lasted all of ten seconds before blurting out everything that was swirling in his head.
Cas has been coming home late from work. More than that, Cas has been coming home late from a job he
“Hey Sammy, don’t wait up,” Dean said. “If things go well, I might not be back all weekend.”
Cas is alive. He’s safe. Everything’s fine.
Dean always hated storms. As a child, thunder would shake the house and wake him at night, as he huddled shaking beneath blankets.
The monster looked about as baffled as Dean felt. The knife, just now hurtling through the air, was nowhere to be seen.
Castiel stares at him in something resembling surprise. “Oh, hello Dean. I didn’t see you there.”
Eileen left the table to answer a facetime call from a friend back home. While she was gone, Sam outlined the differences between a divorce and an annulment for them.
When Dean said nothing, Bobby let out a long-suffering sigh. “Is it Castiel?” he finally asked.
“I uh…” Castiel knew he stared too much. It was hard not to, what with those freckles and that smile. And those bright green eyes that Castiel just wanted to drown in. It would be bad enough if it was just that Dean was good looking. Cas felt certain he would have been able to handle that because he was so rarely affected by attractive people. He could appreciate when someone was aesthetically pleasing by conventional standards, but that was usually where it ended for him. But with Dean it had been different. Dean had gone and been a wonderful, kind, caring person to boot, and Cas was completely screwed. The more he got to know Dean, the more his hopeless little crush had festered.
Cas squints up at him and Dean shrugs. “Come on. Get your rodent and let’s go home. It’ll be just like the sleepovers we had when we were kids.”
“I’m fine, Dean.”
An arm emerged from the blankets beneath him, accompanied by a deep yawn.
Dean, as it turned out, did not have a suit to wear to the wedding that night. Not that anyone could blame him, really. It’s not like he’d expected to show up in Vegas and need a monkey suit for a wedding, of all things.
Dean’s forehead dropped to bump against Cas’s and they looked down together at the sight of them sliding together. Dean managed to get his hand around them both. It was dry, and a little too rough, but so fucking good he was close to breaking apart.
“No, what?” Dean asked. He leaned forward and slid a little closer to Cas, concerned.
“You don’t fly,” Cas said flatly.
“You can stay with me, just for tonight,” Dean decided. “Someone should keep an eye on you.”  He shut the door so Cas couldn’t get far if he decided to go exploring and set the bowl down on his bedside table.
~~~~~
"I'm interested in anything that makes you this happy, Cas. I'm sorry you didn't feel like you could share it with me."
“Oil gland,” Cas said, breathlessly. He pulled at Dean’s sticky hand, guided it down between them and Dean meant to laugh, meant to make some joke about Cas having the preparedness of a boy scout, but Cas thrust up and the laughter died on his lips, replaced with embarrassingly needy whine.
Cas, though, did not smile, and his frown deepened.  “Dean, why are you in my living room?” he asked, and the voice that Dean loved twisted a little darker, more menacing.
“And I said I was sorry.” Castiel scowls. “I made a new pot, didn’t I?”
Castiel moves to sit next to him, but Dean stops him.
“I don’t want a divorce.”
"I can help you unwind," Dean insists. "And I don't mind your bad moods either. For better or for worse, right?"
“I really wanted to have her here to give you, but Charlie wouldn’t budge on that. She said—”
Cas grins. “Lets just say that next time it might be wise to shower first and lay off the grilled cheese beforehand.”
“Alright, that’s it,” Dean said, straightening up. “We’re watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But first, I need to get you a better playlist. You got a laptop I can download stuff on?”
What if Dean’s like the dentist three towns over, and even though Cas could find someone better, he won’t ever leave Dean because he’s so bad at breakups? What if Dean is the ugly fucking centipede that Cas just feels sorry for?
Holding him down, he took Dean into his mouth fully, swallowing him down. Dean let out a ragged moan and his hands flew up to tangle in Cas’s hair. It was almost unbearable, the tight, wet heat of his mouth, and Dean’s body began to lock up, muscles clenching. Just when he thought he was about to lose it, Cas pulled off and looked up to meet Dean’s eyes.
“You’ve got a bit of a bump,” Cas observed. He smoothed back Dean’s hair, and pressed a soft, chaste kiss to his forehead.
“Is he okay?” Cas asked.
“But I’m not gay,” Dean protested.
A short time later, Dean had finished explaining the situation as best he could and Cas repeatedly assured a worried Dean that he was fine despite his bruised appearance.
“You have chemistry,” Eileen added with a wink.
Dean turns the key over, but she stands her ground and refuses to start. “What the hell?” He mutters.
"No,” Dean says, and Castiel can see the dawning horror on his face. “No, that can’t be.” Charlie remains silent, and so he turns, and looks imploringly at Castiel.
“Please.” There’s a note of desperation in Cas’s voice now. “Don’t leave me. Not like that.”
“Dean, is this okay?” he whispered, a note of pleading in his voice.
The call is brief. Dean's voice is cracked and broken sounding, and when Castiel speaks, the swirling, longing
It’s only then that it occurs to him, reality crashing down heavily. Their hands are healed. They have no reason anymore to be touching. Castiel pulls his hand away abruptly, willing it not to misbehave again, as his fingers flex, itching and desperate for Dean.
“I’d like that too, Cas.”
“Nope. Twin boys, actually. The other one is named Sam.”
They stumbled a few more feet down the hall and Cas managed to pin Dean to the wall on the other side of the hallway. He moved one knee between Dean’s legs and ground himself against Dean’s hip, letting out a low, stuttering moan.
Dean thought that Cas’s face might have darkened a bit at that, but he couldn’t be sure. A second later he was smiling again. “Absolutely, Dean.”
“Well you don’t have to go right now,” Sam said. “We haven’t even made it through one movie yet.”
Cas stared up at him and Dean felt himself flush. He stabbed at his eggs and shovelled them quickly into his mouth.
Castiel lets him in, a sinking feeling in his gut. This is it, Cas thinks. Dean is here to confirm his worst fears that their friendship has been fucked up beyond repair.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut tight, takes a deep breath and runs his tongue up the underside of Castiel’s shaft. The sight alone is almost more than Castiel can stand. Here is Dean, with his long lashes and his perfect mouth, on his knees in front of him. It’s the most beautiful thing Castiel’s ever—
Somehow the mug had remained in Dean's kitchen cupboards, in its own spot, only used whenever Cas was over.
“He’s too kind and soft-hearted for his own good, you know?” The ferret doesn’t answer him, of course, but Dean continues, feeling somewhat ridiculous but also relieved to spill his secrets to another sentient creature. “I can’t stop thinking about him. His stupid messy hair, and his blue eyes that make you just want to drown in them. And his stupid, perfect, kissable lips. God, Pimmy, I love him so much.” He lets out bitter, humorless laugh. “I’m going insane here. It’s unbearable, it’s—”
He used to have the same one all the time: his mom, trapped in the fire that killed her. Now, it’s Cas he dreams of trapped in the flames, screaming for Dean who’s unable to reach him. Every time he closes his eyes, Dean sees black smoke and tosses fitfully in and out of sleep each night. Sometimes, when it’s really bad, he’ll sneak out of his room, tiptoe down the hall, and peek in on Cas sprawled out on the couch. It’s stupid, he knows, and maybe even a little creepy. But he misses having Cas next to him, and being able to glance over for reassurance in the night that Cas is okay.
“I can’t believe I missed your bachelor party,” Dean groaned. “Please tell me there were strippers.”
Practice safe sex, kids. And please don't be like Dean. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed to see a doctor, get screened, or seek out treatment. STIs are far more common than the social stigma would have you realize.
“Hmmph,” John muttered. But then he met Dean’s eye and straightened up a bit, clearing his throat. “Congratulations, son.”
Dean Winchester was Sam’s older brother and a growing problem for Castiel. He would often pick Sam up from work, or drop him off, and more recently he had been stopping by during the day to bring Sam lunch or coffee. The problem was that Castiel couldn’t stop thinking about him. From the moment Dean had walked through his doors for the first time all those months ago, Castiel’s world had been off-kilter. Not to mention the fact that he seemed to lose all control of his fine motor functions in Dean’s presence. That first time he met Dean, Castiel had accidentally short circuited a lightbulb and sent sparks flying throughout the store– it was a wonder he hadn’t burnt the place down. Since then, he had been endlessly flustered in Dean’s presence.
“I’m not… I don’t know what… The fuck… look, I’m not gay,” Dean stammered.
Cas, for his part, was oblivious, and he dismissed her, only sparing her a polite shake of the head.
He clamps his mouth shut, and glares at the ceiling.
This isn’t how it was supposed to go.
“It was just a mugging, Dean,” he had said. “There’s not much to tell.”
He can't, however, say the same for himself, because the last thing he can remember is dying. He had come through the rift after Sam and Dean. Dean's face had looked relieved and then scared, contorted into something twisted and painful. There had been the sharp pierce of an angel blade, the blinding flash of his grace burning out. Dean had shouted something, and then. . . nothing.
Cas flexed his damaged wing gently towards Dean and gave a small grimace. “Just like any other wound.”
"Wait, wait," Dean said. "You experimented on me? With magic? What the fuck was that I drank?"
“Problem solved!” Sam’s smirk stretched so wide, Dean thought he might hurt himself.
Sam smirks. Dean glowers.
They debated at length about what to do with Cas during the night. Sam suggested they leave him on the table but Dean wasn’t so comfortable with that. What if he hopped off and got lost or crushed somewhere. Amidst their argument, Cas hopped into the glass bowl again, settling the decision for Dean. He scooped up the bowl and detoured through the kitchen first on his way to bed.
Dean relayed all this to Cas, the words spilling out of him in a rush as his memory returned.
Cas’s eyes snapped open and locked on him. “Thank you, Dean.” Cas leaned closer, his breath falling ragged between them. Dean’s own breath caught in his throat. “You can keep touching them if you want. I… don’t mind.”
“Hey, stop it!” The cat had climbed up into his bookshelves and had knocked several books off. She looked at him pointedly, then poked at another book with her paw. It toppled to the floor with a crash.
Castiel gets very little sleep that night. He can hear Dean snoring loudly in the next room while he lies awake worrying about the state of their friendship. He and Dean have always been close, but they’ve almost certainly crossed a line now that they may not be able to come back from.
“Dean,” Cas murmured, and Dean had never before heard his name uttered with such affection and desire– and Cas was leaning in further still.
“Don’t worry about it, Sam,” Cas sighed. “I’ll do it tomorrow. Go home.”
“You drove here?” Cas furrowed his brow. “Wouldn’t it have been faster to fly?”
“You kissed me,” Cas said. His voice was parched and more gravely than normal—if that were even possible—like he hadn’t spoken in days.
“I suppose.” Cas squinted at him. “Are you sure?”
Dean snorts. "That’s not exactly breaking news, Cas. God, you really need to leave that place. I hate what it’s doing to you."
Dean pulled back and gave Sam a firm pat on the back. “Guess this is goodbye for now?”
Dean is definitely not better in the morning. He shuffles into the kitchen and stops in his tracks at the sight of Cas sipping coffee and reading the paper. It’s all just so goddamn domestic and the irritation from yesterday flickers back to life as he thinks about what sort of cosmic consequences might be in store for the angel in his kitchen who’s drained the coffee pot and not bothered to start another.
Dean freezes in the doorway, unable to move when Cas glances up at him and smiles. It’s a smile Dean’s seen a million times before, but today it seems to change Cas’s face, lighting him up from within. Dean finds himself unable to move and hardly daring to breathe as the day before comes flooding back to him, and with it the reminder of how close he came to losing Cas.
“If this is supposed to be an apology, it’s terrible,” said Cas bluntly.
“I have to go,” he muttered, and scrambled out of bed.
“Yes,” Cas admits. “But never again. I killed him."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean grinned. “Let’s get this show on the road, shall we?”
Dean turned around to roll his eyes at Cas, but found that he'd wandered off. Alone, Dean made his way back in the direction of the food. Along the way a scantily clad Wonder Woman sidled up next to him and flicked her lasso against his thigh.
This isn’t how it was supposed to go.
Now that Castiel can safely open his eyes, he glances up to admire Dean, who is red-faced and still panting heavily.
“Oh Dean doesn’t fly,” said Sam, grinning.
They found the phone under the sofa, next to one of Dean’s shoes and a lamp that had been knocked off the end table and shattered on the floor. The bulb was broken and Cas carefully picked up the broken glass while Dean righted the lamp and straightened up with his phone.
Cas picks at a loose thread on his sweater. “Well, on paper it’s a great job but—”
It was true though, Dean had to admit. He had caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection of the huge TV screen and he looked pretty damn good. He sucked in his gut on the next turn and smoothed his hands over the lapels nervously.
A shadowy figure emerged slowly from around the corner of the kitchen. Dean cursed himself for not turning on more lights.
“Sam, I–” he started, but Sam cut him off and Dean figured that was for the best. He ruined everything, always.
He hears the door as soon as it opens, and Cas’s steps as he descends.
-----
They bicker back and forth until Cas relents and promises to at least think about it and Dean drags Cas upstairs to kiss away the worry lines around his eyes.
No answer. Dean sat at a table, drinking the latte, and staring at his phone. This was so stupid. What had he been thinking? He was halfway done the latte before panic well and truly set in.
“One time I told Dean he couldn’t watch this scary movie, but he snuck downstairs at night when John and I were in bed and watched it anyway. He was so scared he couldn’t sleep for weeks after that, but he was too stubborn to admit to it. When I finally got him to tell me what was wrong, he cried for hours and sulked all week. He was small enough then that I could hold him in my lap and sing him lullabies…” Mary trails off again looking wistful. “You know, I used to tell him angels were watching over him. I never imaged it would be quite so literal.”
Exhaustion sets in and the rest is a blur for Dean. But when he wakes up the next morning, rested, warm, and snuggled deep into his mattress that still remembers him six weeks later, he doesn’t wake up alone. He rolls over to see Cas sitting fully clothed on the other side of the bed, legs stretched out, and a book delicately balanced in his lap.
“Huh,” Sam mused. “I wonder if he can understand us. Do you think it’s still Cas in there?”
“Hey, did you know? He named a kid after you.”
Dean frowned. There was no way in hell he was sleeping tonight. But he really should go feed the damn bird. Cas’s apartment wasn’t far. He could get there, feed Balthazar, and be back in under an hour. Then he could stay, and he wouldn’t leave until he got to see Cas, and probably not then either.
“Cas,” Dean breathes and pushes him gently down onto the bed. He starts undoing buttons until they’re both bared to one another from the waist up. He kisses down Cas’s chest and towards his belly and Cas’s body thrums underneath him. Dean hovers over him, flooding his senses, and Cas can’t keep still, can’t get enough. He cranes his neck, desperate to kiss every part of Dean he can reach.
Cas started laughing, and hit pause on the movie. His nose scrunched up, and Dean felt laughter start to bubble up in him as well. They sat there on the floor laughing for far too long, and Dean was wheezing by the time they had started to calm down, not really sure why anything about this was so funny.
“We’ll see you for scary movie night, right?” Sam asked as he was leaving.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good," Dean murmured. His eyelids grew heavy and he felt sleep beginning to pull him under. "Hey Cas?"
“I ain’t denying anything,” said Bobby. “All I’m sayin’ is he was more straight than gay. Half those sonnets were written to a dark lady, and those were a helluva lot more intimate.”
“And you’ve been waiting for him to come back home,” Cas finished.
Dean grinned. "Oh, I don't know, Sam. College girls? Sexy Halloween costumes? You may have to twist my arm on this one."
Dean let out a sigh of relief. The familiar teasing nicknames had rolled off their tongues like the fight had never happened.
Castiel is breathless with it and he’s sure Ishim must see right through him and read him like an open book.
His fears are unfounded though, because Dean comes bursting into the kitchen with a huge grin, sliding across the floor in his socks.
He wakes the next morning with no small amount of trepidation, not sure what to expect from Dean. He’ll probably want to avoid talking about it. Maybe he’ll even be angry. Maybe Dean will be so disgusted by what they did that he won’t be able to look at him and Castiel isn’t sure he’d be able to bear that.
They only just bought the house a few months ago, so it will be their first Christmas here. The sellers were leaving in a hurry so they got a great, albeit unexpected deal considering they hadn’t even been looking seriously at the time. It happened so fast that most days, Dean looks around and can’t quite believe that his life is real.
“I don’t understand why you want to start with episode four, that makes no sense,” huffed Cas.
“It’s your wedding present,” explained Eileen, smiling.
He placed the opened can on the floor in front of her and set about tidying his bookshelves. When all his books were returned to their place he turned back to the cat and frowned.
Yes, that sounded good. Anything to get the hell out of there. Dean collected what he could see of his clothing, keeping the sheet wrapped securely around his lower half, and made his way towards the doorway with as much dignity as he could muster, tripping only once over a bottle of lube that he resolutely ignored. Once outside the bedroom, he saw another door to his right and a large open kitchen and living area off the end of the hallway, but he made a beeline for the other door on the left.
Dean shuddered at the thought. “What happened with your family?” he asked. “I can’t see how anyone could be disappointed in you.”
It has always been about protecting Dean. The angels would have come for him and hunted him down. Once he was out of the way they would have gone after Dean and Cas wouldn’t have been able to keep him safe.
Cas smiled. He kissed Dean deeply, silencing the rest of his doubts. “You deserve everything, Dean,” he said. “Your soul is beautiful. More beautiful than you know.” He kissed down Dean’s jawline, alternating each kiss with words breathed into his skin. “Bright.” He kissed his jaw. “And pure.” Two quick pecks under his ear. “In spite of the agonies it’s endured.” Dean tipped his head back and Cas continued down the column of his throat. “A strong soul.” He nuzzled into Dean’s neck. “Kind.”
Dean skimmed the form. Cell phone, wallet, keys, no cash. He signed it and took the box from the woman.
~~~~~
He turns and Cas is right there, staring intently at him. Maybe it’s the beer, but he’s not really concerned about personal space right now and finds he quite likes the proximity after so long without it. It has been so long… so long without any touch at all. Cas is only inches away. He could lean over, just a bit, and their foreheads would touch. Or their lips...
“Well, I may have fought back a bit. Once he took my things and he was just standing there riffling through my wallet, I… I just lost control and something in me snapped. He managed to run away with my things, but there was… there was a lot of blood.” He looked down at his hands and Dean saw that they too were bruised and bloody.
Then Dean is grappling with his zipper, reaching inside, and Cas’s breath catches in his throat at the first feel of Dean’s hand and he shivers. Dean’s own cock is out and he presses them together, his hand encircling them both. He starts to move his hand up and down, squeezing them together, continuing to grind down.
Three sets of eyes stared at the flame that suddenly shot up and pulsed a bright lime green colour. Sparks flew and there was a loud bang before it flared back down to a dull glow in the bottom of the bowl, then fizzled out entirely.
Dean smiles his first real smile since going to prison and snuggles in deeper.
They sit there together by the tree, watching some of the younger kittens jump around excitedly with Charlie as Cas scritches at Meg’s head. The lights twinkle and shine in Cas’s eyes.
“Oh, Dean I—”
“Oh god, I’m sorry.” Dean backpedaled again. “When did you lose him?”
Cas decided for him, and stood in one fluid motion, still holding Dean in his arms. Dean let out a grunt of surprise as Cas hoisted him up and carried him the few feet to the bed without any apparent strain. Dean contemplated the myriad of possibilities afforded by angelic strength as Cas’s wings fell away and he laid Dean downon the bed carefully.
made a stupid decision?” Cas stares at him incredulous. And okay, perhaps Dean isn’t the in the best position to be lecturing on stupid decisions. Cas stands up then, straightening to his full height, shoulders squared. There’s rage and power simmering in him, and Dean flinches. He always forgets. Always just thinks of Castiel as Cas, his dorky little friend, but he sees a glimpse again of the otherworldly creature and like always, the magnitude of it takes his breath away.
“I am. It’s nothing,” Castiel says.
"Something must have gotten lost in translation," Castiel mused.
Dean shook his head no.
Making up his mind, Dean rolled onto his stomach, reasoning that it would be much easier not to have to look Cas in the eye anymore. He could close himself off here, facedown in a pillow. It would just be sensation. Just two bodies moving, and his treacherous heart could stay well out of the way.
Only a minute into the film, and all that had been shown so far was a car driving along a winding, deserted road, but Castiel
His panic intensified as he realized that the figure appeared to be brandishing some sort of weapon held in the air.
“You flew?”
Cas’s lip twitched, his eyes sparkling with amusement. “I think we got married last night, Dean.”
“Let’s… can we back up? Why are you...” Cas struggled for words. “Why are you here? In my kitchen? Why are you—?”
-----
“We’ll talk about it later,” Sam said. “Right now, we want to get married!” He looked over at Eileen and put his arm around her. She was dressed in a white sundress with a teal belt that matched the handkerchief in Sam’s breast pocket. It was a simple dress, but the effect was stunning.
“Then I think you had a small panic attack.” Cas looked down at him, his eyes full of concern. Then his lips suddenly quirked into a small smile. “I’m not that bad, you know.”
Cas sighed. “Yes, I suppose we should.”
His bedroom door was closed, which wasn't in itself odd. Castiel often kept his door closed when he slept. But then, how had the cat got out?
Dean’s reply is lost to a loud sneeze.
Dean jumped and whirled around to see Cas.
“No shit. Turns out it wasn’t a kid this time, it was a goddamn witch.”
And fuck if Dean’s heart doesn’t shatter to pieces.“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Dean can’t stop the tears now either.
"Shocking," Dean mutters, and the sarcasm is lost on Cas.
"Dean!" Cas called, and rushed towards him. But the monster flicked its hand, and Cas was thrown against the wall next to him a few feet away.
He tosses a small wrapped package into Cas’s lap. “Here, I couldn’t wait until tomorrow morning.”
come home, he brushes past Dean like a whirlwind and heads straight for the washroom, like he’s done every time he’s come home late. A wave of artificial scent like cheap air freshener trails behind him and Dean sneezes.
“Not good, Sammy.” Dean slammed his bag down on the table and watched Sam jolt in surprise. “Pretty fucking awful in fact.”
“It’s me!” Jack shouts, as he raises his hands, his eyes wide. He looks terrified, like he half expects Dean to pull the trigger.
. . .
Heaven is wrong. This is not a sin. Dean Winchester is not his weakness.
“Holy fuck.”
Castiel hangs back, observing the exchange between mother and son, not wanting to intrude. But then Dean shoots him a desperate, pleading look and Castiel’s resolve weakens. He sighs, his impatience to find Sam overriding his determination to stay out of their family scuffle.
“Do you have asthma?”
Cas frowned. “It does not. She’s beautiful, look.”
He wants to laugh. It’s ridiculous. This is
Cas perked up at that and Sam grinned. “Thought you’d like that Cas. I know you always wanted your own but couldn’t because you lived in the city. And you can work from anywhere, right?”
Sam jolted back in disgust.
He clapped his hands together and spun around on the spot, evaluating. Satisfied that there was nothing else burning, he pushed a kitchen chair over to the center of the kitchen, stood on top of it, and yanked the smoke alarm out of the ceiling. It continued to blare mercilessly, until he managed to wrench the batteries out of it and then it fell blissfully silent.
He stands up and turns to face Castiel, flashing the flirtiest smile he can muster as he saunters over. “Bit forward, don’t you think?” Dean calls back. “Buy a guy a drink first, why don’t you?”
The kittens scatter and Meg curls into Cas's lap like she belongs there. She's old and arthritic, and Cas tells him all about some kind of respiratory thing that makes her eyes look crusty and her nose drip. But Cas stares lovingly at her, completely transfixed as she sits and glowers at Dean.
"Isn't she beautiful?" Cas beams.
“Missed you, Cas,” Dean mutters. His voice has gone soft and so low that Castiel can barely hear him. Then Dean’s arm is wrapping around him, and Castiel is shocked to find himself pulled into an awkward sort of half-hug, his face pressed to Dean’s middle. All he can smell is coffee and Dean. Dean ruffles his hair, and then, apropos of nothing, there are lips– Dean’s lips– pressing warm and firm onto his head, just above his temple. It’s lightning fast and Dean pulls back, disentangling himself and walking away before Castiel can even process what’s happened.
Dean supposed they could. It shouldn’t take that long, and it was still early in the evening They had time for one more movie, and then they could take care of business after. He left the papers scattered on the coffee table and relaxed back into the couch. Cas pointed the clicker at the TV and
Cas scowls and wraps his arms protectively around the gym bag in his lap. “Careful! You’ll hurt Pimmy.”
“Shut up,” Dean sighed. “Castle? No, um, Castille? Look, I’m just gonna call you Cas, okay?”
He knows they’re Cas’s brethren but Dean has never trusted other angels. He thinks of Naomi and Metatron and the skeptical, suspicious, uncomfortable feeling in his gut continues to grow.
Cas was not easily swayed, but in the end, he deferred to Dean’s way of thinking once Dean had elucidated all the merits of watching in production order rather than chronologically. They ordered pizza for dinner which arrived halfway through episode four and shared a meat lovers as the Falcon was captured by the Death Star’s tractor beam.
A single finger turns into a warm palm as Cas cups Dean’s jaw and strokes his cheek with his thumb. Such a feather light touch and yet Dean can feel it all the way down to his toes as he realizes he’s trembling. He hadn’t been aware of just how desperate he’d been for touch after so long without it. How desperate he had been for Cas.
“Right.” Charlie nods her head at Cas. “He won’t shut up about you, you know. All I ever hear is Dean this, Dean that.”
He looks over at Dean, his eyes big and watery and blue and hiding nothing. Quietly, almost under his breath, he murmers, “I missed you, Dean.”
The rest of the afternoon and well into the evening passed in a blur. Dean found the nearest bar and drank. When the bartender cut him off, he moved on to the next. At the third bar he went to, he caught sight of a cute brunette sitting at the other end of the counter. She licked her stir stick enticingly, and Dean was all in.
Cas had stared at him in rapt attention the entire time as Dean had become increasingly agitated. He continued staring now, blue eyes boring into Dean’s. Dean had to look away.
Dean frowned. “I don’t understand… why are you so excited about this place? Why now?”
Dean ran through all of Cas’s injuries in his head, cataloguing them, feeling the pain of each one as if they had happened to him. Lacerations and fractures could be fixed, he reasoned. A collapsed lung sounded scary, but Dean didn’t really know what that meant. What scared him most was the one thing he recognized: a head injury. A boy he’d played football with in high school had gone down the wrong way during a bad play and suffered a head injury. He was in a wheelchair now.
Castiel toes out of his shoes, and folds his trenchcoat carefully over Dean’s chair. After a moment’s hesitation, he sheds his suit jacket as well, then settles carefully next to Dean in bed, sitting back against the headboard.
-----
Dean rolled to block out the light and buried his face in the warm mound of blankets next to him. He inhaled an unfamiliar, but not unpleasant scent. It was deeply soothing, and Dean was pretty sure he could stay like this forever. Warm, dark, perfect. Nope, he would not be opening his eyes any time soon.
“I really would like to buy you that drink if you’d like. Or you could come over for one at my place?”
But Sam was insistent. "Tortoiseshell cats are almost always female.”
It turned out, Sam wasn’t nearly as mad as Dean had been expecting. When he told his brother where he’d woken up that morning, Sam had cackled in hysterics for a solid minute. When Dean had tried to get more information out of him about the previous night, Sam had told him between wheezing laughter to bring Cas to the chapel that evening and they could all talk after the wedding.
“Look, I know paperwork is a drag, but we gotta get through this, right?” Dean said, settling next to him on the couch, a respectable distance away.
“Dean,” Cas says again, more seriously, and Dean groans and gives up, letting out a long, defeated sigh of frustration. He pulls the blanket over himself and covers his face with his hands. His face is still burning and he can feel the hot sting of tears threatening to spill.
Inside, their family was waiting. Sam, Eileen, Bobby, and John greeted them warmly. There were hugs and handshakes all around.
“And then I can see him?” Dean asked.
Dean's eyebrows disappear into his hairline and his lips form a perfunctory "o" as he whips around to stare at Castiel. "You got a doppelgänger running around and you didn't think to share with the class?"
he come back this time? And why hadn’t he considered this more carefully before now? The last time he had been brought back unknowingly had been Purgatory. The recollection of Naomi’s manipulation sits heavy in the pit of his stomach. The sick, corrupted desecration of body and trust— his grace recoils at the memory, at the the things she made him do. . . to Dean.
Dean had months to think of all the things he wanted say to Cas when he got out. Now he says nothing either.
Cas scowls. “Why do you care?”
“It was a stupid thing to do.” Dean says gruffly.
"Yeah, man," said another.  "The blood and that decapitated head looks totally real."
Dean brings the beer in for Cas and pats him on the shoulder as he passes. He sinks into a chair, bracing himself mentally for words and talking and all of this feelings crap that puts his stomach in knots. It’s Cas though, and he can tell he’s hurting not just by the cut on his face that hasn’t fully healed yet, but by the way his shoulders droop and the way the dark circles under his eyes are more pronounced. Dean really is an ass.
“Hey Cas, look,” Dean started, and he slid to the other end of the couch to get closer, his patience at keeping his distance evaporating in a puff. “I’m sorry.” He stared hard at Cas, willing him to look up, to look at him.
An hour later, they had found the vampire.
And as wonderful as that is, it’s also a special kind of hell for Dean who’s now hyper aware of everything that is Cas— from the way his mouth wraps tantalizingly around his spoon when he eats his cereal, to the way he hums out of tune to himself in the bathroom each morning. Every casual brush of their bodies together is electric; like when Cas squeezes past him in the kitchen, his chest brushing up against Dean’s back and his breath hot on Dean’s neck. Or when Cas nearly pees himself laughing at the TV and collapses against Dean’s side in a fit of giggles. Dean tries to find reasons not to love him, but even Cas’s annoying habits are endearing to him, and he finds that he rather likes finding half drunk mugs of cold tea in odd places around the apartment. It’s little reminders of Cas throughout the day that never fail to make him stop and smile.
“Who?”
Dean stepped into the shower and turned the water as hot as he could stand it. He accidentally leaned against a button of some sort and massage jets lining the inside of the shower sprang to life, making him groan as the warm water worked its way into his muscles. A soft mist fell from the overhead jets, giving the whole thing the illusion of a tropical waterfall if he just closed his eyes. He thought briefly of the small, rusty shower at home that never got hot enough. He could get used to this.
Cas’s face darkened, and Dean backtracked quickly.
“Sam, yeah. He’s here in Vegas with me, actually. I should call him. He might be able to fill in some blanks from last night and he’s probably wondering where the hell I am.” Dean trailed off, trying again to recall what had happened with his brother last night and why they had fought. “Have you seen my phone?” It hadn’t been in his back pocket where he normally kept it.
~~~~~
The monotonous chanting continued and Dean pulled a book from a nearby shelf and held it out in front of himself. When there was a brief space in the chant, he smacked himself in the head.
“I’ll sleep in the spare room,” Dean clarified hastily. “If that’s okay.”
Dean huffed, took a steadying breath, and reached out a cautious hand to the dark feathers. He trailed a finger gently down the ridge of the damaged one, and the feathers ruffled softly in response.
Sam looked around in alarm. “What happened? Where’s Cas?”
and it has broken him.
Cas picks carefully at the tape and slowly peels back the paper. “Claritin?” He holds up the box of pills and looks at Dean in confusion.
When the credits rolled, Dean yawned, stretched, and turned to look at Cas who was still staring intently at the screen.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that so he says nothing, sinking like a rock into the nearest chair.
“I’ve been thinking about fairy tales.” Sam said as Dean took a seat.
Cas turned the key in the ignition and put the car in drive.
Dean shuddered, and Cas pulled back to fixed him with a grave stare.
Dean poked Cas in the ribs. He turned from his conversation with Bobby and leaned in close to wrap an arm around Dean’s waist. “Wedding present,” Dean muttered.
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Holy shit, Cas.”
It’s not, in fact, like the sleepovers they had when they were kids.
, Castiel tells himself.
Dean stammed for a response, unable to formulate one and unable to move, frozen in place with his face mere inches from Cas’s.
As if he could ever get over Dean.
He found a handful of potatoes under the sink that were beginning to resemble a science experiment and he set to dicing them. There were also a few slices of stale bread left, some milk that didn’t smell completely expired, and two eggs. Dean was just laying the French toast down to fry when Cas walked in.
“Dean!” his little brother called, and made his way over to Dean and Cas.
Dean’s hands flew up to cover his eyes. “I’m sorry, Cas. I need to clear my head.” He turned and stumbled out the door.
“Kiss me,” Cas whispers, unable to contain his grin. “I dare you.”
Much later, Dean finds himself tucked under Cas’s arm as long fingers card softly through his hair. With his cheek pressed to Cas’s side, he listens to the steady thump of Cas’ heartbeat, watches the rise and fall of his chest, and allows the soft sound of his breathing to lull him to sleep.
As the bacon sizzled, Dean chatted away, heedless of the fact that Cas couldn’t respond. It was kind of nice— the small weight on his shoulder keeping him company, seemingly content to listen to Dean’s dumb jokes and his offkey humming as he cracked eggs.
“Cas ain’t exactly a person, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t have belongings,” Dean said, frowning.
Dean thought he’d made it clear that they were good, but there’s a note of desperation in Cas’s voice and he softens.
This was going to be a challenge.
The room started spinning again and Dean sat down heavily on the edge of the bed. He couldn’t be married, that just wasn’t possible. Dean Winchester was
. Tonight is no different and Dean is so turned on he could cry. And yet…
Backing hastily away from the bird, Dean surveyed the rest of the room. Cas’s apartment was huge; larger than Dean had first realized. It was more of a penthouse, really. One whole wall of the living area was lined with floor to ceiling windows that offered a stunning view of the Vegas skyline. A sliding door on one end led to what looked like a wraparound balcony. The rest of the living room was lined with floor to ceiling bookcases, housing a variety of thick books and expensive looking artifacts. A massive TV hung on one wall, facing a dark couch and matching chairs.
Castiel flinches as Jack bursts into the bedroom. As expected, Dean does not respond well to being jolted awake. Although he knows Jack can't be hurt by bullets, Castiel still scowls when Dean pulls the gun from under his pillow and aims it at Jack.
Castiel lifted her carefully to bring her inside, struggling for only a moment at the door as he tried to balance her weight in one hand while he fumbled with his keys with the other. She didn’t squirm, so that made it easier, but she was certainly not a light cat. He set her down with a thump once they got inside.
“What?”
“What in the hell?”
Dean scowled. “Your dad sounds like a real dick.”
,” Cas urged. “In Vegas.” He looked at his watch pointedly, then up at Dean. “The mugging was only this this morning.”
He slides in next to Cas in the booth, gets nice and close, and stares down the other angel. He has to make sure they know that Cas is not alone. Cas has a family and they have his back.
Dean clears his throat and Castiel snaps back to attention.
“Will you marry me, Cas? Again?”
A long moment of silence passes. Dean’t not sure how long, but he feels Cas’s hand on his knee, warm and firm, and he feels safe. He thinks then that he’d be content to stay here indefinitely, staring into that blue that feels like home.
Dean was halfway into the living room when he was startled by a loud squawking noise that rose above the sound of his ringtone. He whirled around to see a large, elegant birdcage in one corner of the room and in it, a very proud looking bird that was ruffling its wings ostentatiously, making a sort of clicking noise. It was mostly grey with a tuft of red in it’s tail feathers.
“No,” Castiel admits. “I’m changed because of the time I’ve spent on earth in this universe. Because of the relationships I’ve formed. Because I had a cause and something to fight for.”
And that’s how Dean found himself sitting on a plane, white knuckling the armrests and humming Metallica under his breath, eyes squeezed tightly shut.
The End
“It’s wonderful, Sam. Great find.”
“Happy birthday, Dean.”
“You may need to microwave it,” came a low voice from behind him.
“Dean? Dean, look at me.”
That seems to do the trick. Dean sinks onto the couch and Cas drops to his knees on the floor. Part of him expects Dean to burst out laughing and call the whole thing off. But instead, Dean spreads his legs slowly. It’s almost shy, and when Castiel looks up, he’s surprised to see that Dean is blushing.
Dean wanted to watch— wanted to drink in the rapturous look on Cas’s face. The spread of his wings and the shimmering iridescence of them. The blueish pulse of his grace in each feather tip as he came, hot against Dean’s hand and stomach. He only managed to catch a brief glimpse— a fleeting feeling of incredulous awe at the sensation of
Dean sighed and cracked open another book.
Dean popped the remaining strawberry on his plate into his mouth and answered before he had fully finished chewing. “Yeah. He’s my little brother.” He swallowed and cleared his throat.  “And he’s getting married tonight. You down to be my plus one? It’s at the same place so we can probably re-trace our steps and see if we can’t figure out what happened last night. If we actually did get married, I’m sure Sam can help us get it sorted out.”
Cas lays down next to him and nudges his foot against Dean’s.
It’s been excruciating all this time without Dean and now he’s finally here. Cas wants to soak Dean in, wants to scrub him clean of the prison grime and smooth away the new lines that have formed on his hardened face. He wants to breathe him in and re-catalogue every freckle. Instead he watches Dean disappear down the hall and slam his bedroom door.
As Dean looked over at his Dad, he realized how haggard he appeared. He was quiet, and a bit sullen, slouching in his chair and nursing a glass of water. But he was still here, and that meant everything to Dean.
“What did you do?” asks Castiel.
Sam tapped Eileen on the shoulder to get her attention and translated for her. She smiled and looked to Cas and Dean. “Let’s go. I’m ready for this.”
Their clothes come off, Dean’s less suavely than he’d have liked. Whiskey and exhaustion have made all his movements a little clumsy and he gets his foot stuck inside his pants leg, then nearly loses his balance trying to pull off a sock.
“Well I’ll be damned,” muttered Bobby.
“Is it Sam?” Bobby asked. “John?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “Wow.”
“Ugh,” Cas groaned between frantic kisses. “I just replaced that bulb.”
“Yeah, you too.” Dean started to leave, feeling Cas’s eyes on him. He turned back when he got to the edge of the room and Cas quickly averted his gaze. He had settled back into the couch, legs curled under himself.
Several missed calls and a slew of texts. One was from the garage where his car was being kept, and the rest were all from Sam. He scrolled through his text history with his brother and the grim reality of the previous night came flooding back to him in pieces.
Dean lit up. “That one with Naveen! I mean, er, Tiana.” He cleared his throat and rubbed at the back of his neck. “What was it called again?”
“Clark’s a barrel of laughs, I swear. Listen, I’m going to give him your number, okay?”
If you have concerns and would prefer to know what's coming, please see the end notes WITH SPOILERS for more details.
He stood up and shook his head, wandering over to the nurse’s station.
His cock flops to one side uselessly, still only half-hard despite Cas’s best efforts.
Dean scoffs. "Hardly seemed— wait, what did he do? The other Cas, I mean?"
“Balthazar, shush,” said Cas without turning around.
“What?” Castiel asks.
“Cause I think,” he interrupts, “as long as she stays out of our bed and I don’t get too up close and personal with her, I’ll be fine. And something tells me that’ll suit her just fine anyway.”
“Hey,” Dean said, suddenly perking up. “I know why I got hammered last night. What about you? What do
Cas passed a pepper grinder and Dean gave it a few twists. “Some other herbs would be good if you had them. Start out with just a little seasoning, and keep tasting. You can always add more.”
While Cas remains rooted to the spot and as monosyllabic as he always is in the mornings before coffee, Dean putters about packing a brown bag with an apple and the leftovers from last night. He shoves it into Cas’s hands and ushers him towards the door.
Not for the first time, Dean was stunned into silence. He was finding that he didn’t like it much when Cas’s smiles were the sad kind.
“Mmm.” Dean wiggled a bit, figuring it was definitely time now to get up before they crossed the line from no-strings sex to post-coital cuddling.
“Can’t you pick someone cooler? Or, I don’t know, from this century?”
Cas shrugged. “I love honey. It goes well with everything, and it’s a natural sweetener.”
Dean’s heart plummeted and he felt like he was going to be sick.
"Pretty sure it wasn't," Dean snapped.
Castiel considers the most terrifying possibility yet: What if he’s been reprogrammed again? What if he’s playing into exactly what they want him to do, drawing the Winchesters to him? What if it’s not safe for them? What if
“You don’t know that.”
As the fog from his mind began to clear, Dean took stock of his current predicament. First, his impala had broken down just outside of Vegas when he’d hit a pothole and he’d had to take her straight to a garage for a replacement part. Looking back, he probably should have seen it for the bad omen it was. He had come to Vegas to meet his younger brother Sam, who was on break from Stanford. He vaguely remembered a fight of some sort, though he couldn’t recall why he had been angry. And now he’d lost his mother’s ring, one of the few things Dean truly treasured, and had woken up next to a complete stranger.
Coincidentally, Dean starts having nightmares.
What had Dean been doing when it happened? Changing the oil in that old Toyota? Taking his coffee break? How could Dean’s world have been so normal today when this had been happening to Cas. Surely, he should have sensed that something was wrong; he should have known. He should have been here sooner.
Cas emerged from his bedroom with a light green tie that he claimed would make Dean’s eyes pop and whistled at the parrot affectionately.
He was still a child when he lost the luxury of fear and learned of worse things lurking in the dark than the whispers of a coming storm. But he still hated them. Storms brought destruction in their wake and couldn’t be stopped with knives or bullets.
“Hm, yeah about that,” Dean said, nudging Cas’s shoulder with his own. He took a deep breath and reached down to take Cas’s hand in his, threading their fingers together. Without looking back up, he mumbled, “Maybe you could draw us together next time?”
There’s a muttered curse, and Castiel looks up to see Dean struggling to remove his socks, He wobbles on one foot before collapsing onto his bed in a fresh t-shirt and sweatpants. Finally rid of his socks, Dean lets out a loud groan and falls back onto his pillow, stretching his arms above his head and yawning.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Classy, Dean.”
“Right,” Dean snorted. “And
“Dean,” Cas says finally. “Could you look at me for a moment?”
“What can I do?” Cas murmurs as he nibbles on Dean’s ear.
-----
“Who’s making me coffee?” Dean groans, as he rolls over and tucks his gun away. His voice is low and hoarse with sleep, and he buries his face in his pillow in a huff.
Dean sat up and Cas held out his left hand. On it was Dean’s ring. His mother’s ring. On the left hand of the guy he woke up in bed with.
He’d asked.
It’s hard. It shouldn’t be, but Dean can’t help but feel flayed raw when he has to open up like this and stop guarding his heart. The thing is, Cas already knows him inside and out, knows the shape of his heart, and still loves all the ugly, vulnerable bits. Dean’s sometimes a little wistful for all the years they could have had together if they’d started talking sooner.
Cas supplied Dean with his laptop and some blank CDs, and Dean spent the next hour playing dozens of songs for him and carefully selecting his favourite to burn to a CD.
“Yeah,” Dean muttered. “Come on, Cas.”
And with that, Dean was gone. Cas shoved his disappointment down and turned his attention to the television, where
“Gross,” Dean muttered, wrinkling his nose at Cas who stared dolefully back up at him. He’d put some grass and twigs in the bowl and a shallow puddle of water in the bottom which Cas seemed quite taken with. He was worried about food though.
Dean snorts derisively, but the effect is ruined somewhat by his teeth, which have begun to chatter.
His heart dropped to the floor and shattered into tiny pieces. He took it back. This right here was the single stupidest thing he’d ever done in his miserable life. Of course Cas wouldn’t want to marry him. Why would he? His face felt hot and something was stinging at his eyes. What the hell had he been thinking? What could possibly have possessed him to think any of this was a good idea?
“Yeah, you got a problem with Hemingway?”
Dean breaks the silence first. “Shit, I’m sorry. I—”
Finally –
After spending the rest of the morning reading over the heavy legal documents, they planned to break for lunch, then fill out the annulment papers. But the afternoon took an unexpected detour when Dean suggested putting on some music.
Much to Dean's dismay and annoyance, Sam found a shirt a thrift store during the drive down to Knoxville that read, "too lazy for a costume."
Dean started shoving food onto plates and brought them over to the table. Cas looked down at the plate of food before him, then up at the man who had made it. He took a tentative bite of the eggs, and groaned.
“Well, thank you,” Cas lies.
“And I’ll reiterate: we are. We’re real, Dean. I promise you that. And you are more than the sum of your parts. You’re Dean Winchester. You and your brother? Frankly, God doesn’t stand a chance.”
“I uh… I said some stuff, too.”
“I mean it, Dean.” Cas sits up and moves to straddle Dean’s lap. He takes Dean’s face in his hands, his gaze unwavering and intense. “I love you, and I’m not going anywhere.”
“Hey, you were sober,” said Sam, throwing his hands up in defense. “He was sober. Y’all didn’t start pounding back martinis ‘till after. And frankly, you were being a dick, and I was pissed, and it felt like the best revenge at the time was just to let you carry on being an idiot.”
“I felt sorry for him,” Castiel says, letting the admission spill from him in a rush. “Worse than that, I understood him. He was everything I could have been. Everything I am.”
Dean turns on his heel then and disappears inside as Cas bristles at the reminder of his broken wings. He won’t be flapping anywhere tonight.
He was asleep before he felt the brush of a kiss to his temple.
Dean twirled the spatula in his hand. “I uh… I thought I’d make breakfast.”
The new couch arrives the following week, and Cas starts sleeping in the living room.
“Sleep well, Dean.”
“Who did this to you? I’ll kill them,” Dean growled.
“Huh.” Dean stroked a finger along a single feather testing the theory, and Cas shuddered slightly.
"Wait, you were the cat from last night?" Sam asked. "The one that attacked me?"
“Please, Dean. It’s on me.”
What if all of this was Dean’s fault?
“I’m scared, Cas, of how I feel about you. But I’m tired of being scared.” Dean reaches out a fully healed hand and strokes Castiel’s cheek. “I’m crazy about you. Always have been, even before the cabin.”
He stared perhaps a moment too long in silent adoration of the expanse of feathers, because Cas started shifting uncomfortably.
“Lose the shoes, Cas. And ditch the trench while you're at it too."
He felt Cas smile against the back of his shoulder. "Not much, no. Safe to say I've been sufficiently distracted from any pain."
Cas frowns slightly and takes a final step into Dean’s space.
From across the table Sam snorts loudly into his salad and rolls his eyes. "It’s the fucking clap is what it is. Take your antibiotics and you’ll be fine."
“It really is good to have you back, Cas,” he admitted. Then he schooled his features into something more resembling indignation and smacked him—hard—square in the chest. “But don’t
Dean wrinkled his nose and Cas laughed. “That’s what I thought.”
“Stop it, you did nothing wrong. Please don’t ever change.” Dean said firmly. “I’m clearly the idiot here, not you.”
“And do you know what I had to wake up to?” Castiel shoots back. “Your insufferable snoring.”
They settled at a table to wait and Dean’s heart swelled as he took everything in. All of the people he loved most were here together in one room. Even his dad showed up. He knew Bobby had something to do with that, but he was grateful all the same.
It’s all too much. “Dean,” Cas warns.
“Ohh.” Sudden realization settles over Dean. “
“What Ishim said, you know you’re not weak, right Cas?”And then Sam jumps in and Dean feels buoyed by the support. They can do this, they can lift Cas up again, maybe stop him from thinking so little of his own life all the time.
In the alley outside, she kissed him hard and ground up against him. Her breath was stale and tasted of smoke, but Dean dove in, wrapping her legs around his waist and lifting her against the wall. She giggled, and he buried his face in her neck. He was surprised to find that he was fighting back tears. She was exactly his type, and Dean wanted nothing more than to have a few minutes of hot, hard, no-strings sex to get his mind off things, but something inside him ached and everything felt wrong.
Dean lets out a nervous laugh and claps Castiel on the back. “It’s been a hell of a summer, buddy.”
Castiel’s stomach flipped. Maybe his headache wasn’t so bad after all.
“No, she’s just scared,” Cas reasoned. He reached out to stroke her head and the cat hissed once at him before letting him continue. Although the cat’s mood didn’t change any, it didn’t attack him either. It sneezed again, and Cas couldn’t help but chuckle. “Hey there, sweetheart. Are you sick?” The cat just glared at him.
“Oy, hey! Not
“I’m aware.”
Dean flops back onto his pillow with a groan. He tries to sound unbothered, but his voice breaks a little when he speaks.
“Mom, I got this,” Dean says. He sounds weary, and Castiel realizes that it was not Dean’s idea to bring Mary along. Interesting. There are not many people who can tell Dean what to do.
“Hey there, I’m sorry.” Cas picked her up and snuggled her to his chest. The cat nuzzled into him and purred. “You don’t like being alone, huh?” The cat burrowed further into Cas’s chest in response.
Dean stared slack-jawed, his gaze darting between his brother and Eileen. “I’m going to be an uncle?!”
Cas squinted at him in confusion.
Dean’s pulling in and parking next to it before he can really register what’s happened. He turns the Impala off, and sits with his hands shaking on the wheel for several minutes, taking stock of the situation. He looks down at his phone and the last message from Cas.
“I know exactly what you’re thinking, Dean, but allow me to assure you that nothing’s going to change. Not for the worse, anyway. If it doesn’t work out, well… frankly I don’t see that happening because it’s
“See, you want to cook them until they just start to get brown on the edges,” Dean explained to Cas, who was peering over his shoulder at the hashbrowns. “Low heat. If you cook ‘em too fast, they’ll burn for sure. Pass the pepper.”
do that again. What were you thinking jumping in front of an unknown curse like that? You could have been killed.”
“No, but why are you
Maybe it’s the beer that’s loosened his tongue and made him bold, but Dean leans in then, and it feels right. This is what he’d imagined their reunion looking like.
He didn’t realize just how well Ishim had him figured out until later when he’s laying beaten and bleeding on the ground. True, a banishing spell may kill him now, but it will save Dean and that’s what matters. It’s the right thing to do and Cas is ready. He turns to look at Dean’s face one last time.
Dean nodded to himself, then froze at Cas’s next words.
“He got hit by a car?” Cas sounded confused.
Cas stared at him with wide, watery blue eyes and Dean’s resolve strengthened. He squared his shoulders and went to the spare room to pack his bag.
“Shit,” Dean breathed. “Karma’s a nasty bitch.”
The sound of Zeppelin echoed from down the hall and they wandered out into the living area.
“Why were you so upset that he was getting married?” Cas asked.
He remained frozen, afraid to move and wake her further.
Dean balked, but Cas continued without giving him time to object. “I
Cas squeezes his hand. “I should have told you about the shelter. I would have if you’d asked, you know, but it was selfish to keep it to myself. I should have realized how that would cause you to worry. And I’m going to be better at helping you know that you’re loved so you’ll never have reason to wonder about that again.”
While the cat investigated the living room, Cas scavenged his kitchen for something to feed her. There were not a lot of options, for either the cat or himself. He hadn’t eaten anything at Sam’s and he was definitely hungry. His fridge yielded some questionable takeout containers that he quickly tossed. He eyed the box of candy in the pantry that he’d bought for trick-or-treaters tomorrow, but ultimately settled on a box of mac and cheese and a tin of tuna. He boiled the water for himself and cracked the tuna can, half expecting the cat to come running. Surely, she was hungry. Weren’t cats supposed to go crazy for the smell of tuna?
Cas furrows his brow. “Don’t call yourself that.”
“By making you breakfast,” Cas sighed. “I had groceries delivered. You complained yesterday that I didn’t have anything, but you still made such delicious food. I wanted to return the favour.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean breathes into his neck.
-----
Dean could tell that Sam and Eileen were itching to be alone, and so a short time later, they wished them goodnight and parted ways. Dean pulled his brother into a tight bear hug. “Congratulations little brother.” Sam melted into the hug and lingered a little longer than he normally did.
Dean rolled his eyes.
“Here, let me.” Cas said, finally. He leaned in and began a series of complicated tucks and folds on Dean’s tie. As he reached around the back of Dean’s neck he was so close that Dean could see every individual fleck of stubble on his cheek, could feel it rub against his own. He shivered. As Cas pulled back slightly, Dean found himself leaning in, chasing the ethereal scent of him that pulled at something deep within Dean.
Cas opened a large mahogany cabinet to reveal an expensive stereo system and Dean practically drooled at the sight, running his hands appreciatively over the speakers and crouching slightly to hit the power button.
Cas reaches out as if to touch Dean’s face, and his hand hangs unsure of itself in midair until Dean leans into it. He lets his eyes flicker shut once more as Cas strokes a thumb gently over his cheek.
Heady, overwhelming relief floods through Dean and he lets out a shaky laugh. “Really, Cas?
Dean pleaded.
“We’ll figure out the furnace,” he says as he turns off the bedside light and nestles himself next to Dean. “Don’t let it worry you like this.”
But this year he’s traded the whiskey for coffee. A bed that remembers him. And a familiar face.
“His name is Clark. He’s got blue eyes and a killer behind. You’re going to love him.”
“We have to watch the next one!” Cas declared.
Cas stared at him, chuckling. His whole face lit up, nose scrunching, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “I guess this makes you the princess.”
“There’s another version of the story,” Sam said, looking shifty. “Uh, the princess throws the the frog against the wall in disgust, which breaks the spell. We could, um, try tossing it?” He glanced over at Cas. “Just gently, to see if anything happens?”
Eager for the excuse to leave the room, Cas retrieved his phone from the living room. When he returned to the kitchen, he handed the phone over to Dean wordlessly, who called Sam and put it on speaker.
"The lighting made those wings look practically real!" she exclaimed.
Cas suddenly jumped back in the bowl staring insistently at Dean.
He heard a muffled noise coming from the direction of his kitchen and he sat bolt upright in bed, fear shooting straight down his spine.
When Dean returned to the bedroom, his hookup had stripped the sheets from the bed and tidied up. He was sitting on the end of the bed, mercifully clothed now, scrolling through his phone.
Sam carried on, nonplussed. “Fairy tales are generally considered to be an easier way of looking at the human condition, you know? A safely removed way to fictionalize all our deepest fears. Magic and transformation… I can see how that would be fascinating to a witch.”
It cuts deep at the core of him.
Several hours later, Sam was buried under a mountain of books and spell supplies and Dean had unceremoniously dumped an unamused Castiel out of the cooler and thoroughly sanitized it. Even then, it would probably be awhile before Sam would willingly use it again.
Castiel shrugs. “It’s nice. Festive,” he says.
Dean stands on his lawn, surveying the house that now bears his name on the deed. It’s a rundown old thing, in dire need of a new roof and a dozen other imminent fixes. But it’s in a nice neighbourhood and it’s his, and that alone is almost cause to smile. Almost. He doesn’t though, because his gutter chooses that moment to collapse with a screech of metal on the left side, sending the stray cat who has taken to sleeping in his front bushes scurrying.
Dean shrugs and starts to sit up, but Cas plants a firm hand on his chest and shoves him back down. He sighs happily as Cas resumes his ministrations, kissing his way down Dean’s chest and stomach, and further down the line of his hips.
was starting.
Dean looked down at the table and the meal that Cas had so carefully ordered and arranged for them, then up at Cas himself, and his heart broke. Cas looked nothing like the man that Dean had woken up next to only a few days earlier. He looked like he had had all the life sucked out of him. Dean had done that to him, he realized with a pang. And that’s when he made up his mind.
“Yeah. Wait...” Dean rolls his eyes as understanding finally dawns on him. “Is
Their bandages come off the next morning and Castiel can’t stop touching things. He scratches the itch on his nose, runs his hands through his hair. Unsure what to do with himself, he sinks heavily to the arm of the couch, and smooths his hands over the coarse fabric. Finally, he can use his hands. Finally, he can feel.
Someone asked him to take a seat in the waiting room.
Cas ran a soothing hand over his hip. “Relax Dean,” he murmured.
Cas seemed surprised as well and jumped a little. The popcorn bowl, which had been precariously perched on the couch, toppled over.
Dean worries all the way home, and jumps when Cas puts a tentative hand on his knee. He should really stop worrying, because the evening ends up unfolding like most other evenings with Cas. They find themselves on Dean’s couch watching Doctor Sexy reruns. This time though, when Dean stares at Cas’s hand in the space between them, Cas smiles and turns it palm up to him in invitation. Dean takes it, squeezes, and can’t for the life of him stop smiling.
“It’s Sam!” Dean jolted in surprise and his knee hit the underside of the table, jostling their plates. He looked up at Cas apologetically.
Dean blanched.
“I was just a kid,” Dean said. “Sammy was a baby. There was a house fire and she didn’t get out in time.” He spoke quickly, and didn’t add that even though decades had passed, there were still nights when he would wake up in a cold sweat, certain that he could still smell the smoke and hear his father’s anguished cries echoing in the night.
He shoved a plate at him. “French toast.” He muttered.
“Damn, Cas, that was intense.”
He clears his throat, finally ready to broach the subject that’s been eating at him all day.
Cas frowned a little and looked about to say something when the waitress returned with their food. Dean smiled at her in what he hoped was a friendly but not overly flirty smile.
“It was just a joke,” he mumbled. “I forgot, I’m sorry.”
snore.”
“Did they hurt you?” Cas asks.
He heard the shower running, and images of Cas started running through his mind on a loop. Cas peeling off sweaty clothes. Water running down his body, over his thighs.
“Uh..”
Dean wasn’t too sure what to do with that, but it made him feel a peculiar mix of warmth and sadness that he’d had any sort of effect on Cas at all.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized that voice. Before he could say anything else, Cas stepped into the light, wide eyed, hair askew, and clutching tightly to a frying pan that he held above his head.
“Sure.” Dean shuffled a little to one side and Cas moved in. He passed the spatula over to Cas, then leaned around him from behind, taking his hand in his to guide him.
“I don’t often drink, but last night was extenuating circumstances for me and I needed to let off some steam. I do remember you. I was at the bar, and I was watching you argue, I think, with another man. Taller than you, longer hair. And a short woman he was with.”
And then Cas took Dean’s face in his hands, firm but gentle. “I won’t marry you, Dean. But I’d very much like to date you.” He gave a tentative, quirk of a smile. “If you’ll have me, that is.”
