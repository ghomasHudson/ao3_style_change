“Yeah, sorry...about...that.”
Castiel chuckled, putting the book back on the shelf. Then, he walked to Dean’s dresser, picking up the framed photograph he’d given him on Christmas where Dean was carrying Claire in her red dress. “I love this picture.”
“I want to do it again,” Anna said.
“I’m kidding, obviously,” Anna said. “I was never really interested in anything serious with him. I just thought he’d be a good time while I was in town.”
I’m in love with the way you bite your lip when we make love.
Dean grinned down at his plate. He always got shy with compliments. “So, what romcom are we watching after dinner?”
Castiel raised his eyebrows. “Excuse me?”
“We’re planning on it,” Dean said.
“I won’t. I promise. I just want to know more about you.”
“Dean, stop it. Charlie’s going to kick us out.”
Cas was smiling. “This is fun, isn’t it?”
Castiel held open the office door once they found it, removing his aviators and hanging them from the neck of his shirt. “After you, sir.”
Castiel had to do something about it.
Castiel broke the eye-contact, cleared his throat, and pulled up PowerPoint again.
Dean smiled. How could he not? “I’m happy to hear that.”
Castiel brushed his fingers through the fine hairs on the back of Dean’s neck. “She missed you, too. We could go visit you during lunch tomorrow.”
“Cas, you’re not listening to me.”
“I’m alright.” Castiel wiped his cheeks, finally letting go of the steering wheel. “I’m going to be alright.”
“You still owe me twenty bucks!” Dean called out and Castiel laughed. Dean didn’t tear his eyes away from Castiel until the door closed behind him. And then, he smiled up at the ceiling, mesmerized by the way Castiel made him feel. How had no one ever told Dean that this was what being in love felt like? He’d been missing out for so many years.
As everyone else kept opening presents, Dean opened his cassette tape. Inside, there was a note.
“Dean, you asshole,” Castiel muttered, quiet enough not to be heard by Ben. He used his arms to keep himself afloat because Dean was still holding onto him. But not for long. Castiel finally freed one of his feet, and he used it to kick Dean on whatever spot he could find. That seemed to work because his other foot was released.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once they reached the park, Castiel dumped the bag into a trashcan, and then they continued walking on the trail. There were children playing at the playground and Ben looked over, immediately interested.
Castiel’s face was buried in Dean’s neck, but Dean knew he was smiling. “As long as I get to live them with you.”
“Did you get that new crib?” Dean wondered.
. It’ll make you feel better.”
Castiel stared at Dean, tilting his head. “Why are you sorry?”
“Always.” Cas sipped his wine, smiling at Dean.
“It was about damned time that the wicked started paying for their sins. Justice is priceless, my friends. Those who died, they asked for it. They paid for their twisted acts of
“How did you leave things with Castiel? He left looking upset.”
Castiel wrinkled his nose. “Thank you for bringing up the divorce part. I was trying hard not to think about it.”
“Cas, let’s go. Let’s go now.”
“See ya,” Dean said. He locked eyes with Castiel. They were officially having a stare-down. Dean was good at those.
“Okay, don’t fish for compliments after I already gave you one. Fucking greedy.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Dean,” Castiel said.
“You could also visit me,” Dean said. “Although maybe that’s not such a good idea.”
“Make me,” Dean said, raising his eyebrows.
They continued walking in silence for a few more moments.
“That’s it?” Mrs. Barnes asked. “My house is ghost-free?”
Dean didn’t need to be told twice. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s shoulders and kissed him. Dean was kissing his husband now. Castiel was his husband.
“Not good enough,” Dean said, crossing his arms. “This girl, she’s clearly important to you, so I gotta make sure she’s not gonna screw you over like—”
And Dean's life was over.
“Alright, then,” Charlie said. “It looks like we have some rule breakers here. Our winner, or should I say
“No,” Castiel said, shifting uncomfortably.
The gas station wasn’t as full as the one in Denton had been. It was as though the more time passed, the decrease of the human population became more obvious. The thought alone startled Castiel, so he focused instead on filling up the tank. This gas station actually had an employee inside the store, and he was taking money, though he had a sign stating he was open to other forms of payment. Castiel just threw down the last of his cash and grabbed a few snacks for the road.
Dean laughed, but there was no humor in it. “Both of you lied to me.” Then he stood, looking as lost as a kid without his parents at a grocery store. “I thought you were my friends,” he muttered, quietly.
“Some kind of metadata company that provides TV listings for important clients. I don’t know. It’s his pride and joy. He built it from the ground and now it’s making him richer by the minute. You’d think something like that would have gone out of business by now with all these streaming services, but apparently people still have cable.”
“I thought so, too,” Dean said. “But my boyfriend turned out to be really clingy.”
“Hell yeah.”
“Thank you, sweetheart,” Ellen said with a smile.
“Where’s Dandy?” Ben asked.
Dean covered one of Castiel’s hands on his chest. “Will I see you tomorrow?”
“What if,” Cas said, slowly, “you test out the record on someone else?”
And so after a moment, Castiel lifted himself and sat back down, excruciatingly slow, like he was testing out the feeling to set the right pace. Dean didn’t rush him. He waited, flooded with pleasure from the unbelievable pressure. Castiel started going faster, more confident in what he was doing, and Dean met his movement with the lifting of his hips. Short after, their moans and pants filled the room like music. Castiel buried his fingers in Dean’s hair, angling his head so he could kiss down his throat and neck, nosing at his temple as he whispered soft words into his ear. Words filled with love and praise and admiration and Dean’s heart was going wild because he was so in love with this man and he wasn’t alone in this feeling and wasn’t that incredible?
“What time is it?” Dean mumbled, rubbing his eyes. He was still not ready to get up.
Castiel laughed. “Well, I’ll let you go so you can get to reading. And thank you for giving me the inspiration I needed to get some writing done tonight.”
Bobby grunted. “Where’s the beer?”
“It’s fine.”
Dean looked at Castiel. He hadn’t wanted to pry before, but since he brought it up, he would take his chance. “How are you doing...with that? With the divorce, I mean?”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “The plot thickens.”
“Good night, baby girl,” Dean whispered as Claire’s eyelids fluttered.
Dean smiled, clinking his bi flag with Castiel’s. “Good for you, Novak. I’m glad you got a flag of your own.”
Castiel looked at him. “I thought you didn’t believe in the supernatural.”
Dean snorted. “Quit sniffing me, you pervert.”
Dean laughed, turning to kiss the top of her head. “Hi, baby girl.”
But it was stupid to hold it in, especially when the point of his speech was that the more they stopped, the more time it would take them to arrive. And not going now would mean that Castiel would eventually have to stop again, and soon.
Dean didn’t think anything would be alright anymore. But he clung to that lie the same way he clung to Castiel.
“Can I see it?”
Dean’s best friend. That title’s been taken. Sorry, dude,” she added to Castiel.
“What’s the rush, man?” Dean asked beside him.
When he was done packing his groceries in his trunk and got behind the wheel of his car, Dean’s hands were shaking. Expectation mixed with longing and adrenaline was fueling him. Dean was texting his professor winky faces because he had an enormous crush on him and he was going to explode if he didn’t do something about it. But was a winky face the right move? Dean had no idea. So he went home.
“Dean, you shouldn’t have to do this. I shouldn’t have to depend on you like this.”
“Then keep quiet when you eat.”
“Something always feels off about her to you.”
-Calum Scott,
“Great. I was thinking about ordering some pizza for dinner.”
Charlie waved her hand. She was still at the table. “Dude, you are
Bobby turned to walk away, apparently done with this conversation. “Lock up when you leave.”
Anna sighed. “Okay, okay. All in favor of Beyonce.” She immediately turned around to see whether Castiel would side with her or not.
After the usual greetings, Dean went directly into the kitchen to put the dishes on the counter, making sure nothing had spilled on the way. He was so used to Castiel that he didn’t even flinch when he felt arms snaking around his hips and then lips on the back of his neck.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said with a cheerful smile.
Dean nodded. “Oh yeah. Well, I hang out with Cas a lot. He’s a good buddy of mine.”
“Here’s your drink,” Castiel said, placing a pink pineapple dream in front of him.
“I missed you,” Castiel said, pressing a trail of warm kisses on the back of Dean’s neck. “I got so used to sleeping with you that I had to hug my pillow all night.”
“Fine,” Dean said, unrolling himself. “I guess I can share.”
“Bye, Dean.”
Castiel pushed his pie towards Dean. “Try it. Judge it for yourself.”
Dean nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Crowley.”
“Good. I didn’t want it to be.”
Castiel threw Dean a glare.
“On the bed,” Dean said.
Castiel sighed, breaking their eye contact to look at the people bowling. “I’m just trying to not be your counselor, Dean. You asked me to keep my opinions to myself. It’s what I’m doing.”
Smiling, Amelia shook her head. “No, I’m never busy for you. Come sit with me.”
Dean smiled. “You’re right. Might as well.”
“I’m glad to hear that.”
“Me neither,” Dean said, panting as Castiel worked to undo his pants.
And then, he simply gave in to the moment.
“You’re so close,” Castiel said, holding his gaze. “Come on, you can do it.”
“What a nice surprise,” Ellen said, smiling. “I didn’t expect to see you boys here today.”
Castiel sighed. “I think it’s better if I go home.”
Under the table, Castiel tapped his foot against Dean’s. “Come on, she wants to see you. It’ll be fun.”
Dean spluttered, spitting out the Coke he’d just sipped. Then he slapped Castiel’s arm. “
Dean nodded, letting Jo lead him to a seat at the counter, where she placed a big piece of pumpkin pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Dean took one bite, and his mood was ten times better. But then it occurred to him that the vegan pie across the street was being served without ice cream, and his mood was sour again. God, that asshole was ruining everything.
“Yeah, he’s a natural,” Dean said.
Castiel stared at Dean’s profile, seeing his struggle as he continued the story.
Dean nodded. “Do you need anything from the kitchen? I’m going to grab some water. Unless you want to get it yourself…”
he would end it. Of everything he had to do—to sacrifice—in order to end the world’s destruction. But he put on a brave face for Castiel. “Yeah, we’re going to win this thing. We’re gonna kick some feathery angel ass.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. This was the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.
In that moment, the figure sprinted at them, running fast.
Dean reached for a muffin. “May I?”
Castiel didn’t bother with pleasantries. “What do you want?”
“You’ve been busy all day,” Castiel said, with a frown. “I’ve just missed you.”
Naomi smiled a tiny smile, but it looked genuine. “I didn’t believe Anna when she said you were here.”
Castiel looked sedated and happy. “How did you learn to make pies this good?”
Dean felt his ears warm up. “No. I haven’t tried it yet.”
Dean sat on the floor of his trailer and called Sam. His hands were shaking, so he put his phone on speaker and set it on his leg.
Rosa was standing there, hands on her hips and a knowing smile on her lips. “You guys done making out? I figured I should give you some privacy.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, making his way to the festive parking lot. The air was filled with smoke, but the pleasant kind. Beef patties, hot dogs, and a few pork chops were being grilled in a few spots, and Castiel walked past them, nodding at the friendly-looking people. A few of them offered him a hot dog and a beer, and Castiel saw his opening. He leaned on a blue pickup while he ate his hot dog in a few mouthfuls, realizing how hungry he was. After eating nothing but junk food throughout the day, this was the most sophisticated meal he’d had in days.
I should have realized sooner that you needed help with the wedding. I tend to see you as a superhero who can do a million things perfectly all at once, but I have to remind myself that you are human, and a very stubborn one at that.
Dean’s smile faded, and he set down the top part of the strawberry on the tupperware lid. “I know this isn’t probably how you imagined your life to go, Cas. I’m sorry things didn’t turn out differently.”
Dandy was sitting by her feet outside. Her current painting was of the night sky, the full moon bright. Amelia was so talented Castiel could get lost in all of her paintings.
“I know what you’re going to say,” Castiel said. “But I’m going to stop you. Our night is not ruined. It’s just getting started.” Castiel extended his hand. “Let’s go to our room.”
“Oh, God, not for a long time,” Jess said. “Sam and I had to plan our trip to France, like, a year ahead to get a bit of time off. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to plan the rest of our lives for a kid.”
Since Dean was driving, he wanted to pick the music. Unfortunately, Dean’s music revolved solely around classic rock and Castiel was tired of listening to the same songs repeatedly. Living with Dean had meant listening to classic rock all the time. When Dean cooked or cleaned or even sat down to read a book, he played classic rock. Castiel knew that Dean did listen to other types of music because Dean had pulled out his slow song playlist not so long ago, the night they’d slow danced to what Castiel believed was now their song:
His phone went off five minutes later.
“Yeah, me too.”
“I’m not worried about you,” Castiel said. “I was pointing out a positive thing.”
The first thing he noticed upon entering Heaven’s Bistro was the warmth. Compared to the outside, walking in here felt like being covered up in cozy blankets after a long day out. The air smelled like Christmas morning, with a mixture of cinnamon, pumpkin, and chocolate. The walls were painted a light blue, with a few art pieces resembling angels adorning the empty spaces. The tables were all unique, some rounded and some squared, and there were couches were people could just lounge. The floor was covered in black tiles that somehow sparkled. Despite the large amount of people in the place, it didn’t feel crowded. Dean was able to walk between the tables to the front counter, where one of the white minions greeted him with a smile.
Dean shifted on his seat. “What are you doing after this? We could go out for beers, if you have time.”
Castiel shook his head, bending down to press his lips on Dean’s forehead. Then he kissed his nose, his cheekbones, his chin, his lips.
Dean laughed. “Sounds like you had a big day. Go say hi to Bobby and Ellen.”
“Exercise isn’t gross.” Sam narrowed his eyes at Dean. “You should try it sometime. You know, to live a long and healthy life.”
“No,” Claire said.
Castiel sighed. “Of course it was.”
“You need anything else?” Dean asked.
“I don’t care.”
“No,” Castiel said, because he was far too angry to keep his thoughts to himself.
“I just—Okay, never mind. Forget it.”
“That’s awesome. Does she sell them?”
Dean bit his lip as he waited with anticipation for Castiel to get his fingers coated. They’d done this enough to know what the other liked, so they often got straight to the point within minutes. Dean knew that Castiel would eventually want to try to bottom, but Dean was in no hurry to change their current roles. Castiel was amazing in bed, but that was to be expected. Castiel was amazing at pretty much everything.
Ben tilted his head to the side. “Why don’t you wanna live with us anymore, Dad?”
Castiel looked at his sandwich for a really long time. “My mom died. She was killed, actually. And Dad couldn’t handle it. He disappeared. We haven’t seen him in almost twenty years.”
Dean smiled. He loved being called Castiel’s muse. And it was true, Dean was his muse. “Well, I’ll still try not to get in your way too much now that I know you’re almost done. It’s just that my work days are so long, and I always have so much to tell you when I get home. I never really…” Dean looked away. “Lisa never really liked listening to me talk about my day.”
“I’ll drive.” Castiel took the keys from Dean and drove the short distance to their hotel.
“Dean, I
“No.” Castiel shook his head, moving slowly over to his side of the bed. “I never knew you needed glasses. Do you wear contacts?”
“Okay.” Castiel packed his last pair of socks and closed the suitcase.
Dean found himself pressing his lips to the top of Castiel’s head, completely naturally, as though they did this all the time. Castiel responded by holding him tighter.
Dean shook his head. The thought of Castiel with anyone made him feel queasy, but picturing him with Lisa? That was on another level. The thing that really got to him, though, was that Castiel had never allowed himself to believe he could have a chance with Dean. He squeezed Castiel’s hand. “Cas, I had no idea.”
By the end of the night, Dean said goodbye to everyone, thanking Bobby for opening his house to them yet again.
Ben’s laughter filled the space around them every time Dean pretended to be a shark chasing after him. Ben would swim towards Castiel for protection, and Castiel would help Ben jump onto his back to keep him away from Shark Dean. Dean stuck his tongue out at Castiel before he submerged his head under the water and swam in circles around them while Ben kept clinging his arms around Castiel’s neck.
Cas.”
Castiel looked back at Claire, who was now staring at him, blinking her wet eyelashes. “That’s true. I do love her very much.”
“Mom, stay out of our relationship. We don’t need your input.”
The truth hit Dean like a thousand-pound weight. All this time, all these years, Castiel had wanted Dean, and Dean had been sure he’d hated him. Dean had spent so long fighting with Castiel, antagonizing him as much as possible, but Castiel hadn’t wanted that. Dean couldn’t believe how stupid he’d been all those years. He could have made an effort sooner. He could have had
“Fuck.” Castiel took Dean’s hand. “We’ll go together. And we’ll stay close. No running off on your own, Dean.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You sound just like my mom. You two would love each other.”
Raejean leaned up on her elbows. “You have a brother?”
Dean smiled, lowering his hands from his face. “Go sit down. I’ll get your food.”
Dean couldn’t believe how easy all of them fit in the house. For a second, he could almost feel at home. And not just because he had his own bedroom here, but because this was starting to feel like a family again. Even with Castiel and Anna present. It was a strange, pleasant feeling.
“Thank you, Dean. I’ll be very careful with them.”
Jo gasped. “Every time I sing karaoke, you tell me I sound great!”
Dean turned on his seat to smile at her. Just the sight of her made him feel calm again. “We were at the same comic book store,” Dean said, holding her gaze. “I asked the guy at the counter if they had the new Wonder Woman comic, and they said they only had one copy left but it was already taken, and then he pointed at this geeky redhead wearing a neon yellow sweater and these thick-rimmed blue glasses. I walked right up to you and I said—”
“That’s nothing,” Jo said. “This guy at my office thinks he can speak to angels. Actual angels. He says he’s on the angel radio. And they can predict the future. Yeah, he told me I’m going to die at 90. I mean, not bad. But still.”
Castiel looked at Dean, smiling softly. “That doesn’t surprise me.”
“Castiel,” she said. “Will you let me know if you plan on taking more than thirty minutes with my breakfast? There is a medication I need to take soon, but I cannot take it on an empty stomach. So, I might have to eat an apple or an orange in order to take it.”
“That’s a reasonable fear to have,” Jody said. “Dean, how does that make you feel?”
Even though Claire was wearing arm floaties, Castiel kept holding his breath whenever Claire went from his arms to Dean’s, wanting to jump instead of being handed over. Claire might be a calm baby most times, but never in the water. Claire wanted to be on her own and make up her own rules. She was obviously too small to swim yet, so they had to watch her even more carefully.
“Hey, I have an idea,” Castiel said, locking eyes with Dean for a brief second.
“Cas, I found your suitcase,” Dean said, holding it up. “What else do you need to put in here?”
Then Dean asked Anna the same question.
“We only have two full days here.” Castiel looked at the sidewalk. “I’ve enjoyed myself more than I had imagined.”
They clinked their hot chocolate and leaned closer into each other on the couch, watching the ridiculous Christmas horror movie they liked so much.
Dean looked at his brother, and the tiredness in his eyes. “I know, Sammy.”
“Should we steal a gun?” Dean asked, as though he’d read his mind.
Sam returned to the table with the jam and handed it to Castiel. He gave a knowing look to Dean and a thumbs up before he sat back down.
“Yeah, you’re right.” Sam was always right. “I’m gonna keep my distance from Cas. I think it’s for the best.”
Castiel leaned in to kiss Claire’s cheek, and then, when he kissed Dean’s cheek, Castiel held his face in his hands. “I’m not stalling. I just want you to know how much I appreciate having you here.”
“Ben’s right,” Castiel said. Then he dove down under the water to grab at Dean’s legs, pulling him down with him. Dean glared at him again, but Castiel smiled, keeping him down there a couple more seconds before releasing him and resurfacing together.
pajamas and he loved them—and followed the smell into the kitchen.
“I can help you with that,” Castiel offered.
, which has brought us even closer together, if you can believe it.”
“Dean?” Castiel said.
“Uh, did I just call you babe?” Dean asked, trying to sound clueless. He laughed, though he sounded a little insane. “I was kidding, obviously. Sometimes I call Cas babe because he’s my good buddy, you know? Guys call their guy friends babe sometimes. Cas is my bro. He’s my bro, and bro sounds a lot like babe. It’s easy to get it mixed up.”
Amelia laughed. “Oh, I don’t doubt it.”
“Feet off the table.”
Raejean smiled, staring ahead as they walked back to their bikes. Raejean had found a Harley-Davison, which she had envied at first, but now she thought it suited her best. There was something fierce, yet eloquent about Raejean. It was in the way she carried herself, confident, but eager to please. It was hard not to trust her.
Dean took the chair beside her. The waiting room wasn’t super busy at this time. Dean’s leg was bouncing again.
“Huh? Oh, yeah, I think so.”
“She needs a friend, Dean.”
Dean nodded and went into the bathroom to change. Castiel’s sweats fit Dean a little tight, but not uncomfortably so. His AC/DC shirt was three sizes too big. Dean brushed his teeth meticulously, mostly to get the taste of Aaron out of his mouth. It suddenly dawned on him that he had run straight to Castiel after kissing Aaron. For some reason he’d felt extremely guilty for what happened with Aaron. He’d felt like he needed to come clean to Castiel about it. And now, what was he doing? Sleeping in his bed. Why? Why the hell did he think this was a good idea?
“Where would we find a landline in this century?”
“Thanks,” Dean said, grabbing one of the bottles. His throat was feeling a little dry. He took a sip and then gripped the bottle in his hands.
Dean was in the middle of a call, or he would have said something in return. But he looked at Castiel and smiled. He already knew he would miss the hell out of him.
Castiel sat up. “I would offer you more alcohol, but I’m afraid we drank it all.”
Dean sighed, rubbing his forehead. Yeah, yeah, he knew he was supposed to be a good host to his family. But Castiel was leaving soon, too. “We’re having dinner with Gabe tonight, aren’t we?”
“Yeah, hmm.”
“Have you considered that I’m here because I wanted your company?”
“You really like him, don’t you?”
Castiel rolled his eyes, and Dean laughed once they made it outside.
“Good,” Dean said. “Sorry about everyone. They sort of showed up. Charlie and Rosa brought muffins.” Dean motioned to the basket of muffins on the counter.
“Cas,” Dean whispered back, because that was the only thing he could say anymore. “Cas. Cas. Cas.”
“Beers or tattoo first?” Dean asked, slurping the last of the chocolate milkshake.
Castiel smiled at him. “Why don’t we call it a
“The hardest part, I think, will be having to kiss you, Dean,” Castiel said. “I don’t know how I will bear it. Can you even picture it? The two of us kissing, in front of everyone? In front of hundreds of thousands of people?” Castiel was trying hard to hide his smirk. He was enjoying this way too much.
Castiel continued reading the book.
“Then we’ll just sit here quietly,” Castiel said, removing his ring. Discreetly, he tucked it in his front pocket.
When breakfast was ready, they sat down to eat. Dean looked so excited as he ate his French toast and bit onto the bacon. Castiel would remember to make him breakfast more often just to get to wake up to a happy Dean.
“I hope you love talking to me enough to share some of your ice cream because I already finished mine.” Anna tried to steal some of Castiel’s ice cream with her spoon, but he held it out of her reach.
“I see a clever baby girl,” Castiel said. “She’s your daughter. She wants you to go on more walks with her and your dog. She also really wants you to stop giving her chocolate milk before bed because it makes it so much harder to sleep.”
The song ended, but then it started all over again.
“No, Dean,” Castiel said, before Meg had the chance to answer. “Meg is…she’s my ex-wife.”
“Hello to you, too,” Dean said into Castiel’s ear.
“You have a brother?”
Dean glared at Sam, who only grinned wider. That sneaky little giant. “I don’t know if Cas would be interested in some boring dinner.”
“That’s such a simple song.” With another smug smile, Sam played the song better than Dean had in the hour and a half he’d been practicing.
Aaron blinked, completely stunned as he moved back to his side of the seat. “Oh. I thought. I mean, I thought you did. You said you wanted to show me around.”
Dean tensed immediately. He hadn’t been aware that they were boyfriends. Holy shit. Is that what they were? Boyfriends? Since when? This was real then. This was a serious, mature relationship. Dean was in a relationship. With Castiel. With Castiel Novak. Dean Winchester was Castiel Novak’s boyfriend. Oh, God.
“Yeah, all good.” Dean ate the remains of the pecan pie slowly, rethinking all the ways in which he was maybe
Ever since Dean got home, he had done nothing but check his phone for texts or calls that wouldn’t come. Dean wasn’t even sure what had happened earlier that day. Had he just had a fight with Castiel over the new guy? Why was he so angry, though?
Castiel got up close to Dean, to the point that his nose touched Dean’s, and Dean couldn’t help it when he took two steps back. Castiel could be really intimidating when he wanted to be. “You are getting dressed and in my car so I can drive you to Charlie’s party. I’m not leaving here without you. You got it?”
Then another text came in. And another.
“This should be good research for our graphic novel,” Castiel said, thumbing through the book.
“You don’t have my phone number,” Castiel reminded him. “If you’d like to wait until I get back, I can accompany you. As backup, of course.” Dean had been so terrified of Craigslist. Castiel might have been teasing now, just a little.
They were in Castiel’s hotel room getting ready for the New Year’s Eve party at Charlie’s house. It was the first time in many years that Charlie decided to host such an event, and neither Dean nor Castiel were going to miss it. Charlie, on top of being the kindest, smartest friend they had in common, was incredibly successful. She’d recently bought a new house in L.A., which Dean called a mansion based solely on photographs, and they had both flown in from Kansas just to see it for themselves.
Dean nodded. “Then we’ll be there.”
“Maybe not.”
“Ellen,” Castiel said, swallowing hard. “Hey.”
“Definitely,” Castiel said, already out of his seat. He thanked Sam and Jess for dinner, and then he was, finally, heading out the door.
Castiel smiled back. “Do you feel better?”
“I found Dean’s baby photos in his closet, and you are so in for a treat,” Jess said.
“Yes,” Castiel said again. “Yes, Dean. Let’s get married. I want to marry you.”
Dean squeezed his hand. “I kept trying to convince myself that we were better off as friends.”
: Too late. I’m on my way.
For a few seconds, neither of them said anything. Castiel didn’t rush Dean as Dean continued looking at the drawing. Dean had no words to offer Castiel. He felt a surge of warmth from the pit of his stomach all the way to his cheeks. He felt like the center of attention, but the only one who was looking at him was Castiel, and that was enough for Dean.
“Dean, are you alright? I can’t believe that woman came back out of the blue. She’s fucking unbelievable! I’m all the way here when I should be with you right now. I hate the thought of Lisa being around you. I hate the thought of you being anywhere near her, too.”
“And you’re still okay with this whole eloping thing? You don’t want to wait for a real wedding with all of your extended family and friends?”
“On November 4th, Amelia went into labor,” Castiel continued. “I was in my office writing when she calmly informed me that she needed me to drive her to the hospital because Claire was on her way. My hands were shaking so badly that I couldn’t start my truck. Amelia comforted me as her water broke. I was amazed at how strong my wife was. That day, and every day. Her last smile was for Claire, our daughter. It’s the way I plan on remembering Amelia, smiling, caring for our daughter despite the dire situation she was in. Because Amelia Novak was a fighter, until her very last breath.” Castiel swallowed. “Thank you.”
Dean sighed. He should have never lent Sam his favorite record. The kid was in college, and his dorm was as clean as a pigsty. Dean turned to the guy behind the register, who was still very invested in the comic book. Now that he was closer he saw that it was a Harley Quinn comic. Of course it was.
Dean followed Cas to a room behind the counter covered up by a black curtain. It was a small office, with a cluttered desk filled with papers and books. There was a recliner as well, placed right next to a side table holding up a record player. Before Dean could speak, Cas shoved Dean into the recliner, going as far as pulling the handle that brought Dean’s feet up in the air.
“My boyfriend is a famous author. There’s a sentence I never thought I’d say.”
Castiel licked his lips, and Dean followed the action. “I’m sure she did.”
They had an eye on her, but she was fast, and she wasn’t the only human they had to take care of. It was tricky to lose them, but not impossible. She had learned how to keep them distracted.
“Oh yeah?”
“Yes, Dean. I know. But you don’t even know him. Maybe you should give him a chance.”
Castiel placed a tentative hand on top of both of Dean’s hands on the table. “You’re a beautiful person, Dean. I hope you know that.”
Castiel lifted his glass up to Dean’s. “To living again.”
“Do you think Ben would want his father self-destructing with alcohol? Do you think Ben wanted any of this for you? If you can’t get help for you, at least do it for Ben.”
For a minute, Dean allowed himself to wonder what it would have been like to know Castiel as a teenager in high school. Castiel was two years older than Dean, so he would have been an upperclassman while Dean was not. Castiel would have asked Dean out on a romantic date and then proceeded to take him to dinner and a movie. Maybe he would have reached for Dean’s hand halfway through the movie. Then he would have driven Dean home and kissed him goodnight at the door. God, Dean would have melted right then and there.
, Dumbo.”
Castiel caught sight of Kevin heading to the door. “Don’t drool on my couch.”
On his way to the living room, Castiel saw Chuck’s bedroom door slightly open. He wasn’t going to invade his friend’s privacy, but he wanted to see if Chuck was in his room or not. Fortunately, Castiel didn’t need to sneak a peek inside because he heard Chuck’s uneven snoring. He debated whether or not to leave a note so Chuck wouldn’t worry about Castiel’s whereabouts when he woke up, but thought better of it. They weren’t roommates, not officially. And mostly, Castiel wished this wouldn’t be permanent.
Dean scoffed. “That’s harsh.”
“Then you better get some rest tonight.” Raejean leaned back down, draped an arm over her eyes. “And let me rest.”
“You’re a better father than that man could ever hope to be.”
“It really was. I thought we would wait until after dinner. Have it be this really romantic moment. A nice way to ring in the new year.”
Dean removed his headphones after the episode of
“You’re welcome,” Bobby said, going back inside.
Dean nodded. “See you, man.”
Ben loved swimming with Dandy. The look of sheer joy on his face was something Castiel would never get tired of seeing. Dean was happy, staring at his son with pride.
Castiel looked at Dean, and then shot him one of his bright smiles. “I’d love to try your famous lasagna, Dean.”
Dean,
“That was unbelievable,” Charlie said. “Dean, I’ve never heard you sing before. Your voice doesn’t suck, my friend.”
“Shut up,” Dean said, grabbing boxer briefs and some pants to wear. “Are you gonna shower too? I have clean towels in the bathroom closet. I should have some new toothbrushes too. Help yourself.”
“I had to squish the grumpy out of you. Had to be done.”
“Oh yeah,” Dean said. “They’re sorta sensitive, aren’t they?”
do that, because Anna was his only sister, and he was her older brother, but the truth was, he was weak. Venturing out on his own was too risky, and he didn’t think he could do it. The biggest reason was that Castiel couldn’t lose track of Dean, especially now that he was the main angel target.
Castiel frowned. “By who?”
Dean opened his mouth, but nothing came out. And then he said, “
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel said.
Castiel looked over at Dean, raising his eyebrows. “We’re friends?”
“It seems that way,” Dean said. “I never thought we’d be doing this again. I always thought that was a closed chapter of my life.” He didn’t mean for that to sound so weighted, but it definitely came out that way.
Castiel snorted. “Shut up.”
Castiel was holding a single red rose in his hand. “Good evening, Dean.”
: You evil mastermind you.
him yet.
There was silence in the room while Dean and Castiel stared at each other. Without Anna, the atmosphere was thicker. There were unspoken words between them and they both knew it, but Dean didn’t know if it was time to cross that line again. It was starting to become clearer why Anna left so suddenly.
Chuck smiled coyly, shaking his head. “No, but I’m still waiting for it. In the meantime, I’m doing my best. I’m the head cook at a nice diner. I live modestly, and sometimes I wish I wasn’t perpetually single, but mostly I’m alright. I think you will be too, Cas.”
“Valentine’s Day.”
Sam stared at Dean when he stepped out of his room. Alright, so Dean never took this long getting ready. And maybe he’d overdone it with the black blazer and button-up green shirt, but Castiel had told him to dress up. He didn’t want to stand out in whatever restaurant they were going to.
“Talk about what?” Castiel asked, suddenly curious.
In all these months, Dean had never been to Castiel’s house. They’d always gone back to Dean’s apartment. Dean felt the most comfortable there. Besides, Jack would always bring them two coffees, ever since Castiel staying over became a regular thing. Jack wasn’t at all surprised to find that Dean and Castiel were together. In fact, he thought it’d taken them long enough.
“You’re my boyfriend, so there’s no competition.”
“That’s none of your business,” Bobby said. “Idjit.”
Castiel smiled, shoving Chuck and Kevin out of the kitchen. “Go take a nap or something. I’ll take care of everything back here.”
The plane took off, and Dean held his breath until it was safe enough to unbuckle their seatbelts. Castiel loosened his hold on Dean’s hand, but Dean refused to let go.
“I hate to break up your little love fest—which is gross, by the way—and remind you both that we no longer have a car.”
Castiel smiled softly. “I’ve really missed you, you know.”
“I’m going to cook for you tonight. I make the best burgers. I’m making pie for dessert.”
The last time Dean had been here, he’d made a total fool of himself in front of Ellen, so he didn’t blame her for asking that question. But he was relieved when Castiel answered.
Shit. Dean hadn’t thought about any of that. Of course Amelia would hate the thought of going camping, especially in her state. It was a stupid idea. “Sorry, man. I wasn’t thinking.”
Rhonda grinned, her lips a deep red and her teeth blindingly white. She looked flawless, and she had been brought here as Dean’s date. Leaving Castiel as not the third wheel, but the fifth wheel. How much worse could this get?
“That reason was supposed to be love.”
“Yeah.”
Dean wasn’t sure how much time passed as they continued kissing slowly and deeply against the kitchen counter. All he knew was that he’d never been kissed like this. Like Dean was the most important person in the world at the moment. Like Dean mattered. Castiel seemed to gain pleasure just by getting Dean to gasp or pant or groan. Dean was sure of this because every time he did it, Castiel smiled during the kiss. But Dean wanted to hear the same noises from Castiel, too. So he aligned his body at just the right place, rubbing his thigh against that bulge in Castiel’s pants he’d felt earlier. Not only did Castiel moan long and loud, he bucked his hips against Dean’s, sucking Dean’s lower lip between both of his.
“You haven’t said much about her. I’d like to know more about this woman who loves Queen.”
Hopefully I'll have this finished soon!
“Alright, if you’re sure,” Aaron said, shrugging.
Right at that moment, Dean’s phone rang. He answered quickly. “Hello?”
friends. That’ll never change. Dean makes me happy, Sam. And I plan on making him happy, too. For as long as he allows me.”
“It’s alright. I’ll see you tomorrow. You sure you don’t want me to pick you up at the airport? There are, like, four cars at the house. I don’t know why my mom owns so many.”
“If I had been a better boyfriend, maybe then—”
Dean’s heart fluttered, as though he were in high school and his crush had just confessed his true feelings for him. “You’re pretty great, you know that?”
“What do you mean, hell?”
Dean wanted to scream. “Do you hear yourself? You can’t possibly believe any of this crap. Fuck, Lisa, I never thought you could be this
“A garden?” Castiel mused. “That sounds nice. I’ve never been good with plants. I’ve killed five mint plants. After the fifth one, I just felt like it was abuse to keep trying.”
Dean waved a hand, dismissively. Then he wiggled his eyebrows at Sam and Jess. “Guess who I am. Go on, guess.”
“I don’t know,” Dean said, trying to think of something he could actually sing on key. Dean hadn’t even realized that Castiel had left, but when he came back, he had two more shots. Both for Dean. “Hey, no, if I’m getting drunk, so are you.”
After breakfast, they packed everything they needed for the road and stuffed it into the Impala—they’d both decided to take one car this time, without a fight, even—and they set out to Chuck’s.
“Of course we will,” Dean said, moving his hands in soothing motions on Castiel’s back. “It’s you and me now, buddy. We’re in this together.”
“Of course.” Castiel cleared his throat, composing himself. “I will bring you another latte.”
“But it worked.” Castiel got out of bed, strolling into the bathroom with a bounce in his step.
“That’s reassuring.”
Dean put the phone back in his pocket. “To be an annoying little brother.”
“There has to be a porta potty outside,” Castiel said.
“No. I mean, I don’t know. I haven’t known Lisa that long. I like her. But I also like Dean. And I don’t like that she’s keeping secrets from him.”
“When did you hear that?” Dean asked. “Cas
“I missed you, too, squirt.” Sam kissed the top of his head, and Ben finally let him go. Then he handed Dean the empty Capri-Sun.
Dean nodded, trying to reach for the rest of the strawberry milkshake, but Castiel slapped his hand away, sipping it himself. “You’re probably right about that.”
Bobby quirked his lips into the faintest grin. “I like the way you think. Like I said, I’ll be here bright and early tomorrow.”
“I saw it,” Jo said. “But you don’t have the rights over pumpkin pie. What are you going to say to him? You can’t sell pie because I said so? Just calm down, Dean.”
When Dean woke up on Saturday morning in Castiel’s bed, he wasn’t as disoriented as he’d been the first time. Probably because Dean had been sleeping in Castiel’s bed all week. It could also be because Castiel was lying in front of him, staring at Dean with those intense blue eyes.
Dean took Castiel’s hand and was hauled to his feet, then tugged into Castiel’s personal space. They were standing just inches apart, and Dean let out a small gasp when he felt Castiel’s other hand circling his waist, pulling him even closer so that their chests touched.
Dean grinned. “You really think so? I fucking love karaoke, man. It’s awesome.”
Dean’s sobs had dwindled to nothing, but he still sat shaking in Castiel’s arms. Holding him tight and close to his chest, Castiel hoped Dean got his silent promise that he would never leave his side. Dean needed to know now more than ever than he could always count on Castiel, that Castiel would never abandon him. Dean’s face was buried in Castiel’s neck as Castiel continued brushing the hair at the nape of his neck, and when Dean pulled away, his cheeks were red and wet, and his eyes big and puffy. Castiel couldn’t stand seeing Dean this way, but there wasn’t much he could do to ease his pain. If only he could find a way to track Lisa down somehow.
“Hey, I wanted to ask, do you…do you want to come with me?” There it was. The question he’d been dreading to ask. Before any of the kissing, before Dean even realized he wanted Castiel in more than simply platonic ways, Dean wanted Castiel to accompany him on this and every adventure. Castiel was his best friend. There was no one else he would rather have on his passenger seat.
Castiel gave him a crooked smile, full of warmth that only Castiel could give him. “I know how that feels. It’s not easy. But the memories, those are what keep you hanging on.”
“Not far, just follow me.”
“You like that one, don’t you?” Dean asked, winking.
Castiel sighed. “Alright. But don’t look.”
Dean hadn’t been able to stop smiling since he woke up, and people were starting to notice. First, Pamela pointed out how different Dean was acting from the previous day.
“Got it!” Dean called back.
Castiel squeezed Dean’s knee before removing his hand. “I never get tired of watching them fall in love.”
“You’re good. At air guitar, I mean.”
“I hope you know how much you mean to me, Dean Winchester,” Castiel whispered into his ear.
“That’s right, honey,” Castiel said. “That’s your Mah. She was a gifted artist with a passion for classic cars.”
“That’s amazing, Dean. I wasn’t expecting that. Truthfully, I had prepared myself for a very long and loud argument. It’s the reason I didn’t bring Ben with me. I figured I should test the waters first.”
“That’s alright. I’ll pray for both of us.”
“I look?”
Gabriel snapped his fingers—and if he did that one more time, Dean would snap his neck—and Dean found himself in a large white empty room. He had no idea what was happening, but he reacted pretty quickly when he saw someone dressed in a ridiculous devil outfit. Whoever it was, they were dressed in red from head to toe, their face was hidden from view, and a colorful tail and horns completed the ensemble.
Dean sipped his beer. “I don’t know. I don’t want to lose him.”
Anna locked eyes with Castiel once more. They did that a lot, the whole silent-communication thing. “If you let us drive, I’ll let you listen to any music you want for the rest of the trip.”
They watched the drag show, which was pretty fucking fantastic. Then, they danced to the music from the live rock band that was made up of four butch lesbians. They were badasses.
“What the hell are we gonna do about Ben?” Bobby asked, adjusting his cap.
“I’ve never taken mine off,” Dean said. “Do you ever hear me complain?”
Dean practically ran out of Charlie and Rosa’s house, jogging all the way to his driveway up the street. He went inside directly to the fridge for a beer and then to his backyard, where he slumped down onto a chair, shut his eyes, and gulped down the bitter liquid.
“I’ve felt that way before,” Chuck said, sipping his wine. “It’s like you lost your purpose, but you’re waiting for a big epiphany to guide you on your next stage in life.”
That last kiss managed to wake Dean up, and he mumbled incoherently, wiping his mouth where drool was starting to drip down. Castiel thought it was endearing, and he felt privileged to be able to witness Dean drooling in bed.
Jess was the one brave enough to break it. “I’m so sorry, Castiel. We had no idea that Dean would invite you. Not that we didn’t want to see you. But you get it, right? Dean has been alone for so long. We were hoping that Rhonda could help him move on from all that awful stuff that happened to him.”
Castiel pressed play on his touchscreen stereo and a cheerful song started playing. It was another 60’s song, unsurprisingly. Dean realized he was familiar with many 60’s music, and it was likely from his parents listening to it while he was growing up. Well, other than Queen.
Dean smiled something small, but it reached his eyes this time and that was enough for Castiel. “I’m gonna believe you because I know you wouldn’t lie to me. I just—fuck—I woke up one morning terrified because you weren’t in bed, and then I let my fears grow and eat me alive. I thought running away would solve my problems. That’s always been my solution.” Dean uncrossed his arms and reached for Castiel’s hand instead, holding it tight. “I’m sorry for trying to break up with you. And thanks for not letting me.”
Castiel had noticed that something was off with Dean, but Dean had refused to talk about it. If he talked about it, Castiel might realize that he didn’t actually want to be with Dean.
“Which one is that, Uncle Cas?” Ben asked.
Charlie was holding a clipboard and a pen. “Just wanted to see what you’re entering to the competition. I figured pie was a given, but you never know.”
“I may be a demon, but I can still bleed,” Raejean said. “I don’t like to be messy.”
“Are you having a good time, Dean?” Castiel looked at him with uninhibited warmth.
The one good thing about Castiel, if there was any, was that he gave as good as he took.
Dean shoved the phone to Castiel, who took it quickly. “Google says my flowers won’t grow in the fall. I spent all day working on this stupid garden for nothing.” Dean ran his hands through his hair. He felt like a total dumbass.
“You’d seriously do this?” Dean asked, leaning forward on the table. “You’d travel the country with our daughter? For me?”
“I found him,” Castiel said. “Before I tell you what happened, Dean is safe and sound, and he’s currently sitting on his couch drinking tea.”
There was some babbling on the other side of the line. A lot of “ahhhh’s” and “bah’s” and “dah’s.”
There was a documentary about starfish on TV that was just quiet enough to help him go to sleep.
“Show me,” Dean said, huddling closer to the laptop.
“Your turn,” Castiel said, mildly annoyed.
“It’s kinda hard to sleep when your bones are broken.”
With a sigh, Dean turned around and walked back outside.
“I promise, I will go out there and be a dad, but I just need some time.” His voice broke, so he stayed quiet for a short minute. “I just need some time, Dean.”
Castiel smiled. “So. How was your weekend?”
. It was a song that Castiel had never before heard him play. Dean harmonized the “ooooh’s” perfectly with the guitar strums. He might only know how to play a few songs, but he’d gotten pretty good at playing them.
“I think that’s the point. You’re not supposed to root for them.”
“Yeah, and let’s just hope Anna isn’t too drunk to drive by now,” Dean said.
Gabriel clapped Dean’s shoulder. “You’re a keeper.”
“So it goes,” Dean said, chewing on his cereal. He hadn’t had a real dinner since Castiel left home. There was no point in cooking an elaborate meal for one.
“Visage? Um, no. And who listens to 80s music other than housewives doing aerobics, anyway?”
Dean went directly to the backyard, spotting Ben now standing with two other kids, sipping a Capri-Sun as they all pet Dandy, who stood very still as she received attention. Dean wanted to make sure he had eyes on Ben during the entire interaction. It was important to him.
Sam let out a long breath, sitting forward on the edge of the couch. His face was completely serious now. “I hate to sound overprotective, but Dean is the closest family I have. After what Lisa did to him, I feel like I need to look out for him now more than ever. I just have to ask, what are your intentions with my brother?”
Dean nodded. “What are we playing?”
“It needs a lot of work,” Castiel said. “I am aware. I will start editing it right away. Though I was hoping you would at least enjoy it slightly.”
Dean groaned. “You’re no fun.”
“We didn’t get much sleep last night,” Castiel said.
Dean rolled his eyes and ate his ice cream. When he was done with it, cone and everything, he turned to Castiel, determined. Castiel was also done with his ice cream, and he was smirking at Dean. “I think I know what’ll make you take me back.”
“No, that’s not what I meant,” Dean said. “I can’t make it to the bathroom.”
“Yeah, so I’d appreciate it if we just never talked about that ever again, thank you.” Dean cleared his throat. “Well, Cas, it means a lot that you’ve followed my career so closely. I’ve followed yours as well. I’m a big fan of the holiday rom-coms.
Due to his offer, though, Castiel’s office had a long line after class. Dean could do nothing but wait his turn. And wait he did. It took nearly two hours to get through all of the students. Once the last one was gone, Dean stepped inside.
“Yeah, well they’re all here for you, buddy,” Aaron said, clinking his beer against Castiel’s. “Wait until you see the cake. It’s on a table over there.”
“Yeah, got my homework done.”
“Yeah.” After a beat, Dean said, “Cas, what do you think about the ending?”
“You were there for me when I lost my son,” Dean said. “We can call it even.”
Benjamin nodded. “I’m considering moving closer. Who knows?”
“Right. Of course. I’ll sign all the paperwork you need me to sign.”
“Oh, I’m sorry.” Aaron sipped his beer. “I forgot we’re still in high school.”
Sam shrugged. “You get used to it.”
. Castiel liked the sound of that.
Castiel groaned, leaning his forehead on Dean’s shoulder. “You drive me crazy, Winchester.”
Taking care of himself? Dean wasn’t sure how to do that. It was a foreign concept. Jody had tried to talk to him about self-care countless times, but it seemed to be one of those things that had never really stuck. Dean had a habit of putting everyone ahead of himself. He didn’t know how to put himself first. Ever. How would he even start?
Dean sighed deeply, rubbing a hand over his face as he heard the door of the bathroom shut. This would be a long day.
“Is a glass of water with ice okay?” Sam asked.
Dean couldn’t keep his mouth shut any longer. “Look, Charles, I don’t know you, but you’re really pissing me off. If you have such an important meeting to go to, maybe you should go. I’m sure Anna won’t mind updating you on your ex-wife’s health if you’re really interested.”
“Is there a reason you’re calling?”
Castiel was quiet for a while. “Dean, did you always know you’d be a good father? Did you ever have doubts?”
Dean widened his eyes. “Oh, really?”
“I swear, humans are so confusing. They say one thing, but they mean something entirely different. Who could understand you? Bunch of cocky animals.”
Castiel chuckled. “I suggest we find a place to sleep, unless you want to spend the night in the car at an abandoned parking lot.” They were outside of an old warehouse building, completely desolate.
“Why are you so afraid of
“No, Jess,” Sam said, wincing again as he turned to face her. “You should get some rest too. You’ve been by my side all day long, and you need sleep. I’ll be fine here. I’ll yell if I need anything.”
“Do it inside,” Dean said, not understanding the problem.
“It’s summer. He deserves to rest from all that school shit. Kindergarten was tough on the kid.” Ben would be six in July, and then he would start first grade. It felt like it was yesterday when Ben took his first steps. Or when he said his first word: dad!
This felt new and different. It wasn’t just the fact that they’d never danced together. It was more. Maybe it was that being this close to Castiel was making Dean very nervous. But the good kind of nervous. The kind that was filled with longing and expectation. Dean had never felt this emotionally charged while dancing.
“You never hated me?” Dean asked, because his brain was mush and he couldn’t think straight.
The thought of losing Castiel, regardless of his relationship to him, was painful. After four days of knowing him, Castiel mattered to Dean. He mattered so much it was scary. Castiel and Anna.
“Okay,” Charlie said, pulling back. Her mascara was running and she looked a little scary.
“What’s that wonderful smell?” Ellen asked.
Lisa widened her eyes. “You did?”
cared.”
“I love doing that,” Charlie said. “Dean, sit up. The camera can’t see you when you’re lying on Cas’s crotch.”
“Yeah, that’s the plan. He’s bringing Jess.”
“I kinda miss him, too.”
“Oh, I bet. You’re not sweet at all.”
Castiel’s laughter was low and rough like his voice before he kissed Dean again and, this time, it felt more insistent and determined. Castiel tugged Dean’s waist until they both ended up laying completely horizontal in bed, both of them on their sides facing each other, never breaking out of the kiss. Castiel’s hand was under Dean’s shirt now, touching Dean’s stomach, which was more pudgy than firm, and Dean broke the kiss again.
Dean looked at him again. “Yeah, I know.” Then he smiled. Soft, and genuine.
“Of course,” Castiel said easily.
“Let’s keep it that way.” Dean crossed his arms. “Pack your bags and go. I need some breathing room.”
Castiel paused his movements, his lips just below Dean’s ear. “Dean.”
“Castiel, come on.”
Dean sat up in one swift movement, which did not help his headache. “Oh no. Did I actually sing karaoke?”
Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and held it tight. “Castiel and I are getting married.”
Castiel seemed to consider this. “Alright. You can have my fries.”
Dean was driving, which was making it so easy for Castiel to stare at his profile the entire drive there. Not even the music was helping to distract him. Every song could relate to Dean. That was probably because Castiel’s mind was just DEAN, DEAN, DEAN at the moment.
Shaking his head, Castiel sighed. “I was just having a nice moment with Amelia. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t be taking it out on you. I did offer my help.”
Dean sighed. “Good, all things considered. Sammy’s going on a date tonight, so I think he’s doing good, too.”
“Well, yeah, but…” Dean wasn’t sure how to finish that sentence. He had to admit that his relationship with Castiel wasn’t entirely of professor/student anymore. They were friends. But it still seemed out of the ordinary to introduce Castiel to Sam. It seemed like an extra step. To their new friendship.
And Ben might even have a stepdad in the near future if Castiel agreed to marry Dean whenever Dean gained the courage to pop the question.
“I’m sorry, Charlie,” Castiel said.
Dean swallowed. No one had ever made him feel like this. Like he truly
“You hungry, son?” Bobby asked. “We ordered food.”
, and
Castiel kissed the corner of Dean’s lips. “I did have to. Because you love this book, which means it’s important. I wanted you to have it.”
“Fuck,” Dean gasped for air, leaning back slightly. “I love your lips.”
“You wanna come with?” Dean asked, even though he knew the answer.
Castiel nodded, getting out of his seat. He returned with a knife, two small plates, two spoons, and two coffees. One of his minions was helping him carry all of that, and he set up the table.
Castiel nodded. “Mom, I need to tell you something.”
“I would never,” Dean said. “You’re going to get yourself drunk.”
Dean scoffed. “Why do I need to become a fucking angel to kill Michael? I’m human, and I already killed one of those bastards.”
Dean scrolled through Castiel’s music. True to his words, the majority of his music was classic rock. “I didn’t know you had good taste in music.”
Dean shrugged and smirked. “Changed my mind.”
“You sure?”
Dean’s mom shook her head. “You boys.”
“Well, Eric, my decision to explore Jake’s bisexuality was simple,” Dean said. “I knew that in this post-apocalyptic setting, Jake and Robert would have to go through a hell of a lot just to get by. With the disease that wiped out ninety percent of the population, it wasn’t going to be easy for them. But that doesn’t mean that people stop living. Desire is a thing that lives on, even when we don’t think we can. Jake is in his early twenties, and he’s had to take care of Robert most of his life, so the least I could do was give him this. His relationship with Will was the only happiness he had for a long time. I wanted them to explore the feelings they had for each other. Also,
Sam took the phone back. “Wait, you’re not bringing Jo with you, are you? She’s allergic to dogs, and Wilde takes it personally.”
“You’re bluffing.”
Castiel furrowed his brow. “What is that?”
By 9:00 pm, Ben was tucked in bed. Tonight, Lisa sat on the left side of Ben’s bed while Dean sat on the right. Together, they read a bedtime story for Ben, switching the reading every other page. Ben loved bedtime stories, but he loved them even more when both Lisa and Dean read them to him.
“Hi, Mom,” Dean said.
Dean smiled at her, and then at Sam, who was already smiling back.
“So you’re going to try a long-distance relationship?” Sam asked, frowning.
“Yeah, give me one second.” Dean grabbed a set of post-it notes and wrote down his phone number. Then he handed the note to Castiel. “Cas, here’s my number. Call or text me anytime you want.”
“I didn’t tell you?” Dean asked. “I thought I did.”
Dean was in the middle of cooking breakfast—scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns, the holy trinity—when Castiel strutted into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes. He was still clad in his boxers and Jurassic Park t-shirt and his hair was a wonderful mess. The sight was endearing, to say the least.
“Who’s he?” Ben asked, sipping his Capri-Sun.
Dean sighed. “Fine.”
And then, he started walking.
Castiel smiled. “I’m glad I could help.”
Dean filled two plates with scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. “Leave those donuts in the kitchen. Let’s have a real breakfast, buddy.”
“You mind if I sit?”
Castiel removed the pillow, leaning down close. His blue eyes had a no nonsense edge to them lately. “We’ve been through this a thousand times already, Dean. I’m not going anywhere. You, on the other hand, are going to get up, go to the bathroom, brush your damned teeth, maybe run a comb through your hair while you’re at it, and then you’re going to sit your ass down and eat my French toast. Got it?”
Castiel pressed Dean further against the counter, his thighs around Dean’s legs, trapping him where he wanted him as he kissed Dean again and again, licking the roof of Dean’s mouth until Dean was inappropriately excited. But for a second, Dean forgot about where they were and he moved his hands to Castiel’s ass, gripping it tight, making Castiel groan into Dean’s mouth.
Castiel
“Oh, good. I was wondering if you’d checked your grade online.”
Castiel knew that Claire would be asleep by then, so she probably wouldn’t miss them while they were gone. Besides, Charlie and Rosa had been really eager for them to make an appearance at their party. So, in the end, he relented.
Anna didn’t miss the way Raejean blinked at the shortened version of her name. She expected her to protest, but she didn’t.
“He’ll worry.”
“Hey, it’s not my fault that you let me distract you so easily. I’ll try not to go into your office from now on.”
Dean held her, touching her forehead and under her armpits, frowning. “Grab the thermometer.”
“I’m doing pretty good, actually,” Dean said, as Castiel held his hand again.
“Then you gotta put her to the test,” Dean said. “If she can put up with our family, then she’s golden. Look, Sammy, you’ve been alone for too long. I think this is good for you.”
As much as Dean hated to admit it, Lisa was right. Dean would have never dared to deviate from his path of being with Lisa for the rest of his life—no matter how miserable he was with her—for Ben’s sake. If Lisa hadn’t left, Dean would have stuck by her side and they would have both been completely joyless. “You could have broken up with me without taking Ben away from me. We could have figured something else out. Something that didn’t lead to all that pain for both of us.”
“Didn’t know I married such a gentleman,” Dean said over his shoulder.
“If you really choose to do this, then I will help you,” Castiel said.
Dean shrugged, looking back at the television. “No. It’s partly why I didn’t mind sticking it out with Lisa. When it finally hit me that she didn’t love me, I just figured I would never get to have that type of love in my life. But it’s alright. I
“Look at you, angel,” Meg said. She stood in front of them, arms crossed over her chest. “Well played, both of you. I can’t say I’m not disappointed. But if it wasn’t me, I’m glad it was you, Castiel. You make a stunning angel.”
“I can hear that camera,” Bobby said, joining them in the back area.
But John’s death didn’t hurt as much anymore. “Sam studied so hard in school,” Dean said, smiling proudly. “He got a full ride to Stanford. He lived out in California until he was done with school, and then he moved back to Oklahoma City. I never thought he’d come back once he left, but he did. And I’m so glad he did because I wouldn’t have been able to ask him to come back as much as I wanted him to. I’m glad he’s around, even though he’s busy almost always. It’s a comfort to know he’s just a short drive away.”
“Hey, Tessa, it’s nice to see you again,” Dean said. Dean would bring Ben to eat here on the many nights Lisa didn’t show up for dinner. This place had become a bit of an escape. Although, it had always felt second to Castiel’s house.
Dean was even more annoyed when he got to his desk and remembered he wasn’t allowed to talk to Castiel at all. What kind of rule was that? He groaned as he sat on his chair. Dean grabbed his headset and was about to start accepting phone calls when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
“I thought you were watching a movie,” Dean said.
“I decided that you are.”
“Okay, bye!” Ben handed over the leash to Castiel and set off running for the playground.
In the spur of the moment, Dean reached out to touch a single white feather. Immediately, Castiel retrieved his wings, and they were gone from sight.
A week later, Dean was on the way to the airport. He was singing along to his music. He didn’t stop even when people stared. Dean was having a good day, and nobody could ruin that. Today, he would get to see his baby brother after many months apart. His mom was on the way to his house, where Castiel was waiting for her. Dean finally got to have all his favorite people together. It was a very good day.
Dean laughed softly. “Hey, this record is very nice actually.”
Dean flicked his gaze back to Castiel’s, giving him a crooked smile. “Yeah, I kinda figured that.”
Dean started feeding Claire small watermelon pieces. That was her new favorite fruit, and it went well in the summer heat. July had always been especially hot in Oklahoma City. Castiel threw the ball to Dandy once again, watching her run after it with all the enthusiasm in the world.
“That sounds nothing like me,” Dean said.
Neither of them said a word as they ran the rest of the way, climbing into the truck. With shaky hands, Castiel started the engine and hit the gas.
For a second, Dean tried to hide his growing smile, but then he stopped trying, smiling from ear to ear. “I can’t believe I was so scared just a minute ago.”
“Good thinking.” Castiel reached for the bottle of lube in his nightstand drawer.
“This is a lot to process,” Dean said, uncovering his face.
“Ah, shit,” Dean said, chasing after the book, bumping into a hundred bodies on the way. Once he’d rescued it, he brought it to Castiel. “Sorry about that.”
“You smell good,” Dean blurted out. He was doing that a lot lately.
Castiel pulled Dean by the hand to the truck. They found a small business in Dallas called Emporium Pies that sold actual homemade pies. Dean ate his slice of peach pie while making sinful noises, which gave Castiel a show. He stabbed his fork into his pie, unable to tear his eyes from Dean.
“Let me live, Sammy.”
Well, Dean’s good mood was officially ruined. “I know, Sammy. I remember what happened last time. I’m well aware that Cas is straight and nothing can ever happen between us.”
Castiel seemed to realize this just now. He frowned. “Oh. That’s right. Well, I hope you have a good time with your family, Dean.”
Anna and Castiel looked at each other.
Dean smiled. “Bigger than getting married tonight?”
Dean snorted. “Yeah, right. Go get some rest. I’ll give Claire her antibiotic when it’s time. Don’t worry.”
“What? No. I’m paying for my half.”
As soon as Castiel got off the phone, he called Anna. It was rare for Anna to pick up the phone whenever Castiel called because of her odd shifts at the hospital, but Castiel must have some good luck because she answered on the second ring.
Castiel bounced on his feet. “Great. We’ll do it when we get back. Now finish your coffee. We have a long day ahead of us.”
“That’s right, Brother Randy here is a good Samaritan,” Jack said. “Doing God’s work.”
Castiel nodded once. “Very well. I’m glad we understand each other.”
“I think we need to talk,” Castiel said.
“I’m only telling you this so you can stop worrying about the people here tonight. It doesn’t matter. I don’t care about anyone here but you, and I know you’re mine, so I’m happy.”
Dean couldn’t help the grimace on his face. Suddenly he realized why he didn’t socialize with his coworkers so much. They were all a bunch of jackals.
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel muttered, locking eyes with Dean. There a smile in his eyes, although it hadn’t reached his lips yet. “I enjoyed our pranks.”
“I fucking love you, Cas. You make me feel brave.”
“Ahhh!” Castiel sat up before anymore abuse fell upon his face. “I’m up, and my attention is all yours, Claire. You win.”
Castiel gave him a look. How would that possibly help? “Don’t think about that. I think the city looks great at night. We don’t see stuff like this back home.”
They moved to the couch to talk, but as soon as they sat down, Dean pulled Castiel close and kissed him. Castiel crawled onto Dean’s lap, digging his hands into Dean’s hair, kissing him in earnest. Dean was panting when Castiel broke away to kiss down his jaw, and his own hands moved to Castiel’s ass.
Sam’s gaze dropped to Castiel’s neck. “Oh, God. Is that why you have an enormous hickey on your neck?”
. Dean didn’t have it in his heart to tease Castiel about his excitement for the movie because he looked so giddy to be sharing this with Dean for the first time.
Dean looked at Castiel, too, silently calling his name in hopes of getting him to wake up. “Cas, he’s really into love stories, isn’t he?”
The white leather couch was, like, fifteen feet wide. And the plasma TV was almost the size of a movie theater screen. There was a surround sound system, and Castiel played some classic rock from his cell phone.
“Fuck yeah, I was right.”
Dean laughed nervously. Did he think about Castiel? All the damned time. “Yeah.”
Dean’s phone rang halfway there, and he told Castiel to pick it up.
Castiel took a deep breath. “Dean told me that Lisa left with Ben. Apparently, she decided they needed to move with Benjamin to California. But she refused to give Dean any details. She doesn’t want Dean to contact them again.”
As they waited for the twenty-first contestant, Dean elbowed Castiel. “Dude, it’s just one kiss. We really don’t need to interview everyone. I’ll just pick the hottest one and get it over with.”
“It’s no problem.” Kevin shrugged. “Besides, you’re the boss. Gotta kiss up.”
Castiel pulled away to meet Dean’s gaze. “It was my pleasure.”
Dean narrowed his eyes, wondering why Castiel had even bothered. They sat on the couch, next to a sleeping Sophie. Castiel pulled out a gift from his coat and handed it to Dean. It was a bit heavy, wrapped in shiny red paper. “What’s this for?”
Castiel looked at Dean again. Something flashed in his eyes before he looked away. And then he lifted up the camera. “Do you mind if I take a picture of the two of you?”
“A man can dream,” Sam said, wistfully.
Not a minute later, Castiel sent a text.
“They want you to believe that Rachel would give up living in Paris to be with Ross, but not that Phoebe would date a girl? That’s bullshit.”
Castiel continued moving inside him, hissing from the bite.
“Yes, sir.”
“Okay, fine. Don’t marry me now. Marry me later. In a few years.”
“What?”
“Thanks.” Dean tried really hard not to blush.
Castiel smiled and shook his head. “Dean was just trying to get you to stop talking when he said that.”
Dean became a flustered mess around Castiel if he even gave him one of his usual intense glances and soft touches. That was a deadly combination. Worst of all, Dean was becoming addicted to the attention Castiel was giving him, which tended to feel charged with something electric. This meant that, lately, Dean would seek Castiel out throughout the day just to get another touch from him. Dean had already made his peace with how pathetic that was.
Is there a reason why you liked an instagram picture of me from four years ago?
“Good.” Dean approached Castiel from behind, circling his arms around his waist, shifting him where he wanted him. Castiel was allowing the movements. Dean knew that Castiel was strong enough that he could easily resist if he didn’t want to be moved around. To take it one step further, Dean inched his hands lower on Castiel’s thighs, angling them as well. Then, he spread Castiel’s legs by pulling on both of his thighs. Dean had never known that all it would take was a bowling and pool night to get this close to Castiel. If he had, he would have suggested they do this a long time ago.
“We gotta pick up groceries today,” Dean said, looking over his shoulder at Castiel. Dandy liked to walk faster than Castiel felt comfortable pushing Claire’s stroller.
“We can’t just plan to be spontaneous,” Sam argued, setting down his pizza so he could have his hands free for wild gesturing. That was how Sam talked best, with his hands. “The only way to do this is to not plan it at all.”
Castiel smirked. “Oh, I
“I know,” Anna said.
As soon as the episode ended, Castiel turned to Dean. He tugged on Dean’s sleeve, and Dean turned, angling his legs and everything towards Castiel.
“I know,” Charlie said.
“You’re awake!” Sam cheered, chewing on a Snickers.
“Yeah, let me get it for you,” Sam said, getting up.
“Have you seen Cas?”
on you. I already put a ring on it, so we’re way past that.”
Dean nodded. “What do you want to know?”
The door opened, and Ash came in covered in a big jacket. His nose was pink from the cold outside. Dean hadn’t noticed that he left in the first place. Ash looked over at Dean and grinned as he stepped closer to him.
Dean unclasped his hold on the counter, wrapping his hands around Castiel’s neck, kissing him again, harder and faster this time. “Cas,” Dean said against his lips. “You’ve had my heart for a long time now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can tell.”
“Are you ready to get started?” she asked.
The episode was as hilarious as Dean had hoped. They had a lot of great one-liner. At least the writing was up to par with the original seasons. The last thing Dean wanted was to disappoint their devoted fans.
“You can’t come with me,” Castiel said.
Oh, God. Dean would have a hard time sleeping next to a shirtless Castiel. “You do know we’re sharing the bed, don’t you?”
Castiel lifted his face. “I think it’s due to the teething, but we’ll be right there. No, it’s not a bother. Thank you for calling, Sam. ”
Dean kissed Castiel again, and then felt the world spin as Castiel grabbed him tightly and dipped him, deepening the kiss. Dean broke the kiss with his laughter while Castiel kissed down his neck before bringing them back up.
“Are you a fan of Castiel Novak’s?” She was holding a stack of four books, which Dean recognized as Castiel’s books. “I’m so excited for this new angel book. Castiel Novak has never disappointed me before. I’m going to start reading this as soon as I get home.” She held up her copy of
Castiel passed Dean’s house, but it was eerily still, and even the front porch light was off. It looked bleak, almost. Castiel shivered with a gust of wind. The gnawing feeling that something was terribly wrong didn’t escape him, even when he returned home thirty minutes later. He hoped he was overreacting, but just to quiet his mind, he sent Dean a text.
Castiel looked down at his hands. Before he could speak, Paula returned with their drinks, and then took their orders and left. Castiel sipped his lemonade. “I don’t know how to be myself around you.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Anna said, smiling. “I didn’t hear you come in this morning, but I figured it was you and not an intruder in the shower.”
“Yes. If that’s what you want.”
“Good morning, sunshine,” Charlie said in a sing-song voice. Way too loud for—Dean checked the time on his phone—ten in the morning. “Did I wake you up?”
“There you are,” Castiel said, coming up behind Dean, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist and setting his chin on his shoulder. “You wanna go for a swim later?”
, kicked off his shoes, and sprawled on Dean’s bed, looking right at home. After a bit of hesitation, Dean joined him, keeping a bit of space between them, in case he was reading things wrong. Castiel started reading the book out loud, his voice rough and solid above the music in the living room. Feeling bold, Dean lay his head on Castiel’s shoulder, and listened to his deep voice as he continued reading.
Castiel stared at him for a while, his mouth hanging open. “Why?”
“Yes,” Castiel answered, his voice gruffer, sleepier.
“No, thank you, Jess,” Castiel said. “Actually, I think I’ll go sit inside for a little while.”
Being back at work was better than Dean had imagined. Not many things in his life gave him as much satisfaction as working on cars. He waited until his stomach was growling in protest to stop on the Mitsubishi he was working on, and went to the breakroom.
“Not like this.”
They shared their milkshake, and it was fucking romantic.
“See you tomorrow!”
“I like to be hands-on too,” Dean said around a mouthful. “I cook most of the food, and all of the pies.”
Castiel laughed harder, then. “Yeah. Yeah, I think we did.”
Jo smiled again, clapping Castiel’s shoulder. “Hang in there, Cas. It’s only Thurday.”
Dean remained oblivious to the stares as he dug into his food, wrinkling his nose as he chewed. “Is this supposed to taste citrusy?”
Bobby threw her a look that said,
“Gabriel,” Castiel said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
As they unpacked their dishes, Dean sang along to Led Zeppelin’s greatest hits, which were playing from his phone on the kitchen island. They had an actual
“You spoil me,” Dean said slowly. “But never in the morning before work. Not unless it’s my birthday, which only comes once a year.”
“Don’t say that. Please don’t say that.”
Dean hated goodbyes. He’d been hoping they could skip theirs. But Castiel was stubborn, and he refused to leave without a proper one. So, he’d showed up, and they’d sat on Dean’s bed for a while, just talking about their hopes for the future. Castiel wanted to be a prosecutor. He had big dreams. Dean? He wanted to teach high school. English, because he loved Vonnegut. But Dean wasn’t going to move away from home. He was staying put. He’d realized that this was probably the last time he’d ever see Castiel. They’d promised they’d stay in touch, but Dean knew how these things worked. People lost touch eventually. And that was exactly what happened with them.
Dean scoffed. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“What is your favorite color?” Dean asked.
“Dean, it’s just a TV. We have TVs.”
“Yeah, he told me that part.” Dean rubbed his face, trying to keep himself awake. “Cas told me he was feeling guilty because of all the years he hasn’t spoken to his mom. I wish there was something I could do to help him.”
Holy shit.
“You think we got any chance of fixing our marriage now that the winged sons of bitches started the apocalypse?”
“So you’ve been everywhere,” Dean concluded. He’d only ever traveled a few states in his entire life. Castiel had been overseas. On a whim. Their lives were so different. But that was to be expected. Castiel was a college professor, and Dean was a mechanic.
“For you?”
“Let’s go,” Dean said, helping Charlie with her bags.
“Yeah,” Dean said, looking at Amelia through his fingers. “Are you sure he won’t kick me out of your house like I kicked him out of mine?”
Dean hadn’t thought about Lisa in so long. Her memory was too far away for it to hurt anymore. They’d been together for three years, which was his longest relationship. But Lisa had picked up and left one day, and Dean was so blindsided he could hardly believe it. He vaguely remembered swearing off of people of every gender because he refused to ever be hurt like that again. But he hadn’t thought about that in years. It was odd for Mary to bring her up now.
While he waited for Castiel to wake up, Dean decided to create a new image of the Mothman. Castiel had briefly mentioned a graphic novel, which had been part of Dean’s idea not so long ago, though it was long forgotten. Dean started a new drawing, this time with purpose. He had a vague story in mind, about a group of teenagers, searching out the Mothman from his hiding place. This moth—more bat than moth—hid in the coal mines of West Virginia.
Dean looked at the steady road in front of him, and he was comforted by its sight. Being on the road gave him a peace that not many other things did. “Chicago it is,” he said.
On Claire’s birthday, they started the day by going to the cemetery.
Dandy ran all the way to the front porch, not needing to be told twice. Dean bent down to put the harness on her and then held her leash. Castiel put Claire in her stroller, and they were ready to go.
Charlie was looking at him. “I’ll knock door to door.”
“Why not? We need one. Where do you think Claire will sleep?”
to. I have wanted to for a very long time.” Castiel pressed a kiss below Dean’s ear, and then whispered, “I want to make you feel good.”
Ben laughed again, far more excited than he had been at the prospect of swimming with Dandy. He’d probably forgotten all about Dandy already. She was just laying on the grass by the pool, watching them.
“Did Ben tell you how long this mass murder would last?” Dean asked, giving Castiel a sideways glance.
“Yes it—”
“What the hell?” Charlie asked.
“I thought I was being romantic! I didn’t know the place sucked.”
Castiel gave him a crooked smile. “Okay.” Then he puckered his lips.
Anna poked one of his broken wings with her shotgun. The angel twitched. Anna locked eyes with Raejean. Just like they’d planned, Raejean covered the angel with gasoline. Anna took out a matchbook from her jeans and lit one match. She tossed it at the angel, and was quickly drawn back by a mighty arm around her waist.
Cas beamed, his eyes softening. “Dean, you’re a real nerd. You came in here talking about Zeppelin and I thought you were just a pretentious hot dude, but there are so many layers to you. Wow. I’m honestly a little bit in awe of you.”
When he returned to the living room, Charlie and Rosa were sharing a laugh.
Castiel smiled again. “This one is incredible.”
“Can I get some candy?” Charlie asked, already reaching for a handful.
Dean smiled back.
Dean sipped his beer. “Hit me with your best shot, baby.”
When Castiel finally had to go, Dean walked him to the door. There was a brief moment when Dean had the sudden impulse to hug Castiel goodbye. It was odd because Dean wasn’t much of a hugger, unless it involved Sam—but he mostly did it to tease him. This felt different. This was a need that had grown inside of Dean, and it pulled him closer to Castiel. Before he could stop himself, Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and drew him in. Castiel let his arms rest at his sides for a few seconds, and then he wrapped them around Dean’s waist. It was intimate, and Dean relished in the closeness of it. When they pulled away, Castiel looked a shade pinker, but also a little bit dazed. Dean wondered if Castiel had felt the same thrill he’d felt.
Castiel hoped so, too.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered, pressing his back against the wall.
Dean started cleaning them both up, when he remembered their conversation from that morning. “Didn’t you say you were willing to be propositioned until this weekend?”
“No! I’m not. No. Um. My assistant needs my help today with something personal. I told him I’d help him.”
“Where are we going to eat today?” Dean asked.
“Oh. Right.”
are making this uncomfortable?” Sam asked.
“Did you sleep with Chuck last night?” Castiel couldn’t believe he’d missed something so obviously clear.
Dean couldn’t believe this was the end. Not when the show had given him so many amazing things.
ended. He couldn’t find anything good to watch, so he took his sketchbook out of his bag and continued where he left off. The Mothman was coming out exactly how Dean imagined it, which rarely happened. The Mothman wasn’t gruesome. He was a solid figure, glistening in the darkness. He had large wings that reached twice his height, but they weren’t like those of a moth, like his name specified. The Mothman’s wings resembled the wings of a bat, which he moved at a rapid pace. And his red eyes glowed beautifully.
“It wasn’t easy,” Dean said. He could still remember those gloomy days following Amelia’s death. It was like a dark cloud was permanently hovering over the entire house.
“Promise me one day you’ll get in my car,” Dean said, holding Castiel’s gaze.
Castiel smiled. “That sounds perfect. I’ll let Amelia know. She’ll be glad to have you guys over.”
“I tried to get him to go to the hospital before driving him home, but he says he really didn’t hit himself anywhere, and he doesn’t want an expensive hospital bill.”
Dean stopped kissing him immediately, pulling away to look Castiel in the eyes. “Did I do something wrong?”
One night, though, in the middle of playing Scrabble, Cas went into his room. When he came back, he was holding a record. Dean didn’t question it, looking at his letters to see what word he could create that would win him the game.
Castiel sighed. “I’ll try, but I can’t make any promises.”
“There’s more, isn’t there?” Anna asked.
At the sight of him, Castiel’s mother rose elegantly to her feet, and grinned. “Castiel, what a lovely surprise.”
Dean was taken aback. This guy was asking for his number already? Whatever happened to romance? Dean tried to laugh it off. “Just like that, huh?”
As soon as Dean spotted the tall statue, he posed for a picture next to it, crossing his arms as he waited for Anna to take a picture.
Clad in his boxer briefs, Dean felt a lot more exposed than he’d intended to be, but he wasn’t uncomfortable. Castiel had somehow managed to make Dean feel confident in his own skin whenever they got to this part. The betrayal from Lisa and all of those years of insecurity at her side had crushed Dean’s confidence. Better yet, it had buried it deep. But in the few weeks Dean and Castiel had been together, Castiel had dug it back up.
“You know that man the angel is always following?” Dean began.
And then, Bela burst into tears. It was the quickest Dean had seen anyone go from not crying to crying an ocean. This felt a lot more like a scene from a very bad soap opera than a real argument between his friends. Dean reached out a hand to hold Charlie’s on the table, but Castiel held him back, and then shook his head.
Castiel nodded. “It’s not certain until we have a solid contract, but my agent believes in this project as much as we do. It’s happening, Dean.”
Meg shrugged. “I’ll just wing it. It’s what I do best. And hey, try not to fuck up your plan to end all this. You’re my last hope.”
Dean widened his eyes, staring at Sam with a mixture of fear and excitement. His heart was racing and his stomach was fluttering and he was short of breath. How was it possible that absolutely nothing had changed in the ten years since he’d last since Castiel? “Cas is here.”
Their chances weren’t looking so great.
pajamas—because, yes, Dean owned
That was true, although that had been all due to Amelia.
Bobby was sitting with Ellen at one of the two tables, and they were drinking beer together, looking more comfortable than Dean had ever seen Bobby with anyone else. It struck Dean how happy he was seeing Bobby looking this way. Ellen was good for him, and Bobby knew it.
“I’ll see you later, then,” Castiel said.
“I won’t be long,” Castiel promised, heading to the restroom just a few steps away.
“Okay.” Dean took a deep breath and then nodded. “Okay, here I go.”
“Why don’t you have a Christmas tree up yet?” Castiel wondered. “Christmas is a little over a week away. I’m afraid your diner is more festive than your home.”
“No, actually one of my friends made the ice cream.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Her name’s Jo. She makes really good ice cream usually, but sometimes it’s just too bad to eat. She likes to experiment with her flavors.”
Thank you guys for reading and leaving such lovely comments all the way through!
“Bring it on.”
Castiel shot him a look before he left. Dean felt a little guilty for laughing, but he was tipsy too.
“He’s doing great,” Lisa said. “We started doing yoga together. He hated it at first, but now he’s really into it. I had to get him into it early. You know how it is.”
Dean took a deep breath. “Yeah. Okay. We can do this. I’m the Serpent, and you’re Eve, and we’re going to steal the show.”
Sam was suddenly standing beside Castiel. He cleared his throat. “Actually, Dean, Castiel is right. You can’t set those off in Oklahoma City.”
“I’m still not taking your last name.”
Shit. They were bad friends. “Sorry, that was my fault,” Dean said. “You wanna join us for dinner?”
“Are we going to sleep, then?”
“We have a deal, then,” Lucifer said, extending his hand.
“What do you mean exactly?”
So Castiel got himself ready, this time only having to lube himself up with no further protection. He settled back on top of Dean, and entered him slowly, carefully, watching Dean’s face to make sure he wasn’t hurting him. Dean wrapped his legs around Castiel’s hips, urging him all the way in. Once Castiel was balls deep inside, Castiel kissed Dean’s temple.
Castiel picked up on the third ring. “What the hell do you want?”
“How do you take your coffee, Dean?” Castiel asked the question as though he’d asked the question a hundred times before. As though they did this sort of thing all the time.
Castiel nodded. “It’s good to have you and Ben back here.”
“Okay.” Dean cleared his throat, eyes focused on peeling the label off the beer bottle. There was a soft, maybe shy smile on his lips. Dean was hardly ever shy. The dread in Castiel’s stomach grew. “I think the angel in your story might be kinda, sorta, probably...gay.”
“Dean, it doesn’t sound like you’re gay,” Castiel said, patiently. “It sounds like you’re bi.”
“You were human once? You weren’t always a demon?” The thought had never occurred to her. But it made a lot of sense.
“It’s Daphne.”
Sam looked at the Cokes in his hands, and then he switched one for a Sprite. “Alright. But if Aunt Ellen throws this Sprite at me, I’ll throw another one at you.”
When Dean got to Olive Garden, Gabriel and Castiel were already seated at a table. Dean kissed Castiel on the lips and bent to shake Gabriel’s hand, feeling more than slightly awkward to see him again.
“Okay,” Ben said, going up to Naomi to grab the balloon that she was holding. “Hi. Can I have the balloon?”
“Cas, baby, I—I’m sorry.” Dean knelt on the floor at Castiel’s side, holding Castiel’s trembling hands in his. “Talk to me. I’m here. I’m listening. You can trust me. I’m your husband. I’m your friend.”
Castiel sighed and pretended he didn’t notice.
Michael and Emmanuel kissed on screen for the last time. It was a short, bittersweet kiss, but it felt real coming from Castiel. Then Rae moved closer and wrapped her arms around them both. Their house was empty. They were moving out. All three of them. Because their journey as roommates was over. That didn’t mean their friendship was ending, though. But it was moving onto a different era.
Castiel shut the bedroom door behind him with a heavy thud.
Not ten minutes later, Castiel drove straight to Sam’s neighborhood. It was a small street with a cul-de-sac at the end. The houses were all boring two-story copies of each other, hardly varying in style or color. It was a cookie cutter neighborhood, but it was exactly what Sam had wanted to achieve. And Dean had no right to judge him, especially when Dean’s idea of a perfect life was living in white picket fence house with Castiel and their children. Growing up, neither of them had had much of a normal life, so this was their way of making up for it.
When Dean pulled Castiel back up, he kissed him. Right there, in front of their friends. Dean kissed him and the song kept playing. Castiel could hardly hear it with the pounding of his heart being so loud. But he heard Dean’s voice in his ear when he pulled away, “Will you go out with me?”
They walked back to the TNT factory, and sat down against the outside wall. Castiel had left a short distance between them. Dean pulled out his sketchbook from his backpack, and Castiel pulled out a notebook from his.
“Yes, Dean. Come in.” Castiel held the door open for Dean. Once Dean came in the door closed behind him.
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said, softly. Because it was the truth. Dean loved Castiel with all his heart and nothing would ever change that.
“All of it. The road trip, the book, the marriage.”
Dean dug the keys out of his pocket and then handed them to Castiel, his eyes wary. “Want me to go with you?”
As soon as they walked inside, Dean jumped into action. Dean filled out all of the paperwork with Claire’s information while Castiel sat with Claire in his arms. Castiel was holding her close to him, but still giving her enough space since she must be feeling hot. He was so worried because Claire had never been sick before. Not ever. What if Dean was right and Claire did have an infection? What if Claire never recovered? Castiel had already lost Amelia, he couldn’t lose Claire, too. But no, he was getting ahead of himself. Jody had taught him how to fight these intrusive thoughts. Jody had told him he had anxiety and he had to work on it every day. Meditation had helped in the past.
“Great!” Dean said. “Let’s do that.”
“I believe you,” Castiel said.
When Castiel looked around, a few people were staring, but mostly everyone else had gone back to their own conversations. Charlie and the girl she’d kissed were nowhere in sight. Finally, Castiel looked back at Dean, and he was glad he didn’t miss the crooked smile on his face.
was tattooed in a typewriter font on his lower back, right above his ass crack. Dean ran his fingertips over it, understanding why Castiel hadn’t wanted Dean to see it when they were just friends. It felt too intimate. Dean felt lucky that Castiel trusted him with this, however small it may seem.
Castiel didn’t say anything else, but he gripped Dean tighter.
“Guys!” Dean said. “Can I have one second of your time? We already saw one video.”
The moment the angel raised his sword, angling it to Castiel’s exposed neck, Dean pressed his eyes shut. It was a cowardly move, but maybe humans were as cowardly as angels.
Castiel was quiet for a moment. “No?”
Castiel dug in his backpack. “I have hand sanitizer, Ben. Hang on.”
Castiel scoffed. “Oh, please, look who’s talking. You leave the dirty dishes for days without bothering to clean them.”
From her window, she watched the attacks. The people who were lifted off to the air and then tossed to the ground like dodge balls. The houses that were torn down. The cars that exploded. She saw it all.
Dean swallowed down the pizza, burped, and sighed. “Nah, I think I’ll be doing alright from now on. Crisis averted. But I’m glad you’re here. And I’m really glad you bought me food.”
Castiel threw an arm around Dean’s shoulders, drawing him in to kiss his temple. “I’m glad you’re finally here.”
Castiel didn’t reply, which wasn’t unusual, so Dean left it at that.
Charlie grinned, writing down on her clipboard. “Apple it is.”
“Alright, catch you guys later,” Sam said.
Dean put the Bible back on the nightstand and asked another question. “Did you just knock that down?” Silence. “Why did you do it?”
Castiel smiled. “Well, I think it’s your turn now.”
“You’re happy now? Just because you talked?”
But it wasn’t Sam. It was Castiel.
“I don’t know about that,” Castiel said.
“Something answered me,” Castiel whispered, like he couldn’t believe it.
The cameras were no longer on him, but Gabriel’s gaze was scrutinizing. The archangel was even more obviously perfect now that Castiel was an angel. There was nothing human about Gabriel, not even his eyes, which held more colors than he thought existed.
“Uh, yeah, he’s in here. What’s up?”
“Why are you shaking Cas’s hand if Cas slept over?” Charlie clarified.
Castiel smiled. “It is, isn’t it?”
They spent the time in the waiting room sharing stories of the set of
“I just wanted to say, I hope you like my burgers.”
, Castiel thought.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “No, you can’t say that because I’ll really do it, and then your book will never get done, and you’ll blame me.”
They sat at a circular table. Dean sat with Lisa to his right, then Ben, then Amelia, and then Castiel, sitting to his left. They all fit really well, even though it was a small table. It felt cozy and homey. Like having Friday night dinners with the Novaks was a common occurrence. Their families were clicking on every level. Lisa and Amelia were hooked talking about an art exhibit from some local artist that apparently they both wanted to see. And then about yoga, and then about celebrity gossip. Dean stopped listening after a while because it was just too much effort to keep up.
Dean sighed, knowing full well he was bound to spill the truth sooner or later anyway. “Do you know how hard it is to always try to be the best, but then to realize no matter how hard I try, my best will never be enough?”
“I can’t help you bring them over in my truck, though. I’m meeting up with someone for lunch.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean. “I’m in love with my wife. Sue me.”
“Maybe we do have to,” Castiel said, narrowing his eyes at Benjamin. “I’m sure you were just as involved in the decision to take Ben away from Dean, Benjamin. I blame you just as much as I blame Lisa. Unfortunately, all of us will need to maintain some level of contact because of Ben, so I plan on being civil.” Castiel clenched his jaw. “But I want to make it clear to both of you that Dean isn’t alone anymore. He has me. And I won’t let anyone hurt him again.”
Dean glared at Sam. “Why do you always ask Cas out for me?”
wanna seduce you. But not right now. And not right here.” Dean looked around the crowded office, and nothing screamed of romance. When he looked back at Cas, he looked more confused than before. “I think I owe you three dates before I get to seduce you. Like, real dates. I liked what you described before. Maybe we can make those dates happen for us.”
The knocking continued.
Castiel made his exit, waiting until he was comfortably seated on the couch to say another word. “You have no idea how much I miss you.”
“What?” Dean was glad that she’d broken the heavy silence again.
later, Dean’s head was completely resting on Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel’s arm was wrapped around Dean. It was the most comfortable Dean had felt in years. Every time he was close to Castiel, Dean felt that way. Dean never wanted to move away from this moment. The world could burn to pieces outside, but in here, they would always be safe.
“I hope so, Bobby,” Dean said, licking his lips. He savored the beer before he took a big gulp from it. “We’re trying counseling.”
Before they knew it, Castiel was straddling Dean’s lap—his computer pushed to the coffee table to make room—and things were getting heated. The moment he felt the familiar hardness in Castiel’s pants brushing against his thigh, Dean broke the kiss.
Dean got ready in a flash. Upon finding a mirror, he saw two hickeys on his neck. They were mostly covered by the neck of his button-up shirt, so he figured he wouldn’t have to worry about them at work. Not that he interacted with many people who weren’t Castiel at work.
“Dean,” Castiel called from the middle of the street.
Dean let out a breath. “No, it’s not bad at all.”
Dean tried to hold back his laughter. He’d missed seeing this side of Castiel. The one that was always ready to fight. Castiel could be one intimidating son of a bitch.
family,” Anna said. “I don’t care if you don’t like it. I already told you to stop acting like an asshole, but I can see that you won’t. So please, Dad, just go.”
“Good night.”
Castiel followed behind Dean and Dandy, rolling Claire’s stroller up the driveway.
Dean felt suddenly guilty for having ignored Castiel’s last email. Maybe he had been serious about Dean visiting him. Maybe Dean should have taken that road trip after all. “Well, you’re here now. Tell me, what’s new with you? What have you been up to all these years?”
Dean rolled his eyes. That was a terrible apology.
“Why do you always listen to that boring crap?”
“This is very mature of you, Dean.”
“I wasn’t joking.”
“It’s all up to the audience, but chances are looking good for him.”
Castiel’s hands were on his shoulders. “We’re in this together, remember? It’s you and me against the world.”
Dean was out of his seat, heading to the backyard. He needed some fresh air. He stood there, the sun beating down on him. It was hot. It was uncomfortably hot. But Dean wasn’t going to go back inside. His day had been going so well, nothing was supposed to ruin it. Dean should have known. He shouldn’t have let his guard down. Of course Castiel would leave. Of course he would. He had no reason for staying. Dean had been so stupid.
Castiel knew that he was getting closer to figuring out what to do with Amelia’s belongings. Some of her clothes he’d planned on conserving for Claire. The rest would probably be donated to charity. Castiel had been planning on asking Dean for help going through all of her stuff. He didn’t think he could do it alone and he didn’t want to.
“Festive.”
“In Oklahoma City,” Dean answered. “She lives next door to us. Well, to me.”
“Okay.” Castiel rubbed his hands up and down Dean’s sides before finally moving away, going to sit at the kitchen island.
“You’re unbelievable,” Castiel said.
Dean should have known the question was coming. But he’d discussed Ben enough in therapy that talking about him now was at least manageable. Not easy, but not impossible either. “Ben is with his mom. On a trip.”
Bobby arrived before anyone else, but not alone. Ellen was with him. Now this was an interesting turn of events. What could have possibly made Bobby invite Ellen to a family holiday if they were, as he called it “just friends?” Dean knew that was total bullshit, of course.
“Dean,” Castiel said, like a prayer.
“Cas?”
“Thanks again, Dean,” Amelia said. “You’re going to be the best uncle.”
“I love talking to you, too, Anna.”
Castiel woke up slowly to the song of birds and the soft music of a video game. When he opened his eyes, he saw Ben, wide awake, playing on Dean’s phone. Castiel yawned and rubbed his eyes. “Good morning, Ben.”
“Yes. Let’s get some ice cream.”
Dean laughed and raised his hand. “High-five!”
“That’s right,” Cas said. “We’re just going to make out.”
It was 6:00 am on a Wednesday but Dean still found himself calling Castiel on the phone.
“Anna!” she said, leaning in for a hug. A big hug, not the average one-arm-awkward physical exchange. “Oh, it is so good to see you.”
“I think they killed my brother.”
“Okay. I’ll be right back.”
Dean couldn’t believe what Sam was implying. Was it so wrong to spend some time with a good friend like Castiel? Dean didn’t have that many friends. He didn’t see anything wrong with it. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“So, what are you doing the rest of the day?” Dean asked, leaning on the doorway.
“I’ll walk you out,” Castiel said.
“If someone throws a fuss then I’ll pay for it,” Ellen said, shrugging.
“Ah, I’m afraid that is where you and I will disagree,” Professor Novak said, shaking his head. “I’ve never quite enjoyed Kerouac’s prose.”
“Who, me?” Dean said, gasping. He chewed off a smile, wiggling his eyebrows.
Castiel worried his bottom lip. He let out a long, shaky breath before a smile won over his face. “I have no idea what I’m going to do about any of this. All I know is that it would be so nice if Dean felt the same way about me.” Castiel leaned his head back against the couch, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I’ll never be able to get this off my mind.”
But when Castiel walked down the hallway to the living room, he heard noise coming from the kitchen. If he lived anywhere else, Castiel would have already pulled out his phone and dialed 911 as he hid from the intruder. However, Castiel lived right next door to one Dean Winchester, who let himself into Castiel’s house like he owned it. Not that Castiel minded. If he did, he would have told Dean to stop doing it after the first occurrence.
“Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. No. This can’t happen. Cas won’t become an angel. We’re not doing this anymore. Cas and I are out of the competition.”
Amelia gaped at him. “Are you sure?”
They didn’t say anything until they got to the parking lot.
Garth covered his mouth with his hands, looking from Dean to Castiel and back again. “That’s so sweet. Dean, you never told me you had a boyfriend. How long have you been together?”
“Hey,” Dean said, trying to keep his eyes open. “Was that the food you ordered?”
Dean hesitated before he spoke again. “I dated Lisa all through high school, but we broke up our senior year. No—that’s not true.
It was the Fourth of July.
Castiel and Ben were still talking near the store’s entrance when Dean found them. Judging by the look on Castiel’s face, Dean could guess that nothing he’d heard was good news. Before Dean could ask for any details, there was an explosion in the parking lot.
Dean had dressed up for the occasion. He was wearing dark jeans, a fitted green shirt, and his favorite leather jacket. The length of his hair was shorter, and he’d plastered an entire bottle of gel on it that made it look stiff and sticky.
Crowley sighed. “Get back to work.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised to find Dean in his kitchen the following Friday, eating cheesecake with Amelia. It
For Ben’s birthday—only because he loved him with all his heart—Castiel agreed to go camping. However, this time Dean rented a cabin for them to stay at, with a full bathroom and two full size beds. They’d made it a family trip, bringing Dandy and Doug with them. Dean even brought his guitar, even though he could only play maybe three songs. But Dean’s voice was like butter and Castiel felt giddy every time he heard him sing.
“This is why many couples choose to attend therapy sessions together frequently, even when they’re not having problems,” Jody said. “It helps to keep those lines of communication open to prevent any issues from growing out of proportion. I think both of you have done an excellent job at talking through all your fears and doubts. It’s important that you continue this path to maintain a good balance between you.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
The drawings were really good. One of them was of Dandy and Doug, the other was of Castiel and Claire, the other was of Castiel, Amelia, and Claire, and the last one was of Scooby-Doo. He’d colored them in neatly, and had even signed all of them with his name. Ben had talent. Castiel recognized it after all the years he’d been with Amelia, who had taken him to countless art exhibits and shown him the works of hundreds of artists. Castiel had never really cared about art until he’d met Amelia. Now he always cherished art, no matter what shape or form it came in. This art was so beautiful and thoughtful. Castiel couldn’t believe that Ben had gone through all that trouble for him and Claire.
Sleep didn’t come easy for Castiel that night. It was impossible not to worry about the situation. He couldn’t stop thinking about Lisa lying to Dean about something so significant. Castiel hated the thought of Dean getting hurt, by Lisa or by anyone else. Dean, who was so kind-hearted and genuine and
“Yes, and if I ever meet someone decent.”
“I’ll do my best to act surprised, and then everyone will know you pulled it off.”
“So are you.”
Dean ran his hands through his hair, wanting to die.
“Perfect. I love Target.”
Castiel let himself be held instead of being the one doing the holding, curling up as close as he could get to Dean, letting his warmth soothe him. He closed his eyes, reveling in the sensation of Dean’s lips against his head and the familiar Dean scent filling his nostrils. He always smelled like his body wash, some generic brand for men, but the only way Castiel could describe it was: Dean. Castiel could recognize that smell anywhere. Maybe that didn’t make much sense, but Castiel was half asleep by now. His mind was cleared from everything that was wrong and filled with everything that wasn’t.
“Three,” Dean said immediately.
“Don’t be sorry,” Dean said. “I just think it’s good to take things slow. We’ve been friends for so long. And as much as I might want this, I don’t want to rush our relationship. What we have, it’s important to me.”
“I should have told you what was wrong,” Castiel said. “I shouldn’t have pushed you away. We both made mistakes. But if it’s okay with you, I’d like to leave it all in the past. I don’t want to fuck this up again.”
Dean got a little lost on Castiel’s smile, especially after his new realization. If Dean was able to, he would pull Castiel inside, away from everyone else, and then he would kiss his neck and his jaw and his throat until he had his fill of him.
Dean grinned, playing footsie with Castiel.
“Hi, Mom,” Anna said.
Dean squished Ben into his chest. He kissed his face until Ben squirmed, trying to get away from him. Dean laughed, putting him back down, and Ben ran right back to play with Dandy again.
Castiel exchanged a look with Amelia, and he was glad to see that she was just as annoyed with Lisa as he was. Dean looked like a kicked puppy yet again.
“I’ll take care of you,” Castiel said in earnest.
“Well, I’m glad to hear that.” Dean shifted awkwardly. “So, you staying for breakfast? I’m making French toast, bacon, eggs, hash-browns, all the good stuff.”
Dean’s heart was pounding. Castiel did want to see him alone.
“I’m really happy for you, Cassie.”
Dean scoffed. “None of your damned business, dude.”
“I got them done at Betty’s. No, stupid, there wasn’t anyone else there. Why are you even asking about her? Look, there’s no point in bringing this up again. Castiel, please.”
“Damn it.”
Dean had been dreading their dinner plans. He wasn’t sure what Castiel would do or say when he saw Dean again, but it couldn’t be good. “Actually, I lied about my lunch plans.”
“It’s a stupid rule,” Dean said, because honestly, it was.
“You do the same.”
“Believe me, I’d shoot them if I could.”
Castiel nodded, waving Dean closer to him. Dean had to get very close to Castiel, so much that their arms and shoulders touched. It was odd being in Castiel’s personal space all of a sudden. But Castiel didn’t make it awkward, and the walk to his car was short.
Castiel reached across the table to place his hand on top of Dean’s. His touch was all at once comforting and alarming. Dean didn’t know how to react, so he sat very still. “I’m sorry about your father, Dean.”
“It just is.” He sighed.
“For a second, I forgot that Anna was staying with us,” Castiel said. “It was a good second.”
“Winchester,” Dean said.
“He’s a weirdo, isn’t he?” Anna said, smiling as she turned to her brother. She loved teasing him, that much was obvious, but it was also clear how much she cared about him.
“Me too.”
“We clearly don’t know what we’re doing, so we shouldn’t do it,” Sam said. “Come on, guys. Ghosts aren’t real. We’re just goofing off. Don’t take this so seriously.”
“I second that,” Sam said, raising his mug before taking a sip.
delicious. Thank you, Dean.”
“What are you doing back here?” Dean asked. “Where’s Ben? Is he okay? Did something happen?”
“Okay, Dumbo.”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said, holding Amelia’s hand. “I’m so sorry.”
“There’s a bathroom down the hall,” Castiel said.
It all made sense now. The stares. The tension. The awkward silences. The people in the restaurant knew Dean was wanted by the angels. They were waiting on their chance to strike.
“Cas.”
Castiel set Claire on the floor on her feet and she walked steadily to Dean, who picked her up and kissed her cheeks. “How was your day with Sam?”
Castiel reached for Dean’s hand and laced their fingers. “Come on.”
“I’m sure it wasn’t that good anyway.” Dean kissed Castiel’s forehead. “I think this is the best first date I’ve ever had.”
“No,” Castiel said quickly. “No, of course not. We didn’t talk about the kiss. Dean walked me back to my room and then he went to his room. He got a little mushy, but I think he was drunk.”
“I’m so sorry, Castiel,” Esther said, and Castiel hadn’t expected that, which was odd because everyone kept saying sorry to him lately.
Dean laughed, turning around in his arms. Castiel’s hair was completely ruffled and his blue tie was crooked. Dean fixed the tie for him, feeling giddy because he could do this now. “I couldn’t sleep more than four hours without you. It’s a problem.”
“What is it?” Dean asked.
the date I had after I came to your store.”
“Crap. I have to get back to the diner.”
“Oh, come on. You’re gonna love it. Now move out of the way while I pitch the tent.”
The rest of the drive went by faster since they had finally gotten through the traffic jam. They didn’t talk much anymore. Castiel turned up the music and they just sat and listened to it, looking at the scenery out the windows.
“Do you mind?”
Dean locked eyes with Castiel and said, “The fact that you’re worried about being a good dad says that you’ll be a great one. Bad dads don’t give a damn. At all.”
Just as he sent the message, Dean wondered if it sounded odd. Was it odd to say something like that to your friends? Dean didn’t usually worry what he said to his friends. But things were different with Castiel. He was a new friend, but not a new person. Dean had to get used to this change. He saved Castiel’s name in his phone as ‘Cas,’ and went back to his pasta.
“Yeah, I’m sure it is. But Sammy likes it. He’s real smart.”
Castiel looked down at his hands on the table. “I read
“Sure you can.”
“Yeah.” Dean brushed his fingers over Castiel’s lips. “But Sam and Jess got us reservations at the Reunion Tower, which apparently is kind of a big deal in Dallas. And it’s right across the highway.”
Castiel looked out the windshield. “I’ve never had intercourse in the backseat of a car. I’m attempting to visualize it, but it still doesn’t sound remotely comfortable.”
Dean looked back at his newly planted garden. It wasn’t big or impressive, but he was willing to put in the work to make it grow healthy and strong.
“We’re not trying to impress anyone,” Dean said. “I’m making cherry pie.”
“Yes. Just us.”
Castiel didn’t answer any of Dean’s questions. Instead, he put on his headset and answered a phone call. A few seconds later, Dean did the same.
Dean sighed again. “Yes, I need some help. Unless you don’t work here.”
“What, I’m just walking.”
Castiel smiled before he turned back to Jess. “I’d love a hot chocolate, thank you, Jess.”
“Are you still half asleep?” Castiel asked, smiling. “Why are you looking at the cake like it’s about to bite your face off?”
Castiel was panting hard, hands gripping the cushion of the couch. After driving him closer and closer to the edge, Dean pulled out his tongue, replacing it with his lube slicked index finger. Castiel opened up to him a lot easier this time around, groaning as the finger dug in deeper.
“I hope so.”
Castiel smiled this time as he covered Dean’s lips with his own. Castiel kissed Dean slowly, like they had all the time in the world, like he was savoring it. Dean breathed into the kiss, opening his mouth up to Castiel’s, letting his tongue move inside, tasting him, again and again. Castiel held Dean’s face in his hands, pulling him even closer.
A slow grin spread on Dean’s lips. “Let’s do this. Let’s get married. I’m down. You don’t have to ask me twice.”
“That’s actually why I’m calling.” Dean turned the camera from him to Ben. “Look, Ben, there’s your Uncle Cas. Do you see him? Can you see him?”
Before she got up to leave, Missouri stopped her.
“No, it’s alright, Sam,” Dean said, standing up. “Let’s go wait outside.”
Lisa looked away, shaking her head. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“That’s the guy you hated so much yesterday?” Kevin asked.
“Charlie?” Castiel asked.
“Hey, man, you want some pie?” Dean asked.
“I didn’t say that.”
Even better. “You have a tramp stamp? Oh, my God. All this time, I’ve been living with a stranger. Is this why you refused to change in front of me when we went camping? What else have you been hiding from me?”
Sebastian jumped to the couch and curled up between the two of them.
“I just got some stuff to move around in the backyard so I can bring it out,” Ron said, looking like he was ready to choke Castiel if he tried arguing with him again. “I don’t let my guests wait out on my porch.”
“See? How is it fair for me to make it so easy for you? Surprise me. I’m sure that whatever you get me will be great.”
. Mulder and Scully would soon be investigating the mysterious death of a seventeen year old boy right before he kissed his best friend. “Okay. I think that covers everything.”
“Good morning, sunshine,” Dean said, smiling widely as he flipped a pancake.
Lisa frowned. “What’s wrong? Dean, look at me.” She turned his head and he was forced to meet her gaze. “Don’t tell me you’re upset about what happened earlier.”
“You’ll let me know,” Castiel finished her sentence.
“You were humming just now. If you can hum, you can sing.”
“Do you want some shots?” Castiel asked everyone. “They’re on me.”
“Jeez. Well, I’ll let her know what happened. I’m sure she’ll be glad to see you again.”
“Okay, don’t rub it in my face, you child prodigy.”
here.”
“What?”
Dean took the plates from Castiel and set them on the table. “Ooh, you made lasagna. It smells delicious.”
But Lisa looked too tired to have the same argument again, so she waved a hand and got up. “I’ll be right back.”
“Castiel,” Anna said, hand to her chest. “You scared me. Are you okay?”
“You want too many things, Novak.”
Castiel scanned the room once more, and he saw something he hadn’t seen before. Worried glances came from some of the people still eating at the tables. There was something odd in their looks, like pity. It was much different from the glances the crowd at the bar was giving them, which was a whole lot more threatening. Even Randy had gone quiet, but at least he wasn’t looking at them anymore.
“Okay,” Dean said, as if his heart wasn’t racing, as if he hadn’t just allowed for things to get more complicated.
“That’s awesome, thank you.”
Dean snorted. “Yeah, well, he usually wanted it like that.”
The day went on as usual. Dean got through over a hundred customer service calls, and he was beat. It was five minutes to 5:00 p.m., and Dean was just about to end his current call, when he noticed Charlie making her way to him. The back row of cubicles was poorly lit and rarely visited, especially because there were only two people there. But Charlie was one of the few people who was brave enough to make the journey.
Castiel hadn’t even thought about the need for a eulogy. Before this conversation, he hadn’t thought about how he would even start planning the funeral. Castiel could barely function anymore. If it wasn’t for Dean and everyone else, Amelia wouldn’t have a proper funeral. He tried not to let that sink in too hard.
Cas did this thing with his tongue that drove Dean wild. How could anyone be this good of a kisser? Dean was practically melting.
“Risky’s my middle name,” Ellen said.
“It looks beautiful, Ames.”
Jess pushed her plate closer to him. “Grab some fries, Ben. They’re your favorite.”
Dean rolled his eyes, adjusting the red wig. “You wanna join us? We’re watching
Keep your distance, Dean. Keep your distance. “Okay.”
“Take your time,” Chuck said.
The class clapped for him when he was done. Dean blew them all kisses.
“Follow him,” Amelia said.
“Hello, my two favorite people,” Dean said, smiling widely as he walked towards them. Dean traded the bouquet of roses and chocolates for Claire, taking her in his arms and showering her face with kisses. “Happy Valentine’s Day, baby girl.” Dean looked at Castiel, his eyes bright, before he leaned in to kiss Castiel’s cheek. “Hi.”
Dean couldn’t believe the results as he started packing up. He didn’t have much to pack up since he only had his unfinished apple pie to take home, but he put the top on it, grabbed his messenger bag, and grumbled as he walked towards his Impala. Halfway there, he heard his name called from behind. Dean immediately recognized the gruff tone from his co-winner.
But Dean didn’t speak another word the entire ride home, and he was still thinking about what being Castiel’s boyfriend would entail as they walked Charlie and Rosa to the door. While Castiel went to check on Claire, Dean went into the kitchen for some water. His throat was dry all of a sudden, and his heart was beating so hard he thought he would pass out any second.
Dean gave Castiel a curious look. “I saw Bobby go in the kitchen after you. Did he give you the talk?”
“It’s not that hard. Come on. You can do it.”
“Hmm. Claire. She’s a bit small, isn’t she?”
“Really?” Dean asked.
“Don’t apologize for being human. I’m sorry we kept getting interrupted.”
Dean had snuck Claire away to her nursery so she could try on her new dress, so Castiel was alone with Charlie and Rosa.
It was the perfect Halloween.
Dean realized that he was panting, and he did his best to quiet down, but it was difficult when he was still pinned against the wall by Castiel, who hadn’t moved away a single inch.
“Of course I trust you. But I told you, I’m the Burger King.”
“It’s going better than expected. I’m glad we stopped for pie.”
“Thanks,” Dean said.
“Do you have an event tonight?” Esther asked.
“Thanks again for the latte,” Dean said, since he was out of words.
Once they made it to California, Dean felt well enough to drive. It had taken a lot of convincing for Castiel to hand over the wheel, but eventually, he did. They only had a few hours left to get to Oakland, and Dean felt unusually upbeat. He’d missed the feeling of driving his Impala, and having Castiel on the passenger seat, smiling at him when he thought he wasn’t looking. There was a new energy between them, something intense and electric. Dean swelled with pride every time he looked over at Castiel, so he did it often.
“Dad! Dad!” Ben ran over to them, holding a small green frog in his hands. “Look what I found!”
Dean smiled. “You’ll call me?”
When Dean looked at him again, he looked a little lighter. “I was afraid of telling you that. I brought it up in therapy a lot, but I figured it was better to be completely honest about that.”
“Not even if I made you apple pie?”
“Me too.”
“Yes,” Castiel said.
“And how’s Lisa? I haven’t had a chance to talk to her lately.”
Dean grinned. “Yeah, I’m a big fan of his.” That much wasn’t a lie. “I think you’ll really like the angel book.”
“Really? You don’t care if I never have sex with you?”
was probably my favorite. It’s always about a small town man falling for a big city woman who puts her career first, but it never gets old.”
That was unlikely, but Dean would try to get him out of the room sooner or later. “Yeah, maybe.”
Most of the time, Dean took his fifteen-minute breaks at his desk. The break room was usually packed with employees also taking their breaks, and Dean didn’t want to socialize over a cup of coffee. Instead, he spent his time reading. He was currently in the middle of the
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. “Anna, would you please stop talking about this? Like Dean said, let’s move on.”
“And now you’re here.”
. But he wanted to visit Amelia. His old friend. And he’d needed Sam to drive him in order not to risk falling asleep at the wheel. He hadn’t slept much the past few nights because Ben had caught a stomach bug and Dean had stayed up with him. Some nights he stayed at his house, and others at Lisa’s. It was easier that way. But Dean hadn’t accounted for Ben to be sick during his nights with Dean. Not that Dean minded, but he felt too drained to keep his head up.
Anna swallowed down hard. “I’m sorry for visiting you and having it thrown at my face. You make it so difficult to talk to you, Castiel. This is why I don’t try.”
“Please, call me Mary, son. I do boring work. I go to hospitals all over the country to train them how to use the software my company sells. Truth be told, I only took the job for the sake of traveling. I love being on the road. But I’m getting old. I’ll have to settle down eventually.”
That much was true. Dean would probably never forget John Winchester, despite everything he’d put him and Sam through. He hated that he was relieved to hear Castiel’s reassurance that Ben wouldn’t forget him, though. That was terribly selfish.
“You don’t need self-control.”
Castiel nodded along to everything Dean said. “Yes, exactly. We’ve been boyfriends for a long time now. We’re just so happy together. Tonight we’re getting matching tattoos. I’m getting mine on my right ass cheek.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I don’t think those are good enough reasons to visit Canada.”
Cringing before it happened, Castiel moved to his side, drifting closer to Dean. The couch was as loud as ever. They were close enough now that he could feel Dean’s breath on his cheek, and Castiel aimed to be even closer. He moved his free hand to brush Dean’s cheek, and he traced the freckles from memory. Then he moved to Dean’s lips with the tips of his fingers, letting the quickening warm breath wash over them. A hand was on Castiel’s waist, with a gentle grip, pulling him closer.
Castiel laughed. “That does sound good, doesn’t it?”
“You’re tired,” Castiel said.
“Of course you are.” Dean shifted closer and his hand returned on Castiel’s back. It was enough to let Castiel know that he was there, physically present. “You’re allowed to feel pain. You’re allowed to be upset and cry your heart out.”
Castiel blinked at him, stunned. He could hear the whistling and cheering from their table, but it was nothing more than background noise at the moment. “Yes. Yes, I will.”
Castiel looked ahead. “My idea wasn’t to come out to the football field.”
Dean smiled. “I’ll be right here.”
“Dean, please don’t tell me you’re jealous. Daphne and I are friends. I’m sorry if this is weird for you. I know how difficult it can be to deal with exes. I wasn’t expecting both of our exes to make an appearance tonight.”
Dean wished Castiel was here, too, for a lot of reasons. “I know, kiddo.” After a beat, Dean said, “Why don’t we call him? We can do one of those video call things so you can see him and he can see you.”
Dean didn’t want to think about family anymore. He changed the subject quickly. “So, are either of you married?”
“How can I help you?” she asked.
“Easy,” Dean said. “You don’t have to take off the entire diaper to check. Sometimes, you’ll know just by getting close and sniffing it. Or you could lift up the side of the diaper and look inside. Since she’s wearing a onesie, that’ll take longer.”
“Hi, yeah, I was just wondering if you knew anything about Cas—Castiel.” Dean shifted on his feet. “I noticed he didn’t come in, and after what happened Friday, I was just wondering if maybe something happened to him.”
Castiel looked at Dean for a while, and then he took another bite of the pie. And a third one. Dean smiled as he watched Castiel’s cheeks fill up with the food. He had an endearing way of eating. Dean had never noticed before.
Castiel raised his eyebrows. “Hello, guys.”
Sam shrugged. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
“Alright,” Dean said. “I could see that.”
“But you have all the reasons to like him?” Jo asked.
“I know, Cas, but it’s not like you go on book tours all the time. You’re allowed to do things for yourself and your career. I’m really proud of you.”
It took a while, but Amelia eventually calmed down. She decided to skip the rest of her honey Hot Cheetos and eat a pint of mint chocolate chip ice cream instead. Once Castiel made sure she was alright back on the couch with Dandy, he got started on dinner. He made her favorite lasagna, and they ate together on their dining table. Castiel kept looking over at Amelia, knowing she was on the verge of another breakdown, but wanting to prevent it in any way possible.
“I can talk. I’m fine,” Dean said.
“The one and only hell. Come with me.” Victoria walked down the sidewalk towards the traffic light on the street. When she realized Castiel was still standing motionless, she called over her shoulder, “We’re getting Dean back, dumbass. What are you waiting for, a theme song?”
“Yeah, but I’m a Winchester, not a Novak.”
Castiel gave Dean a look. “I’ve never been much of a plant person, but you took the time to plant an entire garden, Dean. That means you care. And if you care about the plants, then they’ll live. We’ll make sure to look up the best care for them. We could start with just two plants at first. If it doesn’t work out, then we’ll try something else.”
“Why not?”
“It’s a beautiful morning,” Castiel said. “Stop complaining.”
“Actually, I was planning on making something different. Don’t worry. You’ll like it.”
“Oh yeah. I’m not changing my mind about that.”
But Dean couldn’t move. He knew he should get out of the car, talk to Castiel, go inside—it was late, after all. He just couldn’t do it. Couldn’t move forward.
The smell of coffee led Castiel to the counter where he was greeted by Charlie. She lived a few houses down from him with her wife, Rosa, who was an elementary school teacher. Castiel had always liked them both, but he hadn’t spoken to either of them in quite a while. He was glad he got to cross paths with Charlie again.
Castiel ate a big scoop of ice cream, hesitating. “Well...yes.”
“Closet, come on,” Dean said, sounding offended. “If you dig in my dresser, you’re gonna find stuff you’ll never be able to unsee.”
Castiel smiled. “Yeah, look at us.”
“Are you really taking him one of your pies?” Jo asked, crossing her arms.
Castiel nodded. “Yes, yes, yes.”
get some action at least?”
“So wear a coat.”
“He looks so small,” Anna said, squeezing Castiel’s hand.
Dean smirked because he didn’t think that would stick, but apparently it did. He hadn’t realized that Lisa had been staring closely at him until he got off the call.
Castiel tried not to choke on his coffee. “What? No. Of course not. Dean’s not on drugs, Sam. Trust me.”
easily made the top five more disturbing and eerie films. The best thing was that Norman Bates was so damn attractive, and it felt so wrong liking him because of how fucked up he was, but it was hard not to. Sam and Dean had seen that movie hundreds of times growing up, but apparently no one else in the room had seen it.
“I, uh, don’t know.” Castiel faced her again. The prospect of returning to work was not the worst idea. It would distract him at least. But was he willing to push himself to get out of bed—Chuck’s couch—every day to come to work? He really had no other choice. He was running out of his savings, living with Chuck, and uncertain about his future with Dean. “Actually, yes, I think I’d like that.”
“Maybe he just needs some time,” Amelia said. “He’s had a lot to deal with in a short amount of time. Tomorrow might be easier.”
Castiel pushed away the broken glass with his shoe, and then sat down beside Dean on the kitchen floor. He pulled Dean into his arms, letting him cry on his shoulder. Dean held onto him, not bothering to care about how wet Dean left Castiel’s shirt with his tears and slobber. Castiel wouldn’t judge Dean for breaking down in front of him. Instead, he comforted him by carding one of his hands through his hair, while the other rubbed circles on his back. And he whispered into Dean’s ear, “I’ve got you, Dean. It’s going to be alright. I promise you, it will be alright.”
“What did you give him, Jess?” Dean asked.
Dean waved the thought away. “So, what did he enter?”
. It was like they were kids again back in their childhood home, doing the same thing they’d done hundreds of times.
“Dean, are you afraid of me?”
guy that flirts with him, but he refuses to do anything about it.” Castiel looked away, hating the bitterness in his tone. It became unbearable to keep looking Jody in the eye, so instead he focused on the wall behind her. “In order to be completely honest, I should say that I absolutely hate the thought of Dean ever getting in another relationship. I’ve tried to rationalize this, but it’s pointless denying my own selfishness.”
Castiel leaned in for another kiss.
“He wasn’t lost, kiddo. He was with me all along. He kept me company all this time.” Dean motioned for Lisa to follow him next door.
“Dean Winchester, are you propositioning me?” Castiel asked.
“I’ve given you three years,” Castiel said, turning back to his notebook. Another thing about Castiel: he loved to draw. Dean had caught glimpses of his sketches, and they were pretty decent. Not that he’d ever tell him that.
I can’t stop smiling. You’re my husband now.
“Dean, you know that isn’t true. You still have a family. Sam, Jess, Bobby, Amelia, and me. And soon, you’ll also have Claire. You will
When Dean woke up and saw Castiel sleeping next to him, he thought it was a dream. Everything that happened the previous night came flooding in, and Dean smiled. He realized his leg was draped over Castiel’s legs, so he snaked an arm over Castiel’s stomach and nuzzled his neck. It was so easy and it felt so natural. Dean wondered why they hadn’t done this a long time ago. He hoped Castiel felt the same way. The truth was, he was too scared to ask.
Dean wished he could see himself the way Castiel did. But all he knew was that he was a mess, and he needed to stop being a mess to make everyone else’s lives easier. Well, he wanted his life to be easier, too. He’d be lying if he said he was doing this entirely for selfless reasons. Dean was tired of feeling so empty. He was sick of feeling dead inside.
“Are you trying to shame me for having human needs?”
Sam pulled away, looking at Dean like he couldn’t believe he was lying to him at this moment. But then Jess reached for Sam, and Dean didn’t have to feel guilty about it too long.
,” Castiel said, pulling out the old book. “I lent it to you a few weeks before we wrapped the fifth season of
“Listen to me, humans,” he said in a booming voice so loud it was like it lived inside Dean’s ears. He was addressing an audience Dean couldn’t see. “We have arrived to this mistreated, abused planet of yours to remove every infestation walking the land and contaminating the oceans. Sinners, beware, for we are here, and we won’t leave until every single one of you is nothing but ashes. There is no place to run.”
“No,” Dean said. “I don’t want to get out of my contract. I can do this.”
Dean sighed, getting back to work. A few minutes later, Castiel got up from his desk. He came back with two mugs full of coffee from the break room. After putting Dean’s mug on his desk, Castiel kissed Dean’s cheek and went back to work.
“You do?”
This time, it was Dean who leaned his head on Castiel’s shoulder, yawning as well. “Do you mind if I end up falling asleep here?”
“But you’ve won awards!” Anna chimed in.
The description Anna gave him of Castiel didn’t match the one Dean had come up with over the last few days. Dean had every impression that Castiel was a total romantic who believed strongly in love and would never do casual relationships. On the night they kissed, Castiel had urged Dean to stop because he wanted to take things slow. He didn’t want to rush whatever it was between them. And Dean had simply turned him down. Shut him out. Now he felt like an asshole.
Sam laughed. “I’m just saying.”
“You would have done the same for me.”
Jealousy. Castiel had never been much of a jealous person. He’d never had reason to be jealous in the past. But he had to admit that the selfishness he felt towards Dean could be translated into jealousy of whomever Dean decided to engage with romantically. Thinking back on everything that had happened lately, it was so obvious. Castiel wasn’t sure that he could bear seeing Dean kissing another person. It was unacceptable. But there was longing inside Castiel when he considered how he would feel if
“Yeah,” Claire said, followed by a lot of other things that didn’t make sense.
“Just two weeks.” Dean tried to pull away, but Castiel had a strong hold on his hips. “You gotta let me go, Cas. Your flight leaves soon.” Castiel was heading to Chicago in just a few hours. Then San Diego, Cincinnati, Orlando, and finally, New York. Castiel had said that this was his most ambitious book tour yet.
“Thanks for watching the show with me again,” Dean said. “You didn’t have to.”
“Awesome. I’ll hold you to it.”
Dean hesitated. “Are you sure?”
“Am I?” Castiel furrowed his eyebrows in that endearing way of his.
Castiel was quiet for a moment. “Are you serious?”
“Hey,” Dean said, meeting Castiel’s gaze again. “Take your clothes off.”
Castiel all weekend. It had been a long weekend.
“Well, lucky for you, you’ve met a Novak. And in my life, we talk things out when something is bothering us. You should talk to Lisa.”
“I’ll take it to go.”
“This is the first research paper you’ve written since high school a million years ago?” Sam asked.
“Apparently.” Lisa raised an eyebrow. “What else has he told you about me? That I’m some kind of monster?”
Lucky me.
“It was after you were moved to my area. Lisa and I sort of hit it off, but what we had was nothing serious. Just a few nights. She told me she slept with you before, and I told her she’d been very lucky. Lisa just laughed and said that I shouldn’t get my hopes up with you because, well, she didn’t think you’d ever want anything serious. I didn’t bother telling her that you hated my guts, anyway.”
Castiel threw his head back in laughter. “You’re such an idiot.”
Dean gave Castiel a soft smile. “Thanks for agreeing to come. There’s no one else I’d rather have here with me than you and Ben.”
“Oh, yeah, no, absolutely. Come on in, Cas.” Chuck stepped aside.
“Well, I’m craving pie right now.”
They continued talking, jumping from subject to subject. Dean learned that Castiel had two brothers, but he only ever talked about Gabriel. His other brother was named Lucas, but that’s all he said about him. Castiel was a big fan of horror novels, but he preferred reading from independent publishers because he said there were hidden gems there. Dean wanted to ask about his tattoo, but he decided against it, especially because talking about it would lead to more staring.
“We’re on a road trip,” Anna said.
“Dean.”
“I was,” Sam said, “but then I realized I couldn’t hide forever.”
“I think this thing is picking up something,” Jo said.
“Close,” Dean said, batting Castiel’s sneaky hands away. “I work at an insurance company. It’s painfully boring.”
When Monday rolled up, Dean hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Castiel. He’d texted him all of Sunday, but he didn’t see him again until lunchtime at school. Except, all of their friends were there so Dean couldn’t really
minutes of shutting down all of Dean’s suggestions. Dean put the box in Castiel’s cart and walked beside him to the milk section. “Oh no, please tell me you know which type of milk you like.”
You’re my husband. I have a husband, and that is you. You and I are husbands. Married. Actually married. Legally married. For life. We have matching rings to prove it.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “I helped you write? Wow. That’s kind of a nice compliment.”
Dean glanced at Castiel over his shoulder. He didn’t even know he’d been paying attention.  “Yeah, that’s it.”
“Oh, yeah. Big time.”
“You’re beautiful,” Dean whispered against his lips. “So beautiful.”
“That’s why I got it for you,” Castiel said. “Both of you look great in it.”
Dean stared at the key for a long time before he finally picked it up and put it in his own pocket. Then Dean met Castiel’s gaze. “If you ever get tired of me, you have to let me know so I can go back to my own place and stop bothering you, alright?”
Castiel shook his head. How little Lisa knew Dean. “He’s told me that he wants to grow old with you. Those rocking chairs we brought the other day were so important to him because he’d always envisioned the two of you on them, gray-haired. Lisa, believe me when I tell you that Dean is crazy about you. Don’t hurt him if you don’t have to.”
“Let’s get together after work for drinks.”
“I thought we were going to talk,” Dean said.
Dean ran a hand through his hair. “No. I was just—never mind.”
Jess pressed a kiss to Sam’s forehead.
“Meg Masters, I know you’ve had a long journey,” Gabriel said, turning his curious gaze on her. “You’ve lost your little sister, the only family you loved. You’re angry and you want revenge from the angel that murdered your sister. You want to feel strong again.”
“I didn’t know I’d be getting such a nice welcome today,” Dean said, his voice low and soft near Castiel’s ear.
Castiel grinned. “Are you okay to watch the kids? I wanted to bring Dean a beer.”
“Fucking Lucifer,” Castiel said, taking out a cigarette from his pocket and lighting up. He walked around the restaurant, looking closely at the spaces between each car, hoping to find some kind of lead. “Why didn’t you tell us how dirty the angels played? You send Dean off to do your dirty work, but you don’t even help us. Asshole. What did I expect from the devil? We were stupid enough to trust your word. Should have known better than to trust some dipshit fallen angel.”
So his arms were the only thing Castiel could offer him.
Castiel moved his wings, batting them just slightly. Then he stretched them out as he rolled his shoulders. “I’ve never felt better. I feel…invincible.”
“You want to throw a Halloween party, seventeen days before your due date?” Castiel asked.
“They’re practicing until the angel shows.” The man was young and attractive, blondish, with a pensive frown. “Adam,” he said, offering his hand.
“Fuck, I don’t have the record on me,” Dean said, wondering how quickly he could drive back to his place to pick it up.
Raejean looked at her, slightly confused.
“I wouldn’t, actually,” Dean said. “I’ve never done this before.”
That made Dean smirk.
“Your son is great with Dandy,” Amelia said. “Most kids tend to pull on her tail or slap her somewhere. Ben is very careful and kind. It says a lot about his character.”
Dean sat Claire on her high chair beside Naomi and kissed the top of her head. “You hungry, baby girl?”
So much, in fact, that Dean’s baked goods—most of them pies, thank you very much—were sold out before the end of the night during every annual Christmas bake sale.
Bobby read through the list, nodding his head. “That’s a real old car, son. Real old.”
Castiel’s gaze lingered on Dean before he turned back to the TV. It was difficult to concentrate for most of the movie when Castiel draped an arm around Dean’s shoulder and kept pressing kisses below his ear.
Dean snorted, sparing Castiel a glance, who had already started sweating.
house. Sure, I bought the damn thing, but I bought it for us. All of us. I wanted a place for you to call home, kid. So, I want you to be okay with this.”
“Yeah, I know what you mean,” Dean said. He stopped walking. “You wanna go back to our room? I miss the bed.”
“Yes, really.”
Dean gave Sam a hard look, but then he smiled at Rhonda. “Sure, I can walk you to your car.” It was only then that Dean let go of Castiel, but not before looking apologetically at him. Castiel understood, despite being subjected to this dinner. Dean walked with Rhonda out of the restaurant, leaving behind an uncomfortable silence.
“Hello, Anna,” Naomi said.
“You can join us if you want,” Dean said, not wanting to be rude.
? What if he wanted him in the same way, too? What if this entire time Castiel had really been flirting with Dean?
Dean winced, like he’d forgotten she was there, too. “Hello, Mrs. Novak.”
As the car moved, Dean thought of his family. He thought of them, and he smiled.
“Take Dandy in there with you.”
while smoking a joint. They’d learned to live comfortably with each other.
“An archangel. Right. Where the hell would I find one of those?”
“No, he isn’t.” Professor Novak smiled, this time only at Dean. It was a different smile, crooked. “Now, let’s continue before I’m rudely interrupted again.”
“I’m sorry, I know you’re busy, but talk to me. Are you okay?”
“I’m in,” Castiel said.
Castiel smiled. “You should come up with better insults. That’s weak, even for you.”
Dean stepped onto the porch, and turned around. “Oh, I can’t believe I forgot to tell you. Sam’s coming to the potluck tomorrow.”
“Why not?” Ben asked. “It tastes good.”
Dean chuckled. “So, come on. Where do you want me to take you now?”
“Cas, I didn’t know that being in love could feel this good and not as terrifying as I had expected.”
my friend.”
Castiel nodded. “I’ll keep that in mind. You should know I also hate many things about you. I hate the way you screamed my name during sex. I hate that Sebastian loves you way too much. I hate that you play air guitar when you listen to classic rock. I hate that you sing along to the songs. And I hate all of the freckles on your face. All thirty-six of them.”
“Look who’s finally here,” Esther said. “Our Castiel came to visit. Can I offer you a beer, sweetheart?”
Dean shivered under Castiel’s wandering hands that had slipped under his shirt to slide up his back.
more times than he could count, he spent most of the movie watching Cas’s reaction to it. For most of it, Cas hadn’t been sold on Tom Hanks’s character, but by the end, he was cheering for the couple.
“Oh, so now you think my Skittles are real food?” Dean said, taking out the bag from his jacket and tossing it over to Anna.
“We? Are you with Dean?”
And with a deep sigh, Lisa left.
Castiel bristled, pursing his lips and clenching his fists.
Once again, Charlie and Rosa locked eyes, grinning at each other.
“Hey, Castiel,” Sam said.
On Friday afternoon, Dean called Amelia to invite her to the movies.
Dean couldn’t help but smile. Castiel was joking with him. Things were good between them. Maybe Dean shouldn’t be so forward with Castiel. He would probably scare him off. Although, there was something that told him Castiel was just as drawn to Dean as he was to him. He could still remember Castiel’s touch from the night before. Soft at times, but firm at others. On the dance floor, Castiel’s hands on Dean’s hips had been strong and firm. It had felt delicious.
It was probably an obvious cry for help, but Castiel decided to drive to his old job. Granted, the Roadhouse had never been just a job for him. Ellen and Jo were like family. Working at the Roadhouse had been one of the best aspects of his life at one point. But the last time he’d stepped foot inside the diner was the last time he worked there.
Castiel sat on the bed and sighed. “I missed my bed.”
“Hey, Sammy.”
Dean set his empty glass on the nightstand before laying his head on Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel leaned his head on top of Dean’s. In so many ways, their relationship hadn’t changed from when they were just friends. Sure, things had gotten a lot more physical between them, but other than that this was them, in essence. Just two people who couldn’t get enough of each other, who found safety and comfort in each other’s company.
Castiel nodded. “I doubt she would have come anyway. My relationship with Anna isn’t that much better, but she did assist my wedding. I hear from her once, maybe twice, a year.”
time!”
“I never thought I’d be matchmaking you two when I assigned you to that desk.”
“It looks badass,” Dean said. “Amelia is super talented.”
“That was fun,” Ben said, sipping his water. “I love playing soccer.”
“Well, we can take over. It’ll be fun.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, kissing the top of Claire’s head. “She’s sixteen months old.”
Castiel stepped out onto the front porch, closing the door behind him. He crossed his arms, narrowing his eyes at her. “No, Lisa, I don’t like you. You have no idea the mess you left behind when you took off with Ben. Not only did it nearly destroy Dean, but it left him and his entire family thinking I’d pull the same thing you did. I’ve had to reassure everyone that I have no intention of ripping Claire away from him. And I don’t blame them. You did the unthinkable, only for you to realize your mistakes almost two years later and crawl back expecting for everything to go back to normal. That’s not real life. Dean may have forgiven you, but I don’t know if I ever will.”
Maybe Dean was being naïve, but he trusted Castiel.
“Thanks.” Dean found the first empty seat and tried to sink into it.
Castiel let him go, but not before sending Dean off with a soft, lingering kiss. “Call me when you get home.”
As soon as Dean sent the text, he regretted it. That was definitely too forward. More forward than Castiel wanting to hang out again. Castiel probably meant doing it again sometime with Charlie included in their plans. He wasn’t asking to be alone with Dean. Sighing with dread, Dean put his phone back in his pocket and grabbed a twelve pack of Coke, and then a twelve pack of Sprite.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, mixing the salad.
“Of course it wasn’t the prank. I’m not an amateur. Besides, you won’t ever see it coming.” Dean grinned, leaning forward. “So, how’s that book of yours coming?”
She swallowed and took a step back. “After all I’ve seen this past week, I don’t think I can be surprised by much. I
Dean smirked. He knew he’d win.
Castiel’s eyes softened. He pressed a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “I’m happy, too.”
“I know. I don’t care.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I mean, logistically, if we wanted to elope, we could get a plane ticket to Vegas and get married first thing in the morning.”
“I’m so glad you came back, Cas. And I’m sorry I never went to visit you. If I had known how you felt, I would have done more to stay in touch.”
Castiel pressed his lips to Dean’s again, soft and chaste. The kiss was so gentle and sweet that Dean thought he would fall over, so he wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck for support.
“I’m sorry that I ruined our moment,” Dean said. “I feel like I tend to do this. I don’t know how to be romantic like you.”
“Your mom has a house in China?”
Lisa shook her head. “I have to skip breakfast today. I’m running late. I told Joey I’d get there by 7:30 and it’s already 7:23.”
Castiel handed Dean one of the beers, and Dean thanked him. He was still getting the grill ready. “I didn’t know you were into grilling.”
“Are you ready?” Dean asked, his heart thumping wildly.
After getting out of the shower, Dean dried himself and wrapped a towel around his waist, heading back to his room.
Charlie tossed her fork at him. “I’m gay.”
Dean had never been happier.
“Dean,” Castiel said again.
