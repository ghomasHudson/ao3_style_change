And that was where he still was. Despite Banner' best efforts in stopping Tony from using his injured arm, it didn't stop Tony from trying to pry off the invading torture device with his free hand, getting blood all down his side and over the walls. No one came to clean up the blood and Tony was somewhat thankful for the daily douse of water that they threw at him, quickly getting rid of the flaking blood that was stuck to his skin uncomfortably. However, Tony soon gave up when he found that he was doing more damage than good to his arm, the device too tightly sealed and his finger nails were beyond cracked and splintered from trying to scratch at the clasp.
Wincing at the pain, Tony hissed at the woman to get off of him once again before she was doing as he asked, dragging him up to his unsteady feet with her. He stumbled slightly at the swift movement, still quite disoriented by the force of Romanov’s tackle but he quickly shook it off. As a last ditch attempt, Tony attempted to elbow Natasha in the face as she stooped up behind him but it was inevitably caught by the straight-faced woman.
They were all lit up, showing every aspect of the large cells that the people were trapped in. They all had a large bed, a toilet, a sink, all of it white and bright with the sterol lighting that came up from the floor itself, making it look too clean to be normal.
Quickly, Tony turned around and aimed a punch at his adversary, only for it to be caught by a leather clad hand and forced down to his chest. That was when he finally had a good look at his attacker, the blood draining from his features with a mixture of fear and dread as his chocolate brown eyes met with the poison green of an extremely pissed off Natasha Romanov.
At that thought, Thor couldn’t stop himself from tightening his hold on Antony for a fraction of a second, feeling his chest bloom with joy as he held the small man in his arms once again.
It was huge, taking the length and width of the entire building, the corners dark and empty of any and all life, like an abyss. But Tony wasn't really shocked by the largeness of the room, his eyes pinned onto the forms that looked at him with dull, unseeing, uncomprehending eyes... In the form of rooms were a few cages that Tony recognised at the Hulk container that was once on the helicarrier that Fury had been so proud of, the one that they had first put Loki in when they detained him, before the Battle of New York happened.
“Shit.” was all Tony managed, causing the Natasha Romanov of this universe to curve her lips in slight amusement before she flipped Tony onto his front once again.
One by one, each of the Avengers’ felt like their world was shattering and breaking apart around them… Tears and sobs slipped through their stone hard walls that blocked out emotions as they realised that they had lost their friend… Their dear friend that had come through for them again and again and yet…
Thanks for staying with this and everything even though I kind of dropped off the radar for so long!
After a moment longer with the hand over his face, it was removed and the hands were instantly on Tony's shoulders, pulling him up into a seated position. In less than a second, the man was using high tech tools and lock picking kits to destroy Tony's restrains that were on his ankles and the rope over his torso. Tony would have drawled over the nice tech that they handled if he wasn't in such a state of shock and happiness with who was in front of him in that moment.
Unfortunately for Tony, he had to do an assignment that was personally assigned to him by Fury (more like blackmailed into... Stupid Loki for turning him into a half human half cat that could purr and looked ridiculously cute to everyone but Tony himself...). The assignment was to make nice with some other superhero teams, which Tony wasn't really good at but apparently they needed him to work with (ugh!)
they get there so fast? Maybe Tony got knocked out for a minute or two? Yeah, that’s probably it. What Tony really didn’t understand was why they were all looking at him like he was a ghost.
Tony couldn't find it in himself to feel surprised by the agent's show of emotion, suddenly feeling a strange mix of depressed and relieved as his hand absentmindedly went to his arm, "Then I don't think you'll be able to take me..."
Familiar brown fluffy hair caught their eyes first, though it was a little longer than last they had seen him, his goatee was as sharp as ever around his chin, his clothes were white, an exact copy of Phil’s clothing - like prison garb. Then there was the differences. The awful differences. He was far too skinny, like they had restricted food from him, making his muscle mass decrease so that he’d be easily overpowered if he were to rebel. By the looks of all the bruises, cuts and bandages that were visible on the skin, he rebelled quite frequently. Steve felt a warmth of pride at that evidence, knowing that his friend fought tooth and nail against them at every chance. There was a line of bruises that marred his neck, that made it obvious that he was strangled. Then there were the strange random dots of bruises that splattered over his collar bones that looked vaguely familiar… Steve recoiled in disgust when he realised that the dotted bruises were hickey’s, making his rage boil in his blood and fists clench, a wish for his counterpart to be alive again just so that he could kill the man - by the looks of the rest of his teammates and Bruce’s quick retreat, they felt the same. A metal band encircled the genius’ bicep like a clamp, one that both Phil and Bucky had. But most agonising of all was that Tony's stare was vacant. Empty. Dead. Like Loki and Bucky's.
With lazy movements, the awful Steve Rogers of this world came into view, circling in front of him before he came to a stop, leering down at the trapped and immobile genius, a spark of something inhuman in his dark blue eyes. The dark Captain wasn't wearing his usual darkly coloured tight shirt and jeans, but his battle gear, the tight black of his less than standard suit like an insult to everything that Tony had ever created. But, as much as he hated the crappy protection gear, he hated Rogers even more.
Quickly getting dressed, Steve's eyes barely left the still form on his bed, wishing that the small man would face him, and look upon him with adoring brown eyes as he whispered words of love and affection. However, as it stood currently, Tony was turned away from him, low mutters of resentment passing through his lips instead of the sweet nothings that he so desired.
"I don't think any kind of warning would have prepared me for this..." Tony trailed off weakly as he looked at the silent and immobile prisoners that were merely a few feet away. From the corner of his eye, Tony could see a closed off room, no windows to see into it but the ominous feeling that Tony got from it sent a chill up his spine. He didn't need to be told what was in there to know what it was already. Tony could only hope that he never had to see the inside of it... "They're even crazier than I thought..." Tony muttered as he rubbed a hand over his face, the despair of the situation making him want to erupt into hysterical giggles, but he held back, opting to stay silent instead.
The rest of the team followed behind (Clint and Natasha suspiciously missing from the crowd) keeping pace a few steps behind a stumbling Tony, faces straight and unsympathetic to Tony's obvious pain. In their eyes, Tony would get what was coming to him, he would pay for resisting them, would suffer the consequences of trying to leave them.
Upon first looking at the new world they were in, it looked normal (if a bit more cleaner than their own), but they soon discovered that it was anything but. People screamed and ran in complete and utter terror at the mere sight of them and those that they were in contact with or allied with before had turned out to be evil, or killed by the Avengers of this world. There was no Nick Fury, or SHIELD, or Pepper, or Rhodey, or even a Fantastic Four team. It was all distorted and dream-like, Steve unable to even comprehend what they had all become...
He went to rub the palms of his hands over his face, but his expression quickly changed from one of suffering to one of confusion when something stopped him. Looking down, his mind went blank once again as he stared down at the large cuffs that practically engulfed his forearms; he couldn't move his legs either so they were probably in the same situation as his arms.
There were a few chuckles around the room when there was a loud beeping noise, making everyone freeze and fall quiet. All eyes eagerly felling on the blinking screen that made the noise.
There was a metallic click and Tony knew that the thing was now secured around his arm, blood running down his arm around the contraption that was now nestled firmly against his skin. Tony breathed deeply as he blinked the pained tears from his eyes and looked down, noting that the dull lights were now green.
As Rogers looked up, eyes promising a painful death upon anyone within his near vicinity, Tony smirked, copying Rogers smirk to throw back in his face, before he made a show of leaning forward and spitting out a mouthful of blood that they both knew was the Captain's.
However, he blinked in slow surprise when a pair of black boots stepped into his field of vision. His gaze slowly trailing up, his numb feelings crawling back with a vengeance as heart-seizing fear clogged in his chest, making it hard to breath.
Bound and secure as he was, he was at the table having breakfast with the Team of Dictators, making nice, smiling and joking like normal, as if he wasn’t tied to a chair with Barton feeding him small chunks of fruit and pancake. More often than not, the douche would make little airplane noises as he fed the genius, a joyful spark in his eyes and a smirk playing on his lips.
Soft and gentle wasn't really Tony's way of escaping though; he was more for blowing the living day lights out of his enemies and coming out relatively unscathed. Unfortunately for him, the Avengers of this universe would probably counteract the explosion before it even happened, they were too smart and crazy - and, unlike Tony's other enemies, the dark Avengers scared him to the very depths of his soul... This time, Tony would begrudgingly admit, slow and steady wins the race for freedom. And so he stood patiently, eyes trained on the god for any sudden movements that would indicate that Loki was aware of anything.
The throbbing in his head and all over his body got louder and louder in his ears until Tony was turning his face away in vain to hide from the offending noise that felt like it was trying to storm through his eardrums and damage his brain even more. It felt like someone had put a bucket over his head and was using a sledgehammer to tap out to a jam.
Nodding in agreement, Rhoades spoke up, a faint smile on his lips, "I'd listen to those two. Tony will be fine for the time being and if they're anything like you guys, he would have them wrapped around his little finger within a week." puffing his chest up with overconfidence that he didn't have, trying to keep his overwhelming worry at bay.
Tony, like an idiot, stared at the closed door with wide, unbelieving eyes before he was finally able to snap himself out of his stupor. Peeling himself up off of the carpeted floors, Tony went over to his bed as fast as he could, hurriedly ripping off the neatly arranged covers, uncaring of where exactly they landed, before doing the same with the bed-spread.
“Birdbrain…” Tony mumbled quietly to himself as he let Clint feed him. From the corner of his eye, Tony could see the smirks from the others and the prideful gleam in Clint’s eyes.
A shudder made its way up Tony's back, making him feel like a ghost had walked through him, and before he could really stop himself, Tony felt panic settle firmly into his mind. The fear that had been eating up at him since he first arrived in this dystopian world, so twisted and wrong that it made Tony want to puke just by being there. He hated this world. He hated this team. And, most of all, he hated Rogers.
Feeling the rest of his colour drain out of his face, Tony frantically searched about and thanked the heavens when he found a cleaning bucket that hadn't been put away. Collapsing heavily onto his knees, Tony clutched the bucket like a life-line as he heaved his guts out. When there was nothing left in his stomach, not that there was much in the first place, he dry heaved a few painful times before he managed to stop, eyes streaming and breathes shaky and hitched before he set the bucket down carefully with trembling limbs.
Gently, Thor landed on the Avengers Tower’s large balcony before instantly holstering his hammer and moving his precious cargo into both of his arms. As he walked, he looked down at the sleeping face of his old friend: his hair was a fluffy brown with healthy and lightly tanned skin in the exact shade that he remembered, full eye lashes and a sharply cut goatee carefully crafted onto the man’s chin and upper lip. Antony was small and short in height, as he had always been, but the way he seemed to be dwarfed in Thor’s large arms had the god smiling a softer smile than he had in years. He was very fortunate to have his Shield Brother back, a second chance to protect him…
Time ticking warningly in the back of his mind, Tony removed all of his cuffs and threw them across the room before getting up from the floor and getting to work on the door that blocked him from his freedom that he so desperately needed.
Instead of the expected reaction of Phil shaking his head in pity and then walking off without Tony, he was surprised when Phil took something out of his bag and started to lather a clear liquid around some tin foil before he started to wrap it around the metal band on his arm. When he was done, he gave Tony a wary smile before he clamped his uninjured bicep and stated, "We're good to go."
At the moment, Tony was fairly sure that none of the dark Avengers has figured this out yet, which was a good thing in his eyes.
Blinking, Tony didn’t think that he’d heard that correctly as he looked to Richards to confirm, only to receive none as the idiot was still in shock. It didn’t take him long to snap out of it, “WHAT!? Are you kidding me?! I get sent to another dimension where I’m dead and the whole team goes bad?! And you too, Thor? What happened to Jane?” Okay, maybe it wasn’t the best idea to rant to the evil Avengers team about the fact that they’re evil but he was tired and nauseous and a tad bit hysterical. He also never really had a brain to mouth filter but who cares?!
If there was anything he said about there being a small miracle about the dark Avengers wanting him to be alive more than they wanted him dead, he was severely mistaken. Being dead was more of a blessing than what
Glaring heatedly at the broad-shouldered man, Tony set his lips into a grim line, his silence in the face of the man speaking louder of his feelings towards him than any descriptive death threat ever could. His silence seemed to irritate the Captain, his twisted smile on his lips turning into a jaw-clenching frown as he toward predatorily over the smaller man. He made one last circle around Tony before he finally came to a stop, arms folded behind his back in a mockery of a gentleman's pose, chilling blue eyes alight with something that Tony couldn't quite put his finger on...
Then, he looked up, squinting through the light, until his eyes came to rest on the form of one Phil Coulson. Though his suit was gone, replaced by a plain white shirt and white trousers, looking like he was a runaway hospital patient, and he looked a little worse for wear. A large bruise covered by the majority of his left cheek, he had a small cut on his eyebrow and a slit lip. But worse off were his eyes. The usual cool blue, full of calm waters, were wide with panic and flashing with overwhelming regret, fists punching the thick impenetrable glass and leaving behind smudges of blood from his slit knuckles.
"I'm sorry." came his muffled voice from behind the thick glass. Then he turned away, shame lining in every inch of his body, before he sat down, head bowed.
Then, the next second, Tony's world was alight in pain, electricity making his muscles spasm and his throat raw from constant screaming of pain. It seemed to last a lifetime before the blessed darkness enveloped him like a warm, comforting blanket, drawing him away from a world of pain and suffering.
Avengers report to the North, East wing of the building, Immediately.” With that, the speakers cut off and Banner, in a rush grabbed Tony’s arm and marched him the rest of the way to the room, which was thankfully on the opposite side of the building to the action.
Within a few minutes, Tony was picking himself up from the floor, dusting his hands off, and walking over to the door, easily prying it open with his fingers and letting Coulson run in to help with a silent and still Bucky.
As they stepped into the living room, the soft lighting seeming to cast twisted, festering, and foreboding shadows in all corners of the large room, seeming to respond to Rogers' ire. Seamlessly, Rogers threw Tony into the plush cushions of the sofa and the smaller was unable to suppress a shudder as a chill settled in his spine. Looking up at the furious glinting eyes - dark, so dark with fury it was like staring into the darkest depths of the ocean in stormy weather - the usually immaculately swept back hair was splayed across his forehead in a few strands of blond, his jaw clenching and unclenching and his knuckles were still white, looking to be a few moments away from punching through a random wall, or a person. Dear God, Tony really wished that Rogers wasn't about to beat another person to death.
With an expression of triumph, Tony yanked the springs from the mattress that he’d laid on countless nights. Not waisting anymore time, Tony used the metal spring to expertly pick the lock of his restraints (he’d been picking locks since he was six years old in order to get to Howard’s lab for his tools, why wouldn’t be be an expert?). For the first time in weeks, an almost painful feeling of hope and joy filled his chest, making him feel warm and want to cry at the same time. God, he didn’t even realise how much this place was getting to him until now, now that he was the closest he’s ever been to freedom and home in what must have been several months now. God, he couldn’t wait to get back to his lab, his robots, his JARVIS, and his real team.
“Guys, you don’t have to do this.” was all he could say before he felt a prick on the side of his neck, a numbing sensation spreading through his body. He couldn’t even throw a punch at Thor when he released Tony and started to carry him like a newly wed bride.
And with that parting remark, Rogers left his field of vision and Tony knew what was coming next, his eyes widen and his heart fluttered like a dying bird trying to escape the fox's jaws one last time.
"God! S-Stop!" Tony managed to shout out, kicking his legs out uselessly, unable to kick anyone even remotely close to him. He was about to say more, when his head was forced back, hitting the back of the sofa with a painful thump that rattled his brain, the large warm hand over his forehead proving to be impossible to fight against as another pair of hands buckled the horribly familiar leather collar around his throat a bit more tighter than necessary, making it so that Tony couldn't move forward or thrash at all.
At the time, the dark Avengers and Tony were in the living room watching a movie, well-accustomned restraints keeping him in place on the sofa. Tony honestly hadn’t been paying attention to, his mind set on numerous risky escape plans that he was either putting on the back-burner or tossing aside, when a young man walked in. It wasn’t even a ‘man’ per say, he looked like a kid at the age of sixteen, nervous and shaking as he came up to the dark Avengers, eyes shifty and beginning to sweat. What was really the clincher for his age was when the boy asked to speak with Rogers, his voice breaking as he spoke.
With that, Natasha grabbed Tony’s arm in a bruising grip, practically dragging him out of the car garage and to the ground floor, ignoring his curses and jabbing at painful pressure points in his back or twisting his fingers if he struggled a bit too much for her liking.
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, as he had long since gone numb, oblivious to the changes around him or the steady passing of time. It was only him and his blank mind.
Tony would have asked but no small amount of fear of being heard kept his mouth firmly shut, breathing shallowly through his nose as he moved through the vents.
Rogers didn't say anything, his lips thin as he looked down at the man before him, the man that was slowly cracking, slowly breaking beyond recognition, with a blank face and even blanker eyes. Slowly, Tony felt his resolve give in and he bowed his head and let his lengthy hair fall over his face in shame as he let his miserable tears flow freely down his face, his shoulders shaking in barely contained sobs and gasps of breath. Desperately, Tony wanted to go home, go to his team, banter with JARVIS, get yelled at by Pepper, and talk with Rhodey about the 'good ol' days'. But, unfortunately, more than anything, more than his desire to go home, he wanted to escape the darkness and silence that he'd currently been subjected to. And Rogers and the others were his salvation.
Taking a subtle deep breath, Tony looked into the dark Captain's eyes, and only his, "I wanted to go home. I don't belong here and it could be destroying both of our universes at the same time. This situation, in which I am here, is not researched enough for risks and assumptions to be made. I need to go back to where I belong. If you value your lives, I suggest you let me go and accept the fact that I am not a substitute and that your Tony is dead. I need to go back home, to my team, to my friends, to my world, and you are stopping me from trying to save you from yourself and your obsession!" Tony finished, glaring harshly into the Captain's ice-shard eyes.
Frowning, Phil opened his mouth before his eyes tracked Tony's hand movements, and he was on the bandage within seconds, unwrapping it almost desperately before freezing. He let out a regretful sigh as he uncovered the device completely, revealing the steel metal band around his bicep, the skin around the area an irritant red, but looking well on its way to healing with the barbed needles embedded.
It took Tony a while to finally realise that there was a hand on his shoulder, warmth radiating from it and a low voice bringing him out of his dazed state. With shaky, slightly numb, fingers, Tony reached around and clenched the hand that was offered to him, unsure if he was shaking with fear or rage, listening as the voice told him to breath, counting and getting him to focus.
Panting and sweating slightly from going down over fifty flights of stairs, Tony picked the lock on another door to gain access to the garage before swinging it open. On unsteady legs, Tony stepped a foot into the garage, eyeing a car to his left as he did so. His get-away-car-to-be was nice, a dark red with a few scratches that were slightly visible, faint but still there. It was an older model car but it was low-key and looked like an average car. It would d—
At that small taunt, Tony couldn’t help but picture Happy, laying on the floor, twisted and broken, expressive brown eyes unseeing. He saw Rhodey, still in his war machine suit, the armour half ripped off with the centre piece missing, blood running out of the hole like a waterfall. Then he saw Pepper, fiery, brave, pepper-spraying Pepper, dead and alone in a random hallway. Her bright orange hair painted a dark rusty red from her own blood, bright blue eyes dim with lifelessness, her normally immaculate dress-suit dishevelled, ripped and soaking with blood…
Ignoring the weird vibe of the room, Tony frowned in confusion at the people in the room that weren’t there a second ago. How
It was days later (?) that his routine broke once again. Rogers stood at the doorway, a light surrounding his silhouette, making him look like an angel saviour - what a deceiving light... It was a few minutes of silence as Rogers only stood there, staring down at Tony's dirtied and slumped form, the genius not even having enough energy to stand up and make a strong front; he just too exhausted to care right now.
Thank whatever deity that’s real! He was getting the fuck out of here. Away from these crazy people that aren’t his teammates, that aren’t his friends. To Richards’ lab to try and find any of his research that is still there, or perhaps missed during clean-up. If not, he took part in Richards’ experiment at home, he knew the ins and outs of it all. Maybe he could recreate it and get himself home. There were plenty of shady placed in the city, if not the country, that could provide him the space that he needed. After he was safely away from these crazy people, all Tony really had to do was recreate the experiment and then he was home.
Tingly electricity seemed to slide across his skin, and a sound equivalent to the electric current echoed in his ears loud enough to hurt. His body convulsed with every spike of electricity, scarred hands gripping the sides of his head in a futile attempt to shut out the painful echo as he cried out in pain and fear. It was only a second later that he landed on hard ground, the breath in his lungs being immediately driven out, no jolt of electricity could be felt and everything was deathly silent.
"I guess they haven't brought you here yet. Sorry. I should have warned you." Agent stated in his usual monotone as he looked over Tony, trying to determine if he was alright.
Naturally, Tony was working on an escape plan but it was extremely hard when he had to be so careful. The careful factor of his planning was made one of his top priorities when he witnessed something on the second or third week into his imprisonment— something completely disgusting and unforgiving…
A dark chuckle interrupted Tony's speech of reassurance, making his breath catch in his throat as a chill ran down his spine like he’d just been doused in a bucket of iced-water. He knew that laugh all too well. And he hated it more than he hated bad science...
Broken glasses and bits of loose paper dotted amongst the chaos (again, why isn’t it a holo-screen?), Tony was expecting to see, what he wasn’t expecting to see was his teammates standing only a few feet away from him and a wide eyed Richards to his side. When did they get there? And why did Richards look so scared?
"We need to set them free," he interrupted the genius' mental cursing, drawing his gaze to him, "They've been here before they even found me in the first place..."
The man was smart, Tony will give him that but he looked and spoke to Tony like he was dump due to Tony's area of expertise being mechanics and machinery. Tony may not have known as much as Richards did about portals and soft science (also known as biology) but he had a bit of understanding. For instance, Tony understood that it was dangerous to turn on the machine that was supposed to be a portal without a secure and safe facility, which the top of the Baxter Building wasn't.
His eyes burned with unshed tears and his emotions fought and conflicted with one another, confusing him beyond belief.
Thankfully, whatever god existed out there, that Tony had been constantly nagging, finally answered. An opportunity had arisen not one month after Rogers murdered the kid.
All in all, Tony and the other Avengers were close knitted friends, even more so when Tony found Steve's long lost war buddy, James 'Bucky' Barnes and helped the war veteran with his issues along with Steve and the rest of the group.
The fingers continued to card soothingly through his hair and slowly, Tony felt himself relaxing into the comforting warmth that all super soldiers seemed to have. Exhaustion, both physical and emotional, hit Tony like a brick wall and it wasn't long until Tony found himself snuggling into the firm chest of Steve Rogers, cradled effortlessly in the man's arms as he steadily walked down the hall.
There was only time for a second of confusion before Tony felt something sharp in his neck and his world started to gradually get darker. The last thing he heard before darkness completely enveloped him was the taunting voice of the dark Captain above him, Tony having falling into the man's arms, "You'll wake up in your punishment, Tones..." accompanied by a low chuckle.
When Tony finally woke up from his deep slumber, it was to a very disturbing and horrifying sight...
He caught a small curve of the woman’s red-painted lips, which was practically Romanov rolling around on the floor laughing at the hilarity of it, and said in her usually soft and even voice, “Maybe if you look pitiful enough he wont be too hard on you.”
Then, Tony's eyes slid down to the Agent's arm, seeing a tight band of metal that seemed to be infused around the Agent's bicep, peeking through the rough bandages that were still collecting blood. Then he looked down at his own arm that held the exact same metal band and everything came flooding back… All sluggish thought was suddenly kicked into hyper-gear as Tony's half-lidded eyes shot open wide, before he tried to struggle and thrash in his seat, the metal not giving way.
"What the hell is that thing?" Tony growled out with a hateful glare at the stoic doctor, who looked like he wouldn't regret what he'd just done for the world.
time, but he knew that they would keep trying, keep trying to make him believe that this was his home all along, that he belonged there. He knew that if he grew desperate enough, he would start to believe it and that’s what scared him the most out of everything that could possibly happen to him…
However, it was all in vain as Thor easily lifted him up and onto the chair, catching the desperate kicks and punches before he secured them down into the built in shackles on the chair. However, it wasn't done, as more shackles were clicked into place, around his thighs and shins, around his forearms and around his neck. Straps, like belts, were fastened around his chest and hips, effectively pinning him to the chair with no slack in his binds.
Opening the sealed door, Banner shoved Tony inside, making the middle-aged man trip on the chains around his feet and nearly face-plant the floor. “Sorry, Tony,” Banner cringed apologetically as Tony glared up at the buzz-cut Doctor, his hair considerably shorter than Tony’s own Doctor Banner that was his timid-smiled science baddy, “I’ll get Clint to check on you after we’ve dealt with the intruders, I’ll probably be too busy analysing the dead bodies from the after-battle.”
"It didn't have to be this way, Tony." Rogers ignored his comment, which Tony couldn't really summon the energy to care about at this moment, fear once again clutching his heart in its icy, clawed grip, "We could have been happy. You could have been happy. I would have made you a king, a man that's waited on hand and foot, respected and feared. The most protected man in the universe with all of us by your side. But no, you just had to hold on to your old team too tight." he finished off bitterly, eyes filled with something, a dark, unspeakable intent that had Tony shuddering in fear.
The cost of that, the pain and mental torment that he went through surfaced back up. He knew the results of escaping and they were by no means the result of anything good. Even now Tony was suffering from his last escape attempt - the pulsating pain in his arm doubling with the reminder of it. The pulsating pain seemed like a warning, a reminder of what had happened to him. Then, faster than water from a sink, all of his happiness and energy in seeing Coulson, in being able to finally get out of there, drained away.
, Tony made a gesture to the team, “Why do you guys look like emos? If you didn’t like the armour I made you, you should have just said so…” damn it. Quickly, Tony turned to a still shocked Richards and made a rude hand gesture, “And fuck you Richards! You said it was safe and you practically blew me through a wall! You just prove that Fury was wrong - like always - and that you have zero regard for safety!” he berated the younger scientist. You’d think a guy would learn about science safety after his catastrophe of an experiment in space to prove the advancement of human DNA.
However, like Loki, the alternate Bucky didn't react, hollow and cold as he stared off into the distance, unseeing. It was obvious what had happened...
Clint chuckled from the high railings that he was expertly perched on, overviewing everything that was taking place around the large lab, "If anything, Tones is probably living it up with our alternate selves, giving them the shock of the century. That universe wouldn't even know what hit 'em," Clint chuckled before he pointed a finger towards the younger Storm sibling that was leaning against the wall, keeping well out of the way of everything, "I saw you picking your nose." smirking when he saw the subtle flush the fire-wielder had rising on his cheeks.
"You bastards!" Tony hissed as he felt hard hands seize his flailing legs in bruising grips, pinning them harshly to the chair, making him completely vulnerable and immobile.
Tony nodded, feeling clam and hopeful, though he did everything in his power to squash the hope down, for he knew that if this escape didn't work and he was put through the punishment that the psycho Captain would come up with, it would kill him and break him like he was so close to doing right now. If they were caught, it was over. For both of them...
A cruel laugh reverberated around the room, filling the very air until it was nearly all consuming...
That would mean that he would have to cause some kind of distraction when everyone had settled down, something that would distract them long enough for Tony to slip away - a kitchen explosion maybe? They had gotten to a point in his imprisonment where he was allowed to walk around the kitchen and fix his own food, his left foot being accompanied by a minimum of six feet of solid steel chain that was bolted to the kitchen floor— of course.
Many of his other comrades had done the same, going out of their way to kill those people and it wasn’t long before people started to catch onto what they were doing, especially when they killed a Iron Man protester on the streets in broad daylight. After that, they lost all trust and respect of the public and it wasn’t long until SHIELD and the Army were sent to contain them. However, after they killed a hundred-thousand odd men and women, they were declared defeated and it wasn’t long before they took over America, it had barely taken a month. It took another year to get the whole world to their knees alongside the land of America. And, just like that, they were ruling the world.
"Widow, watch out!" Steve shouted, blood disturbing his field of vision as it trailed down from the wound on his forehead and into his eye. He saw that she dodged the attack, putting her opponent into a headlock until they stopped moving, using his body as a shield as she swung her flexible body around and kicked two others in the face.
, he didn't appreciate the amount of recklessness the guy was willing to put into an experiment of science. Tony loved science but he always did it safely and in a secure environment while Richards was willing to cut corners and make reckless estimations without experimental trials, which Tony did
Almost immediately, Tony knew that he'd angered the Captain more than he ever could as his face twisted into something dark and morbid with Tony's words alone and the room had grown so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Tony knew he'd regret telling the blunt truth that Tony 'hated their guts' and they 'terrified and disgusted him', so he decided to voice his other, equally alarming concerns. However, his avoidance of blunt honesty didn't do him many favours...
Phil didn't stay anything, his expression grim as he stood up from crouching in front of Tony. As he walked towards the round glass cells, he eyed the keypad with a longing look before he turned around and looked at Tony, who was glaring at the boxed-out room in the corner.
When they stepped into the elevator, Romanov pressing the button for their floor, Tony’s shoulders finally sagged in defeat, there was no way of getting out of this now…
Baring his blood stained teeth like a cornered animal, Tony ginned widely, showing the twisted asshole that he had no regrets in his actions.
At that comment, Tony felt pure hot rage ignite his veins and it was the only thing fuelling him as Rogers made to move back and Tony spat in his face, making everyone still in the room, no one even daring to breath.
Later on, Tony woke up in a dark room, the place pitch black to the point where he couldn't even see his hand in front of his face, and the heat around him was stifling to the point of suffocation. It reminded hand him of Afghanistan. The darkness of the cave, the sweltering heat, unable to escape, unable to see the sky when he looked up... It was horrible...
One moment, everything was still, the next, Rogers looking to be surging towards him, fury in his eyes and looking to hit Tony like he did to that kid. Tony was only thankful that Thor was fast enough with his godly power to hold Rogers back from harming him. He was so focused on the enraged struggle that Tony didn’t notice when Romanov came into the room and up behind him, hitting him with a sleeping dose once again; knocking him out in seconds…
As Thor grew closer with Tony in tow, the smaller man got a clearer view of the chair and he felt the blood drain from his face at the sight of it. Immediately, Tony tried to wrench his hand free from the god's vice-like grip, grunting and gritting his teeth against the pain.
Unlike the other two, Phil was laying on his bed, faced away, the slow rise and fall of his chest indicating that he was asleep and unaware of their presence. But he soon startled awake, face catching in a horrified state before it morphed into blankness. He looked towards the team in distaste, anger and hatred so pure in his blue eyes as he looked at them, they couldn't help but flinch back.
Tony seemed to come to himself at that point and tried to shift away from the gentle touches of his captors, but it became futile as he realised that he was still well restrained, unable to even shift. A small jerk in an attempt to loosen the belts sent a dull throb down his arm and he bit his tongue in an attempt to swallow his groan of pain.
"Loki." Tony started, trying to gain the trickster's attention, "Loki, it's me, Tony Stark. Iron Man..." he tagged on at the end with an awkward wince, Tony was sure that he was the last person that Loki wanted to be saved by, but beggars can't be choosers. "We're going to get you out of here, okay? Then we're going to get those things off your wrists and cut those strings." he nodded, his reassuring smile was shaky as he did so. He avoided looking at the stitches that held his mouth together, not sure if he would be able to stomach the sight up close. Did Thor do this to Loki? Because if he did, this was just sick. Beyond sick. This was just pure evil...
"You will never have the honour of dying by my hand and as long as I say so, you will not die by anyone's hand. Don't you understand yet, Tony," Rogers whispered, his hot breath blowing into his ear in a mockery of a lover's affection, "I own your thoughts, I own your actions, I own the breath that you take into your lungs, and I own the blood that runs through your body. You will never escape this, Tony; not by running away, nor by death at yours or anyone else's hand.
Suddenly, Tony’s world was turned on his side as a weight tackled him from behind, making Tony scrape his chin on the cemented ground, the burst of copper on his tongue let him know that he’d bitten his tongue slightly in the fall.
At the third punch, the kid went down and Rogers resulted to kicking him. The others did nothing but smirk or laugh, giving words of encouragement to Steve to ‘teach the kid a lesson’. Tony was so mortified that he was barely able to speak but when the kid went down, Tony snapped out of it and started to struggle, thrashing in his bonds in a desperate attempt to try and escape and help the kid.
With growing horror, Tony's eyes dragged themselves away from the beaten form of Loki and pinned to the other. He felt all the colour drain from his face as his eyes fell onto the other person that resided in the cell next to Loki's own. The man's brown hair was cut short, into a style that suited a man from Steve Rogers' memories, his clothes very much the same and his arm seemingly ripped off from his socket, the wires and plates of metal still bent and twisted from what had happened to it. Bucky Barnes sat on his bed, in his cell, his own metal band on the bicep of his remaining arm, steel blue eyes blank and staring at the same wall that Loki was, they were empty, dead. It didn't take Tony long to figure out exactly what had been done to the two prisoners as he took in the familiar state that Barnes was in. It was a state that Tony recognised from his HYDRA days, when those bastards had used the Chair on him...
"What the fuck are you doing?!" Tony shrieked as he attempted to roll away from the Captain, already knowing that he was well restrained with the far too familiar weight around his ankles. However, his escape was short lived as Rogers only chuckled before he used his superior strength to pull Tony back in, pressing the genius flush against his hard muscled chest.
Tony wasn't embarrassed to admit that he was trembling with absolute fear as his wide eyes locked onto what Banner had in his hand. It was a metal hoop, a thick one that looked like a shackle but was lacking the chain. On the outside, Tony could see two dim lights, the device not turned on yet. On the inside of the metal band was what scared Tony the most, the inside held four one-inch long barbed needles, each one at least a centimetre thick at the base, making it look like a futuristic torture device.
Distantly, Tony was reminded of the time he was held captive in the Afghanistan caves, the constant danger to his and his fellow prisoner’s lives, under constant supervision, constant fear and constant pain from the new addition in his chest.
He chuckled softly as Tony snuggled more into him, his fingers lax with fatigue, but still somewhat gripping onto Steve's cotton shirt. Pressing a delicate kiss to the genius' head, ignoring the foul smell that came with being in the Black Box for an entire month (Steve was sure that Tony had no idea how long he'd truly been there and he never would), as he headed to his room.
When Tony opened his mouth to sneer something else at Rogers, he suddenly found something being forced into his mouth. It only took him a second to register that it was a mouth guard. Then the chair began to move, forcing him into an uncomfortably stretched standing position, feet inches from the floor.
Shaking his head, Tony looked from Banner to the thing that Tony would describe as a small collar, but it seemed just a little too small for his neck. "Bruce, don't! I wont try to run again! I swear!" Tony shouted as he tried to thrash in the chair, strength renewed with his new fear, trying desperately to get away from the crazy quack of a Doctor, "Don't put that thing on my neck!"
The movie was put on pause and Rogers had gotten up to talk to the kid but he wasn’t the smiling and easy going Rogers that Tony had been forced to endure for the last couple of weeks and in that moment, Tony felt true fear for the boy. As Rogers got closer, form towering over the kid who had gone very pale, Tony opened his mouth to speak up and try to distract the super soldier when Rogers lashed out. The action was so quick that Tony barely saw it happen. The punch landing on the kids face was hard and unforgiving, sending the kid back into the wall with a hard ‘thunk!’. But it wasn’t over as, after the first hit, came another and another, each hit even more brutal than the last, cutting the kids face and happening so fast that he was barely able to cry out in pain.
"Shit. Shit. Shit!" he hissed as he struggled and twisted his body to no avail. Then he looked to the trapped ex-SHIELD Agent and said with a desperate lilt to his voice, "Phil, you were supposed to get out of here!"
They got closer to the door and from the corner of his eye, Tony could see Coulson stepping out of the prison cell with a blank-eyed Bucky Barnes, being as careful in his touches and movements as Tony was being with Loki. As Tony got to the open door with his charge in hand, Tony felt hid heart swell and a smile grow, they were getting out, they all were and with every step he took, Tony's faith in the escape grew. That was until Tony got within a centimetre of stepping out of the damn, rotten cage, a loud buzz close by make him freeze in the spot, his skin going pale and clammy in the space of a few seconds in his utterly pure panic.
Having everything they could ever want or need, they looked after the people with strict rules and harsh punishments. They were feared and powerful but despite this, they all knew that they were missing a certain sarcastic genius.
Later, he would wake up loosely chained to the wall in a boxed white room, food served to him three times a day and forced to eat it when he refused. He spent three days in that room and Tony didn’t think he’d ever come so close to insanity in his life…
Tony was then left alone in Rogers room, on his bed. The thought made Tony shudder in disgust and he felt sick at the memory of what had just happened... It made his skin itch and the near-overwhelming desire for a shower to wash away the phantom touches over his neck and chest. He could feel his face heat in fury and shame of what had just occurred and the position, in which Rogers and the other twisted team members, had reserved for him became clearer than it ever had before and Tony could barely keep down the bile that rose in his throat.
Stroking one finger tenderly down the genius' face, admiring the small puffs of breath that he let out as he sunk deeper into sleep, before he removed his own shirt and trousers, leaving him in just his pants, and then climbed into his bed. His arm possessively curled around his genius as Steve stuck his nose in the other's hair, taking a deep breath like a drug addict getting his dosage after so long from being apart from it. Even his scent was the same as his old Tony...
And while Steve dropped to his knees in utter devastation, Tony looked on at the wall. Golden brown eyes that were once alight with genius and creativity was dull and empty, like a marvellous structure that had given way to fire and now all that was left was the distant blowing off ash in the wind... And just like the objects and irreplaceable possessions lost to the fire, Tony was lost to them as well.
"MMM!" he tried to yell in alarm, attempting to pull back, crying out in pain when the soldier tightened his grip.
At his question to Thor, thunder clapped loudly overhead as Thor’s features seemed to darken. When he spoke, it was a chilling cold that Tony had never thought the happy thunder god was capable of, “She rejected me after the great battle of New York. She said that the city fell due to our… ruthlessness.”
Tony didn't know how long he'd been there but he could count that he'd have around three panic attacks already and his growing stench didn't particularly bother him any more. Everyday, Tony got three visits: a bit of bred for breakfast, a bit of cheese for lunch, a bit of meat for dinner (better than the limited rice that had to be split between two people with the Ten Rings). In those times when the door opened, a large bowl of freezing water would be chucked over him, startling him so bad that he couldn't react until the door was closed and his food and a small cup of water awaited his attention. The water must have been Bruce's idea, an effort to stop him from overheating and dying.
! “‘Cause— Wait… emo uniforms, shocked faces and a portal… I’m not in Kansas anymore, am I?” Their continued shocked expressions were answer enough… “Damn it.” He groaned softly as he rubbed his temples trying to fend off the strengthening headache. It’d taken him longer to figure that one out than it should have - he blamed Richards...
But as he looked at the disappointment clear on the dark Captain's face, Tony knew that he would never be able to sleep forever. These people wouldn't let him...
Looking down, Tony saw the device Bruce was holding, two of the barbed needles buried firmly into the back of his bicep, blood already flowing like small rivers down his arm, dripping off of his finger tips. It was still open and Tony watched with pain filled eyes as Banner started to close it, the hovering pressure of the last two needles threatening at his skin. Shaking his head with wide eyes, Tony could only say, "No, Bruce, don't!" before pain erupted throughout his arm once again, brining tears to his eyes as he grunted and gritted his teeth until his jaw ached. He refused to give them the satisfaction of him screaming...
Breaking out into a huge grin, Tony barely resisted the urge to laugh outright, instead keeping his voice to a low whisper, shifting his eyes to the door to make sure that they were properly alone. Wasn't Thor supposed to be here any minute?
"Bruce, Thor, please," he begged, Tony really didn't want to look at Bruce and not relate him with anything but the meekly quiet Doctor, not the monster-versions that he could relate everyone else to, "Whatever you're about to do, don't. Don't do this. Please don't."
"I'll send Thor up soon to help you shower and get cleaned up. See you later." he bided before he stepped out of the room, triple locking the door behind him. Steve was sure that the genius wouldn't be able to attempt to escape again so soon, especially with the new accessory that he was still healing from and his depleted energy from the dark room - still not 100% despite sleeping for hours the night before. But Steve wouldn't leave it to chance. Not again.
Silently, Steve observed the man that he thought he would never see again. He remembered the heart wrenching pain that erupted in his heart when he heard of his Tony's death. He almost went completely mad with rage at the response his death brought from the public, wanting to slaughter and laugh and drench himself in their blood and fear. Instead, he settled for world domination. To have the man back was like returning from Hell and being embraced by an angel, everything about him was like his own Tony. This Tony was strong, smart, a smooth talker, an observer, an adamant listener, cunning, sly, everything that his own Tony was - although, he seemed to somehow be less innocent than what his Tony was like, able to tell that they weren't the embodiment of good within an instant.
In response, Loki did nothing, giving no indication that he had heard Tony or anything at all. He was an empty shell and Tony felt his chest constrict painfully around his arc reactor at the thought of Loki being stuck like this forever. No one should have to suffer this much... Not even a once-enemy like Loki...
"There were many of those who had wronged you, my friend," Thor spoke up for the first time since Banner had put the device on, coming over to place a large hand on his uninjured shoulder and squeezing it comfortingly, "Far too many..." Thor trailed off darkly, something strange in his voice and something unrecognisable in the thunder god's usually juvenile blue eyes.
With one last stroke of Tony’s thick hair, sweeping the soft strands from the man’s face, he got to work of getting Antony comfortable. He removed the man’s shoes and socks as well as his slightly burnt shirt before tucking the mortal into bed.
Desperately, Tony looked to Phil, who had witnessed the whole thing. The look on the Agent's face sealed the deal for Tony; that look of utter defeat, utter despair and regret, eyes full of apology and remorse for what they other would have to go through. The look was heart-breaking and Tony knew that he'd run out of tunes to play. This was it...
Loki moved like a doll, reacting to Tony with little prompting, standing easily and walking to the open doorway, eyes still as blank as ever, movements robotic and stiff. Again, Tony felt a chilling crawl along his skin at the thought of what the hell the team had done to the fiery god to make him seem so docile and dead.
Everyday, Tony was with someone, never left alone for one little second of each day and it would always be with one of the Avengers. They were the ones to fetch him from his ‘room’, standing outside the bathroom and Rogers had even taken him to some sort of meeting, keeping Tony pinned to a chair in a corner, mouth gagged when he wouldn’t stop talking or disturbing the meeting. There was simply no time that Tony was alone enough to slip away more than two feet.
The prisoners, however, were another matter. Tony recognised both of them instantly... The first cell held Loki, though his eyes were unseeing, his once vibrant green eyes faded into a dull, almost murky green, black thread interwoven along his lips that had long since healed over and his wrists encased in a steel metal that looked similar to the band around Tony's bicep. As Tony stepped up to the thick windows, Loki give no indication of knowing that anyone was there, as he just sat there, straight backed as he stared unseeingly at the furthest wall. He didn't move. He didn't even twitch.
The man lowered his head slightly in regret and defeat, answering back with a barely audible, "Barton and Romanoff.” from behind the thick glass.
Rogers breathed deeply as he calmed himself, eyes bright with twisted mirth, his eyes only for Tony, "'Save me from myself'," he shook his head and chuckled, "Only you would think that I would need saving." he suddenly changed, all laughter and humour gone and his eyes went dead as he stared down at Tony, face stony and expressionless, "I don't need saving, Tony, I just need you." and with that, Rogers swiftly brought Tony forward, planting his lips firmly over Tony's closed mouth, only to open when Rogers hand gripped the hair at the back of his head - ripping a few strands out while he did so - and yanked Tony's head back, shocking him. Almost immediately, Rogers dived in with his tongue, stealing the air from Tony's lungs as he claimed every inch of his mouth. It was disgusting.
It must have been... about a week, maybe? Tony didn't know for certain, his sense of time having been butchered with how long he'd been there. In the darkness and blistering heat of the room, blood dripping down his arm that was uselessly pinned to his side.
Tony didn't even get the chance begin to regret his actions as pain exploded across his cheek, the force sending his head to the side and to smash into the high backed hair, rattling his brain. Feeling dizzy, Tony could only blink up at the Captain, before he came to, baring his teeth at the cruel man and wincing slightly at the blossoming pain in his cheek.
Immediately, Bruce made his way over, a pleased smile on his face as he looked up to his worried team mates, "We've pinpointed his location. We're one step closer to getting Tony back, guys!" electing a cheer from everyone at the good news. "We're coming, Tony." Bruce whispered to himself determinedly. He would bring his friend home. No matter the leaps and bounds he had to commit in doing so.
At the moment, he was sat upright on a kitchen stool that had been securely bolted to the floor. His ankles were shackled to the pole, the small slack of chain clicking quietly with every movement. His hands were another matter as they were forced into a pair of built in cuffs that forced his shoulders back in an uncomfortable way.
The five inch thick door that Tony had only been able to open from the outside slammed shut faster than the eye could blink with a low hiss of air and a loud clunk of it sealing back into place, trapping Tony and Loki within the glass walls of the prison, with no way out.
Panting and every other second or so, trying in vain to shake off Barton’s hold, Tony was kept perfectly still as Steve came closer to him, close enough that Tony could feel the man’s breath on his cheek. At this close proximity, Tony could see some specks of red blood that had landed on the Dark Captain’s face from beating the kid to a bloody pulp. Distantly, Tony was aware of Romanov standing up and dragging the body out of the room, leaving a trail of blood behind her.
So sorry for this! I know this must be the latest update in the history of updates but I’ve been busy with life and I couldn’t get myself to find the will to carry on writing this for a while. I kind of fell into a writer’s depression or ‘Writer’s Block’ as it’s more commonly known as. With college added on top of that, everything was manic for a bit.
However, before he left and locked the room, Thor secured the man’s wrists and ankles to the corners of the king-seized bed with steel reinforced, adjustable shackles (they had been created with the help of Thor’s magic, making it so the steel cuffs would enlarge and tighten without any weak points), his body pulled taunt under the thick coverers. They loved Tony but they weren’t stupid enough to let him roam free and possibly get his hands on the many cameras around the room (they knew all about Afghanistan).
He didn't notice the minute trembling of his form until Coulson's large hand rested on it, making Tony flinch slightly from the sudden touch. But the appendage held strong and firm in a gentle and comforting way.
Blurry eyes opened cautiously, the pain of the whiteness of the room and lights diminishing as he begrudgingly got used to them. For a moment, his mind felt blank, sluggish in thought and movement as the pain continued to throb in his head, though it had ebbed slightly in the time he had tried to wake himself up. He couldn't remember where he was, why he was hurt and in pain, or what that drumming was, because he knew now for certain that the repetitive noise was not his head... What he did know, was that he probably, most definitely, had a concussion. God, Steve was going to be so mad that Tony would have to skip out on training again...
It had been a hard time without his good friend Antony. The Man of Iron had been intelligent, with an interest that had Thor recalling old battle stories and adventures in far off lands and different Realms, the man taking in everything he could while others would just ignore them. He knew that everyone else on the team had loved Tony for different things, whether it was for his non judgemental attitude, or his jokes and bold personality, or just the fact that he was willing to overlook their collective problems and see the best in them even when it dwindled at best.
In no time at all, Tony felt the door finally unlock and his breath caught in his throat, his heart suddenly attempting to hummer through his chest and his Reactor as he cautiously opened the door. Sticking his head out, Tony carefully analysed the empty hallway, looking for threats and ignoring the twisted and distorted shadows that were attempting to scare him back into the room.
The spy rolled her eyes at him but was clearly amused, making Tony give the first real laugh since he’d gotten into this mess— it was small and weak in amusement but it was genuine.
Blood boiled deeply in his veins as he looked at the evil bastard with cold brown eyes narrowed and hate rising in his chest; never had Tony hated someone as much as he hated Rogers, right now. That smug expression on his lips, that holier-than-thou body language, the patronising speech, those too dark blue eyes that made Tony hate him all the more. And with this hatred pumping in his blood and filling his very core, Tony leaned forward as far as he could with the restraints and hissed with poisonous words, "When I get out of here, I'm going to enjoy killing you as slowly and painfully as you've killed my friends in this world. And when I'm done, I'm going to laugh. I can promise you that."
"I'm sorry, Tones. Really I am," Rogers started, breath slightly short-winded as he spoke, making him sound even more crazy, then his eyes turned hard and unyielding, "But if we can't have you, then neither can they."
"While Doctor Banner is a commendable scientist and was a genius in his own field of gamma radiation and biology, he was never a genius in mechanical sciences. There are many faults in his device and he has come little ways to improve this particular device." he stated, before he lifted up his sleeve to reveal the large markings that resembled the barbed needles in the same place that Tony's were. He then looked down at his own tin-foil-wrapped band of his and made a mental note to ask Agent what he'd used to render it useless later.
This gave the stoic agent pause, his knife poised on the last rope that was around Tony, the genius having to ignore the tingling sensation that shot up and down his arm, bordering on painful. "Threw the vents. No, I'm not evil. And I'm getting you out." he stated with the finality that reminded Tony purely of Phil Coulson - monotoned, deadpanned, 'I'll watch
"You're going to regret that." was all Tony heard before a blinding pain emitted from the left side of his face, smacking his head roughly to the side, but as his head whipped to the side, he suddenly felt like he was chocking, the too tight collar pressing on his airways. Before he could even begin to recover, another fist that felt like steel came round the other way, smacking his head to the opposite side. His brain rattled painfully at the rough treatment, but Tony couldn't even get another word out before more pain exploded from his face.
Instead of getting the shower that he so desperately wanted, Tony was stuck, tied up on the bed, counting the seconds until Thor inevitably came and carried him somewhere else. Thor would probably let him have a shower, if Tony asked him somewhat politely. Thor, in this world, was nicer than the others. While Tony preferred the Thor of his own world, loud and brash with a story at his lips and always looking at Tony like a kicked puppy whenever he had to go down to the lab with a broken toaster, begging for Tony to fix it. In this world that he was stuck in, Thor was more stoic and silent, softly spoken and seeming to see everything around him. His blue eyes were dimmer, his smile rarer but nonetheless brighter when it did appear, and he wore his hair slightly shorter, his blonde hair only reaching his chin, the style being more human, than the curtained hair that brushed his broad shoulders in his own world.
"It seems like when their Tony died, no one else was smart enough to uphold the coding and such when it when wrong... I don't think JARVIS is here anymore either..." he trailed off sadly, knowing that the death of JARVIS in this world would have broken their Tony’s heart. They all knew that the AI was like a son to him, no matter how hard he tried to hide it or cover it up - all of his creations were like a family member he never had.
Soon, Loki was totally weightless and Tony could only carefully set the man down, making sure that he was still breathing, before he was turning his wide scared eyes to Coulson, who was standing outside with Bucky beside him, luckily having got out of their cage before it sealed them in as well. As they stared at one another, Tony could see the expression in the Agent's eyes - regret, sorrow, pity - and Tony knew what the Agent was going to do, what the Agent had to do. With the loud alarms and the flashing chaos about the room, Tony watched the Agent and he felt like shouting at the man, felt like pulling at his hair in the utter despair that he felt, felt like falling to his knees and sobbing his heart out. His hope effortlessly crushed in the span of milliseconds. And and much as Tony wanted to beg the Agent not to leave him behind, terrified of the new lengths of punishments Rogers and the team would think up for him due to another failed escape attempt, but he didn't. How could he? Phil had risked just as much as Tony in trying to free him of the jagged clutches of the psychotic team. Never looking away from one another's eyes, no words were spoken between them, before Tony nodded his head once, resignation clear in his honey-brown eyes.
Phil didn't turn around to face him as he crawled through the vents that spoke of experience that the usually sharp-suited agent didn't look like he had, "Thor broke the toaster again so he'll spend a little time panicking about that," at that, Tony was struck once again by how similar that statement was to his own world, where his Thor would have done the exact same thing, "Barton doesn't go into the vents anymore, not since you were killed in this world." Tony decided not to ask how the hell the former Agent found out about Tony being held captive here and that he was from another world, he was sure he'd get a cryptic response if he asked...
Suddenly, a large grin uncovered the dark Captain's pearly white teeth, far too many teeth, and he barked out a darkly amused laugh. His grip on his jaw moving to clasp the back of Tony's head, brushing at the hair on his nape with his fingers, making Tony want to duck under the appendage, but he didn't dare move. The laughter lasted a minute at most, that being the only thing to fill in the silence of the room, the others still absolutely silent; it unnerved Tony, sending a cold shiver up his spine as he got a full ear of Rogers' twisted laughter.
Immediately, he was assaulted by too bright lights that made his eyes water even when he shut them safely behind dark eyelids. Then he moved his head back and shifted in his seat, unable to contain a groan of anguish as a vicious spike of pain flashed over his whole body, making his frayed nerve-endings come to life. What the hell happened?
He had felt so much rage that day, that he went on a killing spree. He killed all those who spoke ill of him, saying his name like he was a poison on their lips. Most were reporters and one he took great joy in silencing. A pretty lady of Midgard spoke like the acidic venom of a snake, went by the name Christine Everhart. The woman had been most vile, saying that Antony was a selfish hero and hardly deserved to be called one at all. He had savoured the fear on the maidens face, blubbering and promising not to say anything more; he’d eased her worries, placing gentle hands on her head before sneering in disgust and snapping her neck. Honestly, Thor was glad to be rid of her.
Tony wanted to scream, but had to settle for the next best thing as he screamed a mix string of curses and denials in his mind, the loud exclamations banging wildly against his mental walls. He didn't even realise he was thrashing against his restraints until he felt the sickening feel of his own blood rolling down his wrists from where the delicate flesh had been cut by the cold unrelenting metal.
In his bed room, Tony was restrained in all different ways, bound to the bed at all corners, hands bound behind his back, bound at his front, legs free, hog-tied, the list went on and on. But, most importantly, Tony was left alone in the dark room. From what he’s seen of the simple, blank room, there was nothing in there other than a soft double bed and the restraints in the draw at his bedside cabinet. There was no other doors other than the one that he leaves and enters through, no technology that he could mess around with, no clocks or even a light switch or plug sockets inside the room, four smooth white walls circling in tauntingly. There were no windows, or weapons lying about, and there was also no cameras in the high or low corners of the room, the team obviously thinking that no technology was better than watching Tony sleep (that was a plus in Tony’s eyes).
Grabbing the man's waist from behind, Tony used all of his strength, that he got from lifting engines and heavy metal, to fling the man out of the danger zone, shouting for him to shut it down. However, before Tony could run himself out of danger as well, the strengthening gravity tugging at his clothes, a piece of lab equipment, not bolted down for some reason, flew at him, hitting Tony square in the chest and with enough force to knock him backwards.
The room was carefully stripped for Tony’s continued containment. If he were to investigate more, Tony would have to escape his restraints in the night (somehow) and take a look about before putting it all away in exactly the same place and with no idea when his captors would check in on him; Thor, in particular, had taken to random late night checks, in that time, he would talk to Tony about Loki and the home that he would one day be king of when his father finally dropped dead.
By the time they had killed the whole of the evil Avengers, Clint had nearly died by his own counter part's hand and Bruce was nearly electrocuted to death by the counterpart of Thor. It was indescribably scary to see their mirror images, eyes crazed and deranged - absolutely deadly in their frayed mental status... Now, bloodied, hurt and more than a little mentally scarred, the team watched as the rest of the goons fled for their lives as soon as the last dark avenger had fallen, looking more than a little relieved. One had even breathed out a weak and shaky 'thank you' before they turned tail and fled. That act spoke volumes of how bad this universe had turned out to be...
Sue, the Invisible Woman, was a sweet heart and Tony got along with the woman swimmingly, he'd already made a coffee date with the woman (of course, after Tony said that he wasn't looking for a relationship of any kind after his messy breakup with Pepper; they were still friends but they were trying to get passed the awkward stage) and Johnny was a hoot and a half, his powers spiking Tony's curiosity and his sense of humour and wise cracks rivalling Tony's own. The Big Man, Ben, wasn't really talkative but Tony respected the man, nodding at him in greeting which the man returned when they first met. In other words, Tony got on fine with the rest of the team; except for Reed...
But as Tony caught those two blasted names, he quickly understood what had happened and the injuries to the other man made a lot more sense.
Just as Rogers turned the dial, setting the voltage low due to the fact Tony was a normal human and wouldn't survive a powerful shock as Bucky without sustaining a massive amount of brain damage. Tony looked Phil in the eyes and gave one last nod. That nod told the Agent many things, a farewell, an acknowledgement that it was alright... Forgiveness.
“Stop! Stop it!! He didn’t do anything wrong!” Tony screamed, tears threatening to spill at what he so desperately wanted to stop.
With that, he walked to Richards to discuss what they could do to send him back and if there was a risk with him being here, missing the action of Bruce turning to Steve with pleading eyes and a slight nod from the Captain.
"Richards, don't you think we should take this somewhere else? Like somewhere out in the desert?" Tony asked forcefully from the computer screen (why isn't it a holo-screen?) as Reed practically danced around the machine that Tony had helped solder together, doing small (pointless) tweaks to the machine as he went.
But his pleads for mercy seemed to fall on deaf ears as Thor stepped off to the side, arms folded as he observed the two, and Banner picked something up before he came back. Banner shook his head regretfully, disappointment shining through his brown eyes as they set on Tony, "I'm sorry Tony, but if this stops you from trying to run away, then I have to do this."
Tony hated it. Hated the relief that filled him whenever he saw one of his insane captors and not the lackeys that treated him like a dangerous pet. Tony hated the hope that he got from seeing the blonde with a killer's eyes - someone that he should loathe and hate for keeping him in this cage - knowing that if the man before him forgave him, he could escape the darkness that was slowly driving him insane with warm food and coffee, warm bodies, and laughter all about him. Tony wanted that back, something that his captors had once supplied, than have to dwell in this cruel darkness and silence one more day.
However, before Tony could say anything more, the man jumped at the switch, pressing it down and activating it. The air came alive with electricity, raising the hairs on the back of Tony's neck as the machine spiked. Lightening flashed out the the machine, a colour of purple swirling and forming in the middle of it, gaining more and more force as the seconds went by, a pull of gravity coming from inside it. With wide eyes, Tony ran to Richards who was barely keeping ahold of the side of his desk, feet slipping along the shiny floor with his non-grippable shoes.
Shaking his head, Tony cried out in pain into Rogers mouth as the dark Captain viciously twisted the strands of his hair.
When he'd become completely immobile, panting for breath as he spent the last of his energy, that he didn't have much of, squirming in place, both Bruce and Thor looked down upon him, a saddened resolve in their eyes showing that whatever they were about to do to Tony was not good in the slightest bit.
"Yes, Stark," the man ground out, almost spitting Tony's name out like he hated it, "I know what I'm doing as it is
"Look at me!" Rogers roared, spittle flying from his mouth as his hand gripped at Tony's chin harshly enough to leave bruises. He gave an extra vicious squeeze of his jaw, making tears come to Tony's eyes at the agonisingly slow increase of pain, the man taking obvious glee in Tony's current predicament. Relief flooded the genius' system when Rogers relaxed his grip slightly, but tensed up again when the Captain's face was suddenly too close, noses millimetres apart as his stare bored into Tony's honey brown eyes. When Tony attempted to pull away, the Captain's hand on his jaw squeezed, making him wince at the pain, before Rogers eased up again. A warning. "Why, Tony?"
while you twitch and spasm in the corner' Phil Coulson - before he cut away the last of the rope, letting Tony's numb arm fall limply to his side. While the Agent was all the same with his mannerisms, he wasn't exactly how Tony remembered him either - his traditional dark custom-made sharply-cut suit was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he was dressed in a thread-bare t-shirt and ratty old black jeans, a beaten up gun holster at his side with an older modelled gun, with a few kitchen knives on his person - Tony would have though that the Agent would have worn armour, or a padded vest too, if he had any access to one. His hair was slightly longer than the professional buzz-cut that he usually sported - not that it was down to his shoulders either but it was still a few centimetres too long to how Tony remembered him.
As Tony followed Phil through the vents, ignoring the pains on his arm and ribs, lines of ugly bruising from the tight ropes around him starting to appear, his not-yet-healed bicep twinging with pain at every movement. In silence, Tony wondered who else that team had captured and held hostage in an effort to keep their loved ones close. Coulson seemed to have been subjected to the same things that Tony had been (which would explain the already fixed restrains that were all over the place) and he wondered who else had fit into the category of 'too loved' for the dark avengers of this world. Coulson held a special place in Clint and Natasha's hearts back in his world. But Tony couldn't think of who else would be part of their little group. Tony would have thought of Bucky, Steve's long-life friend, but he had been apart of HYDRA and if the team of this world had ruined HYDRA in the most horrid way that they claimed to have done, was it possible that they had unknowingly killed Bucky in the process? Or did he escape like Phil had?
Shaking off his thoughts, Tony stated, in a voice that was more confident than he felt, "Don't worry. We'll get out of here. My team will come and I know they'll free everyone along the way-"
Acting like a man that was close to the drug that he was addicted to, Tony started to claw at the finely stitched mattress with his blunt finger nails, hoping against hope that he could do this without being caught. For what felt like hours, that was probably only a few minutes, Tony finally freed some of the stitches in the mattress before violently ripping through the fabric to get to his prize inside.
Then he leaned back, hard digits still hurting Tony's jaw. Glaring fiercely, Tony's opened his mouth to reply, despite his better judgment, when the twisted man surged forward, crashing their lips together. Pose rigid with shock, Tony could only stare wide eyed as the man that wore his friend's face kissed him, never breaking eye contact as the imposing super soldier penetrated his soul, completely wrecking it in a way that Tony never thought anyone could do before. Then there was a tongue in his mouth, invading and possessive in its claim - that was when Tony snapped out of his shock.
Not a few minutes later, Coulson was opening up another vent, stealthily easing his way through the hole and down on the ground below. Without hesitation, Tony followed down, though he was less graceful and not at all silent, it wasn't like the whole building heard him so he smiled through the painful skyrocketing of his frantically beating heart, as to make the Agent roll his eyes at him. Which he did. However, Tony's faux mirth was easily overridden when he looked about the room they were in.
"Deep breaths, Tony," the strong voice commanded, "Like me." and to demonstrate the ex-agent of SHIELD started to breath in deeply, holding it before letting it out - in for five seconds, hold for six, out for seven - and they repeated it until Tony could breath normally, his previous frozen panic melting away to allow him movement once again. "I need you to be with me, Tony. We cannot get caught. I can't stress this enough and I can't be sure of what they'd do if they saw either of us trying to escape." he shook his head, looking troubled.
At first, he had tried pushing them away, being cold and distant as well as spending as much time away from them as possible delayed their quickly forming friendship. However, it became near impossible when they moved into his Tower and he had no choice but he give them a home, protection and equipment to fight with... And he may have secretly done a few personal things for them that he observed. He found that Natasha had a hobby of ballet so he took her to see a show, and that Clint had a love for high places and so built him an extreme climbing-frame. Building Steve half a dozen indestructible punching bags was an easy enough thing to do and it would have cost more if Tony just kept on buying regular punching bags so Tony considered that a win-win for him. He felt a little sympathetic towards Thor as he was unable to get intoxicated on Midgardian alcohols so he just made his own alcoholic drink for the god (which worked) it was nothing special. Bruce was epic and Tony would have done anything for his Science Bro so making sure the kitchen was stocked with absolutely everything was no biggie on Tony’s part (he was a billionaire after all).
