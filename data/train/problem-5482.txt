Now though, there was a big wet nose all in his business trying to sniff out where the pain was coming from. And none of the members of his pack seemed happy with how close his teeth were to Dean’s everything, which would have been reassuring in any other circumstance, but not so much here and now.
He was also wondering why he kissed him back, not wanting to ever let go, and why his face hurt from the grin taking over his face once they pulled apart to breathe.
Dean stares, and blinks, and gets angry. His blood boiling now as he thinks of all he has seen since he woke up in that damn casket. “Some angel you are. You burned out that poor woman's eyes.”
“Oh no you don’t, big guy.” With all the strength he could master, Dean fisted his hands onto tuffs of fur and pulled him back. As expected it did absolutely nothing, but make him feel even more tired as Cas didn’t budge even an inch. The message went through to his thick skull though, as he stopped moving forward. “Stay.”
Dean was drunk. Sam was pissed. And all was back to how it’s supposed to be. He brought his almost empty bottle up in a toast to no one as he sat on the floor of their motel room, empty aside from himself, because of course Sam can’t look at him anymore without feeling guilty. “Cheers.” He downed the rest of the whiskey and let the bottle fall to the ground. “See you in a year you son of a bitch.”
He still brought both of his hands up as he dodged another knife. “Bobby, it’s me!”
Not when he watched his own kind hearted father kill creatures that came straight out of his nightmares with pure rage in his eyes. Not when he has to watch him drink himself unconscious every night as he traces the letters on his forearm with an uncoordinated touch while he lies awake in yet another uncomfortable motel bed next to Sammy and pretends he’s asleep.
The moment his nose picked up familiar scents of home Dean felt like he could howl in relief.
Dean was about to casually mention the janitors closet again when he almost ran into someone, only to turn around and see that it was a familiar someone. “Hey Sammy, how was that test?”
Here he is though, stupid and broken and hopeful.
“I know. I’m still asking.”
“Please.” The word was said softly and Dean had to close his eyes so he doesn’t do something stupid like turn around.
However that room was just replaced by another one once collage started. Not really having anywhere else to go.
Turning his attention back to the wolf in front of him, Dean knew the second that he found the wound on his leg because he growled at it. As if growling at a gaping wound will make it stop bleeding. As if he can just fight it like he fights everything that threatens Dean’s life.
Which was exactly what the problem was.
Still, he loved his nanny a lot, so he never said a word.
But then the angels started to fall and it all went to shit. Again.
Dean continued talking until his throat went dry and the sun started shinning dimly through the curtains. It started with Sam, but it turned towards himself after a while, so he talked about the nightmares and the murders. Talked about all the things he has done and how he is too selfish to let things go. Even when he knows he doesn’t deserve them.
They traveled for years. Hunting monsters, taking care of Sammy and worrying if this will be the day that his dad drinks himself to death.  They traveled and killed and Dean learned not to vomit anymore. He learned how to cook for his baby brother with just a few cents to their name and no idea when John will come back, or if he ever will. Dean learned how to cut out a werewolves heart on his own and with his stomach being in one place. He grew and aged and hated that this is his life now; but he had to get over that. Because this is his life now. And cowards who have feelings and reminisce on the past don’t survive this life. That is a luxury he doesn’t have. Not Dean. Not ever.
He wishes he could say he was surprised by the words, but he really wasn’t. “Not this again.” Rubbing a hand down his face, Dean let out a sigh. “It says nothing. Doesn’t really matter. I’m sure you have better things to do then be here anyway.“
“I know what I said.” Opening his eyes to glare felt like it took way too much effort then it should have any right to take. “We can break it later. One more day won’t make a difference.”
The next morning they didn’t talk. Barely even acknowledging each other while Dean just glared though his hangover. His eyes more then once falling on the always exposed Soulmark on Sam’s forearm and feeling like the words were personally offending him. Sometimes it felt like they were.
Yet, still it was home to him.
“Did you meet her yet?”
So really he didn’t expect to hear a soft melody coming from Dean’s side of the room when he got up to read at three in the morning. He was sure the other was asleep, but considering said boy sent him a smile over the guitar sat in his lap, it seems he was wrong.
Dean doesn’t deserve this, doesn’t deserve a second chance when they both know that he will leave again.
Sam left to live his life the way he wants to live it. What is stopping Dean from doing the same?
Castiel was wondering about a lot of things.
“You’re an assbut.” Ah yes, there was Cas, always right there to kill the moment.
No words were said in return, so he just continued on. Continued talking like the damn broke, and all those secrets brewing inside of him for days now, weeks even, clawed their way out no matter how much poison was left behind.
But he needs this. Fuck everything, he needs this, no matter how useless or pathetic that makes him sound.
Letting his hands fist into the others hair, he felt himself relax for the first time in months. Damn, did he miss this.
Dean is drinking; there are many reasons why he is drinking alone in the dark. One is because he knows God and angels and all that crap isn’t real; and yet Castiel showed him his fucking wings. Another is because of course this is who his soulmate is; he doesn’t even have to take the arm guard off to know what he will see there and to know that is exactly what he heard yesterday. But the thing, Castiel, the angel, whatever, didn’t say anything about that at all. Like it didn’t matter. Like it wasn’t a big deal.
Something bitter settled over him a little later as he stood under the spray of water in the shower and stared at his own words. Have a pen? Dean almost wanted to laugh at how fucking normal the words were. Of course Sammy got something normal. Of course he wasn’t fucked over like Dean himself has been; over and over again.
Watching the man who has once smiled every day break as he did, made him never want to put himself in that position. Nothing is worth that pain visible in every breath that his dad takes. No one is.
Lets it go.
It was then that he started wondering, as he watched the kids from his class talk about brothers and sisters and parents, he started wondering what really was family.
He should probably make a copy of that key too. Just in case.
A cup of something steaming hot and smelling too much like herbs was being pressed against his arm before he had the time to even think about getting up and leaving like he should have done already.
Now, as he sat there Dean let his face fall onto his hands, head feeling heavy and mind too jumbled up to deal with any of it.
From one town to the next  Dean managed to steal an arm guard; shrugging his shoulders when Sam asked him why. John never asked.
He drank and drank and drank, feeling the Soulmark as if it was burning his skin all the way to the bone, and knowing exactly what he was going to do. Knowing what he must have known deep down since the damn morning the cursed thing showed up. Dean threw the bottle at the wall and laughed because of course this is how it all goes to hell. A bit more literally then he was ready for at the moment, if he was honest with himself. But was there ever any other choice? No.
It was Sam who wanted out. It was Sam who got out, and he was supposed to stay. Sammy leaves for some big shot collage gig and he stays to clean up the mess. That’s how it was supposed to go.
After all, there is no one else in his life that would have listened.
“Sammy left.” It was whispered against warm skin in the dark of the night. He doesn’t think he would have been after to get the words out otherwise.
Filling up the gas is fast. Deciding what to do next is not.
It was only a second. Dean allowed himself only one second to take in the scene before him; his pack, his family, fully shifted and ready for a fight, ready to tear apart the wild wolf that chased Dean out of the woods. Because of course no one was growling at him, if he hadn’t been on fight or flight mode for so long that would have occurred to him right away, but it has been so long. It feels like it has been months since the last time he allowed himself to be human, even longer since he allowed himself to feel safe.
Dean showed Castiel the meaning of home with big smiles and warm hands, cheerful laughs and pictures of the two plastered up on the wall.
Dean started sleeping around. He started sleeping with anyone who would have him just to show everyone that he doesn’t care about the damn Soulmark. It doesn’t matter what it says because he has no intention of meeting the person on the other end of it. So he started flirting and sleeping with various girls he would meet as they pass though town.
Family was butlers and nannies. The young women with sweet smiles and soft voices that woke him up in the morning, got him ready for school, read him a bedtime story. The men who cleaned after him and scolded him for knocking down vases of flowers.
Sam left.
It was in that moment that the thought of family crumbled completely. Because it doesn’t exist.
There was only one thing that could make him snap out of it now. Dean knows it, has done it before; but this was different. His pack was right there, they were watching. But did he really have a choice?
Cas’s body was still as taunt as a bow string, but he let Dean do whatever he wanted. Just like he always did. It stopped being weird weeks ago. Somewhere between the running and the fighting for their lives, their mutual codependence became just a thing that was.
The thought is bitter and makes bile rise up even though he knows the only thing he has actually eaten the past three days has been a piece of pie at one of the diners. And he doesn’t even know how long ago that was.
“Don’t be such a spoil sport.” He was walking backwards now, making sure to turn his smile to one hundred because that’s what always works. “I know you want to.” Dean wiggled his eyebrows and the frown deepened.
“Good.”
He thought so because you’re his soulmate; Dean’s brain adds on, only to be ignored because Dean sure as hell isn’t ready to process that particular piece of information. Instead he asks about the body, and the why. He really needs to know why. He needs to hear it from it’s damn mouth, because no, good things don’t happen to Dean Winchester. Prime example of that is standing right in front of him and staring like it could go on doing it for forever. The answer he got was not one he expected to hear though.
After a while even Cas stopped cornering him; but he still looked at him sometimes like he wanted to rip the truth out of him with the power of will.
There was no time to think, just to act, which is how the man found himself standing on two feet again, stumbling forward on uneasy legs as if he forgot how to use them. One of them was still torn open and bleeding; Dean could feel it even more now that he had to actually put his weight on it.
Unable to form coherent words, Dean just pulled the other into another kiss, wrapping his legs around the teen’s hips.
The first row of wolves in front of them leaned forward as if to attack, it was subtle, but it was enough to throw Dean into a panic. Sammy was among them. He can’t let him get hurt.
Apparently, it’s one thing to decide to be selfish, to stay, and a whole other to actually say the words. He was never allowed to be selfish after all. He still isn’t.
Like everything else complicated in Dean’s life, the man ignored it.
“That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong.”
The sound of growling still filled the silence around them, but at least it was from only one source now. Good. That was good.
The little voice in the back of his head saying that maybe he wants a Cas was ignored as it always was. If there was one thing Dean was good at, it was living in denial. And he ain’t gonna stop now.
It didn’t matter much since he was late for his own class anyway. Might as well go since Cas made it very clear that there will be no more anything if he doesn’t get his grades up. Which was a stupid rule, but he should probably try if he wants to kiss him again anytime soon. And damn does he want to.
Still, he smiled, greeting the newcomers warmly just like he was taught to. Giving a hug to his parents once they were home and waving with a small smile when they went away.
“Dean.” This wasn’t the ‘I'm going to smite you voice’; this was soft, almost a whisper. Cas was in his personal space again, and his hand was on Dean’s shoulder, but he will be damned if he actually turns around. Instead he opens his third beer of the night and takes another to go.
Cas must have felt the same way since Dean barely made it to the bed before a gravelly voice spoke into the stifling silence surrounding them. “How is your leg?”
What was he doing anyway?
“Thanks, Sammy.” The relief washing over him made a smile tug at his lips, but Sam still frowned when he looked his way again.
The teen felt a shiver run down his spine, even as he walked towards it, phone already in hand and text sending out just as his feet hit the familiar flowerbed. It may be dark, but Dean knows the path by heart after so long.
“Uncomfortable? You are already doing that.”
“Well, thanks a lot for the angelic assistance. You know, I almost got my heart ripped out of my chest.”
“No, you are. And I need you to promise me not to move it.” Their eyes met now and he knew this was the one thing he is not backing down from. Some things are better off not being seen, and his Soulmark was definitely one of them.
“God, Dean. You are magnificent.” Cas whispered against his skin as he opened him up in the back seat, hitting right there with every bend of long fingers, effectively turning Dean into a moaning mess.
Tired. That’s what he was. He was just so very tired.
“And your guard dog?” His words were tense, eyes flashing red for a moment as he looked at the wolf in question.
However, that’s when Cas comes back and he is alive and all is good; except it’s not because all he wants to do is bring Cas into a hug and not let go for a long time. But he can’t do that. He ain’t Cas’s soulmate. Cas is just his and he wouldn’t understand any of it even if Dean tried to explain. Which he of course doesn’t. He doesn’t want a soulmate anyway. So he only hugs him for a second before letting go and then sneaks off to drink the first moment that he can.
It was so ridiculously Cas that Dean found himself laughing despite the situation that they were in.
Dean met Sammy’s eyes over the top of the others head, he was human now too, looking so confused that Dean knew that there will be many questions later.
“I dragged you out of Hell. I can throw you back in.”
“You made an exception for me.” Dean is not meeting his eyes as he speaks. It’s quiet around them and it’s making him want to whisper but he doesn’t. He stands his ground as their eyes meet and Cas hesitates.
“You’re staying.” It wasn’t a question. Cas knew him well enough to read between the lines. Sometimes, Dean thinks that he knows him better then he knows himself.
“What happened?” There it was. The start of questions that can’t be answered.
It takes a moment to find his voice and thankfully it doesn’t waver like he feared it would. “The hell you are!” The anger has always been there; anger at his Soulmark, at his soulmate; and this thing is just staring at him with damn blue eyes like it doesn’t even need to blink. He channels it all now and plunges the demon knife into it’s chest with as much force as he has, feeling relief when he sees it sink.
“Doubtful.” It was yelled back without even turning around, which just put the grin back to his face. Seeing it made Sammy groan and continue walking towards his own class without much more then “It was good” and “See ya.”
If he could have smiled without a grimace he would have. Instead he just passed his fingers through thick fur again before inclining his head towards where his pack still stood. “Come on. Let’s go show them that you won’t kill anyone so I can go find a place to pass out.”
But then demons come, and of course it was a demon that got him out. What the fuck else would be strong enough, but a damn demon. The itch that’s been under his skin since he got out just got worse at the though. Figures, Dean Winchester; soulmate of a demon. He would have scoffed if Sam and Bobby weren’t there.
He needs this. He needs Cas.
It’s safe to say that one thing he dreaded is having a new roommate.
Breathing still labored from having to dig himself out, he did a quick check of himself to make sure everything was in place. Arms, legs, head, arm guard.
Cas honest to god frowned at him for a good few seconds, before ducking under his arm and walking away. In the opposite direction from the janitors closet, of course.
Dean knew it was no one’s fault but his own, but stood his ground anyway. No matter how shaky it may be.
It changed as he found himself in a new town and a new school. One that had dorms attached to it. One that will become Castiel’s new home.
Maybe he has. Maybe he lost his mind months ago.
He said nothing though, and just passed by the man to actually enter the house.
He passed another bar in a blur, not even pretending to glance at this one. He just needs to ride this out a bit more and then he will go back and deal with the consequences.
“Dean!”
His mom and dad.
Dean didn’t let himself face plant into the body under him, as much as it just happened. Adrenaline and exhaustion fighting over who gets to rule over him with no regard to the situation that he was in. Because of course.
Cas was human and he was sitting on their couch, in a pair of Dean’s own sweat pants and a shirt. He was sitting there and looking at his arm with that weird little confused look on his face, that Dean didn’t even have to see to know it was there. He was right there and the man wanted to throw up.
Yes, that would go by real well.
Still, the man stayed sitting down, not running out like Dean was sure he would. And he is so pathetic because all it did was make him want to disappear all over again or never leave at all. He walked out of all of this and yet, there he was; willing to deal with all his bullshit even after everything.
On any other day Dean would have been embarrassed by how he stumbled and fell onto the black wolfs side, clutching onto his fur in order not to fall down; but his leg hurt damnit, and there was no time for that.
The man and woman who would walk into his life with smiles and presents only to leave again the second day.
The feel and smell of wet fur hit Dean like a brick wall as he tried to catch his breath. “You smell like wet dog.“
Of course the dick disappeared before he has a chance to, and right after telling them that ‘hey, Lilith is trying to free Lucifer and it’s up to you to stop her’ because of course it fucking is. And if Dean drinks himself to sleep again that night, well Sam sure as hell says nothing about it. He isn’t sure he wouldn’t have punched his brother if he tried.
Dean doubted it though. He was never that lucky.
Yes, his brain was definitely short circuiting now. Too much information, too much everything. “You mean the gas station and the motel. That was you talking?” For the first time since they started talking it moves as it nods. “Buddy, next time, lower the volume.”
When Dean was very little and his mom was still alive he didn’t think like that. Not as she talked with soft words and big smiles about how she knew what would be the first words out of his dads mouth when they met, years and years before it actually happened. Not when she so proudly showed off her forearm to anyone and everyone.
“This is your problem, Dean. You have no faith.” Not a waver in it’s voice, nothing. Dean was ready to argue, was about to; because the hell does that mean? Of course he doesn’t have fucking faith. The way he grew up, he’s lucky he has all his limbs attached. Lightning flashes then though, and from the things, Castiel’s, back, a pair of shadowy wings stretches off into the distance; disappearing again as the light goes out.
Dean could still remember waking up to that mess of hair and the feeling of combing his fingers trough it until the others eyes finally opened and a smile found itself on his face as an answer to his own. He has always been a grumpy son of a bitch in the morning, but that little pull up of the corners of his lips was for Dean to see anyway.
“You know I don’t.” And damn, there is that frown again that made Dean fall in love at the age of fifteen.
“How long can you stay?” The words were spoken against his skin still, running another shiver through Dean, for a completely different reason than before.
Sammy left and what is he supposed to do now?
Wondering why Dean’s face scrunched up whenever he was doing homework, why he stayed up with Castiel when he was obviously so tired he could barely keep his eyes open, why his eyes scrunch up when he smiled towards him but never when it was anyone else. And most importantly, wondering why the green eyed boy kissed him after Castiel complimented his playing one night
It came out breathless. He felt breathless. He doesn’t remember the last time he slept, and was so ready to pass out. Not yet though. They were not in the clear yet.
“Leave it.”
“Just this once, okay?” It was selfish, but he couldn’t stop his mouth from forming the words anyway. “Just one more time and you won’t see me ever again.”
Cas looked broken and Dean was selfish. It was always the same.
Home changed too on his fourteenth birthday, when parents didn’t come at all the year before.
Cas was still growling though, and Dean knew that the itch under his skin won’t settle until he doesn’t settle as well.
What is waiting for him there though? A drunk and pissed off John, that’s what. Sam sure as hell isn’t.
Hey, yes, it says here I’m going to hell. So I would rather not look at it.
Dean drank for three days straight.
“We can go mattress shopping tomorrow.”
“Dean…“
Castiel also didn’t expect the ‘hi’s’and ‘how are you’s’ the other gave him whenever they were together in their room. Didn’t expect he would give into Dean so easily and start answering and wondering in return.
So bare white walls and big halls were replaced by small shared rooms, walls covered in posters and floor littered with clothes.
They weren’t paying attention for just that one moment and he was gone. Just fucking gone.
“Oh come on Cas, I even stole the keys.” Keeping up with the others stride was no problem for Dean as they weaved around other students in the hallway. No one was paying them much mind even as he jiggled said keys in his hands to show them off.
Words finally find him again, as he shifts from foot to foot, and rubs a palm to the back of his neck, because Cas is looking at the check with Dean’s name on it and frowning. Always with the frowning.
Screw everything if he was going to let Sam just die.
If he wasn’t otherwise preoccupied, the teen would have laughed.
And for the first time Castiel had the warmth in his chest that wasn’t there ever before. For the first time he understood that home didn’t mean a big empty house or a house at all.
The freckled boy showed Castiel what was home the night he sneaked into his bed instead of his own.
He’s gonna need a few beers to believe it.
Dean spent the rest of the night hiding in his room and drinking himself to sleep. Of course this had to happen now. Of course it fucking did.
He still wakes up at the ass crack of dawn and makes coffee, gets a smile and a goodbye kiss for his efforts, but now he also gets in his car an hour later and goes to work, where he gets to fix things instead of break them. And he banters with the guys that do the same, because they are kind of cool to work with too. They invite Dean for beer after his shifts that he keeps declining because he saw the relief on Cas’s face when he came back from his first day of work, and it was enough to make him promise himself that he will come straight home every day. If only to never see that look on his face again.
He knows that he should say something, he should tell the other that he isn’t leaving, that he’ll stay and never hurt him like that again. He should be promising him things he never dared promise anyone before. But the words just aren’t coming out.
Oh yes, words, that’s why he’s shifted. He needs to use words.
“Promise me.” The silence was long enough where Dean opened his mouth to speak again, but Sam looked away and spoke first instead, staring at his own arm guard now.
This is such a stupid idea.
Dean braces himself and gets the demon knife, but again Bobby is the one who speaks first. “Who are you?”
He knew what he should do now. Get up and walk to the pack, to where it’s safe. Get someone to look at his leg before it gets so infected that someone needs to chop it off. Possibly pass out and sleep for a week.
He was also eight when he decided he would rather burn his own arm then get his Soulmark as he watched the vampires head roll towards him, feeling like he is going to vomit.
Then Dean came into his life. Dean with warm smiles and whispered ‘I love you’s’.
“Repunzul, Repunzul, let down your hair.” Dean teased out, barely above a whisper, just loud enough for the other to hear.
Damn it if he can even hear the car engine at all.
Yeah, he should definitely stop now and turn back.
“I didn’t get rid of it.” He wasn’t looking at Dean anymore, but at his arm as he spoke; only looking up when Dean almost choked in surprise at the next words. “I like it, so I’m keeping it.”
In the end Bobby was the one  to voice it out. “This is a bad idea.”
That was what home meant.
Some would say that in life and death situations there was no time to make jokes. Dean would argue with that, as it was obviously the best time. Especially if the one you were making fun of couldn’t understand a word coming out of your mouth.
“I’ll stay.” The words made him look away as he cleared his throat.
“Dean-” Sam’s eyes moved from him to Cas, uncertain and still afraid. Which, yeah fair. Seeing Cas at the peak of lost control is not the most reassure thing for anyone, especially if you are on the other side of his glare. Dean had plenty of time to learn that from the moment he was first thrown into that cell. Hell, if things played out differently he would have probably been dead himself.
As soon as he managed to limp his way into his own cabin, the scent of himself and of home still lingering on every surface even if a little stale, it finally felt like he can relax. It has been way too long since he let his own body relax.
Unluckily for him there is no time to have a huge angel freakout because the dead people are rising then, and time for Dean and his feelings is over again.
They have this weird ass friendship between them that Dean doesn’t know what to do with. Once, Cas has told him that he is not a hammer and that he has doubts. Then he rebelled and those doubts became something bigger as the three of them fought anything and everything that was thrown at them.
“It’s complicated.” He tried for a smile again, it didn’t pass this time. “I just need a place to crash for a few days.”
He also refused to think of what this means about his soulmate; or more importantly about what his soulmate is. Some kind of a nutjob would be the easiest answer.
But then Cas was getting up and Dean’s heart constricted painfully in his chest. He’s done it now. Time to go sleep in the car.
“S’me“ Finally he managed to get to the bed, trying to sit down but more or less falling onto it instead. The impact had him wincing before rolling around, cause damn it he was sore, and did nothing to get the worried look off of the three headed Sam. This time he did roll his eyes. “M’fie”
Yeah, Dean just wanted to crawl into a hole and die. Why does he always have to fuck everything up?
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dean was wondering how much more frowning can Cas do before he gets stuck like that. Not that it mattered much since he was cute when he frowned anyway.
Thankfully Bobby left it at that, and aside from a few glances towards the arm guard, didn’t say anything more about it. Dean wasn’t sure if he was grateful or disappointed at that, but he went with grateful. It was the safer option.
He didn’t know of course, didn’t know of the words on Dean’s arm. Didn’t know that apparently the fight isn’t over when he dies, because of course it’s not. There were a few times as months past that he thought about showing him. As Sam researched and tried seeing things that just weren’t there until he fell asleep while sitting up. Dean thought about showing him that ‘Hey. Not gone forever if this thing is right’ as he pulled the blanket over him and put the laptop and books away. But he also didn’t want to give him hope that may not exist when all is said and done.
The smile he got in return was one of the big ones, one of the ones that he remembers were just for him when they were nothing more than teenagers in love. Seeing it made the tension melt out of his shoulders that he didn’t even notice was still there.
The man’s knuckles turned white as his grip on the wheel tightened and he pushed the car to go faster.
“What has gotten into you, Dean? This isn’t you.” Sam was worried. Of course Sam was worried. Dean would have rolled his eyes if it didn’t mean him falling on the floor. As it is though, the wall’s were moving and if he didn’t lie down right now he will throw up.
It's been hours. He's been on the road for hours, but he can still hear the slamming of the door over the purr of the car engine.
It’s been two years and he is still doing the same tango. No matter how many times he tells himself he is done with that part of his life, there he is again; driving through the same roads all the way from the other side of the country. He really is pathetic.
He wasn’t, because his whole pack stood before him in wolf form, growling at him as if he didn’t belong there. As if he was a threat.
Sam left, and apparently so did Dean. Dad must be out of his mind by now.
They got Cas’s grace back.
The sound of the car door opening and a person sitting down next to him has Dean tensing, refusing to move his eyes from the stain on the car ceiling that he has been staring at for the past few minutes. He doesn’t deserve hope; he doesn’t deserve any of it. The door closed and he was left in the muffled sounds of the traffic outside and the constant pounding in his head.
He still did it three more times.
Or ever if he can help it.
“Fuck yea, man.“ In a blink, it was him pressed against the wall again. Not that Dean minded one bit as they continued to dry hump each other right there against the house of horrors.
Dean really hopes that Sammy is living the life that he wanted up there at Stanford, because he sure as hell is.
Cas is staring at him with a closed off expression, as if he is preparing himself to be punched in the face. And yea, Dean should have figured out something was up when he didn’t start inhaling food the second that it was put in front of him.
“I love you.” He was planning on just saying yes, but that works too I guess.
But with Dean, he slowly started wondering less.
“You're different.”
Oh right, the cup was still being pressed against his hand. He let his fingers wrap around it in silence with a mumbled ‘thanks’; averting his eyes to stare at the steam rather than meeting his eyes.
Feeling safe as he read. Happy. Content.
Dean was just getting confident that the words on his arm will never come true when shit hit the fan, and Sam died.
Dean takes a deep breath.
“Yes.” They held each others gaze and Dean was drowning. He was drowning and he was lost, because Cas isn’t supposed to be there. He isn’t supposed to want to.
“Then I stay.” There was a tiny nod. Determined.
Castiel doesn’t even look affected even though Dean is five second away from stabbing him again no matter how ineffective it is. “I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that.”
His name was Baltazar.
“We need a bigger apartment.” Dean let himself sit back down again.
It took only a moment for the huge black body of a wolf to pass him and stand tall between Dean and his pack. His growl louder than the rest, back tense in a way that Dean knew meant he was only a few seconds away from ripping out throats.
“Dean doesn’t like his Soulmark.” Sam chimed in from behind him, making him grit his teeth. Of course he fucking doesn’t like his Soulmark. In the kitchen a bottle was set on the counter a little too hard. What is there to like?
Dean chose to be selfish for a reason though. So, in frustration he just gets up and walks over to the front door where his jacket hangs like it belongs there, like he belongs there, and gets the latest envelop with his paycheck out of the pocket before getting back to the sight of Cas frowning at Dean’s empty chair.
It feels like a joke.
He lets his head fall onto the wheel with a soft thud, miscalculating enough that the horn blasts for a second before he readjusts with a curse. This was so stupid. He should have just stayed in that damn motel and dealt with John in the first place. It’s going to be so much worse when he gets back.
With the apocalypse looming over them he didn’t even have time to think about the Soulmark still hidden on his arm. It’s not like there was much to think about anyway. It’s not happening and that was it. Dean was very much fine with that.
“Spit it out, will ya!”
However, he wished he could talk so excitedly over them like his peers do. He wished that they really felt like family. But they didn’t.
Dean will take it though.
That was all Castiel had to know about him.
Fuck everything if he is going back into all of that before his own nerves calm down.
Because Baltazar was just like his family, he left.
It however, wasn’t enough to actually tell him where he goes every day. Not for the lack of trying though. Cas just doesn’t ask and Dean can’t find the right words or the perfect moments to bring it up. The words just keep getting stuck at the tip of his tongue, but never get any further than that.
“Don’t give me that look, Dean. The tea is good for you.”
Castiel always wondered what home meant, what it’s like to have a family.
They never are of course. He felt like scoffing at them at even thinking they would be.
And he was nice, if a little crude.
Hours later as he watched Sammy shove cereal in his mouth, eyes on a book he held in the other hand, Dean let himself feel the inevitable regret of leaving Cas behind once again. But he also let himself remember the ‘I love you's' that were pushed onto his skin with every touch. Let himself feel the reminder of said touch with soft presses againt the many hickeys left behind.
Dean showed him all.
Dean also remembers that it’s Friday so it’s his turn to cook dinner, and that there are grocery bags in his trunk that have icecream that will melt if he doesn’t get it home soon. And he should really get home soon because Cas will worry if he just doesn’t, won’t he? How would he feel if he just gets back to an empty apartment? How long would he wait for him this time? How many missed calls on his new phone would there be?
The car horn is loud as he punches the steering wheel, getting the attention of other people on the pumps; not that he pays it much mind anyway; just starting the car and turning back onto the highway faster than it was intended.
It wasn’t the best situation, but Dean knew it was temporary so he continued being his friend and ignored the little warmth he felt whenever he saw the former angel follow the letters on his forearm with a fond little smile that he never saw before. Maybe it was just a human thing.
A few possible things crossed his mind as he turned, but seeing black letters on Cas’s outstretched arm wasn’t one of them.
As always he only got to count until ten before the light turned on and the window above him opened, making a smile spread on his face almost involuntarily as his eyes met blue ones.
It didn’t matter that his fur was wet and matted, or that his back leg was still probably bleeding even as he ran. None of it mattered because he was home. He was finally home.
He ignored how much he misses it. No feelings for Dean.
“I-Umn-I got a job.”
That was all it took for Cas to move them both away from the house and towards where he knew Dean parked Baby. It was where he always parked her, hidden away enough in the tree line that no one can see them unless they were looking.
“Well, you’ll have to wait a hell of a long time then, buddy.” He turned to leave, but an arm on his shoulder stopped him.
“Condoms?” The other asked between kisses, seemingly head clear enough to think ahead.
The voice that made him feel like he was fifteen again.
He didn’t even have to open his eyes back up to know that there was a frown of Cas’s face, eyes firmly on him. It’s funny how much you learn about a person when he is the only one you can count on while running for your life, while trying to survive. “Come to bed, Cas.” It was getting harder and harder to fight sleep.
At least Sammy’s still alive.
He did that too. But damn everything if he can just walk away from it again. Not like this. Not today.
Of course it was Bobby again who commented on it, but Dean just shook his head as Sam walked straight into the kitchen. He didn’t comment again.
People will start dying again no matter what they do, Dean is just the unlucky bastard who made sure of it. He is also the unlucky bastard who keeps seeing blue whenever he closes his eyes.
He still doesn’t move though. Hope is a bitch like that. Sometimes it sneaks up on you even though you know better than to trust it. It should have been too long for any hope, he shouldn’t even feel hope. It’s stupid. The whole thing was stupid in the first place, let alone after six years.
He wants to go home.
“You are.” Dean stopped breathing at the sureness of the others voice as he said it. As if it was that simple. As if Dean didn’t watch people run themselves into the ground because of this his whole life. “I’ll stay, as long as you want me to.”
Seeing the kid roll his eyes at the name made him stop walking, but it didn’t stop the other, who just continued power walking on. “See ya around Cas. I’ll get a yes out of you eventually!”
“A while ago, yes. Didn’t know how to bring it up.”
Except he wasn’t.
Dean let out a breath he didn’t notice he was holding. “Just like that?”
“You got your mojo back, Cas.” The smile on his lips was weak but it was as much as he was capable of as he was still avoiding his eyes. “Nothing keeping you here anymore.”
Waking up from a blood filled nightmare left Dean gasping and shaking on most nights. The fact that it took a week for this one to start was a small miracle, if he was going to be honest with himself. The slamming of the door still haunted his waking hours like a fucked up playlist, so of course it will follow onto his sleeping hours too. After all, why not make it a party?
Home can be a warm bed and waking up to a brown haired boy still sleeping in your arms. It can be a small room, big just enough to fit two but with an air of home none the less because Dean’s guitar is in the corner and Castiel’s hoddie slung over a chair, pictures taken on days spent together plastered everywhere.
The dorms weren’t his home so he wasn’t sad when he left his tight little room once he graduated high school.
Instead of turning back he continues on. Not having anywhere to go still, but also not letting that stop him. If Sam can turn his back on them, then he can drive cross country for a few days damn it.
“It shows the first thing your soulmate will ever say to you.” Yes; Dean thought going to take another swing but finding the bottle, to his dismay, empty instead as Sam explained in his patient voice; It also brings pain and suffering. Sam’s glare from across the room was enough to not say it out loud though.
That was a good thing though. Finding out you’re going to hell, probably more literally then anyone else would think possible, wasn’t something he was happy sharing with anyone else.
“That’s not what I want.”
Cas is still smiling as he talks about this one kid at the school that has been giving him trouble, and he lets Dean steal his fries even though he still has some on his own plate, like he always does. And Dean is happy to just be here right now, even though he knows that Cas will push for a cat eventually, and the new place will definitely have a wall length bookshelf or two.
So, here he was now. Sitting on a couch, in an unfamiliar apartment that just felt so much like Cas that it was painful to even look around; and he didn’t know what to do with his hands.
“I’ll lock him up with me. He won’t be a threat to the pack.“ He let himself look at the rest of the crowd still surrounding him now. “And if anyone even thinks about attacking him,” Dean’s voice boomed louder “they will answer to me.”
That was all it took for a warm body to be pressed against him, as he let sleep take him willingly for the first time in a long time.
He didn’t understand why the people who he didn’t know are family, but the nanny said they are, so he believed her.
Dean has been parked for ten minutes now, his hand on the door feeling like a vice, but doing nothing more than just holding onto it.
Before, home meant the big mansion he was raised in; the cold white walls devoid of anything but a few paintings here and there, a big bed in a big room. Too big for a two year old child.
What wasn’t good, was the damn crate that he was in and the screaming and feeling like his ears were going to explode if it didn’t stop now. It stopped. Dean ran.
So close.
The wolf stepped forward, still growling, still very much ready for a fight; reminding Dean that he wasn’t done yet.
Some nights he would feel an itch to take the damn guard off and read it over and over just to check if maybe he saw it wrong. Maybe it’s not a literal thing and he doesn’t go to hell. It felt like a joke. I mean, who goes to hell? Right? Sometimes he would close himself in the bathroom and actually read it. Sometimes he would cry about it. Tried to burn the words off once too, but all that did was leave him with burns on his skin and words still very much there.
Cas didn’t need to be taught. He always just knew.
It was awkward and Dean had no one to blame but himself.
“My ass!”
But then she died.
However, a year later he found out another thing he wishes he hadn’t.
And he gave him both.
So Dean drank, and slept around, and got real good at ignoring the Soulmark that felt like a real itch under his skin on some days. He made it a point to not even glance at anymore even when it was uncovered for the few minutes that it took him for a quick shower. He was still the only one to ever see it though. And he was making sure it stayed that way no matter how hot the waitress is that asks him for a peek in hopes that it’s her words there.
“What if I want you to never leave?” He was meeting his eyes again, but damn everything if seeing so much raw determination and want didn’t make him want to run and hide; and maybe drink a full bar.
The frown he got in return was so worth it.
“That’s the plan.” Dean has never said it out loud before, but he did now as the two of them sat in a noisy bar and drinking until they forget that this is their life. Downing his own drink, he let his eyes fall on the cutie to his left with a wink. She smiles and Sam rolls his eyes.
Family is the heated nights or the lazy ones. It is the ‘I love you’s’ said with a smile and kisses pressed against warm skin. It is the happiness in Dean’s eyes when he came home only to find Castiel searching for an apartment in Kansas so that Dean can be close to his family.
It would have been easier if he was a dick.
The words made him almost choke but he ended up scoffing instead. “Get the hell out of here. There's no such thing.”
He didn’t actually have to get out of the car anyway.
Because it wasn’t only for himself he was playing for anymore, he was playing for Castiel too.
The mere thought of his cabin, of his bed, his pack, was enough to push his legs to go faster. Run further despite his state of exhaustion. Dean’s ears picked up on the paws trailing after him matching his pace like they always did. No hesitation for even a second.
“Yes.” It was a lie, but Sam didn’t have to know that. No one had to know that.
The question made Sam laugh and Dean tried not to wince as he watched him clasp Cas on the shoulder. “Cas, man, even I don’t know that. He never shows it to anyone. But he has one.”
There was a towel around his waist as he stood in the middle of the bathroom, fastening the arm guard on when he heard a fluttering of wings and a “Dean.”
So what if Cas isn’t a dick, and is trying to help after all. So what if his forearm is fucking bare. It’s not like he planned to do anything about it anyway. Dean never wanted a soulmate. Actually, this is perfect. He doesn’t have to deal with the talk. There is nothing to deal with because Cas doesn’t have a Soulmark.
And if he finds a guy with a fugly jacket and blue eyes and let’s him fuck him in the dirty toilet stall; well, he isn’t going to think about that.
Looking at it.
One of the first things that Dean taught Sam was how to deal with the nightmares that followed.
No, this time…He was all alone.
He just wants out, even if just for a few days of driving, he wants to pretend none of this is happening right now. Like John didn’t yell after Sam to never come back. Pretend like Sam didn’t answer with ‘I don’t plan to’ right before slamming that damn door behind him.
Cas was there though. As Dean woke up gasping and disoriented Cas was right there, arms wrapped around him feeling like a safety blankets that he knows he doesn’t deserve.
It still hurt.
Dean was nothing, but smiles as the “Hello Dean” was whispered between the two, followed by a body pressing him against a wall and lips crushed against his own.
Turns out taking a stand was a bad idea. Dean almost fell on his ass as the door’s exploded and a man walked in. Tall, mess of black hair and a trench coat is all he manages to see before the two of them are shooting at it. The light bulbs above it’s head shatter in a shower of sparks as it passes them and Dean is scared because it isn’t even flinching at the bullets.
Of course he doesn’t have a Soulmark. Even thinking he does was stupid.He’s a damn angel; and you need a soul for a soulmark.
“Hiya Sammy.” Dean tried for nonchalant as the two of them inched forward. From the look on his brother’s face it obviously fell on deaf ears. He didn’t let that detour him though. “What did I miss?” Yea, the smile was definitely more of a grimace, he could feel it.
So with one last look at the road leading where he should be going, Dean turns the car around and goes home.
Okay, so he may have miscalculated just how easy this will be. It took some blood, salt and holy water for Bobby to finally settle down and believe him. He asked Dean how he got out. The answer of ‘I don’t know’ felt like it was burning his mouth. But it was still the truth. He didn’t actually know how he got out.
“I’m sorry.”
No, he knows the answer to that one. He is supposed to stay and hunt and keep their damn family together even though one has turned his back on the rest.
By the time that his own mark came in Dean was determined that even if he met his soulmate he will just walk away. So it only took a moment to tear his own shirt apart and tie the fabric sloppily onto his forearm to cover the words that he was too afraid to even read, as they showed up on the eve of his twelveth birthday.
More then once Dean had thought; This is it. This is the time I die. But it never happened. Even when he wanted it, in that moment of weakness; when he wanted to just die and get it over it, letting himself glance towards his arm guard for only a second; it never happened and life still moved on and continued screwing them over.
“Son of a Bitch!” The unexpected noise made him jump and almost drop the thing. As it was he just held on tighter, grit his teeth and turned around. “The hell man?”
“I need to know what your Soulmark says.”
Shoulders sagging and eyes looking tired beyond his own years, Cas was the first to look away.
Pushing Baby to her limit, Dean found himself two towns over before he was able to stop on the side of the road with shaking hands.
Punching the wall didn’t feel as good as he thought it would.
She was taken from him by a fire; a demon. And even at the age of four, seeing what it did to his dad, how it broke him, was more then enough to have him decide Soulmarks are a joke and he didn’t need a soulmate at all.
Sam is keeping an eye on him because he apparently drinks too much now. He would think that all the years spent in hell and all the days Cas has been dead are a good enough excuse to give, but it’s not like he can tell Sam that. So he just shuts his mouth and sneaks in a beer when he can.
“Well, your brother is not wrong.” With the words Cas moved so that their hips were pressed together, making them both moan as their clothed dicks grid against each other; finally giving some friction.
“It’s your Soulmark.” Sam was right there to explain because Dean sure as hell wasn’t going to. He doesn’t even know why he’s still there. He shouldn’t be here. He should just leave and come back after a good bender and no recollection of exactly how many people he slept with the night before. But no, instead he’s still sitting here as his legs refused to cooperate and get up. He needs to leave because he can’t look at the words on Cas’s arm anymore. He just can’t.
As they say, second time’s a charm.
He was a threat.
He can regret this tomorrow too.
“That’s not my name, Dean.” Bastard didn’t even look at him as he crushed his poor heart. “And put those back.”
It took no longer then twenty minutes before he was parked in front of the familiar house, taking a deep breath before stepping out. The almost mansion looked menacing in the daylight, but damn did it ever look haunted under the nights sky. All clean cut and completely white as it towered over him, as if it, like the people living inside, thought it was better than everyone else.
“You got a job?” Their eyes meet again, and Cas looks so hopeful for a second there before the passive mask is on again. And yeah, Dean needs to still fix so many things between them, but he has been here for almost four months now and he is staying and he will fix it.
“I’m sorry to intrude, but I-” He was staring at his arm again and Dean was getting antsy. This was not how he planned his night to go.
Quickly having to learn how to fend for himself, the now teenager didn’t like meeting new people, knowing they will leave. So the only one he talked to was the boy who he shared the room with.
Of course, Sam turned twelve eventually too; got his own Soulmark. The difference between the two of them? Well, Sam for one loved it. He showed Dean the three neatly written words with a smile the second he was awake, excitement in his voice.
“I did it. I wanted it.”
And really, how much more selfish can Dean get?
It seems that he still got it anyway.
“Dean,” Said man was brushing his teeth when he was cornered; not for the first time. His eyes meeting blue trough the mirror. “What’s your Soulmark.”
Once, years ago, Dean was able to count the things that made him happy on one hand. Sammy, The Impala, a good pie and a good lay. Then he dared think he deserves more, he took more and now it’s too many things to count, but all of them led to the same source. The one sitting in front of him, looking as pained as he felt.
And there it was. The one million dollar question. Dean chuckled at his own joke. It might have been his second beer.
He needs to keep driving. Needs to go back to John and make sure that he has backup as he goes from one monster to another. Dean needs to do so many things.
Something about people sleeping on the other side.
“I'm an Angel of the Lord.”
The relief doesn’t last long though, because the thing isn’t effected and just pulls it out and drops it on the floor like it was made of rubber and they were doing a magic trick. Dean can’t move anymore; it really is a demon.
“Promise me you won’t take the arm guard off when you bury me.” Staring at his own arm and listening to the shuffle of papers was when Dean finally spoke for the first time that day.
He ignored a lot of things now as he continued driving and gave Sam as much privacy as one can while sharing the same car. He was definitely ignoring the Hi I’m Sam that was written on Jess’s forearm when she opened the door for him a few days back.
Always straight to the point.
Fuck, he shouldn’t have come back.
It almost reminded him of their mom. Of how she was always so happy to show everyone.
He decided not to get close to him though, not wanting to go through rejection and abandonment again.
It was the kind of sound that made the wolf he was still half leaning on stop growling and turn towards him instead. His eyes were still red, but there was some emotion in there now; concern, panic.
Who even knows if the thing he came here for is even still there. If he thinks about it, chances are that it isn’t. There is no way Dean has any kind of luck anymore. He has shed blood too many times for anything good in his life. And this is good. Was; he reminds himself with clenched fists. This was good. This was too good for Dean to keep in his life.
A sleek black car sped though the night, as rain fell over the quiet road. Inside it, the driver held onto the wheel tight enough that his knuckles turned white, doing his best to pretend the one next to him didn’t have silent tears falling down his face. He still glanced over every once in a while though, only to see the man’s shoulders shake and his fingers still numbly pass over the words on his forearm. The movement so like the one their dad did, that it did nothing to keep the guilt he himself felt at bay.
“You were right.” Sam downed his drink and ticked the bartender for another. “Meeting your soulmate brings nothing but pain. Keep away.” He sounded bitter, as he downed another one.
Words. Words would be good right about now.
The other was still growling under his hands, every muscle in his body taunt and ready for a fight. There was no time to deal with that right now either. Dean knew from experience that trying to calm him down will do absolutely nothing until the others back off.
“I love you too.”
It’s not like he meant to stay. He really didn’t. Staying for longer than a few days was not even on his mind, until he noticed that the seasons have started to change. Until he noticed that he has stayed.
He met his eyes anyway, as a hand wrap around the wrist of his left arm, touch almost burning.
He spends the day locked into a motel room and away from everyone. The arm guard is discarded somewhere along with the three empty bottles of beer. He numbly follows along the words written on there.
More then fine.
The shower isn’t as relaxing as it was intended when he stormed in there before Sam had a chance to. All the blood and shit was off of him now but he has been staring at his Soulmark for a good ten minutes. The water is cold by this point. He doesn’t try to get out.
The look of hurt on Cas’s face haunted Dean for the next few days. It was for the best though. What good will him knowing do anyway. They will get his grace back and it will be gone again, like it was never there. Dean never wanted a soulmate anyway.
However, meeting him brought a new experience to Castiel.
The trip from his car to an apartment building close by has been a blur of getting tugged through the streets and up the stairs, before he was finally just gently pushed down onto a couch.
It was all enough to make Castiel smile.
Dean almost laughed at the words, but had to stop himself, so that it doesn’t look like he’s on a suicide mission he himself isn’t even sure he isn’t on. Instead he held the knife in his hand tighter and spoke up. “Bobby, whatever this is, whatever it wants, it's after me. That much we know, right? I've got no place to hide. I can either get caught with my pants down again, or we can make our stand. “
It took a few minutes of shuffling in the kitchen before Cas sat himself on the coffee table right in front of him with his own cup of tea.
“Hiya Cas, I hear the janitors closet is all he rave right now. Five stars and everything. Wanna make out?” He finished off with a dazzling smile for good measure, as he caged the boy against the lockers with his arms on either side of him, body just close enough that they were touching, but barely.
Flipping them over so that the other was pressed against the wall now, Dean let himself press their lips together for another kiss before answering. “Three hours. Sammy thinks I’m out getting laid so I need to be back in the morning.”
With Cas around Sam stopped wearing his arm guard as some kind of a weird solidarity thing. He would look at Dean sometimes like he actually expected him to do the same. All it ever got him was an eye roll.
Dean didn’t even try pretending like he was drinking his own.
It’s deeper then he remembered, but still the same. That voice that would make his muscles relax and shoulders sag in relief whenever he would come back to it.
Of course he was stupid to think that Sam was just going to let it go, let him go to hell without a fight, but Dean was just so damn tired of the fight. It has been a decade since the day he found out he was going to go to hell and he was just tired. Deciding to rather spend the year he has left eating food, saving people and getting laid as much as possible. Sam was not on board with that plan.
And then he was passing through the last bit of trees, breaking onto the clearing that housed their pack, feeling elated at being enveloped in the scent of pack and home and family. Finally, in what felt like forever he was safe.
The resolve to not read the words lasted only a few days; as his curiosity got the best of him. Reading the words doesn’t mean he has to act on it. Yes, reading it once won’t hurt anyone. However, actually reading it only left Dean staring before huffing and covering it up again with more force then necessary.
And it is also the ‘I love you’ he got in return.
By the time he was twelve no one felt like family anymore.
Cas is an angel again, the mark is gone and Dean is alone. Everything is as it should be.
He let himself slip down to the ground as the water continued pouring over him. Fuck.
“I wasn’t aware you planned to see me again at all.” The words were said in an even tone, but they hurt more than any angry outburst could, making him wince.
However, whatever got him out was damn powerful if his own grave-site was to go by. The thought made the hair on the back of his neck stand up as he rubbed the arm guard, feeling the need to take it off and check again in hopes that it was gone. He had already checked though; it wasn’t.
He did however make sure to be a bit more careful with those; only ever flirting with them at night when neither Sam nor John would ever see or get a word of it. Not wanting that particular part of his life to get out. He may be a bit bisexual or whatever but he was not suicidal.
Fucking Soulmarks.
Because as Dean shook his hand with a smile, his heart beat just a little bit faster and face got a little bit redder.
Only a year ago, the teen would have chastise himself for all of this, the feelings, the thoughts, the stupidity of what he was doing three towns over from where he was supposed to be, and at 2am at that. But now, today, there was no time to be anything but relived and happy as the one before him climbed out of the second floor window, rope in hand, and (almost) gracefully dropped right next to him.
Castiel had no more family left.
He had no more butlers to cook for him or clean up after. No more nannies to wake him up and help with homework.
He didn’t even have a good reason to be there. No hunt. Nowhere he needed to be. Nowhere he wanted to be.
“Dean.”
It hurt though. He was just getting used to everything, finally settling into a nice enough routine when he saw a glance of the others forearm during a fight earlier. Dean checked again before he left too. Nothing there still.
The effort got him an eye roll in return, and damn there go those damn butterflies in his gut again. Way to act like a teenage girl, Winchester.
It must be nice to have one.
“I can take the couch.” This was awkward. He was sitting here, opposite the only person he ever felt at home with, like he could breathe and let his guard down for once; and it felt like he was being suffocated from the sheer awkwardness that surrounded them.
“It’ll heal.” Dean spoke through a yawn, feeling himself sink into the mattress as if in a trance. Damn, how he missed his mattress.
“This is a good thing.” He said out loud even as no one could hear him; maybe because no one could hear him. “This is a good thing.”
It was actually ridiculous how fast he got into the routine of things once he was able to get his hands on the first car that needed fixing at the repair shop. There was still the smell of coffee every day, and the late mornings that the weekends bring, and the small smiles that he gets whenever he cooks something delicious, because Cas is still a menace in the kitchen, and Dean hasn’t yet earned the big smiles back.
None if it mattered though. He just had to move; he had to get to Cas before anyone gets killed.
“We could choose life.”
“When are you leaving?”
Instead, he focused on holding onto him, praying it will be enough for now, as he turned his focus onto his real problem at hand. The pack of stupidly protective wolves that need to step the fuck down while their limbs are still all attached.
Cas was frowning at him. He was always frowning at him lately. “I would like to know.” He insisted in the end and the words made the other let out a bitter laugh.
Good. This is good.
But, all he wants to do is go home.
He spit in the sink and took a minute to compose himself before turning around. “It’s not important.”
Dad just passed by them and went straight for the kitchen, and undoubtedly the beer there, while Dean shrugged his shoulders and avoided the other man’s eyes. Not really an answer, but not much he can say about this either.
His words were followed by silence, and it was awkward, but not nearly as much as it was when he first got back. Cas looked like he was searching for something on his face.
Castiel used to wonder what is family, what is home.
Ignoring him, Dean just turned his back to the other before they fought again. They’ve been fighting a lot lately and Dean was far too drunk to deal with it right now.
The thought was bitter, but it also made him realize that no matter what, he will at least say goodbye this time. Cas deserves so much more, but Dean can at least do that much. He will have to.
Selfish.
Dean was drinking. He doesn’t think he will ever stop drinking. “What is it?” Hearing the words made him take a big gulp as he did his best to avoid looking at Cas.
She would always say that they love him and want only the best for him; Castiel nodding every time even as he didn’t understand what she meant.
The empty house that echoed the melodies of his record player, too tall ceilings, the many mirrors that were there to reflect only his face as he grew up…
Which, yeah he has a chair. He doesn’t know when it became his chair or when he claimed the left side of the bed as his too, but they just are and that makes Dean happy. It makes him so happy.
There were nights when the boy couldn’t sleep; those nights he took one of the many books he required through the years and let himself be immersed in a world that wasn’t his own. One that didn’t feel as lonely as his did.
Dean continued to drive.
“Drink your tea.” The man was walking away, but he wasn’t kicking him out yet. “I’ll go make lunch.”
“Can we just pretend like I didn’t leave for two years? Can we go back to how it was?” Dean was drowning and he knew it; grasping at straws like the desperate man that he has become.
He deserved that one though. He may have never said it, but two years of missed phone calls and no visits made it kind of obvious.
It was all that stupid mark’s fault; he grit his teeth. Soulmarks. What a joke.
Good things don’t happen to Dean after all.
It was only when he let himself fall back into silence that it hit him that this is more then he has talked in a long while. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise though.
