John snorted, his shoulders shaking with the laugh. "I've never actually believed that. I used to watch them as a kid, just to see if it was true."
Sherlock's heart sped up. He'd said something wrong. He'd done everything wrong. John knew. John hated him. John didn't want him anym-
Sherlock raised himself off of the chair and slowly walked to his room. He pulled off his clothes and laid down, curling up to one of his pillows. Yes, that was Sherlock's smell. And it had been on John. He let out a long breath.
Sherlock’s heart sped up, thumping in his chest, and he pulled his off, tossing them aside taking in where they landed - by the door - and he looked down at John. His breath left him again and he had trouble pulling in a breath.
John nodded, and turned back to the fridge, grabbing some bacon that had been thrown in there when they had first arrived. He got it out of the package, lying it in strips in the pan.
Mycroft shook his himself and looked around again. There was no door. There was an outline where one should’ve been, but there was no way for him to do anything with it. The ceiling had a single vent, which Mycroft knew was only so whoever was in here would be able to breathe. There wasn’t a way out. Mycroft didn’t know how he’d let himself get taken. It had been stupid. Of all the people to get taken they had decided to take the person who was technically the British government.
John sighed, "When I was young, Harry would lie with me when I had nightmares. Lie with me, Sherlock." Sherlock stayed a moment, then moved slowly. He laid on the bed, with John next to him. John had a pressure in his chest, and his vision was blurry.
Johns moaned at the pressure.  He waited.  Felt for the moment Sherlock relaxed then slid, rocking back and forth.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  Keeping the movements slow and gentle, gliding withing him.  Feeling every nodule as his cock flicked over them.  It was sending him wild.  Testing his restraint.  He never fucked this slowly.  Never felt it this intensely.  It was a wonderful torture of restraint.
He pressed back deep, withdrew far enough that the toy curved and threatened to bulge free from Sherlock’s body as he pressed back in.  A moan was drawn from Sherlock’s lips.  The head of the huge toy renting him open as John forced it deep again.  Sherlock left his breath hitch as the depth rearranged his insides.  It felt so different to John, big, nearly as huge as he was, but not hot, not as demandingly hard.  The head wide, but without the uniqueness of John’s pierced cock.  Cataloguing the differences Sherlock had not noticed he was breathing out soft deep noises of pleasure.  He stopped himself, only to begin again as John sunk his mouth over Sherlock’s cock as he continued to rock the toy in and out of his body.  Sherlock buckled at the unexpected bliss.
No.  Almost.  John’s mouth had been right there on his neck.  Sherlock pressed his face back into the floor in dismay.  More moisture ran from him.  Sherlock tried to clench down again.  His bloody body would not cooperate; it would never cooperate.
“This isn’t just going to slide in, Sherlock.”  John stood up, giving Sherlock his first look at his fully naked body.  His cock was jutted straight up.  It was thicker than a wrist and can up past his navel.  The flared head almost purple with desire was adorned with a shining silver ring that threaded through his slit and out the top of the head.  The ring was large enough to drag most men to limp, but John’s sturdy size held it up proudly.
John put a hand on Sherlock’s hip to keep him there.  “Easy now, don’t struggle.  I won’t force it on you.  I thought it might be something you want.  Most Omegas do.”
He pushed forwards relentlessly.  His back and arse and thighs taught with effort.  Halfway in, he pulled back.  Thrust in again.  Repeated the movement twice more.  Sherlock was making the most delicious breathless keening noises.
John fumbled to undo his clothing as he slowly worked Sherlock open, twisting and separating his fingers.  Once he had his pants shoved down, he hissed with relief.  His cock leaping up to slap him on his belly.  He was thankful that Sherlock had his head tipped back so he could not see his intimidating size.
They lay together in silence, the only sound that of the traffic outside.  Over time, Sherlock could feel the heat building, the ache inside, dulled slightly by the huge toy, increased.  John’s scent wrapped around him made him light-headed and numb to the past.  He needed to be friction.  Movement.  “Are you awake?”
Cheers for all the love so far.  Watching that hit counter is addictive.  Thanks for being my drug of choice.
Sherlock winced.  His body needed relief again.  It ached with a deep want that nothing could deny.  Not his mind palace, not a puzzle, not a chemical experiment, not even a case, nothing but deep penetration and the scent of an Alpha.
Every thrust pushed air from Sherlock’s lungs.  He was breathless after four.  Unable to take a full breath as his inside struggled to accommodate John’s formidable Alpha endowment.  He should have been struggling against it.  Breathless and in pain, yet an ecstasy that he had never experienced overwhelmed everything else.  The smooth heavy ring slid along his channel lighting up every pleasure centre in his body and brain.  The burning itch of desire was satisfied and the ache deep within was soothed by pounding.  John retched deeper inside him than anything ever had before.
It had hurt.  It still hurt.  It had felt intense.  Unlike anything he had ever felt before.  It was going to change everything.
It was all John’s Alpha needed to hear.  He thrust a few times without even pulling back.  Nudging Sherlock along the bed.  The damp towel bunching beneath his hips.  Then John pulled back, almost all the way out of the vice-like channel and thrust his whole length home.  The squelch and suck of their lubricated bodies reverberated around the room, louder even than their aroused vocalisations.
Back by popular demand (about three of you asked for it and that is all my ego needs to write more). Here is another chapter of smutty smut.  A bit of plot peeks in, but it is mostly just raunchy sex worthy of the Alpha/Omega trope.
Sherlock keened long and high pitched as he slid his forearm deeper still.  The noise of that deep eloquent voice turned into incomprehensible bliss did things to John’s cock.  He had never seen Sherlock like this.  He suspected that very few had.  Maybe no one.  Then he realised, he was the first.  Not to fuck him, he had said as much and he did not act like a virgin Omega, but to see him in the throes of helpless bliss.  “No one has ever tried to make it good for you.  Have they?”
John’s nose was buried against Sherlock’s neck.  The scent of him was incredible.  The pain and fear tinging the scent with something vulnerable that was not there earlier.  The desire to sink his teeth in was strong.  He wanted to own this beautiful struggling Omega.
“We will see if we can change that.”  John withdrew his hand slowly pressing over the little nodules inside Sherlock’s strange body as he left.  Sherlock shudder through an unexpected and sudden orgasm.  His release was weak, just the twitch of muscles and a satisfied sigh.  Working to improve the orgasm, John made a fist against his opening and pumped his cock with his free hand.   Sherlock clenched, startled by the increased pleasure.  He was still coming as John withdrew his hand completely and replaced it with the head of his cock.
John gave a little laugh; it wasn’t like Sherlock to be so wrong.  “She gives us her congratulations and says she is off to stay with her sister.  She said we could make a much noise as we like.  I might take her up on it.  I might give a good howl next time I fill you up.”
“If you’ve gone that far, there is only one way to put a stop to it and it does not involve anything I learned at medical school.  Well, not in class anyway.”
Sherlock’s breath hitched and he threw his head back as John’s cock rubbed against his own.  His own moisture making the slide smooth.  A large drop of warmth spilled onto the place where his ribs met in the centre of his torso.  He looked down to see that it was a dollop from the slit of John’s cock.  “You’ll be so deep.”
John rolled Sherlock onto his back, leaned in to kiss him.  Sherlock turned his face away.  “Just get on with it.”
John smiled as he rubbed the slick along his cock with both hands.  He directed his cock towards Sherlock’s opening and watched as he sunk the adorned head into the searing vice of bliss.
They fell silent.  John still running his fingers along Sherlock’s smooth back.  Up and down.  Bump, bump, bump, bump over the scars.  Sherlock still.  His breathing shallow but even.
John’s clothing was lying in a puddle beside them.  The noise seemed to be coming from there.  Sherlock groped for John’s discarded jeans, trying to keep his body as still as possible.  He fished out the vibrating phone.  It buzzed like it was alive in his hand.  Irrationality told him to press it to the place between his balls and where John’s cock connected them.  Instead, he pressed the green icon.  Pressed it to his ear.
The moment Sherlock’s orgasm finished panic overcame him.  It was too much.  It hurt beyond belief.  His body tried to recoil away from where they were locked together.
John grunted as he fought the tinny abortive thrusts his body wanted to make.  Tried to make it a slow even slide in and his body fought him to drive home.  Sherlock’s body was opening up to him, but slowly.  Too slowly.
“Please, John, deeper.  Something.  More.  Anything.”  Sherlock said, his voice coming in tinny bursts.
“I don’t think that is possible, but I need it, John, I need it now.”  Sherlock shifted on the bed, unable to keep still.  His hips twitching, searching for friction.
Sherlock groaned with the delay in his orgasm.  He knew John was not even all the way in yet.  His body fighting a conflict between keeping him out and to suck him in deeper.  John had the power to push in;  his cock ridged as steel.  Not every Alpha could.  Sherlock’s body had denied more than one weaker Alpha in the past.  They simply had not had the strength to push into him.  Leaving both of them frustrated and unfulfilled.  Some flew into a rage, others just left him alone to deal with this heat alone.  Only the strongest ones had had the strength and rigidity to push into his fickle body.  Unfortunately, these Alphas were usually the cruellest too, not caring a but for his own pleasure.
John hummed and Sherlock thought he would come.  He wanted this to last though.  He panted through the moment, knuckled down on his body’s desire to come.  John bobbed his head, rocked the toy.  Then let it go while it was still inside him as he moved down to suck his balls into his mouth.  Rolled them over his tongue and pulled off, leaving a wet string of saliva between them.
John nodded.  Stepping away, just a fraction, to give them space to move.  The presence of mind to grab the towel before following Sherlock from the bedroom was just lucky chance.  Sherlock stood quivering as John pulled the covers all the way back to the foot of the bed and spread the towel.  Sherlock was glad of it.  He could feel moisture between his cheeks, greasy and slick.  The shower he had taken to clean it away already pointless.
John gently pressed Sherlock’s knees open further and promised, “I’m going to look after you so well.”
John let the bitterness he felt roll over him, then flush away.  “They look like they were pretty serious.”
“I know.”  John said softly as he continued to stroke Sherlock through the over sensitivity.  Loving the way his body was writhing and whimpering with the stimulation.  John thrust harder.  His own climax close.  Barrelling down on him.  He held Sherlock still with a free hand upon his hip and pulled back hard, his knot stretching his own cock all the way from the root, stretching Sherlock’s body until it pulled half out.  John growled as he plunged back in.  Three.  Four.  Five times.  Sherlock wailing into a bitten fist to stop the noise.  John coming.  Hard.  Filling him.  Shuddering.  Seeing stars. Breathless and in ecstasy.
Sherlock shut his eyes to block out the pain.  Just the head of John’s cock was in and he already felt spit in two.
Then everything loosened all at once.  Strings cut; he fell back to the bed.  Still, panting, John still.  The air still.  Silence.
“And have me wanting to puke as soon as you want to stick your unjustifiably large cock back in, I don’t think so.”  Sherlock rolled his eyes, even with his back turned, John could tell.  He knew it was an argument he wouldn’t win though.  He sat on the bed in the sliver of space beside Sherlock’s sprawled body.
The hand tightened, the toy jabbed deep and stayed there.  And Sherlock tipped.  Flooded with spreading pleasure, coming, writhing.  Aware of curious wet impossible heat spreading inside him as if the toy was coming too.  John whispering, “fuck.”  More heat pumping into him.  Sherlock still gasping as the toy rocked and the hand, feather light, stroked him as he orgasmed hard, grunting, every muscle tight.
The scent was gone, John realised.  It was as if Sherlock was only half in heat.  He did not know what to do.  He sat and watched over him, as Sherlock shivered and sweated into the mattress.  His own libido was still high; an Omega was before him in distress, but the confusion of Sherlock’s lack of scent kept him in check.
John needed to thrust.  He had kept it in check as long as he could, but he lost the battle against biology when he got to the base of where his knot would soon be.  His cock was still sleek and flat, but he was unable to stop his hips from snapping forwards until he was pressed tight against Sherlock.  His rough curls against the smooth skin of Sherlock’s body.
John paused when he was half-way in.  He let out a breath he had been holding.  Sherlock’s hole throbbed hot around him and his hips twitched.  John stroked Sherlock’s cock as he sunk in deeper.  He needed to be inside.  The cool air of the room around the base of his cock was like splinters of ice.  It hurt to be outside of him, yet he knew he would break Sherlock if he thrust in.
“But you might not have been.  Alphas get hurt all the time when Omegas freak out.  We have both seen what can happen.  Remember the Schiffer case.”
Sherlock gripped hard; his knuckles white.  John released his cock.  Grabbed both hips, pulled back until just the ring was inside Sherlock, paused for a breath.  Then he drove forwards as hard as he could.  Sherlock’s insides having no choice but to part for John’s cock.
“Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate others.  Are you ready for more?”
“Nope.  My body just does as it pleases, without my permission.”  Sherlock said with an angry sigh.  “Thankfully, I don’t get too many heats.  They disrupt the work, and it is hard to find a partner.  People find me… off putting.  I usually just lock myself in my room and try to ignore it.”
The change in position from their last round caused the ring in the head of John’s cock to press into new places within him.  Triggering new tingling pleasure amongst the pain of penetration.  The ring was startlingly cold as it rolled over all the pleasure centres inside him in a new way.  He was so on edge.  Only John’s firm hand around his cock was stopping him from exploding.
John waited a beat, heard nothing more.  He braced his shoulder and ran at the door.  Wood splintered as he crashed into the bathroom.  Sherlock was curled up naked on the floor.  Leaning against the side of the bathtub.  He was pale and shaking.  John went to him, knelt before him.  Felt his feverish forehead, even as he tried to pull away.  Smelt his scent, something was off.  He asked gently, “what happened?”
Head thrown back in bliss and anticipation Sherlock didn’t bother to reply.  He thought he probably tasted like day old sweat and come, but he couldn’t articulate it as John mouthed along the waistband of his pants.  Lowering them slowly, kissing more.  Lowering more.  Sherlock was hard and wanting.  His erection pushing up against the constrictive fabric.
John stole any argument Sherlock might have had with a deep kiss.  He knew that Sherlock would not believe him, for some time, perhaps ever, but he would show him, in any way he could that he deserved to be treated better than he had in the past.  John kissed him, held his hand tightly.
John’s palm moved over the nodule and this finger found another above it.  John considered how unusual this was, as Sherlock moaned even louder and pressed his hands over his face.  John wanted with equal intensity, to take him to a medical facility and inspect every inch of him, and to fuck him senseless.
With great difficulty, Sherlock managed to roll away from John and wrap himself around a pillow, nearly face down, relieving the pressure from the toy slightly.
John drank down the last of his tea, enjoying the perfect temperature, the rich flavours, and the warm feeling it left in his belly.
None were like John though.  None had his size or his determination.  He cleaved his way in.  Slow.  Relentless.  Endless, deep thrusts.  Deep, yet later when he was fully seated, this would seem shallow by comparison.
“Interesting.”  John thrust a little.  Fascinated by the toy’s disappearance.  If he hadn’t just come. He’d be rock hard just from the sight.  The sounds were turning him on too.  Sherlock was whimpering softly as he bit down on the pillow under his cheek.  John slid the toy in further.
“Here, turn over.”  John said.  Helping Sherlock to roll towards him.  Sherlock groaned, his body unwilling to move.  The toy pressing into clenching depths.  John having to lift his heavy limbs.  Sherlock settled onto his back; his face twisted in discomfort.  John cupped his cheek, “look at me, you deserve better.”
John could feel his erection pushing hard up against his too tight jean.  Come to think of it, all this clothing was suddenly feeling much too tight.  Much longer in this room and he would be just as desperate as Sherlock clearly was.  He started to retreat.  His wallet completely forgotten.  “I should go then.”
John could understand his desperation; his own was not far behind.  John applied a bit more lube, rubbing it over his hand and wrist and then slipped his hand in up to the palm.  His thumb still outside to rub about the rim.  He patted at Sherlock’s insides finding all the places that made him hum and twitch.  He penetrated him slowly.  It took him longer than it normally would.  Sherlock’s anatomy was different.  Something slightly off it, not just the tightness, but also about where everything lay.  John enjoyed the exploration, twisting his hand and spreading his fingers.
“Don’t you dare.”  Sherlock released one of the hands he had clasped in the bedding to rub over his cock.  He needed a distraction from the stretch.  Three quick pulls and he forgot about the strain within him.
John was nearly mad with the Alpha drive to claim his Omega.  The constricting warmth of Sherlock’s body drove him on.  He could not believe he was inside him.  Him of all people.  And that body.  Tight and lith.  It was like fucking a virgin.  He could see the muscle ripple with every thrust and when he placed a hand on Sherlock’s belly he could feel as his cock passed under the slim layers of muscle and skin.  The ring in his cockhead tugged as he pulled out supplying a stimulation only possible by being deep within someone.  He tried to set a steady pace but as he got to the base of his cock each time his hips snapped forward without his permission.  He could hear it as his dick punched the breath out of Sherlock’s lungs.  On every inward thrust the ring sunk deeper into his cock.  It was like Sherlock was fucking his cock with his insides.  That thought triggered his knot and on the next thrust he could not sink in as deep.  He growled with frustration as Sherlock’s body held him at bay.
John held up the tool, still attached to the base of the enormous toy.  Sherlock lifted his head to inspect the item.
Sherlock nodded into the pillow.  Tried to move; to lift himself up on his arms.  Failed as the deep intrusion shifted his mind, and all his energy to the centre of his being.  John sensing his difficulties, helped him to move, rolling him over, moving one limb at a time.  Sherlock muttered complaints as he tired overheated body fought the movement.  Every muscle resisting; burning.  On his back he panted as the mattress pressed the toy deeper into him.  John helped him to shuffle back against a pillow he had propped up and helped him to raise his knees to reduce the pressure.  “Oh, Jesus that’s…”
“Yes, Sherlock?”  John teased, with a smile in his voice.  He could not believe the sight before him.  Sherlock with his head thrown back.  His long neck stretched and his chest heaving.
Sherlock shuddered as the flared head pushed him to his limits.  John stroked him all over.  Holding the toy deep with one hand until he relaxed.  Ran a fingertip around the stretched hole and the edge of the toy.
“I thought it might help keep you open, ready for me,” John stammered, suddenly awkward about the proposition, “if you like, you don’t have to.  It’s just an idea.”
Sherlock groaned as he folded in on himself.  Bereft at the loss.  Come and mucous dribbled down the crease of his arse cheek towards the floor.  “So empty.  I feel hollowed out.”
Sherlock went still.  Shock and instinct freezing him in place as John clamped his mouth down hard.  An eerie calmness flooded over him along with another orgasm that produced nothing.  His useless Omega cock wrung dry by multiple releases.
John went back to his tea.  Sipped it.  Traced a long line down Sherlocks arm to his wrist with his free hand.  Sherlock moved his hand, grasped John’s gave it a single squeeze and then release him, but he didn’t pull away.  John didn’t either.  He blew on his tea, sipped a little and held on.
He wanted a shower.  He wanted to run and never return.  He considered this, even with the clarity that he would be raped by another Alpha the moment he slipped through the front door.  At least he did not expect anything better from them.  Still, it was not John he wanted to run from, it was his body, his hormones and his past.  John’s rough treatment was not a surprise, that was just how Alphas acted.
“No, you were fine, just like any Alpha, but I can’t handle it.”  Sherlock hated his useless body just a bit more.  He shivered again.  “I can never handle it.  My body wants to have sex.  Demands it and then hates it all the same.”
Kneeling up, John straddled him, kissed him, ground their hips together.  Sherlock breathing soft whimpering gasps into John’s mouth, tasting his Alpha scent.  Thick and masculine.  John kissed down his chin, along his neck.  Wet open mouth kisses.  His lips warm and soft.  Hands on his sides.  Overwhelming amount of input.  Mouth.  Hands.  Groin.  The mouth moving slow then fast.  Unpredictable in its movements, direction, pressure.  On his collar bone, the soft part beside his shoulder, his chest.  His nipple.  Wet tingling from the soft tongue, sharp pleasure from teeth. Sherlock’s hips wanted to move; John kept him pressed against the bed.  The toy grinding into him.  Blew cold air on his wet nipple.  Sherlock drew breath so fast it whistled.  John kissed further down his body.
Sherlock sighed, looked away.  “Nothing about me is normal.  I have some kind of… imbalance.  The doctors never figured it out.  They theorised that I am part Beta because my penis is a standard deviation above the average size of an omega’s and because my cycles are irregular.  They thought my hormones were out of whack and tried hormone therapies, they just made me ill.  They thought I was faking it.  They thought I just needed a good shag.  They thought it was just an infertility problem.  They ran scans and test and then more test.  Nothing was definitive.  I told them to sod off.”
“I came to completion,” Sherlock said, his voice hoarse, but his words more formal and ridged than they should have been when two men were in so intimate a position.  Then as an afterthought he added, “more than once.”
“So stretched.  Can hardly breathe.”  Sherlock moved to touch his flat stomach, now so full of John’s cock that he could not take a full breath.  He could feel John’s hardness beneath his hand.  John placed his hand over Sherlock’s, their fingers intertwining and pressing down.
John hummed.  Roused himself from his meditative relaxation.  “Are your Omega urges ready for another round?”
Sherlock muttered sounds of pleasure that John could not understand.  John pressed deeper so he could massage the bump.  He loved seeing Sherlock like this.  Sherlock’s cock jumped against his belly making a wet slapping sound.  John pressed in further.  His forearm sinking into Sherlock’s body.
John admired the muscular definition of Sherlock’s back as he got between his spread knees.  The scared lines were more obvious now, but his mind was ruled by other things.  The sight of Sherlock bound and helpless before him fed his Alpha instincts to take.  The simmering lust was gone, replaced with a raging fire.  He was rock hard again, the ring in his cock shifting and as he thickened and throbbed, making the ring feeling tight and obvious as he thought of the tight heat of Sherlock’s body.  The way it had gripped and rippled around him, God, he wanted more.
“You don’t have to.  Just take it.  That’s all you have to do.”  John growled as he sunk his fingers into Sherlock’s hips.
John grunted.  He doubted it would fit.  He gave a heavy nudge forward.  Sherlock stretched around him, but he could not fit all the way in.
“I’m trying.”  John promised as he pulled Sherlock’s legs apart further.  He used both thumbs to pull his cheeks apart and he thrust as hard as he dared.
Sherlock thought of the note that Mrs. Hudson had left.  Knew that no one other than John could hear him, yet he still felt too embarrassed to let the little noises escape him.  A life time of holding back was hard to overcome.  He tried though, for John.  He let out a little keening noise as John lowered his pants further.  The cool air of the room startling on his cock.  He lifted his hips so that John could lower his pants properly, the toy making all it’s length and girth be known as he shifted.  Sherlock froze, clenched to try to keep the phallic toy inside.  John was kissing back up his legs, hands exploring the curves and lines of his legs.
John had to be more forceful now.  Taking Sherlock’s hips to support his quivering body.  Rubbing the bruises he had put there with his thumb as he pressed in.
John pressed it forward, cutting off anything more Sherlock might have had to say.  Sherlock felt every bit of the huge dildo entering his body.  Cold.  Firm.  Unrealistic.  The wobbling of the artificial cock translating into ripples of odd sensation.
“Oh, I’m, hello.  I was just wondering; is everything was ok?  John is rather late to work this morning.  He was meant to be here two hours ago.  I’ve been trying to call but...”
John did not let him finish.  He pressed his mouth against the place where Sherlock’s neck met his shoulder.
Sherlock rolled away, happy to be hiding his face.  John helped him tuck a pillow under his hips and then he slicked up the monster cock.
“He won’t be in all week.  Please don’t call again.”  Sherlock hung up before the annoying voice could speak again.
John woke alone and cold.  His back ached and the dried crust of lust itched ever where that it lingered.  He looked around desperately for Sherlock.  The room was silent.  The cover on the bed were a mess, dried opaque splodges spread between smears of blood.  Jesus, he really had let his Alpha side get away from him.
“It’s the extra-large.  Medium firmness.  I’ve compared it to mine.  The boys didn’t do a bad job with selecting the size.  It’s longer than I am but the base means that it has a bit less usable length, only about fifteen inches apparently.”
“Easy now.  Let’s lay down.” John soothed him as he pulled him down.  John tangled their legs together so Sherlock could not pull away and held him tight against his chest.  Slowly, their breathing evened out and synchronised.  John rubbed his hand over Sherlock’s belly to sooth the cramps.  His cock could feel his hand moving and he shuddered with blissful pleasure.
Sherlock choked a cough as John sunk even deeper with the new position.  His body quivered, his eyes wide, his inside rippled and cramped.  It was too much.
“I’m going to come again.”  Sherlock said in a voice that was a feathery whispered that held a hint of embarrassment.  He did not want to come so soon, like a horny teenager.  John was doing things to him that he had never experienced, not to this intensity.  The stretch.  The depth.  That sinful piece of jewellery.
Buried so deep inside.  His knot locking them together, John couldn’t thrust fully, so, he rocked his hip.  Swirled and tilted into the gripping warmth of Sherlock’s body.  Sherlock moaned deeply at the sensations.
As they cooled, John dragged the duvet down over them and they slept on the hard floor amongst their sticky mess.
When Sherlock relaxed enough that a gush of sweet-smelling slick streamed from him, John went back to stroking and thrusting.  His hand was cramping so much that he had to removed it completely to shake out the ache.  He used his right hand for a few moments before swapping between his left and right hand with every thrust.  Using four fingers and going in all the way to the base of his thumb.  Sherlock’s body opening like a flower in the wake of his orgasm.
No answer came.  He pulled on his Alpha Support Shorts as he raced from the room.  He ran through their home.  The kitchen was empty.  The sitting room was empty.  Upstairs was empty.
Sherlock tried to speak, his voice clicking in his throat.  He cleared it.  Tried again, “very much.”
With no knot to hold onto, even his hole relaxed, moisture seeping from him.  No panic came, none even to fight off.  He lay in the warm floating bliss of natural chemicals and he admired them as they sparkled through his body and brain.
“I don’t think my body is going to allow for that.”  Sherlock was already looking flushed, and his cock was semihard.
Sherlock got into position; gripping the headboard as John tied his hands to it.  Sherlock parted his knees already desperate for John to be inside him.
“You alright in there, Sherlock?”  John called through the bathroom door.  He had put off asking as long as he could, but he really needed to leave for work.
Sherlock had napped earlier.  He did not need to sleep again.  Even if he had, discomfort would have prevented it.  His body still stretched to the point of cramping around John’s thick cock.  The sticky heat of his cycle.  The mental disquiet in the wake of the earlier flashback.  He hated all of this.  He hated being controlled by his body or worse yet by the body of a controlling Alpha.  He hated the rough way they all handled him, as if he was a thing.  The way he was stripped of his personality both by hormones and by the hormones of the others around him.  He hated that they took pleasure from him and what he got in return was little more than a biologically driven reward loop.  He hated the empty feeling of being with someone yet not a part of something.  He felt more alone with a cock up his arse than he ever did.  He knew, now more than ever, that he was destined to remain unbonded.  John asking him had been a stupid impulse driven by his stupid dysfunctional hormonal brain.  He knew that John would regret it as soon as his rut was over.  Enjoying his body was one thing.  Being connected to him for life was quite another.  John of all people should understand why that was something to avoid.
“Pushy.”  John chuckled as he pecked Sherlock on the lips and then twisted to retrieve the tea from the bedside table.  He held it to Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock drank a deep gulp.
Beside him Sherlock settled into silence, not asleep, clearly, but resting calmly.  The raging heat reduced to a simmer by their earlier activities and the firm fullness of the passive toy.
“Let’s make this one all about you, yeah?”  John said, as his fingers tickled along Sherlock’s side.
“It’s so deep,” John said with reverent amazement.  He shouldn’t have been surprised but his mind still failed to comprehend Sherlock’s thin lithe body wrapped around something so large and long.  John continued to massage the spot, his own arousal growing.
“I can’t bloody relax.  My body is raging against me.  I’m burning up.  I’m melting from the inside out.”
John grabbed the base of Sherlock’s cock, stopping the orgasm.  “I’ll never get in if you tense up more, you’ll have to wait.”
Closer to the edge than ever, only the absence of a knot keeping him from tipping into the abyss Sherlock gasped, “more, more, more.”
“I can assure you, that I most certainly do.  I want it more than anything in the world.”  John took a deep inhale of the scent, hints of expensive leather and wool filling his nose.
Sherlock chocked a breath as the unforgiving cool ring and the silky hot tip of John’s cock massaged his opening.  He had never felt anything like it.  He had never been so on edge.  The size of John.  The length.  It was intimidating.  Yet he wanted it.
Sherlock lay staring at the far wall.  John had fallen asleep almost immediately after Sherlock had denied him.  A few late nights, long days and two thorough orgasms was clearly all it took to put an Alpha to sleep.
John smiled at the heartfelt note.  He was still smiling about it when he took tea and toast into Sherlock’s room.  He hadn’t moved, except to throw the duvet off and turn his face way from the doorway.  His arse cheeks just peeking out above the blankets.  His breathing was slow and even, but to shallow for him to be asleep.
“You don’t have to.  Just take it.  That’s all you have to do.”  John growled as he sunk his fingers into Sherlock’s hips.  He was in.  He twitched his hips, milking Sherlock’s orgasm.  The orgasm that only made him tighter.  Yet wetter.  The moisture spread now all the way to the base of John’s cock.  It triggered his knot to grow.  John wanted this to last.  He had only been inside a moment.  He did not want to come yet.
He tried to think of boring things.  Unappealing things.  Things that were a total turn off but, he still felt his knot growing as Sherlock rippled and whimpered around him.  John’s Alpha took over.  He could not have stopped it if he had wanted to.  His hip twitched and punched into the man tied in front of him.  Chasing the gripping slide on his endless cock.  Feeling the ring move back and forth in the tip.  Feeling his growing knot catch and pop on the rim of Sherlock’s body until it was too large.  Sherlock’s body denied it once again.  He would not have it though.  He needed to be inside.
“It was a joke gift from my army mates.  They said my cock needed a friend.  I’ve been the butt of endless jokes since the first time they saw me in the shower block.  I was going to chuck it out, but it must have cost a fortune, and every time I go digging for something in the back of the wardrobe, I get a laugh out of finding it again.”
Cupping a hand behind Sherlock’s neck to support him, he laid him back against the mattress.  John stroked over his body.  His rough hands making Sherlock squirm and sigh.
He rolled a pliant Sherlock to the side slowly.  His channel so wet with slick and come that John’s knot and his long cock did not catch, it just rotated inside Sherlock’s body.
Delayed arousal made John feel much the same way, but he was still worried about hurting Sherlock.  His cock was long, and it would penetrate much further than he had opened Sherlock up.
John nodded.  He wanted nothing else.  He stepped forwards between Sherlock’s parted thighs.  Holding himself he ran the tip of his cock and the piercing along Sherlock’s cleft collecting a generous coating of silky moisture.
“You’re still not ready.  You are still so tight around my fist.”  John was torn between the desire to watch his forearm disappear into Sherlock’s tight wet heat and the desire to fuck him senseless.
John smiled at that and wrapped his had around Sherlock’s cock and gave it one long firm delicious stroke.
The twist and pull of John’s fingers made more pre-come run out of the tip of his cock to pool on his belly at the same moment as he felt a new flush of moisture come from deep within.  John’s hand must be drowned with it.  Sherlock writhed so much he barely noticed the fourth finger breach him.  He did notice as John lined up his fingers four across and patted at his internal walls.  He gasped loudly as the pain spiked.
“Up you get.” John encouraged gently as he patted Sherlock’s hip.  As he moved to offer Sherlock a hand up, he noticed for the first time, highlighted in the morning light, a pattern of pale lines crisscrossing Sherlock’s back.  They were so becoming that it took him a moment to realise that they were scars.  Well healed silver lines, but scars, nonetheless.  He was going to mention them when Sherlock interrupted with more urgent demands.
Sherlock whimpered at the stretched-out feeling; not sure he could take much more of the wound tight pleasure he was receiving.  His thighs shook, his hands gripped at his own hair as John took his throbbing cock in hand.
It would calm him.  It would probably reduce the pain, John’s mind lied to him.  He knew it was a trick of biology though.  Still, it would calm him; help to relax his muscles some.
Sherlock felt every quivering agonising millimetre led by the heavy ring that still felt cold within him.
Also some angst (because I'm incapable of just writing a kink fic).  Trigger warning for nongraphic mentions of past noncon,.  Reader descension is advised.
John heart broke, not at the words but at the vulnerability that was confessed with saying them.  It was clear that Sherlock wanted more; wanted better.  It was clear that he had been treated very badly by Alphas in the past, worse even than John had done earlier.  He deserved better; he deserved to be worshiped.
“Let’s get off the floor then.  My shoulder is killing me,” John said.  He pulled away from Sherlock.  His cock making the noise of deep suction as it pulled free from Sherlock’s wet body.  There was a loud clink as John’s hefty cock ring connected with the floor in the silent room.  John hissed.
Ok, here is the boring but important bit. This is not a non-con story, but some chapters might push those boundaries a little bit, and remember real life is more complicated than fiction. This is all fun in fiction land, but in real life make sure you negotiate what you and your partner find enjoyable, sex is not the time for surprises.  Rough sex is great if everyone is having a well negotiated wonderful time.  Painful sex is not so much fun.  If you are hurting your partner it is time to stop.  Look after each other and read all the signals, not just the words. And remember consent can be complicated and can be withdrawn at any time so always check, check and double check that your partner is totally into it.
It wasn’t on purpose that he’d listened to John. Except that he hadn’t done anything to drown out those noises. He hadn’t done a thing to stop himself when he heard John’s groans pick up in speed.
This is just here to say that if English isn't your first language, or if it is and you know someone who likes to read these and English isn't, or if you enjoy reading it in a different language, comment it below.
The link/video above goes with something I added at the end of this chapter that has to do with Sherlock and his violin. I'd recommend listening to it after (or while you're reading it) you've read the chapter so you understand.
And he wouldn't think about the private smile he gave John when he was particularly happy about something, or how he ran his fingers through his hair when he was frustrated.
The room was empty except a single chair pushed up against one of the damp walls - where Mycroft had put it when he’d first waken. He knew the walls her damp, not only because he’d touched them lightly, but because the colour of it was different from regular cement. Yes, he knew it was cement.
Ugh. I'm so sorry I haven't been able to update until now. I feel horrible. My everything's been everywhere and even though I finished all my exams - yay - I still have to work my schedule around everything. But Here is this this chapter  i hope you all like it enough - and my next chapter shouldn't take too long as I already have most of it written. Um...yeah. Again, i'm sorry. I love you all though. Thanks for sticking with me.
It was on the way he smelled: like honey - mostly because of all the tea he made for Sherlock, and the smell just stayed with him - a bit of wood. The wood was different today than it was before. Today he smelled more of amber - rich and warm, vaguely honey like….ah, that’s where the honey was from, not the tea. And he smelled of citrus, which Sherlock supposed was lasted over from whenever John had taken a shower, he always zoned out when John took one. He smelled a bit of lavender, which was from Sherlock’s last experiment that John had gotten to close to.
But now that he was here, he never wanted to leave. He had Sherlock. He had his own little girl, Rosie. He had a family that was his to call home. He had everything he ever wanted. And god, he never would let that go.
"Hello." were the only words that came out, but Mycroft could hear the stress beneath them. He only nodded in response and stayed quiet.
, Sherlock, where are you going. There is no one else for me to ask." Sherlock cocked his head a bit, and his brows furrowed.
John looked over the top of his book, glancing over at Sherlock. The other man had Rosie propped on his hip, pointing at something on the mantle. John closed the book quietly, pushing himself from the chair and walking over. He put his chin on Sherlock's shoulder, smiling when Rosie looked to see what had made the shadow on the mantle, and why there were hands below her legs on Sherlock's waist.
Sherlock's fingers find John's hole, and John to cries out. And when he does, Sherlock pushes a digit past his ring of muscles.
He’s responsive, Sherlock thought. And that one didn’t get pushed away, instead is lingered in his mind as his fingers tightened on John’s waist. He could use that. He filed away the information, and flickered his tongue over John’s lip again, pulling another intense shudder.
God...the stupid game. With fucking Moriarty and Eurus. Sherlock was right. He'd dealt with so much...he'd gone through almost dying more than once...
She squeezed his hand lightly, and nodded. He let out a sigh, and hopped up, rushing out of the room.
This wasn't as long as I hoped it would be. It took me two days to write,and it's *still* not very long. I'm sorry guys....
Sherlock tensed and his eyes widened. He couldn’t answer that. If he did that made it real. That would mean he really did care and he had feelings and that those feelings were towards John and maybe if those feelings were to John and he didn’t have those feelings back well then Sherlock would be fucked.
John shook his head. No. Sherlock didn't love him. Mycroft was just another pawn in the game. And John....John was the one stupid enough to fall into the game.
Oh my god. I feel so *so* bad because I couldn't post anything lately. But I pushed through what I could and I made you all a new chapter. My depression is getting better lately, so I thought I'd celebrate with trying to write you all a new one. Once again, I'm so sorry I didn't post sooner.
After a moment, John let out a small sigh and looked up at Sherlock. His eyes ran blue today and Sherlock had to break eye contact with him after a moment. "I don't understand why you're so upset about it."
John's fingers weave through Sherlock's hair, and he pulls and jerks it with pleasure. Sherlock hums as John alternates between pushing up into Sherlock's warm grip and riding back down onto his hot tongue.
He held there and pressed himself closer and his mind ran. Because John Watson was kissing him back.
Of course it was John, it always was. John was always the first thing he thought about in the morning, and it was the last thing he thought about before going to sleep.
He can feel John break before he hears it, "I'm the one being to into my own head, Sherlock? You're the one who being so stupid and idiotic you can't see the shit we all for you! You can't see the things I hold back every day for you!"
Or how he would make Sherlock beg under him while he licked and bit at the other man's neck, marking up his collar bone. Fuck, how that collar bone killed John every time he saw it after Sherlock would come out the shower.
"How the bloody hell did you know all that, and when did you find it out?" Sherlock smirked. "No, don't tell me how you knew it all, you'll be going on for hours if you do."
"I love you," Sherlock breathes out, and John's entire body breaks down in shivers and soft little whines.
He goes slow, but when John pushes down, desperate, he adds another, and John let outs another embarrassing whimper. Sherlock goes faster this time, but soon enough, John is pressing down wanting more and more.
She loved Sherlock and John, she couldn't deny that, but having those two be so in love and not realize it, was devastating.
John didn't turn, just stopped, one of his hands on the knob of his bedroom door. "Bed." And with that one word, he opened the door, slipped inside, and shut the door behind him.
"I-I was screaming." It wasn't a question. Now that he focused, he could feel the rawness of his throat. Sherlock nodded. They both stayed quiet for a moment.
Sherlock was lying in the same bed as John. John was curled into his side, his head pressed into the crook of Sherlock's neck. Sherlock counted each breath John released.
"It hit hard again. Sherlock, uh, heard me." John's voice fell and he took a drink of the tea. He had  missed how she made it. Mrs. Hudson nodded and took his hand.
His brows furrowed. He'd been sitting here for hours. Alone. And now in the dark. He sighed and stood up. When he moved to walk, his leg hit the edge of the chair and he stumbled forward. His knee hit the side table and in the process the tray of tea came crashing down onto the ground, and Sherlock tumbled after it.
But John couldn't stop his thoughts. He had closed his eyes a while ago, but he was unable to fall asleep. Aside from Sherlock, the chair was hard as hell, and so was the wall. He doubted he was going to get much sleep at all.
The moment he saw 221B, he sped up. He threw the door open, ignoring the slight scream from where Mrs. Hudson would be cleaning the floor because of the time and the date.
After he cleaned, Sherlock climbed into the bed, and pulled John against him, and he sighed when the latter put his face into Sherlock's neck, inhaling. He ran a hand down John's side and let his eyes flutter shut.
John sighed and then leaned forward and touched Sherlock's inner arm - since he usually touched Sherlock's wrist and Sherlock's wrist was in a bandage at the moment.
And everything slowed. His fingers untightened and instead of the frantic kissing they’d been doing, he went slow, John going along and opening his mouth, giving Sherlock more access. Sherlock’s tongue darted in and he almost lost control right then and there.
Sherlock pulls off and makes a soft, delighted noise when he watches as John's dick leak precome. He licks it off with a blissful little smile, and then he finally moves down lower.
methods of thinking. The longest he'd seen Sherlock go on a case was a week. It had been an assassination. But not just one, multiple assassinations.
John was always going to be there, but the last couple days, he was constant. He kept seeing John, and his thoughts kept wandering. He thought, maybe, he could tell John. it's why he hadn't told anyone he figured out the case.
"No," he said, " do you actually want food, or did you just come down here to mess with me?" John asked.
Sherlock listened to everything come from Johns mouth and his mind ran. This….this is why he’d fallen in love with John. But he was being insanely stupid. His eyes flickered down to John’s mouth and he quit hearing anything John was saying.
Sherlock starts going faster, harder, slamming into John in a pace that has him gasping for breath and scrambling for purchase, fingers digging into Sherlock's shoulders much too hard.
She heard the sound of the violin being taken from Sherlock, and then she heard the normal - well, for her at least - gun shot, that meant Sherlock had gone for the gun to shoot the wall rather than hurt John in any way.
"Yo....You're not hurt? You're a-alive" he asked, his voice low and rough and laced with worry and desperateness. John stood still, his own stance the same mix. Sherlock shook his head and swallowed. "M-mycroft said you were....." he trails off and mentally hits himself. Of course Mycroft had lied.
And then Sherlock's tongue shoots out and swipes over John's entrance, and John's hips jump up even as his hands spasm and bury in the bed sheets beneath him. Sherlock's tongue is hot on Johns hole, and John lets out a whining beg, and Sherlock’s stomach twists hot when he hears the sound.
Others did live around them, but they too had grown so used to the fights and the loud noises and the occasional gun shots, that they no longer complained.
John was sitting, his cuppa on the dark carpet, now darker in one spot. He was straight backed, his fingers gripping the arms of his chair. His face was white, and Sherlock saw him swallow.
"Well, tell me how it was," John looked at her. "How what was?" She gave an exasperated sigh, "The case. The city. What you did," she laughed.
He couldn't think why he'd be crying until he heard John let out a sharp breath and then Sherlock was being pulled to his feet and away from the mess.
John turned back onto his side and held back the need to punch his pillow. He swallows and kept his eyes closed. He knew he wouldn't sleep. He never did anymore.
And now, after a year and a-half of Sherlock being back, being here, someone was threatening him again. They'd been through so much already. Moriarty, The Fall, Eurus....
So he just rutted faster until his breath was coming in fast pants because the friction on his cock.
There were scratches running across the middle of the walls, like someone had tried to dig their way out with their nails. And Mycroft knew what looked like. He’d watched people try it over and over at Sherrinford. He knew what he was in, but he kept his mind blank of that thought.
But something held him back. He was afraid. If Sherlock didn't have feelings for him, he would ruin everything with just three words. And that was the last thing he needed. To lose Sherlock. He wasn't going to lose Sherlock. Not now, when John needed him the most. He would do anything to keep Sherlock close, to know he was there.
Sherlock was standing, the pan at his feet, looking at his left hand. John cursed and took Sherlock's wrist, pulling it so he could look at the palm of it better. Sherlock let out a little gasp, but John ignored it, and pulled Sherlock to the sink, turning the water on, and pushing Sherlock's palm under without a word.
He turned around to find a disheveled Sherlock leaning against his kitchen counter. His hair was a mess, sticking up at odd angles. John took the rest of him in. He was dressed in the clothes he'd rushed out in.
Sherlock swallowed and took his, slamming the door shut, and turning to the door that would lead inside. He took a slow breath, put on a smile, and walked up, opening the door.
Sherlock starts to gain momentum, to move faster, but it's only when John whines for more, harder , that he gives up the careful thrusts and drops his control.
John made his way to the kitchen, the smell of fresh tea in the air. He would have to thank Mrs. Hudson the next time he saw her. He missed when she made it, but now he had to depend on Sherlock for the time being. He made his way down the stairs thinking over what had happened. Sherlock had come into his room because of his nightmares, had held him all night, and then rushed out.
Sherlock’s mind is swimming, nothing feels important but the feel of John under him, the slow, hot movement of himself inside John, the way he holds onto John, kissing him.
Lestrade had given them this case. A young woman had shown up dead at the local beach. Police had taken her fingerprints. Her dental. But she wasn't in the system. She wasn't anywhere. She was unidentifiable. So, naturally, Lestrade had given it to Sherlock. The case, however, wasn't in London.
He moved and leaned back down, capturing John’s mouth gently after seeing the other man had started to move self-consciously under Sherlock’s gaze. “Perfect,” he murmured under his breath to John, and Sherlock felt him relax.
Yes, tomorrow he would have to get up early and he would fight with Sherlock about what to cook. But that didn't matter. Because he had everything.
Sherlock adds another finger, then, watching John’s face contort into pleasure. Sherlock can see his body has never been this ready - has never wanted - Sherlock this bad before. And then Sherlock pulls his fingers out and kisses John softly.
"Sherlock, what were you doing in my room?" Still no answer from the other man. Worry lanced its way into John's gut.
Sherlock looked away and to the doorway, going into his mind palace. It would have to take at least 10 minutes.
John is close, but when Sherlock pushes his tongue inside of him and his hand, still warm and sure, wraps around John's dick, Sherlock knows he’s struggling to breathe by the rise and fall of his chest being uneven with the air leaving him.
Mycroft sat in silence for a moment, “Tell me the truth of one thing, and I’ll get you out by tonight without another comment about anything.”
His head was on Sherlock's chest, and for once, John thanked his height. He could hear the thud of Sherlock's heart.
John tugged at his hair and Sherlock moved faster then, his hand - as well as John’s, since they had to move around each other - pulled at the others clothes. He stopped after a moment, and he almost sighed when he realized he’d have to pull away.
And then Sherlock is pushing his erection against John's, and Oh god the friction felt amazing. Sherlock moved his lips down John's jaw and to his shoulder, and the he reaches down with a free hand, and firmly wraps his hand around John's cock, and strokes him.
It was soft, and Sherlock liked the feel of it. The smell of sage, and and a bit like mahogany. Sherlock continued to knead John's hair, and he could feel John stir. The smaller man let out a small puff of breath, and it brushed Sherlock's skin, causing him to shiver.
He felt angry, his chest constricting, and he had a faint pounding in his head. Although he had no idea
Mycroft nodded. He couldn't argue. He already knew how John felt about Sherlock. He sat back down, curling himself in the chair. It only took the time for Greg and Mycroft to both sit before John was almost fully asleep.
One of his normal black sleek cars, and Sherlock didn't even wait another moment  before he opened the door and quickly climbed in. And apparently the driver already knew because they began driving the moment the door was closed.
and find out what it was?" Mrs. Hudson asked. John sat for a moment and thought back. Then he set his cup down and sighed.
“You faked a death for him, Sherlock. And then after two years the moment you were in London you went back to him. Do not ask me what, dear brother,” Mycroft argues.
I am...I tried really hard to make this one good....I love you all...Thank you so much for the comments...tell me what you think...
"I know he will. He's Sherlock bloody Holmes. He always wakes up." John was shaking. He didn't know if it was fear from Sherlock not waking or anger at Mycroft and all those damned doctors.
John shuddered and tears prickled at his eyes. He pressed his palm against them and let out a ragged breath. He fucking hated Sherlock. He hated him to no extent.
He half thought about being quieter next time before sleep over took him and he curled himself into his pillow, thinking of Sherlock as he fell asleep.
Sherlock Holmes, flatmate of John Watson - 221B Baker Street and part of the Yard’s criminal questionings, is given permission to leave the city of London, England at any given time he wishes. No questions will be asked about his whereabouts after, and none is to tell of where he goes. No one shall touch Sherlock Holmes in any way, and none shall speak to him. He is given to go wherever he likes, and he shall be treated accordingly to his place, and mine.
And if he said anything, he didn’t even know it. He watched John’s tongue nervously come out, wetting his lips, and Sherlock’s mind stopped - and that was saying something.
"John," the voice was soft and John tensed. Mycroft did not speak that way. But he was now. It was wrong. Bad.
They were the only thing the boys - especially Sherlock - knew they couldn't touch. It was one of the only family heirlooms she still owned.
Kind short chapter. Love you all bunches. Sadly, next one will probably be short too... Sad face....
Sherlock tensed. Yes, he had thought about that. But he watched the man kill himself. A small voice in the back of his mind crept up,
"Why are we leaving for this? You still haven't figured out this case yet." Sherlock shook his head.
John takes in a shuddering breath, and Sherlock breaths out hard, sending a tremor through John's body.
John dropped Sherlock's hand and bent down to pick up the pan, which no longer was 'burn you skin off' hot. He sighed a threw it in the opposite sink. "Now we have nothing to eat," John mumbled under his breath and ran a hand through his hair.
He didn't think he could go a week like this. He was always tense, and his mind was always wandering, and always at the most inappropriate of times. When they were surrounded by people, or when Sherlock would actually eat and he would tell his love of the food through his throat.
It had taken almost a year for them to adopt, and when they did, they had ended up with Rosie. The young girl, although just now turning seven, already knew what was up. The day of her sixth birthday she had reached up, cupping Sherlock's face, and said 'I know you're not my real dad, but you are the one that matters'.
Sherlock began driving, and John looked out the window. He watched building pass, and then they began to disappear, until almost no houses were seen, and woods and fields took their place. It was soothing, the hum of the engine, the feel of the car driving, and the woods passing by quickly.
The last cell he’d been in had been…but she wasn’t doing this. Not this time. Because she was back in Sherrinford and she couldn’t get out. She hadn’t even tried to get out since Sherlock.
Sherlock was tense. John was sitting across from him, his head leaning against the brunette wall, his eyes closed, his lips slightly parted. He was thinking, Sherlock knew that. He had studied John for so long, he knew everything. Yet, John was still foreign to him. Sherlock wanted to kiss John. Wanted to show John he cared. But he couldn't. Because John didn't have feelings for him.
Mycroft shook his head. No. It…he looked around the room again. The vent wasn’t empty. He knew that. It was took clean to be empty. If everything else in the room was damp and dirty, why would the vent be shiny and clean? And the scratches - they were intentional. He should’ve known that - from the way they ran to how deep they were. And the chair - he walked over and he moved the chair. There was small writing on it. All over it. He knew that writing.
"They should be done by now," John turned to set his cup down before he walked over, only to be rewarded with a sharp gasp sounding and the loud clang of iron hitting linoleum. John started forward cursing, and rushed to Sherlock. The pan was on the ground, forgotten by John.
"Sherlock." A scowl crossed his face. He felt something in his chest constrict, and glanced back at John.
Sherlock goes slow, licking just John's tip. Sherlock sucks and brings his hand down to jerk John where he's not surrounded by Sherlock's hot mouth, and John buries his hands in Sherlock's hair and whines for more, head thrown back against the pillows.
John blamed the intellect on Sherlock. He taught the girl everything, and maybe, he even taught her too much. But hearing her say he was her dad had brought tears to Sherlock's eyes. It had taken just a couple months later for her to say the same to John.
John pulls in a stuttering breath, and arches his back. And Sherlock loves that stuttering breath of John’s
John nodded and reached for his own - which were some dark colour, like a navy blue mixed with some kind of lighter one - and he started on them.
"I asked his to stay and sleep with me," He cleared his throat again and took another drink of his tea.
Holmes. He was being pissed at Sherlock. For hiding that Lestrade had found a new body. Or how it had been spelling out Sherlock's name.
He was still curled up in Sherlock's side, but one of his arms was thrown over Sherlock's stomach, his fingers grazing the slip of stomach that had been released from the sheet he'd thrown over himself.
"Not about this," he answers. "You went through Moriarty and Eurus. And you still go through Mycroft. I'm not letting you into this one," he adds quietly. John nods slightly but doesn't move his hand.
And then Sherlock thrusts into him again, and John howls low and desperate, and he goes over the edge, and Sherlock swears he’s gonna lose it.
Sherlock pulled the car in front of 221B Baker street, and he felt a slight pressure in his chest ease. He looked over at John, who was still asleep. Sherlock let out a sigh, shut the car off, and opened his door, making sure to close it loud enough to wake John. He opened the back seat door, and leaned in to grab his bag, and saw John leaning back to grab his.
"You can talk to me, Sherlock," he murmured. Sherlock felt his heart pick up at the single touch and he took a deep breath looking up at John.
It was a loud thump after his that made him look up in time to see John come out from the stairwell, his eyes wide. Sherlock could see better now from the light upstairs and it was then that he realized his vision was blurry. Sherlock blinked and it took him another moment before he processed the fact that his eyes were full of tears.
Mycroft stood in the damp room, and he straightened his shirt. He wasn’t….no, his heart wasn’t beating out of his chest at all and the hand that ran through his hair wasn’t shaking. He let out a long breath and looked around the room again. It was blank, and dark, like the sun hadn’t shone into the room for….Mycroft looked around again quickly. For about three months, due to the fading on the walls where the sun had hit it at one time.
"She was murdered by her husband. She had an affair, and he walked in on it. He got mad, struck her, and she fell, hitting her head on the edge of the island. He cleaned the blood, but residue was still there. He then moved her to the butlers home. He got drunk one night, told a friend of it, and the friend told him off. Told him it was bad, and she was his wife. He should feel so much worse. So he tried to kill himself, but something happened, and he moved his hand, most likely a knock on the door, or a window being rattled. He then got a graze on the head from the bullet. He told the police it was a mugging, and that he was lucky to be alive. After she died and he failed on killing himself, he went after the woman she had an affair with. He killed her. The body was of the wife's lover." John stared at him.
John nodded and turned to the stairs that would lead up to his room. Sherlock's mind flashed to the night before. Just a one time thing. Sherlock felt his chest constrict.
John’s finger came up and curled into Sherlock’s hair, tugging at it, pulling Sherlock closer. Sherlock obliged, letting his body relax into John’s, moving his legs so they were as close as he could get them, one of them slotting between John’s. And yeah, maybe that one wasn’t an accident at all.
Sherlock had told John about the sudden case, and John had freaked. Now, they had one broken table, and new bullet holes in their wall. He didn't see why it was such a big deal.
He tried to argue and say he needed to clean the mess he'd made, but John was having none of it and Sherlock just went quiet. John pulled Sherlock to the kitchen table and made him sit. Sherlock felt a bit of a burning feeling in the palm of one of his hands and he looked down at it.
"How in the bloody hell am I suppose to prove it?" John's voice rose and he took another step closer to Sherlock.
And then he could move. He moved back, pulling John with him. The other man followed, but that didn’t stop a lot of stumbling, seeing as neither wanted to pull away and take any real lead. At least neither did yet.
"Is there anything to eat?" She heard Sherlock ask. She didn't turn around, but threw the same answer she always had over her shoulder.
The statement was simple, but John pushed himself out of the chair, moving to the small-ish kitchen. Sherlock watched as John did the preparations for tea. Bringing freshly drawn, cold water to a boil in the kettle. Standing at the stove, watching the water.
He pulled his right arm slightly, and John pushed himself further towards Sherlock. Sherlock moved his fingers through John's hair. It had grown out, since Sherlock forced John not to cut it.
John watched as the men talked. He could see the tenseness of them both, and he really hoped they'd be able to move past this. He must have been staring, because a small arm slipped into his, and he looked down to see Molly.
Martha Hudson was used to the words he would bite in anger, or the way he would stride when he was upset. She was used to it, but it still put pressure on her chest when words like that left his mouth.
"I made you some tea, Dears." She said, and John turned, his face calming. She saw him paste on a smile, and then he walked over to her. She handed him one of the cups, and he took a small drink, before he grimaced.
This wasn't as long as I hoped it would be. It took me two days to write,and it's *still* not very long. I'm sorry guys....
A crack sounded in the room, a he felt John tense beside him, a muffled sound coming from his throat. He pulled John even closer, wrapping himself around John, his heat mixing with John's.
sigh, and picked his bag up, throwing the door open. He made his way out to the car they had "borrowed" from Lestrade, and, once again, threw open the door, hoping in. Sherlock was about a minute later than John, but did the same.
No, Sherlock told himself firmly. Not here. Not in Mycroft’s office would he think of….that. Instead, he rolled his shoulders and opened the door in front of him. And of course Mycroft was exactly where Sherlock expected him to be.
Mycroft only looked down at the files in front of him. “I suppose this about the bodies found,” he more stated than questioned.
If he just told John...but he couldn't. John was his best friend. Nothing more. Even if he wanted, so much more, John didn't.
Okay, I'm so sorry it took me so long to write this. I just had a death in the family and a bunch of shit went down so it took me forever. I feel bad that I didn't get it done early, so hopefully this is good enough for you guys!
When Sherlock raised his voice, it got deeper. And lord above help him if that didn't get him all hot and bothered. But right now, he was angry at Sherlock. He was
"Sherlock, are you alright?" John's voice pulled Sherlock, and Sherlock looked away. He hadn't even realized he had looked back at John.
Sherlock looked over, and saw that John had already fallen asleep. He smiled to himself and  began humming. He hated how the waltz was always in the back of his mind. But he loved how it sounded, he loved how much he felt John when he played it or hummed it.
He turned over onto his stomach and sighed. It wasn't easy being in love with Sherlock. He had been able to feel Sherlock's skin, and he'd been able to see the curve of his cheekbones and the way his hair curled at the nape of his neck.
Sherlock is panting too, his breaths erratic as he grinds down into John. Sherlock growls, low and a little lost, and his hands fist in the sheets beside John's arms.
John shifted under the cover he'd pulled up and around himself and shuddered as he dragged the edge of his cock against the sheets.
He slowly climbed into his bed and wrapped the covers around him. He was more than tired now, his eyes fluttering closed.
Mycroft nodded and only spoke quietly "Tell him I'm sorry. I'm leaving for a while to go help with people larger than me, and I need him to know that I am," before he walked from the flat.
It took almost two months for Sherlock to even say hello to Mycroft. And it was only after John had invited him over for tea, and talked Sherlock into coming out of his room, did he turn his head to Mycroft and speak.
"About a year," he whispered. Mrs. Hudson smiled and reached over, taking his hand again. "It's nothing to be ashamed of, dear," Mrs. Hudson said. John nodded and felt his eyes water.
"I don't really need it in my line of work," Sherlock had leaned down a bit, and a shiver went through John.
"Sherlock?" Sherlock tensed. He had been about to button his trouser. He'd forgotten about John, for a moment. Sherlock turned, and immediately averted his eyes.
"We think it's your name." Sherlock bent over, picking up a dark blue shirt off the floor. A button up. He pulled open a drawer, taking a pair of trousers out.
"Why was I worried?" John flinched. "I was worried, John Hamish Watson, because you were screaming your lungs out, and I was afraid. I don't want you in here every night screaming because your scared! But you won't let me help. Let me help John."
“You’d have to pass me to get theses, Sherlock, and even I know you won’t do that,” the man says and then looks up and Sherlock finds his eyes again. “What about John?” Mycroft asks gently.
Sherlock cut that thought from his head faster than he’d done anything in his life. His brows furrowed and then he was aware he was already in a long hallway. He must’ve lost track of things when he’d been thinking of John, and thinking of John cumming, and god that unif-
Sherlock half smiled to himself and moved so John was pulled flush against him. "Of course it isn't a one time thing," he answered.
He ran a hand over his face as he laid in his bed. It was stupid. No, more than stupid. They were best friends. Of course Sherlock wouldn't feel like that about him.
And then Sherlock presses another kiss to John's shoulder and starts to move down, nosing against John's stomach, leaving soft kisses on his way. He breathes in deep against John's skin, holds his breath a little too long, and lets it rush back out in a warm puff that makes John shake.
"I can't deal with having nightmares. Not right now," John said, his voice breaking at the end. Mrs. Hudson didn't say anything, just waited for him to finish.
John stood silent for a good minute. Has he just....said that....out loud? No that...he wouldn't do that. But now Sherlock was standing there like he'd just seen Mycroft do something particularly disgusting.
Yeah, this one has more detail because...well...it’s Sherlock. Once again, I’m sorry for being gone and leaving you all on a cliffhanger. But...I give you smut to make up for that. Love you all and thank you.
A thought crossed his mind, and he rolled his hips, pushing himself against John, and at the same time, moving his leg so it to pushed against John. He shuddered and he felt the same reaction come from the man pinned under him. Except he wasn’t pinned under him, he was pinned against a wall.
Mrs. Hudson stood after a moment, and busied herself with making two cups of tea. There was one thing she always told the boys, "I'm your landlady, not your housekeeper", but she loved those boys.
Sherlock gives John's thighs attention, and he makes sure to leave marks on them. And if no one would know, but it made John’s his. And he found John’s thighs were very sensitive when Sherlock flicked his tongue over the marks.
Sorry again if this was too short. Comment, leave kudos - I thrive off of them. Tell me what you think, no matter what
John was pushed back a bit as Mrs. Hudson raced at him and gave him a hug. He let out a laugh and hugged her back. He pulled away when he heard Sherlock move up the stairs. Well...more like stomp up the stairs.
Sherlock takes his time as he breathes deep and nuzzles into John, his dick hard and pulsing inside of John. He's filling John up so perfectly, like they are both made for this.
John can't help the pathetic whines that claws there way out of his throat, the way his hands fly up and grip Sherlock's upper arms, the way his legs start to tremble around Sherlock.
Sherlock knew that. But it didn't change anything. It didn't change the way Sherlock would stare, taking in every aspect of John when he was engrossed in something, like one of his books.
And he wouldn't think about the smile he got when Lestrade came over with a new murder. Or how when Molly (tried) to hit on Sherlock, he would always turn to John for some reason, as if asking
So he stayed, and he didn't sleep, and he made sure John at least got something of sleep. He ignored Greg's protests to stay; he had to.
Sherlock turned at the last possible moment when the reached room. He was pretty sure it was his since they hadn’t hit any stairs. He barely moved away when John hit the bed, only to move his hands down to John’s hips and move him up further onto the bed.
John sighed as he set the bags by the door, only to have Sherlock come from his room, holding his bag as well. John let out
"I didn't do a thing, Mrs. Hudson," he said, as she began to move to the low table and sit down. She sighed and pushed a cup of tea to him, and he smiled, taking it.
John keens, and his fingers scratch down Sherlock's back, until he'd holding Sherlock's ass, pulling him deeper, and harder.
Oh my god. I feel so *so* bad because I couldn't post anything lately. I...it's been forever it seems since I updated. Im so so sorry I haven't been able to for a while. But...here you are.
He looks back up and he smiled gently when he saw John was doing to same thing to him - looking at him and taking in every aspect.
"It's not up to you what I can and can't get into," John says. Sherlock looked up at him again - he'd down casted his eyes after a moment of silence between them.
The older brother got up, straightened his shirt vest and his tie and then walked forward until he was in front of his desk and he leaned back against it. He tilted his head a bit as if trying to read or see through Sherlock. After a moment of this he gently sighed - again, with the gently? - and he fixed a piercing gaze on Sherlock. “Are you in love with John Watson?”
He rushed up the stairs and threw the door open....and his heart sped up even further, his chest rising and falling fast, his mouth agape.
He went through everything again in his head until he was running in circles and had no where else to go. So...he came out of it and winces right away. He looked down at his hand to see a white bandage around his palm and wrist. He looked up to see John sitting at one of the chairs.
He counted each beat, and it sounded like music to John's ears. He was in love. Indefinitely. With Sherlock Holmes. But never mind that, because the beats had slowed to a rhythm. And the rhythm was lulling. Like a lullaby.
“There is no warning sufficient for that,” Sherlock gestured to John’s cock as he laid back on the bed, “it should come with a siren and flashing lights.”
“Only.”  Sherlock said dryly, shifting as the huge toy sunk deeper inside.  “Have you ever used it before?”
“It’s too late in your heat for that.”  John shouted.  Sherlock looked so saddened that John softened.  “You really hate this, don’t you?”
“Come on.  Let’s get you more comfortable.”  John said gently.  He helped Sherlock up.  Sherlock clung to him as they staggered towards the bedroom.
Then, just to see what would happen he let his cock bob up past Sherlock’s balls and holding himself down against Sherlock’s belly he pushed his hips foreword to see how deep his cock would penetrate.  His mouth went dry at the sight.
The air huffed out of Sherlock as John thrust his knot inside.  The orgasm it triggered in Sherlock was intense and instantaneous.  He shook and quivered and shouted as his body clamped down on the intrusion as John thrust, shallow and fast, chasing his own release.  Sherlock was at the point of over sensitivity and oxygen depletion, his body in shock as John’s knot expanded further as John came.
John relinquished the cup and left Sherlock to consume the steaming drink.  John finished up his toast and nursed his tea as it cooled.  He wondered how Sherlock could be drinking his own so quickly while it was still so hot.  He ran his eyes along the beautiful naked body beside him.  He couldn’t believe the turn this day had taken.  Describing it as a rollercoaster barely went far enough.  His cock gave a twitch in his pants as the thought of the three, or was it, four rounds of great sex that they had already had.  Better yet, there was surely more to come.  Maybe with the help of the toy, he’d be able to sink in in one thrust.
There was a muttered sting of words John couldn’t make out over a small racket that sounded like Sherlock was scrambling to grab something, but he knew Sherlock was swearing.  Then, louder, Sherlock called for him to come in.
Sherlock froze trapped between pleasure and fear.  John’s cock was so big.  The pain still so fresh.  He knew this would hurt.  He wanted the soft ecstasy to remain; the blissed-out relief of release.
“I’ll be here for you when you’re ready, if you want me.”  John said, with a hint of doubt in his voice.
Sherlock sighed at the feeling of the cock rotating deep within his body.  John sympathised.  It felt uniquely incredible.  His cock throbbed with a weak effort to produce more come.  John kept rolling Sherlock until he was on his chest.  His legs hanging from the bed and John was pressed tight against his bum.
“I hate being ruled by my body,” Sherlock said, and then gesturing at John’s huge erect cock, precome glistening from the place where the ring went into his urethra, “and that’s freaking intimidating.”
John stretched his fingers as far into his body as he could and repeated the movement.  Felt the nodule, rubbed around it.  Making Sherlock moan and buck against his hand.
“No.”  Sherlock said and he meant it.  “Do you think we will?  Afterwards?  Do you think it will be weird?”
Sherlock turned his head to look at him, his cheek wrinkled with the impression of the pillow.  “Did she tell us to keep the noise down; to burn a candle?”
“I won’t hurt you,” John said with a shake of his head, but even as he spoke, he pushed forward, driven by primal drives to take.  To fuck.  To plunder.
“He wanted it to hurt.”  Sherlock whispered in a voice so quiet that John could barely hear him.  “He made sure it did.  I think that is why I panicked earlier; brought back some… difficult memories.”
John’s desire was back stronger than ever.  Every debauched fantasy he had ever had while surrounded by the smell of this Fake Slick was combined with the sight of Sherlock writhing before him.  When John dared to slip in the third finger Sherlock was still tight.  It was unusual.  Omegas were never this tight after penetration.  Especially after two hard goes on John’s monster cock.  Not even the drugs Sherlock had taken could explain this.  John worked and scissored his fingers until he could feel the muscles start to soften.  He took is time despite his own raging desire.  From time to time his used his slick fingers to rub the head of his own cock for relief.  The warming lube a tingling contrast to the cool room.  When Sherlock had opened up a little more, he used both his thumbs to stretch him apart in all directions and then two fingers from each hand to do the same.
“Fuck.”  Sherlock said.  Eyes wide, pupils huge as he reached out and ran his thumb along the ring to where it entered John’s slit.  “That’s what, 10 millimetres diameter?”
Still fingering the edge of his opening, John rocked the toy ever so slightly.  Sherlock’s cock bobbed and his hole shuddered and clenched.  Again, John repeated the movement, feeling the changes in Sherlock’s opening as the toy moved within him.
John pushed in.  Just the bulbuls ring entered Sherlock.  Sherlock whimpered as the ridged coolness of the piercing popped inside.
John ran his hands down Sherlock’s long thighs, from his knee to his crotch.  Then he tentatively rubbed the pads of his fingers over Sherlock’s opening.  Sherlock choked on his breath.  John was worried; despite how wet he was, despite the scent indicating that he was well into his cycle, he was still completely closed up.
John knew.  He could see the signs: the flushed look in Sherlock’s face, the heat from his body.  He could smell them too: the increased scent.  The things it did to him.  “I want you Sherlock.  I want you so bad.”
Sherlock was silent so long John thought that he hadn’t heard him, or that he wasn’t going to answer.  “While I was away.”
Sherlock shook his head slightly.  “I didn’t think you’d come in.  I expected you to go off to work.  I thought I’d have to go through this alone.”
“I’m not sure this is going to work.”  John said doubtfully.  “After years of not being used your body will have lost some elasticity.”
Sherlock nodded unsure but curious.  Maybe it would help.  It was about the same size as John.  But more intimidating somehow, maybe because of the colour, maybe because of the large, flared head.
“Maybe.”  John was not sure if he was asking or agreeing.  This had all been a lot to take in.  He wanted to lie down.  His legs were shaking.  The angles were all wrong.  There was no way without crushing Sherlock.  And either way, their legs would be hanging off the mattress.  He should have thought this through better.  They would be locked together for ages.
“Scented lube.”  John said with a smile, then read the label, “Fake Slick – for Alphas without an Omega.”
Sherlock moaned into the sheets.  “I’ll hate it, I’ll hate it more than ever now that I have taken the synthetic hormones, but you need to keep going, no matter what I say or do.  I need you to promise me that.”
“I can do this myself, you know?”  Sherlock trapped John’s hands and the cup and pulled both back towards his lips.
“I’m going to break this door down if you don’t tell me you’re ok.”  John said with rising fear that he would find Sherlock collapsed on the floor.  How long had he slept?  Had Sherlock collapsed through neglect, through injury, had he really been far too rough?
John helped Sherlock to put his feet up on the edge of the mattress.  His knees falling apart naturally.  Sherlock’s natural scent increased making John dizzy.  He dropped to his knees to get closer to scent.  His cock throbbed achingly.
Sherlock strained and groaned.  John continued to push forwards.  His cock throbbed and twitched as he watched his thumb slip inside along with the rest of his fingers.  Sherlock’s body sucking him in all the way to his wrist.
“Perhaps, but you did just sleep through part of your shift, so you have to take some responsibility.”
John sat and watched over him for a moment.  Let him get comfortable, then, seeing him settle he lent off the edge of the bed to grab the discarded towel.  He used one of the dry clean corners to give himself a quick wipe over, then used the other clean corner to clean Sherlock up as best he could.  Moving slowly and gently, knowing that the Omega would be sensitive to the towels rough texture.  Sherlock shifted again; the dildo slipping out.  John caught it before is slithered all the way free.  He pushed it back in.  Sherlock making a little surprised noise at the size of the shifting intrusion.
Eventually John slowed his rapid thrusts and tucked his thumb close.  He pressed forward with is hand, waiting for Sherlock’s body to give the way it was supposed to.  Sherlock moaned deeply.  John’s hand did not advance.
It took all John’s strength to punch inside.  Sherlock wailed through another release.  His body clamping down.  It was the trigger for John’s own release.  Come pumping along his cock as he shoved his way deeper inside.  The ring slowing the ejaculation.  Plugging and prolonging the orgasm.  Making sure John felt every bit pulse along his shaft.  Pumping into the spaceless dark heat of Sherlock’s womb.  Both of them twitched through it.
John turned back to him and gently guided him to sit on the edge of the bed.  Stepping forwards between his thighs, he bent and kissed him again.  It was slow and smouldering this time, but an undercurrent of nervousness tainted it.  The reality of this was suddenly apparent to both of them.  John nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck, breathing in the smell of him.  “Did you prepare yourself while you were in the shower?”
John ran his knuckles over the curved mound of Sherlock’s arse.  Fingers ghosting across his lower back.  Skin shivering at his touch.  He traced the little nubs of spine, up then down.  The long muscles his spine.  The shorter ones across his shoulders.  The sliver scars.  The thickness of the skin changing beneath his fingertips where the damage had been inflicted.
Sherlock looked at him, questions written in his eyes.  John groped over the bed.  Sherlock’s eyes following his movements, until John held up the most obscenely large dildo Sherlock had ever seen.  It was ludicrous even by the standards of the Omega satisfying tools sold at Deep and Wide.
His confused body shuddered and is abdomen clamped down with aching cramps as he listened to John run up the stairs to his bedroom.  He was panting by the time John came back in and knelt between his splayed knees.  Sherlock took no notice of the things John dumped on the bed beside him.  He needed something inside him now.
Over time he felt John’s dick soften.  The giant is sleeping, he thought, just like its master.  He played with the idea of ripping free.  Was it worth it to wake John?  Would he be angry?  An angry Alpha was not much fun to deal with, and he knew, all too well, how John struggled with his anger.
“An alpha did these.  I’ve seen ones like this before, while I was deployed.”  It was never a good thing to see.  Omegas taken by force, the unwanted Alphas asserting dominance through violence.  The victims traumatised.  Sherlock didn’t say anything, didn’t deny it. Just turned his face away.  John read so much in that movement.  “You weren’t in heat when these happened were you?”
The Fake Slick was thick and silky, smoother than what his own body had ever provided.  Soon John was slipping in two fingers easily.  Sherlock undulated his hips in time with John’s strokes.
John paused.  “Do you want me to stop?”  God, he hoped not.  He was so on edge.  He wanted to keep going forever.
The toy started to move again.  More insistent now.  Sucking and squelching at his opening.  John’s free hand stroking his cock in slow motion as the toy sped up.  Sherlock’s legs were shaking, he couldn’t take a full breath, whether from the toy’s depth or his clenched tight muscles, he did not know.  Coiled tight, right on the edge of orgasm.  The hand moved slower, the toy faster.  If a single braincell had been functioning on any level about animal driven bliss, he would have admired John’s coordination.
Their chest pressed together, and Sherlock wined at the rough feeling of John’s shirt against his sensitive skin.  He pulled back just enough to get one hands between them to flick the buttons open and shove the shirt back from John’s broad shoulders.  Sherlock pressed forwards again.  Skin against skin for the first time.  Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth.  The taste and smell of him was enhanced by the proximity and his lust.  It was sending Sherlock half mad with desire.  He needed more.  Slotting a knee between John’s thighs he hoped that John would return the favour.  He needed friction.
John didn’t say that people fuck outside of heats, because he knew that was not the way Sherlock thought about things.  He even seemed somewhat reluctant now that he was in heat.  “Jesus.  I’m sorry. I would have taken it slower if I knew.”
Sherlock moaned at the contact to his sensitive balls.  John’s piercing cool as ice against his feverish skin.  “Don’t tease, John.  It isn’t fair.”
Sherlock’s climax finished first.  His brain screamed - too much, too painful.  Unable to breathe; tied and trapped in all directions.  He thrashed senselessly.  His mind taking him back to a time where the feeling of being trapped was a reality.  He fought the restrains just as he had then.  The burn of the rope on his wrists insignificant in comparison to the burn of his stretched-out insides.  The rough relentless fucking and the hot body against his back reminding of another that had torn pleasure from his unwilling body and mind.  The flashback was vivid in the pain and immobility of the moment.
“Not yet, let me get you ready first.”  John knew that if Sherlock saw him before he was delirious with heat and desire, he would get more nervous about what was to come.  John needed him relaxed.
Sherlock felt the knot catch in his rim and then stop the next thrust short.  The stretch was already tremendous.  He could not imagine more.  John’s shallower thrusts let him catch his breath and he felt light-headed from oxygen.  “So good.  Feels so, so good.”
John turned Sherlocks face back towards him, pressed a chase kiss against his lips and brushed the curls back from Sherlock’s face.  He could see the sweat already beading on his forehead.  “I can’t wait.”
“I thought I was going completely mad.”  Sherlock said, sinking back into the bed, boneless and spent as John disconnected the plunger and removed himself from the bed to get a washcloth to take care of the mess.
“Faster John.” Sherlock requested in desperate little gasps.  His eyes scrunched shut.  Head tipped back.  Hands moving to grip John’s arse and pull him deeper.  He needed more.  He was teetering on the edge.  His body moulded around John’s cock.  His toes scrunched.  A twist of John’s hand made him shudder.  Gasp.
Sherlock sighed; he didn’t want John’s pity.  Then, distracted, he gasped as Fake Slick and come ran from him.  John’s knot had quickly gone soft.  Too spent to remain hard.  They separated slowly.  Untangling.  Stretching over used limbs.  Sherlock moved to get up, but John took his hand, pulled him back down.
Sherlock got up slowly.  Holding the towel, that was discarded earlier, against himself to keep from dripping sperm and mucous down his legs and across the floor.  Every movement hurt and he his knees felt weak as he wobbled in staggering steps towards the bathroom.  The click of the bathroom door sounded like a gunshot, but once it was closed and locked, he felt free.  His mind was clearer now that he was away from the scent of the Alpha.
“You don’t want to?”  Sherlock said with a feeling of disappointment that threatened to dampen even the strongest drive within him.  If John declined, he was in for a hell of a heat.  If John declined, what did that mean for them?  Would things be forever awkward; now that Sherlock had put him in this position?
He showered under water hot enough to scald.  Washing away everything either dried or damp.  Washing away memories.  Using the handheld shower head to force water deep into places that needed cleansing.  He washed three times in neutralising body wash.
“You’re so big, John.”  Sherlock gritted out.  The feeling was all consuming and overwhelming.  He could think of nothing but the stretch.  He was sure it was only his imagination, but he thought he could feel the hard steel tracking up high into his abdomen.
Silence sat between them.  Long.  The shadows shifter as the clouds passed over the weak sunshine.  John finished his tea.  Nursed the mug.  Held his hand.
When his hand cramped, he told Sherlock he was going to pull out for a moment.  John attached the deep applicator, a tool that was designed to be used when Alphas had intercourse with betas or other Alphas.  John had bought it as there was no way he could penetrate any of his beta girlfriends without flooding them with lube.  He had never imagined he might get to use it on Sherlock’s deep tight channel.  He slid the long smooth metal applicator as deep into Sherlock’s body was it would go and then pumped lube into him.  Sherlock’s mouth fell open at the sensation.  John kept pumping.  Sherlock’s eyes went wide.
