“Apparently, the opponents friend was smarter, stronger, better than either the man or the opponent had realized. He rose from the dead, and launched a counter attack on the man, all while keeping his friend in the dark.
They didn’t talk about Sherlock often, but there didn’t seem to be any rule between them, or at least any rule that Mary seemed to care to adhere to that dictated that Sherlock was someone-who-should-not-be-named. And maybe there was a good reason Mary had been so casual about him, because now John could hear Sherlock’s name be mentioned without feeling like he’d been hit by a truck. Which was definitely a good thing considering he didn’t want anyone to only have to drop the S-word to be able to leave John completely disarmed emotionally and probably physically as well.
Adrenaline junkie, sharp shooting, stubborn, bad ass soldier John. Highly trained, unassuming genius John. Monstrous John?
"Give it time Sherlock. We're doing all we can to get him here." Victor said softly, clearly reading Sherlock with ease.
It nearly killed him, every single time he had remembered this the past two weeks that he had been with Sherlock.
All at once his restraint collapsed. Any thoughts he may have had about how seeing John for the first time would go flew out the window, as he stepped forward and grabbed John's face, and pulled him into a kiss.
“It was nothing. Just threatened me a bit. It didn’t seem relevant. I had hoped if I ignored it, I would be fine,” John admitted hesitantly.
Faintly, Sherlock heard the vibrations of a phone, but couldn’t bring himself to really process much of anything.
“If the medical examiner has already been there, I don’t see what help I could be. I’m not trained in pathology. If you want a second opinion, call Molly. And you’re a chemist, who at this point could probably sit the FRCPath exam and pass without even considering the possibility of revising for it, Sherlock. Between all of you I’m sure you can sort it out without me. I’ll order some take-out to have for you when you get back,” John said.
Sherlock suddenly found himself wishing that John had just been sleeping with someone else. It was far less a betrayal than this.
“You’ve been smoking,” Sherlock said simply after turning to face Lestrade, “Which usually could just mean a row with your wife,
“Could be in Thailand for all we honestly know. We can’t go boarding ships without any reason to just because you’ve come up with a theory.”
“No. That’s not what Moriarty does. He organizes criminals, he doesn’t tear them down. And if they get out of line, he kills them. That’s what the whole case with,” Sherlock stopped. That’s what John had been doing, helping Moriarty dispose of men who were no longer of use to him. But he couldn’t say that. “No move he has ever made in the past would indicate that this has anything to do with him.”
Moriarty had gone back to stroking John’s jaw and John continued to try and figure out what the fuck was going on. But he couldn’t. In fact the worst part was that what Moriarty was saying in a way made sense, in a twisted way. Putting aside the very obvious fact that his and Moriarty’s moralities obvious did not match up, it was a decent proposal for a future for John when he otherwise couldn’t imagine one.
It was all Sherlock could think to do, when he finally came to his senses and was fairly horrified and embarrassed at his own actions, or lack of them. John was….gone. But Moriarty was out there still. And so Sherlock had checked his phone to find a message from one Jane Huxley. He was surprised that he had gotten the call, usually clients called John as it was his number attached to the blog that had been gaining annoying amounts of attention at an increasing and alarming rate. But Sherlock’s number was posted on his own website, and he supposed a desperate woman could have easily missed the news that the reason the number listed on the blog wasn’t working was because it and its owner had been sunken into the Thames, and instead sought out an alternative way of contacting.
But Mary now knew at this point not to bother arguing with John anymore about concerns for his safety. All those months ago there was a sense that she needed to protect John, from himself and the world. But now John was more or less the most feared man in the world among certain circles, and was virtually unrecognizable. Skin tanned and hair bleached lighter than it had even been in the UK from the sun of warmer climates, beard still intact with rather shaggy hair that while he couldn’t bear the feeling of growing much past his ears he hadn’t had time to otherwise keep up, and a muscular build to match months upon months of what had seemed to be near constant hand to hand combat, wall scaling, and parkour level chases that made him appear much bigger than he used to, even without any added height. John was now, mentally and physically, a very different man.
He’d considered not going quite this out of the way. There were of course ways to get illicit substances without going instantly too far into throws of addiction right away, but clearly the more casual approach, the picking a few grams on a street corner, locking himself away in his flat, and digging out his old equipment from where he’d hidden it under the floorboards, was not going to work. Too many people to come by unannounced and drag him off to rehab, assuming he could even manage to get the drugs without interruption in the first place, as had become a problem.
good. So the man decided to use friend to his advantage. He kidnapped him and gave him a mission. He turned this friend into a butcher of sorts, or maybe a tailor, and it was marvelous. The work he did, the trouble he caused. All while the opponent knew nothing about the betrayal of his friend. But soon enough, the friend stopped being of use to the man. But of course, you already know this part. You know what the friend did, you know that when he ran out of usefulness the man drowned him in a river. Or tried to anyway.” Moriarty paused, waiting for Sherlock to process the news.
Irene Adler was certainly an interesting character, John had discovered while he’d learned more and more about the self-proclaimed dominatrix. And while John tried not to let his mind think of himself and Sherlock as a
“That’s what I worry about, Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “I fear that John may have run out of use, and that he may dispose of John, just as he had John and his partner disposed of the body that you saw.”
“I asked Seb to come along to help, just in case you’re suddenly feeling a bit rebellious today, but I don’t imagine that I’ll even need him just yet. You’ll let yourself be shackled and hung from the ceiling just because I ask you to, won’t you Johnny-boy?” Moriarty was so unnecessarily close to John now, he could whisper the words in his ear as he stood behind John. His fingers traced along the back of John’s shoulders and then across his chest to rub a hand across John’s collar bone. Then his hands were suddenly on John’s back and John was shoved forwards, away from him and towards the center of the room.
“He left the scene at about 3 o’clock yesterday afternoon, so he’s been gone for about 22 hours,” Lestrade reported.
“Personally, I’m the kind of man who likes to pull out teeth or finger nails, or maybe even skip right to cutting off entire fingers. But boss said I couldn’t dismember you in any way, fuck if I know why. so I’ve brought something else to play with."
“Oh, John.” There it was again. That tone of voice. John couldn’t bear it. He couldn’t stand this anymore. This couldn’t be happening. Not this, not now. But before his mind could spin itself in any more frantic circles, Sherlock’s lips crashed into his and suddenly John could think of nothing else.
“So I can break bones while naming them,” John said casually, although inwardly he was well pleased.
The ride to the crime scene was silent. Lestrade had given Sherlock the address and had taken his car and John and Sherlock sat alone in the back of a cab. Sherlock racked his brain trying to figure out reasons why John was behaving so oddly, but none of the data pointed to any sort of conclusive answer, or even a reasonably good guess. Sherlock had always liked that John was unpredictable. The fact that he didn’t follow the usual patterns of human behavior all the time, but not in a way that was the typical deviant either, had always made him interesting to Sherlock. But now it was driving Sherlock insane.
“Ah, there it is,” Moriarty murmured once the left side of John’s jaw was uncovered revealing the long scar, now surely glaring red and inflamed. Moriarty continued, making quick work of the other half of John’s face, removing what had taken months to grow in under a half an hour.
After spending some time involuntarily running an inventory of his injuries, John realized that he was alone, and that he was going to die, and that he would in fact have to let those facts stew in his mind for an entire day. John slowly began to work himself into a panic as he considered it, but thankfully the panic combined with the blood loss caused him to lose consciousness again.
“So go find John, bring him in for questioning to see if he can give us any information on Moriarty, and then process him accordingly. Bring me a file when you’ve finished that. I’m sure there is no need for you to be here anymore,” Sherlock said dismissively before he huffed again and released his knees, leaning over the coffee table to pick up a small dish of fingernails that he’d been observing for an experiment.
“No,” he scoffed. “He’s made it very clear he needs nor wants anything from me.” Sherlock folded his arms across his chest and sat down in his arm chair with a huff, casting a glare at John’s chair across from him.
John was silent as he considered the information. Sherlock had certainly never mentioned Victor. But then, he never mentioned his past much at all. John got the sense that it was troubled. He knew about his problematic relationship with his brother, his drug use, and his general feeling that the world was often simultaneously overwhelming and boring because of how his brain worked. But other than that John had assumed that Sherlock would tell him things when he wanted or trusted him to know them. Victor must have fallen into the category of things that Sherlock didn't feel was relevant to John. But knowing now that Sherlock had someone like Victor looking out for him during university, in any capacity, was comforting to him. He hated the thought of a nineteen year old Sherlock, feeling tortured and alone and driven out of his mind by stimuli that overwhelmed him, shooting up in his dorm room or in the back of clubs to try and numb the world.
John was reeling. Sherlock hadn’t said much, but it was certainly more than he’d ever said before. This couldn’t be happening. Not now. It wasn’t fair to either of them.
He’d given up finding it at night, heading out to those parts of town where he knew he could get what he wanted at any hour, but Mrs. Hudson would snag him before he could make his way out of 221, demanding tea. Or he’d get a text from Lestrade claiming he was needed down at the Yard, but upon Sherlock’s eager arrival, was only handed him a stack of paperwork that needed Sherlock’s signature. He nearly got halfway across town to his destination once before a black car showed up, Mycroft tucked inside with a knowing look on his face, but thankfully he did not voice any suspicions he may have had.
“Right,” Lestrade grumbled. “Well let’s get on with it then,” he said, stepping through the entrance of the building. Sherlock eagerly followed and then quickly took the lead.
John’s initial scream had faded into groans and grunts, but this still seemed to please Moriarty, who stood before John again grinning.
“Belief has nothing to do with this, it’s the truth. I’m not interested in wasting time on John, I want to bring down Moriarty. John is nothing in Moriarty’s network, just a tool for Moriarty to use!”
“So I’d stay dead. Moriarty, Lestrade, Mycroft, Sh—,” John’s voice broke, “Sherlock, they would all still think I’m dead. But I’d help you. So that when the time is right Sherlock can make his move and take Moriarty down once and for all.”
They sat in silence as they watched as police and coastguard boats began to swarm the steadily sinking vessel. Sherlock sat very still, back erect and hands gripping his thighs, like he was physically trying to hold himself together. Mycroft slowly raised his hand from his own lap and placed it over one of Sherlock’s.
The second he’d agreed, the second he hadn’t told Sherlock everything once he was away from Moriarty, he’d transferred his life from Sherlock to Moriarty.
them. I’m doing to redeem them, Johnny. All of them John, not just the ones whose faces you ruined. I WANT TO HEAR YOU SCREAM!”
Sherlock held John’s gaze for a few seconds, trying to make John see how earnest he was being. John turned his head away violently, breaking eye contact with Sherlock.
Only then could he wrap skull in a thick layer of skin that he’d cut from another corpses back, carefully stitching the skin graft into place, wiping away any other chance they had of being identifiable.
He believed in love, in the sense that love didn’t exactly have a set definition so if someone said they felt it than they probably did. He had been beginning to think that he could be one of those people who claimed to be in love.
“I only smoke menthols when Harrison’s around because they piss him off, even more than regular ones. The man is obsessive with his health and the health of everyone around him. Won’t shut up about all the ways I’m killing myself when he only needs to focus on how the victim was killed, mind you. I usually don’t let him on the scene until after I’ve left, but I can’t do that because of the nature of this case. But if I have to talk to him face to face rather than just read his report, I might as well try and give him lung cancer while I’m at it,” Lestrade shrugged. “How you knew that before I even stepped into the room, I don’t even care to know anymore.”
“Oh, that. Of course you’re curious. I mean, that whole thing was a bit of a lie, I guess, though don’t tell your friends at the Yard that, yeah? A friend of mine, old co-worker, was calling in a favor. I’ve always been good at picking locks, something I learned from you actually. I was just supposed to look around, grab a file. Not something I usually get involved in. I’m glad it’s all been sorted out. I just didn’t want to have to compromise my friend. Could have been dangerous for him, you know. Really good guy, just a bit unlucky I guess.”
Sherlock’s world shattered into a million tiny pieces. It was like he’d been slapped in the face. By a steam roller.
When he heard John’s phone buzz from across the room, he held his breath hoping that whoever was on the other end of the message John had just received had something even just vaguely interesting to say.
“Moriarty may be a criminal mastermind, but mostly he’s an actor. Always loved the theatrics. All he needs is to be outperformed,” John said cryptically. “Do you trust me?”
If Sherlock had been a different man, perhaps he would have taken all of these interventions as a sign. But Sherlock did not believe in any sort of world order. There was no fate or destiny. Notions like “soul mates” where just societal ideas that encouraged the continuation of the traditional family model. It was a ridiculous concept that relationships were built of innate bonds rather than common interests and time and sexual attraction.
“We’ll get the doctor in here soon and he can run through everything with you, then we can talk, alright? I’ll go see if I can track down Victor,” the woman laid her hand over his and smiled gently at him, holding eye contact with him until John turned away, unable to handle the sympathetic look.
“Business has been a little... slow. Hardly any at all. Seven, maybe eight,” Moran answered gruffly.
“Awake again, Johnny? You didn’t really think I was done with you yet, did you?” John heard Moriarty chide from somewhere in the distance and he snapped his focus back to the situation at hand. He looked up to see the other man a few meters in front of him sitting at a large wooden desk. He was reclining back in a swiveling desk chair and he had his feet propped up on the table. It looked like John was still in the same vast, high ceiling-ed room that he was before, but now he was turned the other direction, revealing what looked to be a makeshift laboratory and office. Metal folding tables were set up around the edges of the large room and were littered with stacks of books and paper, as well as a variety of equipment, some more sinister looking than others. Moriarty sat in the middle of it all, grinning at John with a look of confidence that was deeply disturbing to John. He looked like a king ruling over all of the laboratory supplies that surrounded him.
Sherlock sighed. He didn’t understand how this could be helpful, but since he had nothing else to go on with the Moriarty case and he was too distracted by John to be able to think clearly, he supposed it at least couldn’t hurt.
“Watson, I know you’re awake. Ready for round two, soldier?” at Moran’s voice John took the opportunity to let out a groan that he’d been holding in and he snapped open his eyes.
“Really Sherlock, we don’t have time for you to pout because you got something wrong. It happens to the best. What we need to do is find John. I’m worried about him.”
“You said we wouldn’t have to go abroad,” John groaned. “In fact, that was one of the first things you told me. ‘All of the people Moriarty has abroad are big fish who the second they realize Moriarty’s home network has been disassembled they’ll drop him,’” John rambled, vaguely trying to impersonate a woman’s voice but failing miserably as he very roughly paraphrased their first meeting.
Five days and Mycroft sent in doctors and psychiatric specialists, trying anything to get Sherlock to respond, or at least determine if there was any treatable reason for Sherlock’s seeming absence from his body. They eventually started him on benzodiazepine.
Sherlock was only half listening. He knew that this information must be important, so he wasn’t completely shutting the information out. But most of his mind was reeling.
“Once upon a time there was a man who wasn’t quite like everyone else. He had dreams bigger than everyone else seemed to be able to fathom. Life was easy for him, though, despite having to exist in a world of imbeciles, because it turns out, the idiotic masses are quite easy to control. And there was nothing the man loved more than control.
“LOOK AT ME!” Moriarty suddenly screamed at John, completely unprovoked. John snapped his head up reflexively.
Perched was the best way to describe it, John thought, as he looked up at the other man from the medical journal he was reading. He was squatted with his feet on the seat of the chair, elbows resting on his knees, and his chin resting against his steepled fingers. He managed to look both like someone who was in a pose for meditation and like panther, albeit a gangly one, ready to pounce. But then John supposed that being anything but a contradiction at all times would be far too boring for Sherlock.
“The--? Look Sherlock, if you take a moment and explain I’m sure we can get a whole team of people together to research whatever it is you’re after.”
There had to be something he could do. It’s not like people usually parked narrow boats on the middle of the Thames in central London. If one had showed up, it would stick out like a sore thumb and some boating enthusiast with little else to do with their time but obsess about useless hobbies would notice and post a picture on some forum for boating enthusiasts and the police would find it and head down to wherever said boat was parked with a warrant and John would be rescued.
But most alarmingly, the man didn’t have a face. There were no eyes, nose, mouth, just a smooth layer of skin. The skin dipped where the eye sockets were, along with the mouth. The cartilage off the nose had been removed as well, causing another dip in the skeleton where it should have been.
But rather than using his information for protection, Huxley had become paranoid. Huxley had turned to old habits in desperation for money, and had managed to horribly muck up a mugging, ultimately killing his victim. The victim, infuriatingly, was a man from somewhere Sherlock had deleted where in eastern Europe, and was in the UK on falsified papers and was rumored to be a trained assassin.
“You’re late, Watson,” a gruff voice snapped at him the second he reached the bottom step and found himself in the dimly lit main room for the boat. A man was sat in a particularly dark corner, going previously unnoticed by John.“The boss is mad.”
The groans that came from deep within Sherlock’s chest seemed to vibrate through John and all at once he was pushed over the edge. John tried to keep pumping Sherlock as his orgasm coursed through him, but he couldn’t get his limbs to cooperate. Thankfully, Sherlock seemed to understand, or was just too close to tolerate John’s complete uselessness, and began to thrust his hips, fucking John’s fist until he came, collapsing on top of John.
"The situation is delicate. I assume you have trusted us on that, because if you didn't I have no doubt in my mind you would have already tracked down John on your own," he smiled fondly, which was inexplicable to Sherlock. "But he's doing well. He's already up and walking, albeit very stiffly and slowly. Give it a couple more days Sherlock."
“You think I don’t remember you? The only reason I hired you was because of your connection to Sherlock, obviously. I thought you might be useful at some point, but then you scurried off and I had better things to do than track you down. But this game of mine, with him, has been going on for ages. But my how things have changed now, haven’t they?”
to understand Michael Huxley and everything that was going on. He flung open the door to a bedroom at the back of the flat at the end of the short hallway.
“Maybe I was wrong about the coercion, or at least the level to which it was done. Perhaps we should consider the possibilities of criminals who might have coincidentally trained as surgeons. But no wait, if I were Moriarty, and I wanted a surgeon, how would I go about it? Yes, that’s what we should do! I’ll just think like Moriarty. I hadn’t considered such an amateur approach with Moriarty because I assumed he’d account for my usual deduction methods and make his decisions with a level of randomness to counteract them, but maybe that was the wrong assumption. He likes things that are a bit like kismet, doesn’t he? So it shouldn’t be too difficult. Moriarty doesn’t want to commit the perfect crime, after all, at least not at this stage. That would be far too boring.” Sherlock had gotten up from his chair and was pacing again, his mind already set up on the new plan that
“Don’t you understand I have to do this? The message was for me! If you’d just shut up for a second and stop harassing me--!”
Sherlock remained seated on the floor. He thought he may have gone into shock, or something. None of his limbs would move.
“Oh, of course I’m wrong, says the genius. Tell me something new!” John snarled and threw his arms up in the air. He was eager to break the stillness that had fallen over the room. It was far too serious, and he couldn’t bear that right now. It felt like it did when occasionally Sherlock was going to say something that was far too raw and actually mean it. Those moments were rare, and while John usually cherished them, he couldn’t handle one of them right now, not after everything that had just happened.
John sighed in defeat and managed to shimmy the thoroughly mussed duvet down far enough that he could slide his bare legs and hips under it.
on me?” Sherlock’s mind worked frantically to put all the pieces together. “Wait, no, it’s the other way around, isn’t it? That’s why you kept hesitating. Because you were already with someone else. You cheated on them,
“What I had Seb do to you seems inconsequential now though, so I suppose you shouldn’t get all the credit. I see you’re hiding the bit I’m most proud of though, my
, Sherlock’s mind supplied, making the connection. “I don’t have time to argue about this anymore. I don’t doubt that this time Moriarty’s not going to have the same rules he did last time about permanent damage. Are you coming or not?”
“But the opponent had a partner, a friend of sorts, that seemed to be in the way. The man wanted the opponent all to himself, to toy with and crush. But this friend distracted the opponent. Made him
And there was nothing that he would ever be able to do about it, no matter how much time he spent in his mind palace or how intelligent he was.
“What,” John rasped, taking fast and deep breaths as soon as it seemed like the water was all out of his lungs, “the fuck is going on?”
“I’d never let you get bored again, darling. I’m like Sherlock, but better. None of that silly human stuff to mess everything up, right? You don’t think you can ever go back to the way things were with him, even if you walked out of here and I fired a bullet into Seb’s and then my own brain and ended it all. Because you
Sherlock’s mind began to spin. How had he been so foolish? How had he let his judgement become so clouded? Where had John gone yesterday? How long has he been missing? Sherlock tried to remember, tried to remember everything about John that would possibly help him understand. He remembered John knowing that the victims had been shot. He remembered the disgust in John’s voice as he described the procedure. He remembered John’s hesitance to go to the crime scene, in fact, his absolute refusal.
He'd needed some stitches and had gotten a handful of tests and scans, but he hadn't needed any surgery, which was encouraging for the amount of time it would take him to recover. His jaw had also needed to be stitched up. They were worried about the stab wound, but it hadn’t hit any internal organs. The split and scotched skin across his chest was basically inconsequential in comparison to the rest of it and thankfully the infection that he was showing signs of seemed to be residing quickly thanks to a round of strong antibiotics.
He wished that he could still have that life. That life where he and Sherlock thought that they were all but invincible. They may not have had any time together as more than friend’s pre-Moriarty, but even before that moment so long ago now when Sherlock had kissed him in the park, there was always that unspoken fondness, dare he even think maybe a kind of love, between them.
“DMJS probably stands for something, right? Nothing comes up in a basic google search. Probably initials then, something more generic, harder to search. 12.11 could be a date, the 12
What was he supposed to do from here? What kind of counter-move could Moriarty possibly expect him to make? What could he do? There had to be something. Something not right, something he missed, something else out there waiting to be discovered. John’s death had to have some sort of point to Moriarty. He couldn’t have just been disposed of like a common criminal whose use had run out.
"What is the point of your presence here? Do you want me to hate him? Or are you trying to tell me that despite the fact that he was working for you, you're going to arrest him for murder? As if he hasn't suffered enough!"
“Tax fraud?” John sputtered. He’d gotten out of hospital a week ago and had been taken to Victor and Mary’s base, which was actually a two bedroom flat in South London. Victor had given up his shoebox of a bedroom to John and was now sleeping on the couch.
“I suppose I could have not noticed if he did, but I imagine he’s got everything he needs wherever it is that he went already.”
“No,” Sherlock snapped aggressively. There was nothing that he could do now. Morality had left him a clue, he’d figured it out, but now the only thing he could do is wait. Wait and imagine all the horrible things Moriarty could be having done to John. Wait and wonder if right at that moment they’d run out of time and John was taking his last breath.
John could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, calculating. Trying to find an answer. After a silence that felt like an eternity, Sherlock spoke.
“What, you don’t know, you’ve been rather amiable drinking buddies recently!” Sherlock growled, wondering who else had been lying to him.
“We’ve been unable to identify the victims, and the case is rather horrific, so we haven’t had much information to report, and no desire to cause an unnecessary panic, so we’ve avoid calling a press conference or releasing any of the more interesting bits in the press releases. And we do like to imagine that we aren’t completely incompetent down at The Yard, despite what you believe, Sherlock. But the way the bodies are mutilated, we don't know what to make of it without someone who has more, er, background in this kind of thing," Lestrade said.
“Okay, if you say so. But I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that framing a hacker with ties to Moriarty to the mugging is a bit of a challenge. I mean he was a hacker, John. Tech-y little nerd types don’t usually go around mugging people. Plus, Sherlock almost caught you that night as well.”
, or that Anderson has done something particularly moronic, or simply that it's Monday. But no, this is not smoking out of stress, it’s out of spite. You usually smoke low tar cigarettes, or even roll your own, but you specifically bought menthols. Which can only mean that the medical examiner had to be called to the scene immediately to consult with you directly.”
“It just would have been nice to have another person to watch my back you know? I imagine there is going to be a lot of me versus small armies of highly trained men.” But then maybe Sherlock having an old friend to watch his now that John wasn't there to make sure he didn't do anything to reckless wasn't a bad thing.
But that wasn’t the case and now he was so close to being done with it all. Christ, what he would give to be able to take a holiday.
Sherlock didn’t like the look that he was reading on Lestrade’s face at all. It was sad, but not like he was sad himself exceptionally, more that he expected Sherlock to be sad. It was sympathy. It was pity.
The rage flashed for a moment. John did his best to stamp it down, but his comment was still far too bitter, and it was a comment that John would come to deeply regret.
“But I think the point is John, I underestimated by a lot, and here I thought I’d been the only one to see your potential. After all, I put you to work, and then I tried to kill you. No one else saw you as enough of a threat to do that, did they? I mean, Sherlock played games with you, I supposed. But they were only games. You know that now though, don’t you?”
“Right. Right. Of course. Of course!” Sherlock’s pacing began again and was frantic. He was spinning back and forth on the balls of his feet, with his long coat swishing behind him, causing him to look a bit like a vulture swooping around its prey.
He had ripped the hair from the corpses, taking hours to make sure every last follicle was removed. That was the first day all on its own. John would tell Sherlock he had to work and then was going to the pub, but really he’d been removing a dead criminal’s pubic hair in an empty warehouse in Camden Town or Stratford or Barbican. But that was nothing compared to the second day, when he’d have to come back and finish the job. He’d use acid to burn off the finger prints, watching the chemicals burned through the skin, even begin to eat away at the hard finger nails. Then he would pull out their teeth and eyes, and would saw off the cartilage of their nose and ears.  And then finally he'd pour acid over the head, leaving it to dissolve until you started to see bone.
"John," Sherlock started, but the paused, considering his words. "I need you," he finally decided on.
anything, really. He apparently went to uni with Sherlock. They’re kind of old friends. And well, when Sherlock found him at Roger’s flat, well it was a bit of a strange reunion. Victor was released less than a week after he was arrested, no charges pressed, thanks mostly to you getting Rogers to turn himself in. But Sherlock’s been trying to track him down for months. Keeps getting a hold of him too, occasionally. Vic’s good at disappearing though, but the damage is done.”
He frantically looked around, trying to see through the dark and murky water. He could only make out the vaguest of shapes and a flashing red light of the expired timer. The water quickly started to sting his eyes and he had to shut them. The door had been right in front of him, hadn’t it, just to the left of the timer? He swam forwards and groped until he found the door knob, pulling open the door. How long could people hold their breaths? The world record was something like ten minutes maybe he’d read once? Which meant what, he had probably all of about a minute at most before his untrained-for-forcing-yourself-to-hold-your-breath-until-right-before-you-go-brain-dead body would demand that he breathe or go unconscious.
John ground his teeth, the way Sherlock kept saying his name, almost like it was a curse word, was setting him on edge.
, his brained screamed the image of the back of familiar-but-not blond haired stranger burned into his mind.
Then world seemed to still for a second as John realized he couldn’t breathe. One of the broken ribs must have punctured his lung, collapsing it.
“But the only ones left are so boring,” Sherlock half-heartedly groaned. He looked over meekly at Victor just in time to catch the other man roll his eyes before dragging Sherlock into their destination for yet another cup of coffee Sherlock would let go cold.
“I’m beginning to worry you’re becoming your sister, John. You’ve gone out more nights in the past week than you haven’t,” Sherlock grumbled, not entirely sure if John could understand him since he was speaking mostly into a cushion. It wasn’t even exactly true, of course, but Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to be fair anymore. John was only going out two nights a week, but he usually coupled them with days he was working at the surgery, meaning he’d go straight from work to the pub, and Sherlock wouldn’t see him all day.
John boarded the boat and headed inside, quickly making his way down the short stairway that lead down into the body of the boat.
John groaned, but handed his mobile over to Sherlock. Sherlock pressed the button to turn on the screen, but then remembering that John had turned it off earlier, held down the power button. The phone responded and after a moment Sherlock had opened the phones internet browser to begin doing research on the graft study, when John’s phone vibrated and a text came in.
They’d taken care of Irene Adler, who had been arrested a few days ago on a very boring charge, something to do with embezzlement. Victor had gone out to pick up another file, from the mysterious government official referred to often only as “our man” and to do a bit of reconnaissance. John had been strictly forbidden from going, and Mary had claimed that she had some reading she needed to get done, but John felt like she was his babysitter. Why he needed a babysitter he didn’t know. He was dead. They hadn’t published an obituary or held a memorial for him or anything, and obviously divers they sent after the wreck hadn’t been able to find the body to bury. But Mary had told him the police presumed he was dead. And while she hadn’t said it, she knew what she meant most was that Sherlock presumed he was dead. That was the bit John cared about, anyway.
Sherlock was on the way to the Yard, making his journey on foot from Baker Street out of hopes to kill time or maybe just maybe to happen to witness an interesting crime along the way. His goal for that day was to try and get the Dimmock, who had arrested a man who turned out to have a background in the military and was rumored to be a hired assassin, specializing as a sniper, on breaking and entering and attempted burglary, to not hate him so much.
John couldn’t even begin to fathom exactly how screwed he was before a voice he had hoped to never hear again sang out in the room.
A look of surprise again from Mycroft, but once again it quickly passed. "I'm not a psychologist, but I do believe that John doesn't anticipate there being a reality in which you want a future with him."
“Give that back you prat!” John protested, shooting out of his chair and jumping to try and grab the journal back from Sherlock’s grasp.
The news had been a setback on the small progress that Sherlock had made towards being a functioning human again. Sherlock had returned to the chair, ignoring the world and even the most desperate pleas. Hearing the official report of John's demise was too much for Sherlock to bear, and he retreated into his mind.
Ms. Hudson made him three meals a day, and lots of tea. Sherlock ate some of it, but most of it went cold.
“Really, Holmes, I thought that you had some tact. Do you think that if I had anything to do with that guy, which I’ve told you I don’t, that I’d tell you now? After what, accidentally running into the Peacemaker himself in the streets?”
“Oh no, Sherman is an awful name, not what I had in mind,” Mary said far too seriously for John’s liking. He looked at her in mock horror.
Mycroft opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock cut him off. He was pacing now, back and forth, one foot stamping down in front of the other.
But alcohol was not Sherlock’s drug of choice and his stint with alcoholism was not satisfying. He wanted his brain to work better, to be sharper and able to tune into the details that mattered while blocking out the rest. He couldn’t live without it anymore. No cases, no John, to distract him, he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Sherlock!” he heard Lestrade call after him, but his brother said something softer, clearly to Lestrade that Sherlock was now too far away to hear.
Sherlock took off after him, trying desperately to overtake him. He scanned through the maps of London that existed in his mind, trying to come up with some street he could chase the man down to corner him, or any other advantage he could possibly use to tackle the man. But the man’s knowledge of the area seemed to rival Sherlock’s. In fact, he knew things Sherlock didn’t. He’d climb up over skips to get out of the sight line of CCTV cameras, he knew the code to a security gate that led them through a private garden, he knew which fire escapes led up to vacant roof tops that had good access points to jump to the neighboring buildings.
“But we work so well together, don’t you think?” Moriarty said, slowly bringing his hands back to John’s head and twining his fingers through his hair. “You get along with Seb, you’re excellent at following orders, you have a taste for violence—,” John grimaced. “Oh, don’t make those faces, darling. You know you do. You can tell yourself that you’re tired of it all now, but we both know that that isn’t true. Maybe I won’t be able to ask you to cut anyone up for me, but you’d do wonderfully at nearly anything else I may require. You’ll rest up a bit and then be bored out of your mind again. You’ll need some
“Maybe, maybe it would help the case move along if we could just close that door.” Lestrade suggested carefully. “Get that mystery out of the way. Why don’t you call the surgery and ask if John’s mentioned anyone? You said he had been using the pub to cover up his affair, maybe whoever it was stopped by the surgery to pick him up.”
“My friend has a background in military, that doesn’t mean he’s taking down some of the city’s best criminal’s right under your nose. And come on, ‘The Peacemaker’ hasn’t stolen any cases from you in months.”
John steadied his breath and stepped out from the alley, turning in the opposite direction from the way that Sherlock and Victor had gone. He’d made it a few blocks before he heard another familiar voice.
He was also keeping himself very busy at the surgery, electing to cover all of the shifts of another doctor who had to go on maternity leave a bit earlier than originally planned. When he did spend time with Sherlock, it had been the times when Sherlock needed a sounding board and John could sit and read and ignore Sherlock while he babbled incomprehensibly about things John would have a hard time following even if he could bring himself to try. That’s what this afternoon had been, or was supposed to be. It had been a few hours with Sherlock put in so Sherlock would not grow suspicious of John’s avoidance. Spending any more time than that with Sherlock right now was too painful and too dangerous. They were not meant to be anything more than they were, and John wasn’t so sure any more that they were even meant to be that much.
The ache that overcame Mycroft when he spotted one of John’s jumpers wadded up by the pillow was one that Mycroft hadn’t felt towards Sherlock since he had been mourning the death of his beloved childhood pet dog, Redbeard. Mycroft found himself wandering into Sherlock’s room, reaching out and letting his fingertips graze the material of the jumper.
"Oi! Watch where you're going!" the person, the man, that he had run into shouted. But Sherlock was frozen at the familiarity of the voice.
He was lying, Sherlock knew. He had to be lying, or at least distorting the truth. Sherlock looked at Victor, taking him in for the thousandth time that afternoon, going over his deductions again. He’d changed out of his blue Maplin polo shirt and into a t-shirt with some sort of logo on it that Sherlock supposed the average person might recognize as belonging to a band or music group. He’d also had a denim jacket on that he’d taken off when they sat down and was now carelessly bunched along the back of his seat. He was still wearing the black trousers and trainers that he’d been working in. His hair had grown out a bit since when he’d first seen him two weeks ago, the sides of his head kept neatly trimmed, but the hair on the top of his head was a bit longer, something that Sherlock knew was a popular style among the late teens and twenties set currently.
Had he been mistaken? Had he died and not realized it? Was this the nothingness of death or a dream of his oxygen deprived mind after he’d lost consciousness and was now just about to drown as his body instinctively breathed in the cold water? It couldn’t be. But he had nowhere to go. And now that he had oxygen, he realized that the adrenaline had worn off and he felt his body going into shock. He was so cold and so tired and everything hurt. He began to shake.
He had air, but no clue how long it would last before the ceiling that was above him was pulled down and took him back under with it.
“Don’t you even think about trying to stay behind, John! You have to come. Moriarty has finally made another move!”
“Well don’t you think that is exactly why I worry? Only a few nights without John and I find you sleeping on a bench! What would happen to you if we can’t--,” Lestrade cut himself off.
He sighed, hesitant to move, but slowly sat up, causing Sherlock to fall away from him with a whimper. He shushed Sherlock comfortingly as he lifted his hips and tugged his trousers and pants the rest of the way off, using his pants to clean up himself and Sherlock before tossing them across the room. He thought about taking off his jumper, feeling unbalanced fully dressed from the waist up but completely starkers from the waist down, but apparently he’d already taken enough time, because Sherlock growled and pulled him back down onto the mattress, quickly reclaiming John’s shoulder as his pillow.
“Related to the Peacemaker?” Sherlock asked. He could hear the excitement in Sherlock’s voice. God, he sounded so young and naïve. John knew that Sherlock was only a bit more than a handful of years younger than him and well into his thirties, but he could be so childlike at times. John found himself smiling fondly.
He was sitting in a Taylor-Walker pub, its given name having something to do with Arms, not like that narrowed it down, in Bloomsbury. Across the table from him, Victor Trevor was sitting and eating a Steak and Ale pie and drinking a beer. Or was it technically an ale? Stout? Sherlock didn’t know and didn’t care. Victor had come back from the bar after placing his order with two of whatever it was and placed one in front of Sherlock, but Sherlock hadn’t touched his.
Sherlock smiled and John felt Sherlock’s hips shift under him as he mimicked John’s actions, ridding his feet of his shoes. This also caused Sherlock’s erection to grind against John and he groaned at the friction.
“It’s okay John. Sherlock is fine. And you’re going to be fine. And we’re going to fix everything. Do you want to fix things John?”
“I’d like to speak to that friend of yours, the one that asked you to break into Roger’s flat,” Sherlock said, trying to sound assertive.
“And now, so will I,” Moriarty whispered. John could feel that he was close again, but kept his eyes closed and head down, not in defeat but because he knew that Moriarty would be frustrated by John's refusal to engage. “But you rebuilt by tearing down didn’t you Johnny? And so I must do the same, shouldn’t I? You tore me down and climbed atop the pieces. So it only makes sense that I’ll have to do the same.”
He had always known that Mycroft’s habit of barging in unannounced was a habit born specifically out of checking up on him post rehab to make sure he wasn’t high or otherwise gone AWOL. Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade at the heart of it probably came around unannounced for much the same reason, but they at least usually came up with other excuses that were occasionally not completely irritating. But now Trevor had taken up that annoying habit of crashing on Sherlock’s couch whenever he didn’t feel like going back to his own less centrally located room or would pop around after work to drag him out to anything that he could come up with in terms of entertainment.
“Sherlock, there you are! I’ve been trying to catch up with you for an hour now!” Lestrade appeared beside him, with a lieutenant trailing behind him.
“Yes. Both of us. Unless I’m misunderstanding the situation, but I am, as you’ve stated, a genius after all," Sherlock grinned at John, but his smile did't quite reach his eyes. "But there is a criminal mastermind, although apparently one who is much more boring than I initially anticipated, loose in London imminently causing chaos so I really think that it would be best if we stop being held back by repressed emotions.”
John cringed at the word ‘brave,’ but felt the panic dissipate. Sherlock didn’t know, not really. He had only deduced that his mind wasn’t in the desert while he was dreaming.
“Oh, look, I’ve struck a nerve, but I’ve found Doctor John Watson again, haven’t I? Good, you were getting so boring.” Moriarty grinned. “Well, unfortunately I have other obligations,” he sighed dramatically. “But I’m glad to see you’ve got some fight back. Seb,” Moran stepped out from behind John and gave Moriarty a curt nod, “Break him again for me, will you?” Moriarty smiled sweetly and Moran grinned viciously. “See you later! Or, no I won’t.” Moriarty’s grin continued to grow. “Have a fun death, Johnny-boy. I hope that it’s everything you hoped it would be.”
“Also, Mycroft says that you should stop whinging about not having a case and check your bloody phone,” he paused, a grin tugging at the corners of his lips, “Well, he didn’t say bloody, I added that part. Mycroft is too dignified for that, at least via text, but I suppose you already know.”
It was everything he had hoped it would be, in those few moments when he let his mind wander to consider what it might be like to be with Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock’s tongue was in his mouth and he couldn’t remember ever granting entrance. Nor could he remember ever considering denying it. And god, was it an amazing tongue. John had a fair deal of experience snogging, but this was something else entirely. John had never imagined that Sherlock had a lot of experience with kissing, but either Sherlock’s genius extended to all things or he’d been keeping some things from John.
He could tell how pathetic he looked when he finally dared to look up to see Moriarty grinning at him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. They were talking to him like he was a child. But Sherlock stopped and traced through the deductions that he’d made yesterday at the crime scene, until he remembered.
“How could we be expected to save you?” Victor supplied. “Don’t worry, it’s not an insult to Sherlock’s intelligence. It’s just a matter of his positioning. Sherlock is in the center of things regarding Moriarty. And as you surely found out, tearing down Moriarty’s web from the inside, while seemingly the only way to do it, is a hopeless pursuit at this stage. But we have a theory. If we weaken Moriarty’s web from the outside, then Sherlock will be able to cast the final blow from within. But in order to do that, we need to stay out of the world Sherlock and all your little crime fighting buddies are currently occupying.”
“What social circle? With John gone--,” Sherlock stopped and pursed his lips, his eyes widening unintentionally with sadness.
He was met with more silence as both Sherlock and Lestrade stared at him in shock from his outburst.
“John, I think we may have both been very dishonest with each other recently and it has put up a barrier in our relationship that I think is crucial we tear down in order to be able to move on with the Moriarty case.”
HAND” Moriarty shouted in his face, a stream of hot breath warming his cheeks. He then stepped away from John and began to pace in front of him.
It probably would be enough time, if there were any chance that Sherlock was going to miss John, to want to forgive him. But he wasn’t going to. He heard beeping and raised his eyes just enough to see Moriarty fiddling with a large digital clock on the wall right across from him. The clock beeped one more time and a countdown began.
John blinked and took in his surroundings. He was on the floor of what appeared to be a boat, judging by the navigation equipment positioned across from him and the swaying that he realized he felt. Another fucking boat. Damn, he just wanted to be on land. No, he had just wanted to be dead. A man wearing a wet suit, dark hair wet and mussed, probably a little younger than John, closer to Sherlock’s age leaned over him, looking worried but a bit triumphant. Behind him a woman, around the same age of maybe a bit older was observing him with her arms crossed over her chest, looking both worried and skeptical.
tie you up Johnny-boy!” Moriarty giggled ferociously while Moran took a step towards John. John raised his hands in the air and bowed his head, letting Moran attach leather cuffs to his wrists, tugging the chains through a pulley so that John was left dangling, arms wide in a spread eagle crucifixion-like sort of position, bound wrists nearly against the ceiling, his toes just barely scraping the floor as his body stretched to fill the space between low ceilings of the narrowboat. Moriarty was lucky that John was below average height.
John had been working very hard to ignore the fact that it seemed that Moriarty knew every move John made over the past few weeks, and he wasn’t going to dwell on how Moriarty already knew the fallout of something that had happened barely an hour ago.
John couldn’t think of anything to say, but the man through the earpiece, who John realized was likely Moriarty, seemed perfectly willing to keep talking.
John however, seemed to break the dynamic a bit. As much as John absolutely did not need nor want it, Victor and Mary both seemed to feel some level of, oh how John hated even thinking in terms like this, but fondness and protectiveness for John. He sometimes felt less like a member of their team and more like someone who had been assigned two very odd body guards.
“What, like you don’t know. Or did he not tell you he told me? Or are you testing him and I shouldn't have told you he told me? He did seem really hesitant to. He’d seemed really off, you know, kind of skittish, his leg had been bothering him again. But when he told me, oh, I don’t even care that we didn’t work out when he looked so happy.”
John then, with all the pride he used to have, mustered the energy to thrust his body forwards. At first the chains that held him up rattled deliciously, sounding his rebellion. But then John was swinging backwards with his toes dragging across the floor, his body swaying slightly as he tried to balance himself on his toes.
“But why couldn’t it be one person? You said yourself that there are people that could do both. With John’s medical and military background, he’d fit the bill just fine, as well as likely any other army doctor,” Lestrade pointed out.
“It’s nothing. No one.” John hastily shut the phone off and stuffed it into his pocket. “I thought we had a crime scene to get to?” John headed out the door of the flat, leaving a very confused Sherlock and Lestrade to follow him, trying to figure out the sudden about face from John.
But now he’d lost Sherlock. And without Sherlock, John had nearly nothing. He had a crap alcoholic sister and a job that some weeks was barely even part time that he was significantly overqualified for. He had a small collection of bad jumpers, and he had a gun.
When he woke up again the clock was down to 38 hours. Moran was nowhere in sight, but John realized that his shoulder was killing him. Having been hung for ten hours, his old injury had been agitated and it felt like his shoulder was trying to rip itself apart. John tried to reposition himself, seeing if he could put any more weight on his toes, but no relief came.
John felt his heart stop when the proposition was finally made so plainly. Even in his drugged up brain, a part of him knew that this was what they meant when they asked for his help. But suddenly hearing it was too much.
There was a part of him that had been imagining seeing John sitting there in his chair. He’d imagined shouting at John for worrying him. He imagined John being confused and giving him some foolish and dull excuse. He’d imagine kneeling over John in his chair, his thighs around Johns, his bum resting on Johns lap, and snogging him senselessly. He imagined grinding his erection against Johns, he imagined kissing John’s neck, breathing in his scent. He imagined John’s voice, rough and filled with lust, gasping, “Christ, Sherlock.”
"Oh my heavens!" she'd proclaimed and ran back down the stairs. She returned a moment later with a camera.
“What, Mar, are you jealous Moriarty didn’t try and recruit you?” John gasped at the resentment in Mary’s voice, mostly joking.
“Shit, Vic. You can’t pull someone half dead out of the river and expect them to be fine after being tortured. He needs an actual hospital.”
Sherlock absorbed the information, and it easily slid in. Things were becoming clearer and clearer with every passing moment.
“So we’re going to assemble this file, deliver it to someone, and then Irene Adler will spend the next year at least sorting herself out legally and unable to aid Moriarty or um, play, with Sherlock.”
He took slow steps. He wasn’t quite sure what he was planning to do when he reached Mary, but he didn’t have to find out because the next thing he remembered there was a loud thud a few feet away from him and he realized that he himself was already lying on the floor. A few moments later, maybe more if he’d lost consciousness again and hadn’t realized, Victor was learning over him, applying pressure to the bullet wound in his arm.
"John Watson was an accessory to murder. In the few months alone he has killed eleven people and injured dozens more. Several people, including the man that Michael Huxley was put away for killing, killed themselves rather than be brought down by him. None of this was his fault?"
you are,” Moriarty whispered, now dragging his finger through the blood that oozed from the wound on John’s face. He suddenly disappeared behind John and John tensed, know that whatever was going to come next couldn’t be good.
John owed Sherlock this. He’d surely hurt him so much, betrayed him so deeply, that the least he could do was this. It’s not like he had anything else anyway.
“Oh, don’t worry John. I’ve even left clues for Sherlock to come find you, if he wants. They’re hard clues, of course, if your DI friend or that meddling other Holmes brother decide to take pity on you and try to find you, even just for the sake of a belief in justice at the hands of the courts after Sherlock tells them what you’ve done, they won’t be able to get to you. Only Sherlock can. And if he does, I won’t try and stop him. He won’t even see me. He can have you back and I’ll never try to separate you two love birds again. In fact, either way I plan to disappear a while. Everyone needs a holiday every now and then. The second you hit the water, it’ll be like I never existed. What will Sherlock do then? Without me or you? He’ll go bored out of his mind won’t he? And whatever will he do? Oh! Do you think he’ll turn back to the drugs? Do you think he’ll finally manage to kill himself? Do you think you’ll be the last thought on his mind before he loses consciousness as he overdoses?”
to meet, usually men, obviously gay, and not at all remotely Sherlock’s type, considering they were not 5’8” with blond hair and blue eyes, well-built arms and shoulders but a growing slightly pudgy beer belly, a toothy smile that a man like Sherlock could no way ever possibly deserve, and risen from the dead.
He would be nearly deformed, by the time he healed, the skin of his back would be rough and constantly inflamed looking. The cut on his jaw might fade in a couple years if he was lucky, but his age wasn’t exactly on his side when it came to that sort of healing anymore. He’d have a dimple of scar tissue in his side, but it would be irrelevant to his marred face and back. His chest might heal scar free, assuming the wounds didn’t become massively infected, but he'd probably be left with faint marks. He guessed he should be thankful that Moriarty hadn't given Moran free reign to start amputating limbs. He should be thankful that all things considering it wasn't that bad. He knew that similar injuries could keep people hospitalized for at least a month, and if things continued on as they were currently he'd be out by the beginning of the next week. But he felt like a monster. He deserved it after all he'd done.
Lestrade muttered something that sounded like “throw a fit” and “some genius you are” but Sherlock instead chose to ignore him to grab his coat and fly down the stairs to hail a cab.
“Oh, John.” The tone of Sherlock’s voice caused John, who over the course of the afternoon had worked himself into a toxic cocktail of emotion, to let out a strangled gasp that sounded much too much like a sob. There was so much pity and sadness in Sherlock’s voice, John couldn’t bear it.
It begins about a week after the events of The Great Game, everything after that point is a near complete departure.
After they both caught their breaths, Sherlock rolled off of John and curled up into his side, nuzzling his head into the crook of John’s neck. John heard him sigh contentedly. He wanted to wrap his arm around Sherlock and pull him closer, to stroke his back while murmuring ridiculous endearments praising the other man, but he realized his hand was covered in Sherlock’s come, and the waistband of his pants own pants felt sticky.
Sherlock couldn't help but grin. Moriarty. Lestrade may not have said anything about the man, but what he did say was more than enough of a confirmation for Sherlock.
. At least when Sherlock gets bored and wants to die, he does it slowly, doesn’t he, with the drugs? When you get bored and want to die though, you’ll fire a bullet into your head. Doesn’t give anyone much time to save you does it? And so many people want to save you, don’t they? Your friend at the Yard, both the Holmes boys, your two new crime fighting pals, they all would happily throw themselves in front of a train to save you. Couldn’t you let me save you Johnny, instead? Save them from making any unnecessary sacrifices.”
en route to a crack den!” Victor looked blankly at Sherlock, clearly not caring about the technicality to how Mycroft had assumed his brothers intentions after witnessing a crime in a rather notorious part of town, and Sherlock sputtered. “I can’t believe that you took the money, anyway! John didn’t take the money,” Sherlock grumbled.
“Boss has been looking for you,” a deep voice hissed and then something collided with the back of his head and the world went dark.
"Sorry I'm a little eager. I've just waited so long for this," Sherlock whispered and it took all of John's self control not to come right then.
, John thought he heard Sherlock’s voice whisper in his ear as the water rose. Soon it was up to his chest, then his neck. John gulped in a breath of air right before it covered his mouth.
"Moriarty, the man, is more or less a figure head. He could, I suppose, still close significant damage even as an individual. But all his resources are gone. Everything that made his such a threat to us he no longer had access to. We'll be able to track him down soon enough, just to tie up loose ends."
Sherlock approached the body, feeling John and Lestrade hesitantly follow a step behind him. When he finally saw the body, he couldn’t help but gape. This was definitely the work of Moriarty, or at least someone who specifically was out for Sherlock. All identifying features of the body, anything that could have possibly told Sherlock anything about the victim was completely removed. He could tell the victim was a Caucasian male, likely in his 30’s or 40’s, and that he was relatively fit at the time of his death. But anything else that could have possibly narrowed him down from the thousands of people that could describe, and the hundreds of them who were reported missing, was gone. There was nothing left for Sherlock to observe and make deductions from.The mans fingertips, it appeared, had been dipped in acid, removing the print and leaving the fingertips red and bloody from the chemical burns. All the hair from his body had been removed, from his head to his toes. It looked like it had been waxed off, which for a full grown man with a lifetime of body hair must have taken ages.
“They found a narrowboat in the yachts boat hold,” Mycroft announced. Sherlock felt Lestrade tense besides him. “There is no sign to a body. The narrowboat was crushed though as the yacht went down. They’re going to have to excavate the wreck, resurface it piece by piece because of it’s positioning in the river anyway. Leaving the wreck would be too dangerous considering how trafficked the area is, none the less considering the concerns of it being a crime scene. They’re preparing to work through the night. Right now though the Marine Policing unit of the Met is in charge. If a body or any other indications of any sort of foul play is found, I’m sure the Gregory’s division will be notified.”
After dealing with his foul mood for most of the day, she finally went home, and he was alone again.
He could, perhaps, track down every hospital in the city, hunting for him. Mycroft probably had him under excellent security, and realistically would be watching Sherlock as well. But if he wanted to, Sherlock knew he could find him.
“Well, Sherlock, it is a possibility. We’ve been trying our best, but we’re not getting anywhere. None of the narrow boats around Canary Wharf have any association with Moriarty. There is some CCTV on the water, but there are definitely plenty of gaps. And none of the ones anywhere near London for that matter seem to have any easily identifiable ties, anyway. And let’s face it, unless its summertime in Ely, people don’t really boat recreationally on the river, none the less with narrow boats. That’s why Morris and Steven’s boat sunk, after all, because no one had taken a boat on the part of the river they were on since September and no one had noticed that a long sunk steel rowboat had been carried down the river and found itself wedged in to protrude from the sediment and would tear into the bottom of their narrow boat.”
He tried to remember anything from before this, but the woman was right. He had flashes of bright lights and agony, but otherwise not much else since he was pulled from the river.
“There is no evidence to substantiate his claims. They’ll probably release him in a couple days, maybe he’ll spend a couple months in a low security prison for the breaking and entering charge and his confession if he manages to really frustrate everyone and gets completely screwed over by the legal system. And then when he gets out he’ll disappear. We can keep working. We’re getting so close, John. This gang was one of the last substantial teams under Moriarty’s influence in London. He has some assassins that move around too much for us to deal with at this stage, and then maybe some arms dealers or specialists abroad, but we always knew those kinds of support are too far out of our realm and not closely enough tied to Moriarty to matter if we take care of everything else."
“You’re going to kill them, Johnny. If you don’t, Seb will kill all of you. But I hope that you choose to save yourself and join me.”
His mind cleared further and he put the two thoughts together. Oh God, Sherlock must know. Moriarty had to have sent whatever video or photo he took of him to Sherlock. And now Sherlock knew. He knew John was alive. And that piece of information in Sherlock’s mind would inevitably mean that Sherlock would soon know everything else as well.
be sent. He imagined Sherlock clearing his expression, instantly resetting it to a blank slate. Could he really expect Sherlock to see through another instance of John’s betrayal to save him? It hadn’t happened the first time, there was no reason to expect any different now.
Moriarty groaned, “I don’t care about Sherlock anymore. He's so. Boring. With you and Seb by my side he’d hardly be a threat, would he? No, when you left, he broke. That friend of yours, Trevor, he’s done a decent job replacing you for now, but he’s not exactly really Sherlock’s friend. He care’s because he’s paid to, it’s just another job to him. Sherlock’s adoring brother dearest might be able to keep him around for a while, but not forever. He’ll get bored, as well, playing babysitter. And he’ll leave and how long will Sherlock last after that? We could place bets, if you like.”
Sherlock’s mind wrapped around that detail and began to ground itself. It felt less like his mind palace had been caught up in a tornado, and Sherlock began to take inventory. Moriarty? Or the man who was making London's most wanted list turn themselves in?
Search warrant issued, Sherlock, Lestrade, and a small team went to the flat and demanded entry. No one answered and the door was banged in. The police were supposed to go ahead and check to make sure that everything was clear. Sherlock, however, completely ignored protocool as he barged in.
John was left immobilized at the friction Sherlock’s hand was providing, his back arched off the mattress, his mouth open and face contorted as he moaned.
Moriarty was scrambling to regain control after very possibly for the first time experiencing a loss of it. In times like these, Sherlock turned to crack, but Moriarty simply had cracked.
He took a second to look around him more carefully. He was in a private hospital room. An IV was attached to his arm. He followed the tubes to their source. Blood. Saline. Morphine.
John’s eyes followed Moran as he came into his line of vision. He followed Moriarty’s finger to the small rolling table that he pointed to, which had a small metal tray on it which had some unidentifiable objects resting on it. John fought down the panic that instantly welled up inside of him. It was all too familiar, little metal tray, the kind that held scalpels and other medical tools. Medical tools he'd used to maim, to butcher. All this time, and John was still faced with a reminder that he would never be able to be a doctor again. He gasped sharply as he began to panic and cringed in agony. He tried to catch his breath, but couldn’t figure out how to without the pain.
He pictured the consulting detective running his hands across his now marred cheek and over his now ruined back. He imagined Sherlock kissing his neck, which was now coated in blood from the wound Moriarty inflicted along his jaw. He thought about him whispering endearments into his ear. He thought about him laughing. He thought about his face, smile crinkling to the corners of those bright eyes. Eventually consciousness and unconsciousness all blended together into a Sherlock Holmes themed fever dream.
Today though, he was going because he deserved whatever Moriarty had plans for him, no matter what that was. If it was his turn to be a faceless body, John wasn’t sure if he should bother fighting it.
"I think it's time you go home Sherlock. Get some rest. Heaven's knows the last time you slept. I'll let you know when we've made progress. John is going to need some time to recover."
“The point would be that Moriarty has nothing left, Mar, you know that. He has nothing in the world right now but the very tool we built to destroy him.”
At the mention of Moriarty, John froze. He slowly lowered his hand from the air and he fell backwards into his chair.
“He still doesn’t have a clue about either of us yet, thanks very much. He basically thinks I’m fucking Jim,” John rolled his eyes.
.” John cringed with the repeated use of the horrible and condescending nickname and he felt his blood begin to boil.
John was sore. He was pretty sure at least seventy five percent of his body was covered in bruises. Honestly, he was far too old for this kind of shit. He was getting way too close to forty and his body was quickly becoming useless.
“Sherlock, Sherlock," Sherlock heard a familiar voice calling to him. "I got a call from an officer saying that he found you sleeping on a bench the by the river and I thought, ‘No, Sherlock is probably still being slightly sensible in the face of crisis,’ but then I remembered that you’re Sherlock Fucking Holmes and then look where you are,” Lestrade exclaimed.
, was the first thought that claimed John’s mind, and a wave of defeat that he hadn’t been expecting washed over him.
. Sherlock himself however wasn’t sure if he, despite his well fitted suits and general air of his own personal trademarked blend of boredom, ambivalence, and distain, if he wanted to be cool. At least not Victor Trevor’s brand of cool, which he assumed would involve lots of crowds and loud noises and some sort of house beer on tap that tasted of piss.
On the third day Molly texted him, asking him if he was alright, that Lestrade had come to the morgue and told her some troubling things.
“John,” a panicked voice called to him. “John, it’s okay. It’s okay,” the voice repeated over and over.
His movements became increasingly frantic, trying to make out shapes in the darkness of the water. He groped ahead of him, trying to orient himself any way he could.
“We do have someone who is linked to Moriarty. She’s a bit grey as far as her allegiances to him go. I think she likes to pretend that she has more autonomy than she really does. We also have information that she may have taken an interest in Sherlock, and we need to stop her from entering his sphere. The second he knows of her, there likely isn’t anything we can do about her without compromising ourselves,” Victor explained.
They were sitting in the small living room, with Victor and Mary on the couch pouring over files spread out on the coffee table. John sat delicately in an arm chair across from them. He was still fighting to manage the pain in his back, the wounds would like take a while to heal completely, plus his side often ached but John wasn’t sure if that was psychosomatic or not at this point. His limp was back and his hand had a near constant tremor now a day, so he imagined it could be.
Finally, the blows stopped. One final kick and John was rolled over onto his back. John blinked up to see Moriarty standing over him, a foot on either side of his hips, holding was looked to be his mobile.
It didn’t last long. Soon a man in a white coat came in and went through John’s treatment with him, letting John look through his own chart, which John appreciated. He hated being a patient, and he hated feeling patronized by other doctors when he was one himmself.
He quickly began to scan the living space. It wasn’t anything particularly spectacular. Beer cans scattered amid cheap, worn furniture. Who knew gang members shopped at IKEA? A gun was carelessly lying on a table. Sherlock nearly rolled his eyes at the cockiness of some people, clearly a display in power more than carelessness. ‘
“48 hours from now though, and not a moment more, this boat is going to sink into the Thames.” John felt an involuntary wave of panic and nausea surge through him as the concept of his impending death officially became real.
Sherlock watched Moriarty in horror, trying to deduce the man, make sense of what he was saying. The more he looked at the criminal mastermind, though, the more he realized that something was entirely off about him. Far much more so than the last time they had met.
But he could only keep coughing. He moved to lean over, sputtering water across the floor. The man placed a hand on John’s shoulder to hold him up.
In fact, if Lestrade had his way, which was never when it came to Sherlock, Sherlock probably wouldn’t even know as much as he did about the London’s ascension into the light, as the Met had taken to calling it like London had been Gotham all this time . Sherlock though stubbornly hung out around the yard whenever he could, and got himself access to files in any way, legal or not, he could manage.
It had now been months since the existence of The Peacemaker was brought to Sherlock’s attention, and he knew nothing definitive about the man’s identity. He seemed to have gone abroad and an array of awe-inspiringly ‘coincidental’ arrests had been left in his wake as he circumnavigated the globe. But other than that, Sherlock knew nothing. The only thing he was convinced of, however, was that Victor Trevor knew more than he was letting on.
John suddenly felt like he couldn’t breathe again. He collapsed onto the floor, wincing as his wounded back collided with the floor. He surged back upright, gasping and clawing at his chest with shaking hands. They clawed into his raw flesh of the wounds from where he was whipped and burned and he gasped as it stung. His entire body was on fire
“Look, I have other things to do right now besides tend to you, and you’re certainly not allowed to be having this much fun without me.”
John wasn’t sure if he had the authority to make such claims or if he was grasping at straws. He assumed Mary and Victor were both armed, and Moran was probably still around somewhere. Moriarty had left his gun in John’s lap, instead of drawing it.
And if Sherlock had the faintest clues what that thing was, he’d have been bouncing off the walls with glee. But he
“I’d like to know that myself,” Lestrade said from the doorway, Ms. Hudson having apparently already let him in. Sherlock quickly dropped John's hands and shot up, his and John's position just compromising enough that even someone as dense as Lestrade might be able to sort out the shift in his and John's relationship that John wasn't ready for anyone else to know about.
“But John, this is important. And it involves you, although I don’t see why,” Sherlock’s voice trailed off and he seemed to retreat back into his mind, but John was now curious.
“Just tea. No milk, just sugar. And don't you dare suggest food. And I don’t want to go too far from the river. I just feel like I have to stay close," Sherlock said with determination. Then his voice got quieter and sounded frankly un-Sherlock-like as it wavered with uncertainty. "I can’t explain it, but it seems like the only thing that makes sense.”
Sherlock quickly grew upset that John was not sharing in his excitement. He ripped the journal from John’s hands and held it in the air over his head, out of John’s reach.
“What he probably needs is his boyfriend and world peace, but we can’t have everything now can we?” the man spat.
After all, the amount of people arrested for petty crimes who would turn out to have involvement in organized crime was abnormally high. Particularly when some of them would come in on a charge that if convicted to maximum sentencing would only get them a year but then would flat out confess to some other crime that held a minimum sentencing of anywhere between five and fifty times that if convicted.  And he didn’t even want to talk about the number of people who were just turning themselves in or the groups of criminals whose activity had been being tracked by entire divisions of the Met for ages seeming to disappear without a trace overnight.
"You knew John was alive. You knew what he'd been doing," Sherlock said softly, his tone a bit murderous.
He came back to his senses when he realized that Sherlock was grinding himself against his hip as he pleasured John. John was a very proud man, and he was far too proud to leave Sherlock to get off by dry humping him like a teenager, doing all of the work on his own. He managed to get between Sherlock’s groin and his hip, and Sherlock obliged to stop rutting against him for long enough for John to undo his trousers and shove his hand down his pants to grasp his cock.
“Maybe, maybe not. Could you get together that research team you promised me and have them look into the movement of all narrow boats in the past two days, and check CCTV along the wharf to check for any narrow boats and their movements?”
John had been very hesitant to enter into a relationship with Sherlock. He did repeatedly make it clear that he wanted to be, every time Sherlock had given John an opportunity to back out, John had responded by kissing him passionately. But maybe that was the problem. John wouldn’t talk to Sherlock about whatever it was that even now, after two weeks, made John sometimes become momentarily distant.
Sherlock read the message and looked up at John. John was staring back in horror. Sherlock looked back down at the text.
“We’ve got antibiotics and a first aid kit. Plus John’s a doctor. And he's a stubborn bastard. Just the kind of man to rise from the dead call me out. You hear that, you bastard. What do you have to say for yourself?”
It was an odd life that he had fallen in with, living and working with Victor and Mary. They were a very self-contained unit, neither Mary nor Victor seemed to have any connections with the outside world, nor any interest in doing even as much as going down to the pub together for a drink in the evenings. John had wondered if they were involved at first, even if just for the sake of not having to maintain complete abstinence in their isolation, but their relationship seemed to be strictly professional with negligible amounts of emotional attachment in any form. John very much had the sense that they viewed this as an assignment and after this was over they would likely never speak again. And if at any point leaving another behind became in the best interest in maintaining the integrity of the work that had done so far, neither of them would think twice about it.
Sherlock didn’t quite understand what was wrong with the life he had built for John around himself. The one with calculated risks and boring threats from lazy criminals. The one that was safe. That’s what John wanted, after all: to be safe from Moriarty. That’s what all his reactions pointed to.
No, jjust because his stomach had twisted awfully when Sherlock had rejected him the night they met, and had twisted just as bad every time since he had to brush off a joke or a misunderstanding about their partnership since then, it did not mean that he and Sherlock could ever be anything more. Just because his denials were growing increasingly terse and violent out of frustration of seeming to have to repeat it all the time, did not mean they were destined to be together.
The only times he was willing to let John out of his sight was when John had to go to work at the surgery or to go out for drink with Mike or Lestrade.
Moran held up a blow torch which flicked on with a hiss. John held his breath. Moran began to dance the flame across his chest. He never held the flame too close or on any one spot too long, but he’d still have second degree burns, not that he’d live long enough for it to matter. It wasn’t even so bad, at first, as far as he imagined torture went. He involuntarily strained his body as he tried to get himself away from the searing pain of the flame, but he didn’t scream. And Moran didn’t touch his back. John was beginning to wonder it Moran would grow bored, and what he was going to do next. But apparently even a man like Moran who was trained in inflicting suffering couldn’t come up with a full 48 hours’ worth of torture, because after about 20 minutes of playing with the flame across John’s skin, Moran switched off the flame and punched John in the face. Darkness quickly descended.
“Sorry to disappoint you John, secret ops teams rarely are all murder, explosion, murder, fight scene, murder. It’s a lot of recon and paperwork,” Victor quipped.
“That,” John shuddered just thinking about it, “Was an accident. You know I’ve been trying damn hard for there to not be any casualties,” he said defensively. Then his voice dropped lower, “It’s not hard to frame a body to look like a mugging gone wrong if you know what you’re doing.”
“So somewhere, there are three other bodies that are linked to this case, who all potentially could have been murdered as well, of a similar skin tone,” Sherlock intoned.
The streets in this part of town, at least at this time of day, which was roughly the middle of the afternoon, were empty. Once or twice a car had driven past, the kind of moderately older, but certainly not in a classic way, carefully repaired to be as flashy as possible want-to-be sports cars that had a habit of blaring music or revving their engines as they passed. Otherwise, though, not another soul in sight.
He put out a search for him within his homeless network, although he wasn’t entirely up to trusting them after the Torture Chamber mishap. Granted, that was a simple misunderstanding for normal people to make. The intel he got from his network was usually only partial and riddled with normal people misunderstandings. In the past it had always been himself who had been able to sort out the normal people inaccuracies in deductions with ease. It was his fault he’d made a fool of himself and Lestrade.
All Moran had done was shoot a couple men through the head, and then delivered their bodies to various make shift operating theatres around the city. They weren’t very good men, in fact, they were criminals, Moriarty’s pawns that had run out of usefulness. John had already disposed of one of Moriarty’s pawns before, when he’d killed the cabbie. He had never felt guilty for that, not even for a second, because he had been protecting Sherlock.
The room fell silent for a moment, and John was certainly relieved to be able to have a brief break from the cracked man’s rambling questions. After a few more moments, much to John’s relief, Moriarty stood up from John’s lap and walked back over to the desk in the center of the room. He stood with his back to John as he rummaged around the table. John grew nervous with the curiosity of what he could be looking for, but was fairly certain that he was also not going to suddenly pull a gun out, turn around, and shoot him execution style. And as long as his life was not immediately threatened, John could work with the rest.
Sherlock was growing angry. For a while he had just felt the usual boredom and the resulting frustration, but now it was blooming into full blown rage. The world seemed to be falling apart around him. Or, rather, the world seemed to be doing just fine. Too fine, actually. His job, however, was falling apart. And his job, the work, was his world. So to find that there didn’t seem to be a need for him anymore, when he was supposed to be the world’s only consulting detective, solving crimes when the police are out of their depths, which previously had been always, was becoming increasingly difficult to bare.
After the doctor left the man and woman, Victor and Mary, apparently, had come back in. They detailed how they had been watching the boat, waiting for the right moment to save him. That they’d been watching Moriarty’s movements regarding John for weeks now. They couldn’t get to the boat until it went down, none the less do anything to help John earlier, out of fear that Moriarty would still be watching too closely. They needed the panic of the wreck. After it had begun to sink, Victor had gone in with scuba gear, but was delayed because of Sherlock’s vantage point and they'd had to move their boat to the other side of the wreck. No one could see John be pulled out of the Thames or it would “ruin everything.” And apparently "everything" was a secret initiative to bring Moriarty down.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock sighed. "You’re safe. I won’t let him hurt us, do you understand? He'll be nothing by the time I'm through with him.” Sherlock babbled reassurances, but John couldn’t bring himself to listen to them. He smiled weakly at Sherlock, but he felt nauseated.
All Sherlock could think was that he had waited so long he couldn't wait any longer. He couldn't go through awkward small talk, of getting to re-know each other, of processing things. He needed John in the way he used to need cocaine. He needed John injected into him, fogging his mind.
Moriarty reached back to the tray and picked up a straight razor. He held it up for John to see and it glimmered in the late afternoon light that poured through the large windows.
The case, while he wasn’t exactly sure what he was supposed to be trying to achieve, proved interesting enough. He’d gotten Molly, who after a moment of surprise at Sherlock’s sudden appearance in her lab and a confused but concerned “How are you doing?,” which Sherlock ignored, she fell into step alongside him and agreed to test the sample of blood that Sherlock had collected from Mrs. Huxley’s wall.
“Well it is an American journal, so we were able to rule out a lot of people who might have the skill set after checking with immigration. There were a couple subscribers who are doctors from the UK or other near enough parts of Europe who are well respected, who have families and children that would make their manipulation on Moriarty’s hand easy,”
At first it was agitating to Sherlock, who only grew frustrated when his brain slowed down with the fog of alcohol. But he found that if he pushed it far enough he could turn his mind completely off. But waking up with a headache that wouldn’t quit and to find Trevor in his kitchen cheerily making tea and waiting to shove a paracetamol down his throat while he recounted Sherlock’s blackout adventures was not remotely worth it.
“While there are probably some people in the world who do possess the skills to both kill and perform such an operation, why would you look for one person who can, by chance, do both of these highly skilled things when you could find two. It was likely that a trained assassin killed the victims, and then brought the bodies to be altered by another person! I mean, you’ve probably checked this scene and the other two thoroughly. There is nothing to indicate that the victims were killed here. No marks in the wall from the bullet, no traces of blood that indicate fatality. These are old cement floors, highly porous, it would be incredibly hard to remove all traces of blood if it were spilled here. Even if you soaked the floor in bleach for an extended period of time, you’d have noticed the bleach stain. And there is no evidence these floors have been painted over recently. The man could have been killed over a tarp or something, but then that would have likely involved him being dragged here still alive. That level of kidnapping and criminal organization would likely be out of the level of skill of our doctor.
“So, Holmes, you’ve been solving crimes with the police? Good for you mate,” Victor grinned at him before stuffing another forkful of pie into his mouth. “Funny we keep running into each other after not seeing each other in what, a dozen years? What are the chances?”
On the tenth day, Molly showed up again, perhaps at Ms. Hudson's urging and they spent the day playing all sort of games and puzzles, anything to "take his mind off of things," as Molly said.
of November. Or perhaps December 2011. Or December 1911 or 1811 or so on. So I’m running the dates to see if there are any events that might correspond with the initials DMJS,” Sherlock rattled in explanation, using his ‘you’re being thick and dragging me down with you’ voice.
Moran pulled back before jabbing the knife into John, and left it there. Well at least he wouldn't get the joy of quickly bleeding out, although the wound was still beginning to bleed furiously around he knife.
Normally, people didn’t need to tell Sherlock things for him to know. Sherlock would be able to figure it out all on his own. It was what he did. He could read peoples life stories from the lines on their faces and the bend of their hands. But right now he couldn't read John at all. And it made him want to tear his hair out.
“No. Throwing yourself into the river is only going to cause you to get hypothermia and ruin that expensive coat of yours, best case scenario. Properly equipped rescue units are already on their way, and there is no conclusive evidence that anyone was even on board,” Mycroft reassured as he let his brother go and left him sprawled on the pavement. “And I never want to hear you make another goddamn comment about my weight again,” he added.
“Oh, of course, I apologize. I didn’t break you. You were broken long before I ever came along. Sherlock was just a plaster, wasn’t he? Just enough to hold you together and keep out dirty nightmares. But you’re a doctor John, you should know that wounds don’t heal when they’re infected.”
He noted that he’d been admitted under a fake name, Adam Nelson, apparently. And his stats were all a bit skewed as well. The height listed was far more generous that John ever attempted to lie about, claiming he was 5 foot 11 inches. His weight was inflated as well, listing him at nearly thirteen and a half stone, when even at his most muscular or let go he would generally only reach just over maybe eleven and a half, and after the stress that he’d been through recently, he was likely closer to ten. His bullet wound was left completely unnoted.
“The hair removal is probably a bit overkill,” Anderson said, appearing out of nowhere, much to Sherlock’s displeasure. Sherlock saw John startle in surprise out of the corner of his eye and his desire to strangle Anderson increased tenfold. “There are other ways to get DNA. The whole body is made of it.” Anderson finished haughtily.
They sat in silence on the way back up the river. It wasn’t until Sherlock could see the clock tower rising in the distance that Mycroft spoke.
Moriarty looked like John had slapped him, once again rearing back from John, but he quickly regained his composure.
“No, I sent it to that little assassin friend of yours, Johnny. The cute little blonde thing with a gun, surely you haven't forgotten? You two make a beautiful pair, I haven’t told you before. It’s like you two could be twins, both… compact and unassuming. Cute in kind of a plain way, but ready to destroy the world for the sake of it.” Moriarty’s hand had returned to stroking John’s hair, and John forced himself to lean into the touch in a way that he hoped came off as unconscious, although the way he was grinding down defensively in his jaw told another story.
And then he saw Sherlock, laying sprawled out on the couch of 221B, hands steepled under his chin, looking like the world was beneath him.
Sherlock left John’s lips again in favor of his neck, and John took the opportunity to gasp as Sherlock’s hands slipped themselves under his jumper, those marvelous fingers dancing along his stomach and then to his back along his spine.
“Victor was hoping to be able to pull you out of the river and apply some antiseptic and give you a couple paracetamol and move on. We had to call the super emergency untraceable line for him from our burner phone that we were told to never call ever unless it actually is the apocalypse in order to get you into hospital without risking the Scotland Yard checking area hospitals for John Does or someone who otherwise looked like you.” That explained the false ID and statistics, although now that John thought about it, that was obvious. “You’re in a private facility in Croydon, I’m sure you already know that we’ve had your records here falsified.”
“Really, Holmes, I thought that you had some tact. Do you think that if I had anything to do with that guy, which I’ve told you I don’t, that I’d tell you now? After what, accidentally running into the Peacemaker himself in the streets?”
What day was it? Sherlock clicked on his mobile. It was half noon on a Friday. If traffic wasn’t complete shit, he should easily make it in time. Abandoning his plans at the Yard, he hailed a cab and headed off to Fitzrovia.
“I need to get some air,” John said quickly before turning and rushing out of the flat before Sherlock could say another word.
Did that mean that Moriarty didn’t even view Sherlock as an enemy anymore? Perhaps he didn’t send the video to Sherlock to lure him in, but rather just to break John? But that couldn’t be right, Sherlock was still a genius. He was still at the end of the day Moriarty’s biggest threat. John had only ever just been a primer. It was always Sherlock’s job to destroy Moriarty. John wasn’t suited for the job he'd become the muscle, more than he ever should have been able to, but Sherlock was the brains.
So he’d asked Lestrade to get a search warrant to enter the property. Mrs. Huxley’s and his homeless networks testimony were not actually a lot to go on, apparently. But Lestrade had found a JP who had a particularly strong vendetta against gang violence and played up Michael Huxley’s dedicated involvement in the government, another thing that this magistrate was obviously pretty fond of as dictated by his career choice.
“He was shot. In the head,” came John’s voice suddenly, pulling Sherlock out of his reverie. His voice had been quiet, and was laced with an emotion that Sherlock couldn’t identify, but could only attempt to describe as cold.
The brush continued to dance along John’s jaw, occasionally dabbing at it to accentuate some of Moriarty’s words.
On the eleventh day, he just sat there. He sat there using every bit of energy just to keep himself in his seat. He needed something. He needed to do something. He couldn't wait any longer. But he couldn't leave. He had to wait.
“You’re wrong,” Sherlock said. John couldn’t tell if Sherlock was doing that mind reading thing he sometimes did or if he was referring to the comments that John had actually made out loud, or a combination of both.
“Oh, really, I do believe that your brother has commissioned me to babysit you after you were found en route to a crack den,” Trevor quipped.
Lestrade and Mycroft shared a relieved glance, although they still had far too much pity in their eyes for Sherlock’s liking.
That’s all he was now. A beige jumper. A beige jumper that also happened to have a mustard stain along the bottom hem. Brilliant.
“I don’t understand. He what?” Lestrade had come down to the lab where he and Molly had been running an experiment involving the formation of bruises on bodies with different iron levels at time of death to give Sherlock some news that he was having a hard time believing.
Mycroft remained quiet. He reached out a hand and placed it on Sherlock's forearm. Something overcame his face that Sherlock had never seen before. If Sherlock had to call it something, he would have called it earnestness.
He couldn't take a case, if there were even any to take, because he couldn't risk some stranger being here when John came back.
, in your expert opinion? An enemy of yours perhaps? Or do you have some jilted lover from university that no one knows about but who you secretly harbor feelings for but broke up with anyway because you’re a stubborn arse who thinks he’s above things like love, but yet you expected Moriarty to somehow know about? What,
“The skin grafting though is astonishing. I have friends who’ve had grafts from burns and their skin doesn’t look quite right afterwards, and even still it takes time to heal,” Lestrade said.
“If they made us into a movie, which they won’t, since you know, we’re so secret that there isn’t even anything to classify, they’d write us as tortured lovers. The guy playing me would fuck the girl playing you probably obscenely in some place where people ought not to fuck.”
Finally, after another five stops, John was above ground again. He was supposed to be on a boat that was docked on the Isle of Dogs side of South Dock. A sense of foreboding began to fill John’s stomach as he got closer to the water. A the smallest, tiniest of voices in the back of his mind told him he was going to his death, but he pushed the thought away. No use getting worked up about it now.
” Mycroft had shouted at him by only the second day. With the insult to the chair, Sherlock had found enough anger to power himself upwards and to the toilet before coming back to the chair and collapsing into it, burying his face, all without even a glance at Mycroft.
Nearly an hour later, thanks to a tedious amount of traffic Sherlock stood outside the Canary Wharf underground station, and he started heading north. Lestrade hadn’t arrived yet, and he didn’t expect Mycroft to come along, this being a bit too close to the kind of field work he despised.
John swam as fast as he could towards where the door should have been. Exerting himself and the rising panic was not at all helping his cause. Somehow, despite the chains still binding his wrists, John made it upwards towards where he thought the stairs that led to the exterior door of the boat were.
“Thank fucking God, go have fun,” John muttered, barely looking up from his medical journal, but with a small smile, pleased at Sherlock’s change of mood.
“Of course. It was my mistake to not realize how the incident with Moriarty might have affected you. I understand how people react psychologically to trauma and it was too optimistic of me to hope that you’d be completely fine. You are after all just a person.”
But after their fight, he became quick to make sure he didn’t try to take things too far again, and he and John quickly fell back into their rather domestic pattern.
So Sherlock was going to take the biggest dose he could handle after being clean for so long, collapse onto a filthy mattress, and retreat into his mind palace until he felt like it was back enough in order that maybe he could go out into the world and be able to make sense of it. He’d even traded in his usual Saville Row kit for a hoodie, track pants, and trainers in an effort of better blending in in the territory that he was venturing into and for the comfort of an extended stay.
Darkness surrounded John, he seemed to be floating in some sort of void. After an unmeasured moment he realized he was lying against something hard and cold and there was a heavy and unfamiliar weight on his chest. His hands reached out, groping nothing but what he realized was a tile floor, which he was lying on.
He was nearly to the NSY, about to turn onto Broadway, when someone passing in the opposite direction slipped something into his hand. Sherlock stopped dead, unfolding the slip of paper that he’d been handed.
“Did you make noises like this for Sherlock, Johnny? I know we haven’t talked about that aspect of your relationship with him before, but we all know you were fucking,” Moriarty remained grinning, but his eyes grew dark. “Or were at least building up to it anyway, you sweet innocent things.” John felt a rush of cold on his back and realized that Moran must have dumped water on it in a less than halfhearted attempt to wash off the chemicals. But John was having an easier time ignoring the searing in his back since he was beginning to feel rage boiling in the pit of his stomach.
He felt his voice beginning to grow horse when finally the door of the room slammed open and Moran came storming in.
It’s not, of course, that London was free of crime. People still murdered their exes and their business associates. Money was still being stolen by employees from their companies. People would still go missing. Children were still molested by their coach or their babysitter. But there was no
Sherlock didn’t even bother to read Mycroft’s texts before he put the phone down and bounded across the room to John.
“But I’m the most competent piece of work in my field, which isn’t even a real field at all but rather simply just being pretty fucking brilliant,” Mary mumbled defensively to save face.
Sherlock looked shocked and Lestrade was completely taken aback and was entirely sure he’d missed something very important. Sherlock was beginning to think he had as well.
“But—,” John started trying to sound conflicted and a bit meek, which wasn’t exactly hard. “But what about Sherlock?”
Whatever Moran had given him earlier seemed to be wearing off. His back was beginning to sting and his shoulder was currently as a dull ache.
“Wait Sherlock, I haven’t finished. None of them are surgeons.” Sherlock ignored Lestrade and crouched quietly for a few minutes. Then his eyes widened with a sudden realization and he flung himself up from the chair again continued to wear down the rug.
“You have done so well, Johnny, but unfortunately your usefulness has almost run out. I only have one more thing I need from you,” Moriarty said. John said nothing. There wasn’t anything to say anymore. There hadn’t been since that night three weeks ago. Moriarty had been right.
He found himself on his feet, stepping around John’s chair and reaching out to pick up the skull. He smoothed his fingers along it. “
He would do this, whatever was asked of him. And then Sherlock once and for all could be safe. And then John could reassess if there was any space left in the world for himself. If he didn’t die in the process, of course.
He tried to inhale, trying to find some scent of John there. Perhaps the scent of John’s soap or of tea that he’d spilled, but instead found that he couldn’t breathe through his nose enough to smell anything.
“What friends?” Sherlock scoffed. “I only have a handful of people who would even consider associating themselves with me willingly. You’re busy and dull. I detest Mycroft. Mrs. Hudson is tedious. John’s dead.”
Finally Moriarty moved, going over to look out a window. The glass was dirty and warped, impenetrable with the eye, but yet Moriarty stared, enraptured.
“That’s because he’s gone abroad! There’s been rumblings of him all over the world! It’s ridiculous,” Sherlock huffed.
“I just thought, John,” Sherlock’s voice was softer now, and John’s name on his lips now sent a shiver down John’s spine. “That Moriarty, for all he claims to be, would manage to know something I didn’t know. I know that I care for you, John, which something that I have been informed of enough times now that I acknowledged it as the truth a long time ago. But I imagined a mastermind like Moriarty would be able to come up with something a little less cliché than kidnapping a targets partner to upset them," Sherlock said gently with a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
“I think you’ve been pretending that you’re some super spy who doesn’t have a libido that she can’t take care of herself for far too long now and you need to get laid before I find that instead of strategy plans and mission reports on your laptop like there should be there’s a manuscript of an erotic novel starring James Wilson and Sherman Hoyle.”
“You still really don’t have a clue about any of it, do you?” Moriarty said, sounding exasperated. “God you’ve become so dim.”
Apparently, judging by the tone of John’s voice, Sherlock’s suggestion had not at all been an appropriate one.
Sherlock pulled his arm back and launched the skull across the room, letting out an anguished cry as he did so. It hit the wall and shattered.
“Hey, mate, you alright?” Victor asked as he walked back towards Sherlock. “Hey, come on let’s go get some espresso in you, alright?” Victor suggested, and Sherlock found himself nudged into step by a brush of his forearm from Victors own.
Huxley had adamantly denied that he was the one who had killed the assassin. He continued to claim that while he did in fact possess a weapon, the one that had been recovered in the abandoned flat he had been squatting in was not his. Sherlock had half the mind to believe him, but as far as what the evidence pointed to, manslaughter was added to Huxley’s apparently rather long list of charges.
“Moriarty.” John felt his body turn to ice at the mention of the name. “I can’t understand why he took you,” Sherlock continued on. “I suppose it is the obvious choice, but it’s almost too obvious. Moriarty likes surprises, he likes twists and turns like he’s choreographing ice dancers rather than organizing a criminal network.”
“I’ve got to go,” John murmured, snatching the phone from Sherlock, clicking the phones screen off abruptly, and shoving it in his pocket.
John felt another wave of panic run through him. How did Sherlock know? Had he talked in his sleep? Sherlock wasn’t supposed to know. It wasn’t a part of the plan.
“The friend even acquired a bit of a nickname, you know. He was so shrouded in anonymity, people had to invent a new name for him. Do you know what they called him?” Moriarty asked.
“Don’t you dare, you know nothing of our relationship! Don’t pretend that you do. I’ve been around Sherlock long enough to know that half of his deductions are just guesses. Don’t pretend for a second that you were ever even remotely a part of that part of our lives.”
“The only thing keeping John from being a suspect is that he’s John. He's an excellent surgeon, or was before his injury and career change. He does subscribe to that medical journal. He has ties to Moriarty, technically. Since it doesn’t appear that he has an alibi anymore, also counting the fact that he’s missing now, makes him seem like the only real option.”
"Of course I do!" Sherlock burst out. Then he stilled, and much more quietly said, "It wasn't his fault."
After finding out that apparently been Michael Huxley was in fact not some saint caught up with a gang, but rather someone who had stolen highly classified intelligence and had proceeded to go rogue. For some reason MI5 had not thought to inform the Met of this when they opened an investigation into Huxley. The flash drive he’d been carrying around was the intelligence in question, and Huxley had been hoarding it hoping it to use it in whatever scenario proved to be most to his advantage.
He was alive. But something wasn’t right. Instead of the London skyline it was dark. Not even night dark, just pitch black. The water had a faint shimmer to it, reflecting light from somewhere, but otherwise John might as well have been blind. He reached up and his hands hit something hard and smooth just a foot above his head. He frantically pushed himself forward and found himself bouncing off a wall. It was like he was in a box.
“Hold that thought,” Sherlock said and John was momentarily confused until Sherlock pushed against John, rolling them across the mattress so they lay parallel to the length of the bed, also leaving it so Sherlock was now on top.
“No Johnny that would be the worst thing I could do. I could, of course, if I wanted to. Of course I could. I could grind you into the ground with the heel of my shoe. But that wouldn’t mean anything anymore, would it? You’re already dead, after all, and now you’ve dragged me down with you. Maybe I could rebuild on my own, but it would take ages. You left quite the impression. Even if I dragged around your corpse with me to business meetings, I don’t think I’d ever be able to convince anyone the Peacemaker is gone, would I?” Moriarty was now leaning down close to John almost nuzzling his neck, so close that John could feel his breath on his neck and his lips ghosting against his earlobe. John let out another involuntary gasp. Moriarty hummed into his ear while simultaneously grinding his arse against John’s lap. John thrust against his restraints in panic, ignoring the stabs of pain throughout his body that resulted in the protest.
And then that’s where things started to get interesting. Mrs. Huxley’s son, Michael, was apparently not just some kid who felt lost, fell in with the wrong people, and then royally fucked up. Rather he was a genius. Not quite like Sherlock was, but he was very, very good at maths and had apparently been contracted to work with the government regarding something top secret and dangerous. Sherlock of course hadn’t wanted to ask Mycroft on his own. He was not particularly up to asking his brother for anything ever again after all the babysitting his brother did for him to keep him from accidentally killing himself out of grief and ambivalence for life. But ultimately he deigned to, only to receive nothing more than a confirmation that Michael Huxley had had some government involvement. It was completely unhelpful.
Sherlock halted to look at Lestrade. His face looked soft, like he was going to have to give Sherlock some bad news, and Sherlock realized that there was a foreboding hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“Just because Moriarty’s gone AWOL right now doesn’t mean that everyone who works for him and everyone who is loyal to him has suddenly disappeared. They’re all still operating, many of them are still in London. The cab driver, the Chinese smugglers, there are so many more people like them that are still in operation, waiting for Moriarty’s orders. Waiting to repay the debts they've acquired through his assistance. And the fact that Moriarty is likely abroad or in hiding right now makes it a perfect opportunity to find them and take them out without it catching his notice,” Victor explained.
He had tried, of course, to stop even these these outings from happening, but John refused to quit his job or stop seeing his friends, or to agree to let Sherlock come along. At the mere suggestion from Sherlock, John threw a fit, calling Sherlock controlling, stating that he still needed his space sometimes, telling him that there was no way this could work if he didn’t let him live his life. It was the biggest row in their two weeks of being in a relationship, and John had slept in his own bed that night.
“I was just thinking that if he’s been hiding out, surely he could hide out on the continent and help us. I’m sure our man can get us some sort of fixer to arrange for him to be moved out of England and the paperwork to allow him to move around Europe, at least, until we move on to other places and need to cross oceans or more secure borders.”
Lestrade had finally pulled him out of his mind palace to tell him that it was now early afternoon the next day and there were some more pressing matters at hand, but so far it seemed that in fact there were not, since Lestrade didn’t appear to have any leads.
John cringed. That was the part he’d refused to think about, wanting to block it out. He was a doctor, had been a doctor, but either way he was supposed to save people whenever he could. He could not hold a knife to another person’s body again without vomiting, but still that saving people instinct was there. But sometimes, things had happened. It was only ever in self-defense, when things had gone horribly wrong. He was hardly an assassin or executioner, but still it had been--
Sherlock felt like he’d been punched in the stomach. He couldn’t bring himself to move, so instead he stood paralyzed on the sidewalk until Victor stopped talking to the other man, and the other man stepped around Victor and continued on his way.
“Are you sure?” he whispered. Sherlock’s excitement faltered when he noticed that terrified look in John’s eyes.
He realized the sirens were gone. Everything was quiet. John had probably been taken away, was on his way to some hospital somewhere.
“Sherlock, do you realize how cruel you’re being right now?” Lestrade finally said, and it was like a bomb exploding in Sherlock’s mind.
” John had exclaimed in frustration when Sherlock had made the suggestion of running to the Tesco down the street. Sherlock had been insistent, though, that he absolutely needed Jammie Dodgers, and the only thing he would eat them with was orange juice, as it was something he’d done as a child and he was feeling nostalgic. He’d quickly come to regret this lie horribly when John dunked one of the biscuits in the orange juice and held it in front of Sherlock expectantly. When Sherlock was unable to hide his disgust, despite trying valiantly to eat the soggy sickeningly sweet biscuit, he mumbled something about having forgotten that it was actually hobnobs with blackcurrant squash and he didn’t combine the two, anyway.
John considered for a second taking another pause, as much as he hated the concept, to remove some more clothing, but then felt Sherlock’s hand dive through the slit in the front of his pants and grasp his cock, causing John to gasp. When Sherlock had gotten his trousers unbuttoned John wasn’t sure, but he didn’t care.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade said softly. “Why don’t you call a friend and ask them to have dinner or go to the pub or something?”
Ms. Hudson heard the vacuum running she came running up the stairs like Sherlock was using it to strangle himself.
deduced John’s problem. He had figured out that Moriarty had traumatized John more than he initially thought. However, he couldn’t get John to tell him why, even after Sherlock had promised to protect him, and Sherlock kept seeing that look of terror sometimes cross John’s face.
“But Moriarty is out of the picture right now, he told me,” John exclaimed. “And Sherlock. And the Yard. And Mycroft. They’re all taking care of Moriarty. I don’t understand. How did you know I was on the boat anyway? If Sherlock couldn’t find me in time, then how could—,” John trailed off, confused and feeling awfully tired again.
Sherlock was surprised however to find that the place he met Victor at was relatively quiet. The after work rush that left every pub in London overflowing onto the sidewalks had died down. The pub, tucked away down by Embankment, had the kind of atmosphere that made Sherlock’s bespoke suit look not out of place, but was also laid back enough for Trevor with his dark jeans, rumpled cotton button down, and trainers. The pub had a decent view of the river and skyline on the south side of the river, and tables by the windows were all occupied, but Sherlock and Trevor had occupied a small booth in the back corner of the pub and more or less had their privacy. Trevor had ordered a bottle of wine for them to split. It was relatively cheap, part of some offer the pub was running, but palatable, and Sherlock deigned to sip at his glass.
John said nothing in response. Instead, he quickly twisted Victor around so that he was gripping the man in front of him, shielding himself behind the other man’s body and holding the gun he'd pulled from his waistband to his friends head.
“I’m not a big fan of getting my hands dirty, which is why Sebby’s still here. But I do want, in case they manage to fish your body out of the river, and I hope they do, for Sherlock to know that I’ve left my mark on you.” Moriarty approached John with a switch blade in his hand.
He was rather cruel to her though, out of frustration over the stupid games, over Molly's poor strategy, over his impatience in general.
He tried to hurry as he made the transfer at Waterloo, but his leg had been acting up again since the incident with Moriarty. He’d been trying his best to hide it from Sherlock, and had by no small miracle succeeded. But right now his leg was aching horribly as he limped along. At least his tremor hadn’t come back, thank God. He wasn’t sure what he would have possibly done if that had happen.
“The Yard were there. And, and Sherlock. Apparently a private client of his had gotten themselves involved in the gang. With the gang involvement though Sherlock must have wound up getting help from the Yard. They had a warrant to search the property. Victor tried to escape before they saw him, but didn't get out in time. He’s been arrested. He’s confessed to being a member of an opposing gang rather than compromise us.”
“Oh, I plan on it Watson,” Moran smirked, pulling a whip out of his belt and smacking John harshly across the chest with it. “We’ll start off slow,” Moran snapped the whip again, leaving a second welt across John’s chest. Several more fell and John stubbornly refused to make a noise.
“You’re just so fun to play with though, aren’t you Johnny? And quite likeable. I’d be a fool to claim I didn’t understand what everyone else sees in you. You’re adorable, aren't you? Sherlock’s adorable little pet blogger, was it? But you’re my pet now, aren’t you? I do love my pets. I like to take care of them, make them feel special, don’t I? Though I certainly don’t go as far as… bestiality,” Moriarty chuckled, again seeming to contradict his statement by grinding himself against John again. “Don’t I Sebby?” John heard a grunt from across the room, confirming Moran’s presence. “Moran's a bit different than you though. I've never played with him like this, wouldn't be any fun," he smirked at John before quickly lightening his tone. "Sebby, could you pull that table over there to us? I’ve just gotten comfortable and I’d hate to move.”
John collapsed onto the sofa, groaning. “All I said was that I was here to make peace. It’s a perfectly reasonable thing to say,” he muttered.
“Oh, been bouncing around a bit, you know. Serious jobs turned out to not be for me. Just kind of make money when I need to or get too bored. Mostly when I get bored. Could probably live off family money if I wanted to, but it feels good to earn your money. I’m not quite as good at turning hobbies into full time jobs as you appear to have been,” Victor shrugged.
“Yeah, kind of like J-,” Sherlock stopped. “Like a soldier.” Victor laid an arm on his shoulder and looked at him sympathetically. Sherlock and Victor had never formally spoken about John, but Sherlock had always worked with the assumption that somehow or another Victor knew, about all of it. How he knew Sherlock didn’t know, and couldn’t bring himself to ask.
“Oh, Victor, long time no see, isn’t it?” Moriarty said calmly. He was no longer looking down at John, but rather behind him, staring off into the distance at the people that John could not see for himself. There was silence in response.
,” John moaned, tipping his head back to give Sherlock better access to his neck. Unfortunately though, Sherlock’s lips left his neck as he moved to stand up, grabbing John’s hand and pulling him up after him.
“It’s Moriarty,” Sherlock felt like all the air had been sucked out of his lungs at the mention of the name. “He knows. He knows about everything, and he’s got him and he’s fucking going to kill him and I can’t risk a one man rescue mission. I need all the help I can get, Vic. If we lose him, then what was even the point?”
“So, this has something to do with narrow boating?” Lestrade asked, standing up and walking over to Sherlock.
The words echoed in John’s mind as he regained consciousness. They were followed by a panicked stream of one conscious thought of his ex-lovers name.
than Christmas. He could have never imagined how wonderful it could be to be having regular sex with someone. Or hell, even just to be cuddled next to someone on the sofa while bickering about the idiocrasy of reality television or to be dragged into an alley way for a snog after a day running about in London. It didn’t get in the way. It made his mind sharper. It made him more eager. It made his body pulse with a new found energy.
“Well, I don’t know, I just, I thought that there was something familiar about the way he stood,” Sherlock snapped, but there was a meekness to it.
He was hesitant to leave John alone even with Mrs. Hudson in the safety of the flat. She was herself a rather formidable woman, but wouldn’t understand the direness of John’s need for protection even if Sherlock tried to explain it, and John would likely end up volunteering to run out and pick up some milk and never return home.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and puffed up defensively. Yes, Mycroft paid him for things, but he didn’t pay for his things. At least not usually.  More often Sherlock found ways to extort money from his brother. But he wasn’t some spoilt posh kid taking handouts from family money, and certainly not from Mycroft.
John said coldly. He didn’t want to sound afraid. He was a soldier,he was trained for situations like this. But his mind was racing as he tried to piece together what was going on.
They could have sat like that for hours for all Sherlock knew. From his understanding of it later, it was nearly two and a half hours of the three of them sitting silently on the bench. The sun had set, the sky fading into the blue of twilight before any of them spoke.
The sign read and Sherlock froze. Missed him? Where had he been? Where was he going? What was going to happen to him? Had they been keeping him somewhere nearby but just transported him somewhere else? Or did that indicate something more morbid?
“Mycroft! What are you doing here?” Sherlock snapped, walking over to his arm chair, stepping up onto it, and then crouching down to sit with his arms wrapped around his knees.
But wanting Sherlock was something that didn’t get thought about, because Sherlock wasn’t like that and John had no problem not being like that either. And now, after what had happened, it was imperative that he stay as far away from Sherlock as possible without raising suspicion. Over the past week since the incident with Moriarty, John had come up with excuses to not go with Sherlock out on as many cases as he could get away with. He’d spent most nights out with women, any woman that would have him, in order to get out of the flat.
“So you do have suspects! Why are you always so slow? Have you brought them in for questioning yet?” Sherlock asked, stopping his pacing to climb up into his chair like a cat and perch, hands steepled to think about the new information.
“I had heard you having nightmares all week, and I thought that it was just a return of your PTSD because of the stress. But Moriarty said something to you, something that you didn’t tell me, didn’t he? And you’ve been keeping it from me, haven't you? You foolish, stubborn man! Why do you always have to be so brave?"
“That’s something else I was here to tell you Sherlock,” Lestrade interceded. “We can’t definitively ID all of the bodies, but this most recent body matches the build of an ex-con who we believe to have ties to Moriarty. We found that he had some reconstructive work done on his knee after a gunshot wound, and the serial numbers on the pins match those recorded in his medical records. Unfortunately the other bodies don’t have any similar surgical work done that could be used to identify them, but assuming that the bodies are all part of the pattern, which we’ve been assuming, it’s likely that the victims had similar backgrounds.”
John made three very large mistakes that afternoon. The first was exploding at Sherlock and threatening to leave him, sparking Sherlock’s decision to take drastic measures by journeying to previously avoided territory. The second was giving into his desire and allowing their relationship to be taken to that new level. And the third and probably biggest mistake was to fall asleep afterwards.
“But Moriarty is active again, John, that puts you at risk! I said I wouldn’t let him hurt you again and I meant it,” Sherlock said in exasperation.
Moran had pushed the table into Moriarty’s reach, and then quickly went to stand somewhere behind John again. Moriarty reached out to the table and picked up what turned out to not be a scalpel, but rather a shaving brush and a dish of shaving cream. He began to lather it over John’s face. The sensation of it in another scenario may have been soothing, but John found himself over sensitized after his panic attack and brush tickling along his jaw felt more unbearable that the pain in his chest.
“But what if we sent a message to them instead? What if we made an example of them? ‘If you get involved with Moriarty, this is what happens to you’,” John said slowly.
Then suddenly the floor seemed to fall out from under him, and Moriarty’s face appeared above him, contorted with mad laughter.
There was a sound of the front door opening and closing again. Sherlock stood on the landing for a moment, his head spinning. Moriarty. Moriarty was back and he’d kidnapped someone. Someone important. The Peacemaker? Victor
The next time he woke up, the clock read 27 hours. He considered what kind and what dose of sedative would be enough to keep him under for that long, but John didn’t particularly care. It wasn’t exactly as if he had wanted to savor his remaining time on earth. Plus, his shoulder wasn’t killing him anymore.
John knocked back the rest of his beer before dropping the can and lunging at Mary. She quickly jumped to her feet, holding her can over her head with a victorious and maniacal grin on her face.
“Half seven. There are going to be tourists buzzing about soon down here and we can’t have you lying here like a bum. What were you hoping to accomplish anyway by sleeping rough?”
Eventually the car Victor was in slowed to a halt. Sherlock stuffed a few more twenty pound notes to the cabbie and got out of the car before it had even come to a complete halt. He looked ahead to see the blond woman who had been with Victor heading into a building. Sherlock quickly pursued.
“Oh dear, that’s my queue,” Moriarty said, suddenly moving away from Sherlock, making his way towards the door. “I’ve got knew plans, Sherlock, plans that are far bigger than you.”
And for a second a far too large part of him expected to see John sitting there, like it was the only possible reality just because he'd been able to imagine it.
And yesterday, he’d been called away, right into Moriarty’s hands, and he’d walked willingly. Sherlock had been spending weeks trying to protect John from Moriarty, but all along he’d already failed so profoundly. It was never Sherlock who’d been protecting John from Moriarty, it had been the other way around.
Sherlock furrowed his brow and felt anger and confusion rise up at his brother’s nearly uncharacteristic words.
“Alright, I know I’ve already mentioned it, but this body, it’s incredibly, well, creepy. Feels like what you’d get if you mixed a horror, espionage, and and alien film together.”
“John, while that in theory sounds like a feasible plan, if this were, you know, a high budget Hollywood espionage film, how the hell do you plan to be more terrifying than Moriarty?”
“Well, I see my work here is done, if you don’t mind?” he said suddenly, before slowly backing away from John and then turning to casually waltz across the room to another door at the end of the room.
Sherlock remained quiet, as it seemed like the best thing to do, while Moriarty began to tell his tale, like he was telling a story to a child.
He then demanded that Sherlock finish his glass of orange juice and the small mountain of biscuits that he had already laid out on a plate anyway, no matter how he wanted to eat them.
“Yeah, plus if we were going to take anyone out, Mary or I could do it just fine. We don’t need you getting blood on your hands,” Victor laughed, looking pointedly at John's trembling hand that lay uselessly on the armrest of the rain. Since the incident, John's limp and tremor had returned full force. Since being released from the hospital, the psychosomatic pain and instability had been lessening, but had still not completely receded.
He remembered him begging Sherlock not to confess his feelings for him. He remembered John warning him that they might not work out.
He’d had to rip every physical thing that made a person who they were off if them. It had to of been gruesome. It had to of been violent.
John felt some tension slip from his shoulders. Maybe he had misunderstood what Sherlock’s opening up had meant. Maybe he was just projecting his feelings for Sherlock onto him. Of course Sherlock admitting that he cared for John didn’t mean anything more than that. He had already known they were friends. That’s probably all Sherlock meant. John was just so wound up about Moriarty that he was expecting the worst when it wasn’t even coming. Sherlock was right, none of this was new information. Sherlock may have never said it, but it was obvious that if a man with a reputation like Sherlock's kept someone around for as much time as he kept John around, Sherlock was at least a little fond of him, even if the reasons Sherlock was fond of John might not be any of the normal reasons one person liked another.
He found himself a few minutes later wandering through Regent’s park. It was a very grey day and had been raining on and off, so the park was quiet, besides a few stubborn joggers and dog walkers. He found dryer looking bench and sat down to try to think, but the thing that he needed to think about most hurt too much to even consider. What had happened with Moriarty was too much, it took everything in him to pretend to be as fine as he had been for Sherlock. But now it seemed like Sherlock was finally asking for something that John couldn’t give him. Not for the reasons that he’d used before, no, something much, much worse. But he couldn’t help but want it, still, none the less.
“There was a new study recently in which donor skin was taken from donors who have passed, as you would for most other organ donations. The process allows them to take more than what had been taken in full-thickness grafts previously, taking the full dermis, but also the layers of tissue in the reticular region and part of the hypodermis. The process was tested specifically as an effort to create more aesthetically pleasing grafts. The process received a lot of criticism, because as far as limiting the chance of complication and ease of recovery, research into skin gun technology is probably a better use of research.
It didn’t matter though, he had a case to solve, and he was going to prove to himself that he didn’t need John to do it. He had made a mistake, a horrible mistake, but he refused to make another one.
Fingers continued to trace up and down John’s jaw, but John hardly noticed anymore as his mind span trying to make sense of what Moriarty was telling him.
There had been a couple more hackers in France who had been pretty easy to shut down. It turned out that these bigger fish kinds of operations were easier to take down than John had initially thought because while the people involved may be been busy and strong enough to not be completely owned by Moriarty, they were also heavily sought after by governments in their own country. All he’d have to do was help Mary with a bit of tailing and leave the information somewhere the French government would stumble upon it and think it to be their own intelligence and they arrested the group of hackers without John having to meet any of them face to face.
He found himself gasping as he fell back into the door, a sob escaping his throat. He leaned forwards to counteract the fact that it felt as if his knees were about to buckle and stumbled forwards, grasping onto the arm of Johns chair to catch himself. His head fell limp between his arms as he began to sob uncontrollably. His knees did buckle and he found himself kneeling against John’s chair, his head buried in the armrest.
“Victor!” Sherlock cried out. Victor suddenly was caught up with another man, spinning the other man towards a wall, making it so Sherlock couldn’t see the other man's face. The other man made a gesture in the process as if to pull something from his side, but Sherlock couldn't see enough to see what that was. The whole affair looked as if it was made as part of a friendly greeting, but Sherlock couldn’t help but be suspicious that Victor was purposefully hiding the other man’s identity from Sherlock.
“What would it matter if I did? It doesn’t matter,” John finally found his voice, but it of course betrayed him, saying exactly the wrong thing.
No, he couldn’t think like that. Moriarty was cruel. Terribly, terribly, cruel, but he wasn’t that kind of cruel. John was the one thing that Moriarty would likely ever have as real leverage against Sherlock, and if he intended to kill John, he would make it as painful for Sherlock as possible. And while Sherlock was hurting a whole hell of a lot right now, it would be naïve to think that he couldn’t hurt more.
Moran poked Johns side with his knife just below the ribs. The wound might nick the spleen, but otherwise was likely to clear any more essential organ.
“Vic, quiet. I know where he is, I was able to track them on CCTV feeds after I received the video,” a woman’s voice Sherlock didn’t recognize explained.
“Bloody terrifying,” Mary repeated. “And everyone always made Sherlock out to be the psychopath of the pair of you. He wouldn’t hurt a fly though, would he? But you John, I’d hate to be a fly that buzzed itself a little too close to Sherlock Holmes,” Mary teased.
No matter what it was, Sherlock couldn’t seem to make any sort of conclusive deduction from Victor’s appearance. He could hardly even make a good guess. And even still, none of those possibilities had any discernibly meaningful implications.
Sherlock was only half listening to John, having jumped from the sofa at the mention of his mobile. He ran to the desk where it rested to charge and saw half a dozen messages from Mycroft. He then heard the sound of a door slamming in the street below and looked down from the window to see Lestrade walk up to the front door of the building, tossing something to the ground as a went.
Somewhere along the way John’s horror had morphed into confusion. He had closed the distance between himself and Sherlock and snatched the phone back, reading the text that Sherlock had read. The horror crossed his face again, but his brow remained furrowed.
But John though had found nothing in any of the papers. Every crime reported in all the newspapers, even the ones that weren’t local, seemed to have been solved already. And he and John had already both came twice that day and had gone out to pick up biscuits and orange juice, despite the fact that they didn’t really need them. So Sherlock was unfathomably bored.
Despite having confirmation of the existence of a vigilante that had been disassembling all of London’s criminal networks, and a name to match, Sherlock found it impossible to get any closer to assembling a full picture of what was going on. An entire team had been assembled down at the Yard as well on the mysterious man, but they had even less luck than Sherlock.
Crowds of people rushed around him, in and out of the station. None of them had any idea what had been happening. They didn’t know that Moriarty threatened their lives. They certainly didn’t know that he had already destroyed Sherlock’s.
“Um, here’s a card, that’s my mobile on it. Text me,” he said, pulling the business card out of his pocket and dropping it on the table in front of Victor before flying out the door.
John fell back onto the floor, his back arched off the ground and he groaned as the flames of agony flared over his back. The acid. Fuck.
Had it really been almost six months at this point since the last time he and Sherlock had ran through the streets together? Since the first time John had met Moriarty? Since the first time he and Sherlock had kissed?
“Vic, our only objective was to keep them alive through this. That’s all it’s ever been. That’s the only game plan. Everything else that’s happened is just coincidence. I had no idea I’d spent a year parading around the globe like we did,”
Now he was in a relationship with John Watson, more or less anyway, and it was wonderful. John seemed hesitant to define their relationship, and definitely was not ready to tell other people, but he had stopped gallivanting around the city with any woman who looked at him twice and was spending the night in Sherlock’s bed, so Sherlock assumed it counted as a relationship. And whatever it was, it was good enough for him, because he still had John, which was all that mattered.
“Just moved recently,” Sherlock couldn’t help but feel the corner of his lip twitch in satisfaction. He’d gotten something right.  “I’m kind of in between places, actually, looking for a flat of my own or at least a not completely weird flat mate. I don’t know how long I’ll be in London though, anyway. But, you know, London real estate is tough and hardly affordable. I’m currently renting a room from an older couple in Crouch End. I’ve been helping them out around the house as well as part of an unofficial part of my let agreement to keep the rent down. It’s not exactly close to work, but it is allowing me to even save up a bit,” Trevor supplied in that casual way that was driving Sherlock mad. “Where have you got yourself set up?”
He couldn’t take it anymore, his mind was overloaded, constantly. He’d voiced his frustrations to his brother, not intentionally mind you, only in a fit of frustration after a great deal of probing on Mycroft’s part. He’d been told that it sounded like what Sherlock was experiencing were panic attacks. He knew about panic attacks. He’d seen John have far too many. But the thing about panic attacks was that they were supposed to end. Fifteen minutes of feeling like the world is collapsing in on you and you’re dying, and then you catch your breath and start to move on.
Sherlock fought in vain still, bringing a foot up to push against the railing, causing both him and the person holding him back to fall backwards on to the ground. He rolled off of the assailant and tried to fling himself towards the railing, but was tackled to the ground. His arms were pinned on either side of his head as the other man knelt above him.
“You thought I sent that little gift I took of you to Sherlock?” he asked. “Oh Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. Has that what you’ve been thinking this whole time, my darling? No wonder you seem so stressed, worried about me hurting your precious little Sherly. No, Johnny. I told you that I’m done with him, didn’t I? And I’d never lie to you. Never ever ever. How can we work together if you can’t trust me?”
John quickly moved to point his weapon at Mary, fighting every distress signal his body was sending to steadily aim the gun at Mary’s head, Mary pointed her weapon right back at him. Moran could easily take her out, he could have any time, but Moriarty had told John to kill them. Moran was only still there as insurance, in case John betrayed him.
“Victor!” he heard a familiar voice that he hadn’t heard in so so long shout. He froze. Instictually he began to scan his surrounding when suddenly someone grabbed his arm. John reached for his gun from his shoulder holster and found himself pointing it in the face of one Victor Trevor as the other man held him against a wall.
Moriarty had taken everything from him. Everything. But he could not make a mockery of the time that he and Sherlock had spent together, however brief it was. Moriarty had no right to know about anything he and Sherlock had or hadn’t done sexually. He hoped to God that this was just a good guess on Moriarty’s part, because if he’d planted anything in their bedroom, John would survive just so that he could strangle Moriarty. Or maybe castrate him.
“That boy is really an enigma, isn’t he? Quite the lady killer!” Mrs. Hudson laughed before heading back down the stairs to her flat.
But the door swung open and the flat was dark. Light from the street outside streamed in through the window, however, and the golden light nestled on John’s empty chair.
