Cas blinked. “Me too,” he said a second later. “I've been in love with you since you moved in here, since you parked that Impala of yours outside and took one look at my oven and condemned it with a and I quote here, 'What kind of piece shit oven is this?'”
Cas sighs softly and stops him outside the bathroom. “Good things happen, Dean. And sometimes, they keep on happening. Without intermittent pain and suffering.”
Dean shakes his head and flashes his eyes open. “Nope. Not at all.” He leans in and kisses Cas again, slower this time. One kiss, then two, then three. His lips stay against Cas' lips as he closes his eyes. “You taste good.”
Dean straddles him and grabs a pillow. “Yield or die,” Dean screams as he raises his pillow up high.
Maybe the gay angel – Castiel – wasn't that bad. No, he was way better than monster and scum. John decided that he liked the angel.
Not too gentle, Dean hopes, and it's as if Castiel reads his mind because the next blow is harder. It's painful but the good kind of pain that makes his blood run hotter, and makes his heart beat faster. The kind of pain that is exhilarating.
Cas scoffs. “I wasn't aware that it was a competition. And you didn't beat me. It was a calculated strategy and it turned out as intended.”
Castiel grinds against him. “You will.” He spears his fingers through Dean's hair and practically growls in Dean's ear. “Come for me.”
Cas opens his eyes and when that piercing gaze finds Dean, his heart stops for a moment. There is such an honest, open tenderness in Cas' face. Suddenly, Dean feels like an intruder. Emotions like these can't be for him, can't be aimed
There's no point in trying to fall asleep now. He's all on edge, sweaty as fuck, and he can kiss the notion of sleep goodbye. With a curse, Dean wiggles out of the sleeping bag and exits the tent.
"It's fan fiction of Chuck's books. Fans write all kinds of stories about the show, about us. They make us...do things. They draw us..doing things. Satisfied?"
With a loud bang on the counter, Sam declared that he was done with his task. “You're contaminating the workspace.”
“I bet, they're hard as rocks.” Dean glances over at Cas' cock. “I know something else that's hard.”
“I wish you could feel that, Dean, how you clamp down around me. So fucking perfect.” Castiel let go for a second and Dean gulped in air. Right now he'd take his ass burning over his lungs screaming for air. He
Cas grabs his arm. “You are. I don't need to wait for a dire moment to tell you how much I love you.” He tilts his head slightly and sighs. “Not anymore. It's just there, what I feel for you. A river – its dam finally bursting and it feels freeing to just let the waters flow with no restriction. You are perfect in my eyes and you deserve to hear it.”
Cas came back with a broom in hand and started sweeping up the glass. He always cleaned up Dean's messes. “Cas!”
“I'm happy, fuck, you have no idea Cas.” He grabs Cas' hand just to reassure him. “But it's me. I... I can't, these fucking thoughts keep showing up in my head, alright? Not all the time but like, I can just look at you when you're laughing at a stupid joke I made and go 'for how long will he think I'm funny?' Or when you told me all those things about me...” Dean clears his throat. “About how great I am, or that you think I do the best steaks in the world – ”
Cas grips Dean's cock and Dean exhales harshly as Cas rubs a thumb over his head. It comes away wet with precome.
Carefully, Dean climbed back in bed and rolled the small plastic piece over Cas' hard cock. Grinned he admired his work. Beautiful!
“Not a chance,” Ion says and caresses Dean's arm. He speaks to Cas next. “I thought we'd fuck the brattiness out of him by now.”
“As you wish, Dean.” Cas sank down softly on the pillow, back straight and proud. Dean could see his strong back muscles twitch as he moved into a comfortable position, the globes of his ass just begging to be squeezed. Dean shimmied out of his own pants and removed his underwear and socks. He glanced down at his dark brown flannel shirt but decided against taking it off. Bending down he grabbed the belt and walked over to Cas on silent feet.
The other Dean twirls the beak one last time before aiming it straight at Dean's chest. “Too much heart has always been your problem.” He leans in slowly.
Nodding, Dean takes a scone and spreads some jam on it. “I like how you're thinking.” Taking a bite, Dean moans. “Mm, this tastes amazing, Cas. You're spoiling me.”
Again, Castiel is there, pressing a lube soaked finger against Dean's taint and this time, there's intent and purpose.
The tentacle in his ass starts pulsating, Dean can't describe it any other way. He looks down and sees a tiny bulge in his stomach. “Holy fuck.” More tentacles appear, caressing his chest and legs and Dean writhes on the bed, trying to escape and bear down at the same time.
Dean grins. It's still hard to wrap his mind around the fact that he and Cas are a thing. That they are together. That Cas
Dean attaches the ramp to the nesting box and nods. “Look at that. Can't believe chickens have a more spaced-out place than we do. Is the ventilation done?”
Castiel presses his finger on Dean's taint again, only to circle it teasingly with the pad of his thumb. He moves slowly, circling Dean's taint without actually pushing inside and Dean feels like he's breaking apart with lust. He unflexes his toes, and exhales, tries to relax but it's impossible.
One hour north as they pass Hildreth, Dean slows down. The sun covers the fields in light, and the road is more dust than tarmac. Turning from the main road, Dean drives onto a narrow pathway and fields slowly turn into bushes, the thickets of trees turn into a proper forest.
They broke off, breathless like a couple of damn teenagers. Cas' cheeks were colored red, and Dean couldn't help but laugh. “It suits you, being breathless like this. You're fucking beautiful, Cas.”
Dean didn't know when it had happened. He just knew that one day the fluttery excitement of seeing Cas hadn't been just for Cas being his friend. It had been
“Yes, just like that. Let pain purify you,” Castiel breaths heavily. “God, your ass is amazing.” He picks up the pace and each thrust moves Dean slightly forward.
Cas sweeps past him and secures the entrance. He always does that, moves like a soldier securing shit, even when they are grocery shopping. It's not like the avocados are gonna attack him. Although, he does sometimes feel personally attacked when Sam tries to offer him his avocado smoothies. It's the Devil's juice.
obvious when looking at Cas, has he? Does Cas know that Dean likes him? “Both are nice. I mean, I'm not the kind of guy that goes only for coffee or tea, it depends on the situation you know. Sometimes you're in the mood for coffee and sometimes you're in the mood for tea. It's all about what I'm thirsting for at the moment, not what kind of liquid it is. I don't … I drink both.”
A while later they were all done with breakfast and cuddling up close. “You wanna watch another episode?”
Squeezing on his palm, the blood drips into the bowl. Dean places the crystal in there, says the right words, thinks the right thoughts.
Then Cas starts moving again, and Dean groans. It feels like his skin is instantly covered in sweat and Cas' cock, his cock reaches new places Dean's never felt before. He's panting like a damn dog but he can't breathe properly and the pleasure is too much and he looks down and sees the outline of Cas' cock against his stomach. “Oh my God, fucking hell, shit Cas.”
Ion is suddenly there, wrapping his mouth around Dean's swollen head. He sucks and licks at Dean's cock like he can't get enough.
The board is full of bullshit. Dean glares at the pieces and takes another swig of his beer. “You're cheating, Cas. No way was that queen anywhere near my king.”
He looks ahead and spreads his fingers but the edge is too far away. To his sides, there is more stone. The altar is smooth and Dean finds it impossible to grab hold of anything. “I can't grab a hold of anything. Father.”
Walking over to the bar he was to grab another beer when he noticed that the crowd had cheered up significantly. It was not like the party had been dead before; it was a few hours before midnight and from what Dean could piece together from talking with other guests, this event had started at lunchtime. But there was a charge in the air, people drinking more, dancing harder and seeming more alive then he could remember, almost like they were in thrall.
Squeezing his cock just so makes Dean gasp and close his eyes as he rests his head against the wall, overcome with intense need, with lust.
When Dean opened the oven, the world erupted in fire. He backed away, startled. There was a hissing sound in the background and suddenly smoke rose. Dean turned towards Castiel and as he took a breath, he tasted smoke.
He could still feel Cas' hand around his throat but now the strokes had changed, from soft whispering play to hard, unyielding force. He was drowning in the sensation and each word he tried to take in objection only caused him to expel more precious air until all he could do was close his eyes and wait for darkness.
Just as Dean is about to answer her, she walks past him and hands his coffee to someone in the booth in front of him. Dean waits until she's gone and then walks up to the man.
The chill wind is forgotten as warmth courses through Dean's body. His heart thunders in his chest and then Cas does that thing with his tongue that is pure sin. “Fuck, I'ma come soon, Cas.”
“You will be surprised by many things, Dean. Please, remove your shirt.” Cas backed away, walking over to the bed. He sat down and started to take off his own shirt, slowly and meticulously, all the while his eyes were trained on Dean's. He arched an eyebrow and shook his head slightly, disappointed that Dean refused to obey his request despite him being so gracious as to say please.
Cas mumbles into the pillow and turns to face him. “What?” He squints with one eye and adds sullenly. “It's still too early to be up.”
“I don't have much experience with this,” Cas began as he snaked an arm around Dean, “but I do think I favor being the big spoon.”
“I've been writing in Enochian for eons, carving it into wood is hardly difficult. Try carving it into stone.” Cas walks over and looks at Dean's demon sigil. “It's alright.”
“I did.” There's a beat of silence. “Jokes aside, Dean, it was really nice of you. Doing something new for me, for all of us, creating a tradition. It was nice being a part of that. That got me thinking...”
Cas' eyes flit down for a moment and he nods solemnly before looking at Dean again, his gaze serious. “I know. And I'm not going anywhere.” He dares a smile. “Things are different now.”
But he remembers faintly that there is another purpose to this. He is to be cleansed. A second thought comes to him, muddying the first; the cleansing was for a purpose.
Dean suppressed a smile, pretended to be asleep and focused on the feeling of Doretha against his head.
“Thought humans couldn’t hear your true voice,” Dean finally murmurs. He’s under no illusion that his words alert Cas to his presence. Cas is more aware of his surroundings than Dean is, and considering Dean’s upbring, that’s saying something.
“It didn’t hurt. I mean, it was sort of an emotional roller-coaster, but my ears are intact,” Dean shrugs. There was a time he might have been worried about
Once, Castiel was the Angel of Thursday, a Warrior of the Heavenly Host. Now, he is a father to a boy with all the powers of the divine surging through his tiny body.
Cas isn’t in bed beside him like he was when Dean fell asleep, but that’s pretty normal. Dean’s well aware that Cas often excuses himself when Dean drifts off, because, well. It’s gotta be pretty boring lying awake for eight hours not doing jack shit.
“Yeah? Pretty sure I’m the guy you love most in the whole damn world,” Dean countered, cheeky, incredulous that he could
Dean knows there are parts of Cas that he might never access, and it tears him up sometimes. So getting this little piece of him…
“Is that all you’re here for? ‘Cos I gotta be honest, I’m running low on shut-eye as it is,” Dean’s words were dismissive, but he was staring at her quizzically as if trying to figure her out. She wondered if he might let her in on whatever he found; she had struggled to place herself too as of late.
Nothing at all. There was…nothing. Just nothing. On and on and on, nothing and nothing, stretching not just to the horizon, but above and below them as well.
“Look, Cas,” he took a deep breath, “me and Quin got in here, but it’s like purgatory, right? It’ll be pretty damn hard to get you out, cos you ain’t human. Even more so, ‘cos you belong here.”
like him – more than his own voice does. It takes Dean an embarrassing amount of time to put two and two together and realise why.
it’s him. There are few other people who can move him to tears so easily, after all, even with the aid of supernatural singing abilities.
His mouth isn’t open; he’s not even indulging in the gentle humming habit he has when he makes eggs in the morning, picked up some time since he got back from the Empty. Instead, he’s just sat, bright blue eyes staring with such adoration down at Jack.
Dean used the hand that wasn’t cradling Doretha to cover Castiel’s mouth, effectively putting a stop to whatever he was going to say. It might have been a slight mistake, considering Dean’s brain short-circuited when he felt Cas’s breath against his palm, but he couldn’t think of a better way to shut him up.
Some part of them had known – had known that they felt the same way too, since Cas was killed by Lucifer – and they’d done nothing about it. They hadn’t even done something when Cas had been confessing in front of them.
It buried its way into her chest when it should not be there and was tearing her to shreds. It was why she was here in the first place.
“Did you know?” he asks Quin, after what could have been hours just standing there. Time feels weird, like it’s slowed down and sped up all at once.
On the floor, Abigail raised her head slightly, in curiosity, mirroring the way Sam swayed slightly forward, pretending to not be as interested as he likely was. Wendy landed on the table, shifting into a cat as she did, Jack’s fingers immediately finding purchase in her fur. Everyone was staring at Cas, except Quin who seemed content to continue to doze. Maybe she already knew the answer. Maybe that was one of the many things she and Cas used to talk about under the cover of darkness all those years ago.
“We are not like your own counterparts. I am not bound to Castiel by time or space. I am merely a weapon he can call upon.” She knew this to be true and yet…it almost felt like she was echoing lines she had heard but did not believe. There it was again; that uncomfortable feeling, that
Dean can’t move. He’s not even sure he’s breathing anymore. He’s seen angels die before – the way the wings are painted black against whatever surface they fall against – but he’s never seen
Dean was going to have to get used to that because it was a damn headrush, feeling Cas’s soul in his hands. And she was so
He caught the glimpse of it again, blue and flame and fire and eyes, so many eyes, jeez, no wonder Cas had a thing for staring---
Castiel shakes his head, lifts his cup to his lips to take a sip, “not quite. I was…singing, to him. The first songs ever uttered, the prayers for a peaceful world and protected souls.”
He pulled it away, biting at his lower lip. He felt like he was blushing. Was he blushing? That was ridiculous, he hadn’t blushed since he was a teenager and he’d put on those pink panties with the lace and—
Dean still wasn’t sure he believed all the things that Cas had said to him before he got sucked into the empty, but he was going to try his hardest to live up to them anyway. It was what Cas deserved. What this little robin in his hand deserved too.
“I’m gonna walk this damn place for all eternity before I give up,” he said, out loud, mostly because then at least he’d be able to hear his own voice. It was still disconcertingly loud, but he took comfort in it this time.
Castiel actually looks up then, bright blue eyes startled. “You—you can hear me?” there’s something like guilt flooding his features, and the noise dims and quiets. If Dean thought he was close to tears hearing it, this is worse. He has to try desperately hard not to openly weep from the loss of it.  “I’m sorry, Dean, I know my voice is unpleasant for human ears. I had no idea I was projecting it so.”
“Didn’t have to figure it out babe, you told me,” he says, over laughs, “and then a big cosmic entity came in to validate it for us. So. You know,” Dean leans forward, lets his lips press to Cas’s cheek, “you can’t take it back now.”
Dean had a sudden, awful feeling that Cas’s confession wasn’t what he’d thought it was, that he was misremembering somehow…
It was one of those moments that made Dean feel like he was floating. They were sat around in the library of the bunker. Sam and Dean both had a drink on the go, their daemons curled up together on the floor like they used to back when they were kids who could only find comfort in each other. Meanwhile, Jack’s daemon – currently a hummingbird - was flittering in between his fingers, playful, her feathers iridescent in the low lighting.
He pushed through. He started singing other shit; ACDC’s top hits, Black Sabbath, Paramore, Taylor fucking swift. Cas liked Taylor Swift, he always bobbed his head along to her songs whenever they came on in the car.
He eases his gun out from under his pillow (some habits never die) and heads out the door to check out what’s happening.
Yet as she disappeared from the motel room, the feel of Sara’s snout in her feathers followed her like a ghost.
“I know you are conflicted about what heaven has asked of you and your brother recently,” Hagar spoke, and though she was looking at Dean, she was speaking to both of them. The words poured out, unbidden, to this stranger, this human, this small inconsequential soul who she could not deny her pull towards. “You have followed orders before, but that was from your father, and upon the death of your brother, you began to wonder if even those orders were meaningful.” These were the facts she knew about Dean Winchester’s life. She knew them as if she had been there. She knew them intimately, because she knew
He’d been expecting to run into Cas; trench coat, dark hair, same Cas from when he’d been pulled from Dean in the bunker.
“Okay, it’s okay, I’m here.” Dean murmured, “don’t panic. We’re gonna get you out, alright?” he began emptying his pockets onto a floor that wasn’t there.
Eventually, after a moment, the fight leaves Quin’s eyes. It’s almost worse than the anger. Her eyes look glassy. Empty. Dead. But she’s relented, stepping back so Dean ignores the pain and goes about picking Cas up.
Dean furrows his brows for a moment before realising what Cas is saying. Cas thinks his voice is hurting him like it did when Dean pulled himself from the damn grave.
Castiel would visit them in dingy motel after dingy motel, and Quin would curl up close enough to touch (but never touching, never) on the edge of the bed next to Cas.
It takes a monumental amount of effort to raise his head from where he’s curled over the warm heartbeat against his fingertips. His eyes hurt from the bright light that was Castiel’s angelic form. He’s half worried that they’re burnt out, and
he realised that there was going to have to be some kind of speech involved before they could reach the Happy Ever After bit? Dean was an idiot. No, worse than an idiot. He was stupid, stupid, stupid—
“Are they real flames?” Sara broke Hagar’s downward spiral. Hagar glanced at her, wondering when she had gotten so close. The wetness of her nose was barely a few inches from Hagar’s feathers.
It was approximately three AM on some ideal Wednesday morning that Hagar – The Right Hand of the Divine Angel of the Lord Castiel, his weapon, his Daemon – first met Dean Winchester.
Yeah, they could do a hell of a lot better when it came to being happy. They would. Dean was sure of it.
Cas comes back, and Dean’s never been happier than he is at that moment. He sees Cas and he can feel Quin perk up behind him. Dean’s half certain she’s going to run to Cas and bury her face in his trench coat despite Sam’s eyes and all the rest of it.
Hagar was almost confused. No. Why would they ever decide that? Dean Winchester was the righteous man, and they had raised him from hell, carved him from dust, made him perfect once more.
noise, but it gets…clearer, as Dean clears the corridor, peeking into various rooms. He’s already making a b-line towards Jacks, but he stops to peek his head into Sam and Eileen’s and all he finds is his brother snoring (Sam’s lucky Eileen can’t hear that, or she’d probably kick him out).
A voice whispered in Dean’s head. Maybe it was better that Ezekiel made them kick Cas out. Because despite his dirty clothes and the fact that Cas needed to breathe now…he’d get his grace back eventually. He wasn’t human. He didn’t have a daemon.
There was a lot to do before. There was greeting Sam and Abigail and Eileen and her daemon Roger. There was seeing Jack again, and Wendy’s excitement as she flew in the air above their heads with Doretha. There was a big family meal, and plenty of hugs, and drinks.
(Well, maybe he could think of a better way to shut him up. But words first, then they could move on to gratuitous amounts of sex, if Cas wanted that.)
looking forward to the kid when he became a proper teenager. He’s pretty sure grounding someone doesn’t work when they can pop across the world in the blink of an eye whenever they fancy.
He hugs Cas first because he knows that way he’ll have the pressure of Sam wanting to say hello behind him, which means he’ll have to let go. He’s pretty sure if he goes second, he’ll hold on so long they’ll have to pry him off with a damn crowbar.
It takes Castiel a moment. Dean can see his mind trying to reject the very concept. And he can see the moment that it settles, the moment Castiel’s face breaks out into a tentative grin that Dean wants to kiss almost immediately. He stills himself though. He has the rest of his life to kiss Cas (and he plans to be doing it for the whole damn time too). “You’re certain it didn’t hurt?” Castiel murmurs, fingers finding a too long strand of hair to move off Dean’s forehead. Dean should get it cut, sometime soon.
He sang through the rest of the mixtape with the sort of determination that one only built up after fighting to stop the end of the world dozens of times.
But where Dean stands still and silent, Quin is the opposite. The howl of pain she let out still rings around them. She’d not hesitated before barrelling close to Cas, pressing her fur up against his body, nudging her snout against his cheek as if she might find a way to wake him.
By the time he reaches Jack’s room, he really is holding back tears. Whatever the fuck it is, it’s stirring something big within him. Dean really hopes he’s not gonna have to fight it, because somehow, despite him not giving a damn in general about faith and belief and, you know, the fact that he’d
He reaches out a hand again, she goes to bite it. He feels her draw blood, the hiss from both of them as they feel the pain in it.
Quin lifted herself up, finally. Dean could feel the effort it cost her, her muscles weighed down by exhaustion and sadness. She looks up at him, bright eyes shining. “Then we better get to work,” she says, “because if Cas can annoy a cosmic entity so much it lets him go, we can do the same. We’re practically made for it.”
you, in every way that counts. I bonded with her more quickly because I held your soul in my hands when I pulled you from hell. She recognised me easier than you did.”
And the fourth is that – if Quin and Abigail are on the other side of the room – then that’s not who he’s holding.
Hagar ruffled the flames of her feathers, drew herself to her full height, “I am Hagar. I am Castiel’s right hand.” The showmanship of her introduction was somewhat dampened by the fact that she couldn’t stop squinting at the daemon who had recognised her without a thought.
Castiel clicked his tongue. “You can barely see the target and I miscalculated the wind the first two times.” He stuck a finger in the air. “This time, I'll hit the mark.”
Next, he grabs his power drill. In the YouTube tutorial he watched – and he sure ain't gonna tell Sam about that – the lady had used a knife but why carve when you can drill? He turns the setting on low and presses the drill against the core of the cabbage. Not much happens so Dean turns the setting on max and then pushes. Slowly the drill chews through the core of the cabbage until it pokes out on the other side.
Suddenly, Cas removes his hand and just as Dean's eyes flash open to ask him what he's doing he hears Sam's mortified voice
“Any special coffee or tea in your life right now?” Castiel licks his lips and takes another mouthful of coffee.
Castiel's cassock looks pristine; flawless like the man himself. Dean's gaze flits to the floor. He waits.
Dean shrugs. “Why not. You're hot, and you're sitting here alone, rocking with your lone cowboy vibe.”
Cas shakes his head. “I can't believe this either. All the things I've done for you, how could you not
The way Castiel leans over him, sheltering him with his body and keeping him safe, but also confining him in how his fingers dig into his shoulders, claiming him.
Cas takes Dean's hand and pulls him to the center of the floor. There's soft music playing and as Cas wraps his arm around Dean's waist, he hears Mary's excited shout.
Dean finishes the last stroke on the wall and nods. “Kitchen is done. I have to say, it looks nice for being nearly-white. The stove will fit in like a glove. I'm so ready to have steak for lunch.”
Dean closes his eyes and is about to kiss Cas when he hears a soft sound as something falls to the floor. He opens his eyes just in time to see Cas kick something away.
, I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack. But I cared about the whole world because of you. You changed me, Dean.”
“Breakfast in bed... then we can watch something, maybe take a nap. And if we're lucky it's lunchtime by then and we can order some take-out.”
Maybe he's a bit too eager because Witch Dean chokes but he doesn't seem to mind and Dean's glad he doesn't. The way his throat constricts around Dean's cock, it feels fucking amazing. There's a warm flush on Dean's cheeks, and his heart is trying to break through his ribcage and Witch Dean's hands grab the side of his hips. He holds them there which gives Dean better leverage.
“For a while, when I was a kid, I used to wish I was a bird. Loved the idea of having wings. That or taking Baby for a spin.” Dean pauses, thinking maybe he shouldn't be talking about birds and wings. Not when Cas losing – giving up – his wings happened so recently.
Cas pauses briefly. “You should really focus on the screen, Dean. We don't want you to act suspicious.”
Dean grabs Cas' hand. “Let's go shower. Eileen will be over soon. And we need to hide all the pots and utensils from Sam.”
Castiel's hand pushes at his shoulder. “It pleases me that you're so comfortable kneeling Dean, but do I need to remind you of what I said?”
Witch Dean hollows his cheeks and Dean sighs out in pleasure. “Fuck, you're good at this.” He's already warm and flush, and his cock is aching for release. He already feels like he's on the cusp of coming and isn't that embarrassing.
From behind him, Jack and Eileen enter the kitchen. Jack gives him a smile. “You're looking good, Dean.”
Cas wraps his fingers around Dean's leaking cock, and Dean throws his head back. “I think I won't survive this.”
Cas starts chopping up a salad. “I've not been a human for long and I will admit the repertoire of food I know how to cook is slim, but I don't think you're a Michelin chef, Dean.”
Sam sighs. “I'm not asking you to marry the guy, but clearly you're interested in this Castiel person. Why else would you hang at the library every day?”
He didn’t think his face could get any redder. “I think he kinda knows? But I guess I want to make it official.”
There's no escaping this room and while Billie's hold on his heart has vanished for now and the sigil holds, he can hear her hammering down at the door.
Dean swallowed but kept silent. That knowledge hurt now, and he knew deep down that he wasn't responsible for this creep drugging and kidnapping him but he couldn't help but listen to that tiny damn voice in the back of his mind that told me that this was his fault. That he'd been too trusting, too open, that he should've kept his walls up.
Dean nods. “Yeah, go check the other kid.” Dean opens his bag again and grabs a rope. It's thin and it'll burn quickly but not quick enough so the changeling can escape.
Cas' voice is hoarse from all the shouting. “You love me?” He sounds confused and awed at the same time.
The banging gets louder and blends with the shrill tones of a whistle. It's enough to make Dean want to throw something. Just when he's ready to go and ask Sam what the hell is going on the sounds stop.
“That's it, good boy.” Castiel shoves his finger inside, pumping a couple of times before he pushes in another one. It burns a bit and Dean moans.
As everyone dug into the cake, Dean felt a sense of peace come over him. He had his family, he had Cas. The world was as alright as it could be, and as for the monsters and vamps – with no Chuck stirring the Apocalyptic pot – they'd be taken care of. If not by Dean, then by others hunters.
It was a thin band, and on it were tiny engraved feathers. And just like that, Dean knew he’d found his gift.
“Yeah, right, now close them!” When Cas finally obeyed, Dean padded over to the bed on silent feet. This was going to be awesome. Carefully he opened the package.
In the distance, they could see the lights from the city like tiny dotted stars but soon the silence was disturbed by the occasional bang. Where one came, many followed.
“Kwshuu!” Dean angled himself slightly again, tapping Cas' cock from another angle, all the while a terribly pleased smile playing on his lips.
Firstly, he wanted to spruce up the decorations a little. Give them a little more pizzazz. And a tad more glitter.
“Perfect.” Dean pauses and looks over his shoulder before paying attention to Ion again. “Have you ever been with
Ever since Castiel and Sam brought Michael back to the bunker Cas had been restless. It felt wrong to have him there, like he could, by his very presence unearth all the secrets of the Men of Letters and glean the hidden knowledge from lore books. It felt like Castiel's own secrets were brought to the surface by a mere look from Dean. The thought was a bitter knife to his heart. It wasn't Dean trying to get a rise out of him. He wore the face of Dean, but it was an impassive one, his face smooth and his green eyes holding nothing but contempt for the angel.
“Congratulations,” she says as she rises, Billie’s body submerging into oily goo at her feet. “You’ve cheated Death once more,” she tells the both of them, then disappears.
Jensen swallows. He feels a little bad — he’s stealing this moment from Dean, in a way, his first reunion with Cas after that heartfelt love confession.
“I didn’t do it for him,” he finally says, and Dean looks at him a few seconds too long, then smiles.
Dean quickly steps out of the bed. Yeah, no one should think anything of it, but, um, he’s pretty sure he packed lube.
Sam’s probably being a lil piss baby because there was no room for him on the couch. Well, suck it up, Sammy.
He soon figures out how to filter for content. That way he can get rid of the, umm, threesomes with Sam some of those horny bastards like to write about. He ain’t gotta see that, he’s been to
The door crashes open. It’s Billie, it’s Death, she’s finally managed to break through the warding, and is looking at them with absolute lust for revenge in her eyes.
Dean winces. If he’s being honest — yeah, Cas did look a little hurt, but somehow Dean doesn’t think it’s relevant to the case.
Dean stares at the curve of Cas’s back for a moment, then sighs, and flicks off his own bedside lamp. He’s nowhere near tired. Why couldn’t he just have had a normal conversation? Maybe asked Cas to watch a movie or something?
He glances at Barb. Is that how the women in this class see Cas? Dean looks at Barbara and the other, elderly lady who’s enthusiastically sketching with her tongue firmly stuck between her lips.
He admits it begrudgingly. In a way, it’s… compelling, okay? This Cas is really complimentary to Dean, actually. Saying everything he ever did was for love, and all that bull.
He smoothes out his hair. He’s a devout man. A dad. His name is Jimmy. He likes falling asleep in front of the tv. He has never had a gay thought in his life.
Cas sucks the tip of Dean’s finger and Dean lets out a strangled noise, from deep within his throat.
An actual angel of the Lord has appeared out of thin air and Jensen has about thirty different crises of faith. This is definitely
It’s just what pops into his mind, because why not, it’s such a popular tag, right? He’s been beat to death with it. He even clicked on it once just to see how many fics contained frottage. And then sorted them by kudos.
“Eight. And it’s very stressful to organize events of this scale, you know.” He stepped a little closer to them, menacingly. There would be no escape from this roadhouse.
Dean lets a detached mask slide over his face, the way he did when he had a squirming Alastair on the rack. He pretends Cas is see-through.
He waits until Dean looks up from the bed. With expectant eyes, Dean silently waits, that familiar emotionless mask almost back in place.
“For taking that deal with the Empty. For… for springing that on me like that. Then just leaving me alone with it all.”
It’s just that he doesn’t feel like doing any other research, like helping Kevin and Sam with the elomite deciphering of those doodles from the tablet. Sounds like a lot of work. That’s why when Cas calls him about a potential case with the four mysterious murders in Idaho, he decides to drive up. Just to check it out. To avoid, you know. Reading stuff that - he, uh, he doesn’t like reading. And not at all because he keeps thinking about that stuff and… uh, Cas. Who shouldn’t have hung up on him like that, dammit.
“Your turn now, Dean,” Sam says. Dean hasn’t even paid attention to who’s been drinking. And how does Jack know about hickeys anyway? Has he been leaving his computer unlocked again?
Dean assesses how he feels. No, actually, he decides, surprising himself. He does not. He wants to continue doing this, being this.
A small noise escapes Cas’ throat. What - what does this noise mean? Dean is unsure, of everything, except the fact he is clinging to it with all his might and wants more. More of this.
The director steps near. It’s a scrawny looking guy, maybe in his early fifties. Dean could take him in his sleep.
A knot loosens slightly inside Dean’s chest as he guides Baby into Idaho Falls to the familiar tune of
When Dean looks back at the stage, he catches Cas staring at the two of them. His gaze is unreadable. Somehow, Dean feels more exposed than the literal naked guy in the room.
Cas blinked at Jack. “Oh no. I haven’t even been able to get confetti cannons yet. I have to get the appetizers in the oven!”
He thumbs through the results. There’s all sorts of weirdness. Oh, one where Cas makes him a hot chocolate? Sounds sweet - damn, wait, what?
Cas sighs heavily against his hand. Both of their hearts quicken in tandem, because something is happening.
Dean bites his bottom lip.  When he looks up, the tip of Cas’ tongue peeks out. His eyes are half lidded now, almost staring through Dean, down to Dean’s very soul that Cas knows so intimately.
The pastor smiles. “Yes, you are. The next one will be twenty minutes, so don’t choose anything too straining on your body, son.”
It’s clear. Dean must turn down Cas to save his life. And he must be as cruel as possible about it. Not a
He shouldn’t ask any weird questions that indicate he’s read any kind of fic. Just be normal. Just be normal.
He’s gotten a little taste of that feeling again, the one he always forgets, that particular feeling when Cas dies.
“Cas,” Dean whispers against his chest, but Cas doesn’t reply - he just wraps himself tighter around Dean.
“I’d say 90 percent is dest-,” Kevin says, quickly correcting himself: “Erhm - I mean, you and Castiel.”
it, Castiel. Every single soul I hurt, every drop of blood I spilled on my knife, every… every piece of skin I peeled. It was a drug and I wanted more, every day. Man, I regret not giving in sooner than those 30 years.”
Dean’s fingers slid along the beer bottle’s neck as he looked down. “You’re right, man. I, uh. It’s my turn to talk.”
Cas narrows his eyes. “I have an… apartment,” he says, rather weakly. “That I sleep in. Every night.”
Up comes a friggin’ lyrics question. What’s this, a highschool reading comprehension test? Dean doesn’t have the mental energy to read all of… whatever that is.
Then, he gets distracted, because suddenly Cas moves his head a bit, rubbing his cheek against Dean’s leg. Dean's only wearing very thin pajama pants, so it’s really a… fest of warmth down there.
“Cas, Cas,” he says, and Cas immediately releases Dean’s dick from his mouth’s grasp, brows jumping together with concern.
“It’s just…” Kevin swallows. Dean thanks the gods, the angels, the devil even, whatever, the whole damn universe that Sam’s asleep already. “It’s just that, I was wondering about the things those fans pick up from the Carver Edlund books.”
Sam frowns. Since when is Dean so delicate about a little blood? He’s seen Dean take a lot of hits in his life - some Sam administered himself, regrettably - and he always took it with teeth clenched and head held high.
Dean doesn’t look at the angel, not even one second, only at their hands. Then, heavily: “Thank you, Cas.”
Eventually they find a spell to send a human to the Empty. The ingredients aren’t hard to get by. But to Dean, the price is high.
All the same for Dean, really. They’re a grown man and an angel after all, they can manage a little bro on bro action and then have their alone time.
By the time the alarm goes off, he’s gotta hand it to Cas: you gotta have balls to do this nude modeling thing.
Dean abruptly turns off the Zeppelin. He removes the tape from the deck and stores it carefully away from sunlight.
Poor Cas. He looks like he’d rather use his shiny chest to slide off the bed right into a hole in the ground.
Shit. How do you explain to your buddy that you took a quiz to see if his fictional counterpart is gay?
But even after the silent ‘one’, it takes Dean a few seconds. He tries to get in the ‘zone’, that inside the actor studio type of bullshit about actually being the character you play.
Then, he looks at his glass. He thinks of Benny. A vampire - not a man. So he could sit this one out. Stay safely hidden in plain sight.
“Is this for the light show? Go through our management, man,” a guitarist said. “Though if this is a pitch, I’m not that impressed.”
Then they have to exchange only one look before they rush to the surveillance room. On several of the screens, there is live footage of Dean and Cas.
He can feel Cas’s breath on his lips. Wait, is Cas trying to re-enact something here? Jensen tries hard not to think anything inappropriate, to not accidentally pray anything at him.
He imagines what his body must look like from above, right now, spread on this cheap hard bed, sharing a room with nothing but lewd drawings of himself.
Kevin blinks up at him in confusion, and it’s taking Dean all he has to keep from effectively strangling him - they still need him for the tablet - so he walks out the door, straight to his room.
Frozen still, he waits, staring into the relative fuzzy shadows playing over the motel room wall. He hasn’t felt this lost since he was in hell. It lasts a minute. It lasts a lifetime. There’s no way of knowing. Then, Cas slowly moves closer, until his naked - oh God, oh God, Dean forgot it was naked - torso presses up against Dean’s t-shirt clad back. Cas’ legs effortlessly bow into his. It’s unexpectedly warm, it’s… It’s strange how well they fit. Almost divine.
But then the moment is gone. Dean just turns and walks out, opening and closing his hand a few times as if to shake something that’s stuck there.
Seconds go by, and Dean opens his mouth several times but the oxygen still hasn’t returned, damn it. He can hear a ringing in his ears and all he can do is watch Cas’ stone cold face recede further away as he gets off the couch, and promptly walks out the tv room.
. He should stop talking like a damn fanfic Dean. “Um, I mean - I’m staying in a motel room, you’re slee… coming with me.”
He unclenches them, but then changes his mind and clenches them up again. Cas probably needs the continuity.
Dean removes his sticky t-shirt and throws it on the floor. Then, he glances to Cas. He isn’t already asleep, is he? Dean pulls the blanket back on the bed and covers them both. Cas quietly blinks up at him, letting himself be tucked in.
“Wait… wait a minute.” The drummer dropped his sticks. He looked pale as a ghost. “I’ve seen The Good Place. Is this hell?”
Before this, Dean hadn’t noticed how large Cas’ hands were, how long his fingers. Now, well, he has to. For drawing purposes.
He puts one hand on Cas’ neck, rubbing a little circle on it with his thumb, and goes for: “Sorry, mate. I don’t swing that way. Why, do you think I’m hot?”
It really is, it is. Dean wants Cas to just hold him down and bang him already, he wants to feel the fullness of him, deep inside. He wants to be unsure he’ll walk normally tomorrow. He wants Cas to mark him.
,” Dean says, and Cas moans desperately. He hears Cas fall over that brink. He feels soft warm spurts hitting his skin. His back. His cheeks. His ass. Painted with cum.
If Dean adjusts his seating at that point, that’s purely because he has been sitting in the same position for too long, damn it.
Hm. Curiously, he opens another tab and googles this bloke. To his surprise, he’s some sort of poet. These fans are also into poetry and shit? That’s deeper than he expected.
He glances up at the angel. Cas’s eyes are still pinned to Dean like he’s determined to win a one-man staring contest.
He considered killing the remaining members of Led Zeppelin, but he wasn’t so sure if they’d even end up in heaven. Maybe more of an escalator down than a stairway up situation. Always too much bureaucracy with these rock bands.
Why is Cas doing this? What good is the angel in the Empty? Can’t he see? They just gotta hold out long enough for her mortal wound to do Death in, damn it.
He leans back, gauging Cas’ every reaction. He looks… open. There’s delight in his eyes, as he watches Dean show himself. Something… something Dean can’t name.
But at least he’s back in his own body, in a world that has his family and absolutely no demon activity in it.
He traces Cas’s edges, making sure there’s enough lube, before he hesitantly pushes one finger in, one digit deep. Dean breathes heavily. Or was that Cas breathing? He can’t tell anymore. It’s so hot. Man, has he conditioned himself to find this hot, with all his nighttime (and okay, daytime) reading? Or is it. Just hot.
Just living with Dean and Cas can drive a grown man a little crazy, that’s all. They haven’t been talking to each other, with Cas often leaving the room whenever Dean comes in. Or the other way around.
Dean’s eyes are nervously surveying their surroundings. The mystery bisexuhomicidal maniac could be here now, for all they know.
Okay, this was the unplanned bonus chapter that totally ran away from me. I love misunderstandings, I love angsty drinking games. I hope you do too.
He glared at what some obviously misguided people called “one of the greatest rock bands of all time”. They all had puzzled looks on their faces. He reached into his trenchcoat and took out a shotgun.
He takes a few steps toward him, goddamn it, they’re both still naked as hell, and Cas’ eyes widen. Cas almost flinches away but Dean cups his hands softly around Cas’ face and leans down, how else can he express how much Cas is loved by them - okay, fine, by
He’s also alone, and buried in some bunker in a universe where the scariest things exist. Jensen shivers. He’s just an actor, actually. He doesn’t even really have a give ‘em hell attitude. What if he’s stuck here?
“I should have known you were a perv,” Dean quips, making Cas jump. “You always look dressed for some sort of exhibitionists anonymous meeting anyway.”
“Dean? Don’t you wanna help me find a way to get into the Empty?” Sam glares at him from the table, where he’s buried in books.
How do you talk to your angel best friend about the fictional online porn you’ve been reading about the two of you?
Please forgive me. Thank you all for screaming at me in the comments yesterday, I loved each and every one of you.
Dean exhales. None of the fanfic prophecy stuff then. Good. That thing was written totally out of character anyway!
He pinches the bridge of his nose. “Uh, Cas, I’m sorry you had to hear… Yeah. What did you hear exactly?”
Damn. This is really kinda getting to Dean, too, he must admit. Maybe Bobo is actually a damn genius after all.
If he’s still doing the damn toy analogy - Dean feels like a square trying to squish through the wrong damn hole. Opening! Not hole.
He turned around to Kansas and removed their gags with an angry snap of his fingers. He pointed to the stage in the back of the roadhouse, where he had set up instruments identical to their real life ones.
“What about the models?” Dean asks the pastor, keeping his tone light. “Do you, um. Switch them up?”
So if he has to keep a silence going for three days in this damn room, to evoke that spontaneity, then he will.
His gaze wanted to linger on Dean’s hands, but he gathered all his courage and forced himself to look up at Dean’s face.
Dean sits up, and hell, since he’s already half out anyway - fighting against the evil restraints of fabric and gravity - he quickly wriggles out of his underwear. No barriers except for the t-shirt, which he can’t remove, of course. He’d feel too exposed.
Cas already died once in his short stint as a human. And now there isn’t even a body around to revive.
Dean is falling into place, all his broken pieces knitting together as his lips press against Cas’s mouth, more eager with each second.
“Up,” Cas orders, and Dean complies, lets himself be manhandled on the couch. Cas turns him over on his knees, facing the motel room door and front window, the closed drapes leaving a hint of sky and stars in the middle.
He remembers discovering Becky’s fanpages for the Supernatural books a few years ago, though he tries not to ever think about it. Dude, they’re
Suddenly, the roadhouse’s doors opened behind them. Two silhouettes in the shape of the Winchesters appeared, and Cas could swear time stopped altogether.
“Dean, you um… You know there’s a lot of fanfiction written about you, right?” Kevin asks on a quiet evening in the bunker.
But if Cas thinks there’s a single thought in Dean’s head, he is wrong, because Dean’s melon is empty.
Dean shakes his head. Unbe-lievable. Does Sam think he’s blind? He can see Sam’s eyes moving between him and Cas. He’s standing
Sam looks over his shoulder from his usual spot on the floor, taking them in with a frown. Dean throws him a warning look. His brother better not make
Dean ignores him, still blinking at his screen. The fuck is his life? In big, black letters, he rereads:
He cannot believe his life right now. In some stupid street on a boring Wednesday morning, he’s burning titty art like some Republican housewife.
“I’m at the motel, um, the one I booked for the disappearing nude model case. And now, Cas — He disappeared too, Sam!”
“Jack,” Dean’s greeting was tinged with clear admiration. Then something else moved across his features. “Cas—”
Dean’s pretty sure he’s a decent kisser, he’s surely never had any complaints. And he’s brushed his teeth three times while the others were packing up the Impala.
“Don’t move, Dean,” Cas orders, and his voice is so firm even Dean’s dick takes notice, following suit.
Dean thinks about all the bedsharing fics he’s read. About fictional Dean waking up with fictional Cas all tangled up around his body. How that Cas would nuzzle his nose in that Dean’s neck and it would make all of his hairs stand up and how he’d feel like home, feel strangely safe. And then feel something poking in his back. And then-
“Interesting - this is too good,” Chuck says, studying both of them. “You haven’t told him, have you? What you did to poor old Cas?”
It’s like a gut punch. Dean hates nothing more than feeling helpless. His eyes dart to the ceiling with frustration.
But that’s not exactly something he can explain to this character who doesn’t even know he’s fictional.
They don’t seem to be paying attention. Seems rude — are they even watching the show? Dean frowns at them.
Cas’s throat ran dry with indecision. He’d already said it once, and to be honest, the consequences of that were a bit traumatizing. With all of the, uh, being taken to the angel elephant cemetery.
But he gets lost in the bunker and might even be running in actual circles while trying to act casual to Sam whenever he accidentally arrives back at the war room space again in this whole maze of a building.
Maybe the Empty gave Cas enough time to realise the truth about Dean - he ain’t all that much. Not any of the things Cas was rambling about. Not the most caring man on Earth, not even
Dean’s brain pretty much pops like a fuselage. His dick gets, impossibly, even harder, dripping a little precum on the couch.
But the two star crossed lovers are too preoccupied in their own weird little scenario to pay them any mind.
“What?” A nervous laugh escapes Dean’s lips. “No, you don’t. You have a job. You said it yourself, you are a
It’s just, the author somehow tricked him into picking all the Dean answers. Like a queer trickster.
Three victims so far, all women, and all with one thing in common — they went missing within a few days after posing nude in a local life drawing class.
He runs until he finds a small, quiet alleyway. It’s the back of a restaurant and some houses, nothing much else.
drawn to Cas because he felt so miserable, wasn’t he? Dean’s face crumples slightly thinking about it.
Cas sighs deeply. Maybe Dean is an angel because it feels as if that hand is sending grace through him.
“I get that you’re nervous. Take a minute to get back into the zone, my dude,” the director says. “Great work so far.”
“Gave him a whole speech about how disgusted Cas made him feel. You see, Dean loves cars and chicks. As I intended, some people say.”
Maybe it’s because Cas has run out of luck. Maybe it’s because he’s a former angel and the mojo doesn’t work on him. Maybe he’ll never be back.
Dean points his finger at Cas’s heart, and Cas hopes he can’t feel how it's hammering in his chest as he searches for the answer. To be fair, though, it
Cas places his right hand on Dean’s shoulder. Where he always puts it - over the scar. Ever since they met, Cas has been Dean’s missing puzzle piece.
Cas increases his speed, rutting harder against him, making him feel every fucking inch of his hard dick.
“I…” Cas says. He swallows the rest, and looks up. He’s flayed right open. A tear streaks down his cheek.
Slowly, air refills his lungs, and Dean decides that it’s kind of cool that the rhythm of an angel’s breaths helped him remember how to be human again.
“I don’t want to, Sam. Not…” Dean looks at Cas, who looks up at him completely stunned. “With… I just can’t.”
Sam is the last to sit down. “It’s simple. We each take turns making a statement about things we’ve never done. If you
Cas just rolls his eyes, turns around and starts walking again. Dean notices a bus stop a little further down the road. It appears Cas is headed exactly here.
After Billie sent Jack into the Empty to safely ‘explode’, it had been made Loud. But what did that mean? The Empty did not strike Dean as particularly noisy. On the contrary, there was something unsettling about the quiet. Quiet implies a counterpart of noise. This was just… absence. The way a hole in the wall is just there by courtesy of the bricks, it is not anything in itself. It is a shortage of the other.
While Dean is talking, a MONTAGE starts. We see different moments spanning the entire SERIES. Starting with the entrance in the BARN, Dean STABBING Cass, Cass sitting on Dean’s bed. The montage includes all their HUGS and Dean’s moments of GRIEF every time he lost Cass. It also includes domestic scenes in the BUNKER with their family.
Dean moves back as Cas walks into the shower stall. It has ample space for two adults and it's one of Dean's favorite places in their house. “You decide to come to bed too?”
Dean grins and pulls Cas close. “Shut up, asshole.” He sighs as he feels Cas' warmth seep into his body. “You're in your forties too.”
The burn is still present and Dean rubs his cheek. “Yeah,” he mumbles. “I – I didn't know you could do that...”
“The storm is close, Dean, as are you.” Noticing that Dean was still on edge, Cas paused, only to grip his hips hard. “Look at me.”
Dean sighs and looks over his shoulder. “I should have left you back in Red Cloud when we stopped for gas.”
Dean grunts at the first strike on his ass, more out of surprise than pain. The second strike hits him in the exact same spot. It's not a cane, nor a paddle despite being smooth, Dean can feel that, but he can't venture to say what it is either. He turns his head to the other side.
At the sound of a loud clang, Dean turns to see Cas whisking like crazy and cracking eggs like a pro.
A finger slides down the crack of his ass and Dean's hole twitches in excitement. He moans softly and wants to move up and meet Castiel's finger.
Opening the fridge, Cas brings out the jar of peanut butter. “I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm just stating facts.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes in displeasure. The coat was too light despite being soaked. He ran his hand over his tie. It was too short and the same went for his belt.
With gritted teeth, Dean closes the laptop and tosses it to the foot of the bed. He glances at the alarm clock. 3:12 taunts him in blinking red.
Cas nestles close to Dean's right side and Ion takes up the left one. They both sling an arm around Dean and Dean sighs and closes his eyes. He's blissed-out, fucked raw and totally happy.
Gripping the phone tighter than he'd gripped Dean's ass in purgatory (Dean still didn't know that Castiel had moved the mark to the shoulder because it was a more innocuous place) Castiel called his hunter husband.
“Mm, yeah?” Dean catches Cas' mouth in a kiss and revels in the taste. Even after all this time, he still tastes of lightning on dark nights, the salt of the ocean, and underneath it all, the essence that is all Cas. It reminds Dean of the night they first met. He chuckles lightly and Cas stops kissing him.
Despite knowing it was futile, Dean tried to move, tried to escape but all that did was that Castiel pressed down even harder on his throat.
“Hey, plant. Are you okay? Is this your everyday look or are you depressed?” He picks up the plant and touches the soil. It's dry but isn't it supposed to be dry? Doesn't that mean that the plant has absorbed all the water with its roots? He pushes the finger deeper and it's like touching dry leaves. Maybe not
Cas slowly fluttered his eyelids open, only to widen them in surprise. Dean's hard-on was covered by a red, glowing light. “Dean? Are you wearing a – glow in the dark condom?”
He passed the small kitchen area and found Cas sitting in the living room, pen and paper in hand, because of course. Cas was an art student after all.
It wasn't so much so that the room was spinning. Dean didn't think so at least, it was the Earth's rotation. That's what he was feeling. Fuck, Mother Earth was out for a drive this evening. All Dean could do was hold on.
“I don't know. I mean I helped her around, and we talked and such.” Dean swallows. He did miss her, not that he was gonna tell Sam that. “So maybe this was her 'thank you'.”
“I dunno. What we talking about? Shirts, bedsheets, pants... I've never worn anything made of linen, I don't think. Cotton, I guess.”
“Well, I don't know about date...” Dean pauses for a sec. “But yeah, it's totally a date. I'll woo the fuck out of you.”
His other self moves his fingers in and out, easing Dean's hole open. “I think that's enough, don't you?”
Before he leaves his room, Dean grabs the jacket. His thumb goes over the handprint and Dean has to swallow down the ache that threatens to bubble up in his throat and spill over into a cry.
Goosebumps rose across Dean's arms and legs, hell all over his body. It felt fantastic. His cock, already fat grew harder and the feeling of pleasure, just from this was amazing.
“Mm”, Cas kissed him one last time, pulled away and smiled as he looked at Dean again. “What thing did I do?”
The cool night air is crisp but Dean's still warm and perspiring. Instead of being a relief, the temperature coaxes forth goosebumps on his body. Grabbing his shoes, Dean puts them on and before zipping up the tent flap, he grabs a hoodie and his gun. He may be retired (semi at least) but no hunter worth their salt leaves without a weapon.
All of the goodies in the bunker uncovered, he strode back through the corridors until he ended up in the war room once again. He paused, leaning against the edge of the wide map-topped table that took up most of the space. His fingers idly walked through Russia as he arranged his thoughts, moving through the Ural Mountains before coming to an abrupt halt, his hand frozen as his lips pouted out thoughtfully.
He sighs and gets up. Slipping on a robe, Dean yawns and rubs a hand over his eyes. They feel heavy, the grit of sleep mingling with bone-deep tiredness that hasn't left his body since–
“Yes, we can stop. I think that's probably for the best.” Cas looked at Dean, his face calm as he slowly put the money back in order in the box. Then he flashed Dean the Jail card before putting that card down as well.
Dean knew 14 karat gold was stronger than 24 karat, he could always get the size adjusted, and the price was damn right. “I’ll take it,” Dean said, pulling out his wallet and slapping $60 on the counter. “Keep the change,” he smiled, taking the ring from the bemused old fart. “And Merry Christmas!”
Castiel looks down at his coffee mug with blue, yellow and pink swirls and smiles. “Thanks. I got it at Barnes and Noble.”
He adjusts the chairs in the 'Dean Cave' so they're aligned and nods to himself. Flicking off the lights, Dean moves through the halls, fingers trailing lightly on the walls behind him.
“Oh, I was done a while ago. I even had time to go over the floors and hammer down the nails that were poking up.”
“Cas, no!” Dean sinks down onto his knees, horror closing up his throat and blackness coating his fingers.
Pulling the safety off, loading the gun, all those moments were not needed when thought manifested instantly – John didn't even really
“I'm fine. I'm just... I can't ever thank you enough for everything you've done for me.” He looks down at the floor for a moment and then looks at Cas, before returning his attention back to Dean. “I love you. Both of you.” His face turns serious. “Everything is ready. Be back at the same spot in ten days.”
Cas takes a last bite and puts his plate away. He looks up at the stars that are visible like little dots in the night sky. Dean looks at him. The dark hair, with gray peppered at the sides. The tiny wrinkles that speak of age lived and wisdom acquired. Dean's mouth quirks into a smile. If people only knew that looks were deceptive and that Cas was much older, almost incomprehensibly so.
There were treacherous tears in Dean's eyes. He could feel them building up and he wasn't sure if they were due to humiliation – Castiel knowing all these things, all these
His body is so close to Dean's that he can feel Castiel's chest expand as he breathes. He can't take another step back, the shelf is already digging into his back. “No.” It comes out a whisper. Dean should make an attempt to move, but he can't, doesn't
Suddenly, there's a hand spreading his cheeks and then a finger presses against his taint. “Cas...” Dean mumbles his approval around Ion's cock.
Castiel really didn't want to; he was a curious creature but also wise enough to know what to expect. Sure enough, Dean had slipped on a green, glow in the dark condom on his achingly hard cock. Surely now his hard-on would wither and die but that was not the case.
Unfortunately for Dean, he's not the only one starving. Even from a distance, he can hear Henley and Lorp clucking happily and as they pass the coop, Henley flaps her wings.
Dean pulls back but notices Cas freeze up for a second before he gets that suspicious look in his eyes. The sky blue of his eyes seem to turn darker.
Cas simply nodded as if he was the picture perfect image of obedience. “As you wish, Dean.” He stepped out of his pants and quickly removed his socks. The shirt flew across the room as he tossed it somewhere in the corner and his underwear was last to go. Finally, Cas was naked. Cas didn't seem to mind at all; he casually tilted his head to the side and spoke low. “Like what you see?” He even did a twirl, and as he came back around, Cas had that mischievous glint in his eyes again.
The bench is of dark, smooth wood with custom leather fittings and bindings. Castiel built it for Dean as an anniversary gift. It was their fifth year together.
He feels the small puff of air against his neck as Cas exhales in amusement. “I don't know. Fractals are kind of sexy.”
until the letters are blurry. He takes a short break, puts away the book to flex his knee, and grabs another book that he found deep in the Archives. It's about planes, dimensions, and territories of old. Maybe the Empty is mentioned there.
Dean grumbles and pats the pocket on his hoodie with his other hand. He grins when he hears a rustling sound and his smile turns bigger when his fingers grab a small package. Pulling it out, he recognizes the tiny pack of Skittles.
Pushing Cas down with a strong hand, Dean whispered in his ear, “Now let's create a disturbance in the Force, Cas.”
Dean, Sam and Jack have rescued Cas from the Empty. Dean is happy but he's hasn't been able to tell Cas the extent of his feelings. Still, the fear lingers, that if Dean tells him, the universe will manage to give Dean and Cas the middle finger, and take Cas away from him. So Dean is silent. Until he decides to face his fears, and do it anyway. He just needs a few beers first.
Cas grabs the front of Dean's pants, and Dean can't help it, he grinds against his hand, his cock already hard.
“Happens when you swim in the ocean, Cas.” Dean sighs and closes his eyes. “Man, I don't know if it's the sun or the swim or whatever, but I could take a nap.”
“I just wanted to say... Y yo a ti, Cas.” Dean had no idea why it came to him in Spanish, but he was still drunk and figured he'd just go with the flow.
Everyone bursts out into laughter, and Dean recognizes the dark timbre of Cas' voice. Traitor. “Alright, kids, you've had enough fun. It's not like there aren't supermarkets. We'll be fine, right, Cas?”
“Stop stealing my pillow, Cas.” Dean hugs it for emphasis. “My neck gets all stiff. You have your own.”
That thought alone is enough. Castiel moans softly as he comes, spilling his seed inside Dean. He pulls out his cock and rubs the cockhead in between his cheeks, wiping away the rest of his come and decides to do one final thrust. He slips in easily into Dean's already open hole. “Fuck, I can almost fuck you again.” Just the thought is arousing. Using his own come as lube to fuck Dean again; he can't lie that the thought isn't appealing. Very appealing.
Dean stops breathing as he feels Castiel's finger finally moving along his crack. He's lubed it up and it feels so good. Dean exhales and sinks down further into Castiel's lap. “Fuck yes,” he murmurs.
Finally, Cas splayed his hand over Dean's heart. “This middle-aged heart is perfect. “It cared for your brother when you were both young, when you were supposed to be cared for and nurtured and loved. And when others would let their hardened heart stay that way, you allowed your heart to bleed with love. What a gift it is to care about the world like you do, Dean. What a gift it is you've given me, that you've slowly opened up your heart for love again, for me and others.”
Dean shuts his eyes in ecstasy. Fluid squishes out from the tip of Cas' tentacle and he spreads it all over Dean's hole.
Salathiel dropped the plate on the floor in pure shock. It was not Castiel's message that had them reeling, so off-kilter that  they momentarily allowed Min to surface to calm her beating heart.
“That's a good thing though. We're not getting younger. And we're done and we deserve the peace that comes with that. Let someone else do the hard work and grinding. I've payed enough with my blood, sweat, and tears. Hell, I've paid with my
Dean arches an eyebrow but there's a mischievous glint in his eye. “You seem very eager, Mr. Winchester.”
“Oh, God,” Dean murmurs around Cas' cock as Ion picks up the pace. He's afraid that he's going to choke on Cas' cock with how Ion pushes his hips forward with each thrust. He craves air, yet the feeling of not having enough is intoxicating.
Cas takes Dean's hand in his and brings it to his lips. He kisses it once softly, but there's a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “You have been dead.”
He catches Dean's exhale and kisses him. “Dean, Dean.” There's something holy in how Castiel utters his name, like it's the most sacred promise. He takes that promise and marks Dean's skin with it.
Dean catches Cas' chapped lips in an eager kiss. “You think too much about this. I'll give you something else to think about.” He kisses Cas deeper and smiles when he hears him moan softly.
“Don't you 'hello' me. Spill, why the hell do you look and sound like a human kazoo? And why the fuck do I have glitter all over me?”
“You're beautiful,” Castiel whispers. He pushes one of Dean's legs to the side, changes the angle, goes faster. Deeper.
Sudden fear churns in Dean's stomach, and as it spreads, it turns his insides acidic. He feels like throwing up.
one.” He licked his lips. “And you're an angel. What I feel for you is more than love. It's something that humans can't define or identify. It supersedes humanity.”
are.” He laughed at the cold stare Ariel gave him before paying attention to the game again. He had two hundred limes to harvest until he could claim the big mother lime. Time to plant. His thoughts went to Nuriel briefly.
“Now you do.” Jack pulls up his fishing rod but no fish has taken the bait. “It's nice here. Do you and Cas like it?”
Just when Dean is about to pause the movie and demand an explanation for whatever the fuck is going on–because something
Castiel is right behind Dean. He can feel him, his energy is like a shield all around him and Dean wants nothing else than turn around and kiss the man. “Mm. Turn the ignition for me.” The car's headlights work properly but when Castiel tries to turn the ignition nothing happens.”Alright, that sounds like a bad ignition switch. Nothing too expensive.
“It wasn't,” Dean grumbled but at least it's Friday tomorrow. I have the weekend off and next week three of the classes are with Metatron. It's pie-time! He's grouchy as fuck but apparently, his pie teaching skills are legendary.”
In the corner, on the leather chair, Dean spots a bag of something. Grabbing it, he realizes it's some potato chips. They might be a day or two old. Dean doesn't care. He devours the bag, rubs his greasy fingers on the robe, and goes back to work.
“Mm. I've been thinking. We can grow some herbs too. They'll be useful for spells as well as for eating.”
The light of the crystal chandeliers doesn't reach this far and the corner is wrapped in shadows which suit Dean just fine. As he swallows his last bite of cake, lost in thought, someone approaches.
He's not sure what he enjoys the most, the feeling of Cas inside him, or the feeling of Cas around him. A gentle caress near his hip that turns hard, almost bruising as Cas bottoms out. Dean turns his head to the side and closes his eyes. He's dimly aware of his own sighs, the warmth that courses through his body and the fullness of Cas' cock.
“Because when I used that dagger on you, my world – everything – stopped.” Dean grins. “Clever huh.”
For a moment, Dean wanted to move, wanted to press back against Cas and feel his cock inside him, wanted to be taken to the brink.
It's all good, Dean thinks. Cas has never looked hotter, sweat making his body glisten in the sun and with dirty smudges on his face. He can't help but picture Cas with a cowboy hat on, a horse under his legs with those big, thick thighs... “Nothin's wrong. I'm just... thirsty.” Dean winks.
Cas touches his arm. “I'd give away my powers a thousand times over just to share one moment like this with you.”
Castiel is silent but he grabs Dean's arms and makes him turn and face him. A thumb caresses his lips and Dean recoils.
The groans that escape his lips travel right down to Dean's gut. Cas tightens the hold on Dean's cock when it feels too good, making them moan in unison. The way he moves towards Dean, as if he's someone Cas can't live without... How his name is a devotional on Cas' lips. “Dean...”
Witch Dean takes another step forward. He's so close now that he can see the freckles scattered on Dean's cheeks.”I'm a witch, too, and so is Cas. Lucky for you, you didn't bring him here, because he'd have your sorry ass for talking like that to me.”
Dean moves to the front door and tries the door handle. The door opens with a soft click. “Not even locked. But who's gonna come here and steal their shit. They probably have the house stuffed with canned beans and pickled herring.”
Snaking his arm around Cas, Dean mumbled in his sleep. “I think this body is getting past its prime. Relatively speaking. You're still hot as fuck.”
Dean walks over to his brother. They've been through so much together – stopped Apocalypses and died more times than Kenny in South Park. “Good. With your big moose height, I was counting on it.”
Soon, Ion increases his speed and as he spreads his hand over Dean's throat, Dean relaxes more. “Fuck, yeah. Just like that.” Ion fucks Dean's throat and with each thrust of his hips, he feels the outline of his own cock against Dean's throat. “You're beautiful like this, all splayed out. You should see yourself, your lips all pink, your mouth stretched.”
-an Angelology book (which had a shit ton of information wrong, also? Way to rub salt in that wound, Dean)
Trees still surround them, thick and sturdy, but the under vegetation gives way to more rocks. Dean leads them to a great, flat rock – the color of muted honey – that hangs out over the river with its bubbling sound and flowing waters.
Dean closed his eyes against the pain. He thought he heard Cas shout his name but it could just as easily be his pulse beating between his ears. Blinking, he opened his eyes slowly but closed them again.
Dean takes another gulp of his beer but doesn't miss the quick look Cas gives him. Dean lets his fingers slide down Cas' arm before he intertwines them with Cas' hand. He squeezes gently. It still makes him all warm inside holding Cas like this, even though it's been almost six months since, well, since everything.
his now, the previously barren walls are covered with a bookshelf and filled with books he likes to read. Dean can't help but smile as he sees Vonnegut among his collection. He raised the kid good. A painting hangs to Dean's right: Kelly with a smile on her face. Jack had been over the moon when he got it for Christmas. Dean had – with the help of Sam and Cas –acquired a digital photo of Kelly and commissioned an artist to turn it into a piece of art.
Not that Dean will admit it out loud, but painting is kind of relaxing. The gentle strokes of the brush up and down, how the wall is slowly transformed, is calming in a way. Dean gets the same feeling when he cleans his weapons or works on the Impala. His mind drifts to a place that's... still. Although he's had to pull himself away from the trance now and then just due to the shade of the paint. “Seagull gray, what a load of bull. If you blink, it almost looks white,” Dean mutters. “The whole paint industry is a scam. Are we sure that they weren't in business with Crowley back in the day?”
Slowly raising his head, Dean opened his eyes, squinting. “Cas?” Pulling at the chain curiously, Dean suddenly stopped, casting a glance at Castiel before looking away.
Dean sighs and looks out at the ocean. The waves are gentle now, and the sun has passed its highest point. The evidence of his earlier walk–toes in the sand–has been washed away by the
for hunters. I don't need some wide-eyed, green hunter fledgling to read all about my love for horror movies or how many times God fucked me over.”
“Are you trying to kill me?” Dean tries to chase away the image of Castiel in a cowboy hat but his mind insists on holding on to a very specific version – Castiel
“Have faith,” Cas whispers. He kisses Dean again, plunges his tongue inside. There's a secretion there, a fluid and Dean swallows it down as Castiel continues to kiss him. His tentacles coil around his body, and as Cas strokes his arms, Dean feels heat erupt in the wake of Cas' fingers.
Cas sounds so casual, like he's not holding Dean's dick in his hand. He swipes a hand over Dean's head, making Dean lean into him, seeking more friction. “Oh my god, good, so damn good.”
Dean moans. “Yeah, yeah, I think so too.” It's too much. Dean's been on the edge for too long and when Castiel starts stroking his cheeks again at the same time as he fingerfucks his hole, Dean is gone.
“Please,” Dean says as he wraps some saran wrap around the bowl of chicken wings. “You're talking to the guy who could turn milk, cheerios, bread, and eggs into a fucking gourmet dinner. You dip the bread in milk and egg, fry it and then roll it in crushed cheerios. Sammy didn't complain when I made it.” Dean looks over at Jack's potatoes. “Perfect, and now we're gonna boil these babies for twenty-five minutes. Come, Jack, I'll show you how we monster-proofed the house.”
The Empty shrunk some more and hovered over to Jared's shoulder, where it settled with a big, squishy noise. Jared petted it absentmindedly. “The show isn't about heterosexuality or nonbinary. It's a show about love. Lead your life with love. That doesn't mean that you want to make out, it's not about that. I can tell my daughter I love her, it doesn't mean I wanna do something with her, uh... this isn't the point of this scene.” He waved at Dean and Cas.
Cas' strong fingers around his throat turn from warning to vice as he squeezes and that's all Dean needs. He comes with a scream as the orgasm is pulled out of him and Cas holds him up, his hips pistoning in and out of him.
Cas squinted. “Yes, you're correct. It seems you have some cognitive functions left.” He made a motion to move again but Dean placed a hand on Cas' chest.
The only sound Dean hears for a while is the ocean waves crashing onto the shore until Cas speaks again. “I don't think it was love then, but it was a bond, a seed of admiration, a glimpse of your beauty that grew until I realized that yes, I was in love with you.”
He's fucking panting now and his head is back; he's lost in his own rhythm and it fuels Dean's own fire. Squeezing his head harder, Dean whispers in the phone. I'd suck that cock of yours, take every inch of come you give him. I'd let it rest there on my tongue until you order me to swallow it –“
Cas whipped his head around so fast. "What the fuck is that?! My feathers feel all soggy now! I -this is gross...I don't like it. I want it off now."
Suddenly, Cas pushes Dean forward on the bed and with a few last thrusts hitting deeper than ever, he moans out harshly and comes, spilling inside Dean.
“Mom, we haven't even started dancing yet.” There's laughter from the crowd and Dean smiles softly as he looks at Cas. “So, we're back to where it all started.”
Remember that note at the beginning where I said the fics would be around 1k? I lied. This one is 3k... <,<
The card's glittery. Very glittery. The card shines and sparkles and he already has glitter on his pant leg.
He could see Simon and Jared's house from a distance. The light emanating from the windows seemed warm and bright.
Cas stops and looks at Dean, shaking his head. “What do you mean?” He angles his body slightly to the side. “I just didn't know you were home already.”
Swallowing, Dean shakes his head. “No, Father.” He stands and bends over the armrest, the shelf digging into his skin. The stone is cold underneath him and his nipples pebble as they're pressed against the altar.
The claws around Dean's body tighten. To his horror, the chicken feet haven't vanished. No, one foot is instead a morbid extension of Dean's right arm. His shirt is rolled up, revealing where smooth skin turns into a black, ridged pattern. He feels how the claws dig into the soil, pushing him down. The other Dean, still a giant, kneels down and Dean starts choking as the webbing
It doesn't escape Dean that Sam doesn't correct him on the worms and how they locate their prey. Dean narrows his eyes. Something is off. Sam hates these kinds of movies but if he wants to torture himself, Dean is not one to dissuade him.
“What?” Dean looks at the glint in Cas' eyes and then he remembers. “Oh, yeah, I – It was dark, and I was tired... I just put something on, alright.”
Again the box moves, but it's more of a ripple now. Black goo bubbles out, enveloping the ring and box.
Slowly, he pushes against the hole. He angels Dean's other leg that's moved and it gives him greater access.
It's coming from the coop. Dean looks back at Cas. He's snoring, laying there like Sleeping Beauty. Dean shoves him. “Wake up, your chickens are calling.” He pushes Cas again.
He did that. The thought leaves him heady with power and a deep love for Dean. For the trust Dean has in him.
Sneaking back to his room, he met Cas of all people in the hallway (maybe not so unlikely, they were just five of them).
Even in darkness, they can see it. Dull, slimy skin and where the eyes should be are just hollow holes. The mouth is a round circle, a gaping maw with sharp teeth.
Scoffing, Dean closes his eyes. “I don't think none of us did.” He smiles softly. “I sure imagined though, dreamed of it.” He opens his eyes when Cas pops the lid of the bottle but relaxes as he feels Cas' fingers in his hair.
“Will you do it again? Sing, I mean.” Dean asks, much later. His limbs are entwined with Cas’s to the point where he is not sure where he ends and Cas begins. It is a glorious feeling.
“No, Cas, you don’t get it,” he set the freshly made tea down in front of Cas, sits next to him. “I could
Occasionally, Dean would wake up to hear them murmuring to each other. He wondered what they spoke about.
“Yeah? That what you were doing, huh? Praying?” Seems a bit redundant, now, when the only people worth praying to are a) Cas himself and b) the baby in the crib.
Their first meeting was just as the first time Dean and Sara met Castiel himself. Appearing without warning likely was unhelpful in creating a calm atmosphere. Hagar had simply appeared at the foot of Dean’s motel room bed, red flames licking at her golden plumage, eyes trained on the hunter and her talons clutching the weak metal of the bed stand.
The angels had fallen, and Cas was somehow to blame, and it didn’t matter really because there was so much else going on (see: Sammy almost dead in Dean’s arms, Abigail shivering around his neck, scales looking dried out and eyes lifeless as they stared at Dean).
So Dean had tried to shoot her. From the little she had gleaned from Castiel, this was not unusual behaviour for a boy who had grown up knowing that the Monsters under his bed were real.
“Thought Angel’s couldn’t have daemons,” Dean grunted, but he’d lowered his gun anyway, a protective hand settling on Sara’s back.
like it isn’t a threat, but plenty of monsters like to play dress up in pretty clothing. The bunkers the most heavily warded place he can think of, but they’ve had break in’s before.
“I’m gonna open the rift back home, and it’ll be okay,” Dean was stalling. His fingers were struggling to get the lighter to work.
– is solid. Dean presses his hand against it, then his cheek, as if all that was separating him from Cas was the damn concrete.
“It was beautiful,” Dean is getting better at this, the whole complimenting Cas sincerely thing. He’s probably never going to be as good as Cas is, but he’s trying and Cas isn’t complaining, so he figures that’s a start at the very least.
That night, when Cas had disappeared from their lives once more, Dean held Quin tightly in his arms and told himself over and over that neither of them were crying.
When Castiel did his damn dramatic entrance into that barn, there was one thing above all the others that truly freaked Dean out.
“Look, you had your turn, yeah, give me mine,” Dean took a deep breath and—shit. He probably should have practised this. No, he definitely should have practised this. Four months trying to get Cas out of that shit hole, and only
“Please, Quin,” Dean begs because if she keeps this up he knows he’ll fold. He’ll lay down on the floor next to Cas just like she is, and he’ll rest his head on Cas’s chest like he never got the chance to do when Cas was alive, and he’ll just not move ever again.
But then, there was light all around them and Quin growled and then jumped towards the Cas-light-thing protectively and Dean cut his arm to finish the ritual and barrelled headfirst out of the cold.
“Hello, Dean,” she intones, and her voice breaks the otherwise silence in the room (or at least, it breaks the ringing in Dean’s ears enough that he can hear again).
Hagar might have left then – pushed away by Dean’s words and the uncertainty at her own sudden doubts - if not for Sara pulling herself from his grip and shifting forward towards the edge of the bed. “Ignore him. He is only moody because Sam is out getting laid, and he is not.”
“Yes, Quin. The empty did a passable imitation of yourself, but it could never get Quin quite right.”
he or Quin want, and Dean’s damn certain about that. Touching other peoples daemons isn’t a done thing, and it certainly ain’t something that happens in company (unless you’re a three-year-old half-angel who doesn’t know any better). He and Quin are happy with just each other, always have been, always will be.
He’s on his fifth glass of whiskey when he stumbles down the corridor to the room where it happened. Everything is exactly how they left it.
For the first time since Cas died and Quin growled at him, Dean feels something in him come back to life.
Hagar looked away. She could understand now, why Castiel always seemed so confused after he spent time with these two. She was not fairing any better.
He’d sort of expected it to be like purgatory; monsters and trees and fighting for his damn life to get to Cas and
about that now. No taboo subjects. Just them. “One moment of true happiness, or something like that.”
Dean steadies his hands, holds them up in surrender, then – quietly, praying even though the only thing worth praying to is now dead in front of him – that the kid can’t hear him as he murmurs, “we can’t let him rot, Quin. We gotta do this properly.”
But he’d never been great at either of those things, so he settled for just taking another sip of his beer.
“How will we find him?” Quin’s voice too, despite the whisper, seemed like the only thing in the whole universe.
“Yeah,” he finally echoed, throat feeling far too dry, “we love you. And Cas…your idea of happiness? A little shitty, man. ‘Cos you can have me. And then we can work on making you as happy as possible, huh? I reckon we can do better than a deathbed confession.”
No, it was none of that. Dean had been dealing with freaky since he was a kid, after all. What he hadn’t dealt with in his time was someone so human-like not having a daemon to speak of.
insufferable since you figured that out,” Castiel says, but he’s laughing, and Dean is too, quietly, because Jack’s hearing is far too perfect for his own good, but still.
The kitchen lights feel a tad too bright, but Dean’s used to bad lighting (motels weren’t exactly known for having great light fixtures, particularly the don’t-ask-don’t-tell sort they used to frequent), so it’s okay. He puts the kettle on, finds Cas’s mug with the painted bee’s on the side of it.
Through all of it, Dean had been waiting. Or—well, maybe waiting wasn’t the right word. He had been patient about it, and happy to go along with the ‘We-Got-Cas-Out’ party. But he knew that they had a hell of a lot to talk about when they were finally alone, and Dean could feel the words on the tip of his tongue the whole night. Ready. Waiting.
He’d expected it to be too hot and too dirty and too loud. He’d expected it to be some sort of hostile landscape that would trip him up on branches if he wasn’t careful.
One step in front of the other. That’s what he’d been doing for the last four months anyway. Just one step in front of the other, until his steps led him to Cas.
Dean seemed to dislike her explanation too. He made a face, hand tightening fractionally on Sara, “yeah? You and Cas finally decide I ain’t worth the effort? He using his ‘weapon’ to get rid of me?”
Sam’s not said anything – not about Quin's reaction or about…this. Abigail is hanging around his shoulder like she always does, but she’s curled her head in on herself in her grief.
She’s small. A tiny thing, dark wings folded in on themselves, redbreast puffed out. Dean should have known she wasn’t Quin immediately, she fits in the palm of his hand (although, to be fair, he had a lot more to focus on).
Castiel shakes his head slowly, “a miracle,” he decides. Dean’s never much believed in miracles – there’s always some hidden cost – but watching the way Jack happily sits in the park and pets the ducks that flock to him even when he doesn’t have bread, makes him think that maybe things have changed. Maybe God needed the innocence of a kid all along. Maybe that’s all miracles really are; little pieces of innocence; of a child who is also God shining big blue eyes at the world around him.
no parenting books on how to raise a once-fully-grown-now-infant-who-also-so-happens-to-have-the-powers-of-God. Dean figured they were gonna have to wing it, as terrifying as that might be) but he’d stuck with them long enough to know one thing:
Dean vaguely remembered Sam being fussy, when they were a hell of a lot younger, their Dad freshly widowed, and them only just starting out on the road. But time and memory make it easy to forget just how ragged a baby could run someone. When he’s not feeding Jack, or rocking him to sleep, he’s despairing over the fact that the toy train they bought had advertised nowhere on the packet that it could move on its own, yet his son had managed to make it happen regardless because he was a diaper-wearing superhuman (super angel?) who could change the world to his will.
“You’re not. Sam’s fast asleep,” Dean moved further into the room so that he could lift the sleeping Jack out of Cas’s arms. He places a small kiss on Jack’s forehead before putting him in his crib. This isn’t a conversation they should have in front of the baby, mostly because he doesn’t want to wake him. “Come on. I’ll make us some of that tea you like,” Dean holds out his hand, and feels that familiar warmth when Cas takes it. The warmth that says
“We love you,” Quin spoke up before Dean could gather his thoughts together. Apparently, she thought he was taking too long. He shot her a glare but found only smugness staring back at him. She was lucky that he loved her.
Funnily enough, it’s Abigail who is the first to move. She slithers her way down Sam’s arm, to coil in his hands, “It’s nice to meet you,” she hisses.
The suddenness of the sound startles everyone. Dean can feel it. The tension in her shoulders. The pain in her eyes. Fighting with your own daemon is a bad sign – particularly in company – and he knows Sam will clock it and want to talk about it later. But Dean gets it. He does. If Quin lets Dean pick Cas up, then Cas will be really truly dead.
“We don’t have to,” Cas said, almost too quickly, “I understand, Dean. I understand if…I just want to be close to you. As your friend, or your family or anything else you’ll let me be. You do not have to want—”
Because there Cas is, rocking gently on the chair next to Jack’s crib, holding their son in his arms.
“I apologise. I was not aware anyone else was listening. The ancient Enchoian prayers can be rather heady, for human ears, even if they can hear them,” Castiel intoned, and though his voice was the steady monotone Dean had come to find comfort in, there was still the lingering fragments of a smile on his face.
Quin shivers. She’s curled up on his feet, and he knows she’s just as miserable as he is. “I think we both knew,” she murmured.
Except it sorta still is the end of the world because Cas is gone. And everything he said is still ringing in Dean’s ears like static, blocking everything else out.
So he drops Sam off at Eileen’s with a smile, and he tries not to wish that Jack was coming home with them because the kid had a bigger destiny than that now and didn’t need the Winchester’s holding him back. And when he and Quin are safe, back in the bunker, Dean gets out the whiskey and drinks like the world really did end.
“Yeah. Well. Hi,” Dean finally replied after a moment of prolonged silence, dropping the gun onto the bedspread beside him. His hand did not leave Sara’s fur.
But it’s not a shifter. Of course, it’s not. Dean would know if it had been. He’d know Cas anywhere.
The absence, the lack of soul, it made Quin hide herself behind Dean’s legs and bare her teeth in fear. Dean had to still her with a hand on her head.
“Well, we’re here now,” Dean murmured. His voice echoed in the vastness of space, too loud, too loud, too loud.
set of eyes on him, he was wrong. It’s ironic that Cas can’t see his soul now – or at least, can only see Quin like everyone else – but looks even
his own fears? His own want to leave? Or something more sinister? It would be nice if it was the latter, but Dean wasn’t sure it was.
Dean can feel her eyes on him as she trots behind him, following him to prepare Cas’s body. His hand still hurts from where she bit him. Dean remembers, briefly, that Cas once said he didn’t need a daemon because he had all of them. Because he had
“It did not use to be. I used to know no different,” Castiel finally admitted, shifting a little as if uncomfortable to have all their eyes on him.
Cas. He hadn’t known his name. He certainly wouldn’t have thought the thing screeching at him a couple of yards from his own grave was going to one day be the person he shacked up with, had a
Eventually, after Cas had yawned approximately twelve times in the span of five minutes, Sam had announced that he should get some rest.
“I like her too, you know, Cas,” Dean murmured, in prayer, “I just pretend I don’t. But she’s actually alright. We get you out of here, you can listen to her 24/7. I won’t say a damn thing to object,” fuck he just wanted to get Cas and get
She takes one look back at Dean, leans down to affectionately peck his finger and then flies and finds perch on Cas’s shoulder.
die before. Not like this. He’s seen him walk into a damn lake, seen him exploded at the damn end of the world but never
Here’s how it was supposed to go: they’d enter the Empty, guns blazing, and they’d fight their way to Cas, tooth and nail. When they got there, they’d drag him out and nothing – no cosmic horror or entity – would be able to stop them.
“So. Look at you. Proper human now. The soul to prove it,” Dean nods at Doretha as he sits on the edge of the bed.
“I could hear you,” Dean finally breaks the silence as he pours the water in, watching it turn dark from the teabag.
“They can’t,” Castiel whispers back, careful not to disturb the child in his arms. There’s no halt to the melody when Cas does, it continues unbidden and beautiful into the night. “Jack’s not human.”
“Occasionally, when I see the bonds that you all have with your daemons…yes. It can be.” Castiel glanced towards Abigail and Quin curled together on the floor, back to Wendy sat staring at him on the table. For a moment, such grief and longing clouded Cas’s face that Dean wanted to…do something. Reach out. Comfort.
Dean wondered if Wendy would ever settle or if Nephilim daemons got to choose not to. There was so much they didn’t know about Jack’s kind, particularly considering the fact that Heaven had a blanket policy on killing them before they reached puberty. Dean sort of hoped she never did. There was an innocence that watching her shift brought into their lives, and innocence was in poor supply, these days.
“This can’t be the end,” Dean murmured, “this can’t be. We have to get him back, Quin. He’s got to come back.”
Quin touches Castiel for the first time when there isn’t a Castiel to touch. Because Castiel is dead. Luther stabbed him. All that’s left is the body.
Because if Dean’s ever had a blessing in his life, it takes the form of this idiot angel next to him.
He could crush her with his fist, something he was oh so painfully aware of. Yet, Cas apparently trusted him enough for this. Despite all the violence, all the ways Dean had been cruel and an asshole in the past, Cas still let him hold his soul in his palms.
intimately, for all this was their first encounter. “Now heaven is working to stop the breaking of the seals, yet they are being broken anyway. You fear that the angels are not telling you everything.” She should stop there. She had to stop there. If she said anything else, it would be too much. It would be something she could not come back from.
“Not that I’m complaining, but any idea why I can suddenly hear you?” Dean chuckled, “pretty sure the last time you tried speaking to me without a body, my eardrums almost exploded.” Back then, he hadn’t even
The only non-alcoholic brew Dean would deem good was coffee – and thankfully the Swedish coffee tasted fucking amazing – so hearing that the mulled wine was 'good' didn't convince him in the slightest. Still, he took a mouthful and tried not to grimace. “Uh, it has a unique taste.”
How could Dean deny him? He sounded so earnest. “I feel amazing.” Except the pulsating feeling in his forehead and the light that was harsh against his eyes. Slowly, he peeled his eyes open. He didn't miss Cas' alarmed expression.
“Alright, this can't be too tricky. Hammer and nails. I was thinking we'll place it over there? Then half of the run will be in the shade. Chicks dig that.” Dean chuckles to himself.
Jesus Christ. For a few seconds, Dean is confused but Castiel pushes his thigh up against Dean's leg again.
You know, ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you.”
The three of them shower quickly before promptly falling back into bed. But this time their talk is quiet and hushed until silence finally falls over the room as sleep pulls them under.
He had to be on another plane because his words sounded distant but sadly for her, not distant enough.
Turning his attention to Lorp again, her dark feathers... shake. There's a ripple across her body, like she's ruffling her feathers, only, it's... wrong. It looks like a glitch in the damn Matrix. Her feathers elongate and turn even darker as they start to liquefy. The ripples move up her neck in an all too familiar way. He would recognize this anywhere.
Billie frowned and turned to look at Jared. “I don't know. The line between worlds is solid. He shouldn't be here.”
Dean pushes away the bowl with his foot, ignores the clattering of the crystal as it lands on the floor. Blowing out the candles, he grabs his jacket. The blood is caked and dried but Dean doesn't care. He splays his hand over the dead and bloody imprint of Cas' hand and tries to picture how it was back then.
Dean shrugs and takes another bite of his sandwich. He looks at the sunrays and how the darkness of night slowly submits to the rising sun. “I dunno. It's kinda cool watching the sunrise.” He takes Cas' hand in his.
Sam smiled. “I'm not done yet.” He grabbed a hex bag and tossed it to the ground. “Facti lapis!” The bag puffed out in a cloud of purple smoke. When it cleared both Simon and Jared were standing still, unmoving.
Dean lowers the heat on the sauce. “Exactly, paradise. The potatoes are already on boil and the sauce will be done soon. You can make the salad and maybe whip up a desert. I'm just gonna fry this piece of steak. Are your taste buds ready to be in Heaven?”
“A couple hours. Then we apply the finish and after twenty-four hours we're good to go. Tomorrow evening, the floors will be primed and ready for Winchester feet. In theory.”
The urge to move, to be free from the bindings have left Dean. Instead, a curious sensation fills him, a sense of peace and calm but it's quickly filled with a need. A
The following days Dean becomes obsessed with Castiel. He starts jogging – and anyone that knows Dean knows that he never jogs – anything to have an excuse to walk past Castiel's house and catch a glimpse of him.
Jack pipes up from the kitchen. “Cas said it's okay to be a slow learner. That's part of the human experience.”
Cas digs a finger inside his waistband. “You won't need these,” he says casually and pulls. The waistband snaps as if it was made of paper.
Lorp and Henley walk up to it and cackle among themselves but there's no chicken race to see who's first.
“You were exotic before, a human specimen that Cas found curious, intriguing. He was an angel, so he didn't know any better. The
Dean nods. “Yeah, but I also said lovingly. You're not trying to kill the yolks, just beat them around a tad. Like this.” He grabs the bowl and starts whisking. “See, easy hand, I'm relaxed, I'm taking care of the yolks and see how they blend with the sugar.”
He looked around but it seemed everyone in his presence had heard it. Jael stared at nothing, an expression of shock on her face but Metatron smiled strangely, a pleased expression upon him.
The black cassock looks perfect on him, accentuating his waist and broad chest. The thirty buttons – Dean swallows, he knows very well there are thirty buttons– are neatly buttoned. Dean doesn't look down, doesn't even breathe the thought that comes to him despite everything – the cassock looks like a skirt. He's not insane enough to tell that to the priest's face again. He glimpses a hint of the silver crucifix hanging around the priest's neck and looks down again. He fastens his gaze on the black fascia around the priest's waist instead but it hangs down right over his groin.
“Don't be so dramatic,” Cas whispers as he pulls Dean's blindfold off and kisses his temple. He leans back, a pleased smile on his face. “But wouldn't a death by dick be special? It's my dick after all.”
Cas' fingers gently touched Dean's eyelids as they fluttered close. “These eyes are perfect. I've loved the green of your eyes since the first time I saw you in that dumpster.”
Another step forward. Water rising up to his shins. It should have been cold. He should have been worried that it wasn't.
Dean nods and smiles faintly. “I would've done the same, Cas. In a heartbeat. But man, you could've had me all this time, you stubborn son-of-a-bitch.”
“I mean, I could…” he mused, to the air. “I should go and wake up Lanky and Cranky. Let them know I’m back in town. Alive. In their casa.”
Jael nodded as if strengthened by his words. “Of course, Kadriel. Our mission goes above everything else. Dean Winchester is but a pawn.”
The archangel stood perfectly immobile as he observed, taking in the decorations that had been procured and displayed around the bunker. He was rarely completely still, and the sensation bothered him enough that he began fidgeting just for something to do; flipping his golden kazoo back and forth over his fingers, in and out, a little party trick of motion. He quieted his singing, though no one could perceive him anyway. Not even Castiel, unless he wished it. He just stood, taking in the seasonal transformation that had overtaken the bunker since he’d last seen it.
“Oh, trust me, I'm not worried about your brain leaking out. That would be quite impossible. Cas grabbed him again. “Come along.”
Dean gathered himself and left the bathroom as well. He wandered out of Macy’s and into the corridors of the mall, watching as much happier people moved about and did their shopping. Somehow, the cavernous mall left him feeling utterly claustrophobic.
“I think we should stop playing now.” Sam looked at Dean and then shook his head slightly as he glanced over at Cas.
Cas walks up to Dean from behind and puts his arms around him. “They can also symbolize innocence and purity but I don't think those describe you very well, so I omitted those.”
Ignoring the humor in Cas' voice, Dean turns Mr. Plant so the sunlight hits his leaves better. “It's a feeling. You just know.”
He looks down at Henley who has taken cue from Lorp and also fallen asleep. “Mm, so that's your advice. Sleep on it? Trust me, I tried that. Didn't work. But thanks for listening, appreciate it guys – uh, girls.”
“I think we need a fence around your garden, Cas. Or you'll wake up one day to these mother cluckers ravaging your plants, seeds, whatever.”
“Dude, too much info. Anyways. It's... it means a lot to see you guys like this. Dean. Cas. Jack and Eileen.”
Castiel just moved after him, like they were engaged in some bizarre dance. “I've been dreaming about this ever since I first laid hands on you. You gripped my heart tightly, Dean and pulled me down straight into perdition.”
Moving over to the corner of the room, he surveyed the small pile of Christmas stockings he had obtained. It had been easy enough to work out from the presents he’d found how many he needed to provide, and the names of the recipients. Most were familiar, some not.
At the bar, he spots a guy nursing a drink. He waits a few minutes but the man appears to be alone. Dean walks over and sits down.
“Good to know. I'll think about recommendations... And if you want to take another coffee some other time, let me know.”
Sweat covers his entire body and Dean tenses up with each sound he hears Castiel make. So attuned is he to Castiel, that it's like they have this ethereal but profound bond, invisible for everyone else but their eyes.
Dean and Cas wake up on a Sunday, after being up way too late and decide that the best way to spend the day, is not getting up at all.
Dean blinks at the weight around his neck. Castiel's put a rosary around him. The beads are heavy and the weight of the cross pulls him down. “I'm just giving you a heads up, I don't know any prayers, Cas– um, Father.”
Cas stands up, drawing Dean's attention. “So before we head out, Sam and I have a gift for you. Well, for us?”
Dean looks up at the reredos but only sees glimpses of them. The statue of Jesus is out of his sight. The God he needs is inside him. Literally.
Dean laughs but it turns into a grimace. His throat burns but that odd feeling of relaxation and calm grows stronger. It's not his body that is affected – the heavy push down from the tentacles on his wrists and ankles and the lump in his throat as he swallows is still there – but he feels calmer. The sharp edges of his fear have been smoothed down.
A prompt from @Shorty 559. Hope you like it! They sent me a poem and wanted me to write something inspired by it.
Dean and Cas have finished their sandwiches and their coffee a while ago. Still, it's early. Dean can tell by the chill that lingers in the air, although it's definitely warmer now. He can also tell due to the fact that they're the only ones out there, even though it's Saturday.
Dean closes his eyes, mouth hanging open. He’s just grinding and grinding like a dog in heat, his underwear sliding off more and more. He’s almost completely exposed now. Sure, his underwear’s restraining him but also, it’s so fucking hot. Fuck. Fuck.
Was it five, ten minutes already? It’s like it’s speeding up each time, as if Cas can’t wait to see him from every angle.
And Confused, heh heh. Another great movie for straight dudes who enjoy men in tight bellbottoms. They should watch that one next.
Hell, they don’t know him. They don’t know how unflinchingly he cuts his hand to draw a blood sigil when he rebels against heaven. They don’t know how crooked his tie hangs while he’s battling demons. They don’t know how pleased his smile grows when Dean explains human crap while they watch movies.
What if, like, The French Mistake was more like a documentary? Dean is real, he feels so real to him, sometimes it doesn’t even feel like acting when he’s on set.
Like Dean wouldn’t recognise the dude just because he cosplayed Spielberg. He curls his fingers around the collar of Gabriel’s dark green shirt.
now. No angel. Apart from a strange Enochian tattoo, warding him against other angels, Dean also notices a little anti possession symbol on Cas’ side. It doesn’t seem to be a tattoo though, just drawn on.
Some are more detailed than others, but it’s always undeniably Dean. With colored shade, just in pencil but somehow evoking different textures and movements.
Right around four in the morning is when the single man tears start over Dean. It’s unfair! It’s just so unfair. The fans are gonna kill him. Jensen, not Dean. Dean’s already gonna be dead.
Dean carefully reaches for the corner of the pink blanket to pull it tighter over the both of them. He wouldn’t want Cas to get cold.
Dean nearly falls out of his chair, and to his mortification, he drops his pencil and every single one of his blank (and staying that way!) papers on the floor. He can only just save the Bible from crashing. When he looks up, holy shit, Cas is staring right at him.
Right. Dean turns off the bathroom light, and lies down next to Cas, flat on his back. He stares at the ceiling, its popcorn texture slowly revealing itself as his eyes adjust to the darkness. There’s some light still trickling in, through the cracks of the door leading to the parking lot. There must be a pretty strong street light there.
Dean closes his eyes. Focuses on just the concept of physical shape, the outline of his own body as if it’s carved out by the air itself. Like a statue emerging from a block of marble.
He hopes nothing else will start growing along with it, because there is definitely something in Cas’ eyes that flashes with a certain degree of heat.
It feels goddamn impossible to find Cas in this place. But from Jack and Cas’ previous experiences in the Emtpy, it sounds like things find you, not the other way around. Dean tries to trust that process, and focuses on thinking about Cas.
Now Cas only wields the back end of the pencil, a piece of pink rubber eraser, lightly rubbing Dean’s dick up and down.
Cas’s shoulders sagged. What did he expect? Apart from, you know, eternal death by black goo. Happiness isn’t in the having, he reminded himself. It’s in just saying it. And now it was said, the answer certainly shouldn’t matter to him! So what if Dean drove away? He hoped Dean and his car would be very happy together.
Small mercy: no eye contact. He’s just stuck looking at his knee for what? Five minutes? Ten? Cas never specified. How long does he want to look at Dean?
