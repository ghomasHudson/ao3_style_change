“Crowley is not gonna be happy with you, Winchester.” A demon at the table called, but he was starting to stand as well.  Dean rolled his eyes, but before he could respond another voice called out.
Sam was drunk. Very drunk, and had no business being on this hunt by himself. But being drunk was the only way Sam could stand himself at the moment. Despite the hard time Sam had always given Dean about his drinking, he really saw the appeal now.
“Ok you know what, enough!  Here Sam these ones are all yours.”  Dean said pushing the offending pie-like things in front of the empty chair next to him.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a good week.  This is a rather short chapter and not too much action, but important for the story.
Dean’s eyes widened in surprise and then narrowed.  “What I had to.”  Dean snapped right back.  What right did Cas have to get angry at him after leaving him?  Dean jerked his arm away.  “Why do you even care?”
Dean’s stomach sank and he started to shake in fear and regret.  Dean once again has made a momentaneously bad decision, but this time the consequences were too big.  “What does that mean, what’s going to happen to me?”
At the continued silence and side glances between the two, Crowley, frustrated, slammed his fist on the desk.
Dean just nodded because he knew Death had been around since the beginning and was older than God probably but definitely older than Cas and all the angels.
Dean couldn’t stop the scream as he felt like he was being split in two.  “Ohh the little bitch finally squeals.”  Drake said sounding delighted as he roughly thrust his fingers in and out, adding a third way too soon.  Dean could feel blood dripping from him and he screamed again at a rough twist.  Dean pulled down hard and his right arm started to burn again.  He thought he felt a give in the rope but he wasn’t sure if he was imagining things.
Dean steadily worked his way through the bottle as the night went on, and the bar slowly emptied of all its human customers. The demons were now drunk enough to make a couple of them foolishly brave enough to approach Dean.
His smile fled when he caught the look on John’s face before the hunter turned and stalked out of the room.  Crowley wanted nothing more than to tear that bastard apart and subject him to the most severe torture a tortured soul is tortured with in hell, and Crowley once again cursed Dean for always putting that brat of a Moose before everything.
His really large and hard cock was leaking precum at the tip showing Dean just how much his angel had enjoyed exploring Dean’s body.  Dean, when able to have a coherent thought, felt bad that he was the only one receiving pleasure.  But apparently, his angel had also enjoyed it… very much so, judging by his straining erection and the amount of precum leaking out of him.
If you’d asked him before this, he would’ve said there was no way in hell he could come untouched, but now?  Now it’s as though those words have unlocked a door, and Cas’s voice has barely echoed into silence before Dean’s cock jerks hard.  His back arches into the angel and his cock pulses, painting stripes across both of their bellies as he wails his climax.  His ass clenches tightly around Cas as he comes, and that’s all it takes to compel the angel to follow him over the edge.  Dean feels the hot wetness fill him, and the sensation is strange and new but not unpleasant or disgusting, because it’s Cas.
“I am going to walk away now.  I will not leave the garage.  I am not leaving you.  I will be right back.”
“Yeah, I just—one of my arms is kind of scrunched up and I don’t think I can back out the way I planned on.  If one of you can get ahold of my shoulders you can probably pull me out, though.”
he needed).  Just like that, with the permission, with the concern, as the gentleness and adoration of those bright blue eyes washed over him, Dean
Dean blinked a couple times in surprise, so startled by what he saw that he allowed Cas to take his hand and pull him, unresisting, into the room.  The door clicked shut behind him quietly, leaving Dean to appreciate the full picture.
“Finally caught up, then?” Cas inquired casually, over the sound of a cap clicking followed by the wet slide of flesh on flesh.
“While that is materially true,” Cas acknowledges, “I think we both know that it is unlikely at this point.  I am not, however, above igniting the fires of hell in certain portions of your anatomy.”
His shoulders and upper back were sore, but not unpleasantly so.  He sat with the feeling for a moment and decided he was okay with it.
Dean is a bundle of nerves despite his best efforts to keep himself calm, and nobody comes around with dinner.  So little attention is paid to him that he actually manages to grab a canteen and shuffle to the latrine and back on his own with nothing more than a lackluster threat aimed in his direction from a passing Novak about how many ways he’ll regret it if he so much as thinks of trying to run for it (his quick retort in which he demands they give him lessons on how to run in shackles if they’re so sure it can be done earns a single-finger salute and nothing further—the entire camp really must have a hell of a hangover) and in the end, moonrise bears not Michael but still another pleasant surprise.
say to each other, but it would require bridging a gap far broader than the hundreds of miles of wilderness that surround them.
“An excellent question,” he agrees, and then sets about his task.  He works methodically, starting on Dean’s left cheek and covering it in smacks from the top of his ass to his upper thigh before switching over to the right, this time starting from the bottom and working up.  After the first round, he stops to nudge Dean’s legs apart enough to part his cheeks slightly, until his hole is just barely visible through the satin.  Then he delivers three sharp slaps in a row, directly across the center of Dean’s ass.  This, finally, is enough to earn a yelp where there were only little gasps before now, and Cas smiles, rubbing his hand over the nicely pinkening curves.  He’s just opening his mouth to make an observation about how nice the pink of the panties looks overlaying the pink of Dean’s ass when from outside the bedroom, a softly plaintive mewl sounds.  Cas snorts as Dean’s bare back starts to shake a little with suppressed snickers.
massages when the mood struck), then relinquished its hold with the light slide of a single finger down the line of Dean’s spine until it hit his shirt collar.
“Good boy,” he picks up smoothly, “getting dressed so quickly.  Now get your ass in the car, and don’t dawdle or I’ll figure I didn’t spank you enough and bend you over the hood.”
Still looming above Dean, the nearest lamp was just behind Cas, silhouetting him in a soft glow.  Dean caught in his breath, transported by the beauty of his angel, the perfect lines of his body, its curves and concavities.  Gazing down at him, Cas took a spare moment to slick himself up, quickly but thoroughly, and then he sank to his knees.  He bent forward until he hovered just above Dean, whose hips canted upward, raising his ass an inch off the floor in offering, in plea.  Cas took what was offered and answered the plea.
“You can’t seriously be blamin’ a man who’s spent the past three days trussed up like a chicken for whatever the hell’s been going on around here the past 48 hours,” Dean says, squinting incredulously and pretending for all the world like his heart ain’t pounding at the mere suggestion that Michael suspects the last two nights are anything but coincidence.
Dean obeyed immediately.  What had started out as reflexive morning wood was rather more than that, now, and he shifted just slightly to feel the friction of the sheets against his cock.  Cas huffed out a silent laugh that said he knew exactly what Dean was doing, but he let it slide.
Cas took the key from him and turned it over.  “Is this where she was getting all her magic from?”  The angel asked handing the key to Sam to look at.
“Really?”  Dean asked with an almost little boy voice so surprised that someone like Death would be willing to help him, and once again Death cursed God for all the heartache this human has had to live through that caused him to think so little of himself.  He would never understand it.
Dean thought for a second about coming clean to Sam, but Sam had been so happy to see John. Sam had come to terms with how John had raised them since his death, especially after finding out that he would never have had a normal life no matter what John did or didn’t do differently.  Dean couldn’t take that away from Sam. He had protected and shielded Sam his whole life from the kind of person John really was and he wasn’t going to quit doing that now. Dean would just have to cope. Besides, he was all grown up now, things were sure to be different.
So trigger warnings up the wazoo with this chapter.  You can actually just skip it and read the summary at the end if you want.  Sorry guys this is a heavy chapter.
Dean looked again at Crowley relieved that he was okay.  The past couple of months Dean had spent a lot of time with Crowley and he was surprised to admit that he enjoyed himself.  The demon kept Dean from falling into a black hole of despair at losing Cas and his family and Dean smirked to himself remembering a very drunk Crowley going on about the Misadventures of Crowley and Squirrel.
“Dean, stop moving.  I am going to heal you, and then I am going to clean you up.”  Cas said.  The gleam in his eye intensified and Dean's heart started to race.  “But I will do it my way and you will lie there and not.  Move.”  Cas commanded.
Okay I know, I'm ducking the rotten tomatoes I'm sure you want to throw at me, but I needed Dean to be alone as he was in season 9 to go off with Crowley.
I do hope you liked the love scene though.   Apparently I can't really write fluffy smut very well.  I wanted it to be an epic love scene but had a really hard time getting that across.
“Dad, I’m warning you.  I’m not a scared kid anymore.  Cut it out.” Dean snarled and taking John by surprise he twisted out of his grasp and stepped away from John.  “Don’t touch me again.” Dean warned.
“Get this through your head, Dean.” Dream Guy said as he lifted up slightly. He manhandled Dean around so he landed on his stomach.
Drake sighed and tucked himself away with a look of pure pleasure on his face from the look of despair and hurt Dean couldn’t hide any longer.  Drake pushed a short dildo through the ring gag and locked it into place and then patted Dean’s head like a dog.  He then yanked the rope back up so that Dean was hanging off the ground by a few inches.  His dislocated shoulder had pain shooting down his arm for a second and then that arm went numb while the other side almost dislocated as all of Dean’s weight pulled at his bleeding torn up wrists.
Dean snorted at Cas telling him it was just a dream, because he knew it wasn’t. Dean’s cheek and wrists throbbed in pain, and his ass felt like it was on fire. Dean would blame the artificial lust on the fact that he snuggled deeper into Cas’ arms and allowed himself to relax, but then, Dean was always a master at lying to himself.
And, yep, another awkward silence fell between them yet again. Dean wasn’t sure if he should leave and come back, or what.
“Yes you Samuel.”  Death said and he caught Dean’s gaze and winked before turning back to Sam who was caught between being pleased and nervous.
Dean dressed in his jeans and a T-shirt after taking a shower.  Cas tilted his head for a second, clearly confused as to why Dean would bother dressing when they’d been naked for a while now.  But then noticing Dean's serious look, Cas nodded.  After snapping his fingers so that he was fully dressed, Cas sat up.  Dean sat on the bed so that they were facing each other, their poses so similar to the day they agreed to move their relationship forward.
Now it was Dean's turn to chuckle.  “Will that always happen?''  Dean asked, waving a hand around the room to indicate the absence of light and — oh, hello, the TV and picture frames decorating the room were also cracked.
Hi everyone, I hope you all are well.  This was originally part of one long chapter but I decided to split it up because major things happen in both of them and I didn't want one to overshadow the other.  Therefore, they are on the shorter side but don't worry there is still a lot that happens.
Sam only just caught himself from grinning at the look of brotherly indignation and worry in Dean’s eyes, knowing it wouldn’t go over very well right now and would probably be misinterpreted since things were so bad between them. But damn, if it was so good to see that familiar look on his big brother’s face. So Sam just shrugged, Dean stared at him for a few moments before the blank look fell down on Dean’s face again. This time, Dean shrugged back, picking up his beer and visibly turning his attention away from Sam.
On another note, I also really struggled with Dean caving too so0n with John, first with saying please and then with the who owns you after being so amazingly strong against all of John's torture.  But when it comes to Sam Dean never hesitates and John was very convincing and I tried to convey how none of that mattered when it came to saving everyone.  Hopefully that came across and it wasn't too much of an about face.
“Get the fuck off!” Dean cried, trying to buck him off but he only received a chuckle in response. Grabbing Dean’s hair again, Dream Guy crashed his lips onto Dean’s.
He was the fucking King of Hell. Dean should be hanging from chains, his back bloody from a whip, or sating Crowley’s rage in bed crying beneath him, but no. Crowley sends him on a timeout. He had to get Dean away from him before he lost control.
“As much as I would love to finally feel those cock sucking lips around me, I don’t trust you.”  Drake said and Dean panting through the incredible pain squinted in confusion.  Unfortunately he figured out what Drake meant a few seconds later when the demon pulled his head back roughly from behind and before Dean could even think of clamping his mouth shut he inserted a ring gag.
Dean looked into his angel's eyes and saw the truth of his words.  Maybe it was the beat down, or the emotional upheaval of their talk, or just everything that had happened recently, but Dean was done.  Done hiding, done avoiding, and done denying what he wanted.  With his heart almost beating out of his chest in fear and anticipation, Dean cleared his throat and licked his lips.
So good news, here is the second part of the split chapter.  I figured I would post them both on the same night because.... bad news this has one hell of a cliffhanger, probably the worst one yet.  See end for notes.
Dean took a long shower and exited the bathroom to find Crowley in the bedroom with a murderous look on his face. Oh shit.
I have to take another opportunity to thank my beta AnotherWorld3111.  At this point in the story I was kind of stuck.  I had written the last two chapters and did not know where to go to get there and with a few awesome suggestions from her I was able to get back on track.  She is amazingly talented and I was very lucky to have her work with me on this story.
Crowley saw Dean’s eyes roll back as he lost consciousness, his heart only sluggishly beating.  Pushing aside the panic he was feeling at the sight of Dean, Crowley growled.  “That flying pigeon better be there.”  And snapped them back to the motel.   Minutes later that felt like weeks Dean was healed up and five sets of eyes watched anxiously as Dean’s long lashes fluttered and a collective gasp of relief was heard when he opened those beautiful green eyes.
Dean then smirked and continued. “You told me to take care of the problem, and I took care of it… My King.”  Dean snarled. His eyes widened as red crept into Crowley’s eyes from rage.
“Do you want to?” Dean tried again. He didn’t really understand why, but... he really, really, didn’t want to have to kill Cain.
I know everyone was upset that Crowley and Benny let John go and didn't say anything.  Crowley stopped Benny because he knew it is what Dean would have wanted and Benny realized that too so don't be too hard on them.  Its also not how I want Sam to find out.
“I would very much like that Dean.”  Cas replied, staring deep into Dean’s eyes.  Cas was sitting almost mirror image to Dean on the bed so that their bent legs touched.
I need to figure out how to put a picture inside the next chapter so hopefully it will go up tonight.  If not then tomorrow for sure.
“Okay geez fine.”  Dean said taking the flannel off and turning to grab another T-shirt from his bag; a scratchy too tight one but whatever.  Dean heard Sam break out into peals of laughter and Dean spun around.  “What Sam?”
“As I was saying.”  Death continued.  “Since God left I have not really had the occasion to…”  and Death paused trying to find the words.  Sighing Death continued.  “I found myself lonely.  I have been alive for a very very long time Dean.”  Death murmured.
Dean tried to evade it but he didn’t move fast enough. He felt his arms being jerked behind him, and the gold strand wrapped tightly around his arms from wrist to forearm.
It always amazed Dean that Cas had never delved into those memories but he was so thankful he didn’t dwell on it too much.  He had asked Cas once about whether he knew about Dean’s childhood but Cas just said those memories were locked up tight in Dean’s head and were before hell so Castiel had left them intact but alone when he rebuilt Dean.
“See, now that's what we mean.” They said in unison. Dean quietly snorted, remembering and missing the way Sam and he used to do that.
Cas put a hand on Sam’s shoulder to calm him down.  “Dean, even if you’ve talked to him it doesn’t mean he didn’t have anything to do with it.  We still need to ask or he might know something.”
Shoving the urge to scream and shake his brother at his stupidity, Sam forced his answer to come out as calm as he didn’t feel. “I never contacted Amelia.” He watched as Dean looked up with genuine surprise in his eyes.
“You raise a valid point, linguistically if nothing else,” Cas conceded, before squeezing Dean somewhere that made him bite back what would definitely not have been a squeak.
The stagecoach is still half a mile away, and Benny and the rest of the boys with it.  It’s just Garth and Dean against Michael fucking Novak and his crew.  Michael shoots off another round and Dean curses as Garth shouts in pain.  It’s not likely to be a fatal wound—Jeb didn’t even have time to make a sound, and Garth is cursing up a storm, or as close to actual cursing as he ever gets.  Despite whatever damage he’s taken, Garth’s shooting right back at the oncoming Novaks—behind Michael is a form that might be Uriel, and when Dean whips his head around he sees Bart and Malachi, closing in from the opposite direction.  A few others hang further back, motionless, seemingly trained on where the stagecoach will appear presently.  Dean makes the calculations in a fraction of a second, recognizing that while the Winchester crew laid an ambush for the coach, the accursed Novak gang laid an ambush for the Winchesters, and now they’re surrounded with back-up still a good two minutes out.
Dean’s already battered heart cracked in half at the sight.  He knew exactly what he needed to say, but found himself speaking before he quite knew exactly
That manages to grab Dean’s attention away from the burgers, which he has been advancing on as cautiously as if they’re going to grow tiny legs and flee from him.  “I’m sorry,
It wasn’t that he didn’t know where Cas was coming from.  If by some strange miracle he’d actually agreed to the forty that Dean had proposed, Dean would’ve had a hell of a time dialing it back.  Moving forward, if they were going to be trying more intense things, and if Cas was going to be trusting him, Dean would need to be honest about what he thought he could handle.  The breath that Dean had intended upon releasing was still caught in his lungs, and he took a moment to force himself to let it out, slowly and steadily, before responding.
No, it was definitely a simple pad of paper, followed by a nondescript pen.  Cas set them down decisively in front of Dean, then settled back into his seat, eyes not straying from Dean’s face for a moment.  “Mr. Winchester, you will sit in that chair and write ‘I will remain on task and not distract the other students in class’ 500 times before you leave here today, and every day for the next week.”
Forget it.  That did it.  Dean’s hole spasmed around Cas as the climax pulsed through him, come spilling out of him and soaking into his bedsheets.  Cas held himself back, driving Dean through the climax and into oversensitivity, refusing to give in to his own pleasure until he could hear Dean’s whimpers go breathy.  Then he, too, followed Dean over the edge.
The fingers that were twined with Cas’s tightened precipitously.  Cas returned the squeeze unhesitatingly in the seconds before the tongue licked a slow, wet strip from the base of Dean’s cock to the tip.  He went from half hard to painfully erect in what had to be nanoseconds, biting into his lower lip nearly hard enough to draw blood to force himself to silence.  The tongue jabbed into the slit at the head of his cock and one of Dean’s legs jerked a little, involuntarily, causing Sam to again glance at him before looking back to the screen.  Damn.  He’d need to exert better self-control if he didn’t want to end up with a situation on his hands (one that would be a much larger pain in the ass, and feel a lot worse, than the situation currently on his dick).
Cas’s skin actually blanched pale at the question, and there was something about the way his eyes slid to one side briefly, as if he was too ashamed to meet Dean’s gaze—something that Dean couldn’t quite pinpoint.  He didn’t have the chance to figure out what it meant because a second later the angel’s eyes were once again locked with his, danger oozing from every pore as he rose from his chair and stalked forward several steps.  He stopped only when he was looming over Dean, who actually had to force himself not to shrink away.
“My point.”  Benny said.  “Is that you have nothing to be jealous of kid.  Dean’s my brother.”  Benny said with an almost challenge to his voice and Sam once again clenched his fists.  “But there isn’t anybody in the world that means more to him than you, not even that angel he finally got his head out of his ass about.   So cool it.”  Benny said slapping down on his shoulder as he exited the elevator that finally arrived on their floor.  "Dean’s got more than enough love to go around, you here.”  Benny said.
Dean sighed and went to help his father up, who had fallen hard to the ground with Crowley no longer pinning him to the wall.
Ignoring their outraged looks, Dean sighed and pulled out a treat.  He took a bite and moaned at the taste.  Dean smiled at the look of lust on Cas’ face from the noise and he slowly licked the sugar from his lips watching as Cas’ eyes followed the movement and dilated, but then Dean froze when he saw the same look of lust flare across his father’s face.  Swallowing what now felt like a lump of flour Dean put the bag aside, preparing himself for the fallout.
Dean still looked hesitant, but then nodded, waving away the phone. Who really cared at this point if he got locked up again? Crowley was still going to be able to get him. He was anxious, but not about being held at the bunker — just about why Sam was acting this way, and the thought of seeing Cas again.
So how to you all like the BAMF Cas in this chapter?  I hope this fully redeems him in people's eyes.  The visit to Red kind of came about with editing but I was really happy with how it turned out.
Death tapped his cane and two chairs appeared.  “Sit down Dean.”  Death said.  Once seated the horseman looked more steady.
A few hours later Dean patted his full stomach leaning heavily against Cas in his post food coma haze.  Crowley was sprawled on the cough with one leg up, a half filled glass in his hands and sugar still dusting his lips.  Sam and Benny were in a deep discussion about something or another, and Dean was glad Sam seemed more comfortable around everyone, especially Benny who had teased Sam a few times and Sam had just laughed it off instead of getting offended.  Maybe there was hope for those two yet Dean thought.
Dean’s face paled a bit, and he put a hand up against where his mortal wound had been. He was about a half a second from leaving, but Sam put a hand on his shoulder, gently guiding him into a chair. “Relax, Dean. We’re just going to talk, okay? I promise.” Sam said, handing him a beer.
“Yes really.”  Death repeated his voice full of fondness.  “Now go and, what is it you are fond of saying?”  Death pondered for a moment and then smiled.  “Kick it in the ass!”
Dean was feeling weird.  Ever since his cuddling the other night — and geez Dean cannot believe he reached out to Crowley like that but now — Crowley had been acting weird.  He was colder and more professional with Dean and it was throwing Dean off. Crowley was usually the affectionate one, always wanting some kind of contact. Figures, though. Dean had a reason for closing himself off and not allowing himself to count on people, especially when it came to his feelings. Yet once again he acted the fool and was now getting slapped back for it.
Death nodded looking sad but resigned.  They both stood and the chairs disappeared and Dean shivered again at the emptiness of this place.
As always thank you for the kudos and comments.  Special thanks to sleepyvixen and Tak for checking on me during my absence.  I sincerely appreciated that.
Dream guy took another step closer to Dean. Lightening fast, he grabbed a hold of the hair on the back of Dean’s head and yanked it back. “Who’s going to stop me?” He said, bringing his other hand up and caressing Dean’s check. His eyes darkened in lust. “My beautiful hunter,” he purred, brushing his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip before abruptly letting Dean go. Dean stumbled before regaining his balance. The bastard was playing with Dean, and it simultaneously scared him and made him furious.
“I would imagine so yes.”  Death responded with a slight tilt of his head as he peered more closely at Dean.
Sam stared at his brother. He was scared, Sam would admit, at how Dean had pounded the other two men until they were only inches away from being splattered all over the cement. His brother was completely lost in the violence of beating them, and it took way too long for them to pull him back this time.
“Hello, Dean.”  Cas’ voice was somewhat unsure, but full of emotion. Dean’s eyes snapped up to Cas and he gasped when he could easily see the blatant look of longing and love in the angel’s blue eyes.
Dean heard John leave the room in a huff and glanced at Crowley who had a murderous look on his face and frowned.
Death sighed.  “I know Dean, I’m sorry but I knew about your dad and knew you would be busy so I just…”
Ignoring the familiar argument Sam barreled into the room and plopped his notes and the book right on the pool table which caused Dean to frown but then Crowley read the text and his eyes widened in shock.  All three looked up and stared at Dean.
Sam gave John a big smile before he explained who Abaddon was and about the war in hell over the throne.
Sam had spent the first few months numb and in shock after the vampire massacre, which Sam had taken to calling it. The events of the past few months were weighing him down. Sam was appalled at his actions, at how he had treated Dean, how he had ignored and pushed him away over and over while he let his anger get the best of him time and time again. How he locked his brother up in the bunker after he had been held prisoner by Abaddon. What the hell was he thinking, Sam asked himself over and over again. And on top of all of that, what does Dean go and do? He goes and makes another deal in order to save Sam’s life.
“No, I don’t think so, my beautiful hunter.” The guy grabbed Dean’s throat and squeezed, stopping his call for help. He leaned in, plastering his body against Dean’s. “Just relax. I’ll make you feel so good.” The guy  murmured as his lips closed over Dean’s. Sweetness flooded Dean’s mouth and he tried to pull away and stop it because whatever it was, it always made Dean horny and out of control.
“So Sam is out doing interviews while you’re lounging around?”  John asked, disappointment and a hint of disgust in his tone.
By the time Sam had seen enough for his brain to put together that this was real, and had actually happened, and somehow Dean had suffered through this his whole childhood while Sam had remained blissfully unaware, several minutes had passed. Sam braced himself to confront his brother as too many questions needed to be answered.
“Oh well, my bad.” Dean said carelessly. He flung the demon's body away and stepped toward the other demon who pulled his own knife out. What a joke. It only took a few seconds before Dean had killed him too.
“Yes we need to talk about that Dean.  You do find a way to get yourself into cosmic-sized messes don’t you.”  Death said, his tone serious.
Sam gave Dean that pitying look he used when he was feeling superior and laughed.  “Really Dean, I know he’s helped you in the past but do you really think he would contact you if he was up to something.”  Sam said with a chuckle and John snorted in amusement.
Once again thank you so very much for all the kudos and comments.  They have motivated me to write two more chapters, out of order unfortunately, but at least they are getting written.
Dean shivered at the lust dripping from John’s words and also at the thought of being trained by John again.
Cain looked surprised at the question and stopped moving, his stare even more focused now on Dean. “How are you still human?” Cain asked suspiciously, looking up and down Dean’s body. He paused when his gaze fell on the band. “And so in control?”
John sneered as he watched the monsters all fuss around Dean who was lying on the bed, his top half in the vampire’s lap who was sitting up with his back against the headboard.  After the demon and vampire brought Dean back John was horrified at how badly Dean had been hurt.  “What an amateur that demon must have been.” John thought, but he admitted to himself that he was scared.  He didn’t want to lose Dean now that he was back.  He might have miscalculated in his plan to get Dean to come around and behave again, but John always learned from his mistakes.  He was thankful for the first time that the angel was around when he quickly healed Dean.
Dean tried to squirm away but he was held too tightly, and pressed against the wall he had no leverage, so Dean brought up his knee as hard as he could right into Dream guy’s groin.
Now Dream Guy’s face clouded over with anger. His eyes flashed purple. “You are my possession.” He said, and flung Dean against the bookcase. “You are mine, and I will have you back.” He said. Again, his eyes flashed and Dean was thrown onto the couch and pinned by his power.
Triggers only include John thinking about what he wants to do Dean and a small reference to past abuse.
He dozed for what felt like a few hours.  When he woke up, he was still nice and warm, all wrapped up in his angel's arms.  Cas seemed to be mediating, or maybe he was somehow asleep, because his eyes were closed and his body relaxed.
Now on a darker note, I'm not gonna lie, this chapter is going to be brutal.  I've been pretty nervous about it and changed it a few times but this is what wanted to come out.  You can skip the chapter entirely and I will put a summary at the end if you don't want to read all the hurt.  I also put ******* at the beginning and end of the part with sexual stuff if you wanted to skip just that.
Dean laid back on the bed and squeezed his eyes shut. Tears gathered and fell down the sides of his face. Dean had never felt more alone. Crowley may have brought him home, but he felt betrayed by his punishment. Even though he knew deep down he defied Crowley, and even though Crowley was back to his caring and attentive self, Dean now knew it could change in an instant. He no longer felt safe and secure here.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a good week.  First I just want to continue to thank you all for leaving kudos and comments.  We are over 550 now and edging closer to 575 kudos.  I really can't express how happy that makes me.
“Cute.”  Drake said as he jerked Dean’s head up by grabbing the hair at the back of his neck.  “I remember how well you took pain Dean.”  Drake said his mouth right next to Dean’s.  “I also remember how you screamed and begged when Alistair had his way with you.”
Dean actually chuckled, which caused the angel to frown harder.  “You do realize, I am the absolute last person you should be taking cues from on how to handle human emotions, right?”
After spending a couple of days with Cain helping him find the perfect balance between power and calm, Dean arrived back at the beach house exhausted. Cain had zapped him all over the world looking for monsters to test his newfound control on. Dean smiled at the memory because he had thoroughly enjoyed himself. It was nice to hunt with a partner even though Dean had to let Cain do all the killing, and for some reason he felt really connected to Cain. He had scoffed at Cain when he said that the day they met, but Dean saw it now, felt it now, and he was glad he could give Cain some peace.
“No!” He tried to scream, but it was all muffled. And with the Mark bound, Dean felt the unwanted sensation flow through his body, heat and lust flaring in his brain. The disgust he felt at himself was muted even as he bucked his hips up against Dream Guy’s, his body no longer his own all the while his mind screaming and pleading to stop.
Adrenaline was spiking and Sam’s fight response was on full alert and he swung into the room with his gun raised and came to an abrupt stop and his mind struggled to catch up with what he was seeing.  Dean was standing at the table and there were pieces of some half chewed green and dough stuff in front of him and Dean’s face was scrunched up in disgust, which would be almost comical if Sam hadn’t been about to shoot whoever caused his brother to shout like that.  The table was littered with little calzone like pie things and Death was sitting at the table looking at his brother with fondness.
Dean crawled forward a little bit and finally was able to grab the water gun and he flopped on his back moaning in pain.  His left arm was still useless but Dean raised the water gun with his right hand and his arm shaking he started shooting heads or faces of the demons attacking Crowley.  Crowley saw what Dean was doing and grinned as the demons started to scream and burn from the water and just like that Crowley was in control.
“Sorry, sorry.” He said. “Just, don’t go, okay? Can we just sit, and talk — or just sit?” Sam asked, giving Dean the puppiest of all puppy eyes.
Sam and Cas exchanged looks again, and pain and longing sliced through Dean again. He never imagined himself being an outsider around Sam, or even Cas for that matter. It hurt, but he had no one else to blame but himself. Dean again thought of how coming here was a bad idea. He really was a glutton for punishment.
There's also a little bit about Alistair in there because I'm sorry I don't believe John was with him for 100 years and didn't break so this is one of my takes on it.
Dean just stared at Sam for a few moments, trying to figure out what was going on. Not really knowing what to say, he merely nodded and sat back down on the crates. Trying to be subtle, Dean squeezed his arm. The Mark was burning him just for being near Sam.
Dean gasped and felt down his body, feeling the blanket still tied to him like a toga and his whole body started shaking. Despite the fact that Crowley had imprisoned him in this room of stone, Dean welcomed the warmth when Crowley pulled Dean into his arms and started to stroke his back murmuring softly until Dean finally stopped shaking.
“Why?” Dean repeated. He was flabbergasted that Sam would even have to ask. “Why — cause you’re my brother,” Dean said. “Yeah, I know you don’t think that way anymore, but I do, I always will. I know you hate that, but I can’t change it, Sammy. I just can’t.”
Dean smiled as Cas tilted his head in confusion at the A to be B statement but it seemed like he figured it out and Dean was rewarded with a huge gummy smile that made Dean’s heart flutter.
“Are they okay?”  Dean asked with wide fearful eyes.  “Please tell me my dad didn’t kill them all?”  Tears started to trickle down Dean’s cheeks at the thought.
Hi sorry for the delay again, I could not figure out which chapter should come next so I decided to post them both tonight.  The next chapter will probably be a little over a week from now, but I do have it written.  I am working now on the final one to two chapters.
Dean continued to toss and turn wishing Cas was here. Since purgatory Cas was around most nights and Dean always slept better with the angel next to him or even just in the room.  After finally falling asleep in the early morning hours, Dean was awoken by the sound of the Impala rumbling to life.
“We should summon him.”  Sam said ignoring Dean, and at John’s raised eyebrows Sam added.  “We’ve done it before.”
Cas stepped as close to the barrier as possible. “I love you too, my Everything.” Cas said with a smile, his eyes burning with love and devotion.
Non-con touching and kissing, then Oberon and Dean fight and Dean is hurt badly,  Oberon violently rapes Dean.
Dean's eyes rolled in the back of his head when the moist heat of the cloth was suddenly replaced with the moist heat of Cas' mouth as, oh fuck, the angel swallowed him whole in one go.  Dean was so on edge from the little healing kisses of grace, he didn't even get to warn Cas before he was having one of the most intense orgasms of his life.
“It’s fine, Dean. Thank you again, for helping me.” Cas said, his blue eyes piercing through Dean’s skull.
Crowley stared at Dean for a minute or two. “Okay. I’ll give you that one, Dean. However, I sincerely doubt you were in mortal danger. Let me ask you this? Is Cain dead?” Crowley snarled, wrapping a hand around Dean’s throat.
Dean pictured his room in his head. The last time he was in there was when Sam kicked him out. Hopelessness, loss, and utter despair. The bare room that used to be saturated with Dean’s personality, his first real room since he was four, that’s what it represented for Dean now.
“Are you guys okay?”  Dean asked trying to look at everyone at the same time his gaze lingering on Sam.
Death cleared his throat uncomfortably and then replied.  “Uh nowhere important, I have to go.”  Death started to say when the female voice chimed in.
I actually wrote the last part of the chapter at the beginning of the story and couldn't wait to be able to post it because let's face it, even though you'all are probably really upset with me right now, its a great cliffhanger but I found myself really nervous now that it was time to post hence why its late.  Please go easy on me.
Crowley didn't know how he ended up here, surrounded by a vampire, an angel who most days he wanted to pluck clean and deep fry and two hunters - one of which had wormed his way past his defenses to become the single most important person in Crowley’s life.
Then Death shocked himself and Dean by pulling the boy into a hug.  It was a strange sensation, probably the first hug he had ever had, but he found he liked it.
“Of course.  I’ve missed you too, Dean, My Everything.”  Cas said and Dean flushed harder at the pet name.
“You know Dean never stopped talking about you in purgatory.  I’m pretty sure I know everything there is to know about you — from what diapers you wore to when you had your first kiss.”  Benny drawled out.
“Cas, are you doing okay? How’s the grace holding up?” Cas tilted his head at Dean’s question and smiled.
Dean jerked awake at the sound of someone in the room with him. Dream guy stood in front of a bookcase, running his long fingers down the spines of several books, humming as he read some of the titles.
Hi everyone, just one chapter this week but its on the long side.  Its the one I was having a heard time picturing where to put but I think this is a good place.  I think it will be a surprise to everyone and I hope you all like it.
“We don’t know.”  Dean admitted buckling his belt and feeling a little better now that he was fully dressed, although the glaring look of hate and violence in John’s eyes made Dean’s stomach twist in a knot.
Dean was shaking slightly but he was proud of himself for standing up to John.  He nodded back and went to hand John his journal.
“Come on Dean. Why are you getting so upset?  We've been good together — great, in fact! They'll write songs about us, graphic novels;
“This key opens the door to the Men of Letters’ bunker, it contains every object, scroll, and spell collected by the order for over a thousand years under one roof.  Death explained and Dean’s eyes widened in wonder and Crowley sat up at the mention of the Men of Letters.
I should have mentioned this on the last chapter, but the Mark affects Dean differently than in the show and Crowley does not know as much as he did about it either.  I changed it to fit the story, which will become more clear in the later chapters.
And last, I've had a crappy week so I have not gotten much writing done, but I do have next week's chapter done and hopefully I can figure out the rest of the other chapters so as not to cause a delay in posting.
Dean asks Hannah for help when Sam and Cas are kidnapped by Kate.  She says yes only if Dean agrees to stays away from Cas.
Good news, I wrote the epilogue this week and I'm pretty happy with it, bad news, I still have scattered chapters to write, some pretty important, but all the kudos and comments help me so much.  It was actually the response to Crowley and Dean that prompted me to rewrite and add onto the an upcoming Cas/Dean chapter.   So thank you again for all the support!
The guy just smirked and walked slowly over to Dean, reaching out and untying the knot of the toga like covering Dean had made from the blanket. He pulled it away, letting it fall to the floor. Dean shuddered in disgust as his gaze, still faintly purple, traveled over every inch of Dean’s body. Feeling exposed and vulnerable, Dean tugged uselessly against the bands before opening his mouth to call out to Crowley.
Dean felt a weird buzz through his veins and his arm felt blazing hot.  Dean glanced at the Mark on his arm that Crowley had manipulated him into getting.  Cain had warned it came with a great burden, but Dean didn’t care as long as he would be able to kill Abaddon.  He wasn’t even pissed that Crowley had set the whole thing up knowing beforehand that Dean would have to take on the Mark in order to use the blade.  It didn’t matter.  So what if this turned out to be a bad thing for Dean.  What did Dean have to live for now anyway?  His dad was alive and still tormenting him; he had no Cas; and once again he had no Sam.  Even though Dean didn’t care at this point what happened to him, he sure as fuck didn’t want to give this two-bit wanabee any satisfaction.  So Dean refused to show fear, tried to hide his pain and refused to give Drake the screams he wanted so badly to hear.
This chapter was really long so I split it in two.  I will try to post the other half tonight or tomorrow.
Thankfully, Cas seemed to be getting himself under control with somewhat greater speed than Dean was.  The angel also had the advantage of still being almost completely dressed.  He had removed neither his shirt nor his pants, although the latter had been unfastened and hung low around his hips, his softened cock bobbing absurdly overtop of them.  Cas appeared to realize this in the moment after Dean did, because he reached down and made short work of tucking himself away and refastening his pants, leaving himself on much more even footing with Sam.  There was something about being naked while someone else was fully clothed that ratcheted one’s sense of vulnerability up past a ten.  This, Dean knew, was why Cas enjoyed doing it so much—stripping Dean bare and then spanking him or fucking him (or, more likely, both) while he remained fully clothed.  It was a clear, outward representation of the power imbalance, and between he and Cas, it was sexy as hell.
Sam yelled as metal joined the fingers. The room started to spin. He thought he heard an “I got it,” but Sam was already tumbling into blackness.
“Why try to ingrain yourself back into your brother’s life when you will be leaving it soon?” Dream guy took a step closer to Dean.
Sorry I left another cliffhanger, but it wasn't a totally unexpected one.  Get ready for some hurt Dean in the next chapter.
“Dean.  I thought by now the appeal would be lost.  I mean you’re all grown up.” John said as he rubbed himself against Dean.  “But boy, you’re even more beautiful than before. This is your own fault tempting me like this.”  John murmured his breath hot against Dean’s skin.
I had originally planned on John's death to be the last chapter and then going straight to the epilogue, but I had asked my then beta if I should add more chapters dealing with the aftermath and she agreed it was important.  So basically I had nothing plotted in my head to write and it has taken a while to figure it out.
Before John could say anything else, Dean walked back into the room and stopped when all three occupants swung around to look at him with various expressions.  John was furious and Dean could almost feel the promise of violence coming off him in waves, Cas looked like an angry cat and Sam looked curious and a little ashamed.  Dean sighed figuring Sam must have told John a few things.
Dean smiled lighting up his beautiful face and despite Dean choosing to leave him, Death felt a warmth spread through him at the sight.  This boy was so special.  Feeling himself close to the last of his energy and ability to stay here, Death twisted his ring.
Sam’s defenses went up and he was ready to throw back a scathing retort to mask his disbelief, but then he took a deep breath, because yes, he did learn something from all the shit that went down, and so he reined in the anger.
Dean struggled and pulled and he felt a red hot surge of power building up mostly centered on his arm and with a push from the power and a hard pull from Dean’s right arm he felt the rope give and Dean crashed to the floor his scream of pain muffled.  Shocked but not wasting a second Dean tried to get up but he was too injured and had lost too much blood and every movement he made caused agony throughout his body.
“Benny!” Dean tried to call out but with the gag it just sounded like benmmhuy.  Then all the demons rushed into the room.  Four of them tore Benny off Drake and started fighting him, and Dean saw one demon smoke out as his throat was ripped apart by the vampire.
So over 3000 words of bromance here, it really got away from me a bit, but wasn't Crowley such a sweetheart forcing Dean to face his feelings?  As you can tell the pool playing part was taken from Mother's Little Helper, and I was thinking about Dean taking the crowbar to the Impala in season 2 when I wrote him trashing the room.
Hi everyone, sorry for the delay (I know I say that every week), but I lost power for 2 days and got behind in everything.  I did get some more writing done, and I'm pretty happy with what came out in the first draft.  There are just a couple of pivotal chapters to write and I will be done and can concentrate on tweaking what's left.
to tell you everything, but just…  You’re actually here and I missed you so much, Cas.”  Dean whispered, his green eyes full of love and longing.  “Let me enjoy it for a minute?”  Dean asked, his cheeks and ears pinked up with a blush.
On that note, I answered comments tonight and something went a bit wonky on me twice, so hopefully everyone gets a response if not I am very sorry.  I really don't know what happened.
The loud sound caused Dean to jump in surprise and tense, his eyes going hard and predatory for just a second before he blinked and his eyes returned to normal —  well normal for Dean nowadays.  The Mark was getting harder and harder for Dean to control and it was taking a toll on him.  While he was thinner than usual, he was almost solid muscle now; there were clear tension lines across his face; and his hands were almost always shaking slightly.
Every tenth spank or so, Cas deliberately let his hand crack firmly against the base of the plug, fucking it into Dean and jarring it against his prostate.  Before too long, his hips were shifting restlessly, rubbing his cock against Baby’s smooth finish.  Cas put a stop to this with a firm hand on his far hip and a single, admonishing word.
Dean won’t know it for another hour, until he finally drags himself out of the shower and down to the library to avail himself of every drop of whiskey in the wet bar, but Lucifer took Cas's clothes with him when he went.
The ruler fell once more, just beside the first stroke, and Dean hissed out a breath, then another as it fell again, twice in quick succession.
Welp, that did it.  He was pretty sure he could actually melt into a liquid and sink through the bed in pleased embarrassment at this point, his entire face flaming as he fought not to squirm.  Rather than looking away, though, out of respect for what it meant to him to hear that from Cas, he met the angel’s eyes and smiled.  “Well, I don’t ever tell you how proud
Yeah, Dean has to acknowledge that there’s something to be said for Cas’s hands-on strategies.  What he doesn’t have to do is march his way to the firing squad
“Sure thing,” Sam tells him, standing once more to his full height, “I gotta go make another phone call, but—”
puns, all of which were truly terrible.  He ‘accidentally’ dropped a book under the table while Sam and Cas were doing some research (he made sure it wasn’t one of the old and priceless ones; he’s not
By the time Cas pauses for his first break, Dean is breathing hard, hands clenched into fists beside his head, feet still planted on the cardboard floor only by virtue of a lifetime of building his pain tolerance.
His knees were imprinted with the pattern of the tile below him but he didn’t register it, didn’t register the water pounding down on his head that mingled with the tears streaming down his face.  On his knees, bent almost double in agony too intense to be physical, shaking violently with the force of his weeping, back bowed under the weight of the truth that he tried so hard not to see, the reality of himself, of his place in the world.
Ridiculous or no, Dean doesn’t slow his stride until he reaches the laundry room, and then he only narrowly manages to skid to a halt (fucking socks on smooth concrete floors) before the wall would’ve more abruptly arrested his momentum.  He’s breathing hard, and is somewhat less than surprised when that unnaturally echoing voice pipes up after what felt like a long break.
“Yessir,” Castiel says, and his face is still as blank as ever when Michael sends him off toward the paddock to mount his steed.  No doubt he’s exhausted after being on watch all night, but if he wanted to spend the day in his bed, he shouldn’t have gotten overly friendly with the prisoner.  Least he can do is make himself useful in a way that counts in payment for yet another sin.
“All what?” Cas said, eyes widening in a parody of that familiar cluelessness that was often not feigned.
Sam lifted his eyes toward Dean but not his head.  After a second, the kid spat the roll of bandages out of his mouth carelessly, letting them drop to the floor.
Somehow, Dean couldn’t say how, Cas must realize this, because he pants out words that make Dean groan, long and low and loud.  The filthy demands are choppy, the force of Cas’s thrusts breaking up his words a little, and damned if that isn’t one of the hottest things Dean’s ever heard.
“The overarching spanking is not, but that does not mean that I do not expect you to hold to certain standards of etiquette.  Interrupting is, of course, rude, and you do know how I feel about rudeness,” he told Dean easily, then went on.  “I do this because it pleases me.  That does not mean you have no control over exactly how easy or hard it is.”
He held a cellophane packet of peanut butter crackers in one hand and a bag of Milano cookies in the other.  Either was a decent snack option, and neither was what had brought Dean up short.  No, what stopped Dean in his tracks was the expression on the angel’s face, a look of focus so intense and dedicated that he might have been selecting which wire to cut on a bomb that was bare seconds from exploding and taking all of Kansas with it rather than between high-fat, low-nutrition munchie options for movie watching.  He looked, Dean thought, as though he had never been tasked with a more important decision, as if Dean’s current and future happiness depended upon the angel making the correct call.
“Much better.  Now, then.  If you continue to dither, I may simply decide that it is clear you are not motivated enough to complete your punishment with any expedience and remove the choice altogether.  You have your instructions.”
The sound of the familiar gravel made Dean’s innards clench just this side of painfully in some mingling of relief, longing, and misery that there was probably a German word for, but English was totally unequal to the task of truly describing.
“What do you think you’ll do with yourself?” Dean asks a couple hours after Uriel’s nude performance.  He knows he’s dozed some more because he can just see the dark grey of impending dawn tingeing the sky in the east.
Dean raises both brows as Sam reaches into his pocket, then lifts up what he pulled out for Dean’s perusal.  Dean’s just opened his mouth to ask what the hell it is when Sam speaks again.
“Beautiful,” Michael says, a hint of reverence to his tone, and stays deep as he traces the path of one tear with a single finger.  Then he draws back and begins a steady rhythm, pressing in and out of Dean, fucking his throat with the kind of relish that has bile creeping up Castiel’s gullet.  He has no idea how Dean has managed not to throw up.  Sheer force of will, probably, and the terror of what Michael will do to him if he does.
gonna deal with it,” Dean assures him, “there just really hasn’t been time yet, and it’s a…delicate issue.”
Dean wrestled with himself in silence for a few seconds.  The angel was not wrong, that sometimes binding his hands was a kindness, preventing him from having to focus on keeping his hands away from his-ass-turned-Cas’s-canvas.  The problem was, if he wanted it, Dean generally had to ask for it.  Explicitly.
His eyelids had drifted back to half-mast, and he forced them to blink open again as something came toward him.  Suddenly the bottle of juice was hovering a few inches in front of his face, a straw sticking out of it.  But it was at the wrong angle.  He couldn’t get to the straw.
More than one man has wandered past the tree Dean finds himself chained to, and from the relieved sighs and sounds of liquid hitting dirt and scrub brush, it’s not hard for him to suss out why.  Just his fucking luck they decide to chain him up within hearing (and sniffing, more’s the pity) distance of their hastily picked latrine.  Most of the passersby barely spare him a glance, which is just fine by Dean.  Those who’ve taken greater note of him have delivered, at last count, three separate kicks—which ain’t ideal, but he’ll take it over the four globs of spittle, at least one of which harbored sticky, foul-smelling tobacco juice (He reminds himself to thank his father for tanning the skin half off his rear the first time he found Dean with a wad of chewing tobacco parked inside his cheek.  The state of the tobacco-spitter’s remaining teeth was almost bad enough to inspire nightmares).   Anyway, the point is, most of the men slouching by ain’t showing much interest in Dean, much less any real curiosity.
Dean and Cas goggled silently at each other, then turned to stare at the door as Sam sketched them a salute.  Dean suddenly remembered that same door, hanging slightly ajar as he returned from the bathroom, something he had attributed to Cas at the time.  He should’ve known better.
When Sam started pumping his fist in the air triumphantly, Dean was sure for half a second that it had to be a trap, because he’d just about concluded that the game actually
Chapter-Specific tags and warnings can be found at the end of the chapter, along with an author's note.
“Okay, if one of you doesn’t cut out the googly eyes and tell me what—“ he paused, suddenly registering why the unchanged room nevertheless looked different.  “Hey, does it seem a little brighter in here to—oh.
Cas didn’t bother gracing this with a response, merely helped Dean to rise and spotted him until it became clear that his legs were more than steady enough to hold him, albeit pleasantly sore from being taut with tension and pinned down during the spanking.  Rather than discarding them, Dean went ahead and pulled his panties back up, hissing out a breath as even the soft satin set the abused flesh ablaze.  Cas totally failed to hide his smile of satisfaction, and Dean made a face at him, which caused the angel to feint as if he was going to give Dean’s ass a swat.  Dean jumped about a foot, which in turn made Cas grin with wicked mischief, and it was with somewhat bad grace that Dean accepted his help in swiping the sticky, drying come off his stomach with his already ruined long-sleeved tee.  The angel then crossed the room to grab Dean’s discarded flannel pants, opening them up and letting Dean stabilize himself with hands on his shoulders as he stepped into them.
There was nothing like waking up still wrapped in the same arms that soothed him to sleep to make Dean feel loved, particularly since he knew that Cas had no need to sleep.  The angel had not only lain awake, but done so without the benefit of a book or movie or other entertainment, his attention focused intently and entirely on cradling Dean close to him.
Making a beeline (or the closest thing he could manage to a beeline in his current state) for the pills, Dean grabbed them and tossed them back with a swallow of water.  Only when the cold liquid slid down his throat did he realize how desperately thirsty he had been, and he went ahead and kept drinking until he’d put away well over half of the glass.  He emerged, panting slightly but able to feel his brain start to sharpen a little.  Dehydration certainly hadn’t helped either his fuzziness or the headache, and with the combination of ibuprofen and water, he was really hoping he might start to feel like a person again at some point in the near future.
have to know the contents of the schedule in question.  I am happy to provide one for Sam without giving you the same courtesy.”
“Dad, I can’t believe it!” Sam said as he grabbed John in a hug. John hugged him back but over Sam’s shoulder was watching with narrowed eyes as Dean faltered in his shock and wobbled but found himself caught by Cas who wrapped an arm around Dean’s waist from behind to steady him and give him comfort.
“You dare say another’s name.” Dream Guy said, all humor and smugness gone in a beat and replaced by utter fury.
After a few beats of heavy silence which had Dean starting to tense expecting to be hit, John just set his coffee cup down and asked “Do you still have my journal?”
“Mother fucking asshole.”  He tried to swear but it just came out all muffled and Drake laughed.   Dean couldn’t stop the tears from falling as Drake pulled out his cock and shoved it down Dean’s throat.  Dean struggled but he was held too firmly and could only take it when Drake started to roughly fuck his face.
Quickly catching on Sam agreed he could eat and went to grab his jacket when Sam paused and his lips quirked up in a smile.  “Dean what are you wearing?”  He asked laughter in his voice.
Hi Happy Sunday, hope you all had a good weekend.  I have a nice long chapter for you because there was not really a good place to split it.  Nothing too triggering in this chapter.
Metatron had managed to get a hold of Chuck’s unpublished works which were current until just a year ago. He needed to find a way to get rid of Dean. Dean was becoming too big of a problem, getting in the way, capturing Gadreel, and it was just dumb luck that Metatron was able to rescue him in time. Metatron knew that killing Dean would only turn him into a full blown knight and he would then be a bigger threat. Dean was the only player left on the board that could cause Metatron problems when he followed through with his plan to take humanity. He wanted his name being prayed to, churches built to honor him, and everything else that went along with being the new god, but he had to get rid of Dean first for any of that to happen.
Hi here is the second part.  No cliffhanger this time, I didn't want to do that to you all twice in a row.
and there were cool hands on him, cupping his face, gripping his shoulders, wrapping tightly around him, drawing him in close to the impossibly solid, intimately familiar chest.  Cas was dripping, sopping, water streaming down over him, soaking through the sweatpants and long-sleeved tee, but he didn’t seem to care.  Dean let it happen, let himself be dragged against Cas’s chest, drawn into his lap, cradled like a baby, like someone precious—and it wasn’t true, none of it was true, he wasn’t any of the things that Cas’s strong arms seemed to suggest, but he was too weak to do what he ought to and draw away.  Much too weak to reject the offer of comfort, even if he was woefully unworthy of it.  His thoughts continued to spiral out of control, dragging him through the mud of his own self-hatred, threatening to pull him under for good and drown him in their quicksand.
They both stood gaping at one another in motionless silence for another few moments before Cas suddenly startled and shook himself hard, reminding Dean of nothing so much as a dog that is astonished to discover itself soaking wet.  He reached a hand out to Dean, who took it readily, allowing himself to be pulled back into the classroom.
Sam, meanwhile, had paused to consider this before shrugging.  “Fine, but one more word about my singing and I’ve got nothing more to say to either of you, got it?”
They continued to kiss long after the motion of their hips had stilled, feeling no urgency to move, no urgency to allow Cas’s softening cock to slide out of Dean.
“No, Cas, it’s fine, don’t waste your strength” Sam grunted, “it’ll sort itself out in a day or so, always does.  Just, do you think you guys can get me to my room?”
Dean suspected that Cas’s eagerness had less to do with excitement over playing the actual game and more to do with the fact that the sooner they got started, the sooner they’d finish and he would have a chance to get Dean alone.  Dean, who had learned his lesson with the bulb shattering and had no intention of instigating further than he already had, finished pouring Sam’s glass of whiskey and trekked over to the table to pass it off to him.  Sam nodded his thanks, setting his fork down on the plate with a decisive clink, suggesting that he was actually done this time.
any more than strictly necessary these days.  It’s too raw.  He ends up wanting to claw his way out of his own skin, and it’s not like a whole lot of thinking has gotten him any closer to an actual solution.  Of course, it’s harder not to think of the angel while Dean watches a lean body topped with mussed dark hair, bent over an equally firm form crowned in dirty blonde.  The first man’s hips are working fast and hard as he buries his cock in the blonde, who is on hands and knees on what looks like cheap industrial carpeting.  The guy who’s getting fucked—the bottom, it’s called, not that Dean made it a point to find out once upon a time—actually has freckles, now that Dean looks.  It’s not that the dude isn’t good looking, he is, Dean’s attention has just been more intently focused on the messy dark hair, strong jawline, and taut abdomen of the guy who’s topping.  Something about the man, especially when he drops his head so that his facial features aren’t clearly visible, sets Dean’s heart to racing.
“Jesus Christ!” Cas yelps in surprise, still closer to asleep than awake despite the fact that his heart is pounding.  “Not now, Etienne, Daddy’s sleeping.  I had a late night,” he rasps, gently pushing the cat off of him and settling back down.  The clock on Dean’s bedside table says it’s just past 9:30, which means he’s been asleep less than six hours.  Not even close to enough, especially not on a weekend.
Right before he turned the corner to head to his room, the angel’s voice chased him down the hallway.  “Oh, and Dean?”  He pivoted to face Cas once more, hoping that his expression would serve as inquiry enough.  It apparently did, because Cas went on, imparting one last piece of information.  “You will call me Mr. Novak when you arrive.  Do you understand?”
In different circumstances, Dean might have put on a good show, unzipped Cas’s pants with his teeth, that sort of thing.  This wasn’t that kind of day, though.  The two may not have been mutually exclusive, but Dean was aiming for perfect clarity between them that he was not performing, he was
Somehow Cas seems to know—he always knows—and the hand that’s been smacking him suddenly worms its way between Dean and the bed, squeezing the base of his cock.  The climax abates, and Dean groans in frustration.  “C’mon,” he whines, “you fuckin’—“
Dean gets a running start and manages to parkour his way to the top of the wall via the corner.  He’s scrambling over the edge as the angel’s voice chases him, “Dean!  I
“Good call.  Eventually we’ll have to leave the room if only to feed him.  And me, for that matter, but it can wait for the moment.  Wanna get me more coffee while I pee and we can reconvene in here in five?”
They fell seemingly at random, peppering his ass and thighs, even warming up his inner thighs, leaving Dean to wonder helplessly whether Cas planned on taking the belt to that sensitive flesh, or was simply taking the time to really enjoy the warm-up.
He wasn’t quite sure what that indicated, but again, his uncertainty didn’t bother him any, and he let it slide away in favor of processing the sensations on a more primal level.
“Please what, Dean?”  His voice is so calm, as if he were reading a magazine and not fucking Dean open on his frigid fingers
He doesn’t even manage to finish the thought before Cas is chuckling.  “Not there,” he says, reaching out a hand toward Dean.
Still, the idea of voluntarily surrendering to his fate is unthinkable.  He simply doesn’t have it in him.
“I was thinking,” Cas mused, continuing to slide in and out of Dean at the same steady, too-slow pace, “you smoked the Damiana and didn’t even tell me about it.  Seems a terrible waste, not to take advantage of an aphrodisiac.”  Something about Dean’s silence must have given him away, because Cas let out a slightly surprised laugh.  “Is that so?  You
All his focus is on the warm arms wrapping around him, drawing him close to a firm chest.  He tips his head up a little, blindly seeking, and Cas immediately intuits what he’s looking for and gives it to him, pressing their lips together in a soft but still searing kiss.
Several hours pass.  The activity doesn’t slow, and nobody will pause long enough to tell Dean what the hell is going on.  He gets told to shut the fuck up a time or two, and once, after he makes enough of a ruckus for long enough, somebody throws a canteen that still has a bit of water in it at his head (thankfully, cause he was right thirsty), but that’s as much information as he has.
Cas poured him a glass of juice and insisted that he drink the whole thing, hovering over him like a hawk-eyed mother hen.  While he was generally quite good at aftercare, he tended to adopt a persona that Dean could only describe as ferociously nurturing.  A decade ago he’d have said those two things were incompatible, but Cas had a particular skill for effortlessly merging apparently disparate things with mystifying ease.
What he did register was that it wasn’t the bad kind of weeping.  He was falling to pieces, yes, but in a way that felt…well, good wasn’t the right word.  Cathartic, maybe.  Safe.
Whatever the case, he doesn’t exactly have the luxury of philosophizing about it at the moment, given the fact that Cas’s best instrument of torture—that deft
He’s breathing hard by the time the fall of the whip draws the first split in Dean’s skin, blood beading upward generously at the intersection of two weals.
It seemed there was some mercy in Cas, or maybe his perfect self-control could only last so long, because with a deep grunt, the angel gave Dean what he’d been begging for for what felt like hours.  His hips drew back once more, but this time they returned with such force that the cracking sound of flesh on flesh echoed through the garage.
“We—“ Cas broke off, as if groping for words, and Dean picked the thread back up, finishing the thought without a moment’s hesitation.
Cas relinquishes his death-grip, legs dangling ridiculously in the moments before Sam carefully sets him on the ground next to Stuart and Dean.
Sam stands, and Dean actually has to close his eyes for a second.  He’s not afraid of heights, per se, but suddenly having your legs flailing the equivalent of hundreds of feet off the ground would be unnerving to anybody.  When he gets himself under control enough to open his eyes again, the first thing he sees is a very smug-looking Cas, comfortably seated cross-legged on Sam’s open palm.  Dean flips him the bird, still smarting at the indignity of being toted around like this, but reconsiders at the warning look that crosses the angel’s face.  Dropping his hand, he turns his face back up to Sam, trying to ignore the stomach-roiling sight of the ground rushing by far below his dangling feet.
“No,” he murmurs, not at all surprised to find his cheeks wet and his voice a little thick with tears, “no, stay, please, stay.”
