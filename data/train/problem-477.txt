“I can’t wait to put that mouth to better use,” he said, voice coming out in a moan.
“Now do some math,
Anywho,
Sometimes, I really wish I was English so I could write the mannerisms more naturally. But eh, what do you expect?
I did NOT mean for this to take this long! m(__ __)m
There was shuffling, followed by groaning and another thud.
against it.
It was awkward to watch Sherlock struggle into the bathroom, but John did not interfere, allowing Sherlock the privacy he knew the young man was desperately craving. It pained him to watch Sherlock walk in an obvious attempt to ignore the discomfort it placed on his stitched arches, but when he made it to the door and closed himself in, John found himself releasing an audible sigh. He sat on the edge of the bed, eyes trailing from the door to his mobile on the chair.
The final bit of blood-stained plastic was removed from the room, leaving Sherlock with nothing more than the haunting reminder and heavy scent of putrid blood. The fever that had been slowing inching its way through his body had finally taken hold and he found himself cold, his innards throbbing between dull and sharp pains.
John knitted his brows together. “For what?” He waited a moment for Sherlock to get his bearings straight, but his partner stayed silent. “Sherlock?” Still, he garnered no response, the younger man’s breaths becoming even once more as he slipped back into unconsciousness. John sighed and moved his hand from Sherlock’s hand to his head. “We’ll talk about apologies later.” With that said, he turned back to his laptop, his expression a mix of confusion and content as he refreshed the page, it updating to a new headline about another arrest.
Sherlock shook his head. “That woman, I think—” he was cut off, his head falling forward while his body began going limp.
But it was foregone as he felt the tip of the man’s prick against his rectal cavity, pressing in slowly. After the sound of the man spitting, the man pushed into him, groaning as he did. Despite knowing tensing would only make it hurt, his sphincter contracted against his will, causing him to release a low cry.
“What have they found?” Mycroft asked, not bothering to look at the man he spoke to.
“Doctor Watson?” Mycroft’s voice broke through.
There was a muffled groan as the Irishman inserted his partially flaccid length into Sherlock, whose body tensed. It took him a minute, but once he was fully in, he placed his left hand on Sherlock’s back and grabbed his hip with the right. Another moment passed before warm liquid began filling him and, though he knew better, the detective tried to pull against the chain holding his wrists to the pipe. The moment he did, pain seared down his back and he stopped, shaking.
Still in the City of Westminster.
It had been over twelve hours since Sherlock had been abducted and, while the only video was of him being waterboarded, the chances of that having been the only thing they had put Sherlock through did not favour well. After having read what the cartel was known for, and been told more by Mycroft while they were en route to the scene, John’s mind flipped over itself on scenarios his mate had most likely already been subjected to. It had him wondering if Lestrade had been made aware of the group’s involvement.
Where were they going and why?
After the next few steps, the crunching of glass ceased and he was left with nothing more than the metal grating. At the end, he noticed another door to his right. Its wood was painted black. Along with the colouring and rotting wood, it would have been easily missed had it not have been searched for. While curiosity wondered where it led, he ignored it, his will drawing him to a dimly-lit entryway only a few steps further.
Before she spoke, her eyes darted to both of them, her expression becoming curious and concerned. When Lestrade finally looked up to her, his eyes red and brows furrowed upwards, her demeanour tensed, demanding to know what had gone on.
“Would’ve drawn too much attention, most likely,” was the response. “Now, unless they had another mode of transportation, it’s unlikely they would have drowned the van and carried a fully-grown man to wherever they’re situated.”
Mycroft could no longer hold back the emotions coursing through him and he found himself restraining the man by his neck, fingers digging into the larynx and veins.
Sensing another presence, Dreln looked up from his mobile, staring up at John. His expression was curious, as though he was trying to understand where he recognized John. At the same moment, John’s initial reaction was to bring the man to knees, forcing him to make amends with everything he had done to his partner. Just as quickly, the understanding that causing such a commotion would draw the attention of the man upstairs.
Even with all the information against the group, knowing what they were capable of and willing to do, Mycroft had seemed disinterested in assisting his own brother. Now realizing that Mycroft had a way to contact the group all along, and decided to stand-by as his own flesh and blood was subjected to such events, any respect that John had built for the eldest Holmes flickered out.
Before anyone could react, both Lestrade and Donovan had their weapons drawn onto the male nurse – Frank – who immediately went onto the defence, his hands going up as he pressed himself against the wall John had once had him had him pinned.
“John, I know it’s asking a lot, but…they still believe you’re one of them, don’t they?”
With that, Sherlock waved him off. He and John made eye contact, whose eyebrows were furrowed upwards, though he would say nothing, backing his best mate. Still, there was a silent agreement between them, for John to watch him and ensure his health, as long as Lestrade held his end of the bargain of keeping John in the loop of the takedown of the Cielo Diablos. With another sigh, Lestrade was gone and the two of them were alone once more.
Perhaps Donovan was right.
“Oh, my god. You’re Sherlock Holmes,” she said, entire face beaming. Her breath appeared to catch in her throat and she moved to look at John. “And you’re Doctor Watson. I follow all the cases on your blog, and I think you two are fabulous.”
The sun had begun to rise by the time he was given a room with rounds from nurses every fifteen minutes.
I know this chapter was short! Please forgive me for that!
Wait.
His head was dropped and it hit the mattress with a padded thud, forcing the pressure back to his dislocated shoulder. His rectum contracted as the liquid dripped down his perineum to his scrotum. The light of the American’s mobile camera had become so frequent, he no longer grimaced at the photographs it took, so when the white flashed against the wall and piping, he paid it no heed, his eyes staring into nothingness at the wall to his left.
“You were the woman who ran into us,” he reiterated, clearly upset as Lestrade came up, curious to the commotion going on. Her nerves seemed wracked, her gaze adverted downwards. “Where’s Sherlock? What did you do?”
All formality left him and John came out with, “You mean where they violated and ejaculated inside my best friend? Yes, I’m fairly certain I caught that,” he snapped, his head jerking to the detective inspector, jaw clenching.
Sherlock was sitting on the bottom of the bathtub, pressed into the corner, his eyes distant and knees pulled up to his chest. His extremities were tinged with blue, but the man was not even shivering, sending alarm bells off in John’s head. Red marks were up and down his thighs and arms from what John recognised as coming from being scrubbed repeatedly with a washcloth, along with various welts that appeared to be burn marks. His suspicions were confirmed when he saw the cloth still being held in Sherlock’s hand.
“Someone called, saying they saw a dark van speeding off and an unconscious man on the ground,” Donovan responded. She waved over to the emergency medical responders, who were just getting out of the ambulance.
Once I really started, I couldn't stop.
It had been twenty-four hours since Lestrade had sent an update to John, which either meant they had managed to track down every member of the cartel or that they had decided to keep him out of the loop. While the former would have been more comforting, the latter was understandable.
That being said, I REALLY hope you all enjoy this chapter!
Shaking his thoughts, he returned his attention to the descending stairway.
It did not take long for the warm liquid of semen to fill his throat, which the man was sure to hold, forcing Sherlock to swallow, before pulling out and sitting back on his heels on Sherlock’s chest. He ran his hand through Sherlock’s matted hair, a strange smile gracing his features.
The police station bustled with chatter, typing and the ringing of phones. The bulletin for the woman John and Sherlock had seen the night prior was still out with no word, which was only growing concern from the few he held close. John had entered the station early that morning, having failed to sleep due to his growing concern. One of the officers who had been assigned to the case offered him coffee, which the doctor took willingly, craving any from of caffeine to keep him awake.
The certainty Sherlock spoke with, each phrase shot into John’s chest. Sherlock was a strong individual, one who had not been swayed by being an outcast his intellect had brought. Yet, here he was, apologizing for things John had never given a second thought. Even he knew the way Sherlock was around him was his own insecurity. His ability to read people had him called a “freak” most of his life; but for John, it was nothing but admiration. It was never something Sherlock needed to apologize over. Prior to meeting the young genius, all John had waited for was the embrace of Death. The fact that he had survived so much, it only proved to him that he still had a reason for being.
“No one’s saying you can’t, Sherlock. But you don’t have to.”
Heavy footsteps invaded his thoughts and he shut his eyes, expecting all that was to come.
There was an elongated pause before the younger man responded.
Hoping his idea would work, he shoved his hands into the front pocket of the sweatshirt, dropping his posture as he came in view of the entryway. He saw the broken wooden desk in the centre of the room, the large window on the left wall and doorway at the far end. Immediately, the Mexican man stood straight, his hand reaching behind him for what John suspected was a firearm. The suspicions were confirmed when he entered the room to come face-to-face with a loaded 9mm Glock.
On the screen was a list of addresses of buildings that contained sub-levels.
More questions swarmed around his head and John was trying to focus on the one that was the most important; however, given the situation, they all were of equal importance to him.
The air in the room suddenly changed.
As the man picked up the hacksaw, his eyes were on Dreln. “Awful lot of things you don’t like doing, it seems. All you do is text on your goddamn phone all day. Who, might I ask, is that bloody important?”
Adrenaline coursed through him as he came closer and the presence of pedestrians dwindled to naught. He was only a few feet from the address, outside of a building that was long rundown with boarded windows and neon graffiti, when he stopped short, scanning the exterior. Military training taking over, he made a note of the possible entry and exit points, including windows that could easily be broken through in case of an emergency escape.
of these videos I’ve sent. Holy shit, it’s still coming out. Ugh, that’s gross.” He inserted two of his fingers and pulled, stretching Sherlock and gaining a muffled shout as the a bit more trickled out. “Then again, maybe Mycroft’s getting off on all this. Fucking faggot.”
Also some Toni Braxton and Backstreet Boys ballads (yeah, I'm a 90s kid - fight me).
Sherlock had spent his first hours of arrival in surgery, having wooden splinters removed from his anal cavity. A colonoscopy uncovered multiple tears in his anus, which could only be repaired through time, along with antibiotics to avoid possible infections. They reset his shoulder and cast his knee and fractured wrist; the soles of both feet required stitches from where the glass had penetrated, as did his left hand. With Mycroft’s permission, they performed a rape kit and started Sherlock on the first round of medications to prevent possible sexually transmitted diseases. When the results came back, Lestrade would be the first to know to have any DNA evidence put through the system in hopes of finding anyone who aided in the abduction and violation of the young genius.
Mycroft paused before he nodded. Sherlock released a breath, as though laughing at the realisation his brother had not been passed the point of complete inebriation that night.
A Mycroft-centric chapter...not easy, lemme tell ya.
Having made eye contact, the inspector shifted uneasily.
“Where is he? What did you do to him?” John demanded, his voice tight and jaw tight.
He was hesitant to ascend the stairs, despite not knowing why.
With that said, he stood, embracing his best mate’s head and shoulders. He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head, shutting his eyes as he held him. He was not sure what to expect, but he did not care in that moment. He could not lose him; and if Sherlock did choose to pull away from him, he could at least rest in the fact he did the one thing he had been wanting to. However, when Sherlock’s arm reached up in a crude attempt to grab his sleeve in acceptance, John’s grip tightened and he found himself rocking the two of them back-and-forth.
I hope this chapter was worth the wait!
With her inflection of that trying to confirm a suspicion, they all were taken by surprise.
With his hand trailing the wall, he found the switch for the kitchen light. The light flickered, growing dim before turning off completely. He flipped the switch on and off to no avail, a sign escaping his throat. Going by outlines and memory, he made his way into the kitchen towards the refrigerator. Insomnia be damned: if he was made to be conscious, he would at least be productive. However, when he opened the fridge door, any thought of utilising his insomnia vanished when the bottom shelf lay barren. He very much doubted Mrs. Hudson to stomach discarding the upper half of a human thigh – especially one in the late stages of decomposition. Though he would not put it above his flatmate.
He was about to respond when the staff came in with a tray in hand. They crossed the room and set the tray on the rollaway table that sat at the foot of the bed. Pushing the table over the bed and to the patient’s lap, they lifted the lid. Instead of the sausage and eggs that permeated through the halls, the tray held a steamed banana, yogurt and two soft cooked eggs. Even John gave a look of sympathy as Sherlock stared down at the bland meal. The doctor thanked the staff as they left the room, the wheels of the trolley squeaking to the next room.
The information left John feeling numb.
Several police vehicles approached the outskirts of the building, their lights off as they pulled up in silence. Exiting a black car was Detective-Inspector Lestrade and Sergeant Donovan, meeting several officers around the side; others were moving around back so as not to draw any unwanted attention. Clearly on edge, Lestrade scanned the outskirts, as though waiting for another arrival. While he was on lookout, Donovan was giving the information to the officers who had been called last-minute to the address from their patrols around the city.
The only thing that John could think to do was the one thing he was most uncertain about.
“The hell you on about?” he asked in an annoyed manner, his posture mimicking his tone.
Even as his heart pounded in his ears and his focus was only on the man now on the floor, flanked by his apparent co-workers, John became acutely aware of the security staff holding him. As security started escorting him from the room, Lestrade and Donovan entered, both overwrought by confusion.
The chain that had once connected the shackles to the d-rings on the floor around the chair was now connected to the L-shaped bend of the pipes near the mattress, which was roughly three-feet from the floor. On the opposite end of the chain was Sherlock, who was facing the pipes with his hands restrained behind his back, keeping his upper body from the mattress and arms twisted at an odd angle as his knees dug into broken springs. The way he was chained, if he dropped his body, both shoulders would dislocate, forcing him to hold tension. The dislocated knee was bent awkwardly, causing a shooting pain any time he shifted even slightly or any form of pressure was placed upon it; but it was a pain he could easily block out.
The majority of messages were along the lines of cheating partners or spouses and asking for his assistance in proving their suspicions. They were deleted en masse.
Sherlock inhaled, meeting the man’s eyes.
“Why would they drive the van into the river, instead of burning it?” John mused, watching Mycroft talk to the photographer. Come to think of it, while he was unaware of names, he had grown familiar with the faces of several crime scene analysts that worked for Scotland Yard and, as he was looking around, came to realize most of the officers did not have that air of familiarity.
“Listen here, you intelligent, self-absorbed bastard,” he started as he held the side of his mate’s face, rubbing his thumb on his cheek. “When you come out of this, and you will, I know you’ll try to fight this on your own, so I’m going to call you a stupid idiot now.
He would have a talk with John later in the morning when the sun was up, though part of him wanted to wake him up just for the inconvenience.
Sherlock’s eyes trailed from their hands to the doctor’s face, mind at work as it was clearly studying the expression. His gaze moved from John to the closed laptop, then back to the table. At the objects upon it, his brows furrowed.
“Do you still believe that after all these years?” Mycroft asked, turning to face him as he leaned against the desk, crossing his arms. The expression he gave was the of condescension. “If that were true, little brother, then why did you enjoy it?”
“It’s not uncommon for them to go after family members of people they believe get too close; rather, it’s one of the things they’re known for,” he trailed off, seeming to focus on anything that was not John Watson’s look of horror.
“He’s tight,” the voice of the black-tank-topped man came out. “Hope Mycroft’s always wanted to see you railed, Sherlock,” he said, a low laugh escaping his throat. “Dreln, get a close-up on his arse – I want Mycroft to see every inch of his little brother.”
“Sherlock, are you with me?” John asked, gauging the other’s reaction.
“If they know they have my attention, they will do worse to him,” Mycroft’s voice invaded his thoughts, having him turn to look at him.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” he cut the eldest Holmes off as he brought his mobile down, pressing the button to end the call.
A few people walked by, which was expected given the time. With the sun since set, he realized it was close to the time of night Sherlock had been abducted the night prior.
“How did our security administration not pick him up when he entered the UK?”
I'm SO SORRY it took so long! m(__ __)m
Everyone,
He could still hear his voice echoing in his mind – Sherlock’s young voice crying and begging for him to stop.
Sherlock knitted his brows together. “Aren’t we late?”
Mycroft inhaled, bringing his gaze to him. “Sherlock has an infection from the…acts committed upon him,” he said, voice tight. “As it turns out, my brother has an allergy to Rocephin, the antibiotic they were using to treat apparent sepsis. When he was administered the second dose, his body was unable to handle the shock, leading him to cardiac arrest.” Relaying the information, his grip tightened on his umbrella.
Sherlock said nothing, his focus on where their hands met. John’s grip relaxed when he felt Sherlock’s hand move. While he had thought Sherlock was attempting to move his hand away, he was, instead, trying to turn his hand over. Once his palm was up, his long fingers tried to grip John’s. It was weak, something that apparently aggravated the younger man, the touch so light it was not even able to indent the skin on John’s hand. Sensing the brunet’s frustration, John gave it a tight grip.
“—I’m going to go out for a meal and you, Sherlock Holmes, are more than welcomed to join me.”
Sherlock himself had never been interested in pursuing a relationship and he had made that abundantly clear. As had John with his disinterest in men in totality.
Banishing any ill-will he had towards Sherlock’s sibling, he relayed, “We’ve secured the street. We’ll enter through both the back and front doors, blocking off any chance the people inside have to escape. Once they are secured, we’ll recover Sherlock and have this operation shutdown.”
Lestrade released a sigh at John’s disheartened expression and demeanour.
“Sir,” Donovan said to the nurse, who was now standing straight, his arms crossed over his chest as his gazed was focused on the veteran. “What’s you’re name?”
He looked at John, furrowing his brow as he scrolled back to play it again. They met gazes as the speakers echoed:
, your brother should’ve been made aware that his life was possibly in danger?”
With a hard swing, the knuckles on Sherlock’s right hand made contact with the man’s temple, sending the stout man crumpling to the floor. Sherlock shook his hand, the hit causing a slight pain down his wrist. He stared at the now-unconscious man as he started reworking the pin against the left shackle.
They held eye contact. John’s eyes were wide, his brow furrowed in a mixture of anger, fear and frustration, his jaw taut. Seeing a hint of the latter two emotions reflected on Mycroft’s features, John released a breath and broke his gaze away, beginning to pace around the flat.
In his bowels, he felt a hint of anger overwrought by depression.
“John,” Sherlock said, drawing his attention. “Would you give us a moment?” Though it was a request, it was said as a statement.
A group of people?
Lestrade shook his head as he brought his hand back.
He had been the only person Sherlock could even think of who he cared more than anyone else, and he had never let on.
Sorry about that.
“Either Frankie and them can kill you painfully or”—he grabbed Sherlock’s throat without applying pressure—“you let me do the honour, which, let’s face it, will be much faster and less painful than what they have in store. And believe me, their way includes a lot of bloodshed. I mean…
The comment had Mycroft pause, his rebuttal catching in his throat.
At the question, the man fell silent, his jaw taught.
Mycroft stood by the bed, his eyes staring sadly at his younger brother’s features, his mouth moving, words inaudible. John watched as Mycroft pushed Sherlock’s hair back from his face and leaned down, giving a soft kiss on his brother’s forehead. Sensing that he was seeing something he should not have been, John stepped back from the doorway, allowing Mycroft the privacy with Sherlock the eldest Holmes needed.
At roughly nine-thirty that morning, a young female entered the station.
At the comment, the man lowered his weapon, obvious discontent on his face.
A deep groan escaped his throat, his eyes flittering open to see the orange light hanging directly above him. When he shifted, finding his hands chained behind the chair and his ankles chained to the floor, his realization seemed to come into perspective. He recalled going to a restaurant with John, only for his head and body to feel numb after John had disappeared from view. He saw the image of the young woman who claimed to be a fan before she ran off.
Before he stepped through the threshold, the man called him back.
How would Sherlock’s situation be once they found him?
Eyes tracing the room, Lestrade saw the opened door leading to the corridor his men had come through. With Mycroft on his heels, he went to the door, passing by an old janitor’s closet to the left once passed the threshold. Lestrade motioned for the Holmes brother to go first when they arrived at the edge of the stairs with Mycroft’s shoes clicking on unfinished concrete. The first few steps echoed the crunch of glass under his shoes before shifting to metal grating. Rounding the corner, he heard the pleading voice of John Watson and the sound of beeping from an AED.
There was the sound of heavy footsteps coming from the hallway as Sherlock heard three sets of boots enter through the door from the hall. One of the strides he recognized as the man who wore the black tank-top. He subconsciously tensed, his spine going straight. The American had already returned to his position behind the camera, acting as though nothing had occurred. Sherlock could hear the man tapping away on the screen to his mobile, but, much the same, tried to not react to the newcomers.
There was an audible growl.
The American shrugged. “I don’t think he’s going anywhere.” He crouched down and grabbed the chair leg, pushing it in a bit further, causing Sherlock’s face to crease as he tried to hold back his vocals. “Besides”—he pulled the leg out harshly, not only garnering a muffled yell, but followed by a trail of blood—“I wanna have some fun with him, too, you know.” He looked up to the man, expression stern. “Keep it quiet from them.”
“Sherlock, are you almost finished? I brought breakfast.” He listened for movement or a response, garnering neither. His heartrate increased and he knocked again, this time harder and louder. “Sherlock, there’s coffee. Can I get you a cup?” Still no response. Though the young man would dismiss the promise of food, the promise of caffeine was never one to be ignored. “Sherlock Holmes, either you answer me or I’m coming in, clothed or not.” His voice came out deeper than he meant it, but it still failed to gain a reply. He cursed as he grabbed the handle, not ready to find his best friend and now-partner in such a state of undress, but his concern outweighed his embarrassment and he pushed the door open.
John followed their exit, shifting to Donovan, whose expression was a blend of anger and annoyance. She turned her attention to the two nurses still in the room and the onlookers.
The two investigators exited the vehicle, with Lestrade releasing a sigh.
His apologies.
“You really care about him, don’t you?” she asked, breaking the awkward silence and drawing John’s attention.
Sherlock scoffed, not at all phased by his brother’s actions. Whether it was the high or the fact that it was Mycroft of all people was left to be determined. “Still know more than you, obviously.”
John nodded, keeping a reassuring smile on his face. “That’s right. Who am I?”
The expression John held was one of confusion and frustration as he absorbed the information. He leaned forward, setting his forearms on his knees as he looked at Cruz. “Sherlock Holmes was dead when I got down there.” His heart lurched in his chest at the memory flashing before him, but it was Cruz’s reaction that kept him anchored. “Dreln’s trying to make it look like we were the ones responsible, and that he just got wrapped up in it. Him and Francis don’t give a damn what happens to us, they just want to save their own arses.” He fell into the persona, which seemed to work, whereas Cruz’s demeanour switched from being stiff and standoffish to almost desperate as what he thought he knew came crashing down. It had him wondering how far he could push it, whereas the Mexican man fell quiet as he searched for answers in front of him. “Mycroft Holmes did contact him – they made me listen to the recordings,” he hoped Cruz believed him, though only the part of having recorded messages was false. “Mycroft was offering us immunity and paid fare if his brother was returned, but Francis kept denying the offers.”
Otherwise,
Mycroft nodded, his eyes trailing to the front of the bricked structure. Without glancing to Lestrade, he responded, “Allow me to enter through the front as your men take the rear.” The suggestion had Lestrade furrow his brows. “The back door, most likely, leads to the sub-level. Given the time, I highly doubt they have anyone of worth watching my brother, what with the situation at hand.” He finally turned to face Lestrade, whose expression had gone from confusion to understanding.
With good reason.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft spoke in a sigh. “Pretend it’s someone you love. It will help.”
By the time they finished and removed the cloth, Sherlock was unresponsive.
He stepped up to the side of the bed, taking a sip from his coffee as he watched the nurse flip through the chart before placing it back on the hook on the wall next to the patient. Picking up and uncapping a new syringe, the man took hold of one of the medication bottles.
I'm so sorry if some of that bled over.
“No,” he said affirmatively as Lestrade’s shoulders dropped. “No, no way. I am
I have been working on this, but a lot of stuff has gone down in my personal life, so my desire to actually work on anything has been naught.
“Oh, there’s a lot o’ things I’d love to stick in that arse, but my hand ain’t one.”
John found himself smiling. “If it’s the smell that bothers you, I’ll have a bath in the morning; but, Sherlock, you’re smelling much worse, and I very highly doubt you’ll allow a sponge bath.”
Some things come to a head here, so please enjoy and let me know your thoughts!! (^ ^*)
Sherlock attempted to stand, but it was forewent as a kick to his chest caused him to fall backwards down the steps. He hit the wall at a bend, groaning at the fresh bruises forming and small shards of glass sticking into exposed areas of skin. He moved backwards down the stairs as the shadowy figure made its descent, finally hitting the flat ground at the end. Despite his injured and bleeding feet, he stood up, stumbling down the hall and back to the room he had been held in.
Don't kill me, yet.
He was currently held up in Lestrade’s office, his mobile on his lap, in hopes to hear something. The detective inspector came in late that morning, most likely for the same reason John had not slept. When he did come in, his eyes were hooded, he spoke in slurs and his being overall exuded fatigue. He barely acknowledged John as he walked to his office and unlocked the door. John asked if he had heard anything, to which the answer was “no”, before he was asked the very same question, giving the same response.
“You wanna put your hand in this bitch, too?” Dreln asked as his forced part of his arm in, garnering a shout from the young detective.
“You weren’t supposed to immobilize him,” the one in the black tank-top said, his accent proper, as the other moved to grab Sherlock by his neck and shoulders, hoisting him to his feet.
“They will kill him, John,” Mycroft said, a hint of desperation flirting with his tone. “Whether they get what they want or not, they will kill him.” The typical façade Mycroft usually held onto broke at the realization he had already known.
“Isn’t there a new case or something?” he put emphasis on the last word, wanting to gain some sort of response. Yet, the only response he received was Sherlock’s nonchalant shrug.
“It’s not difficult, Doctor Watson. With the right equipment, even an amateur can do it.” He failed to see the frown he received as a response.
As much as he disliked the woman and her detest towards his mate, he knew she was right.
A loud thud followed by metal clacking on tile pulled his attention.
The detective inspector released an audible swear and ran his hand through his hair. With his hands on his hips, he nodded, but still told her to have someone pull the traffic footage in the Ebury area for reassurance. In the meantime, the two of them would go to the sports pub to find out if anyone had been an unknowing witness.
He remembered her red hair and freckled face, but could not remember her eye colour. She was slender and he knew she was eye-level with him, putting her height at about 170cm; she had been wearing a dress – a type of sun dress if he remembered correctly – but could not recall the pattern, if it even had one.
“Figured I’d lie down, rest a bit.” He saw the outline of the person from his peripheral. The man was short and stout, face sunken in from apparent years of drug use. Unlike the man from earlier, his clothes were not worn from choice, but necessity – most likely someone lower on the totem pole, given the menial tasks that those in higher ranks felt did not require their attention. The way he carried himself hinted that he was not much of a threat if something were to arise.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, questioning if Mycroft even registered that he was there at all.
He turned his head to see the man from earlier taking off one of his gloves and unzipping his blood-smeared protective suit, revealing the same black tank-top and top part of the cargo shorts. He reached beyond his waistband, pulling out his mobile phone, which was ringing a high-pitched screech.
Even as the words escaped him, he failed to understand them.
In an instant, he pulled his hands in opposite directions.
As they stood dumbstruck in front of the computer screen, they failed to notice Donovan opening the door, stepping into the room.
Creaking filled the room.
The demeanour of the man suddenly changed and he grabbed Sherlock’s throat, gripping tight enough to stop blood flow. “Keep this up and you’ll end up in pieces scattered around the fucking country before the sun comes up, got it?” With the blood pounding in his ears and face turning a dark red, Sherlock failed to respond, causing the man to grip tighter. “Got it?!”
He watched as his mate fell silent. After releasing a groan, Sherlock asked, “Aren’t we late?”
It was the confirmation he did not know he needed: he had found them – found the people who held his best mate. He took his hand from his hilt of his weapon, eyes moving to the door at the opposite end. With their voices fading, he made his way over, gripping the handle and slowly inching it open. He did not know what he was expecting.
Sherlock would force himself to try and recover quickly, which would have more lasting damage than if he would allow himself to experience the full and complete stages. Then again, who was John to judge? He was as equally stubborn when it came down to it.
Here he had the option of how to die, and while neither leaned towards how he expected, he knew when to accept a better proposal.
He held out his hand as both he and Mycroft locked gazes, as though challenging each other.
At the question, Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he sat up to stare back in a mixture of surprise and confusion. John kept his impassive look, waiting for a response. “John…are you suggesting we go…
His bare flesh suddenly exposed to the cold air of the room had chill bumps form on his skin, and he found himself tugging at the chains, which only garnered a sharp pain down his back. When his buttocks were spread, his brain began trying to find anything else to focus on. It decided focusing on the previous night was the best situation.
Sherlock paused, questioning if his days had gotten confused. “Supper,” he said with an air of affirmation. “The restaurant will close soon.”
The younger man, whose eyes were closed, shook his head. “I’ve been drugged,” he said, his voice sounding distant,
His body tensed from reflex.
The few seconds felt like minutes before the man retracted himself, moaning in the pleasure of release.
Under normal circumstances, an allergic reaction to the antibiotic may have caused nausea or seizures, enough for the patient to know something was wrong and get medical aid; but for the patient’s heart to seize at such a young age and with a healthy heart, it was clear their physical state was in severe distress. John exhaled and found himself setting his forehead on his best friend’s thigh, his left hand on Sherlock’s chest and right on his leg.
The officer took a minute to register the name before he recognised it. He raised his brows as he nodded. “That explains it,” he muttered garnering an odd look. “Well, I’ll be on shift until the morning when Clarke relieves me, so don’t worry ‘bout anything.”
“How trite,” Sherlock scoffed as he rolled his eyes, John breathing out a laugh. The genius’ attention fell back on where John’s hand covered his own. Expecting a comment, John was taken aback when Sherlock came out with, “My arm’s numb.”
Sherlock’s reaction was to pull his head away, but it was merely a failed attempt. “Swallow it,” the voice came out in a raspy command as fingers trailed through his hair. With the motion he was able, Sherlock’s head jarred, his breath releasing from his nasal passages. “Oh, Sherlock…it wasn’t a request.” His nose was pinched shut while the man grabbed the back of his head and forced his length down his throat. Sherlock could only refrain for so long before his throat contracted and he swallowed, the bitter aftertaste left on the back of his tongue.
“Allison Maydock.” Donovan nodded, but as she was about to reply, John interjected:
She shook her head at the accusation. “Nothing! But there was a video on the site—” she cut herself off, as though regretting what she had said.
After she left, Sherlock stared blankly at his feet, his mind elsewhere. John had set his hand on his mate’s knee, running his thumb over the skin as his brows furrowed up. Sherlock’s eyes had grown distant as his breath hastened. While his expression had not changed, his eyes had grown red along with the rest of his face.
Sherlock kept attempting to fall back into his nonchalant demeanour the following days after his discharge. John was quick on the uptake, not pushing him and allowing him to return to some sense of normalcy. However, any time there was an off smell, Sherlock became visibly anxious; whenever he was around people, he would tense; if anyone so much as brushed against him, he would flinch. Each time, John was by him, giving a reassuring smile, while acting as though he did not notice every miniscule movement.
“No, listen.”
“They’re wrong.”
“She’s the woman we saw last night,” he spoke louder than he may have intended.
An awkward silence fell across the room as Sherlock returned to prodding at the food with the fork and Lestrade shoved his hands in his pockets. For the next few moments, the only noise filling the room was from the hall outside, with nurses passing and various conversations drifting in and out.
Though he had already known how he would end, realizing his time had finally come to a screeching halt had his entire being fall. Despite understanding Mycroft’s reasonings for not giving to their demands, his emotions took over and he felt his eyes burn beneath his lids. The brother he would never admit he respected and looked to was the very reason they would never see each other in the waking world.
“We’ve tried to track the video, but it appears they’ve encrypted and bounced the originating IP address through a relay of virtual circuits. Most likely using the same program they did to send the route information to the members in the UK.”
Sherlock’s arms fell to his side as the shackles were undone, his right arm immobile as the other was numb from the constricted blood flow. His body screamed at him, while his mind faded in and out. Blood, semen and urine dripped from his anal cavity as splintered wood kept itself held by the muscle, sending sharp pains throughout his lower abdomen and back. The piece of wood was grabbed and pulled out somewhat before being pushed back in, garnering a small whimper from the young genius as the broken wood caused shards to stick inside him.
He did it one more time, their expressions mirrored each other.
There was a laugh. The man had finally entered the screen, walking up to Sherlock right before he hit the detective across the face. He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s button-up.
Scanning the lounge, his gaze lingered on Sherlock’s chair, his chest slowly sinking. It took him a moment to drag his eyes over the couch, where the book Sherlock had been reading the night prior still sat on the cushion. Moving to the couch, he picked the book up, flipping through the pages, eyes catching a few sentences as the paper flittered over each other. He finally stopped on a page where the spine had been creased.
His attention was drawn back to the inspector, his eyebrows knitting in confusion as he tried to piece together why he was awakened on the sidewalk with a torch. He shook his head. “I – I can’t remember.” He held his head, recalling walking down the stairs of 221B Baker Street with Sherlock in front of him.
Despite knowing what happened was unavoidable, Sherlock’s subconscious was understanding disgust – not just with the man, but himself. Rationalization took over, but the back of his mind refused to silence itself. He shut his eyes, drawing his attention to anything but the current situation. He began visualizing everything leading up to his position – from John convincing him to go to dinner, leaving the flat, the man on his mobile, the red-haired fan – all to waking up and seeing the residue on the man’s boots.
“They got you, too, I see,” John commented, his voice flat with a hint of frustration as he approached the bolted chairs where the other sat. “It’s a load of rubbish, bringing us in like this, like we had a hand,” he said, sitting down with only one seat empty between them.
On the screen was a list of the requested.
“It’s so hard to find good help these days,” he said, though he sounded as though he was talking to himself. “Think you could recommend a reliable plumber, Sherlock? Don’t know who I can trust in my apartment in the damned city.”
Dreln turned to look at the broken man before him, then drew his attention to the chair leg, which had streaks of red down its pattern. It made contact with Sherlock’s face as Dreln wiped it on his cheek, the scent of blood, coitus and urine invading his senses. The American brought the leg back, inspecting it before tossing it off to the side where it clacked on the cement. His attention was back on Sherlock and he leaned over him, setting his hands on both sides of Sherlock’s head.
“No,” he shot back. “I can’t sit back and do nothing as while those…bastards have him.”
His body released a noise as the excess liquid left him, making the feeling of disgust worsen.
Setting his hands on his hips, he shook his head. However, his attention was drawn to John Watson jogging up to him and shoving a slip of paper against his chest. He took it as John pulled his hand back.
“Look,” she cut him off. “Just because most of us don’t like the freak doesn’t mean everyone doesn’t. No one willing hangs around Sherlock Holmes unless they need him. You’re the first, John.” John stared at her, his frustration and anger rising, but he kept it contained. “A blind man sees the way you two are with other. It’s just that you’re both too stubborn to say it.” She looked at the unconscious man on the bed. “Do both yourselves a favour and tell him,” she said, bringing her attention back to John. “Might not get the chance again.”
There was a buzz emanating from the man’s pocket. He took out his mobile and unlocked the screen, his fingers tapping away. As he sent the message, he walked to Sherlock and dug his heel into the back of the detective’s injured knee, garnering a shout as Sherlock was less than a foot from the broken chair’s leg.
It just so happens the cards fell how they did.
“Three minutes, Detective,” Mycroft said, making eye contact as his left brow rose. “Give me three minutes before anyone comes through the front.” It was more of an order than it was a suggestion, one which Lestrade seemed to accept, going against protocol.
Beeping filled the hospital room as the machine kept track of Sherlock’s heartrate and oxygen levels. Outside of the room, life bustled on with the chatter of nurses and patients with the occasional alarm alerting to a needed refill on a patient’s intravenous fluids. Media had already caught wind of the young detective’s hospitalization, though the reasons had remained clouded in mystery. Reports that Sherlock had been abducted gained mass coverage throughout the night and into the early morning, something everyone was hoping would die down in the following hours as long as no one fanned the flames.
“We can’t have that, now can we?”
Lestrade released a breath. “We found the owner of the van – belonged to an Agatha Delaney…who reported the van stolen a week ago.” The look from John was of concern, while Mycroft’s was that of disinterest. “They—”
While Lestrade and Donovan entered the bar, John’s eyes caught a familiar stature across the street at the Square as went to follow. He watched the person, ensuring that he was seeing who he thought, and that his eyes were not deceiving him. Turning to see the two investigators approach the bar, appearing to not have even noticed his absence, he made his away across the road.
“Is that a get-well card?” Sherlock asked, tone mirroring his typical state, though his features spoke much different.
I kept getting side-tracked with ideas, so my chapters have increased.
“What are you giving him?” John asked as the nurse pressed the needle of the syringe into the sealed cap of the liquid, filling the syringe.
“Right.”
“A bit better.” He took his phone back out and aimed it at the detective once more. “Come on, look up,” he said, snapping his fingers. Once Sherlock looked at him, the flash went off. Again, the man began texting. “Let’s call this a little portfolio of your progress. Because if Mycroft really couldn’t care, they’re going to need some way to identify the body.” He put his phone into his pocket, a disturbingly innocent smile on his face. “Tell me, Sherlock. How are you with being on film?”
They passed several familiar locations before the cabbie turned onto a street that quickly turned dead. Though the driver was waiting for his customer to comment that they were clearly moving in the wrong direction, his body language spoke volumes when John stayed silent, his eyes tracing over the written list of buildings containing basements.
There was a three-sentence conversation after the nurse had left, which John had simply asked, “So I’m your primary, now?”
He had not seen Sherlock eat the last week, so for the man to willingly go out to supper made him, in a way, feel fortunate. He doubted anyone else could have swayed Sherlock Holmes into doing what they wanted, but if living with the genius taught John anything, it was how to work around Sherlock’s quirks and to manipulate – to get him how to do what he wanted. While he was certain Sherlock knew what he was doing, he had yet to call him out on it, leading John to believe his opinion mattered.
“Shut the fuck up,” he snapped as he snatched his glove from the hand that was offering it back to him by the partially dismembered body. “Why don’t you actually make yourself useful and help cut up this asshole?”
She was nervously grasping at the hem of her dress, requesting to see either Sergeant Donovan or Detective Lestrade. One of the officers dismissed her; yet, when John saw her through the blinds of Lestrade’s office, he got up and scrambled through the precinct, grabbing the young woman’s arm.
I would write parts to this in a notebook, and had so many drafts, I didn't know which road I wanted it to go down.
That being said, I hope you all enjoy reading as much as I have writing. (^ ^*)
Before the American could get a word out, John blurted out, “Cleary sent me.”
If that were the case, then there was a strong possibility that their base was not too far from where the van had been pulled from the river.
After pumping out two chapters in just a few days, my brain short circuited.
His mobile vibrated, signalling an incoming text. A notification from Lestrade had come in, updating him on the number of total arrests: 62. It was the only bit of information they would tell him. Any of the information they had gathered was no longer something they could divulge, though John knew that if the tides had been different, Sherlock would have been one of the people requested to help work in the takedown.
John made an audible noise as he directed his attention to the cabbie.
It was forgone when the man unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans, exposing himself.
When he unlocked the phone and went to the messages, the most recently read came up on the screen. John’s brows knitted together at the message sent to Mycroft from Sherlock, with a timestamp around the time they had left the flat for dinner the other night.
Trying to catch himself, both of his hands were sliced on shards of glass.
How could they find him?
At the comment, Sherlock cracked his eyes open, sending what glare he could. Seeing John smirking, he turned his head away. “Not with you present. That’s certain.”
During the night, there was a changing of the guard. An officer from Scotland Yard had come into the room to let them know he would be taking over for the other, who John had only remembered seeing once that day when he went to the cafeteria to get his own meal. John thanked him, expecting him to leave and wander the halls and talk to the staff like the others had done. Instead, he came into the room and started conversation. After fielding the typical small talk questions, the officer apologised, catching him off guard.
He shook his head, banishing the thought. “I’m waiting on a list of sub-levels near the river.” She nodded, though her expression still read curiosity.
It had been nearly twenty-four hours.
“The crutches will do.”
The look of incredulity on John’s face was one that could not be ignored.
It appeared that Mycroft was given more information, whereas his shoulders had dropped when he approached them, despite his features reflecting indifference.
Survival be damned, he inhaled and finally opened his eyes, glancing sideways to make eye contact. Every fibre of his being was screaming at him, but he knew it to be for naught and he found himself nodding, his facial expression giving way.
John nodded, his eyes trailing around the room, which was in disarray, just as he left earlier that morning. It was only more evidence of Sherlock’s disdaining boredom.
The man had switched angles, pounding inside him at an awkward position, feeling as though it was ramming into the side of his wall. It was not long before the man released a grunt, spilling his seed into Sherlock. He performed a few more thrusts, pumping the white liquid inside him before retracting himself.
Sherlock’s eyes were trained down at the tray while Mycroft watched him, anticipating what was to come.
The silence from the other men in the room only seemed to cause his reaction to worsen, and as he was still trying to contain his emotional imbalance, all his brain could focus on was the eyes and camera on him, watching him falter – watching and recording the one reaction he thought himself immune to so long ago.
“E-mailed the footage to Harrison, but having a hardcopy is always preferable,” she said as she handed him the drive. “What’s the matter?” she asked, seeing his concerned look.
“I assume you have a forethought strategy?” Mycroft said the moment the two approached each other.
Sherlock’s headspace focused in and out, the mounting pressure in his lower stomach being the only thing that would continually drag him back to reality. He had attempted to take his mind’s advice, but was finding a face to be difficult. At one point, he had imagined the person by his rear to be Mycroft, which took him several attempts to banish before guilt set in that he had imagined his brother at all. John was next, which somehow did make everything a bit more tolerable, even if his mind was in constant dispute.
Mycroft had not seen his brother once since he became conscious, and it had the doctor asking himself too many questions – questions he was uncertain whether or not he wanted answered.
If they separated, it would make his infiltration much simpler; he just had to hope they would, if even to check on their missing ally.
The man before him was broad, though not heavy, wearing what looked to be a navy-blue t-shirt and cut jeans. Despite the appearance, it was clear that the clothing was expensive, most likely designer from a higher-end store. The boots Sherlock had heard were steel-toed and black, covered in what looked to be bits of dirt and dried liquid. He wore two rings on each hand, bulky and scratched; a mobile was in his left hand, unlocked with the screen brightness shining on his jeans. On his arms, Sherlock could see the faint lines of track marks.
“I believe you have something of mine,” he spoke calmly.
“Sherlock! Stay with me, come on.” Sherlock’s body fell forward, falling into his shoulder before he was able to say a word. Heart racing, he held his friend with one arm while pulling his mobile phone from his pocket with the other. Yet, before he could dial, he felt a searing pain radiate through his head and neck, his vision going dark.
“What was Mikey doing when you got here?” he asked.
“We lost the van near Cavendish Square. They managed to hack into the traffic cameras, putting them on loop. We were unaware of the breach until then.” Admitting that they were ignorant to a crack in their own system did not appear to come easy to the man Sherlock had once referred to as “being the British government.”
Upon arriving outside the flat, he barely acknowledged the cabbie as he got out and slammed the door closed. The driver drove off as John walked the two steps to stand in front of the door and took a deep breath, holding it for a moment before releasing it in a long exhale. The last thing he wanted to do was go inside and do nothing while the state of his best mate was unknown, but he also knew he had to get his bearings straight before he would be any good to anyone.
I was DESPERATE to get this chapter up prior to Sunday!
In front of his mouth, John’s fist was in a grip, his hand shaking.
The crutch clacked on the floor as Sherlock made his way down the hall towards the kitchen. The orange glow from streetlights pierced through the curtains just enough to cast the furniture in silhouettes. He reached to turn on the light, only to be met by disappointment. Heading towards the kitchen, he could hear a vehicle drive by the flat. His heart raced without his consent, despite logic dictating it was a civilian out late.
“And get blood all over my floor? Me thinks not, comrade Cleary.” The comment was met with an unamused expression, while Dreln inspected the camera, ensuring the battery was still charged. “Here.” He tossed the camera to the other man, who caught it without looking. “Do me a favour and charge that for me.”
“You’ve always enjoyed it, Sherlock; just as you did back then.” The younger man felt his chest tighten as he and Mycroft made eye contact, and he saw nothing but condemnation. He knew his own were reflecting betrayal and hurt, despite his attempt to keep his expression unreadable. The memory of Mycroft shoving him against the wall flashed across his mind. “Your denial is the very reason you’re alone, Brother Mine.”
Silence fell into the room like a brick, the brunet refusing to look up, not wanting to see the disappointment and pity he knew was on his friend’s face. He did not want to get angry, especially at John of all people; yet, at the recollection of having no control, and believing death would finally claim him, control was something he desperately found himself wanting to cling to.
“We were busy with other cases and it may have been overlooked.”
After being cuffed once more and escorted out of the room, it was not until the door was closed when John released a breath he was not even aware he was holding. As the officer began undoing his cuffs, John looked at Donovan who was in the midst of the end of a phone call. After the confinements were removed, John rubbed his wrists, eyes on the sergeant as she pressed the “end call” on her mobile. Sighing, her eyes landed on John, whose expression was nothing but curiosity as to why he was pulled out of the room just as he was making headway.
John sighed and sat next to him, the bed creaking as he set his elbows on his knees.
Lestrade was in the midst of speaking to one of the crime scene officers, going over what evidence that had been destroyed and the bit that was recovered. The longer the conversation went on, the more the detective inspector’s apprehension grew, his brow line ever creasing. When another SOCO approached them with another recovery, Lestrade stared at him, his expression unreadable as he nodded. As the two crime scene officers went over their finds, Lestrade excused himself.
It was immediately replaced by a groan.
I have been working like hell on this chapter.
“You were being you, Sherlock.” The response had Sherlock roll his eyes. “An immature twat who thought he knew the inner-workings of the world, while having no experience to have full comprehension.” There was a pause between them, Mycroft watching as his brother’s jaw tensed to refrain from making a comment. Mycroft inhaled and gripped the handle to his umbrella. “But your actions did not excuse mine. The actions I performed that night went beyond any and every boundary – there is no pardon for what I did. And I hope that, in time, you could forgive me…for everything.”
Sherlock did not even glance at him as John passed him to reach the landing. “Well enough.”
Dreln pursed his lips together, eyes darting off to the side in silent contemplation. “What to do, what to do?” He focused his attention back on Mycroft, glistening in sadistic amusement. “I really liked Sherlock, though. Soft mouth and tight ass? What more could you ask for?” Laughing at Mycroft’s hands gripping the hand of his umbrella with such ferocity that his knuckles had grown white, he pushed off from the desk and walked to stand in front of him, staring up at him, mocking him. “Is that why you want him back? So you can have fun with him, too? I can give you all the details – how good his mouth felt around my cock, how his ass tightened around my fist—”
“Oh, by the Lord, no,” came the comment with a chortle. “I just gotta take a piss.”
“I assume the zoo is out of the question,” John asked, though it was more of a statement as Sherlock sat in the chair across from him, setting the crutch to lean against the table.
Anytime Sherlock would cough or gag, the man would release a low-pitted moan, but would give no reprieve, instead holding the position longer. It did not take long before the thrusts got harder and faster, hitting the back of the young genius’s throat. Despite attempting to pull away, he was held firmly in place as the man released his seed into his throat and mouth, releasing a loud grunt as he did.
For once, the man had no reply, instead giving a mocked sympathetic expression. “You know, I figured Mycroft had some fucked up relationships, but that? That’s just sad.”
Noting the lack of sunlight, he brought his attention to John, who was now rereading what he had typed, ensuring there were no misprints.
He tried to get his mind right, tried to focus on anything other than the humiliation, but his brain would not allow him. All he could focus on was the moment and the pressure mounting in his lower abdomen.
Seeing the expression, Lestrade’s concern filled his speech. “What? What happened?”
With a groan, he closed the door.
His muscle throbbed against the man’s hand, a dull pain radiating from his rectum and through his lower back. So when Dreln began pumping his hand in and out, it took all of Sherlock’s self-control to not collapse in a mixture of pained cries and moans, if only to keep his shoulders from dislocating.
Ensuring that no one was in the hall, Sherlock made his way down, ears on alert for any sound that he himself did not make. When the low light from the room could no longer penetrate through the hall, Sherlock was left in complete darkness, leaving his fingers to trace along the wall. It was not long until his foot hit a block, causing him to hiss at the pain that radiated through from his toe to his heel.
The words caught John off guard, his expression confused as his brain pieced the information. As though a million and one ideas ran through his head before he seemed to land on one in particular. His change in demeanour had Lestrade knit his brows together, but John only came out with;
As his hand hovered over John’s, he glanced up one more time for confirmation; and when saw nothing but trust and comfort, he set his hand in John’s, the older man taking hold and pulling Sherlock forward into an embrace. As John’s arms wrapped around him, for the first time, a sense of calmness came over him. It was the first time he had realized that whenever John was around, there was a sense of comfort and safety, a sense that had otherwise been foreign to him. Sherlock felt himself melt away, the memories of the basement sinking into the distance.
“Always the same thing. You’re getting old.” There was a pause as John made his way closer to the door, contemplating whether or not to step through and take his chances. “So go downstairs and have some fun – only thing that keeps any of us entertained these days.”
“I appreciate your concern,” Sherlock said blandly as he took another bite.
As his mind’s rendition of John nodded, Sherlock shut his eyes, his own heartbeat invading his ears.
His eyes were still attempting to focus as he finally answered, “Bath.”
There was a clicking sound that drew his attention back to the door. His look was curious as he saw the doorknob return. Gathering to his feet, he slowly walked towards the door, eyes not straying from the handle. He could feel the metal on his palm when he gripped it and a strange anxiety grew inside him as the prospect of what he would find. Taking a breath, he pulled the door open, introducing him to a familiar light. Stepping through the threshold, he found himself in the flat of 221B Baker Street. Confusion washed over him as he took in the surroundings – the living room in disarray, the light of streetlamps leaking into the room through the windows, John sitting in his chair while updating their blog.
Knowing Mycroft, his brother fully intended to keep Sherlock under surveillance until the last of their ranks had fallen throughout the United Kingdom. At the thought, the memory of being chained in the basement flashed across his mind before an old memory of he and Mycroft rose to the surface.
“Do you want me to embarrass myself?” he asked, meeting John’s eyes in a silent battle, one which John had already chosen to take no part in.
“Very much so.” He remembered getting into several arguments with both Lestrade and Donovan during Sherlock’s disappearance, guilt in his stomach like a rock. Handling victims and victim families was what the man excelled at, and it was not like he did not know John was getting upset over the situation, not himself.
It took more will than he thought to not let his smile falter. John shook his head. “No, Sherlock.
EXPECT ALL BECAUSE I LIKE STRESS!!! (ง •̀_•́)ง
He could not help but smile, holding back a chuckle as he wondered if even Sherlock realized what he was doing. By trying to avoid talking to Lestrade, he had eaten over half of the meal he had spent the better half of an hour complaining about. It was the most he had eaten since he had come around, much to the dismay of not just John, but the nurses who had been assigned to his room. They were threatening to feed him through an IV if he kept refusing his meals. If being annoyed was what had him eating, John had half-a-mind to call Lestrade back in; but it was forgone when Sherlock finally put the fork down and pushed away what little was left.
Donovan made her eye roll apparent. “None of those of structures
His mind sunk back into itself, leaving him on the floor in the room. As he looked around, he saw both his brother and his best mate watching. While John’s look was compassionate, Mycroft’s was that of disappointment. He knew his eyes were red, his face sunken and being broken. He made eye contact with both of them before landing on John’s gaze, those eyes that he had become so accustomed to over the years without ever realizing. Seeing the expression he would have expected on his best mate’s features given the situation was one to make him break.
An unwilling grunt fell from his throat as his hole was spread, albeit small.
John nodded his acknowledgement, though there was a hidden annoyance at being left out.
The room smelled stale and still. The bed centred against the far wall was still made, its sheets and quilt hardly moved. There was a desk pressed against the right wall, still neat and tidy with a few university texts stacked on a ring of notebooks. A young Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed, creasing the quilt as he flipped through the thin pages of one of the textbooks. There was the sound of shuffling outside of the bedroom door. The sixteen-year-old genius had gone through a few more pages as the doorknob turned and the wooden door opened.
It was after the hospital had finished serving their patients dinner when anyone else decided to visit. Sherlock was in the midst of picking through and complaining about the quality of food when there was a knock on the door. John’s attention was immediately drawn, while Sherlock paid no heed and continued to make his disdain known at his apparent restricted diet. According to him, there was no logical reason for him to be placed on a bland diet of boiled chicken and white rice; even with John explaining that due to the rectal trauma, he could only eat certain food, Sherlock continued to protest.
His name was written on the back in handwriting he immediately recognised as Lestrade’s. He already knew it was his mobile before taking it out, but there was still a sense of reprieve at physically holding it for the first time in over a week. What he was not expecting, however, was a folded up note that dropped out with it. He made his way towards the lamp in on the table, turning it on and holding the note under the light.
At the mention, Sherlock found himself as a sixteen-year-old standing in front of a fully-grown Mycroft. With Mycroft’s hand still on his cheek, Sherlock felt his eyes sting.
“If you don’t mind my ask, who was the man in the suit?” the officer’s question cut his thoughts.
Any hopes he had for a lead left, his spirits following suit.
It took a moment for the question to register, but John forced eye contact.
The sun was setting as the patrol car pulled up outside of the sports pub with John Watson in the back seat. He had demanded to come along, despite Donovan’s obvious disapproval and Lestrade having rather had him stay behind. Before either of them could voice their further discontent, John had holed up in the back seat, saying they might as well go, since he was not going anywhere.
In an instant, he hit the floor, dragging himself back towards the door, pressing against it, eyes focused on his own dead expression as his heart pounded viciously in his chest. His breath was rapid, his ducts betraying him.
He was slowly lowered to the cushions, trying not to let the discomfort the movement caused show on his face. As he sat back, John left to retrieve the crutches at the foot of the stairs. When he came back, Sherlock had set his head on the back of the cushions, eyes staring upwards towards the ceiling. John set the crutches to lean against the arm to the couch before moving around and sitting down next to him.
When he came outside the door, his brow furrowed, seeing it slightly ajar.
The trolley was two doors from Sherlock’s room when John walked in, the smell causing his stomach to rumble. He would have to go to the cafeteria to get food for himself after ensuring his mate would eat his own breakfast.
John released a sigh and grabbed the handle. “Please be decent,” he muttered as he pulled the door open. “Christ, Sherlock,” he exhaled and approached his mate, who was on the floor, his forearm across the latrine from a failed attempt to stand up. John moved to help him, taking hold of his right arm and slinging it around his shoulders, grimacing at the blood seeping through Sherlock’s socks.
The medic looked to Lestrade and Donovan for confirmation, rolling his eyes in aggravation when Lestrade nodded.
“We need to find the others involved,” Lestrade said, voice sounding distant and hollow as his mind fell to the background. “Bring them to justice.”
After the deletion, there were only a few left unread. However, what caught his attention was a message that had been sent from his phone, which had been sent after he had been abducted. A large knot formed itself in his throat as his thumb ghosted over the tab. Opening it, he felt his blood run cold and he released a tight breath.
John awoke to a bright light shining in his eyes and a throbbing headache. Sally Donovan was leaning over him, shining a penlight into his eyes as she lifted his eyelid, looking for an apparent concussion. The doctor groaned, trying to roll his neck while Donovan kept his head in place. His entire head pounded, his frontal lobe aching with a dull pain, the light aiding in no comfort. Behind Donovan, he could see the blur of a blue lights from a police car. Her voice sound muffled and distant, but he was certain she was calling his name.
It only took a few moments before the man’s struggling became less apparent, limbs ultimately falling. John gave it another minute to ensure the man was fully incapacitated before he released his grip and gently lowered the man to the floor.
He looked around, but the office laid barren. Knitting his eyebrows together, he walked behind the desk, where a manila folder was closed. When he opened it, he was introduced to pictures of himself being violated by different people, each one having a close-up. As he flipped through the pictures, he shook his head before closing the folder. He shut his eyes, inhaling. The sound of footsteps from the entryway drew his attention and he pulled his head up, expression curious as the figure of his older brother crossed the threshold.
The man looked up from his phone, contemplating, before a smile graced his features. “No one’s expecting an immediate response, Mr. Holmes. But believe me when I tell you that he will eventually, unless he’s always wanted to see his little brother die.”
Lestrade had made a few audible comments, which the blood pounding in John’s ears drowned out. It was not until Lestrade’s arm knocked into him as he reached to the laptop that John had paid any attention at all.
He made eye contact with Sherlock, both of their confused and apprehensive gazes melding with each other’s. “My time wasn’t worth anything until I met you, Sherlock Homes. Don’t you dare leave me again.”
A block down, he was able to hail a cab, choosing to ignore the look he was given when he gave the cabbie the address.
Finally, Mycroft placed the sealed bag in Lestrade’s open palm; yet, before he released it, said, “If further damage is done, destroying any information that may still be salvageable, I can’t promise London will still be under your ever-watchful eye,” he finished with a calm mien.
Working solely with John was interesting and kinda fun.
Both John and Lestrade shared a look of sympathetic aggravation. Lestrade released a sigh. Mycroft’s absence had clearly not gone unnoticed by the young detective and it was suspected it weighed more on him than he let on, no matter how much he allowed his impassive demeanour to say otherwise. A few times since he was forced to work alongside Mycroft Holmes for this job, Lestrade had made the comment that he should visit his younger brother. He had even made it a point to alert Mycroft whenever he intended to stop by the hospital, a subtle yet clear hint for Mycroft to join him.
It was not until the early hours of the morning when John returned to 221B Baker Street. He had waited at the police station for hours, hoping for a call to come in, fitting the female’s description; but when nothing came in, Lestrade convinced him to return home.
John did not respond.
are going to get through this, Sherlock Holmes. I’ll be damned if I allow you to go through anymore alone.” Leaning down, he pressed their foreheads together. “I’m here with you, Sherlock. I’ll always be here.”
So sorry this took so long!!
Before she left, she turned back to the military veteran. “John.” He turned to look at her. “Even Freak deserves someone to love him, it might as well be you.” With that, she turned on her heel, leaving the Army doctor to his thoughts.
“It’s what the doctor ordered,” Lestrade said as he entered the room.
“Sir, we found a body in the alleyway.”
“You patronise me.”
John turned to look at him, giving a nonchalant shrug. “Said he was going to get a pack of fags and would be right back.” The man rolled his eyes, aggravation apparent at the information. Giving another shrug at being waved off, John moved down the hallway.
Biting back the anger that was rising within him, the official made eye contact, which the other appeared to enjoy, his own eyes glistening with exhilaration. “This can go one of two ways, Mr. Hargett: you either return my brother to me and make it to trial, or I will take him back and you’ll be fortunate to see the sunrise.”
Um...hi? ( ^ ^;)
Laugh in the Face
“Francis Bellman, you’re under arrest for the abduction, assault and attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes,” Lestrade said, garnering confused looks from the security and hospital staff who had known the man personally.
John’s heart pounded, his jaw clenching as his brows furrowed.
This...took WAY too long and, for that, I'm SO SORRY. m(__ __)m
“But it’s not,” Sherlock said, the disapproving look of his brother meeting his eyes. Sherlock quivered, his forehead creasing as his eyebrows rose. “Mycroft, none of this is a fault of my own.”
So much has happened in my life and my writing muse just bounced.
“I’d love to, but you know me. I don’t like getting my hands dirty.” Dreln went back to his phone.
Although she appeared annoyed that she would not be able to watch whatever the video entailed, Donovan still nodded and placed her hand on the young girl’s shoulder. Taking her out of the room, John and Lestrade waited until they saw both of them at Donovan’s desk before turning their attention back to the computer.
With his adrenaline coursing through him, his senses went into overdrive, a feeling he had not experienced since the time he met Sherlock and had to save him from his own arrogance. It was a wave of clarity.
Finally, he turned his attention, his brows up and causing creases in his forehead.
“Took y’all long enough,” the American spoke casually without looking up from his phone.
The awkward air was broken by both Lestrade’s and Mycroft’s mobiles going off at the same time. While Mycroft’s was in the form of a call, which he stepped away to take, Lestrade’s was received as a text message. Watching them, John saw Lestrade’s features drop before Mycroft’s, though the detective inspector’s was much more readable.
Either way, the lie was justifiable if it meant finding the man he so desperately sought.
At the response, Mycroft dropped his hand and walked pass him to his desk.
“Wasn’t aware I was going anywhere,” Sherlock spoke, his voice tired and hoarse.
“Sherlock?” When his mate did not respond, John moved to take Sherlock’s hand, gripping it tightly. “Sherlock, talk to me.” Still, Sherlock stayed silent; all that came from him was the quickening of breath and a knitted brow. John started calling his name as he reached to hold his face, turning the younger man’s head towards his own. Despite his unfocused expression, the fear and anxiety building up behind Sherlock’s eyes was apparent. John kept calling to him, Sherlock’s gaze not focusing. “Sherlock, what’s your brother’s name?”
Pulling it from his pocket, the screen only read “Unknown Caller” against a black screen. While he would have ignored it on any other occasion, the situation at hand made him accept the call.
Reaching into his pocket, his pulled out the slip of paper Lestrade returned, with each sub-level in London listed. With where the van was located, the closest building with a basement was a little over a kilometre.
The American glanced to him before going back to his phone.
The van that Sherlock was abducted in is located. Meanwhile, Sherlock is subjected to scenarios that bring out his own inner demons.
There was a snort from the American, who was clearly still by the camera and not the one holding the broken leg by his cavity.
As his body pushed out the final bit of urine, Sherlock inhaled, a vocalised cry escaping him.
“You will be lucky to make it to trial, by that I swear,” Mycroft spoke, his voice low, threatening. The two officers appeared nervous, unsure whether or not to break the government official away. “Every person you interact with, whether it be here or in the Americas, will believe the worst; and anything you put my brother through will pale in comparison, Mr. Dreln Mathias Hargett.”
basements, John.” The doctor stopped in mid-rebuttal, his brows creasing. “Do you honestly think we didn’t consider that?”
Three security cameras were on the outside of the building, one facing the door, one facing down the sidewalk and the other pointed towards Ebury Square. Donovan seemed more apt to agree with the proposal that she had about fetching the possibly-corrupt traffic camera footage.
There was a moment’s pause as he leaned into the van, before he stepped back, carrying someone’s legs. The other individual opened the side door to the people carrier, while another person exited the van, hauling the upper body of an apparent unconscious man. Upon closer inspection, the dark trousers and long-sleeved shirt, along with the mat of dark, curly hair, made no mistake that it was the young genius Sherlock Holmes.
His will to live and overall submission were in discrepancy.
The right bastard had known the new code the entire time, but it had them both laugh at the absurdity.
“Frank Bellman,” he responded in haste, almost breathing out his name.
“London is…quiet for the moment,” he said, his voice hinting aggravation.
He had made multiple calls for the return of Sherlock. He had offered plea deals, ways for the Cielo Diablos to leave the city without alerting any form of authority, complete immunity to any charges as long as they returned his brother alive. Each time, he had been denied, even so much as being told he would have his brother returned in pieces. Yet, the way Dreln spoke, it was clear the American was never aware of any such bargain.
“Unless it was hacked like the other cameras,” Donovan commented, doubting the reliability. The look she was given was that of confusion, which she mirrored. “The notice this morning?” she drew out. When his expression failed to the change, she remembered that he had been called away to investigate the scene surrounding the van before it had come in. “We got an anonymous call this morning alerting us to a system breach in some of the traffic cameras in London. While they were apparently restored before we were notified, they were hacked around the time of the abduction.” She exhaled and crossed her arms. “But we don’t know how many were hindered or for how long.”
“Justice would be their heads on pikes,” came the monotone response. Releasing a sigh, John dropped his shoulders. “Fine. What do you need me to do?”
He had a surge of anger when some of the comments in the forum were asking about the videos of his mate’s abduction; some were discussing the content, while others were directly asking for them. Even though the comments asking for the videos were not nearly as plentiful as the ones saying how they hoped the videos were fake and that “the real Sherlock” was all right, just knowing that people were willing to watch something of that calibre and celebrate it had John’s rage boiling to the tipping point. When he saw a comment about one of the videos with a link to a .jpeg, he fought with himself whether or not to click it, but wanting to ensure that all traces of Sherlock’s degradation were no longer accessible, he clicked the link.
