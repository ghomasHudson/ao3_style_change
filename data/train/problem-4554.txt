Also, I feel I should mention that Charlie doesn't know about what happened to Dean. The only ones who know about that part of Phase 2 are the Alphas (like Alistair) who are a part of that portion of the phase, and the people who are in charge.
He was just about to resign himself to his fate and simply comply with the command to 'mate'. If that's what it took in order to see Dean again, then he'd do it. He just hoped Dean could forgive him. He turned to Alfie to announce his decision. “Alfie, when you go into heat again-”
After a moment of thought, Cas answered, “No. I didn't.” Cas then shifted slightly to get a look at his wrist. Noticing what Cas was doing, Dean did the same. They both saw that each of their implants were displaying the three vertical dots, still pale and pulsing in the still-dim light of the room. “Did our wrists ever change?”
“Well, I know Bela and Adam don't really like him either. Ruby and Lilith, on the other hand...” she paused, heaving a great sigh and rolling her eyes dramatically, “those two were
“Can...” he swallowed and licked his lips, “can I see him?” The shock of being pregnant suddenly took a back seat to the fact that Dean had other family somewhere.
Five pups! He could hardly even imagine it. How does someone wrap their head around a thing like that? How does something like that even
A sob escaped Dean's lips, reaching Alistair's ears. “Aw, sweet little thing. Here, let me help you.”
As weird as it sounds, the doctor's half rant/half pep talk actually made Dean feel a little better. He looked down and placed his hand over his stomach, imagining the little lives held within. He still wasn't completely happy about it, though he knew Cas was ecstatic. He could practically
Dean shook himself from his reverie and looked back at the other Omega, a knowing smirk gracing her features. “What?” he asked, honestly confused.
That was Amy. Benny's breath hitched in his chest. They were planning on getting rid of him next? And putting
“Alright, that's enough you two!” Jody interrupted. “You're both big, bad Alphas. We know. We get it. Now enough with the posturing. You're not in competition with each other, so knock it off!”
The stayed still for a few moments before either of them spoke. Just breathing and trying to get their raging heartbeats under control, while exchanging a few languid kisses on lips, necks and shoulders. Cas was still battling his inexplicable urge to sink his teeth into Dean's flesh, particularly the bit where his shoulder and neck meet. It didn't help that, for some reason, Dean now had his face buried in the crook of Cas's neck as well, breathing deeply.
“Dean?” Benny asked. He and Jody exchanged a look. That was the Omega they'd seen in the video. One of Benny's newest Omegas. And wasn't Alistair the name of the Alpha who was assigned to him in Phase Two?
As soon as they were freed from their burdensome vestments, they were each once again bombarded with the scents all around them. They could smell the lingering remnants of pheromones left behind by the previous occupants, faint as they were. They could also scent the other members of their party. Amy's heavy scent of tobacco and oil, and the Betas' muted scents intermingled with soap and other artificial odors.
He should just ignore it. It's none of his business what that's all about. He just needed to finish cleaning up and
For now, Dean just wanted to relax, and honestly, he was right were he wanted to be: in the driver's seat of his Baby, the road whizzing by beneath them; his little brother riding shot gun, lazily perusing dad's journal; and Castiel in the back seat, silent as always. Dean took a deep breath, and just relaxed into the normality of it. Deep breath in, slow breath out. He had his two favorite people in the world with him, and all was right with the world.
“Yeah, we were lucky,” Cas grinned. “Benny and Jody seem really kind. I can't imagine what we would've had to go through if they hadn't been so lenient.”
“That,” drolled Uriel, looking bored, yet still smug, as always, “is part of the reason we're here. There has been a rather...
“Dean!” Castiel scolded harshly, his fingers tightening on Dean's thighs, his voice taking on a timbre that demanded obedience. Though he didn't mean to do it, it did have the desired effect of stopping Dean from further belittling himself in his presence. “I never want to hear that kind of talk coming from you again! Understand?”
“It's okay Dean. Everything is going to be okay. I know you must be very nervous about all of this, but it's all going to work out, alright?”
“I- uh,” Cas huffed out a breath, “I don't know. I wish I could help you more, you know, considering. But I don't have any answers here.”
“Alfie,” Cas repeated with a nod to his head. “It's very nice to meet you.” He slowly offered his hand to the other person and waited patiently for him to take it.
Benny gave Charlie's hand one last squeeze before releasing it and placing both his hands on the table in front of him. Lacing his fingers together, he turned back to Dean and Cas before continuing. “So, how are ya findin' the place? What do ya think?”
Eventually, it was Jess who approached, much to Sam's discomfort. Castiel may have been his brother-in-law, but at the moment he was also a distressed Alpha protecting his injured and pregnant mate from what he perceived as threats coming from all sides. He restrained himself from reaching for her and holding her back. The sudden movements were sure to agitate Dean's mate even further.
The shelf with the big jars was slightly overhead, so he reached up and grabbed one by the sides. It was only about 10 lbs, not too heavy, but it was awkward trying to get a proper hold on it. Honestly, why did they put such huge jars on such high shelves? Whatever. He just needed to get it
“Cas-” He tries again to beg the Angel for what he wants. It's all he can do. At the moment he's helpless to the Angel's whims. And right now, the Angel doesn't want him to come.
“Well, Betas don't smell pheromones. At least not on the level that Alphas and Omegas can.” At the twin expressions of confusion that she was met with, Charlie chuckled a bit before saying, “Why don't we keep moving, okay? We can get some food in you while I explain a few things.”
“Hey, let's get outta here,” Dean said to his mate. He really didn't want to be in the same room as Benny or Jody at the moment. As much as he liked them, he just couldn't even look at them at the moment.
“But...” Cas said, unsure of what to do. “Dean...” he looked over to his mate, pleading with his eyes for the Omega to understand.
Jess was having none of it, though. She waved off his attempts to pull her away and instead continued to talk to Castiel, despite his furious scent setting her on edge. “I know you're scared, and you're trying to protect Dean. But everyone here just wants to help.” Castiel's breathing slowed as he focused on Jess, as if seeing her for the first time. Emboldened, she said, “He's bleeding out. You have to let the medics help, okay?”
“Of course. I caused it,” Cas deadpanned. “I was curious, but... I did not know you would react so... intensely. I apologize.”
When Cas finally came, his knot popping and catching on Dean's rim, spilling his own load deep inside Dean's drenched hole, Dean had cum a total of five times. By the end of it, Cas had finally let Dean touch himself, so Dean was able to cum with his fist locked tight around his cock and pumping furiously to milk every possible drop from his balls. At the end of it all, the two of them were a sticky and gooey mess, but neither of them had the energy, or the wherewithal, to care at the moment.
“Wait,” he said. Cas paused, looking at Dean with a question on his face. “I... I kinda like it.” The questioning expression left Cas's face, replaced with open surprise before Dean continued. “Just... you know... you don't gotta hide it, or whatever.” Dean blushed again, and he was getting really tired of his cheeks flaming dammit! He turned ducked his head, trying to hide his burning cheeks, and ran a hand over the back of his head.
“Oh, not to worry,” Abby said, “we've found a few more pockets of survivors hiding out in the wilderness. They're very ill, but they're going through processing as we speak. They should be healthy and ready for Phase One in just a few days.”
When Cas entered their apartment, he immediately knew that something was wrong. The scent of Omega distress heavily permeated the air and panic rose in the Alpha's chest.
Cas finished pulling on his own clothes and slowly made his way over to the other man's side. Dean finally pulled his shirt on over his head, the wide collar showcasing his still-healing mating bite and the fresh bruises his mate gave him the night before. The Alpha encircled his Omega in his arms and drew him close, pulling him in and nosing against the mark he'd given him.
Amy's upper lip twitched with a barely-contained snarl at being given an order by a Beta, and Cas was looking just as conflicted. However, eventually, both Alphas relented, listening to the more logical parts of their brains, and obeyed the order to stand down.
“Didn't you enjoy it when Cas dominated you during sex?” Charlie gave a small smirk and waggled her eyebrows in Dean's direction.
“I dunno.” Had their wrists displayed the red triangular patterns and then changed back once they'd finished, without them noticing? Had they not changed at all? If they hadn't changed at all then does that mean...? “Dude... did we do all that on our own?”
Benny gave a long-suffering sigh and said, “Look, I know it's frustrating, but just hang in there, alright? We can change at the next checkpoint before we get to Gabe's.”
Cas frowned in confusion and concern. “You... you pushed me, Dean. Remember?” Dean simply shook his head. “Dean... you pushed me when I tried to stop you.”
“So what do you think?” Jody asked Benny once the pair were out of earshot. She spoke quietly, seeing as there was still a chance of being heard by others.
Whatever it was, Dean didn't like that one bit. As soon as the words had left Cas's mouth it had been impossible for him to disobey. Was Cas even aware that he'd done it?
“Yeah,” Cas agreed. “That sounds good.” Without another word, the two of them got up from the table, and walked out of the kitchen, hand-in-hand. Cas refused to let go of Dean for even a moment.
Cas, for his part, tried loosening his fingers from around Dean's wrists. He tried just sitting up or rolling over, but it was like his hands were glued to Dean and Dean was glued to the floor. Neither of them could budge. Cas even tried to throw his weight backwards, hoping that if he got some momentum it would dislodge to the two of them, but nothing worked.
The arousal he was feeling every time Alfie presented himself was beginning to become unbearable. It wasn't too bad at first, but each subsequent presentation seemed to cause his arousal to pile up on itself, and now it's getting to be just a little too much. He feared he wouldn't have a choice but to 'mate' with the young Omega if this continued any further.
“I know, it's just-” he paused, once again looking for the right words to describe his thoughts. “I dunno, I just wanted to have a contingency. In case things went sideways, that's all.”
Alistair made his way into the living room without further preamble, Dean and Cas not far behind him. He plopped down on the couch, draping himself over the entire thing, not leaving room for either of his hosts. The pair merely sat on the love seat together, their backs to the window display, turning diagonally so they could both see the other Alpha clearly.
In one corner of the room, there was suddenly a source of running water. But this in and of itself would not be the cause for marvel. No, the astonishing thing about it was that the water was flowing
Cas huffed in frustration. “Of course!” He relaxed back into his position next to his mate and wrapped a protective arm around the Omega once more.
commit murder. A rather bloody and violent crime in this case,” she very pointedly glanced over to the stains then back at the couple. “And he was an Alpha. We need all the Alphas and Omegas we can get to produce more offspring and repopulate.”
“Dude, we're already sleeping together.” Dean motioned around them, gesturing at the bed they were lying on.
“Yep. New mate. Since Castiel is still a healthy Alpha, if you were locked away for life, then he woulda been assigned a new mate, ASAP.”
Dean was gonna backpedal and say he didn't mean it like how it sounded. Like he was talking to his unborn kids. Like he was
He wandered down the aisles once again in search of a janitor's closet. Once he found one, he grabbed a mop and a wheeled bucket. He then filled the bucket with water from the conveniently-placed industrial sink with a hose attachment and added some cleaning liquid to it. He then grabbed an extra bucket that looked pretty clean for holding pickles. At the last minute, he grabbed a rag, just in case, and shoved it halfway into his back pocket, then headed back out to where he'd left his mess.
Anger and aggression were now permeating the air in the room. Inexplicably, Dean had the strong desire to lower his head and back away in submission at the scent of so much sudden Alpha-ness in the atmosphere. The Omega-like response pissed him off and he fought against it, standing by his mate's side with typical Dean-like stubbornness. If someone was going to threaten his mate, he'd be damned if he was going to leave his side.
It grated on Dean's too, but he didn't say anything. His mate's presence was far too comforting at the moment and he couldn't bring himself to worry too much about it. He let loose a jaw-cracking yawn.
After a full minute, the water stopped and drained away into the ceiling and Benny moved to the door in the center of the black wall. He stepped up to the Geiger counter mounted to the little shelf, and was satisfied when it barely registered any radioactivity clinging to him or his bag at all.
After a few moments, Dean finally reached the bottom and got a good look around himself. He was in a hallway. There were doors lining the walls on either side in both directions. Which way should he go? With no better options, he decided to go left. He'd try that way for a while, and if he didn't find anything that promised a way out, then he'd backtrack and try the other way.
In the center of the glass wall was a glass door and a metal keypad with a retinal scanner to the left of it. Jody stepped up to it, punched in a ridiculously long series of numbers, and then leaned down for the scanner to read her eyeball through the plastic of her hood. Before long, there was a heavy clunk and Jody opened the door and allowed everyone to follow into the room behind her.
Dean moved to his own side of the room, as far away from Castiel as the limited space would allow. He paced a bit, all the while starting to feel itchy from the drying cum on his torso and dripping down his leg. He ran a hand through his hair and closed his eyes. Taking and releasing a large breath, he laced his fingers together behind his head and dropped his chin to his chest. Frustration bubbled beneath his skin, but it wouldn't do to lose his cool at the moment. So he just stood near the wall and breathed.
seem to be getting warmer, as another bead of sweat began trickling down his face. He swiped it away angrily.
“Oh, cram it, Lilith, will ya!” Meg pushed herself off of the wall where she'd been leisurely watching the scene before her. “The man said he'd get to us when he gets to us, alright. Just put a sock in it and let's go.” She jutted her head behind her in the direction of their own apartment.
That made Cas chuckle and he drew his mate back into his arms once again, stoking the Omega's back soothingly. Dean smiled and once again melted into his mate's embrace.
“What do you mean, Alfie. Did what?” He didn't like the knowing look that suddenly graced the Omega's face.
Another reason to brave the outside was to attend endless meetings. The Council agreed that all scheduled meetings were to be held in-person at one of their six facilities – on a rotational schedule – so that no one Council member would feel slighted or over-empowered.
Cas merely pointed to another corner of the room. Dean followed the indicated direction. His eyes bulged and his jaw dropped at what he was seeing. He has no memories of his life outside of this room, but he knows that
“You should get some more rest, Dean.” Cas leaned down and pressed a kiss to the top of his mate's head. “I'll be here when you wake.”
The first thing he had to do was find a mop to clean up all of that juice, and a bucket to drop the pickles in to. He wasn't sure what the procedure for this would be; do they have the resources to afford to throw away such a large amount of food product? Or would they just rinse them off really well and use them anyway? He'd have to clean them up and then ask Ellen about them and bring up a fresh jar too, just in case. It was just a good thing he had the forethought to bring the cart with him.
“Yeah, man! Blood loss'll do that to you. Let me get you a plate and something to drink.” Sam rushed over and quickly piled a plate full of food and filled a glass with water while Dean and Cas took their seats at the long table.
“Alright, lets go.” Cas dragged Dean by the hand and led him to the master suite for much-needed rest and relaxation.
Taking the hint, Benny took up his own glass and swallowed a large mouthful. Bourbon. She remembered. He stifled a tiny grin, though he wasn't completely successful in doing so. “So what did ya have in mind?”
They were silent for a while longer. After a few minutes, Dean quietly said, “What are we supposed to do now?”
“Is there anything else?” Cas asked as he removed his arm from Dean's shoulders and grabbed his hand instead, in the hopes it would help with his mate's frustration.
“Well, the two of us are gonna get goin' now,” Benny stated. “We were in the middle of a meeting when all of this happened.”
“Two people are paired together, based on their genetic profiles, so that they have the potential to produce the healthiest offspring possible, then one of them receives an Omega implant and the other receives an Alpha implant. Who gets which implant is completely random.”
“Can and will,” she shot back. “Now I want you to go down to the storage unit and get one of those big jars of pickles and bring 'em back up here for Joel to cut up.
“Oh! Oh yes, I remember.” His nose crinkled in displeasure when he also remembered that she was one of Alistair's mates. She seemed nice though, so he didn't say anything about it. “But... what does she have to do with this? Why were you so distressed?” Cas was even more confused now. It took him a moment to puzzle it out, but then it dawned on him. “Wait! Did- did he come here too? Did he do something to you? I swear I'll kill him if he-” Cas tensed up, preparing to jump out of bed to go and hunt down the other Alpha, but Dean stilled him with a hand on his abdomen.
They finally got a proper look at it and determined that, even though the blood was soaking his entire chest, the wound itself was actually closer to his shoulder than they had originally thought. It looked to have missed his heart altogether.
“Yes, without a majority vote,” Gordon interrupted. “Abby, Uriel, Amara and I have all voted to re-open the discussions.”
The thought sort of blind-sided him and he didn't really know what to make of it. The two of them had been thrown together and forced to mate and bond and reproduce, but he – neither of them – had had any choice in the matter. And sure he was fond of the guy. Cas was thoughtful and kind and patient and Dean felt like he could relax and be himself around the Alpha. But when did he start feeling like he
It didn't take too long for their food to get there, although neither of them had an appetite after that bomb was just dropped in their laps. They picked at their food while Charlie continued with her explanations and answered any and all questions that were presented to her.
When Castiel continued to ignore him in favor of beating the living daylights out of their still-cackling neighbor, Dean took action. Unfreezing himself from his spot on the love seat, Dean rushed over to the fray and with no small effort tore his mate away from the raving lunatic.
“Yes, they are,” Cas said, a small smile spreading across his face, “and I couldn't be more proud of anything.”
“Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.” Alfie smiled fondly at Castiel as the Alpha began losing consciousness. “We all have our roles to fill. This one is mine. Just get back to your mate now.”
Everyone turned towards the source of the new voice and saw Jody and Benny standing in the doorway. It was Jody who had spoken.
Alfie obeyed, raising both of his hands at the elbows and turning his wrists over so Cas could see them both. Sure enough, his left arm contained the three red dots that were pulsing just beneath his skin. But as Cas watched, the dots shifted from the red triangular shape, back to the pale vertical line. When that happened, Alfie's breathing returned to normal, his sweat began to dry on his skin, and the smell of his slick began to fade – although it didn't disappear altogether. It was simply drying on his ass and thighs.
As Dean was leaving the bathroom, he opened the door to find his mate standing there with a glass of water and a couple of small, white tablets in hand. “Pain pills,” the Alpha offered in explanation.
“Oh really? Thanks, Amy. I've got it from here.” Amy grunted and stalked off, blond ponytail swaying behind her as she left Caleb to greet Dean on his own. As she left, another Alpha approached from behind a Jeep that had its hood up and a few of its guts strewn about. He wiped his blackened hands on an equally blackened rag as he approached, then reached his slightly less grimy hand towards Dean to shake it. “You must be Dean.”
“Oh, I don't dislike him... I hate him with a passion. As for how I feel? It doesn't really matter, does it? He's the Alpha that I was assigned to, there's very little that can be done about that, and...” she paused looking down at her swelling abdomen, a fond expression softening her features momentarily, but then gone in an instant. “It's not
Jody looked less than impressed at the veiled order, and Benny cut his eyes at Gabriel, but both Beta Councilmen let it go. They silently did as suggested and took their seats where Gabriel had indicated.
. Before either of them realized what they were doing they had each other in their arms, scenting deeply at each other's throats and nosing at the mating marks they'd left on one another.
Cas just watches as orgasm after orgasm is forced from Dean's body, over and over again. Cas doesn't think he'll ever get enough of seeing Dean like this. With his Grace, he can make his hunter come indefinitely, without causing him pain. However, eventually Dean starts coming dry, and that just won't do.
In the center of the black wall was another door with yet another keypad and retinal scanner. However, on the opposite side of the door was a small shelf with a Geiger counter which was currently going off the charts with the amount of radioactivity clinging to whoever passed it as they milled about in the room, waiting for the next step.
“Okay, fine. I'll focus.” He stood up and started pacing the room, gesturing wildly as he spoke. “Should I focus on the fact that my friend was murdered? Huh? Or the fact that the folks responsible are most likely sitting members of this Council? Or the fact that there ain't a
Heaving a sigh, Cas decided that maybe Alfie had had enough. Figuring that the smaller man might need some space, he got up and found his own corner to sit in. He leaned back against the wall, one leg drawn up to his chest, the other sprawled out in front of him. “I'm right over here if you decide you wanna talk some more.” He was met with further silence.
“Dean!” Cas jumped up and moved to help his mate before he fell and hurt himself, or possibly their pups.
“Nmh,” Dean grunted in disapproval. He surged forward, hungrily capturing Cas's lips once more as he reached down and grabbed two large handfuls of Alpha ass and held on tightly in retaliation. It had the added effect of drawing his mate in ever closer, all the better to hold him hostage if need be.
of this place is repopulation. It would be completely counter-productive if we let people have abortions for anything other than medical emergencies. The only way you – or anyone, man or woman – would be permitted to terminate a pregnancy, would be if carrying to term would cause a threat to your life. Even then, every alternative would be explored, including the transplantation the fetus to a womb that
“I don't know, Dean. I'm just as lost as you are,” Castiel interjected. He deftly kept his own frustration out of his voice. Dean was already upset, and he figured at least one of them should try keeping a cool head.
Dean let out a sigh of relief, but then was surprised when Cas reach and hand beneath his head and brought their faces together, causing their lips to meet in the middle. It caused what was left of the air in Dean's lungs to abandon him a whoosh, leaving him light headed and lost. The hand on his dick stilled and he brought both of them up wrap his arms around Castiel. One of them gripping the Angel's back, and the other coming up so he could tangle his fingers through the mess of black hair. Castiel, however, never stopped his assault on Dean's abused hole. He slowed during the kiss, but never stopped.
“We're really glad you're okay, Dean,” Jess said, her face softened in sympathy. Eileen and Donna nodded in agreement.
Little ones were running about, laughing and playing with each other and with the scattering of toys that had been provided to keep them occupied and entertained until they or their parents were called back.
Two of their other neighbors, whom Cas and Dean still had not met, were standing in the hallway looking in at the bloody scene before them. “What happened?” one of them asked. It was another Alpha female with her Omega mate behind her, staring wide-eyed with a hand covering her face. She must have been the one who screamed.
Dean stifled a groan and simply tried to turn his head to dislodge the lobe from the Alpha's mouth, but it was no use; he just didn't have enough range of motion.
“Cas...” Dean finally seemed to see his mate. He relaxed a great deal before he quickly crawled back over to the Alpha and wrapped his arms around his mate and buried his face in the man's neck.
So that was the game! During the last meeting, the Betas and Omegas had agreed that they should abolish the Omega portion of Phase Two after witnessing what had happened to one Omega named Dean. The Alphas, however, didn't see a problem with what had happened. In fact, they thought the Beta and Omega Council members were being a bit silly. It's not like any of the Omegas would
“What're you gonna do about Amy?” Jody asked after a few minutes had passed in silence. “She's a traitor and a danger to others. Hector's lucky to be alive after what she did.”
“Whoa,” Dean breathed. Beneath the tile, there was a digital display screen that was going haywire. It was covered in pickle juice and it was randomly flashing a sequence of numbers and letters. “Crap!” Dean really hoped he wouldn't get into any
, Alistair,” Cas gritted out. If this kept up much longer he was gonna need dentures from having clenched his teeth into dust. Cas took a deep, steadying breath to calm his nerves. If he was gonna get the man back to their apartment so they could talk privately, he was gonna need to cool it down. “Why don't we go back to our place, so we can talk?” Cas suggested.
“We'll figure it out, Dean,” Cas said as he wrapped his arm even tighter around his mate. “We'll figure it out. I promise.”
He also had a career to look forward to, after he healed up. Working in the garage seemed like it would be interesting and challenging. Yeah, his life seemed to be on the upswing and he couldn't wait to get started. They just had a trip to finish and his life could really begin. Despite the difficulties faced, Dean had a lot to look forward to, still.
Also, I'm really sorry it took so long to get this very short chapter posted. I wanted to get Chapter 5 written before I posted this one, and Chapter 5 IS much longer. It took me a while to write it cuz, well you know how Death always comes in threes? Well, that's what I've been dealing with. My great-grandmother, then a family friend/neighbor and finally the son of ANOTHER family friend. It's been a ridiculous couple of weeks. Funerals and lawyers and cops, oh my! So again, sorry this took so long.
After Cas finally dragged his mate out of the bed, with no small amount of grumbling, they grabbed the soiled sheets, along with the clothes they had worn the day before, and tossed them down the laundry shoot in their hallway. After that, the two of them hopped in the shower for a much-needed scrubbing before they finally left their apartment for Dean's appointment, about an hour after waking.
“A null odor,” she repeated. “The hospital, as well as the clinics, can be quite overwhelming to olfactory senses, especially to the little ones,” she gestured to the running and bouncing pups with her chin, “so they squirt the stuff through the vents, to keep the scents of distress, pain, fear and other emotions from overwhelming us and the kiddies. They don't spray it everywhere though, just places like this.”
Dean and Cas stepped into the space which was already lit and inviting. It was a large apartment, despite Charlie warning that it'd be a bit smaller than usual. Hardwood floors, glass and metal coffee table, plush leather sofa. The far wall contained a floor-to-ceiling 'window' that displayed the rain, which was beginning to clear. To the left of the entryway was a kitchenette and through the living room and to the right they could see a hallway that led to the rest of the unit.
“Tell me about it,” Dean winced as his shoulder twinged slightly. Jess shot the other Omega a sympathetic look. If anyone deserved their pound of flesh, it was Dean.
Before either of them could protest further, the water wall suddenly fell away. They both stood there, stunned, as the wall lowered itself down and back, creating a wide ramp that led down to a floor about five feet down. Beyond it was another room, except this one wasn't as bright. It looked almost like an empty warehouse, but it wasn't quite as big, and there was still an absence of windows. The walls were a dark grey and there was carpeting covering the entire area. The ceiling was white and there was a light emanating from it, and just like their room, no source could be determined, as if the light was coming from the surface itself.
the happiness flowing off of the Alpha in waves. Maybe if he was lucky he could be infested with some of that happiness too. Well, he could at least
“Mmm,” Dean grumbled. He took a deep inhale, smelling nothing but the comforting aroma of oak and cinnamon. Without opening his eyes, he sniffed out the point where the scent was the strongest and burrowed deeply into it. He was rewarded with a pleased rumble and a strong arm encircling him as it drew him closer to the source of the scent.
“Dean?” Cas shook the other man's shoulder gently. When that failed to rouse him, Cas leaned in and ran his lips across the mating mark on the spot where his shoulder met his neck. He planted soft kisses there as he reached around to Dean's back, running a hand along his spine. “Dean...” Cas called out again, his voice a deep rumble in the Omega's ear.
!” Dean was suddenly being slid forward from the wall behind him. He quickly scrambled to his feet and spun around to assess the new threat.
“Worse than that, brothah,” Benny explained. “They replaced you and Anna with those stooges: Gordon and Amara. Now they're lookin' to get rid of us too. Replace us with someone else.”
Dean quickly located the strange tile he'd found and crouched down in front of it, trying to study it and find out what made it different from the others. Using his fingertips, he felt around the edges going up and down each of the four sides. After a few moments, he felt like he might be able to lift it from the floor if only he had a bit more leverage.
“Okay,” Jody said with finality. If Benny was willing to put his trust in the woman, then she would too, because she trusted
, though'. And when that happened, they would fail to examine their own thoughts and behaviors, which would then lead to a failure to change and better themselves. When the fact is:
, so that means he must have had it at some point... right? Nevertheless, the thought of biting into one of the flaky, gooey treats made his mouth water.
Startled, he jumped back, removing his digits from the stream, and inspecting his hand. There was nothing on it. Not even a few errant specks of water. His hand was completely dry, but it did seem a bit... cleaner? He glanced at Dean again, then back at the water. It had turned back into the crystal clear waters that were there to begin with.
Now it was Benny's turn to release a mighty groan. To Cas, he said, “We're never gonna hear the end of this, are we?”
What has happened to the Council! It had only been a couple days since they last convened. Benny had only been home for a day and a half of that time, so far. He wanted to weep for the loss of his good friend and colleague. He wanted to comfort sweet Anna in her time of suffering, even though he knew he couldn't. Since she was no longer a member of the Council, she would have had her mind erased again. She would know that she'd served on the Council, but she would know none of the details. As a result, she wouldn't even be mourning the death of Gabriel.
He stepped back just far enough for the petite Beta to exit the apartment, but he didn't leave yet. “It was
Benny's shoulders drooped slightly at that. She had a point, but he still didn't want to back down. It was his duty to protect the members of his community and that included Dean.
“Yes,” Cas agreed. “This is all pretty overwhelming. I mean, we woke up today naked and trapped. Now we're being taken on a tour of a massive underground facility and told we're part of a repopulation effort and Dean's
The attention finally got Dean's notice and the Omega opened his eyes wide to watch his mate as the Alpha worshiped his body. Dean watched as Cas continued lower, gently kissing Dean's abdomen, dipping his tongue into his bellybutton. He dragged his tongue down until it reached the elastic band of Dean's boxer briefs where he planted one more kiss. Then, Cas hooked his fingers on the waistband and pulled them down and out of the way.
“Jody and Benny had some 'stuff' they wanted to discuss,” Gabriel supplied with air quotes and a sour look on his face. “They said they'd join us 'soon'. Whatever that means.”
“After she left, and I got those first flashes, I tried to just brush it off. But, man, they just kept comin'. I don't know what the hell is happening, Cas.” He had been staring off into space as he recounted his experience, but now he turned his tear-filled eyes on his mate.
“We have a plan, though,” Jody added. “Hopefully we can get that portion of Phasing eradicated for good.”
“Yes! There are simulations, non-invasive experimentation and plenty of other options-” Benny was cut off by Uriel.
The next morning, Dean and Cas awoke to the brightening of the lights in their bedroom. Dean groaned in disapproval and rolled over, burying his face into the pillow roll under his head, disentangling himself from his Alpha's grip as he did so. This caused a similar groan of disapproval from the Alpha as he blindly stretched out his now-empty arm in search of his mate.
“Mm. Mornin' Sunshine,” Dean peeked up at his mate from beneath his eyelashes and smiled contentedly.
Cas reached down between them, bypassing Dean's hard and aching dick and went straight for the man's leaking and twitching hole. Never removing his lips from his Omega's, Cas circled his middle finger around the tight and increasingly wet ring of muscle a few times before delving in all the way to the bottom knuckle.
Dean sighed at the idea of four walls inside of four more walls, before shaking his head and turning back around to catch up with Cas and Charlie. The little redhead could move fast for someone so small, and the two men had to nearly jog to keep up with her. They didn't go too far though; there was a door at the other end of the larger room, and they went through it. Charlie went through first, with Cas and Dean close behind.
They were both silent as they absorbed this newest mind-fuck. After a few moments, Cas reached across the small space separating them and took Dean's hand in his. “It'll be okay, Dean. We'll figure this out.”
“Yes, and there's Donna,” Cas added as he saw the Beta woman who'd done Dean's ultrasound. “What a pleasant surprise.”
“Really? That's it?” Dean seemed even more shocked than Cas. Surely murder would lend much more severe repercussions than a mere 20 hours of community service. Right?
“Uh, yeah!” Dean said, glancing at Cas as they both stood. He took a deep breath to steady himself, then they made their way over to the door, the pretty nurse smiling and holding the door open for them as they passed through.
Soon enough, the Jeep straightened out and the spiraling stopped. However, they were still ascending.
Doesn't matter. Someone's communicating with them, so Dean's damn sure gonna communicate back. "HEY!" he shouts in between pants, "HEY, LET US OUT OF HERE!!!" However, they were simply met with the same command.
Dean's feet had been shuffling nervously as he stood in front of the two Beta leaders. He knew that he'd receive a punishment of
distraught over Gabriel's death,” Abby explained, her voice and features dripping with mock sympathy. “She just couldn't see staying in office for even another day. So we took pity on her. It seemed cruel to make her stay any longer than she could stand.”
Try as he might, he couldn't help but notice... everything. He noticed that he, thankfully, didn't feel any pain when Cas's (admittedly
“Yeah. Those guys.” Gabriel accepted the information, but refused to acknowledge the source. “So until then we're gonna hang around Benny's facility. So you can't get rid of us just yet.” Gabriel winked at Dean with a playful smirk.
The two of them let out simultaneous groans. Dean threw his head back, exposing his neck. Cas took advantage of the angle and latched his lips to the stretch of flesh. Dean moaned again and bucked his hips up slightly, trying to get a bit of friction to his neglected cock. Failing that, he reached between their stomachs to wrap a hand around the swollen member but was hindered by Cas's hand suddenly appearing on his wrist. Dean growled in frustration but was still inexplicably turned on by the show of dominance as Cas placed both of Dean's arms above his head and pinned them there. Cas continued lavishing his attention on Dean's neck. The Omega was about ready to cum already, and they'd barely started.
“Right,” Dean sighed. The whole situation was messed up. He kind of wanted to be friends with the guy, but it's kind of hard to reconcile the fact that he
“Dean, Castiel, could you join us back out here, please?” Jody said as she poked her head through the couple's bedroom door.
Cas's dick was bigger now than it was when he first met Dean. It was longer and thicker, and of course it had the perpetual swelling at the base which never went away, only grew larger when he was aroused, swelling to completion during climax. He focused mainly on stroking his huge shaft until his fingers constantly grazed his knot, then he started focusing more and more attention to it instead. Testing out the waters, he squeezed tightly around the knot, and nearly shouted in ecstasy as pleasure radiated through his entire lower body and shot straight to the tip of his dick.
The Alpha let out a gasp that matched the technician's. “Oh, Dean...” Cas said, voice filled with wonder, his expression shifting to match.
After this, there are two more chapters and a short epilogue. Then the timestamps will come after that.
Cas, being a bit more sensible, also grabbed a few of the burgers, but he also piled a few of the neglected veggies onto his platter as well. The two of them settled onto the floor and tucked into their food. They sat side-by-side against one of the walls. They ate together in companionable silence, although still maintaining a respectful distance from one another.
Benny said, “Yep. Sounds like trouble.” He hid the strain in his voice well and forced his shoulders to relax and keep from tensing, so as not to tip Donna off that something more serious was afoot. “I'll go check on things.”
This, however, was an unscheduled meeting, and while he was glad that he didn't need to brave the outside in full gear with an accompanying team, he was still worried about the topic of discussion. Unscheduled meetings were only called in the event of an emergency.
After a few moments, Cas continued, though in a much calmer voice, his hands easing their pressurized grip. “I don't
Noticing the subtle challenge, Amy squared her shoulders and dropped her previously crossed arms down to her sides, though to her credit she managed not to ball her hands into fists. She did, however, let out a low, warning growl from deep in her chest.
It was long and rectangular, and Dean, once again, could not identify a source of light, though the room was very well lit. The door they'd just gone through was made of a clear glass that could be seen through, however, the back wall was made of an opaque material that was completely blacked out, hiding whatever could be on the other side. And the shorter walls on either side of the rectangular room were made of cement.
Suddenly, the water fountain and the shower both stopped flowing, leaving the wall where they were stationed empty.
Cas chuckled good-naturedly. “Let's go find you something then.” He reached out and Dean linked the fingers of his free hand with Cas's, then the two of them made their way through the corridors and back towards the kitchen.
“Yes, I'm sure,” Charlie answered sardonically, but she still smiled at the Alpha as she turned and opened the door. Her exit was impeded, however, by an unexpected guest in the hallway, blocking her path.
Another ten minutes and Dean spotted Jody heading their way, with a backpack slung over one shoulder. “Hey, Cas. There's Jody.” He pointed out the Councilman to his mate and the two of them got out of the Jeep to greet her.
“That makes sense,” Cas confirmed with a nod, recalling his own medical knowledge. “I should have put that together earlier. Omegas typically begin morning sickness weeks sooner than Betas.” He looked at his mate apologetically.
wouldn't sign off on such atrocities! No, no... nothing about this seemed right. None of it seemed right
Two of the other Alphas broke away from the group in the living room and did as their commander told them. The two in the doorway scattered when they saw the burly guardsmen coming at them. Silas and Phil shrugged their shoulders at the easy job and were about to head back, but the two lookie-loos who left were quickly replaced by three more, then five. Before they knew it, they were overrun by nosy neighbors who just wouldn't get the hint.
Cas cautiously walked the around the squishy area, testing the boundaries and seeing how far it went. It didn't seem
“You're tellin' me!” Dean replied with a chuckle. They continued exchanging kisses, on their necks and their shoulders, before gradually shifting back to each other's lips. They languidly explored each other's mouths for a while before a thought struck Dean. “Wait,” he said, breaking the kiss and pulling back to look Cas in the eyes.
Cas nodded in understanding. “I know. I didn't like him either.” Cas relaxed a bit and stood up straight as he pulled Dean further into his arms. He squeezed Dean a little tighter as he felt the other man beginning to tremble slightly. “Dean...” Cas began worried, “are you sure there's nothing else? What's wrong?”
Before answering, Jody wandered over to the snack bar and grabbed two glasses from a shelf, then snatched up a bottle full of amber liquid and made her way back to Benny with her burdens.
together, eh?” At that, the spunky little vixen looked back to the two of them over her shoulder, waggling her eyebrows suggestively, before turning back to her task.
“So,” Dean began after a few minutes of comfortable silence, “Gabe. Now that the Alpha Councilmen are taken care of, can't you guys go back to your facility now?”
“Well, that's easy to explain,” she continued, after taking another bite from her apple, which was half gone by that point. She removed her feet from the coffee table and half turned so that she was facing Dean, one foot on the floor and the other bent in front of her on the couch. “It's called Alpha Voice. Capital V. It's a biological side-effect that Alphas developed. I don't think the guys in charge meant for that little development to arise – or maybe they did... whatever,” she waved away the thought. “Anyways, Alphas can use it to control their Omegas. Make them
“Thank you, Marco. Hold all of mah calls and reschedule my other appointments. I dunno how long this is gonna take.”
“Well. There's 12 private bedrooms plus a communal living space; 3 communal bathrooms; a fitness/entertainment space; kitchen and food storage – enough to last a few years; and a surveillance room. Among other things. There are also a couple of side entrances, in case the main entrance is compromised and we need to escape the bunker for some reason.”
“Uh, well...” Benny shifted uncomfortably before he answered, “I actually had their memories erased of any knowledge pertaining to this project. The only other person I'd told about his place was Gabriel, and well...” He trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid.
“Jess...” Sam eased forward, hoping to pull his pregnant mate away from the hostile Alpha. His own protective instincts flaring up once more.
Cas reached down with one hand, stroking the side of Dean's thigh before hooking his fingers around the back of his knee and hiking his leg up and over his back. Dean took the hint and wrapped both of his legs around Cas back. Once that was done, Cas continued slowly stroking Dean's hard and leaking member, eliciting a litany of gasps and moans from the man beneath him. Periodically, he would pause and stroke his thumb over the tip, smearing precum over the head.
Cas, for his part, ignored the Omega. For now. He just wanted to ensure the health and safety of his mate and pups. He wouldn't apologize for that, though he suspected that he'd pay for it later.
“Pretty good, and yourself?” Hector shook Dean's hand in greeting as soon as the Omega was within reach.
“Good,” Cas gently pulled away from Dean and moved to stand up. “You wait here. I'll get you some eggs and toast.”
“I'll see you guys around,” Charlie said as she followed Benny and the cleaning crew out of the door. “And I still wanna catch that lecture with you, Castiel.”
The next morning, Dean awoke, sore and grumpy, his stomach was unsettled and his shoulder ached miserably. Castiel tried his best to alleviate his mate's discomfort, but even the pain pills that the Alpha always somehow had did nothing to dull the ache. Although, Cas's scent did wonders for the Omega's tummy problems.
Tears threatened to spill from Dean's eyes as he was pounded into against his will by a stranger, yet again. He just didn't understand why this was happening to him. Why
“Well, that's the thing with mental illness: sometimes you can just never tell,” one of the new-comers spoke, this one coming from the screen that used to be occupied by Gabriel.
Cas's dick was hanging hard and neglected between their stomachs, leaking precum onto his mate, marking him with his scent. The Alpha growled possessively as he added another finger to his mate's sopping wet hole. His index finger aided in the task, stretching Dean even further, preparing the man for Cas's huge Alpha cock.
uncomfortably and he was filled with an intense longing. He tried to mentally shake himself of the unpleasant feeling, but it was persistent. He tried to ignore it, but it would not be ignored.
They each nodded at the Beta. Lilith and Ruby crossed their arms in impatience and indignation; Adam looked nervous and ready to bolt; Bela looked as if she wanted to throttle Lilith; and Meg seemed purely bored with the whole affair, leaning against a wall and apparently chewing a piece of gum. Where the hell did she get gum?
“Hm?” Dean responded, not paying much attention to his mate, still focusing too much on the children around them.
He could feel Dean's his hole, which was drenched and stretched so beautifully around his cock, fluttering around the intrusion and clenching down on the member as it dragged in and out at a punishing speed. His dick seemed to be growing impossibly larger as a bulbous swelling at the base suddenly formed, catching on the rim of Dean's tightening ass and binding them together as they each screamed and grunted out their release. Dean once again painted their chests a milky white as his orgasm crashed over him.
Dean just shook his head and didn't speak for a few moments. He just stood there in Cas's arms, breathing in the scent of safety and home that was uniquely Cas. After a moment he answered, “I really don't know, man. I just... I don't wanna see him again. Like ever!”
“Sorry, I forgot to warn you. Don't worry, you'll get used to the scents. Or so I'm told. I can't really smell anything.”
After a second of confusion, Charlie finally caught on. “Oh! Yeah. Sorry. These aren't windows we're seeing. They're just displays. They're supposed to simulate windows and a scenic view of 'outside' so that we forget that we're underground. People tend to go a little nuts if they don't get a glimpse of the sun every now and then. Or, ya know, weather.” Charlie jerked her thumb in the direction of the display behind her.
Dean groaned slightly, feeling empty as Cas fully withdrew from him. Once they were separated, he got a better look at their torsos. Seeing the mess that he'd caused there he groaned even louder, this time in disgust. He wrinkled his nose at the gooey and sticky coating covering both of their bodies and announced, “Dude, we both need a shower. Now.”
“Charlie... explain!” Cas demanded of the Beta, who legitimately looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Well, it's time for a new vote,” Abby stated, sounding far too happy. “All in favor of reinstating policy number 3698: the Omega portion of Phase Two, say 'aye'.”
The tour concluded with the three of them stopping off in one of the dining halls for dinner. Charlie had obviously planned it that way. Cas and Dean weren't complaining though. The little Beta moved fast, and the two of them were thankful for the chance to sit down and get some much-needed sustenance into their bodies.
vote,” Jody protested, her face shadowed in anger, much like Benny's. “We need a four-out-of-six agreement for anything to pass!”
Dean turned and faced the source of the voice. “Oh... heya, Benny. You uh- you wouldn't mind tellin' me how to get outta here, would ya?”
Dean's words did nothing to soothe the ache in his mate's heart. The Alpha wreaked of guilt and distress, and Dean could tell that nothing he could say would assuage his mate.
it's gonna be the biggest one yet. But then it just... stops. The come never leaves his shaft, it just hovers there, near the tip of his cock, but never spilling over. “Shit! Cas-
“That's true.” They were silent for a beat, then Jody said, “So, I'm assuming we're heading for this surveillance room of yours?”
“Yes, the process of becoming either an Alpha or an Omega, which you and Dean have recently completed.”
“I still don't like this,” Cas grumbled as they sat in their designated vehicle that Caleb had pointed out to them. They had gotten packed the night before while Dean explained the entire situation to his mate. Everything from finding the hidden passage in the supply room of Ellen's kitchen, and all of the events that followed. “You should stay
Benny turned on his heel and took off in the way he'd came at a decent clip. Jody followed close behind while Dean brought up the rear. They flew down the halls passing doorway after doorway that Dean itched to explore but was unable to, given the circumstances. He wondered what the big hurry could possibly be. Surely there couldn't be anything quite so pressing in a place like this.
“Oh, that wasn't your room,” Charlie announced from halfway inside another wardrobe, without looking back at them. Her back end was comically dangling from in opening as she appeared to be swimming in a sea of fabrics, causing most of the contents to cascade outwards in her relentless search. “It was just made to
...to see that Cas had turned around in his seat and was staring dead at him. Benny seemed to be ignoring what happened, probably sensing that the two of them would want to discuss it amongst themselves. But Cas. Cas was just...
They rode in silence the rest of the way. The minutes ticked by and Dean's legs were crawling with anticipation. He fidgeted in his seat constantly, which caused his suit to crinkle and squeak with almost every move and shift of his weight.
Dean groaned, but still did as he was told. The kitchen's storage unit was on a completely different floor, so of course, it was gonna take him longer than his designated time to finish the new task. Frustrated, he trudged to the back of the kitchen, in the opposite direction he had been heading in order to leave.
“What-” Dean started, then paused when his parched throat threatened to close. He suppressed a cough, knowing instinctively that doing so would result in a very bad time. He tried again, “What happened?”
a pain.” She turned back to Dean and Cas and said, “Is it okay if he joins us? If it's too much, then just say so and I can send this big galoot packing!”
Cas merely shrugged unapologetically. “My... protectiveness wouldn't let me stay away for long; and once you were stable I saw no reason for there to be so many people around you.”
Dean was going to protest and refuse the suggestion to sit, but then Cas said, “Listen to her Dean. You need to relax. Just have a seat.”
Dean just kept staring at the swelling. The attention started making Cas uncomfortable, so he tried covering himself. He's sure Dean finds the growth disgusting, or displeasing at the least. He started shifting his legs so his dick fell further between his legs and started moving his hands so they covered most of it, but Dean stopped him.
“Alright,” Hector said, checking the clock on the wall of his repair section, “we're running low on time here. For now, I think I've taught you just about everything you're gonna need to know. Do you got any questions for me? Last chance.”
“Alright, let's get moving,” Jody commanded, clapping her hands in front of her. “We've got a lot to get done to get Gabriel safe, and a lot more to do
“We didn't see the need to bother you two with it, seeing as we already had a majority ruling,” Uriel said.
It took a moment for either of them to answer. Castiel was fantasizing about what it would feel like to tear the other Alpha's dick off and shove it down his lecherous throat. Dean was pushing back mild panic, though he wasn't so freaked out that he couldn't think about the fact that he'd have to toss the whole couch out once Alistair had vacated it. There's no way that smell was going to follow its owner out the door.
“Shall we?” Benny asked, grinning at Jody. He swept his arm in front of him in a grand gesture. “Ladies first, my dear.”
him to find release. He thinks he may actually die from the intensity of it all. Is that even possible? Is that a thing? It doesn't matter. It's happening to him, and he's gonna lose his freaking mind.
“It looks like they got here shortly after we did,” Benny continued. “Made themselves nice and comfy a little ways down the road. Seems like they're planning an ambush for us.”
“Alright.” Cas sighed. He didn't know what to make of this information. He seemed to just be accumulating even more questions. Cas, who had been facing Alfie with the wall to his left, turned so that he could rest his back against the wall. He thumped his head back and looked at the ceiling. Alfie did the same, resting his back against the same wall, though he did it without thumping his head. After a few minutes, Cas continued, still looking at the ceiling. “Will I get to see Dean again?”
“Dean!” He placed his hands on both of his mates shoulders, looking the other man up and down as if he might be able to visibly see the cause of the Omega's distress. “Are you okay? What is it?”
“It'll be okay, Dean,” Charlie tried again to placate the Omega. “Just take your meals in one of the dining halls. They've got an even larger variety than what you got in your room. And...” Charlie made her way over to the kitchenette and opened one of the cabinets, “you can make smoothies here!” She triumphantly held up a blender.
“I dunno. Prolly the same reason I didn't notice yours.” Dean sniffed at Cas again before something dawned on him. “Dude, why'd I gotta smell all fruity?” he asked petulantly. “I get the girly water colors earlier, now the fruity smell. What the hell?”
While Cas had been working, Dean's naughty hand and wondered to his throbbing cock and had begun furiously pounding away, still achingly desperate for a release that is yet to come. Cas thinks about removing the offending appendage, but then thinks better of it. Dean can stroke himself as much as he wants, but it won't change the fact that he won't come until Castiel is ready for him to.
“But the thing is,” Rufus continued, “you just gotta realize that things are run a certain way down here. You don't have a whole lotta choices about how your life is run, and I suppose it
“Sir, I'm so sorry,” Marco, Benny's Omega assistant and secretary interrupted, “I know you're in a meeting with Councilmember Jody at the moment, but there's been an emergency. We need you right away, sir!” The young Asian man stood in the corridor outside the conference room, looking nervous and twitchy as he waited for the Beta to respond.
“Yup.” Hector let the info sink in for a moment, then said, “Welp, the duffles are over there. Help yourself to a couple. You guys are gonna come back down here to get a vehicle and some more supplies before you head out, so I'll be seeing you before you leave. Good luck, man.”
They walked along the hall for a short while, shoulders bumping and fingers grazing each other slightly. Eventually, they gave in and simply interlocked their fingers together as they walked side-by-side, the unpleasantness of a few hours ago nearly forgotten as they just enjoyed each other's company.
“Now you're going to find out why you're here.” Alfie sighed as he unfolded himself from his drawn up position in his corner, and slowly made his way to the center of the room. Cas could see that he was fully erect and now that he was paying attention, he could tell that the smaller man was covered in a thin sheen of sweat as well. He didn't need to see Alfie's wrist to know that there was a red arrow on it and that it was pointing down.
The Omega paused with his hands resting on his hood, looking at the others with open confusion and irritation.
Cas wasn't too far behind. He came with a gasp and a moan, filling Dean up with his seed before he finally stopped thrusting. His hips twitched forward a few more times, his dick pulsing just a few more spurts before he stilled completely. He groaned in Dean's ear, sounding almost like a growl, before he shifted, attempting to dislodge himself from the man below him. Given the situation, he doubts Dean is going to want him to stay on top of him for much longer than necessary. And just as he predicted, Dean spoke up on the matter.
“Oh,” Dean said sheepishly. He raised the correct arm to the clock face and a blue light immediately illuminated his arm. A positive beep sounded from the clock and his name momentarily replaced the time, before fading back to its original display. “That's it?”
part, thank you very much. It took a bit of finagling, what with one arm out of commission, but he managed well enough.
“Well,” Donna started, “when I headed to the kitchen to check on everyone I heard shouting. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but by the time I got there they had quieted down and everyone was glaring at Amy. And wouldn't ya know, that ornery Alpha looked as smug as the cat who got the cream.”
Cas gave his hips a little test wiggle before giving a small sigh. “No. Looks like we're stuck together again.”
“Oh, ya. This is gonna be a hoot!” Donna exclaimed, a large grin plastered to her face. “So, how's our boy been doin'?”
“Yeah, that was my thinkin' too.” There was a moment's pause, then Benny said, “So when ya wanna get started?”
Al sniffed the air subtly, closing his eyes as he did so. When he opened them, he made eye contact first with Dean, then slowly slid his gaze to Cas. A wicked grin spreading itself across his face, slick as oil.
“Yeah...” Sam said before either of the Beta Councilman could answer. “You guys said you had a plan to stop them... and now you have them.” He cut them a dangerous look. “Was
“Wait, you want me to go with you? Where?” Dean asked. He frowned slightly as he looked between the two Betas in confusion.
Cas's words caused a small spark to ignite inside his chest, causing him to feel warm and light. His voice broke slightly, eyes welling up as he said, “Well... they're part of
“Alrighty, so, schpiel it is,” Charlie said cheerfully. “Also, I just like to say 'schpiel'. It's a fun word. Schpiel. Hehe.” Charlie shook herself, then said, “Sorry, sorry. Anyways, you are here as a part of a recovery effort.”
“Like I said, it was a test. If you had taken the bait, then you'd be put back in the roster for mating assignment and you'd keep repeating Phases One and Two until you no longer felt the need to 'mate' with the bait Omega. In that instance, I'd only be having this conversation with Dean right now. But since you
Once Cas was finally satisfied, he grabbed his aching cock and lined it up with Dean's prepped and flowing hole before slowly pressing in with one long, slow stroke. Dean groaned loudly as he was filled up so beautifully with his mate's monster cock. Cas didn't stop until he was fully seated inside and he finally let out a low groan of his own.
After a few moments, Jody dropped her hand and met Benny's worried gaze with one of her own. “I don't know, really.” She turned and rested her back against an empty wall, arms crossed as she thought. “All we can really do at this point is go along with the plan, and hope nothing goes sideways.”
finally took pity and removed him from the situation. He was given different living arrangements and also... a different job assignment.” Meg seemed unhappy about whatever it was she was remembering. When she spoke again she said, “Poor Alfie. I'd never willingly put myself in the same situation.”
“Well I did say 'stereotypically',” Charlie responded placatingly. “Not everyone fits into the mold. You are an obvious exception to most rules here. But most Alphas fit that proverbial mold perfectly.” Charlie wisely avoided mentioning that Cas seemed to be getting upset pretty easily at the moment. “Omegas, on the other hand, are stereotypically more submissive and docile. Though, they are fiercely protective of their homes and especially their pups.” She looked pointedly at Dean as she said that last part.
a tough one. “Alright, so, there's a bunch of things,” Dean began. “If the car is havin' trouble shifting gears, that's a big clue. Also, if there's grinding or whining noises that come from it when gears are tryna change. If the transmission fluid is leaking and if you smell burning transmission fluid when you get out, that's a big clue too.”
“Okay,” Dean said in acknowledgment of their confession, “so... why? Why did I have to – you know...?” He trailed off, not wanting to fully give voice to it. He shifted uncomfortably where he stood and waited for the Betas to continue.
Dean found it really sweet that Cas was so concerned with his comfort. They'd had a really rocky start. At first, he didn't even want Cas to touch him – at all – but something had changed drastically. Maybe their captives were pumping some sort of mind-altering chemicals into the air. Or injecting hormones into them through the subdermal implants. Whatever it was, he could deny Cas this simple request. Hell, at this point he would gladly do anything Cas told him to do, question or not. And
Dean looked disbelieving. “So you're saying if I were to ride you, the arrows would switch positions or something? Like mine would point up, and yours down?”
“There's another thing. If you read his file too, then you know about-” Benny paused and glanced over at Dean, knowing the nosy Omega was definitely eavesdropping. Benny lowered his voice even further and leaned closer to Jody so he could say the next part without Dean overhearing.
“I swear, doc,” Dean interrupted, his voice heavy still with tears as he sat up, no longer leaning on Cas, “if you gimme some bullshit schpiel about the 'greater good' or some crap like that-”
“Yeah. I'll see ya,” Rufus answered kindly, actually managing what could possibly pass as a genuine smile. Donna smiled back at him, then made a hasty retreat, opening the door, then closing it behind herself with a soft click.
Cas led the way as his giggles died down, with Dean following behind him. The Alpha had to keep himself from falling over with laughter at the way his mate was walking. Eventually, Dean righted himself and began walking with a gait that resembled something normal.
“Uniforms?” The pair spoke simultaneously once again, giving each other an exasperated look that clearly said
a lifetime of getting to know you to realize what an amazing person you are. I can look into your eyes and know
Dean took a deep breath and spared another glance at the hazmat suits before grabbing a couple of duffle bags from a shelf and taking off. He headed back up to his and Cas's apartment. Hopefully, the Alpha would have gotten there by now. He had a
Donna smiled at him and said, “Oh, nothing's wrong. It just takes a minute to find, don't you worry. Just sit tight, alrighty?”
“Hey, guys. Hey, Charlie,” the big Beta wrapped an arm around his wife's shoulders and gave her a friendly peck on the temple.
See endnotes for trigger warning. I didn't want to put them here in because they contain mild spoilers.
“Mmmm, still so desperate for it?” He licked his way up Dean's neck to his ear, stopping to suck the lobe into his mouth and nibble on the bit of flesh.
” She turned back around to continue her trek, but then suddenly halted and turned back to them. “Oh, by the way. My name is Charlie. Designation: Beta. And I'm
stay, I go!” He took two steps towards the door, but then stopped dead in his tracks and actually jumped back a couple steps when the door was suddenly swung wide open.
“I couldn't tell you.” Alfie shrugged. After a moment, his brow knit in concern as he seemed to think of something. “And actually, now that I think about it, you may
“Yeah. That sounds like a good idea,” Benny admitted. His shoulders drooped slightly, but he still beamed at his colleague.
“Guys,” Sam interjected, “we should at least give them a chance to defend themselves before we start making accusations.”
” the interviewer sounded bored, as if she'd been dealing with the man's shenanigans all day and had, therefore, developed an immunity to his charms, “
“Yes. We all do. Everyone here had to go through similar processes.” Charlie answered. “Well, except for the Betas like me. We had to have our memories erased, just like you guys, Dean's brother and his mates - literally every other Omega and Alpha - but us Betas didn't have to go through the Conversion process.”
“Yes!” Cas pulled away for a moment to look Dean in the eyes before he lowered himself back down, tilting his head to on side, giving Dean better access. He gently planted kisses on Dean's shoulder as he waited.
“Uh, no. I think there's plenty to see,” the Alpha in the doorway said, looking around with wide eyes to prove her point. “Who's the pile o' hamburger?” She pointed at Al's corpse.
Cas doesn't seem happy with that answer, but he apparently has no better suggestions so he just finds a corner and plops down. Dean does the same, going straight back to the same corner he was in before, knees pulled up to his chest, hands resting on his knees. He tries his damnedest not to stare at the other man, who doesn't appear to be affected by his nudity at all. One of his legs is stretched out in front of him and his arm is resting on the knee of his other leg that just slightly bent. He looks relaxed- or as relaxed as one can be in a situation like this.
Dean let out a mighty groan and flopped back in his seat once again. “Nobody cares about my suffering, my
It didn't take long for them to get the shocked Omega unclothed and into the shower first, in order to wash away the blood that had started to cake onto his skin. Once he was cleaned of all of the red, Cas filled the tub and let Dean sink down into the water, which Cas had scented with soothing lavender oil that he found under the sink.
It was paused at the beginning, on the image of a man, from the chest up. The Alpha and Omega both gasped as they beheld the face of Dean, stubble-chinned, leather jacket, black and red plaid shirt and a cocky grin, which seemed to be aimed at a person just off-screen.
that?! Maybe his conversation with Meg had gotten him on edge? Yeah, that's gotta be it. What else could it possibly be?
Dean turned his head and stared at the monitor, though he wasn't quite sure what he was seeing. Cas, on the other hand, seemed to know exactly what he was looking at.
Cas's growing grin completely cracked his face wide open as he looked up and the glistening, emerald eyes of his Omega, still slightly damp from tears unshed. “
Plus, I've recently discovered I have ADHD which comes with this lovely little bastard called executive dysfunction, so sometimes even when I had the time and desire to write I just... couldn't.
he say? They'd already spent ages discussing all of this with Charlie, and remembering it all just made him bone-wary and tired and he just wanted to rest and try to forget some of what had happened in the past few hours.
Just like that Dean was cumming hard, untouched. He shouted and his body seized up as he squirted rope after rope of cum onto their chests and stomachs. His mouth opened in a wide O as his hips once again began thrusting up, meeting his mates pounding cock. Once his own cock stopped spurting, he lied boneless on the bed as Cas chased his own orgasm.
Conference Room A did, however, boast a rather impressive snack and beverage bar to one side. It was reminiscent of a bar one might see in a tavern, complete with countertop and an array of beverages and snacks on display behind it, though it was available for any occupants to help themselves.
Dean looked around at his family. He had his mate by his side and his brother and in-laws all around him. Spending time with them would be the best thing he could imagine and he couldn't be happier about their situation.
Cas and Dean looked confused for a moment, but then Charlie explained. “Benny is one of the six members of the Council and, as such, he has his own facility to run: this one.” She sounded almost as if she were bragging and proud of the accomplishments of her fellow Beta. “As a matter of fact,” she continued, “he's supposed to be at a Council meeting at the Bermuda facility.” She turned to the other Beta, clearly expecting an explanation.
“And we're not gonna erase your memory again, either. We both feel like you've been through enough, brutha,” Benny said.
Cas touched the bulbous - and slightly purple - swelling gingerly with his index and middle finger, but then immediately let out a sharp gasp as his hips involuntarily jerked forward.
Amy smirked like she knew something that Benny didn't. “Yeah,” she shrugged. “Wanted to stretch my legs a bit before we got going. Decided to walk around a bit.”
“Okay. Thank you, Alfie. You can put them down now.” Alfie complied, then just stood there, apparently waiting for another command. This Alfie was much different from the frightened and withering thing he was introduced to. Did the command to 'mate' change something in him? “Alfie, are you okay?”
She smiled and winked at him and Dean had to accept the whole 'be patient' thing, even though that didn't seem to be in his nature whatsoever. Regardless, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and tried to relax.
“Yes. Henhouses. And in a henhouse, you have one rooster and multiple hens. That way, you get a pretty decent egg production, right?”
Once Dean calmed down, he noticed that the flow was quick but gentle, and he didn't even feel a current. He would have expected them all to be knocked off of their feet as the water surged around them, but nothing of the sort happened and they remained upright.
Dean nodded. He did remember. He mourned the loss of a brother that he didn't even know. At least not anymore.
Once they were back inside their bedroom, the two of them undressed and climbed beneath the covers. Dean rolled into Cas's arms and the Alpha embraced his mate as the Omega let out a deep and contented sigh. He snuggled into Cas's neck, scenting him deeply and taking comfort from his mate.
“That would be fine with me as well,” Cas answered Dean. To Benny, he said, “You can get a plate and join us.”
To Benny's left, Jody was also issuing similar orders to her own captain, with additional orders for their medics to tend to any injuries and see to the dead. Lives were lost, but luckily the vast majority of their people had survived.
?!” Dean spluttered, disbelievingly, turning in his seat so he could look the Angel in the face. Why would Cas do something like that? While he was driving, no less! “Cas, buddy, listen-”
“Not now, Dean!” Both Betas nearly shouted in unison before they turned their attentions back to each other.
*Phew* Made it! Wasn't sure if I'd be able to post this today. Had a catastrophic malfunction the other day when my document crashed and I lost half of my progress on this chapter. Had to do some breakneck typing over the past few days just to catch up and then finish, but I made it! Yay me!
“Of course!” that was Abby. “We plan on having Alphas running each of the facilities soon. There's a promising young man named Eldon who's set to take over for Jody.”
Also, I feel I should mention that I will not be able to get any photos of the Alpha, Beta and Omega uniforms for you guys. As I mentioned before, it was my father who had agreed to draw the pictures for me, but he's a bit too busy now with his new job. I apologize for any disappointments this may cause.
“Dean...” Cas began again. He was standing now, slowly inching his way across the space. “We need to-”
After a moment of consideration, Cas asked, “Yes. Why was I put in a room and told to 'mate' with Alfie? I just don't see the point in that. The whole 'Phase Two' thing.”
!” Suddenly seeming to realize that he could actually get up, Dean did just that. He snatched the towel from his pants and used to angrily swipe at the cooled goop on his stomach, then yanked his pants up and his shirt down before hopping off of the bed.
From one of the pockets of his lab coat, the Beta doctor pulled out a small packet of tissues and handed wordlessly handed then to the Alpha so that he could offer them to his mate. With his teeth and his free hand, Cas ripped open the package and offered one of the white squares to Dean, who accepted it gratefully. The Omega hated that he was showing such weakness in front of a stranger. If it were just Cas he wouldn't have minded so much, but he just met the doctor, and barely even knows him.
Dean was sitting on the couch in the living room, his feet propped up on the coffee table in front of him. He was thumbing through the handbook that had been left for them on the little table in their bedroom. He and Cas and been taking turns going through it over the last couple of days. It was all about Alpha and Omega biology and tendencies.
Dean nodded. If Cas was too upset to think clearly because of his injuries, then working on him probably wouldn't have been a good idea. Cas continued.
He soon realized his mistake, however. As soon as his head was clear of the opening, the tile swung closed, followed immediately by the display sliding back into place with a resonating
Cas moved his hands around to Dean's back, sitting up a little higher in order to get at his beloved from a better angle. The kiss deepened, smiles fell away, lips parted to allow access as they explored each other's mouths. They stay like that for longer than they meant to, lazily exchanging kisses and whispered words of adoration.
Jody took another sip from her glass and swallowed it down before answering him. “Well, the best I can figure it... we need to get rid of the Alphas.”
to have their mind tinkered with, do they? And since he's this heavily involved there's a much greater chance he'll keep his trap shut, and we can keep a better eye on him if he's working closely with us.”
“Well, I'm a Beta, that's my Designation, which is shown by the white and navy blue pattern.” Charlie had set their uniforms on the bench, then also gestured to her own uniform. Then she pointed to her left shoulder which sported an emblem that neither of them had noticed before. It resembled a pair of crescents, one on top and curving down, the other on the bottom and curving up. It looked like they were sliding past each other, and if they went just a few centimeters more, they would hook on to one another. “This emblem ranks me as an ambassador, of sorts.”
Sensing the true motivation behind Dean's distress, the Alpha stepped closer to his Omega and wrapped a comforting arm around the frightened man's shoulders, drawing him into a warm embrace. “Shush, now,” he cooed. “I told you before that everything's gonna be alright and I meant it.”
Benny chuckled and said, “It's sort of a... a panic room?” He searched for the right words to describe it, his eyebrows knit together.
That just opened up a whole slew of other questions, but first things first. “How do you know all this?”
Dean did as instructed and pulled his sleeve up, exposing the three pale, vertical dots glowing faintly just beneath his skin. After a moment, Benny finally found what he was looking for in one of his pockets. It was a subdermal scanner (SDS) which was similar to the one used by Doctor Rufus during Dean's appointment. Benny turned it on and it lit up, then he passed it over Dean's exposed arm. The SDS beeped, indicating that it had read the implant, then Benny pressed a few buttons on the interface.
Dean grinned. “Oh, yeah. Can't wait to get rid of ya, short stack.” There was a chorus of chuckles around them, then he said, “Naw, but for real. I'm just wondering, is all. Seems like things can go back to normal for you guys now.”
“Mmmm,” Cas groaned out. Dean begging to be fucked, all desperate and needy caused something in the Alpha to snap. He lost all control and picked up his pace considerably, roughly ramming his cock in and out of Dean's incredibly tight channel, causing the Omega to howl with pleasure.
Benny had fallen silent during the exchange between the group of bond-mates. He was working on a migraine at that moment from their arguing. His eyes were closed and he had one hand braced on his hip and the other he had up to his face, his thumb and forefinger pinching the bridge of his nose to relieve some of the pressure. They definitely had the most dysfunctional family dynamic he'd ever seen.
Once Alfie had finished showering, Cas could hear the boy's stomach growling from across the room, so he decided that questions could wait until he had gotten some food into the young man. So he requested a food wall from the room, along with a water fountain and some cushions to sit on so they'd be more comfortable while they sat and ate (that last one was Alfie's suggestion). Once their bellies were full, and their whistles wetted, they sat down, facing each other, as Cas asked his first questions.
Jody was struck silent, her face a mosaic of shock and hurt, but Benny had a few things to say, “What the hell do ya mean, 'suicide'! We just saw 'im. He was fine!”
mate. But for some reason, he just couldn't force himself to focus on anything but the unsettling amount of blood that wasn't where it was supposed to be. It should have been
It took every ounce of willpower that Dean possessed not to rush over to the poor pup and comfort her, soothing away the hurt and wiping away the tears. His distress at the sight was short-lived, however, when the child's Omega father quickly descended upon the girl and scooped her up into his arms, shushing and coddling her as he took her back to his seat. He held her in his arms, kissed the boo-boo better, and within no time the tears dried up, were wiped away, and the child was running and playing again as if nothing had happened.
“Go to hell you sonovabitch!” Dean spat out, still panting, still prone and unable to move from the spot where Alistair had him on the bed. Thankfully, though, his mind began to fog as vision started to fade.
Dean silently nodded, eyes wide and confused, not completely comprehending what just happened. He wanted to say more on the subject, but he just... couldn't! Cas – his Alpha – told him not to. He wasn't quite sure how he felt about that at the moment, but he was pretty sure he was gonna be
“You wanna know what's wrong, Cas?” Dean demanded, getting into the Alpha's face. “You using that fucking Voice is what's wrong!” He poked the other man roughly in the chest to punctuate the point.
There was silence for a few moments. Neither of them completely sure of what to say or do next. There would be no sitting in the living room until it was cleaned and they were both too drained to actually go out and
“Cas. Cas!” Dean said, then shouted when the man ignored him. As much as Dean would love to see the bastard's blood painting the walls, he didn't know what the consequences would be for killing a fellow member of the community, and he'd rather not be separated from his mate, if that were to be the case.
“Oh, you betchya. I don't mind at all.” Donna marked the page in her book before setting it down and standing up. “Be back in a jiffy.” With that, the cheery woman bounded off the bus and back into the bunker.
Dean groaned and tossed his head back as far as the hazmat hood would allow. “We're never gonna get outta these damn suits again!”
"Yeah, sorry about that." He rubs the back of his head again, then goes into the explanation of his own experiences in this bizarro place. "When I saw that wall open up, I thought I was finally gonna get outta here, and I just got excited. I didn't even see you there until I was on my ass," he finishes his recounting and the two men just stare at each other for a few moments, neither of them sure what to do next.
“Ah yes, but with poor Gabriel gone, that left only five Council members in total,” Amara explained, clearly having been given a layout of the rules. “Which means only a three-out-of-five vote was needed. That was Uriel, Abby, and Anna.”
Everyone nodded in agreement. They all fell into silence for a moment, contemplating what-might-have-been and appreciating what
“A little... endeavor – or project – that I had completed a few years ago. I think it'll be perfect for what we've gotta do, darlin'.”
“I think it's... a shower?” Cas announced, turning to Dean. The other man had edged closer to the anomaly, his arms crossed over his soiled chest, looking every inch like a petulant child.
But he knew that Dean had still been uncomfortable with the whole pregnancy thing, and he had a feeling the headstrong Omega wouldn't take kindly to his Alpha being overly protective of him, so he'd withheld. Now, however, it seemed that Dean was becoming much more amenable to the idea, and that knowledge gave Cas hope. He hadn't thought that he could love his mate more, but hearing him speaking to their pups in such a care-free manner made love and warmth and affection blossom in his chest so much he felt fit to burst.
With frustration bubbling beneath his skin and pricking at the back of his neck, he lets out an angry growl and pounds the side of his fist on the wall beside him. That's when a loud hissing sound comes from the other side of the room. The previously smooth and seamless wall suddenly hisses open. He leaps up and quickly makes a bum's rush at the door, hoping to finally get out of this sterilized nightmare.
go sideways,” Benny grumbled. He roughly ran both hands through his hair, then locked them together on the back of his neck, fingers interlaced. Jody watched him sympathetically. The man was obviously working on a headache of his own.
will have certain guidelines you'll have to follow cuz – ya know...” she trailed off, not finishing her thought, mindful of Dean's discomfort regarding his condition. “There are also wrestling and boxing classes, as well as swimming and track-”
Dean musters up the will and the brain cells to let out one finally plea. “Cas... I can't.. I just need to
“W-what d'you think is wrong?” Dean ventured to ask once he'd sat back up and gotten himself situated.
“Well, first off, they'll be stripped of their titles and positions. Their memories will be erased, and new Councilmen will be elected to take their place.”
“Wait,” Dean leaned forward to get a better look out the windshield. “What's happening to the road?”About a hundred feet ahead of them, the tunnel they'd been driving through began to narrow into a wedge where the ceiling met the floor. That didn't seem right.
In response, Alfie merely blushed. The pinkish red hue stained his cheeks and ears, spilling down to his chest, as he clammed up again. He looked away from the larger man then, refusing to meet his eyes again. “You'll find out.”
It abruptly went from firm and solid, to squishy and unsteady. Letting out a surprised yelp and a curse respectively, Cas and Dean jumped back and stared at the floor accusingly. “Oh what now?!” Dean demanded in a voice that did nothing to belie his exhaustion and incredulity in equal amounts.
Alistair reached around Dean's front and grabbed his swollen cock, stroking it in time to his own brutal thrusts. Dean cried out, overwhelmed by the sensations. Alistair chuckled and Dean practically keened, pressing his forehead into the bed, bucking back into Alistair's cock and forward into his tight fist. Alistair paused in his stoking periodically to run his thumb over Dean's weeping slit, spreading the precome around the head and driving Dean insane with lust. But all of this did nothing to tip him over that perpetual edge. All it did was make Dean impossibly hornier and caused him to clench his hole tighter around Alistair's fat Alpha cock.
Dean blinked a few times, not sure what had just happened. As Meg spoke, he kind of went off into his own little headspace as she recounted her mating with Al. He hadn't even realized that he'd spoken out loud until Meg brought him back to reality.
“Being 'sociable' is fine, Alistair, but I've told you before that you can't keep doing this! New-comers need time to adjust and relax before they get visitors.” Charlie boldly scolded the Alpha standing in her way, hands braced firmly on her hips.
“Okay, then,” Dean chuckled. He crossed his arms and leaned against the vehicle he'd been learning with for the past few hours. “Shoot.”
Dean was going to argue, but there was a look of sincerity, mixed with a 'don't-you-dare-argue-with-me-boy' expression on her face and all Dean could say was, “Yes, ma'am,” once more, this time with equal gravity as his gaze found the floor. He didn't feel like he deserved her kindness.
Dean raised his sleeve and did as he was told, and promptly got a smack to the back of the head for his trouble. “Ow!” he complained, though she hadn't hit him hard. “What?”
Benny nodded then said, “But then one of the mechanics we'd chosen... well he was attacked. By Amy.” He let that sink in. “He was found bloody and nearly dead, but once he was stable, he told us Amy was the one who'd beaten him and left him for dead, and it was all so she could take his place on this trip.”
Castiel looked forlornly at his mate once more before taking a deep breath to steel himself. Tearing his eyes away, he turned back to Jody with a stiff nod. He quickly retrieved his kit from the bus and promptly got to work.
!” Dean started to say, but then was cut off as Charlie launched herself at him and pressed him into a crushing hug.
Amid the swirling greyish waters was a figure that was completely unfamiliar. Dean quickly averted his gaze from the bathing man and studiously focused on the tiers of food in front of him. There was an array of delicacies, including slices of prime cut steak, some caviar with an arrangement of crackers and toast points to go with it. There was also the ubiquitous platters of rabbit food, but also some delicate-looking desserts that Dean couldn't name. He picked up a little square with a cakey crust and layers of different shades that looked like chocolate and popped it in his mouth. It tasted like coffee.
“Hello,” she said once she'd reached them. “My name is Jody. I'm one of the six Council members. I was here visiting Benny when we heard about your predicament.”
After a few moments, Amy picked up the pace and breezed past the Beta Councilman, a haughty bounce in her step. Fuming, Benny followed her in silence.
P.S. There is a small note at the end, but don't read it until you're done, unless you're okay with spoilers for this chapter. ;)
“Huh. Well this has been fascinating an all, but I need a shower now,” Dean announced, hauling himself up and making his way towards the swirling pool and odd little flow.
been a while since he got laid. Maybe they should stop for the night before they make it home, and he can hit up a local bar. Lord knows he won't be getting anything but his right hand once they make it all the way back to the bunker. Just as he's about to open his mouth to make the suggestion, that's when it happens.
“He, uh...” Cas began, stammering over his excuse. “We invited him over, to talk. He seemed interested in getting to know us when we first moved in. But then he... he attacked my mate. So I defended him and he... well-” Cas finished his explanation there, gesturing in the direction of the bloody mess that used to be Al.
Dean took another deep breath before he continued. “She had come by here, just for a visit. We talked and after a while, she started telling me about when she and Alistair were first mated.” He stopped for a moment to swallow a lump that suddenly threatened to choke him. After a few moments and after a few mouthfuls of saliva had been forced down, he continued. “It's just... some of the things she told me – the stuff he did and the things he said – it all just seemed...
“Oh, what the hell!” Dean, suddenly realizing what he was reading, quickly tossed the offending periodical back down on the table before he continued his outburst, though he only spoke loud enough for Cas to hear. “How the hell do they give me an appointment for an
he's asking? “Yeah, Cas. It's fine. Just... what are you...” He doesn't get to finish his thought. Once Dean said it was okay, a devilish smirk dominated his features, and then Dean was writhing in ecstasy once again.
Blue-Eyes looks at Dean's hand, then back up to his face, as if he's not sure if he should take it. After just a few moments of deliberation, he accepts to proffered appendage in his own, giving a brief shake. "Castiel," he mumbles.
A quick conference with Cas confirms that the same thing has happened to the dots on his arm as well, except his triangle is in the formation of one on top and two on the bottom. Dean briefly wonders if maybe they're supposed to be arrows or something, but what could they possibly be pointing to? He dismisses the thought as quickly as it came and looks at Cas, hoping maybe he has some sort of explanation, but the man is just as confused as he is, so they both let it go. Just chalk another one up for the weird-o-meter. They both sit back down again, with nothing better to do, in their respective corners.
“My name's Doctor Rufus,” the Beta announced as though he hadn't heard anything. “I understand that this is your first pregnancy.”
The lead guard took a step back from Cas to give him a bit of breathing room. She had stepped right up into his face during the confrontation. However, the prospect of having an audience seemed to have sobered her and her comrades. They followed her example and, one by one, they all took a few steps away from Castiel.
The two of them had wound up on the floor after Cas had attacked. When Dean had them separated, Cas stood panting as he stared down at his adversary, still lying prone on the floor. Cas's hands had a few smatterings of blood coating his knuckles. His eyes were blown wide and wild, his hair was ruffled and even wilder than before.
“Hey, Dean?” Cas asked a few minutes later. Dean didn't answer at first, all that met Cas's ears was the deep rhythmic breathing of a person who was fast asleep. He figured he should just let Dean sleep, instead of bothering him with his silly request that would probably get denied. He knew it was selfish, but he couldn't help himself. He called out again, rolling his head to the side once more to get a look at the man. “Dean...”
“What, you gotta go now too?” Now it was Dean's turn to roll his head to the side and get a look at Cas.
Dean nodded his consent and Donna proceeded to gingerly tuck the towel along the hem of his pants, just like she said. So far the procedure was painless and almost felt like being pampered. Dean guessed it couldn't be all bad then, could it?
“So, Dean would have been separated from me?” Cas asked, pulling everyone's attention from the small group that was scrubbing the dried blood from the floor. “For how long?”
“Oh, fuck, Cas!” Dean yelled as the Alpha pounded into him with abandon. All the Omega could do was hold on as the other man fucked him into the mattress. His ass stretched wonderfully around the Alpha's girth as it dragged out and pounded in over and over. He reached down and grabbed a handful of Cas's ass, feeling it clench and unclench as Cas into fucked him.
) cock penetrated him. There was just a pleasant stretching sensation, but no pain. He assumed their captors had done something
Cas gently tugged down Dean until they were both kneeling on the floor, facing each other. Cas's thumbs rubbed mall, soothing circles into Dean's shoulders. He met the other man's eyes before slowing moving forwards, drawing their faces closer together.
I need to see in you. Ever since I got here you've looked dead on your feet, but I need you alive and kicking if we're gonna kick some ass!”
“Yeah, I suppose so. We're running low on time.” He turned to the assembled members of their group and spoke loudly to gain their attention. “Alright, guys, we've got a lotta ground to cover before it gets too late, so let's get dressed out and get a move on.”
“Oh, that's Amy,” Dean answered with a groan. When Jody said others would be joining them, Dean had hoped that it would be his new friend, but it looked as if he'd have to endure the trip with the unpleasant Alpha. At least they wouldn't have to be in the same car.
the guy's waist Dean! It wouldn't do to check the guy out and then get a boner when he's got literally
Benny and Cas shared a laugh at Dean's expense. This, of course, did nothing to curb the Omega's mood.
“Umm, well,” Dean stalled, not sure if he should bring it up. He wasn't sure if it was a topic that he should be sharing with a stranger. He barely knew her, after all. However, she did seem to know quite a bit more about what was going on in this place than he did. It was obvious that she'd been there longer. Also, she was a fellow Omega, shouldn't there be some form of solidarity between them?
He looked over his shoulder at Cas to make sure his eyes were closed. He didn't think the guy would watch him, but he just wanted to make sure before he stepped into the pool. Once inside, he relieved himself and then watched in disgust as his waste was whisked away.
When they finally emerged from the upwards flowing waters, they were both starving. “How about we get the wall to rustle up some grub?” Dean supplied.
Cas didn't need to be told twice. He jumped up and met Dean across the room. He took Dean's hand and they both stepped into the pool at the same time. They were engulfed in the swirling waters together and watched for a minute as the surrounding vortex pulsed back and forth from Cas's flaming orange to Dean's soft rose before it finally settled on a deep purple color.
“Did...” Dean stopped and thought for a moment, his brows knitting. “Did you ever hear that voice? The one telling us to 'mate'?”
A little girl bounced past him, giggling and looking behind herself at a little boy who had given up the chase and was no longer pursuing her. She only had her head turned for a split second, but that was enough time for her to trip up on a toy in her path, which sent her sprawling, landing in a tiny heap on the carpeted floor. She let out a piteous wail as she rolled over onto her bottom, clutching her elbow, fat tears streaming down her pale, round cheeks.
On this side of the wall, there was a flurry of motion. Alphas, Omegas and a few Betas scurried about, attending to their own personal tasks. Some were cooking, others were cleaning, and a few were flying past with trays full of food, heading out of the doors that Dean and Ellen had just come through, delivering food to the hungry residents in the dining hall.
