“Good,” Cas says, still not moving, gaze clear and unrelenting. “She's a staunch defender of your intentions, if not your actions.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean exhales, and then Cas is squeezing aftersun onto his skin, and there’s another jolt of that cold relief on hot, sun-clogged skin. “Could’ve done this myself.”

“Oh,” Dean says, “And I sent one of our delivery guys on route with some garlic bread, made it myself.”
She’s a cute kid (when she’s not screaming fucking murder) anyway, even with this crinkled look of displeasure on her forehead, and Cas holds her like he knows what he’s doing, cradling her head with care and confidence. “I know, Tanya,” Castiel says, voice soft and rough and fucking gorgeous, “I am a very poor subsitute for your mother, but tonight I am what you get.”
“I’m not saying that,” Castiel says, “I’m saying that’s how family works, Dean.  I didn’t think of Sam, but every other thing on my list involves approaching one of my siblings for a loan.”

and you’re being paranoid and mildly insane.” Castiel snaps, with enough heat that some of his coffee sloshes over the edge of the cup.

“Dude, I did some dumbass course in motorbike mechanics because I thought I'd enjoy it, didn't mean it didn't suck.”
“Had to stay in a motel as a stop gap, which - I was moving my crap into there when I got your text. That’s… that’s why it took me a couple of days to reply.”
“Maybe after your father has left,” Cas says, closing the rest of the gap to smooth his hands over his shoulders and offer him a weak smile. “And then you can cook me my lobster.”
“You know I, uh,” Dean says, gathering strength. It shouldn’t be hard, because Cas has been pretty clear that he has feelings, and Dean’s been thinking a lot this weekend about Cas having crappy self-esteem and wanting a proper

Fuck it. He wants to talk to Cas, especially if he’s got some bullcrap going on with Meg that the guy definitely hasn’t mentioned before right now.

Or maybe, he should go back two more summers, and kiss him in the moonlight after Castiel has told him he’s done some research and he’s concluded that he is gay.
about trench coats and blue eyes and snark (he’s accepted it, now, that he misses Cas-things and general-couple-things and that’s okay). When you look at his life as whole, most of the damn sex he ever had was with Castiel, so in a lot of ways the two are intrinsically interconnected. It’s not like he’d
everyone back to life. The fact that Dean didn’t even have phone calls for years is in-freaking-comprehensible. The fact that he doesn’t get to see him until March feels like someone punctured his liver.
“Peachy,” Dean throws back, nodding at the stack of Sam’s crap that apparently now lives in Bobby’s place as well as their own apartment. “This Sam’s college list?”

“Balthazar,” Castiel says, turning up and frowning at the British guy – Balthazar – looking distinctly unimpressed, “And you say

Then they broke up, and sex was about reclaiming that togetherness, fast, urgently, now, before sense and regret and hurts slipped in. It was still hot as hell, but not as pure.
, that would solve the mystery of why Dean lost his goddamn mind and invited him back here yesterday. His voice sounds like the personification of a morning after and it is so, so, so hot.
“You,” Cas says, without pause.  Dean sends him a look. “Hear this without the filter of your attachment to your masculinity: your features are beautiful.”
on his stupid fucking millenial asshat bulllshit-blog, and shuts his laptop before he can take in a single word of what Cas has to say about him.
“Didn’t have Charlie to hack me into the good wifi,” Dean says, spreading his fingers on the wheel, accidentally glancing at Cas again. “It was fine,”
“Yeah, allright,” Dean says, watching as Sam pulls out a book and cracks it open. He lets the moment settle for a little until he digs his phone back out of his pocket, and ---
“I’ll catch you up,” Bobby says, “And Dean --- you better not go dark on me when you’re livin’ your damn life back in California. You ditch me again, I'm gonna get a complex, so you better call me. Keep me updated about how you’re doing.”
“ - Well, ladies, I'm out,” Jess says, folding her cards face down onto the table. Dean is having a really fucking good day. Tomorrow they’ve got to go through all the comment cards from their trial-run to see whether they’re the only people who like the menu, but Dean’s got that Chef-instinct in his bones that it’s good. The last three menus he produced he’s been so damn crippled with worry about what people would
“— no,” Dean says, “No, it’s actually pretty fucking awesome that you’re such good bosom buddies with my brother, I just…” Dean trails off.
“Right,” Dean exhales, lying back down again and pulling Cas with him, “Cause nothing screams sexy like a sensible pace.”
“ - and I realised that the other option is battling it out, hunger games style, against the guys I’ve been working with for three freaking years, wishing they got screwed instead of us, and it I didn’t want a damn thing to do with it, so I decided in the middle of the meeting to fuck it. I tried to call you.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean says, chest tight, “It’s dumb. Running away was dumb. I missed a lot. I made Sam worry instead of dealing with my crap. And now I’m screwing up his present and he’s too frigging scared about what I’m gonna do to call me out on it.”
’ which means that they’re either belated celebrating them buying a house, or he took the damn promotion after all.
(Later, he found out that Alistair kept his phone and sent Sam messages every couple of weeks, but that Sam was about a month away from calling the cops and filing a missing persons, anyway).
Dean knows that Castiel is still in love with him now, if there had ever been any doubt in his mind. It seemed like there had been, given the relief written all over his face when Castiel said it, but ---
“Putting me in charge would be a great error in judgement,” Cas returns, “Thank you for the coffee. I --- what

The Shurley-Milton family dynamic has always been a little complicated. The money and expectation and the name came from the Milton side and, from what Dean pieced together from those midnight conversations about loss and befores, all of that only seemed to get
“Cool,” Dean exhales, “Not sure I’m at the peak of my conversational capacity but, sure. Let’s talk.”
"Oh, it stands for alternate reality game. It's like— the evolution of video games, you know? The concept is similar but everything happens in real time and real life. So yeah, a lot of people think you're a character in an ARG." ]
They both turn around. Claire rolls her eyes at the camera and goes back to looking down in concentration. Charlie smiles, looks above the camera.
"I think, you can feel some of my emotions because... a part of my grace has been fused with your soul, and now that it's so close to... me, to the main part of itself — it can pick up and translate some of itself to you? Although I'm not entirely sure — this isn't precedented, unfortunately," even as there's uncertainty in his voice and words, Dean also feels that Cas is... pleased? Yep, he's definitely pleased with himself. Dean wonders what that means. Is it just Cas being smug about solving a riddle? Or— yeah, no, he's going to leave all thoughts about possessive angels laying a claim on him for
A huge garage with a bunch of old cars. But don't tell my dad Dean I said that, he calls them all babies and I suspect he loves them more than me."
[ Two women are standing in front of a huge pine tree, their backs to the camera. Jack's voice sounds from behind the camera.
Cut to Jack whisking batter in a bowl. He looks very concentrated. The apron didn't save his clothes from getting covered in chocolate and flour. The counter is a mess, but Cas's hands are seen moving around, tidying it up. Jack finishes whisking and looks at the bowl, contemplative. He then sticks his finger in, scoops some batter on it, and goes to try it. His finger gets intercepted by Cas's hand on his wrist.
Dean's hands appear in the shot on the other side of the counter. He puts down a cutting board and a knife. "You grate, I chop. No way am I trusting a three year old with a knife."
Whirlwind of emotions Dean experienced the moment Bobby mentioned that Cas is here, too, is — it was a lot. He was relieved, happy, nervous, scared. His first instinct was to avoid Cas at all costs, actually, now that Dean knew Cas is fine and doing his own thing.
"Oh," Cas says after a slight pause, "But I'm still— I don't know how this could work, Dean," at that, Dean barely holds in a hysterical laugh. If only Cas could actually read his mind. Dean squeezes Cas' hand.
"Jack, we've talked about this. No teleportation inside. And you've upset Miracle!" Cas, exasperated.
Back in purgatory, Cas said that Dean doesn't need to say anything, that he heard Dean's prayer, right? So. So it would've made sense, then, for him to say "I love you, too", right? If the nature of his feelings was similar to Dean's.
[ Jack is sitting under the Christmas tree in pastel blue pajamas. He has several brightly wrapped boxes in front of him.
Jack buys a lot of skirts and dresses, because so many of them have such beautiful colors and patterns, he can't really choose just one or two. He picks some shirts that he thinks would go with the skirts he got, and because he really likes all the different colors, too. Some are very bright and saturated, others are more light. Sam tells him the lighter colors are called pastel. Jack likes both the colors and the name.
Shit. Now Dean feels both horny and like he's about to cry. At least Cas doesn't seem to notice his out of place arousal.
Dean smiles at the thought, then returns back to the present moment. Looks at Cas, takes all of him in again.
[Jack stands in front of a camera. The background is an average teen's room. Jack is wearing a yellow sweater with little bees on it, a white pleated skirt that ends just above his knees, white crew socks and white velcro shoes. His hair is very fluffy, and he may or may not be wearing some blush. He bops his head to the music and holds his hands up, as if in an exaggerated shrug. He wiggles his shoulders to the beat. The caption on the screen:
Patience's mood seems to turn a bit sour again. "Really? Why are you so obsessed with this app anyway? I wouldn't have pegged you as a tiktoker if I didn't know for a fact that you are one."
Of course, it’s anyone’s guess whether it’ll work, but if monsters in Purgatory could be killed a second time, then he’d better be carrying something that’ll do the job.
As the shock of Dean’s first touch wears off, Castiel lifts his head, and Dean slowly strokes the length of Castiel’s other wing. He withdraws his hand with some reluctance, and his wedding band catches the soft lantern light.
Death holds his scythe steady, and Jack and the archangels raise their hands, palms out, and their eyes begin to glow.
They get in the shower and soap each other up with gentle hands, pausing often to kiss, and when they turn the water off they can hear that it’s begun to rain.
When Dean stirs, Castiel presses his lips to his ear. “Thank you,” he whispers. “I hardly know what to say.”
“You better not be.” Dean smiles and sits up. “I age, you know. My good looks aren’t gonna last forever, and you and I got a whole lotta lost time to make up for.”
Sam reaches for the same words he’s used many times a day now for weeks—no less heartfelt for how often they’ve been repeated:
him understand. He smashes his fist into Castiel’s face, and proceeds to beat him senseless. Dean gets no enjoyment from this; he’s just doing what he has to, to get Cas to stop talking, stop trying, to get him to just
Dean focuses on the climb with single-minded purpose, only returning to himself when, sooner than he would have expected, he reaches the next outcropping. It’s rockier up here; the passage is close.
An easy silence stretches between them as they nurse their beers, lost in their own thoughts. Air whooshes through the vents, and the general hum of appliance electricity is so normal as to feel odd.
Sam’s flashlight beam falls on a book with golden lettering on its spine: WORLD ATLAS. He pauses, then takes it off the shelf. It’s decades out of date, but it’s not too large or heavy, and now that Google Maps is no longer a certainty it’ll get the job done just fine.
“Who’s there?” Dean asks. His words come out in a low growl, strange to his ears after days of not speaking.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He clears his throat and adjusts his shirt, feeling in some way like they’ve just been caught. “Yeah, I’m alright,” he says.
Jack draws a startled breath. “He was just here! I can catch him, Sam.” He squeezes Sam’s hand. “Hold on.”
Jack nods. “And that we should all promise not to make any more” —he yawns suddenly— “secret deals.”
Gabriel straightens up, pulling his arm from Castiel’s shoulders. “I was a prisoner for like, eight years, remember?” He rolls his shoulders a couple of times. "I need to stretch my wings, Cas.”
He’d been holding onto those words, hoping deep down he might be able to believe them one day, but this place has shown him who he is: a monster, driven by fear that he masks as anger, someone who will always disappoint and hurt the people he supposedly loves.
Amara’s cheeks are wet with tears but she smiles through them. “Hello, my friend.” They embrace, the scythe still clutched in Death’s hand.
He hits send before he can change his mind, half-surprised at himself. But there’s something about texting that makes talking easy. Maybe because there’s no eye contact. Or saying things out loud.
“Yeah, well, we’re gonna get back to that.” Dean kisses Castiel’s mouth lightly, granting him a teasing brush of his tongue. “And then we might move on to some other things. And then after that we’re gonna eat that pie I made.”
“Cas?” Dean takes a cautious step closer. “You remember me, right?” He stares at Castiel imploringly. “It’s me. Dean.”
Dean doesn’t have an answer, because the only thing he can think about is how shitty he’s been to Cas over the years. So many angry words, and selfish demands. So many brush-offs—unfeeling at best and scornful at worst.
Gabriel disappears and Castiel takes a step toward Dean to whisk him away, but Dean stops him with a raised hand. “Hold up,” he says quietly. “I’m glad you got your wings back, believe me, but what happened back there? In the Empty.”
There’s no flickering yellow light, no electric sizzle, but Dean sees surprise in Alastair’s eyes. Then Alastair’s expression begins to slacken, and his legs give out.
“Now what do we have here?” Alastair says in a ponderous voice. He swings the belt and the buckle connects with Dean’s spine. Dean’s body jerks and he cries out, and Alastair stoops and takes hold of the chain around Dean’s neck.
So Dean wanders into the living room. The regular lights are off and the Christmas tree is on; the colorful bulbs wink serenely on and off, and the atmosphere is restful. Patience and Jack are sitting cross-legged on the floor by the tree, deep in conversation. Claire is sitting at one end of the couch and Kaia is sprawled down the length of it, her head in Claire’s lap.
“You should think of something, tell him, then I’ll find it and you’ll win. Just don’t tell him you told me about it,” Dean says, pointing. “That’s a secret deal, but it’s not the kind I was talking about.”
Castiel sets the box on the nightstand next to Dean’s necklace, then stretches out on the bed. He tucks his hands under his head and regards Dean evenly. “I do feel the need to point out, however, that I’m not your boyfriend anymore.”
Dean clenches his jaw, and Chuck eats some more popcorn, then says, “So listen, let’s just get this out of the way—I’m sure you’re going to ask me to bring everyone back but the answer on that is no.” He pops another few pieces of popcorn into his mouth, and as he’s swallowing he makes a circling motion with one finger. “This story’s wrapped up; we’re in the epilogue now.”
“You’re part of our family—you’re a Winchester, as far as I’m concerned.” Dean pauses, fighting the habitual urge to avoid saying what he feels. “And I want you to know that when I say that,” Dean says slowly, “what I mean is… I see you as my son.”
“But together, you’ve made it here,” Garth says. He gestures at their home. “You’ve built a beautiful life in this house, raising a fine young man into someone we’re all proud of,” Garth says, smiling at Jack, “and who can be proud of himself and who he is. You both work hard to contribute to your community, and to make this world a better, safer place for everyone. And every day, whether it’s easy or difficult, you choose each other. With acts big and small, you commit to your life together.” Castiel gazes into Dean’s eyes and thinks,
Eileen’s mouth drops open, and then it closes again, her eyes narrowing. “Chuck?” Sam nods. “That bastard,” Eileen grits out.
He fishes Baby’s keys out of his pocket, rolls them in his palm. They clink softly, glinting in the sunlight. He thinks of Sam saying,
A tremendous clap of thunder splits the sky. It sounds like the end of the world right inside Dean’s skull; it vibrates through his bones and leaves his knees unsteady.
“I’ll do a good job,” Dean snarls, and it’s a promise. Smiling, Alastair retrieves the knife and presses it into Dean’s waiting hand, and when he goes, he locks the door behind him.
So Dean tucks the pendant of Jack’s grace into his T-shirt and leaves his extra layers, belt, and angel blade on the sand.
A summer evening, orange sunlight slanting low across the parking lot of some forgettable chain restaurant where they’d grabbed dinner—him and Sam and Cas and Jack.
“I know.” Sam dries a plate and rests it in the stack on the shelf above the sink. There’s a heavy silence, and when Sam speaks again his voice is soft. “Promise me you’re gonna come back. No matter what. I can’t do this without you.”
“She told me she and Sam put up warding this past weekend,” Castiel says. “Apparently Gabriel stopped by recently and… interrupted them.”
Dean’s brows crease. He can’t tell if this is simple, blunt honesty that he should take at face value, or if Cas is being passive-aggressive about their latest crisis, maybe because he isn’t feeling well—Cas can be a real grump sometimes.
Jack gets up and is about to leave the room when Dean asks over his shoulder, “Hey, you want something to eat? I think I got enough to do grilled cheese sandwiches, and I might have some soup in the cupboard.”
“Doubt it.” Sam drains his coffee, then gets up and goes into the kitchen, returning with a notepad and pen. “Okay—seriously. Bachelor party?” he asks Dean.
Castiel undoes the buttons at his wrists and puts them on, then shoots his cuffs and gives Mary a questioning look.
Dean leans forward and presses his forehead against the backs of his hands on the wheel, eyes closed. He takes a breath, and before he can second-guess himself, he’s praying.
“No, let me finish,” Dean says, holding up a hand. “I was a dick to you, after you got your wings back, and I’m sorry.” He wants to explain further, but he shuts his mouth. A good apology doesn’t make excuses.
Dean settles himself on top of the workbench and sips his beer. “Maybe I was talking about the drive home.” He smiles lazily. “Speaking of which…” He runs his tongue over his bottom lip. “You don’t need to get back there right away, do you?”
“They’re also both driven by a strong sense of duty. They’re self-sacrificing, and they’ve known suffering.” He pauses. “So nothing makes me happier than to see them right where they are today.” He looks over at them. “I can’t think of anyone more deserving of this” —he gestures at the room around them, at everyone who’s there for them— “more deserving of happiness… than them.” Dean looks down at the table and swallows hard, and Castiel squeezes his hand.
The sludge is chest-height now and Dean’s heart is pounding, but Castiel makes it to him and Dean feels his arms around his waist. “Hold onto me,” Castiel says. Their eyes meet. “Deep breath.”
Dean nods and strokes a thumb over the back of Castiel’s hand. “Castiel…” Dean says softly, and Castiel’s heart beats hard, hearing Dean use his full name. Dean gives him a small smile.
Jack flies them back to the bunker, where Michael is waiting near the front entrance in a patch of moonlight, arms crossed.
Finally, Eileen presses gently against his chest to put some distance between them, but Sam can’t bring himself to let go of her so he settles his hands on her waist. She’s sturdy, and she’s
Dean nods. “Then we’ll split up. You two look for Michael,” Dean says, pointing between Sam and Jack, “and I’ll head into the Empty. If I don’t make it out then the two of you still got good odds.”
“First of all,” Crowley says, grabbing Dean’s arm. Dean glares at his hand and Crowley drops it. “I don’t know what use Gabriel will be,
Callie wanders back to Castiel’s side for more attention, and Castiel nods gravely as he resumes petting her. “Yes. I’ve resigned myself to a lifetime of terrible jokes.”
His path is clear, but he has to pace himself; it’s a long way to the other end of the valley. And the marching horde won’t stop, so he can’t stop.
He takes off his belt and returns the angel blade to its mount on the wall, then slowly shrugs out of his jacket. It needs to be washed—a few times, probably—but for now he hangs it up, running a hand gently over the sleeve. The handprint might come out if he soaks it in hydrogen peroxide, but even as the thought occurs to Dean, he knows he won’t do it.
Claire shrugs a shoulder. “My name’s on the bunker roster, too, y’know. So I can see how often you’re on duty.”
Dean’s taken off his jacket and button-up; they’re tied around his waist in a way that covers the angel blade, which had become superheated after a few hours in the sun. Even his watch had become uncomfortable, and seeing as it was useless here anyway, he’d stuck it in one of his jacket pockets.
Castiel frowns, but Dean senses this rather than sees it, because he can’t take his eyes off of Castiel’s wings. “I’m… what?”
, and pain explodes in his knee as he collapses in the surf with a grunt. Gasping, he scrabbles to get away, but Alastair kicks him in the stomach, driving the air from his lungs.
Sam smiles, and it’s a little sad, but he nods. “Thanks.” He glances at both entrances to the kitchen, checking to make sure they’re alone, and then says, “I’m worried about Jack.”
They grapple in the water, tearing at each other. It’s ugly and desperate, both of them trying to be the first to get to the blade.
Just then, Dean pushes his empty plate away from him and leans forward so he can see around Castiel to look at Jack.
“Everyone was still pretty out of it when we were making a break for it, so I don’t think so,” Gabriel says, shaking his head.
Sam rolls his eyes. “It’s not like that,” he says, shaking his head. He’s silent for a few seconds and Dean doesn’t say anything, sensing that Sam might elaborate, and right now Dean’s curiosity is greater than his desire to tease.
And then Cas is there, trying to reach Dean, and that’s when cold fury takes over. Cas doesn’t understand that Dean can’t be saved, so Dean needs to
Gabriel claps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Okay, good talk!” he says, his voice jovial once more. “Listen, don’t have too much fun without me.”
“What’s that about?” Dean asks, his eyebrows raised in a way that implies he isn’t sure he wants to know the answer.
“At the time,” Death says, “I was unaware of what was happening, but he found me and manipulated my memories.”
Jack smiles, and Castiel smiles back at him, then glances around at the group. “In the billions of years that had passed since Chuck hid my memories in the Empty, the vault holding them had gained sentience—a very unstable sentience—and become the Entity.
Gabriel, waiting in a white tuxedo, hands Jack a microphone, and Jack says into it, “May I present newlyweds Castiel and Dean Winchester.”
“I realized…” Dean pauses, searching for the right words. “I feel better when you’re around. I mean that I feel good, but like I’m a better version of myself, too.” His voice breaks when he says, “I realized I hate it when you leave, and I miss you when you’re gone… and I don’t want to imagine my life without you in it.”
The Winchesters, Castiel, and Jack are all in the library discussing this one day, and theorizing about the reason for the change.
He wraps it around Castiel’s wrist and tucks the ends in to secure it. He does his best to be gentle, but if he causes Castiel any pain, he makes no complaint.
And though the pull that guided him through the Empty has faded, everything inside of him is shifting, reorienting around something new, bone-deep and just as urgent:
The visiting hunters head off early, and Sam and Eileen and Mary stick around for a while longer. Everyone exchanges hugs in the driveway before they leave, tired but happy. After they drive off, Jack rushes upstairs to his new room, beaming with excitement.
Michael turns away from them and gazes up into the shadowy recesses of the apse. “I have been praying, as you have been.”
“Okay, sounds good,” Dean mumbles, shifting to get more comfortable. Eyes half-closed, he watches them leave the room, listens to their low voices in the kitchen. Their kitchen.
“Well, if it’s true, then I’d advise you to think happy thoughts. Come on, take us back in. I’ll show you a couple of other things.”
Charlie and another hunter named Stevie decide to move to Seattle together, but they promise to keep in touch. Before they depart from the bunker, Charlie insists, multiple times, that if anyone ever needs anything they can call or text her any time, and finally Dean has to tell her to get in the car and go, or else.
How many times did Cas defy Heaven and the other angels for Dean? He gave up everything he knew to break ranks and help them stop the Apocalypse. He overcame Naomi’s mind control, and after the Fall he traded his army for Dean.
The past three weeks, they’ve made good time across Europe and Asia, with multiple flights a day. The farther east they’ve gone, the less jarring the destruction; out here, it had been the middle of the night when everyone had vanished.
His eyes settle on the void on the horizon. Where thousands of angels and demons are waiting for him to do a good job.
At first Dean thinks Castiel is so focused he doesn’t notice their presence, but then his lips move. Dean holds his breath against the boiling air and leans in as close as he can bear to get.
“There’s a lot of things I wish hadn’t happened,” Dean says. “To the world. To my parents. Me and Sam. You and Jack. But now that we’re here… What we did?” He shakes his head. “I wouldn’t change that.”
The twenty-minute drive to the bunker is serene. The windows are rolled all the way down, and the wind fills the cab. They hold hands, not saying much and not needing to. Castiel is still absorbing the ceremony, and he suspects the same is true for Dean.
Dean inhales deeply and his eyes sting; he wants to blame it on the cold air, but he can’t. He tilts his head back, blinking until his eyes clear, and gazes up at the sky. There’s a sliver of moon rising opposite the red-streaked clouds that follow the sun as it sets.
The man wraps an arm around Dean, hauls him to his feet and hugs him to his chest. The hand on his arm is burning hot, but it doesn’t hurt; for the first time in decades Dean feels soothed. The sensation races through him, chasing away the icy cold, the smoke and the sulphur.
Jack takes this in, then looks from Castiel to Dean, whose eyes are still closed, his hand covering half his face. “But…”
“Heaven is a sad state of affairs, not to mention terribly unstable. There are souls everywhere that need help—those trapped in the Veil, and the innocent souls that ended up in Hell or Purgatory, and the souls I consumed when I thought I was the Darkness… There’s the Empty, which never should have existed in the first place, and now it’s in chaos.” Amara looks between the archangels. “I would welcome whatever help you might wish to offer.”
“I promise you.” Castiel props himself up on one arm, then leans down and kisses Dean’s forehead, and any sense of worry Dean had fades away.
Dean glances behind him and finds a chair. They settle in, and Death begins skimming Chuck’s book. From where Dean’s sitting, the pages appear blank, but Death’s eyes are moving back and forth.
Mary checks her watch and turns to them. “Okay… It’s almost noon. Should we go over the plan?” She glances at Dean and Sam, who are arguing about past pranks.
After Dean’s hospital stay, he hadn’t seen Castiel again for a few months, until they encountered God masquerading as a disheveled writer.
“Exactly.” Castiel goes to the door and takes the handle to pull it closed behind him. “Good night, Dean.” Another regretful-looking smile.
So they pore through the 200s (Religion) and move on to the 720s (Architecture), and they’re coming to the tail end of it, empty-handed, when Sam looks over at Jack suddenly and says, “Travel.”
Castiel smiles. The first time he met Garth, he found him to be one of the best examples of humanity he’s ever encountered. They haven’t seen much of each other now that Garth is mostly retired from hunting in order to focus on his family, but the news that he’d named one of his sons after Castiel had surprised and touched him.
Their clothes end up on the floor, initially dropped but eventually hurled with impatience, once they’re finally free of them.
“Sorry, Dean,” the DJ says into her microphone, grinning. She holds up a bill; from where Castiel is standing, he can see it’s a fifty.
“Some time after I created Castiel,” Amara says, “I started to realize that Chuck was becoming jealous. He craved my attention. I felt suffocated, so Castiel and I went away for a long time. I created many worlds, but after a while I missed my brother.
Sam is temporarily sharing with Dean because another family is borrowing his room, so Dean’s bed is shoved up against one wall and there’s a cot on the opposite wall. Weapons, toiletries, and paperwork are jammed onto every available surface. It’s clear that a quiet battle for space is being waged.
As Dean gets closer still, he realizes that the shore is littered with the bodies of sleepers. There are a couple dozen at least—more than he’s seen in one place before, all of them apparently washed up out of the sea. The sight unnerves him, but he scans them quickly and sees nothing tan. He turns his attention to landing, looking for a clear stretch of beach.
“This smells amazing,” Castiel says, unwrapping a breakfast sandwich. Dean smiles, relieved to see that Castiel’s eyes are a little brighter this morning.
One of the photographers, Nikita, is standing just in front of Castiel and to his right. She lifts one of her cameras, and Castiel wills himself to forget she is there, and that her partner Steven is standing somewhere behind him.
Castiel closes the distance between them and drops his coat around Dean’s hunched shoulders, then guides him to the path leading back up to the cabin.
As Dean makes his way along the passage he steps over the rocky ground carefully, favoring his knee. He keeps his eyes on the farthest point he can see ahead, and glances back over his shoulder often. He’s almost certain he’s alone, but he doesn’t loosen his grip on the blade.
They land hard and Jack stumbles; with their hands joined they both topple over onto green grass. Palm trees sway against an orange sky that might be a sunrise or sunset. They’re next to a white wooden church, and somewhere beyond it is the sound of waves.
Jack proceeds to introduce the rest of their party, and they all join them up at the front of the room. There is another round of applause, and then the family takes their seats at their table.
Dean gasps and clutches Castiel’s arm, and he hears Castiel’s wings beating furiously but they keep falling, tumbling through the air. He glimpses the ground and it’s too close, way too close—
Dean lifts the microphone. “Thank you,” he says. He pauses and looks out over the sea of guests. The microphone seems to have thrown him off, but he recovers himself. “Um… I’m only gonna talk for a minute, ’cause we wanna get you guys fed. I know some of y’all came a long way to join us. But thank you for being here. Thank you.
“Nah, she’s still settling in.” Sam pauses and then his voice sounds further away. “That’d be too much excitement for you, wouldn’t it, Callie? Yeah.”
across the wind. Usually happens when you sail at a dead run—that’s when you’ve got the wind directly behind you. It’s a fast way to travel, but if you jibe, it can make you capsize.” Gabriel demonstrates how the sail would catch the wind and quickly flip sides, swinging over to the same side of the boat as Dean, thus resulting in an overbalance. “So don’t do it.”
But on the off-chance they’re able to keep him from knowing their plans, it’s worth doing whatever they can.
Castiel heaves a thoughtful sigh next to him, then says, “If Rowena could make a spell that enabled you to see and touch them in the first place, I’m sure she can make a spell for that, specifically.”
“What are you doing awake, anyway?” Dean asks. “I thought everyone was supposed to be in eternal slumber, dreaming about all their regrets.”
Dean closes the book and looks at the cover, then sets it carefully aside. Alex still hasn’t said anything, so he finds himself filling the space.
“Yeah,” Gabriel says with a sigh. “It’s always serious with you Winchesters.” He sits down, stretching his legs out in front of him and leaning back on his hands. “But hey.” He glances up at Dean and shrugs a shoulder. “If you’re offering me a ticket outta here, least I can do is listen.” He nods toward the spot next to him and stares out at the sea.
“I mean, I don’t know; this is a spell Rowena made for us and anytime we use it, Claire wears a protection charm so it doesn’t affect her.”
. He isn’t sure if it’s a prayer; he doesn’t necessarily intend for them to hear it, but he doesn’t mind if they do. He hears the door close and he drifts back to sleep, warm and content.
“Hey, Cas?” Castiel raises his eyebrows, and hesitantly, Jack says, “I… Dean and I talked a little bit ago, and I told him that I knew about your deal with the Entity. Um, and that you’d asked me to keep it a secret. I just… felt like he should know that I knew.”
The water is surprisingly warm, but then most of the pool is bathed in the light of the unmoving sun. Dean submerges himself and comes up again, groaning with relief.
Sam says, “You’ll probably be busy helping Amara get stuff sorted out, but you’re welcome any time.”
Dean pushes open the door to the shitty cabin where he’d left Sam’s body, only to find Sam on his feet. It’s not a miracle—it’s a demon deal complete with a countdown, but Dean’s never been so relieved in his life, and he crosses the room and pulls Sam into his arms.
“I think Dean is right,” Jack says. Dean and Sam look over at him. “I don’t want us to separate, but if we can’t find Michael, then we still need an archangel. If we do find him,
Castiel’s mouth drops open, devastation in his eyes. “I’d hoped you’d never… I tried my best but I couldn’t…” He’s shaking his head, then he looks at Dean and says, “But it was wrong of me—”
There are two kids in a yard nearby, but they’re busy playing in a sprinkler and don’t notice them at all. Sam watches them for a second, momentarily overcome by the simple fact of their existence.
“We’re getting married in a few weeks.” Castiel smiles, and Dean goes on, reading carefully and deliberately. “I’m looking forward to the day, because I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be a good one. But what I’m looking forward to most is the day after it, when I wake up next to you and we’re both wearing our rings. I can’t wait till you’re my husband. I can’t wait to be
Amara blinks back her tears. “The place I was imprisoned… It was as if the story about the Darkness was playing on a loop—what Chuck wanted to believe, and what he wanted
The far-off train horn echoes mournfully, and Dean’s abruptly aware of how middle-of-the-night it feels. His phone screen says it’s 2:09.
Fortunately the rain always dissipates quickly and he hasn’t had to steer through any significant showers, but the wind is stronger and more temperamental. In addition to watching the sail, which requires frequent adjustment now, Dean keeps an eye on the sea to look out for sudden dark patches of water that signal a gust of wind is headed his way.
Amara resumes the story. “When Chuck and I returned to Earth last year we went our separate ways, and he decided to try and exert his influence over you once again. But you wouldn’t kill Jack,” she says to Dean, and then she smiles at Sam. “And you shot him.
“Chuck,” Amara says. She sighs. “I gave him what he wanted most: control. Which is to say that in about nine months, somewhere in the world a human child will be born, with a human soul. They will have no memory of what they used to be. They’ll have control over their life and their choices. One day, Death will come for them, and they will end up… wherever they end up.”
“Ah,” Dean says. “I was kinda thinking I’d head up to the cabin tonight. Um, just me, if it’s alright for Jack to stay here with you guys.” Dean smiles and keeps it light. “Just kinda wanna clear my head, you know?”
Dean raises his arm to shield his eyes, and then the light is gone, and Castiel is stepping away from him to go to Jack, who has fallen to his knees. Dean rushes to follow.
It’s probably not necessary that they speak in low voices, or keep their thoughts centered. In all likelihood, there’s nothing to stop Chuck from listening in on whatever he wants to. Or snooping in their minds. Or maybe he’s aware of everything, without even trying.
Eileen returns his kiss with equal enthusiasm, only pulling away after a long moment to nuzzle him. Pulse racing, Sam slowly opens his eyes and looks down at her.
His eyes find Dean across the room, and he is surprised to see that Dean is alone now, leaning against a bookshelf, staring at Castiel while sipping his whiskey.
Dean finds Jack in his room, lying on his bed with a contemplative expression on his face. There’s an empty cereal bowl on his nightstand, next to a white flash drive and a pair of headphones.
Jack takes another step up the stairs, but then he stops again and turns back to Dean. “By the way,” he says, and for a second Dean wonders if there’s something Cas had wanted Jack to tell Dean. But Jack says, “Jody said we were welcome to stay up at the cabin for a little while, too, if we want.” He smiles. “I thought you might like that. I know you like having space to yourself.”
He gets out of the truck and hurries for the house, but still manages to get doused by the time he’s stepping through the back door.
After some time, Gabriel says, “Alright. We better get this show on the road.” They get up and brush themselves off, and Dean puts on his belt, button-up, and jacket.
“I know,” Jack says. “And I know you did it for the same reason Amara did—because you didn’t want anyone else to get hurt.”
Charlie’s reply is suddenly swallowed by a huge yawn, and she laughs. “If no one needs anything else from me, I think I’m gonna go sleep for a week.”
“Suddenly, he was losing control. You’d surprised him—both of you—and the injury seriously weakened him. He knew Castiel had been in the Empty and that the Entity was awake. I was also much less like the Darkness and more like my original self. He was terrified.
Sam snorts, then nudges Dean and they both move into the living room and settle onto the other couch, automatically positioning themselves so Eileen can see them. Callie contentedly remains where she is, and Castiel scratches behind her ears with both hands.
He grabs a change of clothes and goes to the shower room, and as he undresses he finds himself wondering,
“It’s a lot of ground to cover,” Sam says. He checks his watch. It’s still the middle of the night here, but it’s only mid-afternoon for their internal clocks. “Let’s take a break, and then we’ll get started.”
“You patched me up a couple times.” Gabriel shrugs a shoulder. “I’m just returning the favor.” He smacks Sam’s arm lightly. “Now go get your girl.” He winks, and with a rustle of wings he’s gone.
Castiel pulls his lips from Dean’s to press them to his throat, and Dean gasps, tilting his head back. “You are the most beautiful soul I’ve ever met,” Castiel says raggedly, between kisses.
Then Gabriel turns away from Castiel, and Dean sees his thousand-yard stare. Gabriel presses a fist to his mouth and walks slowly to one of the stacks. With his back to them, he braces himself against it and hangs his head.
Dean groans, his cheek ground into the sand and his hand cradled against his chest. Another wave crashes onto the beach, and the foamy surf sweeps up around him and recedes. The toe of one of Alastair’s shoes prods at his shoulder, pushing him onto his back. Dean’s eyelids flutter and above him, Alastair unwinds the belt from his palm and tosses it aside. “Ah, I’ve
“I appreciate that,” Castiel says, and he looks away from Dean. “I was… very hurt. I thought you’d be happy for me. And you weren’t, and I couldn’t understand why, because I remember… when Bobby lost the use of his legs, you were sympathetic. You understood his frustration, and then you were happy for him when his ability to walk was restored. But you weren’t happy for me.”
Cas is wearing a small smile, along with one of Dean’s old T-shirts and a rough pair of jeans; Dean had insisted he borrow them that morning.
“More importantly,” Castiel says, “I might be immortal, but that doesn’t mean I think it would be pointless.” He looks into Dean’s eyes, and hopes Dean might somehow sense the depth of his emotion. “I love you, and I’m deeply honored that you would ask me to marry you.” He adds, “To be honest, I wasn’t sure if marriage was something
Daylight dims as roiling black clouds gather overhead with impossible speed. A violent wind picks up, the trees tossing their branches as if in fear of the celestial showdown that’s begun.
There’s another piercing burst of sound, and the man grips him tight. Dean hears a rustling, like beating wings, and then he’s weightless, being carried away from that windowless room.
“Yeah, you know.” Gabriel snaps his fingers. “We’ll do a huge tent with a dance floor. And cabins, for all your hard-drinking hunter guests. Just pick a date and handle all the other stuff I’m not responsible for.” He balls up the list and lobs it at Castiel. “We get plus ones, right? Can I get a plus two?”
“It was good!” Jack goes to the refrigerator and removes the pitcher of lemonade, then goes to the cupboard for a glass. “Did you two have a nice week?”
Gasping, Castiel breaks their kiss and pulls his hand away from Dean, placing it on his chest to keep him from coming back for more. “They’re two miles away,” he says, panting slightly. He gives Dean an apologetic smile. “Sam is praying they’re not going to get here and find us in the middle of anything.”
It’s quick work, and soon they’re hefting the bags onto their backs and grabbing the flashlights and the lantern.
And Castiel responds that the blame for the Apocalypse doesn’t lie with him, but the fate of the world does—Dean might have started things, but he’s also the only one who can finish them.
Lucifer goes on, “Three, you can’t stay here, because” —he gestures at the horde— “they want him dead.” Dean glances over at them and Lucifer says, “Yep, still alive. And probably going to wake up any minute now.”
“I never thought I’d be able to have a life like the one we have, and I also never thought I’d be so excited to settle down. I never thought I’d be the kinda guy who writes letters like this, but I love you so damn much, you make me wanna be that guy.” Dean smiles a little, his crow’s feet deepening, but he keeps his eyes on the page.
Garth says, “Dean and Castiel, you have defied cosmic odds. May your love grow deeper and stronger with every passing day. May you face every challenge side by side. May you always feel the love and support of your family and friends. And may your life together be one of enduring happiness and contentment.”
A long day at a new school. Sam’s kindergarten class finished the day in the school library, so Dean goes to get him so they can wait for their dad to pick them up. When Sam spots Dean in the doorway he runs to him and seizes him in the biggest hug a five-year-old can give. Dean can’t find it in himself to be annoyed, because he needs this hug, too.
"Hey, hey, Cas, I'm sorry, I didn't think this through, I— of course you might not want that anymore, this was presumptuous of me, I understand—" Cas looks back at him and rejoins their hands.
Dean sits on the pier, transfixed. Cas just stands there. And stands there. And stands there. Dean rolls his eyes and says, "Well don't just stand there all pretty, let's
"Well, yes, it is, but— you know what, nevermind, we'll have that talk later," she sighs and drops back to sit on the windowsill again. "Right now I need you to sit down and give me your phone. We're making you a twitter account."
"Damn, I always wanted one as a kid," Dean sounds wistful and doesn't pay any mind to Cas's sarcasm. Jack looks up at that.
"Yes, Dean, I would also like to know why. Don't you know that forests all around the world are suffering as it is?" Cas looks intently at Dean.
"No, Dean, that's not— I'm just... are you sure? How could you be— I must look rather like a horror to you," behind Cas' uncertainty, though, intrigue grows. Dean smiles.
"Excuse me," Patience turns to look sternly at Claire, "last time I checked these were mine? Shouldn't you ask me first?"
"Okay! Now that has to boil for twelve minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to grate cheese and chop spinach and garlic!" Jack turns away from the stove and to the kitchen counter. It looks surprisingly clean compared to it's condition in the previous video.
And the fact that this— this eldritch horror, this mass of light and energy, eyes and wings and limbs and whatever else — knowing that it's here, with Dean, that something so
this guy really goes from "i am god. look at the huge pentagram we have in our sex dungeon" to "my dads don't allow me to eat sweets and use my phone in the car" WHERE IS THE LIE
"Get your ass here right now. We are making you a twitter account," Claire sounds very, very angry. Jack shares a cautious look with Cas. He probably can't hear what exactly she says but her tone is unmistakable.
"Why didn't you let us meet earlier? Having an older lesbian friend is amazing!" Charlie looks in the same direction as Claire.
"I really like it! I still like my other clothes too, but this is. It's different. But good different," Jack isn't sure how to describe the feeling properly. He knows, of course, that he's God. He is a part of everything and everything is a part of him, yet seeing himself like this — when he's being Jack, when he has a body and a personality that comes with it — it feels like he's discovering a new side of himself. It's exhilarating.
Claire perks up at that and looks up from her phone. "Hey, why don't you try something on? You like it, right?"
"There is— a way, in which an angel and a human could be intimate, that is more... spiritual, than anything. It is an act of absolute trust. A human soul and an angelic grace laying themselves bare in front of each other. Connecting into one whole for a single moment that would feel like an eternity. You would know all of me and I would know all of you — it is like experiencing the entirety of each other's lives in the span of second. Such bond, it— transcends space and time. I'm not sure if that— if that's something you would want, Dean," there is so much in that sentence that scares Dean, and again, not in a sexy way, so he chooses to focus on—
"Do you think this is a good Christmas tree?" He turns his head around to look at Dean, Cas and Charlie.
#justmakesense and other variations of the tag from random things that just make sense in my house/apartment/etc. people share the weirdest, most intimate details about how their living space is set up
"Okay, then how do you know about that? You've done it before?" Dean doesn't want to admit that the thought makes him jealous, but—
There's a choking noise from the left of camera. A woman on the left side of the shot turns to the sound. She signs as she speaks.
"Kid, you sure you need cereal for that dinner?" Dean sounds like he's trying to hide his amusement.
how this conversation was supposed to go, fuck. Okay, he just needs to do this quickly and then go drown himself in the lake, or something.
oh come on these must be actors. how did they manage to stay so serious?? angel??? (camera guy doesn't count lmao)
"Dean, of course. I didn't expect you to even consider it, really," and that, the resigned way Cas says that — it just won't do. Dean leans forward a little. Tries, once again, to catch as many of Cas' eyes as he can, which is still not many, but it's the thought—
"Hey, Cas. Hi, it's, uh— fuck, of course you know who it is. I was just wonderin' if— can we talk? No, do you want to talk? Cause if you don't, I don't wanna make you do anything you don't want to, I guess, but I'd— I'd really appreciate it if I could see you? Just this once, even. Just to know — know for myself, not from Bobby — that you're here, that you're fine. That you got out," Dean gets choked up a little at the end there, but no one is here to judge him, so he doesn't care.
trippy. Feels like being in the spotlight, and, well, Dean had never been much of an exhibitionist or anything, but—
"You have such beautiful clothes," Jack says, watching as Patience holds a skirt to her body in  front of the mirror, then folds it neatly and puts in a stack with other skirts. "They're so colorful and bright. Dads usually wear things that are much more dark and muted."
[attached: picture of the impala on an empty road. On one side of the road is a pine forest, on the other is a field. The sky is dark with an oncoming storm, but it's not raining yet. Colors in the picture are deep and muted. It would not look out of place in a photo gallery.]
"Okay, but, uh. Okay. I swear I'm not tryin' to be an asshole here, Cas, but what is it you think you can't have?" Dean thinks Cas is kind of annoyed now, but he answers, finally. All of his eyes look upwards, as if he's looking for strength from above — which is funny, since they're already "above".
"Oh, Dean, there's nothing shameful in admitting that you're nervous. I wasn't aware you suffered from stage fright," slightly concerned but mostly teasing.
"What makes you think I don't reciprocate, though? I thought, you know. I actually thought that it was
"Yeah, well, probably for the best," Dean mutters to the side, Jack barely catches the words. Dean straightens a bit and looks at Jack. "Anyway, what I wanted to say is, uh. You shouldn't show our faces on camera. Me, Sammy and Cas, I mean. I don't think you have yet, and I thought it's best if it stays that way."
"I... do not understand what you're asking. I thought I was making myself very clear," Cas seems genuinely confused, and he tilts his front head to the side slightly. And that— that's such an authentic
this. He never really felt comfortable being so emotionally vulnerable during his life, and he's not sure he's completely comfortable now, but this is
Dean looks on as his eyes start to finally, finally adjust, excruciatingly slowly. All the light starts to take shape, and it looks like so many things at once. First thing that becomes clear is — it's wings. Wings all over the place, of different shapes and sizes, shining like a rainbow colored light show. Then — limbs, vaguely humanoid, but all different, too. Some of them would not look off on various animals, probably. Rings of what looks to be just pure light (or is it fire?) rotate in a sphere around the whole of— it. There are several heads, too, but Dean can't figure out what they are no matter how hard he tries. The whole thing is just. It's barely comprehensible. Even with all Dean's effort he seems to only be able to catch glimpses of the truth of what's standing before him.
"I don't understand why you are making me do this, Dean. I did not think you enjoyed my suffering," and this is the moment all of Cas' eyes suddenly turn to the side — away from Dean. It's very disorienting.
"How do I get myself a tiktok? People want me to have one, right? It could be fun!" The more he thinks about it, the more excited he gets by the idea. Claire spends a lot of her spare time on tiktok, and makes her own videos often. Jack thinks it would be a great way to understand her a little better.
"Yeah, can't wait for you to tell that to Sammy," amusement haven't left Dean from the start of the conversation and it keeps growing. Jack waves his hand dismissively.
"Hello! I'm going to be cooking dinner for everyone by myself for the first time today! I'm very excited. We're going grocery shopping with my dads right now!" Jack looks up and away from the camera. "Uh, say hello?"
"Okay, so, to sum up the relevant info: I can feel your emotions, because a part of you is now a part of me, and because there are less barriers between my soul and your grace here in heaven. Correct?" Cas rolls his eyes at that — all of them. Dean can't stop paying attention to how surreal it is, with the amount of eyes Cas has.
"What's ARG?" At this question Charlie's face loses all traces of sternness. She smiles and talks excitedly.
Dean lifts the hem of his shirt to wipe his face, flashing his abdomen to the camera in the process.
"But I'm god!" Jack whines. He also might or might not have stomped his foot slightly. It's hard to tell because his lower body is obscured by the counter, and the camera is shaking a bit. "I wasn't god last time! Come on, I'll make it so the eggs won't hurt me."
. If he could just bask in the pleasant warmth of Cas' flames for hours and forget all about how it felt to burn, and burn, and
Jack is still frowning, but he complies and goes to sit down next to Claire. She immediately snatches his phone and shoves her socked feet under his thigh. "What's twitter?"
for him, of all things? Dean is still trying to process that when Cas gets shy, all of a sudden, and it's even noticeable in his voice — which is really weird, Dean thinks. How can he distinguish any emotions in the earthquake that poses as Cas' "voice"? He doesn't know. Dean feels like he doesn't know anything, anymore.
i love how no one is freaking out about the fact that they're seriously discussing this stuff. like, it's just the norm of life now shzh
yes!!! I'd watch a whole stand up performance if he delivered the whole thing in that deadpan tone 12-19
"So, Jack, how do you feel?" Kaia smiles at him warmly. Jack turns to look at himself in the mirror again and smiles, too.
"I regret every decision I have even made in my entire life. From now on, Cas decides everything and I am just a 50s housewife, goodbye."
"I don't think giving him my clothes was part of that job's description," Patience looks at Claire sceptically, then sighs and looks at the ceiling, "
"Shut up, the gay side of tiktok is great," Claire's response is half-hearted, like it's a conversation they've had a lot of times before. She's already tapping something on her phone. "Okay, I'm not going to do anything fancy, just film you and you do whatever, okay? Like maybe wave and do a little twirl or something."
"Plural. Of course. Right. I mean, this whole soul union idea is... interesting, and all, but I don't think I'm ready for that, yet?" Dean is afraid his words are going to upset Cas, but he just feels affection coming from him.
Jack frowns. "Do they? That mannequin is wearing something very similar to what Patience let me try out. The clothes fit me well enough, and I don't think it made me a woman. I'm sure I would've noticed if something like that happened."
"Huh, actually—" Sam kicks him under the table. "I mean! Of course — of course you look great, Jack!"
"Okay, Jack, it's recording," Cas speaks from behind the camera. His voice sounds even deeper than usual.
"Dean, did you make me clean your shirt from batter only so you could use it as a napkin later?" Jack sounds genuinely confused.
Dean quickly chops the spinach with the mastery of an actual chef. "Why did you even choose spinach in the first place? Why not bacon or something? Carbonara is always a good choice."
"How do you know what it's like, then?" Dean is not sure if he's quite ready for that level of intimacy, yet. But later, who knows? He does, hopefully, have the whole of eternity to get there with Cas.
"Oh, come o-on," Claire whines and stomps her feet on the floor in front of where she's sitting with her back to the bed. "I'd let him try some of my own but — and it hurts me to say this, and don't you dare tell Dean I did —  mine and Dean's wardrobe color schemes aren't that different. Pretty please, Patience! It's our responsibility as his big sisters!"
Dean stretches his hand towards the camera. Cas is still laughing. Video ends before Dean can take the phone. ]
[ Jack is standing in front of a wall lit up with fairy lights, next to a closed door. He's wearing an oversized light blue sweater, the front of which is tucked into a yellow skirt, patterned with little daisies. On his feet are white crew socks and white velcro shoes. He smiles at the camera and waves, then does a little twirl that's enough to make the skirt flow. His nails are glittering gold in the fairy lights. ]
Dean raises both of his hands defensively, eyebrows climbing up his forehead. He speaks, looking at Cas. "Hey, it was just a suggestion! I do not advocate for deforestation or whatever. No need to get your—" his eyes jump to Jack, "Nevermind."
Dean stares into the eye. The eye stares back at him. Dean curses himself internally for being so slow and starts moving. Throws caution to the wind — he's dead, anyway, what's it matter — and jumps onto the palm. He feels it, then, a vague but strong feeling coming off of Cas. It's... affection. Dean feels his heart skip a beat. He looks back up at the whole of Cas. As he's being brought closer to his... heads? Faces? He's not sure, but they do become clearer.  One head is that of a lion. Another is of a bird, an eagle, most likely. Dean sees horns in the back — there's probably a head (or is it just a face, after all?) there, too, facing the other way. The face right in front of him looks like a mask with nine eye holes in two neat rows of four and five, but they're not
THIS. he's been taught about knives when he was a child? his grandfather tried to kill him?? he's barely comfortable with his sexuality even tho he has a child with another man???
exists?" Dean gets an impression that Cas would very much like to punch him, or, more likely, squish him like an annoying bug right now.
Cut to Jack standing in the cereal isle. Other than him and a lady picking wheats in the background, there's no one else there. He has a very serious look on his face.
"There. You know, soul sex and all that spiritual stuff is nice and all, but this— I still understand nothin' about how matter and energy and whatever interact here, but this right here feels physical enough to me,
why you calling it a storage room when it's clearly a sex dungeon though. i definitely saw some handcuffs there. and the whole demon RP. very kinky
"Okay, yeah, nope— Cas! Come hold the camera," there's some shuffling, the camera shakes a bit. Jack is standing still, frowning.
"So, what should we do now?" Patience asks. As reluctant as she was to agree in the beginning, other girls' enthusiasm seems to have infected her, too. "You should definitely hang out like this for a bit, feel it out."
Jack thinks about it and nods. "Alright. I do want to try something on, if you truly don't mind." He looks at Patience and she smiles at him.
ok but that person saying the bath story happened in their town had me google and it's true. although it was really hard to find info on this. im starting to believe this shit, too
"Yeah, next thing you tell me the universe is like an onion," Cas' expression doesn't really change — with the way he looks there's not much
Dean sits on Cas' palm, cross legged. Cas follows. It feels almost like free fall for a few seconds, and then Cas is sitting down, mirroring Dean's pose (it's hard to tell for sure, with all of Cas' body parts, but it's close enough). For a moment, Dean tries to imagine what they look like from an outside perspective. Probably like a gigantic, weirdly shaped lamp and a tiny moth. Why, even put like that, does it still sound kinda hot?
Patience looks at him and Jack thinks. He does like the clothes he picked when Sam took him shopping, but, he supposes, things he wears do resemble Dean's and Sam's a lot. Claire scoots closer to him and pinches his plaid shirt with her fingers, tugging at it.
"You're— Cas, you're everything to me. You're my family, and you're my best friend, and I love you, and I—" Dean has to take a deep breath here, "in your own words, I lust for you," Cas' mood sours just a bit at that. Before Dean could ask, he looks to the side and speaks.
"I got a couple for you and Dean, too!" Charlie smiles and shows two similar hearts, only the patterns on them differ — one rainbow and one pink-purple-blue.

But it’s a decent night to be standing around outside; the heat’s not oppressive, and Dean’s not in any hurry. They’d solved a case and saved a kid, no one’s fighting about anything, Cas has stuck around for once, and Dean’s got a nice buzz going.
Dean gives Crowley a long look, then says, “You should watch your back. Lucifer’s in here somewhere.”
, and to live according to my own free will, and to love. And I love you, Dean Winchester.” He smiles and shakes his head. “The memories I’ve regained, and what I’ve learned about myself… They don’t undo everything we’ve experienced together, or how I feel about you.” Gently, he says, “I’m still me.”
Between the wind and the waves, Kat has been nudged from her lying-to position, and she drifts, bobbing on the sea. Dean can feel the pull in his chest shifting as their orientation gradually changes.
Dean relaxes, relief flooding him—if Crowley is here, then so is Gabriel. They’d both died in Apocalypse World.
But there are a few things sitting on the table that can’t be found in any of Earth’s abandoned homes and stores: holy oil, angel cuffs, the key to Death’s Library.
Dean looks at Castiel’s wings, at the way the firelight dances over the dark, shimmering feathers, and then he lifts a tentative hand to place it on Cas’ wing. He glances at Cas and his eyes are closed.
“Listen,” Dean cuts in. “I know Sam’s warded like I am, but can either of you feel Jack anywhere?” He tugs the vial pendant out from under his shirt. “I mean aside from this.”
The original Death gazes at them impassively, eyes flicking between the three of them. His scythe—the one Dean had used to supposedly kill him—is propped against the wall behind him. Traditional and simplistic, it’s out of place in the sleek, ultra-modern library. He wonders now if the library has always been like this, or if Billie’s notions of grandeur had resulted in a remodel.
An hourglass with a plain wooden frame has materialized in Amara’s hand. She flips it and sets it on the blanket, and they all watch as the sand begins trickling down. It takes a few moments, but then Dean notices the light shifting. He looks up to find the sun sliding backward through the sky.
The cold has settled over him like a weight he’ll never be able to move. It has seeped into his skin, made him forget his body.
“Balance,” Dean says, voice flat. “Because the fact that you’re the one walking and talking, and not her—that’s
Amara adds, “After Chuck locked me away, he found and destroyed many of the worlds I’d first created, but I believe there may be some left. I’d like to visit them again.”
“He couldn’t change my memories,” Castiel says. “I imagine it was because I was your creation. So finally I let him take them.” He stares off into the woods as the day brightens, regret etched into his face. “He put my memories in a vault, and locked it away in a dimension he’d made especially for it: the Empty.”
The dance floor remains lively; Dean’s insistence on generous inclusion of Led Zeppelin seems to have turned out alright. Two songs that Castiel recognizes from the mixtape Dean made him are popular with the guests. They love “Trampled Under Foot,” and based on the behavior on the dance floor it’s apparent that many of them are fully aware of the filthy lyrics. “Immigrant Song” generates a huge cheer and some spirited lip sync and air guitar performances. He’s not surprised that one is popular among hunters.
if it was what it used to be.” Gabriel steals Castiel’s beer and takes a swig. “Anyway, those goofy Winchester boys probably make one parent between the two of them, so there’s that, too. He’s not alone.”
A prayer rises in him, filling the space between his burning lungs, between the heavy beats of his heart, between every desperate stride:
Jack’s brow furrows, and he says quietly, “I was scared you were gone forever.” He crosses the room and Castiel pulls him into a tight hug.
“Go,” Dean says, nodding. Then he winces and adds, “You sure you don’t wanna shave first? She might dump you.” Sam rolls his eyes, and Dean smiles and makes a shooing motion. “We’ll catch up later.”
“And…” Sam says, stretching the word out as he writes, like he’s approaching the last item, “a photographer.” He sets the pen down and sits back.
“You were the first,” Michael says. His voice is ragged with grief and filled with reverence. “She created you, and you were the best of us.”
He remembers being so desperate to get rid of Chuck, he’d been willing to sacrifice Jack. His own son.
Castiel wipes his shoes and hangs his trenchcoat carefully so it drips onto the mat and not the floor. “What’re we having?” He spies a roasting pan cooling on top of the stove, and the cookbook from Alex rests on the stand nearby.
He wades over to the waterfall, delighting in the sensation of smooth stones massaging the soles of his feet. Standing under one of the gentler streams of the fall, Dean zones out slightly as the water rushes over his skin.
News of their relationship had inevitably filtered out beyond their immediate circle, and Castiel suspects that Dean had braced for backlash from his fellow hunters. But as far as Castiel knows, no one has ever taken issue with the fact that Castiel’s vessel is male, or that he isn’t human, or both. Although the Winchesters have had a questionable reputation among hunters in the past, their efforts to build a national network have earned them wide respect.
Sam shakes his head, frowning. “I’m not asking you to.” Dean’s startled, the defensiveness draining right out of him. Sam looks him in the eye and says, “I’m saying, make sure you come back.”
Before he can launch into his rant, Castiel cuts in with a chilly, “Hello, Gabriel.” Dean huffs indignantly as Gabriel regards them with a smirk, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. Castiel rests his forearms on the table and raises an eyebrow. “You should know your theatrics have you on thin ice with my fiancé,” he says. Castiel glances at Dean and is pleased to see his expression smooth over, a tiny smile quirking the corner of his mouth.
Gabriel holds up a placating hand. “I’ll only be gone for a little while. Just long enough to get my head on straight, so I can be there for the kid. I know Heaven’s a mess, and Dad’s not coming back anytime soon, so Jack is gonna be the one to fix things. I’ll be around to help, don’t worry.”
“You know the first kind: it’s trying to pretend it’s not vegan. Hot wings made out of cauliflower and that kind of thing.” She takes a bite of her toast. “I’m not a huge fan of that.”
Castiel takes Dean’s face in his hands and plants a firm kiss on his lips, drawing it out long enough for it to take Dean’s breath away, then steps back out of his reach. Dean instantly aches with his absence.
“Then you and Sam are gonna take care of things,” Dean says with a nod. “That’s what Winchesters do.”
Breathing hard, he pulls his hands from his pockets and, with difficulty, pushes himself to his feet.
“No one to cook for,” Dean says. He keeps looking through the recipes, but he’s not really seeing them anymore. “I mean, Cas doesn’t actually need to eat, and Jack doesn’t eat that much,” Dean says, “but I used to make dinner for the three of us all the time.”
He scrubs a hand down his face, gives himself a minute, and then stands up. Time to go get some fresh air.
They meet in the middle of the room, their arms sliding around each other, mouths slotting together, tongues brushing. Castiel presses his hand to Dean’s cheek as they exchange unhurried kisses, and Dean pulls Castiel as close as he can get, his hand firm on his lower back.
In their top-to-bottom search of the bunker, they had turned up a grand total of two possible spells to summon an archangel, but both were noted to be theoretical and untried.
There’s a pause, and it’s just starting to become awkward when Claire says, “Well, don’t worry. He always turns up again.” She slips her hand into Kaia’s, and both girls offer Dean a sympathetic smile.
The forest is clear enough here that they can walk side by side. Crowley falls into step with Dean and shrugs. “Fled somewhere further in, somewhere quieter, if I had to guess.”
“Make whatever preparations you need to,” Death says, “and return when you’re ready. In the meantime I have some reading to do.” Death pulls Chuck’s book toward him, and Dean, Sam, and Jack head for the exit. “Oh, and—do refrain from mentioning me outside of this room.” They all nod their understanding.
The sun is low in the sky, and he takes the little path behind the cabin down to the lake, making the first tracks through the snowfall.
Gabriel joins the others and Dean’s eyes travel over the group. Every one of them has been changed by what they’ve been through.
Sailing has demanded a greater level of effort and vigilance from Dean than the weeks of walking he’d done to get to the beach. Physically and mentally, he’s fighting a constant, low-level weariness that frightens him.
“Well, uh, listen—how ’bout you take a shower, okay? Borrow some of my clothes—take a pair of socks; you never really wanna go barefoot in a place like this—and toss your stuff outside the bathroom. I’ll get it washed for ya.” Dean is aware that he’s babbling, but the only alternative is to listen to next door’s sexcapades. “Uh, then we’ll see if we can’t get that hand taken care of, huh, and you can get a few hours of shut-eye.”
“I’m fairly certain she’s the most powerful witch in the world at this point,” Castiel says. He shrugs a shoulder and one of his wings flutters in a lazy mimicry of the movement.
He looks up, and there’s a hand with polished fingernails sticking out of Chuck’s back, wrapped around the blade of the scythe like it’s a lifeline.
There’s a brief ringing sound, high-pitched and ear-splitting, and then the light fades from blinding brilliance to a mild glow.
Castiel makes a frustrated sound and gets up to start pacing around. His wings are fully visible again now that they’re not passing through the chair, and Dean’s eyes sweep over them. Even when they’re folded, they’re so big they nearly brush the floor.
She’s got a classic elegance about her, so Dean contemplates the names of Golden Era actresses, and there’s one in particular that stands out.
“He’s not useless,” Dean says, shaking his head. “That was his idea earlier, wasn’t it? Checking out the library. It was a good call.” Dean starts stacking their plates. “I’ll talk to him.”
Dean shakes his head, trying to rid himself of that taunting voice, and he spies a curve in the rock wall ahead.
Castiel says, “You can’t see it with the naked eye, but it’s off to the left of Beta Librae.” He gestures, glancing at Dean, who hasn’t bothered to look where Castiel is pointing. “You’re not listening to me.”
He’s already moving off down the hallway, but he’s smiling because he’s certain he got an eye roll out of Sam. He’s smiling because the bunker is theirs, and because he’s got a project to throw himself into.
“Y’see,” Dean says, his tone philosophical, “it can’t just be your favorite music. It’s gotta be stuff people are gonna wanna dance to. And it’s gotta be
Dean, mired up to his waist, screams over his shoulder, “Crowley!” He turns back to Castiel, panicked. “He’s looking for Gabriel. We need him!”
Dean blinks up at him, too dazed to answer. Castiel takes his face in his hands and searches his eyes, and Dean remembers lying in a pine box.
Sam, laughing next to him in the Impala on a sunny day, the two of them singing along to one of his old tapes, and Dean thinking that moments like these are why he keeps fighting.
“Oh,” Dean realizes. “Let me guess: orders. Gotta keep an eye on me, right, since the fate of the world rests with me, and all that shit.” He sighs, weariness settling over him.
He can taste it, sharp and metallic on his tongue. His skin is tight under a dried layer of it. Layers. The stench of it fills the air and the floor is awash with it. It sloshes over his feet when he recoils at what’s left of the person on the rack.
This is the bunker’s dungeon all over again—a trap, and someone on the other side of the door, and only a matter of time before they’re both dead.
There’s no evidence at all of the battle that occurred here earlier; there’s only life, proceeding as normal. A great horned owl is calling somewhere in the woods, crickets are singing, and bats are swooping through the air.
Dean sags and clenches his fist. “God damn it.” Breathing hard, he gives Castiel a hungry look, then scrubs a hand roughly over his face and hauls himself out of the car. Castiel follows, and watches as Dean walks it off, pacing back and forth with the car between them. Castiel subdues his desire with difficulty.
“He brainwashed us, and we forgot all about you both,” Gabriel says, looking between Amara and Castiel. “He told us he’d created Earth—and us, in order to watch over it, because a force called the Darkness was coming to destroy it.”
When they separate, the party breaks from its arrangement, and everyone exchanges hugs. There are happy tears, but mostly there is laughter.
Later, Dean falls asleep on the couch in a patch of autumn sunshine. He wakes up briefly as Jack lays a blanket over him.
The rain tapers off as dawn approaches, leaving the sun to rise over a drenched world amid dispersing clouds, into a blue sky.
Sam sighs and rests his book on his chest, and then notices that Jack isn’t reading his book, either.
“I got a text from Claire… It was… a little confusing, but she said you’d been exposed to a spell of some kind. They were worried and asked if I could check on you.”
“And then…” She pauses, and a spray of stars blinks on in the night sky. “I developed my ideas for Earth.” Dean glances at Sam, whose expression is rapt.
Dean’s arms give out and he tries to shift sideways, but Alastair’s body lands halfway on top of him. He shoves it off him with a grunt that sounds like a sob, leaving the angel blade where it is, and drags himself a short distance away.
Sam takes a sip, coughs, and immediately narrows his eyes at Dean, who isn’t looking at him. “What did you do to my coffee.”
Castiel’s chest fills with a deep ache, a different kind of longing, and after a few moments he is the first to look away.
Dean feels a flicker of shame. He swallows hard, then stows his blade and shakes Gadreel’s hand firmly.
“One thing I don’t get,” Dean says, looking at Castiel. “You were human then. Why didn’t he just leave it alone? Or take your grace before that? Once you die you get sent to Heaven and… problem solved, right?”
Dean shakes his head. “Do not start with me.” He tugs Castiel closer by his lapels and straightens his bow tie. “What do your little blue ones mean?”
“Sure, whatever you like.” Dean gets up. “I gotta go check the laundry.” He slips out of the room as Castiel is getting underneath the covers.
Cas has always turned up again, has always saved Dean. Protected him. It was the first thing he’d ever done, and he’d just… never stopped.
“He certainly didn’t,” Amara says. “He’d committed to being hands-off at that point—as God, anyway—but he couldn’t allow you to die.”
Sam breathes out a small laugh and shakes his head. “No, that wasn’t our last hunt together, and no, I’m not retiring.”
They’re lying on their backs in the clearing. The grass is cool and Dean’s a little chilly without his button-up, but Castiel is warm beside him.
“I hope you can hear me,” he grinds out, and briefly he recalls Purgatory: their trip to collect a Leviathan blossom, and getting separated, and the prayer he’d uttered when he was desperately afraid he might be too late.
Dean glances over the bodies on the shore, but none of them are Castiel, and the trail of prints seems to be leading toward a cluster of huge boulders—maybe Cas was forced to take shelter there, or hide? Dean is about to call out when he sees the footprints veering away into the surf.
And that was exactly what had led them to the dungeon. If only he hadn’t gotten so angry about Chuck, been so bent on killing something.
A great wave brings Kat far in on the beach—sandy, Dean is relieved to see—and he jumps out, an astonished laugh bursting from him as his feet hit solid ground. His knees buckle and he grabs Kat to hold himself up, then hauls her further up onto the sand. Another cold wave washes in, helping him in his efforts and soaking him in the process.
As Dean moves through the gorge, something inside of him resurfaces. Like the wind gusting between the cliffs, it finds its way into the gaps between his pain and weariness and discomfort in the cold.
Inside, the place is lit with a thousand candles. Michael is striding up the central aisle, and Jack is charging after him. Sam catches up to him and stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
Dean brings two slices of blueberry to their table, and nods his approval after the first bite. “This is good pie,” he says, loading up another generous forkful.
Finally, Dean says, “So, what, you telling me this now ’cause that was our last hunt together? You’re retiring?”
Dean takes off his shoes as quietly as possible and debates with himself for a second, but then settles himself on top of the covers. He doesn’t want to make assumptions about what Castiel is okay with, and if they have to share a bed, the least he can do is give him a couple blankets’ worth of privacy.
Castiel nods, wondering which Dean might prefer, and lets the conversation wash over him as he scratches under Callie’s chin. The fine details aren’t of great importance to him, but he respects the significance they’ll have for Dean and their loved ones.
Eileen races down the walk and throws herself into his arms. Everything Sam has held inside since he found her cell phone on the sidewalk comes rushing to the surface. He weeps as he holds her tightly, clinging to her as much as she is to him.
It’s still a long way to the valley floor, to smooth, even ground. Dean starts down the next small hill, moving as fast as he can, trying to be careful even while adrenaline screams through him and
Dean pushes off of the boulder and stretches, but Gadreel stays put. He closes his eyes and tilts his face to the sun.
Dean doesn’t trust his ability to climb, but he doesn’t trust his ability to find a different way forward, either.
The cell. Ferocity and radiance in the shape of a man, mercy in his touch and salvation in wingbeats. The grave. Blue eyes, and an act of love before love had been learned.
They shrug out of their jackets and lay them over the armchair, and then fumble with each other’s clothes—it’s more buttons and layers than they’re used to. They laugh as they struggle to undress each other.
Castiel starts shrugging out of his trenchcoat and jacket, and Dean opens the driver’s door. Castiel tosses his clothes onto the seat, then Dean closes the door and opens the one to the back seat—like they’ve done this a million times.
Dean lifts the foil: baked ziti. “Oh, hell yeah,” he murmurs. He serves himself a heaping plateful and takes his first bite before he’s made it over to the table.
He gazes at the dripping mess before him, admiring the stunning combination of clean lines and broken edges, and the way every wet, shining piece glistens in the firelight.
“Dean,” Sam says patiently. “You finally have a life that you don’t have to document on the fly, with the crappy camera on one of your six burner phones.” He fixes Dean with a look that stills him. “You should have nice pictures,” he says. “So you can look back on them one day when you’re old. You should have them for Jack, and for Mom. And for our kids to see, one day.” Sam gestures between himself and Eileen, and Eileen is nodding.
“Well,” Alex says, heaving a thoughtful sigh. “Jody and Donna are a little like Jack and Castiel. Best of friends, spend a lot of time together. Claire and Kaia are a couple, so that’s like Sam and Eileen. And Patience is my best friend; she’s like a sister to me. But she’s away at school for most of the year. I guess that’s kinda like your mom—she’s off doing her thing and you’re happy for her, but you miss her, right?”
She looks at Sam and then Dean. “One of the waypoints I had in mind was you. Humanity, and the concept of souls. I could hardly wait to see you.” She smiles, and there’s a bittersweetness to it. “But I knew it would take a long time for you to arrive. Earth was ambitious—much more complex than anything I’d ever done before. Once everything got started, though, we were all excited by what was unfolding—Chuck included.
There’s a weak sun above the sparse canopy of trees; since its gradual appearance it has never set, never moved at all. Its light grows steadily stronger, pushing the darkness of the Empty back and back. Now, Dean only occasionally glimpses the impenetrable gloom way out in between the trees, when in rare instances he reaches a relatively clear patch of forest.
Dean opens the refrigerator to find a couple of unopened packages of bacon, a fresh head of romaine lettuce, a cluster of tomatoes on the vine, and a six-pack.
Castiel blinks, lips parting in surprise. His heartbeat thunders in his ears, drowning out the sound of the rain. He takes in the sincerity in Dean’s eyes, and the hope, tempered by the faintest of frowns. Looking at Dean in the wavering light of the candle’s flame, Castiel is struck with the distant realization that some of their most significant moments have happened as he watched firelight flicker over Dean’s face.
He takes a breath, then signs, “I love you,” holding his crossed wrists over his chest for a long, emphatic moment. “I love you,” he whispers, signing it again.
On the other… he hasn’t encountered even a hint of another presence. He tries not to think about how much time might be passing on Earth.
Sam takes a breath and sinks beneath the surface of the river to rinse away the soap suds, then pushes his hair back as he stands up again. Water pours off him, beading from his hair and fingertips, and the humid air settles heavily on his skin.
Hidden beneath a pile of papers, he finds the box that holds the key to Death’s Library. Dizzying relief washes over him.
The instrumental music gives way to a rising acoustic tune, cheerful yet serene, and Castiel and Dean take a half step back from each other, adopting more formal posture. They begin a simple, brisk waltz to Led Zeppelin’s “Bron-Yr-Aur,” and a delighted cheer goes up from the crowd.
Yesterday while walking the property, Dean had discovered the remnants of the private access road leading to the bunker’s garage.
Castiel watches as, with trembling fingers, Dean folds the letter and returns it to its envelope. As soon as it’s safely tucked inside, Castiel reaches for Dean. He pulls him into his arms, one hand cradling the back of Dean’s head, their bodies flush. Dean clings to him, fingers grazing feathers, and he makes a sound that might be a sob. Castiel encircles them with his wings, and Dean takes shaky breaths, his face buried in Castiel’s neck. They stand like that for a long time. Castiel holds Dean, just breathing, his heart thudding heavily in his chest.
Castiel takes a breath, clearly trying to be patient. “I don’t know what this spell has done to you, aside from granting you multidimensional vision, but we need to get you inside,” he says. He takes off his trenchcoat and Dean watches with fascination as he removes it. The coat goes through his wings without issue, although both remain solid in appearance.
Dean grips Castiel’s vest, his breathing gradually becoming shallower, until he seizes Castiel’s lips in a series of hungry kisses, sliding his hands over his chest and shoving his jacket from his shoulders.
Dean had brushed all of this off at the time—so fast it was more like a dodge—but now Sam’s asleep and Dean’s alone in the muggy night. Outside, there’s a chorus of crickets and the occasional rumble of thunder. Somewhere close by, a boat horn blares; somewhere far away, a trail horn wails. None of these things are enough to get rid of the words that have found their way back into Dean’s head. If they ever left at all.
Dean nods. “Yeah, I think you’re right.” He watches Castiel, and wonders how true that might be for him.
Inside, he puts his things away in the master bedroom, then finds the thermostat and cranks the dial. He settles onto the couch with a heavy blanket pulled tightly over his shoulders while he waits for the heat to kick in. His eyes fall on the fireplace, and there’s a big basket of firewood sitting next to it. So he gets up again and builds a fire, then lights it with relish.
Dean’s throat feels tight. “You think… you could ask her to give you one?” He looks over at Castiel.
“Okay,” Dean says. Jack leaves and starts up the stairs, and then Dean follows to call after him. “Hey, Jack?”
Dean plants an elbow on the table and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Cas,” he says calmly, eyes closed. “Give me your angel blade.”
Smiling, Castiel squeezes Jack’s arm. “I’m so proud of you, Jack. And I know you’re going to accomplish great things.” He gets up to go, then adds, “You already have.”
Sam picks up his coffee, tuning into Jack and Mary’s conversation, and Castiel says, “I’m saying something very insightful in response.”
“Yeah.” Dean nods, briefly recalling the intensity of their grief. “But things are good right now,” he says. “Nice change.” He scoots over on the bed, and after a moment’s hesitation, Castiel sits down on the edge of it.
After a moment, a warm hand settles on his wrist. It surprises him, and he feels a flare of embarrassment. But he doesn’t pull away.
“Cas…” Dean murmurs. He looks at Cas—really looks at him, and Castiel gazes back at him. His brows are pulled together in a faint frown, lips parted as he draws a deep, slow breath. His hair is mussed like always, the blue of his eyes is brilliant in the light of the fire, and there’s a shadow of stubble along his jaw. His familiar tie is loosened; the sleeves of his dress shirt are rolled to the elbows. One hand grips the mantel, the other is a loose fist at his side. And he is framed by the heart shape of his folded wings, part of his true form. They are magnificent.
After figuring out their plan they’d gone straight to the clearing, just as the sun was rising. He and Sam are seated on two of the stumps with their backs to the firepit, and Dean stares at the ground, elbows on knees and hands clasped. The sun’s rays are gradually stretching across the grass, burning away the dew.
Sam finishes in the library and goes to the map table. A lantern illuminates a sprawling pile of stuff that he and Jack have gathered from throughout the bunker to pack into two large hiking backpacks.
Back in the bedroom, Castiel opens the window and they get into bed, Castiel sitting up with Dean sprawled out, pressed into his side. He falls asleep quickly, and Castiel listens to the rain, and the sound of Dean’s peaceful, even breathing. He picks the red envelope up from his nightstand and brushes his fingers over its surface. A feeling of reverence spreads through him, spilling over from his heart to fill his body, and extending to the very tips of his wings on the Celestial plane.
let me forget to put warding up. Tomorrow. I don’t care if he says he’s gonna resurrect Bonham so Zeppelin can play a reunion concert at our wedding, that’s the last time he zaps in here.”
If Gadreel is right that he’s being followed by a small army bent on revenge—and Dean doesn’t have a reason to think he’s wrong—then Dean’s search for Cas is endangering him. And possibly the rest of the world, too, seeing as everyone’s looking to escape back into it.
“Dean.” Michael gives him a shrewd look. “I have to say, when your brother said you’d gone into the Empty, I told him there wasn’t much point in waiting for you to come back.”
Dean bucks his hips in an attempt to dislodge Alastair, but Dean can’t shift him. He glares up at Alastair, panting.
Dean recalls the sight of Castiel in a lake, hands raised, and then his head sinking beneath the surface. Only it wasn’t Castiel, then; the Leviathans had already killed him. Dean turns away from the water, drawing a shaky breath.
Gadreel pauses, and then says, “While I was asleep, I dreamt of many things. I have many regrets. Chief among them is murdering Kevin Tran.” Now he looks at Dean. “I am sorry for what I did.”
When they’ve reached shallower water, Gabriel says they’re going to capsize the boat so he can teach Dean what to do if it ever happens.
They lapse into silence, and Sam drifts to sleep listening to the chorus of insects outside the tent.
“There’s no privacy.” Dean leans in, his lips brushing Castiel’s neck. “Sometimes the couple spends practically the whole time apart,” he murmurs.
Castiel feels a surge of joy at the sound of Dean’s voice, and he opens his eyes and turns, smiling.
“Yeah, and you’re gonna show up for the big romantic reunion looking like it?” Gabriel says, incredulous.
Despite the gradual drop in the number of people living in the bunker, the level of activity stays the same as the place transforms from emergency housing to bustling headquarters.
He rolls his eyes. “I work, I watch TV, keep my Baby in good condition… what else can I say?” He shrugs again, feeling a little defensive. “Me and Jack went over to Sam and Eileen’s for Christmas with them and my mom. We did gifts, had a big dinner, the whole nine. That was good. So… yeah. I’m good.”
And quite suddenly, the path Dean has been following comes to an end, presenting him with an entirely different landscape, something it shouldn’t be possible for this lush forest to border so neatly. As he stands within the shade of the trees looking out onto the expanse before him, he feels something in him stirring, sharp and jagged and comforting in its familiarity.
Jack comes downstairs. “Good morning!” he says. Castiel smiles and Jack joins him at the sink to look out the window. “What do you think of the weather?”
It cooled as he was working, so most of the bread is glazed with bright yellow butter, softened but not melted. It glistens in an unappealing way, and all Dean can do is stare.
Dean reaches up to touch Castiel’s cheek. He brushes his thumb over his skin, and Castiel’s eyes slide closed as he turns into Dean’s touch.
“‘May the roof above never fall in, and may we below never fall out.’” He smiles faintly. “That one’s Irish, but I think it suits, don’t you?” He quirks his eyebrow at Castiel and disappears.
Despite wearing fewer layers, his clothes are soaked with sweat, his black T-shirt zigzagged with salt stains. He hasn’t felt the faintest breeze since he set foot in the desert, and the heat sits in his nose alongside a faint dusty scent. Every breath he takes is like standing in front of an oven that’s on full blast with the door open.
Alastair raises his eyebrows at Dean. “Do you have a different answer for me today, Dean? Are you finally ready to get off this rack?” He taps the frame with the whip’s handle. “Hm? Are you going to torture souls for me?”
Castiel laughs softly, his breath dancing over Dean’s skin. “I see one of us needs to exercise some self-control.”
. That last piece of yours? Now, that—that was art.” A slow grin spreads across Alastair’s face. “I learned from you, Dean—and I’m going to apply some of your techniques to your angel.”
And then he’s pulling himself up between the rocks, and he’s there, standing on level ground between the outcroppings. He moves cautiously through the billowy fog and after a few feet it dissipates.
, he pulls the angel blade out of the snow. It’s icy cold but he holds onto it. He was lucky he’d been able to get rid of it in time before; he might not be so lucky if he falls again.
Dean had tossed his response out carelessly, but now he contemplates it, then pauses in his search for a path and turns to Crowley. “Thanks for what you did, back in Apocalypse World. I’m sorry you ended up here, for what it’s worth.”
When he gets inside and finds that no one is on the ground floor, he goes upstairs to Castiel’s room and knocks on the door.
After a long moment, his frown deepens, and then recognition is seeping into his eyes. “Dean,” Castiel says again, more firmly this time. His expression softens somewhat. “Of course I remember you.”
Castiel seizes the Entity around the throat. It struggles briefly, a dripping hand grasping at Castiel’s wrist, but then it’s collapsing in on itself, twisting into a rope of black ooze.
They’ve been on the road, as it were, for almost three months now; yesterday had been the first day of September.
So Dean grips harder, feeling the firm tendon beneath the feathers, and smooths his hands over the insides of the wings. He runs his fingers through Cas’ feathers, revels in the way they feel against his palms.
“Of course,” Michael says earnestly, and Gabriel is nodding. Castiel doesn’t say anything, but Dean isn’t feeling brave enough to glance at him; instead, he gazes up at rays of sunshine filtering down through huge, puffy clouds.
“Come on. Our entire lives have been weirder than a guy, an angel, and a nephilim living together. You already live together, anyway, there’s just a dozen other people also living with you.”
“Well, damn.” Dean opens the book and flips through it. Every recipe has a picture, and some of them do look pretty tempting.
Dean doesn’t answer; instead, he reaches out a hand, stark white with the cold he’s forgotten all about, and brushes the edge of one feather. “Can you feel that?” he asks softly, drawing his fingertips slowly down its length, marveling at its texture, and the way the vane ripples under his touch, and how the feathers surrounding this one seem to quiver.
The air is dry in here, and notably cold. It’s going to take a while for Dean’s soaked clothes to dry so he gets moving, and after only a few yards he can’t hear the waves on the shore anymore. He’s been listening to the sound of the water for so long, his ears ring with its absence.
Finally, he looks up at them. “I should be able to read every word in that book. The fact that I’m unable to is assuredly cause for concern. So I’ll help you.”
Whatever place they’ve slipped into is a black storm. Dean can’t see anything, can’t hear anything but the raging wind. Castiel’s hand clasps Dean’s and their fingers lace together. Castiel’s arm is around him but the wind is tearing at them, relentless and violent.
Here and there, they come up with a few small elements to add to the reception to personalize it, but they don’t go overboard. They also develop a security system: they’ll have plenty of warding, and upon arriving the guests will touch silver and iron. It’s not a perfect system, but they reason that any monster would have to be crazy to want to walk into a group like theirs. Demons are unlikely to show, since they haven’t been encountered in more than two years, but they still opt to include devil’s traps.
Above, the sky is a strip of billowy, dark gray clouds. The light is dim, the static sun hidden somewhere out of sight beyond one of the crags.
Jack looks at both Dean and Sam and they nod at him, so he steps forward and hands the book to Death.
Dean turns to Sam as if he’s just noticed him, eyebrows raised innocently. “You don’t take your coffee with salt?”
Lucifer eyes the blade. “I’m not here to fight with you, Dean.” He smiles slightly. “Been there, done that.”
The following week, Castiel and Dean are sitting across from each other at the kitchen table on their laptops, deep in research. Late-afternoon sun slants through the window, and Castiel squints through the dust on his screen at the thirty-two tabs open in his browser. Dean is typing away, the beer sitting next to him only half-finished.
Dean stirs next to Castiel and he looks down to find his favorite shade of green. Dean smiles up at him. “Hi,” he says, his voice rough with sleep.
“Well.” Castiel takes Dean’s hands. “Marriage has existed for thousands of years. The proof of identity and paperwork are relatively new developments.” He smiles. “We don’t need approval from your government for a marriage between us to be real.” Dean’s expression eases and he nods.
“Okay,” he says, leaning forward and propping his elbows on his knees. “What do I need to know? Am I about to be tripping balls?”
Dean removes the necklace and drops the chain over Jack’s head. “I mean I couldn’t have found Castiel without your grace, and it saved my life. Twice, as a matter of fact.”
Dean’s head whips toward the door and he backs away from it, heart beating wildly, the knife clutched in his hand.
Slowly, he says, “When I was in there… I prayed to you. Did you… When you were asleep, did you hear me?” He holds his breath, afraid of what Castiel might say.
“It’s food that just happens to be vegan. It doesn’t feel like it’s missing anything or trying to be anything other than a delicious meal.”
“Yeah. Oh, I’ll email you the files about the thing in California, but I think I found someone out there who can look into it. And they said they’re good with being added to the network, too.”
At first he’d stubbornly held onto the blade, but eventually he’d realized that he’d better keep his hands warm in case he needs to use it, since he’s already having to rely on his non-dominant hand. So he’d stowed the blade and tucked his hands in his pockets, pulling them out periodically to blow warmth into his fists.
He recalls the simultaneous relief and ache of it. Giving himself over to the fall, and being truly unafraid. The righteous, riotous joy of expressing the most profound of emotions.
Dean swallows his toast and takes in Sam’s cautious expression, the dark circles under his eyes, the faint frown pulling his brows together. Sam’s been looking at him with that frown ever since he and Jack had gotten back to the bunker, and Sam had asked,
So far they’ve stuck to the continental US. As Jack builds back the strength of his wings, they make a short flight every two or three days, with the aim of visiting as many different states as they can.
How different might things have turned out, if he’d just taken Cas home? If he hadn’t been so afraid?
“Don’t you worry your pretty little head about me,” Crowley says, smiling. He makes an upward motion with his chin. “Go and find your angel.”
“I could,” Death says. “But your exit is something you would need to negotiate with the Entity. The Empty is not my domain, and sending you into it is a trespass.”
He keeps to the back roads, and every so often he passes a farmhouse. Most are dark but a couple of them have a single window illuminated, blue and flickering from the light of a television. He drives past fields of winter wheat; planted last fall, it had waited through winter and it’ll be ready for harvest any day now, before the worst of the summer heat strikes. The roads and fields seem to go on forever, but it’s comforting, compared to the exacting endlessness of the Empty’s landscapes.
Dean turns his head, allowing himself to be examined, and a few moments pass while Castiel stares. The wound isn’t deep—it’s already scabbed over and Dean doesn’t need to be healed. But Dean knows that they’re both thinking the same thing: if the blade had sliced just a little deeper, he’d have been gone in seconds, life gushing from him in an unstoppable red tide.
They browse many pictures of possible wedding attire and create a shortlist, factoring in the season, time of day, and desire for comfort, and Jack helps judge. When they’ve selected the winners, Jack stands and holds up his hands. One moment they’re empty, and in the next, he’s holding two zippered garment bags, smiling proudly.
Castiel breaks from their line and strides up to Chuck, dropping a heavy hand onto his shoulder. He pushes, further impaling Chuck on the scythe’s blade, and Chuck growls in pain or frustration or both. Dean hopes it’s both.
“Lucifer killed me,” Castiel says. Droplets of water streak swiftly down over the dome. “And without Chuck around to intervene, I finally wound up in the Empty.”
He leans over to his nightstand and digs around in the drawer for a second. When he straightens up again, he’s holding a small wooden box. He hands it to Castiel with a smile.
He’s holding a belt, with one end of it wrapped around his palm and the buckle clasped loosely in his other hand. Alastair saunters toward Dean and Dean takes a couple of wobbly steps backward, drawing his angel blade as his heartbeat kicks into overdrive.
But Dean stubbornly hangs onto the image of Castiel on the shore. “If I can just find you,” Dean says, “we can fix it. And then…” He falters. Assuming they make it, what then? “We’ll… we’ll figure everything else out.”
It makes Dean uneasy, holds him back from embracing Castiel when that’s the one thing he desperately wants to do.
Later, when Dean drops Cas off at work, he pretends like what he’s doing is fine. He drives off like it’s all fine, and spends the next fourteen hours regretting it.
But Dean doesn’t want to acknowledge any of this. With grim satisfaction, he pours gasoline on the voices.
fire. The firewood only burns itself. There’s no risk the cabin’ll burn down or anything like that. We’re not idiots.”
“Damn, I was gonna get some In-N-Out while I was there,” Dean says. “But no, that’s good. We’ll see you Sunday. And tell Eileen I like her better than you.” Dean smirks and hangs up before he can hear Sam’s reply, then goes to pour himself a cup of coffee.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Hey, you’re talking to me right now, not her. Anyway, you’re gonna have to have Jack over sometime because he can’t wait to meet her. He keeps talking about it.”
Here, though… maybe it’s more like outer space. A very troubling thought, given the scales and distances at play, there—stuff that always makes Dean’s head hurt.
“I see you’ve managed to gather everyone,” Death says, looking at each of them in turn. His eyes settle on Castiel and he raises an eyebrow. “
One of the people who begins to pay regular visits to the bunker is Rowena. It doesn’t take Dean long to notice that when she makes an appearance, Sam seems to spend a lot of time with her, away from everyone else.
Later, long after they’ve put the fire out and zipped themselves into the tent to escape the mosquitoes, Sam is gazing up through the mesh vents at the sky. He can see some stars through the patchy clouds, and he wonders if Michael is out there somewhere, instead of here. And if he is out there, can their prayers reach him?
“Yeah, maybe.” Gabriel’s tone is neutral; Dean can’t tell if he believes it’s a possibility, or if he’s being dismissive.
“Yeah, alright,” Dean says. “But whoever you bring, just make sure they’re fully clothed. My mother’s gonna be there.”
Today, Castiel is wearing something that feels novel, certainly, but not insignificant: a light gray three-piece suit with a sapphire blue bow tie. Dean’s suit matches his, but his bow tie is forest green.
Dean peers at Castiel’s wrist. “Yeah, that looks a little swollen—musta sprained it. Sit tight.” Dean gets a towel and makes a compress with ice from the bucket.
Hoping it’ll be quieter in their room, Dean hurriedly sticks the keycard in the door. But he removes it too quickly, and the red light on the lock stares at him mockingly. He tries again. From next door, there are grunts and gasps, and Dean feels his face reddening.
“They are gathered in the darkness,” Gadreel says, “just outside all of this.” He lifts a hand to indicate the desert. Dean refocuses on the Empty where it meets the horizon, the black curtain he’d stopped registering after a while.
When the stream of light fades, Amara lowers her hand and regards Chuck. His eyes are wide and pleading, and her face is full of grief. “Goodbye,” she murmurs, and then Chuck vanishes.
Dean says, “We got Jack back, you got a lead on Michael. We’re all here, we’re all safe.” He pauses. “I gotta say… it made me nervous—you going back upstairs, with that SOS broadcasting.”
“Helping to create the archangels had sparked something in him, and he took it upon himself to… contribute.” Amara frowns. “He created the Leviathans, and it was immediately apparent that they were vicious, a threat to the balance that was establishing itself. I really don’t like deliberate destruction, so I created Purgatory to shut them safely away. I explained my reasoning to Chuck and he was disappointed, but he seemed to understand.
"Hey! These are amazing!" She takes something from Charlie's palm and shows it to the room. It's a heart-shaped, palm-sized lesbian pride flag with a thin string attached.
Dean has his own house, here, too. It's more of a cabin, really, and it's— well, it's cozy, there's no other word for it. It stands at the edge of the woods, next to a huge lake. On the horizon are mountains that sun rises from every morning. You can actually make it any time of day you want, here, but Dean likes to keep up this small routine of normalcy. Plus, he always enjoyed witnessing the sun raise and set. It's a beautiful sight. Always makes him feel calm, grounded. Proof that he survived another day — an ironic thought, now that he's dead.
Cas rolls away and takes Dean’s hand. He makes a show of placing two fingers to Dean’s wrist. “Still beating.”
“Dude. Eddie Van Halen. Van Halen?” Dean asks with increasing incredulity. This guy has to be messing with him. But when Cas just frowns, Dean has a sinking feeling that no, he might just not know. “You don’t know Van Halen? The band.”
Until suddenly, it doesn’t. A man slides onto the barstool beside Dean’s and orders a beer. He’s an awkward-looking guy with messy dark hair and an ill-fitting suit under an even iller-fitting overcoat. His features are nice enough: strong jawline, eyes Sinatra blue. He grips the beer bottle with long fingers. Under that terrible overcoat, his shoulders seem pretty wide.
He signed his name-tag Eddie Van Halen. That has been the giveaway of his whole attitude. People would walk up, see that name, and turn around. They know he’s not serious. It’s worked well all night.
Dean pulls back, obliging. Cas smiles so wide his skin crinkles near his eyes, and Dean falls in love all over again.
Cas’s smile softens. He doesn’t have to say it back. Dean can see the way those eyes sparkle. They always do when he looks at Dean.
But, weirdly, Dean doesn’t seem to mind. Instead, he laughs for the first time in a long time. “Think I found the only guy in the whole world who doesn’t know…” He shook his head. “Just call me Dean.”
When Cas asks Dean about his band, Dean has to come clean. “I’m not in Van Halen.” He motions to the name-tag. “This isn’t my real name.”
Dean plucks the beer from the counter and heads back to the table. He places it with a thunk in front of Cas. Cas moves a couple more candy pieces and then turns off the screen.
Dean waits, knowing Cas will speak his truth if shown enough patience and compassion. The guy’s not used to having people care about him. Not even Dean. Not even after all these years.
“Look, you know I like to cuddle. But that’s all we do. Sleep and cuddle. It’s not like we’re having sex.”
Cas kisses him again, and somewhere between the couch cushions and the floor, Dean gets lost for a while.
Dean frowns hard. The cellophane whines in his tightening grip. Cas loves Europe. Every phone call, every email.
Normally, he’d wear a t-shirt and jeans, maybe with a flannel over-shirt. But after a six month separation with a 7 hour time difference, when Cas studied abroad in Europe, Dean’s pulling out all of the stops. He wants Cas to know how special is he and how much he means to Dean. The suit is part of that, and the flowers. And the ring in a small velvet box in his inside pocket.
Cas gives him a flat side-eyed look that Dean only catches half of before he has to look at the road again. What he saw, though, has him laughing.
She hums. Her hands find her hips and she searches his face. He doesn’t know what she’s looking for, but after a moment, her smile softens and her shoulders slump.
Fire burns hot in Cas’s eyes. If he had any angel mojo left, the phone no doubt would burst into flames. “I
“Sure, pal,” Dean says with a laugh. It doesn’t last. Not while Cas is frowning. “Now why don’t you tell me what’s wrong.”
Cas laughs, and Dean absolutely melts at the way the skin near Cas’s eyes crinkles. He wants to do this right, all of it. No more secret pining. No more fear his love is unrequited.
Dean can’t quite believe how time flew. Paying his tab, walking outside, feels a bit like coming up for air after swimming underwater. With Cas beside him, he kind of wants to drown.
But even as he’s trying to see Cas as she does, he knows he’s coming up short. He can’t look at Cas and not see the coat he carried around in his car for a year, the one he desperately searched for in the wilds of Purgatory. Or the blue tie that Dean’s shown him how to put on straight enough times now that he
Cas leans back. His weight is a grounding heavy on Dean’s legs. Dean cups Cas’s face in his hands and waits for the lust to clear from Cas’s eyes.
Dean covers his face with both hands and takes a breath. When he lowers them, Cas is looking at him with bright, curious eyes, like he’s genuinely interested. He really has no idea.

Then Dean feels it — doesn't hear it, not in any conventional way, but feels it. Cas' voice. It's everywhere around him and inside him at the same time. Dean can't tell if it's high or low — it feels like everything at once, kind of an echo effect, but not really. Everything about Cas is
Charlie smirks at that, and her voice is full of pity as she says, "Oh, Dean. You do know that we are bound to do something targeting you, specifically, after you said that, right?"
"Well, I think mine is the same as Stevie's here," she grins and looks at the woman sitting next to her.

"Okay, uh, maybe a weird question, but do you have any smaller hands?" Cas' confusion grows, but he moves, and— Dean's breath catches.
