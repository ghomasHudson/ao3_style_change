Charlie cringes. She doesn’t need reminding about what was said. She didn’t agree to any of that because she wanted to. She agreed, because Dorothy deserved better than Charlie with one foot in Oz, one foot in the real world – and god, she’s still fucking doing it. A home in two worlds is doable – but when you can’t help but think of one of them as the “real world,” the one that your girlfriend doesn’t live in, well, there’s the problem.
“Were you wishing you were the hooker, Dean?” She manages, before bursting into fits of giggles again.
He closes the door, makes his way slowly towards the kitchen. The little dragon gets stuffed at the back of a cupboard, behind cans of preserved fruit and jars of jam so old that they look like they’re thinking about gaining sentience. A cupboard for forgotten things.
“That was about 10 years ago,” Sam says, “so that means you’ve got somewhere between 60 and 130 years of bad luck to ride out.”
He plays cat-burglar on the second floor, winks at a bemused small child as he slinks along the walls, ducks behind the marble bar and fiddles with the combination of one of the two 3,000-pound vault doors.
He waits until Sam is out of sight, slips out the phone he pickpocketed and looks at the screen. It’s a few seconds before Lelahel realizes what’s happening, wipes it clean with a not quite subtle enough wave.
Dean nods, thumbs through to the start of the book. There it is, the very first entry, written in shaky handwriting.
They eat a silent and tense meal of shitty diner food, and then retreat to a motel for the night. The receptionist at the first place they try gives Dean such a skeevy look that they bolt immediately, worried they’re gonna get the cops called and have to try and someone convince them that this is wholly innocent and Jesus Christ why would you even think that?
They’ve been striking so many names off the list, either dead when they found them, or dead by the time they left them, that it comes as a surprise to be greeted with something other than blood or rage.
Cas just snorts, shuffles over and lies against Dean. It feels good. Okay, it hurts a little, but he’s in pain all over anyway. At least this way he gets something pleasant out of it.
I could just have held him down and given him the heroin, obviously, but that wasn’t the point. I wanted him to beg me for his own downfall. I wanted to take the pride that led him to defy the will of heaven and destroy it. I didn’t want the drugs to break him,
Lelahel exits the Impala, grabs the thrown phone and runs to where Sam is, out of sight, hotwiring a car.
Hannah hmmms disbelievingly, hefts the weapon and aims it. Which, considering they are in a fucking Jeep (mk 2) thundering along at considerably over the speed limit, not cool. Charlie gives her a panicked look and she rests it back on her lap.
“Yeah, we get it.” Dean interrupts. No time for reasons, he just wants fucking answers. “We need a way of trapping him there while we get all these people evacuated.”
Dean laughs, goes to slap Cas on the back and course corrects. They all keep doing it, remembering, but not quite in time to avoid the awkward hand waving.
“Fine.” He sighs theatrically, takes the glass of water Katie has just settled in front of him. “After I finish this.”
“Didn’t either of you notice something a little, I don’t know, odd about how I woke up this time? Like uh, how I didn’t
“It’s not that I want to go back. I don’t.” He tips up on the balls of his feet, so his eyes are dead level with Dean’s. “I wouldn’t give this up for anything, understand that, please. But I do miss it. It’s a kind of nostalgia. Like when you listen to your dad’s music, or eat the type of food your mother cooked. It helps you feel connected to them. It doesn’t mean you want to be five years old again, give up all the things you’ve fought for and won for yourself.
Cas’s glare dials up to full, dangerous smirk, one hand snaking forward to cup Dean’s hip possessively, the other up to his mouth, thumb brushing over his lips, which part slightly as he whines.
“I’ll bear that in mind next time the urge to insult you overcomes me. It’s fine if I tell you the dishwasher thinks your hair looks a mess.”
“They stopped after Cas y’know, reassembled me. I got off light it being this long, used to be every few months.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know.” She winks. “I beefed up the non-magical security a little bit. Cameras, motion detectors. Wards are great, but maybe one day the person banging on your door won’t be repelled by salt and iron.”
Writing demonic contracts is quite fun to do, but not very interesting to watch. Even so, Dean seems rapt. He’s standing over Crowley, eyes flicking back and forth over the page as the demon fills it with scribbles.
“I can’t sense any more angels nearby, but it might just be the Horn interfering with my powers. We’ll just have to wait and see.
What do you say to that? What possible thing can you say to someone, who’s just heard those words from the one person they’d finally started to trust that they never would.
Nothing happens for a few moments, the flames flicker as before. Everything stays, unchanging, unburning.
Lucifer doesn’t leave him in pain for long, heals the finger and relaxes his stifling hold on Cas’s grace.
Apparently the giddy joy at being free to walk the earth once again isn’t quite enough to outweigh the bitter fury of an apocalypse thwarted.
“So, you said Sam breaks things when he’s trying to help, that mean you think this spell will break you?”
SORRY FOR THE GAP. The 11th of December was the busiest day of my working year and I had to write so much copy leading up to it that my creative brain was dead. Unfortunately that happened to coincide with the point in the story where I realised one chapter needed to be three so I had to write them all from scratch.  Shouldn't happen again, no promises though because I suck.
“I suppose we can see when we get there. There are some decent sized thrift stores, but they might not have much in uh, in your size. We’ll have to hit a few probably.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean’s voice is soft, and when Cas comes back to himself, blinking dazedly, he can see a hint of concerned frown. He’s hiding it well, but not well enough to fool Cas. “Did I ever tell you about one of our early hunts, the one with all the mirrors?”
Cas stirs, a little noise and something that might have been a flinch. Dean swallows sharply, gently rolls Cas off him and leaves the room.
He wants to wrap up, but of course it’s not going to be that easy. Dean tries to deflect the conversation, because from what Lucifer can gather, that’s what he does. Some kind of weird doublethink where he decides if he avoids his problems that’ll make them go away. Might work for awkward conversations, not so good for looming apocalypses. Stupid bastard.
She sets her laptop up to run some false coding looking bullshit, turns of the lights, gently rests her hands on Dean’s shoulders and walks him back to the bed. He looks at her, gaping, confused.
As another two days go by and no-one sees Sam in the flesh – although there are signs he’s been a-prowl in the night, missing books from the library, a steadily depleting pile of healthy snacks – it  develops into a running joke. At breakfast Charlie hypothesises that Sam never left his room at all, that he’s still holed up there and waiting for the perfect moment to make a break for it.
He’s not sure, entirely, that the simile works. You can fix a broken tap. He’s increasingly starting to doubt that he, himself, can be fixed.
Things are sort of awkwardly silent for a minute, and then Dean hauls himself up out of the water with a grunt of effort.
“If I wasn’t cut off from heaven by my own choice, if I was attempting to recruit – whether for safety in numbers or for something more forceful, this is exactly the sort of document I’d set about creating.” Druiel says.
“How?” He croaks, and he pretends it’s because his voice is raspy from the strangling, and not the gut punching idea of having to live forever – without Cas, and then Sam, and then Charlie, and Jody, and Donna, and Garth, and Claire and every single fucking person he has left.
Lucifer leads Dean on a rambling route to the garage, all but mentally rubbing his hands together with glee.
He can see Dean quavering, see him fighting the urge to reach out and touch. So Lucifer gives him what Cas would never think to – the tactile comfort he craves.
They follow Tahariel down corridors. He can feel something, something hideous and wrong, and he hones in on it. He strides to a final door, stops outside it and gathers himself, signals to those behind. He can feel a presence in there, pulsing, demonic.
Cas can hear something laughing behind him. He doesn’t dare turn around to look, he has to concentrate on darting ahead, using his grace now to add speed to his stride, blasting the trees whenever they start to pull themselves together to block his path. The damage is done, anything that would be alerted by expulsion of grace already knows he’s here, so now he might as well put it to some good use.
“Look, I’m not tryna be a prick.” Dean says, while Cas is drinking and can’t interrupt him. “I just, after what happened last time, and your cough is still bad it’s just easier if I cut the goddamn onions.”
Except, that’s not fair, that’s not the truth. Dean being spared eternal suffering, and the continued existence of everyone else on earth today, that’s what is being weighed here, in the balance against Cas’s life. And of course Cas is gonna say that’s worth the trade. That’s why he’s Cas.
“When we went clothes shopping.” And that woman took one look at me and thought you were slapping me around, he leaves unsaid. He can tell by Dean’s pinched expression that it wasn’t unheard, regardless.
He doesn’t want to wake up warm and craving the high that was forced on him over and over again, until he didn’t think he could live without it, until he’d do fucking anything to maintain it.
Except he’s too much a coward – proffers his arm to Sam instead. Sam unwinds it slowly, carefully, like he’s worried about hurting Dean.
“I gotta take this call, I’ll be back in a little bit, Cas, okay? And I’ll bring some food with me.”
He rubs at his eyes, looks again and sees nothing. He darts over to one of the other people by the side, fucking rubberneckers.
Cas sees the glazed eyed panic of Dean’s expression, the way he’s shaking as he looks at Sam, and then to Cas himself. And he’s good, and he knows Dean, and he’s ready. Dean lunges forward, and Cas meets him, rolls him off the bed, dodges a lunge with one of the few weapons that would kill him. He goes for Dean's head, doesn’t waste time like he usually would when mojoing Dean, no tender touch, no gentle cradling of the face. Just two fingers slammed against his forehead,
It’s funny, Cas hadn’t thought he’d missed the taste of beer. It would have been the last thing he asked for if he was given the choice. And yet. And yet it’s so welcome, so familiar. It tastes like humanity – the good things about it. The post hunt celebrations, the bonfires and barbecues, relaxing in front of the TV or in a bar. The taste of it from Dean’s mouth when they’re drunk and horny and lost in each other.
“Okay. How ‘bout we make this interesting then. We have a race – winner gets to decide what we make next.”
They settle into comfortable silence as Cas picks the thinnest, weirdest and most obscure looking recipe book he can find from the kitchen shelf. At this point Dean can’t even tell if he’s doing it on purpose to be a dick, or because that’s genuinely what interests him. Dean’s just got his fingers crossed that he doesn’t end up having to eat anything super fucked up like sheep’s eyeballs or camel’s testicles or something.
He gestures to where Dean is hollering and wolf whistling. Sam is sitting next to him, trying to look as small and unobtrusive as possible.
Cas feels fine the entire drive to the garden centre – it’s a little way away but picked specifically because it sells some weird and arcane shit. Perfect for a hunter’s functional herb garden. Not that Cas is planning for the whole garden to be like that. A mixture of function and form.
Cas comes up behind him while he has his hands up in the air, fits his arms around his waist and nuzzles into Dean’s back. He brushes one hand over Dean’s crotch, nudges the bulge of his own cock against Dean’s ass.
“As long as my trial is fair, dude.” Dean throws over his shoulder as he checks the point. Cas’s, which makes them almost even. Holy shit.
Deans scrapes his hand through his hair. Cas has to make everything fucking difficult, and so incredibly fucking simple that you can’t refuse him, at the same time.
They’re gentler than they look, all harmless rough and tumble fun, and the moment Cas makes a noise of pain they all back off apologetically.
Because he’s hiding something from Dean, of course he is. And maybe he’s doing it for the sorts of reasons one might expect, to be noble and spare Dean suffering.
Lucifer tries to ask him if he wants to use the veto, but he can’t make himself heard over the din. That’s fine, though. He only asks Cas to hurt him, doesn’t think he really needs to – or could – make this worse right now.
Cas just growls in response, a low, dark noise. This is spiralling rapidly out of control and he can’t summon the right words to stop it, can’t summon
And the kicker is, the worst fucking thing is that yeah. It’s not even really true that he was better when he was younger. Things were easier, but he wasn’t happy. He’s been happy these last few months, in between the fights and the pressing, suffocating worry. He could live with the seesaw between joy and dread, if he had to. But nah, it’s always gotta come to fruition. You can’t hold the tide back forever, or some bullshit.
“No.” He laughs, “It has nothing to do with the fact that he’s off throwing himself into harm’s way because he finds being here too uncomfortable.”
Cas settles his hands on Dean’s hips, kisses him fiercely and then pulls away, grabs his hand and leads him back to the tub. They shed their trunks along the way. They’re almost in the water before Cas remembers the lube and doubles back to paw through his duffle.
Sam looks at him steadily, nods. Dean can see the gears spinning, knows Sam reckons he has more of a chance of turning Dean if he gets him alone. Yeah, well.
Maybe if she runs far enough and fast enough, what she keeps repeating over and over in her head will be true.
“No-one’s gonna attack the bunker,” Sam asserts, turning a pitying look on Cas when he snorts. “Look, this place is safe. I promise. I know it’s hard for you to trust the word safe, but it is.” Cas doesn’t say anything, so Sam keeps trying. “Is the risk of attack only thing holding you back? ‘Cause if so, that makes it
“It’s hard to explain. There’s something about it, something intangible, something of the feel of it that reminds me…”
“And if you kill me to try and escape the contract it’ll result in your soul being claimed immediately.”
Dean lets out a low wolf whistle. Sam groans with embarrassment, but Ash grins at him, takes an exaggerated bow.
Dean howls back at it, dives forward and lashes out twice, severing both wings in quick succession. Before it can have a chance to transform or heal itself, he plunges the angel blade into its chest, skewering it clean through.
These aren’t the werewolves he’s used to. They’re more wolfish, for one. Long muzzles and yellow eyes and teeth, fur thick enough to bury your hand in. They look less like the real thing and more like the movie version. Probably not surprising, I mean this is all in his head, even if it does somehow have the potential to kill him. He’s seen more fictional werewolves than real ones, and for god’s sake, fucking Garth is a real werewolf. Like he’s gonna find that shit scary any more.
He’s vaguely aware that Cas has been trying to get his attention for a while, but right now he doesn’t give a shit. Right now it’s just him and the fucking cacophonous music of destruction.
“We’re all working to build that back up, but part of that on our side is treating him like an adult, who can make his own choices. I mean, fuck, he’s a million years older than we are, even if he ain’t always wiser. He knows his way around spells, and something about this one has the absolute fear of fucking god put into him. If he says its bad news, I say we trust him, be where he needs us – on his side, not shooting him down or forcing him around.”
The wings aren’t a huge shock. He was expecting something worse, really, from Sam’s at first subtle, and then increasingly obvious attempts to keep them hidden.
“Dean?” He snaps back to reality when he hears his name – Cas’s tone somewhere between concerned and annoyed.
“You said there are two reasons. Two reasons for the nightmares and the forest.” Dean speaks up again, and his voice is rough but unwavering.
“So, anyway, beautiful sunny day we set off. We had no fucking clue where we were going – and he wouldn’t tell us. Just said to pack up our swimming stuff and shut our faces.
Things get really awkward for a moment, but then somehow Dean ‘foot in mouth’ Winchester manages to swoop in and save the day.
He moves to press his advantage, but she’s on her guard now, whips away to take stock. She makes a violent flicking gesture with her hand and a barrage of wind whips up around Dean. It doesn’t unbalance him like she clearly intended though, just rips the bandage off his arm, reveals his mark.  Her attention zeroes in on it and she narrows her eyes, frowning like she wants to get a closer look. Because of course she wants to fucking see it. Seems like everyone but Dean does. Yeah, well, they can all go fuck themselves.
I hadn't abandoned this fic, don't worry! The opposite in fact. I was kinda blown over by how many people were actually still reading so I got my arse into gear and...... I have now got a finished first draft! I just need to type it all up because I was making the most of the 3 day long British summer and writing in the garden.
He hears Sam’s footsteps behind him, turns and shakes his head. If he's gonna be forced to fucking do this, he's gonna do it alone. And then he’s gone.
Dean sheepishly works out the next set of co-ordinates, plugs them into Charlie’s satellite program thing – which, by the way, looks so illegal that it’s making even his
A slight exaggeration, perhaps. The despair hasn’t dug in too deep as to be all consuming, he still has things to live for.
He’s about to give up and go back when he hears a crash, something falling to the ground. He kicks the door open and sees Cas lying on the floor by the bed, eyes closed, belt tied around his arm.
Despite doing his best to be uninterested and aloof, Cas is actually the first to spot any animals from the window of their rented Land Rover.
Cas reaches a hand up and Dean tries to swat it away, tell him to save his energy, but then it’s cupping his cheek and Cas is looking up at him with this mixture of relief and joy and something else. Something which Dean won’t give a name to, because he knows it’s just wishful fucking thinking. He’s just reading his stupid crap into Cas’s perfectly innocent affection for a friend.
Cas can’t help the full body shudder that passes through him at the idea of Zachariah’s hands being anywhere near Dean in that fragile state. It took a lot of coaxing from his grace to soothe Dean’s mental scars, another angel taking less care could have—
Sam splutters at Dean, like he’s lost his fucking mind. Maybe he has, but he knows something Sam doesn’t.
Dean fidgets a little, realising suddenly that he might be hitting on a nerve. “Yeah, kinda, I guess. I mean, getting all that stuff dumped in your melon.”
God anymore. Still, sometimes moments like this take him by surprise, trigger a deeply buried instinct to praise his Father for his mercy. It always comes chased by another, more bitter thought. Where was that mercy when I
And wow, that’s a whole other heap of issues. Sam knows he shouldn’t feel guilty for jumping to suspicions about Cas – all the evidence pointed firmly in one direction – but it’s hard not to when the guy is lying, feather light and seemingly checked out, in your fucking arms, not even twitching.
And he’s a grown man now, and Sam is his brother not his dad, but that look still fucks him up – still triggers old, deep memories and instincts.  The desire to run, the knowledge that he needs to stay and take this beating so that someone else doesn’t have to.
“You had a blip, I get it.” Dean dismisses it more easily than he should, wants to avoid talking about it. He pats the bed. “C’mon then, there’s a new Attenborough documentary on Netflix. I know you love that nature shit.”
“It might help.” He says. “Seeing something like this – easy and intimate – that it’s still possible. If things get rough, y’know.”
Cas doesn’t snap back at him. He’s too tired for this. He just wants to go and lay down in bed with Dean. Sleep for real this time, and not as a result of some draining sigil. He wants peace and he wants calm.
They flip a coin for the break, which Charlie wins. She takes the shot, scattering the balls across the table, and then passes to Cas.
Dean’s so busy looking up that he doesn’t even notice the elaborate mosaic work covering the floor until Cas crouches down to trace his hands over the rough surface, bumps and cracks and fractures.
The creature finally lunges for him, and as he ducks the blow he hears something behind him, a slight crunch of leaves, the hiss of air being displaced.
Whatever, he has options. He bites the inside of his cheek, sticks his finger in as if to niggle at a tooth and wets it with blood. He's gotta make this quick, or she'll get suspicious.
He can’t listen to them try and comfort him, or god forbid, tell him Cas’ll be in a better place (Dean’s been to that better place, and let me tell you, the only angels there were alive and shitty and hadn’t burned themselves up as fuel for a fucking binding spell)
“Look, he, uh, he wants to talk to you. But, he still doesn’t think I’m real – doesn’t think you’re real either.”
Sam’s glad that he’s the one doing this. That Hannah, or god forbid, Dean, doesn’t have to see the state of Cas’s body under his clothes.
But whatever it is, Cas is sure it’ll only be temporary. He needs to make the most of this – needs to warn Sam and Dean that he can no longer be trusted. He’s not going to try and force Lucifer out entirely, they still need him to take on Amara, but he knows that whatever plan Lucifer is pursuing against Sam and Dean, it relies on them being oblivious to the devil in their midst.
‘Cause Cas has two graves, really. There’s one in a muddy hole in the ground in the woods somewhere outside the bunker, the one for show, the one to mourn at. But there’s another one, the place where what’s left of the actual stuff of Cas is buried. The barest blue flicker of his grace embedded in flesh, a pulsing monument to his sacrifice.
“Don’t worry,” she continues, “if he was my boyfriend, I’d spend all my time staring dreamily at him too.”
The pain in his head is deepening, throbbing. His muscles are screaming and the ever-present craving is fighting its way back up into compulsion territory.
that Dean can’t help but fucking laugh. He rolls his hips a few more time, clenches around Cas’s cock, and suddenly that’s it for him as well.
“Promise,” Dean replies, as Cas soothes his tongue over the mark, tastes the iron tang of blood and realises that maybe he bit a little too hard.
Cas will heal. Finish this, and he’ll heal it away. Don’t worry about gangrene, or blood loss, or fuck, Cas dying, unconscious and without Dean by his side. At the hands of one of his only friends. It won’t happen. He’ll be fine.
“Have you seen the size of our freezer. We could pack enough food in there that we’d never have to go shopping again.” Sam retorts.
Charlie decides this seems like an appropriate time to pop up from the other other side of the garden – luckily there’s 3G out here because man, that was uncomfortable intimate in places.
Sam lifts him carefully up, and somehow it feels less humiliating than he thought he would, and lowers him gently into the water.
It’s been somewhat of a charmed week. No incidents or near fights. Not that Cas is suggesting Sam was the cause of any, it’s just a coincidence that he went to ground this week. They’re all getting a little more used to the pattern of their lives now, things are settling somewhat.
Lucifer says it faux-casually, delights in the way it finally rouses Cas to make a noise – a strange, broken little exhale.
Sam can think of a dozen reasons why he’d lie if he was in Cas’s place. Because he’s mad with cabin fever – fed up of being babied and trapped inside a concrete bunker. Or maybe, just maybe, because all the despair and self hatred are symptomatic of something deeper and nastier, and the reason he doesn’t want to heal faster has nothing to do it putting Dean in any danger, and everything to do with some kind of suicidal spiralling.
“What I know is that if you keep this up the Yellowstone Caldera is going to become a lot less dormant.”
God this is a fucking mess. What happened to the good old days, when the most complicated questions he had to ask were:
She’s lucky it’s not Dean, there’s something about him when he’s vulnerable that she can barely stand. It hurts, like a goddamn knife wound. Sam she can deal with a little easier, he’s dissimilar enough to herself that she can give him what he needs – wind him around to other points of view. Dean, she understands far too goddamn viscerally.
He lets out a long sigh, relaxes slightly into his chair and listens carefully as the next person starts to tell their story.
He hands over one of the rubber balls. Cas accepts it, looks vacantly at it, unsure as to what Dean wants him to do now.
Sam answers the door to Hannah’s impatient knock, and he’s so surprised to see the vessel she’s using, that instead of letting her in he frowns, asks, “I thought you gave Caroline back?”
He nudges in mocking tune, but the angel is still frozen, trying his hardest not to process what’s going on.
Instead she goes with, “Well, if he asked someone more co-operative, where might they have directed him?”
Cas’s frustrated anger melts away at Dean’s awkward fluster. He’s like a thousand cliché teenagers rolled into one 6-foot package, awkward and shy around the guy he loves. Cas could never resist his charm, neither the calculated version nor the natural one. But he’s tired, so tired he can barely string a sentence together. Anything and everything he does nowadays comes with a physical toll, but this day was loaded with an emotional one too.
It doesn’t take long to realise something is wrong. The bunker’s door has been wrenched off its hinges, lies buckled on the ground. Great, ugly knife marks have been gouged into it, some kind of sigil, at Dean’s best guess, but nothing he recognises.
They start to unload the supplies with only minimal bickering after that. Cas decides he can’t be fucked with walking right now and designates himself chief passer of bags to the actual three pack mules, standing by the car with a smug smile while they walk back and forth.
“Not in this case. If you overexert yourself you could put your recovery back weeks. And, not only that, I’d have to explain to Dean why I let you get injured—”
“I told you we shouldn’t have stopped for so many breaks.” He gripes, as the car glides gently down the wide, sunlit streets.
There’s been a lot of that going around recently, a lot of people trying to use humour as a coping mechanism, and a lot of people who’re too strung out and fucked up to appreciate the jokes.
Dean sits up, gives a brief, bitter smile. One that Sam can’t even place, tell whether it’s Cas, or Dean.
When he saw the figure lying in the dirt he was so, so sure it was Dean. Looked like him, even smelled like him. Mostly. There’s something off. Benny pulls in a few deep lungfuls of air, tastes Dean, tries to parse out the different elements.
Dean sighs, runs his hand through his hair. That’s almost a relief. He’s gonna have to hang out with hunters all day long, this gives him an excuse not to share a fucking motel with them either.
Things actually get a little better after that. Cas is still in pain, he still wants to throw up every five minutes, he still gets overwrought with bouts of anxiety and sudden, desperate, clawing need, but he has something to focus on, a reason to battle through it.
“There’s no way this is going through the front door.” Dean realises, staring at the very flat, but very tall box.
“It’s not connected to the spell. Just an enchantment Crowley used to keep it bound here. Easy enough to break.”
“My “melon” has spent millennia being erased, tweaked, rewired and rewritten. Gaining something instead of losing it almost felt like a welcome gift.”
Cas gets as far as to ask, before Dean surges forwards and crushes their mouths together in a frenzied kiss.
Every time his brain tries to throw it up, derail him and bring him stuttering to a halt, he drags up a counter image – Cas shackled to the wall in that room. Abandoned, strung out, half dead. He lets it fuel him, unrelenting rage and fury.
Lucifer says in the memory, as he summons up his angel blade. Not Cas’s – Sam won’t be able to tell the difference, and Lucifer isn’t touching Cas’s tainted, dirty instrument unless he has to.
And now he’s woken Dean up. Great. He tries to say something and it comes out indistinguishable behind teeth he didn’t realise were clenched. He forces himself to relax somewhat, and tries again.
Cas doesn’t have the energy to be polite and turn it down. He just mumbles thanks and grits his teeth as Dean gently cleans his wounds.
It took him so long to finally look at the goddamn things, they built up so hideous and so disfiguring in his head, that this almost feels like a let-down. In time they’ll heal, and scar, and he might even be able to pass them off for a tattoo, or some deliberate form of modification if someone catches sight of him without his shirt.
“Oh.” Dean says, and Cas nearly laughs. Oh. The whole of the english language and a slapdash host of dead ones to choose from, and Dean goes with ‘oh’.
Cas shrugs. He hasn’t got any more information on the voice, other than that he stars in the film Love Actually. Aka, the film Charlie has somehow tricked them all into seeing.
to be held by Dean – who settles his arm gently over Cas’s shoulder and nuzzles at his hair, breathes him in. It shouldn’t feel like he’s finally found home and all of that clichéd bullshit.
He lets a finger brush fractionally over Dean’s prostate, laughs at the yelp it draws from him. Then he withdraws, leaves Dean empty and relaxes his grip in his hair.
“Dude, you got into this problem by hunting on your own. Please tell me you’ve got some kind of backup planned?”
“Hmph.” Cas comes up behind Charlie, whispers in her ear and gestures to her to change the placement of her hands, very careful not to touch her. There’s a little more give, but still not enough.
“That was a lot of fun.” Lucifer says, once they’re out of earshot. He’s opting to walk as opposed to just popping off, just in case beady eyed Winchester senior is looking longingly out of the window as they go, or something.
He lies to himself almost flawlessly. Unfortunately, there’s no-one who has more experience unpicking Dean’s lies than himself.
What is there to say? He’s fucked this up, fucked it up so royally that Cas is going to go. Dean’s driven him away and now he’s juiced up he’s gonna go back to heaven and probably rule it at Hannah’s side like he was supposed to, like he would have if Dean hadn’t dragged him away.
“No, he’s wasted but he seems more a danger to himself than anyone else. He didn’t get aggressive when I cut him off. Just seemed sad.”
. And supernatural or psychological, I don’t think we should rule anything out until we can fix this problem.”
“Because I’m your friend. Because I care about you. Because before you’re Dean’s partner, you’re my brother in all but blood. Because I give a shit about you, and one cruel remark – fuck it, Cas, a thousand cruel remarks, even if you weren’t going through withdrawal where the only thing you hate more than yourself, is every fucker around you – won’t stop that.”
“Yeah.” She sighs again, drags herself to her feet and waits for Sam to follow. “I can’t believe you hauled your ass all the way here just for breakfast with me.”
Sam looks stunned. Not talking about his problems is a standard Dean move, but when times are bad he surrounds himself with family. Closes the ranks in on his little group and clings tight. This is out of character. This is fucking worrying.
He can feel something wet on his shoulder – drool, he thinks – and gross and annoying as it might be that he can’t stop focussing on it, he tells himself it’s a good thing, that it means something important. It means Dean was there long enough to dribble on him, that he didn’t wake up and lash out at the first sign of contact. It’s progress, even if he did have to escape the moment he woke up.
“I don’t want to burden you with every single immaterial twitch and twinge, even though I know you’re kind enough to let me.” Cas says, to forestall whatever is coming.
“Fun as it sounds to go to terrorise some high fashion employees with you three sartorial disgraces—” there’s a chorus of mocking jeers at his use of such a fancy term, “—in tow, I think we’ll be sticking to thrift stores for now.”
He looks like shit, but, then, he has for a while. She can’t tell for certain whether today’s eye-bags are more pronounced than last week’s, whether his lips are more chewed, or nails bitten shorter.
He’s hit by a sudden, staggering wave of tiredness. His limbs are full of sand and his eyes won’t stay open. He bites at the insides of his cheeks, digs his nails into his palm and stumbles to his feet. He can’t fucking pass out here, next to a pile of corpses. Who knows what it’s gonna attract.
They’re the least, of all the things Cahor did to him, and yet he understands why Sam was trying to hide them from him.
Cas pulls him gently upright, takes his hands, hale and whole, and lifts them up, so they’re touching Dean’s face.
“Hmm. Well according to their records they’d only cleared this bit of trees, not built a sigil-wall, so your guess is as good as mine. I’d wager not though, the last entry wasn’t long before Abaddon came a-knocking.”
His hand drops to his cock as Cas kicks out of his jeans and Dean groans, it’s too much, it’s too much and he can’t take it.  He allows himself one, quick stroke and then his hand flicks back up to his chest, nails digging in harder now, almost painfully. He can see the outline of Cas’s cock though his boxers and he wants it, he needs it. He wants to taste it, he hasn’t had the chance in so long and he misses it like a goddamn ache. The weight and the feel, the knowledge that the tremors of bliss wracking through Cas’s body are all his, the answering arousal roiling in his gut, demanding he satisfy Cas, demanding he swallow him down as he finally fucking comes.
“You said a few hundred years, Cas.” Charlie says, curious. “Which means this ‘blip’ hasn’t been around for all that long.”
“I talked to Cas last night.” He mutters, sniffs at his cold coffee and decides no, that’s not gonna cut it. “Anyone want coffee?”
talk to me, you get that, right? Because otherwise, what’s the point of having me around? I’m supposed to make things better for you, not force you to stuff all your trauma away and pretend it didn’t fucking happen.”
“There’s nothing I can do about her right now. Unless you’d rather I sat in a dark corner with your thumb up your ass until everything’s ready?”
“It’s a shame we can’t take him to an actual doctor, get him a proper, proscribed course or anything.”
It looks just enough the same to be jarringly different – a mosaic of Bobby and Dean’s best sigil work, warnings and barriers and protections and beseechings for help in a hundred different languages, both alive and dead.
Lucifer is going to have to keep an eye on him, especially now, just as things are about to get good.
Instead he finds Sam, brooding at the kitchen table, staring into a coffee like it’s all he has in the world.
He’s antsy and restless, and the urge to find a bottle of Jack or two or three is buzzing under his skin. Fuck or fight or drink. Those are his coping mechanisms, and since drinking and fucking are out of the question, that leaves fighting.
His begging is rewarded with a sloppy tongue and the brush of stubble against his ass as Cas leans forward, licks over his rim, teasing and gentle at first, and then getting firmer and more desperate until Cas finally, fucking finally, points his tongue and pushes it inside. Dean groans with almost relief, rolls his hips back, trying to force Cas’s tongue in deeper, chasing barely there sparks of pleasure.
Maybe, just maybe, she’s planning on letting him get away with this one, let him get to heaven unencumbered. After all, she wants Cas alive more than she wants him locked back up in Sam’s makeshift prison for
He makes it out the door unnoticed and his nerve holds for a handful of paces before he starts to run. He throws himself into the nearest dark alley and collapses against the wall.
“Nah, I bet you’d still do better even if you were starting out too.” He’s going for supportive, rather than bitter there. Not sure it lands that way, though, ‘cause Cas looks at him with something kicking at the boundaries of disappointment. This was supposed to be fun and now he’s ruining it by being a little bitch. “Uh, show me one more time.” He asks, but Cas shakes his head.
Dean stalls, doesn’t know how to react. He’s stuck in a sort of feedback loop; I’ve fucked up so I need to be punished for it in some way, by myself or the universe – but doing that hurts Cas, which is what I fucked up by doing in the first place.
“Jesus.” Dean mutters, as he comes back to the bed to examine the damage, but it’s with more disbelief than malice. “How bad are you usually hurting if that barely registers?” He jokes, not realising he’s so close to stumbling on the truth.
“Okay, Fire Marshall Bill, How about we save the big one for last. Charlie’s got a kickass display planned.”
Cas sighs, there’s no way he can sidestep the truth without hurting Dean’s feelings, is just gonna have to go ahead and spit it out.
Cas asks him if he wants to try and stay up again tonight. Dean colours slightly and tells him no. The image of Cas carrying him to his bed, laying down a towel and then watching over him while he slept unnerves him. Plucks at something uncomfortable and at the same time violently desired. Cas must sense this, because he doesn’t come into Dean’s room. He sits on a chair outside, like a sentry. It makes Dean feel like Don Corleone, lying in his hospital bed, just waiting for something bad to happen.
He does, staring appreciatively for so long that Cas rolls his eyes, plunges his hand down inside Dean’s jeans and grabs his cock, slightly too tight, through his boxers.
Sam stumbles up to his feet and looks through the clothes in his duffle. What the fuck do you wear to a barbeque?
Lucifer asks, but he doesn’t get a response. Doesn’t expect one either as, to a serenade of sizzling fat, he intones a few words of a spell from the book of the damned, and whispers the last words Dean will ever hear in Castiel’s voice.
Cas scours the tree from root to tip, lays waste to the visible signs of purgatory’s grip on Dean. But it’s not that simple, of course it isn’t. The branching tree is just a symptom, an outside visual of the inner malaise.
It’s a fucking relief to get through the bunker’s door and deposit Cas, fast asleep because apparently that’s something he’s capable of doing while riding on Dean’s back, on the bed.
Cas screams, an animal noise of rage and hate and fear. He fires wildly at the trees, past the point where the gun starts clicking, empty, howling until his breath leaves him and Dean’s gentle touch is separating his fingers from the weapon.
The angel who rebelled, fell again and again for disobedience, who caught the Righteous Man and forbade him from giving up.
“Look, I didn’t mean it like that, I don’t wanna die. Of course not – but I’m not letting you risk your safety just because there’s a chance you
He doesn’t measure out the amount, doesn’t care enough to listen to the muffled knowledge that he’ll be less tolerant than he was. If it’s too much it’s too much. That won’t be his problem.
“And? God’s intervened for Cas enough times already. He should’ve been dead a thousand times over. Something has kept him going.”
He’s headed for the mother of all fucking freakouts, and he’s vaguely aware of it. The looming storm on the horizon that you see coming, but that still somehow takes you by surprise when the first boom of thunder rings out.
“I was doing what I knew you’d want me to do – take all precautions short of not doing anything at all.”
Charlie gets Dean back to the motel room – a different room in a different motel, because no-one takes smashed windows well – with no small difficulty. He doesn’t resist her, but he doesn’t help her either. He’s just there. His head is somewhere else entirely, somewhere full of hurt and blame and recrimination and screaming, lots of screaming. Screaming so loud that it drowns out almost everything. Not enough, not the big thing, but at least something.
Sam looks at Dean in curiously. He hadn’t expected him to agree so readily – hadn’t expected him to agree at all.
Dean laughs as Cas snatches the thing back in his left hand and starts rolling it back and forth between his thumb and fingers. He hadn’t taken to it immediately – leaving it on the nightstand most days while his cuts healed – but after that he’d picked it up and barely put it down. Dean’d almost call it surgically attached, but, well. Cas’s jittery co-ordination and tendency to accidentally feck the thing across the room at any given moment would prove that painfully wrong.
That raises Cas’s hackles. He fixes Dean in his best glare, starts to say something. Dean gags him with his tongue, chases the little moans and whimpers out of him. And then he stops, gets up off the bed and rummages in his bag.
He turns as if to leave, confident that Dean will call out, try and stop him. He doesn’t, he grabs Lucifer by the arm, and Lucifer can’t help the flash of rage slipping out from his implacable Cas mask. How dare this unclean, filthy abomination touch him? He gets himself back under control quickly, though. Hopes that Dean doesn’t see the anger, or if he does, doesn’t realise the real cause for it.
Dean smiles, entwines their hands in a heady rush that sends goose bumps prickling down his arms and a shiver throughout his entire body.
“What’s the white light?” Sam asks, in a whispered undertone. It’s familiar, so, so familiar, but he can’t place it.
“Relax, I haven’t taken you here to murder you. Then I’d never find out what your cunning plan was.”
His eyes glow white and the same symbol appears on the phone as was on Cas’s. It takes Dean a moment to recognise it, and then he’s lunging forward. Only to be stopped, as the angel speaks in his true voice.
Dean has always been better at finding comfort through touch than he is through words. He won’t let Sam actively touch him, would shy away if he even thought Sam had noticed, but this he allows himself to accept.
The itching in his veins is burning now, scraping along every nerve and cell, scouring him, heating him up and up and up. He has to win this fight or it’s going to consume him, set him alight and burn him up, mind and body and soul and whatever else is left.
“Nah.” Dean dismisses easily. “You stay here and keep these two out of trouble. You’re carrying the game, dude. I couldn’t take away the best player.”
“Hey, there’s a thought. What about getting Cas a service dog. You can get them for all kinds of stuff, it’s not just guide dogs. They’re supposed to be really good for PTSD.”
He doesn’t trust him on sight, but that’s just Dean. He stops walking and looks over at Cas to gauge if he’s wigging out about this complete and utter stranger. The dude’s one of Charlie’s loons, she can deal with him while they keep a nice distance. Not that Cas looks too bothered, seems to be too busy trying to work out why the fuck they’re here.
“You want to make a crane? You know a crane is bird, don’t you? They don’t mean a construction one.”
“You were trying to banish Castiel? Free him from me? Neat. But, unfortunately, I’ve taken steps to make sure he’s never getting loose. Tough luck.”
“I know.” Cas replies, which is unexpected. He forgets that Cas knows people now. Understands far more of the joke and nuance of human relation than he ever used to.
“Shouldn’t you be saving that juice for yourself?” Dean asks, tone entirely too sharp. He doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, why he can’t just say goddamn thanks like a normal person. He has to lash out.
“Me too, oh god, man. Me fucking too.” Dean grunts out, eyes squeezed closed, expression close to bliss on his face. He can feel his balls drawing tight, heat building in his stomach.
Sam rolls his eyes. Like yeah, Cas, that was the point I meant you to take away from that. Well done.
“No, I don’t think we can risk that.” Charlie says. “He’s just had a pretty big freakout, that’s the kind of thing that only gets worse if you leave it to fester.”
He reaches Dean’s mid-thigh and pauses there. He spends a long time, far too long, on each spot, worrying at it with his teeth and then soothing it, kissing it and caressing it with his tongue.
Cas claws back the gap as Dean starts to get a bit more cocky and showy. With every shot he lets out a whooping cheer, whether it lands anywhere near Cas’s or not. After two misses in a row he gives Cas a sideways glance.
Dean doesn’t struggle. He lets Sam drag him down the corridor, throw him bodily into one of the empty rooms. He hasn’t seen Sam this angry in a long time, and he gets exactly fucking why, but all the energy he briefly managed to tap into is gone now, and he doesn’t even have the strength to feel ashamed of himself. He just wants to go back to fucking bed and not wake up until he doesn’t care anymore.
Charlie takes a while to stir. She’s not good at early rising – her stint at Roman Enterprises had been her longest stable 9-5 job. And neither is she a born hunter. She’s a civilian convert, not used to four hours sleep and ass crack of dawn risings.
Lucifer summons six demons. Two go into the corpses of the murdered couple, for convenience and because he knows how uncomfortable it’ll make dear Castiel. The others take possession of the neighbours. He snuffs Castiel out for a moment – all the better to surprise him with later – and takes one of the demons aside, explains to it what is going to happen and exactly what it needs to do. It’s more than happy to oblige, still a little star struck at being in the presence of the literal devil. That’s good, Lucifer can work with that.
Dean freezes for a moment, a delicious picture of fucked out confusion, sweat and come drying on his skin.
There’s a little voice in the back of his head sniping about slippery slopes. He hates the little fucking voice.
He opens the door, slips in. But Cas isn’t there. The bed is freshly made, empty. He flips on the light, looks around. It’s the right room – there are Dean’s photos, his vinyl all lined up across the wall – but the bed is empty, and there’s something else off about it, too.
“I performed an undocumented, unpredictable spell in your home. I should have done it elsewhere. Anything could have happened. You have a right to be upset.”
There’s an awful lot of everyone, starting to pile up on Dean’s list. Vessels, possessed bastards, the just plain unlucky. He’s killed a hell of a fucking lot of innocents for the greater good.
No-one comes for the first few hours, but Cas knows better than to think that means he’s safe. Naomi has her ways. She can wipe him clean and start again. She can do whatever she wants. Maybe she’s been here already, fiddling with his wiring, scooping out bits of his brain and pouring them down the gutter.
“No. It’s an offer.” The demon cocks its head and it throws Dean for a second, but he ploughs on. “I have a contract here – written by the king of hell, so you know it’s favourable to the demon who signs it. Terms already laid out and agreed. All you need to do is authorise.”
Claire wanders aimlessly around the bunker for a bit. Okay, not so aimlessly. She’s looking for the one person who wanted to be here even less than she did. The guy who was so fucking in love with Cas, that he couldn’t be fucked to come to his funeral.
Lucifer pulls Dean down on top of him, bites him hard enough to leave a mark – a punishment for impudence that he knows Dean will interpret as a sexual act meant for his pleasure.
“No one’s fucking spiked me with heroin before.” Dean snaps back, realising too late what he’s just implicitly revealed.
“Of course it won’t be easy. Ideally we’d have the book of the damned, but, failing that, there must be ways.”
He carves out another, and then another. He can barely see what he’s doing now, through the blood and the fucking tears that he can’t seem to hold back.
Cas looks Dean directly in the eye as he returns his foot to its previous resting place. Dean gulps, barely visibly, but it’s there. Dean knows that Cas isn’t actually going to crush his junk – he likes it far too much to go and ruin it. But that doesn’t mean he can help the tiny spark of trepidation for little Dean at that terrifying look on Cas’s face right now.
And because this is Sam Winchester, because the first thing he learned from his big brother was how to put other people first, he does.
And just like that, he walks out of the room. Charlie takes a moment to follow him. She has no idea if this counts as a victory or not, she’s too busy reeling from the emotional whiplash.
Dean works his free hand into Cas’s hair, massages his scalp with just a little bit of sharp fingernail, pushes Cas over the edge with a filthy kiss. He comes all over his shorts and Dean’s hand. Dean licks it clean, causing Cas to groan in appreciation.
“Hey, man. I’m just looking after you. Drugged and married to a stalker, that’s gotta leave some bad feeling.”
Charlie’s circle is finished; all they have to do now is wait and see if any more angels turn up. And also hope that no park rangers make a showing. Um, yes, hello, we aren’t defacing parkland at all, nope, as you were, thanks guys. And don’t worry about these pacing weirdos. Nothing to see here. Promise.
It doesn’t matter, though, no-ones paying enough attention to notice him anyway. He draws near to the living room, can see Sam with his back to the door and Dean pacing back and forth – his hands split and bloody, flecks of it on his face and jacket.
Dean grimaces, regretting his words. He doesn’t try and salve with a joke like he usually might, just twines his fingers in with Cas’s instead.
“No reason.” Sam says nervously, clearly not wanting to remind Cas that he’s helpless and pathetic and all the rest. “I’ll make sure he gets back safe.”
“But nothing. I don’t want to go. I won’t stay and make your life a fucking misery, though, so don’t lie to me out of pity.”
There’s a different pit in Cas’s stomach now. He remembers his physical weakness, he forgets his physical appearance. Shame curls around his bones, but the nervousness is still there, coiled and waiting to stoke itself into panic again.
Claire Novak half watches from a distance, swearing under her breath and cursing the day Dean was ever born. All her problems trace back to him, in a roundabout sort of way. The same way you could say all Dean’s problems trace back to Cain and Abel. Or his mother’s deal, all those years ago.
Sam stops himself from shooting a significant look at Dean. The more he hears about this, the more he thinks his Cas gone rogue theory has potential. A group of angels massing and gathering on earth for mysterious and probably malicious reasons. Sounds exactly like the sort of trouble he’d throw himself into headfirst.
Cas knows from the look on Charlie’s face – and the fact that he knows her even slightly as a person – that he isn’t going to get away with this. He makes a go anyway, though.
As it is, though, it’s much more fun to use affection to hurt Castiel than it is cruelty. He probably suffers more when he’s forced to be a party to Lucifer’s kindness to Dean than he would if Lucifer whipped out a knife and started slicing him up.
Lunch doesn’t go exactly as Sam planned. Not that he’d been planning an ambush, but, well, okay. That was exactly what he’d planned. Except every time he opens his mouth to try and ask Dean something, or suggest something they could do to help him, Cas goes and fucking kicks him in the shins.
Her palms flash blue and the woman’s injuries fade, gradually disappear. Then the angel lays a hand on her forehead. “Time to forget.”
And Charlie doesn’t lunge, remembering the terrified humans trapped in those bodies. She has a better idea. She gouges her angel blade into the ground, starts to create a perfect replica of the sigil she’s seen Dean carve so many times.
Sick of being ignored, Claire gets changed in the bathroom, turns off the light and plunges Dean into darkness on her way back.
She comes back with a readymade Hannah summoning kit. Something Dean had put together, and then conveniently forgotten about. It consists of a bowl, a match, and a wooden board painted with sigils. He’d talked about refining it, something smaller and more portable, but his impetus had left before he could do anything more than just talk about it.
It cracks a smile out of Dean. “I know I ain’t had the best record that way, fuck, none of us have. I’m tryna fix that at my end, Sammy. So go on, have your adventure, just make sure you keep in touch – regular updates, and for the love of god check your salt lines.”
It grasps his arm back, and Cas sends a twist of grace outwards, coiling around their arms and binding them together. He lets go when he’s done, wipes his hand on his trousers. On Sirael's flesh there’s a thin, white tattoo-like mark.
They don’t go any further than that, even though Cas could. The air between them is rich with tension, and Cas can feel nervous excitement building, threatening to overflow and spur him to action. They could re-enact their first date in full, fuck in the wilderness where no-one can see them, come on the cliffside and drive back home, loose and sated.
Dean’s movement spurs the other angels to action and he’s within seconds of being run through – only saved by Hannah’s furious intervention. She lunges to stand in front of him, eyes burning white hot with grace and an angel blade in each hand. She moves defensively, parries and blocks, doesn’t press or go on the attack. Dean scrambles to his feet and stands next to her, back to the jeep.
Physically it’d be easier to go back with the Winchesters. All he’d have to do is stay, standing here, wait for the car to roll up alongside him. Let Sam climb out of the passenger door and bundle him into the backseat, all concerned and fretting. Try not to catch Dean’s angry, judgmental gaze.
Dean wakes up with another body wrapped around his, and for a moment he forgets. He sighs contentedly, rolls over to face Cas and kiss him good morning.
“Cas. This isn’t your fault. This is probably just Dean pulling away from you. Because he thinks the universe is out to get him and he doesn’t want to take you down as well.”
Dean flinches, and Charlie smacks down the guilt at the stricken look on his face. Someone needs to remind him every now and then, when he falls back into his old, safe, bullshit patterns.
They just let her in, offer her a change of clothes and some towels. She accepts, changes quickly and cleans her face. Comes back into the main hall of the bunker with shoulders squared and teeth gritted. She takes her position at the front of the coffin, next to Sam.
“I WILL NOT LET YOU KILL ME!” Crowley doesn’t sound particularly scared, frothing with rage, perhaps. Scared, not so much.
“And there I was thinking I was just being a shitty boyfriend.” The words spew out without his permission. They seem to be doing that a lot, recently.
He’s been rehearsing this in his head ever since he agreed to come to an NA meeting. He can’t be completely honest, of course, but if he just makes something up then there isn’t really much point in coming here. He talked it over with Charlie and Sam and they decided to just go for the truth, just with the names and species removed.
Cas knows they need to talk about this, address it and deal with it, but he can’t. He fucking can’t. He pulls his shirt back on and lies down, facing away from Dean.
He can make this go away so easily, all he has to do is give in. Just give in, Castiel. What’s the point in fighting? Just.....give.....in......
Sam gets what he’s saying. He speaks Dean pretty fucking fluently, and in this case, ‘no’ stands for
And it wouldn’t be Sam without the dramatic pause, so long that Cas wants to reach out and shake him, just yell, finish the fucking sentence! Tell me what a fuck up I am, tell me how I came crashing into your lives and tore a fucking hole punching through to the other side.
The relief in Dean’s chest is instantaneous and fierce. It’s the sweetest thing he’s felt since he pulled himself out of his own grave, took those first gulps of sulphur free air for forty years.
“Not quite.” Dean says, and his voice might be wobbly, but there’s something about it – something bold and triumphant.
His head aches ferociously and he feels weak, fuzzy. Almost as if he’s standing in a ring of holy fire. He scans the walls and floor for any sign of sigil or trap. There’s nothing, but he still feels soft, right down to the pit of him.
It’s soft, and gentle. There’s no furious passion or need behind it. It doesn’t go any further, or develop into anything more desperate. It’s just a gentle, intimate touch. And yet, and yet Cas’s heart is beating so fast he’s amazed it doesn’t burst out of his chest. He can feel every nerve ending twitching and burning but for once he doesn’t mind, for once he welcomes it. He feels alive. He feels so goddamn alive.
This isn’t Dean saying so long and fuck you very much. This is Dean thinking he’s putting someone else’s feelings before his own and jumping ship. This is Dean holding a gun to his own head and squeezing the trigger to make someone else happy.
“Yessir. Sorry sir.” Dean’s excited, and he can’t help that it’s spilling over into being a cheeky, borderline-annoying little git.
“Doesn’t mean anything, necessarily. Sam runs anyway, it’s possible that he’s running more now as a response to trauma. Sam was in the cage with Lucifer for longer than we were, maybe Lucifer did something, something that brought out old memories, is making Sam want to forget.”
“If I’m just following a recipe do I really need you to show me? You might as well just sit down and leave me to it.”
“And what’re we supposed to do while you’re gone? Just sit here?!” Sam’s tone is sharp and incredulous.
“It’s too early for emotions, geddoff me.” Dean says as Sam lets him go, grinning like a giddy child.
The adrenaline leaves as quickly as it came, and now his head is throbbing. No better or worse than he deserves.
Dean reaches up to touch Cas, realises he’s still almost entirely clothed and makes a noise of displeasure. He quickly works to fix that. Gross and frumpy and form hiding it might be, but there is one advantage to Cas’s uniform of shirt and jacket. You don’t need to stop kissing to get it off him. Dean pops the buttons nice and slow, stopping in between each one to caress the patch of skin it reveals. He loves the feel of Cas’s firm muscle under his hands, coiled mortal strength barely hinting at the real supernatural might hidden beneath it.
“Yeah, and I imagine hiding them is making you re-open them more than you would otherwise, isn’t it?”
Updates should be pretty regular, but you could probably bribe me to make them more regular with comments and kudos wink wink nudge nudge hahahahaha ;)
Any thoughts he had of not coming back for the second session are banished as he screeches to a braking halt at the end of the track.
They settle down and Dean badgers Cas relentlessly to tell him what he’s ordered. Cas keeps his silence, even when Dean threatens to tickle him until he screams.
Sam shrugs, wondering if Dean has emotional whiplash from his sudden flip from cloying overbearing parent to
“You weren’t listening, Crowley.” Cas says. “I said purgatory was going to tear Dean apart, I also said it wasn’t going to kill him.”
Sam vaguely hopes he’s about to get his restraints cut, but somehow he knows that isn’t going to happen.
Once the demons are dead Lucifer lays them out, tries to make it look like there was some kind of fight instead of just an easy, brutal slaughter.
Cahor usually submits to the inspection with minimal resistance, but Dean’s not stupid enough to let his guard down. He flips the cuffs over and checks to make sure the sigils are still intact, that they’re still tight around Cahor’s wrists.
He coughs before they can get any more 18-rated and Dean turns to him, huge fucking grin on his face.
Dean rolls his eyes, but allows himself to be hectored and dragged to the living room. Sam’s set it up all nice and cosy – lights off, blankets on the sofas.
“We won’t fucking know if it breaks, Dean. That’s the point. We’ll be dead – for good this time. Life and death might have been revolving doors for us so far, that won’t continue forever.”
Sam has a bowl of ingredients and a lighter to use if he thinks things get nasty. A herbal knife to sever the cord that winds Dean and Cas together. A knife which he was instructed only to use in the direst of circumstances, because they don’t know what the consequences of ripping two minds apart like that might be. You’re supposed to let them unwind in their own time. You cut them down the middle, and maybe everything is fine, but maybe instead the edges start to fray and both minds disintegrate.
“You don’t have a good track record with stew.” Cas notes and Dean makes a big show of being mock annoyed, letting go of Cas and throwing his hands up in the air.
“Earth to Sam?” Dean waves a hand in front of his face, and he twitches back to the room, blurts out the first thing that comes into his dumb head.
“Like limbs and shit? Gross. Cas, your idea of a romantic stroll needs some serious work, I am telling you.”
Sam’s elbows are on the table, hands fisted in his hair. He can’t make eye-contact with Jody, staring at his glass with red rimmed eyes, instead.
“I don’t know.” He snaps, ashamed at the look in her eye, and then he softens his tone, mutters at the floor, “I don’t know.”
Parrots he can kinda see – pirates and all that. He’s not sure what sloths are doing in an aquarium, but whatevs. They look pretty happy, and pretty green. Algae, growing in their coats because they move so slowly, Dean learns. Excellent. There’s a new nickname for Cas when he’s being all dopey and slow in the morning.
He doesn’t want to die blindfolded in a car. It just seems like a bit of a let down for that to be the thing that broke his, admittedly miraculously tenacious, grip on this mortal coil.
Cas can’t see the vine, but he can feel it at his throat, pressing gently against. He swallows, feels his Adams apple push against something slightly sharp.
Cas leaps and bounds through the trees with apparent reckless disregard for his own health, but it only seems that way. He’s not stupid. He knows he’s only here because purgatory wants something from him. It wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of giving him a body if it didn’t.
He fishes his own phone out of his pocket, pulls up the name. His finger hovers over the call symbol for a long, long minute as he tries to muster up the courage. He has to now, or he won’t, and this isn’t fair on him, but it’s only a little unfair on him. Not telling her, that’d be a whole lot worse.
And, speaking of getting lucky, the room positioning is perfect. The two bedrooms are as far apart from each other as can be, at opposite ends of the suite, with a living room in between. Hopefully far enough away not to have to hear a single thing. And if not, well, he brought his headphones.
