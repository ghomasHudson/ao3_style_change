as he scratches, tugs, and kneads.
Cas tilts his head to see Dean’s face. He’s blushing. For a guy who’s so confident on the surface, he can get flustered quite easily. Cas takes advantage of this as he takes the cup from Dean’s hands and places it on the end table, then drags him into a prone position and straddles him. “Tell me,” he rumbles. “I want to know.”
“His son. Named after you.”
Castiel nodded, the moment gone (if it was ever there to begin with).
It took Dean a couple of weeks to adapt to his newfound fame as “Edgewood Academy’s Favorite Director Dad!” (Charlie’s title), but Cas was there every step of the way. Dean told Cas he needed to talk to him nightly to keep his panic in check, and Cas retorted that he’d call him nightly to keep his
gonna tell me what else you’ve done?”
“I don’t think so,” Hann offered. “You’ll never know if you don’t take a chance.”
“I love you.”
“No shit, eh? Should've ditched Miller when they had a chance.”
Dean snickers and pushes his cold nose to Cas’ cheek, kissing his jaw. “Nope.”
Castiel trots to the door, opening it before she even has a chance to knock. “Zoe.”
They make it to the door and, with a deep breath, Cas steps outside, Dean following behind him to make sure he doesn’t actually fall on his face. He takes a couple more breaths, then calls the kids over. His demeanor changes immediately as he puts on a smile for them. Dean’s always impressed with Cas’ ability to keep his own shit under wraps. Dean himself doesn’t even realize there’s something up with him half the time, so he knows the recent work stuff and extra hours must’ve really been getting to Cas for him to notice. Dean watches as they disappear into the shed for a few minutes, returning with two wrapped gifts. Everyone gathers around them when Claire calls out, “It’s time for gifts!”
“Mmmhmm.”
Dean snorts with amusement at their old game of who can come up with the best euphemism. “A randy rag. That was quite a reach, Cas.”
He clears his throat as his brain veers back on track. “I know, I know,” Castiel responds, trying to keep his own demeanor light even as the butterflies in his belly kick up a vigorous clog dance. “I was cleaning.”
“But you won’t really get off, though.”
“Cas warned me about you. So we talked, Vaughn. Me and some of our other friends. You know, like Zack? And some of the girls? Even Isaiah had a few things to say.”
Dean was still not home.
The epithet hurt a little, but it wasn’t as if he’d never heard it before.
“Shut up,” Dean laughs, shoving him. Snarky love of his life.
“I would think my moves would be the antidote to that.”
to be concerned about one small-minded man. Dean’s brain must catch up, because when he turns to face Castiel, he’s rubbing his mouth as if he’s afraid he said something wrong. Castiel beams a bright, happy smile his way, telling him he most certainly did not say something wrong, and Dean’s hand drops, returning the smile just as brightly. “That was okay to say? About Matt?” he asks.
“Oh.”
“Do I have to do them in that order? Eat, shower, shit?”
Castiel nearly forgot he has dinner plans with Jack tonight. Jack wanted a home-cooked meal, so he’s cooking and having family over. “Come over for dinner tonight, then? Jack wanted spaghetti and meatballs for his birthday.”
“Not gonna go get your note?” Sam asks. Dean can tell he’s trying to keep it light (and failing miserably).
Castiel watches him, observes the way his lids flutter, his breathing stutters, his hands clench the sheets. He smiles and takes out the large plug they played with earlier, when Castiel let him look and touch but didn’t let him get either of them off. He’s loose and ready. He straddles Dean and, in one long, steady push, envelops Dean’s cock.
“Let’s go get your things, and quickly. I don’t want any other alphas smelling you.”
“All of it. Having your weirdos here at the same time as my friends, bringing all these strangers around for your...
It’s even better.
“You’re a fuckin’ lifesaver, sweetheart,” Dean moans as he shuffles to the counter.
Dean freezes. “Uh…”
Cas channels his inner Dean and swings the door open wide.
Jack dutifully brings it over.
to be angry, but Dean keeps giving him reasons not to, and it’s disconcerting. He does have a good excuse, though. “It’s—um, I can’t. Charlie has to approve you. Foster care thing.”
“Enjoy your smut. I’m going to my room, too.”
“Hello, Cas.” She smiles and turns the tablet to face him. His parents and Dean’s parents are on the screen, in video boxes. They wave. He waves back.
Dean started, torn from his rapt attention on the rescue effort—what he could see of it, anyway. “Yeah?”
“And then we talked about friends and circles and game nights and the sunroom...God, the sunroom. When you said it was mine and not ours, I just...right then, I knew I wanted it to be ours, for the house to be ours. And yeah, I could’ve just asked you to move in, but I thought about that asshole at the paint store—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But I am far beneath you in social standing—”
“You do. I left you coffee on your nightstand. Don’t knock it over or you’ll fry your phone.”
Dean pulls him into a kiss. “Hmm. Well, you are my favorite author.”
“I dunno. If boredom is based on numbers, then they must be. But if it’s not, then not necessarily.”
Late that night, Dean collects the t-shirts from the dryer. He folds each one until they’re in a neat pile, then sighs. He knows he’s being a giant douchebag about things. It’s not Castiel’s fault that he’s messed up. He just can’t help but be royally pissed that his body is betraying him. Again.
“Um...I mean, yeah. He was just kind of...intense.”
personal” with a quiet voice and a soft expression.
“Hi, Cas. I’m Dean. Your dog brought me here.”
He sits up. “Damn. She played me. They played me!”
Cas gripped the sleeve of Dean’s jacket. “My sacrifice...it saved you. It saved the world. I’m sorry if my declaration hurt you—”
“Nothing.”
Cas retires to his room with his own tea and a book, but can focus on neither. He goes to bed, hoping the world will make sense in the morning.
“Yeah.”
He slowly pops the buttons of his red shirt open and slides it off, eyes locked on Dean’s. The t-shirt follows, peeled off one-handed after he tosses his hat at Dean’s feet. He kicks it out of the way as he approaches. Hungry with anticipation, Dean can’t help but taste him when Cas straddles him and slowly lowers himself into his lap, pressing Dean’s face against his torso.
“Do not!”
There are so many things he could work on. He could wrap up his current WIP, an AU about Ryder and Killian fighting over a car. He could work on his story for the Bang he’s in, another AU about Killian as a caregiver, his wheelchair-bound uncle, and Ryder, his uncle’s nurse. He could play with the twenty stories he’s started and never finished, or he could attack the folder labeled “Story Ideas.” He could be so productive.
“No. Only since Thanksgiving night, when you told everyone your username. I put the pieces together and…” Cas shrugs, anxiously meeting Dean’s eyes. “Like I said in the story, I just wanted to make my love confession memorable to you.”
“You’d better,” he mutters in a growl-purr born of relaxation and arousal.
“The year will fly by, you’ll see. Soon we’ll be putting up another tree and we’ll be decorating all over again. We’ll do it together this time.”
“Hey Cas?”
Recorded?
“And you wouldn’t ask because you didn’t want him to feel obligated. Boy, you two are a match made in heaven,” Gabriel squawks.
Dean’s eyes shine in that way they always do when he’s particularly pleased. “It’s your weekend off, so whatever you want.”
“You bit me.”
His eyebrows climbed up his forehead as he considered the (very positive, very hot) possibilities. And then… “Wait, we could’ve done that before we left?”
“For sure. That sucks. And it sucks that you have to be the one to tell him. I’m sorry, man. You must be stressed out.”
Dean shifted his gaze to the gloomy horizon. “You didn’t come see me. After Jack sprang you. Why not?”
“Want me to get my head shrunk?” Dean smirked affectionately.
“Oh God, are you another one of Cas’ friends?”
He dips his toes in, rumbling, “Come on, babe.”
“I didn’t give you details...yet!” Dean shouts as he makes his way to the bathroom.
The man’s face was revealed.
“Do you want me to sleep in the spare bedroom tonight, since I have to be up so early for my trip?” Cas—or his husband Cal, rather—asks softly against his hair. Since it didn’t make sense for Cal to go on a vacation/family reunion without Dan, they agreed that Cal is going on a business trip instead.
“No. No, it’s just...crap that I used to believe. It’s not true.”
Dean looks at the photo again. “Wasn’t obvious enough? Cas, what the hell am I supposed to be—oh shit!”
Castiel reminded himself.
Charlie screeches, drawing everyone’s attention to their table (which is pretty impressive considering how loud the bar is). Cas laughs so hard that Zepp perks up and peers at him with a tilt of his head.
“Please, just hear me out. I’ve been wanting to talk to you for days now,” Dean begs a snarling Gabriel Novak while Sam watches warily. The guy is
“Thought you didn’t want one?” he mocks him, already adding it to the counter. He forks over more cash as Castiel hides a smile behind a cough into his arm.
Cas gasps, inhaling sharply, like he’s caught Dean’s scent. “Omega,” he cries softly, only loud enough for Dean. “My omega.”
At first, Dean was displeased with her choice for him (“I’m not a cute, fuzzy bunny”) and tried to talk her out of it. When he couldn’t get anywhere with her, Cas tried, telling her that foxes and rabbits shouldn’t be together because “foxes love to eat rabbits, and I might eat him out,” which sent Dean into paroxysms of laughter, particularly given what they’d been up to that morning before Bea woke up. “I meant up,
Cas smiled softly. “You have free will, Dean.”
Soooo...Cas seems to be warming up to Dean, no?
He’s “sick” for the rest of the school week and into the weekend. He doesn’t answer Cas’ messages, and by Sunday, they stop.
“Come on! They’re finally gonna have sex, right?”
Shifting, Cas says, “Sorry. My, uh...yeah. Ouch, man.” He lightly pats at the spot on his neck. “Is it a good one?”
They’re facing each other just steps from the bed that has plenty of room for both of them. But Dean can’t possibly be suggesting anything that Castiel might hope he is. Speechless for a moment, he finally manages, “Wh—uh, where, uh, where would you...I mean, I can’t take your room—”
“Can I make jokes about getting nailed?”
“Dean.”
“I think we could have an epic game of Twister, you guys!” Reagan shouts.
The train car seems a whole lot warmer all of a sudden. “Oh. Right. Um—”
Their light-hearted exclamations serve to break the tension as everyone dissolves into laughter.
“Um, those are, um, daring and, uh, interesting.”
, Dean thinks.
There’s nothing after this page, so he flips to the beginning. Forests. Dragonflies. Lightning storms, landscapes, various shapes. Anime characters. Pages of cartoon panels. Dean’s house. Dean’s
Watching the way Cas bites his lip as the moaning hits his ears makes Dean’s arousal spike, too. He unzips his shorts and begins stroking himself to full firmness.
“Yeah,” he answers softly.
Cas steps into his space but doesn’t touch him. Instead, he walks around him like he’s examining a Michelangelo. “Beautiful,” he murmurs.
“Sure do.”
“Oh yeah. With overtime, maybe. Slide that box over, would ya?” Cas did, and Dean smiled as he unwrapped the pie square that everyone knew was his. “You and Scrabs good? Gonna ride it out with some movies and popcorn?”
Want to check out where Dean and Cas spent their time?
But the best trick is yet to come.
Good luck to everyone watching the finale! I’ll be with you in spirit, holding your hand and squealing. 😂
Cas smiled at him so softly at that, Dean could’ve forgotten all about touching him. Well, maybe not. He really wanted to touch him. So they mirrored each other, and it was slow, gentle, and relaxing, easing them from shy touches into fun grabs into heated strokes.
And the next.
“Could you help me? I’ve never had a partner who’s taller, and I need help visualizing this.”
And of course, Cas could go with them…“Yeah, I guess. You wanna go, Cas?”
“Yeah. Don’t feel much like a boss, though.”
Their friend Charlie, another high school drama club alumnus, brings Dean a beer.
“Hey.” Cas meets Dean’s gentle, understanding eyes. “Do you really want to or do you wanna just bag it and go get a pizza? I’m fine either way, I swear.”
“Or never,” Ana Jo sneers.
“Nope. In fact…” Dean paused, sipped his water, then finished, “I quit.”
Castiel blinked. “Three?”
Castiel smiles. He appreciates the balance Gabe and Sam give him and each other. “Thank you both for doing this.”
before.”
“Oh.”
“What are you doing?”
“Seriously? Why?”
makes you a parent.”
Dean shakes it away. He’s joking. But it could happen. Maybe.
Cas squints at him suspiciously. “What are you thinking?”
“I doubt it. I didn’t get that feeling, you know? It was more ‘I was concerned because I didn’t like it’ rather than ‘I was concerned because I thought something was happening to you.’”
Cas can tell that the conversation is going to draw to a close now that the question of food delivery has been quashed, and he really doesn’t want it to. “You said you make videos?”
said.”
“Mmmhmm.”
pay rent like you do, and we have the right to insist on advance notice and limits. If the police are called because of noise, that’s a consequence for all of us, not to mention that we are
“His skanky friend better not be staying the night,” Vaughn shouts over the music from his side of the room. How he even heard their conversation, Dean has no idea, though he is pretty close to the tape line separating the spaces.
to say no to you.”
“Yeah. You missed your man all sweaty.” Jess winks, then cackles at Dean’s blush. He sneers playfully at her. She knew just what she was doing when she said that, and damn her, it worked, because now he’s thinking of his husband and how good he looks all sweaty.
“Like he has the world’s worst halitosis. Or he’s a porn star. Or he’s a big bag of dicks.”
about it.
, he thinks as his attention turns to Dean.
“Go talk to him.”
“All right. Put that baby down for a minute so you can come outside. We gotta talk about some stuff out there.”
Henriksen turned toward the scene. “Try like hell to get them out of there without freezing to death.”
“Hello.”
They finish breakfast with their usual camaraderie, then take turns showering. When Dean’s finished, he’s slightly disappointed to find Cas already dressed. He’s definitely not disappointed in
“What’s this?” Jack asks around a mouthful of grilled cheese (with no pepper jelly). Dean can’t see what he’s rifling through on the floor until it’s too late. He pulls out one of Cas’ models from his peer education work.
advanced in our relationship yet.”
“It has.”
Again, Dean dropped his face into his hand, this time in fear and worry. “Okay, Cas. Just hang tight. We’re gonna get you out of there. I’m gonna hand you to Charlie and Sis for a minute, okay? They need to know what’s going on with you.”
So, the living together is going... not so well. 😂
Jack chuckles, shaking his head. “Celebrating in style?” he asks. “You’d better be taking him somewhere nice, Dean.”
“What? Baby, I got moves that bring the girls
He guided Cas to Baby and helped him in, then slid in beside him in the driver’s seat. “What d’you say to a motel tonight, huh? And then tomorrow, we can go wherever the road takes us.”
They shift until Castiel is on his back and Dean is straddling him. They discuss condoms, which Dean doesn’t want (“You didn’t use one” “It’s personal preference, not a contest, Dean”), and apply generous amounts of lube. Then, Dean perches himself over Castiel’s cock and, after several starts and stops, envelops it completely in his tight heat.
“Not bad.” Lee glances behind Cas. His brows knit together. “Your book?”
They trade the notebook back and forth for a while, taking it easy on Jack with their words until he pulls out “nougat” for one of his, and then it’s on. It’s not how Dean pictured their first fake dating night—he’d figured there’d be way more making out in front of Vaughn and maybe some more pretend sex that nonetheless gets his dick up—but this is really, really nice. Cas is in his arms, warm and snuggly and laughing at this kid across from them. The kid is cute and smart, like he pictures any kid of Cas’ would be. He can’t help but think of the two of them as dads, playing games and sneaking kisses that gross their kids out. They’re too young now, but he knows he wants it someday, and picturing it with Cas feels right. He kisses Cas’ temple, forgetting for a moment that he shouldn’t and then remembering that he should, for their act. Cas turns his baby blues on him and bumps their noses together. It’s so damn sweet and romantic that his bones ache with longing.
“I asked Eric to drop off groceries for us while we were out.”
“Good.” He returns the kiss, longer and lingering, before they part and he takes Matthew into his arms, laying smooches on his cheek.
“Yeah. Well, I guess, if they’re really good friends, they’d be patient with each other.”
The man who has been a true parent to her for as long as he’s been in her life. It makes his emotions tumble in his belly once again, as they have for weeks. Dean deserves to be named her parent—he’s the one doing the work, after all. As important as Zoe was in carrying and birthing the kids, the years that Dean has put in far exceed her contributions, in his opinion.
“And for me,” Dean adds in a whisper.
“Okay.” Cas dropped his head. “So, going back—”
Somehow, Cas seems to at least figure out from his senseless babbling that something is wrong. He stands them up quickly, jamming his hands in Dean’s armpits and practically picking him up, then rushes them toward their bedroom. They stumble through their door just as Vaughn turns on the living room light.
me with their
“Love you.” Dean rubs his head against Cas’.
Cas drives to work on autopilot, rolling the last twelve hours in his mind.
“You weren’t—”
“Trust me.”
“No, he loved it. Great editing, he said. Very creative.”
Cas smiles as Bea comes on, talking about the crafts they’re going to do, because he knows what’s coming. Seconds later, “Uptown Funk” starts, and shortly after that, there’s Dean. He taps his feet and bops his head to the song, laughing softly every time Dean comes into view. When it’s finished, he’s grinning like an idiot.
for him thing that Lee was talking about? Or maybe he got too drunk to know what he was doing. Or maybe, possibly, there’s a chance that Lee really was lying about the whole thing and Dean didn’t want to tell him about their conversation for some other reason. It’s a thought Cas tries not to have, because it gives him way too much hope.
Cas was going to leave it at that, but Dean’s been his best friend for years, so he can’t resist teasing him by adding “I’m gonna give Killian a happy ending with Ryder’s ass” when both of their mouths are filled with toothpaste. Dean spews minty foam all over the mirror and sink, and toothpaste squirts between Cas’ teeth and drools down his chin as he laughs.
to his growing to-do list of shit he can’t afford to do but has to.
“Yes, but my parents bought half of them, so I’m not sure it counts,” he jokes.
Dean chuckles and cradles Cas’ head, playing with the curls near the nape of his neck. “Dude, I don’t care, either.” He seeks out Cas’ mouth for a kiss. Cas’ lips complain, briefly, about their swollen state, but Cas tells them to piss off and kisses Dean back. They continue kissing languidly, heedless of the mess as they curl tighter into one another.
“No, just...come on.”
Cas, who is hot as hell, honestly.
Cas tucks his arm (his bare arm, because he doesn’t have a shirt on,
“Love you, babe,” Castiel returns, hugging the arms encircling him.
“Why would I care?”
Ire boils in his blood. “No,” he spits.
“Uh, yeah. You have to make out. A lot. I mean, you guys have to be totally lusting after each other’s hot bods, enough so you can’t keep your hands off each other.”
“He didn’t ask you to go with him?”
“Did you put sugar on the grocery list?” Cas asks as he turns off the light.
“I don’t need you—”
Everyone trusts each other.
“Yeah, but Hann, it’s...it’s harder.”
The Shadow’s jaw twitched.
“Night, Cas.” Dean waves at him before clicking on the button to leave the meeting. He stares at the computer, chewing on his lip, until the screen saver appears.
“Yeah,” he admits, taking Matthew gratefully. Dean matches Matthew’s bright grin. Castiel watches them, longing twisting his heart into knots. He’s much too eager to serve the next person who comes in.
have thousands of times because they earned the chance to have them and their love was the hardest-won of all.
, and this”—he wags his finger between Cas and Dean—“just no. I’m not leaving, so you can drop the act.”
Drago jumps.
“Dean Winchester. You know, the son of John Winchester and Mary Campbell?”
“Awesome.”
“Ca-Caaaas, fuck, babe.”
“I don’t know,” the unknown woman—Steph, who appears to be Cora’s mother—murmurs.
Cas gasps, turning toward Gabe. “Making it really hard? Gabriel! That’s disgusting! I’m your brother!”
“Tell Jilly no hard feelings,” Dean says.
They were supposed to be blowing off steam after a tough week—having a few laughs, a couple of drinks, and maybe a little something when they got back to his place (which is practically Cas’ now, too, since he brought half his wardrobe over a couple of months ago). But they’d only been there a few minutes when he noticed Lee. He shouldn’t have been surprised—it was Friday night and it was their usual (or what used to be their usual) place—but it still took him aback. He hasn’t seen the guy in something like four months now, since he and Cas started dating, though Benny’s mentioned him a time or two and hinted that he wanted to reconnect. Dean wasn’t ready before—he had himself to sort out, Cas to enjoy, and anger that hadn’t gone away yet—and he’s not ready to be best buds now, either. But he and Cas have talked many, many times about it, like he said, and he thinks he’s ready to hash some things out. Maybe.
“Cas—”
“Yeah, she is. Learned a lot about her tonight, actually.”
“Yeah, like that.”
“Yeah, yeah. Look at it this way, though. We’ll still have more space than we had before, and we’re used to sharing a room. We lived with other people before we roomed together, plus all the people in the dorms, and we probably won’t even see the guy and his roommate that much. Hey, maybe we’ll even be friends. That’d be cool, right? It would make a funny story. Plus Charlie and Jo live right below us. Besides, classes are starting soon and the dorms and apartments in the area are filled. I don’t wanna be separated from you.”
Jack returns and puts his backside on the doorknob.
“I wouldn’t know. Never had one.” He stands, finally facing Dean, who’s still damp and gorgeous in the lamplight.
“What’s this?” Dean sets his cleaning rag aside to accept the envelope.
“Sounds good. See you then.”
“Nope. Only the essentials, babe.”
Dean got angry, throwing the lone chair against the wall.
“Sam! He said he wanted the video—the very first one—to show his kids’ grandparents, and I finally gave in, but he went and posted it on Facebook!”
Dean glances over at Anna, who’s hovering by the counter, then dives for the phone. Castiel suppresses a smile.
his father.
“Because he’s
“It’s not a big deal, Cas,” Dean said as the rain beat steadily on the windshield. “We’ll give it a few minutes. It’ll probably clear right up.”
“Whether you’re here to harass him for his role in my current situation or ogle him for a role in your latest movie, he’s here to work, so let him be.” Gabriel has had a fair amount of success making independent films, most of which film in Maine. Thankfully, they’re all clean ones. Now.
seniors and need time and space and
“Sounds good to me!” Garth says, standing. “Come on, you guys! Just soda for me, though. I’ve had my one beer. You know how I am if I drink too much.”
Slow at first, their kisses and touches pick up both in speed and passion until Castiel sees the same desperation in Dean’s eyes that he feels in himself. The promise of full physical connection to complement their emotional connection becomes too much to delay any longer. “Dean,” Castiel whispers. “Are you clean?”
“And you’ve been in an airplane several times now.”
“I know, I know, but I got stung one too many times by those fuckers.” Benny used to live in the country and Cas imagines he’s gotten stung several times in his life.
Cas smirks and playfully shoves his arm, and Dean’s face warms for a completely different reason now. “Let’s go check out the tree you damn near broke your neck for.”
“Okay, good.”
His best option, though, is the man next to him.
“God, I love you,” Dean murmurs, making grabby hands.
“Told you they were more,” he hears Ethan say in hushed tones to Vaughn.
He glances quickly again, then turns back and runs a hand through his hair. “Go for it. I already told you why that’s a bad idea. Besides, you’re the one telling me how boring I am.”
And when Dean’s story comes out, written by Bela and blasted to every media source possible, the responses are swift and strong.
They make their way into the office to collect their keys. Dean’s eyes roam the space, catching on the various signs and notices on a peeling, sun-faded corkboard, while they wait for someone to come around.
Dean sticks out his tongue and Cas grins. He loves the pseudo-sibling relationship Dean has with her.
Cas holds her hand like the princess she is, one finger all that’s needed to support it. He kisses it, then kisses it again. “I should tell you how Daddy and I met,” he tells her, shifting her in his arms a bit so he can see her face better. “I was very scared of almost everybody because some bad things happened to me and my boo-boos hadn’t healed yet. Auntie Jess asked me to dogsit Sully—you love Sully and your Auntie Jess, huh?—and there was Daddy. He had some bad boo-boos, too, but a different kind. He was so happy and so nice to me, and he was so silly and handsome. He helped me make all my boo-boos better. And whenever you get boo-boos, we’re going to help you make them better, okay? I promise. No boo-boos right now, though.” He makes a surprised face at her, then wiggles his tongue against his lips to make funny sounds that Dean knows are making her smile that gummy grin that makes all the sleep-disturbed nights worthwhile. He grins toothily in return, then continues, “You know, they say that girls marry someone like their dad. I don’t know who you’ll fall in love with, but I hope they’re just as good as your Daddy. Just don’t make them wait as long as I made Daddy wait for me, huh?”
The woman—Ynez, by her name tag—scrolls rapidly back and forth though the pictures he screenshot from a Google search of “fashionable men’s clothes.” “You’re on the right track. Let’s see what we can do for you. Oh,” she says, “he’s cute.”
It’s all the domestic shit he’s tried to avoid.
“Oh yeah! So they’re good, right?”
Castiel scowls. “Yes, please, spit them out like a bad taste in your mouth, as I’m sure they are.”
Cas rolls his eyes. With his advanced belts in two forms of martial arts, he hardly needs Dean to defend him. Dean knows this. It’s how they met, after all. “Thank you, but I’m fine. They just need to understand that my hot ass is only for you,” he winks.
“You needed a drink, figured you couldn’t get away from home to get one so...here I am.” He holds up a bottle of Devil’s Deal Whiskey. “You game?”
look like a bit of a hero, or at least the lead in some romantic movie. Gabe was pleased with it because it would both ensure that Dean’s groveling was done at a safe distance and give Cas a little adventure in his life, which he sorely needed. Dean was hesitant (“Are you guys sure about this?”), but agreed. It surprised Gabe, given what they suggested, and it impressed him a little, too.
“Mmmhmm.” He shakes his head with that softly fond look Dean’s such a sucker for and beckons him with a finger. “Come.”
“Probably. Like you would.”
. It would’ve sucked to have gotten that wrong.”
“I mean, we should check with her, though, see if it applied to the bigger picture,” Cas adds quickly. “It might’ve.”
“Yeah, we probably should, honeybunch. You’ve been coughing all day. Best to get you home and into bed so you can start to feel better.”
“They also smell and feel like what Christmas is supposed to smell and feel like.”
“Nuh uh. You’ve been in charge all night. I’m in charge now. I’m gettin’ us both off.”
“We eat there. Why do you have to put your feet on the coffee table?”
On a Friday afternoon, they declare themselves ready for Trial 1: Give Vaughn a taste of his own medicine. They drag Jo and Charlie to Target, once again.
"Ooh," Cas rumbles, popping his brows in interest.
Dean remembers little of what is said, repeating after the officiant some beautiful words he knows he means but can’t remember for the life of him because he’s so entranced by Cas. They exchange their rings again, Dean grateful to have his back. He felt naked without it, its presence a tangible reminder of just how fortunate he is. People talk. People sing. And finally,
“You’re stayin’, right?” Dean asks.
It wasn’t a surprise. Rescuers were moving in and out of the rehab sector to avoid hypothermia from the biting wind. Cas didn’t have that luxury. Though he was sheltered by the building debris and had warm clothes on, neither were insulating enough for him to be completely kept from exposure.
“Turned out great, though.”
, Cas.” Dean kisses him, hard at first, then soft and lingering. They part on a sigh.
At that, Dean perked up. They only went there together, and only because Dean thought Castiel liked the place. Dean would never justify the expense for only himself.
“Bottle’s all set,” Dean declares when he returns.
The children smile at this, though they’ve heard the story countless times.
Castiel can’t help a surprised snort. “No one. Owners don’t get relieved.”
They’re laughing so hard as they scramble around on the loveseat that they don’t notice Vaughn and his buddy Ethan walk in until their front door slams. They peek up from the loveseat like the ferret that Vaughn brought home with him after Thanksgiving—the source of the rodent smell. (So much for no pets in apartments.) Cas is convinced that Vaughn brought it back to annoy them, but the joke's on him, because the squirmy, beady-eyed little thing is sort of cute and smells better than Vaughn does. Less weaselly, too.
So Cas did some of his own research.
“Yes, it is. Q and A’s over; I got lunches to make and you’re all loitering, which is a crime, so get out.”
“As for the rest of you,” Cas says, getting back on track, “it would just be a guess. I’ll say hazel eyes and brown hair?”
“I believe it’s important to take the real work offline, don’t you? To, you know, put in some face time.”
As soon as he opens it, his body aches less and his mind is clearer. It must be the sight of Baby parked there, safe and sound and gleaming thanks to the raindrops covering her body. Seeing something in the front seat, he stumbles around her to the driver’s side and opens her up.
Because he didn’t bring a bag to stay and he needs to see his parents first thing in the morning, anyway, Cas opts to go home. Dean’s feeling great, despite not having (or, rather, finishing) the sex he’d been looking forward to. The night with Cas, just hanging out doing nothing special, was pretty special anyway. Hanging out with Cas is always special, always satisfying in ways he never thought he’d experience, ways he thinks he might have a name for, ways he was afraid of before. He’s finding he’s not afraid anymore. Not with Cas, anyway.
“Yeah, about.”
Cas arches a brow.
, Cas thinks. They don’t know Dean that well, don’t know how he might react or what his feelings might be. He makes another call.
“No, uh, just remembered something, that’s all.” He swipes an arm in the air. “Carry on, carry on.”
“Crowley’s my date,” Cas jokes. “Dean already had plans with some friends. He told us we have to do this again so he can meet you all, though.”
is easy to agree with. “We are very happy. Thank you.”
He wishes he understood Dean’s aversion to his scent. His aversion to
“I know what I am and who I am. Cas told me. So don’t bother.”
Will Dean cry? We’ll see. 😂
work. “What if we built great steps of stone, at least enough for you to jump down safely?”
Cas huffs, but leans against Dean while Dean puts his boots on his feet.
Dean swats him. Turned out that there
“Yet,” he mutters. “So! You guys did it in the basement. You got a kinky horror thing or something?”
“I’m just trying to help you!”
The men walk out of the office and to Dean’s car. They look down the road toward their apartment building, where Cas’ truck is already parked, and exhale at the same time. “So, Option C. Ready?” Dean asks.
“Such a saucy omega I have,” Cas rumbles.
They both shrug. He’s talked to them before about learning to work together, and Jack doesn’t want the talk again. Seems like Claire doesn’t, either.
Dean shoots him a scornful look. “Thanks.”
He looked torn. Castiel recognized the look, the guilt of disappointing someone flooding his best friend. He didn’t want Dean to endure that. Castiel squeezed his shoulder. “Go ahead and take it.”
“I—I know, but he’s gonna get himself into trouble—”
“Yeah. ‘Busy.’” He raised his glass. “But this is our time, so fuck ‘em, right?”
It’s revealed to them a few minutes later as Cas plays “Despacito” (a little inside joke between Cas and some of his Stanford students, he told Dean) on his phone and makes them dance to it. Cas always has his guests on his show dance before they get into things, to “loosen them up” and remind them to never get too comfortable, to take risks in life and in their work. He calls Dean over to him and they dance—nothing dirty, because they’re professionals, damn it—and laugh their asses off. Their enthusiasm is infectious, and the reluctant scientists soon join in.
Dean nods, hiding his face as he leans his elbows against the table.
He’s still eager as he sits in bed, waiting for Cas. He’s hopeful, too, that this will quell the longing and loneliness that’s plagued him all week.
He’s happy to say yes, of course, happy he’ll have some time with his best friend. That’s exactly what they need, really—not sex, just being together. A do-nothing sort of night. Boring. Vanilla.
Dean raises his brows. “What’s that?”
for the song suggestion (and check out her Destiel work!).
“This is the life you want?”
After things die down and Matthew’s sleeping in his swing, Castiel pulls out his newer laptop and shuffles through his papers to get the ordering done for the week. Dean peers over his shoulder. He’s so close that Castiel can feel the heat radiating from his body. “What are you doing?”
They lunge at each other, hot and wanting. Dinner is forgotten in favor of desperate kisses and needy moans, and shoes and shirts are left behind as they stumble to the living room. Cas pushes him to the couch and climbs on top of him. They fumble with the buttons and zippers on each other’s pants until Dean takes over his own and Cas does the same. Freeing themselves, they reach for each other, mouthing madly over muscles and tendons as they work one another over, Cas coming within minutes and Dean following shortly after.
. Cas was definitely all his boss fantasies come true...he was even hotter than that guy on the telenovela he watches when he
“Details.” He sniffs, then adds, “I suppose I could join your game. I would like to see the fellow who has you all a-flutter, Feathers.”
The talk of the morning was shapeshifter lore, apparently, which did not go well with coffee but did remind him that he had to reach out to that shapeshifter therapist to see what she might be able to do for him. Ordinarily he wouldn’t mix business with his personal crap, but there weren’t too many therapists out there who would listen to what he was saying and
. We’re just friends.”
In the middle of March, Castiel comes to his final decision.
With a stormy look, Lee growls, “Fine. Don’t need you, anyway.” He stomps out the door, slamming it closed behind him.
Dean gently tilts Cas’ face to his, supporting his head as he leans in. His gaze drops to his lips before meeting those blue eyes that are always on his mind, those eyes that always motivate him to stay safe, to come home.
He senses movement in front of him and someone whispering, but he can’t make out the words. Not for him, he assumes, so he ignores them and waits.
“Exactly. There is scientific evidence that physical touch is vital for humans, and that even just being in someone else’s presence physically makes a positive difference.”
Dean spends all of the time it takes for Sam to wash, dry, and put away the dishes writing his note (Sam thinks that was likely to get out of helping). When it’s finished, Dean lets him take a look. It’s good. Nothing earth-shattering, nothing deep, but good. Sam tells him so, and he sees his brother relax. That idiotic smile comes back—muted, but there.
“I don’t know. Maybe you buy sand with it.”
“Hey, knock it off,” Dean chastises her quietly, though he doesn’t disagree with her.
Dean looks at him, silently asking him what, if anything, he should say. Cas shrugs, holding out his hand as if to say
“I dare say you’ll find a few advantages.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighs and slaps a hand on the leg that’s still jiggling. “Uh, yeah. She makes videos all the time. Thought it was just another one of those, so I hammed it up for her. I had no idea she was gonna send it out. Found out about
Dean came back again. And again.
“Sí, por favor.” Cas calls Carmen to his side, thinking he could get out of his depth with the language if her question is complicated. Soon, the woman’s blush has disappeared and they are engaged in an in-depth discussion of her research on dark matter. He’s confident, listening to her speak, that the future of astrophysics is in good hands.
Castiel shuddered.
Dean doesn’t smell any different than usual, so he knows Cas is just acting. He feels bad; he should’ve put more thought into this, but he’s been so nervous about it. Cas put thought into it, though, and
Sam is a gaping, confused mess after they explain the basics of fanfic, followed by interesting details such as the biology of Alphas and Omegas, why tentacles are a thing, animal fics, BDSM depictions, slash, and the cultural importance of fanfic, particularly in the expression for and representation of marginalized populations. Eileen, Jo, and Charlie are laughing at him, and Cas is quiet but seems engaged. Not put off by the topic, anyway. He’s listening. Dean can tell because he has that “listening face” on—intense stare, slight scowl that isn’t really a scowl. Dean feels for his brother—he was just as overwhelmed when he got into it—so he figures he’ll engage the ladies while Sam’s brain recalibrates. Plus, he kind of wants to nerd out.
“Hey, look who showed up!” Dean grinned, thumbing backwards toward their new friends as he relieved Castiel of the pitcher.
Cas shakes his head. “I don’t think I could ever be a dom in the traditional sense. I don’t even understand it, to be honest. I thought it was just about having a little fun—plastic handcuffs, blindfolds, being ‘bossy’, maybe a playful swat to the ass. But I think it’s more complex than I thought. I’d have to know a lot more to do this right, and I think that the level of trust you have to have in a partner to do this is too much for a simple roleplay. I just wanted you to feel good and let go a little.”
Or maybe he could just date Cas.
Bess stops him with a hand to his wrist. “What if you already knew he loves you? Would you tell him you love him then?”
“We’re past crossing lines, aren’t we, Dan?” He strokes Dean’s shaft.
“The fuck do you mean? You’re awesome! All my friends suck compared to you.”
be loading it. This is supposed to be a—um, a fun weekend for you.”
“Just once,” he smiles back. He’d love to keep that smile on Dean’s face all for himself, but instead he decides to be a good friend and say, “Yeah, Anna’s awesome. So, um, what’s next for you two?”
Twenty minutes later, they’re gorging themselves on cold pizza and playing Bullshit, a card game that they're about equally matched on. After that, they play a “What am I?” game with Post-Its that they stick on each other’s heads as they share the last square of slab pie, sharing the fork as well when Dean drops his on the floor. And after that, they play video games, arms and legs knocking together repeatedly as they run, shoot, and punch.
about the youth softball games happening today, to which she squealed and told him, in no uncertain terms, that they were going.) He’s always found blockers irritating, and they certainly did him no favors today. For Dean’s comfort, though, he wore them, just as he tried to make Dean comfortable by staying aloof rather than trying to engage, though that seemed to make him just as uncomfortable.
“I know. I have no doubt; I feel it. If I doubted it, we wouldn’t have done this.”
Castiel watches the scene unfold before him.
He handed his phone to Charlie without waiting for a response. Cas would understand. The sooner he could find out what the plan was, the sooner they’d get him out.
Another kiss is pressed under Castiel’s ear. “’Kay.” He pauses, then whispers against Castiel’s skin, “You’re the only one I believe, you know.”
Dad leans in close. “I bet he’ll cry.”
It’s the question he’s been asking himself all week. “I—I don’t know. He just said, ‘I think I need to stop now.’ So we stopped.”
Alone now that he dropped Matthew at his mom and dad’s house half an hour ago, Castiel picks up his phone and goes to his text messages, thumbing through long conversations with Dean before he types:
Well, not
“Just a rough night. Matthew didn’t sleep well.”
Dean shoves his hands into his pockets. “I mean, yeah—”
“Yeah. Uh, how about the artist one? Pretty straightforward.”
“Stop looking at me, Dean, you’re missing it,” he grumbles.
“I had a run-in with past me.” He chuckles humorlessly, nuzzling Kiri. It’s hard to remember a time when Cas thought he was a danger to everyone he met and vice versa, a time when he was too frightened to even consider having a pet, never mind a child.
“Allowing someone agency over their lives isn’t a courtesy or a kindness. It’s their right.”
“The swipe of shame. Damn.”
He turned to Sam. “We’re close.”
“Okay, cool.” He squeezes his knee. “And hey, I need to apologize, man. I was purposely making things difficult for you to goad you into spanking me instead of being honest and asking for what I wanted. And the thing is, I know I could have asked you and you would’ve been cool with talking about it. I just...I guess this is new stuff for me, too—being a sub, asking for what I want, that stuff. But I trust you, so...I dunno, just, I’m sorry and thanks for being willing to do this with me.”
This is a story about the roles we play, the friends we play them with, and becoming real.
“Oh, yeah, just thinking of how hot this is,” he says sarcastically, mouth pressed just above Cas’ clavicle.
“Oh, it’s so good to have them here,” Dean mutters with all the sarcasm he can muster.
“And yet you still knew I was talking to you.” He marches up to the spineless, dickless excuse of a human being. “The fuck’s your problem?”
“Lookin’ a little better, there, sunshine,” Dean calls as he approaches them.
“Sure.”
“Stop it.”
Not that Dean wants to stop. He definitely doesn’t. He just wishes they could do it without all the pretense.
Castiel nodded. Dean was the only one who never misunderstood his messages. Though, with Charlie, Castiel believed it was equally likely that she was playing dumb to get them to talk.
Gabe nods.
Dean turns to find Meg Masters, the coach for one of the teams playing next, on the other side of Sarah. “Jesus, I should’ve known,” he mutters.
“Oh, he’s no trouble. I, uh, I hope it was okay that we fed him and took him in. We actually thought he was a stray, even though he looked a little too well taken care of. Never saw him come from anywhere.”
“Asked you about what?”
Dean huffs a tiny laugh. He’s got him there. “Yeah, I know. It’s not logical, I know it’s not, I just, I can’t help it, I—”
Dean soon sees why Eileen chose this place—there’s a man translating the songs into ASL, and he is
“It’s not exactly the best way to start a relationship,” she agreed. “But then again, my parents hated each other when they met, and they’ve been married thirty-five years and counting.”
Dean scowls.
Eventually they turn back to the movie, but Cas has no idea what’s going on. Soon it doesn’t matter, because Dean is snoring lightly next to him. “Hey,” he says, kissing the top of his head as he jostles his shoulder. “Bedtime.”
“Happy eight day anniversary, Cas.”
But Dean is nothing if not persistent. He ducks under Cas’ arm and grabs a strawberry.
Their sweet first date/proposal song is “I Choose You” by Sara Bareilles:
He doesn’t dare bring it up to the dragon, though. The subject of the prince who once lived here might be a tricky one, and he doesn’t want to fracture their friendship.
After that it was sort of...confusing.
Knowing that Cas changed and hid certain things about himself for Dean makes Dean realize, with sudden clarity, that he did the very same thing with Lee. Maybe it wasn’t just that Lee felt insecure about him changing...maybe Lee didn’t even know
“Damn, someday you're gonna tell me who ripped out your heart and stomped on it,” he hears her murmur.
For a long time she simply stands there, picking at her nails and kicking at the doormat. Finally, she nods. “Okay, let’s do this.” She strides past him into the station and swings her purse onto the equipment table against the wall. She opens it, then pulls out a sheaf of papers.
“Anyway, uh, maybe this Dan guy isn’t like that. Maybe he likes a different type. You know, like lovable, artsy nerds. Or geek chic. Whatever makes his husband happy, ‘cause when he’s happy, he looks great anyway.”
“Oh yeah? Bet he won’t think that. Bet he’s gonna be pissed at you, probably hate you and ditch your ass like you deserve—”
pleasure, since he can’t do anything about his own. He’s being
“You weren’t worried about the delicate ears of your neighbors this morning, bean.”
Hey, they did pretty good, didn’t they?
“Cal doesn’t dress like that.”
Cas blinks, probably at the rapidness of his response. “Uh, I thought it was good. Vanilla sex wasn’t as boring as I expected.”
universe, want to have sex with.
“I don’t know if this is going to work. Yet.” He points his index finger toward Dean. “But, I know people just like him. My brother, for one. Luc, for two. Your father, I suspect, for three. And my father, what little I know of him, was like that, too. And what do they all have in common?”
They label the next week-and-a-half “Pre-Trial,” in which they determine what will get to their roommate the most. The things that seem to get under his skin are invasions of “his” space, being friendly to his friends, sexuality, in general, and sexuality, in terms of orientation. Cas and Dean take careful notes, and Dean starts thinking of it less as a chore and more as empowerment and starts to have fun with it.
Cas opens his eyes and sits up. “Yes, I am. Finally. You have cured me,” he manages.
Castiel chuckled as he rolled off the couch to help Dean set the table.
The dam broke, Dean spilling out the last several months of projects and ass-kissing and terrible personalities he had to deal with as Castiel massaged his shoulders.
Castiel snickers. “Poutine?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut it,” Cas mutters as Crowley smiles with all the innocence of the serpent in the Garden of Eden.
“Yeah.”
), and asks about going out later to pick up a couple of things for her locker. Dean also takes a bit of good-natured ribbing from her, teasing him about how he’s “famous” at school now because the video she posted on YouTube from Father’s Day has thousands of views. He’s a little embarrassed about his blubbering, but he’s not sorry for it.
“Fuck,” his boyfriend gasps when he’s finished. “Cas, fuck, baby. Love you.” He pulls out and wraps his arms around Castiel, rolling them onto their sides.
He rolls his eyes and returns his concentration to the ledger before him. He fuckin’
Castiel chuckles as his eyes skate over Matthew, too. “I thought he was...well, not the most attractive kid at first.”
“Why not?”
“Dude! Look what I found!” Dean grabbed his wrist to get his attention and to tug him closer. “This place makes mead! Like, all kinds. We should definitely go there.”
Cas is so far off the mark it’s laughable, but how can Dean admit that the real reason is because he can’t fuck somebody else and then come home to Cas, to their shared meals they make in their shared kitchen and eat on plates they bought together at a table made for two, to their ugly loveseat they barely fit on where Cas loses to him at video games and pouts with a hint of a smile, to where they brush their teeth together and argue over whose turn it is to wash the dishes and when to turn off the lights? How can he admit that the real reason is because he doesn’t want meaningless sex anymore, or sex with anyone but Cas, because he’s been slowly but steadily falling in love with him over the last two years? “Heh, yeah, guess so,” he replies, because he can’t admit any of it. “What’s your excuse, Casanova?”
“Yeah, well, sometimes that’s a good front, don’t ya think?”
to choose an extra leg, which would allow him, among other things, to do cool parkour tricks, wipe his ass hands-free, beat Spider-Man in a fight, probably, and have a built-in seat anywhere he goes (“Plus the third wheel adds stability!” “It’s a leg.”).
“You were too busy being an amazing husband.”
Now, he’s brushing his teeth and studying himself in the mirror, feeling blue himself. What’s happened to him? There was a time when he’d be thrilled to be going out to have a little fun. Tonight, he’d rather stay home. He still likes to have fun, but his idea of fun has...expanded.
“I’m going to, believe me.”
“But you do.” Dean squeezed his wrist. “It’s your vacation too, right? We should go after this.”
hot, sue him). Cas sits close to him, as he always does, and Dean sweats, as he always does. It’s getting worse as time wears on. He glances at Cas’ hands. They’re so fucking sexy, and Cas doesn’t even realize how much he turns Dean on when he rubs his hands along his thighs absently. He does it a lot. Cas is a fidgeter. Those hands have featured in many of his fantasies...on his legs, his chest, in his hair, on his cock...on Dean’s legs, his chest, in his hair, on his cock...
His “target” is on the move, leaving his house. Cas follows.
But Dean’s feelings weren’t fake. The argument...that wasn’t really fake, either, not on his side of things. He really is pissed that Cas won’t consider him as a boyfriend. He really is pissed that Cas thinks he’d hurt him.
“Well, you
“I didn’t expect you to even show up. I thought you were being facetious.”
Claire smiles, probably remembering the times Dean read
A day after that, Dean calls, this time looking less than amused.
Dean smiles on a sigh. “Nah, everything’s fine, just...I dunno. Wanted to, I guess.” He doesn’t clarify whether he’s talking about the hug or the drinks.
“No! Gross! Dude’s married! And my friend!”
Castiel is hardly in a position to argue, since resting is about all he can manage, anyway—that and sending a message off to his Trusty Rusties:
“I don’t see it.”
, he doesn’t exactly blame Dean for wanting someone more his type, someone he’d be attracted to in real life, not just in a roleplay. He gets it. Sort of.
Castiel scoffed. “Right.”
, Zoe. Responsibilities that you’ve never bothered to take.”
“When I want to be, I guess,” Castiel jokes.
He follows it with his tongue.
Softly, Dean says, “Thanks.”
“Vaughn,” Jilly sighs, “we’ve explained this—”
“That’s good. I need someone who can keep up with me.” He nibbles at Dean’s earlobe as his hands and pelvis work Dean over.
“I’m...what?”
“They’re home,” Cas said behind them.
“Not the cookies!” He drops dramatically to the floor, pretending to choke. “Save me from Dad’s cooking!” he cries.
“Equality is sexy, isn’t it?” Cas grins. He pecks Dean on the lips, then slaps his hip gently. “We have to get dressed.”
“Oh, of course. We don’t want any of you to be uncomfortable, and I’m sure it would make you all just as uncomfortable if Vaughn was bringing all sorts of strangers home.”
Cas rescues his husband’s lip from between his teeth and kisses him softly. “You’re going to be fine, my love. I promise.”
But all he can think about is Dean. How it felt to have sex with him. How it felt
Disgusting domesticity, it turns out, isn’t disgusting at all.
Harry glares at his nephew. “Vaughn Marshall Reynolds—”
They have several beds to choose from inside the house, and even the cushions of the sofa on the deck would probably be more forgiving than the ground, but neither of them move from where they’re tangled in each other. Castiel
“Couch,” Cas rasps after he’s given Dean a taste of just why he’s better than all of his delivery co-workers.
“Look, Dean, you don’t have to go. You can stay here in paradise. But paradise won’t be so paradisiacal without the chance to work through the injustice that was served upon you. You can do that here, certainly, but wouldn’t you rather shove an oak tree up the ass of fate and live a long life?”
The sex Dean treated him to after that admission was spectacular. He was grateful that they’d moved their bed to the living room after their love declarations and their incredible evening at their house. Like Dean said, love makes you do crazy things, and yeah, it’s a little crazy for two grown men to have their bed in the living room, but if that’s the only way they can get privacy, then to hell with it. It’s temporary, anyway, and it’s good to get Matthew used to sleeping in his own space.
“Oh,” Cas utters, pleased. “Well, thank you.” They release each other, and Cas adds, “All right, time to make you spend some money on me. Benny, some outrageous Halloween cocktails for us, please?”
He grunts a greeting to Vaughn as they pass each other, Vaughn giving him the barest of greetings but his gaze lingering on the cups and plate in his hands. Dean ignores him and shoulders the bedroom door open. Cas is sitting up; their pillows are propped side by side, squished together. He takes the plate while Dean places the hot beverages on their end tables. When he reaches for his pillow to slide it over, though, Cas tugs it back. “Lazy mornings are for cuddling, cuddle bear,” he says, almost sternly.
, anyway? No, they’ll stay like this, which is fine. Perfectly fine. They don’t have to share a name or a health insurance plan, or even live together. He has
for.”
Cas mentioned running into her on Wednesday. He leans in eagerly, hanging on her every word.
“And you’re really gonna kick yourself...check out the ‘Vette he drives.”
He shakes his head. It’s enough to drive a person mad.
“Of course.” He rubbed his back, which felt
Even if he believed that he and Cas’ relationship was stronger than his others (which he absolutely did) and could withstand the difficulties of his work, he saw the haunted look on his stepmother’s face after his dad died, and then Cas’ when they talked about it. When they returned home after the funeral, Cas even developed the habit of checking on him every time they returned from a dangerous call. How could he, in good conscience, get into a relationship with Cas and risk that for both of them? Cas had a quiet life. He did his time in dangerous situations in Afghanistan while he was in the Army. He didn’t need to worry about Dean constantly (though he did anyway, Dean knew), and he didn’t want to put him through the same sort of grief that his stepmother went through. He had to do what was best for Cas, even if it hurt.
“Mmmmmm,” Cas hums. He’s barely awake, Dean can tell, but he also knows that blowjobs are Cas’ favorite morning treat. More than his homemade cinnamon rolls, even.
As they fall asleep after round two, Dean thinks of all the things he needs to do when he gets home. Renting a moving truck is the first on his list.
A short time later, he gets:
With another once-over, Dean says, “How much to fuck you?”
“Drove me crazy seeing you shirtless. Drove me just as crazy seeing you button this thing up.” He flicks each button out of its hole deftly with one hand.
As he makes his way to the back of Whole Foods, he wonders what Cas has in store for him. He told him a bit about the alpha/omega thing, but he felt too self-conscious to tell him much. He figured he’d tell him what he needed to know as they went, or they’d just improvise. But Cas has apparently done some reading if he knows about true mates. He shouldn’t be surprised. Cas is a smart guy, a determined guy, a guy who knows just how much Dean put into the last roleplay and would return the favor in spades. He’s a good friend like that...thoughtful, caring, easygoing. The best person he’s ever known, honestly.
“I wasn’t planning to stay here. Had no clue what I was gonna do, but staying hadn’t really crossed my mind. The day I hit your place was my thirty-third birthday, and it was gonna be my last day in Maine. I was craving a good seafood dinner, and I figured that’s what you eat when you’re in Maine, right? Sam told me I shouldn’t go out, but I told him it was my birthday and I should get to have what I wanted to have and I wasn’t gonna let crappy weather stop me. I was...vain. Selfish. Entitled.”
“Yeah I do.” He tugs him into a fierce hug. “This is what I should’ve done when you got here, not tried to jump you. Welcome home. Missed you, man.”
“Your loss. I’m gettin’ one for me.” He pulls one out of the bin.
Cas nodded again. They gazed at each other until, slowly, Dean cupped Castiel’s face. “I love you, too, you know.”
: ASL interpreter at a karaoke night; handjob in the bathroom
. You wanna eat some sandwiches and talk?”
But instead, Cas lets go of his hand and says, “It’s true.”
"Yes, he loves that. Russian Blues are very smart and friendly.”
“Good luck with your romantic gesture,” she whispers. He’d confided in Sarah about something he’s planning to do for Cas during their honeymoon.
“He can do plenty. And what he can’t do, or doesn’t want to do, I’ll do by myself or with someone else. We don’t have to be attached at the hip.”
“Whatever you like, sweetheart. I trust your judgment.”
“‘Work some stuff out,’ Dean?” Lee scoffs in a judgmental tone that pisses Cas off even more. He’s not even doing his job anymore, if he ever was. Dean considers Lee one of his best friends, and Cas puts up with him because of it, but he’s making fun of Dean when he can see Dean is uncomfortable and Cas can’t stand it. He’s not much of a fighter, but he
“Cas.”
“Because every idiot like him thinks they’re smarter than everyone else. And that, my friend, is where we beat him.”
As they’re wrapping up their conversation, Castiel hears singing from his phone. He smirks at the screen. “Look at this,” he says to Bobby.
“I don’t. I won’t.”
He feels like he’s in control for the first time in hours.
“Right.”
Sam and Gabe meet him at the entrance. He’s grateful they could both take an extended lunch break to help him shop (or, honestly, to offer moral support and convince him that it’s not too soon and Cas really will say yes).
“And managed to get yourself beat up after.”
. Anger and shame jockey for position in his brain, his father on his mind. His subtle but ever-present bias has always made Dean hesitate about a relationship with a guy...until Cas, at least. He looks to his best friend, who always helps to steady him.
brother is the innocent one here.”
Castiel watches, fascinated and amused, as Mr. Winchester shimmies around the kitchen while Bea carries on with her unicorn stamp—no, colored glue now—as if her father dancing around the kitchen is completely normal.
“Right.”
Castiel sits and holds a calmer, drowsy Gabriel at arm’s length, looking him squarely in the face. He fits into both of Castiel’s hands easily, with room to spare. “Hello, honey. Hello. Ooh, I see you peeking at me with one squinty little eye. I see you. Yes. Look at you. You have so much to look forward to, don’t you? Yes. I can already tell you’re going to be loud and proud in this world, aren’t you? Yes, you are. Yes.” He grins as Gabriel’s eyes flutter closed. He thumbs at his cheek and says, “You are a fighter. You are strong. You will overcome. You already have, beautiful boy.”
“Let’s get to usin’ that freedom, then.”
weren’t supposed to be there,” Cas volleyed back.
“What?”
“Because there’s only one bed that I know of.”
“He’ll be fine.”
Nearly two months into his new relationship with Cas (and his new relationship with himself), Dean is already seeing the difference. He’s healthier, more relaxed. Happier.
“Okay, Sam, sorry.” Dean grew quiet for a moment, then added, “Can I at least say I plan to get a proper nailing when we get home?”
Smiling because he’s starting to understand Crowley’s odd way of trying to make friends and be included, he replies, “All right, then, Grinch. We’ll talk about it at home.”
“So please,
“You were falling asleep out there, hon. Go to sleep,” he says as he slides under the covers and turns off the bedside light.
And now he’s by himself, miserable.
Cas stands and leads him by the hand to their bedroom. They undress, then lock lips for several long, luxurious moments. “So, what do you feel like talking about instead?” Cas asks when they part.
“Yeah, well, remember that when I’m kicking your ass next game night.”
Lee looks straight at him. His poker face is clearly on, but Dean sees right through him. Finally. “The point of the game is to lie.”
“Oh, you’d be the troublemaking student who always challenged me in class,” Dean smirks.
“When the fuck did you do that?”
Dean tries not to jump for joy at having Cas next to him once again. With all their friends’ eyes on him, though—eyes that know what they get up to in the bedroom, and one set of eyes that was just giving him shit for being a “mope” about Cas’ absence—it feels strange to even hug him, though he normally would because he’s his best friend and he hasn’t seen him in two weeks. So instead of a hug, he smirks and murmurs, “Hey, New Guy.”
“Now imagine if they saw your other two.”
“Castiel Novak. Nice to meet you,” his friend says, offering his hand as he shoots Dean a puzzled glance. Dean points to the sign on the corkboard, proclaiming
Can’t change the past, Dean figures, so he focuses on his questions about the present and immediate future—how Vaughn will get his things out of here, what happens if he doesn’t, when will the rent go up. What will happen with Cas. And one other, burning question:
“Yeah, yeah, just...I stay out of trouble over here.”
At that, Dean snickered. He’d never liked fate all that much. Rather than answer him, though, he asked, “Bobby said you took on my heaven as your special project. You tryin’ to get rid of me ‘cause I caught you with your pants down?”
Dean turns the page to see a picture of Claire talking to Dean through their balconies back at the old apartment building. He’s never seen the photo before. He marvels at how small Claire was.
: Cas is an accountant; mention of food poisoning; use of Hottie to describe Dean; making the bed break with enthusiastic sex
Dean shrugs. “That sounds good to me.”
Cas smiles, scrunching his nose in the way that Dean finds utterly adorable. “Well, I’m about as pure as the driven
Even drunk, Castiel knew this plan had its difficulties. He expected the worst. Still, he had just enough hope and alcohol in his system to hush his better judgment. Castiel agreed, and they started planning.
“Listen, I like metaphorical sausage too! I’m not judging!”
“Sweetheart?” Crowley smirks.
“Yeah, but—”
Dean side-eyes Cas. “Maybe not friends,” he mouths. Cas chuckles silently.
“Because I’m not like your other friends. They’re cool people who do cool things and I’m just...not cool and I had to—”
And came again.
. It makes his eyes crinkle up, and there are these little lines…Oh, and when he says certain words, or when he’s smiling and makes this kinda “ah” sound, his upper lip quirks up to the left and it’s so fuckin’ cute and really…” He trails off when he sees Charlie grinning at him like a loon. He thinks he’s answered her question a little too well. “Uh, so yeah, he’s pretty hot.”
Cas turns to him, and though he knows those eyes can’t see him, they still seem to, in a way that goes beyond physical sight. “It is, but some people get really upset about it. I mean, you’re supposedly quite physically attractive, Dean, but I can’t really tell you that you look good the way others can. I mean, I could comment on the way your skin feels, or how big your muscles are, or that you smell nice. That’s how I judge physical attractiveness now. But I have found, surprisingly, that most people don’t relate to that all that well. They want to know how they
“Yeah. He invited both of us, but I know it’s not your thing, and—”
“Hmm?”
“What’d we miss?” Gabriel asks.
“Dean, he said himself that he was going too fast. It could’ve happened to anybody.”
“No,” Dean answers with an edge of snark to match the way the question was asked. “But you were right. And since I’m gonna be around a while, might as well dress like it, huh?”
Groaning, Dean takes the other love of his life from Cas’ arms. “Kiri, not sleeping for Papa again?”
Cas grins, his chest filled with affection. Dean loves to cook. And though Dean’s never been a huge fan of veggies, he suspects this will be the impetus for an entirely new appreciation of plant-based foods for him—maybe for both of them.
ready, Dean?”
Cas chuckles. “I guess my acting was authentic, then?”
am the one who nursed them through every sickness, comforted them after every nightmare, attended every meeting. That was all
Cas’ eyes widen, but he stays quiet. Dean opens a side door, then guides Cas to step in before him. Eileen is waiting there, holding an iPad.
A few days later, Dean arrives at Cas’ to find a small tabletop feather tree, already decorated in miniature blue and silver ornaments. “Glittery,” Dean comments about the baubles.
“You took care of him, right?” Charlie interrupts this time.
“Here.”
Dean runs off. He expects Cas to follow right away, but he doesn’t. He finally emerges from the house a couple of minutes later. “You made me wait!” Dean calls across the yard.
“Not the point.” Finished with his wrist, Dean exchanged a fresh gel pack for the one warming against Cas’ eye. “I know you’re all ‘buff ex-military guy’, but there were
Dean pulls out of his arms. Softly, hesitantly, he says, “Cas, I—I’m not gonna ask you to marry me someday. I, uh—”
He couldn’t find one.
Castiel soaked under the hot spray, his mind reeling. This weekend was so much better than their last weekend away, and yet so much
tonight,” Vaughn sneers. Dean still hasn’t gotten used to Vaughn’s derision (not that he should), and it rubs at him.
“Unless you need more time...”
at least trying to see if a relationship could work.
This is why he brought both of them. Balance.
“Thought I’d feel better,” Dean confesses, hands joined between them on the couch.
“Thinking about how much I love you.” He smiles wider, making full use of his panty-dropping dimples.
“Mmmhmm.”
He really is delirious.
Hmm. Surely their next meeting will go better. Right? 🤷🏻♀️
When they finally arrived and the sirens were silenced, Dean exhaled in a rush. “Cas? We’re here. I’m gonna go out there and—”
“Do you know we’ve done more boyfriendy things than I ever did with my boyfriends?”
“He hasn’t said anything,” Cas confides in his siblings over video chat. “Not a word. And he calls me ‘buddy’ and we’re doing all the same shit we’ve always done, you know? It’s like nothing’s changed.”
“Don’t listen to Dean, Sam. He’s just jealous because he’s never had a Christmas tree in July.”
“I just…” Dean started. “I—I don't know what I do now. My parents, both of them now, just...”
“Fine,” he answers, though he doesn’t open the curtain.
Sam groans, Gabe cackles, and Dean and Cas, having just walked in, walk right back out again.
“Ooh, baby.”
“Best story ever,” Dean growls, flipping him over and making Cas lose his words.
Well! Lots of excitement last time! This time can't be nearly as exciting or angsty, right? They're just having pizza. *whistles*
Smiling around his cock, he slides up and down, changing his pace to see what makes Dean squirm the most. Delighting in his sounds and movements, he loses himself in the pleasure of giving pleasure until there’s a tug on his hair.
“Sounds good. Now come on. I got breakfast to make.”
“Uh, ask nicely?”
“You don’t care about dick size, Cas?”
They laugh softly together, Cas thinking of the many times he’s beaten Dean at board games and the many times he’s been beaten by Dean at video games. And though they’re attempting to hang up, neither of them seems to want to.
He met Patience on her usual Wednesday shift. In addition to working on Sundays, she works 11:00 to 6:00 every Wednesday because they have a weekly sale on Italians. She was cool to Dean at first, but warmed up quickly.
“You don’t want to go back to bed?”
“No, Dean, he didn’t
They lie quietly for a while, but Cas doesn’t sleep, sensing the tension still present in Dean’s muscles and breath.
, most likely, so many people will be out in the storm—”
“I did.”
“Okay, so you know Mr. Novak and I are good friends.”
Remembering their conversation from when they first moved in, Dean cracks. Cas covers his outburst with a loud, fake yelp, then a real one when Dean gets his revenge by tickling his very ticklish friend. Real bouncing and panting are happening now, and Dean nearly forgets they’re putting on an act until Cas starts “coming,” making Dean back off and “come,” too.
Damn, they're cute, aren't they? But you wanted to know more about Lee, right? Are you disappointed that you didn't get enough of that this time? Tune in next time for that and more. ;)
He does. “Where’s Kiri?”
“Time out,” Cas calls, and despite Dean being mid-thrust, he stops immediately. “What’s going on?”
Relieved, Dean laughs yet again. “I think we’re gonna get along.”
you would.” Cas winks. He knows they’re thinking of the same night a few months ago, when Dean visited him at work in the middle of the night. Dean winks back and runs his hand along Cas’ thigh.
Castiel tries to wriggle out of his hold. “I don’t need—”
When he’s nude, Dean pulls him into his lap, both of them moaning loudly as the touches become mutual. He coats his hand with lube, then tugs on Cas’ cock with a lust-addled clumsiness. Cas draws their cocks together, urging Dean to move with him as he jerks them off. They watch the shiny red-purple heads disappear and reappear though their fingers; Cas wonders just what colors he’d have to mix to get that precise shade. That thought leaves him as a gorgeous splash of milky white spurts from Dean’s cock and splatters over them.
“Eww.” She takes them anyway.
The dragon looks at the flowers at his feet. Dean feels utterly ridiculous giving flowers to a dragon, but he seemed to like the hollyhock blossom last time. And indeed, he seems to like these. His tail swishes as he takes the bouquet in his mouth and places it gently on his pile of leaves.
“He thinks all guys into guys are about the sex, anyway,” Dean says. Cas does have a point about overselling things, but selfishly, he really wants to kiss him as much as he can, so he doesn’t want to make their plan have
“That’s a good idea,” Cas says thoughtfully. Dean needs no convincing. “Sometimes we don’t know when he’s coming home, though. He’s not always predictable. Can you text us if you happen to see him heading up?”
Dean folds his arms. “Don’t call me that when I’m trying to be annoyed with you.”
“I—I don’t know how.”
the measure of a person. He’s grateful for his attributes, sure, because they’ve helped him support himself comfortably. But it feels fucked up, too, to sell cologne or clothing or a damn
“Huh. Is that what those machines are for?”
“You weren’t, and you’re not. You healed, you united, you cared about complete strangers, you put everyone else ahead of you, you
“And don’t you forget it.”
“Well, yeah, not that, obviously.”
“I know,” he says, still walking and hanging on.
“Shut up!”
“Awesome. Well, I dunno about you, but I’m beat. Maybe we can get up early, get some breakfast before we get on the trails?” Dean stretched his arms high over his head as he walked toward the bed, his body lengthening, much like Castiel’s...
After treating the stain, he stuffs the comforter into the large-capacity washing machine. He sets it for a quick wash, hoping to get this all done before Dean wakes. Quietly, he steps out of the laundry room, closing the door behind him.
In tonight’s roleplay, they’re in some sort of dom/sub contract where Cas comes to perform his “services” or whatever. Dean doesn’t really care about the particulars. He just wants to get his hands on Cas again.
you!” He steps closer to Lee on wobbly feet, nearly toe-to-toe with the man.
“Listen, if they didn’t plan ahead, that’s on them. Plus, no offense, but if they’re doing their Valentine’s Day shopping at a convenience store on the day of, they got bigger problems they should focus on.”
“How?”
Dean snorts. The phrase is something they say when one of them is being extra ridiculous. Cas doesn’t believe him, clearly, but Dean remains undeterred.
“You’re not even giving me a chance.”
. With a wistful sigh, he pushes their pillows a little closer before leaving the bedroom.
At first, they talked about his condition, how he was doing. He said he was fine, that he was in a small space but that it was holding steady. Cas had already told Charlie about the other guy, so Dean didn’t ask him any more about that.
Miraculously, Cas shuts up.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Working is what most people do during the day.”
“Then what’s he doing here
“Yeah, I know.” He hangs his head low, chin nearly touching his chest.
Cas laughs at Dean’s outburst, but not for long.
, Dean”), who both saved the day by intervening on his behalf in the name of keeping the star of the American TV show happy (not that said star knew anything about it). It’s not quite the surprise Dean wanted, but he thinks it’ll be pretty good anyway. He just hopes Cas thinks so, too.
“How dare he. How fucking dare he.”
When it’s all over, Cas weaves his way through the crowd to his family. His mom and Pup are here, Gabe and his new beau are here, Hannah is here with a friend (quite a friend she is to sit through all
“And I wanted you to be honest!”
“Ending it on a good note, huh?”
“A plan that includes
Dean pouts. “Damn you, making me wanna play hooky when we both know we can’t.”
“Hey, I already had Sam bitch at me, all right?”
“Maybe that’s because you had a taste, dude,” Gabe interjects. “Now you know what it’s like to have him as a boyfriend. You didn’t know before you guys did this whole thing you did.”
and winks at him, which just about sends him to an early grave. “Like that?” he says aloud, then lifts his shirt and slaps his own flank again, grunting and bouncing faster.
It’s been a WEEK, hasn’t it? Phew! ❤️
“I think of us being with our families together, figuring out how to split holidays.”
Dean sniffles. “Asshole, teasing me like that,” he manages, his voice watery but clearly affectionate. Cas relaxes his shoulders and holds him tighter.
“Coffee at seven, Zoom call with investors at eight, and at nine o’clock, fuck your secretary until he screams?” Dean’s eyes lift from the paper, lit with amusement.
“Then why are you?”
“Did Dean cause all that damage?”
“What do you know about Seraphim, Mr. Daniel Smith?”
As if Dean suddenly remembers that he has a purpose other than coming in here and making googly eyes at him (not that Cas is opposed), Dean breaks their embrace and takes his hand. “Come on.”
“We have backup plans in case,” Sam assures him, always the more sensitive of the two. “If he doesn’t like being away from home, we’ll come back here and camp in the yard or on the beach, or he can be inside, whatever.”
“Oh yeah?”
Dean huffs. “Yeah, well, he’s a stubborn son of a bitch.”
“Ass. I mean how, like, how...I mean, not
“Figures. Fuck my life.”
A couple of hours in, Dean’s having a fantastic time. The pool is hopping, the grill is hot, and everyone he loves is there and is having fun...except he can’t find Cas anywhere.
Dean nods as he takes out a scoop and a carton of vanilla ice cream, one of the few basics he has left because he hasn’t done much shopping or cooking, preferring to stay away from home as much as he could. He grabs a few bowls, then warms the scoop with hot water for easier serving and pops the lid off the container.
Of all the questions Dean has asked, he hasn’t asked the one that Cas has unintentionally brought up. He assumed he knew the answer, maybe, or he never wanted to ask and bring up bad feelings. “You remember colors and stuff?”
“Hmm. I do like some nice duds.”
“Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Sam’s already told me.”
“Yes. But people like him read other people well. I wonder if he believes us.”
“Mmm, he sure can. I’d love to get my mouth around his cruller.”
Dean ambles to an empty corner and leans against the wall. Cas sits on a settee that looks like it should be in the office of some psychoanalyst. He’s sure a psychoanalyst would have a lot to say about
This roleplay isn’t even all that novel. It’s tame, really, definitely not wild like the god-mortal roleplay they did. But he’s had it in his mind for years, and it’ll never come to fruition otherwise—because it’s sexual harassment, of course, but also, bedding his 68-year-old assistant who’s like his mom? No.
“You smell incredible, my omega,” Cas purrs.
Kicking his arms and legs, Matthew giggles.
Sam knows the source powering that megawatt smile that looks like a floodlight in a mine, though, which is comforting, given that otherwise he’d think his brother is possessed.
Dean is deeply, genuinely happy, a happiness Sam’s never seen and one that has nothing to do with him.
be sorry about is faking your orgasms, you big liar.” It’s the only part of their roleplay that bothers him. He hadn’t allowed himself to think about it much, because it hurt when he figured it out, but now that he is, it hurts even more. Why didn’t Cas want to come with him, inside him? He did before, with the boss/assistant thing. Did he disappoint him somehow? Was he too selfish? Or maybe the roleplay was too weird for him and he didn’t want to say anything.
Dean flashes him a dour look. Cas grins, and the look melts away.
“Ooh, good one.”
a great thing. Seemed like the young, ambitious upstart was shaking things up as the new God. Maybe he was taking a hands-off approach on Earth, but rewarding humans when all their soul-searching and hard living was done seemed like a fair trade. Pride swelled in Dean’s chest. “Jack did all that?”
having you as a boyfriend. Maybe he needs to really feel it, you know? And you can show him with this whole dating thing you guys are gonna do.”
“Why not?”
“I know it could be,” Dean insists, backing up just enough so they can look each other in the eyes. Dean cradles his face. “Give us a chance, Cas. Give us a chance to have a real shot at this. Please?”
Cas smiles. “Hello, Stranger. Or rather, hello, Dean.”
“And why do I love you?” He coats Dean’s cock with lube he must’ve grabbed at some point, then hovers his ass over it.
“Too soon, Dean.”
Cas wouldn’t be interested in a guy like Dean—hell, despite how obvious the video was, it didn’t even enter Cas’ mind that Dean was addressing him, that’s how far out of Cas’ league he is.
“Cute names!”
But none of it feels like a good time.
He didn’t add
Dean nods in realization, like he forgot he could choose. “I’m gonna go. I imagine he wants to take my head off in person.”
...baby.”
“Cool. Hey buddy!” Dean greets Matthew, kneeling on the floor next to him. “I like your toys. Look! It’s a bear! Rrr! And a fox! Ha-ha-ha! And a butterfly! Uh, flutter-flutter? I don’t know; they don’t say anything. And a moose! Uh...what do those sound like, Cas?”
“A morning without coffee is definitely punishment.” He’s still grinning, so he can’t be very upset about it. He takes Castiel’s plate too and sets them on the table, then goes back for their mugs of tea.
Dean is so angry he could spit nails—which he plans to do, right in Lee’s conniving face. But right now, he has bigger things to deal with. He sinks to the floor beside his best friend. “Look at me.”
Dean presses them into Cas’ chest, his heart beating erratically when Cas’ hands wrap around his to accept them. He already adored his dragon friend, but now, looking at his very human friend...Dean gulps. “Um, if it pleases you, may we defeat your uncle tomorrow? I believe we could all use the rest, and dare I say, you might want to sleep in a bed, Cas?”
Maybe Dean didn’t feel like he could talk to him about it because he’s so damn pathetic and transparent? Maybe that was the whole
An odd silence that isn’t drowned out by the music descends upon them. Dean scrapes the pepper into the bowl, then picks up an onion and begins peeling. Garth follows suit, finishing the tomatoes and rinsing the cutting board before he starts on the cucumbers.
“Of course you did.”
Ahhhhhhhhhh! Finally! 😂😂😂 Thanks for sticking with these two lovesick fools, lol!
“Yeah, but fuck that, you cooked. We’ll eat this tomorrow,” Cas says as he brushes past, his hand briefly alighting on his arm.
“You’re a charming one, alpha,” Dean grins, relieved.
“Yes. My sexual desires...they are unquenchable. Only you have the power to save me from myself.” Cas—Callum—meets Dean’s gaze, then slides his eyes up and down his body before settling on his face once again. Lust glitters in them; he bites his lip and moans breathily as he slips a hand under his toga. He gulps. “Please. My desire. It’s building, and I have no hope but you.”
Dark, impatient eyes turn toward him. “What is it that can’t wait five minutes, Dean?”
“Dean Winchester, I swear to God!”
“Cal? That short for something?”
Cas pauses for dramatic effect, then says, “Well, damn, I was hoping you wouldn’t guess that.”
“The fuck, Dean? I think you know me well enough to know I don’t want that.”
“Fuck, how high can I go, sir?” he gasps.
“Yes. That’s what the vet said, and it fits him, for the most part. I'm actually a little surprised he came here because Russians can be rather skittish about noise, but I live nearby, too, so perhaps he's just used to the noise of the sirens.”
Dean hadn’t thought about it like that before, but he’s absolutely right.
Dean rubs the heel of his hand into his forehead.
Dean turns, eager to make a hasty exit, but turns back just as quickly to say, “Oh, uh, that woman you met at the game earlier. Sarah. She’s a sweetheart.”
“Why weren’t you there?”
At least until Vaughn leaves.
Cas’ eyes widen when he sees the scene before him. “What is this?” he asks, delighted.
got to be happy. But me? Not even close. Guess Chuck got what he wanted after all.”
“That’s not an excuse. I was busy, too, as was Dean.”
“Plans. Come on, Novak, move your perky ass. I’m starving.”
“I wasn’t sure how it was gonna go, but
Dean groans. “Shit, people are here for game night. I gotta get the door.”
Both women tip their heads at the off-topic question, but recover quickly.
Cas watched Dean walk this morning. He was dropping something from his pockets, something the birds clearly liked, if the line of them following him was any indication. He takes the same way Dean did and spies what looks like a sunflower seed the birds missed. Cas scooches down and fingers it, smiling. His interactions with the man so far wouldn’t have told him this, but apparently, he has a soft spot for animals, or for the seagulls, anyway. Most people ignore them or try to scare them off, but not Dean. He even gives them the right sort of food, seeds instead of bread.
“I want,” Cas whispers, unzipping his pants and Dean’s. He takes out their cocks and jacks them off together.
Sitting in the backyard with a beer after dinner, fully relaxed and almost having forgotten the toy, he’s made to jump, quite literally, as the toy rockets to its highest speed, the speed his body knows and
Dean nods.
“Meh.”
He heads for the bathroom, only for Vaughn to sweep by him and slam the door shut, locking it behind him.
“Oh, shit, am I supposed to follow you? I think I'm supposed to follow you,” he rambles, remembering something he read on the internet about following service dogs if they’re alone. He tries, “What, buddy? Where?”

Castiel glances at Dean, who’s now making Italians while he entertains Matthew by singing and pushing his stroller back and forth with his foot. He looks like he’s in a circus act, which is exactly how their lives have felt lately. “Yeah, probably,” he acknowledges. He doesn’t bother correcting the
“A long time.”
“Why do you want to take him out to dinner? Sounds like a date.”
“Yeah. Very much.” He traces the line of Dean’s jaw with a fingertip. “I’m sorry I jumped to conclusions instead of talking to you.”
something.
. His entire face is rapidly turning to ash, he just knows it. He casts his eyes to the floor.
Cas sighs. “Yeah. When I look back, we didn’t have much in common. Nothing, really. Nothing that mattered.”
for all that damage you caused, and you don’t get to squirm out of it by working here. He needs cash money, honey.”
He kisses Cas’ damp hair, then takes his hand. They take one last walk, peeking in each room and reminiscing. They wipe their tears as they smile and laugh. Finally, they find themselves at the door.
Cas slowly breaches Dean, holding steady until Dean tells him to keep going. When he’s buried deep in his best friend’s—his boyfriend’s—body, he kisses love and encouragement into his skin. Dean giggles breathily. Cas understands the feeling.
She growls at the nickname, as he knew she would. “You’re lucky you’re cute.”
They met like the surf met the sand, crashing and then melting into each other. Dean crowded him, needing to be closer,
But he’ll remember all the good things, the important things, of these four years. The friends he made. The lessons he learned. Dean.
He doesn’t even think about it as he cups Cas’ jaw. “I’ll always be good to you,” he murmurs. Cas swallows and stares. Dean holds his gaze, not even daring to blink. They drift closer, as they always do when they’re together, though now there’s a wobbly tension there. Maybe Cas is acting, but Dean feels the difference of this moment, the unguarded hopefulness of it, and as he steps forward, he wonders if this will be the turning point, if this is when they—
Dean’s pulse races as they stare at each other. Cas seems surprised, maybe because he actually did it or maybe because of how easily he did it. It surprises him, too. A little. And turns him on a lot. His best friend’s commanding voice
“Fuck yeah. But on the bed, that way I can finger you at the same time. You

“You’re just mad, drama queen,” she says with a dismissive wave. She leans on the treat counter. Stevie, behind her, is placing chocolate-dipped pretzel sticks in a container for display.
mate, never mind a true mate, despite Grammy’s absolute confidence that he would.
“It is in this story. Besides, you love music in your stories. Now, dance with me, sweetheart.”
That’s what they were calling it.
Charlie smirks. “Mmm. Okay, different interests?”
“The best.” Cas plants a kiss to his cheek. “But we should get back. I like it better when you can breathe.”
“Yes. I’m clean, too.”
And speaking of, let’s have a taste of plain vanilla, shall we?
Romance and a rumble.
“What d’you mean?”
It’s the last thing they say before they lunge for each other, pushing off coats and stumbling over hastily-removed shoes as their mouths meet. “We should make it...realistic…” Cas pants.
“Oh yes, I certainly do. I used to do this with Michael all the time, and once he figured out I was on to him, he cut the shit. But, like I said, we’re going to have to be subtle. Play dumb, as it were. Now, I get his game, but I don’t know how committed he is to it or how far we’ll have to push. So, we’re going to need a series of trials.”
“No, he wouldn’t.” Dean shakes his head. “Okay, so...what do we wanna do?”
“I noticed. It seemed so sudden.”
Dean’s eyes flick to the placard, then to Cas. “Morning, Mr. Newman,” Dean purrs. “Brought your coffee.”
“Huh?”
Dean still relies on Gabriel as his go-between sometimes, but not as much. Apparently Cas was getting suspicious of Gabriel being around so often, as his usual managerial style is “do what you gotta do to make me the money, as long as I don’t have to be there” and his excuse of “I’m trying to do better” wasn’t believable when all he did was distract the staff and eat, so Gabriel had to back off some. The employees know Dean now, though, so they help. Sam helps sometimes, too, to keep the air of secrecy, and he and Gabriel will coordinate (and talk about the endless dumbassery of their brothers).
“It’ll be fine. We’re just friends, Sammy.”
Translations:
By the end of the day, he feels better. He works with a great group of people, and they had an awesome time despite it being a work day (pre-holiday potlucks are the
“A sand dollar.”
“You are
“Pfft. Okay.”
Dean gapes at him.
“A step to freedom,” Castiel counters, straightening. “But even before that, you saved my life. You befriended me, despite my fearsome form, and that saved me even more than that step did. I know you have an idea of what loneliness is like.”
Jack makes a playful sour face at him.
“I am not, you brat,” Dean says, voice stern but smirk giving him away. He links his fingers with Cas.’
. You are my alpha. I am your omega.”
He did neither, closing his eyes and tilting Cas’ forehead to his until they touched. “No more stupid decisions,” Dean pleaded.
Dean has never made love to Cas. Yes, they’ve had many sexual encounters. Yes, he’s had his cock in him. But really, truly made slow, gentle love, when he penetrated him with feelings and not just body parts, when he showed him just how incredible he is...he hasn’t. Not like this.
Dean told him that he’s hardly been on his official social media accounts since the uproar at the store and Castiel’s response to it, only going on to thank people for their support. Now, he logs in and uploads one of the pictures, along with a caption:
“You don’t have to be an asshole.”
Harry and Jilly peer around Dean and Cas. “Two of everything?” Jilly asks.
Cas shrugs again, all innocence. “Well, he’d have to eat to build his strength back up.”
But he’s alive.
Dean’s mind flips back to Christmas, when Sam warned him that it would get to this:
Dean sighs, his physical and emotional weight transferred to Cas’ embrace. Cas holds him, rubbing his back soothingly.
Cas hurriedly lifts himself off Dean’s cock. Dean winces on Cas’ behalf. That had to hurt. He watches in confusion and concern as Cas drops to the floor.
“...can’t believe this!”
Claire makes a disgusted face while Cas turns his back to everyone and rubs one hand in his hair and the other along his ribs as if he’s making out with someone. Everyone is in stitches—Dean most of all, tears streaming down his cheeks as he wheezes and slaps his thigh—and it takes Jack yelling “We have to finish reading!” for them to calm down.
Cas’ teasing tone softens to fondness. “Because I know you.”
Cas is on one knee, holding a ring out to him. “
“I’m happy my eyes are still functioning after seeing that.”
Cas turns his face away. “Because there might be a time when I have to be accommodated, when I have to be demanding. I don’t want to use up my tickets.”
“I still think we should do my idea,” Claire says.
Dean warms at the comment. “I wouldn’t think that, not about you. So, what would you say I look like?”
They dry off and head to the bedroom together. Cas looks at his options—he doesn’t want to put on the nice clothes, but he doesn’t want to wear just boxers, either. So, as Cal, he does what any spouse might do if they’re so inclined and the clothes fit—he raids his husband’s drawers. “I’m wearing your pants,” he says, pulling Dean’s favorite pair of thin, black lounge pants out.
“How do you know I’m smiling?”
Dean chuckles. “I feel like I’d have to be fitter to do that one with you.”
Cas frowns. He’s not sure whether they can dictate that, legally. He reminds himself to check on that.
“I asked her not to. I wanted things to happen naturally between us, in our own time, each of us. She was funny, though, Cas. I thought maybe it would be awkward, but it totally wasn’t.”
Cas nods, his nerves jangled. He thought Lee was being untruthful, but it sounds like maybe he was telling the truth if Dean wants to hide whatever they were arguing about. He’s beginning to feel a little sick. He takes a deep breath and says, “Well, if you want to talk about it, you know I’m here to listen. No matter what.”
That night, Sam is washing dishes while Dean sits at their kitchen table. He watches as Dean chews on his lip and taps his pen—
didn’t you tell me?”
“I know,” he replies, though by his soft, uncertain tone, he doesn’t.
With a breathy chuckle, Dean answers, “Yeah, Cas. I’d love to do that.”
we’d be watching a movie or something by now!” He leans down to pick up the napkins.
If this doesn’t work, Dean thinks, they don’t have any other good options. Housing near campus is full, and he has too much shit to do on campus to make commuting from farther away viable. He
“You okay?” Sam asked.
Dean smiles and plants a kiss onto his mouth, then pulls him off the bed.
Cas stares at him, unblinking.
“That’s because Gabriel likes to unzip his pants,” Cas interjects as he spoons the squash into the bowl next to him. Kali and Dean’s mom, whipping the gravy, chuckle, while Gabe blows a raspberry toward Cas.
competitive.”
Perfect.
“I don’t know if you’re Dean or an intruder, but either way, thanks for making my place smell so good.”
And after thinking about it for a while, wanting to do just the right thing, the thing that fits perfectly for them, the thing Cas will never forget because he deserves something special and unique, he finally figures out how he’s going to tell Cas he’s in love with him.
“Or babies,” Cas volleys as Jess rubs her very pregnant belly.
“What do I do?”
Dean sees him snatch the king from the horse, allowing it to escape. The king hacks at Castiel with a sword, which will do nothing to him but still has Dean seething. Castiel releases the little man from his talons. His uncle continues to attack Castiel. It’s laughable and utterly foolish. Moments later, a flame shoots toward the ground. Dean’s guessing that’s the end of the king.
Castiel huffed, amused and fond, as Dean began telling him anecdotes about the living situation of people in the nineteenth century. History had been his minor, and he was the nerdiest history nerd Castiel had ever met, and that included himself. Gradually, he heard the tension in Dean’s voice dissipate, the old warmth and ease that Castiel loved returning. It angered Castiel that Dean was losing so much of himself at Sandover, but he’d tried to discuss it with Dean before, with poor results and no changes, so Castiel didn’t bother to bring it up again. Instead, he listened and joked and reminisced with him until the corporate mask Dean wore fell away completely, leaving only his kind, funny, loving best friend. Castiel fell asleep long after Dean, his wakeful hours spent roving over his serene features in the moonlight filtering through the window and thinking of a better tomorrow.
“About what I just said? What do you think?”
“Not even outside? Asha’s grammy is at a place for old people and they talk to her through the window. And Uncle Sam has brought you food on his way to work. Please?”
Excitement shining in her eyes, she runs to him. “I heard our song! Did you watch what we made?”
“And I need your consent for that.”
He tries not to think about it as he starts reading:
“He sure as hell did!”
Cas needs no light to know Dean is blushing from his head to his toes. It’s all in the deer-in-the-headlights expression he’s wearing. He laughs, then Dean laughs, and they spend the next hour together eating breakfast and staring much too much.
“I dunno, just bored. Everyone’s just...meh.” He shrugs as he pounds back the remainder of his beer, then belches.
A few minutes later, he’s not disappointed. Dean knocks, and when Cas tells him to come in, he sees that Dean is wearing glasses and has another button undone. He's never seen Dean in glasses, and the look is...
, he thinks as the cramps overwhelm him again. He clutches his stomach and his head, feeling woozy.
“Want that too, alpha,” Dean rasps. Cas is
Castiel isn’t sure what to make of the fact that Dean thought he should come by to check on him. “Well, thank you. Like I said, though, you already put in your hours.”
“You keep making friends. Friends who are more your type than me.”
Now Dean is the one shrugging and folding his arms. “Heard you. Wanted to make sure you were okay.”
“Don’t matter. Fuck, that man can cook.”
Cas has their days packed with activities. He skips out on other horse-related exploits for himself, but cheers Dean on when he participates in the team penning and sorting activities with other guests of the ranch. Dean manages to get six of them where they’re supposed to be, which he figures is pretty good considering it’s his first time.
“Well, still. I feel bad.”
The wedding in their yard is simple and beautiful, a joyous celebration, and the final adoption hearing a week later is just as celebrated and joyous. Life continues as before, except it’s a little extra now.
“You must be very excited to leave today,” Steven addresses the newlyweds when the antics between the brothers have died down.
He pushes his bland chicken and steamed broccoli away, no longer in the mood to eat. “He’s so bummed,” Dean moans quietly. “He’s doing fine physically, making progress, but he’s so mopey. He wouldn’t be feeling this way if this hadn’t happened, and this wouldn’t have happened if I’d found a new place first, or if I’d gone in to keep an eye on him or insisted he take Zepp or use his cane ‘cause the house is still new to him—”
Gabe heroically suppresses an eye roll.
“Yeah, let’s.”
“No,” Dean assures him, resting a hand on Cas’ knee, then overthinking it and moving it to his arm. “I—I don’t. You know, maybe we’re just tired. We did a longer roleplay than usual…”
Cas goes rigid and shouts as his cock explodes, come coating his hand and belly.
“I’ve noticed.”
After they eat, Dean announces that they all “need to get out of Cas’ hair.” The men clean up, then say their goodbyes. Gabe tells him that he thought having Sam over tonight would be “a start, since it’s hard for you to meet up right now,” and Castiel tells him he’ll try to figure something out. Sam tells him it’s nice to meet him and that his house is just fine when Castiel apologizes for it. Dean lingers briefly after they’re gone, reminding Castiel to call or text him if he needs “anything at all” and to let him know if he’ll be working tomorrow. Castiel promises to do so.
“Oh.” He sniffs, trying to keep his nose from leaking, which causes a coughing fit.
Cas and the others laugh. Dean blushes furiously.
“Nothing.”
Hanging out with Dean on Sunday night felt good, as it always does. But it also felt lacking.
“Swear.”
“That was a hell of a pause. Don’t want me around?”
Knitted brows join the frown, making him twice as adorable. “Why not?”
“Then I’ll give you a ride. No big deal.”
Castiel slumps against the metal food prep counter. “Fuck you,” he mutters, not liking the man’s sick sense of humor at his expense.
Castiel doesn’t comment on that. He knows plenty of locals who do, but his own coat is from Wal-Mart. L.L. Bean’s products are too expensive for his wallet (though he did buy Matthew’s bunting there because he wanted him to have the best). “Their store is under an hour from here. There are lots of shops in Freeport. You could make a day of it.”
, and it wasn’t, uh, interactive, exactly. It was sort of...well,
He nods.
“That’s...that’s good. So Gabriel, and your friend Benjamin—”
He prayed they didn’t let him down.
He stares at her. “Son of a bitch.”
He rolls his eyes and doesn’t answer, which is answer enough, he supposes.
They walk hand-in-hand to the arbor, lit by the setting sun.
“Dean...”
“We’re gonna annoy the hell out of him until he moves out.”
Cas shoots him a fond, exasperated look. “You’ve been friends a long time. You should at least talk to him, get his side, find out why he did what he did.
Dean nods. He berates himself for being a fucking coward and making Cas do all the talking, but he can barely breathe, let alone talk.
“How are you doing?”
“Right? And this is dumb, but it…” Dean directs his gaze away from him and his brother. “It brings me joy, you know?”
“Alpha,
Castiel giggles. “I love making you speechless.”
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle. “Yeah, a few. I’ll catch you up in the car, okay? And I’ll fill you in on all the stuff I said to you while you were on the other side, ‘cause I want you to hear it. But first…” He slid a hand against Cas’ jaw and asked permission with his eyes. Cas granted it by leaning in. Neither was breathing as their lips touched, then sealed together.
Cas kneels on one knee before him and leans in to make his point. He’s missing his calling, pursuing a history degree instead of a law degree, because if he was a juror, Cas would definitely be winning him over. “They’re all self-absorbed, narcissistic bullies who think the world should bend down and kiss their asses. Well, guess what? I lived with that. So did you. And we know what works, Dean.” He drops his other knee, his body now hovering over Dean’s outstretched legs, hands on either side of Dean’s hips. “Standing up. Not pandering to their whims. Beating them at their own game.”
“Have parental rights and responsibilities.”
“No. Maybe we’ll have to be married contortionists next time. That’ll up the complication factor.”
Cas’ mouth and eyes widened. “I didn’t know.”
“Yup.”
“—are important to the world, man,” Dean interrupts the speech Cas was about to give. “If we didn’t have bees, we couldn’t eat. True story.”
this time.”
Dean is quiet, observing Castiel at the register as he waits on three more customers. When there’s a lull in the line, Castiel turns toward him, a reluctant but necessary apology on his lips. “About earlier—”
“For...pride? Dean and I are bisexual. Did you not know that? Is that a problem?”
“Sure, which ones?”
“Yeah, that’s right, you’d better run,” Dean mutters under his breath, squinting as he watches him disappear.
“Do you? Huh, and here I thought all Dan the Hot Pizza Man wanted was to get off.”
Their family and friends light their way with sparklers, showering them with good wishes and love. Tonight, they’ll spend their first night as husbands in a hotel by the airport. Tomorrow, they’ll board a flight to Costa Rica to start their adventure honeymoon, complete with ziplines, surfing lessons, and something called “canyoning” that makes Dean glad they’ve both gotten lots of rock climbing practice. After that, they’ll start their married lives in their brand new home, and in a couple of months, Cas will be by his side as he and Benny open their new restaurant.
, Dean smiles to himself. He knows Cas doesn’t even realize it, and he’s pretty sure Cas wasn’t saying it as part of the act. It flowed too easily, was too full of emotion. Maybe their friends are on to something. Maybe Cas really does feel more.
Shrugging, he admits, “Yes, but if it meant I could talk to you, I would’ve conveniently ignored that.”
The look on Cas’ face tells Dean he’s definitely overreacting right now. “Nothing, nothing, just don’t wanna be late. Can we go?”
“Yes, sir.”
. Dean, I wanted you to live a long life. To enjoy your freedom. To live somewhere with windows. To find someone special, fall in love, start a family if you wanted one. And to know that you died on a stupid hunt...I was angry, too. Sad. I wanted you out of that life.”
“He came to Lupine Cove with his family for a week’s vacation when he was twenty-two. He met my mother, was ‘instantly smitten,’ he says, and never left.”
“You almost made it out of here,” Anna reminds him. “With Zee.” She seems to realize her faux pas, because she grimaces and tries to recover. “Of course, your ex was an ass, so no big loss.”
not theirs.”
It’s his first thought when he wakes up.
“Well—”
The kids switch again, and Jack pretends he’s a toddler reaching for him and calling him Daddio, and that makes Dean want to cry, too. They’re growing so fast.
Cas stands in front of the lecture hall and glances around as Dr. Alvarez introduces him. He catches Dean laughing with the woman next to him, who’d been staring at him earlier. It’s not the first time he’s caught a student looking at him that way. It’s cute and sweet, but that’s all it is to him and all he’s ever thought. He’d never take advantage of his students, for one, and for two, he’s always had eyes for Dean, anyway. He tosses a smile their way as the audience applauds, then begins speaking about his latest research, Carmen assisting him when he’s not certain of a translation.
Dean called Cas after his buddy Leo, a fellow history buff and a designer showcasing at Paris Fashion Week, practically begged him to stay for a few days to see some of France’s historical attractions, especially once he found out that Dean had never taken the time to go on his previous visits. Leo didn’t want to be by himself, and Dean felt bad saying no because he was a sucker like that. He was sort of hoping Cas would say no for him, but that didn’t happen. In fact, he was very encouraging, practically insisting, and though it should’ve felt good, it didn’t.
At their staff meeting, the video is a smashing success.
Ah, a simple high school AU. He doesn’t usually read high school, and KilliansHusband doesn’t usually write high school, but this one was a gift, apparently. It’s soft and sweet and reminds him of simpler times. Not that high school was simple, but his relationship with Cas was. Mostly. He didn’t realize his feelings for his friend weren’t strictly platonic until their senior year of college (didn’t even realize he was bisexual until his junior year of college). As he reads, he thinks back to all of those crazy times he and Cas spent together. Like the friends in this story, they were very close. Unlike these guys, though, they never thought about petitioning to be class couple. The conservative area where they used to live wouldn’t have tolerated that. He sort of wishes he’d found fanfic sooner. Maybe he would’ve come out sooner, realizing that he wasn’t some sort of freak.
Dean runs into the house, Cas on his tail.
Six pairs of eyes roll at once. “Yes,” Harry sighs. “Dean, Castiel, congratulations again.”
“Well, I don’t believe it, and the people who know you don’t believe it, either.”
“Cas.”
“In a submarine, hon?” Sam says, exasperated.
“You fuckin’ crack me up.” Dean, still smiling, laid his hand on Castiel’s nape.
Despite Cas’ freakout, he believes him. “Okay. Then you’ll believe me when I say everything he told you is a lie?
“Life’s treatin’ me real good, man.”
With a smile and a “Take care, then,” Dean disappears into the storm.
Dean leads Cas to the slow cooker and hands him the masher, which he takes with a contented smile. Dean hopes it’s because Cas is happy to be here, part of this holiday tradition. Dean knows he’s happy that Cas is here. “I’ll be to your right, carving the turkey,” he tells him before giving Cas’ arm an affectionate pat and picking up his carving implements.
“Fuck your fist. Number?”
“I like sleeping in, too. Mornings in bed are some of my favorites.”
“And you don’t have to be a mope.”
“Is that so?”
“You’re welcome. I have a movie ready to go.”
Link to “I Really Like You,” by Carly Rae Jepsen:
They kiss again.
Castiel straightens them once more, then the spoon rest, which Dean has set cockeyed.
Claire confuses him sometimes, so he ignores her comment. “Can we just make Daddio a sign or something? I’m bored.”
Dean frowns but releases him.
“Hmm?”
A hopeful spark makes Dean’s face glow. “Really?”
They stood and brushed the dirt off their clothes, then staggered to the car, where they found...oh, right. The kids they rescued.
“Though we can always circle back.” Dean squirms, then shoots a little glance at his seat over his shoulder.
Cas sighs and collects the papers, clips them together, and tucks them neatly in his bag, which he places by the door. “Dean, honestly,” he says with a pointed look when he returns.
“I know.” He turns his head slightly, just enough for his lips to brush against Dean’s cheek. “Thank you,” he whispers. Then, with a squeeze, he lets him go.
Oh, my friends! I can't believe another one has ended. Heartfelt stuff at the end, as well as what I'm working on next. ❤️
“What are you doing here?”
“Yeah?”
“Hold up, wait, what—”
Harry waves his hand. “Eh, you know, like we said. It was the right thing to do. You boys have been great tenants. We’re happy to have you. Nice to see that you boys are happy together, too.”
So last night was a bust. Turns out Cas had felt uncomfortable almost from the get-go. Dean felt awful that he didn’t know, but Cas told him he wasn’t a mind-reader and not to worry about it.
They talked while waiting for their meals. It was nice, being with Dean, having his smile and his attention directed his way. Maybe it was selfish, but Dean’s attention was something he treasured, and it was in short supply lately. He was so driven, so...preoccupied. His eyes still flicked to his phone quite a bit, buzzing nearly constantly with notifications, but he resisted picking it up, at least. Castiel wondered if this would be a good time to talk to Dean about his feelings.
She laughs. “I think we can help with that.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “We’ll see. If you don’t, hopefully the sex will make up for it.”
“Yeah.” He leans forward and squints at her as he asks, “You okay, though? Happy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas clears his throat. “Yeah. Anyway, tomorrow’s roleplay. Or Sunday’s. When do you want to—”
Looking rightfully chastised for a moment, Dean rallies back with, “Says common sense.”
Dean snorts, kissing Cas again as he serves himself the hearty stew. They move into the living room, where Cas has a couple of cold brews and a basket of warm popovers on the coffee table. “You keep feedin’ me like this and I’m not gonna fit into my pants anymore.”
Sam pursed his lips and nodded. “Yeah, you do, Dean.”
, Cas.”
. The men—well, technically, an angel (Ryder, who got his only-used-in-fic last name from his vessel and his first from a moving van, his angelic name unpronounceable) and a self-proclaimed “time cowboy” (Killian, a reckless human with a tarnished reputation but a “bright soul,” per his angelic friend)—along with Killian’s brother, Cameron, are on a mission to fix the past in order to make the future that is supposed to happen (as told to Ryder by Carwyn, the Lifeforce). The angel and the cowboy are also completely, absolutely in love. They just don’t know it—although the thousands of people who read Ryllian (Ryder and Killian) fanfic about them certainly do. Dean is one of them. He usually reads AU fics, where the characters are put into different situations outside of the TV show. This one he’s reading now is based on canon, though divergent. It’s just a one-shot, in which Killian tells Ryder he will never have to be alone, even in death, because Killian will find him no matter what. Because of course he will. Killian’s so in love with Ryder, it’s heartbreaking.
They talk about what that means for her, including what to call Cas on non-class time, how she’s not going to be treated differently by him at school, how to keep their relationship private, how they need some grown-up time without interruption, and how to talk to either of them if something is bothering her or she has questions.
: The plot is mentioned as one of Cas’ fics; naughty cookies; weekly video game showdowns; scarf used as a tie for “a little light bondage”; kiss between the brows; comeplay; Charlie is a baker
“I’ll give you that. And lobster ice cream is served by maybe two places in Bar Harbor and only tourists buy it because real Mainers know it’s an abomination.”
“Yeah.” Dean turns to look at Castiel, then back at his uncle. “I want to be involved. I have tons of ideas.”
“I didn’t realize you paid attention to us and our plans,” Cas says, calm as can be, “but no. We’re going to stay home and hang out together.”
Cas raises a brow that does all sorts of things to Dean’s libido. “Baby, I’m a five-course meal.”
“Knick-knacks?” Cas raises an imperious brow. “
“We can go do something you wanna do.”
Father’s Day is always a special day at the Novak/Winchester house. The kids are sweet (when they’re not fighting), lunch is delicious (as long as the kids aren’t fighting so they can actually eat it), and Dean and Cas always try to outdo each other with the best sexual favor (if they’re not exhausted from the kids fighting).
“We sort of have that figured out.” They’d decided to keep it simple: sweetheart, honey, and babe. They’d had a great time grossing out Vaughn by sitting on the loveseat and talking about the most ridiculous names they could think of (“Now that we’re dating, can I call you stud muffin?” “Only if I can call you my little apple turnover...emphasis on
“Smells good. What are we having?”
—but Dean hardly notices. It’s just having Cas here,
“All right, you’ve left me no option now,” Cas growls, disregarding the cookies he knocks over as he straddles Dean’s lap. “Death by tickling!”
“Come on. You’re exhausted and he’s sound asleep.”
Dean’s so hard, he could count the change in his pocket with his dick.
“Why didn’t you tell me about the weekend you planned?”
“You heard me. Go home.”
“We got yours first, Castiel,” Jilly continues the story. “What you said was happening was truly upsetting, but you were so kind and sensitive and just wanted to make things right as peaceably as possible, and I appreciate that. Meanwhile, Dean, you were a pistol, spouting off about lawyers and such.”
, dude? Shit, go burn your books and stick your hands in the fire!”
“You know,” Garth says, “there’s a lot of folks here from the farmers’ market. If you think you’re gonna run into people who know you from there, you might want to act like a couple. At least until we leave.”
“There’s another smell in here,” Cas observes later as they polish off the stew and baguettes. “Like...pine.”
“Nah. I’ve got the songs downloaded already.”
“I love you.”
Cas takes him by the hand and they walk to El Jinete sin Cabeza, a tiny restaurant just a few minutes away, where they dine on some of the best food Dean’s ever tasted. “They should open one of these near us,” he enthuses as he scoops up his last bite of dessert after a highly recommended and highly satisfying tuna tartare.
Castiel squinted. “Okay?”
Dean’s eyes light up. “No, what?”
Gabe feels his throat tighten and takes a swig of coffee to deal with it.
“No.”
“Pull what?”
“That’s why we can be grateful that we’re all okay. We’re all here.”
“You’re pretty good at this, Cas,” Benny says.
Cas grinds.
Cas grins at him. “And I’m proud.”
Claire Novak is laughing at a video on TikTok that her parents would find utterly dumb (because they don’t get humor) when Jack barges into her room.
“Oh yeah,” he says, straightening. “Allergies.”
“It wouldn’t be any easier, hon.”
“You know what I mean,” he grumbles, fighting a blush at Dean’s touch.
“You do, hmm?”
Without a thought, Dean does.
“Yeah, sure.”
Cas, who knows him inside and out.
“And about how there are all kinds of families and all kinds of people we love and ways we love them?”
, Zo.”
“How did I—”
“You’re the one who agreed.”
“Nah. I’ve been thinking about it a lot over the past few months, and honestly, I think that lady I saw those few times at the wellness center was right. Those guys were just stand-ins for my biological father—emotionally unavailable losers who couldn’t have a real relationship if their lives depended on it. Maybe I was working out daddy issues, I don't know. I do know I hated losing their friendships, but now I think it wasn’t them in particular I hated losing, just the friendships themselves. I lost two in the friendship tally, you know? Friendships have always been hard for me. Maybe that’s the dad thing, too, or maybe it’s just my introversion. Thankfully, I have some great friends now.” He kisses Dean’s hair. “Anyway, to answer your question again, no, I never fell in love before you. And you?”
as he tells him everything he did, every ingredient he used.
“Then you’ll have to wait like everyone else.”
Dean listened as Cas made a few attempts before he gave up. “It’s really stuck, and I think if I move too much, I’m going to rain hell down on myself. The space I’m in is...small. And getting smaller.”
Rainy days in the middle of the week mean less traffic in the store, even during tourist season. Patience will still be in at 11:00, but right now, it’s 9:30 and pouring outside. The store is dead. Castiel is in the back, opening boxes of sparklers and cheap pairs of colorful sunglasses for Lupine Cove’s annual Spark Summer Festival happening the weekend after next. That and their June festival, Lupine Days, are extremely busy times for Lupine Cove Market and Deli, especially now that they have the ice cream stand. Once he realized how much Dean loved him and was invested in him and the store and the town, Castiel finally relented and admitted that he was glad that Dean had it built.
“Why don’t you come around when they’re refusing to do what you ask, when they’re selfish, when they’re ungrateful, when they blame you for things you can’t control? Come on over and parent them when they’re being awful little humans, when they’re mean and nasty and they hurt your feelings. Come on over and parent them in the bad times, when you wouldn’t want to show them off to
“It’s vacation. Besides, only got one life, right?”
“Good to know,” he chuckles before unceremoniously dragging Dean’s pants and underwear to his ankles. He glances up mischievously, plants his hands back on Dean’s hips, and swallows him down.
didn’t you tell me?”
“You gonna dance for me, handsome?”
When their breathing evens out, they clean up with toilet paper and flush it down, then exit the stall. Two guys at the urinals won’t look at them, but Cas couldn’t care less because he just had incredible bathroom sex with the hottest man in the club. They wash up, then head back into the bar.
They make their way first to the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, or IAC, a major research center and the administrative arm of the Teide Observatory. A local film crew meets them there—Aday, Nauzet, and Dácil. Dácil does Cas’ hair and makeup, and Dean’s, too. Dean isn’t surprised. He figured he’d be on camera. At least he’s prepared this time—he’s wearing nice jeans and a shirt that doesn’t smell like fish, unlike last time he was on camera with Cas. He watches Cas meet and chat with the director and the top researchers at the Institute, and feels bad for them. They don’t know what they’re about to get themselves into.
Cas grins and squeezes Dean’s hip. “I bet. Thank you, honey pie.”
you guys were up to something,” Benny chuckles with a grin as he approaches them. He leans against the table they’re seated at. “How long have you been datin’ behind our backs?”
Dean sits up. “Get out of these clothes,” he urges as he sticks his fingers in his shirt and yanks until it tears.
“I don’t know about that.”
“You’re not in trouble with me.”
Although Dean thought about it many times during and after the accident, his answer was always a resounding…“No. No, it won’t.”
Touched that Dean asked, Castiel cups his jaw and kisses him sweetly. “It’s fine.”
“Try it,” Dean—or rather, his husband Dan—encourages him.
For nearly an hour.
“Back to the shower for me, then. Are we all set here?”
“Come on, you know we do. First of all, Jordan was way too immature for you.”
But it wasn’t home anymore.
“Yes.”
Vaughn shrugs.
“Uhh...yes?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack’s eyes widen. “Uh huh.”
be bold when he wants to be. “Not so quiet now,” he teases.
“Ass,” Dean mutters, but he smiles so brightly and kisses him so deeply that Cas struggles to remember why they haven’t tried, why they
He relents. “The one with his back to the wall
Dean dresses, not wanting to apologize with his pants down. “No, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—”
“That’s kinda broad, babe. Something happen at work?”
On Friday, Castiel takes advantage of the lull before lunch to present Dean with a white envelope.
Cas, of course, was nothing but understanding—in part, sure, because he’s bisexual, too, but mostly just because he’s Cas. Cas had come out the year before him, but he never belittled Dean for taking longer, or not telling him sooner. He just supported him. It helped him as he went through the scary process of coming out to his parents, brother, and friends.
They fought. They won.
“Not even Mikey-boy?”
“Don’t you want time to get ready?”
Dean looked like he was actually considering it when he gritted his teeth and said, “I have to.”
“Not true. You took good care of him. Yeah, he cried some, but, you know, babies do that. And you didn’t lose your cool. I mean, not with him, anyway.” He flashes a cocky grin at the jibe that morphs into something softer. “I thought he was yours. Same dark hair, same attitude. Lot of love between you.”
“Jeez, what a shitty play,” Dean commented to Castiel but loud enough, apparently, for the burly guy at the next table.
“You wouldn’t be,” Felix joins in. “You’d be totally legit. Putting all of your real feelings out there. He’ll catch on eventually, probably, or we can nudge him if he doesn’t, like Bal said. And when he does catch on, he’ll be forced to figure his shit out, ‘cause at the very least, he’s still gonna have to fake date you to get rid of Vaughn, so he won’t be able to just run away and hide from you.”
And the next time Dean’s deep into his ass, it feels perfect. Cas is egging him on, telling him to
-My FicFacers 2020 story (oh yeah, I'm doing FicFacers again this year if you want to check it out!)
“I’m not. Much.” Cas grins, then spreads himself over Dean’s body and nuzzles his nose. “I like romance too, you know. I have all sorts of ideas.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Luc?”
“He’s better at this game than I thought he’d be,” Cas moans on the way home from voting on Tuesday night. “I hoped he’d be broken down by now, but clearly he’s not. Or not enough, anyway.”
“You’re quiet.”
There are all kinds of friends, Dean’s learned. Some are casual, some are close. Some are your work friends, some are your outside-of-work friends. Some are your in-person friends, some are your online friends. Some are your do-hobbies-with friends, some are your do-everything-with friends. Some are short-term friends, some are long-term friends.
“I want this.” Still loose from their previous encounters, he sinks down onto Cas’ cock in one shot, making them both groan. “Fuck, yes.”
. The State would help with the cost, but he has a hard time swallowing his pride and taking their money. And if he’s honest, the bigger issue is that he doesn’t want to be separated from Matthew. He’s so little, and he’ll only have him for so long. Unfortunately, he won’t have much of a choice. He can’t have Matthew in the middle of construction.
“You know,” Ana Jo says when the line clears, “I don’t know why you’re being so stubborn.”
“My door is always open, Dan.”
“Maybe, maybe not,” he grins in return. “So. What now?”
“Nice, huh? And look.” He turned Castiel around by the shoulders.
“Fine, go on, go on,” Bobby interrupts.
A smile slowly stretched across Dean’s face. “Married? Kids?”
“Long story,” Dean mutters.
Cas, in his patient, quiet way, tells him to stop bitching and do his job.
Dean doesn’t live near the water, despite being on an island, but he’s not too far, either. The walk is made quicker by the shortcuts he takes through side streets and the hidden path next to Augusta Novak’s house. Well, Castiel Novak’s house now. He wonders if the path will even be open.
And Dean is done for.
“Of course I have peanut butter fudge today. Told you I would. You think I’m a liar?”
“Scale of one to ten,” Cas coaxes.
His friends’ faces are turned up, identical looks of amused confusion on them all except for Cas’, whose brows are pinched in concern he knows is masking smugness.
Dean drops to his pillow, feeling content and sleepy. He mind wanders to the boring Sunday they have planned, though they’re never really boring, he’s found. When they started the roleplaying, it was because he was bored with sex. What he’s discovered over the years is that he was bored with more than just sex—he was bored with life. He wanted more. And did he ever get more when he got with Cas. He closes his eyes and sighs, smiling.
Cas, picking at a slub in the blanket on the bed, raises his eyes to Dean’s. There’s trust there, understanding and affection there, and how can he ruin that for a roleplay? He drops his gaze again. “I don’t want to punish you.”
Dean raises his eyes to her hopeful, nervous face. “Damn right I do,” he answers, his voice cracking with emotion. He pulls both of his children into a long, tight hug. “And it’s still Daddio,” he insists, to the sniffly giggles of his daughter and the “Well yeah, duh” of his son. He kisses them both on the cheeks, then hugs them again as they both climb into his lap. Distantly he hears people cheering and clapping, and he’s grateful for their support and love, but these two are his world right now.
They passed the time listening to Bob Seger and discussing nothing special, but special because it was between them.
,” Dean replies. He reaches for the lube, then slicks up his fingers and inserts two straightaway.
“Have to be. A small place doesn’t allow for much clutter.”
“The hotel have a fuckin’ bunch of teenagers put this up? Fuck!”
So, of course, Cas keeps it up.
Cas clears his throat. “No, that’ll be all. Perhaps we can touch base later.”
That no one asked him there was technically true. Cas pressed on, though, pushing his feelings down as the desire to prove Lee wrong drove him.
“The hazards of dating and parenting,” Cas says with a shrug, likely seeing Dean’s frustration all over his face. Cas isn’t angry about the interruption, which is a relief, and it makes Dean think that soon, it’ll be time to talk to Bea.
They banter back and forth with playful jabs and barely-there touches until Dean is overwhelmed with love for his grumbly Cas, who always laughs with him and not at him, who only expects Dean to change for his own good, who carries so much love in his heart but masks it with complaining to protect himself. He takes in the way Cas leans toward him, the sparkle in his eyes and the smile stretching his lips, and wonders if he can help Cas find another outlet. Carefully, he leans forward until their noses touch; seeing only anticipation in Cas’ eyes, he closes the gap between their mouths with a soft kiss. Their lips connect over and over, slow and eager, until by silent, mutual agreement they part and gaze at each other.
want to be Winchesters,” Cas reiterates softly, almost hesitantly. “I don’t know how you feel about marriage, so this is probably stupid to do on an already beautiful and emotional day, but I’ve wanted to marry you for years now and I’m hoping you feel the same. So Dean, will you do me the honor—”
like they want to try. Like they want this. Like it could be the best thing that’s ever happened to them.
It stops.
A devilish thought pops into his mind. If Dean wants to be a brat, Castiel can be, too. He lifts Dean’s chin until their eyes meet. “Excuse me, but who’s the boss here?” he asks, voice pitched even lower than his usual dark timbre.
“Jesus.”
“It’s okay. My family does, too. I was just calling to warn ya.”
Dean didn’t hear the rest of their conversation as he stared blankly at the mountain of debris, clenching and unclenching his free hand.
, babe. I’m gonna ask you
He took Cas’ hand as they walked back to Baby, the sun warming their faces, and he took it again as they drove to the Roadhouse.
“Paternal instincts?” Sam scoffs at his partner. “You don’t have a paternal bone in your body.”
“Well, then, I suppose we are two invirtuous souls. We sound perfect for each other.”
, but how—”
. Preferably with your mouth closed. And slow down.” He adds, softer, “The food isn’t going anywhere.”
He stops shoving and covers his eyes with the heels of his hands, pressing firmly to dam the tears. After a moment, he swallows and focuses on his feet again, managing to put on and tie both of his shoes.
“No, Cas, I went there ‘cause it was close, you know?”
That’s another problem. He’s horny
The shower stops. Cas, relieved of his immediate problem, at least, wipes himself with tissues and tucks himself in. He crumples the tissues in his hand and stands. Heading toward the trash can, he stops, smirks, and goes back to the loveseat, dropping the wad of tissues onto the floor, where Vaughn can see it. It’s not a used condom, but it should get the point across. And if Dean asks, well, he’ll tell him what it is and how it got there. Just not who he was thinking of.
