Dean remembers Mary with her bags sneaking out of the house, her glare when he called out to her. Dean looks down, maybe he's the reason everyone leaves.
What is he supposed to do now? He can't make his body move and his breathing has gone ragged and shallow. His hands go clammy and a cold sweat breaks out on his body.
He's hungry. A feeling he's never had to experience before, and thirsty, and suddenly has the need to piss and shit but isn't given the privilege to do so in a proper bathroom so he settles for the corner or on himself.
"Novak." Dean mutters under his breath as he uses his hips to shut the car door. He thumbs at his phone, raising an eyebrow at the peculiar spelling.
"Nothing like that! I'm just a friend." Dean reassures and honestly, couldn't they remember their other colleagues name for once?
Dean curls his toes into the mossy pond bottom and stares at the water droplets cascading down Castiel's chest. What does he do now?
"What? Like a dog?" Gabriel huffs out a disbelieving laugh. "Let's say Naomi did want to," Gabriel waves his hand, demonstrating what Dean said previously. "Why would she do that to us? To Cas? Do you think Anna is in on it too?"
Dean's mind flickers to Castiel and he licks his lips. "I'm not sure yet. I thought I did but, I found something out that might change things between us."
Eve lowers her arms slowly and steps closer to Dean until her feet almost touch his, then looks down at him, murder swimming in her eyes.
"Okay but why? I wanna meet the people important to you, Cas." Dean thumbs underneath Castiel's pectoral, moving the flesh there. It's night, they always have their conversations at night, in Castiel's bed, where there's warmth and blankets.
"Hi! Bonjour! Are you ready to check in?" the receptionist, who appeared out of no where by the way, smiles at him. She has a knowing glint in her eyes. Dean clenches his bag self consciously. There's a kiss of a whisper by his ear. It's starting again.
Dean blinks quickly, his eyes stinging and his chin wobbling. He's grateful he learned how to hide his scent when he was younger.
His hands find Dean's hair and instead of combing his fingers through, Castiel digs his nails in Dean's scalp and fucks back against his tongue while letting out small cries and whimpers.
Dean pats down the bed until he finds the lump of his phone. He hesitates, scared. Acid rests just behind his uvula.
She looks down at him, a sinister smile on her face and the smell of sulfur wafting off her like waves. Her eyes flash a familiar red and she nudges Dean's rib with the tip of her heel causing him to flinch back.
Castiel stays quiet and Dean brushes a finger over the cuff, going nauseous at how fresh the blood is.
inside, so pliant, loose, and wet and Castiel wants so badly to scream. It trembles, shakes like its got the case of the shivers, and pushes more until its hips are flush against Dean's ass. Castiel bends down, buries its face in Dean's neck and lets out broken sobs.
Mary frowns. "Okay. Fine. I'll just say it here then. Is Castiel forcing you into this relationship?"
The show has just started up once again and the two husbands turn their attention to it, well, at least one does.
It's an easy sway that they have going; their feet stumble a little and they both laugh at any mistake they make. The side of Dean's body is cold from the snow flurries flying inside the room but Castiel's body is emitting a warm that makes Dean feel like he's wrapped in a thick blanket. The music is tacky and Dean doesn't really like it but Castiel eyes are shining so that makes up for it.
Dean carefully sets the coffee mug on the table and the Angel follows the movement with his eyes before they snap back to Dean.
"You're so good to me." Dean mumbles in the soft fabric of Castiel's sweater. It smells of coffee, of the warmth from Baby's leather seat, of safety.
Dean shuffles closer to Castiel and rests his head on Castiel's shoulder, sniffling occasionally as his tears die down.
Dean chokes on something between a gasp and a intake a breath as Castiel licks, short swipes of his tongue, around Dean's hole.
Dean jolts, dry heaves, and sobs all at the same time. The lights in his room are flickering and the TV mounted on the wall is glitching so much to the point where it shuts off. Somehow it turns on again. It hurts; his heart, body, his god damn
"Want me to follow with the small stuff?" Dean asks into the fridge. Sam glances at him from the side of his eyes and frowns his eyebrows.
Dean clutches his pillow tighter. They didn't even kiss yet. Dean brings the pillow up to his face and groans.
Dean's eyes well up and he drops the hold he has on Castiel's. He's seen this, he's heard those words spoken on the television. He was so hopeful and stupid and it's
"Maybe I should call you puppy since you want to misbehave." Castiel spreads his fingers and watches as slick dribbles from the opening and soaks into the sheets.
"'S good." Dean mummers, stroking Castiel's hair lovingly. Castiel looks so pretty like this; down on his knees with heated cheeks pressed against the insides of Dean's thighs as he mouths filthy on Dean's underwear.
The grace is only enough to get where Dean is; strapped to some shabby motel bed with Michael hovering over him. All Castiel can see is red.
"So are you plannin' on marryin' Dean-o next?" Garth asks, completely obvious to Castiel choking on his drink with his eyes wide.
"Lying doesn't suit you, Winchester." he says with a kind pat on Dean's knee before rising. "That grace has Castiel written all over it. If you don't—" Lucifer scratches the back of his head awkwardly. "I know people who specialize in nephlim abortions. You don't have to have the baby."
Dean glances down at Miracle. "She doesn't have a uterus, some assholes took it out before leaving her there." underneath her fluff of fur a nasty scar along her underside is only a year fresh and sensitive.
Sam exhales and gives a small smile, knocking to glass pasta sauce containers together. "Yup. All my stuff is packed up in Garth's truck so I can move the rest to Eileen's."
The two glance at each other then at Dean. "Boss isn't letting anyone in, but if you want, you can spend your waiting time with us." Tweedle Dum bounces his shoulder in gesture to his friend beside him and licks his lips with a nasty curl to his lips. Dean fakes a heated flush across his cheeks and wraps his tail around his waist in a submissive, demure movement.
"You don't have to identify as anything. I love your soul, a piece of you that doesn't have a label, can that not apply for the rest of you?"
"You have a body." Dean closes his eyes tightly and curses. "Of course, I didn't think, I mean no Nymph would ever–You left your home." he rushes out. There's a lot of eyes of them, he knows, but Dean wants to stand underneath this downfall a little longer.
It's around six thirty when Castiel finishes making his room acceptable; the provided bed has three layers of blankets, the thinnest, a weighted, and the heaviest on top; the study desk has now turned into a planet desk where various angiosperms and embryophytes take up the tiered space and bask in the sun while the top of his closet has two or three plants that need little to no sunlight. Castiel hopes his aglaonema and aspidistra elatior get along well up there, that evergreen has always been the drama queen of the two. His closet, filled with his many sweaters and sweatshirts, and drawer, which just has his essentials, not that Castiel had many clothes to begin with, which just leaves the TV.
He's sure words are coming out of his mouth, sloppy and partnered with drool, but he's too floaty to focus on them. The feel of Castiel's cock dragging in and out of him, assaulting his prostate has his cock jerking angrily and leaking into his belly button.
"...bitch." he rasps, rubbing at his throat. Naomi rolls tilts her head back, her eyes hooded as she looks down at Dean before she walks around the living room to admire the new artworks strung up on the walls.
Dean chews the inside of his cheek as his brain starts to come back online. "I can like, write shit that people do that I like or that I want them to do?"
Dean backs away to get the key from his nightstand drawer then hands it to Castiel with a grin and puts out his wrists. Castiel eyes Dean up and down the raises his eyebrows. Dean strips down to his birthday suit. He's getting a little déjà vu.
"If it is amenable for you, I would like to court you." Castiel looks determinedly into Dean's eyes and Dean blinks at him.
"Shit! Charlie!" Lucifer collapses to his knees next to the bruised and bleeding redhead and lifts her head up to rest of his forearm. Charlie's eyebrows frown and she groans in pain.
Dean gulps for breath as his body lurches up from the bed. His body hurts with new aches and he puts head in his hands as takes a couple of steadying breathes. The handcuffs glow a little brighter and emit a low humming sound. Suddenly the room is too small and Dean needs a smoke.
He's a crazy person. A literal crazy person who belongs to the loony bin. How can Castiel do that to him? How can he make Dean feel relieved and safe by simply touching him?
"I don't work for him anymore." Dean says, watching one of the skaters fall and everyone around them wince in sympathy. Their nose becomes pink then red as blood begins to slowly drip from their right nostril but they have it off with a smile.
"We good?" Darwin nods before opening the door. Lucifer sucks in a sharp breath and Dean tugs him inside. The door shuts behind them.
"Love you too, love you so much, daddy." Dean's eyes flutter closed as Castiel's hand comes to rest on the middle of Dean's back where it arches. Castiel reclines back against the headboard, a line of saliva trails from his red stained lips to the colouring teeth marks that Castiel left.
"I was hurt for long time." Castiel agrees. "But I think that Andrei really try, he love her in his own way and at end of day, they already married."
a male whispers. Dean doesn't bat an eye but the owl that sits on a tree branch in front of the window does. He wonders when it got there.
Castiel crowds Dean against the wood door, wings open and threatening as he invades Dean's space to scent openly at his neck while rutting against the rough fabric of his jeans.
The conversation plays in his head then rewinds again. Dean brings his hand up to his mating mark where his neck meets shoulder and brushes over the burned skin.
"I change them!" Nordic calls after him, his voice loud and rumbling causing birds to fly from the trees. Dean turns around.
The tendril tightens, stopping Dean's impending orgasm and Castiel tightens their position. His feet drag further into the sheet and his arms have moved so their wrapped around Dean, completely enveloping him. His body is raised in an almost uncomfortable position so he can stare into Dean's hazy eyes. Castiel's thrust don't halter, if anything they piston faster and his cock grows bigger inside of him.
Castiel took a steadying breath before forcing his wings out of the slits on his back. Skin ripping and blood dropping onto the floor sounds the otherwise quiet basement and Castiel's vision swims.
"You smelt uncomfortable so I was worried that you would say no because maybe you did not view me that way."
"Sir, if you would follow me to your room." her lips are curled into a frown and the blue eyes look away. Why does it feel like he missed something?
Dean's appointment doesn't happen until two days later. Those two days make him antsy. On the first day, Charlie, Benny, and even Garth came up at different times to share stories about themselves while Dean listened. Midday, Castiel came up. He gave Dean liquids, things like soup or porridge, and made sure he drank water, all while not speaking. He stays in Dean's room the rest of the day and whenever Dean was watching some soap opera on the television or reading doujinshi that Charlie sent him on his phone, he noticed Castiel staring. It made Dean's chest spasm and his cheeks heat, not that Castiel mentioned it.
Dean reaches over and grasps the small, gold supportive piece. "'M good, Charlie. Naomi's earring back slipped off."
"Excuse me?" Castiel rasps. Garth shrugs and gestures with his beer to Dean, who's dancing with Rowena.
"You really," Lucifer laughs, one filled with pain and bitterness. "It always has to be you and Sam. You'd even let my family die for your bond."
It's dark by the time they cross the state boarder but there's still people out with beer bottles in hand or cigarettes hanging loosely from their chatty lips. Dean can already sense the danger before he sees it.
"And you're a fuckin' dick for not telling me or using your Charles Xavier bullshit to let me know you mated me."
Aaron laughs loudly as his head tips back. "You should go for it. Whatever you found out, if you can still love him after that, then it's worth it. You being happy is worth it. Don't follow your parents if it hurts that bad."
Castiel doesn't get much sleep, not that it matters all too much, his classes don't start until Thursday and it's only Tuesday. Castiel hangs his towel on the back of his bedrooms door and closes his eyes with a deep sigh, finding temporary relief as the burning lessens.
"Were you going to tell me that you've been skipping therapy? Donna says you only go once a week when it's supposed to be twice."
"The things I'll do to you. The screams you'll make, the blood you'll shed." the red around Castiel's eyes swim in with the blue. Dean swallows thickly, the sound clicking in his ears as his fingers twitch against the cushions.
"Dean, honey!" Mary greets, her smile bright. John looks at him and Dean rolls his eyes but greets with a clumsily curtsey.
Dean scrubs down quickly and by the time he gets out of the shower the sky has turned a peaceful midnight black; something that reminds him too much of what his life looks like now. His clothes, to his amusement, are still left on the floor so he kicks them in the direction of the hamper and finds some clothes to wear.
Eve stands up and snaps her fingers; one of her minions come over to them with a quickness and cuts the material binding his wrists.
Castiel looks down at Dean's lap then up again. "The washroom. It's common for clients to get hard, there's no shame if you would like to relieve yourself."
'M—" Dean's back arches and his cock jerks between them before he comes, painting both of their clothes. Castiel growls into Dean's skin and slams harder into the writhing Omega below him.
"Of course. Stand for me?" Castiel lowers Dean's legs into the water then kisses his pouty lips before sitting down, letting the water reach to his midsection. He clasps Dean's hand in his and pulls him forward; a splash of water catches his chest and Dean lets out a surprised yelp as his lower half becomes emerged in the cold water.
Dean's slammed onto the bed as soon as he enters their room. His clothes are manhandled off and Castiel is biting harshly into his skin; the lights that are on are the only way for Dean to see the top of unruly raven hair.
Castiel pins his wrists down to the bed, panting. His eyes wild and flashing a blinding blue. He doesn't care. Dean needs to know that Castiel can't–Father have mercy on his soul–Castiel can't live without this man.
Castiel lifts his hips for Dean to strip him as well, keeping his shirt on much to Dean's disappointment, then scoots up the headboard.
"You're fucking me so deep," Dean's thighs quiver and his cock creates a small puddle of pre on his stomach. "T-tell me what you're thinking."
A cold sweat pools in awkward parts of his body like between his squished thighs, his ass crack, and underneath his balls. His thighs make a sicking, sticky sound when he separates them, and in the distance, somewhere in a hole in his mind, he hears a laugh. It reminds him of
"Bye, Nordic!" Dean waves before turning and walking back home, a weight off his shoulders. His cheeks are flushed pink and his dress is wet and heavy.
"This is stupid." Dean mutters, thumping his head down on his vanity, the paper underneath his forehead crinkling at the tension.
After applying scentless lotion to his body evenly, Dean slides on a simple pair of cotton panties, a boring white pair that he can't find the matching bralette for, before rising from his bed and walking towards his closet and grabbing two, non-formal dresses. He walks to the mirror, holding the sundresses up to his body and switching between the two. The pink compliments his skin nicely but the navy contrasts against his skin and makes him stand out more. Nibbling on his lip, Dean throws the navy one over the mirror's edge before stepping into the pink one.
"Shit, sorry!" Sam reaches and grips Dean's shoulder so he doesn't fall. "Are you okay?" he asks, puppy eyes widened and eyebrows frowned. Dean pats the hand on his shoulder with a tight lipped smile. There's a silence between them, neither breathe until Sam withdraws his hand and nods. He then points to the necklace around Dean's neck.
Dean wants to yell. He doesn't know how he feels, every Alpha he's come into contact with he's killed and now–
Dean curses when Miracle jumps on the couch, nuzzling into one of the many pillows they have stacked on it.
Rubbing his eye with the knuckle of his thumb, Dean leans forward with his elbows on his knees then flips open the folder to find the Novak's number.
"Omega-mine." Castiel sighs, nuzzling at the damp area before laying his tongue flat against the material and lapping at it hungrily. Slick coats the corners of his mouth and the top of his upper lip and Dean's eyes flutter as he sucks in a sharp breath, leaning back and knocking his head back against the wood as he rocks against Castiel's tongue.
Dean blubbers at the mouth, drooling stupidly on the pillow under his face, before sucking in a sharp breath and coughing wetly, "'M hurtin', it
"Bobby and Ellen say they better not catch your ass back there again." Jo grins before it fades and she leans against one of their metal baking tables. "You're headin' up to Mary and John's for the holidays?"
Dean steps forward cautiously, heels muffled on the carpeted floor and Castiel pulls back the drink.
They both start with their socks. Sweat covered and a little muddy from transporting stuff outside to inside.
"T-thank y-y-you, daddy." Dean sniffs, toes curled and body tense. Castiel lowers Dean's hips and kisses up his lover's spine. Both of their cocks are red, angry, and leaking pre-cum on the sheets or in Castiel's case, smearing against Dean's thigh. Castiel turns Dean over once more, wiping away any lingering tears and taking note of the twist of discomfort that takes over Dean's face, he'll have to to put cream on his ass later. Dean's soul shines powerfully with grace that's ready to teeter over the edge and mix with Castiel's own.
A knock on Castiel's door and a few hushed Enochian words let him know that his family is ready for the big dinner. Dean seems to receive the same message when Anna appears at his door dressed in rags with her hair thrown up.
Dean pushes down the front of his sweats, hooking his thumb under the rim of his boxers and pants and push them underneath his balls. His cock, only at half mass, wobbles and leaks against the grey cotton. Dean slouches against his seat, spreads his legs, and wraps a loose fist around his cock.
"Tu n'as aucune idée de ce que tu me fais." Castiel shakes his head, sliding the hand that was resting on Dean's back down lower until two fingers rest on his tailbone.
"Thank you," Dean whispers thickly. His eyes are watery and there's a forming lump in his throat that he can't swallow down. How long has he been rolling through the months? Would he even know it was his birthday if he wasn't here?
Jess is obviously in shock when Colt reveals that Vanessa recently moved in with them then says how him and Vanessa slept together. Colt denies it right off the bat with a nonchalant shake of his head and Jess turns her entire body towards Colt telling him to stop lying.
Dean tries to still his shaking hands as he gently takes the fruit from Castiel's soft hands. "Thank you."
"'S long as you're aware, lucky it was me n' not someone ready to start shit. I'm Dean by the way. Pronouns: he/him."
Castiel drapes the robe over his shoulders and puts his arms kindly through the fluffy sleeves before carefully standing him up. Dean's knees wobble and he hisses sharply, grabbing onto Castiel's shoulders for support as the rope of his robe becomes tied.
"Could you explain your case to me?" Castiel sits down at the desk and guides the bees to the sunflowers sat in a jar on the wood.
"Sorry I'm late! Gabriel baked powdered doughnuts and those things go fast!" a lady with a thick accent, that was definitely not Canadian, walks into the room with a box of doughnuts, she uses her foot to close the door. She opens the box with a smile, "Want one?"
"We reccomend that the cars stay out here if the Omega has been rejected." she informs politely but her eyes shine with humor. Dean's lip quirks up and he nods once before following her.
Castiel tugs Dean's head up by his hair and kisses him fiercely; their teeth knock together and their tongues explore each other's mouths. Castiel removes his fingers from the abused hole before moving their position; Dean on his back, legs wrapped firmly around Castiel's waist, with Castiel's hands either side of his head.
"We only had each other, yes Anna, Gabriel, and Lucifer were there but they weren't like us. We were all we had." Castiel tightens his grip around Dean's waist.
Dean scoffs and rolls his eyes. "It's just another reason why soulmates are bullshit. I mean, why allow the universe to pick your partner? What if their abusive? What if they're a murderer? And if they don't even feel for you, death is just waitin' around the corner."
Castiel looks down between them, sighs, then backs away to tuck his, very hard, very angry, cock back into his dress pants.
"Can't what? Can't get yourself better? You're gonna go back out there? Drink yourself silly, drive until you blackout, not eat, and get into fights until you're beaten black and blue? Until you go to some motel and try to kill yourself again?"
Castiel lips curl downwards in confusion. "I was mainly referred to as my name." then adds, "Sometimes my family would call me it."
Droplets from Dean's eyes fall down onto the paper and Dean rises quickly to open his balcony door and climb over the ledge and lower himself down onto the shed's roof next to him.
Dean rubs at his chest with a slight heat on his cheeks as he walks out his room. Castiel is shuffling through the kitchen drawers while Miracle is in her doggy bed pleasantly knocked out.
Castiel shifts on the dryer, staring down at the rough rolling paper between his fingers. "Sometimes I think about what my clients have to go through and I always think my trauma is lacking in comparison but then my nightmares are filled with my mother hitting me and I think its something to be dismissed and it's not a big deal but I wake up and," Castiel rubs at his face with his free hand. "I wake up and I'm terrified."
Charlie goes to open her mouth but Dean shoots her a look and her jaw clicks shut. After a firm nod, she turns sharply on her heels and begins in the direction of Castiel's room.
Dean worries his bottom lip between his teeth while he walks slowly to Sam's small, preppy little Prius. Castiel is at the trunk, working on the last few bags and trying to gather them all on his arms.
Dean sighs and pulls his hands away. "Drop your pants and spread your legs a little." she orders as she unbuckles her belt and shimmies her pants to the floor and boxers underneath her balls.
"Can we stay?" Dean asks after a second, eyebrows frowned. "I'll still cook tonight, I just, I can't."
Lucifer turns his head to the side and stares at the dry outside. "A few miles past the lake, there should be Blossoms."
Dean whines when another finger joins beside the other. It's been a while since he's done this, especially considering since he only does it when his heat comes.
It's not ideal. Castiel lives to touch Dean, he lives to serve Dean and there's nothing wrong with him anyway. But it's fine, if Dean wants Castiel to do this so they can get back together then he'll do it.
Dean's mind briefly flickers through variations of what Cas' apartment might look like. "Yeah I'm okay with the location change."
"I can assure you I was not 'hoping to seduce some lady'." Castiel quotes, feeling uncomfortable. "I am not attracted to women. My clothes were wet because of the weather and I did not enjoy the texture on my skin. I am deeply sorry if I made you feel that way." Castiel looks down as he zips up and buttons his pants, heart heavy.
"I can't. Blue suits you." Castiel's breath ghosts against his ear gently and a shiver runs down Dean's spine.
"Great, now there's two of you. Charlie, do your job." the blonde gives another kiss to Charlie's cheek before sparing one look at Dean then leaving.
Castiel's movements are hurried; he works the button of his slacks open while running his tongue over Dean's nipples, playing with the swelling nubs until they're puffy and red and Dean's thighs are shaking. Castiel pulls Dean closer to the edge of the bed and nudges his cock against Dean's hole as he continues to blemish Dean's skin in teeth marks.
He's read the 'How to Raise a Dog For Dummies.' over six times but its harder than he imagined. Sure, him and Sammy have had dogs before but he guessed wolves that didn't want to eat them is the more appropriate term. His house is more or less dog proof which basically means all his precious vinyls are tucked between his sheets in his linen closet and his baking tools are stored up high.
Elizabeth acts taken back when her family reveals what they were told and she starts saying stuff about how she didn't know the truth.
Dean lets go of Castiel's nose and grins as Castiel's looks up at Dean. Dean's cock thickens and pulses.
Charlie's a rambler, Dean has come to realize, while Benny mostly hums and comments offhandedly. She asks him questions that boarder on personal but he can't find it in him to deny her any answers.
Dean takes into account the slight throbbing in his head and the subtle ache in his ear and nods. It's maybe a minute or two before a soft lull of classical music plays.
"Perfect! I'm going to get more drinks with Charlie and Lucifer should brief you on any other boring talk that you should know." Gabriel lifts up two glasses then scampers off to the kitchen.
"O-ohh," Dean's bottom lip trembles and his stomach tenses and relaxes as he tries to take it in. "'M full."
Dean lets out a sigh before pulling out and watching as a pool of saliva and cum slide out of Castiel's mouth and onto his neglected cock. Castiel's nose is a rosy red, along with his neck and cheeks, his eyes are shiny with tears, and his lips are ripped and swollen; his legs are spread open wide and his cock is hanging out of his pants looking like it's about ready to burst
"Shit." Dean sucks his teeth, tossing the container of cranberries into his reusable bag. Between his legs, his cock throbs and twitches inside his sweats. Who would've thought he'd get it up in front of a pack of Hersheys.
Castiel clenches his fists then relaxes them, he gives Dean a self depreciating smile. "It is quite sad."
The Angel huffs out a low chuckle of disgust. What is wrong with him? He's lost. He's never wanted to experience lust, he never felt the need and his Alpha never yearned for someone; but Dean, Castiel wipes his cock and hands, Dean makes him rebel.
"It is just me, Dean." Castiel's voice is echo-y, it tingles all of Dean's nerves and washes over his brain like a drowning wave. "Keep your eyes closed. I do not want you losing your ability to see."
"Okay. That's not what I'm asking, how do you feel about it? Do you still feel responsible because you didn't—"
"F-fuck me! Harder, daddy! D-daddy! I-I'm gonna, oh, oh, fuck!" Dean shudders violently as a cold tendril wraps around and tightens on the base of Dean's cock. This is Castiel's grace, Castiel wrapped his–shit, fuck, Dean's balls draw and he arches into Castiel.
Footsteps, heavy and headed towards the kitchen. Dean can't pick up a scent and the hairs on his neck raise.
"Please give it to me, Mommy, p-please!" Castiel begs, fucking deeper inside Dean. Dean bites his lip and works Castiel's hole open, wiggles his finger for good measure and Castiel stills.
Castiel's eyes wander along Dean's body before his eyes lift back up and he smiles before crossing right leg over his left. "Are you into exhibitionism?"
"You aren't going to eat with me?" Dean asks, not because he cares, and picks up the fork. The Alpha makes a small humming noise.
By the time Dean makes it to the snow covered, metal stairs of his apartment, his head is pounding and his legs are itchy from walking too much. His cheeks, nose, and neck are red with exhaustion and his eyelashes are clumped together by melted snow. Dean grips the iron railing hard enough to the point where his knuckles go white then begins his ascend up to stairs.
Their rare family dinner is held at a posh restaurant with a dark interior, hanging lights, and glass tables accompanied by black chairs.
"An Alpha. One that smells like a rainforest and honey and opens a jar of butterflies in my stomach whenever I see them." Dean looks down, his cheeks highlighted by something gold and glittery and lips glossed with a clear substance.
"My family is planning a Matchmaking Ball so I can mate and be with pup." Dean grumbles into the darkness between his legs.
"My body will remain the same. I will remain the same. I will still rule like I wanted and since I have a mate there's nothing stopping me from doing so once you and father step down." Dean states evenly even though his hands are shaking and his heart is going a mile a minute.
"I also believe that I am pansexual." Castiel whispers but what rests on his tongue are harmful scripts that his mother would recite until head would hurt and he would cry to make her stop. Little boys that like others boys aren't sinners. It's the priest. The priest is always the sinner. Castiel thinks and breathes, his hands tremble.
A swooping wave of nausea makes Dean groan weakly and turn to his side as he rubs his belly. As he shifts an uncomfortable wetness between his legs become more noticeable and he sucks in a shaky breath.
Dean goes to open his mouth but blinks, frowns, and closes it. Now that he thinks about it, he knows that a couple people from his last group actually did find their soulmates.
Dean groans. "Look'atchu, 'm so proud of you baby. So easy for me. You okay with a little blood, baby? Wanna put you between my thighs."
Gabriel who eats one too many sweets and makes lewd jokes about anything and everything, is giving Castiel advice. Human advice.
"Naomi probably has that placed locked down. We can't possibly go there." Lucifer argues while Charlie lets out a nasty wince when Lucifer presses down on her cut just a bit too hard.
"It's kinda like how you can love a person but not like them." Dean tries to connect and Castiel nods.
"She's using Leviathan to weaken him, feeding him it, how will she use it to make him step down?" Dean presses his lips together.
Castiel's heart squeezes at the thought. It doesn't call Gabriel but it does text a few minor updates and then spills its heart out to its plants.
Castiel remembers each plucked wing, each sound from the splatter of blood hitting the cold, industrial floor as Lucifer hummed Christmas tunes behind him. Like Castiel was some everyday project that he worked on for fun.
Dean curls in on himself, smearing his cum into the sheets, and weeps. Just a bit because Dean doesn't cry. Not really. In rehab everyone cries, they sob until the inside of their throats are caked with blood or until they pass out. Dean didn't cry; he let out teary breaths of regret and longing but he hasn't cried since back then.
Castiel's dick pulses, one, two, three times between Dean's thighs before it cums with a slurred moaning of a mix of Dean's name and his title. Hot and thick and overwhelming.
"You guys decided to make it!" Garth cheers, cheeks already flushed and eyes flashing from red back to his original colour.
When he makes it to the back of his house, he toes off his sandals and uses his back to push open the back kitchen door. He's only two steps in before Ellen starts picking at him.
"Yeah, 'm tellin' you I'll be fine, Ma. Yes, I put my stuff in my room. No, I haven't seen my roommate yet." a voice travels through the crack in the door and becomes louder as owner of the voice steps through.
"Yes, sir. Goodbye, Castiel. Goodbye, Dean." Anna bows her head respectfully before taking her leave.
"Think it's cause," Dean huffs, eyes drooping and head falling to the side. "Think it's cause I love you."
Dean touches it nice and slow, uses the pads of his thumb to stroke its sensitive nipples before Castiel even has the chance to start taking off his clothes, to even walk fully in the room.
Dean peers up at Jo from underneath his eyelashes with his pen resting on his bottom lip, and makes a curious noise in the back of his throat.
"Winchester." but his voice is rough, dry, and he hasn't talked in a week which makes it sound like he's saying, "Win'ester."
"Can I put it in?" Castiel unbuckles his belt and pushes down his pants and boxers underneath his balls.
"It's not like you to call on us like this, Luci." Gabriel points out, hooking an arm over Lucifer's neck and slouching on him. Lucifer grits his teeth and crosses his arms. Charlie stifles her laugh and smiles at Dean. "Congrats on the baby, Dean."
Castiel's lips form into something of a small, mean smile and as he lets go of Dean's hand, his finger trails down Dean's palm and Dean licks his lips nervously, a rare habit of his.
There was a lot of blood, and needles, she stuck needles in my thighs. I remember panicking mid orgasm and I just, vanished back to my car. I was bleeding everywhere and my–I was still hard. It was–I loved her, Cas. I
Charlie blinks, her features carefully blank before an added flush appears on her cheeks and Gabriel cackles loudly.
"I-I want–finish courting." he spits out, sucking in a harsh breath and letting it back out. Dean tries to hide his surprise but can tell he failed at the small, shocked 'oh' he lets out.
Dean shuffles on his feet, his slick making an awkward noise between his closed thighs and Castiel huffs, agitated, before tugging down the fabric until it pools at Dean's feet.
It's such a pathetic sight to see, really; red faced with tears gathering at the corners of his eyes as he continues to struggle with oxygen starvation. If she goes any longer there might even be brain damage and
Some days the two would stay up envisioning their house. How many bedrooms would it have? Would the kids nursery be closer to their room or further away? Would they build it by hand or have someone else do it? Dean remembers them writing down their plans on the back of a Lucky Charms box at three in the morning.
If Castiel were to explore, to really see it, Dean doesn't want to think about what would happen. "Only touch here, please."
Dean gives Lucifer an unamused look before Sam locks up and his face pales. Tears leak out of his eyes and he mumbles.
Dean sits down on his bed with a huff and undoes the top of his towel so it falls at his sides, leaving him naked.
Slivers of Castiel's grace burns through his vessel making streams of life shine through the open gaps in his weakened vessel; the burning makes Castiel's headache, makes the depths of his energy drain, and the fake lights in their house flicker. Castiel pulls back with a pained groan and squeezes his eyes shut, digging his nails into Dean's thighs.
"I think you should go." Castiel's hands slip from Dean's shirt and he moves behind the desk. Dean blinks a few times and turns to stare at Castiel, balking.
"Sammy and I always go. Don't wanna leave the old folks alone too long." Dean bites into a mushroom.
"Metatron, an old prophet that Father trusted. Naomi was there when Jane was killed and told me what happened, that's when she got overprotective. Metatron called us abominations. Embodiments of sin." Castiel's voice wavers, his scent, one that smells of rain on thick pavement, molds into the sicking salt of the ocean.
Castiel looks awkward, out of place, his suit is all black while everyone else has on bright colors, his hair is wild and he has a stubble while everyone is clean shaven and have their hair tamed. Also, his tie is backwards.
Dean picks up a night gown off the floor of his closet and slides it on. "No, I was just, hoping? People in the movies they have sex and fall in love and, and that's what we–what
"Fuck," Dean hisses, jerking his hips forward. It hurts and his thighs are itchy and he hiccups around a gasp of air.  It's just a small touch, just to stop the mosquitos from biting. Dean uses one hand to hook his thumb over the material and push it down so the glistening tip of his cock hangs open in the air.
The door eases open and Castiel pokes his head in but Miracle has other plans as she pushes through the door and jumps on the bed excitedly, nudging her nose against Dean's cheek. Dean ruffles her fur with a small smile and kisses the top of her head.
Dean isn't sure how long he stays lying there staring at a picture across from him that sits on Castiel's dresser. Maybe it's been thirty minutes or maybe an hour but Castiel's knot has deflated and his cum dribbles out of Dean's hole and onto the sheets.
"When I first met them, I had a feeling that this would be the case." Castiel says. "I've come to terms with it."
Dean stumbles as he backs away then turns and quickly makes it to his room. He shuts and locks the door instinctively then stands in the middle of the room trying to calm his shaking body.
"Ease down on it, my love." Castiel instructs. Dean takes a steadying breath and braces his hands on Castiel's shoulders before slowly inching down on his cock.
"Didn't take you for an Angel who likes sex Jazz." Dean teases when soft saxophone begins to emit from the speakers. He's more a rock kind of guy but he can get behind this. Only because Castiel did so much for him today.
Castiel bounces on his toes and wiggles his fist happily as he turns around and walks back into his room and shuts the door before sitting on his bed.
"You want me because I'm here, because it'll distract you from what you're anxious or scared about. Not because you...feel something for me." Castiel's tone goes sad and soft and Dean clenches his jaw.
"Your wings are out again, Castiel." Anna reprimands kindly as if this isn't the first time she's had to remind him of this.
Dean narrows his eyes. "It happens about an hour or so later, I have bonds will all my clients so if one of them gets cut, I instantly know about it. All clients have multiple gun shots but no signs of forced entry, no sulfur, no hex bags, nothing."
Castiel reaches forward and carefully puts the back of his hand against Dean's forehead. "Only drink as much as you can. Don't worry about finishing it."
The man doesn't seem particularly worried about what Dean is doing but his arms are crossed as he leans against the dingy Lincoln Continental and his head is tilted as if he's studying Dean.
Dean nods dumbly, words no longer the one thing he's good at, and allows Castiel to lead him to where everyone else is gathered. Castiel's hand cups his right hip gently while the other clasps his left hand. The music that plays is jazz, not Dean's favorite but Castiel has this sparkle in his eye and a small uptick on his lips so Dean doesn't mention it. The lights are dimmed and suddenly this feels very, very real. They sway like teenagers at prom; a little awkward and clumsy but Castiel is smiling and Dean has never felt so good in his life.
"So," Donna says conversationally, tapping her pen on the notepad. Dean raises his eyebrows, used to her tactics seeing as he's been doing this for six weeks now. She knows he's not telling her something.
"That's okay. You want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror, use that. Everyday when you get that fear of coming back, use that. Some days it might not work and that's okay."
It's annoying how self aware he is of the unhealthy habit; crawling into bed when he reaches emotional capacity and not getting up until Cas wakes him or nature calls. He knows he's supposed to get up, he's supposed to do something to stay out of the warm nest that Castiel made. He tells himself it's to make up for lost times when he never got to sleep.
Dean crooks his finger on the top of the book and tilts it to slide it out. He sits back on the couch underneath the painting of Koi fish, sneezing at the dust that jumps up, and watches the pages ripple under his thumb until he settles on the first proper page.
"I know. It's new, it's different and it's not us. We aren't used to it but you don't get to choose when you want to be there for Dean. You are both hurting and you both need each other. But Dean can't fly away like you can! He wants you. What do you want?"
"Stop." Dean's voice quivers like he's a kid again who doesn't know how to say no, not to his father. Not to Daddy who wanted to play.
Castiel huffs, squishing in a third finger next to the other two and Dean writhes at the stretch, his head coming down to rest on Castiel's sweaty shoulder. "Daddy, gimme it, please. 'M ready,"
"When you were going to tell me about your boyfriend?" Sam asks when Dean walks out, effectively causing him to startle and let out a short string of curses.
Dean's cheeks heat and he stuffs the last of the burger in his mouth, cheeks puffed adorably. Castiel gently trails a finger above the hem of Dean's panties.
"I don't love her. Yes. Yes, okay, I fuckin–when I came here I had just broken up with her, she kept my grace calm and we were–she trusts me. I trusted her and when I told her I also liked men, it was difficult. Insecurities broke the relationship but I don't–C-as!" Dean's toes curl at Castiel's tip nestled inside of him.
"You grew into such a handsome boy, you were always the funny looking one." she shakes her head fondly. Should Dean feel offended? Because he is.
Castiel wants to duck his head but Dean tightens his grip and yanks Castiel towards their cock, smearing his pre against the stubbled cheek.
"He liked when I cried sometimes." Dean mumbles around wet lips; tears and snot soaking into the soft material of Castiel's sweater "I'm prettier when I cry."
"Crowley and Rowena, they run a Scottish pub downtown at a crossroads. Tell them I sent you and ask them what they know about Leviathan Blossom."
"Hey." Dean breathes out with a small smile. Castiel opens his mouth then it closes again and Dean waits.
Castiel scrambles to pick up Dean's heels and chase after the loud, soul-moving laughter and beautiful Omega.
"We have saying In Russia: When cat is away, mice will play. Jess was away so Colt go play." Castiel spits while using his thumb to rub Claire's back soothingly.
Still stinking of cigarettes and haunted by a childhood memories, Dean strips off his clothes as he walks to the washroom for a quick shower.
It's anguish, no, it's agony, Dean thinks. The pain that Castiel must feel and endure is indescribable and Dean's heart squeezes at the exposed bone he can see through the holes in Castiel's wings.
With a short huff of air forced out between his lips,  Castiel readjusts the fairly big moving box in his hands and uses his back to reopen the heavy, ajar door. He knocks his hip against the obnoxiously close dining chair as he rounds the door, letting it close behind him, and with a sharp wince and then a low groan, Castiel squats down and sets down the slightly damp box next to the three other ones in the bedroom that's just across from the door.
Castiel hums lowly. A lie would hurt Dean much more than the truth. Castiel closes his eyes. They have a lot to talk about.
Castiel wants to consume. He wants to monopolize this Omega, he wants to wrap the Omega in his arms and keep him there forever. Castiel is a simple man after all and Dean will be his downfall.
The Omega rises slowly, his knees wobbly and his eyes swollen from the tears that escaped his eyes. He steps over to Naomi, extending his hand to drop her jewelry into her open, awaiting palm.
"I didn't mean it like that, I–" Dean sighs shakily. He's shit at this. "I didn't have to kiss you to know I was in love with you." Castiel's breath hitching is loud and almost makes Dean choke from how fast he holds his own.
"I don't know what they feed you Russians, but that thing is definitely not small." two weeks could pass and Dean would still feel it.
Dean almost collapses when he makes it home, his body is covered in sweat, his feet hurt, and his lungs burn.
No matter how disgusting it might feel, he'll do it again and again and again because he doesn't know what might happen if he stops or if he doesn't follow the pattern anymore.
"Aaron?" Dean calls, walking down the stairs with a fake smile plastered on his face. Aaron scrambles to stand up, a heated blush on his cheeks while his golem stares down at Dean.
Dean licks his lips and he feels pre stain his boxers when Castiel follows the movement with his eyes. "Yeah, no, I'm good." Dean clears his throat when it comes up in pitch.
He didn't really notice when it started to happen. He assumes his brain blocked it out, he's told that often happens when trauma is involved. It's weird though; he hates sexual intimacy but craves it like good a bottle of cheap whiskey yet he hates showering or looking at his body in the mirror, but give him a bottle of cherry astroglide and lock him in his room, he'll empty out the container.
"It's my life, Cas! Of course it was about you but nooo, you and your stupid need to feel as if I'm some damsel in distress fucked everything!"
"I enjoyed you taking my "kiss virginity" but I fear that if we continue that I will do something very unholy." Castiel says with sincerity, he even uses quotation marks when repeating Dean's words. It's kind of adorable.
"Look who's decided to join us!" Mary cheers once they step through the door. Sam looks back from his place on the couch with a big smile.
"Boys," Mary says warningly, a playful tone in her voice. "Let's not send Dean's guest running for the hills."
"Sorry, it took me a while to find Ophelia's harness." Castiel's voice sends a tingle down Dean's thigh and Dean waves his hand dismissively, shoving his phone in his back pocket, the unfinished text he was ready to send Sam prolonged for a little longer, and looking up.
"I think the last time I celebrated my birthday was when I was fourteen." he admits, staring at the golden crust. "Birthdays aren't important to me and I've never–only with my mom but she never made it to my fifteenth."
Anna leans forward over eagerly, ignoring Dean beside her who looks uncomfortable and out of place. Gabriel gives her a look and Castiel has a stifle a chuckle when Gabriel mumbles a few unkind words towards her then vanishes with his lover.
"I love you too." Dean says. "Loved you since fuckin' forever." he laughs breathlessly and Castiel smiles, all teeth and gums.
"It might not even be his!" Dean covers his eyes with the crook of his elbow. "It might not be Castiel's."
Castiel pauses, head tilting up from being buried in the pillows and scents openly. He rises slowly while a low growl begins in the back of his throat. Dean eyes drop between Castiel's chest to his cock and an orange hue shows the shiny column of Castiel's throat. Dean licks his lips nervously, slick making his thigh hairs damp, he tilts his head back invitingly.
Dean grins, then his smile widens, then he snorts until he doubles over in laughter. "I'll come back tomorrow. I know you have lots of people praying to you but don't forget about me, okay?"
A slight twinge of pain in Dean's heart makes him grimace and rub thoughtlessly at his chest. He should know things like that would never happen for him.
"I don't want to tell you anything you aren't ready for." Castiel shakes his head with a small smile.
Charlie doesn't say anything to him when he gets out of the car. She looks at him with sad eyes and understanding and it makes Dean feel sick to his stomach.
"I remember you saying how when Michael was forcing his grace into you that you felt a searing pain and when you woke up you had that mark on your arm."
"You forget that we three used to be friends. I know why you're here and no, we aren't making the drug. I trust that you will find out who is."
grace, Dean thinks bitterly. "At bay. The only witch in this town who can unlock them is Rowena but she won't do it until you are better mentally, emotionally, and physically."
This is his rock bottom, isn't it? The dark feeling rumbling inside him, a sense of dissociation that he's always had, hurting people even when he promised himself not to. He can't even look his brother, the one he
"I think I want to propose to Charlie." Jo confesses, putting down a freshly dried glass just to pick up a wet one and dry it down.
Drool seeps out of Dean's mouth while he openly pants, eyes fighting to stay open. Castiel talking makes a shiver run down Dean's spine, it makes his cock jerk and body run from hot to hotter.
"But it was implied." Castiel interrupts. "You do know that because you went over, it's not your fault right? That he moved?"
The Novaks live in a manor. A very large, very expensive looking, manor that has Dean questioning every move he's made up until now
Other, lower Angels bow that fill the rest of the seats bow their heads respectfully at Castiel and he gives the same courtesy.
Blood dripped down his back, into his ass crack, down his thighs and onto the floor. His face streaked with tears and his body was no longer his. Castiel thinks that he used to scream, used to bed for his brother to stop, but that doesn't matter. Nobody would hear his pleads anyway.
"Oh." Mary gasps out softly. Dean can't tell if it's out of shock or disgust. He's not sure that he wants to find out. "That's...well," She stammers for a moment glancing behind her at John and Sam.
Naomi is a hunter, an terrifying analyst with no emotion and it reminds him so much of his father. How did she even know that the scar is incomplete?
"I'm not disappointed. It's okay, it's alright. You tried and you did good and I'm so proud of you, Dean." Castiel encourages softly. "Thank you for trying, you're so good."
the age difference between Sam and Dean is eight years instead of four because I didnt calculate the math properly when I posted the last chapter so everything would align. I hope that's okay!
"Pretty princess." Castiel purrs and leaving mark after mark onto Dean's body and tilting his hips upward so he cock grazes the spot that makes Dean cry out and his eyes roll back.
A drug connected to this family shouldn't be as surprising as Dean thinks it is but it reeks deceit and hate. To be able to get close enough to one of God's first children would mean that there's someone in the family who did this.
"Dean, it's nice to see you!" Mary smiles and Castiel watches Dean count to five before turning around.
He kind of misses the nicotine smell. He stops to think for a second. When was the last time he had a cigarette? Dean sucks his teeth, it's against the rules to smoke them anyway.
"Remember when I thought you cheat?" Castiel tilts his head toward Dean and Dean snorts with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.
Dean emphasizes, "you aren't judgmental. I mean you stayed with me the entire night even when I–" Dean cuts himself off and his face goes red with embarrassment. "You took care of me. I'm sure your soulmate will appreciate that."
Touch. He wants to touch Dean all over, Gods, it's like a kaleidoscope opens in his chest whenever he breathes in the very being that is Dean Winchester.
Charlie is sat comfortably on Dorothy's lap, sharing what looks like something citrusy on the chair pulled up to the booth; Benny and Andrea are huddled together across the table from Dean and Cas; Jo and Ash linger at the table from time to time but go about serving other customers; And Garth is swaying slightly in his own seat; Bess absent.
Dean tenses at the heavy killing intent, an uncomfortable unsettling weight swirls in his gut.  There's a low creaking noise further down the hall and the two cast a quick glance to each other before walking down the corridor.
"I-I don't wan‐want you to th-think I'm weird." Castiel sobs gripping Dean's wrist harder. Dean licks his lips. They should buy urethra inserts.
Dean's heart thuds hard against his ribs at the sight of Castiel's flushed cheeks. They weren't that pink earlier were they?
"I want Sammy's rehab paid for the next three months and you will get updates on my terms." Dean hangs up, takes out the sim card to rip it in half, then puts in another before calling the number again.
"I'll go put the sheets in the washer and leave you to change. When I get back, we'll have some saltines and soup, okay?"
"Let it out, baby. It's okay, I'm so proud of you, you feel fuckin' amazing inside of me." Dean rubs Castiel's back with his free hand.
"We knocked on your door but you failed to answer so Gabriel decided to barge in." Charlie explains with a sympathetic smile while her hand is in a position that covers Dean's–oh.
"You doin' to that boy what you did to me? You tell 'em who taught you?" John's voice is mean, makes Dean cower and tears well in his eyes. He wants to cum.
Dean peers up through his eyelashes at Castiel then shrugs once more through another swallow of soup.
Castiel rises from his chair and snaps his fingers to get himself clean then puts on the suit he got from Lucifer after his brother had chosen to rule over Hell; a crisp, white one that frames his body nicely. He clasps together the second button and smooths his hand over it while he looks at himself in the mirror. His hair is still mused messily and his eyes are devoid of any emotion.
"I was just surprised at the question. I haven't loved anyone like that before so I can only say that I like you." and now Dean gets it. He gets what it's like to want to swallow your own tongue and drink needles until blood is his new fruit punch.
"Cool! Great! I'll see you!" by now Dean's cock has been leaking a steady stream of pre into his boxers and his hands are shaking by his sides. Dean steps out of Castiel's apartment and makes his way to the polished elevator, the only new thing they put in this apartment building. Dean walks inside, Miracle being happily dragged along, and presses the lobby button before resting against the metal railing. He presses his hand against his chest, willing his beating heart to calm down.
"Jo put you on the bed before she came on got me. Looks like she's done this before but this one was a worse than one's she's experienced."
Dean makes a low moaning sound behind him, clutching the pillow underneath his head between white-knuckled fists. Castiel reaches under Dean's shirt and brushes his hand against the sweaty back. Dean relaxes under his touch, sighing as he falls back into a deep sleep. That's the only sight Castiel would put above the beautiful glare that the sun gives; Dean's face pushed into the pillow, drool seeping out the side of his mouth and long eyelashes fanned across his freckled, shiny cheeks.
Castiel tightens his legs and Dean brings his hand back to fondle Castiel's cock while humping his cock between the plush meat of Castiel's thighs.
"For a minute and then it was just me dry heaving. I'm," Castiel pauses, frowns, and squints his eyes. "feeling better."
Deciding to put in behind him, Dean shuffles around the study a bit more. A dark red book with thin gold lining catches his attention; similar to all the other ones scattered and there's nothing extra extraordinary about it except that fact that it isn't caked with dust and has been moved recently.
"You always know what I need, baby." Dean sighs as Castiel walks into Dean's old bedroom a few minutes after, hands scrubbed pink from nervousness.  Castiel closes the door with a gentle click, then clenches its fists then relaxes them.
when Castiel spoke. When he said "please" and "thank you". So Castiel offers a shaky smiles and nods.
"Every parent has favorites. I was my father's and I paid for it and I didn't want you–" Castiel sighs and sits down on the sand.
The door swings closed on its hinges and with each flick of the door Dean can see heavy snow falling sideways and Benny's retreating back.
Larissia walks into the No Regrets bar and when the camera shows a shot of familiar red hair, Dean's mouth drops.
Lucifer looks up and into the distance. "I think he knows," his eyes flicker to Dean. "that he's dying. I think he knows."
"There should be a river around here." Lucifer mutters under his breath, taking a second to flicker his eyes at the monotone scenery around him before walking straight forward.
90 Day comes back and again Nigeria pops up onto the screen and Dean sighs. "Angela and Michael, what's in store for us today?"
Dean cries out. Castiel growls low in his throat and fucks his knot against Dean's prostate until Dean's eyes widen, his mouth opens in a wordless cry and he clamps down on Castiel's knot.
"There's nothing wrong with it. It's normal, it's fine." Dean hiccups around a few tears and nods. Castiel peppers kisses on his face. "You took me so beautifully. Thank you for letting me have this, Omega."
He grimaces at it, the words seem like he didn't type them. Grunting, Dean walks into the bathroom to shower. The water is cold, it makes his cock shrivel and nipples hard but grounds him enough so he feels like a person. Brown and red mix with clear going down the drain but he doesn't feel a speck cleaner.
Dean's left arm tingles and before he has the chance to look up from the sand, a rolled up blue paper is tapped on his nose. Dean's eyes cross to stare at the paper before his eyes roll up to look at Castiel. Cas smiles down at his lover and sits down on the grainy sand next to him, bringing a hand to gently grip the back of Dean's neck as a grounding gesture.
Cassie departs with a small nod in Dean's direction and Dean gives a tight-lipped smile. How long has it been since he's seen her? Four, almost five, months?
Maybe, just maybe, Castiel is contaminated by a plague of sorts. A plague that makes his toes curl and wings arch whenever he stares at Dean for a little too long. Castiel is only a man. A simple, quiet, kind man with the ability to move mountains and Gods, he would move them for Dean.
Dean notices the body before he notices Cain sitting at the dining table staring off into the distance with his arms crossed.
"Then what? Then he'll know his brother was having sex with their father, he'll know that the reasons why I stayed in his room at night was because I was too afraid to go to mine, what then? Huh?" Dean states angrily at Jo who simply squints.
"I don't participate in rape nor do I condone it," Alpha stops for a minute before talking again, his voice now sinister and deeper than Dean remembers it being. "Unless that's what you're into."
It's enough to make Dean tear up. Sam dressed neatly in his white suit that contrasts beautifully against Gabriel's black one. Their hands are joined together in union and the pastor, an Angel that goes by the name Sister Jo, stands between them with a bible opened on her palms.
"Where's Eileen? She decided to leave your ass?" Dean pretends to look around and Sam flips him off.
The next day is a blur for Dean. His morning is sluggish and Castiel is still asleep by the time he wakes up so he prepares both of them coffee and leaves for work. Bobby's Autoshop isn't booming with customers but it's enough for Dean to feel steady and grounded. He spends the rest of the day under the hood of multiple cars with grease under his fingernails and the sound of Castiel's screams in his ears.
It's want and Castiel is lying. Castiel wishes to be a simple man, he wishes to sleep and eat like the normal would but he's an animal. An Angel confined to the Heavens by nobody's orders except his own and Castiel is so very weak because of it. No man could watch another for eight-thousand seven-hundred and sixty days.
Lucifer had his wrists bound the the ceiling and his feet to the floor, stretched in an unbearable position. His wings laid at rest, twitching from time to time while Lucifer circled him.
Dean's dick is small, small enough to the point where Castiel's big hand practically engulfs it; his balls, ones that are supposed hanging and full are now empty and resemble a labia.
It's not fair. Sam did invite him, protected him against the seemingly inevitable but Dean is tired. He's tired of the past coming back to bite him in his ass, he's tired of feeling like he can never get a break, like something is always out to get him. Dean presses the heel of his hand into his eye.
Dean's eyes survey the beach and he can't help but remember Sam and Gabriel's wedding. A beautiful day it had been; he was able to see his little brother get
"Sonovabitch!" Dean's cock twitches and his hole clenches. Castiel brings Dean's hands to hold up his own legs then leans down to–
It's not even a minute before the food appears before them, bags dotted with grease and the savory smell fries and melted cheese.
Dean's always made Sam dinner on Christmas Eve since he was a kid; Mary would never get the energy too and John would be too drunk off of spiked eggnog to even come home until the next day. He was always touchy the next day.
Dean's cheeks turn a beautiful shade of red and he covers Jack's ears. "There are kids around." he scolds.
Dean's opens his mouth with an assumed response, expression desperate; cheeks and chest flushed an embarrassing shade of red, eyes hooded, and lips bitten raw but between one breath and the next Dean's head tilts back and a rough groan rips from his throat.
"I outta tell your mom about this, cher." Benny scolds playfully and Jo snorts around her flask. It's too early to be drinking but Jo isn't hurting anyone so Castiel doesn't say anything.
Anna is rough. She doesn't kiss or leave marks. She doesn't waste time on prep and is loud in bed. Anna treats Dean like a job where Castiel treats him like a lover. A mate.
Castiel stands up. arms flexing as he heaves the basket up with him, shifting it to his hip so he can grab the blunt. "My apologies. I'll see you on Friday. I hope work goes good."
"'S my fault too, should'a explained it to you. I just live in my own lil' world sometimes and think that everybody knows." Dean explains. "I'm sorry too."
"You're wearing scent blockers." Gabriel points a saliva coated lollipop in his direction and raises his eyebrows.
Castiel snaps the top of his underwear and nudges him. Dean takes the hint, leaning down on Castiel's chest for support as he strips from his only article of clothing. He misses Castiel's pained expression from having his back pressed heavily against the bed.
"Can I–" Dean shakes his head, biting the gum inside his cheek and Castiel raises his hand before smacking it down on Dean's thigh, causing him to cry out and lurch upwards on his knees. Castiel runs over the warm skin and makes an inquiring sound.
"I'll think about it." he whispers, giving her a tense smile. She pats his thigh again, but this time she leans close and whispers, "Castiel is more talkative at night." Dean furrows his brows in confusion but she just smiles and leaves with the Angel.
His hands don't feel like his own, the thought of who's it actually is makes his bottom lip wobble and bile rise in his throat. Dean squeezes his cock and tightens his fingers around the nub. Cum dribbles over his fingers and his balls pulse lazily.
"I dated this chick named Lisa and she liked to hurt me, I guess? I mean–I liked it but one day–" God, he feels nauseous. Castiel tugs his hand from underneath his head and cups it around Dean's waist then tugs them closer together.
Dean slides his hand over to the unoccupied space beside him and bundles the frigid sheets in his sweaty hand while his face stays buried in the pillow.
There's blood rushing to Dean's ears, his own heartbeat pounding painfully fast in his chest that he's afraid Castiel will hear it. Castiel's touching him, licking him while he thinks that Dean is someone else. Dean clenches around nothing and his cock swells; that thought shouldn't be as riveting as it is.
"Jus' wanna," Dean slurs, settling back down. "Jus' wanna see your face, daddy." Castiel reaches over to turn on the nightstand lamp; it creates a beautiful orange/yellowish hue and illuminates Castiel's face and Dean's lower half in the darkness.
Dean thinks the feeling most close to describe his being sorry is a dark cave; a cave that has water dripping of its hanging rocks and falling onto a bottomless pit that Dean is too afraid to look down at. It's a sinking feeling that even though he won't look down the darkness in front of him will swallow him hole. That rhythmic
Dean falls head first into his apartment, legs unsteady and body shaking from the low temperature. He kicks the door closed with the sole of his boot before taking them off.
"Gotta clean us up. Just stay there. Close your eyes." Dean orders and Castiel closes its eyes, thinking and breathing.
At the drop of Sam's name, Dean is quick to sit up and get on his knees to crawl to the foot of the bed. "Hey, hey, what happened?"
Dean decides to leave the rest of the clothes to fold later and walks down the hall to find the livingroom. He takes a moment to admire the path he walks; the ceiling rises high and carries fancy chandeliers, the wall's color, a white, almost hardened cream, color are complemented with half pillars engraved into the walls; expensive looking artwork hangs on the peacefully on the walls.
Dean tightens his hold on black strands and tilts Castiel's head up so their lips can slot together. Blood and saliva mix together as do their tongues which lick repeatedly at one another before Castiel growls lowly and bites Dean's lower lip as he pulls away.
"Wait how long?" Dean frowns his eyebrows and the lady heaves a long, tired sigh before setting down her papers and peering up at Dean over her glasses. Her nose twitches and her eyebrows rise a inch or two, she takes the paper, adjusts her glasses, and reads over it.
I would also like to thank Carrot_Connoisseur for being incredibly sweet and giving me feedback on this fic!
Dean and Sam eye each other with obvious challenge before begrudgingly mumbling their equal holiday cheer. John sits quietly in his chair. Dean tries to not let it get to him.
"Of course." Dean's heart clenches when Castiel looks up with a forced smile when Dean slides the coffee over to him. "I'll see you on Friday, Mr. Winchester."
"No Angel has ever broken lightbulbs when confessing to me." Dean's voice is light and airy and Castiel's laugh comes out in an amused huff.
"If you are concerned about whether or not the position is open then the answer would be in your favor. As you know the requirements state that you have to be fertile and scent compatible with Mr. Novak. For any further information, your presence would need to be required at the Novak Residence."
"Good, you come with me and Sam to run in morning." Castiel comments and gets up from the couch, Claire still sleeping in his arms.
Light shuffling in his room can also be heard; the unraveling of sheets and the soft noise they make as they hit the floor. Dean sits up and stretches his neck to see inside his room.
"Thank you, bush." he mummers kindly before turning around while cradling the berries to his chest. The gentle sloshing of water does wonders to sooth his mind and he did snack on a few of the berries so it's understandable why he didn't notice the person on the opposite side of the pond watching him. And it's not until Dean gets that telltale prickle at the side of his face that he looks up and to the right that he sees Nordic, maybe even Blue Star, eyes staring right at him.
. Now, the kid is only twenty two and in some padded cell and if Dean can't figure out who's making the drug or some heaven sent fucking cure, how the hell is he supposed to live with himself?
Charlie puts her glass down, not nearly as drunk as Gabriel but her hands shake and her cheeks are a little flush. "Our chef, Benny, made breakfast earlier, I could bring some for you if you'd like." she stands up to leave but Dean stops her with a hand wrapped loosely around her wrist.
"Between you and Jo, I'm not sure who's worse. Go get changed and don't go so far next time." Ellen scolds but Dean's eyes are still trained on the paper sack.
"It's h-hot! Y-your pussy is hot!" Castiel moans, jolting forward and filling Dean with the entire length of his cock. Dean eyes flutter and she sinks her teeth into her bottom lip.
Dean pushes himself out of the booth and onto his feet, fake smiling at the customers waiting patiently at the till. His mind wanders back to the journal and its empty pages.
"Lookin' for a body a'mine. Cain? Heard he was 'round here." Dean says, the lie rolling off his tongue easily along with the southern accent. The man's brows jump and he looks behind at his friends then back at Dean.
"Oh, so it's a bracelet?" Dean wonders aloud and Castiel straightens up and looks at Dean with a raised eyebrow before his face relaxes and he gathers a notebook and pen.
He stands at the archway and scans the room. The windows are covered in darkened curtains and the only few lights that shines is the one overhead the stove and the three hanging lights that shines on three equally spaced spots of the island ominously. Dean's eyes flicker from the figure in the corner of meeting cabinets to the heated food resting on the island.
Everyone also sticks. Some like dirt or gunpowder, other's like overly sweet candy, and a select few of grass.
Dean's heart beats a little faster and he shrugs off his jacket, toes off his wet boots, and hands his keys before walking carefully to the kitchen.
A young lady with her blonde hair in a neat ponytail steps from the front booth and greets Castiel, telling him that his party has already arrived. Her heels and his white, steel tipped shoes are the only noise he focuses on as they walk.
"What's he like?" Dean asks, trying to seem as disinterested as possible. Anna regards him with a skeptical frown.
"It was still a successful birthday, yes?" Castiel's voice is light now, it still has that gravelly tone but it's soft around the edges. Dean feels heat rise to his cheeks.
Dean rolls his eyes up to the ceiling. "Thirteen, I think? Right around when I moved in with my uncle."
There was also the issue with the hotel. Castiel had grown attached from the place he built from the ground up but Dean convinced Castiel that once they moved out the hotel it wouldn't go anywhere and Castiel would still be its owner. It took a lot of pleading (and blowjobs, Dean's jaw aches at the memory) but eventually Castiel decided that maybe, just maybe, it would be okay if he moved out of the hotel. Then, they only had to wait.
"It's the scene in a horror movie right before it all goes wrong." Dean humours with a dry chuckle, his tail swaying. It's a short way to the department, what with the engraved writing on the walls directing him, two tall glass doors stand in Dean's way and he pushes them open with an annoyed sigh.
Entering the hotel, hoping to find Charlie or Benny, Dean stops short at the familiar female standing at the front desk.
Castiel laps lovingly at the blood and noses Dean's cheek. "You took me so well. I'm so proud. Are you okay?"
Castiel's eyes flicker, changing into something akin to sadness and he steps around Dean and to his door.
Castiel leaves the car to get their bags from the trunk before Dean can really register what happened.
A dusty cog in Dean's brain turns for a split second, his neck tenses, and his head jerks to the side sharply. Dean rubs at his neck with a grimace and sinks further into the leather seat. If Castiel notices it, he doesn't say anything.
"Maybe see if you can make it to the tub. Don't worry about the sheets. I'll clean them when I get back."
"Dean Winchester," a voice greets, full of false cheer and loud disgust, as Dean walks into the living space. A women, an plain Angel but an Alpha, with thin brown hair pulled back into a neat bun, not a strand out of place; her suit is tight yet Dean can tell she has full mobility and her eyes are just as empty as her smile.
"Dean, seeing as it's dark, Cassie would like to see you in the kitchen. Lucifer, come, let's watch the movie about the guy who killed all those people over his dog." Charlie outstretches her hand to Lucifer, who takes it gratefully, and follows her after a goodbye to Dean.
Castiel helps Dean up the stairs, gently stroking his thumb on Dean's shoulder. "Where's your room?"
Castiel has a gummy smile on his face, despite his flushed cheeks, and Dean gets a fluttering feeling in his stomach all over again. He rests his hand over Castiel's, locking their fingers together like before while sipping his beer.
Dean thinks about it for a moment. "Those hands and the shadows, the ones that I feel or felt and saw, could it be–was it them?"
It's not very long, only reaching the tops of his knees, but it's nice, light, and maybe Nordic will like it as well.
"How do you manage to make your therapist mad at you?" Jo asks into the tense silence as Dean tosses whatever smells clean enough into his duffle bag.
Dean chews the gum off the inner walls of his cheek. Even if she was involved, why would she be? She's God's second in command, she must be powerful. Maybe an Archangel like Lucifer.
When Dean told Castiel about what Mary had said, the Angel had been suspiciously calm the entire day but when nightfall came–Dean's cheeks flush at the memory.
Dean takes off his shirt first. It's wet where the underarms go and smells of dirt and sweat. He stands stark naked while Castiel is still sporting his security.
"Surely, Mr. Novak would want to rule." John says. Dean looks over to Castiel. He wouldn't do that. Not when they've–Castiel wouldn't hurt him.
"Gabriel will open the rift to Purgatory. Lucifer and I will track down Eve and hopefully get something out of her. Charlie, I hear you're good with computers?"
"Do you, Sam Winchester, take Gabriel Novak as your lawful husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part?"
"You know that I would let you rule, that I wouldn't hold you back from becoming Queen. Is that why you want us to consummate?"
"You'll need someone who bares The Mark to create the spell, myrrh, the seeds from a jewelweed, grace or blood from what you're healing, and essence from the cause if the curse itself."
"No, I'm alright. Thank you for the offer." Castiel mumbles, short and cold, making Dean's heart crack around the edges.
Nordic hums. "I suppose I don't get it. Us, other worldly beings, are not hung up on what genitalia we are given. We also look for love in high and low places. I am sure you have a mate out there."
He did this. He didn't follow the rules. It's six times. Six times a day that he can touch himself but just now, when Sam—that was seven.
"Yeah, maybe." he shrugs, sending a small smile her way before leaving the clinic. He shoves his hands into his pockets and looks down at the floor as he thinks.
"Doesn't he speak like Romanian and not Russian?" Castiel shushes Dean with a wave of his hand and they both focus back to the drama.
"Dean Winchester. Your family hired me as your companion Omega." and even though the Angel can't see him, Dean stands ramrod straight, fingers twitching all while he ignores the slick running down his pant leg. The mere trail of the droplet runs over the edge of Dean's sock and blends into the material and Alpha groans something fierce. He turns back around, wings casting a gush of air to swoop past Dean's face then crowds Dean once again into the sharp edges of the island.
Naomi walks around, looking at the fancy interior. "Winchester," she sighs. "Looks like I missed a dog." she turns her head to the side to look at Dean. "And here I thought I got all of them."
"Pretty puppy," Castiel grumbles into Dean's neck as he noses affectionately at his jaw and behind his ears. Castiel slides his hand underneath Dean's shirt only to grip the fabric from the inside and tug at it until it rips and the thread pushes it's limits until Dean is bare and flushed against the door.
Dean is too aware of the heels on her feet and the tight fitting polyester around her body. She swallows thickly and shakes her head. "'S fine." she whispers, trying to make her voice airy around the edges. "Was invited by a friend. It's not really my scene though."
Castiel doesn't blame anyone else for how he got into this position. Lucifer was casted aside, just as him, Angels thought he was the reason behind the falling. Father and him spent so much time on humans to worry about his first creations, there's probably something poetic about that. Castiel can't be bothered to figure out what.
"Pass me his chart." Dean gestures to the clipboard at the end of Sam's bed and Lucifer hands it to him with shaking hands.
not like other people his age. Holy shit, what does he do? How should he act? He should strip, yes, that's the first step: Stripping.
that green and blue thing was h a r d, im not that advanced with HTML and I was v confused on how to do it for a while. ahhh, I hope you guys like this chapter! this chapter was long as frick man.
Not that Castiel needed to warning when he could hear it; when he could feel it dirty the knees of his dress pants and soak into the sheets below them, and the
"Jesus Cas! I miss the mute you." Dean covers his face with his hands, cock twitching and hole clenching.
"I could get deglanded if they find out what I'm up to." Dean hisses, snapping his head towards Henricksen. "How do you even know they're looking?" he rolls his eyes back up to the sky.
He played and toyed with Castiel. He defiled that poor boy's body, and in a way, so did Castiel for taking it on in the first place.
Slipping away from the crowd is easy; the room is dark, John is distracted talking to Missouri who shoots him a sly wink, and Mary is dancing with Sam.
The stumble into the hotel room that they've been hiding out in and Dean clamps a hand over his mouth as a wave of sick decides to come up. As Dean gains his footing and the wave passes over, his eyes widen at the sight of the destroyed hotel room.
Castiel keeps eye contact with Dean as he sinks to his knees and gently takes hold of Dean's leg; he thumbs over Dean's knee before his hand trails downward.
There's also a disturbing about of pee pads on the floor of his living room but hey, at least its something.
Castiel wraps another tendril of grace around the base of Dean's cock and teases the sensitive head before sliding his essence into Dean's urethra. Dean's mouth opens in a soundless gasp, droll seeping from the sides of his mouth, nails digging into the soiled sheets below him, and back arching to the point of hearing a painful crack.
Castiel startles and ducks into the water while Dean curses and scrambles to get out of the pond. Tiny sticks become stuck underneath his foot and he has to brush them off on his calf before slipping into his shoes.
"She doesn't even feel sorry for Jess. Look at her, she's trying so hard not to jump for joy." Dean waves a dumpling around before popping it into his mouth.
Castiel gasps, short whiny little things and pulls Dean back against its cock. Wants to cry out the words but doesn't. It's too much and not enough and Castiel couldn't explain it if it tried.
Dean, still lust-drunk and floating, frowns in confusion as he tries to piece the words together in his hazy mind. It's the most words Castiel has ever said but Dean can't get past the fog in his mind to comprehend any of it.
"He's...occupied." Red explains with a tight grimace on her features. Naomi frowns her eyebrows, turns around, and looks down her nose at the Beta.
"You don't have to do this." Dean mumbles as Castiel dumps the berries into the bowl. They seem to be washed already from the water droplets resting on them.
Dean sucks his teeth and flicks the stick onto the ground then toes at the burning end. He wraps the blanket around himself tighter and steps out into the harsh, cold air. His nose and ears burn instantaneously and he can already feel his balls shriveling. Dean shivers with each step back into the house and suddenly misses the warmth that the nicotine gave him.
It takes longer than Dean expects, counting. It makes him annoyed and all to aware of his surroundings.
Ducking his head, Dean quickly blends with a rowdy group of caffeinated collage girls with his shoulders hunched and ducks into an alleyway. It looks like he's taking the long way home.
Dean rolls his shoulders as he tilts his head back as he makes his last steps toward the towering, gothic door that was guarded by Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. The two straighten their stature as Dean walked towards them and looked down at him, their wings twitching minutely at the low pheromone of Dean's anger that's surrounding them.
Castiel reaches to his nightstand and rummages for the half-empty bottle of lube before he squeezes it over his fingers and eases his middle finger into Dean's hole. Dean tenses, his hole clenching tightly around Castiel's finger. "Ooh," he sighs, relaxing into the sheets and rocking against the digit.
"Lisa. But I never had her living in my house and I didn't say I was in contact with her when I was."
Dean uses the back of his hand to stifle his yawn and curls his toes in his sandals. His body is heavy with sleepiness; he's walked long enough for his legs to start prickling with the need to itch and his tail bone aching from standing up for too long.
"I hope you can forgive Sam." she whispers. Benny tugs on Charlie's sleeve a few times before she lets go. Dean pats her shoulder, an awkward movement but they both smile anyway.
Castiel wants to throw up. His throat is dry and his head is pounding and he hates talking. He hates it and now Dean is going to leave him because he's broken, he's damaged.
Maybe he's dying. He feels unusually light and empty, in a good way. His body is trembling, shaking against Castiel's own and the words won't stop flowing out of his mouth like the tears running down his face.
"That wasn't so hard was it? You said it so wonderfully too. Such a good boy." Dean praises. "C'mon," Dean strokes Castiel's dick with the tip of his finger. "Show me what you wanna do to her."
He edges Baby into town slowly, follows a smooth, paved road while people are looking at him, not judging, but curious. Dean can't tell the difference. His skin prickles.
Castiel thinks about that night; when Dean was shaking with night terrors and Castiel had wrapped him in its blanket that has plants covering the fabric. When Dean had spoken in broken, short sentences about the things his father had said and done.
"Three of my clients have been killed in the past two weeks. All human, all done the same way. Pigs were thinking it was me but no way my work was as sloppy as that. Anymore of my clientele gets killed, less food I'll have and less humans in your debt." Dean spits out, pacing back and forth, hearing Rowena's goons stifle their coughs at Dean's rage, the scent of it.
"It's been a while since I've seen you on your knees." John says through the quiet hiss of the beer cap being popped off. Dean's ears ache and his stomach makes an angry noise as he jerks upward, going dizzy at how fast he got up.
Castiel smiles lightly and chuckles. "Don't mind me. Playful family banter is something new for me."
"Careful." he hisses before biting his lip and bucking his hips when Castiel scissors his fingers, one of them pressing down teasingly on his prostate.
The episode begins with TLC's generic music then the camera pans down onto Colt's figure pushing up his glasses and Dean gasps around a mouthful of meat and dough.
"I guess, yes, it could be a bracelet of sorts. How was your week?" Castiel gestures for Dean to sit down on the couch before sitting down in the chair across.
Dean looks up at Castiel, eyes swollen from tears and nose red from sniffling. "S-sore," he rasps. "'N cold."
Castiel does as he's told and Dean guides their cock between his thighs and underneath his balls. "Close legs."
Dean tries to speak, tries to express his gratefulness but if he opens his mouth, a sob might end up escaping instead.
Castiel extends his hand, showing Dean the small orange in his hand, a smile in his eyes. "Clementine?"
"Eve told us we need the bearer of The Mark of Cain. She didn't tell us anything else aside from the fact that he's in Missouri right before she blasted our ass outta there. It doesn't matter if we get what we need for the spell if we don't have the person who can make it."
"I will." Castiel uses one hand to spread Dean's cheek then grabs his cock and nudged it against Dean's hole before pushing it in slowly. Castiel lowers down to his forearms and holds Dean's hands and rocks his hips to slide in deeper. The movement makes an awkward squelching noise and Dean's scent flares in embarrassment.
It's been a while since he's swam, and even longer since he'd done it with his clothes on. He remembers how mad Mary got when him and Sam came back with their clothes drenched from playing in the nearby lake.
Nordic trails his movement. "Despite your hesitance, you thanked me. It would be ill-mannered to harm your person."
"Yeah?" Dean clenches experimentally around Castiel who gasps and jerks his hips forward again, making the desk shake. Castiel closes his eyes tightly and pants, digging his nails into the wood beside Dean's head.
It happens a lot, Cas still has problems with speaking when it comes to serious topics or if they're talking for too long then he'll sometimes shut down. Dean knows to wait until Cas is ready to speak again or they wrap it up for the day and speak with sticky notes instead. Sometimes his sentences are broken when he doesn't want to say it in full and it's okay. But Castiel seems to be sitting more stiffer than normal and his hand is trembling in Dean's grip.
Dean startles with an embarrassing yelp and falls back on his butt. Nordic's eyes widen and he moves closer to the edge of the pond to check on Dean.
Dean avoids looking up at the large mirror hanging on the wall and idly brings his fingers up to graze the cuts marking his stomach. Underneath the small pudge of his stomach, Dean feels the need to scratch at it.
Sam pulls back, bottom lip wobbly and nods. They walk to a secluded booth in the back and Dean notices the other person who looks just as awkward as he feels; the guy has hair long like Sam's, brown eyes, and thin lips. Archangel, Dean hums.
"Do you prefer to be the big spoon or little spoon?" Castiel interrupts curiously as he shimmies out of his pants. "I'm fine with either."
"Why are you still here? You ain't on the clock and I don't need you watchin' over me like a fuckin' toddler."
Castiel's chest warms and he taps his finger against the leaking rim, a string of slick clinging to his finger when he pulls. Dean jerks his hips and makes a keening noise in the back of his throat. Castiel rubs the rim before slowly inserting his finger.
"How you been, Dean?" Ellen asks, eyes soft and worried but scent dulled so Dean can't scent her openly. He shrugs and averts his eyes.
Lucifer faces forward again and they sit in a comfortable silence. Charlie is still snoring away in the back but the sound of crickets and the feel of the road underneath the tires make Dean relax in his seat.
"Hey fellas," Dean rests his arms on the free space on his door. The group of men take a quick glance at Dean yet only one steps forward.
Dean closes his eyes tightly, fisting the heels of his palms into them before taking a few deep breaths and forcing his lead-like limbs to Castiel's room.
Dean takes another drag and leans his head against the back of the bench, feeling his lungs deflate and seeing the smoke dance with the snowflakes. His eyes jump around at the sky while he thinks.
The pond looks mesmerizing; it's this swirling, bright hue of blue that makes Dean's heartbeat faster and the palms of his hands go damp with nerves. It's colder then usual, the hairs on Dean's arm raise and he can feel the tips of his ears go red with the chill.
"I know." Dean frowns, putting away the bags. "Go shower so Eileen doesn't smell your B.O and regret dating your ass." Dean snaps, trying hard to weave humor into his voice but now he's agitated and a sudden wave of sadness creeps up to his throat.
I like Dean with longish hair and for visual pleasure, here is an amazing fanart that represents what he looks like in the story. Also! Sam and Dean are born Canadian, I don't believe I was ever going to specify that so, just so ya know!
Ophelia meows loudly, pale eyes wide and dark fur covered buy a small winter coat and booties, sniffing in the direction of Miracle who's tail wags excitedly as she waits patiently for Ophelia to sniff her. Miracle gets a little two excited and paws at Ophelia aggressively and Ophelia hisses, swatting at empty air in retaliation.
"The Mark of Cain." Eve confirms. "Don't you know there's a plant that causes poison but also heals it? It's like that. Anything the Mark fuses with wants to kill, corrupt, it will fuse with the essence and kill the bad components."
Castiel can't breathe. The heaving, gasping breaths that enter him only make his lungs smaller and his head light and dizzy.
Dean could've been a better brother if he's honest. How weak was he not to handle a couple of hits from the old man? So what? It's called discipline, his body has deemed it normal no matter if his mind says otherwise. If he just dealt with it until Sammy was of legal age to leave then why didn't he?
It's true, him and Castiel haven't been on speaking terms since that night. It's not like Dean is particularly worried, Castiel isn't his main priority, Sam is.
Mary mutters as she shuffles the papers in a neat file. Dean's eyebrow twitches downward and he looks between the two of his parents. John lowers his head.
"Not if Father does it willingly." Gabriel says. At the silence following his statement, he continues. "Lucifer isn't able to get it, I don't want it, Michael doesn't want any part of it, Castiel was basically forced with this, if he says he doesn't want to do it anymore then Father would go to his next trusted which would be—"
She got too sick and Dean was sent off to Bobby's. Sam was with John during that time if Dean remembers correctly; back then Omegas were only allowed custody of the eldest child while the other one went with the Alpha.
Sensitive bodies, sensitive nerves, touching and the warmth of it all; it makes the jealously in Dean's stomach light on fire.
Castiel knew when the human first shined light onto the world, a lighter lit his heart from the inside and his grace strengthened. He has waited Eons to meet this person but he guesses he may never get the chance if Lucifer decides to keep him or hide him from the world forever.
Sadness goes hand in hand with guilt most often than not, he realizes; that the two are attached to the hip and guilt hammers inside his damaged brain because maybe he forgot to wash the dishes after John told him too.
Castiel smells nice, it's a scent burned into his nostrils like how assembling a gun is muscle memory. He can't forget it; a rainforest that Dean hasn't stained with blood of others; one with exotic fruits and animals; one that doesn't suffer from deforestation and is lush and lively. Like home, something that Dean has always thought of as disgusting and repulsive.
"You know, I'm not the best at tests, I'll get the sweats. Also Thules here usually carries me over his shoulder!" Aaron boasts as he pats Thules' shoulder.
Castiel nips at the burn, grumbling and growling as he slides in and out of Dean, long strings of slick becoming squished between their skin. Castiel gently brings a hand to Dean's hip, leaning back on his calves and pulling Dean with him to sit on his cock.
"I was going to be gentle," Dean sighs, sliding off the desk carefully, he pats Castiel's hair and coos. "But how can I when you look like this?"
Large, towering trees crowd the grassy area and wrap around the area like a circle; moss latches onto the bark of logs and exposed trunks; wind makes his dress sway in front of him and enhance the organic smell of growing flowers; sunlight streams through the leaves and beats on the nape of Dean's neck while grass tickles his ankles. A few birds fly overhead, the occasional day cricket's song, and scavenging squirrels.
Castiel chuckles sadly and tilts his head back. "I couldn't. I wanted to tell you so you would hate me then but I couldn't. If I told you then I would have to talk about me and–"
"T-there!" Dean gasps as he clenches and rides Castiel's fingers, they jab and poke at his prostate causing his cock to leak profusely and his nails dig into Castiel's scalp. "More, more more, please."
Dean stares at the island, his appetite suddenly gone yet raging and he crosses his ankles and stuffs his mouth.
Dean's hands scramble and take purchase of the cover below him and wrings his hands in the fabric. Castiel's thrusts are brutal, they hit his prostate dead-on which leads his body to quiver and melt into the mattress.
Eve's fists clench by her sides and a low rumble, a sound he can't hear but feel, vibrates Dean's body. "WAKE HIM!"
"Charlie will be safe in the car. Let's just hope we don't get our asses killed." Dean mutters as he and Lucifer exit the car.
Castiel remembers when he was strong, oh god, his true form was gorgeous. His four heads, all seeing and observing, and six heavy-set, raven wings that could carry him anywhere and everywhere. The grace that branched out onto his chest and glowed, and his body, Castiel sighs wistfully, his large, capable, body that could protect anybody.
"Remember you thought I was in the Mafia and your brother hire investigator." Castiel teases and Dean grimaces "Don't remind me."
"I'm sorry. I get like this sometimes, I–" he sounds disappointed and his scent goes from a lush rainforest to one that has just been burned to the ground.
Dean's phone buzzing in his back pocket is what brings him back to reality. He blinks a few times, moving his legs so he can sit on one of the lobby chairs then fishes for his phone.
Dean raises his hand lazily and the man's lips quirk as he tips his head forward. Dean puts his hand down awkwardly as a tingle crawls up his spine and he starts Baby with shaky hands, not bothering to put his dick back in his pants, feeling that same tingle even as he exits the store.
Dean blinks and before he gets the chance to answer, Castiel has already turned around and picked up the lump of sheets from the floor.
"Who's the fresh meat?" Dorothy raises her eyebrows, downing the rest of the shared drink between her and Charlie.
"Do you still–love, I mean–do you?" Castiel stammers, sounding thick and broken. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel's waist and lays his head on the bloody back.
Parents are supposed to be, well, parents. They're supposed to provide, support, raise, and love their children. In some instances, a scary amount of instances actually, some parents fall short. They neglect, abuse, and abandon. There's a certain group though, ones who also suffer from the abusive tendencies of the breadwinner, the dominant, which is most stereotypically the male. That group of people, Dean thinks, are the most pitiful. Maybe he's a little biased. A little hurt.
Dean sits cross-legged on the cliff, not paying any mind to heavy drizzle falling above him or to the fact that his clothes have stuck wet and heavy against his body.
The black folder lies there as if it isn't holding important information that could make or break millions of people's lives. That's this person's endgame, right? To ruin all organic life.
Castiel uses the time to take deep, grounding breaths, ones that Gabriel had taught him when they had both squeezed themselves into empty confession booths, and waits until he hears Dean pour a second cup of coffee before opening the door.
A curious knock sounds on Dean's door and his cock gives a violent jerk before spilling messily onto the forest green sheets. Tears gather in Dean's eyes and he sucks in his bottom lip as he stares at the mess.
The rest of his family's grace thumps excitedly throughout the room. Everyone loves Father but they've seen how unhappy he has become so to pass down power is seen as a revolution of sorts.
Blood coats the underside of Castiel's nails as he takes deep, shuddering breaths. "Apologies, Dean. I-"
Curious hands trail down Dean's body and into the water that surrounds them; they slide down the curve of Dean's back and over his ass to reach the hem of his dress. Castiel pulls back but Dean chases his lips with a frustrated whine and Castiel gives him a chaste peck to settle him.
, yeah, that's it, keep doin' it like that." Dean encourages, wiggles and pushes his finger upwards before groaning and pushing another finger in. Castiel's blushes at the awkward noises, wants to hide that its dick is dripping with precum because of it.
"C'mon, kiss me," Dean urges as he cups Castiel's neck and brings their lips together. Castiel rolls his hips slowly, something he'd seen on The Pizza Man video that Charlie showed him, he must be doing it right because Dean's grip on his thigh and neck tighten.
"We're sure you can treat us just right." Dum husks, dropping his hand down and grasping a handful of plush meat. Dean sucks in his bottom lip between his teeth and tightens his grip on Dee's arm.
Castiel sets his phone down, gets up, and collects his plant supplies that are stored underneath his bed in a medium set box.
When Dean's brain is cleared, he's under a thick comforter with his throat not as parched as it had been earlier; his hole is sore as well as his hips.
"He doesn't love me." Dean admits, voice thick with hatred and shame. "How," Dean wipes his eyes aggressively.
He remembers the feeling deep in his guts when John had just too much alcohol in his system; felt it in the many bruises and cuts that he was decorated with
"How embarrassing." she croaks lowly. "Lower beings never learn, do they? They come and demand and act like we owe them something. I've been here longer than she's been alive!" Eve hollers, spit flying out of her mouth which makes Dean flinch back. Eve straightens herself and turns her head towards Lucifer.
Colt pulls Jess into an awkward, clumsy hug which Jess doesn't reciprocate and she gathers her coat in her hand with a teary goodbye to Colt.
Dean starts thrusting their hips faster. "You see me as someone dependable, someone that'll treat you right, hm? Someone who'll make your little cock weep?" he husks in Castiel's ear.
