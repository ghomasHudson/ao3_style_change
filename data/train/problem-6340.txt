Suddenly Tony put the bowl down kicking off the covers, he scrambled out of bed nearly falling to his knees before reaching the bathroom and a second later they could all hear the retching as tony threw up the only food he had eaten in a long time.
The next day took a turn when Tony stayed back sitting in his chair as the class cleared out after the bell. He didn’t say anything, so Steve just went back to grading his papers .
“Don’t beat yourself about it cap, she’s fine. Just bummed that fury pulled her out early” that sounds like natasha but he knew it was his fault. He owed it to his team to look out for them.
"Who the fuck do you think you are!" Steve jolted at the voice his head snapping up to see the commotion happening in his class. He shouldn't have been surprised that one of the parties involved was Tony and the other was ofcourse the other bratty kid Ty stone. Pepper was trying to pry Tony away from the other kid who only looked smug and Steve wanted to knock him in the head. To be honest steve never liked that kid, he was snobbish and bratty and caused unnecessary trouble.
“no, don’t touch me! Is he dead? Just tell me if he’s dead” Tony’s voice was trembling and broken and Steve knew exactly what was happening with him. He unfroze , running through the door that divided them , his heart breaking at the scene .
“what I think is a fifteen year old should be kissing other fifteen year olds. I thought you were a genius” he smiled at Tony ,dropped his hand and took a step back.
“I really hope so. He’s young he can cope. He just needs some support from people he trusts that’s all.”
On my right was Tasha with her hand running through my hair. And Bruce was sitting on a chair next to my bed. All three in a somewhat serious discussion they didn't notice me awake. So I kept still trying to hear what they were saying.
“he’s not breathing right, he needs to be on oxygen.” Bruce said and steve looked up alarmed as Bruce explained “ sounded like he swallowed a lot of the ocean water, his lungs are compromised. He probably already has an infection which is why he is wheezing. He’s going to wear himself out at this rate. Did he feel warm to you?” he asked steve as everyone sat more upright in their chairs with full attention.
Eyes swollen,  puffy like he has been crying for days. He looked thinner or maybe it was the shirt he was wearing that was too large. His fingers were trembling as they hovered above Steve’s chest.
“Tony was already here drinking , when we came no one asked us anything. I think its because Tony tipped them a lot of money" Steve pursed his lips and took a deep breath. He knew this age all too well, he couldn’t really blame them for wanting to do these things but yet it irritated him that Tony was making these choices.
“I need you to sit down with me and nat and answer a few questions for us" tony was shaking his even before Steve was done talking
“His vitals are normal" bruce said in the background and everyone let out a breath they didn’t even know they were holding. The nurses left quickly after Bruce reassured them that he would stay.
“its okay sweetheart  you did really good okay? And trust it me when I say this , it was really good for me too" tony scoffed and frowned not believing him.
“Please Bruce,  he’s dealing with some things now and I need to know someone is looking out for him"
“hey baby!” steve announced as he walked into tonys room after not having seen him for a few hours now. He was met with a grouchy Tony who threw the little empty jello cup at Steve for no reason whatsoever.
“Am good" he said his voice shaky before he blinked it open for the second time that day trying to clear his vision.
“Mr Rogers, I understand that you want to give them something different, but these are teenagers we are talking about. It would be unnecessary trouble” Steve nodded his lips pursed as he calmly tried to explain to the principal why this was not so bad an idea
“You ready to go?” he asked tony who was still wilted at the table , natasha looked pointedly at him before getting as well
“How can you say that? Of course I worry" Tony’s eyes were imploring and Steve sighed and pulled Tony back to him while Tony tucked his hands between their bodies.
“I wont bite, you can come in” he chuckled as Tony’s eyes widened at not realizing that Steve had seen him .
It hurt to think that Steve wanted tony to be cautious of him, because he didn’t trust himself to be able to control himself.
“Please tell me he is not naked” she asked but sat down anyway and Steve pulled the covers up higher to Tony’s chin.
“No" he groaned and Steve wondered when things had changed so much that Tony had actually wanted to sleep these days.
Natasha dropped his shoes in front of him ,just as he was about to ask where they went. “thanks" he said quickly pulling them on.
"Steve I have been up for the past 32 hours, so of course I am tired. Nothing is wrong. Bruce tell him I am fine" I told him quickly before he could say anything about me laying still. Clint and Nat chose that moment to come back into my line of vision holding various things.
“That is a hall pass to the nurse, not a pass for lingering in the hallway is it? Is there a reason you are not at the nurses office ?” Steve asked and tony glared at him slightly
“what’s going on tony?” He asked moving to crouch on the floor in front of tony. Yesterday tony had refused to let Steve out of his sight clinging to him like a toddler. He knows tony was in shock after that blast but this was a drastic change from yesterday. He was also very acutely aware of Tony’s ‘no touching’ statement. It had worried him when he said it yesterday and it worried him even more today.
"I'll leave once the armor is off." He said with no place for arguments. I sighed as I nodded up again at jarvis to continue removing the armor. All pieces came off on the right side with ease but the left one's were painful. Should have listened to jarvis and taken the analgesic. But since Bruce was here for the show, I hid the pain as well as I could and winked at him once the chest plate was out.
”okay, we will talk more about that later. But right now I need to know if I should be taking you to the hospita-“ tony moved startlingly fast, he was unsteady on his feet and Steve caught him easily pushing him back into the couch hands on either side of him gripping the cushions.
“No I am sorry Steve I will sleep as soon as you leave. Please tell me when i can see you again" atleast one good thing came out of his anger and Tony was actually planning to take care of himself even if it was only to please Steve.
“Well guess the cats out of the bag now, great going tasha" Clint punched her lightly on the arm and settled down on the foot end of Tony’s bed and natasha walked over to the little table that held all the medical equipment.
Tony refused to go to medical, he wanted to see his friends and it was his birthday and Steve couldn’t deny him that.
Steve was going to miss his short summer break. I mean don’t get him wrong ,he loved his job, but anyone would need a break from being around hormonal teenagers all year. This year’s break was perfect, normally there was always a long mission that would ruin his downtime . But finally, for once, thank Thor! fury hadn’t needed him on anything other than his occasional shield training programmes and such and no aliens had decidedly crashed his summer break.
“Okay honey, you want to go back to the bed?” he shook his head , his eyes were wide and terrified and steve didn’t know what to do.
“Oh, you think you are ready?” He asked amused at just how much Tony had changed from the first time Steve had laid his hands on him and now.
The water was cold, Steve’s metabolism mostly keeping him from shivering . But that didn’t mean that he didn’t feel the cold sinking into his skin. It was dark and he couldn’t see past the glass of the cockpit. The pressure weighing him down was stifling but he couldn’t go anywhere. The fear gripping at him as he realized what he had just done.
I jerked out from under the covers. Steve startled and moved to stabilize the mug he had picked up again .But Natasha was quicker and calmer she put her hand around my neck pulling me back into her embrace. " you are okay Tony" she said softly.
And Steve laughed relief flooding him as he realized the stupid reason why Tony had been refusing to see her. It was also the first time Tony showed his childlike side and Steve decided to just do it himself.
Steve watched the brunette storm out the door and stubbornly stood rooted in place forcing himself not to go after tony because he knew his anger was not something tony deserved just after what he had let steve do to him hours prior.
“ever since Bucky came back into my life, or the choice I made that day when Bucky was choking him right in front of my eyes , he has been afraid I’ll choose Bucky over him. And if I tell him now that Bucky murdered his parents, he won’t be okay with that.” Natasha’s face showed no surprise,  infact it was Steve who was surprised that she already seemed to know
“trouble breathing?” Steve asked as casually as possible careful not to scare his boyfriend away from all the medical questions. He shrugged again opened his eyes and smirked , “I swallowed some water, it be like that sometimes" he said before pushing back from the chair to get up pulling steve with him. Steve rolled his eyes as he followed him out of the room.
“Tasha!” pushing himself upright with steves chest as the support he pushed off the covers so he could hug her but realized midway that he was only clad in his boxers and his dress shirt hanging off his shoulders.
“What did he give you tony?do you know what it was?” Tony shook his head no looking more uncomfortable as all all eyes turned on him.
" friend tony, do you have a spare reactor on you right now?" I nodded my head no, unable to speak since I was gritting my teeth so hard from the pain that's was shuddering through me in waves.
Tony didn’t move to leave as expected and pepper and Rhodes were talking to him in hushed tones while tony only ignored them. After a few minutes , pepper sighed looking behind at Steve resignation and worry masking her face. Steve nodded at her and she seemed to understand immediately as she whispered something in Rhodes ear and they left silently leaving the two of them alone.
“ but for now , let’s just let it be what it is okay?” and he felt Tony nod against his chest and finally Steve asked him
He kissed his way down, leaving a trail of red skin as he went lower to Tony abdomen and then lower and Tony’s hands found Steve hair clutching tight enough for it to hurt.
“he found some good friends" steve cracked a smile at that. It was true , he was really glad for those two right now.
“James Buchanan barnes ,aka bucky was my bestfriend before your dad. We served in the military together, before the serum. We always , always had each others backs no matter what. Bucky and my mum were the only two people I have ever loved in my life.” Tony's eyes snapped up to meet Steve's
“Honey, go with him. This is going to take quiet a while okay? Do you need to be checked over by a doctor?” he asked eyeing the gash once again but didn’t want to push him right now.
Steve kissed the small frown on Tony's forehead and resumed brushing his fingers through Tony's hair feeling Tony sigh and relax completely.
He took the remaining steps quietly so as not startle the boy awake and crouched down in front of him.
He smirked, putting away the hall pass and continued stacking his papers when something dawned on him. If tony still had the hall pass with him, that meant he hadn’t actually gone to nurse. He had lied to Steve.
“Good morning,” she said “steve we need to talk to you, asap" see normally she would be more subtle, but the panic in her eyes was unsettling and Steve gently pulled the covers firmly around Tony,
"so where is Bruce?" he asked avoiding looking at me, the guilt was ripping me apart now. I didn't like when Tony went from being his normal cocky confident man I love to this nervous quiet Tony.
He didn’t know if having sex with Tony was the right or wrong thing to have done and even before they could actually talk about it, the reactor had happened and Steve’s mind was all over the place.  He didn’t know if he was hurt because Tony chose to push him away after they had made love or if he was worried about Tony being sick or if he was afraid that stane would find a way to hurt him.
Once inside , Steve led Tony by his elbow over to the couch and gently pushed him into it. Tony went willingly, the one good thing about Steve’s furniture were that they were all slightly larger and bigger to fit Steve’s physique. So the couch was big enough to engulf both Steve and allow Tony to lay down comfortably.
“Bre-atthng" he said the word broken and Steve leaned down kissing him on his shoulder and told him how good he was being in between kisses. Tony responded beautifully to praises ,his breaths slowing and his chest finally expanding as his closed airway opened up for him to breathe again.
“Okay bud, hop on.” He said patting the bed and Tony took an uneasy step towards the door, and Steve took his hand and walked him to the bed. He sat down his feet stayed firmly on the floor while Steve toed his own shoes off and sat down beside him.
“hawkeye! Holy shit, are you guys for real holy shirt” he said as he shifted on the bed now very excited, all traces of fear and fatigue erased.
“Tasha huh? Since when are you both on a nickname basis?” he said tilting his head at the nervous teen.
“can we come in?the food is getting cold.” Clint said poking his head through the door. Impeccable timing.
“Stevie, it looks to me like he has a lot of good people to fall back on, tell him.” Bucky said but that was the problem wasn’t it? Steve’s best friend , the one tony is afraid of losing Steve to is the one who murdered his parents.
“teenager problems” he sighed as Steve lifted an eyebrow in amusement. These were always fun to listen to as long as said teenager was not your problem. He put the sandwich down and straightened up looking at Steve.
“This okay?” he asked as pulling back and Tony’s mouth stretched into the widest smile he had seen in a really long time and just as Tony tried to kiss him again Steve held his face away and said “ I need to hear it sweetheart, is this okay?”
“Okay, I get it. I am going to let it slide because I know what it’s like to be your age. But that doesn’t mean I agree with your choices” he tried to be chastising, and Tony smirking behind them was not helping Steve keep a straight face in reprimanding them.
“Cap was the reason he is not pulp, it was mere coincidence that tony was taking the subway at that very moment. And if some other agent had been placed instead of cap, both of them would have been dead.” Steve didn’t even want to imagine that scenario. The thought of tony currently passed out on the bed after having a terrifying panic attack with a concussion in itself was suffice to to make Steve feel loathe.
"Where is the man of iron? Or must I say the man lacking iron?" Thor has been spending too much time with Darcy. Clint snickered at that.
He frowned , not entirely comprehending “give tony to me" he felt his arms unconsciously tightening around the teen as he watched natasha take a measured step into the shower in front of them and reach for Tony but Steve wasn’t going to let go.
“How is that possible, and how can he frame me? I am not even in the picture and obie wouldn’t do that to me” tony had been in denial for the past half hour and they had repeated it over and over again until he seemed to accept it.
“that’s not how this works tony, you know that” Steve was surprised at the last argument, he had expected more snippy smart retorts but he wasn’t prepared for this kind of pleading,
“okay. How about you do this and I let you help me in the lab?” well, if only bruce had offered this earlier,  everything would have gone a lot smoother. Because tony accepted that offer so quickly, everybody sighed in relief as he stopped fighting Steve’s hold and finally held still.
“Well, maybe if you conveniently forget to ask for it tomorrow in class then no I don’t have any homework” he said turning to face Steve his eyes imploring .
Steve was so confused , he didn’t know what had changed so suddenly that tony seemed to be trusting him completely. Okay well not completely, he had still not told Steve what had actually happened. But it was a start, his mind was
“You are okay Tony, it’s only to help you breathe, we will have it out in a minute. You with me?” tony calmed relatively fast and settled for clutching at Steve’s hand weakly physically unable to put up a fight.
How had no one been paying any attention to how sick he actually was? Or was this the effect of him learning that Steve was dead and the stress of being told otherwise had gotten to him?
“You play right? With the coach? I have heard a lot of the students talk about how good you are. You should come play! You don’t have a class when I have gym right?” tony sounded so excited and Steve smiled at him
“We can’t do that,  he deserves to know Steve. I know you want to protect him from the information but he needs to know.” Natasha said gently
Nat and I decided to get refreshed and watch a movie while waiting for Tony Bruce and thor to return. Thor was probably to go back to jane's though. She always insisted that he see her as soon as the debrief. I understood that, just the same way I needed to see Tony now and make sure he is alright. I walked up to our room, upon entering there were two things I spotted immediately – 1)the bed was unkempt, which meant the call for the team had happened when Tony had just woken up or still sleeping. And 2)the iron pills I had left for Tony on the nightstand still remained in the exact same place I left it. Which meant he has not had any form of iron supplements in the past two days.
“What happened? Did someone hurt you?” he asked as he gave him a quick once over but found nothing more than a few grease stains here and there.
“Language” Steve chastised as tony bent down picking up his books and Steve picked up one that had fallen by his feet. It was a big one, heavy and Steve pursed his lips as he read the title ‘mechanics in engineering’ he handed the book over silently wondering why he was reading a book that was college level.
Tony relaxed slightly and he smiled against Steve’s lips as he leaned forward again “tomorrow, I promise I’ll tell you tomorrow” he said
She reached out and put her hand on his “maybe that’s what he needs steve,” she said softly and Steve knew that she was right but he just couldn’t.
"Tony, hey can you open your eyes? Look at me please. Can you tell me what's wrong?" No Bruce, I just want to sleep.
“Tony?” he called softly not wanting to touch because Steve had seen that drawn out look on his face before and it could only mean one thing , he was having some kind of panic attack or nightmare judging by how he was asleep.
He could feel the sudden desperation in his movements as Tony continued to frantically grasp at Steve’s pants his breaths turning into pants.
He woke to a scream, a shrill blood curdling scream and his flight or fight response kicked in so fast he was on his feet hands in battle stance before he had even blinked once.
“he just needs some people he can trust, he’s young. He will cope” Steve said as optimistic but unsure of himself.
A confirmation Steve never thought would ever be true. Because Howard’s little boy died in the car crash with his parents 15 years ago. Steve was there for the funeral. A year after which Steve had crashed his plane into he arctic.
Tony looked at him before taking it and opened it to reveal two dog tags with etchings on them. Steve took it from his fingers and put them around his neck, the two metals clinking against each other
“oh thank god!” he heard her exclaim “ Rhodey he’s on the line!” he heard her say away from the phone
I could hear Bruce walking back into the room and my breaths turned into short gasps. Steve pressed his lips to the side of my head "You are okay tony, This will only take a minute and then we can go back to watching the movie." He whispered. "deep breathes, honey" he kept muttering comforting things as I pushed back into Steve's chest as much as possible trying to hide from the needle Bruce was now carrying towards me.
"Yeah I think you got that right. Come here, tony" he said more firmly and Tony adjusted the sweatshirt around his hips and shuffled over reluctantly. He stayed a few feet away from Steve's reach and steve rolled his eyes at him turning back to the other two.
“Here , you always feel better after I show you all my injuries right?” he asked thinking back to how everytime Tony asked to see if he was okay and that always seemed to ease the tension out if him.
"What's going on?" He asked while tony seemed to only get more nervous now that Steve was here. Clint looked up at Steve and the tension in his eyes alerted steve to pay more attention.
Tony although had other things in his mind , he pulled the covers away letting it careless entangle in his legs and he moved to get up , the sheets tangled in his legs making him lose his footing and Steve was forced to grab him around the waist to keep him from toppling over. Before he could let go, Tony’s fingers latched onto his shoulders, nails digging into skin as he held on as tightly as possible
“Okay, that’s okay. But if you ever need to , I am here” he said as he secured the wrap with the pins.
"Uhm, excuse me captain, there is a girl named pepper trying to reach you on your phone" Fury gave him a dirty look but Steve ignored him as he got up and walked out of the room suddenly concerned and confused how she got his number and why she was calling.
“what injuries do you have? Let me see how bad it is" he said nervously and Steve realized that all this time all Tony wanted to do was make sure Steve was okay because he still hadn’t wrapped his mind over the idea of Steve, his history teacher, was captain America. And the last time he had seen Steve, he had been probably bleeding everywhere and knocked unconscious.
“can you breathe for me?” Tony looked like he was zoning in and out of reality still processing things.
“You have come this far Tony, do you want this the reason to be why you couldn’t go through the surgery? There are scarier things happening don’t let this be the thing that scares you. Come on honey” she said rubbing gentle circles on his back.
“Where is the child?” thor asked and Steve was about to point to space on the bed next to him when he realized that Tony was not there. Panic gripped him like a vice and it took another shake from Clint to snap out of it.
"That's between you and tony" he dismissed knowing tony has been the one to eat all of the ice cream just to spite clint.
“Is she going to be alright?” the gym teacher asked and he nodded as he helped her onto one of the beds and handed her a bottle of water.
“Okay , come on. Bruce you want to join us?” he asked as Tony handed over something for him to carry. It looked like a mini microwave but Steve had long since learnt not to ask.
So that left him in the here and now with natasha and Clint who had sat with him stubbornly even when Steve had told then it’s okay for them to go do their things. Two hours in, clint had picked up rhodey and pepper from school because they wanted to be there.
“Okay okay, calm down sweetheart,  take some deep breaths for me come on. See I am putting it down" he said dropped the syringe with the local anesthetic and Tony looked at him with pleading wide eyes shining with unshed tears.
“Tony let’s get you something to eat okay? I am sure the others have somethings to discuss and you dont need that on your mind right now" Natasha told him holding out a hand and for once Tony didnt argue and he silently left with her, the sheet pulled all the way upto his chin and the tail of it dragging on the floor. Steve would have laughed at the sight if not for what he had just been told.
“I couldn’t sleep, so I went down to fix your microwave" and Steve sighed in relief closing his eyes for a brief second and it only lasted a second because Tony also apparently remembered the sedation
“What are we gonna do?” He Asked pulling his legs up, siting cross legged as he dropped his bag down onto the floor carelessly. Steve picked it up and put it on the center table.
“Look at me sweetheart, please" the tears fell as he lifted his head but neither did anything about it.
“Stane was afraid you would get hurt, and that’s exactly what happened. We are only looking out for you and he knows best what you need to protect you” he shook his head , biting his lower lip drawing blood and Steve wanted to stop him from hurting himself further.
By the time both of them collapsed into bed after an exhaustive day Tony had extricated every but of detail possible from him about the mission and every time Steve tried to hide something from him like how dangerous the alien weapons they were dealing with were he would pout and sulk until Steve told him.
well that is until Tony doesn’t actually do anything about it or if something happens to the kid Steve would step-in in a heartbeat no matter what it does to their relationship.  Because making sure Tony was alright was number one priority.
“how the hell did you think you could keep this from me?” Steve asked as he threw the file that Bruce had given him after lunch on tony. There was a picture of the teen, he was not more than twelve years old in it and it only made Steve more angry to think this child had to grow up without his parents.
“Tony. I need you to take deep breaths okay? In and out. Come on you can do this.” Tony simply shook his head  the panic taking over.
“okay" steve said squaring his shoulders “you are saying tony has a life threatening heart condition that he doesn’t know about, underwent surgery at the age of one, very conveniently after I went into the ice. And stane had Bucky murder howard and maria so he could get his hands on the tech?” he summed up and watched as the two nodded
“Mr. Rogers?” steve snapped back to reality as he turned to look at the girl, blonde hair, green eyes. She was very pretty , with her bangs falling over her face and that sly smile they all always gave him when they were trying so hard to flirt with him. He knew all the girls pinned over him, they asked stupid doubts just so Steve would talk to them and it was well, steve couldn’t blame anyone really. They were just kids. Like tony.
“Pepper go call Dr.Banner and tell he needs to be here with Tony when stane  arrives, Rhodey stay with Tony. I am going to be right around the corner okay? I don’t want him to see me with you”
“he already knows who you are, do you think he will be okay just leaving now?” Tony was going to hate him for leaving him like this without a goodbye. But it was something he could live with knowing tony was indeed safe and away from everything shield related.
“oh, is that not illegal on midgard? To be courting a minor?” Steve groaned wondering why thor even knew these midgardian rules.
steve was feeling a little surreal, pinching himself every few minutes to remind him that he had indeed had his hands on the bare chested teen. He was also trying very hard to forget it, it didn’t make any sense in his head either.
“That’s just the problem, they get into trouble when they are bored.” Well can't really argue there Steve thought.
“Hey Tony” she said softly getting his attention to shift again “did you know that if you persuade Steve enough he might let you have some yoghurt?” tony frowned as he looked around for the yogurt and Steve just stared at them unable to do much other than hold Tony.
“Do you understand now, that when you go home to someone I know has hurt you in more ways than one and has the access to do so at anytime , that I am always ,” he emphasized again “always worried about you?”
"As much fun as these boring parties can get" he replied before yawning and snuggling into me. I put my arm around him and pulled him closer to me letting him rest his head on my shoulder. He was asleep before we reached the Highway.
He was mentally prepared to dive back into academics , even though he has enjoyed the break, Steve needed to work or he was never at peace with his mind.
“He wants me to pick him up" he got a few odd stares from the nurses but none from Bruce or natasha.
“I am trying but you have to tell me what’s wrong” he asked again and by now silent tears were falling across his cheeks.
He sat down on the couch next to him and Tony immediately curled into his side seeking more warmth and Steve smiled at his lover , he looked absolutely peaceful and stress free, his cheeks slightly flushed and hair askew.
"Is everything alright with the man of iron?" Thor who had been watching the scene unfold silently so far finally spoke up. Steve looked up at everyone's face for the first
What he saw was definitely one of the most adorably moments he had had with Tony. He was half sitting , half sliding off the counter next to the basin toothbrush in hand , eyes closed and cheeks flushed from the hot shower. He only had a towel around his torso , his pale skin a stark contrast against the black marble of the counter.
“What’s wrong? Does it hurt? Are you alright?” he asked swiping his thumb across Tony’s cheek and he shook his head
“I don’t feel like doing it with anyone but you" he said and Steve could tell he was drifting off as his voice faded with the sentence.
It had been an eventful two days. It was refreshing to be able to teach a fresh set of minds a few basic battle skills. Nat had especially loved the way she could boss around everyone with just her glare (even I could not handle the glare)
For a second steve was confused as to what Tony was referring to and then Tony pointed to the cut along his cheek and Steve made an “ah" sound clearly surprised that Tony had been the one to start a conversation this time. Tony grinned at him ,winked and shuffled out the door.
“my mind does this thing sometimes , where it doesn’t stop. It’s too loud you know?” Steve had seen this before , he should have known this happens with Tony as well.
“Good to know.” Tony nodded tucking his hands between Steve’s and his chest. Steve felt his forehead, his skin still worryingly hot to the touch.
“Go back to sleep Tony” tony ignored him and stretched as much as he was able to , and turned to look at bruce.
“and I know you told me that people who hurt you are not family but I feel like I don’t have anyone and I-”
“ and with steve not being there , I just wanted to keep an eye on you" she said gauging his reaction
“Tony, I need you to look at me please" this time Tony did open his eyes and his pupils were blown and Steve leaned forward capturing his parted lips , letting the moans die in his throat.
He asked them and they did as told understanding that Steve was asking for some privacy. Steve picked up the mask and held in front of Tony not wanting to force it on him.
"You can do it yourself , think you can do that? I'll take you back to my place and we can work it out"
“Wha-?” Tony started to say but Steve had captured both of Tony’s hands stilling his fingers within one large hand of his and used the other one to comb through his hair careful not to mess it up.
Tony didn’t last even twenty minutes. Even those twenty minutes Steve had to continuously push him harder to make it. He was panting and huffing glaring at Steve as he waited for Tony to catch up to him. Steve made sure that Tony was always within his visible sight because it was now completely dark outside and he didn’t like the idea of Tony being left alone. For him this was like taking a walk in the park but atleast it put Tony to work.
“we won’t do anything you don’t want to do, just enough to help you okay? Please baby , let me help” he tried again but this time Tony physically pushed his hands away
Tony stiffened at the name, clearly not happy and he crawled back towards Steve who opened his arms for him.
“Steve no, what will I tell obie . I cant just disappear from home for five days!” he said his voice raising and Steve smiled at him “you will tell him that you have homework , which I am sure you have. Or I can give you, if you want"
Steve rocked his hips upwards and Tony gasped  and let out an obscene sound that Steve would never forget. He unzipped his pants to release his own aching member
Bruce was absolutely right, tony was smart and it showed in his work. The paper was well worded and the arguments were so well written that Steve read it twice just to confirm.
“What does she mean hurt him? When did you hurt him?” Bruce’s entire demeanor towards Bucky changed and Steve stuck between the need to defend his friend and to be angry at him.
“Stand down.” He ordered through the comms and he ignored the sounds of protest as he slowly stepped forward not even aware he was doing it until he was standing face to face with none other than Bucky.
“our job, at shield is dangerous tony. It’s not your everyday police and thief story. It’s real and innocent people always end up getting hurt. We don’t want that person to be you”
“sorry” he said putting his hands up “but I am serious about the alcohol Tony. Wait a few years, it wont kill you” tony pouted some more
“Pepper has excellent penmanship” he said instead and Steve blinked twice before it registered. He got up from his chair, moving around his desk to walk over to tony. It took him a good few seconds to carefully formulate what he was going to say next, because he knew if he said the wrong thing then tony would get defensive.
“I made this thing, its not the best yet but let me get it please wait just one second “ tony stumbled over his words as he ran out of the room and Steve stood tapping his foot the nervous energy getting to him
Steve had a pretty clear idea of what he might be dealing with here. But just to make sure he waited till Tony looked at him
“Its okay, Its only a ten minute drive. Besides no one is going to catch captain America and give him a ticket.” He said smirking as he caught the look on Tony’s face in the mirror.
Steve pinched himself, hard. He was most certainly not dreaming and Tony was really stood up on the edge of the kitchen counter in his pink , now painted with black smudges in the common floor , literally where anyone could walk in at any moment. The clock on the wall read a blaring four AM and Steve rubbed his palms over his eyes again checking to see if his vision was failing him. But no, there stood Tony in his underwear doing something to the microwave with a screwdriver in his mouth.
“only steve gets hugs after a battle huh? What about me , did you see my ankle? The poor thing" she said tilting her head slightly trying hard to keep from smiling at the cowering teen.
Technically steve and Tony should be leaving for school but Steve had actually wanted to take the day off with him and his team and figure out the details. It was also Tony’s birthday.
“Hey" he said sitting next to him. Tony giggled as Steve tickled him on his side pushing his hand away
“escort him outside, I don’t want you leaving his side for even a second. We will meet you once this is wrapped up.” He commanded
“He is on his way sir ,he was in California on business when we called him. Another two hours maybe”
“We are hoping to figure it out today" he nodded at them getting up from the table taking his leave and before he left the room he said “if you need me , give me a call"
“I don’t know what’s going on with you, but until you tell me ,we are not doing this” he said as he pushed himself away careful to avoid touching any part of Tony as he let go of his wrists and pulled up his pants over his now throbbing erection.
“They only know about the physical abuse and they have been letting him stay over at their place as much as possible.”
"I am still worried" Nat whispered so tony wouldn't hear "Have Jarvis call me if you need me" she said kissing my cheek before walking out.
Tony grabbed the book quickly, muttered a ‘sorry’ , his lower lip subjected to abuse from his teeth and quickly made his way around Steve , heading off to wherever he was going to.
So far all he knew was that he was definitely injured, it didn’t happen at the gym and tony not wanting to tell his guardian about it only meant he was in some kind of trouble.
“uhm you can help me study too if you want” he said quickly and Steve was a little stunned but he pursed his lips and put the car in drive turning towards Tony’s house.
“Are you serious? This was why you didn’t want to go to the nurse?” tony looked almost timid and shy now after having admitted it. It made Steve’s heart flutter at how adorable he looked at the moment.
It took a while but when they were finally done checking up on him, and asking him all the post op questions , steve sat down on the bed careful to avoid disturbing any of the tubes
Steve couldn’t resist , he reached up to swipe a thumb across his cheek but instead he straightened out the collar on Tony’s shirt and said
"You said they, does that mean both stane and rumlow are always involved?" Tony shuffled a little , rearranging himself so he could press his forehead against Steve's neck. It seemed terribly intimate as Tony took shuddering breaths that fluttered along Steve's neck. But Steve knew that Tony was only trying to hide his face from Steve's worried one.
He squeezed the sticky liquid onto his fingers before reaching around Tony’s legs and gently caressing his hole and Tony bucked in his arms and Steve kept up a litany of words “I love you , so much.” He said over and over again.
“It’s his birthday” phil stated and Steve and clint shared a look. The look that mostly said it wasn’t going to be a very good birthday.
“Please, I wanna do it" he said shaky hands finding their way to Steve’s pants and Steve pulled them away over Tony’s head trapping them there.
He sighed getting up and picked up the shirt needing to keep himself occupied, he threw in the hamper they had thoughtfully kept along with Tony’s other clothes.
He was handed the file Clint was reading , a finger pointing at a particular page. The format looked oddly familiar and as Steve read it, he realized it was Howard’s will.
“Hey buddy, what are you doing?” he asked still unsure if Tony was aware of what he was doing and he came closer to him his hands hovering the air afraid Tony will fall.
They will have to let stane make the first move here  regarding Tony’s living arrangements. If CPS came forward then they can claim abuse because they actually had Bruce as a witness this time round. That should buy them some time.
Steve smiled to himself as tony reached for the bag with the burger knowing tony was going to be alright. His life was never going to be easy with tony , but it was definitely worth it.
"only if I get to pick the movie" I said, as I debated the risk of pouring myself some coffee in front of an angry Steve. maybe I can ask dummy to get some down at the lab.
“its going to be dangerous? How dangerous?!” Tony  asked his problems momentarily forgotten as he paced in front of Steve
“Dr Brandon told me you refused the shot, you must be in a lot of pain” she said as she loaded the syringe and turned around to eye tony while Steve frowned.
"He started it" I muttered before turning to the plate that appeared in front of didn't look that bad honestly. Looked like a wheat bread sandwich with green stuff inside it. But hey,on the bright side, look chips! I reached out to grab a handful from the open packet,only to have my hand swatted away by Steve with a "Eat your sandwich first".
“Steve what happened to tasha?” he heard Tony, voice filled with dread and this was not working , steve wasn’t able to constantly keep his conversations in check for the sake of Tony in the middle of a battle.
Steve didn’t bother with the teasing knowing Tony was not going to last long and pulled away looking up at Tony, a thin layer sweat over his skin and he licked his lips tasting the cum that was smeared over his skin.
“I bring thee fluids and nourishment!” thor said pushing the door with his shoulders and carrying a large , and buy large Steve meant actually large tray of food and lots of blue Gatorade by the looks of it.
“Are you okay tony?” clint asked while thor bobbed his head in the back ,they were all frowning now. Except for steve who was currently incapable of any emotion as his brain was frozen.
“I think he has enough problems on his own, without me being there to complicate it.” He said sighing resignedly
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me Steve, I am just really glad you are doing okay.” His heart was beating fast and he scolded himself for being the coward.
“Nope, I have physics next. I like Dr.Banner, he doesn’t put me to sleep" steve flicked him on his forehead while Tony mock gasped at him
The bell rang a few moments later and Steve watched as Tony and his friends clambered to get their books and bags and make their way out of the cafeteria. Now that steve was noticing, he looked younger than most people. Even if by only a year, Tony’s physique and build made him look like rhodeys younger brother who was always around him to protect him. Steve appreciated his friends a lot and didn’t think he could have maintained this distance if not for the knowledge that the two of them were there watching over him.
Tony had been quite pissed with Steve and the team for no apparent reason as far as Steve was concerned , and had been avoiding them all for two days now.
“Bad dream?” he asked as Tony settled back down, his heart rate was still too fast but getting better.
“welcome back cap” he turned his head towards his feet where he saw Clint perched up on the bed by his feet. Steve’s captain America uniform on his lap.
“It is actually, but it’s just some speculations and I don’t want you to stress about okay? Besides if it is nothing, then It wont matter at all.” She said but Steve could still read the undertone and he knew something was very wrong .
Heading over to the shower, I brushed my teeth and took a quick shower, giving Steve a little more time to sleep before I woke him up. The shower burned my skin, probably because I forgot to ice it yesterday. The dizziness was coming back full force, I picked up some of the expensive lotion in the cabinet behind the mirror which I didn't even know existed and lathered it up on the burnt skin. Sighing with contentment from the coolness it provided I wrapped the towel around my waist stepping out the shower.
“I think we need to talk to him again, see if he remembers anything that might help us" because it cannot be a co incidence and Steve was willing to bet that stane had something to do with Bucky or rather , the winter soldier.
He learnt a few things quickly, tony was a regular kid. He hated school just like all teenagers did. He was very smart, he was the subject of buzz amongst the teachers these days. He was always surrounded by kids, had a happy , egotistical and pompous attitude. Didn’t like being reprimanded for the trouble he caused with his smart mouth. He held on to that big book of mechanical engineering like a lifeline.
“I am heading to the tower now, can you come over? Stay the night?” he asked him even though he knew Tony would say yes
“Yeah , but not now" he said and Steve felt Tony’s lips press against his neck and along his jaw and then finally his lips.  Steve chuckled at how desperate tony seemed for his attention now and how he himself had felt up until now.
They nodded “we had him picked up from school yesterday because you were coming close to the three week mark. So it wouldn’t matter anymore.”
It took a while for Tony to fall asleep , steve had to hold him down physically the entire time. Steve was going to miss this, he knew the moment tony was really tracking he was going to hate it all and be the most difficult patient possible.
At first he didn’t see anything just the same bruises from yesterday And then Tony twisted around a little so Steve could see his back. There was a very distinct boot shaped bruise on his lower back . Steve traced it with his finger as he felt Tony shudder.
“Uhm no…I have to finish this first” he stood on his toes trying to reach something over the microwave and Steve was getting more nervous by the second.
"Tony, hey you have to tell us what you took buddy. Come on, we just want to help" clint said and Tony looked up at Steve and then Clint, quickly looking away again. He was clearly contemplating something
“Steeve, it tickles” he said breathily and Steve pulled him down between his legs until Tony’s lips were in line with his
“Okay fine dad” he said and Steve gave him a smack on his butt and Tony yelped trying to get away while steve held him by the wrist.
“Yeah?” he asked without looking up from trying to tuck Tony’s legs within the sheets that Tony kept kicking off.
“where are Clint and tasha?” He asked suddenly hopeful that they might be there so Steve will forget about his little problem which was not going away by the way.
“That was until I met Clint ,natasha and thor” he paused for a second “and you" he said the last part deliberately slowly as he watched Tony’s face twitch with strained emotions.
He was snapped out of his mindless trance when Clint handed him a cup a coffee and pra tically dragged him to the simulation center where he could let out some of his steam. It didn’t help  because no matter how much he punched fake doombots or punching bags or Clint for that matter he couldn’t take his mind off of the thought of Tony needing him there and him not being there.
Not that Tony couldn’t have done it himself,  but steve liked taking care of him and he took the opportunity whenever possible because Tony normally whine at being fussed over.
Steve’s breath hitched when something suddenly occurred to him, he could remember the pleading voice as his sight had faded to blackness “tony? He was ther-“
Tony startled badly in his arms at the noise and Steve quickly lifted him onto the bed to get to his phone and before he could even leave the bed Tony caught hold of his hand tugging with all his might and Steve turned back to look at him confused
something in Steve snapped at that . Up until now he actually had no intention of doing anything too vulgar because Tony was only sixteen. But somehow Steve thought the only way to make Tony get over it is to create a better memory to let the others fade.
“Okay, but I need you to promise me that you will call me if you need me or if anything happens. Can you do that?” he asked moving a hand to wrap around the back of Tony’s neck as he felt the teen nod against his chest.
He was shaking , teeth clenched tightly and just like that he broke. A hiccup that turned into tears as Steve held him tightly and let him cry it out. He didn’t calm down even when Bruce and the surgeon came in but something about the way bruce was holding himself told him that he had heard what Tony had just said to him.
His eyes were unfocused, steve brought the glass upto his lips and Tony sipped at it , he made a face pushing it away “tastes disgusting” he said
After a few moments of shifting around Tony finally sighed settling his back against Steve “good?” steve asked brushing Tony’s hair off his face. He couldn’t see the teens face but the way he relaxed spoke volumes .
“I am going to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me,” tony didn’t entertain the idea however
“I don’t need you to protect me. I am not that young , I can handle things on my own.” Steve sighed as Tony became defensive again
Steve reached across tony behind him to get to the nightstand and pull out the bottle of lube and Tony’s mind went on over drive as he scrambled to get off of Steve,  but he held him there firmly and spoke to him calmly
Tony was already petite and thin , and to think how much smaller and helpless he must have felt then , Steve for once didn’t reacted , only nodded.
Steve grinned like a child who had just been promised to be taken to Disneyland , it was a weird sight on captain America.  Thanking him, he headed for the gym hoping to round up the spies.
"I am good, sore, but who isn't?" I said taking a sip from the glass. Steve hmm'd and got up and left the room, God knows to where. I turned to watch him leave while Bruce put his empty plate in the dishwasher. "How are the burns? Did you ice them?"
"I can send someone to draw some blood" all three of them jumped at the new voice , tony more so than the others.
“Do you have any idea what this attire is doing to me Tony?” Steve said his voice low against Tony’s ear before he dropped a light kiss just at the corner of his lips.
“his school, we need to tell them that he won’t be coming in for a while" steve told Bruce and bruce nodded thoughtfully
“I used to make you do army drills, because you were so full of yourself that you would get in. You never knew this, but it exhausted you like crazy and you were asleep nothing seconds of your head hitting the pillow"  sometimes Steve wondered just how long he would have survived without Bucky being there to take care of him.
“that would be great"the nurse nodded. Tony's breathing was slightly labored but getting better every second.
“not funny, you were hurt it’s not fu-funny okay I thought you were dead and -“ Steve immediately regretted not addressing this sooner, tony was trembling again , eyes hazing over. He was going to have nightmares.
“Yeah, have a nurse wrap his torso in cellophane before and don’t use very hot water and I suggest you do it now, he is a little doped up, won’t feel the pain of moving around"
Steve hadn’t actually expected Tony to be this wiped out considering the teenage refractory period . But of what tony said was true hand has had no release of any kind in the past two years then maybe it was okay .
it took him another five minutes to find some shirt and pants with shield logos brightly printed on them. He never liked the fit, but he wasn’t going to complain.
He felt Tony nod against his wandering lips on his face and he grinned catching a quivering lower lip between his teeth. He pressed his palm flat against his chest letting it move higher pulling his shirt up to reveal a small band of pale tan skin in its wake.
“I’ll be very very gentle" he said as he helped Tony lay down against his mound of pillows. Steve pulled his pajama pants down and Tony blushed , it had been a while since he had gotten any such reaction from the teen.
Tony was sitting on the floor , cross legged ,into his phone , a towel around his neck and hair forgotten. Steve sighed as he crouched down and used the towel to dry his hair for him as usual Tony whined about it and Steve caught a glimpse of who he was texting with so much concentration.
“And not that I am complaining , but you might want to put on your shirt first" he felt a laugh course through the teen as he let him go to watch the blush spread through his cheeks.
steve sighed and before he could refuse tony started again “please steve , just this once please” Steve didn’t know what he wanted frankly but it had taken great deal of effort for Steve let go of him in the first place before he went to change and he knew it would be harder when stane gets in.
Steve sighed, this was going to be a long recovery. His mind although ,had reached a level of calm he didn’t expect as soon as he had wrapped his arms around tony. A very conscious Tony.
“okay. Then head to gym.” He said because really he was not going to apologize for what he had said yesterday. Even today he would still say the same thing and his temper was not exactly in check at the moment. So he figured the talk can wait.
I sighed and looked at the others shaking their head in amusement. He had just scared us all half to death a moment ago from his lack of cognition and now here he is making sarcastic remarks.
“You called me sweetheart” Steve’s hand froze over the paper, the red ink creating an ugly mark on the neatly written words. Until this moment, Steve hadn’t even realised he had said it but now the memory of it was suddenly startlingly clear in his head.
Steve was more concerned now than anything. Tony was still not understanding that Steve wanted to keep him safe, he seemed like he was still thinking that Steve was giving up on him just because it’s more convenient and easier. He got up from the couch, walked over to Tony and tugged on his elbow until he turned around to look at him
“hmm its inevitable once you snuggle with black widow with a hard on" he mumbled and Steve chuckled.
“What do you remember from the first two days after your surgery?” tony looked a little afraid of what answer steve was looking for
Alarmed , he raked his eyes scanning him up and down suddenly angry at his team for bringing him here knowing how dangerous it could be for a civilian.
Steve smiled as he saw Tony jogging over to him , the upper half of his shirt was already soaked through from the rain and he held his bag above his head shielding his hair and face from the pelting rain. It was an hour past school time. Tony had needed to help Bruce with something and Steve figured it was better this way so no students would be there to see them leave together.
“okay steve calm down, he’s probably just dehydrated. He will be fine , we need to get him to medical.” Steve nodded as he picked him up , his head falling lax
Steve understood some parts of it, like he didn’t want to appear weak in front of others. Steve was the same way, especially when he had come out of the ice he had refused to talk to anyone about how the future had scared him, how everything seemed so different and new . He had realized later that it was hard for him to speak to anyone about it because he didn’t trust anyone. That was until he met the spies and even that took a while.
“Don’t call him that.” Steve snapped and natasha was studying his face intently and Steve just stared ahead avoiding her gaze.
“You were bleeding” he said eyeing Steve’s chest, and Steve sighed as he reached up to pull him closer again surprised at how he relaxed the moment Steve wrapped an arm around him.
He was aware how much the guilt was wearing him down at the moment, a weight on his chest refusing to let him take a complete breath. Especially because Tony didn’t feel safe enough to trust him to come to him in the first place. He took in a breath, aware of the fragile human in his arms that was meant to be his to protect, but it only came as a gasp jarring him into sudden darkness as his eyes closed against volition.
Satisfied, he dropped the flash light and said “ can I see your ribs? You had some nasty bruises yesterday.”
“I am going to give him a sedative, nothing too strong , just to pacify him" he said as he uncapped the the IV port. Either tony didn’t hear him or he was okay with it because he didn’t even seem to care.
“tasha told me to get you some hot food but I didn’t know where anything was" he said biting his lip “and I also kinda wanted to see you first" he mumbled
“it’s beautiful” steve said breathlessly as he carefully touched it , just a light graze of fingers across the seemingly never ending blue.
“Hey" he said “all better now?” he asked as Tony took small careful steps inside the room towards the bed. He stood by the foot of the bed his fingers drumming softly on the bed frame . Steve smiled at what he was seeing, he was dressed in one of Steve’s shirts he often kept in his locker at the gym. It was almost too large on his small frame coming down mid thigh and some standard issue shield pants that were slightly short at his ankles. All in all he looked like a sheepish teenager just woken up from his long long nap.
“That doesn’t make me feel any better , come on. What’s the harm huh? Besides do you really want me to be losing focus on a dangerous mission?” that did the trick , but now Steve realized he had just made a mistake.
But I actually felt more awake and alert after drinking the water. I zoned out again for a second and hands unbuttoning my suit bought me back to reality.
Waking up post battle was never pretty, all the soreness and pain always catches up with you. Steve's arm felt heavy around my torso, and it was making my burns ache. As gently as possible I moved to push his hands away, but he just held on tighter.
“about an hour” he nodded and Steve waved a hand at the door “I’ll be with nat on level 2, call me if you need anything else” he said as he left Steve to change out of his severely damaged and charred clothes. It took him a few minutes to scrub the soot off his body but the shower had really helped loosen the tense muscles. There was a long gash across his chest, but it wasn’t bleeding anymore so he let it be.
“Hey hey, I saw it Tony it’s beautifu baby. You did such a good job. I am so proud" he was just saying things randomly to keep Tony distracted but he was getting worried at how Tony was behaving.
“Sir with all due respect, what’s done has been done. I believe we need to get to the matter on hand before we let something slip past us , that is not a shame we can afford to carry forward.”
But if Steve knew any better, he would have known things never stay good. He should have expected it but somehow it had never crossed his mind that they still had some form of a relationship, as teacher and student. That realisation came when nat and Steve were posing as couples on the subway station as a lookout for a perp who had contacted shield and revealed that he was in position of some alien weapons. He had also refused to give them any information other than the fact that he was planning revenge against the world.
“okay , so we got to go do some spy work now. We will see you later okay?” they said finally as Tony managed to finish his burger. Tony looked genuinely sad but he couldn’t do anything about it.
“I’ll need large resources on this one , not just – “ Steve was interrupted by an agent who stood meekly by the door afraid of interrupting “captain, there's a Ms. Potts that's been trying to contact you on your phone for a while now" Steve frowned slightly annoyed at being interrupted .
“Please, I don’t want it. I’ll do the IV I swear , but I can’t do the other thing please steve" he begged and Steve’s heart broke as he felt himself shaking his head and watched Tony’s eyes flash with fear as Steve approached him.
“Mr.rogers! This idiot just got wacked in nuts so hard he doubled over and threw up" Steve’s eyes went wide as he reached to grab hold of Tony using his strength to keep him still.
“What?” he asked confused and Tony pointed to the chocolate in his hand and Steve smiled at him before handing it over
“is he okay?” he asked with a shaky breath as he stood up on trembling limbs holding onto the glass for support.
“We are going to help him Steve, but you can’t act like this. Not in front of him” Steve nodded , still miserably failing to calm down
But when steve saw the teen, the concern and worry only increased. He was sat between his two friends the side of his head resting on his wrist which was propped up on the table with his elbow. He looked even more tired and worn out than he did yesterday his eyes lazily looking into his phone as rhodey and pepper spoke over him to each other.
“Do you want to go hang out with your friends today?” he asked as he watched him type something about some new exhibit.
“Tony, I know you don’t like it baby, but sometimes we have to do things we don’t like.” Tony didn't care for his lecture apparently and he tried to escape Steve’s hand as he reached out to grab him.
It’s been exactly one week since Tony had told him as much as he was willing, one week since he had got the report from Coulson. Things were going fairly well, as far as Steve was concerned it seemed like this was a pretty straight forward situation. Stane and Rumlow are after Tony’s money.  In Howard’s will, it was clearly stated that the company goes to Tony or no one. Which explains why stane chose to stick close to Tony. To be a father figure and why Tony was still alive with minimal incident (minimal being on a scale of hurt to death) But that doesn’t forgive them for their actions.
“but we will talk about that later, right now what we know is that the agent who was monitoring your place said that there weren’t any deliveries made and the only person in and out of the house were you stane and rumlow.”
Steve had missed tony, but he hadn’t missed this, the drift between them he was suddenly feeling simply because it suddenly seemed like the roles had reversed and instead of Steve protecting tony , tony was protecting Steve from information.
After a few seconds Tony relaxed his grip and Steve sighed “better?” he asked and Tony nodded and Steve immediately let go , and covered him back up kissing his head
“will you believe me if I say I really don’t know?” as a matter of fact Steve did believe him. He knew a lot of things had changed for Tony, and he was stressed and it takes a while to figure out what works , like how sparring helps Steve .
“I want to go home" he said softly and Steve sighed pulling him closer. Tony dropped the shoe in his hand in favor of wrapping them around Steve’s waist.
“What happened?” he asked the gym teacher who shrugged crouching down next to Steve and the collapsed girl .
“I am sorry it hurts, we will get you something for it okay?” Tony nodded and Steve brushed his hair off his forehead thinking that it had gotten long really fast.
“No I am serious, all the records are under a different name and whatever this tech is , it is advance enough that Howard wouldn’t have wanted it in the wrong hands . There is a very really possibility that they hid it from him simply because he was too young to keep his mouth shut about it.”
It was truly a spectacular sight! An entire block was covered in what looked like some sort of radium glow. Anything the creature (with long sqiggly legs and arms as lanky as a man with no bones) brushed against seemed to absorb some sort of energy while radiating a blue and pink light.
Natasha finally put her phone down, walking past me and sat down on my other side placing a glass of orange juice in front of me.
His eyes widened as the needle pierced his skin and he whimpered but relaxed after that .The worst part was over.
But Steve would take any number of such things than have Tony dead. Bruce watched him cautiously as he processed his words.
“you had steve really worried for a second there buddy, why don’t you drink some water so it will help Steve feel better?” bruce said and Tony pushed at Steve’s chest pulling his head just enough to look at Steve face.
“I am sorry bruce! This is all my fault I am really really sorry" he said over and over again while Steve was still fuming and Bruce was just silent trying to comprehend.
“Because I don’t want someone walking in” he told him casually but Tony caught on to the tension in his tone
Natasha came out of the kitchen along with Clint who silently sat down on the floor in front of the couch , turned the tv on .
“no matter what you think, you still look just as beautiful to me with the reactor as how you did before.”  And with  that said Steve didn’t bother holding back as he kissed tony fiercely.
"Mr.Rogers? Oh thank god! Rhodey I got him!" Steve had to pull the phone away from his ear when pepper shouted through it.
“I’ll answer all your questions once we make sure you are okay.” He said carding his fingers through Tony’s hair again.
“He needs you more than I do right now. And I need sometime to clear my head. When you are back I wont be hear, but I hope ,I really do hope that one day-"
He sat on the edge of the bed just looking around waiting for Tony to get back when he spotted something,  a picture frame of a much younger Tony, couldn’t have been older than ten but Steve would recognize those eyes anywhere. But that is not what caught Steve’s attention,  it was the person next to him. A brunette , with red lipstick hugging him from behind. Peggy was Steve’s first love , and Steve had to wonder what happened, if she got married or if she was still…
Okay, so Tony’s joke had gotten a better response than Steve’s as the class laughed as he sat down again , but the laughter had only started after the students realised that Steve hadn’t taken offence and was only amused.
“I am legally eighteen" he said giving him a half smile and Steve nipped at his ear lobes and Steve ignored him until he whined and pulled Steve back to look at him.
“Yeah, Clint is with him. Wasn’t sure how bad it was and didn’t want him to see you like this” She said tugging on the chains and Steve groaned as it pulled on his sore skin.
“Sorry, all I have to entertain myself is my own mind. And well, what can I say? I am a funny guy" he said smirking.
Tony didn't react and Steve could see he had gone completely still and he wondered if Tony was aware that he had stopped breathing
“His surgeon-" steve was going to ask if he could meet him before but Bruce cut him off “waiting for us in the office. Take a shower and meet me in the cafeteria. We need to eat . Nat will come by in ten minutes and stay with him until you are back.”
“we were all under the same commanding wing.” Thankfully peggy did know what to say and Steve nodded helpfully
Tony no matter how angry he was with steve , clearly relaxed his shoulders and carefully unbuttoned his shirt letting it hang around his shoulders. Steve tugged them off completely and Tony moved a little closer to Steve unconsciously as the bell of the scope was placed on his chest.
“the poisoning is..?” steve wasn’t able to form complete sentences as one of the nurses pulled Tony’s sheets out of the way , to reveal that he was completely naked underneath and Steve had promised he would be there , with him the whole time and made sure no one touched him without his permission. Before she could touch the catheter , steve was on his feet.
“Why did he cry? Did you hurt him? Steve I swear to god , after everything you fought to get him out from I can't believe this" bruce was fuming,  and Natasha’s amusement had turned into surprise as she tried to put a hand on his shoulder but Bruce shrugged it off.
Of course natasha would have told him, he was planning to do so himself, but it still made him feel a little guilty when he thought about how Tony hadn’t wanted anyone to know and now Steve was roping in so many people. He shook his head lightly telling himself that these are the good people , the people that will help Tony out of this situation as best as they can.
“Correct, but when we say superficial, we want it to be accessible at any point. So the surgeons decided the best way for it , is to cut out a bit of his sternum, and let it sit half way through and half way outside to the external surface.” Tony had explained it to him actually but it was sounding more real now that Bruce was saying it.
Steve was now genuinely concerned for his health as he sat down again feeling Tony’s forehead for a fever.
The more tony denied wanting people to know about, the more concerned Steve was getting about this whole situation. But he sighed in relief that tony had not argued further.
“please” he mumbled again softly , his chin down , and Steve hated himself for falling for the tremble in his voice as he shifted to the bed. Tony latched onto him immediately, as Steve manouvered them both so they were lying comfortably against the mound of pillows, Tony’s head tucked under Steve’s chin and his fingertips tracing patterns on his arm. Steve wrapped a protective hand around his back, a large palm settling on his spine as he gently rubbed up and down. Tony wilted against him, tension leaving his body.
In retrospect,  after almost one hour of walking around the streets in the middle of the night steve realized that his anger was actually because of guilt more than anything.
“I don’t know what to do with him anymore! I can’t and I don’t know what goes on in his head half the time. And I have enough on my plate right now. On one hand I want to help bucky and I don’t know how and on the other hand I want to help tony and I can and he won’t fucking let me!” he growled his breathing was too fast and he knew if he didn’t find something to occupy his hands soon then things were going to get broken in this room starting with his goddamn bed where he had touched an underage kid who desperately didn’t deserve him.
Natasha had told him he had done nothing wrong and to just let him be. But Steve was drowning in guilt , he knew most of his students immediate family or the necessary family history but tony was the new kid and he hadn’t had a chance to meet with his guardian yet on any school occasions.
"That's not fair! Everyone gets to be a little tired at some point. It doesn't mean something is wrong"I argued .Why was my morning already going like this?
“Once” Tony started to say but Steve let go of his hold on tony and got up from under him , he quickly walked out of the room trying to control his anger.
“Tony? Here , hey! I am fine” he said slowly raising his arms out towards Tony so as to not scare him and it would have been almost comical the way Tony froze if not for the situation .
He felt like he had just fallen asleep when he was woken again by Bruce. If steve thought he was stressed, bruce looked worse. He was sure Bruce hadn’t slept all night, the team had let Tony and Steve alone for the rest of the night. He didn’t even know where the rest of them had slept, even if there were beds for all of them in Tony’s room.
Bruce waved to as if to say good morning and the rest of the team just nodded in acknowledgement. I walked straight to the coffee maker and picked up a mug only to have it removed from my hands and replaced with orange juice. "urgh,yuck! what the hell, Steve!"
Tony whined at the loss of skin to skin contact "we are going to have to wait and find out" I answered him letting go and backing up from the table.
“she is just doing her job tony, it’s okay. I am right here I wont let anything happen . You can trust me.”
“I will go change into something more comfortable, why don’t you do the same and I’ll meet you here in a few minutes. Sounds fair?” He nodded after careful consideration.
“I am going assume it has something to do with Tony. Speaking of Tony, how is he doing?” ofcourse bruce had caught on, bruce was one of the smartest people he knew.
“Calm down, there is no one here except us" he said as Tony changed his tight grip around Steve shoulders to wrapping his arms around his neck and continued to catch his breath .
,”what is it?” he asked his eyes shifting between Natasha and Bruce looking at the monitor and Steve .
“Come on, I’ll drop you off and then you can really get some rest" he said eyeing the teen one last time to make sure he was going to be okay.
“how sick is he now? Is that why you asked him if he needed a hospital?” Bruce nodded and Tony tugged on his freed hand.
“Please steve pleasee" he begged and Steve wrapped his palm around his cock pumping it slowly at first and then picked up the pace.
”Steve! He,s bleeding! D-do something!” the voice was quivering and Steve could make out the fear in the undertones of it.
“Why didn’t you tell me about the cold water?” steve would be lying if the voice didn’t startle him just a little bit.
Tony groaned but Steve waited patient then ever “I don’t know , I was terrified. I feel safe around you and I love that. But it scares me , because I use to feel that way around obie too. Then yesterday with your friend..” Steve heart broke actually it shattered as he ran a hand through his own hair. It was exactly what Clint had said.
Well, look at that! Guess Bruce fixed whatever his problem was because all of a sudden Tony was the center of attention of the party and seemingly enjoying every moment of it.
“We are testing some new designs..this is a sample" tony explained and Steve smiled as he got up his eyes grazing once more towards the picture.
"-mm! Steve please stop! Let me go!" I could feel him trying to push me away but the serum strength didn't even make me budge. I knew he hated it when I used my strength against him. But I was worried
“So tell me Tony , how are you doing?” he asked as he sat down on of those swiveling chairs and rolled over in front of Tony. Tony on his part just moved further back on the bed.
“I have been doing this for the past three days , why are you resisting now?” he asked raising an eyebrow and Tony only avoided looking at him in the eye.
He looked at Steve and then back again the sleeping duo and repeated that a couple of times until Clint pushed a cup of coffee into his hands and he finally sat down at the table still at a loss of words.
“Because you are a minor Tony, with a past  and I shouldn’t be doing things like that with you” tony stiffened in his arms his eyebrows scrunching up voice dropping, he sounded like a child when he asked
“steve I don’t think any of us realized just how smart Tony is, these past few days he’s been working so hard, I will never be able to question his genius. But to answer your question,  I think it’s going to be a difficult run but he will be okay"
“We can give him a mild sedative if required captain.” One of the doctors was saying and that was when he noticed that Tony was stubbornly trying to not let his eyes close even though he clearly looked downright emotionally and physically drained.
Natasha groaned as she caught sight of the fresh batch of booths came towards the pair. They quickly stood , taking each other’s backs taking the bots down one after another.
“okay” tony said not taking his eyes off of Steve . They got to work quickly, efficiently stripping him off his shirt but tony refused to let them touch his pants.
Tony started but Steve had sat himself and Tony up and was pulling the waistband of Tony’s pant below on his hip and Tony squeaked
“debrief on quinjet. Fury will join us on video. We need you in thirty , can you make it?” Steve frowned, he had wanted to go to Tony first
“Nothing is broken” he said slapping Steve’s prodding fingers away and he began buttoning up his shirt.
The surgeon , along with bruce visited early in the morning he had learned from Clint. They hadn’t wanted to wake Steve because he looked like he needed the rest apparently. Steve was not even mad. He was just happy to see Tony awake and tracking unlike the times he had woken up last night.
“My abs are unfortunately not for show today” he said . Steve was often in the gym in his free time. The coach and him had quiet the bond.
“He ain’t looking too good today so he’s not playing. He’s all yours” Steve nodded in thanks , promising him to drop by soon for a game.
I watched them talk for a while .Suddenly Tony got up and walked towards the center of the dance floor.
He was actually quiet proud of Tony’s hiding spot, no one would in their right mind would go looking for Tony at the gym. But he was now slapping himself internally for not realizing that that’s exactly a Tony thing to do.
“Tony!” Steve tried again as nat pulled out a paper clip and did something with lock and the door fell open. Quickly shoving himself into the door , he stopped in his tracks as the first thing his eyes caught sight of was the red stains on the white tiles.
“you need to stay down, for a few minutes Mr.stark" he nodded his head no, pushing away our hands and sat up ,he swayed as he sat there on the bed so I moved behind him and slowly tipped him backwards until he was leaning on my chest. He still looked a little disoriented but that was to be expected.
Everyday Steve was fed breakfast lunch and dinner. Before every meal he was beaten until his meal was not appetizing anymore.  They were keeping him alive but torturing him. It didn’t make sense. If Steve was in the way then they should have just killed him, why were they doing this?
“us!” clint said pulling nat with him towards the beds “we have a bet to see whose bag fills up first" clint gleamed as they both sat on their beds leaning against the pillows.
“What are those?” Tony asked warily as Steve pulled open the gown and shook it out for Tony to take. Bruce had given him explicit instructions that the catheter and the IV were a must and that if Tony was not willing for it then they would have to sedate him. So Steve had said he would do it himself, not that he didn’t have the knowledge to do so.
“Have I told you just how much of a genius that kid is?” Yes, multiple times from multiple faculties. Steve nodded and Bruce shook his head at him
Steve couldn’t eat, he couldn’t sleep. Bucky was sitting on the edge of the couch, still not looking entirely sure of himself or his surroundings. It had been seven hours since Tony had come knocking on his door. Steve needed to make sure Tony was alright but he couldn’t leave Bucky here in this state. He just really hoped Tony was okay, his stomach was yet to settle from the look on Tony’s face. He had looked absolutely terrified and stuck somewhere between wanting to run to Steve for protection and needing to run away from them for fear of his life. All Steve could now do is wonder if stane was right, Tony’s life just got a whole lot complicated because of Steve. But even complicated is fine, what was not fine was that tony seemed to be in constant danger because of Steve and Steve was starting to hate himself for it.
"Tony! hey, focus on me! You are okay. Come on, drink this" My breath eventually evened out and and fatigue took over. I listed backward into Steve as he held me up while Natasha held the glass up once again. I drank the water feeling my heart rate start to slow. Nothing more was said. I settled back into Steve's arms and the movie was resumed and everyone's focus went back to Simba and Nala singing.
Once everyone left, Steve sat down on his chair and turned towards Tony watching him glare daggers into the door , presumably aimed at pepper.
It took another thirty minutes for them to catch Steve up on everything and round the meeting off. Most of Steve's attention still on Tony. He was given even orders by fury to lead this mission. It would take about five days if everything went to plan. And all Steve could think about is what more trouble tomy can get into in those five days .
"you missed breakfast, Bruce made curry for lunch, do you want a plate?" he asked me, but was already putting some on a plate. Oh well, I was famished. He put the plate in front of me and sat down next to me again.
“I am okay , just get the tissues” he said pushing him in the direction of the cabinet on the other end of his bedroom.
“I think it’s better he stands while I do this” Clint said making a general upward motion with his hands and Steve stood pulling Tony with him but Tony didn’t seem to have the strength to even stand up yet and his knees buckled the moment he was upright and another pitiful whine escaped his throat as Steve caught him around the waist and held him up so Clint could quickly get to work.
Except today Tony was the last one to leave after the bell rang and just as he walked by Steve’s desk he blew a low whistle at Steve
