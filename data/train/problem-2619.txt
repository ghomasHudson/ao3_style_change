Cas is right. He doesn’t trust himself to speak his mind. Quite honestly, he doesn’t even allow himself to create strong opinions about anything because his mind veers toward rebellion every time. Years ago, he realized that he was never going to make it in his career path if he didn’t stifle that part of him. Since he was a very young teenager, he’s forced his mind to maintain focus on the horizon line and float. The longer he’s been doing it, the easier it has become. Until Cas.
Shockingly, in the middle was what looked like a fire pit. It was perfectly round, with all kinds of sticks and leaves in it, still somehow dry. Though it was half rotten.
The branches and bushes clawed at their feet and limbs in the growing cold of mid-autumn, so cold that they could see their own hot breath with each lungful.
“Hold on, Castiel!” he cried out, picking his love up, still wrapped in his cloak, shaking pitifully.
“Of course,” Dean said, spooning his mate close. Oh, he smelled so good, all wrapped up with him, lying on his bed, naked…
Beyond a low gurgle, Alastair didn’t even seem to mind. He almost seemed to enjoy it. “But, wouldn’t you know it? Fertile bitch caught.”
“I’ll be back,” he promises, backing up several feet before he can make himself look away. When he does, he turns directly into his manager. He apologizes and steps back before he realizes who it is, but when he does, he cusses in an obvious way.
Cas removes the last of the binding, and realizes that he doesn’t have what he needs to remove the extensions from where they are sewn into Dean’s natural hair. “I know. I’ve learned all about the different castes. I know how little you are allowed to know about the world.”
Dean shrugs, “Me neither, but it’s not my place to question them, right? They must have a reason.” With that, he pushes back to his feet. “I have an appointment with my bed to keep. I will see you in the morning?”
“I’m sorry, Cas, I’m sorry…” he said after a long pause. Before his Alpha could say anything, though, he continued. “Why am I so fucked up, Cas?” he said, swallowing. “Why am I so broken?”
“Dean, I don’t know what you do for Roman, but I know you’re not a run of the mill celebrity. There’s no way you have the kind of access you do without being important to the man. That makes you incredibly detrimental to my health.”
“And when we mated Dean, you there, giving your all to me, snarking your way through the whole thing… you remember what you said, Dean? You said,” he swallowed, “you said I’d better do a good job or you’d find someone who could treat you right. I knew you were joking, but, god, Dean. I wasn’t worthy of you then, and I’m not worthy of you now. You, you had this look on your face when I held you there, this smile, this twinkle like galaxies in your eyes. God, Dean, you were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.”
Dean scowls at the design, but he isn’t going to refuse. He knows better than to be the wave that rocks the boat. Honestly, once he got over the initial shock, he thinks it’s striking. The red, black, and gold work together to create a rich, dark palette. The black hands are incredibly creepy, but the hair is the star of the design. The long extensions they are tying into his hair will be twisted and molded to form large horns.
Oh, god. The Castiel’s scent was so perfect, so wonderful. He couldn’t help but bury his nose in the Omega’s throat to inhale more of its heavy ambrosia. He always wanted to smell that scent. Forever.
“Shh,” Cas said, stroking his beloved’s cheek, damp with sweat and tears and a line of blood from where Dean had accidentally bitten his lip too hard. “Come on. Noah’s almost here. Then you can hold them.”
Castiel fell to his knees in a darkening world, looking down at the shaft stuck deep within him, in shock at the sight and feel of hot, red blood pouring from the wound, spilling from his mouth.
“Oh. Alright,” Castiel said, gingerly reaching for the spit, examining the meat curiously before taking a bite. His face lit up. “It’s good!”
Cas is drawn back to the bed like Dean is carrying the reverse of his particular polarity. Crawling up onto the edge, he leans over to give Dean a chaste kiss. When Dean tries to pull him into a deeper kiss, Cas ducks away.
Warmth slowly left his body, his limbs from his fingertips inward slowly turning back to the ash he was made from. His sight grew dark, and the fire that once burned bright in his heart was now but a cold ember within his chest.
“You’re not fat,” Cas said, lovingly rubbing his Omega’s baby bump. Eight months along, and already so big.
“You evade the question. You, lone Omega, seem too good to be true. How do I know you are not going to drag me to the bottom of the lake once my back is turned?”
He raised his arm again, mustering his last remaining strength to try and fight these mortals, even though he couldn’t - he couldn’t quite see them. The world was so dark…
It was faint at first, a pale blue glow coming from deep in his chest, where his heart should be, before slowly working up his throat.
“Castiel!” the Alpha shouted, spinning to see the little wolf not three paces behind him, wrapped in Dean’s old bearskin cloak.
Dean’s brows raise toward his hairline. “When you’re vague, I know you’re trying to throw me off course. Which club?”
“We have to get the baby out,” Hester said, remaining calm, despite Cas’s heart pounding in his chest.
So he sat down, and he waited. He stared ahead, head resting on folded hands propped up on his knees.
The angel blinked in confusion before walking out the door beside Dean, who put an arm over him possessively.
Sam grins. “Oh, they’ve been coddling Dean and treating him like a precious princess since before he could shave. They underestimate him entirely.”
On shaky arms, Dean pushed himself up, breathing new life into himself for the first time in so long. He tore away the vines that had curled themselves around him, shaking off the moss and dirt as his cloak repaired itself behind him. He forced himself to his feet, leaning against the nearby tree, bright green apples still hanging from a few of its branches.
Castiel took a gulp from the spoon, enjoying now it felt against his throat, and how filling and warm it was. It was good.
“Cas!” he heard his wolf shout, but he seemed so very far away, or so close, or echoing around him, he wasn’t sure.
Walking into a trap would serve him right, he scolds himself. This is the stupidest thing he’s ever attempted. As he determines that the way is clear, he hoists up the sides of his corset, and seeks out the correct door. Of course, it’s locked.
Cas smiled, looking down at his mate as the last of their fledglings was placed in his arms. They immediately huddled to their mother as he curled around them, keeping them warm and safe. One even began to nurse.
“About the arm? Nothing,” he said, gently pulling Castiel’s hands away. “But that’s alright. I’m here to help you.”
The Alphas continued to shoot even as fire grew from his hands, his mouth, his eyes. The arrows merely fell from him, the shafts already in him burning to ash, their torches growing impossibly hot.
Dean looks down at his feet. The Laws of Public Action are often criticized in hushed tones, but never outright. It wouldn’t do to challenge the very words of the founders of this unique country. Rationally, Dean knows that the laws are there to provide safety for all citizens, but it doesn’t make him any happier that someone was killed at his concert tonight.
“I want to protect you always, Castiel,” Dean said, swallowing down his fear. “Because I always want to protect the things I love.”
Dean took a deep breath. “I forgive you, dear Omega,” he said, baring his teeth and biting down on his beloved’s throat.
For the first time in his life, Cas realizes that none of the castes are without their own problems, their own regrets. There is nothing he can say to ease the situation for Dean’s brother, so he remains quiet.
“No, Dean. Any two people can be in a relationship. Actually, more than two people can have a relationship.” Cas watches Dean’s face start to distort in overload and he curtails his speech. “That’s beside the point. Men can fall in love with each other, too.”
The very thought left his soul broken inside, empty and numb. Food lost its taste, day lost its light, life lost its joy. He did what he had to do for the pack - hunt, patrol, anything they needed - but it took so much energy. Everything became so mechanical. His future, once so bright and happy, became naught but a void of emptiness and loneliness. There was nothing left to hope for.
Dean gasped, unconsciously leaning back at the sudden nearness, Castiel’s scent now filling his nose, his body heat pressing against his bare chest. The wolf could only stare into his eyes, spellbound, as his heartbeat and breath quickened.
Megara again knelt by the creature, the god that had mere minutes ago been one of the most powerful things to touch Aflheim, and was, now, being poisoned by the dark enchantments etched into the arrow buried in its heart.
Determined to be a big brother, Dean has to tease him a little. “So you’re giving up all those others and settling on one woman?”
He was in a small den, with a fireplace nearby, under heavy blankets. Dean was moving about, grabbing something.
Feeling Dean directly behind him makes him feel both horrified and protected. It’s a bizarre combination that short-circuits everything else. Through his rosy cheeks, Cas answers, “No, Dean. Everything’s fine.”
The process is into its first full hour when Dean catches Cas speaking to Naomi and then stepping back to affect the perfect valet pose of stoicism and patience. Seeing him there makes his heart leap. His pulse picks up and suddenly, he can’t think through the adrenaline racing through his body.
“Well, then, feel free to keep your ingredients here, if you need a place to store them. I’ll put them in the lockbox with my enchanted arrows. No one can get in there unless I say the proper incantation.”
The only personal items that he has on him are his lock picks and an emergency energy packet to get him home if something should go wrong. He’d left all identification at home.
Cas sees movement beside him as the hum approaches them and gets naggingly loud. Dean isn’t stopping, and he’s stepping into the path of the murderous projectile. Cas yells his name, but Dean doesn’t step back, so Cas does the only thing he can do. He grabs Dean around the middle and pulls him backward. Their feet tangle and they both go down to the ground, Dean’s elbow catching Cas under his rib cage.
“Are you not cold?” he said, unable to help looking at his damp, pale, naked body. He was delicate and fair, without blemish or scar, scent like the smell of heaven.
Dean made a pitiful whimper before swallowing. He knew what being held like this meant. He forced a word out of his throat. “Knot.”
“What has you so pensive this morning?” Cas asks as he wraps his arms around Dean’s back and lets his hands wander. They are lying in a hotel bed, waking up slowly as they have nowhere to be today.
Cas takes the hint that Dean needs some reassurance. Without preamble, he pushes Dean over onto his back and has his flagging erection back in the warm heat of his mouth before the man can react. Focusing on giving a stellar blow job, he gets Dean back in the right headspace.
And no matter what it took, he was going to break it. Just the thought of Castiel under a curse was enough to break his heart. He had to get to him now. Had to set him free.
“There it is,” Dean said with a smile, slipping a third finger inside and gently rubbing at that spot inside him even more.
“I love you so much, Castiel. With all my heart. I know, I know that you probably don’t want to mate. And that’s alright. Just so long as we can be together.”
Dean took a deep gasp of breath as his eyes snapped open, the first breath he’d taken in so many years. For the first time in so long, a fire kindled in his heart, warming his cold body. He let out this new breath, blowing away the dead leaves that had taken rest on his visage.
“Let us sit and speak calmly,” Dean says loudly, gesturing towards the dining room. “There is room for everyone.”
“You did all this?” Castiel said, looking at the perfectly-made fire pit and the several furs strewn about to sit on.
It turns out that he doesn’t look at Dean, doesn’t even speak, until they are all the way to the edge of the dome, inside his humble home. Cas walks around the dark rooms mechanically, lighting enough candles to illuminate the room they are in. Only then does he rip off his Sabanto wig and scream profanity. After he kicks over a stack of books, he flops down into the makeshift couch.
Anticipation of the flavor has his mouth filling with saliva. He’s been denying himself for so long; it’s going to taste so good. The heat of the cinnamon apples meets the cool crispness of the vanilla. He sighs as he chews the small bite. He drinks a little of his water, and happens to glance up at the table of young men again. The same man is still watching him, his expression changed to one of appreciation.
As silently as he could, Dean lifted the Angel and placed him in his bed before picking up the last of the feathers, unable to ignore the fact that he was now
Dean smiled down at him, holding him a little closer so he could get a better grip on him without disrupting his wings. He could tell Castiel enjoyed it. Carefully, Dean got another spoonful, lifting it to his Angel’s lips for another sip. Slowly, the Angel comfortably settled into him, against him, so fully trusting.
He tripped and fell, rolling to the ground. It didn’t matter. He immediately got back up and kept running. He had to get to his Castiel.
Once he is dressed in the merman tail and little else, the screens are removed and he immediately feels all of the covetous eyes on him. Even in this small group of professionals, he can sense the avid appreciation. A faint blush rises under his makeup, but he knows it has no chance of showing through. They cover his skin too thoroughly, lest a tiny freckle sneak through his supposedly perfect complexion.
The figure glanced up at him, eyes glimmering, smiling widely before going back to drying himself. He didn’t seem afraid at all.
He’s thought about his cock being in someone else’s hand. Well, Cas’s hand. It’s a favorite fantasy of his, mostly because he can’t imagine what else men could do together. As he considers it, he pulls the tie on his sarong and lets it drop to the floor.
“Well,” she said, lost in thought. “the Moon god dances through the sky, and sometimes through the mountaintops. Your best bet is to travel to the tops of highest mountains and look for feathers there. But, as the Moon god is the Great Winged
Shaking his head, Dean says, “I’m not leaving without Sam. I know that this has ruined him by association. I can’t just run out on him.”
“Dean, you did nothing wrong. This was a decision that Cole made. A terrible decision, yes, but you didn’t make him do it. In fact, you’ve been a friend to him for years. Betraying our trust like this is an egregious violation.”
His first kiss was a revelation, and although there is wisdom in Cas’s words, Dean is struggling not to push it aside in favor of everything. Now. He has been attracted to Cas for as long as they’ve known each other. As long as he’s known that men were allowed to want other men; that they could be involved with each other just as other couples.
Sighing, he starts again, stiffening his posture and schooling his features. “Dear Samuel, do not upset yourself. I am sure that the authorities are already searching for the perpetrators of these lies.”
But Cas never stopped. Sam’d used his prowess as a lawyer to get Cas out of work for three months, and had done his best to pay his bills for the fourth.
Joining Cas out on the porch of their home, they watch the sunset, arms wrapped over each others’ shoulders. Dean touches the necklace given to him by the monks a lifetime ago. The golden fish make sense to him now. It’s like the monks were telling him to hold on, that freedom would be his someday.
“Oh, then, what may I call you?” the figure said, sitting down in the snow, hugging the cloak close. “Good? Evil?”
Maybe days, maybe centuries. He had no way of knowing anymore. His soul was caught in some sort of purgatory, a dark void, alone, with no one to love, no one to care for.
The Naga’s blood froze within him as he pulled him to shore, immediately doing all he could to revive him.
“It’s Cole, right? It has to be Cole. He’s the only one who would have any reason to hurt you.” Sam is jabbering, trying to catch Dean up in one massive breath that won’t let him get a word in.
The wolf moaned brokenly. It had been so very long since he’d last lain with anyone, and even then it didn’t compare to
He isn’t expecting to be jostled by Dean dropping down directly next to him, but it makes him happy to feel him this close.
Dean took a deep breath, closing his eyes and blocking out the sound of the swamp, taking in deep breaths as his sensory tongue flicked in and out, searching for a heat mass, a warm spot, anything.
The Great Fell Beast leapt back in terror at the display as the magic sewed tight Castiel’s wounds, yet still with so much power left over that it reached for Dean to heal him as well, breathing life and strength back into them both, before, at last…
“I wasn’t making fun of you. I promise. I know enough about you to know that you are sincere. I’ve just become too jaded. In my experience, people always have ulterior motives when they say emotional or flattering things.”
The splash of water came from his right, motivating him to change to his human form and don a crudely made furskin jacket, cloak, and pants from the pack he always carried with him. This done, he quickly clasped his bow and arrow, readying it in his hands. Whatever creature lay at the source of that sound, there was little chance of it bearing good will. Not on a Black Moon.
Cas grins and takes the shirt from him, flipping it over his shoulder before holding the new one out for him to put on. The scent of Dean’s skin washes over him, and it takes every ounce of willpower not to drop his nose into the warm fabric.
“I just feel so… so weak. Doing anything is so draining, and I feel like someone’s carving up my stomach, almost like I’m being stabbed.”
It took all day and into the night, but Dean finished all of his scheduled commitments and can finally be alone. He was a guest on a vidcast this morning, did some looping work for his latest movie, and then had a long dinner with his manager and a producer that wants to work with him. While they both stuffed themselves with food and liquor, Dean obediently stuck to his diet.
“Yes, Cas. Please.” His hands release their clenching grip on the sheets and grab for anything they can reach of Cas’s body.
A few days ago, Castiel would have been quiet about it, kept thinking, kept pondering ways to deal with this, done
Desperately, the Alpha reached out with his grace, ripping some from himself in an attempt to revive the little fledgling. “Please,” he prayed, doing everything he could to strengthen the little boy.
For that is what gods do when they are forgotten, when they are no longer revered. They fade and return to the earth from whence they came.
Dean rolls his eyes. He doesn’t mind gender fluid clothing. To be honest, skirts are a lot less restrictive than pants, and he wishes that they’d become more common fashion rather than only for the fashion-forward.
Seeing Dean scrutinize them, Cas explains, “This was a road, which is how people traveled. Those bumps are vehicles called cars.”
“You bet your ass I do,” she said, grabbing the arrow deep in the creature’s heart and giving it a sharp twist, ripping the tiny beast’s heart further even as it filled it with killing magic.
Fortunately, the blessing went off without a hitch, she had all the necessary ingredients, though the whole ceremony lasted almost an hour. As they returned to the hut and placed her payment in her designated spot, she grabbed a few items and started mixing something. After apparently finishing, she took Cas to the side, an odd warmth washing over her. “It’s hard for winged things in this jungle isn’t it.”
“Don’t say that, Dean, please…” Cas said between sobs. Dean hadn’t made a move at all, just let Cas do whatever he wanted with him, arms limp at his sides, staring straight ahead even as he was held against Cas’s chest.
“Dean, Dean, you aren’t broken,” Cas said, gently running his hand through his Omega’s hair and kissing his head. “These things happen.”
“Is that what you’re doing? You’re flirting with me?” Dean sits up straighter, his voice tightening in alarm. He isn’t angry, but Cas can sense his discomfort that is bordering on fear.
Cas held his mate tighter, burying his face in the space between his mate’s tawny wings as he moved faster. His mate had smelled so wonderful ever since catching; Cas could never get enough of his sweet scent.
So they came. They came with fire and iron and horses, burning everything they came across, sniffing out Omegas, taking the ones they could, killing the ones they couldn’t. They even took the children.
It was some time later. It felt like eternity. Dean couldn’t even see straight anymore - everything was pain, a pain that kept growing in intensity, a mounting need. A need to push. But he was losing strength. His wings and body were shaking with the strain as he used what grace he could to help position the next fledgling - little Ben.
Castiel stood at the Doorway, waiting for the moment when the sun touched the earth, when the Door would open. Part of him couldn’t wait to see his wolf again. The other was terrified of what Dean might do once he knew.
Dean didn’t care, though. Megara knew the steps to breaking Castiel’s curse, and that’s all that mattered. “What else?”
“Evidently. I had a perfect view of the crowd and I had no idea anything was wrong.” Dean doesn’t like the squirrelly reactions of both of his handlers. Crossing his arms over his chest is difficult with the elaborate costume he’s in, but he manages it. “What happened?”
Cas had bought some soup at a nearby restaurant - even now it was sitting in a styrofoam bowl by the bed next to a couple water bottles. Dean would need food and water when he woke. He was so undernourished.
“I was hoping so. Would you like it to be?” Cas is standing closer than he should, basking in Dean’s heat. He can actually feel the puffs of air from his excited breath ruffling his eyelashes. Dean bites his lip and looks away for a moment, maybe to think or maybe to gather his defenses.
The one was too lost to heat to even comprehend his words, the other could do nothing but shake his head pitifully.
When Cas had presented it to him, he had explained that people in all cultures around the planet had made paper for centuries; first from papyrus reeds, then trees and bamboo plants. Because blank paper wasn’t available anymore, Cas had figured out a way to remove the ink from book pages in an effort to recycle those books that he has multiple copies of. Dean needed a way of copying down his music, so he recreated an object that had long since become extinct.
Dean. His Dean. He was right here. But there was no light in his sunken eyes - eyes that were locked on something thousands of miles away.
That’s why he was here, in a fancy suit and a fancy car, driving up to the gates. They had a valet and everything.
started poking through some of the feathers near the base. He didn’t want to hurt his wings, they looked so fragile.
But it wasn’t until he looked down at his strangely heavy and immobile legs that his heart stopped in his chest.
“It’s Claire, Dean,” Castiel whispered to his shaking mate, wet with sweat, hand gripping his own so hard it hurt. “It’s our little daughter.”
Cas laced his own midnight wings over his mate’s, wrapping them both in its warmth. The Alpha’s grace danced over his mate’s body, pleasuring him, easing the pain of his heavy belly.
“If I am, it’s your fault. You created this particular monster.” Dean pounces on him, kissing his way in the dark.
They gripped each other in the water, so cold it even ripped Jimmy to his senses for a few moments, the water lapping at their chest.
“Oh, god, Dean…” Cas said, breaking down in tears and holding the Omega close to him. He was so cold. He was so thin.
Cas walks into the living room and flops down bonelessly on the couch. He hasn’t been back to his own home in weeks. They work late into the night most days, and it’s just easier to sleep in the luxury of Dean’s home. He must admit that he sleeps so much better here in the plush bedding and perfectly climate-controlled air. He’s becoming spoiled by the perks of stepping into Dean’s life.
“Castiel!” he screamed in terror, clasping desperately towards his brother, at last gripping flesh, pulling him close. If they focused, they could stand in this water, bearing their weight against a nearby rock.
Despite having no strength left, Castiel pulled himself sobbing to his knees, gathering his brother back onto his shoulders and kept going.
Cas hesitates with his hand on the door handle. “The owner is destroying something that is a priceless work of art. It was painted before Kanpeki Basho existed, and we have so little left from that time. I couldn’t let him ruin it.”
“No, I'm not,” Megara said, kneeling by the small dying creature’s side. It kept its eyes on her, watching her with the bluest eyes she’d ever seen, almost glowing in the cold light of their lanterns. “What’re you looking at?” She said, spitting in its face, making it look away. At last, she dared to touch the creature’s body, cold and soft and bare under a now blood-matted bearskin cloak. “No wonder Lone Wolf wanted to fuck you, you donned such a pretty body,” she said with a smirk as she reached for the arrow buried in the beast, deliberately shot into its belly. To kill anything that might have been growing within it. She jimmied it in its flesh and ripped it out.
Setting a kettle on the fire to heat the water, Cas takes a basket out back to see what he can harvest. The berry bushes are producing prodigious amounts of fruit right now, so he selects only the ripe and juicy ones. The tomatoes are heavy, pulling their branches low to the ground. Finally, a few squash are ready to be cut from the vine. He selects a large spaghetti squash to add to his basket.
He knows that Dean will tease him for his vocabulary as he always does. Sure enough, right on cue, Dean smirks.
“Oh, Cas, you’re so good, you feel so good…” he said as his knot grew too big to pull out, forcing him into quick, shallow movements, rubbing his knot up against his love’s sensitivity.
Dean looked down at the little Omega, so close against him, eyes so big and earnest, and he sighed. “I trust you, Castiel. I always have. With my very life.”
At times, Dean would shift in his arms, stiffen, or whimper - but his eyes never opened. Cas spoke to him so soothingly, trying to calm him, help him.
Dean’s body had long since returned to the earth, turning to dark ashen stone, buried under roots and vines and moss. Beside it, an apple tree, planted there by his brother in his memory.
Cas vacantly nodded, lost at the feeling of Dean fingering his little hole, effortlessly sliding inside.
Once they are on the same level, Dean finally lets himself look his fill. Castiel’s eyes are stunning, but as they make small talk, Dean is truly taken with his mouth. His lips are wide and thick, and he has this habit of speaking in rounded syllables that draws attention to their plump beauty. He finds himself losing the words in favor of watching the movement.
At first, no one knew what it was. It just shone a deep, powerful red, first dim, then brighter and brighter as its magic swirled and filled the lake.
And he pushed. He pushed as hard as he goddamn could, tears rolling down his cheeks, jaw gritting so hard it hurt.
“To put it eloquently,” Rowena said, rolling her eyes. “The god must want to birth a cambion. This does not bode well. Last time a cambion walked the earth, millions paid the price in blood.”
Dean tripped, utterly swarmed by countless crows. His ears and neck were littered with bites and scratches, but he ignored them, standing to his feet to keep going.
Dean blushed at the compliment. He’d worked on it for weeks, having to start over twice upon making an irremediable mistake. It wasn’t perfectly made, but it was as close as he could get, considering his lack of skill.
“My brother would love this place,” is the first comment that Dean makes. “He is an avid reader and historian.”
“We’re trying to conduct business,” Dean said, all while trying to hide the blush that was now covering his entire body.
“Don’t you worry, Dean,” he whispered to himself. “Whatever these creatures are, I’ve killed millions like them. Don’t you worry for me,” he said, eyes glued on the red sun. “Just hold on, Dean. Hold on.”
“Well, he’s like a wolf, in that he has a wolf form, but he’s locked into it except on the night of a Black Moon.”
Dean laughed in between heavy panting. “Well, it had to end, or else my heart was going to burst,” Dean said with a grin. “So, since you won’t turn into a wolf, may I at least guess your fur color?”
“I know, I’m so sorry, Castiel,” Dean said, flesh tingling under the Omega’s soft touches. “I was injured and couldn’t come. I’m so sorry,” he said, kissing his head once more. “It killed me not to come,” he said, pulling his love even closer.
“Oh, please, we were just introducing ourselves. You’re Cas, right? The Angel schmuck they roped into dealing with this mess?” she said, thumbing at a now grumpy Dean.
Dean growled, pulling out the fingers to replace them with two fingers from his other hand as he licked up his love’s slick from his hand, groaning at the taste of it. It was ambrosia, pure heaven, hot and thick with want.
“Leave him alone!” Dean cried out from behind them, beginning to weep. “Just please, leave him alone, please…”
Cameras in this Jinushi neighborhood are everywhere, so he isn’t surprised at all that he’s been captured on video. These upper class land and business owners are the captains of this domed monstrosity. They will spend money on anything that makes them feel more important and powerful. What does surprise him is that he warrants an actual foot search. The piece he stole isn’t that valuable. It’s historically important, though, which is why he set his sights on it in the first place.
, Speckled Wolf,” he said, kissing the precious spots dusting his throat, licking him gently to calm him. “But do you want me, Dean, as I am, free and wild? Would you want that? Want to live by my side? Want to live with me forever?”
Putting a hand on Dean’s arm, he apologizes. “That wasn’t fair. I’ve had a hard day, but I shouldn’t let my frustrations interfere with our conversation.
Crawling back up his shaking body, Cas plants a kiss on Dean’s gob-smacked face and falls onto his back.
“I could ask the same of you. After all, I hear it is bad luck for a wolf to wander the forest when there is no moon in the sky.”
Cas chuckled. “Such a desperate little slut.” At last, though, he pulled away, hovering his hand less than an inch away from his mate’s already leaking cock.
Cas buttons the tiny buttons with heavy breathing and a shaky hand. This situation is no different than the hundreds of times that he has assisted Dean, but it feels different. It feels important.
Dean covers one of Cas’s hands with his own and guides it down over his pectoral muscles, over one of his aching nipples, down over the bumps of his abdominals, down to the curls between his legs. Every inch he descends sets his blood pumping faster through his body. He’s panting to keep up with his galloping pulse.
They descended on him all at once - pecking, scratching, biting, slicing - but he didn’t even feel it. Dean merely held his beloved close, shielding him with his body, using his arrow to stab and cut with an almost chilling calmness.
Dean huffs out a curse, his eyes glazed with a fucked out interest that makes Cas puff up with pride. That thought immediately brings him to wondering how wrecked he could make Dean. What glorious, nasty things would Dean find pleasurable? A few images flit through his mind, pushing him towards the finish line. Just then, Dean licks a broad stripe up his neck and nips at his earlobe.
Another aspect of these soirees that rankles is that other men in his caste are here to perform the same function. This might be his sponsor’s party, but all of his rivals will be here, too. He doesn’t truly have a problem with them. After all, there is more than enough fame to go around. But, two of them in particular have a noticeable problem with him. He knows that Gavin will be here. His sponsor won’t allow him to miss a single social event where he might build his brand. Dean feels for him because no matter how much music the older man makes, he’s never going to surpass Dean’s popularity. It sounds like a remarkably conceited thing to say, but it’s true.
“I believe so,” Rowena said, noting the lack of strength and the utter defenselessness the creature had.
“Good boy,” he said, cuddling his mate close. “So good for me,” he said, kissing his neck before relaxing against him. Like this, they breathed together softly, drifting off.
“Cole,” Dean says firmly. When the other man’s eyes snap up, they are filled with guilt and fear, but not remorse. That tells him everything he needs to know.
Meanwhile, Dean was fighting the feeling of his pelvic scales softening, and what was within not-softening. It was getting difficult, as it seems the feathers under here almost seemed to smell like the Angel was aroused, which couldn’t be true because Dean knew Castiel wasn’t interested in anything like that, especially with such a different creature.
Grinning widely, Dean blushes. Sam couldn’t be happier for his older brother. What he and Cas are sharing is something that Sam wants so badly that he can hardly think of anything else. He’s been sneaking around with the object of his affection, Eileen, for weeks now. Just like the situation with Dean and Cas, their relationship is taboo.
Furious activity swarms around him, his entourage of manager, assistants, and publicists all hold court with the studio’s multitude of artists. They are losing light quickly on this shoot, and they have a very tight, very sheer costume to get him into before they turn the cameras on him again. As it is, his hair and makeup people are having to work symbiotically, from the same station and at the same time, which is not going well if the incredible tension in the air says anything.
Reluctantly, he releases Dean’s erection so the man can crawl up on his massive bed. Turning to sit in the middle of the most luxurious silk Cas has ever touched, Dean reaches for him, touching his face with needful hands.
He’s known about the maintenance tunnels and decontamination huts his whole life, and it wasn’t difficult to find one that was no longer in service when the time came to get and stay off the country’s radar.
Suddenly, he gasped as Dean started to rub his finger along his entrance, jumping at the sudden contact.
“Dean,” Castiel said in his sweet, musical voice, and Dean couldn’t help but soften at it. The wolf immediately relaxed, not even realizing he was tense in the first place.
The wolf cried out, backing away in utter horror. “Don’t hurt me, please!” He shouted. Dean had heard stories, tales of those who had been tricked by gods for their amusement then killed. Hell, many gods would kill you for just gazing upon them.
Dean’s heart swelled at Castiel’s fascination with everything he’d done, delighted that Dean himself had made it, despite the crudeness of the whole thing, asking how he had done it and listening to his every word, completely enraptured.
Should he take it? I mean, if it helped him deal with the humidity, that would be a godsend, and even if it didn’t no harm done.
Dean sits cautiously, hesitating to let it take his full weight. “It’s safe. It’s sturdier than it looks.”
“I’m sorry to ask this of you,” he whispered into Dean’s ear, suddenly filling with guilt, “but, Dean, I just ache, I feel so empty, please.”
“Fell beasts,” Pamelia said, her crows giving her sight for miles. “Only a few minutes from here. They’re gathered almost in a circle, coming here.”
Normally Castiel would protest at being spoon-fed like some fledgeling but… but here in Dean’s arms it was… nice.
“I’m here, Cas,” he said, tears welling in his eyes. Cas’s beautiful wings were gone. his grace was gone. His powers were gone. “I’m right here,” Dean repeated, holding him close.
Their cabin is stocked, they’ve added on another room, they’ve built a chicken coop, and even planted a winter crop so that they have as much fresh food as possible. Everything is ready except for the most important part of all. Without Dean, Cas isn’t going anywhere.
Dean gasped and froze, suddenly feeling very hot. “What…” he said, out of breath for some reason. “What are you doing?”
It turns out that Cas wasn’t involved with the group already, but that he was extremely interested in their ideals. While Dean couldn’t be seen at their meetings because of his status, Cas could go and report everything back to them. As their intelligence about the currents of rebellion grew, so did their plotting.
His brother tried to comfort him, but he would not be consoled. His soul was so broken he couldn’t even allow himself that.
Unfortunately, despite his planning, he was still too slow, as even now the sun was about to brush the horizon. He was going to be late.
“I can’t sleep, my molt is driving me crazy. Will you help me?” He blurted out before he could finish talking himself out of it.
“It is no problem,” Dean says automatically. It feels scripted and it sours something inside Cas’s gut.
“We’re not far.” Cas says gently. He stops to wait for the magnetic vehicle to pass when he hears the tell-tale hum coming from their left. The speeding vehicles are nicknamed ‘bullets’ in the lower caste neighborhoods because they do the same kind of damage if you get in front of one.
Tenderly, Dean licked up the little droplets of the Moon God’s blood, kissing the new mating mark he bore.
He doesn’t let go of Dean, despite his struggling, until the vehicle skims by within a meter of them. The speed of it is enough to make the plants thrash around like they’re being shaken. When it passes, Cas realizes that Dean has gone still, so he lets go of him.
At last, Castiel had eaten enough. His little belly was distended, like a proper Naga’s belly should, and he seemed so be so drowsy and almost giddy.
“I’m sorry about that…before. I’m never touched, Cas. It just took me by surprise. I assure you, it was not personal.”
“Cas!” he yelped as he backed away, immediately wrapping him up in the cloak, fighting not to look at his beautiful, lithe form. “You need to stay warm,” he said, holding him close once more.
The creature cried out pathetically in pain even as blood poured from its mouth, tears falling from its fading eyes.
Once, it was a salt lick. Dean always had a shard of salt with him whenever he craved it, so he’d given Castiel his own piece. The way his face had brightened and giggled when he first licked it… oh, it lit the night brighter than it had ever been.
Like before, Castiel gulped down the whole spoonful at once. “That’s so incredible. I wish I could try every way there was to eat fish.”
Sam shushes him which earns him a face-melting glare. He lets it go because he is just as angry as Cas. When they get outside, Cas yanks on his hair with both hands and lets out an infernal scream with his lips closed. If he let out the anguish he was truly feeling, he’d be locked up right alongside Dean for causing a public disturbance.
His brother scowls and leans closer. “It’s just us, Dean. You don’t have to be the perfect Yumeijin with me.”
“When I’m around you, Dean, I want… I want to always be with you. I want you to show me the world, show me all new things. I want to take care of you. I want you to want to take care of me. I want…” he drifted off, dropping his head on his precious wolf’s shoulder, breathing his scent in. “I want to scent you. I want to touch you. I want-” he said, gasping in surprise.
Dean couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t know much at all about this Omega, but he knew that he wanted to learn more of him. And he knew that he was going to keep him safe, no matter what it took.
“You look so damned sexy in this outfit, Dean. The colors are perfect for you. Earth tones that make your eyes shine like jewels. The tight fit of the sarong accentuates your tight, perky ass, and that coat is the softest material I’ve ever felt. When I put it on you, it was torture to not run my hands all over you to feel the contrast of your thick muscles under that softness.”
Dean shrugs. “My dad is still out there. He retired from his career long ago. He was an actor, like me. He and my mom had a relationship arranged by his sponsor and her family.”
“Now, hold on. Both of you.” Dean centers himself and speaks from the heart. “I will not have you chastising me for doing one thing for myself.”
was a lot easier than I thought it would be,” Megara said with a smirk as she reloaded her crossbow.
His hands rub over his face repeatedly before he finally engages. “It is my understanding that we are living in the dome to protect us from the poisonous atmosphere outside of it.”
“Fucking thing called for backup,” Megara said, grasping the next arrow tighter. “Fuck, it’s stuck,” she said, half-standing and bracing the creature with a boot while she pulled on the arrow.
Everything about the video is wrong. Dean would never drink or do drugs. He would never get into a fist fight unless it was choreography for a movie. He is one of the most even-tempered man Cas has ever known.
A few forward-thinking countries banded together and created this domed utopia to protect their citizens for future generations. The science needed to both create a self-contained country and keep it running without any traditional power sources took decades to perfect, but it has stood strong now for several generations.
They spend the evening talking with the monks, listening to fascinating stories and legends passed to them from ages gone by. Cas is a man starved, working to garner every bit of knowledge from the men as he can. It charms Dean that he is so focused on saving every piece of culture that he can.
Oh, god, but he couldn’t stand it, not with Castiel whining like that, the sweetest whines he’d ever heard, each time he bottomed out inside him.
In the dressing room, Castiel is finishing up his disguise with a smudge of kohl under his lashes and a deep red color on his lips. He doesn’t look female, even with the short skirt, wig, and makeup; but he does look good. Cross-dressing is a specialty market for escorts, so he knows that his outfit will sell his story if he gets caught in the wrong place.
Dean awoke to a loud, frantic pounding on his door, making him jump out of his sleep and instinctively reach for his spear.
Dean painfully reached behind him to pull out one of his crude, hand-made enchanted arrows, grasping it like a knife.
He has managed to find his way to the kitchens of the complex, hoping to find a way into the interior of the building without drawing attention to himself. The obvious choice would be to don the uniform of one of the Sabanto that are serving food at the party. But, then he would have no reason to be in the other parts of the building. If he was found on one of the upper floors, he would have no viable alibi. Watching from one of the dry pantries, Cas worries his lip while he studies the bustle of people coming and going through this junction. Suddenly, the perfect answer arises.
At that, Castiel returned to his quarters, the embarrassment of what he’d just asked dropping on him like a fifty ton weight.
“No, no! You need to give up on me, live your own life, have your own pups. I can’t keep doing this to you, stringing you along month to month. It’s not fair to you, I-”
Desperately, Dean took one of his now slick-wet hands and grabbed his love’s cock, squeezing and tugging on it, making Castiel mewl in ecstasy, then…
Actually, he really likes the way that name rolls off his tongue. It flows so nicely, almost like a gasp or a plea. Dean licks his lips and stands. Cas follows him up and guides him toward the exit. Unfortunately, they have to pass by Cas’s table on the way out. In the pidgin language of the lower classes, one of the men mutters something under his breath, causing the other one to laugh uproariously. Cas flushes pink and gives a very rude gesture to his friend. When they get outside, Dean turns and asks, “What did he say?”
In the conservatory, at the pinnacle of Dean’s home, Cas reads one of the books from his massive library while he works on a song on his favorite guitar, an acoustic that was passed down from his grandfather. He hums along and adds words to certain melodies, stopping only to write down the lyrics that work with his favorite snippets.
But Castiel didn’t reply. He merely knelt there, head bowed, hands clutched against his chest, there in the near pitch dark of a Black Moon.
Dean sleeps like the dead. Cas wakes with the dawn and watches him sleep for long minutes before he sets everything up for their short stay. He pumps some clean water into his holding tank, picks over the firewood and brings in a few small logs to start a fire. He doesn’t have perishable food out here except for what he has planted. By the end of the year, he should be able to barter for some chickens and build a pen for them. The bees were easier. He’s had active hives here for over a year. They don’t take much tending, not like chickens.
He reached up to a small niche in the wall, pulling out the flint and crawling back to the pit, frantically trying to light the tinder with his shaking hands.
Cas pushes the soft covers away to get his mouth where he wants it, keeping eye contact with Dean the entire time. His golden boy loves having his dick sucked. The first time Cas did this for him, he had come almost immediately. There’s no shame in that, and Cas had made sure that he believed it. It was a huge ego boost, to be honest. He’d barely gotten Dean’s cock in his mouth before he went off like a rocket.
This evening, Eileen brought over a new kind of digital enhancer, and they are about to run the video through that. Cas’s heart is heavy, but he’s trying to stay hopeful. He’s seen this footage hundreds of times. A man that looks just like Dean is smoking something out of a glass pipe. He staggers to his feet, clothes in disarray, and falls onto someone. The other person shoves him, and then the supposed Dean turns and leaps onto him, fists swinging. When the other man goes slack, he drags him by the arm across the ground and then rolls him into a swimming pool.
“Hello, Mr. Winchester,” Cas teases, his tone full of propriety. Before he was allowed to interview for the position of valet, Dean and Sam had given him a veritable master class on the rules of the caste. Sam had gone a step further and somehow produced a CV of past experience complete with verifiable references. Cas and Dean had both questioned him about it, but Sam would only smile and say, “You’re welcome.”
In the next, they hear the sounds of helos landing on the roof and an EMP shutting down all electricity in the house, including the locks on the doors. Peacekeepers shoulder through them, jockeying for position to be the one to take him down.
Another person… touching Castiel’s wings? He didn’t know why, but for some reason, that made Dean feel so
Dean seems to snap out of his stupor. This man has a lovely smile and such brazen confidence that it catches Dean off guard. “Of course. Please take a seat.”
Dean took a deep breath, forcing his hands not to wander as he held his beautiful, ex-Angel mate close. Castiel needed to properly rest after eating.
Dean yelped at the intense pain, feeling the blood pour from the tightening bite. The world started to go black; it became hard to breathe.
From there, they work together, pressing, stretching, slipping together through the slick oil. All while engaging in slow, deep, filthy kisses.
“What else do I need?” he said, moving to hover over her shoulder. He didn’t fully trust her, so whatever she said, he wanted to corroborate it with the book.
“They’ll send me a notice to come into the office and get a new post in a few days.” Cas shrugs with indifference.
“How?” Dean asked, almost amused at the question. He just assumed he wasn’t going to get to come until he was better.
Dean held his love close, his love that was barely croaking anymore, his love whose eyes had already faded to grey. The wolf’s heart ached hearing him in such pain, at knowing how soon he would be gone, tears burning hot against his skin.
He wants Dean; he wants him in a way that defies all reason. If he had his way, he would ask Dean to run away with him to the world outside this dome today. Together, they would live a simple life of complete freedom.
“Yes, sweetheart,” Cas chuckles. “It’s a tight fit, but it will work. My body wants you so much, Dean. I will welcome you in.”
“Oh! I’m sorry! I disrupted you,” Cas said, immediately backing away. With his touch gone, the chill immediately returned, leaving Dean feeling so…
That permission, that one opinion that he might have something interesting to sing about, was all he needed to rip open the box he’d put his creativity in, starving it of light and nurture. Now, he spends hours a day with his guitar.
Cas bit his lip, feeling himself drip with slick at the command. He’d never been ordered to do anything before, and it… it felt
True, there was always a quiet stillness before a Black Moon, with all the creatures hiding from the evil and fell things that would be released in the blackened dark.
Surrounded by jungle sounds, in his spouse’s warm arms, and already feeling so weak, it wasn’t long before Castiel fell still, unconscious from lack of blood.
Megara grinned. “If I’m correct, a warlock, a high demon, or a dark god is set to arrive here any minute. Things could get ugly, and we don’t want you causing any fuckups.”
She gestures over to the elaborate set they have concocted. It is built around an actual waterfall, creating a peaceful rushing sound. It’s dampening the typical chaos of words, so he is loving the set even more for that effect.
Suddenly, Castiel pulled away, tilting his head as he looked closely at Dean’s now flushed face, his blue eyes shimmering with curiosity. “Your face is speckled.”
That was the statement Dean kept hearing when he returned. That is, except when one of the wolves got a glimpse of the blue handprint. Then they just said nothing at all.
“Wow. That makeup job is fantastic. I can hardly see you under there.” His tone is dreamy and a little awestruck.
Cas can never deny Dean anything, so of course he complies and sinks down slowly onto Dean’s cock. Dean’s hands grip his hips convulsively, a high sound of agony and bliss are pulled from his throat.
He couldn’t do anything. It was as if every muscle of his was pulled taught and held there, straining.
Knowing that they would be coming out here soon, Cas had supplemented his education with information about their planet, including animal species, climates, and even a little astronomy. Dean has seen a few little stars late at night up in the hills between towns, but Cas had told him there are literally billions of them. It’s a number and a place that he can’t fathom.
Castiel smiled at the sweet, tangy taste of it, watching enthralled at what it was doing to his wolf. “That’s me,” he giggled.
He couldn’t see, but he could tell by the splash of water and the rush of ice cold shooting up his legs that he’d made it to the water.
An unfamiliar choking filled the Omega’s throat as the first light of dawn glowed at the den’s entrance.
The sky set the world aflame with red as the sun at last kissed the earth, and the Door of Night opened at last.
As they start their hike into the area Cas wants to show him, Dean follows directly behind him, hand in hand. It’s as much for comfort as it is for safety. Dean doesn’t know his way here, and Cas was prepared for the reality that their trip would be spent with Dean staring up into the canopy.
The Worthy blood within seeped through the runes, shining so bright as to rip through the lesser beasts, tearing them to shreds. The deep red magic reached for Castiel, swirling around him, before slipping into his mouth, into his wounds, its intensity making the earth shake.
The two of them froze. Their eyes met, and their hearts stopped beating. Their hands even began to shake, but no one spoke.
Dean moaned, propped up on one arm so that he leaned over his beloved, each pump of come sending a shudder through him. He stayed panting there for a moment, before looking down at his beloved, lying there, bonelessly limp.
Castiel let out a little surprised yelp at the pain of it, then a soft moan at the pleasure that coursed through him.
“Take it,” he snarled, finally thrusting down to the hilt, locking his knot inside his mate and coming with a loud moan, arching his back and gritting his teeth.
“That was true when the structure was erected and was still true until about fifty years ago. That’s my best guess anyway.”
The flush on Dean’s cheeks stands out, even in the warmth of candlelight. Cas is completely mesmerized by his face at this close distance. Dean’s eyes are large and wide, innocence and curiosity glancing at him in short bursts. His lips are curved and plush enough to make Cas want to defile him in the most pleasurable ways. The most adorable feature by far, though, is the very light scattering of freckles over the bridge of his nose. In the times that they have been together, Cas has never noticed them, and now that he has, he is enchanted.
The wolf tried to remember, tried to recall what his beloved Castiel was supposed to be like. What holding him was like, what that made him feel, how it made his heart ache.
But he hadn’t yet. The sun had fully set an hour or so ago, leaving him alone in the dark, windy, snowy night.
There he was. His pretty freckled face lined up with a bunch of others. He wasn’t smiling in the picture, and the twinkle in his eyes was gone.
Dean nods, goes back to his table and touches his false identity bracelet against the table, leaving only enough credits to pay for his meal. He meets Cas in the foyer, his former boss standing over him like he is guarding a criminal. It raises his ire again, even if he did promise Cas that he would not pursue it.
Before he could dwell on it any more, he shifted forms, falling down on all fours, grateful for the warmth his thick fur now provided him.
That ceases Cas’s forward momentum. He turns an indignant glare on Dean and speaks through gritted teeth. “Fine. Let’s go.”
“It’s alright, Castiel, it’s alright,” he said, kissing his love’s head as he ran his hand up and down his little back. His bare little back.
The wolf reached for another quiver of arrows, as his first had run dry, reloading the bow and taking several more shots.
“Of course you think that!” Megara snapped. “Don’t you see? He put you under a spell! You’ve been bewitched! The only question is why. Why
Dean sighs. “I’ve learned more from you in less than a day than I feel like I have in my entire life. I have been living for my manager and my sponsors and not at all for myself. I want to see the outside world.”
Sneaking out of his hideout to fall in step with a group of women who are carrying garment bags and large cases, he hunches and slouches to make himself not quite as tall. All of these women are wearing insanely high heels, so he isn’t that much taller anyway. When the escorts reach their dressing room, they are each so immersed in their own personal ritual of getting ready that they don’t pay him any attention.
He takes a quick, frigidly cold shower and changes back into his own robe. He leaves the long wig off because he only wears it when he is out in public. It itches and is heavy enough to make his head ache. It’s a necessity unless he wants to let his hair grow out to the long length that is appropriate for his caste. Most do, but he’s only been a servant for a few years. Besides, it is much easier to keep short. Less maintenance, less money that needs to be wasted on keeping it in shape. This way, he cuts his own hair and lets it do what it wants underneath the wig of perfectly straight, long strands.
Dean had immediately taken note of his change in behavior and suggested a molting spa, assuming that it would help someone with feathers as much as it helped someone with scales. But ever since the almost-drowning incident, when the absolute soaking of his wings and the heavy humidity had caused his wings to take
“Dean,” Castiel tried to say, for some reason unable to speak the word, having it catch in his throat. The Omega looked up at Dean, bright eyes full of sadness. Wordlessly, he removed the amulet from his neck and offered it back to the wolf.
Is this why relationships are considered so distracting? Are couples all over the country making equally poor decisions for their loved ones at this moment? What is he thinking? Cas isn’t a loved one. He’s a stranger. Shaking his head, he realizes that is so much worse.
He never would have picked this job for himself. It isn’t that he thinks he’s above any kind of work, but being a server does not challenge him in any way besides his patience. He would have loved to get his degree in art history, and then perhaps a graduate degree in Museum Studies. All those plans went up in smoke with his parents’ deaths.
Castiel reached up to caress Dean’s cheek with his thumb, looking deep into Dean’s eyes as if to discern some odd puzzle. “You are a strange wolf.”
In the many, many years that followed, the Golden Wolf became the patron of hunters and travelers, whose stars guided them even in the darkest nights. In time, some told stories of the Lightbringer, the Moon’s consort, telling tales of his bravery, his loyalty, and his love.
“Room #316. Take the elevator to the third floor and make a right. The room will be down the hallway on the right. Remember - no permanent damage.”
But now the last one of them had grabbed Castiel and pulled him under the water of a murky river. And was holding him under.
“Don’t worry, my love, I’ll take care of you,” he said, softly, licking the slick from his fingers, before undoing the latch on his pants. With a groan, he pulled out his cock, hard and leaking.
The Omega keened, grabbing onto Dean’s arms so hard his knuckles turned white, breath hitching at the feeling of Dean’s knot tugging at his rim, stretching him wider and wider. He almost couldn’t bear it.
He makes the appropriate bow of a servant and says just loudly enough to those around to hear, “Sir, I’ve come to take you home. I’ve already gathered your things from the dressing room.”
“What do you think the punishment would be if our sponsors found out that we were in relationships?” Sam asks lightly, though the question goes deep down to the bone.
So many had been killed due to his lack of diligence. So many families. So many Omegas. So many children.
Dean didn’t care, though; he had other things on his mind. He had a goal, had focus now. He knew what he wanted, and he wouldn’t need this pack much longer. After he freed Cas, he’d start a pack with him. He didn’t need all these people who, just a week ago, treated him like refuse.
But… Castiel wasn’t sure, something about him felt so cold, like he wanted to be all curled up and warm, but he couldn’t do it alone. The feeling of being full felt so good, but it also made him feel so
But this was different. Different for a reason that wasn’t immediately obvious, but that slowly encroached on his peripheral vision, gathering behind him like a storm.
With a snap of his meaty fingers, Crowley waves a cameraman over. Dean looks up at the camera and waits for his cue.
There was magic in him. Magic in Castiel. But the only magical things that roam the world during a Black Moon are…
First, though, he needed to get his mate something to tide him over, quickly grabbing some leftover breads and savory pastries, as many as he could fit into his arms, and smuggling them back to Castiel.
Before Dean’s beautiful face can fall into disappointment, Cas assures him, “I’ll be back as soon as I can. Will you stay?”
Dean left for the lake, several days earlier than he usually did. He was slower on three legs than four, so it would take much longer to get there, and he didn’t want to be late. Not after he missed last month.
Dean studies the menu that he doesn’t need because he’s already ordered. His fingers tremble at the thought of getting caught out after his curfew, but also alone and unprotected. His manager would have his head, and that’s before they found out why he was really here.
The wolf fell back at the action, yelping in fear, body shaking as he kept his arms away, making himself utterly defenseless so as not to anger the celestial being - the living light of intent and power.
The moment he was done, Dean left his quarters to knock on Castiel’s door. Now, being mates, there was a door between both their quarters that they could use to feely traverse and visit each other, but they never used it, always keeping it locked. For propriety’s sake. After all, their relationship wasn’t like that.
That wasn’t its name, though. Not really. The mansion’s true name was Havendale - but Heaven was more classy. And no one dared take down Heaven. Too many powerful clients used Alastair’s services. But maybe, just maybe, if it was found they were using claimed Omegas something could be done.
“Dean!” He finally shouted, rushing to his Omega’s side, cradling his head in his arms. “Dean, Dean, answer me,” he said, looking down at him, stroking his face, his eyes open but unfocused.
He could help himself, Dean immediately ran his hands up and down his small body, wanting to learn every inch of it, wanting to worship it. Overwhelmed, he leaned down to kiss over his chest and shoulders.
Dean is not just a beautiful model or a talented singer, though. He is a surprisingly well-rounded gem of a man. He is curious about anything he doesn’t know, and instead of putting on airs because he had access to the finest schools, he listens intently to Cas talk. Cas, who has not been formally educated; instead, he is intrinsically motivated to learn on his own. Dean was amazed to hear that Cas’s wealth of knowledge came from a VR library account and the few real books that he has ‘liberated’ from their owners.
This one here is dripping out giant black globules because yay. It also prefers to eat its prey’s guts while they’re still alive, because it’s warmer that way. <3
Oh, he could not wait for the day his beloved would be free. When he could see Castiel every night, have him with him always.
After weeks of on the job training with a horrendously steep learning curve, Cas is finally feeling steady-footed and sure of himself in this new position. Dean frequently reminds him that he hired him to be a companion and the valet duties are just for show, but Cas won’t hear of doing anything halfway. He prides himself on doing his job well.
Dean pauses in the doorway to adjust to the candlelit atmosphere. A young, busty woman sidles up close to him, and he steps back as politely as he can manage. She looks offended until he flashes a smile. He can’t forget that he is not dressed as a Yumeijin. He is not here with handlers. He can’t expect people to know how he prefers to be approached.
Dean’s stomach turns as he sits and lets the makeup and hair person dismantle all of the careful manipulation of his hair and face. That’s not how he really feels. He doesn’t agree with that message at all. He wants to tell his fans that they are important, as are their interests. His contract expressly prohibits him from making any comment against the government or its laws, though.
Dean scowls because he knows that Cas is right. Sam is already caught up in their lies. He doesn’t want to add this. This is huge, and it could get them all imprisoned or worse. He lets go of Cas’s arm and nods his acceptance.
Dean held him close, lifting his chin so he could softly lick up his tears, before leaning down where, one day, he hoped his mating mark would be.
“So you do all this, then, because I am beautiful?” Castiel said, raising his chin and meeting Dean’s gaze. “That you might woo me, perhaps? What if I were to tell you I had no interest in being a mate?”
Dean pulled him close, enveloping Cas’s body with his own, keeping him warm and safe. “But you’re worth it, Cas. You’re worth the wait each time,” he said, running his hands up and down his beloved’s back. “Oh, Cas, I love you so much,” he breathed into his beloved’s hair. “I’ll do anything for you, Cas. Anything. I’ll live for you, I’ll kill for you, I’ll die for you. I’m yours,” he said, holding him tight. “Just tell me, please,” he begged. “Do you want to be free?”
He quickly settled into his soft nest and began quickly pleasuring himself. Oh, the oil made his hands so slick, felt so good.
Dean nods. Cas frowns at him and unties the overcoat from his neck. “Here. You can put this on over that crazy outfit, and if you take your shoes off, you won’t be so freakishly tall.”
He looked so weak and helpless. Dean wanted nothing more than to help him, but he didn’t know what else to do. How do you heal someone injured by magic?
The one bit his lips before taking a few sips of the thick, warm concoction that went straight to his belly, making him very tired. The other soon followed, and it wasn’t long before the two of them were asleep, still clutching onto each other, heatscent gradually fading.
But this interim stage, this point at which they always had to separate? It began to be too much to bear. More and more, he realized that there might be a point when he couldn’t endure anymore, where he might at last fall apart from the misery and pain of it.
Angry that they would deprive Dean of such basic needs, Cas replies, “I don’t care. I need your lips on mine right now.”
The two of them curled close in their soft nest, worry burning in Cas’s heart. Fortunately, the pain seemed to be subsiding.
Sam purses his lips. How anyone thinks that Dean is dumb is beyond him. His brother is perceptive and insightful. “Yes, I suppose it is.”
“Dean, it’s Noah,” Cas said, looking over at his newborn son, squirming and crying in the open air. Dean didn’t turn to look. The cut and his channel were bleeding. They just kept bleeding.
It took a little under a day to get home, as hauling the weapons back slowed them down a great deal. Unfortunately, the time did not pass quickly - after all of Meg’s words, both of them were hesitant to speak and mostly kept their eyes to the ground.
The Omega didn’t seem to mind his staring, and kept eating happily, until the spit was clean. He hummed contentedly. “I must say I’m not… used to such treatment.”
Dean’s curiosity definitely piqued, he asks several more follow up questions before exclaiming, “Cars gave them a freedom to go wherever they wanted.”
Seeing the place that Cas will one day live is bittersweet for Dean. He has known that one day Cas would leave, but maybe now that he knows where to find him, he could visit? Before the day comes when they must part, Dean means to have Cas show him how to get through the locked chambers and out of the dome on his own.
All at once, however, a deep calming feeling spread through him, calming him, as a gentle hand cupped his and his brother’s face.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion before the door swung open, revealing a woman with dark hair, dark eyes, and a permanent smirk.
His eyes glowed bright as he prepared to strike, prepared to smite them and burn them out from the inside, burn them for daring to harm his wolf, and-
Druids, in general, need to be good marksmen because they’re likely to run afowl of some evil beast and need a way to kill it - and approaching evil things is rather unwise. Best to shoot it.
“Fine!” Megara said, taking off in the direction of the river with her two compatriots, who seemed to disappear in a cloud of crows.
Dean cried out as he came hotly into his Alpha’s hand. The Omega quivered and whimpered softly in his Alpha’s arms.
As the man takes another bite, Cas shivers at the moan he hears from across the dining room. For all the saints. This man is a gift. What would it be like to take him home and tease out even stronger reactions? Would he be even more responsive to Cas’s touch? To his tongue?
The light within Castiel, behind his eyes, was flickering, dimming; eyes that were falling shut. And blood was dripping from his mouth and nose.
“I’m already a hundred positions below your status, Dean. Knowing you were there watching my failure is the only reason it actually stung. I hated that job. I’m thrilled to leave it behind. But. Having you see me humiliated in public by that-”
“What’s so funny?” Sam asks his brother who up until his uptight chuckle had been stiff enough to snap.
Despite their dirt and obvious weariness, they were beautiful Omegas, perfect and fertile and soft, with eyes as blue as the sky in spring. How could anyone want to hurt them? He knew by their prayer, by their hearts, that they were good and kind.
“Alastair. They call him The Demon. A boy here, used to belong to him, but a client dumped acid on him, so he was resold here. Didn’t last long here, though. Most of Alastair’s don’t. The Demon works them hard.”
He loved Castiel. Loved him more with each passing month. He wanted to mate him, to hold him and not have to let go, to be always by his side. The wolf knew Castiel might not want such a thing, and that was alright. As long as they could be together, packmates, life would be wonderful
Before he could dwell on it any longer, he kept sifting through the feathers, finding another pinfeather to massage.
“Let me try,” Castiel said, pulling Dean’s hand up to his face and licking the remaining slick from it, sucking on his fingers to get every last drop.
The wolf stood there for a long time, unable to look up from the ground. At last, though, he walked towards the entrance to look up at the rising sun. The accursed rising sun.
“Hm,” Rowena said, lifting a foot to kick the dark god onto its back to get a better look at its wounds. The little thing yelped at the gesture.
She looked disappointed. “Very well, lone wolf,” she sighed, waving her hand. “Go, get away, go break your curse. Just don’t break your neck.”
That’s why he’s abandoned his routine in so many fundamental ways. He saw the owner of Roman Industries on the vidscreen this morning on his way to work. Roman was being interviewed at his art gallery in anticipation for an opening tonight. As he and the reporter discussed some of his personal collection, Castiel had been appalled with how little care the man had taken with these artifacts, including the painting in his sauna. The imbecile said that he kept it there because he liked looking at it while enjoying a long soak.
And it was. On the necklace hung a bone amulet, smoothed down to a polish and meticulously carved with a line of small runes around the top. It was even inlayed with a small, vivid green jewel. Other than that, however, the piece was fairly simple.
He rushed in the door to his section of the house. His room, it seemed, had not been entered since his Fading, but even his energy, the life within him, seemed to brighten the room, seemed to clear away the dirt and cobwebs, put the room back in some order at his return.
Dean catches movement out of his peripheral vision. The man who has been watching him is coming toward him now. His left hand rests on the baton in the pocket of his robe. He can’t quite get his hand around it, but he’s ready if the man chooses to be aggressive.
“Why are you up so late?” he asks as he flops gracelessly on an oversized leather sofa. The cool, smooth texture is tempting to lay his face on. Samuel has several books open on the research table he claimed for his own back in grade school. Dean has never wanted to challenge him for the seat. He prefers the small conservatory upstairs. Its soundproof walls and view of the gardens are perfect for practicing his music.
“No!” He shouted, reaching for Castiel. He had to get to him. He had to protect him. Had to protect his beloved.
“We’ll take it slow. Let me know if you’re dying.” With those words, Cas sucks his middle finger into his mouth, playing with it in and out, letting the innuendo carry to Dean and keep the flames burning hot. The next time Cas takes the length of Dean into his mouth, one hand drops lower and rubs over Dean’s little puckered hole.
He could feel it. The power radiating from it, coursing through him, up his spine, in his heart. It felt like thunder, like lightning, constantly filling him, striking him.
. It made him so happy, almost lightheaded or delirious. He just wanted to curl up into a ball and fall asleep, comforted by the weight deep inside him.
Once Cas gets a good rhythm going, Dean kisses him, holding his head to him and running grabby fingers through his hair. It only takes a minute for them both to get wet at the tips, much to Dean’s delight. His gaze drops and he is mesmerized by the glistening sticky liquid bubbling up.
In the subsequent attempts, Dean has gotten used to the sensations enough to have some staying power, but Cas wants him to lose his mind again.
“Right. You can’t even fuck me for another four days,” Dean said, repeating what the doctor had said.
Cas swallowed as the tightness in his throat ached, as his heart cracked in his chest. “I need you to stay awake, Dean. Listen to my voice. Can you hear it? Please,” he said, bowing his head as his mate’s cloudy gaze locked on something miles away. “You remember when you caught, Dean? You smelled like heaven, sweeter than I ever thought. And in those months when I saw you there, swollen with my fledglings, face beaming like the sun, you were… you were the most beautiful…”
“I can’t indulge again so soon, though.” Dean’s words are telling him no, but his eyes are devouring the sticky pie.
As Castiel slowed down, Dean even was able to whip up a few little desserts for his spouse. Granted, they weren’t the most beautiful things in the world, but he knew for a fact they were delicious, and, judging by Castiel’s smile and the way his new tail curled while eating them, he thought so, too.
, writhing on his fingers, grasping at his wolf’s arms. “Dean,” he said, lightning coursing through his body at each touch of that spot inside him, building low within him. “Dean,” he repeated, before something snapped deep inside him. “Dean!” he shouted, suddenly tensing as pleasure shot through his marrow, through his very core, pulling him tight, making his cock twitch.
Dean almost came on that feeling alone, of his love’s tongue sliding across his fingers, of his warm, soft mouth and lips sucking on him.
Above him, Dean sucks in a harsh breath, holding it for entirely too long. Cas has to remind him of his need to breathe. Only then does he let out the contents of his lungs in a punched out sound. Cas continues to rub around the ring of muscle as he bobs up and down on his cock. This dual sensation is going to make Dean loosen faster, but it takes more coordination and rhythm than most people possess.
“Cas!” he shouted, covering his eyes with his arm and running as fast as he could towards the lake - where his beloved always came from. He needed to warn him, needed to stop him, he-
Dean let out a held breath, taking a moment to compose himself even as a god, as the moon itself touched him. A creature that could kill him with a mere thought.
“Ta very much, doll,” the platinum blond preens and then takes in Dean’s exotic makeup and costume. Dean makes small talk, but looks for the first opportunity to get away.
Dean groaned. He ached all over, hurt from all the things done to him. He lifted his head, looking around, vision still a bit fuzzy, but, right now, he was more lucid than he’d been in months.
The shape of the amulet is very important in wolf culture. In this case, the shape is meant to evoke that of a wolf’s tooth. This symbolizes both the protection of a sharp fang and the healing of a gentle tongue. The runes carved upon an amulet can emphasize this or add to it.    For blessings, a wolf (druids especially), would hollow out a part of the amulet and put enchanted herbs or dust or something meaningful inside to aid in the amulet in its purpose. In Dean’s case, it was blood, the most powerful of protection/healing magic (the giving of oneself for another). Also, in wearing it, Castiel would always have a part of Dean near him always.
Sam walks through the door then, stopping to look into the living room for a minute before making a beeline to the kitchen. “Nice dress, Dean,” he calls behind him. “Hi, Cas.”
“Consider them an inconvenience tax,” the smirk on the large man’s face makes Cas wish he were big enough to down the man with his fists.
“Of course not. And I am sure you’ll find a pack to take you in. You are good and gentle, and when you love, you love deeply.”
Sam ponders a life with Eileen. A life where they are free to marry, have children, and live a simple, happy life. It’s his every dream come true.
Cas grins and crawls over to where Dean is. “Not if it’s done right. It can be the most incredible feeling in this world if your partner knows what they’re doing.”
This precious wolf, so selfless and gentle and loving, and Castiel had hurt him. Someone who had suffered so much pain, and Castiel had only given him more.
At first, the ex-Angel glared at him, angry at him for disbelieving this horrible pain in his belly and insulted at his simplistic diagnosis. However, as soon as the scent of some of those savory pastries, even cold, Castiel froze.
The interview process itself was grueling, but thanks to being coached by the Winchesters, he knew ahead of time how to handle each of the interviewers.
“Looks like neither of us is who he pretended to be.” Cas’s words carry a sadness that stings. Dean finally makes eye contact.
As soon as he says the words, his Dean is gone. He stands with perfect posture, a statue of beauty with his personality hidden - buried- behind this indifferent mask that Cas hates.
The sounds Dean releases aren’t anywhere close to the words that he was going to say, but Cas gets the general idea. More. More of this feeling. Cas obliges while he kisses the muscular swell of Dean’s shoulder. Feeling Dean’s bare skin beneath his lips is a dream come true. He is going to relish each touch, each taste of this spectacular man while he is allowed.
His stomach tied itself in knots as Cas rushed downstairs. Dean wasn’t in the kitchen, despite the ingredients laid out neatly on the counter.
Dean scowls and looks over to his manager. As soon as their eyes meet, he approaches, full of bluster.
Before he can depart, each of the women gives him a hug and words of encouragement. It makes him feel all the worse for lying. He feels almost as bad about it as he did last night when he’d had to lie to Dean about certain aspects of his life. It’s the only reason that he didn’t ask for Dean’s contact ID. There were obviously some inconsistencies in Dean’s story as well, so neither of them were truly being themselves. Cas doesn’t know how much of what he saw last night was real and how much was a show, but it is a true regret that he will not see him again. Shaking away thoughts of what he missed out on, Cas focuses on the reason he’s here.
Castiel immediately began doing the same, realizing how unprofessional he looked, how much of a mess he was, and -
He looks over his shoulder to see Dean lift his lips in a subtle grin. “I’ll probably regret this, but I have an idea of how to help you.”
He’d thought he’d have enough for the batter. Turns out: nope. The last couple in the carton were broken, leaving him short.
It is the right thing to say because Cas grins at him with heat building in his eyes. “Can I suck you?”
The crows lept into the air, attacking him, biting him, fluttering all around him, wings beating deafeningly in his ears.
Since Castiel was a Naga now, he was going to need a veritable feast to keep him going - Castiel’s last real meal was a small, piddly thing. He didn’t know how Angels lived off it.
“It’s for you, Cas,” he said, offering it to the Omega. Castiel took it gingerly from him and slowly draped it over his neck.
Castiel himself was confused by the feeling, but not unhappy. He’d been astounded at how much he’d eaten, but it felt so right, and how that he felt so full, it felt so
Dean took a deep breath of the crisp, fresh air. Soon, snow would be dusting the earth, cleansing the ground. Then things could grow again, alive and new. The cycle of the world, all as they should be.
He has learned to accept it graciously when someone shows deference to him. His manager, Fergus Crowley, says it means he is acting according to his caste, and it is a compliment of the highest order. His publicist, Naomi Adler, says that if he wants the most coveted roles, the most luxurious brands to represent, and the best songwriters, he must strictly adhere to the standards of his caste. He must be above reproach at all times because competition at this elite level is ruthless.
His feet pounded against the earth as he ran. He didn’t even know or care which direction he and his brother were going, so long as it was away from
The creature, yellow-gold in his wolf form, padded through the thick forest, following the steady flow of the stream, depending on his keen eyes to guide him in the thick, pitch black darkness. Eventually, the stream opened up to a calm, flat lake. It was early winter, so there was snow on the ground, but the lake remained unfrozen still.
Naomi smiles proudly. “You’re right, of course. You’re such a natural at this, Dean. You were absolutely born to it.”
Cas smiles and sneaks a quick peck on the cheek. “Your brother and Eileen are meeting us. They’re coming, too.”
Dean’s beautiful, tired face resolves out of the deep shadows. Cas throws his arms around him, a sob that he didn’t plan sneaking out of him. Dean grips him even tighter; his lifeline. When they part enough to see each other’s faces, Cas leans in to kiss Dean.
Dean looks up, stopping to observe the waving, undulating leaves which are close to his size. He never would have believed that organisms this big existed, even after Cas had showed him proof that giant animals called dinosaurs once roamed the planet. It’s just something that has to be seen to be comprehended. The sunlight peeking between the leaves above dances elegantly and causes the leaves to flicker between multiple shades of vibrant green.
“But you… you’re mortal, I-” Before he could finish, Castiel drew his mate in for a tight embrace. The Omega felt so warm. So alive.
“That’s ridiculous,” Cas refutes as he shakes his head. “Anyone who knows Dean would know that the accusations are false.”
As his thoughts wrap around the hypothetical, the world around him continues its chaotic pace. He floats along the surface of the waves their movement causes, mostly content to let it happen.
