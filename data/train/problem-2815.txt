Dean watched the angel for a moment, a lump forming in his throat and heart. “M’sorry, Cas.”
remember my name,” Michael crooned, tilting his head at Dean. He turned his body, dragging Castiel along with him by the neck so Dean could see the pain on his lover’s face. Michael pressed his free hand to his chest in mock offense. “And here I was thinking you’d moved on.” He clicked his tongue through the poor woman’s mouth. “Glad to see I was mistaken.”
Pulsing with adrenaline now, Dean kept advancing. “Then do it,” he hissed.
“Dude, gross,” said Sam, shaking his head.
Dean and Castiel dropped Sam off at his motel—an extra seedy one Dean picked out as a kind of revenge—so he could get changed and make his way to the police station while the (un)happy couple attended their first ever PTA meeting. Claire had gone to a local coffee shop—a place she’d heard was popular with the students—to try and make some connections. But not before she gave her new dads a makeover.
Castiel cleared his throat and nodded, straightening, suddenly very serious again. “Yes,” he said, voice almost reverent as he reached to take Dean’s left hand in one of his, the ring in the other. He paused, then looked up at Dean and said, “I know it’s a little redundant, but—marry me, Dean?”
Castiel said nothing but released one of Dean’s hands and worked it beneath him, wrapping it around his length. Dean bucked into Castiel’s fist immediately, and Cast resumed his rhythm, keeping time. The sounds Dean made with the added pleasure were agonizing, and within minutes Castiel found himself tumbling quickly toward the edge. “Dean—”
Dean dug a beer from the ice and let the cooler lid thunk closed, obscuring Sam’s next words. He turned around just in time to see Castiel smiling as Sam pulled a glowing blue vial from his pocket and reach to pass it across the table. Relief flooded every cell of his body. He was hoping, selfishly, that this meant he and Cas didn’t have to have their talk when the relief was pulled from beneath him like a rug covering a pit. There was a cool rush of air and suddenly, he was falling—or, no, he only thought he was falling.
? I can’t believe Michael hasn’t already sensed it and killed us all!”
Jack shrugged. “Couple weeks now.”
Dean blinked at Castiel and nodded, having forgotten the blanket entirely. “Uhh—yeah. Here.”
Castiel smiled to himself as he walked by the woods, flanked by his bickering family for the first time in what felt like years, and for a moment, the trails of the evening were forgotten to the sounds of home.
“Why don’t you take him to lay down, Dean?” suggested Sam. “Me and Jack are okay here. We’ll keep an eye on the phones for Rowena.”
Sam nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “My brother’s just an asshole—which I don’t have to tell you.”
“Known what?” Dean wondered, nearly a whisper. He trailed his arms down just slightly to clasp his finger’s behind Castiel’s neck at the base, thumbing gentle circles into his skin.
Jack was silent for a moment, looking between Castiel and Sam. “I don’t know the spell,” he finally admitted softly.
"Hey Sammy," Dean starts through a mouthful of chicken, "you remember that Thanksgiving out in Michigan?" Sam chews his salad thoughtfully. They don't do Thanksgiving too often, so it's never hard to keep track of when and where they had been. Garden City, Michigan is the home of their dad's friend, Pamela Barnes. She was never a fan of kids, though, so when they went for a visit, Sam and Dean were stuck back in the motel room.
Ice blows his whistle again, a sharp blast in Sam's ears.
washes over Castiel. His lips curve into a smile, leaning every-so-slightly closer to his friend. Sam snaps the photo. Dean leans back into the couch, putting his arms around the two boys, keeping them close.
written by some guy named Brooke. He pockets the book without a second thought.
They spit shake on it. Sam wins.
The garden is muted in color, even the evergreens along the far wall have lost much of their vibrancy. A pile of snow sits harsh and unmelted beneath the willow tree on Cas' right. The stone walkway in front of Cas is more gray than usual. It clacks in the cold when he walks over it. Dean leaves crunch underfoot.
Our roots dug too deep into the Earth
Dean withdraws to the laundry machine, kicks it to get it started, folds a couple shirts hanging out on the dryer, and turns back around to the front door. Sam watches him between page turns. Gabe’s yellow eyes follow Dean’s every move. Dean thumbs at the bruise on his collarbone, which is stinging but not as raw as the week before when Cas gave it to him. The look on Sam’s face when Dean rolled in, hickies littering his neck and jaw, was fucking priceless. John had given him a sour look, but congratulated him anyway. He asked about the girl; Dean made one up.
Content warning: discussions of death. Manual and oral sex
He can't take his eyes off of Cas' face, so peaceful in sleep. His heart beats in his throat.
"I love it." Cas looks into Dean's eyes. Dean doesn't remember how to breathe. "Thank you."
"Whatever, Dean."
"My camera!" Sam cries, rushing over.
Dean has one fist on the top of the steering wheel and the other in his lap, looking more at his brother waving around than at the road. Eventually, Dean turns the radio off, wanting to listen to Sam more than Hetfield. He makes a mental note to look up
"Yeah, yeah. I know." Dean sighs, watching his breath curl away from him. The pair keeps walking.
“No, Dean,” Cas looks at him, heaving breath from his lungs. He does not look away. “I do not have… very long.”
”You said that an hour ago!”
“Cas, what’s going on?” Sam asks, his voice wavering. The fingers on his book tighten until they’re white.
“Carnations, for a mother’s love. Adra, Ellen.”
”Seriously, Dean.” Charlie sits back down at her seat and looks him in the eye. “He’s good for you. I’m glad you two are-- you know.”
Adra clears her throat.
The next shirt Castiel picks up is a blue and brown sweater vest that's always been a little too big for him. He folds it anyway and places it on top of his bag. His hands shake and his stomach cramps and squeezes. He coughs heavily.
"You're ridiculous, Kev." Kevin jostles him.
”This is Samandriel’s sister, Hael, and I the day of Samandriel’s funeral.” This photo Dean doesn’t touch for a long moment.
When they're both situated, Dean flips the radio to Metallica, playing at a low volume. They both know all the words, Dean through passion and Sam through association, singing shamelessly off-key while rambling down the highway. They stop singing for a few minutes in the middle, when Sam reminds Dean to pick him up after book club. Which leads Sam to explain in detail the plot of whatever he had been assigned to read. (
"Just family shit. Nothing new." Dean looks around. "Where's your mom?"
Dean huffs. “It’s your funeral.” He winces. “No, wait, I didn’t-- Shit.”
John’s eyes widen. He hesitates.
"'Course."
“Thank you for coming. Seriously.” Jo says, smiling at her bouquets and then the floor.
“What’s eating you?” Sam asks.
"You know anything else about him?" Dean asks. Bobby thinks for a minute. Hesitates.
“Yes.” He pops the other half of the tomato in him mouth, studying his fingernails to avoid his mother's gaze. He looks up anyway, but she's already gone back to making her salad. Castiel stands back up, swaying lightly on his feet.
"Shut it, Cas." Dean warns. Sam feels like he's missing something, but he just shakes his head and blows on the coffee. His glasses steam up until he can't see the cup in his hands. "So, Sammy, is Jess still on her way over?"
Castiel had not told that story once since Anna had told it to him all those years ago. He can almost smell the freshly mowed grass on his shoes, the medicine-and-Marlboros-and-flowers that Anna always smelled like. And something else, something musty and warm.
"Yeah? Poor Angel-man, must be pretty tough."
”Jo helped me prepare.” Cas admits when he catches Dean’s eye.
On the way back to the Impala, Dean spots Victor on his way out. He manage to make eye contact, but he waves.
Dean gets up. His heart drums in his chest and ears. The stairs have never seemed so tall. He goes up, passing the bathroom and Adra’s room, to the dark end of the hallway where the ladder leans against the wall. His hands don’t shake as he pulls the ladder over to the trapdoor. He’s encased in darkness, pushing the trapdoor up and scraping it over the floor. All those weeks ago, after their fight, Dean’s heart was thudding for a much different reason.
”Fuckin’ hell,” Dean curses again, once he’s finally able to stand straight on his feet. “Is this how you feel all the time?”
”You’re the best.” It still doesn’t feel like enough. He feels the heat coming off of Cas through his shirt. But he shrugs the feeling off. “Sam’s next, then?”
“Cas was one of my best friends,” Jo says through a watery smile, “one of the best fucking people I’ll ever know.” Adra nods. Jo asks her how she’s doing and she purses her lips. Jo laughs and apologizes for the bad question. Dean is next. Jo draws him into a slow, tight hug. They don’t say a word, but they don’t have to. She presses a kiss into his hair. She ruffles Sam’s hair and hugs him, too. Ash gives them all bear hugs. He’s braided the long half of his mullet back. He looks like he wants to make a joke when he reaches Dean, but he doesn’t.
“Hey Bobby,” He says with well-practiced ease. His heart slams against his ribs, feeling his stomach churn with bile. He's surprised Bobby can't hear it through the crackle of the phone line.
“Dean,” Cas whines, “Deandeandean.”
“Don’t understand? I understand a fuck lot more than you do, Dad,” Dean spits back. He shoves his father. John stumbles. “You think Mom wanted this? You think she’d be proud of you, you lazy, alcoholic burnout?”
Something about that must have struck both of them, because the conversation picks up quickly from there. Castiel talks about a lot of things Dean doesn't understand, like what the hell a 'gerund' is. He asks Cas a lot of questions, though.
Luckily, it's only a handful of minutes after Dean leaves that another car pulls up and Sam's friend, Kevin Tran, steps out. Kevin's only jacket is a thin, red hoodie. They wave to each other, Sam patting the step beside him.
Dean very much does. He starts by snaking a hand under Cas’ shoulders, gripping his shoulder blade and a little lower on his back. Then, Dean kisses down Cas’ chest, swirling his tongue and blowing a breath on the wet spot, which makes Castiel arch into him. Dean’s hands are rough against Cas’ back, but his tongue is warm, and wet. Dean kisses Cas’ nipples, nipping and tugging at the piqued, pink skin. Castiel moans, and grabs for the sheets, for Dean’s shoulder, for anything just to have more of that. Dean responds with a smirk against Cas’ chest, and the hand that was on Cas’ spine is now on his nipple, rubbing in small, circular motions. Dean’s tongue does the same on the other. Dean pinches.
They come to a bench near where Cas made his confession over Christmas break. It’s shrouded by some evergreens, pretty out-of-sight from anyone who doesn’t know it’s there, and Castiel plops down, breathing labored.
”Castiel, my friend. It’s been a while since we’ve seen you around.” Castiel only stares at his feet.
_____________
”Okay, fandom?” Charlie asks, popping the lid off the Tupperware. Dean turns the laptop on and feels it vibrate against his thigh. They have to be careful not to elbow each other, sitting so close together on the bed. Leia is on the floor below them, whining.
”My apologies, my mother had to leave for work earlier than usual tonight.”
Sam sticks his tongue out and the pair duck into Sam’s bedroom, shutting the door loudly.
"I do believe you. But I-- I worry about you, Castiel."
Dean remembers the first time he and Ruby had smoked together, right out back of the Milton’s. She was saying something about not being able to smoke at home anymore: her parents’ divorce meant way too many flammable boxes lying around. At least, that’s what she’d told him. Now he knows what she was really saying.
Well guys... It's been five years since I started this exciting, awful, amazing journey. This is really and truly the final chapter. I have some plans for editing, but the main story is finished. Thank you so much for sticking with me all this time. I'd like to shoutout to Binta for being a loyal friend and reader all these years, and to all of you reading this. Thank you.
Well.
Dean wishes Castiel was here with them right now.
I'm back in the swing of things! So you know what that means, more updates!
“No.” He looks away from her, to the rest of the kitchen counter, and the spice racks on top of the toaster oven. “Have you seen my--” He makes a motion he hopes conveys an inhaler. “The blue one.”
”I have more.”
Charlie’s smile pisses Dean right off.
"Awesome. I'll see you then."
"Way to sugar coat it, man." He tries to smile, but it fails quickly. Instead, he sighs, and starts walking again. Cas buttons up his coat, bracing himself against the cold. "What about this?"
He's halfway through the book when the alarm on his watch goes off.
“That’s alright, man,” Dean says, “That’s alright. We’ll figure something out.”
”Are you feeling okay?” He asks, setting his spoon down.
"No, I mean it, Sam. What the hell? You were just fine last night, then I get up this morning and you're-- You're--" he's grasping at thin air, he knows. Dean sighs, taking his hands off the wheel and putting one on Sam's shoulder. He tries again. "Sammy, c'mon." He doesn't know what he's asking exactly, but anything is better than this.
Castiel looks in the mirror; his reflection has changed. Sure, his hair still spikes up at odd angles, and his jaw remains just as square. But his face is paler. There is something dimming in his eyes. He squeezes his eyes shut; the darkness feels much closer than it has before. He opens his eyes and looks down.
"I didn't realize I was such an inconvenience." Dean fakes a sniff. Sam says nothing else. The game carries on.
”When I was younger, I would run away a lot. Maybe once a year, if that.” Sam starts. He keeps staring at the willow. “Last summer, we were in the middle of nowhere, out in Colorado. I was gonna go insane, being stuck with Dean and John for weeks on end. You know how Dean can be, and it’s only worse when Dad’s actually around. So, I packed up a duffel bag and left.
Castiel is standing in the doorway, his cheeks pink from the cold. He has a blue scarf wrapped around his neck and he’s wearing a Led Zeppelin shirt that Sam is sure he’s seen on Dean before.
Castiel takes as deep a breath as he can, and coughs.
Cas opens his eyes. Lines of red drip slowly from his lips, painting the water pink. He can feel his heartbeat thumping through to Dean’s forehead. Cas wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, painting it red.
Sam looks out across the graveyard. An old weeping willow sways in the breeze. Something about it’s dull green leaves are familiar, though Sam can’t quite place why.
And in his crotch, but he wills that away.
“Dean-- but--”
“I didn’t. It’s Castiel.” Cas says. The man smiles. “I always pictured your character as Black, especially with the symbolism in the bank scene.”
While Castiel appreciates the repose the silence gives him, he never feels right keeping his prayers silent. His mother once told him that prayers should be spoken so they have time to resonate. He always thought prayer felt more like spilling paint onto a canvas: leading it where it's meant to go. His first prayer tonight is the Our Father, a familiar hum against his lips. His own prayer follows.
Dean visits a friend.
"Yeah," Dean lies, "Yeah. I just--" he clears his throat, looking away from his uncle. "I wanted t'talk to you about somethin'."
”Speaking of, here come our boys now.” Jo says, and her tone feels like a warning, one Castiel is grateful for.
”Take your time.” Is all Dean says. He takes a seat next to Cas.
“I think if he was angry,” Dean starts quietly, “That’s only human. And I think what you’re doing is human. Yeah, I think he would’ve liked it if you talked to him more. But you can spend your time kicking yourself and wondering what you could have done better, or done different, or you can just…” He coughs, and drinks more water. He sighs, feeling the words around his teeth, “Just… So it goes, you know?”
”Yes.”
“You know, when you were little,” Dean starts, immediately feeling his brother relax under his hand. "Sometimes we would all go out for a drive, when Dad got home from work. he would be in the front seat, and the rest of us would be in the back, Mom included. She said she wanted to be as close to us as possible. Most of the time, she had to carry you 'cause you hated being strapped in that baby carrier. Whenever you got fussy, she'd hand you over to me, and you'd fall right asleep every time.
Castiel hacks out a couple more fistfulls of mucus and blood, washing it down the sink as best he can. His throat is gummy, mucus sits heavy in his stomach. He is no longer hungry, but he turns and goes back to the cafeteria anyway. Down the hallway, he is assaulted with poorly-hung streamers and heart-shaped balloons. There is a table set up outside the door, advertising carnations for a dollar and roses for three.
“Yeah,” Sam says. Jess gives him a smile before fiddling with the sheet on the canvas. Her hair falls in ringlets over her shoulders. Her shirt is a rosey v-neck that brings out the pinkness in her skin, overlaid with a long black cardigan. She has a smudge of jelly on her cheek that she hasn’t cleaned off. Sam loves her. Sam really, really loves her.
Cas lets his breath out. “Please... get me more soup.”
With his eyes closed and his mouth parted slightly, Cas registers that someone, somewhere very far away, is saying something to him.
Something flares up in Cas' stomach. "They are good people," he assures her, "Dean is a good person." Adra glances at him, her expression tight. He keeps looking at the road ahead.
(See the end of the chapter for
The contact name
"Not in most places." Cas answers vaguely. He admires his tattoo with refound fondness.
“I just,” Cas mutters into Dean’s hair. “I need you.”
Dean stills. Cas cups Dean’s head in his hands.
“I know, Dean. You don’t have to.” He says it slowly, like it’s painful.
"I understand. It is difficult."
"Ye--" Castiel starts to say, interrupted by yet another sneeze. "Yes, Mother, I'm alright."
Dean snaps a photo of the kids on the couch. Cas looks up at him for a second, but Dean just shrugs. As the picture sends, another message pops up on Dean's screen, this time from Jess.
The rest of the wake passes without incident. Dean goes to pee half a dozen more times, shakes hands with close to a hundred people. Afterward, Dean and Sam roll down the windows of the Impala  and drive back in silence. The lights are off when they get home. John’s working. Dean fumbles with the key.
Dean winces. “We’ll see.” He means it. “Oh! I gotta text Sam and Cas, let ‘em know I got here in one piece.” Charlie unlatches herself from Dean.
Grabbing his pen from off the desk, he makes his way to the other side of the room.
“It will be good to have company,” Adra says, after a beat. When she looks at him, Dean gets it. Castiel would stare at him like he was the only thing in the room worth looking at. Adra stares at him because he’s the only other thing in the room. This empty house must be suffocating. Dean turns. Eden is flourishing, petals shaking loose from every plant and flower, pooling in bright colors between the cracks in the cobblestone.
Dean falters. He looks at their hands, sitting together on his leg.
. The Santa hat slides down over Dean's ears. Castiel finds him oddly mesmerising with the fluffy white halo around his head. The bell on the end of the hat jingles. Dean pushes the hat back up, revealing an unlit cigarette tucked behind his ear that Cas hadn't noticed before.
He thinks, leaning his back against the side of the building. The brick is sharp on his back. He can't get in a good lungful of air-- too much smoke.
It's just a few minutes later that Dean's phone vibrates on his leg. He has a text from a number he doesn't recognize.
”Wow, creative.” Dean jabs. Castiel ignores him.
”Shit, yeah, that’s right.” Dean looks away from the photos. “I totally forgot.” This surprises Cas.
"I will take care of the cat." Cas says, already on his feet. He leaves, his coat fluttering out behind him. Jess gives Sam a look, but he just shrugs.
Castiel, drowning in coats, and the awful, brilliant blue of his eyes.
"Hey, Mom. It's good to be back here, you know?" He snorts, "Fucking cold, but when isn't it, I mean seriously?" He chuckles to himself. "But I'm here anyway. And man, what a year. Sammy and I found a lost dog a few month ago, spent all afternoon cleaning it up. Ol' Sammy was fuckin' crushed when the owners came by to pick him up. Right, Sammy?" He imagines his fair-haired mother throwing her head back and laughing.
"Yes." Cas lies. Dean looks at him harder, his eyes searching Cas' face.
Castiel realizes he is staring, and looks away.
Dean isn’t convinced.
Dean shifts on his feet, adjusting the chewed up handle in his fist. Quietly, the thing in the box shifts, then settles lazily against one side. With his free hand, Dean knocks. He sniffs. The door is a familiar dark blue, with a peephole between two of the indented panels. A moment passes, and it opens. Adra smiles at Dean. She’s in a white t-shirt and a faded pair of jeans, and her hair is loose in a low ponytail. Her shirt has a smudge of deep red paint on it. It’s the most casual Dean’s ever seen her. He takes a second to blink before following her inside.
And closes it.
Castiel nods. He fiddles with one of his blue medicine bottles.
The phone line drops and Castiel is once again left alone. He rests his phone in his lap. A cart with a squeaky wheel rolls by outside his door. The television screen is still heavily static. Castiel leans back into the lumpy pillows, thinking about nothing but Dean: the boy is standing in the middle of his mind, making himself comfortable like he was meant to be there. Castiel nearly picks up his phone again to call Dean back, if just to hear him talk. He pauses.
disintegrate.
“So it does,” She says. Gabe purrs, filling the space between them.
Castiel feels his heart sink back into his chest, much lighter than before. Thank God.
Inside, Gabe mews and swishes his tail at Sam. Dean sniffles, and he isn’t sure if it’s from the cat or not. Sam pours a handful of food into Gabe’s dish, which is the bottom half of a Tupperware they lost the cover to ages ago. Dean almost forgets to turn on the lights.
The faint sound of the knife hitting the cutting board is all Castiel can hear, his own feet no longer making a sound against the wood floor. Dust floats lazily in the afternoon sun, making the rocking chair cast long shadows across the chess board. A few more pieces have been moved since earlier in the week, but it is once again Adra's turn. There is a rotting log in the unlit fire place along the far wall. Out in Eden, Castiel keeps a small store of chopped wood; he makes a note to bring one in next time.
Dean clears a space on the table by shoving the clutter on to the floor. Sam pours a multi-egg omelette out onto a plate and puts it down on the table. Steam tendrils float up to the ceiling.
”Cas. Hey, Cas?” It is Dean’s voice, still very far away.
Dean steps out for another blip of time, swallowing half a dozen little water bottles and going to pee twice. He unbuttons the top button of his shirt. It’s fucking hot with all the people coming and going. Honestly, Dean hadn’t expected this many guests. He’s shook hands with a dozen old women who would probably whisper behind their hands about him if this weren’t a fucking funeral. In fact, they were probably whispering anyway. Castiel would’ve chewed them out for sure. Dean laughs to himself. Castiel would’ve said something about how God hates idle gossipers, and Dean would’ve kissed him to make the women fumble and turn away. A smile tugs at Dean’s mouth.
"Well now I'm here," Dean says. he leans his seat back so it touches the back seat and puts his hands behind his head. "So we can spend time by ourselves together." Cas nods. Smiles.
“I’m sorry, Cas, I just, I’m never gonna get that.”
Sam goes to hang some of the ornaments on the fridge. Castiel is inspecting a tiny house made from popsicle sticks. Dean finishes putting a row of tinsel over the television, getting tiny silver fibres all over the wood floor. That's when he glances over to his brother and pulls the cigarette from behind his ear. Castiel watches him; he is trying to make his movements subtle, but it's obvious once he flicks his lighter that he doesn't care. Smoke wisps curl out of Dean's mouth slowly, like they don't want to leave. Dean raises his eyebrows at Cas and takes another drag. Castiel is not sure which he wants more: the cigarette, or the boy smoking it.
“You’re a big ol’ meat lover,” Sam mutters. It sounds like it’s meant to be a joke, but it comes out weak, brittle. Dean takes the bait, swallows it with voraciousness.
“How 'bout a Death Star?” Dean offers.
It takes Dean a few minutes to respond. Castiel flips his phone upside-down and leaves it on the counter, before circling through the sitting room again. Nothing changed in the minutes since he walked through. He tries to study the chess board, perhaps figure out whether he thinks Adra will move her knight or one of her pawns. The wall separating the kitchen and the sitting room is very bare, he notices after turning to glance at it. Rather, he tries to glance through it at the island in the kitchen, to see if his phone is lighting up again.
The doctors call out some numbers and then one of them announces the time of death, 11:43 am. Dean clutches his brother.  At some point, they take Cas’ body away. Adra goes with the doctors. Dean follows the gurney with his eyes; they get to the end of the hallway and make a left, and then they’re gone. Dean peels himself off Sam and stumbles into a chair nearby. The rest of them-- Dean’s
Dean sets the flowers down on the cold, grassless earth. Sam stands off behind him, not saying a word. So Dean talks.
In contrast to his lungs, which are fuller and thicker than they have ever been, Castiel’s stomach feels like it’s trying to eat itself. Castiel watches Dean smile, and he knows that smile doesn’t reach all the way inside. He wants to shout, and kick, and yell at Dean until his throat goes hoarse for being such an outrageous
"Friday." Castiel nods.
”Dean, I... “ Cas starts again, leaning his head back onto Dean’s shoulder. “I am not good at being subtle. I have never seen the point to it, to be honest with you.”
At the hospital, they pour out of the car like it’s on fire. Adra flashes her ID to the front desk and the woman behind it nods them down the hall. She was there the night they’d brought Castiel in. They’re go to the same room they left Cas in last night, with a little TV hanging from the ceiling and a multitude of machines beeping and whirring around the bed. There’s a couple of chairs beside Castiel. In one, his trenchcoat has been folded up, and the Winchester’s Star Wars DVDs sit on top. In the other sits Sam, his hands folded in prayer. Castiel’s eyes are closed, but his chest rises and falls slowly. He stirs when they come in.
The bunker door swung open and Dean and Castiel trudged heavily down the stairs, both shivering, and Sam smirked from his place at the table below.
he wants,” said Castiel, darkening. “I was in there, in his head,” he went on. “Dean didn’t even know what was real. He’s not in a position to decide what he does or doesn’t want.”
“You don’t have to say anything,” he said.
His own words were cut off by an unbidden moan, and he bit his lip. He thrusted into Dean again and began to stutter, and then Dean was coming beneath him, loud and long and beautiful. Castiel held on until he finished, stroked him through, and then released Dean to wind an arm around his back, pulling himself impossibly deeper with one last thrust and then he was coming himself, a broken sound of pleasure tumbling past his lips. His hand slipped off the steamy window, leaving a series of broken trails.
“Yeah,” Dean said simply. He sniffed and shrugged, tried again to swallow the lump in his throat that had been there all week. “Got too much nervous energy, man.”
“I remember,” answered Dean. He was silent for a moment, watching Castiel. “It just—I dunno. Everything that’s happened, it just keeps hitting me. I’m still not…” He hesitated, and Castiel tilted his head—classic Cas—and it spurred Dean into vulnerability. “It’s still hard. It’s a lot to take in, a lot of fake to separate out from the real, you know?”
This time, Dean was sure he was dead. This was the Empty, where Cas had been before. Billie wasn’t fibbing—she really did intend to throw him in there after all. Dean’s thoughts began to race for a way out, and he was beginning to pray madly to Cas, Chuck, even Michael—any angel who would listen—when he heard his brother’s voice again, loud and clear as a bell.
“No, Cas. ‘Course not,” said Dean, voice strained, almost a whisper. He shook his head and looked away from Castiel, but the angel didn’t release his grip. “I worry…”
“That’s what it’s like for me all the time, Dean.”
Castiel stopped scratching and pressed his lips a moment before answering. “That was different,” he said. “…And rude.”
“Dude, don’t call it
“Who—Jack?” asked Sam, slipping back into business mode. “Guess he’s still asleep. It’s like seven in the morning, Rowena. We were up late, and he’s a kid. And newly human.”
“Okay,” said Sam. He closed his eyes and focused, then clamped his fingers down around the seal. The pair disappeared from the library in a flash of purple light.

“M’not a basket case,” protested Dean, carefully examining a piece of metal for any remaining smudges.

Rowena smoothed the front of her dress. “I’m working on a hybrid spell,” she said. “One we can use to isolate poor Castiel’s grace from Michael’s so we can work the extraction spell.”
Castiel stepped forward, and Michael’s other hand stretched out, palms pressing to Castiel’s temples.
“Yes, fine, whatever,” Dean answered indignantly.
“I know,” Dean whispered back. He leaned his head against Castiel’s, turning it so his face was buried in his hair, and Dean closed his eyes, breathed in the scent, and savored it. “I know.”
“I—” Jack began, but Sam grasped his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
They stared at each other for a moment, awkwardly, before Castiel finally cleared his throat and asked, “Did you sleep well?”
“Yep,” said Dean. He closed his eyes and breathed in through his nose, content.
“Obviously,” answered Dean, rolling his eyes again. “Why else would he have on the ring, man?”
“They are. But I am,” said Castiel, nodding. “I’ve accepted my wings are gone. The denial is—well, different, somehow. I know they’re not going to spontaneously return. But I’m not counting out asking Chuck for them later…”

Artist: Led Zeppelin
Castiel’s heart seized in his chest as he waited for an answer.
“What do you mean, ‘unsavory?’” asked Castiel, narrowing his eyes.
“If I need to stop I’ll stop,” assured Jack. He lifted the hotel phone and set it to speaker, and a dialtone filled the room. “Go, Cas. Go get Dean.”
“Thanks for being here,” she started, clearing her throat. “Especially in light of—well. You know. I’ll get right to it: Alan and his wife disappeared this morning. Their son is one of my students. He said—they were found a few hours ago, I—”
Before Dean could react—before he could even blink—Michael appeared at his side. In one more disorienting split second, Michael once again grabbed Castiel by the throat and disappeared them both back to the yard. The realization hit Dean all at once—steamrolled over the most broken, haunted places of his soul—all the parts Castiel had been helping him put back into place.
“Didn’t have to get me anything,” Dean mumbled, but he too finished the dregs of his champagne and sat up, folding his hands in his lap.
“Yeah, Cas,” said Dean, his words breaking around a stifled sob. “You look like a ghost.”
Dean’s teeth clicked, and he suddenly realized his mouth had fallen open. “You had—I saw your wings.”
Castiel again reached up to gently coax it back out with a swipe of his thumb and laughed through his nose. “Persephone isn’t real, but her original mythos is loosely based on an encounter I had with a…Dean, are you alright?”
Dean grinned and reached to poke Castiel in the ribs, trying to coax a smile out of him. “Having a good time ain’t nothing to be embarrassed about.”
Dean reciprocated clumsily, panting into Cas’s kiss as he fumbled with the button, though his fingers faltered, and he folded into an involuntary groan as Cas slipped a hand beneath his boxers and gripped him hard. For a moment, that was all that mattered. Instinct and desire took over, and within seconds he and Cas were a tangle of quickly-stripping limbs, grinding and groaning against each other in unbound bliss.
Sam stared at Dean, then sighed. “About Belial.”
Sam had been subconsciously leaning forward into the scene, and he winced as he snapped himself out of it by spilling steaming coffee onto his hand. He hissed and some of it splashed to the floor and he jerked his head up, fully expecting to see Dean staring at him. But Dean kept on singing, clinging to Castiel, and Sam reached inside to set the coffee mug quietly on a little end table by the entrance before turning into the dark hallway and closing the door behind him.
Sam pulled out his gun and took aim for one of the sprinklers on the roof of the warehouse. “Go, Cas!” he yelled, and fired. The sound of the gunshot echoed loudly through the warehouse and brought the artificial storm; water started spraying instantly, getting heavier as the system connected to the other spigots. Dean didn’t move, but the light in the room began to dance itself into darkness as the fire was smothered.
Castiel nodded and set the ingredients down on the kitchen island. “You did,” he said with a gentle matter-of-factness. “They’ve always been there. They’re here now, though I know you can’t see them.”
“You guys get caught in the rain?” he asked.
“I also made a cake,” said Jack, gesturing obviously to the lopsided cake in the center of the table. “Sit! I’ll serve you. It is
Castiel ignored Rowena, and continued, “You haven’t known him as long as we have,” he said. “But we’re going to make sure you get that chance, and you can’t do that if he’s dead.”
So Sam knew, Castiel realized. Then Michael was right. Everyone knew. Maybe they’d always known. Maybe even longer than he had. Shame thick as bile crept bitterly into his throat.
“Not bad,” he said. “Good. Just a different kind of good. Angels—we feel things like we taste them; it’s almost molecular. When I touch you I feel your skin, but more. All the atoms that hold you together. It’s nice. Intimate. But this is nothing like—this is so…” he trailed off and crinkled his brow, running his hands down the sides of Dean’s neck and over his t-shirt sleeves on his shoulders, then down his arms. “…soft.”
Nothing happened. Castiel looked over to Sam, and he shook his head, and joined in. “Dean! It’s me—it’s Sam, and Cas. We’re…” he stopped and stared helplessly, frustrated, at his brother’s possessed body, slumped and trapped.
“That’s what he said,” said Castiel.
“Great,” said Sam, a smile flickering across his features that looked almost crazy.
Artist: The Beatles
Dean cleared his throat. “Lead the way, I guess,” he said.
Artist: Fleetwood Mac
“I can’t—” Dean gulped. His eyes focused on nothing.
Dean was quiet for a long moment. Acid churned in his stomach and bubbled its way slowly up his throat, burning the base of his tongue. He tried to keep his feelings under wraps, but he’d felt like this was coming, and he clenched his teeth—his jaw flinched, and Castiel caught the minor twitch in the muscle.
Dean pushed himself up in a panic and whipped around. “Cas?” he yelled but stopped short.
Behind them, Claire was already on her phone, saying to the person on the other line, “Yes, this is an emergency.”
“How did you even get that?” Dean said, tossing his keys. “You’re like sixteen.”
Before either of the men could muster a response, Claire was stalking off for the stairs to collect her gear. Dean and Castiel stood in silence for a few beats, looking anywhere but each other. “You should get cleaned up,” said Dean, finally. “I’ll call Sammy.”
“I’m sorry,” said Dean, the words coming out almost as a gasp. Castiel sat back and Dean pushed himself up to rest against the door. “Can’t believe I’m sayin’ this,” he mumbled, breathless, running his hands through his hair, “But I think I might be having a panic attack.”
“What?”
Only once during the course of the night did Dean leave Castiel, and even then, he had Sam come look after the sleeping angel. Around midnight, Dean got antsy and cramped, and texted Sam that he needed a quick bathroom break. Before his brother got there, Dean carefully slipped out from behind Castiel and laid him out flat, tucking a blanket around his sides. The angel didn’t budge. Dean tried to make the room look casual for when Sam arrived: he quickly and quietly silenced the still-clicking vinyl, then lifted the chair from his desk to angle it toward the bed and opened his laptop, pulled up an article about angels on some occult website he’d had open before. He had barely settled himself in the chair with the computer in his lap, feet propped on the bed, when Sam arrived.
“I won’t leave you,” soothed Castiel.
“Cas—”
Album: Tattoo You (1981)
Everything got quiet, and the three of them turned to look at Castiel. “I’ll do it,” he said again.
“He sang to me?” said Castiel, faltering in a sip of his beer.
Jack had just sunk a knife down into the unfortunate-looking cake when he startled himself straight. “Oh! Music. I should turn it up.” He bolted to the radio plugged into the wall, and Dean used the opportunity to hiss at Castiel.
“Goodnight, Sam,” said Castiel. “The best spot for sleeping is under that tree with the marks.”
“Rest, Sam,” said Castiel. “I’ll keep watch.” He crossed the few feet to the exit and stepped out onto the sidewalk, closing the door behind him.
They’d just returned from a six-day-long hunt of a trio of Wendigos in the national forest west of Denver, and though the fight itself had been a bit of a milk run, the tracking hadn’t. The Wendigos were deep in the woods, far from hiking paths and roads, which meant days of sleeping badly on the ground in tents. Even with Castiel running recon in the air with Michael’s stolen, boosted grace, he could still only ever seem to find two of them at a time.
Castiel was quiet, thoughtful. Instead of responding, he rose and touched two fingers to Dean’s forehead. “I’ve been too weak to be much help, but I’ve been doing a little a day. Speeding up your healing,” he said. “I’ll let Sam know to bring the car since you’ll be checking out.”
Castiel pulled back to hover over Dean, blinking down. “Same?” he asked, voice edging on sarcasm.
“I’m sorry,” said Castiel, watching Dean’s face carefully.
Dean couldn’t sleep. When he tried, he saw Belial in his dreams—or worse, Castiel’s lifeless body, bleeding on the ground from a gunshot wound to the head. So while the others slept, Dean prepared, and when everyone woke up the next morning it was all ready to go—the spell to summon Belial, packed bags of weapons, food, and water, and hung the Seal of Solomon on a chain around his neck. He even cooked a full breakfast and had it waiting so there’d be no reason to delay. Today was the day they rescued Castiel, and he wasn’t putting it off a second longer than he had to.
“Stop pacing! It’s freaking me out.”
”And the tie?”
”Tell Cas I say hi!”
”Uh,” Sam says from close to the door, “duh? I’m not an idiot.” His tone has no malice. And then he leaves.
Instead of the projector, in the front of the room is a green chalkboard with a list of two names in each row. Project partners, evidently. Castiel finds his name near the bottom: Castiel Novak and... Dean Winchester.
"Dude, you heard yourself coughing, right? That's bullshit, no one should have to walk home with that, not in this weather."
Blood and mucus falls into his hands, instead.
”Jo?” Jace reads, holding out a limp pink carnation. Jo takes it, turning the same color as the flower. “And uh, Casteel?
Eventually, he gets back to sleep.
"Uh, yeah. Yeah."
There's a multimedia message waiting for him on his phone: a heavily pixelated image. Two people sitting on a sagging, red couch, leaning close to each other. Someone with a tangle of blonde hair, and a lanky kid with shaggy brown hair. Sam and Jess, Castiel guesses. He squints at the screen: the kid's knees are just barely touching. Even through the pixels, Cas can see how wide Sam is smiling.
Jace's mom lives right down the road from Dean's trailer park, in a white townhouse. Dean shakes his head and blinks a few times to get back into it. When they roll up to the townhouse, Jace kisses him, the taste of chapstick and marijuana still thick on her lips.
After Ash had broken the table, and Castiel was wheezing laughter, Jo had brought him a box of tissues and Sam had grabbed his inhaler. Dean had suggested next time, perhaps Cas not be the iceburg. Too emotional. He’d try to save everyone on the ship instead of sinking it. That brought another round of laughter and Cas gifting Dean a very fond kiss.
"I figure I should. The kid I'm working with is weird, though." Dean takes a hearty swig.
"Well, it's not. I mean, the bear thing, that wasn't--" Dean trips over his words, slurring them together just a hair. He takes a drink. "Whatever, Cas wanted to--"
"Oh, good." And then Dean is pulling Cas into a hug, wrapping both arms around Cas' shoulders and giving him a squeeze. Cas can't move. "Shit, I missed you." When Dean finally lets go, Cas feels cold everywhere they aren't touching.
Castiel doesn't pay much attention to the movie; he's seen it a couple of times now, anyway. Instead, he gazes out the half-drawn window, at the snow that's now coming down in a thick sheet of white.
"I'm just trying to spend time with my family, Bobby."
"Excuse me?" is all he manages. He coughs weakly.
. But he lets it go anyway. Dean pops his CD into the DVD player; it starts playing a generic carol.
“Bobby,” Dean says. He’s stripped down to his undershirt, a thin black that does nothing to keep out the cold growing up around the rain. Bobby looks up at him, his face half-obscured by the lamp pouring over his book. Dean swallows the lump in his throat, “Does it always hurt this much?” Bobby opens his mouth a fraction. He pushes his glasses up.
The warm air back in the kitchen is inviting. Adra is onto her second cup of coffee. Castiel's gaze lingers on her; there are circles under her eyes and a few strands of hair out of place. A lump sits uncomfortable in Castiel's throat. He holds it until he's up to the second floor bathroom, where he hacks out a cough and a lump of mucus. The bathroom sink is white and shines like it's never been touched. Castiel grips the faucet handle, coughing still.
Sam usually doesn't.
Castiel pauses, moving a bishop out onto the playing field. Somewhere across the room, Gabriel is purring loudly.
Thanksgiving weekend sneaks up on everyone, and before Dean knows it, both Ash and Jo are wishing him a happy holidays and leaving with their respective families. Which leaves Sam and Dean alone with John. Dean has plans to waste the whole day sleeping, but after scoring a pre-cooked chicken from the supermarket, Sam insists they give the holiday a shot this year.
”There was once an angel.”
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs, pressing his lips into Cas’ hair. “I’m sorry, dude. Cas.” He moves to sit down, keeping his arms around Cas. Rage kicks in his chest, but he swallows it. Cas coughs, and it echoes in Dean’s lungs. Dean rubs circles on Cas’ neck. “Uh, what, what do you need? What can I do?”
”Shut up! This is the best part!”
He keeps leaning back, trying to find a break between the trees and the sky, before he nearly topples backwards into the fountain. He freezes, gripping the cold stone as tight as he gripped the windowsill.
The four putz around for a while Sam bouncing up on his toes to get his blood circulating again. Not that he really needed to, Jess made his heart pound more than enough, but she didn't need to know that just yet.
He keeps humming, and Castiel doesn’t say anything else. Dean thinks about it. John had barely spoken for a week after they put Dean’s mom in the ground. Dean thinks it started then. Something to fill the silence.
. But one glance at the envelope on the table, and he’s grinning so hard his cheeks hurt.
”The vinegar shots, dude.”
wait in his inbox for him. He replies to both quickly.
"No," Castiel repeats. "I suppose you're right." Dean grins at him smugly. Castiel coughs twice while packing his bag. Sam goes to check out his books. Castiel looks at Dean for a long moment. "Why are you--"
The faded magnet on the fridge is from a field trip one of the boys took a few years ago. Maybe Dean stole it from a museum, he can't remember. Beneath the magnet, clinging to it for dear life, is a grocery list written mostly in Sam's looping handwriting. It takes Dean throwing away four pens before he finds one that works, and adds
Sam nods attentively, licking his lips once Castiel stops reading. It's a long moment before he can speak. He repeats the thought from earlier:
A blush creeps up on Cas. He remembers how only a moment earlier had Samandriel’s lips been planted firmly on his own. He remembers just how warm the boy had always been, how comfortable. Castiel remembers feeling very much alive that day.
“Actually, that's not bad.” The tips of Sam's hair nearly brush against the page. Dean thinks he catches Sam muttering something about asking Jess to help him out. He ruffles the kid's hair and takes a seat beside him, swinging his feet up onto the table. Groping around in his pocket for his phone that isn't there, Dean pulls out the book of poems instead.
Dean takes a seat beside Sammy, who's already busy working on some assignment or another. There are a few crumpled worksheets in Dean's bag that he guesses he should work on, so he takes them out and smooths them against the table. It turns out one of them is the assignment sheet for
“Yes, Samantha?” Dean takes a seat at the head of the table. Sam turns back to the frying pan.
“What astounds me about Adam and Eve is that God knew,” Castiel continues, “He knew that humanity would disobey Him. That’s why He created us. He cast us out of the garden, but he did not smite us down. Paradise was not made for us, Sam, it was made for us to leave behind.”
"We're not gonna see him until after New Year's, at this rate." Sam says.
A wave of dizziness crashes over Castiel.
Castiel sighs a long, slow sigh. The bruising on his ribs pinches on his exhale. He puts his phone down on the table. The back of his hand is purple and blue, puffy, and his knuckles are scabbed. A headache threatens to pound behind his eyes. On the table next to the salt and pepper is a row of Cas’ inhalers and medicines, organized in rainbow order.
Another gust of wind sends a flurry of yellow leaves up into the air. The colors are muted in the darkness, but Castiel follows them with his eyes until they fall back down to the bottom of Eden. It reminds him of Adra's hair, the color it was before it started to grey just a few years ago.
Sir Dean grins so hard his face might split.
Sometimes he and Adra sit and talk afterwards. Gabe is adjusting well, Dean picks his fur off of every flat surface in the house. Adra and him install shelves for Gabe to climb on all through the living room, even clearing a space off the massive bookshelf for the cat. Castiel’s medecine disappears from the table. Only a handful of them stay behind. One afternoon Dean is looking for floss, and there it is on the shelf behind the mirror, a dead green inhaler. Dean doesn’t leave the bathroom for twenty minutes, sinking onto the closed toilet and biting sobs into his fist. Then he gets up and washes his face. So it goes. Some nights Adra invites him to stay for dinner, and he does. Sometimes Sam comes along, sometimes he doesn’t. This is one of the times Sam doesn’t.
EDITED 27 JULY 2014
The video loads by the time Cas returns. The camera shakes for a second before steading and zooming in slowly. Dean is somewhere across the room from Sam. Both figures on the couch laugh, Sam throwing his head back and Jess leaning into his shoulder, shrouding her face in hair. When Sam looks back down, his eyes land directly on the camera. Cas hears Sam curse a couple times, then the screen shakes and the video shuts off.
He presses his forehead against hers, pulling out and panting into the thick air. They don't stay like that for long: the girl shimmies out from under him and collects her panties from under the seat. When she opens the door, Dean hardly feels the blast of cold. He fumbles with his zipper, maybe muttering something about doing that again, but by the time he gets himself together, she's already gone. He stands up shakily outside the car, with only a small twinge of annoyance. No big loss, he's not even sure he can remember the girl's name.
"Hey, man, I was meaning to say-- about your poem," Dean stumbles out. Cas tilts his head. "The one I sorta read at the library that day. I didn't mean to, it was just-- whatever. Anyway, I wanted to say that I get it. Like, all those feelings and shit you don't think about during the day, but then when you're layin' in bed and it all comes back t'you, like, shit..."
Finally. Somewhere Dean can find a little purchase. He can feel Cas getting hard in his pants, and his plan starts to change in his head. Bringing a priest to the dark side sure would make an impression on the big man downstairs, and Cas is really growing on him--doesn't hurt that he's pretty, either.
“Why are you doing this?” Cas asks, his eyes open and staring at the ceiling, his voice small and fragile. “What do you want?”
"Please," Cas murmurs, like he's still praying. "Let me."
“Are you scared?” he murmurs, confidentially.
The priest is praying in the front of the room, at an altar. He’s dressed in his dog collar (damn, Dean’s always had a thing for those) and his hair is carefully kept, his back straight, his head bowed.
Father Novak raises his eyebrows, scandalised. “Never, Dean,” he dismisses, as though Dean had suggested something truly awful. “The wine is for Godly purposes only. And indulging the body--”
“Whatever brings you into the arms of the church, Dean, we’re happy to have you.”
"Arms up, baby," he coaxes, pulling off Cas' shirt. He's all soft muscle under it, pink and pretty and fresh, and Dean will take his time on that later, but for now, he has other ideas.
“‘Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,” the priest manages, his voice firm despite the fear Dean knows he feels.
Cas makes a little whining noise, and Dean laughs.
The Impala door shuts with a thud after Dean as he scratches his nose and flashes his eyes black in preparation.
"I can give you that," Dean tells him, sliding his hands down Cas' chest. "I can put you in your place, Father. You come with me, I'll give you everything--power, sex, money, whatever you want, it's yours."
”Dean! I’m home! And I brought Jess!” Sam’s voice rings through the whole house.
Sam seriously considers what kind of supernatural monster his brother can be, only taking less than ten minutes every morning to get ready.
' I like it, talkin' about death being a release, and all that.”
"Have you seen how much Gabe sheds? Cleaning, Dean! Cleaning!"
"Shall we?" He nods. She takes his arm for the few short steps it takes to get over to his bed.
Their teacher sits in his office, shuffling some papers around his desk. A bright orange whistle hangs around his neck. His real name is Azazel Burgh, but everyone calls him Ice Burgh behind his back. Sam's never heard a kid say it to his face, but he can only imagine that a gruesome death would befall them.
Dean reads the text twice, then stares off ahead of him. There's a small flower pot with a tiny cactus in it on the windowsill, that Charlie gave him last summer. They had never had enough room for a real garden, and God knows Dean hardly remembers to water the cactus anyway.
"C'mon, I wouldn't ask if it was gonna be a problem."
"You look-- I mean--," Dean stammers, looking down. The break in eye contact is jolting, Castiel feels his stomach lurch. "To be frank, dude, you look awful as piss. I wanted to-- I mean, can I do anything to help?"
He wonders. He figures Cas will know.
Dean sniffs and backs up, putting the two boys at arms length.
"Dean? Cas? You guys alright?" Sam calls from out in the kitchen. Dean huffs like he's been interrupted.
. If anyone wants to read a -cough- better -cough- version of this wonderful world, there you go!
”No, I--” Cas hears Dean shifting, fabric rustling against the tile floor. Cas dares his eyes open for a moment, enough to see a very blurry Dean sitting cross-legged behind him. “I mean I’m… Sorry you got sick.”
”Well, don’t be a stranger! Come say hi to your dear old Momma!” She insists. Dean laughs. Charlie takes him by the hand and half-drags him into the kitchen.
“Hush,” Sam rolls his eyes. "Did you know that chess was invented in India?” Castiel perks up.
The story doesn't have much of a point, but it's enough. Sam relaxes back against Dean's hand. Dean can almost hear the tinkling sound of Mary's laughter from the back seat. This silence is much warmer.
Outside, Dean strips his jacket off and leaves it on the fountain edge. It’s a warm day. Castiel’s binder is full of the generations of Eden, starting with a handful of potted flowers from Walmart that Cas paid for with his allowance. They didn’t last more than a season, according to Cas’ scrawled handwriting. He wrote in all caps even back then, but it was much less legible. After a few seasons, it seems Cas got the hang of what was likely to grow and what wasn’t, occasionally interspersing an experimental plant or flower.
He worries, wiping his hands again.
Adra tucks an invisible piece of hair behind her ear. Her tattoo peeks through her shirt cuff. She shifts on her feet.
"Thank you, Sam." Cas' voice is barely a whisper. He folds the scarf up into his lap.
Dean hesitates. Cas’ hand is skeletal, and foreign at the end of Cas’ coat. Cas is staring at him, his lips tight and his eyes unblinking.
"I realize this is not as impressive as it could be." Castiel says. He feels Deans tep closer to him, following his lead as he walks past the willow tree to get closer to the fountain. There's only one path, but Dean isn't more than a step behind Cas the whole way. He stumbles more than once. "You're having trouble." Cas holds an arm out for Dean. He doesn't take it.
One of the lights on the chandelier flickers. Spoons clink against the bottom of bowls. Dean stares at John pop open a beer can.
“No thanks, teach, I think I can do it alone.”
“I saw your waterworks, Cas. I didn’t know you had a leak.” She says, laughing and sniffling at the same time.
"Well," Dean has to stop walking. He's quiet for a beat. "Shit. You're just full of surprises, aren't you?" Cas turns to face Dean. They're standing beneath a tall pear, sheltered just enough from the snow.
EDITED 6 AUGUST 2014
Castiel coughs.
. But he doesn’t. He sits in his seat like all of heaven is weighing down on him.
Sam moves a pawn one space diagonally right, taking Cas' knight. He tries to keep his smile down when he plucks the piece off the board.
There’s something very
Cas tries not to grimace when Dean looks at him. His chest is on fire, his throat is tight. He is sweating under his arms and freezing on his fingertips. He seriously, sincerely, wants to kill his boyfriend, and then take a long nap.
”I know.” Cas sounds tired, even to himself.
Standing behind the rocking chair, Castiel moves the pawn closest to the queen out a single space, setting it down slowly, deliberately. The rain is a light patter on the roof three stories above him. Closer, he hears the water simmering away on the stove.
”Do you find the movie offensive?” Cas has that look like he’s genuinely concerned for the movie Sam might want to watch. Dean softens at Cas’ look.
Putting clothes back on takes considerably longer than taking them off. Or it doesn't. Dean isn't too sure, honestly. His clothes feel heavy on his body, like they're tethering him to the seat.
“Dad out again?” Dean asks, as he's handed a paper plate piled high with breakfast foods.
“I'm fine, Sammy,” Dean snaps, sliding his hands against the wheel, feeling the worn leather ignite his senses. The car, not unlike the air outside it, is frigid. Sam dials up on the heat, and they both smile at the familiar rattling in the heater; when Dean was little, he wound up shoving some Legos up the front, and they never managed to get them out.
As if on cue, the front doors slide open to reveal Dean, with a younger, shaggy-haired boy trailing behind him. Castiel recognizes him: Sam is his name. They've shared a conversation or two whenever they ran into one another in the fiction section. Sam and Dean looks similar, Castiel won't be surprised Dean is the brother Sam had griped about before.
”We gonna do this?” Dean raises his eyebrows, expectant.
up above him. He puts the book down to smile at Cas.
Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes.
Adra takes a moment, looking from her son to Dean on the left flank, as if seeing him for the first time. Her eyes linger on the points of contact between them, with Castiel loathes to admit is shoulder, elbow, and hip.
Held firm against his friend, Sam weeps. Loud, childish sobs echo through the garden. Sam’s glasses cut into Cas’ shoulder. Cas pushes them up to Sam’s forehead. Dean comes forward and presses into both of them. Castiel is grateful for the warmth, the solid presence that is Dean Winchester. Castiel coughs.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean jumps. The lighter clatters onto the hood of the car and slides a few inches until it hits the ground.
“This is Eden, Sam,” Castiel says, “I planted it when I was ten.”
“Chased me out? Show your father some fucking respect! You owe me your damn life!” John shouts, “You wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for me.”
So, I've been writing on and off for a while. Mostly off.
Cas wanders over and sits on the couch, Sam joining him on the left. Dean comes over a minute later, eggnog in one hand and whiskey in the other, and squishes in between them. Sam turns the camera towards the trio, telling them to say cheese. Cas leans closer to Dean to try and get in the shot. The light smell of sweat and something purely
He turns around to Dean standing in the doorway, shrugging on his jacket. The Santa hat has left his head.
There’s a space up front in the room for Castiel’s family to stand. Dean mills awkwardly between Adra and one of the tissue tables, until Adra gives him a pointed look so like Castiel that Dean pulls up to her side and stays there. Sam follows him, and only then does he put his glasses back on. Jo and Ash pay their respects to the casket one-by-one, then make their way over to the rest of them. Jo sniffles when she shakes Adra’s hand.
“I’m very sorry for your loss,” the man says to Adra. By now a handful of people are looking at them. Up close, the man can’t be more than his mid-twenties. Dean takes stock of him as he shakes Adra’s hand: his eyes are dark and bruised-looking, and the beginning of some kind of rash is bubbling near his jawline. That pings something deep in Dean’s memory, but he can’t place it until the man says, “Castiel was a friend of my brother’s. Gabriel.” Oh. Lucifer. Luke. This is him. He shakes Dean’s hand, firm but a little too tight.
”Yeah, I understand.” Victor is nodding, adjusting one of his earrings. He’s looks like he’s least a year older than Dean. “And to have to leave so early, what a shame.” Dean wants to be disappointed, too, but he just chuckles.
”This one’s from Cas!” The gift is wrapped in shiny blue paper. Dean runs his hands over it, trying to figure out what it is without opening it.
Dean's chest pangs. He looks up from his phone; Sam's head is tucked against his chest and he's snoring quietly. Cas' eyes are closed, too. A mirror, indeed.
“Dean, come on. I'm being serious.”
"Fuck you." Dean rolls his eyes and gets to work.
"I love it," Sam insists. Jess beams. "I kind of want to hug it." He admits. He doesn't, instead he leaves the canvas next to him, and hugs the painter.
Sam's face goes soft, and Dean thinks he hears a sniff. Still not a word out of him, though. Dean rubs his thumb along an inch of Sam's collarbone. An idea strikes.
It’s a two layer bacon cheeseburger with extra ketchup, exactly how Dean likes it.
When the start-of-class bell rings, Kevin reminds Sam that he's having dinner with him and his mother on Friday night, before he skips off to the orchestra room. Jess gives the other two boys hugs before going into the art room. Sam and Brady start off down to the locker rooms for their first class, gym.
"Did you have something else to do?" Sam asks, a little more accusing than he means it to be. Dean sneers, glaring at the rim of his beer can. Sam has a sneaking suspicion it's not just Bud Lite in Dean's can
Gilda nods.
“Yes,” He decides. “But finish cooking first.”
He doesn't realize there's a hand thumping hard against his back until there's another mouthful of blood in the sink. And air! Sweet air, filling his lungs. The first few lungfuls he sucks in are desperate and gasping. He spits out another mouthful of salty mush. He gestures vaguely to the wall; the person behind him grabs a wad of paper towels and holds it out for him. Castiel wipes his mouth and tosses the towel away, grimacing. He takes a slow breath before turning to face his helper.
"Hey, Dean." She waves, smiling politely.
"I got him!" Sam calls, waving the paper towels in front of Rumsfeld, who stops licking Dean immediately. "C'mere, boy!" Sam clicks his tongue. Rummy's tail sprays water across Dean's shirt. "Rummy!" The dog nearly leaps over Dean to get to Sam, knocking a few chairs over on the way. Dean stands shakily, his shirt covered in muddy paw prints. There's a crash and thud from the back room, followed by the dog barking defeatedly. Sam curses. Bobby and Dean exchange looks, then go over to help Sam.
Castiel is positively radiating warmth beside him. Jesus H. Christ, are Dean’s fingers itching to rest on Castiel’s thigh. And maybe to slide up slowly to reach his--
. The photo itself is really nothing special: Castiel, just barely thirteen, standing in the middle of Eden. The fountain behind him glistens in the morning light. A bumblebee whizzes by his right ear, blurring in mid-flight. The plants around him block out the harshest of the sun’s rays. Cas’ trenchcoat is creased from it’s lack of use, and it hangs off him like he’s trying to drown himself in it’s folds. In his left hand, between his middle and ring fingers, sits a cigarette that is left permanently half-burning. A trail of smoke follows from Castiel’s lips up to the sky.
One part of him asks.
Slight chapter warning for alcohol, otherwise no specific warnings apply.
Dean ruffles his brother's hair again. While Bobby goes off to get the dog to his bed, Dean's phone buzzes in his pocket.
“So you would get flowers from Eden?” Adra asks. Dean’s face heats.
”Is there anything else you would like to say?”
"Where're you goin' with this?"
"I'm sorry, I forgot your meat for brains is what keeps you warm."
The exit to the parking lot seems a lot farther away than Dean thinks it should be. He stares at one of the white paint lines, not really looking at it.
"It is a genetic disease where my lungs become clogged with mucus. And it is likely that I will die prematurely." Dean takes his hand off of Cas at last. He misses Dean's touch already.
”I’m… I hate that you’re sick, Cas.” Dean’s voice is hardly a whisper.
“I’m just saying, if you’re forcing me to wear a monkey suit, I at least deserve to know why!” Sam whines, tugging at the collar of his crisp, thrifted white shirt. His hair is pulled back into a ponytail and he has a thick, purple scarf piled in his lap. “Also, will you ever fix your fucking car?”
"Yeah, I did," Dean huffs, "But--" he stops. He doesn't have any excuse, much less a good one. "Just drop it, Sammy."
“Thank you.”
When the bell rings for them to get back to class, Castiel is struck with the feeling of not wanting to leave. His cheeks are nearly straining with how much he's smiled throughout the single lunch period.
Unlike Dean's room, the dirty clothes in Sam's room are all neatly dumped in the hamper, instead of all over the floor. Dean sighs and hauls the hamper over his shoulder. Out in the kitchen, Sam's textbook closes with a thud. Dean lets go of the hamper for a second to ruffle Sam's hair. He's surprised the handles don't break from how worn they are.
The snow falls in larger flakes the more they walk. Dean manages to catch a few on his tongue. Castiel keeps his jacket open, the material of his sweater clinging to his skin like a blanket. Around the edge of Dean's neighbourhood is a sidewalk, getting layered with snow. The trees that line the sidewalk have multicolored lights on them, glittering like stars. It feels as if the world is hidden in a large bubble made from the clouds and snow. Cas' breath puffs out in front of him, thinner than the smoke. Both boys' boots crunch on the snow as they walk.
Dean comes by the Novak’s at least once a week, usually after school or after his shift at the Roadhouse. He helps Adra paint the kitchen until it’s done. Then he fixes up a squeaky rocking chair. Then he rotates the photos in the living room so none of them grow stale. He helps with Eden, tending to each patch with precision, watering them during the weeks with no rain. He always comes out of it feeling refreshed, newly alive.
A bluster of wind rattles the windows. Castiel drops the book in fright; the front cover flips shut. With a sigh, he leaves the book on his desk. The light from his desk lamp shines a dull yellow throughout the room, mixing with the moonlight. The windows continue to rattle. The light flickers once, twice, and then goes dark, leaving only the moonlight to pour in.
Kicking a couple pillows off to the side, Dean pushes his bedroom door open. It's not as clean as he thought it would be: the sheets that usually bunch up at the foot of his bed are thrown across the floor, following the pillows and some pizza crusts. A pair of muddy boots sits on the mattress. Unopened text books are used as a coaster for empty beer cans. And as usual, his dresser has clothes hanging off it like it's a coat rack. A crooked
“He got me from school,” Sam says. Oh. Oh. Dean looks at John, who’s biting at a hangnail on his thumb and not looking at either of them.
“I’m very sorry for your loss,” Luke says, in a way that says he isn’t, really.
There's another picture: Charlie in a crown, peering down at the camera like it's hardly worthy of her attention.
Back in the kitchen once he's collected himself, Castiel takes a long drink of water. He grabs his backpack and leaves the door unlocked. He walks to school feeling like a bumblebee: trying to survive while being very, very small.
“It’s just us, Sam,” Jess says, her voice high. Sam grabs her, holding her in a full-body hug. She’s warm around him. Her hair smells like oil paint and flowers. A little bit like Eden. She pulls him closer. Sam’s rosary digs into the space between their stomachs.
“Hey, Castiel,” she manages. Her voice is tight.
“Gabe. I know that’s not, uh, the best name for him, considerin’, but,” He starts, looking away.
"Sammy..."
He doesn't so much walk in as drag himself into view: his many layers of clothes all stick to him, and his shoulders are hunched. It's as if some of the storm outside got dumped into his head rather than onto it, from the way his eyes can't seem to pick themselves up from the floor. A shiver runs down Castiel's neck when the boy passes him, and he's sure it's not from the cold. Dean drops like a dead weight into his chair. The line of his jaw is tight, a few drops of water leaving a shiny streak down his chin. He licks his lips.
Cas only looks away when Sam stands up, wearing what can only be described as a horridly ugly sweater: there are a half a dozen reindeer prancing around on the torso, above a stitched
"Hey Dean," she nearly purrs into the receiver, "So, I was thinking..."
”Yeah, exactly!” Dean’s hand squeeze’s Cas’s. “You can live those stories, literally.” He tips his head back. “Fuck, I gotta take you some time. You could be a knight or something.”
"You dropped this." As soon as Castiel takes it, Dean turns away. Castiel runs a thumb along the creased edge, tucking it back into his pocket without unfolding it. He watches Dean yank the door open, following him just a step behind.
"Literally no one besides you and maybe Freak Boy, I mean, Sam, knows that." Brady teases.
Castiel dips two fingers in the cold water and makes the sign of the cross over himself: forehead, stomach, and one shoulder at a time. Sam does the same. The droplet on his forehead glistens in the low light. Castiel takes Sam’s dry hand and holds it in both of his. They take a deep breath at the same time.

“You’d like us to pretend everything’s fine,” Castiel finished for him.
Position: First song on side 2
Castiel listened in silence, holding Dean, and tried to ignore the sensation that his chest was caving in around his heart.
“What? She’s called Cas handsome like a million times!”
“Nothing’s weird,” said Sam. “Just, y’know. You’re taking your unconscious boyfriend back to your bedroom.”
“Because he’s—wait,” said Sam, blinking. “How do you know about Power of Attorney?” he asked Jack, bewildered.
Sam didn’t answer, opting instead to just snicker again and shuffle across the room with Dean and their charge. They settled Castiel carefully on one side of the bed and while Dean adjusted the pillow, Sam stepped back and chewed the inside of his cheek. “It’s weird. Seeing Cas without the trench coat.”
Dean answered by mirroring Castiel’s position to pull him in close and press their foreheads together. “Yeah, Cas,” he whispered, and let his eyes slip closed as he leaned in to steal a slow, tender kiss.
“Dean, wait!”
“Anything you worship could be a god,” said Castiel. “Well—in God’s eyes. Money, food, intellect, desire…”
“Yeah,” said Sam. He closed his eyes, and again, they were devoured by a purple flash.
Castiel rolled his eyes and let his hands drop to settle comfortably at Dean’s hips. “Like I said,” he mumbled, ducking his head to kiss Dean’s neck. “Insufferable.”
A little smoke and foam overflowed the lip of the bottle, but most of it made it into the glasses, which Castiel filled to the brim once the carbonation had settled, and then stuck the half-empty bottle back in the sand. “What should we toast to?”
Castiel hummed and shifted his weight, changing Dean’s angle. “I don’t mind.”
Sam ticked his head to Jack and he reached for the doorknob. He gave Dean and Castiel one last pained look, then slowly closed the bedroom door. Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean on the forehead, then gently extricated his hands and stood, walking to snag the first aid kit.
“What happened?” asked Castiel, thumbing over Dean’s hand.
Dean shook his head hard and swallowed. “Stop it, Cas. No. No, I don’t…” he paused again, lifting his other hand to Castiel’s cheek. “You’re right. Okay? It’s not fair. It’s not because I think you don’t—any of that. It’s because I’m selfish. And a coward. I’m afraid of my life if you’re not in it.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Castiel, tugging at Dean and shifting so that they were once again seated as they’d been in the car—Dean between Castiel’s legs, back leaning against the angel’s chest—and he wrapped his arms around Dean, still holding his hands. “I love it because you gave it to me.”
“So…he said yes?” said Sam, grinning.
Dean’s heart leapt into his throat, but he tried to keep it down, asking, “Talk about what?” as he pried open a beer and passed it to Castiel, then opened his own.
With his free hand, Michael snapped his fingers, and Castiel’s voice went silent. He pulled Castiel back from the edge and pushed him toward the treeline, setting off. “It’s fitting, your love of humans,” he said. “Considering you’re going to die like one.”
“But that’s when I was an angel,” he slurred.
Castiel beamed a wide smile and pulled Dean close. “Hold on tight.”
“I know,” said Castiel.
Sam frowned at Jack and his cereal and then grumbled, “Guess you are, like, an immortal with no cholesterol…”
“Rowena’s coming,” said Jack, hope edging against the nervousness in his voice. “She’s getting a flight to Kansas City and then driving here. She says she lifted one of Sam’s credit cards anyway and that’s how she’s paying for it, and she’ll be here by morning.”
He stood there in the dark, staring at the door, breathing as if he’d run a marathon. It felt like he was intruding on something incredibly private, some secret wish that belonged to Dean and not him, but—wasn’t he there too? Or a version of him. And wasn’t this also what he wanted? Castiel straightened his shoulders and stepped slowly back through into the room, where he found Dean and dream Cas still wrapped in their embrace, lips locked, oblivious to everything else in the world.
Castiel pulled the blade from his chest and sealed the wound with his palm as he sprinted for Dean, his wings and all the neon blue fading from view as he hit his knees beside the prone body. “Dean!” he yelled, checking for a pulse. The purple glow disappeared, and Sam was behind him in seconds.
Sam blew air through his nostrils. “Have you?”
“I do not!” said Sam. He shook his hair into his face, attempting to hide behind it.
Castiel was silent the whole way home.
“What is it?” Dean asked with more gentleness than Castiel ever remembered hearing, his eyes soft.
“Muscle relaxers,” said Sam. “Because
“Still think it’s bullshit,” he grumbled to Sam for the fifteenth time.
“Belial,” he said, grimly.
Dean smiled against Castiel’s shoulder and pulled back just enough to search his gaze. “Okay. But—that doesn’t work for me. I want you to be angry at this. I want you to
“I’ll take it to go,” said Claire, eyeing Dean suspiciously.
” a high, Scottish trill sounded from somewhere behind them in the dark.
“I think the extent of your delusions is pathetic.”
“Of course I don’t,” said the Michael creature. “But you do.” When Dean didn’t answer, the voice continued. “These fantasies have been keeping you complacent for me, but time’s up. You let your guard down long enough for me to get what I needed to return, and, well, here I am!”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Classic Cas,” he mumbled. “Those are—I dunno what those are. But they’re not either of those things.”
For a few long moments, Dean buried his head into Castiel’s shoulder, splayed his hands across the angel’s back. When they finally pulled apart, a nervous kind of joy settled in his gut. He couldn’t take his eyes off Castiel’s lips, his bright blue eyes.
“I was thinking maybe—no dinosaurs, here. In fact, I’ve hardly seen any animals larger than a fox, and everything seems to follow a vegetarian diet. I’m not quite sure what—”
“There now,” said Dean’s voice, but it wasn’t Dean. “You see? I can be merciful.”
“No we didn’t,” said Dean. He sniffed. “So that’s that.”
“I didn’t catch that,” Dean teased, panting into the soft skin covering Cas’s pulse.
Castiel’s brow furrowed and a hand reached up to touch those lines, lips creased, but Dean laughed and shook his head. “Nah, man. I like ‘em. They suit you.”
Castiel smiled in spite of himself, a swell of pride puffing up his chest, and he nodded. “That’s true,” he said, easing the car down the road once more. “They weren’t born knowing what they know, even though sometimes it seems that way. They had to learn and grow just like everyone else. Just like you will.”
,” said Sam. “We couldn’t get you to stop. So I need to know you’ve got your head on straight before I unlock you.”
,” Castiel said, the breath of a laugh escaping his lips. “And anyway. Aren’t you my husband now?”
Album: Aqualung (1971)
Jack’s voice came tensely through the receiver. “Sam, he’s—” and then his voice was drowned out by a dull ringing and the rushing of wind. The whole room shook for a moment, and when it stopped, Michael stood illuminated near the center of the circle.
“No, Cas. I mean yes—I don’t know. I don’t know how to answer that question,” Dean struggled. He finally looked up to meet Castiel’s gaze, and his face fell as he did, eyes raking over the angel’s expression. “Oh, Cas…” he almost-whispered, broken.
“Dean?” Cas asked, giving him a gentle shake.
“Alright,” said Sam, and lowered his hand. “Thank you, Rowena. Try to stay out of trouble.”
When it isn’t a date—when it’s babysitting, and even that goes wrong, and he has to admit his failure, he doesn’t bother trying to hide his shame. Dean can sense it. Says Cas must be hungry—takes him to a bar instead. But Cas has to work in the morning. Cas has to be the responsible one. So Dean gets drunk while Cas finds them a hotel, wrangles away the keys to the Impala, drives them to their room.
“Because one of the parents was a teacher, and I already sent in fake documents saying I could be a substitute,” said Sam.
“Cas…” he whispered and wound his arms firmly around Castiel’s back in turn. “What’s wrong?”
“Are we what, Cas?”
“Strange sightings in a morgue?”
How we feel today
“Yeah, whatever.”
him alive. …Dean? You with me?”
“I don’t mind,” Castiel said quietly, staring Dean down in rearview mirror. Finally, when it became obvious Dean wouldn’t look back, he said to Sam, “No, I never did. I was a soldier, was meant to be from my inception. There was never opportunity for partnership.”
Castiel sat up enough to tug his sweatpants down over his hips, and they fell loosely around his knees, exposing his hard length. He arched a challenging brow to Dean. “Get me wet.”
“Basically a chick flick on legs,” Dean confirmed.
“Sammy!” Dean yelled in warning, and the wolves engaging Sam both looked. Sam ducked just as Dean fired a silver bullet, their movements as in sync as a dance. The wolf the bullet was flying towards dodged death, but caught the projectile in her shoulder, letting out a screech of pain. She turned her attention from Sam, who was tangling again with the remaining wolf, and barreled towards Dean.
Castiel shot to his feet and wheeled around, again facing down the vessel from before.
“What’d I say about pots and kettles?” answered Dean, smirking. He rubbed his hands over his face, then up through his hair, pushing the wet strands back out of his eyes. When Castiel didn’t answer, he looked over, and found the almost-angel mimicking the motion, tousling his own dark hair into haphazard spikes. Dean’s smile softened. “The night we met, in that barn, that’s almost how your hair looked.”
“Long enough,” answered Dean calmly. He left his place and walked over to collect the book from across the room, dusting away shards of broken glass. “What’s going on man?”
Castiel knelt slowly in front of Dean, being careful of the broken pieces of record player. He glanced over to where it once sat, then his eyes trailed downward to find the pool of vomit in front of the desk. Castiel sighed and looked back to Dean, then his bloodied hands, and finally reached up to cup his cheek. “I’m real,” he said lowly, assuredly. “I’m real.”
That wasn’t Castiel’s vessel. He wasn’t sharing it with anyone. That’s where Castiel lived now. That was his body. That was Cas.
“SURPRISE!!!”
Dean didn’t say anything, but looking over his shoulder, Sam saw the tension leave Dean’s body in a hard shudder as he turned around and ran his hands through his hair.
When he sees Dean after thinking he was dead. He almost said ‘fuck it’ and kissed him then, but Dean’s mother was there, and it was all too much. Still, Cas wishes he had.
“Sam,” Castiel nodded. He narrowed his eyes and stepped further in. “Is everything alright?”
Dean cleared his throat. “No, I—I do. I love it, Cas. Just surprised.” From the boom box an upbeat song drifted gently on the wind.
“What do you mean?” asked Sam.
“Think so.”
It was the warmth that roused Castiel from unconsciousness—warmth that spread across his face and the skin of his naked arms, contrasted sharply with the cold dampness leaching into his t-shirt and jeans from below. He wondered, briefly, if he was dead—then he heard the birds. A songbird—a wren, he thought—or perhaps a lark or finch. Briefly, it occurred to Castiel that had he had his grace, he’d know which birds were singing, and even be able to translate and join them in song, and for the first time since losing his power, he felt bitter over its absence. He lay still and took in his surroundings in darkness: the tickle of six legs crawled over the back of a hand, prompting him to curl his fingers into the dampness—grass, he discovered; somewhere nearby, the soft gurgling of a river or stream.
When he finally speaks, it's a near-whisper; grating, and low, and I can hear his heart in his voice; feel the vibration of his soul, like I did all those years ago. "Cas, I...How--why?"
But sunset came on more swiftly than any of them would have liked, and before long they made their way back to camp to begin setting up for the ritual. Sam put together Belial’s summoning space while Dean worked on Michael’s, and Castiel paced between the two, helping where he was needed, correcting their Enochian.
“Not with him marrying her,” said Dean, scoffing lightly. He squeezed Castiel’s hand and shook his head. “Nah, Cas, they all say he’s the one who kills her.” He snorted humorlessly. “Kinda cruel, huh? Every girl Sam ever loved—I think he blames himself for them all. But there was this girl, a werewolf, he actually did have to kill her. Then the British Men of Dickbags got to Eileen, and his demon blood curse got to Jessica, now this. No wonder he’s freaked out.”
“He wants his army,” Castiel answered grimly. “He’s trying to bring them back here.”
Dean peered over to Jack and saw a mirror of his own heartbreak and was flooded with a wave of guilt. He’d been so caught up in losing his lover he hadn’t considered that Jack was missing a father, Sam a brother. Dean cleared his throat thickly and gave a brisk nod, the color in his cheeks rising. “No, he hasn’t, Jack.” He thumbed at a piece of bacon awkwardly and then added without looking up, “M’sorry. You’re hurting too, I know it. All of us are.”
Jack’s legs kicked out awkwardly as he shifted to look down. Sam just barely dodged one of his feet, and Castiel ducked on instinct. The next time Jack swung a leg, Sam caught his foot, instructing him. Castiel turned around to look for Dean and when they made eye contact, they both smiled. A peaceful warmth inflated Dean’s chest as Castiel said something to Dean, the words lost in the rustling leaves, and then started walking away—towards the table where Dean sat.
“That’s what she said,” answered Jack, looking worriedly to Castiel’s hunched figure.
“You and Castiel got them together,” Dean says, eyes widening.
"I did not know that. That's fascinating."
Sam moves his lips but does not make a sound. The sunlight reflects orange and pink on Sam’s glasses. Castiel coughs.
"Why don't you move that pawn over by that knight?" Dean asks, pointing to a couple of Cas' pieces. It becomes more obvious the more Dean speaks that he has no idea what he's talking about.
"I could be persuaded otherwise." Castiel says finally, still looking at his feet. When he looks up, Sam's smile shines like all the lights strung up around the trailer. it's that smile that convinces Castiel to be in a dozen more photos while they unpack. At some point, Sam switches his camera over to video mode and balances it on the back of the couch.
Castiel knows the moment Dean registers his tattoo, because he goes from an animal sort of hungry to a soft if confused sort of wonder. His mouth is slightly parted.
”You said that, too!”
Never a benevolent--
"I-- Yes. Very well."
Jo and Dean have been best friends since sixth grade or so, when Dean moved here for the first time. She'd showed him her knife collection and they spent most of a day carving their names into every tree they could find.
"Yeah, Cas, I forgot to mention. We do movie nights at my house every Friday, you wanna join?" Dean asks. Castiel's shoulders tense.
Sir Dean feels obligated to follow her order. He slides off of the bed and helps Charlie down after him.
