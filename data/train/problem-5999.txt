“Anthony Stark?”
“Thank you.”
Tony looked almost bashful then, stepping back a little and massaging his temple. “So…when you said you’d be dressing as my favorite Captain…I might have misinterpreted.”
Tony reached out, cupping his ass and tracing those wonderful abs with his tongue; his finger traced to Steve’s hole and he let out a loud moan. “You came prepared.”
“Like Mrs Barnes?”
“Well, I’m Captain of a spaceship; you’re Captain of a naval ship. Who outranks who?” Steve asked playfully, knowing he shouldn’t flirt but not quite able to stop himself.
Steve chuckled weakly, falling on his ass and leaning his head back against the car, letting Tony’s soft touches ground him for a couple minutes more before he finally felt good enough to stand. He noticed Tony’s silver Audi parked askew a couple meters away and Andrea leaning against it and he approached her with a small apologetic smile.
It just came natural for his hero to have an armor and sword, though he didn’t want him to be a boring character so he gave him a modern looking suit of armor, easier to wear and in flashy colors. He drew him fighting a villain in a more classic grey and bulky type armor. But his hero was smart and his armor had the ability to fly and he managed to defeat the evil guy and save the damsel in distress.
“Stark!” Bucky scolded loudly. “How the hell do you know all these Irish songs?”
Sam nodded softly and wrapped one arm around him after grabbing his keys and phone. “Let’s get you to a doctor.”
“For real?!”
Tony waved and wandered back in the room, dropping the bag on a chair and taking out the keys to Steve’s bike, rolling their wedding ring off the keyring and placing it back on Steve’s hand where it belonged. He then laid down on the bed, curling on Steve’s right side and resting his head on his chest.
“Get out of my office.”
Dreamt he was sitting on a couch in Tony’s lab and Tony was telling him about his past, about his family and his friends. Eventually, once he was done fixing the piece of armor, Tony came over and sat with him, leaned down to kiss him.
Just as it did and Steve was starting to feel a little hopeful about the situation, the pilot announced they were going to land and for everyone to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.
To be perfectly honest, Steve should start avoiding planes altogether at this point.
Bucky laughed and punched him lightly on the arm. “C’mon, how can I not like it?” He asked. “A billionaire weapon maker that gets mortally injured by his own weapons and builds himself a suit of armor that can keep him alive and uses it to save crime? It’s amazing! He can fly, he’s super smart and he’s got a troubled past. I could see this is comic book shops. You just gotta work a little on the alter ego.”
“I can’t control my own dreams…?”
“My boyfriend saved your life.” Tony muttered. “Even after you called him a gold digger. He jumped in front of a gun for you while the rest of your oh so trusty stuff ran to safety.” He spat.
Steve’s breath hitched as those random unnamed soldiers he could recognize from his time in Europe turned into familiar agents, into Clint, Rhodey, Maria, Tony. Fuck! He could see the blood pour out of the joints of Tony’s armor like some nightmare medieval torture device and Steve felt like throwing up, like this awful feeling of vertigo and pain would never end.
It didn’t take long for Steve’s movements to start losing rhythm under him, one of his hand gripping the side of the desk and the other wrapped around his cock, stroking in time with Tony’s counter-time. He was almost sure he heard the wood crack under Steve’s fingers. This desk survived years of abuse from four different CEOs and now it was going to give in to Captain America’s orgasm.
talking about the doo-”
The positive thing was that the biggest side effect was sleep. He wasn’t sick in Tony’s world. He could exercise and take Tony on hikes and picnics; they could travel the world in just a blink. Steve started praying to wake up one day in that universe for good.
Then it was the arctic turn, a baby blue that made his painting come to life.
“I’m very happy for your mother. She’s a lovely woman.”
“Yes.”
Once the plates were empty and the sun was completely down, Steve got up and closed up the windows and the door carefully, knowing if he were needed people would use the bell hanging from the door outside.
Tony was laying on top of him, head resting on his chest and fingertips caressing his ribs. “What will happen to me if something happens to you?”
“I won’t, Doctor. Thank you.”
Steve felt like a fucking idiot!
Steve rolled his eyes.
“Reed is here?”
The kid was self-absorbed and arrogant, smart sure but he kept making fun of his family, of Ben especially, in an almost cruel way; he kept flirting with everyone around him, calling them names. He was handsome but very well aware of his physical beauty. Using his powers and his role as Torch to hook up with some cute agent.
Tony.
It was in moments like this that his genius created the perfect opportunities.
Half-naked and sated, Steve laid on the cot in the small cell, Tony’s head resting on his chest, drawing circles with his fingers on his abdomen, playing with the curly trail that from his navel disappeared under his pants. “How are you so blond up there and so red down here?” He asked with a chuckle.
Listen, he was tired and his boy scout mostly vanilla boyfriend was wearing stockings under his pretty suit, cut him some slack!
Just metal and cold and blood and pain, pain, so much pain. Death surrounded his every moment, his every step, followed him around like a shadow. The soldiers he started to call friends, the friend he learned to call brother, the woman he wished to call love. It was impossible to outrun a shadow, even with superhuman abilities. Death caught up to him and the last thing he felt was glass, icy water cutting like glass against his skin.
“And if you need to, here’s the number to one of our specialists. Don’t hesitate to call.”
Tony huffed, leaning up on his elbow to steal a long kiss. “Because you love me. More than you love that shiny star on your chest, even.” He said.
Tony watched the three of them argue, partly enjoying the roast of his father but mostly pissed off any of this was so important to them.
“Fuck.”
Steve looked around, immediately recognizing Tony’s lab and Tony’s voice. He turned towards him and found him polishing a wonderful vintage car. “I’m not in control of that.”
Her eyes softened the moment she spotted him and she wandered over, covering his hands and squeezing them tightly. “He’s okay.” She told him immediately. “He’s okay, we removed the bullet and you can see him soon.” She continued.
“Yes and yes and…yes, thank you for reminding me.”
Tony had been to the Stark Industries party earlier that evening and got a few drinks with the R&D team. Then he went home and got a couple drink more to calm down: it wasn’t often one planned to make a move of Captain America. Finally, he changed into his pirate costume and well, a costume so elaborate and detailed would be wasted if Tony didn’t put real grog into his flask, right? Historical accuracy.
“I want you to see how good you make me feel. And once I’m done, I want you to fill me up. Not a moment earlier, Steve. Can you do that for me?”
“That would be fun.”
Steve nodded and stretched some before getting up, wrapping one of the sheets they ruined with wax around his hips and taking Tony’s hand, lifting it to kiss his knuckles. “We could try edible body paint.” He suggested as they reached the door. “I could paint you like one of my French girls, take pretty pictures and then clean it up.”
Steve shrugged and nodded. “Of course I would.” He answered without missing a beat.
“I can’t wait.”
“Tony? Baby? They say we can see him now. You there?” His mother called after a few minutes and Tony got up slowly, washing his face and his hands before he walked out, following them to Steve’s room.
A scream.
Steve and Bucky stopped, standing in the middle of the room like they were ready to throw punches and turned to Peggy. Peggy, who was sitting next to her crying wife and son. She stood up and came over, pushing Bucky back to sit down and pulling Steve on the couch with her, pushing back his hair.
She nodded, breathless and Steve called over a couple flight attendants to help him move her into a better position on the seats and moving to kneel in front of them to check on the situation. He went white for a moment at the sight, head spinning ever so slightly. He took a deep breath and then carefully started instructing her to push and pant as he guided the baby’s head out.
Steve frowned. “What?”
“To be fair, with all the parks and green, Italy would be perfect for werewolves. Vampires can enjoy the east and north Europe, vamps get the south and west.” Steve answered, always happy to play along with Tony’s theories.
Lord, he truly hoped he didn’t look as terrified as he was feeling now.
Tony exclaimed, spanking the Cap he already reached before he could change route to make it pass like a playful joke.
Coulson turned to look at him. He did not buy it.
Steve paused, biting his lower lip as he pushed back his hair. “Yeah…” He murmured, voice low. “That’s a conversation we’re having another time. But yeah, count me in.”
City: Verona
“Mh, that’d be complicated considering he lives in the 40’s…but maybe with time travel or…I got an idea!”
Tony almost felt guilty. Almost. “We wanted a wedding that would be about me and Steve, not about his money or your decisions or her attitude.” He replied, pointing to his father, mother and mother-in-law in the order. “No rich people to entertain, no long lost cousins that don’t even know the husband name.” He continued, looking again to Maria and Sarah. “And that doesn’t mean we don’t love you. We do and we’re gonna get married and have you two arrange all the big circus and do it the ‘proper’ way for the families and the press and everyone.” He reassured. “But the moment we said yes to one another? We wanted no drama there.”
.” He felt his throat close up and paused a minute, gratefully accepting the bottle of water his mother handed him and taking a couple sips before he unintentionally mirrored his father’s position, scratching  the label nervously. “My boyfriend came to you to ask you permission to marry me and you got him shot.”
“When his parents died he was still basically a teenager so he grew facial hair to appear older and handle the business but his father had mustache so he grew a goatee to make sure not to look too much like him because his father was kind of a dick to him.”
“Yes.”
“Want me to go sacrifice a bull to the goddess Aphrodite and ask her to make you come to life?”
“Language. There’s a kid.”
The light flirting quickly became heavy flirting and the casual touches turned into cuddling.
Steve wasn’t sure how he managed to keep steady in his position while the plane was landing and how the hell did this wonderful brave woman kept pushing through the pain and panic for what felt like the longest and most stressful ten minutes of his entire life.
He let out a breath of relief, grabbing one of the blankets and wrapping it around her and moving to place her on her mother’s chest, standing up as the paramedics arrived, helping as best as he could to move mother and daughter to a gurney and get them out to the waiting ambulance while the rest of passengers applauded.
“I like it.” Steve smiled. “So…you ever figured out if Cap’s gonna meet Tony one day?”
He took weeks to find an original phaser and a communicator that didn’t cost as much as his bike. Took his time to find the perfect uniform and the perfect boots to pair with it and the perfect accessories and he even went to a barber to get his hair to look exactly like Captain Kirk just so he could see Tony laugh and be happy and spend the evening together making fun of the agent’s costumes.
“Hey…hey Stevie, look at me.”
“Ah…because I love the way you sing them, dear.” Steve smirked. “And because I love the way people react to your awful Irish accent.” He added.
“I just know them better than you do.” He retorted. “And…in the remote possibility that they do marry in different occasions, you can split it. There’s a section about each of them and how much they mean to me.”
Men like Johnny Storm. That stupid asshole. Steve spent just ten minutes with him and already wanted to throw him off a window.
“Rogers?”
“Not bad. Our next wedding is gonna be insane.”
Tony frowned. “But you won’t, right?” He teased, turning around and looping his arms around Steve’s neck, kissing him slowly, feeling Steve’s hands on his back, holding him closer. “You afraid I’m gonna flash some poor old lady?”
“We asked! There’s no doctors on board. Nor anyone working in the medical field at all. I attended a few classes on emergency situations…it’s the best we have.”
“I never want children.” He muttered.
“No no.” Steve immediately told him. “No, you didn’t miss any special occasion. I just had a video interview with some boring press guy and put on something nice for it. And then I figured my pretty boyfriend would be hungry after a long day working and once he’s done I could take him out to that Chinese place that’s open late to eat a bunch of dumplings and get a tad tipsy on black beer.”
“I already am, baby.”
“Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.” He whispered before kissing him.
“Yup. Police outed me as your husband.”
Steve took only two steps to reach him and cup his cheeks, pressing their lips together almost desperately, pushing him back until Tony’s legs hit the side of the desk, pulling him to sit on it and stepping between his legs, pressing their bodies impossibly close.
(See the end of the chapter for
The black and navy gave a nice background color and the azure created the motion of a stormy wave but now it was really starting to look like the ocean, the wave starting up Tony’s left shoulder, rising on the muscle of his shoulder blade and then dropping down to his spine, following that perfect line halfway before turning right, following the line of his oblique muscles down to his right hip.
“We got 12’000 likes and the MOMA official account said they would love to host on a showcase of Captain America’s art.”
Tony was made of metal, made of sharp edges and sharp words, made of bright colors and cold attitude.
“I’d be honoured to.”
“I thought I’d go for a vintage look…and then set the whole thing during ww2.”
“Gorgeous.” He moaned, falling on his knees and letting Tony lick his fingers clean, enjoying the afterglow for a little while.
Prompt 2: Bacio (kiss)
[kissing him]
“Yeah, yeah…but—I don’t want them to write about me. I want to tell my stories to you.”
“Aren’t they doing more tests?”
Tony and Steve had been flirting ever since they stopped trying to punch one another and mourning the un-dead agent Agent.
“A full hour away.”
“I’m sure you did, lad.” Steve chuckled, grabbing a small oil lamp and placing it beside their plates after moving the important papers into one of the drawers. “Better?”
Natasha snorted loudly. “Last time I saw Steve he was talking to Reed.”
“And what if it doesn’t work, James?! What will you do after I die? How will you pay your rent and your mortgage if you have to pay my bills?”
Why him? At least Bruce had medical training, Clint had three children and Tony and Thor adored kids. Hell, even Natasha could probably do a better job than him, if only because she understood the female anatomy better. Steve grew up with a nurse, give him a wound to patch up and bones to set and he could do it but a baby? A possibly premature baby?! On a freaking plane! Mid-flight…
“I sobered up in worse places.”
Had another sold out exhibition, went to a couple conventions to say hi to his fans, took a lot of pictures with Iron Man’s cosplayers.
“Even more than that.” Steve agreed, smiling up at him. “Even more than that shiny cross around my neck.”
“Perfect, you’re perfect.” He praised, leaning down to kiss Steve’s jaw and cheeks as the soldier shuddered under him. “I got you. Just a moment.” He reassured as he stood up, leaving him long enough to grab his shirt from the ground, using it to clean up the mess before he undid the knots on Steve’s wrists, massaging them softly and wrapping his arms around him, stroking his damp hair, kissing him. “I got you. I’m here.”
“Where are the eyes that looked so mild? Hurroo Hurroo .Where are the eyes that looked so mild? Hurroo Hurroo. Where are the eyes that looked so mild? When my poor heart you first beguiled, why did ye run from me and the child? Johnny I hardly knew ye--”
“Tony.” Natasha greeted in a cold tone but the corner of her lips was raised, the only sign of her amusement and affection. “You smell like a true pirate.” She informed.
“So…what are we doing for my birthday?” Steve asked. “You’ve been very secretive about it.”
Steve kissed back, with much more experience than Tony had anticipated, hands landing with no hesitation on his shoulders.
Stephen wanted to say no. His body had other plans. Eyes that had been focused on the ornament to his side shifted, and just liked that he was captivated by the creatures eyes. They were wrong, his mind kept telling him. By the Flames of... Faltine? Seven Rings of... All-seeing eye of Agamo- Vishanti? He couldn’t even conjure up a real spell. They were all jumbled in his mind by a mist he couldn’t clear. It was becoming thicker.
“You don’t look too bad yourself, Captain.”  Steve replied, chuckling and reaching over to touch the eyepatch. “Did you pick just to make fun of Fury?” He asked and the look Tony gave him was enough to confirm that.
Tony looked down at the stains of blood on Steve’s favourite shirt and nodded at her, smiling softly. “Yeah, I know. I’m lucky.” He said, shifting the bag so he could offer his right hand to the woman, shaking it. “Thank you, officer.”
They got in the car and Tony leaned over to buckle Steve’s seatbelt, stealing the tiniest of kisses before starting the engine and driving off towards the sunset.
“Mum said you’d be too busy to.”
Tony didn’t take his hand, looking away for a long time before he stood up and hugged him, holding him almost hard enough to hurt. “Promise you’ll take care of yourself, Rogers.”
“How much are you contributing to the bills of the house you’re ‘sharing’ with my son?”
When the invites for the Halloween party arrived, Tony started joking about dressing up all slutty and sexy for Steve and he replied he would dress up as his favorite Captain then. He even winked as he did.
“What are you talking about?” He murmured.
“Welcome to the family.” Tony told him on the way back, leaning to kiss him on the cheek as he drove them home. Home at the time being their too small apartment in Boston halfway between MassArt and MIT where the kitchen window was stuck closed and the upstairs guy kept playing tango music every morning at 5 am, for some reason.
Steve spent hours and hours in bed, barely managing to drag himself to the desk to finish work for his clients. Luckily, the graphic designer studio that hired him did not have any issue in having him work from home as long as he respected the deadlines.
“And we can watch Survivor.”
“So will Bucky when he gives us the rings.”
He felt Tony’s lips stretch into a smile against his temple. “What’s her name?”
“I’ll still tell people it was me who inspired you when you were writing it. And if they make a movie out of it I’ll ask they cast someone that looks like me. Denzel Washington or LL cool J.”
He didn’t expect the Director to be the pet type, yet there was an old cat napping on a small couch, looking perfectly at ease on her bed with a couple toys.
Steve hummed in response, floating in his own head, letting thoughts move by, pushed away by the waves. He didn’t need to think, didn’t need to feel anything but Tony and silk lips against his own.
“Have a good night, Stark. Steve.” The deputy tipped his hat to them before he walked out.
His hair started falling.
Words: 814
Then he woke up.
“What are we doing here again?”
Steve arched a brow in what he probably thought was a sexy gesture. Nothing looked sexy about him right now. “I love when you’re jealous.”
“Nay, Deputy. My sweetheart had red hair but was not a redhead.” Tony smirked. “Talking ‘bout lower.”
Beautiful.
. Over and over and over. He was the one that introduced Steve to this fucked up family.
“You know there’s sex tapes of me around the internet, right?” Tony answered, leaning into the kisses. “My dick is very much public knowledge at this point.”
“I’ll be right back, I promise.” He told him. “And I’ll be right outside so this ‘nice’ doctor of yours better be careful.” He added.
The doctors were right.
Steve took in a deep breath, fingers digging in the sand as he laid down, looking to the side to where Tony was sitting, sipping a margarita.
And to think he felt bad when he got up from his seat and punched the guy square in the face.
It felt like I love you.
Bucky showed up to his door two days later with a FRAKTA blue Ikea bag filled to the brim with comics placed in plastic sheets and handed him a five pages list with characters and summaries of each of them, saying he’d be back to get them in a week and to please –PLEASE – do not eat or drink around them and not break the spines.
It felt real as they sat together watching TV and pushing away their nightmares, rambling of a society where war was finally over in every form, a world where the human kind was just that, everyone united as one. As a team.
Sam would call him or video chat with him almost daily, laughing and telling him stories and reassuring him that he would be back in no time. Bucky rarely answered his phone, though he knew he spoke to Peggy regularly. He already reached anger, the rest of his friends were still in the denial phase.
“…Tony?” He breathed out weakly and fell asleep once more.
Steve hummed, pausing and his cheeks tinted red.
“Oh fuck me…” He groaned and looked up, pointing to the two strongest looking members of the cabin crew trying to help him. “Alright, you two sit next to her, either side. Hold her and make sure she doesn’t fall from the seat!” He ordered. “The rest of you take care of the passengers. Someone go tell the pilots to make this a fucking feather landing and for the land crew to have paramedics ready the moment the doors open.”
“Shh, stop wriggling.” He breathed against the shell of his ear, enjoying the way Tony’s whole body shuddered in response before settling against the mattress again. That earned him a small kiss on the lips. “Very good.”
Tony laughed loudly, taking Steve’s hand and squeezing it tight. “You’re gonna revenge fuck me for our entire honeymoon?”
Tony put the file in the pile of the signed ones and paused, stretching his arm and hand and loosening his tie before he turned to his computer, switching to a different playlist and readjusting the volume so he wouldn’t bother the people outside his office before he grabbed another project report to authorize and started reading. He should really start wearing his glasses when he was working and had to write and read a lot.
Tony frowned at him. “At Firenze’s?” He asked. “Not the panna cotta?”
“You like beans, Stark?” Rogers called loudly.
Tony moaned, licking and nipping the Captain’s lower lip. “That was hot.”
Tony smirked and bumped their noses together gently while kissing him.  “You could try.”
Steve kissed him with a chuckle. “I could never forget you, Tony.”
“So pretty much 15% to the 85% Tony puts in.”
Steve blinked his eyes open, letting out a small sound as his mother took the chance to keep them open and tell him to follow the light. “…no.”
“Yeah…but probably Ashley.”
Tony gave him a soft smile and leaned up to kiss him before he settled back in his arms, holding him close.
Steve took off his hat as he entered the sheriff’s office, wiping his brow tiredly with his forearm and sighing heavily as he wandered over to his desk to grab some water. He stopped in his tracks as he noticed Bucky sitting there, massaging his temples with a sour expression.
“Hey, beautiful!”
Brows arched in pleasure, brown eyes half-close, those long lashes drawing beautiful shadows on his cheeks, swollen lips parted. His body was still for a moment, muscles tensed, his cock shooting thick ropes over Steve’s abdomen, painting him with his pleasure, claiming him with it.
“Get the fuck out of my office.”
“I’m naked all the time at home.”
Prompt 3: Lenzuola (Bedsheet)
“I was hoping it’d be more…adult?”
He just wanted to surprise Tony while he was working on the launch of the Starkphone 5. Instead he was stuck 35’000 feet in the air, a full half an hour away from any available landing spot with a moron who boarded the plane drunk and tried to attack one of the cabin crew and a very pregnant lady going into early labor because she heard the moron and thought he was some hijacker trying to crash the plane.
“Are you kidding me? Steve, you had a seizure. You scared the shit out of me and Angie.”
His mom had only been working at the Stark’s for a week, but Steve was already irritated with the family. She was working long hours with very little to show for it. Maybe he wouldn’t have minded as much if she was in better health. With his soft spot for his mother, though, they could give her the moon and he would still know she deserved better. After all these years of caring for Steve, she deserved a break more than anything else. She needed one, too. Try as she might to hide it, Sarah Rogers was not immune to her ever-increasing age. Steve saw how she rubbed her feet before she went to bed and how tired she seemed in general. How the Starks could see this and still work her as hard as they did was something he’d never understand.
Or, well, he was about to. But then they both heard the door open. They both turned their heads and Jackie was standing there, jaw dropped almost to the floor. “That’s not what I meant when I said talk to him!” she squealed. “But I’ll just go ahead and leave you two alone. It wasn’t important anyways. Coach Stark, I’ll see you at practice later.” She all but ran out of the room after that.
Steve snapped his head over at Tony, who was grinning. His mouth was still glistening.
The screen went black and Tony, as expected, pulled his feet out of Steve’s lap to slink back to his room.
Steve’s brain started to come back online. He stuttered, “Oh, um, yeah. Work out. Right. Gotcha.” That didn’t sound right. What were we talking about?
“Who?” Steve asked.
So he just nodded and said, “Okay.” His voice was weak. A lump was forming in his throat. When he looked back up, she’d closed her eyes again. He stayed with her all afternoon, until he needed to go to his after-school job. Maria was still sitting in the hallway when he walked out. She closed her book when she noticed Steve.
Steve rolled his eyes and got back to work, angling his book so that only he and the wall behind him could see his work. Tired of being reminded of his mother’s failing health, he flipped to a new page and let his pencil decide what he would focus on next.
“That’s what this is about? Steve, you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. You walk in here, criticizing me, and you don’t even know what you’re talking about!”
Mr. Stark had just asked Steve what he wanted to do after he graduated high school. Steve stumbled through his prepared, “not sure yet, just want to support mom,” speech.
Finally, the movie wrapped itself up in a bow. As the last few scenes of the resolution played out, Steve realized he didn’t want it to be over. The contact was really nice and would miss the warmth.
A few minutes later a familiar looking goatee and smart, piercing eyes stared back at him. Shaking his head as if to clear it, he closed his book again, though gentler this time.
Tony waltzed in and threw himself on the opposite side of the sofa, nose in a technical looking magazine. Before he could start reading though, he lowered it and did a double take of the room. “Wait a second, what’s happening?” he asked.
Apparently Howard and Maria (mostly Maria) thought it would be a good idea to do some family bonding in the form of a family movie night. Steve had tried to avoid it, citing his need to visit his mother after work. Ever the understanding hostess, Maria informed Steve that he should get as much time with his mother as possible. What Steve hadn’t realized, though, was that she took the understanding all the way to his boss, who, when he tried to clock in for work the next day, assured him he could go visit Sarah instead without any worrying over his paycheck size. So, now, here he was, having just returned from a longer-than-normal visit with his mother, seated on one side of the large, plush sofa in the Stark’s living room. Maria was seated in a comfy looking chair to his right as they waited for the rest of the family to join them.
“Nice shirt,” he said to Steve, quiet enough that only they could hear it. The rest of the table was engrossed in conversation about something, but Steve had gotten lost minutes ago.
Tony walked back into the room with a smoothie in his hand and now that Steve was actually paying attention he realized Tony must have been working out. He had a line of sweat down the middle of his t-shirt that made it half-way see through.
He wakes up one morning to the worst news he could have and will ever receive. He knows he should’ve seen it coming but he really thought she would pull through. His mother passed away -- in her sleep, they tell him-- and now the person he loves most in the entire world, the person he would trust with anything, who he always knew without a shadow of a doubt was on his side in life, is gone. For her, he knows he will push on, but for him it feels like the end of his rope. The weight of his grief feels like it will suffocate him.
, Steve thought,
Steve is caught off guard. He doesn’t know how to answer that. “I guess I just.. I know that she’s always with me and I know that she’d want me to keep moving forward. It’s all for her I guess. It always is,” he finally says.
Days later, on his way to the teacher’s lounge, Steve was still pondering the Tony conundrum. It was personal then? He just didn’t like Steve? Or, he just didn’t like art? He hadn’t been around to poke fun at Steve recently and Steve wondered what had changed. A couple voices tore him out of his thoughts.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck as he laughed. “Yeah, well, I was using my anatomy studies as an excuse, and I was in quite a bit of denial for the better part a week, so… yeah, you’re shirtless in a few.” Then his eyes widened. “Actually, maybe stop flipping now, there might be something more graphic in there from Monday. Monday was… especially tough.” Steve said as he lunged for the notebook.
“Relax, Jack. I just wanted to tell you that if Mr. Stark keeps bothering you, you should either say something to him or let me know about it,” he tried to gauge her reaction as he spoke. He wanted to know just how often this sort of thing happens. She looked confused.
He grinned back at her, “And you don’t worry enough.”
“Trouble sleeping love?” she asked softly.
He crosses the room and gets under the covers behind Steve. He settles in with his arms around Steve’s waist, as if he was holding Steve together. Tony doesn’t talk much when they’re like this but today he says, “You’re handling this so much better than I would. How are you staying this strong?”
Steve’s not sure what makes him say it. Something about the excitement on Tony’s face maybe. Regardless he responds, “No, that’s okay. You’ll just have to excuse me if I jump a million times.”
“Steve, hello. Might there be something I could help you with?” he asked.
“Steve,” she tried again.
“I appreciate it sir,” Steve said diplomatically, pointedly avoiding looking down at Tony’s gaze.
She grabbed his hand and stroked it. “I’m always with you and I will always be with you. Remember that when you are afraid,” she said. “And when you are lost you will always find your way again.”
Steve shucked off his t-shirt and tried it on. He looked in the mirror as he buttoned it up. Jarvis was right, his shoulders were certainly pushing the shirt’s limits, but it didn’t look too bad.
Steve spends some time just sticking to his routine of school, homework, sketching, and visiting his mom to distract himself. Though as he’s busy wishing this problem didn’t exist, a cruel turn of fate makes the Tony problem pale in comparison.
Steve, still recovering from the t-shirt realization, stuttered back, “Oh, no, it’s just, it’s... yeah.”
“Well you ought to come tour at Stark industries sometime! If you like it, we could set you up with a summer internship. If things go well, that’s a great way to get into a good college,” Howard interrupted. He seemed really excited, so as awkward as Steve felt, he couldn’t blame the guy. He didn’t have the heart to tell him there was no way in hell he could afford to put himself through college.
“Please, Mr. Stark, I don’t want to let him down.” That sounded suspiciously like Jackie, but it wasn’t near time for her to be at school yet.
“Oh really, because this is the first time you’ve spoken before thinking about the party on the other end of the joke, huh? All you care about is a laugh.” Steve was absolutely fuming. Stark didn’t even care that he’d embarrassed the girl. Steve could handle when it was directed at him, but at the kids? There was no way he’d sit back and watch that happen.
Steve continued to spend as much time as he could with his mom. Some nights when he couldn’t sleep he would sneak out of the large house and drive down to see her. The receptionist always let him in. He tried and failed not to think about the implications of the bent rule.
Steve pondered the scenario. For argument’s sake, let’s say Tony had her best interests at heart. How does that explain his constant picking on the arts?
“Oh stop talking and just kiss me Rogers.” Tony laughed.
“See you, kid,” Tony called after her.
Her jaw dropped. “What?”
Then Tony had to go and open his mouth.
Steve grinned back.
It had been almost a week since the incident. Well, the second incident, Steve guessed. Stark hadn’t gone back to pestering him and Steve hadn’t even seen him in the teacher’s lounge since. He found himself missing the quips about his art, if only so he had something to be annoyed about. It was not helping that Jack kept stopping by with funny stories from the physics room. It was also not helping that his anatomy studies had all included a goatee very similar to Tony’s own lately. Definitely just a coincidence though.
“I’ll wait outside,” Maria told him.
Groaning, Tony got up and walked into the kitchen.
Maybe it was a good movie; maybe it wasn’t. Steve wouldn’t know. What Steve did know? That Tony smells
“Hey, sorry to bother you so late..” he trailed off, eyes running over Steve and likely taking in his pajamas, which consisted of boxers and a white t-shirt, “I just thought maybe you’d want to watch a movie or something.” After a few seconds of silence he added, “Or, it’s cool if you’re tired or whatever.”
“Well it’s a good thing you didn’t. No stop, don’t make that face, that’s not what I’m getting at. Follow me,” Steve said while pulling him toward the door.
Rubbing the back of his neck, Steve explained that he needed a shirt to wear tonight.
Three episodes in Tony’s hands on Steve’s stomach started feeling a little warmer. In his ear, Tony said, “Steve. I want to make you feel good… and I understand that it might not seem appropriate right now, so feel free to tell me to cool it, but I promise that I just want to take your mind out of reality for a little while. You deserve to feel good Steve.”
“Tony, there’s no judgement from me either way,”
Not knowing what was possessing him, Steve handed the notebook to him. Only after he passed it off did he realize exactly
Steve coughed into his hand and straightened up, “Well like I said, I just don’t think I can afford to quit my job for a whole summer, especially with ‘ma in the hospital.”
“I’m getting predictable, huh?” he replied, just as soft.
Tony looked like he was about to retort but just then Howard stole their attention.
The first thing Steve thought about when he got to school Monday morning was how awful track season was. You’d think it would be football, or basketball, or even baseball that drove him crazy. With Tony Stark as the track coach, though, it was track season that peeved him most of all. Their accolades were over-celebrated to the point that Steve couldn’t even walk down the hallway to his classroom without seeing multiple posters. He’d already walked past a couple students gushing over their new uniforms. New uniforms! He swore they just got new ones last year. The art room hadn’t had any upgrades in about a decade! Yeah, blah blah, another art teacher mad about the lack of emphasis on the arts and over-emphasis on the sports. But, was he wrong? No! His students had to bring their own supplies if they wanted anything worth a damn. He rolled his eyes as he unlocked his classroom.
Tony chose then to speak up, “What’s there to think about? It’s a great opportunity.”
Steve turned his head toward him, “Mr. Stark,” he said, leveling him with a cold, yet polite, look, he continued, “I’m just taking in all the excitement for the upcoming season.”
She smiled, “Steve.”
“You’re going to have to stay with the Starks. I’ve already talked to Maria about it. They’re more than happy to have you with them.”
When they got to Steve’s classroom he found his own sketchbook. “I wouldn’t have had time to make these if you’d made your move before. How am I supposed to get the guy without a gesture of my own?” he asked, offering the book to Tony.
------
He went to see his mom as often as he could afford. Each time he was afraid the receptionist would look at him with a sympathetic look and tell him she had passed. At least she would finally get to rest.
“Mr. Rogers!” Jackie’s voice startled him out of his inner monologue. “Thank goodness I have your class today. I can’t handle any more of the outside world today,” she giggled as she waltzed in and took her seat with a plop, dropping her bag to the ground. She was always one for an entrance. Despite the oftentimes disruptive behavior, she worked hard in his class and he enjoyed the energy she brought to the room.
“Well, I’ll have to think about that sir.”
Jarvis led him towards Tony’s room. Steve mentally crossed his fingers that he wouldn’t be in there.
“Could I see Steve in the office for a moment please?” the school secretary poked her head into Steve’s calculus class and startled Steve out of his thoughts a few weeks later. She seemed a bit uneasy, which worried Steve.
Tony put his hand around Steve and pulled him closer. Steve now had his face hidden in Tony’s neck. He kept it there for the majority of the film to avoid seeing the gross or scary parts, but he suspects he might’ve found an excuse to keep it there even if the rest of the movie had been about puppies.
“What’s up Mr. Rogers?” She greeted him more formally than usual, probably sensing his serious mood.
and Steve was having a hard time sleeping knowing that just in the other room was Tony, naked, and doing
“I’m listening,” he choked out.
make Steve feel better about his mother working there. The place was huge; a reminder of everything they didn’t have. Their son, Tony, was a spoiled brat. He was late to dinner without so much as an apology. To top it all off, they didn’t seem at all grateful that his mother spent day in and day out cleaning up after them, cooking for them, and whatever else they asked of her.
“Tony, do you ever think about other people?” And wow, okay, he hadn’t meant to start out that harsh. He’s fed up with Tony and he’s hit a boiling point, alright?
Steve was overcome with emotion as he looked down at the pages. They were Tony’s own work and many were of Steve. There were a few of him in his classroom, bright eyes while talking to students, one of Steve concentrating on one of his own pieces, and even a couple landscapes, including a track. “Tony, you, wow. How long have you been doing this? These are amazing,” he said when he finally drew his attention away from the pad.
Steve’s heart thudded in his chest. “I—Tony—”
-------
But anyways, now Steve knows he has a problem on his hands and he also knows that Tony is probably aware of said problem. So Steve really hopes this internship Howard won’t let him forget about pays as much as Howard makes it seem because he has
The rest of dinner was alright, especially since Tony stalked off grumpily before dessert, but Steve still thought his mom could do better than a place that didn’t care enough about her to pay her a fair wage. If they could have their son in tailored shirts, they could afford to pay his mother as handsomely as she deserved.
Raising an eyebrow, Tony wordlessly held his hand out to Steve.
So Steve was starting to feel a little less out of place with the Starks. He enjoyed quality time with them to the point that he began looking forward to it. He liked to cook for them occasionally to show his appreciation for their generosity. But, that didn’t mean he didn’t still miss his mom. Sometimes, especially at night, it all felt like too much.
“No, Tony I –”
“You’re right,” he repeated.
Tony’s face seemed pleasantly surprised as he flipped through. He must not have gone all the way through it, because he didn’t burst into laughter or give any other sign that he’d seen the portrait of himself. Instead, he nodded his head, said, “I’m no art critic, but I’d say you’re pretty talented,” and wandered off, sipping his smoothie.
It felt amazing. Tony was swallowing his cock like it was the best thing he’d tasted since Tuesday. Steve, in the middle of receiving the dirtiest act he’d ever participated in, couldn’t help but feel a swell of wholesome love in his chest. Then, Tony looked up at him with those big brown eyes and it was all over. Steve had never seen anything so beautiful. “I’m -- Tony, I’m,” he tried to warn him but Tony just kept sucking on him in the most perfect way and soon he was shooting down his throat.
Steve loved feeling close to Tony, and this came as a surprise to him. Of everyone on the planet, the guy who was rich and spoiled was the last person he thought he’d ever fall for. Not that he was falling, it’s just, he wasn’t as bad as Steve had convinced himself before.
Tony looked up with glee as he stiff armed Steve and turned away from him. “OH really? Rogers, you? It must be Christmas,” he giggled. Then the bell rang and he straightened. “Okay, lucky for you, I don’t want us to get fired over some nudity you angst-drew but rest assured this conversation will be continuing later.
Tony looked embarrassed. “Well, I may have snuck a few photos of you teaching class. We can’t all do that from memory.”
She was always just as he left her, either sleeping peacefully or awake, but always in bed. A smile always spread across her face if she was awake when he arrived. Tonight was one of the nights she was awake.
Jackie laughed. Now Steve was confused. “No, Mr. Rogers, I’m serious. We joke with each other. His class is actually my favorite class. It’s a grand old time. You should stop by sometime. Is this about what I said last week? Because, really, I give it right back to him. Plus, you know how I love attention. Thank you for looking out for me though, Rogers.” With that, she patted his arm and went back to her seat.
But now, looking for Jarvis, it was convenient that he only had to take a few paces to knock on his door. Jarvis opened the door after a few beats. He seemed a little confused, which was probably because Steve had done an excellent job at keeping to himself so far.
His ears are ringing and his vision is filled with tears. He’s still taking his anger out on his sketchbook when he feels someone wrapping their arms around him.
To Steve’s surprise, Howard just chuckled and said, “Oh, nonsense. I’m sure it’d pay better than any other job you could find around here. Plus, with a recommendation from me, you’d probably have colleges throwing money at you afterwards. Really, you should think about it.”
“Well, I was going to show you eventually!”
“You’re right,” he said.
With a deep sigh, Steve spares a glance at his comforter. Tony looks back at him with concern, his own eyes wet. Steve realizes he has never seen this much emotion on Tony. Emboldened, he grabs his hand and squeezes. “Thank you,” he forces out.
“Oh, yeah, the team is excited for our first meet this year,” he said while looking around at the various posters. “Gives everyone a bit of a boost, ya know? But don’t worry, Rogers, I’m sure your kids are excited too. What do you guys have this time of year? That weird assignment with all the feet? Anyways, I’ll see you at lunch, I’ve got to go set up for class. We’re starting electrostatics this week and I want to demonstrate Millikan’s oil drop experiment to get the kids excited.” He patted Steve on the shoulder and left in a hurry.
When they get back to the house, Steve goes straight to his room. He curls up in his bed knowing his mom would understand if he didn’t get up for the rest of the day. Just as he’s resolved to do just that, his door creaks open and Tony peaks his head in. His eyebrows are raised in a silent ask for permission. Steve gives it to him with a small half-smile and a subtle nod of his head.
“You know exactly what I mean. Jackie today? Making fun of her in front of the whole class? Teacher’s should be safe people for students. They should protect them from bullies, not be the bullies themselves.”
“Okay great. Jackie?” Tony looked at her expectantly.
And so he did.
“You know exactly who. I don’t know what happened with you guys but Mr. Stark hasn’t joked about you in two weeks and you’ve been moping since the foot due date. And I don’t think our projects were that bad,” she quipped immediately. She was actually a lot like Tony, Steve realized.
Tonight was definitely one of those nights. Steve was in his room working in his sketchbook when it all became too much. His vision blurred with tears and he let himself take some time to just cry it out. He thought he heard something outside his door so he silenced himself and waited. When he heard nothing he sighed and got ready for bed.
“You don’t need to look at that,” he said, but he sounded resigned.
-----
that was a bad idea. Holding his breath, he prayed Tony would get bored before he got to the last page. Anything else in the book wasn’t nearly as incriminating, unless you counted the numerous sketches of his ma. Even Tony didn’t have the heart to make fun of him for that right now, he figured.
“Your mother is sick Steve. She’s in the hospital. I figured you’d want to see her,” she said as she put her hand up to his shoulder.
But as it was, he didn’t end up seeing most of the movie.
“Oh c’mon. It’s not like anyone missed me.”
-------
-----
So Steve has a thing for Tony. He realized it when he was laying in bed after the scary flick. Okay, fine. Not the end of the world. Minor inconvenience? Sure. As long as it doesn’t develop into the sort of thing that has him literally drooling when Tony gets home from school, he’ll be alright.
He had to admit the food was good though. After the main course was served his spirits were lifted immensely. He was starting to suspect he had just been hangry…
Steve squeezed his eyes shut as a tear rolled down his face. “I don’t have a clue,” he croaked out. “I already feel so lost.”
Tony narrowed his eyes and pointed his pen at Steve. “Nuh uh. I know how this one goes. No insults today; I mean it, Steve. Not today,” he said.
His heart pounded waiting for the answer.
“I’ve been trying to get Steve here to come out to the labs. I thought we could show him around and maybe set him up with an internship for the summer,” he said, smiling widely at Steve.
Or at least he thinks so. He’s less sure about his previous convictions after Tony comes into his room straight out of the shower to retrieve a shirt Steve had borrowed wearing nothing but a towel and his chest still glistening. Steve is doing his absolute darndest to commit the sight to memory so he could put it on paper later when Tony looks his way and catches him staring. Steve, in a panic, dives right into a coughing fit before Tony has a chance to comment.
Tony relaxed a little. He sighed, “You know, Rogers, you ought to loosen up.” Then he slapped him on the shoulder and left.
Tony gives him a deep kiss, filled with a lot of emotion, before sliding down to where his hand was doing things to Steve he didn’t know were possible. Before Steve could think about what was about to happen, he felt Tony’s wet, hot mouth close over the head of his cock.
Steve stiffened but didn’t take his hand back. Then he sighed, “Alright.”
“No. I haven’t wanted anyone else ever since I saw my portrait in your sketchbook and realized I had a chance.”
“Okay, first of all, that’s private. Second of all, I’m going to pretend you didn’t just ask me to help you cheat on an assignment. Does academic integrity mean nothing to anyone these days? Third, what the hell is so bad about letting down Mr. Rogers? The guy’s already got his mind made up about you so you’re in the clear, right? Geez, besides those biceps, what’s so great about him anyways? Okay, forget I said that. But really, you’re going to have a late assignment and the world isn’t going to end.”
A couple days later, when Jackie was back in his classroom, Steve called her over to his desk.
Tony scoffed. “Then quit the job.”
They ended up having a picnic in the bed. Only a few crumbs ended up in the sheets. After that Tony put on a sit-com that was probably good when you weren’t wallowing.
“I’m so sorry Steve. I know this must be hard for you,” she said. “I’ll drop you off at Yuni’s. If you don’t feel comfortable staying at your place alone you can pack a bag after work and you can move in a little earlier than planned.”
They stay like that for hours. Eventually one or both of their stomachs growl and they have to get up to eat. The mood stays somber but Steve is able to go until bedtime without bursting into a sob again, so he’s calling that a win.
Embarrassed by the comment, Steve said, “At least I was on time.”
“You’re not gonna deny it? Be stubborn about it? Spend another week and a half moping before you decide to still not take my advice? What the hell, who are you?”
She looked up at him and smiled. “Come here Steve,” she said.
“Rogers— “
------
“I jumped to conclusions. I’m used to you teasing me and I just assumed the same thing was happening with Jackie when she mentioned the hurdle incident.”
Steve disagreed but didn’t want to argue.
“Ah, speak of the devil!” Tony rounded the corner while Steve’s brain was still in the middle of short-circuiting. “I’ve got a ball of stress right here that needs to talk to you about something. And, while I personally would prefer to continue avoiding you, my loyalty to this walking panic attack requires that we work something out. Soon, preferably, because I just started some coffee in the lounge and I know it’ll be gone if I’m not back soon.”
When he’s alone the weight feels crushing. When he’s with Tony it lets up enough to let him see the light of tomorrow.
“Is that my --?” he started to ask. Then he mumbled under his breath, “Oh, right, the dinner. Nevermind,” and brushed past them into his room.
Tony’s face was red as he flipped through. “And you were calling me creepy? I don’t have a shirt on in some of these!”
Steve furrowed his brow. That didn’t sound very nice of Tony. Steve might be a bit biased when it comes to Jackie, and even more biased when it comes to Tony Stark, but he couldn’t imagine having the gall to taunt a student like that in front of a class. “Well that wasn’t very nice of him,” he said back.
He feels Tony nod in response. He holds him even tighter after that.
He sat down at his desk and sighed. He needed to be in a good mood for the students. This was supposed to be a happy classroom, after all.
Steve shook himself out of his shock. “No, no, that sounds perfect. Is anyone else, uh, joining us?” Steve asked, wondering if a nightly visitor had been caught by a parent at the door and now needed an alibi for being over so late. Though, now that he thinks of it, he hadn’t heard any late night shenanigans from the genius’ bedroom for quite some time.
The day of the funeral is hard. Steve stumbles through his tear-filled speech but he’s able to get through it. He feels his heart sinking with the coffin as it is lowered into the ground.
“Before or after you threw them in the trash?” Steve joked.
The movie was actually pretty good. Steve found himself fully invested in the emotions of the characters. It was a little bit action and a little bit drama. At one point there was a jump scare and he almost spilled the popcorn. Tony snickered and reached over for a handful. Steve ended up handing him the whole bowl a few minutes later. He’d had more than enough and didn’t want a repeat embarrassment.
When he got to the office he realized why. Maria Stark was standing right there in the office, looking solemn.
“Ma,” he started. Shaking his head he sighed, “I knew they were working you too hard.”
“So are you working on something that private or is it just me you don’t want to see what you’re working on?” he asked.
Steve turned back to Tony, an easy smile on his face. But then he glanced down and saw the corner of a sketchpad thrown in the trash. He reached in to grab it out while Tony protested.
His day turned around very quickly once classes started. One of Steve’s great joys in life was helping others create the art they could feel in their hearts. Plus, he only had one of the classes students were required to take today, so most of them actually wanted to be there today. Always a plus, he laughed to himself.
He tried to convince her to find a new one but she insisted it really wasn’t so bad. He didn’t believe her.
But a couple minutes later Tony came back in with a large bowl of popcorn. He offered it to Steve without looking at him and went back to reading his magazine until Howard arrived. Still in his work clothes, he loosened his tie and sat in the recliner.
Steve guessed the worst part about the new living situation, aside from his mother’s missing touch, would be Tony Stark. Dinner was one thing, but living under the same roof with the spoiled brat would be another scenario entirely.
“No, Steve, you don’t have to say anything.”
Jarvis had been very helpful when he’d moved in. Steve felt comfortable asking him if he might be able to set him up with something he could wear tonight. Steve, Tony, and Jarvis all had rooms in the same hallway, which had come to annoy Steve immensely in the few nights he’d already spent here. Tony had a habit of bringing girls over, which was fine.
“Thank you Mrs. Stark. I think I’ll be alright though.”
After hours pass and they’re still like that, Tony asks him not to move and disappears for a bit. He returns with food and water.
“Language,” he said, and got up to leave.
Tony looked sheepish and said, “No, I’m pretty worn out tonight. Just want to relax.”
Tony bristled, “Damn right you do. What the hell was that the other day? I thought you knew me better than that.”
Scoffing, Tony said, “Take a chill pill Rogers, I’m not into plagiarism,” and continued into the kitchen.
“Steve,” she was squeezing his hand and trying to regain his attention. His eyes were squeezed shut. He didn’t want the tears to fall out. If his mom was not planning on going back to work soon, then this was worse than he thought. He thought he’d have to fight to keep her in bed.
“Shhh.. I know. I know,” they say in his ear. They rock him back and forth and keep whispering in his ear, “You’re okay. I’ve got you.”
“It’s no one’s fault Steve.”
“Well today Mr. Stark thought it would be funny to tell the whole class about my disastrous tryout for the hurdles! He even showed them the video of me hitting three in a row and then actually face-planting on the fourth. Guess I’ll be sticking to sprints again this year.” She rolled her eyes and started getting out her supplies for her current project.
Steve smiled. “That’s definitely a little creepy.”
“Actually Steve, before you tore my head off I was planning to wrap it in a bow, plop it on your desk and make a pass at you,” Tony shot back, tilting his head like he knew he’d won.
Whatever Tony was about to say was cut off by Steve taking his hand. He held Tony’s hand in both of his own, tracing over his knuckles. “I’ve always thought you have beautiful hands Tony,” he said softly. “But that’s not what I came here to tell you.” He looked up at Tony. Tony’s eyes were wide and he was speechless. If Steve were thinking about it, he might realize how rare it was for Tony to have nothing to say. “I came here to tell you that I’ve never seen the amount of care that you put into everything you do from anyone else. I, that’s---. It’s everything I want to see in the world. I let my jealousy blind me and I am done. I’m done pretending I don’t love every ounce of your attention. I’m done pretending I don’t spend all weekend waiting to see you again. I can’t take back what I said to you, but I can ask for your forgiveness.”
Steve let out a relieved sigh and reached for the book again.
“Rogers! What’re you annoyed about on this fine morning? Spring is in the air, my friend!” a cheery voice rang out from a few feet down the hall.
Just as they’d exited Tony’s room, Tony rounded the corner into the hallway.
Friends? NOT the first word Steve would have used. Steve cocked his head. “Well I can’t speak for Jackie but I sure as hell think you ought to put a little more thought in the next time you think you’re being funny,” Steve finished coldly.
Steve hesitated. “Yeah. But it’s not your fault. It’s mine. I-I…” He smiled sadly. “So, you and Johnny, uh? I didn’t know you guys were that close.”
“…yeah.” He let out a breathy chuckle as Tony uncovered his eyes, leaving him gasping for a moment as his eyes got used to the dim light of the bedroom, to the gorgeous view of a naked Tony Stark straddling him and smiling down at him.
“Hey…my daddy issues have nothing to do with Howard’s alcoholism.” Steve chuckled a little but stopped when his head started aching all of a sudden and he took a minute to recover. “I really like him. I think he’s a character with a strong sense of self.”
“Look at me”
“Jan-“
“I’ll be going then” he stated, and once again he was going nowhere. They were right back at their awkward goodbye.
