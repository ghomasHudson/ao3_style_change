Because, as much as Castiel had no way of knowing that at the time, Dean had to process both his brother not looking for him and going on with his life
That’s as much as Dean’s going to do, and he knows it. Cas will allow his hands to knead his ass cheeks all they want, but everything else will be like
Castiel was so startled he looked around frantically for a few moments, before realizing Dean wasn’t in his rented apartment. Dean’s voice was in his head.
At the same time, the other two secondary genders are also screwed over. Alphas and betas are raised to always act in relation to this notion. Since omegas are bitches, alphas need to be strong tops, so they can provide for their mates’ needs properly, especially when in heat. It stands to reason, then, that showing weakness, physical or mental, is out of question. No weak alpha would ever be good enough, not even for the least desirable of omegas. Hence, alpha boys and girls aren’t allowed, not even as kids, to cry or complain. “Stop whining, that’s something reserved for omegas,” “Good alphas don’t cry,” “Stop behaving like an omega and alpha up.” These are just a few of the most recurring ‘words of wisdom’ young alphas are raised with. The number of alphas who live their lives feeling inadequate is pretty high as a result. Unless they are not only by nurture, but also by nature, sexist assholes who truly believe being born with a knot automatically makes them top dogs, that is.
“Sorry, ’m sorry, but,
So he plasters the fakest of smiles on his face, gets the big guns ready – you don’t get to occupy Castiel’s position if you don’t have a huge brain and an uncanny ability to beat into submission those who dare cross you, and aren’t afraid to use either, or both, when needed – and steels himself before addressing the slimy individual approaching him.
That’s the thing with Castiel. He’s clearly a strong, independent, smart man that can take care of himself, has been taking care of himself all his life, but he’s also this sweet, good soul that makes all of Dean’s protective instinct kick in until the only thing he wants is to tuck him away wrapped up in a soft blanket until no one can touch Cas except Dean himself.
Castiel chuckles. Trust his boy to see right through him. “Yes, I suppose it was predictable I wouldn’t resist,” he concedes. “What else?”
There’ll be time to analyze that later though. He needs to call Cas right the fuck
span of time," he concludes on a smirk.
Castiel huffs a laugh and shakes his head again as he starts platting Mildred’s breakfast. Yes, he definitely loves his job.
. Complete, utter
"God, you're perfect, baby," Dean says out loud, because he wants Novak to know that's how Dean sees him.
“The sooner we get these errands out of our way, the sooner we can come back home and busy ourselves with a few of those things, if you want.”
Cas is wearing midnight blue underwear.
The drive home was as tense as it could get, Dean's skin buzzing in anticipation, and he frankly appreciated Castiel keeping his hands to himself while he was driving. He was supremely distracted as it was, he might not have been able to avoid crashing against a tree if Gorgeous had put even a single finger on him. Dean was under the impression this
He should be understanding. Because he’s aware that he’s a little sensitive right now and also that he'd be on Cas like white on rice too, if he was in the kid's shoes.
“Someone’s eager,” he comments, mirth clear in his voice.
Cas huffs a laugh and rolls his eyes again. “You’re an incorrigible man, Dean Winchester.”
Dean stops right in front of him and, head high, replies, “I am.”
Even without him saying a word or lifting his gaze, Dean’s body gives his reaction away. He’s deduced what’s in store for him and
Castiel is looking at him with a ‘that’s rich’ expression. “What could I have possibly had do to with it? We haven’t met in over a decade.”
And as Dean’s lying on the couch, his boyfriend’s beautiful, soft cock in his mouth, trying to understand why the writers of
Cas knows what Dean’s words will be even before he opens his mouth.
Which is why, when the time came to decide who the children’s guardian should be, Dean suggested Balthazar. That shocked both Cas and Balthazar himself, who thought – swearing he would never underestimate Dean again from then on – his initial reaction to their relationship would have caused for him to always being placed at the sidelines of their relationship. Dean simply replied with a shrug and said, “Look, it’s just a suggestion. We are lucky we have many people, between you and me, that would take care of the kids if something happened to us. But if it did, if something happened to us, I know for a fact Balthazar wouldn’t give up on our babies, ever. When he loves and protects, he loves and protects in spite of everything. I want that for our children. Plus, he literally lives a couple of blocks from here, so it would be a practical choice too. The kids wouldn’t even need to change schools.” Cas’s soft smile was a reward Dean treasured, like he always did. Balthazar’s shiny eyes were met with a “Aww, don’t get chick flicky on me, man”, “Fuck you very much, Dean” instead.
God. Dean couldn’t even begin to imagine living like that. How strong is this man, and everyone else who find themselves  in a similar condition and yet keep going?
What Dean sees makes him feel like the luckiest man in the world.
Castiel’s so close to orgasming, he can feel it in the warmth and pressure gathering low in his belly, and he knows Dean’s close too. He can see and hear the tell-tale signs. But he also knows Dean will do whatever he can not to come until his Dom says he can. He knows not to take without being granted permission first and that’s how he likes it the most, he likes to
Dean really needs to ask his next question, right? He can’t put it off and he can’t let himself live a lie, if that is what this is.

It doesn’t help that the judge is Walker, who’s a fucking homophobe, and sounds like a broken record with his string of “objection sustained” – never, mind you, overruled – when Dean is questioning the members of the gang of high school seniors who have beaten a junior to a pulp because he’s gay. They will be sentenced for aggravated assault and battery for sure, the victim’s seated in the audience in full view of the jury and the signs of the attack are still pretty evident on his body, including the cast and bandages following the reconstructive surgery the kid had to go through to put the nerves in his right hand back in place. But if Dean wants these monsters to get the maximum sentence – and oh, does he want that – he needs to prove it wasn’t just an assault, but a hate crime following a long period of targeted harassment because the kid is queer. Dean believes in justice, he believes in having individuals like those who are taking the stand today face the consequences of their action, and he believes in the teaching power of exemplary sentences. Dean cannot, will not, allow the kids in that school to believe that you can brutally attack a rainbow kid because he isn’t straight and get away with a slap on your wrist. But that fucker of a homophobic judge is doing everything in his power not to let that happen, while at the same time pushing Dean closer and closer to getting himself sentenced for contempt of court.
“Yeah?”
You have a witness to grill in less than five minutes and the DA will have your ass roasted with a side of grilled potatoes for dinner if you fuck up this trial. Not to mention
“So, what would you like me to play?”
“Thank you, Sir,” Dean replies automatically. They had to work on that, on Dean learning to accept and acknowledge praise, and it’s a basic rule of their scenes that he can never, ever refuse or downplay his Dom’s praise, or leave it unacknowledged. Castiel has his work cut out for him with his baby boy, but he’ll manage to
For his part, Cas is more than determined to not take more advantage of Dean than strictly necessary. So when Dean suggests he could buy Cas some clothes for the first few days at work, Cas counter suggests that Dean might keep lending him some, as they are mainly the same size, until he gets his first paycheck. Dean almost has a stroke at the thought of Cas in his clothes again and again, since apparently he has a possessive kink a mile long that gets activated right away when his clothes are on the man, but it’s not like he can say no without it being suspicious (‘Try obvious…’) as hell. Cas seems extremely pleased when Dean agrees and seems to love to choose what clothes to wear in the morning while Dean is in the shower. Doing naughty things based on even naughtier thoughts.
“They disowned me as soon as they found out.”

“No.”
Dean has said he needs a minute, after all. They can very much spend that time getting to know each better, right? And satisfy Castiel’s need to know that Dean hasn’t been with anyone else after he became a part of his life. Please let it be so.
Either’s Cas is toying with him the way Dean had toyed with him in his school, or he’s actually busy and giving him, indeed, a chance. Castiel
“She did. I refused. I didn’t do it to be paid back, it was just the right thing to do.”
Or how their foray into sexting had soon devolved into mushy texting.
Dean just opens his mouth in reply, mischievous green eyes locked on his. That’s when Cas knows he was wrong just a few moments ago and this will, in fact, be the last chocolate he feeds Dean. This last display of Dean’s trust and eagerness has broken all of Cas’s restraints. He needs to get fucked soon or he’ll go crazy. So he grabs one chocolate and places it on Dean’s tongue, hoping his boyfriend will take the chance to lick on his fingers, which he promptly does. Cas lets Dean’s tongue swirl around his digits for a few moments before taking his hand back and placing it on Dean’s shoulder for leverage. He needs to bend backward to put the plate on the table and he’d rather not embarrass himself by slipping from Dean’s lap and falling ass first on the floor.
“Dean?”, Cas asks, concern evident in his voice just as much as it is in his eyes.
Dean’s family were delighted instead. Cas and Dean spent Christmas with them that year for the first time, and the whole time Dean’s folks kept telling Cas how Dean had been talking about him since junior year in college, when he came out to them and told them about what had happened between them in high school and how much he was sorry about it and regretted it. Cas later told Dean that his family’s words had made him fall for Dean even harder and faster, because they were further proof that Dean had really thought about him all along. Not that he needed it, but it was still great to have confirmation. Dean’s mother Mary, also known as ‘The Traitor’ from that day forward, even
Dean’s coming before the last word leaves Cas’s mouth, the idea of pumping his boyfriend full of his come – of him
“No, no it isn’t. Whatever you’re feeling is not stupid. Wanna talk about it?”
Dean’s never chuckled so much in his life like he has ever since he and Cas adopted the twins. “Yes, Cat, Uncle Balthy.”
As usual, thanks for all the love you are giving this fic and me. I appreciate each and everyone of you so, so much.
That's mostly because he and Gabe come from a pretty well-off family. A wealthy, strict family more focused on keeping up appearances than forming strong and meaningful familial bonds. Reason why, as soon as he figured out he was as gay as they come, Castiel also decided he wouldn’t tell his parents until his 21st birthday had come and gone and the money in his trust fund had been safely transferred to his bank account. That meant Castiel became pretty skillful and creative in finding alibis whenever he wanted to fool around with a boy growing up, that was for sure, but all those efforts paid off when he did come out to Naomi and Chuck and, as expected, was promptly disowned. Which was followed by Gabe being disowned too when he told them he had accepted Castiel’s offer to go work at his hotel.
Novak’s eyes turn a shade darker and he’s quick to nod as emphatically as he can with a sizable cock still keeping his mouth preoccupied, causing himself to choke a little in the process.
“Mm, you beg so pretty.”
Castiel didn’t dare hope Dean might feel for him what he feels for Dean. But he does. He just said so. How is this possible? When did this happen? And, more importantly, how could Castiel have missed all the signs?
“Yeah, well.” The ‘I’m in no position to believe in promises’ remains unspoken. Dean hears it loud and clear anyway.
“Dean-,”
“And you’d open your house to a stranger? A hobo? What if I attack you and steal from you?”
them to fight over it and he even instigates it on purpose sometimes. Again, Dean doesn’t give much of a fuck about what’s on TV, but Cas always seems so happy when they have one of their little battles to decides who gets to choose what they watch that night, so Dean’s always ready to oblige and is even starting to find it amusing too. Needless to say, Cas wins 90% of times and Dean’s OK with that.
Something came up for tomorrow, so I figured you'd be happier to have this one day earlier than later :-D
“Very well. Follow me.”
He spent the first leg of the journey with his thoughts, or just generally enjoying the view. After a while though, the silence and the open roads started to seem endless, so he decided to pull over first chance he got, take a break, and then go back behind the wheel.
“How about when you moved here? Were you as excited as I am?”
They’re greeted by an open space which includes a well-stocked kitchen and a living room, all decorated in warm, earthy colors. Well taken care of plants are placed on the sill of the huge window dominating the space, a yoga mat and what Dean can imagine are scented candles – lavender, if he had to wager – are on the floor directly in front of the window. From where he’s standing, Dean can see the corridor that, he suspects, leads to the other rooms of the apartment, including Cas’s bedroom. He wonders if he’ll get to see it tonight. Or maybe the couch will do. Or the chairs. Or the floor. Come to think of it, the walls could also be an option.
When Novak’s hand closes around them again, Dean speeds up the movement of his own hand, Novak following suit, and kisses him again with renewed desperation. The pressure of Novak’s left hand on top of their heads is heightening every sensation for Dean and it doesn’t take long before they both come panting in each other’s mouth, Novak first and Dean soon after, as a result of the amazing feeling of the other man’s dick jerking violently to let his release out while pressed against Dean’s and of the almost pained sound Novak’s tried to suppress in vain.
First off, the usual heartfelt thanks to everyone who's read and left kudos or comments or subscribed/bookmarked so far. I know that many people tend to avoid WIPs in the fear they won't be finished, so I really appreciate the trust you're putting in this and me ❤️ *throws  cookies at you as a token of gratitude*
“Yeah. Um, there’s a 24/7 diner near here, you know?”
He’d also have to call Jeff and tell him he’d need a few days off before showing up at the restaurant. Luckily, his absence would be less problematic to deal with for Castiel’s boss this time around. He had learnt from his past experience with Sue and, thanks to the fact that he was far less in need of money than he had been when he started working for her, had accepted a job with regular 8-hour shifts and a weekly day off. Which meant that there were other people covering the other shifts and they could cover for his absence. Castiel had done the same for them, he was sure they would do it for him this time.
Nothing, however, absolutely
“Don’t worry about it, Samandriel, accidents happen,” comes Cas’s reply, his words and voice a bit strained.

“Don’t be,” Dean orders, “I
When the kiss breaks, they just look at each other and smile, and it’s clear they’re both fighting a horde of emotions and cannot believe this is real.
“Cas, baby, I know I’ve been bratty and I don’t deserve it, but can I ask you to do something for me?”
“I mean,” Dean starts, but stops when the feeling of Cas’s channel around his cock and Cas’s moans get overwhelming. “I didn’t particularly like it before, that’s true. But I like it. With you,” he concludes, panting a little. He’s finally sheathed to the hilt and he needs to rest his forehead against Cas’s and close his eyes to calm down a bit. Fucking Cas feels so good, every time.
Except, he had apparently called as soon as he got here. He might have lied about that, of course, but his tone, and his rambling, was genuinely delighted and apprehensive, as if he couldn’t believe he was finally able to speak with Castiel again. Him being busy with a Skype call when Dean called the first time had actually being a lucky coincidence, as it had given Castiel the time to get ready to talk to him when he called back – right on time, not one minute earlier or later than expected. Castiel loathed to be or feel blindsided, and blindside him was exactly what Dean had done. Castiel had stopped considering a call from Dean a possibility weeks prior.
“I’m so sorry, Mister Novak, I don’t know how that might have happened!”
We go back to seeing things from Dean's perspective here.
His lack of understanding must show on his face because Cas smiles indulgently and tells him “There’s an engraving on the inside.”
. Dean didn’t realize it at first, because Novak rarely parts from his ill-fitting tan trench coat that totally hides the treasure the court reporter packs underneath. But after the first time Dean saw him remove it, he’s started paying attention and has noticed that the man’s body is
going to say that out loud, but Cas was totally right. When you hit the 30 year old mark, little things that were amusing before start getting worrisome and more than a little annoying.
If Cas truly wanted Dean’s bad boy persona, or just a good fuck with a hot guy, that would probably break Dean’s heart. But Dean needs to know. He knows that, in part because of his guilt, in part because of Cas’s admittedly exceptional looks and personality, and in part because your first real crush will
Dean’s eye roll is unexpected, and totally exasperated, as if he can’t believe Castiel is this dense. “I don’t want this, Cas. I want
“I’d rather you did that once we get back home,” Cas says, voice aroused and fucking sexy.
“Like before,” Dean begs, “please, like before.”
“Just,” Dean forces himself to say, licking his lips, “give me a minute. I’ve been thinking about this for so long, just let me enjoy the view.”
He then balanced his weight on his feet while his grip on Cas’s hips got iron-like, and got back to thrust fast and deep into his beautiful boy’s hole. Dean was so lost in his pleasure he even put his hands on Cas’s shoulders first, and around his neck then, to yank him back on every forward thrust of his hips, secretly thanking his young age and blissfully great physical shape in spite of too much pie for the strength in his thighs that was now allowing him to basically mount Cas and go impossibly deeper without ever slowing down. The sound of his hips snapping against Cas’s ass echoed in the room and mixed with Cas’s moans and Dean’s groans. Literal music to Dean’s ears. But he knew from experience his good boy would never come untouched without a little help.
Dean is
what people, especially men, think when they look at his mouth and he’s never had any reservations to play into the cocksucker lips stereotype to ensure his sexual gratification and his partner’s. And it’s not that Dean doesn’t want to keep hearing all the delicious noises Novak is making. He
Dean knows he probably looks like an oversized and overeager puppy, but he couldn’t give any less of a damn. Because right in front of him is Castiel Novak. The one that got away. Well, the one that his embarrassing, mean, stupid, spoilt, mean, scared, confused, mean, big-headed, cruel – and let’s not forget

more than he gives, and Dean loves it. He loves that Cas feels safe enough to be with him like he’s never with anyone else.
forgive – and start communicating with honesty, as hard as that would be.
Novak just nods, too far gone for words, and Dean can only push his tongue between those parted lips, hungry for anything he can take from this man. He then hides his face against Novak’s neck, inhaling his scent, getting drunk on it, and focusing on the pleasure radiating from his groin. He’s about to speak again when Novak’s hand closes on their cocks too, helping Dean’s hand complete a perfect channel for their dicks to fuck into.
good and the place really nice, but the costumer service... I mean, that dude sure is weird.”
After a whole week of being literally forty minutes too late to fuck his good boy before closing time, Dean was desperate enough he almost broke his own ‘no funny business during business hours’ rule and told the waitress “I’d like to speak to the manager” when paying for his coffee, just so he could have an excuse to go to Cas’s office and fuck him so hard they’d heard him scream all the way to the mechanical engineering department.
He’s about to go to bed a couple of hours later, when he hears a knock on his door. A quick glance at the clock tells him it’s past 11PM, so he goes to check the door with a furrowed brow. Who the hell knocks at someone’s door this late?
“Noth -,” Dean needs to clear his throat, “nothing, I,” a sigh is also a good idea, “I’m just happy to hear from you.”
He actually enlists the help of Gabe and Meg - the latter all too delighted to make fun of him for how mushy the whole thing he’s planned is. Dean doesn’t take offense though, he knows that in hell, where she clearly comes from, kindness doesn’t exist, so she can’t be faulted for being unable to show some.
“Speaking of which... the cough medicine you gave me seems to have helped too. This was the first night in weeks I didn’t wake up coughing my lungs out. So, you know, thank you. Really.”
“And is there... anything I can do? To possibly shorten my probation period?”
Dean knows Cas is coming before he even feels the warmth of his come against himself, because his teeth clamp down on the back of his neck as Cas tries to muffle his groan of pleasure, and the pain Dean feels from that goes to mix with his pleasure in a delicious loop.
When their burgers arrive, Dean accompanies his first bite with a moan that would win a Pornhub award, and Castiel’s dick chubs up a little. Castiel himself wouldn’t be opposed to be the cause of such a sound coming from those pretty lips. How much he’s attracted to this man is a

There goes nothing.

wants it. He’s already used his hold on Dean’s neck to tilt his head backward so he can suck bruise after bruise on his skin. Cas’s a fan of marking Dean, the more visible the better, “so people know there’s always someone taking care of you.” Not “someone who owns you”, “someone you belong to”, no. Always “someone taking care of you”. That’s what love is for Cas. Not owning each other, but taking care of each other. He’s also started moving his hips in little figure eights that are causing their hard-ons to rub against each other deliciously, and Dean hopes Cas means to move things along rather than dragging them out, because Dean’s being on the verge of coming in his pants ever since he’s seen Cas sitting on the backseat, so he’s not sure how much more of this sweet torture he can take.
See you next time, you stay safe out there, ok? :-******
And that was a good thing too, considering he wasn’t planning on going anywhere.
“That’s the best part.”
’. And then he does what he’s wanted to do for months. He throws the remote somewhere and surges forward, his hands going for Cas’s neck and back. Cas groans and gets even closer to him, and Dean grabs the chance to slide his tongue inside Cas’s mouth. He’s kissing the forbidden fruit, and the forbidden fruit is kissing him back just as eagerly. He’s almost having an out of body experience, that’s how absolutely indescribable it all feels right now. He can’t believe he’s finally, finally tasting Cas. The man tastes like his own toothpaste, and it shouldn’t be such a turn on, except it totally is. Just further proof that Cas is here, he’s staying, with Dean, and doesn’t seem to want to go away any time soon. That was the biggest of Dean’s fears when he offered Cas a roof above his head when Dad hired him. That he’d have to see Cas go when he’d find his own place. But Cas doesn’t even seem to be looking for one, and, with this new development, maybe he never will?
But when what that sentence earns Castiel is a hopeful and pleased smile, he can’t really see any fault in his logic.
Cas has been mostly silent so far, just asking a question here and there, but he’s listened to every single word Dean has said. Dean knows he’s being measured. Castiel
But it’s also past 10 PM and tiredness starts showing on Cas’s beautiful face. He needs to get up at 6 o’clock since breakfast starts at 7, so this is probably around the time he usually goes to bed.
Only once he’s satisfied that he’s taken the time to watch all his beautiful boy has to offer from head to toe, he gives his first order.
Castiel goes to bed excited and worried in equal measure, but his last thought is something along the lines of maybe tomorrow being the day when he’ll finally get to taste Dean’s lips. That kiss is long overdue. Fifteen years overdue.
And Dean already knew what it meant to lose him. The spike of panic waving off of Dean that Castiel had felt when he and Dean were talking in that motel room, and Castiel had confessed that he was afraid of going back to Heaven because seeing up close the devastation he had caused there might have brought him to put an end to his own life had likely being nothing in comparison to pain Dean must have felt when Castiel had been killed.
Dean kept licking inside and around his boy’s hole for a little longer before draping himself over him to whisper in his ear “How does it feel, beautiful? To know that I have been inside of you in every possible way now? My fingers, my cock, my
They’ve been working round
These are hard times for all of us. Social distancing isn't a joke, especially in the long term, and I am eternally grateful we have this platform where we can keep each other company. I hope everyone has the support they need. But if you need someone to talk to, or just wanna chat and fangirl/fanboy over our ship, I'm here. Hit me in the comment section & we'll find a way to chat privately.
Still, Dean can’t help but put a hand on Cas’s shoulder and squeeze a bit to attract his attention before they leave the safety of his beloved car and remind him “It’s gonna be fine, Cas. You’re not alone, I’m right here by your side.”
Cas shares the events of his past and Cas and Dean get even closer as a result.
Dean’s arms are startling to tremble from exertion though, and that makes Castiel switch back to Dom mode instantly. He has the most precious sub of them all to take care of.
“Please, don’t misunderstand. I want this. I want
“That’s right, sweetheart,

“That’s,” Cas tries to say and it’s clear he’s finding words difficult right now. He’s probably thinking about shoving Dean on the floor where he stands and ride him until tomorrow.
“Um, he’s the only family I’m in touch with,” Castiel offers in response, making it clear he doesn’t want to go any deeper into the subject. Fair enough. “He says I tend to ramble when discussing the things I’m passionate about. And I, um, am passionate about bees.” Hence, the bee-shaped center pieces.
“My god, you’re adorable.”
Should Castiel come back? Try and see if he could work with Dean to find a way to mend their relationship, mend it for real, rather than giving up like he had done on his last day at the bunker? So that they could go back to being the source of each other’s strength, rather than of each other’s despair?
has Dean pay attention immediately. He pauses his attack on Cas for a moment to look at him and a warm wave washes through him when he sees the lust in his eyes.
But Cas is nothing if not persistent, and he sits back on the bed, next to Dean, so, so close, and damn he smells of Cas and of sex and of
Talking about the seasoning of the meat is as safe a topic of discussion as Dean can come up with, and that leads to Dean telling Jimmy about him learning to cook thanks to his adoptive mum, who’s an incredible cook, being willing to teach him. And that leads Dean to tell Jimmy about him and his brother having been adopted as kids.
He then started traveling down the older man’s chest, until he got to his left nipple, that he kissed and kitten licked a bit, while also thumbing at the right one lightly. This earned him a whine and a soft “Oh, Dean.” Sensitive nipples. Awesome. Dean’s nipples were super sensitive, so he was put out by any kind of non-too-gentle attention to them, and what he had just done with Cas was as much as he was ready to do to someone else. Luckily, that seemed to be more than enough for him. Dean was starting to think the two of them were a match made in sex heaven.
Future Mr. Winchester is a tease, then. ‘Me likey,’ Dean thinks while he replays Castiel’s words in his head and shamelessly ogles him while he’s busy with the other table. Kudos to whoever designed those jeans because oh boi do they put Castiel’s perfectly round ass on display. And those
“You misunderstand, my love,” Castiel replies between one kiss and the next, one nibble and the next, while also starting a regular, slow rhythm with his hips that allows his cock to slide in and out of Dean’s body and enjoy how welcoming, in his heat and smoothness, it is. “I wasn’t suggesting we should have an open relationship.” Gosh, but it’s getting difficult to think and talk while Dean’s ass is so tight and so warm, and his legs are wrapping around Castiel’s hips more securely, as if Dean needs to make sure Castiel stays right where he is but he also needs to lure him even deeper inside of himself, while his hands are buried in Castiel’s hair and he’s releasing little moans as his breathing quickens. “On the contrary. I just wanna make sure you want to be only mine. Like I want you to be. Like I only want to be yours.”

Castiel understands. This is the sort of perfect instant one wishes they could live in forever.
The smile he gets in reply is predatory. “
“I don’t, I swear.” Dean adds his best ‘I don’t have ill intentions please believe me’ smile for good measure, regretting for a moment Sammy isn’t with him, because then they could put his brother’s award-deserving puppy dog eyes to good use for once, instead of only ever having them used against himself to be bullied into “talking and being open with your feelings, Dean.”

Something inside of Dean softens, the wall of fury starting to crack.

He’s probably being mindful of the additional space Dean needs for the guitar, and the simple act warms Dean’s heart. This man is so respectful of others’ needs and boundaries. And he smells
Dean is gorgeous. Castiel absolutely adores the little pudge on his belly he referred to the first time they met, when Dean told him he had decided to start walking to and back from work. Castiel is so grateful it’s still there as he takes the opportunity to kiss it, after having familiarized with Dean’s neck, and shoulders and chest, and having even licked those delicious nipples, and enjoyed every single response this beautiful man has gifted him with.
Smart. A simple, yet important, job that will take probably half a day – leaving the rest of the day for Jack to check the info about the GED, after a little nudge from Castiel, if Dean had to make a bet – but one that won’t have too many negative consequences if the kid makes a mistake with counting. Castiel will probably just order a little more of everything to be on the safe side. That’s what Dean would do.
Finally lifting his gaze, Cas was clearly surprised when he replied, “Dean, hi. Sorry, I didn’t realize it was you.”
“Dean, breathe,” Cas interrupts his rambling, with a fond smile and eyes which are even mistier than a few moments ago.
“You don’t?”
“Relax, Jimmy, please. I mean nothing by it. I just saw it poking out from under your blanket yesterday, and figured that’s where you keep what you have.”
“It is and he is. Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to do some parenting, now, does it?”
“Too soon? That means... I mean, so you, um, think we will, you know, one day?”
“Don’t freak out please, this is still a no expectations arrangement, I promise, and if it makes you more comfortable
Not that he’s
“Wow,” Dean, sweet Dean, comments, blissfully not calling Castiel out on his bout of shyness. “I can’t speak any language other than English. But that must be...
him and
Cas replied with “OK”, without showing any sign of emotion and without so much as looking at him, focused as he was on counting the change to give him. Admittedly, it was not like it was set in stone they had to meet every day and it was not like Dean was half hoping to see Cas pout a little and have him demand something special in retribution for their lost time together, but still.
alpha.
professional – might prove to be harder, but establishing just how involved Dean really was was a first necessary step. Plus, Castiel had meant to have some fun with Dean anyway, possibly serving Dean a healthy dose of his own medicine, so dangling the carrot of the possibility to meet with him like that would allow Castiel to catch the proverbial two birds with one tiny stone.
place for him to spend the next two weeks at and he
“Yes, Sir.”
He starts pulling out, which causes his boy to start whimpering “No, no, no, please, Sir” immediately, which only solidifies Castiel’s impression that Dean needs to be brought back to the present. “Shhh, darling boy, it’s alright, Sir is here,” he tries and calm him, as he helps his boy to stand up after he’s pulled out completely so he can turn Dean around.
“Do I keep going, baby?”
taking full advantage of Dean.
“Dean, look at me.”
With that, his dad pats him on the shoulder and nods his head before telling him to scram and to go make him some money.
So he doesn’t know what it must be like to be attracted to a gender and then find out – when you’re also dealing with that awful moment in life that is adolescence – that you like the other gender as well. Especially not with all the expectations Dean’s reputation put on him – and, Castiel is pretty sure,
“No, I don’t think so.”
is Novak’s voice? That low, gravelly timbre is how his voice sounds? Dean can’t wait to hear the man scream himself hoarse when Dean fucks him, the sound is gonna be divine.
“Yeah? You’re gonna come on my cock alone? Like the good boy you are?”
the kind of man that could make him come with just one finger.
Dean smiles. Another message received loud and clear. Cas is still the one who calls the shots.
“Cas,” Dean replied, turning the one word into a warning.
Dean chuckles and Jimmy huffs a small laugh, the first clear sign of amusement he offers.
Dean just nods a little and turns around to get to work, knowing not to reply unless he’s asked a direct question or given explicit praise.
“I’m sorry Dean, I didn’t mean to. And I, um, like Cas.” Cas smiles shyly and ducks his head to resume his snuggling position against Dean’s chest. Is he...embarrassed? That seemed like a pleased smile though. “No one’s ever called me that. I, um, like the idea that we have something which is only ours.”
As soon as they got home, Dean barely had time to close the front door and take a breath to ask Gorgeous if he wanted anything to drink that the man's tongue was down his throat.
,” and stilling his hips so that his whole length is buried inside of Dean’s ass to the hilt and his hands are gripping his sides so tight that Dean hopes they’ll leave behind bruises in the shape of fingerprints that Dean can have tattooed.
“Jesus, fuck,” Novak swears and Dean loves to hear him so wrecked, knowing he’s in a very similar state.
Cas’s attention never wavers, but he does relax little by little, and by the time Dean’s played
Dean let his own head rest on the couch, closed his eyes and let himself enjoy the peace of the moment, the repetitive movement he was using to caress Cas helping him relax too.
“I want to live and work with you every day, and do what we can to help our community and, then, one day, I want us to retire and move to a little house on the beach, where we can have lazy and boring old men sex and dip our toes in the sand while we sit by the sea.”
But why didn’t those reasons seem to matter now, not as much as going back and finding a healthy way to fix his relationship with the hunter? Maybe the distance had helped? Time healed all things, the saying went. Could it be that? Was that why Dean had been able to offer such an honest, heartfelt and heartwarming apology? He’d had enough time to think? Possibly talk to somebody?
When they enter Chelsea Market, Castiel deliberately slows down his pace, to give Dean a chance to take a look around and himself a chance to look at Dean’s reaction closely. Castiel loves Chelsea Market. It’s a good example of urban redevelopment, which respects the surrounding area and offers opportunity and variety to the neighborhood. As nice as the market is, and as good Castiel finds the food in basically every restaurant here, this is no five star establishment, and Castiel is curious to see what Dean’s reaction will be. Rather than disappointed, however, Dean appears to be delighted. He is smiling a wide smile that is making little happy crinkles appear around his eyes, and is looking around with the same expression a kid in a toy store at Christmas might wear.
I am?”
good though. His adorable boy is a walking masterpiece.
, Cas is gonna do despicable – awesome, hot, smutty, delicious – things to Dean. He loves the act in itself, the unrestrained drive they have to get as close to each other as possible with their bodies and souls. And he loves the aftermath, all of the little physical reminders of how completely he’s loved, and wanted, and cherished, and owned.
wanted anything or anyone so fucking much in my life.”
ass that I’m gonna keep doing it for as long as you’ll have me.”
“It’s simply perfect for us, for our story.”
lucky he’s willing to deal with his bratty ass.
ogling Dean too obviously. It was bad enough before, when he’d had to deal with Dean’s choice of clothing that – in what Castiel believes was an absolutely deliberate move – consisted of a total black and
And when he places his left hand on Cas’s silky hair and sees the glint of their engagement ring, Dean
As he uses his hold on Cas’s hand to stop him right there, in the middle of a sidewalk in New York City, while they are on their way to Central Park, to kiss the man he’s wanted for all his adult life, Dean can’t help but think that right now, this very moment, is the beginning of the life Dean’s always wanted for himself, and he’ll do whatever it takes to earn and keep that life every day he’ll get to live it.
a busy man. Busy and CFO are basically synonyms. But even if he was toying with Dean, Dean’s not gonna give up yet. At best, he’s gonna get to meet him again. At worst, it’s gonna be a hard-learnt lesson. Either way, he’s gonna have an answer.
As he loses himself in the gentle exploration, Castiel finds himself thinking that he’s glad Dean didn’t choose to wear nail polish on his fingers too. His rough, calloused, very much manly hands – the hands of someone attending college to study mechanical engineering and taking as many applicative workshops as he can because tinkering with motors of any shape and form is his passion – a perfect reminder that Dean’s a strong man that could throw Castiel against the wall if he wanted to, but instead chooses to submit to him completely. Nothing else can make Castiel feel so powerful.
“Well, that depends on when we’re both free, I guess? I don’t start work until Thursday, so I’m always free until then. But you mentioned you work at least until 4pm every day. So, we could either do after 5 one of these days before I start working, or I can call again after Thursday, once I know what schedule I’ll have.”
When they’re done with dinner, Castiel insists on helping Dean clean before going back home. Dean switches on his stereo, claiming that he absolutely hates cleaning and he can only bring himself to do it if he can have a reward. Dean talking about a duty-reward dynamic does not send Castiel’s mind to the gutter. Uh uh.
That he asked Cas to face away from him is already a big deviation from what he usually prefers. Dean usually loves to look at Cas’s face. He especially loves to see the expression he gets when Dean breaches him, that one moment of pain/pleasure that quickly morphs into bliss whenever Dean enters him. He loves kissing Cas’s lips the whole time when they fuck too, he’s addicted to those lips and that tongue and he can never get enough.
Moment effectively ruined – and public decency blissfully preserved – their conversation steers back toward breakfast-appropriate topics, with Castiel finally finding the courage to ask the one question that's been bugging him the most.
Castiel’s plan seems to be derailing spectacularly though. He suspects that he’s not the one playing the game, but the one who’s been played.
“You wanna be my boyfriend?”
Pun. Intended.
“Now I know what I have to thank for those thighs,” Dean says, infuriatingly unrepentant.
The rumble of a car brings him back to the present. Castiel knows absolutely nothing about cars, but he’s pretty sure that’s the sound of the very sexy, classic, black car that passes in front of his hotel every day in the morning and late afternoon. The very sexy, classic, black car that is driven by a man Castiel’s had a chance to spot behind the wheel a time or two (hundred), and that, even from a distance, looks just as sexy as the car he drives.
Dean pecks him and smiles brightly. “I will.”
This is not about excitement. This is about reconnecting. About getting close to each other when words fail and reminding each other that nothing else feels like coming home as when they get physically intimate.
There it is, that smile again. Dean thinks he might be ready to do just about anything if that meant putting that gummy smile on Castiel’s face again and again.
knew far too well about the need to leave a place behind in no time. Castiel knew most people would have found his choice of alias morbid. But he honestly didn’t. Castiel was well aware of everything Jimmy Novak had sacrificed for him, of everything Castiel had received in exchange of that sacrifice. Castiel’s gratitude towards Jimmy was endless. He thought of Jimmy constantly. Choosing to go by his name was a means to honor that.
And innocent he was, Castiel found out that very night. When
“Sit up and put your feet on the cushions. Put your hands behind your knees and keep them there. Keep yourself spread open for me.”
He tries to look as demure as he can, knowing it drives Cas
“Please, Cas. Baby. I’ve been on edge for hours and you’re wearing blue”. He’s whining again and he couldn’t care less. He needs to be filled up by his boyfriend’s cock. That damned plug has made a great job of teasing him to the point of insanity.
Castiel couldn’t stop a smile from spreading over his face thinking about the first time he ever felt sexual arousal. He didn’t realize for a long time that it was carnal desire the tingling sensation Castiel had felt when Dean, sarcastically commenting on the intensity of his look, had told him that he had “got laid” the last time someone had looked at him like that. Castiel wanted to be the one who got to lay Dean down and ravish him
“I do, too.”
“I know,” Dean replies with a big smile, leaning down to kiss Cas again. Why had they stopped kissing anyway? Oh well, it’s not important. They can just go back to doing it and never stop.
Cas come more than anything. Last time he was kissing him when he did and he didn’t get to enjoy the show from beginning to end like he wanted. So he pulled off the beautiful dick in his mouth to order “Tell me when you’re about to come, beautiful”, before doubling the effort of the fingers inside of Cas and moving his left hand to his shaft to start stroking him in time with his fingering.
“It sounds delicious,” he finally manages, and they both know Cas’s not thinking about the pie when he says that.
, before he replies, “Yes, yes we do.”
“Very green, Sir,” Dean says in response, a grin on his face which is just a bit too much on this side of cheeky for Castiel’s liking. His sub is getting cocky tonight. They will have to play again soon, so Castiel can make sure Dean realizes his birthday is
He decides to make a detour to the restrooms last minute. Having checked the time, he knows he’ll be caught in the rush hour traffic and who knows how long he’ll be stuck in it. Better to relieve himself now, just in case. Some cold water on his face sounds like a great idea too.
Thank you guys for all the love and support, you're amazing and I feel so lucky and spoiled <3
“That I am, love. That I am.”
A few weeks after the reunion, Cas and Dean decided that the upcoming holidays would be the perfect opportunity to dive into the ‘meet the family’ scenario.
“Cas-“
Cas starts tucking himself back in and then, cool as a cucumber, says, “Grab your jacket, baby. We’re going out to say goodbye to the party boy. We’ll tell him we had to rush to the restroom because you were feeling sick and that we think your cold might be coming back, so it’s better if we go home.”
“I want,” Dean replies with what he
Cas groans as his hand tightens the hold around his cock and starts stroking faster, chasing his own orgasm just like his mental self is chasing his inside the heat of Dean’s tight channel.
Cas and Dean have dinner together for the first time.
That’s good, because his throat is already marked and Castiel doesn’t think the bruise will fade before a couple of days. Whoops.
The first step must be a shower. Dean usually has a coffee at the very least before doing anything else in the morning, but he feels the need to wash himself clean. He feels dirty and...spoilt. A shower will help, he’s sure.
his impossible requests.
“Unca Baty!”
genuine.
They are all part of the community. This is personal for all of them. The kid might be the one who got the actual beating, but every one of those bruises is a bruise on the soul of each queer person who’s ever been sidelined, bullied or attacked simply for being who they are.
“Yes?” Dean says, while he keeps kissing whatever piece of Cas he can.
hurting you unless it gives you pleasure. Plus, in the time it would take me to fuck you like my good boy deserves, you’d probably get overstimulated. And this was about you anyway, about helping you release some stress, which you have.”
Now, though, now he’s not gonna let that stop him. Cas could have died last night. Because he doesn’t have a home. And he doesn’t have a home because he can’t pay for one. Because he lost everything he had, because he’s been incredibly unlucky, and has been surrounded by monsters rather than humans all his life.
Even though the business card he was given seems legit enough, Dean not so lowkey suspects Cas might have given him the wrong contact information, so it’s with bated breath, crossed fingers and a prayer on his lips that he dials the number.
Once the second sock is out of the picture, he places Dean’s foot on his left knee and grabs the oil. Dean’s pleased sigh in response is the best reward. He drizzles some on his palms, rubs them together to warm it up and gets to work on Dean’s left foot. He spreads the oil around before starting to thumb at the ball of Dean’s foot with enough pressure to knead the sore muscles and help release their tension. A groan and an almost whispered “Fuck, baby, so good” is what that earns him. He keeps himself focused on what he’s doing, trying to give Dean the relaxing and sensual foot rub he’s imagined and not get carried away before the time for him to take the cock he’s earning comes. Which means he makes sure not to ever lift his eyes. If he sees the look of pure ecstasy he knows he’ll find on Dean’s face, while he’s still wearing the damn emerald henley to boot, he’s gonna climb his boyfriend like a squirrel would a tree.
“Yeah?” He can’t help the pleased, coy smile. He’s not even doing it on purpose. Cas makes him coy, for fuck sake’s. He’s so head over heels for this man it’s almost a joke, really.
The eye roll Castiel gets in response reassures him that Dean has indeed taken his remark as the half-joke that it was meant to be.
The answer is given before he even asks though. A throat being cleared alerts Dean that he's no longer alone and when he lifts his head what he sees is beyond endearing. Cas is standing, shy and awkward in his own living room, his eyes wide and vibrant, his face still flushed – and Dean would lie if he said that knowing he's the one who put that lovely shade of red on Cas's cheeks doesn't make his cock stir in a valiant attempt to rejoin the party, in spite of it still being trapped in the mess of drying come inside of his pants – holding something in his hands, which he seems to be using as a shield. A change of clothes. Which can only be intended for Dean, since Cas has already changed into a pair of sweats and a t-shirt.
“Yes,” peck, “I,” peck, “am.”
“Ready,” he says.
He doesn’t know that he will. Dean had been to the club maybe five or six times before last time, when he met Cas, and had never seen him. He knows he didn’t because, just like last time, he wouldn’t have been able to ignore him, gorgeous as he is, and he
“How about you make a week’s change to the menu, reducing it to the items you are sure you’ll be able to provide and offer a discount for students? You can call it something like ‘The take it easy week’ and use that time to find a different, more reliable supplier. Two days wouldn’t be enough, but seven might be, no?”
Dean’s heart feels so full hearing those words leave Cas’s mouth, the ‘right’, ‘right’, ‘right’ feeling an explosion of fireworks behind his ribcage. Cas trust him
“No problem.....?”
The kid’s confused frown smooths into a combination of brilliant smile and excited eyes when he replies “Dean? What are you doing here?”
be interesting and innovative, but, once it became a must-go, it stopped being a pioneering event and became an opportunity for established people and companies to peacock around the place. Powerful businesspeople shaking other powerful businesspeople’s hands to reassure each other just how powerful they are with each handshake. If you are somebody – anybody – in the field of renewable energy and neighboring areas, you make sure to be here, plain and simple.
Cas’s eyes start filling again. “I don’t,” the poor man needs to clear his throat twice before speaking, and he’s still choked up when he says “I don’t have to sleep on the street tomorrow?”
“Yes, we are.”
He’s barely put the car in park that he’s already throwing the door open and slamming it shut behind him. He storms inside their house without even turning around to make sure Cas is following. He
“Yeah? Then I want you to knot me good, My Heart,” his Dom replies with fire in his beautiful eyes. “Are you gonna be a good alpha? Lock us together?”
“Shut up Cas. I don’t wanna hear a word coming out of your mouth right now,” he interrupts, still too angry about the whole thing to be able to be a goddamn adult about it.
Dean didn’t get a chance to toss more than a “See you tomorrow” at his perfect boy before leaving, as he’d been admittedly busy the whole time, as per usual after lunch. He resolved to text Cas and let him know that he wouldn’t be able to make it that night and got a
Did Dean want Castiel to know that he was sorry and that he was forgiven so that, even though they would never meet again, Castiel might live the rest of his life with a clearer conscience?
Novak’s eyes on him and it gets him even more motivated to show him how powerful and in control he can be. He cherishes the little, pleased smiles he always spots on the reporter’s face when he’s going back to his chair after a successful questioning. It makes him think about how Novak might want to reward him for a job well done, or how he might be getting hard – right there, in the courtroom, hidden by this small desk – thinking about Dean ruling over him in bed like he rules over witnesses at the stand.
“Is everything alright, Jack?” a deep voice that goes straight to Dean’s cock says and Dean turns toward the direction the sexy voice came from to find the most beautiful man he’s ever seen squinting at him as if he could smite Dean with the force of his look. Dean’s first conscious thought is ‘If Jack has a father, why is he living in the street?’, because damn if this guy here isn’t the spitting image of the kid, and the second is ‘Can you please be into guys and, more specifically, into me?’
Dean had started googling places to go and see even before leaving Kansas City – he needed to get to know his new city after all – and
And he starts whispering in Dean’s ear. “Then I’m gonna fuck you like you’ve been begging me for, and I’m gonna come in your ass. And you’re gonna lie there and take it, because that’s what I want my beautiful whore to do."
“But you’re going to be good and wait for me to give you permission to come, aren’t you, Little Alpha?”
“Yep. But you’re marrying me anyway.”
“Yes,” he confirms, and hums happily against Dean’s heart.
Castiel decides there and then that’s he’s just gonna file away the sexual frustration he’s about to feel so he can retrieve it when he’ll finally get to fuck that ass, so he can be certain he’ll fuck it as long and as deep as it’s begging to be fucked right now.
So he looks at Cas with suggestive eyes and says “I wish, Gabe. I have offered, in fact. Cas here ain’t interested.”
“I’m sorry, we’re closed.”
This shower feels like a reward for dealing with the previous day’s trials and surviving, so taking a few extra minutes to get himself not only clean but also properly relaxed doesn’t sound like such a crime to Dean.
“That fucker of your boss was onto you because he’s a narrow minded, ignorant prick, and he would have found some shitty excuse sooner or later anyway. And the people in your life who didn’t take the time to really get to know you and appreciate you for who you are, and dropped the ball when you turned out to be different from the image they had of you, weren’t people you could have built any healthy, meaningful relationship with. Those who want you to be like
They had been together for three months at that point, but it was clear to the both of them that theirs wasn’t just a fling. They both wanted it to be it, and were conscious that getting along with your partner’s family was a big part of successful long-term relationships – unless your partner was the first not to want anything to do with their folks, which wasn’t the case for the two them.
“Yeah,” Dean finally manages to choke out, and someone should really give him a medal for remembering what words are
He even went as far as getting a coffee from the cart in his department courtyard. Which tasted like crap and wouldn’t probably pass a sanitary inspection but, hey, it did contain caffeine. Any port in a storm and all that.
“So, no, I have no sad story. I was just a spoiled brat who had everything he wanted and had won the genetic pool, and enjoyed far too much how easy and cool it was to be king. I’ve learned growing up that it is only cool to be king when you actually deserve it. That’s when people really look up to you, respect you, help you, support you. I’ve learned honesty and kindness are the keys in the world of adults, if you wanna have meaningful relationships rather than an uninterrupted string of fake friends.”
“You know what? Probably. I’d probably have. But I did see you, and I can’t unsee you now. So, how about that dinner?”
seeing Anna kiss Dean, so much so that he had to drop his gaze. He was so confused back then, and couldn’t understand why that was. Anna had been right when she said Castiel didn’t know what feelings were. He didn’t back then. Even though he had started to feel them, he didn’t know what they were, how to recognize them, or control them. He hadn’t known then, and didn’t realize for a long time, that the reason why he couldn’t stand watching her kiss the righteous man was not understandable indignation for a sinful act between an angel and a human, but
that I like the idea of helping others do it with a relaxing atmosphere, some good food and a healthy dose of strong coffee.”
While Cas is walking to the en-suite, not doubt to get rid of the condom, Dean is left there, to think about how much he already misses being filled by Cas and how much he’s loved the simple kiss. A kiss that wasn’t meant to lead anywhere. I kiss that said ‘I’m not doing this because I have to, I’m doing it because I like you, because I have been inside of you, and you let me, and I enjoyed it.’
He must sound and look as furious as he feels, because the kid appears just about ready to shit himself. Dean can’t say he’s not feeling a perverse satisfaction at seeing Samandriel taken down 25 notches,
His timid smile does Castiel in. Dean’s making himself completely vulnerable. Castiel thought he knew what it meant to be vulnerable and exposed to someone who can crash you, that day in the locker room. But Dean is showing  him that you can be far more vulnerable and exposed than he had been that day.
Dean’s still reeling – furious, hurt, confused, uncertain. He doesn’t even know what the fuck he’s feeling right now, couldn’t say which emotion is stronger if they paid him. He can’t keep talking, he needs to
He takes a deep breath and tries again. “Look, Dad. I know you’re worried about me. And so is Mom, and the rest of your children. I know. You only want to protect me. That’s what you and Mom only ever wanted. But I promise you, Cas is a good man, and he’s good for me.”
He comes less than a minute later, screaming “Fuck,
It was time to go back and see whether their relationship really was as irreparably broken as it had seemed that awful day. The day they lost Rowena and, Castiel had thought until ten minutes ago, Castiel had lost Dean forever.
“Kneel down on it, boy,” Castiel orders, his tone a touch colder than he had originally planned. He’s being lenient tonight, but it wouldn’t do to forget himself completely. He’s supposed to not only set rules and boundaries for his boy, but to also be the first to adhere to them.
what to do. So.”
Normally Dean revels in the attention, but he wouldn’t be able to wait that long today. Luckily his boyfriend seems to always know intuitively what Dean can and can’t take.
His hand goes for Dean’s briefs again and this time he lifts his hips a bit to help Castiel take them off, while at the same time bringing his own hands to Castiel’s boxers to start pulling them down. Castiel helps him after he’s got rid of Dean’s and then they are both naked. Finally.
Dean strips in record time and gets on all four on the bed. Cas is behind him in a flash. ‘
His Dom is beautiful like this. Unapologetically chasing his own pleasure, using Dean as a toy to satisfy his need to be filled, like he had used his mouth to stimulate his cock earlier, and Dean revels in the knowledge that there is no one else in the world that can give Cas what Dean can. Because Dean belongs to Cas, but Cas belongs to Dean just as much and the idea of being with anyone else is now simply revolting for both of them. So when Cas’s hands move from Dean’s chest to his knees, forcing Dean’s hands to leave Cas’s hips and start caressing the front of his Dom’s tights, and Cas throws his head back and starts moving his hips back and forth in earnest until he shoots his load all over himself and Dean can feel a gush of slick flood his cock and balls, Dean feels as happy and sated as he could ever be, even though he hasn’t come yet and he doesn’t even know whether his Dom will let him come. He, Dean Winchester, did
Dean’s horrified expression must speak volumes, because the man seems to relax a fraction, and Dean takes the opportunity to try again.
If he could, Dean would make every single person who’s ever done anything, big or small, to make Cas believe he’s not worthy of love and adoration line up, and then punch every single one of them in the face. Hard.
?” he’d commented intelligently after the man had introduced himself, “Wow, that’s a mouthful.”
“I, um, got busy with laundry and dinner, so I haven’t had the time to set the table. Can I ask you to help me with that while I finish here?”
He starts puttering around their living room, moving items – a centerpiece, a cloth, a book Castiel ‘forgot’ on top of it this morning before leaving for work – from the table to other pieces of furniture.
Sammy even commented once that everyone using Dean’s bathroom would think there were two people living in Dean’s house. A weird, little shiver had run through Dean’s body when he heard the words “looks like someone else lives here”. If Dean had to be honest with himself (‘which is a
“Indeed.”
“Yes, sir.” His perfect sub replies with a soft smile.
The whole wall to Dean’s right is faced by a long, rectangular table that seems to host every kind of food under the sun. Fruit, vegetables, bread and dripping, jams, butter and honey, cereals, cold milk of
“My-, my name. It’s not Jimmy. It’s Castiel.”
The kiss is as possessive as they go. Cas’s left hand still on his waist to keep him close, his right hand on the side of Dean’s neck to help him keep his neck craned, while Cas’s teeth nib at Dean’s bottom lip. A clear request: open up to me, my love, let me get to what’s mine. And so Dean does. There’s no world in which Dean would deny Cas entrance. Cas’s tongue is thorough and insistent as it slides inside of Dean’s mouth, mapping it, cherishing it, owning it. Even through his own closed eyes Dean knows Cas’s are open. They often are. “I still can’t believe I get to kiss you whenever I want, my love. I need to see it,” Cas always says, making Dean’s heart skip a beat, or twelve, every time.
And it would give him one more week with his new friends, and some time to get used to the idea of having to say goodbye. He had already had to leave his friends, his family, without a chance to say goodbye and any time to prepare himself for it, when he had left the bunker. He’d rather not have to do the same thing again in this case.
Yes, he
“Oh Cas. You should have come here right away.”
Cas held his gaze but didn’t say a word.
in his boyfriend’s eyes and then his face is smashed against the pillow, he’s on his front on the mattress and Cas is on top of him, thrusting hard and fast and
– Castiel will certainly be wearing his work clothes, because he won’t have the time to go change, unless he leaves the office early – which again, he won’t do, because that would also means he cares.
“Yes, god. Oh god, yes.”
“Ehm, thanks, Cas. Do you think we could also have a second fork though?”
“Do we need to worry about your relationship being anything but healthy and safe?”
Cas doesn’t say anything.
“Good boy. I love you so much, Little Alpha. You’re always so perfect for me.”
“She was clearly a very wise woman.”
“Yes, yes,” Dean doesn’t even know what he’s agreeing to and he
I'll now leave you to these two dealing with the aftermath of what's happened in chapter 1. Who knows whether a certain one-night-stand rule will be upheld...
“That you’d fuck me. But you, uhm, didn’t grab the condoms. And you’re kneeling.”
“Because you’re nothing if not gorgeous, sweetheart” Dean mocks Cas out loud again, because that always gives him a moment of relief, as petty as that is, and because it’s easier to be angry at those words than admitting that he melts a little inside every time they get replayed in his head.
Cas, obviously, cannot resist. He tries. He really does. But to no avail.
“My fingers?”
’ Gabe’s mind voice had replied, proud and appreciative.
“We still miss the fifth kink in your top five.”
And with an experience like that, Castiel can still be so kind with others?
about it again, soon,” Castiel adds, stressing the word ‘talk’ enough that Dean cannot fail to understand that means he’s getting the spanking he earned himself for this little stunt. “But I cannot risk leaving it on you tonight, baby boy. You’re already incredibly tempting as it is,” he concludes, hoping that both the sincere praise and the promise of a thorough spanking in the near future – more a reward than a punishment for his sometimes bratty sub – will help his birthday boy not to feel too disappointed that his sneaky plan failed so miserably.
It’s really not surprising then that Castiel has tried to reason, then plead, then bribe his way out of this shindig. But, in his position, he simply wasn’t allowed to escape this torture.
Dean stands up carefully, mindful of the lack of stability that wearing heels that high entails, and Castiel revels in seeing his pretty cock poking out of the hem of his panties because Dean got fully hard just by sucking him off.
He stayed silent for a few moments to let that sink in, never stopping his roaming hands.
“So is dinner, it seems. Can you grab the green peas and the potatoes and I’ll take the chicken?”
He’s not wrong. He’s been so good. He deserves to be taken care of and cherished as the precious gift he is. And that’s his Dom’s duty, and privilege.
Jesus Christ, this man. How did Castiel’s nemesis turn into his perfect partner?
When the taste of his boyfriend’s come and of leather mix on his tongue Dean feels like life will never get better than this, until Cas orders “Don’t swallow, keep it on your tongue.”
Cas doesn’t say a word, just grabs him by the wrist and drags him to the restrooms, Dean offering no resistance whatsoever.
Castiel hates it when his brain is right and his heart wrong.
Castiel’s chuckling again. “My god, you’re adorable.”
Jimmy’s suddenly on high alert, a betrayed look on his face. “Dean, you said-“
They’re in his bedroom, and they’ve just finished fucking. As usual by now, Cas has helped himself to Dean’s en-suite to clean himself up and come back with a damp cloth for Dean. Unlike their first night together though, Dean’s started to drag Cas back to bed for some post-sex making out after he’s washed his come away from his chest or from wherever it’s landed. He knows he’s getting clingy and clingy, but he just doesn’t care one bit how desperate that makes him look, because he just wants Cas that much and can’t, won’t, miss out on even a second of their time together. This time it’s even worse, his need for Cas. For one reason or another, it‘s been two weeks since the last time they were together and Dean’s missed Cas so much, missed being with him, touching him, kissing him, smelling him, feeling him inside and been touched and kissed and smelled and filled by him, that the relief of finally being together again is almost too much.
“That’s for sure.”
Castiel had actually been so proud of having made the connection that when he turned, smiling, to Maggie, he wasn’t expecting the fond look in her eyes. She was usually proud of him in similar circumstances. “I’m gonna miss you so much, Cas. Promise you won’t be a stranger?”
“I’m pretty great. Those memory foam mattresses you have here and the showers... Dude.
When he’s managed to grab the paper, Dean instructs “Keep it on our heads with your left hand and bring your right back where it was, you gotta help us come.”
, Cassie. I see why you’re still so taken with him, you haven’t grown bored of fucking him yet. You’ll be soon, and then you’ll see there is nothing left to enjoy.” Cas had tried to reason with him, but there was just no way he would listen. Not even after the holidays and the meetings with both of their families did he consider their relationship “serious enough to waste even ten minutes of my precious time to exchange pleasantries with someone you’ll give the boot to soon enough.”
Rimming was clearly a very enthusiastic ‘Yes’ in Cas’s book and Dean silently congratulated himself on a job well done. One more test would have to be added to Dean’s ever-growing list: it was paramount to ascertain whether Cas could come from rimming alone.
The truth is, Dean wants to stay in, and ask Cas in private.
Cas is studying him. He seems intrigued, hopeful, wary, pissed and still at least partially ready to bolt all at once.
Time to stop dancing around each other.

“Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I had to tell him. I’m sorry, I know it wasn’t my story to tell, but I can’t lie to my old man. And, I mean, since he’s hiring you, he kinda has a right to know about your work experience and why you can’t give him any references, so.”

it. I need you, always.”
“Yeah? Like that? Me begging you to fuck my ass?”
‘His life?’ Castiel thinks, ‘Probably not. But his ass? If he really turns out to be this decent a human being?
“I liked it too, my stunning boy, very much so,” he says as his hips go back to thrust in and out of Dean’s tight ass, which makes his boy gasp and moan in reaction. “There’s no place more beautiful in the whole world than inside of you, my precious boy.”

outfit showing off the incredibly tempting body that was underneath. But now Dean’s put on the green sweater he’s brought along in case the air got chillier, which it did, and Castiel is being blinded by how much that damn sweater brings out his green eyes. As if he wasn’t already obsessed with Dean’s face as it is.
for a good for nothing
If Dad just pissed on Dean, he would save everyone’s time at this point. Cas cannot have missed that Dean is “his boy” and “his son” as well as the not so implicit “you hurt him, I will dismantle you like I dismantle the cars in here.”

The same applied to Cas riding him. He only came untouched if they were sitting and Cas’s dick was trapped against Dean’s belly, or if they were lying chest to chest with Cas on top. Those were lowkey some of Dean’s favorite moments because Cas liked to keep their fingers interlocked and never stopped kissing Dean while he worked his hips like a maniac to get his pleasure before Dean came inside the condom.
Yet, here both are. Dean, against any sane person’s better judgment, trusting Jimmy not to make him regret his offer. Jimmy, also against any sane person’s better judgment, trusting Dean not to make him regret accepting it.

He really, really wants to fuck him – hell, he'd even bottom for him, even though he generally prefers to top – but he also wants to go to the movies, and to concerts, and to grab a burger and a beer with him. He wants to tell him about himself. In fact, he wants to tell him
Castiel then covers him with their softest blanket and moves to his legs to untie the shoe laces, before taking them off. He drizzles some lotion on his palms, warms it up and starts giving Dean a foot rub, making sure the rest of him is covered and warm.
“Castiel. Gabriel’s the only one who insists on calling me Cassie. You can call me Cas, Dean.”
Oh. OK. Dean hasn’t noticed that. Possibly because he hasn’t even touched the bracelet yet. He takes it out of the box and inspects it more closely and sure enough some words are engraved in the leather.
“Now take me in your mouth, beautiful, slowly,” he instructs, knowing he cannot pass up the opportunity of feeling the heat and wetness of his boy’s mouth surrounding his erection.
A handful of seconds later, Dean hears the front door click shut. The silence in Dean’s apartment – and in his life – has never been so deafening.
He knew. He totally
Cas tensed a bit but didn’t reply.
God but Dean has come to love that question.
and when Cas’s mouth laches on Dean’s pulse on his neck and sucks a bruise into it, Dean’s back arches off the couch and he cries out as he comes harder than he has in a long, long time.
Dean’s pretty sure he’s gonna have a hell of a hard time saying no to Cas or staying mad at him for too long. Oh well, there are bigger and worse problems in life than that.
“Your brother and I were positive you’d approve. And would want to listen with the kids rather than reading with the adults.”
“Well, that’s not the Dean Winchester I know.”
actively trying to never do – had only served one purpose. Reminding him that, in spite of all the immeasurable pain, despair, evil, even death, that had threatened to separate them, they were still in each other’s life. They still loved each other.
(See the end of the chapter for

Mind made up, he goes through the motions of getting ready for the day and going to work.
Very, very far. “I’m glad you think so,” he replies, still as subservient as he’ll ever be. He can’t see it, stubbornly focused as he is on Dean’s feet, but he can very well image the ‘What kind of game is my boyfriend playing?’ look on Dean’s face right now. His lips pressed in a thin line, before he releases them in a pucker, his knitted brow. His vain attempt to be rational and in control enough to analyze the situation objectively. That won’t last. It never does when Cas gets his hands on Dean, or Dean on Cas. The thought makes Cas almost dizzy. They give so much, mean so much, to each other. It scares him and makes him feel blessed at the same time. And Cas wants it to be like that always. Always.
There, with all the people that mattered to them watching, Dean felt his heart stop for a moment when he heard the first notes of
. But he needs to prep Dean thoroughly. Castiel knows that his girth requires it and he will not start their relationship by hurting Dean. Not emotionally, and not physically.
“Fuck.”
He is a great fan of shower sex, which is why he made sure to have a very large shower box installed when he bought this apartment, and why he chose the padded mat carefully. He’s had more than one man on their knees on this mat, and none of them had any complaints about the unforgiving hard floor. Castiel loves to begin his days with a good morning blowjob in the shower when he is in a relationship, he can’t be faulted for being a man who knows what he wants.
“I thought about this, you playing with the plug, Sir.”
He pecks his man’s lips first of all, because he can and it’s been too long and he wants to confirm that, yes, that reply
Castiel stops what he’s doing immediately and gives Dean his undivided attention. “Anything, Dean.”
Getting everything ready for their anniversary dinner is
And he can’t help but think how thankful he is for second chances.
As he’s about to remove them, however, Dean stops him with a hand on his wrist. “Cas, I need-“
Cas’s warm breath against his ear is what stops Dean’s spiraling thoughts, and he realizes Cas is lying on top of him now.
“Can we, um, do you mind if we take a walk? I’d really love to see more of the park. And I love walking.”
And just like that Dean is beyond hot and bothered and wishes it was 9 pm already and the errands had been run and the kids fed, bathed and put to bed, because he really, really, really wants to be rewarded.
“Come on, Dean, you can fuck me now, no need for lube, I’m so sloppy already.”
Now, Dean wouldn’t be opposed to skip dinner and go straight for the sexy times if the circumstances were different. But he has a plan to see through, and he’s not gonna let his traitorous dick, which is already half hard, lead him astray.
Castiel’s blossomed into a hot, smart, and powerful man. Dean kinda knew that already, and he knew he hadn’t idolized that part. He’s seen pictures of Cas at conferences or fundraisers, and he knew he had aged into an extremely handsome and elegant man. He also knows you don’t get as high as Castiel’s got, especially not when you are that young, without a big brain and an ability to handle power with care and bring that power along wherever you go. Powerful people know they are powerful, and know how to exercise that power on others. Dean knows that first hand, considering how much he abused the power his social status gave him in high school.
The slightly longer silence before she replies “One moment, please” only confirms Dean’s suspicion that she’s, at the very least, a little baffled.
when he goes all doe-eyed while his mouth is full of dick and sees the moment when the last bit of his fantasy becomes a reality.
When the door closes behind the last juror, Dean sits down to refocus and take a breath. People around him are milling about but he barely even notices. He’s trying to calm down even though he’d just like to grab a chair and high five the bully in the face with it. The
Dean pays for their breakfast and they start walking toward the General Motors building. It’s a few minutes’ walk and they’re both silent on the way, possibly thinking about how they never said they would meet again after today.
“Why?”
“Yeah.”
They do that a lot.
Castiel feels a surge of heat flare up through his entire body. This man has been his, has
Then Cas seems to register something else and his eyes darken a bit.
After grabbing the other pillow to place below Dean’s hips so he’s propped up a bit, Castiel grabs the condom and rolls it down with shaking fingers. He doesn’t even need to stroke himself he’s so hard. He pours more lube on his erection and spreads it around carefully. Hurting Dean is not conceivable.
Cas was so focused on whatever he was looking at on the counter that he didn’t even lift his head to check the door. It seemed like he hadn’t heard the door bell at all.
name – seemed like he couldn’t care less. His eyes remained fixed on Dean’s face and he didn’t seem to feel any urge to turn around and apologize to their onlookers.
“It wasn’t a sob story,
That seemed to be enough of a reasonable explanation, because Jimmy’s shoulders visibly went down, allowing Dean to keep talking.
“Color?” He repeats.
“It’s not a super interesting job, Cas, and it won’t make you rich. But it’s something, and it’s yours, if you want it.”
A hand yanking his head back by his hair and a simple command to “Open and always keep your eyes on me” was all the indication Dean had that their scene had started, before his Dom’s cock was thrust, none too gently, into his mouth. Dean had already been floating by then, the very act of kneeling on his blue pillow (“I can’t stand the idea of you hurting, unless it’s pain I’m deliberately inflicting, My Heart, so we’ll always use this to protect your knees”) more than enough for him to let the rest of the world disappear in the recess of his mind and start living in a place and time where only his perfect Dom and Dean himself exist.
Definitely much more than Jimmy can say.
Yep, definitely the most satisfying combination of words in the English language.
“She was in trouble, Dean. It was late, and dark. I have seen what happens to people out there when they are in trouble and alone.”

,” Dean says as he starts jerking Cas off himself, “this cock belongs to
Dean told him in no uncertain terms. They have the kind of open, honest communication all their friends envy them. They tell each other everything, good and bad. They’re best friends first and foremost, and that is the strongest foundation of their relationship. When Dean is mad enough with his boyfriend he’d like to start throwing stuff at him, he always finds a way to clear matters with his best friend. And then has his boyfriend make it up to him. The same goes for Cas. Dean is a shitty boyfriend sometimes, but he’s an excellent best friend, and Cas always finds a way to hold onto that when he’d rather throttle his boyfriend.
Castiel downs his drink, stands up and buttons his suit jacket. Then he takes out his wallet and Dean prepares for what is about to happen. Castiel throwing a fifty on the table, definitely too much for their drinks but enough to make the point that he’s so higher than Dean on the social ladder Dean can’t even see him from down there, and leave, probably without a word. Dean supposes that being treated like a cheap whore and left behind in a random bar is no more and no less than what he deserves.
“And, you know, they’re right,” he adds with what he hopes it’s a reassuring smile that will keep at bay any worry Castiel might have that he’s a total creep.
“We’re exclusive.”
He nods. When you don’t have words, you can always use what you still have. Like your face, even though you know the love-sick expression you’re showing is making you look like a goddamn moron.
“Like I said, admirable,” Castiel repeats, with a tone meant to make Dean realize he won’t let him wave off his good heart and generosity a second time.
for me. Let me hear what a whore you are for my tongue.”
Dean offers his right one, the one which is always on display when he plays.
“Yeah, for almost a year now,” he adds, smiling brightly at his boyfriend, whose answering smile is just as bright. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Fuck.”
Dean can only nod his head dumbly, tightening the hold his hands have on Castiel’s arm and hip. He can’t think of much else beside the huge dick as far up his ass as it can possibly go.
Time to get back on track.
“Go wait in the car, Cas,” Dean orders after breaking the kiss.
Dean Winchester isn’t a gold digger, clearly. He’s also so busy taking in the whole place that he doesn’t notice how the waitress visibly checks him out when they enter and approaches them with obvious intent.
Dean’s absolutely adored Times Square and has dropped more than one hint that he’d really like to go see a musical with Castiel at one of the theaters nearby. Castiel hasn’t committed to anything, but he must confess he’s intrigued. He’s never seen a musical, in spite of loving going to the theater and knowing that the productions in Broadway are superb. He’s afraid of doing something new with Dean for the first time though. Castiel has a weird tendency to remember every single detail of the first time he does something new for the rest of his life. Linking something that permanently to Dean doesn’t seem like the best of ideas right now. Not yet, anyway.
, so he can go downstairs and check his car and, in the unlikely event Cas might actually be right, go to the hotel where he’s left Cas earlier and bring him his precious papers. If it turns out he was right, as he expects, he’ll be a good, understanding boyfriend and won’t rub it in, but he also won’t be lying when he tells Cas that he checked and no papers were left in his pride and joy. Lying to Cas is a line Dean doesn’t really want to cross, like
fucked. And not in the best of ways.
“I know, Son. You’re right. We need to find someone to hire. And soon.”
Dean has to physically restrain himself from tightening his hold around him. He wishes he could keep Cas like this, safe in his arms, always. But he has to think about what Cas needs the most right now, so he reluctantly forces himself to say, “A hot shower can only do you good though. Go on, leave your clothes and anything you want washed out the door and I’ll take care of it.”
He then started making his way down his boy’s neck until he got to his right shoulder. He kissed his way back to Cas’s neck and bit him there for the first time. Not too hard, not enough to leave a bruise, this time. But hard enough to see what reaction that’d get him.
“Don’t try and flatter me, Dean Winchester.”
Dean knows because he checked how long would it take Cas to go from his office to their meeting point with public transportation – which is a guess because Cas might as well have his own car or get a taxi, but if Cas is anything like Dean, he would go for the most eco-friendly, or less eco-monstrous, solution, which is public transport. That’s what everyone should do, really, but especially someone working in their field. Dean is actually curious about this particular aspect. As much as he dreams of being with Cas, he also knows that 15 years is a long time and people change a lot in that long. Dean himself is proof of that. And if his bigger fear is that Cas won’t like him, his second biggest fear is that
Dean’s eyes snap open and he mumbles something that sounds like “No, no, Sir”, even though the fingers in his mouth are not making it easy for him to talk, “pleas-”
