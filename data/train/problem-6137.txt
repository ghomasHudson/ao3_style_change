“Did you know about him before we even got here?” Her face turns a little toward beet red, like she might thunk him in the head any minute for putting her through all of the stress of finding an appropriate omega on time.
After he placed the comm in his ear, Steve went to the surface. Clint and Natasha rode the elevator with him. Clint didn’t have his bow and Natasha looked a little more than pissed that she was disarmed. He addressed it. “This is Tony. I don’t want an altercation.”
“Not holographic. This is nanographic. In other words, thousands of tiny nanobots spread out from the main disc and form a lighted graphic display that is the equivalent of the shield. Touch it.”
Through the long dark confined tunnels, Tony carries his burden. At times, he has to ask Steve to walk, but he tries his best to keep that to a minimum. Once free of the cave’s tunnel system, he walks out into the light. The sun paints the land in colors of gold and crimson. The sky’s azure color faded to the palest blue. As he prepares to lift off, he glances down at his cargo, and notices that Steve looks peaceful for the first time. His eyes are closed and his head notched close to where Tony’s heart would be.
“Sir, sir, we’re right here. We’re here.”
“Sorry,” he says and he goes to the door. He needs to get back to Bucky, who is ill as well, and alone.
“Only if you want to?” Steve opens the oven and brings out the three loaves of bread he’s made. He doesn’t look at Tony again. He busies himself with the dinner preparations. “I just thought with the storm still raging, it might be nice to have to feel of the fire close.”
Tony’s faked being sighted, but not blind. He reaches out and lets Steve grasp his hand to lead him to the bike. He knows he shouldn’t be cheating, especially since the implant upgrade isn’t finished, nor has it been properly tested. He won’t deny himself this small treat. Going driving with Steve at the helm, seeing the island one last time, Tony going to do this if it’s the last thing he ever does as a sighted person.
Fury took charge and, for once, Steve was happy he didn’t have to order the team and figure out what their next move might be. “Okay, show’s over. We’d like you and Doctor Banner in the infirmary immediately for confirmation tests.”
“Probably haven’t inhaled a lung full of bleach either,” Tony says and his hand cups Steve’s jaw. “But you’re okay?”
“His blood? What?” His words rasp and fight to get out his throat.
Tony peered over his shoulder at her. “What does it mean for all of the coven safe houses. It means we’re exposed. Very exposed. It means-.”
“No, you’re not.”
“I’m sorry. I never expected him to do that.” Tony follows Steve as he goes back to the closet to gather his clothes, not the uniforms. “I had to tell him the truth, he thought you were some kind of spy. He saw you talking to King Odin.”
That warms Steve’s expression and brings color back to his cheeks. “That sounds like a plan.”
“I thought you said there hasn’t been punishment in years,” Pepper said as they went to the wide double doors of the building.
Once he walks through the doors of his mansion, Tony figured that the burden would lift, and he would feel a sense of calmness and serenity. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Instead, he has a Steve Rogers to deal with and a fake marriage to somehow get falsified so that he can ensure SHIELD or anyone else cannot whisk away said husband.
He doesn't know how to answer but he quickly agrees. She waves at him. "Take it then." Hesitating only a second, Tony reaches out to take the laptop and Aunt Peggy grasps his hand with surprising strength. Her words are cryptic and startling. “He deserved so much more.”
“Special bonds?” Tony asks as the waves crash and lull around them.
“Sorry. You got the dreams, too?” Steve said as he finished pouring the coffee and then set the milk carton on the table with the sugar bowl.
Steve gazes at him for a moment, before he turns on his heel and heads back to the living space of the cabin. He’ll have to be quick about it. Who knows what crazy stuff Tony will try without him there? Regardless of sight, Tony is a maniac in the lab. He loves to try new things, and nothing intimidates him. The more dangerous the better.
But he has to crack the glass bubble. “We still don’t know if it will solve the migraine problem.”
Steve squeezes Tony’s hand. “We’re a team. It’s us. You were right the first time. We need to be more open about what’s coming down the pike, our fears. When we get back, we’ll have a brainstorming session to see what the senior team thinks. What we should do – but I think our best asset is still people, Tony. Avengers on one side of the country, in one little pocket in the world-.”
“Come on old man, you know who I am. You know what I’ve done, what I’m responsible for. This whole thing.” He spins his hand around to indicate the cave. “This is me, through and through. These people hate the US because it bombs them. It bombs them because I have my lobbyist go to Washington and scare the fuck out of Congress. Tell them what’s going to happen, make them shit their pants if they don’t buy the latest and greatest. But you know what they’re scared of?” Tony leans on his elbow. He doesn’t wait for an answer. “They’re not scared of what the terrorists can do to the innocent people, they’re terrified of what it will do to their ratings, their poll numbers. It’s always about the next election. Not about democracy. Not about anything else but the numbers. I learned that from dear old pops.”
Glancing back to the store clerks, he notes they all are trying to not stare at them – and doing a poor job of it. He returns his attention to the prince and in a low voice says, “We’re not saving humanity from itself today like we agreed. This is not up for debate, my prince. You are not doing this. I don’t even know how you found out what shops I frequented.”
“Maybe. Winning is never guaranteed. I have to find a way to figure out how the Supreme Intelligence knows our moves before we do. Is it so strategically advanced that it’s out maneuvering us or-.”
The cold pit grows in Tony’s belly and he turns to the table, determined, angry and bent on a new resolution.
“Do you think it’s safe to try again so soon?” Cho asked as she checked the heart monitor.
“You do that,” Tony says, because in all seriousness he has no idea what shit is going to go down tonight. He trudges back across the hall. He should make plans, he should figure out what’s the next step, but the truth of the matter remains that Tony’s not a soldier – he never was. He’s not a spy or a cop. He doesn’t know how to handle these matters. He should have called in Rhodey. Who knows if those guys are dead? Who knows if Nat – no
“It’s Tony,” he says and grimaces. “May I come in?”
“I can handle one drink,” Steve says. “But I’m not a fan of brandy, so I’ll pass.”
“Well, we put a man on the moon with your help, I’m pretty sure we can figure this out,” Tony said, and Howard clapped him on the back.
“The Purge. You’ve been to the Purge,” Tony gasps. The feral omegas are there – how long have they been there? Are they breeding, if what Steven says is true? “What have you seen?”
She clears her throat and says, “Steve, please stand next to Mister Stark. You’ll need to learn how to help him navigate through crowds of people without actually giving anything away.”
“So, I get tossed aside?” The dark shadows around them pulsed red. Was it of passion? Was it of pain? Or maybe it was the rage teeming inside of Tony.
“Popcorn for movies and I’m finishing up the dough for fresh bread.”
“Well, it’s hard to separate the two-.”
“What? Tony, what’s going on?” Bruce said reaching for him to stop him.
“Furin, you old son of a bitch,” Tony says.
“I didn’t know you could cook.”
“Yeah,” Tony murmured. Steve gathered him in his arms and cradled Tony.
“No weapons?” Natasha asked and crossed her arms. “That’s bold and it might be stupid.”
Tony rolls his eyes. Why did he program this AI to be overly sassy. “I apologize to your electrons. Tell me what’s the scoop.”
“Then I did my job. Stay safe, Tony.” He hung up and something deep inside him quivered with fear. If everything that Sitwell, Fury, and Hill said was right, then people like Tony would be on the chopping block. He had to keep focused, on target and not let his emotions lead the way. Even when it came to Bucky, even when it came to Tony. He did what he could and now he needed to zero in on the one thing of importance. The mission.  As he went to meet up with his team, he spoke the Mantra out loud.
“I have to see if I can get him cleared. He’s scheduled for termination.” Pep considers Tony for a long moment. “You’re really going to do this? He’s an enemy of the Council of Worlds. He nearly destroyed the Council back in his day. He’s been in stasis for a reason. You really think walking with him at your side will impress anyone at the Council?”
Nat met Fury’s gaze and Tony saw it, spotted - the sorrow but also the determination. “We need his help.”
Somehow Steve relents and he says, “She was a nurse. My dad died when I was very young. She died when I was eighteen. Seems like yesterday. But it was forever ago.”
“I have a surprise for you,” Tony says and ushers Steve back to the table. They settle in their chairs.
He reaches for the bowl. The woman – Frigga – smiles. “Here. Small sips.”
“Yes, we spoke of him briefly on the ship. Estane was my father’s alpha by proxy. Dad was a beta and until I came of age, the Stark family needed an alpha to keep their place at the table. Once I came of age, I kept Estane on but things got messy when I came back to make my claim. He didn’t like it, and he left. It wasn’t on the best of terms. ” Tony begins to eat and when he notices Steven not eating he taps his bowl with his fork. “Eat. You had a very strenuous night and you are still slightly under weight.”
“Yeah. No. Just off with the VR and no glasses for now.” Tony pulls off the gloves and hands them to Steve as he unsnaps the VR goggles.
Equipment spread out in front of him, telling stories of how long he’s worked on this project. The incentive had been to find Bruce, to find a way to track him beyond the Quinjet landing near Fiji, but it changed, transmuted into something else. When he figured out a little about the mind gem, when he looked deeper, and deeper still until he’d finally broached something – magnificent, something insane, something with the possibilities to change the world.
The last thing Steve sees is the Red Skull screaming and dissipating into a fine black dot of nothingness. The last thing he feels is Tony’s kiss upon his lips and a whisper of goodbye….
Steve laid next to him on the couch. They’d snuggled after eating pizza and drinking too much beer. Steve somehow managed to get his body notched into the back of the couch, Tony rested on top of him. He listened to Steve’s heart. They hadn’t been physical but somehow this felt more intimate to Tony than anything he’d ever done before with anyone else.
“What the hell does that have to do with keeping the town safe from Schmidt’s Red Skull gang?” Bucky looks not only like he’s about to chew on nails but like he’s had one too many hours in the sun. He’s that hot under the collar.
Steve shrugs. “Something like that. Clint?”
“That’s unsettling and disturbing.” Steve sits down in the companion chair next to Tony. “What’s my role here?”
“It’s okay, Tony. I’m going to take good care of you.”
“What do you mean?” Bruce wasn’t looking at Steve but at the far windows and Manhattan.
Steve sat down at the island when Tony pointed to the stool. Steve needed to get to Clint, but when he stretched out his soul’s energy just a buzz returned from him.  He couldn’t manage to lock onto it and he surmised he needed Wong and for Clint to wake up for him to actually do anything. Would Clint wake up? Steve inwardly cursed, they needed Wong.
“It’s not the only network or outlet broadcasting the news, Boss.”
Shaking his head, Bruce says, “Lots of people come out West to get away from the repression of the East. I would think you would appreciate that.”
“Yes.”
Riled up, Steve took the bull by the horns or in lay man’s terms, he went for it. He grabbed Tony’s face and pressed his lips to his mouth. It wasn’t the best kiss. Their teeth clacked and their noses bumped, but after the muffled huh from Tony, he eased right into the kiss and Steve pursued it even further.  All these months, years, of denial culminated into this moment. The hunger that grew in Steve from his earliest days overtook him. He hadn’t realized, had been blind to the truth, had fooled himself for too long. The kiss transformed into something wild and passionate.  He dragged his hands down Tony’s throat, clawed at his clothes. He would never have come up for air, happy to drown in the ecstasy of the moment. But it was Tony who stopped it, pushed him a way and gulped for air. Once he brought in enough breath, Steve moved again on him, but Tony pressed a hand to his chest and stopped him.
They remand him into Natasha’s custody. He’s not allowed to interact Tony as he awaits the sham trial. The team knows it. Natasha plans to smuggle him to a secure location. He’ll live his life in solitude but he will live. When the day comes to leave, he refuses. Steve can’t go without Tony, they know it and ignore it.
“Yes, Hydra. They started experiments. A lot of people started to go missing. It seems as if the Maximoff twins volunteered. They wanted to ensure that no more of their countrymen were abducted.”
Her face twists slightly and she shakes her head. “There are worst places to be than the Soul Stone Realm, Steve. You want to live again, don’t you?” She pats his shoulder. At that moment he knows he has a lot to learn. She leaves him going to the hearth to ladle out the soup.
as omega. There were somethings that Estane taught him about the alpha-omega dynamic that were worthy.
The strands of their souls led Tony, and he willingly followed. Steve opened to him, pulled him close and Tony pounded against him, searching, seeking, needing more. He wondered, worried it might be too much for Steve to give. Yet, Steve begged him to take him, cried out in frustration as he worked with Tony, matching his rhythm; he came again and again. That’s when Tony realized it – Steve came but didn’t climax. He hadn’t reached that peak. It seemed incongruent but true. It almost dissolved the moment, but then out of instinct Tony turned to their bond, their interlocked souls. He worked the strands that linked them together, strumming them. They pulsed and sang, vibrating as Tony slammed into Steve’s body. The need, the open, craving ache from Steve, drove Tony forward, pushed him into a punishing pace even as their souls burst into a bright light all around them.
“I can’t ask you to do this-.” Steve shook his head and turned, walking a distance away. The world around them faded to darkness and they stood like two actors on a stage. The dreamscape couldn’t even place them in a time or a space. They were so separated and separate from one another. “I can’t have you in this much pain, Tony. You mean too much to me.”
“And now?” Tony asks and he looks so young.
Tony snorts and buries his face in Steve’s hair. “God, you got the reference. It’s not even that funny, but I can’t – I can’t stop laughing.” He giggles with uncontrolled hiccups thrown in.
“Boy I really screwed up your life in more ways than one.”
“No,” Clint said. “Laura tried to accept it. That we mated, and it was destined to happen. She tried. I don’t blame her for it. We were a happily married couple with kids. Then Natasha came into my life and – things changed.”
“It’s only me, Strange, and your medics. That’s all. Plus, your staff,” Wong agrees. His feet whisper across the floor as he leaves.
“In bed,” Tony whispers as if he doesn’t even believe the words he speaks himself.
"Slavery was not allowed in the North."
Taking out her stethoscope, she places it in her ears and leans over to listen to his heart. It is the first time he notices he’s not wearing a shirt, but he is wearing simple pajama bottoms. He tries not to think about who put him in them.
“What depends on it?” Steve keeps his hands-on Tony’s shoulders, massaging them.
“Take them to Luke’s. He’ll take care of you.” Natasha ushers them out.
“We all have human mates,” Tony said. Even to his ears it sounded like a weak argument.
He finds the first one in the kitchen, hanging on the wall as if it’s been there the entire time he’s housed the Avengers. Standing by the coffee maker, dull and sleepy, he looks up and there it is – a painting. He furrows his brows and rubs at his beard. The painting is nothing special. It is just a painting of some trees, a few mountains in the background, and wispy clouds. He walks around the counter and places himself in front of the painting figuring it is small only about a half meter in width and a little over that in length. He can still smell the wet oil from it.
“No.” Tony doesn’t know what else to say. This whole thing is insane. “Everything is crazy, Steve. But you can’t get there anymore. Right?”
Rumlow winks. “I think you don’t, at least not to the prince.” He peels back Steve’s collar. “Nice bruise you got there right on your pulse point.” He snickers. “What kind of personal assistant did you say again?”
The high pitches whine of an AI in distress wakes him. He feels movement, quick and decisive next to him. It takes him a while to shake off the depths of slumber to realize that what he’s hearing isn’t normal, to realize the screech of Jo-Jo and Penny is nothing short of a death howl. He jolts to wakefulness but it doesn’t matter because a brutal fist slams into his face and he crashes back against the headboard and then topples to the bed. He tries to shield his head as someone grasps his hair and wrenches him from the bed.
Tony whispers this time. “It might take a little while; your senses are much better than mine.”
She escorts him to the door and picks up some cookies along the way. She wraps them in a paper napkin and tucks them into the paperbag. Before she gives them to him, she tells him she’ll get him an extra napkin from the kitchen. She disappears and comes back only minutes later, handing him the bag. “For the road.”
“Well, let me get Vision to bring up the food.” Tony leans over to the side table and picks up his phone. It is voice activated and Vision responds with the food in only minutes. Both he and Pietro enter the room with two large trays of food.
Tony would have spent time quizzing Legolas about his secrets, but being so close to Steve set off the echo in his head again and he squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to balance. He went through the Mantra. It might be a crutch but at least it hushed the reverberations of his own thoughts in his brain. He might need to stay as far away from Steve as possible if this was going to be a plague in his head all the time. Clint watched him with a critical eye.
Steve realizes he’s been staring at his boots, how he marches one foot in front of the other. He peers up to find out what’s happening only to see a massive dark storm cloud on the horizon. “A storm?”
“Well, we have a whole new crew of members mainly made up of homicidal maniacs.” Tony dared Steve with those cunningly brilliant eyes to refute his statement.
“Don’t think that way,” Steve says and realizes how that sounds. “Ultron was an attempt to save the world from outside attacks. No one can fault you for that.”
Steve smiles and shakes his head as he looks down at his Commander’s star. He’s not even sure why he bothers to wear it anymore. Bowing his head, he half smiles and then reports in at the Honor Guard. When he runs through the sequences to assign the Stark party to the Howling Commando, he finds it’s already signed off on and twists his lips at the blinking screen.
This perks up Tony. “What’s that? You talked to him on the phone? When? Why?”
“When’s the last time the specimen disobeyed?” Happy asked.
“The pack works well only if we do it together.”
“You’ll be surprised. No one’s falling tonight,” Tony replies, his tone cool, collected.
Fury stepped up to the display. “According to the intel, it looks like it is heavily guarded.”
“Your time is nearly finished. You are not so needy,” he says and pets a hand down Steve’s chest through the drying come.
“Tony, come on. You need to tell me how to get this thing open so I can check on you?”
Stane’s large paw lands on Tony’s shoulder. “Power corrupts, Tony. You know that, I know that. Don’t you think it’s already corrupted you? I mean look at you with your little whore who happens to be hiding in the other room.” Steve hides again, cursing himself for being found out. “You think hiring a hooker is something someone of virtue would do? You’re not a knight in shining armor Tony. It’s about time you come to realize you’re ruthless like your father, like me. We raised you right. You know what to do. We make the final strike at the end of the week.” He pats Tony’s shoulder and then calls out, “You can come out now and suck his dick or whatever it is he wants you to do. Just remember your place.”
The Avengers ship houses the workshop on the lower deck. Steve enters a lift as instructed by JARVIS and finds his way through narrow corridors to the workroom. It’s deserted when he enters. The lights automatically switch on and Steve scans the room looking for the needed supplies. He considers leaving the ship and going back to the Brothel at least he knows where everything is there. Plus, it would be nice to gab with Wanda.
“A little. You have vivid dreams.”
“And you don’t have to save us every day, Tony.”
Steve had looked straight at him. His eyes were sunken and bruised with the nightmare he'd suffered. His resolve though seemed to solidify like a hulking mountain between them. It was made of rock and granite and nothing Tony blasted it with could break it.
He gathers up the armor pieces and piles them under the tree. There’s no fire right now and what’s left of the deer is completely gone. He’s no idea where it went. Hopefully scavengers didn’t come sniffing around last night. He isn’t going to worry about what kind of animals they might be. He scans the horizon for any signs of animal life beyond himself and Blu. He finds some birds high in the sky, but nothing else.
Tony wraps an arm around his waist, tucking him close as he pounds into him. Steve cannot help the mewling and then outright sobbing need that streams out of him.
Tony pushes Steve away and scrambles out of bed. “No, do not say it’s me, do not go there.” He shivers as if the repugnance he feels is a physical thing. “I get it, I understand. I’m a worthless asshole. You know the whole of my story I would assume. I get it.” Tony separates himself, walking the distance to the doors, picking up his clothes as he attempts to exit.
The Enforcer took up residence right next to Clint. Ross gestured to Clint. “You are on duty, Agent Barton. You know what he did to Agent Rumlow.”
She leans down and opens a drawer in the table to retrieve a remote control. Pointing it at the painting on the wall, she activates it and the painting slips into the wall pocket and a screen appears. The screen warms and lightens as several photographs and biographies of men appear on it.
“It’s not that bad, Steve,” His face said the opposite; that part of him was horrified at what Steve would have to endure.
"What do you think your name is?"
There’s a drafting table and a cart with supplies next to it. The wall that’s shared with the lab has shelving that’s filled with every art supply or tool in any catalogue. On the other side of the door, the wall has the digital art set up. It’s so much more than Steve has ever had. There’s even a small room to the side with a sink to clean brushes. When Steve ventures inside he finds another room – a small bathroom with a sink, toilet, and shower. He can’t believe the finishes – all metal and marble. It’s a weird combination but somehow works. When he steps back into the main art room, Tony’s leaning against the door.
“You got that?” Steve asked and his mouth felt dry. He licked his lips. His natural reaction to pull away rose but Steve fought it off. “You heard all of that?”
“You said.” The pain shoots through him and he swallows down the urge to vomit. “You said that no one soul can dismiss your power. No
“Sure, boss. The weather for your location shows a significant weather pattern and blizzard hanging around for another 36 hours at least. Wind gusts up to 80 miles per hour with sustain winds of 40 miles per hour expected. Roads are hazardous and local officials are banning any non-emergency travel.”
“You’ve grown by leaps and bounds, Steve. What have I missed?” Tony reaches out to him.
Steve giggles as if Tony’s joking but then he catches the serious grimace on the prince’s face. “Really? You fly in space, you fly that machine? That Iron Man armor in combat and you don’t like heights?”
“Tony’s been worried sick,” Natasha said. Her eyes were soft, not challenging. She looked tired, and that was saying something for a vampire.
“Sure thing.” Steve offers the guy a little salute as he blows a kiss. Before he leaves, Frank half-springs at Tony, but stops and laughs when he startles.
He does not.
“You’re hurt.” Tony tries to convince him again. “You, all of you could come to my house – or any of my houses. I have a few. Anywhere in the world. I could help you, please let me help you.”
“Forty minutes without traffic or rain, but since Thor decided that it needed to rain all day -.” He shrugged. “Might take an hour or more.” Traffic in DC was a nightmare.
“What?” Tony said. “We’re not all going to touch him now and get labeled?”
He sips his soup and raises it as if in salute. “I know.” He winks.
His failure transforms to glittering gems, stones of different colors with different powers. They hold the secret and the promise of a peaceful world, a world where he doesn’t have to fight anymore. Where the Silver Knight can be put to rest. He dreams of being old, of seeing the day he can lay down his arms and just go home. But he knows there is no real home for him. He’s substituting a dream for a home because his home died.
“What the? What the hell’s going on?”
Yet there was and is something missing.
“Like I said, not a sir,” Fury says and steps away from the booth so that Bucky can slip out and Steve can exit.
The bigger man rubs Steve’s shoulder and jostles him a bit. “No worries, Steve. This isn’t my first rodeo, but it is yours. Watch how it’s done.”
“Jesus, you will be the death of me.” And suddenly Steve’s pulled onto the prince’s lap, their mouths locked together.
“What the hell are you talking about?”
He turns from the omega to his loyal First. “Pep,” he says and he takes both of her hands in his and clasps them.  He shouldn’t do this – but part of who he is needs to do this. It isn’t about just a show of strength, but a play of compassion and caring. “I feel it, and it feels right. I’m supposed to do this. He’s mine. I tell you that not as a joke or anything else. But if I’m right, well, I’m always right. He’s mine.”
Steve laughs and lightly kisses him. “No. Thank God for that. Come. Sit for me?” Tony nods and goes to grab his t-shirt, but Steve stills his hand. “If you don’t mind, can we go without the shirt?”
“What’s wrong? What can I do?”
“Never,” Steve said, and he shook his head. “I can’t believe he would ever hurt me.”
Clearing his mind, he goes into the bedroom and settles in the single wooden chair. He pulls out a small book and flips it open. Steve is left with his thoughts; a dangerous place to wade these days as he sits with the forgotten book on his lap. He watches as his friend writhes on the cot, tormented by dreams and the agony of pain. His wound isn’t closing properly and, from what Bruce reported, it looks worse by the hour. Steve doesn’t have a choice, they need to get Thor’s brother, Loki, back to town and find out if he can help with his knowledge of medicines, especially since it was probably a concoction of his poisons that did this to Bucky in the first place.
Tony frowns and shakes his head. “I wanted to hate you. I thought I should. What you did, what you hid, I don’t think I can ever stomach. But this, this is so much worse. What you did to yourself, I can’t abide by it. I think if this kills you, I might just cross over and hate you. Why did you do this to yourself? Why?”
"Come tell me; what's the squirrel that's nattering about in your head?"
No. Not truly alone. The other vampire on the cross next to him, the skeletal thing that moved and
Steve finishes a chicken leg. “The safest hands are still our own.”
“And he can’t do it without his friends,” Rhodes returns. “Say hello to him. It will make him feel better after everything that’s happened. He needs to know you’re here.”
“I think I said something in the past, but mainly to pay the bills. I couldn’t get a showing to save my life with fine arts. Step up on a rock about 3 inches.” Steve waits as Tony follows. “Present position excepted; I don’t really love technical drawing. That was out. I love stories. And I’m working on the one now.”
Steve always kissed with his hands holding and cupping Tony’s face as if his mouth couldn’t taste enough, as if his body needed to feel everything, every sensation all at once. He touched Tony then, wiped away the blood tears and said, “I would let you drain every last drop of blood from me, if it meant I saved you. Don’t you get it?”
“You’re not afraid?” Steve murmurs.
“It’s like you’re my North – so maybe not electric itself, but electromagnetic? I don’t know. I’m just tuned to you, I know where you are, I can tell the expression on your face just by the way you breathe. I can feel the hope and the pain. It’s a physical thing. Am I reading it all wrong?” Tony asks and there’s an agony growing deep in his chest.
“Okay, yeah,” Tony said and ran his hands through his hair, mussing it. Then he cupped them over his mouth and blew out. “I only sipped my drink. I’m not even drunk. I can’t believe I fell asleep.”
“Well, you understand wrong,” Tony said and pressed fingers to his temples. “I wanted to be part of this – for some God forsaken reason that I can’t seem to recall now. But this is not what I wanted. I didn’t want all this noise in my head and I sure as hell didn’t want to be
Morgan kisses his cheek and makes him promise that tomorrow they’ll spend time in his garage workshop on her go-kart (Steve does not approve).
“Don’t get snotty at me,” Tony says, and they head to the basement.
As he climbs back to his feet, Blu nudges him again with his big snout. Teetering, Tony does not have enough balance with his injured arm and painful ribs to keep standing and he falls again. With a huff he goes down and Blu swishes his tail; his mouth open in a terrible grimace.
“It’s beautiful, Tony.” Steve braces against the chilled winds. “But the sky, it’s so different.”
“No. Neither of us needed to be there.” Tony corrected. “I know what you’re thinking. You think just because you’re Captain America you should pull up your bootstraps and just deal with it. But I’m not doing that, and you don’t have to either.”
“You.” Steve swallows. “You asked him to pay me extra so there’s no clause? Me?”
“Oh, you don’t have to worry, mister Stark. Those are for the guards only. The 18704 isn’t allowed outside. From what I heard the last time 18704 was allowed those privileges was about 15 years ago.” He patted his ample belly. “Long before my time. 18704 tried to escape.”
“Stop, before you hurt yourself,” Tony says and opens up his shirt to look at the arc reactor. “Well, look at that, it actually works.” From what he can tell, Steve did a bang up job installing it. The flesh around the device looks pink but not inflamed, and the putrid wounds are gone, clean scars replace them.
Pep enters the board room and smiles at him, and the steps aside to allow Steven entrance. Penny’s right. He’s glorious, fit to be swooned over, absolutely a dream. He’s wearing the colors of the Stark family. Red and gold with a dash of blue and white. The suit itself is what is often called the daily suit for an omega. It is sleek, one piece, and a combat suit as well. It accents Steven’s shoulder to waist ratio which is perverse. The dark red highlights his complexion and the embellishments of gold to the star and the stripes across his chest emphasize his hair. The long navy blue stripes along his flank and his legs with the shadow of white following it stop Tony’s breath. At Steven’s throat is a new collar – one of red and gold again – the permanent one, except that it glitters and attaches to the rest of the uniform.
“Tell me this, will you do it again?” Tony says, kissing the nape of Steve’s neck.
“Really?” Tony says and he’s not that surprised. From what he witnessed before he descended in the elevator, the omega may be beaten and bruised but he still possesses a fierce defiance. “Bind him. Just to settle him. Nothing else.”
Those words sunk Tony’s heart. Natasha always seemed so distant and cold, like steel and ice. Yet, her words, the way to offered to shield him from the responsibility thawed her in his eyes.
In the shower he leaned against the wall and thought of Bucky in the dream. Was it the real Bucky? Is that what Bucky thought of him? Would think of him once he confessed? The dream space with Tony had prepared him for his transition, for the acceptance of who he was – but now it was just a nightmare of what he would confront when he saw Bucky again. “Shit.” He cried then. He didn’t want anyone to see him or hear him. For God’s sake he was Captain America – but the soul bond was a curse and hurt him time and again. The cold of the tile did nothing to take away the fact he denied so much, but at the same time he’d forgotten who he was – who he grew up to be. He put his hands over his face letting the water pound down on him.
“It’s not something-.”
Back to work, he settles near his tree hollow and examines the HUD. It takes him the better part of an hour to dissemble the helmet pieces, shedding the outer plating in order to get to the circuits and electronics. He sets the helmet aside and pulls the chest piece over. He’s going to have to scavenge pieces if he’s going to get this thing to work. Without a way to solder, everything is going to be jerry-rigged together, but he has an idea how to bypass some of the fried circuits with use of the circuitry in the chest plate.
It’s odd and not very scientific but since he has no argument against it, and the universe is weird, it could happen. “But then why would you keep coming back as a lion. And why didn’t you just stay dead?”
Tony stops and stares at the Asgardian. His eyes are like flames. “He won’t let us in the Keep.”
“I know as much as you do with the new memories plopped in my head. And like I said I thought only kooks thought it was real.” Tony watched him for a few seconds and then pulled out his phone. “Here. Let me pull up some information for you.” He tapped on the phone and then handled it to Steve. “This is one of those conspiracy sites about it. Apparently the governments of the world have kept this pretty close to the vest.”
He had muffled his initial response of 'we could be' and just said, "I'll make it worth your while."
“Oh the mouth on you!” Tony snickers and then pushes the head of his cock against Steve who immediately stills. “There you go. Now it’s real. Take a deep breath, deep, deep breath. And then release it as you relax. It will make this easier for the first time.”
“Whoa!” Nat grabs for the cup. “What the hell? Stop it. It’s going to be fine. He’s going to need you.”
“You are looking for escape, and I want to tell you that you are fooling yourself if you think you will find it,” he says and he lightly touches his hand to Steve’s. “You are a good man and it is not a good idea to be lost as you are.”
“I don’t have a choice,” Steve answers. “I need to go now.” He lets go of her hand and starts away when she calls to him.
Only a breath away, everything Steve desires, the dreams and promises to touch another, to feel the bristle of a man’s beard against him. He should run, he should heed Bucky’s advice, because going down this path will only lead to ruin.
Tony crosses his arms as he studies the man. He told Pepper specifically no beauties, no handsome dudes. He wanted plain, homely, even ugly. That would work. Not this creation of the gods.
As Steve finishes loading the dishwasher he says in a low voice, “I mean no disrespect, Tony.”
What could happen? Nothing – he keeps telling himself. Nothing is going to happen. Steve is okay, he’s got things under control (if you call letting that Frank character beat the crap out of him every couple of weeks). He hates to think of other men or women touching Steve. He’s beginning to think in terms of being a couple with Steve, and not just a beneficial fuck relationship. He’s even dreamed of the future.
Righting himself, Steve sat up and touched his brow where blood leaked in a steady drip. He went to stand up and found several of his riding companions still in shock. He supposed that was for the best. Scanning his surroundings, Steve located Clint curled up against the front of the car but still unconscious. Steve felt the throb of the severed soul bond. Not severed really, but incomplete. The soul bond hadn’t the time to weave together before the train derailed and Steve had been thrown apart from Clint. It only takes a few seconds, but it was a fragile time. He needed to get Clint to Wong immediately. People around him were sobbing, but for the most part in stable condition. No one looked like they’d been seriously injured from Steve’s quick review of the few people in the car.
“What did he say?”
The blush is instantaneous. “Sorry.”
“Wh-what?”
Bruce points to the restless figure in the bed. “He tell you that?”
“Have it your way, my dearest, I will miss you,” Tony crones at Steve as he leaves the quarters and heads back to his assigned rooms. He shouldn’t even play like this with Tony – it feels too familiar, too comfortable.
Bruce glares at Tony in silence reproach before he turns to Logan and asks, “Do you need something to drink? To eat?”
The slice of Clint’s sword slashes through the air as Steve throws up the shield to thwart it. He stumbles and falls back as the ground beneath him shifts, changing from level grass to a steep drop off of gravel. Luckily, he recovers and only counts a few scrapes as his reward. Clint advances.
“Please.”
Across from the large bed he rests on, there’s a chair, broad and made of rattan. The cushions are floral print, but Steve cannot make out the entire pattern because someone is watching him. Someone is sitting in the chair.
Tony throws back his head and barks out laughter. He slaps a hand on his ass. Steve’s cock responds with a jump and his hips spontaneous hump the air. Tony strokes Steve’s ass. “That’s the way. Fuck the air for me.” His two fingers are in Steve’s entrance again, penetrating and spreading him. He thrusts back on the fingers pleasuring himself and feeling the heat of something he’s never experienced before warm his face all the way up to his hairline.
“No.” Why he said it, Tony couldn’t fathom or explain. He heard in the distance a voice ringing in his head, begging him, pleading with him. He aimed the repulsor but even as he debated a blur of motion swept by him. In milliseconds, the girl and her brother were standing next to him, her hands upraised and red energy crackling between them. He wanted to yell at her, to cry out, but then the world flashed crimson and he dropped away.
Those words feel like spikes in Tony’s heart. Instead of grilling the omega, Tony turns on his heel and starts out with Steven in tow. They head toward the fore section of the ship. All the while his omega marches with him. The corridors are mostly empty except for the occasional crew member who bows as Tony walks by. When they get on the lift, Tony asks, “Did you love your former alpha?”
“No, Tony. No. That’s not what I was saying.” Steve gets up and then slides into the booth on Tony’s side, forcing him to push in further toward the wall. He clasps both of Tony’s hands in his own. “That’s not what I was saying. I was saying that I can’t ever have hoped to be with you. I have nothing to offer. I’m an Army Vet with nightmares and a freelance comic book artist that can’t hold a job. I was lucky to have you pick me. Me! Of all the people you interviewed for the Personal Assistant job.
His life – his company- his memories. Not Obadiah’s. Not the government’s.
“Well you did at one time, I would think there would be coffee,” Thor says and he opens the cupboard under the sink.
“What happened?”
“No, Momma.”
“No one works for SHIELD because they want to, Cap,” Tony said and sighed. He took the phone from Steve and dialed back on what Steve thought was his sales pitch. “I guess we’re not doing this.”
“Here at the Retreat we can pair you up with an alpha that’s going through urgency – another client or we can pair you up with one of our professional alphas.” She flicks through the profiles pointing out some of their attributes. It feels like she’s trying to sell something to him.
Bruce frowns and exhales heavily. “I don’t know. We really don’t know a lot right now, Tony.”
When Tony brought a brand new Starkphone for Steve home one night the response had been worth it. Steve’s grin broadened as he opened the package that Tony had hastily put together. The gift bag dropped to the floor as Steve’s eyes widened.
“Not supposed, no-not supposed to see,” Steve stutters and coughs as he speaks. “B-but he never came, the Trans-Transformation ha-happened.”
“Thanks,” Tony says and puts the glasses on. “Lead the way.”
"Would you damn me?"
With seemingly practiced hands, Tony gently touches Steve’s nose. “Cartilage is really out of alignment. It’s snapped. You sure you want me to do this?”
Yinsen is a good man. Not like Tony. Tony has issues; there's something eating Tony's brain, a parasite. He thinks sometimes he can hear it gnawing at his neurons, especially in the dark of the cave. He clutched onto the battery. They'll come for him and tell him to make weapons. Now he sees his life laid out for him bare and ugly, vulnerable and fragile. He never saw himself like this in the States. He was the boy wonder. He could do anything. He was a genius and debonair and cunning all at once. Now he feels the dearth of despair and want and hunger. He'd never been hungry before now. He doesn't think it is a physical hunger but more of an emotional one. He feels the loss of Steve and all of his dreams. It is the whole in his chest.
“And not just for your ass,” Clint chimes in.
“Easy peasy?” Pepper yelps.
In the background, Tony hears the distinctive slash and slide of Logan’s claws, but he ignores it. If Logan gets out of control, Bruce is here. The Hulk can stop the Wolverine.
Steve ignores him and yanks out his bag. He stuffs his clothes, the clothes that were perfectly good enough into his case as he rushes into the bathroom to get his other supplies. He sees the purse of applicators and brings it with him, tossing it on the bed.
“Yes. From
“You really have done your homework.” Tony sat up. “It’s very much like that, but different.”
“Out of curiosity what does he do on his off days?”
Thanks for coming along with me on this little adventure!
Steve hops off his stool and shakes his head. He rubs at his eyes. “If I don’t get at least a shower to wake me up you’re going to have gibberish for code. Please, Tony.”
At that Bruce stood up from the chair he’d settled on when Stark left. “Come on in back. We can have some tea and talk.” He led Steve from the laboratory down a hallway that passed for a kitchenette and then to a sitting area that overlooked the cityscape. It was grand. That’s all Steve could think. He walked right up to the windows and gazed out. New York City had always meant so much to Steve. It meant home. It meant America. But now he knew that was a false illusion. The United States was something – an amalgamate of ideas and places. New York City only reflected a tiny portion. How could he, as Captain America, symbolize them all? Should he symbolize all of them? His heart ached for something simpler. At least the war had been simple in its way. Painted a kind of black and white. Sure there was the gray – internment camps, segregated troops. Yet, the overall focus on the good and the evil – that was simple, and in that he understood how to symbolize America.
“Now,” Tony says and stalls. His body leans forward against Steve. He grasps both of Steve’s hands. His gaze lifts. “And now, with this connection, this link, I’m exposed whether or not I like it. I’m vulnerable and…”
“What did you say?” He touches the back of his head where the small disc of the implant sits.
“We all have our own devils, Captain,” Tony says and lays back in his chair, his hand slipping from Steve’s. Though Jarvis dotes on him, Tony looks refreshed and healthy as if the attack or sickness that gripped him was only a figment of Steve’s imagination.
“Call it pragmatic. I see the reality of the situation. Tell me you don’t know half the stories of the people of this town, looking for some kind of redemption or hide-out, or a way to start fresh?”
“Oh, okay,” Tony says and searches around the kitchen.
Tony rubs his face and tries to stem the tide of his nausea. “I don’t know. I think. I think the implant, the interface might be affecting it.”
“Getting a little tired of spy warnings,” Steve says and heads back to the lounge. He checks the time and notes that the Commando will have less than half an hour to get prepared for launch. That doesn’t leave much time for Clint to hunt down anything on Tiberius. Steve hopes he might be able to catch Pepper alone before they have to board for transport to the Lemurian Star.
Steve eyes the terrorist as if he’s weighing how far he wants to go with whatever the hell his compromise is. He gives one more word, which to Tony sounds like a number, maybe how many days?
“Excuses, excuses,” Steve says with a half cocked smile. Even as he teases Tony, Steve relaxes his bent legs.
“How?” That was the new guy. “How’d you find him?”
Rumlow and his agents approached the car.
“You need to speak with our good Captain. Tell him your fears. I can only guide you, but I cannot do it for you,” Thor said and then he nodded once before he left Tony to his own thoughts by the corner of the property.
“I think that’s already apparent,” Tony says and his hand stretches out to run fingers through the tips of Steve’s wing feathers. Steve inhales in sharp pants and his mind blanks at the touch. Tony stops when he witnesses the effect the action has on Steve. “Tell me, what consequences.”
“Well, guess we’re stuck here. Rest of the team isn’t coming for our little holiday, teambuilding exercise.” Steve waves his arms to indicate the massive lodge they rented for the team and some support members to spend the long February weekend.
Steve stands, exhales loudly, and then wipes away the melted snow that’s dripping from his hair. “I’m actually pretty fine with the cold. I always wanted to be able to go out in the cold as a kid but couldn’t ‘cause I was so sickly. But people think I hate the cold because of the crash. I honestly don’t remember much of the crash. Last thing I remember is talking to Peggy. That’s all.”
Steve frowns. It’s probably a way for Ultron to distract them from the rim. Ultron leading them to the Hub sounds dubious at best, and malevolent at worst.
“You can,” Tony says. “Tell me what you need. I have money. I have power. I can get you out of here.”
Steve shakes his head. “I don’t think so.”
The clock ticks.
“Maybe,” Clint said. He had moved away from Tony, but still stood where Tony could see his tortured expression in profile. “I wanted to see if there was a way to bring her around. To see if we could have vampires and humans living together peacefully. Not with conclaves and separate and unequal. But really try. I saw the wars as a kid. Learned about them. But I wanted to make a difference. The conclave set up wasn’t working. I thought this might make a difference.”
Natasha slapped his back. “Welcome to the future.”
Unsnapping his jacket, he tugs it off and lays his head back on the cushion of the chair while he stares off into the dark shadows surrounding him. Nothing around him feels like him, nothing fits. He lives in a place that feels more like Way Station than the comfort of a home – like the Howling Commando had been, like Tony had been.
When Tony concentrated on the energy binding them together the sensation of loss and flailing rammed hard into his chest and then the security, the hope, the wish from Steve caught him, brought him back to sanity. “Wow, I didn’t realize. I usually.” He blinked a few times and Steve grasped his shoulder. “I usually just see it mathematically. A little bit of the metaphysical, but mainly math helps me understand it. But that was freaky.”
“But that was a data dump, Fury’s smarter than that,” Steve says. “He wouldn’t have had something like that on the SHIELD servers.”
Natasha folds her hands and places her elbows on the table. “I think we’re more concerned about you than we are about some silly Rail contest, aren’t we Bucky?”
“You made a promise to a man who died over 70 years ago, Steve.” Tony stays put though every fiber in his body wants to cross the distance between them. He has a secret. A secret that’s worse than finding out about his parents.
“Just change and then throw the suit out,” Clint said. He concentrated on keeping the helicopter stable as Steve crawled in the back and dug out the jeans, shirt, hoody, and sneakers. The shoes looked ridiculously huge. They really didn’t fit. He tore away the jacket and pants of his uniform. Then he discarded the undershirt. The bite mark from Tony was very nearly healed. He struggled to get the pants on and then pulled on the t-shirt and hoody. He looked like a frat boy reject.
Shrugging, Sawyer answered, “Not much anymore. It’s learned the repercussions.” He leaned in as if to share a confidence. His breath smelt like old fish. Tony coughed. “Once I heard they whipped 18704 and nearly killed it. Took weeks for it to come out of its coma. We got recordings of it. If you want to see it.” He glanced at the van with a fake studious pondering. “You might need to. You gotta understand how dangerous this thing is.”
“-dropped - shield. At your request.” His words feel strong his mouth and the room silences as he finishes. “Find a new omega, Tony. Find a new captain.” He turns away, facing Natasha. She lifts her chin to signal to Tony and Steve hears him leave the room.
Tony watched Steve’s hand, his long strong fingers as he painted the air. He imagined starlight at Steve’s fingertips, and he smiled into his chest. He could get used to it; he could fall in love with Steve. He forced himself to take a step back, knowing all too well that vulnerability was the last thing he needed.
“Among other languages, but strangely I read it better in Braille.” He laughs. “Anyhow.” He places the book on the side table. “Do you want to get some tea? Maybe some soup?”
“Be serious,” Steve said. “If we ever want Strange to get us out of here, we have to show we’re trying. Like we said he must be monitoring us somehow.”
Steve agrees and then says, “I’ll be here. Waiting.” Inwardly he cringes. That was not smooth at all. Bucky would laugh at him. The prince only smiles and then turns back to his work. He leaves Steve alone to his side of the vast room to watch the stream of different shows.
“No,” Tony says and reaches out to catch Steve’s wrist. He tugs him to turn and look at him. “Steve, I’m sorry if I did something you didn’t want. I am. I’m sorry that Natasha knows. But I’m very sorry that you want to deny yourself something that could bring you endless joy and bring you love.”
“The Gravity bowl is really a misnomer. It’s the only place in the whole station where gravity isn’t in play.” Tony nods to Steve. “That’s why I asked you to wear the suit. The boots are designed to clamp onto the decking of the stands. The players have to fight the lack of gravity and sometimes too much gravity in order to score.”
“Call me Bruce. If we’re going to be bonded I think that would be best, don’t you?” He crossed his arms and tucked his hands under them.
“I wouldn’t say exactly that-.”
He blinked away the tears as they stopped for fuel and Clint took over the driving. Sleep eluded him, but the blur of the road brought him back to his earliest days. A smear of life before his life began with Tony. He’d lost so much – his whole life, his people, his Ma, Bucky, his other friends, and yet his life breathed new when the mating clicked into place.  As they finished the last of their drive to the safe house, Steve gazed at the compound. The security was impeccable because Tony invented it. It would take a mole or a nuke to break into the place. Even with that knowledge, the tension rooted deep in Steve’s psyche. He rotated his shoulders as he directed Clint toward the underground parking. The house was above ground, a sprawling ranch style house situated on over a thousand acres of wooded and meadow area. Tony called it mid-century modern, but he also enhanced it so that the roof line looked like a forested landscape. Small trees and brush adorned the roof.
“He was my father, yeah, and it isn’t New York anymore. When my father died, I moved the whole estate to California. It’s more my style.”
It dug into him but he allowed the mistaken conclusion. It would be easier that way. Tony didn’t need to know that Steve loved him, but looking at him and talking to him was like a caricature of his former self. He’d wanted to discuss his pain, how Tony as a Courtesan had invaded Steve’s life, and then slowly unwound it, teasing out all the knots, and straightening his head and his heart. Tony as a Courtesan was different than Tony, Sir Stark, or Tony the Engineering genius. Tony as a Courtesan had a mission.
“Shit!” Tony hears and then realizes it’s him. He rushes over to Steve with both Bruce and Logan on his tail. The pad and pen are forgotten on the floor and Steve is panting in anguished breaths. He’s dripping with sweat but when Tony touches him, he feels cold, clammy. “Steve. Steve! You’re here. You’re with us.”
They were closer than he’d thought. He hissed through the pain but was grateful – it jolted him enough that his alertness ratcheted up a notch – just what he needed. The unassuming back gate to the perimeter of the compound loomed. There was no way for him to stop and get it to open.
It takes a while to think of something, anything to calm Steve, but he does. “You said this time was different.”
“It’s only a bit and it will help me fall asleep. Once I do, you need to just hit enter and the download will start.” Tony sips the drink. “Want some?”
He grits his teeth and trudges onward through the dank underground prison when Redwing screams a warning. Bucky doesn’t have a lot of time but he drops Steve to the side and yanks out his weapon as a half dozen troopers emerge from the stairwell. Picking the first three off is easy, the last three scatter and it becomes a shootout. Seeing where to shoot in the dark basement with its low ceiling and leaking pipes is difficult but Bucky pulls out his grenade. He knows that it’s dangerous – the whole damn fortress might fall on his head. But he dials the grenade to a stun and tosses it over to the hiding place of the troopers. It goes off with a quiet thrum and then two of the soldiers drop to the floor. That leaves the third one. Bucky eases around the pillars – major load baring structures to hold up the ancient fortress.
Steve poked at the fire with the iron. “Once, when I was growing up we had this little tiny house. Only time I lived in a house, but we couldn’t’ always afford the coal, so sometimes we just used wood in the pot belly stove we had. Learned how then.”
“I don’t. I don’t think I want a woman alpha.”
Why does that name sound familiar? He’s been out of circulation for seventy years, he still has a lot to catch up on.
“Some of them are in German.”
“Wha-?” The crack of his voice scrapes at his hearing and he only wants to roll over and go back to sleep. Whatever happened, it’s not good.
Bucky whacks at him but stands up and takes the few steps toward the window. “We need a doctor in town, you know that. We got the mid-wife, but she’s no good at the other stuff.  This town needs so much. You want to build it into some place nice. Parlor Inn is falling apart. No doctor. Plus, we need someone to shoe the horses.”
“Either bring me back or so help me give me my damned helmet so I can drive back myself.”
“Sorry. I can’t figure out how to talk about it.”
And he does. With a guttural cry he comes over Tony’s hand. A mess of semen as he shakes and weeps. Tony pets him. He’s sorry that it has to be this way in some aspects. He genuinely finds the omega intriguing. He thinks they will be friends one day. But they are not lovers. They are never going to be lovers. An omega is a warrior first and foremost. This – this is not really pleasure but a means to an end. It is about submission and fealty – that is what nature made them to be.
Right now, Bruce stares at him like Tony’s about to go nuclear. “What is going on?”
Steve feels the heat of his pursuers, hears Bucky’s laughter from amongst the crowd. Time ticks and he needs to get to Tony, there’s no other way. Through the maze, he’s hopelessly lost in the midst of turns and twists. He might be able to reconstruct it with his eidetic memory, but he needs time and the only thing he has is his muscles and strength.
The Hub isn’t anything that Steve imagined, but it’s not a place or a virtual reality, but a state of mind. The Hub is built on the mind of a devious, unforgiving artificial intelligence. Not some entity capable of empathy or understanding but an analytical being that simply put facts together, erased of any emotion or humanity. It may have once stated its purpose to destroy and then recreate the world in its own image, but the underlying reality is far different.
“Beautifully exquisite.”
(See the end of the chapter for
is, but the again he doesn't have to. "The other women in the neighborhood shunned her, said things about her behind her back. Sometimes not behind her back. But not Ma. She would invite her over for Sunday dinner even though we didn't have much. They'd come and we'd all eat, talk, laugh. It was fun. It was something good. I didn't understand until I grew a little older. Until she was long gone with her baby. But Ma only saw her as someone who needed and wanted to help."
“I don’t want to hear it. I’ll deal with this tomorrow. Steve, please assist me to my room.”
“I’m good, I’m fine,” he said and shook his head. “Actually I’m less than fine. I need to know something Rhodey.”
“In the Purge, the Omegas do they have omega children? Are they able to breed?” As Tony waits, he notices how Steven weighs his answer. “Don’t lie to me.”
“I didn’t mean go get dinner!” Tony yells after the big animal. “We’re not married or anything.” He looks down at his lap, filled with the armor and then back at the trail where Blu disappeared. “This really does look like some freakish Disney film. Here I am the little Disney Princess and you’re the distraught prince.” He giggles. He needs food and water.
“How can you tell? Because it glows?” Steve asks.
He had cried as Blu lay dying in his arms and his mind ached with thoughts of complete loss. He could not fathom leaving Blu behind, he could not fathom the idea of Blu dying. Blu had taken care of him, had fed him, watched over him in the night, and led him to safety. Blu understood him when nightmares racked his sleep and he needed to nest further into the big animal’s fur.
“Don’t worry. I am not so tender of the heart to be offended by arrogance.” He smiles but his eyes never catch the emotion. The smile masks his worry, his concern for Tony.
“I want you in me, I want to feel every part of you.” Tony murmurs because, even in this most intimate moment, a small part of him is abashed.
“He’s joining SHIELD? After we found out it was playing around with Hydra weapons?” Bruce said and his voice showed only despair and disapproval. “I thought better of him.”
“Tony,” Steve breathes out his name like a prayer.
Looking directly at Sam became a problem. To sink so low that he couldn’t face his friend nearly stopped him from saying anything, but when he did glance up, Sam offered nothing but open and honest compassion. “I’ve been, I’ve been dreaming. A lot.”
“What? No, Steve, you have to keep the helmet on. I can hear you through the little microphone I installed.” Tony yanks at Steve’s hands to keep him from the latches.
"Can’t find the prison block," Bucky replies, his breath thick in his throat as he turns a corner only to confront another group of troopers. He sprays them with blasts from his rifle and turns to race away.
Bucky Barnes but some distorted tortured version of his friend, his Brother, that killed Tony’s parents and dozens, if not hundreds, of others.
“Yeah, that’s what I was trying to tell you, the magnet at the end of it. See, that was it. You just-.”
“And it has to do with Steve?”
“It’s probably the serum and the blood I gave you,” Tony said. “Bruce will come by and take a look.”
Through the events of the Mandarin and after, Tony finds himself at a loss for who he really is.
Bruce shrugs and runs a hand through his tangled hair. He always looks besieged but that’s the nature of the beast he holds within him, Tony supposes. “Shouldn’t we wait to hear what Logan has to say?”
“Neither do I,” Tony said and placed a hand on his chest. He rubbed at his scar and then walked over to the window.  As he stood in profile, Steve caught the grimace.
“Yes, sir,” Steve says as if he’s a soldier. He played the part in order to try and save Bucky. It didn’t work.
It shakes Tony to his core. “Don’t do that, you’re creeping me out.”
He stops before he exits. Turning he says to Tony, “I never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today. You made me ashamed of my job, my job which is respectable and needed.”
Steven glances at him and Tony sees the fleeting rebellion on his face, but then it fades and he simply opens his shoulder clip to his collar to reveal the gland again. Tony drank his fill of the elixir last night, yet the gland looks slightly swollen.
“Bucky, you don’t have to worry about me,” Steve says.  He owes Bucky a ton; his friend has never judged him, always looked out for him in more ways than one. “I’m not interested in Stark.”
He closes his eyes and the light surrounding him flickers and fades. The attackers come at Tony and he doesn’t hold back, he lets the tears flow as he sears the tunnel with flames. No one can stop him, no one does. He launches and screams, screams at his helplessness locked in a tin can, screams at the senselessness of war and destruction, cries at the loss of life, at the loss of something, someone, special.
“Do we need to call code green?” Clint asked as his shoulders tensed, bow at the ready.
“Why is he gone? He gave me no indication that he wasn’t happy with the job, in fact it was the complete opposite. He was invaluable to me.” Tony waits. He hates to put Pepper on the spot. She’s been by his side for years, always taking care of everything he needs, cleaning up his messes, being there when he needed someone.
“Yes.” Steve can’t make assumption what thoughts Tony’s specifically talking about, but this confirms his theory. “The connections must be a little leaky.”
“Steve! Fuck,” Tony said and bent down on one knee in front of Steve as he cracked his eyes open. “Can you walk? God, you’re so pale.”
As he studied the books, Tony realized he needed a map. He asked Jarvis who was able to bring him a National Geographic map of Europe, another of the Middle East, and one of Africa. Ana also placed a leather-bound notebook next to Tony’s elbow.
“Can you walk?” Steve said as he turned his attention to Tony. “I can carry you if you need me-.”
Tony nods and then leaves, not waiting to find out if Steve follows his directions. Instead, he goes to his own room, takes a quick shower, and changes into sweats and a hoodie. Once back downstairs, he notices that Steve has joined him and he’s not sure if that’s good thing or a bad thing. He sets about in the kitchen, finding the cups for hot chocolate and filing the water reservoir for the Keurig. He’s about to place one in the chamber when a hand stops him.
“On our way out. Be there.”
“No sucking up, Luke. Don’t do it,” Steve replies and marches forward as if to his doom.
Steve and Tony explore their relationship in-depth. The team becomes a pack...
“Sheriff Rogers?”
“Seriously, you weren’t worried that it would mutate you or kill you?” Tony scrapes the bottom of the bowl with his spoon, not realizing that he consumed the stew in record time. “This was really good.”
How could he not when Tony was dead, flayed away on the roof of the Triskelion? The vestiges of his voice meant nothing but wishes and lost hopes. In his mind, he saw Tony then, standing in front of him through the white-out pain. Tony reached up with his wounded hands, his chest flayed open, his eyes mere sockets. Those beautiful eyes that never rested with any color – gone. The white lightning came from Tony then. The blaze of light radiated from his wounds, from his undying body, but it didn’t harm. It didn’t hurt Steve. It only warmed him; it only protected him. Like a cloak, it sheathed him against the onslaught, against their torture. He surrendered to it as it bathed him. He succumbed to the white lightning. One word parted his lips.
“If you’re asking me to assist you- I mean I expected as much,” Steve replies.
Her expression softens a degree but still stays hard around the edges as if to prickle and tear at him. “I know, Tony, but it might be time to think about other things. Your ventures, James’ search, and my digging have found nothing about this Captain Rogers other than the fact that if he is alive, he lied to you. There is no evidence whatsoever that Captain America ever had children or had any living relatives in the United States.”
Wong shook his head, his jowls vibrated. “No, no it can’t.”
“I can’t have that bastard in my house. You invited him into the pack. You!” Tony pointed at Steve. “You – this god damned soul pack gave me this fucking gift.” Tony tore at his hair. “I felt her die. I felt the bones in her throat pop and crack.” He gagged and a sob broke free. Steve went to his feet and stepped up to him, but Tony shoved him away. “What do you expect me of? I’m not a damned saint. I can’t forgive him. Never. And you did this to me. You gave me this fucking memory because of this.” He jabbed at the mark on his arm that ran up under his shirt to his chest.
“Oh, the let’s take a walk speech,” Tony had said, chagrin on his face. “What exactly do you want to break to me, Steve?”
“I don’t care what it’s made from – they’re going to shoot you down one day and find out it’s you. The company, what about Stane. You have evidence that he tried to sell weapons to terrorists.”
“Can someone clue me in? Is quantum whatever some kind of nerd orgy?” Logan asks.
“No. No! You’re the Red Knight. Devil of the Realm set to steal all the souls to torture-.” His memory falls back to the Soul Keeper and the Chambers Below – where the Silver Knight is not allowed to attend.
CHAPTER 8
“Yeah, that happens,” Logan says and steps down into the living room. The way he walks down the few stairs teeters on falling but he’s always in control. That much is clear. “He had a seizure or slept for two days once. He’s not well.”
“Yes,” Reynolds said and indicated his colleague. “Tyler can do it.” Tyler only nodded. “But we have to get her in the cold room ASAP. We don’t want whatever effects the serum has on the feeding gland to fade.”
“Bucky, please, please. He didn’t do anything.” He begged and begged – for Tony. He begged.
Before he understood what he was doing, he clasped Tony’s hand and hauled him across the width of the bed. Tony didn’t move for a moment and Steve could have forced his hand, but he didn’t, and Tony shifted and then on his knees walked over the bed to Steve’s side. In for a penny, in for a pound, as his mother used to say to him, Steve lifted the sheet and ignored his own nudity. He invited Tony into the bed.
“Shit,” Tony murmurs, but JARVIS keeps ushering him forward, telling him where to go.
A rumble from the depth of Steve’s throat answers him.
Steve shook his head. “Not really. It’s fantastically hard to find someone to talk to and most soul packs are isolated so you can’t get access them. I did read a lot about it. One of the things that struck me though was the whole Beloved thing.”
Steve stops and nods. He’s never done anything like this for Tony. They never played these types of games, though Tony taught him all of the positions
“Good. Now just relax.” Steve takes a seat at a 45 degree angle from Tony and the sound of his charcoal scratching the paper fills the room. “You can talk if you want. I’ll give you some breaks over the hour it will take me to sketch. I just need to rough it in, you don’t have to sit for the whole process.”
Steven turned around to look at Thor. His chest bare, he only wore his boxer shorts. “Sure, Thor. We’re team mates.”
Tony made a small huffing noise as Natasha only frowned at him.
When he glances over at Tony talking with Friday over his computer interface, Steve realizes he shows no signs of slowing down or resting for even a little while. Steve blames himself, the whole fiasco at the pier. He’d been so happy on the bike and then when they got to the shore, how Tony stood close to him, talked with him. It delighted Steve and that warm feeling he’d been experiencing for days now, deep in the hollow of his chest spread out. Watching Tony so relaxed with himself, so happy had given Steve hope that even if the implant upgrade failed or worse, Tony could be free, could be blissful – with Steve. It was damned selfish. Tony would call it ableist.
Steve hangs his head again and feels the weight of the phantom shield against his shoulders. Maybe it is the hope that someday things will change and right themselves. Maybe it is the fear that they won’t, or maybe, just maybe, he needs to free himself of the bonds of yesterday.
“He wasn’t wearing red.”
He only shook his head. Cooler heads did not prevail, and Tony got his way. The next day, neither Steve nor Tony mentioned that he’d rigged all the vests with what Steve thought amounted to a shock collar for dog training. He didn’t like it and had argued with Tony about it. As Steve fitted his on over his uniform, he frowned. Tony only pressed his finger to Steve’s lips.
Happy nearly bumps into Tony as he stops in the hallway of the busy hospital. “They gave him a private room. Said they were going to bring in a psychologist or something to evaluate him.”
“Yeah, the soul pack has been difficult for him. It’s been growing in leaps and bounds, but now, now he’s accepting each and every one of us. Having Peggy replaced so quickly with Thor, hurt him, but you changed that.”
Without a protest, Bucky turns and clambers his way back to Sam. “Get ready, we’re dropping.”
Tiberius chuckles and walks over the bar. He pours bourbon, and shows the bottle to Steve. He waves off the offer. “Can you believe it? I have to admit, I wanted him when he was a Courtesan. Just thinking of him, wow. I wanted that.”
Their kiss is not one of exploration but of hungry need. As the prince devours him, Tony gasps and tears a little at Steve’s shirt. Thinking quickly, Steve straddles the prince, unbuttons and pulls the tunic over his head. When he tries to do the same with Tony’s shirt, a hand stops him, and a pained look crosses the prince’s face.
“Oh, dear Sheriff, I think we have some work we left unfinished,” Tony says and sinks down on his knees in front of Steve.
Tony flexes his still gauntleted hand. “Time moves differently in here. We’ll need to sleep. We’ll need to eat. It’s all a simulation, but we need to do it. Our avatars need it, just like in a game.” He sits on the bed. “We can’t lose that backpack.”
“We’re his team,” Clint said and Tony swore he witnessed the muscles of Clint’s biceps tense as if he might pull an arrow right now.
Steve braces himself against the door frame, closes his eyes, and nods. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
Sam looks at him with a wary eye, but Steve only tips his hat, thanks Sam for the cover, and leaves. Their two horses trot along with a pack horse to bring extra
“Yeah, yeah, I-he did,” Steve smiles but it isn’t pleasant, only hurt, and colored with melancholy. He shifts the subject. “I got you an extra day off, why don’t you rest?”
“So how does this explain,” Steve started but then couldn’t finish.
The reporter narrated over the video. “Secretary Ross today announced the new treatment that all vampires will be required to undergo. This treatment will help the vampires remain in their natural state as undead, but it will also keep safe the human population.”
“Well, Captain, intercourse with a vampire is necrophilia, now, isn’t it? Vampires are considered dead.” Steve frowned as Pierce continued. The Secretary noticed and remarked. “Dead, undead. It’s still a disease that brings with it a clear and present danger to the human population. I understand that you see things differently since vampires came out of from their hiding places and helped saved the world against Nazis and the like.”
“Is that dinner?” Tony waves at the carcass.
Before he does, the man says, "We need your help."
“I’m not,” Steve said, but he knew that was a lie. He was even lying to himself now. Having Bucky back in his life meant the world to him. He’d made a life in the 21st century, but his roots were long and strong in a distant past. Denying that only led to failure.
“Firepits? That’s medieval.”
Steve shifts in his seat. He's not sure how they ended up discussing and debating religion. He opens his mouth to say something but then realizes he has no defense, nothing to say except for the obvious.
Steve grasped Tony’s shoulders and brought him down for another kiss, disregarding his fangs, letting the fangs scrape against his lips, his tongue. It sent shivers of excitement and need through Tony. He lifted off of Steve slightly and then sat back again, breaking the kiss, the taste of blood. Steve grappled for him, but Tony stopped him, forcing his hands away, gripping his wrists and keeping them hostage against his sides.
“Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’ll bring Bruce along. He could do with a good ride out to the fresh air. He has a little issue with anger and dealing with it. Did you know that he spent time in India, trying to use their strange ways of meditation to calm his nerves. He brought back many herbs and exotic-.”
Steve only hums a little answer and continues twisting the boots and legs together.  “Good.”
“And Hydra, sir.”  Steve found he clenched his hands into fists and forced himself to relax.
“What? Remember something?”
Tony grasps his shoulder. “No, you don’t. Just let me tell you the story of your life.”
“Inside.”
Steve cringes and tries to explain, “When Helen Keller was a little girl the Keller family brought Annie Sullivan to help her, teach her. But she was wild. She’d been blinded and lost her hearing due to illness. By the time she was 4 or so, she wasn’t behaved at all. She would run around the table and grab whatever was on anyone’s plate. Annie stopped all of that. She made the whole family leave the dining room and spent the next few hours stopping Helen and teaching her. Of course, it would take a while until they had the big break through with the water pump.”
“Opera? Wasn’t that distracting?”
His father spent most of his time locked in his den, sodden with alcohol and bitter with defeat.  Defeat against what? Tony had no idea. Probably his demented need to find Captain America. Tony shoved his comic books in the bin to be stored away. He didn’t need to bring such childish things with him to MIT. His college life presented him with a whole new world of possibilities and of freedom. Away from the horrendous resentment and hatred that permeated his home like a mold growing on the walls after a flood, except the flood never receded in his family’s house. Not really. His mother resented his father for his drunkenness, for his abuse, for his long need to find a dead war hero. She spent most of her time away – with her friends on the East Coast or even in Europe. Truly, Tony didn’t know. As a little boy he would toddled after her because she symbolized safety, but even her safety grew weary with melancholy and Tony’s love for his mother failed to drag her out of her haze.
“Maybe,” Steve said and longed to see Tony. He needed him, needed to hold him, to know what they’d built hadn’t been destroyed by what had happened. How could Tony ever forgive him for not explaining what Ross and his lackies did to captured vampires on the rooftop of the Triskelion? He’d never confessed that he’d seen it. The horror of it haunted him; his imagination gave him a clear idea of what had happened to Tony. “Why do the Divini hide?”
“I didn’t have a choice,” Tony said. “You brought me here.” He wanted to be defensive, to attack but hell, he was fairly certain he’d just experienced Steve’s memory of his mother’s death. Trying to keep the profundity of the moment like a flittering butterfly without purchase, Tony added, “You want to tell me why I’m here? Why you’re like that?” Tony gestured to Steve.
His need to get to the distant shore accelerates with each splash of the waves. He knows Tony’s in trouble, his expression, the paleness of his face scares Steve more than he’s willing to admit. As he firms up his grasp of the ropes, he kicks Shield faster, but then he hears a choked, gurgled response from behind as the snow flies in a flurry around them.
Knowing he’s lucky Tony hadn’t decided to interrogate him further, Steve closes the bathroom door, locks it, and quickly disrobes. Normally, he would welcome Tony’s presence in the bathroom. Hell, the blow job Tony gave him in the shower yesterday (was that just yesterday?) sent Steve to the heavens. Right now, Steve craves the pelleting water and the methodical ritual of cleaning. It seems strange, but Steve has always been one of those people who when he had been able to clean up on Brooklyn took those precious minutes and savored them. Bathing was not something someone like Steve got to do very often on Brooklyn with its shortage of water. When he was offered the chance to do, Steve took it very seriously. Like going to Mass.
When the boat docks, a tall, lanky man with multi-colored clothing greets them. “Sir, it’s great to have you back.”
“Why don’t you sit, and I’ll serve you,” Steve says and gestures to the chair.
They left the room and Bruce lingered at the doorway only to slip out as well. Tony stood there, a meter from the bed but his feet felt like lead. Moving through his hesitation robbed him of any courage. Thank fuck that Steve was still out of it. The machines hooked up to him chirped along, showing a strong heartbeat. Yet the pain radiated from him, through the bond as if even in slumber the agony persisted.
“No.” He chuckles. A lot of these people find him amusing and Steve’s not sure if he should be insulted. The big man adds, “No. My name. They call me Happy. You’ll get to know me a lot around here. I do all the boss’ security.”
“Will I?”
Tony reaches up, touches his glasses, and then slips them down his face. He takes his thumb and forefinger to his eyes and pulls away the contacts. After that he tugs off the glimmering jewel at his neck. “I’m not going to hide. People who are not typically abled shouldn’t have to hide or conceal who they are. They shouldn’t have to remain in the shadows or use optical illusions to be accepted. No. Never. I’m not doing it anymore.”
“I’m not sure what that means?” Tony steps back to study Steve.
prince of the Conclave. People respect him out of a sense of obligation, but that doesn’t necessarily transfer to Steve Plus, it won’t do for Tony to be broadcasting the fact he’s keeping the company of an escort. Steve frowns and goes to his closet. He kicks off his drawstring pants and old tunic and then gathers his best clothes.
Tony swallows down the fear. He can’t play this as easily as he thought. But he has the suit and can rocket away at any time he wants. “I’m here to save him.”
“And?”
“Probably because of that,” Tony said and kissed him. “We finally made it.”
“And now, Captain America, you will learn what it means to be my humble and loyal servant.”
On the other hand, they salivate over Steve. He is a mystery to them and they’re over the moon to discover what secrets he conceals. Steve doesn’t speak or respond in any way. They share the same room for the first parts of the examinations, but then the doctors decide they need to admit Steve for further observation and study. Tony’s buttoning up his shirt sleeve cuff (luckily Happy always knows to bring extra clothes for Tony – ever since that one time he ended up on a nude beach with no idea where he clothes disappeared) when he hears it from Happy.
“That’s magnificent,” Tony whispers and his hands shakes as he touches Steve. “I can feel you inside of me. Is that normal?”
“It’s okay.” Steve thinks he should say – it’s my job – but that feels uncaring and heartless and untrue. Instead he says, “He needs it.”
CHAPTER 2 TIME: POST CIVIL WAR
“That was fairly early on. My unit lived and breathed behind enemy lines.”
He should learn. He finished his shower and jumped out. Slinging a towel around his shoulder and another around his waist, Steve went to the bedroom. He dried and put both towels in the laundry bin and then pulled out his boxers and sleeping pants. Settling into bed, he thought about that horrible dinner with Tony. He needed to put it to rest. Regardless of his fantasy life, Tony couldn’t even stand being around Steve long enough to eat a decent dinner. The man left as soon as he found an excuse. It had been Steve’s fault – after all he could barely speak to Tony either. When he met Tony’s gaze, it bored into his soul and read every dirty little secret.
Steven shook his head and opened his hands. “What can I say? I had a lot of attitude as a child.”
“Maybe he got around on the side?” Tony says. Pepper frowns that disapproving wrinkle of her mouth.
Tiberius bends over, hulking over Tony with mass alone. He plants a kiss on Tony’s forehead like he’s a child instead of a lover. Steve nearly shifts away trying to escape, but he notices something, slight and subtle; Tony recoils. The reaction is so miniscule, Steve thinks he might have imagined it, but then Tony locks eyes with him and there’s something quiet and haunting there.
He never really understood how it all happened. He never fucking expected to be saving Steve from a rape or having to defend himself against some metal armed assassin all in one day.
“I-hmm. I forgot to brush my teeth,” Steve says which is the lamest excuse ever.
His armor – that he left in the corner of the hospital entrance as nurses and doctors helped to take Steve away. He needed his armor.His armor had been his cocoon. Pepper had accused him of using it as a distraction to the wider problems he refused to face.  If there was any time in his whole damned life that he longed for the cocoon of the armor, the shelter and solitude of it, then now was it. But the fact that they could invade his privacy even in the armor did not escape him.
“It’ll be dangerous and we’ll be riding hard,” Steve says. The thoughts of going on this hunt with Tony doesn’t quell his nerves, but instead sets them on fire and images of Tony kissing his naked flesh superimpose on his sights. “No, that would be distracting,” he adds in a mutter.
Coulson tilts his head a little and then says, "You are related. Yes, your predescessor, Captain America aka Steve Rogers, was related to you. Yes."
“We have makings,” Steve confirms because of course they do.
Steve steps aside and gestures for Tony to enter. Taking it as a good sign, he accepts and asks Steve to pick up the beer. He does and follows Tony into the apartment. He has Tony deposit the pizza boxes in the kitchen on the small counter. In silence Steve places the six pack next to the boxes. His body language closes up immediately, arms crossed over his chest. He looks good, healthy. He’s gotten a more modern haircut and he’s bulkier.
