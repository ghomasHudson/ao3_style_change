So Dean sets out on his own. But now distance is no issue. Neither is time. Dean’s barely on the road when he finds himself there, at a park bordered on one side by a river. He sees Cas’s small, familiar form on a bench under a tree with branches that reach so high they seem to blend with the sky.
But he hadn’t been acting. How to explain to Balthazar that he trusted Crowley far more than he trusted most angels? That Crowley was an evil little bastard, but not one without some classiness?
“I didn’t—I mean, I don’t. She … reminded me, actually. She also lives in the house with me.”
A flicker of consternation crosses Jack’s face, followed by a moment of realization. “Oh.
“It wasn’t wrong, though. It shouldn’t be this hard.”
hell. “Great,” Dean says, rolling up the flier to stick it in his back pocket. He’ll chuck it later.
“I’m sorry for that, Dean. It’s one of my biggest regrets.”
“A long story.”
“Come again?” Dean said.
“We’ll keep an eye on it,” Sam says, but Dean already feels distant from it. He wants to get back to the important work he was doing.
usually the hopeful one. Not Dean.
of getting him back.”
“I’m glad, Dean.”
Of course Sam has already thought this through. He’s just a more informed and reasonable person.
, they said. So he just tried to comfort Gadreel, whose extreme distress was a result of the suffering inflicted by Abner. Abner, who had once been his best friend. Whom he’d betrayed.
“Why?”
“What do you mean, the way you are?”
Dean seethes about that a little, and then he hates himself for seething. The fact that he harbors this grubby resentment toward Jack is beyond embarrassing—it’s evidence of what a bad person he is. Jack sacrificed everything for him, for Sam, for the world … and Dean just keeps proving how unworthy he is of that sacrifice.
When he gets inside, it’s clear that it’s even vaster than it appeared—that it may continue inward and onward for several miles, rooms upon rooms of books and manuscripts. But right in front of him is a huge reading room—wooden tables furnished with gentle lighting. A few people are there, some bent over old books or manuscripts, a couple others clustered together.
completely
He and Federico strike up a conversation. It’s probably the most boring conversation in the history of the multiverse.
Plus, Sam’s been on the horn to Men of Letters Hong Kong, Men of Letters Singapore, and Men of Letters Thailand. They see no evidence of supernatural tampering.
“Don’t mention it.” Dean lingered there for a moment, wondering if he should say anything else. His apology prayer to Cas had covered some ground, but not nearly enough.
“We’ll see each other again. Just … trust me on that one.”
He obliges. He could do with a shower anyway—he’s pretty gross. Once he does that, he puts on a robe and goes into the kitchen to make himself coffee. Streams a live broadcast from CNN. That guy’s who’s the main doctor is giving another press conference. Do these people do anything other than talk? If they spent half the time
Cas smiled. “It’s okay. I was a dick. And even when I wasn't trying to be, there were a lot of times I
So Cas keeps the details to himself. And he instructs his angel friends to do the same, whenever they’re in Dean’s presence. (They still can’t help but look in on a Winchester from time to time.) But in his own mind, he begins to make a list, and from this list, a narrative takes shape.
He says, “Ambriel, my feelings for Dean Winchester notwithstanding, he’s a human being.”
When he opens his eyes again, Cas is still with him. “You didn’t have to say it, Dean. But you did.”
Somewhere in the house, someone starts playing music.
“I don’t need you to babysit,” Dean said. “You don’t have to worry about me being around sharp objects. Or fucking tiptoe around me all day.”
Maybe she’s on a fishing expedition; maybe she isn’t. In either case, he just doesn’t care anymore. Doesn’t care what angels think of him.
“I’m talking about research. The way you used to do things. The thing you’re very, very good at.”
Dean’s mood craters.
“What happened with you, with Jimmy Novak, with Claire … it’s not the same thing. As me and Sammy losing our mom. It just isn’t.”
He continues. “I imagined happiness as this watershed moment, some perfect moment between me and you that I’d never be brave enough to initiate.” He touches Dean’s face. “But that’s not what the Empty promised. I misunderstood. It said it wouldn’t take me until I gave myself permission to be happy. That day, in the bunker, with you and Billie? I understood. I finally understood.”
Dean kept his hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Yeah, the reason matters. Averting the apocalypse mattered. It might not matter to her right now, but it will. I know this. Trust me. If me and Sam had that kind of knowledge about our mom—if we’d known she’d given up her body to a being that saved a lot of people? Well.” Now he
Cas squeezed his shoulder. “No, you can’t. And I’m so sorry.”
Cas was silent. Then: “Don’t joke about things like that.”
. And Dean, always the pessimist, points this out.
“Dean, it’s me. Castiel. Open up.”
Cas’s face tensed. “I don’t know about that, Dean. It had the same effect on her. At the end of the day, does the reason really matter? I took her father from her. He’d be alive if it weren’t for me. She’d have a family.”
“Cas,” he gasps. “Cas!”
On the radio, “If I Ever Leave This World Alive” was playing.
He’s not going back to Kansas. At least not for a long time.
But there’s another thing, too. A bigger thing that goes beyond Cas's "true purpose," whatever that is.
Cas doesn’t want to be having this conversation anymore. “How are Sam and Dean?”
The rest of the evening unfolded predictably. Claire didn’t end up getting in a fight with Jody—instead it was Alex, who for some reason wanted to go for a run even though it was dark outside. “It’s not safe,” Jody said. “It’s Sioux Falls!” Alex replied. And Jody said, “You have to stop this unhealthy obsession with your weight.” And Alex said, “My desire to exercise is anything but unhealthy!”
Dean doesn’t look away.
in ten. You in?”
“A lot of others played a role, Castiel. A role they still won’t admit to. But you’re different in that you tried to set things right.”
As he flipped through them, Cas’s lips turned upward. “I see a resemblance.”
“That Sam deserves more time. More time with her than you do.”
“So, Jack really isn’t coming back?” Kaia asked, and her voice was low and hesitant. Sam gave his spiel about how Jack is always with them, and Kaia just looked down at her plate. Next to her, Claire rolled her eyes.
. I’m going to visit him today, to welcome him officially. I’ll tell him you’re on your way.”
Things taper off and they curl up in Dean’s bed, tangled in the damp sheets.
“Perhaps something’s wrong with me.”
“Thanks, Cas. You should too.” He patted Cas on the shoulder—the kind of “bro touch” that comprised most of their physical interaction. “You know Cas—”
“But you do need to say goodbye to Sam,” he says. “And then, before you head home, I need you to do one more thing.” He makes his last request.
After they left rehab, he and Hannah kept in touch. And she started coming by the fratway house often.
something. He appreciates the fratway house for the way it allows angels to just be.
Dean scrunched up the peeled-off label in his palm. Trying to distract himself from the tears gathering at the corners of his eyes.
“Good.” Dean kisses his temple, his cheeks, his chin. In a few minutes they’re fast asleep.
“I—I’m not talking about that, Dean.” She sounded evermore impatient. “It goes—it goes beyond … It’s like.” She fixed herself on him. “Have you ever seen those documentaries about people calling their families from crashing planes? Or like, the Twin Towers, or whatever?”
“The one with the face,” Ambriel answers.
And with that, Dean started to cry.
His feelings—they hadn’t exactly been sexual. Not
“Why us?”
Now Cas kept looking at the pictures, smiling as though he were carrying around the secret memory of something good. “Mothers,” he said, as though to himself. “They’re just so … crucial.” He held the picture of Mary with Dean, running his fingertip along the edge. “We angels, we just don’t understand.”
Dean takes it. “Who—”
“It’s why he hasn’t—” He puts his hands in his pockets. “We get the heaven we deserve, right? And I don’t deserve Cas.”
“No shit! It’s heaven, Anna dear. Which is like a movie but with better lighting.”
Sam knows these canned statements are all part of Dean’s bullshit act. He’s not over Cas. He hasn’t moved past his guilt about the way he treated Jack. But after a long winter of grieving—of sleeping for days on end and eating nothing but Campbell’s Chicken & Stars—he seems to be ready to put on a brave face. To pretend he’s over everything.
he did such a thing, except that it was his job.
“He really had nothing, Cas. I mean,
“You’re a good man, Dean. I just wish you could see that.” She pauses. “What he said—it wasn’t wrong. You seem to think the worst of yourself …. Well, I just wish I’d been there.”
When he wakes, it’s dark and quiet, and the only thing he knows for sure is that Jack is nearby.
“Maybe not,” he says. He explains that he’s not sure that the thing they call “sleep” is actually real sleep or just some form of relaxation. But whatever it is, it’s deeply restorative.
“When’s the last time I looked at a bird, Cas?”
That night, when Sam is in the bathroom getting ready for bed and Dean is watching basketball on TV, he notices some pill bottles on the desk. Picks them up. They’re both prescribed to Sam. One is an antidepressant—Dean recognizes the name from one of those commercials—and the other one is Zolpidem.
Dean just smiles and leans over to kiss him. He wraps his arms around Dean and Dean rolls him onto his back. They share a kiss that lasts for minutes.
Cas was changing. Had changed.
“No, I just—” He definitely doesn’t want to slow down. “I want to. But I’m—” He clears his throat. “I’m unpracticed. I don’t have a lot of, you know, knowledge. Experience.”
When Cas first met Dean, he was shocked that Dean didn’t defer to him, or to the authority he represented. Other humans he’d known—well, once they saw his wings, they were terrified. Or worshipful of the God they thought he spoke for.
It doesn’t take him long to store his belongings, put the books back where they belong, and pack his things. Just after dusk—on “the blue side of evening,” as Steve Earle put it—he coaxes Miracle into the car. They drive.
Dean looked up at the ceiling again, but this time he rolled his eyes. “I just explained this, Cas. Sam was a baby. I wasn’t.”
“The Empty was the worst enemy Cas has ever faced … and you know his record. Angels aren’t physical beings—they’re energy. Pure energy. And the Empty works by psychically assaulting beings made of energy, converting them to nothing.” Jack pauses. “Or I should say, it
“C’mon, Cas,” Dean said. “You’re not planning to sit here all night, are you?”
Cas did agree with Anna on one thing, though—she really didn’t deserve to be locked up with them. And it was that detail that got him thinking. “How do we know this is the ‘snitch ward’?” he asked. “That we’re the most hated of our species?”
“You were just … so
“I just work here. Eliah runs the place.” He looks at Dean. Suppresses a smile. “I’ll get you a good booth.”
. Only one person.
“No, thank you.”
He retreats to his room. Closes the door over and thinks about Dean.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Cas said, sliding into the chair next to him. “Human beings have near-unlimited memory. You’re capable of knowing almost as much as angels.” He shook his head and looked up at the ceiling. “Literacy was the worst thing you did to yourselves. When you write things down, you give yourself permission to forget them.”
“Maybe you’re right.” She went back to her gun.
“She comes here most afternoons to sift through the archives. She’s one of the scholars.” He motions to the spacious reading room. “Here you can find the answers to all the questions you’ve thought about your whole life. What is the meaning of it all, why are ears shaped like that, is love at first sight really real. And other things. Or not. A lot of people still like to argue about things, so if you’re into that …”
Or maybe Dean was just projecting.
“Bullshit it’s not real,” Bartholomew said. “Tell that to my throat, which gets cut out every night.”
So, yeah. Maybe it would be better to get some wretched viral pneumonia and kick off. He wouldn’t have to think about Jack or Cas anymore, at least. If he gets to go to heaven—big fucking if—he’ll just relive his best memories. Again and again. In a way, maybe it’s not so different from the Empty, or from any other outcome. He won’t be reunited with the people he lost—not Cas or Mom or Dad or Jack or Bobby. Not in any real sense.
Then, in English:
“Just a park.” He pauses. “But there’s a degree of cover here, from other people and angels. It’s more …”
, she says.
Cas stares at Gabriel. Something’s different about him. He couldn’t put his finger on it at first, but now—
Sam wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. “You weren’t bad either.”
“When I made my deal with the Empty, it told me it wouldn’t take me until I was happy. For a long time I misunderstood this—I believed that being in a state of true happiness would kill me. I also believed that happiness had to be achieved. I overlooked the operative word.
out.”
Dean can’t look at his mother because he knows that she, also, is sad. He can feel this. He’s looking down at his hands, his vision blurring with tears, and Mary takes both of his hands in hers.
He wants to go into Cas’s room and look at the book about birds, which he’s already looked at so many goddamn times. He puts both feet on the floor and gets ready to stand. Laughs quietly. “Gotta hand it to Jack, though. He’s having a bang-up first year as God. I know paradise on earth was a tall order, but wow, way to take things tits up, especially this early in the game.”
The iPod hadn’t really been Cas’s. It had been Sam’s, wiped clean of old songs and given to Cas as a gift a few years ago. “I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with this,” Cas said. He said it was a peculiar device.
“Oh trust me, Mal, you’re exactly—”
Dean’s handwriting. A lot of it. He has to read only the first few lines to know: this is Dean’s journal. Going by the dates, it’s a journal he started last fall.
all cued up and ready to go. You in?”
They do boring things like crunch numbers, run statistics and figure out how many human souls have crossed over and how many are still in the veil, and where they should put them all.
Dean makes a noise that sounds half sob, half chuckle. Then he laughs some more. Cas is relieved. Relieved that the moment isn’t so fragile anymore.
?” Sam asked one night a couple weeks ago, as they drove home after a grocery run. “With Cas and the Empty?”
he can come back and tell us all about it, spoiler alerts or not. Me especially. As a token of gratitude. And I’ll get to write a book about it.”
Dean looks up. Now he’s interested. “New outbreak? Croatoan?” He pulls up another screen and starts googling.
“And you’re being fucking avoidant, as usual.”
Jack is quiet for a long time. Thinking. Then he looks at Dean. “I don’t know if I have an answer, Dean. I mean—when we redid this place, and I asked people what they wanted, they said they wanted choices on what to do in the afterlife. So I decided to try making heaven a place where humanity could just be. To explore. To have second chances. It could be that … I don’t know. You died very suddenly. You died at a young age. Maybe you weren’t quite ready to see me?”
He’s glad his mom is in the living room, sitting in the window seat, reading a book. He needs to talk with her. He also knows that, like him, his mother isn’t one for small-talk or niceties or an offer of tea and cookies. So after they hug hello, he just cuts right to it: “I’m a dick. I mean, I was a dick. When I was alive.”
A little bit later, Cas gets up and Dean gets up with him. He throws on some clothes. And then he does something he’s always wanted to do—he helps Cas get dressed. Puts his suit jacket on him, fixes his tie.
Dean doesn’t say anything for a long time. His lips graze Cas’s cheek. “You sure do get around, Cas.”
He’s not in the backyard with Ambriel for a minute before she gets right to the point: “Are you still in love with Dean Winchester?”
“Hah.”
“Reapers, man. They’re brutal. But don’t dwell on that. That’s past stuff. I don’t care, Cas.” He shakes his head slightly. “And besides, I don’t have—I mean, this is new to me, too.”
And there are still monsters, too. Not the really bad stuff. More like ordinary ho-hum beasties. They’re back to being pest control again. One weekend it’s an Ohio Grassman. The next weekend it’s a run-of-the-mill haunted house. Eileen comes along that time.
“Why don’t you sit with us?” Cas says.
“Dean. What exactly
Cas is crying again, but this time his tears have a degree of catharsis, not pure anguish. He reaches over to clutch Jack’s other hand, which is on his shoulder.
Sam understands his brother better than any human being on earth—and any human being
But no Led Zep. None of Dean’s top traxx had rubbed off on Cas. He probably hadn’t even listened to the mix tape all the way through.
. If the God Castiel represented did indeed exist, then he was a very indifferent God.
“I know, it bites it. But actually …” He produces another flier. “We really do have Enochian classes here. You can come either Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesdays and Thursdays. Daniel teaches Mondays and Wednesdays, and Adina teaches Tuesdays and Thursdays.” He lowers his voice. “Between you and me, people like Daniel more, but Adina’s the better teacher.”
“He wanted to be here right now, and he’s coming to see you shortly,” Jack explains. (Either he can read Dean’s mind, Dean thinks, or Dean’s thought-patterns are just super predictable. Probably the second thing.) “He’ll be here soon, but—”
“Go to hell, Dean.”
“It’s all right. Look, Cas.” Jack shifts a little, angling himself toward Cas. “I know this transition has been hard for you. It’s been hard for me, too, I won’t lie. Things all happened very fast. For
He can feel Jack smile. “Sam will be fine. Just—trust me on that one. But I’m thinking about you. What do
Cas stepped aside to face off with Malachi and Bartholomew, who remained impassive. “You two.”
That all changed the day Dean and Cas got back from Purgatory. After finishing his drink, Dean walked Cas to his room.
“Stop. Just stop. Between you and Cas, I just—” He studies Dean’s face. “Cas is fine. I know that’s what you’ve been wanting to ask me since you first saw me but couldn’t bring yourself to, because you were scared of the answer.”
“This place is incredible, Jack,” he says. He thinks about making some crack about bringing down the properly values.
Finally, when Dean’s breathing starts to flatten, Cas begins again. “Angels aren’t happy beings, Dean. We just aren’t. We’re not built for it. The word ‘happiness’ barely exists in Enochian. It’s not something that enters into our day-to-day reality. We don’t exist to be happy—we exist to serve. To serve God, to serve humanity. To carry out orders. To go where we’re told, when we’re told. Not to yearn for some kind of fulfillment. Whatever you want to call it. We don’t have that. We don’t even have a word for leisure.”
“I was already happy, Dean,” Cas continues, “just to be part of your life. We were a family. You, me, Sam. We had a child together.” He pauses. “I was pretty much the happiest angel in the history of creation. All I had to do was accept that. And tell you who you really are, and how you did that for me.”
She steps back. “I’m sorry, but what?”
He realizes Cas is crying.
Several minutes from now, he'll help his brother out of the car and guide him back inside, back into the bunker. He'll take Dean to his room and put him to bed there, removing his shoes and covering him with a blanket, pretending that he's the strong one here, that he can help Dean through this trial that has no end, this time that's unbound by the length of ordinary human days.
No one ever listened—
“Hey, do me a favor, Cas,” Dean said. “Play this song at my funeral.”
Sam and Dean opted not to stay the night, getting in the car that evening and driving the five hours back to Kansas. They didn’t get home until two in the morning.
He has so many spreadsheets.
Bartholomew looked at Crowley. “What if he’s the one who wakes up? Then we’re all fucked. He gets away and skips back home to his mom and leaves the rest of us to rot.”
But there was no setting things right.
Crowley registered similar sentiments every day, with varying degrees of vehemence, but when it came to this pointless fighting, Cas and Crowley were indeed on the same side.
He swallows. Looks straight at his brother and nods. “Yes.”
“You’re always saying you want to read more. Now you have an excuse to buy a couple books. Oh, and.” He slides another envelope across the table.
“Cas.” Balthazar looks down at him, his eyes soft and transparent. He takes a step toward him.
Dean pulled up his knees and set his elbows against them and cried into his hands. He cried for a while. Cas sat there with him, on the cold floor, and kept his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
He couldn’t say any of this to Hannah. He’s not quite sure she’d understand. And perhaps that’s the problem—no one understands. No one but Jack, and he’s busy.
“Damn.”
But before he can do that, while they're still in the car, Sam reaches over to retrieve his brother from the corner of the backseat. He pulls Dean close, wrapping his arms around his shaking shoulders, resting his chin on Dean’s head. Trying to absorb the sadness the best he can, while knowing that this kind of grief can never be contained.
, Cas said.
He watches as a small russet leaf falls from the tree above and lands near his shoe. He clears his throat and looks at Jack. “How do you say, ‘I’m proud of you’ in Enochian?”
“Have you tried praying to him?”
“Dean,” someone says loudly. A different voice. A deep voice. A familiar voice.
Dean thinks about saying something mean, but he stops himself. Sighs. “Look. Maybe you’re right. Maybe this is a big deal. But you and me? It’s not ours to worry about. We’re low risk. We’re healthy … somewhat.” He holds up his beer. “We live in the middle of nowhere. And—oh yeah. We’ve done a bunch of things like beat the devil and kill Hitler and—what was the other thing? God. We beat God. We’re not dying of a cold.” He waits a beat. “And if we do? Oh well. Maybe this really is our species’ mass extinction event. If Jack’s wiping the slate clean, I’m sure he has his reasons.”
Cas squeezes his eyes shut, trying to slow the inevitability of tears.
His mother was so diligent about cleaning her gun, so particular. That must be where Sam got his anal retentiveness. Of course, Sam preferred to use the reading room for
The 9/11 widow got to go to her husband. But Sam isn’t a widow, he’s an orphan. And when orphans outlive their parents, they often live for a long-ass time.
Metatron busies himself in the house’s small library, getting irritated when others play loud music. But too fucking bad—they all love music. And pool. They have a pool table, which Benjamin commandeers to the point that they have to distract him to take his cue just so someone else can play.
Dean shrugs. “Or next week. Maybe we can make a regular appointment. Like a hairdresser.”
In the closet, Dean discovered a fishing rod and some tackle. In the nightstand’s upper drawer, he found a photograph of Jack, not framed or preserved. Tucked away face down—probably put that way after the incident with Belphegor, Dean guessed—as though Cas couldn’t bear to be reminded of the son he loved so much. And in the bottom drawer, Dean found an old tape player. By looking through the little window, he could see what it was—
Initially it made sense: bedrooms were used for sleep, and Cas didn’t sleep. They were also used as a place to keep your belongings, and Cas didn’t have any. As for personal space? Angels didn’t really grasp the concept.
“You were right, though.”
“All right,” Dean said, putting his hand down to push himself from the floor. Cas got up and reached out to help Dean stand, but Dean shrugged off the offer. “I’m okay.” He bent over to gather the beer bottles for the recycling bin. Cas picked up the small stack of photographs.
Cas studies him, intent on processing all of this as Dean is feeling it.
When Dean drives Baby back into town, he’s a bit flummoxed. This is the clearly the same small city he saw when he arrived in heaven—where he had his unfortunate run-in with Jimmy Novak and was told he was tanking the neighborhood—but now it seems to have developed into a much larger metropolitan area. The park has more than quadrupled in size; its people sprawl out on blankets, play frisbee in the grass with their dogs. The center of the city stretches for miles in all directions, buildings and streets and sidewalks and trees.
Dean takes his hand away.
Dean takes several deep breaths and attempts to begin again, outlining the circumstances surrounding her death, the fight he had with Cas, and Cas’s departure from the bunker. “We—we made up. Sort of. We were in purgatory together, and …”
“Insufferable? Moralizing? Pedantic?”
For all the ways life had been cruel to him, it had also been kind. He didn’t understand quite how kind until after Cas was dead, and then dead, and nothing could bring him back. How to accept everything was over? It hadn’t even begun. He left his door unlocked every night, even though locks rarely posed a challenge to Cas to begin with. He prayed. The nights grew longer, and then they grew shorter. But in the bunker, underground, time remained the same. And Cas never came back.
“The whole time I was with you,” Cas says, “I didn’t realize how happy you made me. Because it just wasn’t even … it’s like, I loved you, and I wanted nothing more than to be around you and Sam. But we always had work to do. So I didn’t think about happiness at all—or whether someone like me could even
Cas never participated. He was always trying to tend to Gadreel, whose suffering was particularly acute. Gadreel’s ordeal seemed to last longer than everyone else’s—after he’d been disemboweled each night, he got put back together slowly. Was nearly catatonic.
Some minutes later—Dean wasn’t sure how much time passed—he collected himself, wiped his eyes and nose with the back of his sleeve, and sat upright again. Calmed his breathing.
“I wasn’t there when you lost a baseball game or had a mean teacher or got mixed up with a bully. I wasn’t there to help you through your first broken heart. I wasn’t there to tell you that the world sucks and that the bad things that happen to you aren’t necessarily your fault. I’m sad about that, Dean. You needed a mother.” She pauses. “You
He reaches for his phone and pulls up the dating app. He thinks about making up some excuse.
we want in this particular veil, and that’s the point.”
“Oh yeah, I loved going to that class. Right up there with spelling and home-ec.”
. “I played a role in depopulating heaven of its angels in the first place.”
Dean stiffens a little, looks down. Cas regrets bringing it up—reminding Dean of the obvious wrinkle in the course of events, the twist that’s always been there. Human relationship dynamics aren’t intuitive to him, but he knows enough to understand that Dean’s identity has always been wedded to intense ideas about masculinity.
“They don’t feel guilt,” Anna said. “They’re not capable. I can’t vouch for your demon pal, but those two are stone cold killers.”
“He came to me too. Can I …?” He gestures to the seat. Dean says nothing, so he climbs into the backseat and closes the door behind him.
“That’s not much of an excuse, Sam. And it doesn’t explain how I treated him the rest of the time.” He traipses over to sit on a log that overlooks the pond. Sam follows him and sits down next to him. “But that’s nothing you should blame yourself for. I made choices, Sam. You’re not at fault for how I treated Jack. So please don’t blame yourself.
“Jack.”
Now that Sam’s mentioned it, Dean realizes how much he was dreading the possibility of doing that again. It’ll be a relief, not to go to Jody’s for Christmas.
“Yes, it’s me, Sam.”
Gabriel smiles mildly. “It’ll be okay, Cas.”
“There’s got to be software,” she says. “You could probably figure it out on your own.”
said. But—yeah, Dean. I know. Of course I know.”
“Who was meant to be a hunter. That was who he was, Sam. Dyed in the wool. And hunters don’t live long lives. You know this.” He reaches over and touches Sam’s shoulder. “But it’s not who you are.”
He pushes the door open to find Jack sitting on the bed. Jack rises to his feet as soon as he sees Cas. He doesn’t look happy.
“Deaf people
Sam knows better than to try to gather the pieces. He needs to find Dean. Figuring Dean's driven off somewhere, he goes to check the garage. Dean’s car is still there. He hasn’t gone far. On a hunch, Sam looks through the Impala’s windows. Sure enough, Dean is in the backseat, slumped in the corner. Sam opens the door and bends over to look inside.
Gabriel puts both his hands on his shoulders, turns him around and enfolds him in a warm hug. “It’s okay,” he says, even though he can’t possibly know that because he doesn’t know what “it” is. And frankly, neither does Cas. “It’s okay, bro.”
He cast a glance at her. “I—I have no idea, Hannah. Why are you asking?”
Dean wiped his face and his nose, pocketed the iPod, and dragged himself back inside.
You certainly didn’t go tooling around in your uniform in your off hours. As a teenager, Dean would have died an unholy death before he let any girl in town catch a glimpse of him in his Burger King shirt.
In a memory so vivid it hurts, Dean is sitting on the kitchen floor drinking beer. (His fourth? Fifth?) His pictures are in his lap—photographs of Mom and Dad, of Mom and him as a toddler, of Mom and him and Sammy. Poor Sammy: there were so few pictures of him and Mom. And really, if Dean’s being honest, so few pictures of Sammy at all, period. Dad wasn’t exactly a “Kodak dad.” No way. It was just another way they weren’t normal. Throughout the years, he’d been in and out of enough normal people’s houses to see how normal people did things—how they documented the details of their children’s lives. How they kept photos of
of it. And figure out how to wake up. Once we’re awake, the Empty begins to lose its grip on us. It can’t keep us here. I’ve seen it happen before.”
But no, Dean doesn’t believe that. Jack wouldn’t do him dirty like that—not the same infinitely patient and forgiving Jack who’s created a heaven more beautiful than anything Dean deserves. Who’s given him back his parents and Bobby. Jack is not one to do tests or trials—he’s honest to a fault. He’s the son Dean never deserved but got anyway.
He thinks of Hannah’s arm around him, her kiss on his cheek.
But part of it quickly becomes a haven for a small clutch of angels who love humanity. Who enjoyed the human world and miss their time there.
Who knows how long they stay like that.
He knows he should save Dean’s journal, reading it slowly to savor the only thing he has left of his brother—but he can’t. He can’t stop gorging himself on Dean’s words, on this modest, raw, personal record he kept of the last six months of his life. He tucks himself into a corner on the floor next to the washing machine and keeps reading.
“He’s coming along,” his nurse says in Enochian. “But he’s still critical. Of all the beings brought back from the Empty?”
He senses a presence in the doorway of his room. He opens one of his many eyes. Then closes it. “Metatron. What are you doing here?”
“Can I help you?” someone asks. A male voice.
“Sammy’s gonna be fine. That I’m sure of, zero doubts on my end. Also, I’m not gonna burn Jack’s relationship with the reapers. Might make Christmas dinners a bit awkward.” He chuckles. “Beyond all that, though—I don’t know, Cas. I guess heaven agrees with Winchesters. I’ve never seen my parents so mellow and I—I don’t feel angry anymore.”
“May 18
“Do you want me to take you back to your friends now?”
Malachi turned away. Then he turned back and shoved Bartholomew against the wall. “What did you turn me into? I don’t know who the hell I am. Who I was supposed to be!”
The zoo decorations are what you’d expect—or what Sam would expect, anyway. He’s never been into holiday displays or Christmas cheer. Or even zoos. Zoos just remind him that all the wild animals are dying as they speak, going extinct due to deforestation and poaching and droughts and all else. The giraffes. The lions. The last Sumatran rhino in the wild died last year. Asian tigers are pretty much gone. Polar bears are losing their icebergs, falling straight into the Atlantic with nothing to hold onto.
“Gee, thanks for the spoiler alert, Cas,” Gabriel says.
“The same way you thought of the Winchesters?”
He says, “I’m sure Dean Winchester will have other things to do. Once he gets here.”
He leads Dean to a strand near the edge of town. There you can look out on a large body water; there are boats. A couple people surfing. Dean says he likes this—having lived most of his life in a landlocked state, he appreciates the water.
Without thinking, Cas tries to push himself to his feet. “Balthazar,” he says—or that’s what he
Cas didn’t take his hand away from the wall. “He made a stupid mistake thousands of years ago. Which he paid for, times ten. And then he fell in with Metatron, made some shitty decisions. But he made up for them in the end.” He paused. “He blew himself up just to save me. And Hannah. And to free everyone else from Metatron. And Metatron—” He turned to look at Metatron. “You had your moments, Metatron. A lot of moments. But in the end you stepped up and sacrificed yourself, just like Gadreel.”
Even if Sam were inclined to take Dean at his word—and he’s not, especially when it comes to shit like Cas—he knows he’s lying. He knows because of the things Jack told him.
Daniel sticks his head out of the living room. “We’ve got
Dean just stands there. So Dad
“Don’t give me some line about how it’s meant to be.”
Sam spends time with Eileen.
Sam falls asleep in Dean’s room that night. Again. And sleeps for hours. When he wakes up, it’s dark and cold and Miracle is nowhere to be found. Poor fucking dog. He didn’t sign up for this.
He doesn’t say anything about this—obviously. Especially not as Dean and Eileen seem to be enjoying themselves, stopping to check out the primates.
Dean feels the sting of impending loss. “I know.”
Dean wanders from shelf to shelf for about fifteen minutes. He takes a shot at the computers. He doesn’t turn up much about Cas. In one reference book, he sees his name in the index. He turns to the page and reads
Now Sam does roll his eyes. Hands in his pockets, he slumps against the molding at the mouth of the alcove. “I’m here because I want to be.”
“All the same, I can’t imagine the willpower it took for you to escape, and then to help everyone else escape. But Cas.” Jack looks right at him, and his eyes are soft. “You have to forgive yourself.”
Cas didn’t say anything as he continued to flip through the pictures. Even though he’d already flipped through them at least once. Maybe twice.
“Where do you think, Dean. My doctor.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, his voice little more than a whisper. He picked up an empty beer bottle and started peeling back the label. “That’s why I’m glad for—I mean, I’m so happy for Sam. He never had Mom at all, Cas. Never. I have memories of Mom. A few. Good ones. But Sam … he was an infant. He has what I told him, what Dad told him. I remember him saying to me one time—”
“Cas,” he says, moving from behind the podium. His face lights up; he smiles broadly. Cas doesn’t remember seeing him smile before. Not like that, like someone purely happy.
this was a song Cas liked—it had Cas’s favorite ingredients: bluebirds and lullabies and dreams and wishing upon stars: all the cloying sentimentality you could possibly shove into two verses. Except this version? This version by Israel Unpronounceable Last Name? Was devastating. Like a list of last wishes, or a pretty lie you’d tell a child who’s been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
“Oh.” Questions collide in his head.
“Happy birthday, Dean.”
ask—the crucial question. “Have you seen Cas?”
Dean continues. “I thought you guys were, I don’t know. Good together.” He looks down at the pie as though making an important decision. “Compatible.”
She sighed and sat back on the bench. “I’m sorry. I’m just—I’m terrible at communicating with you, Castiel. It’s never been my strong suit. I have trouble with metaphors.”
Cas lets go of his hand.
They have so many files. Rooms of boxes stacked to the ceiling. Filing cabinets in every room, including the bathroom. And that’s just from the Men of Letters. There’s also the vast archive they themselves have generated throughout the years—the notepads and clippings and crude drawings that make John Winchester’s journal look laconic in comparison. Sam’s been putting things in spreadsheets for years, saving them to an encrypted folder on his laptop, but there’s still no system of organization, so whenever they need information, they have to know already where it’s stored.
It’s the first thing the Empty ripped out of him when he arrived at his destination. The other inmates took care of the rest, shredding all six of his wings and pulling out his eyes. Since he’s been back heaven-side, he’s been busy regrowing his heart and eyes while other angels work on his wings, fitting them back together while he rests in some kind of suspended apparatus.
“He’s better off down here with us.”
. He thinks about this when he takes Miracle on walks in the fields behind the bunker. He figures there are signs, tons of signs all around him. He almost doesn’t want to count, because knowing Cas and Jack, there are so many. Bees, flowers, trees. Goddamn butterflies. The good things. Where to even begin.
“I don’t know that, Dean. But please. Please don’t be in a hurry.”
“He’s more than just that, Jack.”
Cas kisses his forehead.
“So there’s a chance,” Sam says.
Ten minutes later, she texts him again:
“When Cas died? It wasn’t a lot of fun, Mom. It was like
“Not in my dream. The day after Cas … We were in the car. He—he told me about Cas’s deal. And he apologized for keeping it from us.”
Still sitting on Dean’s bed, Sam looks away from the pages. The dog’s head is in his lap, looking up at him plaintively. Because he’s crying. He wipes his eyes and nose with the back of his sleeve and gets up from the bed. Leaves Dean’s bedroom and goes down the hall. He’s got laundry to do.
“What?”
check out the rec room. Just to get his mind off things. He hadn’t expected his memories to return like this, and he doesn’t want to be alone with his thoughts, thoughts of betrayal and—
He still can’t tell Sam what Sam has undoubtedly guessed:
“I used to wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t come to Hannah’s defense. If I’d let Daniel kill Hannah and then let them both go.” He knows he probably would have died soon after—it was Adina’s grace that restored him until he could locate his own. “I don’t wonder about things like that anymore.” A tear slips down his cheek. He wipes it away quickly.
“It’s possible,” Cas said, shutting the door behind them. “Samandriel is partial to cats. He talked about getting one.”
“Both.” Cas walks over and sits so he’s next to Sam. “It is both real and a dream. I’m not alive anymore in the way that you knew me to be alive. I’m back to being a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent, which means I cannot manifest physically in your waking dimension. Which is really the way it should be.” He sighs. “I learned much from humanity in ways that helped me improve heaven. But I also learned that angels shouldn’t meddle so much. Even though you’re all magnificent creatures, and I miss being among you.”
“I—I’m sorry. I should have told you that sleeping pills can have side-effects.”
Cas withdrew his hand from Dean’s arm. He gathered the photographs in his hand and set the small stack aside ever so gently. “I’ll be the first to admit: I don’t know a thing about this—this family shit. But if I’ve learned anything over the past few years—from you and Sam—it’s that family shit is …
He looked up, puzzled. “Careful? Mom, Cas is a brother to us. We trust him with our lives.”
.” Jack looks at him more closely. “You’re tired.”
Cas shook his head, reaching out to touch the pitch-black wall of their cell. “No.” He turned around. “Anna’s right. She doesn’t deserve to be here.”
Cas isn’t so sure. What is he now, if not broken? He can’t even think. Can’t remember.
“Is that why you’re drinking here? On the floor?” Cas said.
“That wasn’t the right thing, Cas. I should have told them you were back from the Empty. It was cruel not to.”
Dean looks at him quizzically. “Eileen … can’t hear.”
“No, I don’t mean—” She tucks a wisp of hair behind her ear. “Yes, I wish I could have been there for you after Cas’s death, Dean. But I’m talking before that. I wish I could have been there earlier. Years earlier. I missed so much, with you two boys. I missed the opportunity to build you up. The world is a terrible place. It tears you down. So much. But mothers are supposed to counteract that, Dean. And I didn’t. I wasn’t there.”
He still isn’t strong enough to look in on them, to be able to monitor what they’re doing. Whatever the Empty did to him—well, it was deep. Penetrating. Enervating. Not something he can just get over. “It inflicted psychic damage,” Jack told him, last time they met. “The only cure for that is time and rest.”
Dean realizes that he has no friends. For a guy over 40, he’s racked up few meaningful connections through the years. Part of it was moving around a lot as a kid. Part of it was the job. And part of it is the fact that his friends tend to die off.
“It’s like I didn’t know what we were missing until I saw this. And with so many of us back from the Empty, heaven’s stronger than it’s been in centuries. We can incorporate so many souls.” She turned to look at Cas. “And that’s thanks to you.”
In minutes, the app lights up.
“Most of our sessions were conducted remotely. I’d be willing to do the same thing for you. Whatever you need. I wouldn’t charge, of course. I want to make that clear. I’m not an ambulance chaser. I cared about Dean. He was a wonderful man. I’d be honored to help you through this in any way I can.”
“I agree.” A hunger pang. He’s felt hungry only a few times in his long life. “Maybe it’s because you mentioned apples earlier. Are you hungry?”
go see Dean. He’s here. We were friends.”
All the same, Sam and Dean’s presence seemed to bring tensions to the surface.
“Something like that,” he says.
“He won’t see me like this. Again, I’m seen as I want to be seen.”
Jack was folded against the backseat. He hadn’t spoken in hours.
to Cas every goddamn day.
“Hey,” Dean says, setting a hand on his shoulder. “Seriously, pal. I’m here for you. And if you don’t want to talk, that’s cool too. Plenty of things I didn’t feel like talking about—not even to you or Sam. But you gotta let me in on your limits. Is it restaurants? Crowds? Other angels?”
. No, he wouldn’t have heard you, Dean. Not in his current state.”
Sam leaves them. Together. But not until getting the third degree from Dean. “What kind of deal did you make?” Dean exclaims, his arms still wrapped around Cas.
He leans back on the bench, spreading out a little, hoping Cas follows his lead enough to relax.
When they finally pull apart again, Dean says, “But I’m gonna need you to do something for me. This is why I need to get you stronger. Back up to full speed.”
On one level, he can’t believe he’s having this conversation with Dean. On another level, though, he can’t imagine having it with anyone else. “I don’t—I don’t know if I can do it again.”
He’s depressed. So is Sam, but only Sam will admit it. It’s normal to be depressed, he says, after all these “life-changing events.” One day, when they’re sitting in the kitchen together, Miracle lying at Sam’s feet, he flips his laptop around to show Dean. It says:
“You would?”
He put Cas in a place of suffering that has no end.
He thinks back to all the things he’d said over the years, all the subconscious defense mechanisms and not-so-oblique signals he’d given his best friend to preclude anything from happening between them. How he talked about the women he banged to Cas, even though it made Cas uncomfortable. Dean chalked up that discomfort to Cas’s being a prudish angel … but he’d be lying to say that’s
“Dean went to … therapy?”
Cas sniffles. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
In the dark, Jack laughs quietly. “Okay, Castiel.”
Cas is devastated by Dean’s death—but now he’s also surprised. He’s surprised by other angels’ reaction to the news.
“How is that possible? He’s a celestial being. He has an essence. He can’t just … stop existing.”
Dean’s expression changes from searching to concerned. Like he understands something for the first time.
“I like being with everyone I ever loved. Why would I go back?” He peers at Cas. Smiles. “Oh, come here,” he says, grabbing Cas for a tight embrace.
“I’m fine, Dean.” Cas walked toward him, hands in his coat pockets. Then, to Dean’s surprise, sat down on the floor next to him, his back against the cabinets. He peered at the photographs. “Can I see?”
But at that moment, Sam really does get the last laugh: a group of waiters approach their table singing “Happy Birthday,” bringing a cake with a sparkler on top. Once they’re gone, Dean looks at Sam and just shakes his head.
Dean wants to look away for a second, just to wipe his eyes, which are filling with tears faster than he can blink them away, but he can’t. He just gets out of his car. And then Cas is standing to meet him, and the distance between them is closing—again, it’s like distance has no sway in this place—and Cas is smiling but also crying, not unlike the last time Dean saw him, and then they’re together, and there are no more challenges to overcome and nothing between them. It’s just a crush of limbs and the scent of tears and the sensation Cas’s face against his, that same stubble. Dean is surprised by how familiar he feels. How physical. He kisses Cas’s cheek, at first. And then his neck. And cries into his shoulder.
. Not working. Just being there. Sometimes binge-watching Netflix. They watch episodes of
Cas rises from the bed, and Sam knows he’s leaving now.
Jack strokes his head. “Well, that’s not entirely true. Not everyone is okay. But if it’s taking you longer to recover, it’s because you absorbed the brunt of the Empty’s anger. As you helped others escape, it got angrier and angrier and had fewer beings on which to exact revenge. And—you know how the Empty worked. It confronted you with your sins, your guilt. It’s not surprising that it blew your own guilt out of proportion, weakening your essence. The Empty knew what makes us tick. It hit you where you live and breathe.”
“I’m drinking because I feel like it. Because I drink every night. And tonight the floor just seemed like the place.”
“Not like the rest of us, though. You understand humans … pretty well.”
“Cas, calm down—”
“Well, he certainly seems very nice. Earnest.” She hadn’t looked up from her gun so far, but now she did, tucking a wisp of hair behind her ear. “Be careful with him, Dean.”
“It’s why I saw the leviathan last night,” Cas said. “They don’t even go here. They belong in purgatory. I saw them because of my guilt. None of this is real.”
,” Sam says.
Dean’s gaze doesn’t waver. “She didn’t just stab you, Cas. She killed you. You were gone. I mean, dead and gone. And she didn’t bring you back, Gadreel did.” He pauses. “Sorry I didn’t tell you that at the time. It just wasn’t a good time. And then, afterwards—"
Of course, everything these days reminds him of Cas—sad commercials on TV,
So this is angel rehab. That’s what Cas calls it. He imagines Dean joking about it. “Angels have rehab? Is it a twelve-step thing? Do angels even
Dean approaches the car, takes his keys out of his pocket, and then stops. Faces his dad once more. “Cas isn’t just my friend, Dad.”
“And even if I
“It’s a long story. But yeah. We were there looking for this—it really isn’t important.” He takes another breath. “Anyway, we got separated, I prayed to him, I apologized. We found each other and got out. But …”
Sam’s quiet for a moment. Then he looks up. “I know we don’t say things like this to each other, Dean. But …” Sam’s voice drops. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
They find Sam in the kitchen. Sam clasps Cas close and cries. They hug for a long time. Near the end of it, Sam looks up and catches Dean’s eyes, and his eyes are incredibly sad because he knows Cas can’t stay—he’s always known. They’ve both always known, this whole time.
Cas squints. “That second thing isn’t quite accurate. You slept with Anna.”
“Who the hell are Daniel and Adina?”
“Yeah, I know. I just mean—” He searches Dean’s face. “I don’t want to do anything for Christmas this year.”
He tucks his arms behind him. “Sorry. I don’t mean to be so …”
“What?”
. Or:
Dean parks and gets out and starts up the flight of steps. He feels a bit like Rocky, climbing all these steps, but at least he doesn’t get winded. (He assumes it’s not possible to get winded in heaven.)
Mary shakes her head. “Dean, what are you
Now Dean is looking at Sam. Shaking his head.
To care about someone like Metatron. Someone like
. Up until three months ago, he thought he was straighter than a steak knife. Then Cas had to go and plant all these … doubts.
And then Jack is gone.
“Why would I do that?”
“Do what again? Do you mean—are we talking about Jack?”
“You really believe that?”
Okay, so he’s found someone. Online. Guy’s name is Federico. And he looks like Cas. At least in his pictures he looks like Cas. And his smile sorta looks like Cas’s smile, and his hair, and his body, from what Dean can see of it …
. The fact that he took them up on the invitation, coming along without much prodding, says it all.
“Dean, you need to open the door. You need to open the door
about?”
Cas looked up.
“What the hell?” Dean gasps.
It seems like a good idea, at first.
“No I didn’t.”
He sleeps. When he half-awakens in his hospital bed, he has a memory that feels like a dream. He remembers one of his last missions with Dean—the mission to recover the Leviathan blossom in purgatory. The mission where they were separated and Dean prayed to Cas, telling him he was sorry. Cas heard every word.
“I know,” Sam says into his ear, his own voice thick with tears.
“Too bad your brothers aren’t as open-minded,” Gadreel says.
“Cut the sanctimony, Castiel,” Bartholomew said. “We’re not getting out of here. Ever. That hope-and-change bullshit might have worked for your human fuckbuddies. But now you’re with us. And the one you gripped tight and raised from perdition? Doesn’t seem interested in returning the favor.”
“He means you have sex appeal,” Daniel explains.
—he turns to see Dean. They lock eyes through the windshield.
“Yeah, Dean.” He’s so frustrated with this conversation he could bolt. “How else can I say it? Do
“I’m afraid it is possible. Or, if it isn’t—I haven’t yet discovered how. How to recover him. There might be a way, but it is complicated.”
“There’s a library in town,” John explains. “Just up that way.”
“Sure. But the most recent volumes are only in Enochian.”
“And he won’t tell you this, but he’s the one who ended the Empty. He did that by getting everyone out. He didn’t just claw his way back here, to me. He got everyone else out as well. The other angels. It’s part of what’s allowed heaven to grow this wide and deep. Angel energy helps power heaven.”
“Your doctor thinks you need an antidepressant?”
“It is.”
He knew she wouldn’t tell him anyway.
Adina continues. “In the past few days we’ve also seen
Everything is grainy and undefined, but Sam can make out Cas’s hair, his eyelashes, the shape of his nose. It really is him, even if it’s not. “My brother thought you were gone, Cas. He spent the better part of a year blaming himself for your death. Not just your death—your total nonexistence. I think it killed him.” He feels some anger, some resentment, and it’s unpleasant. It’s unpleasant to feel anger toward Cas. “You could have at least let him know you were all right. Jesus. On our last mission, he wasn’t himself. He got careless. He might still be here if not for--I mean, the rebar finished him off. But that's not what killed him, Cas. He died of a broken heart.”
“Yeah,” Gabriel says, gesturing to Cas. “Back from the brink.”
She sneaked a glance at him. “Do you miss it? I mean …
It’s a story he’s been told—not something he actually lived.
And he knows he has a duty to Dean—and to the other angels—to receive these messages.
It’s almost spring, but it’s still cold outside. He puts on a hat and a coat and goes for a walk.
“You live with them in a house?”
This has been the shittiest year, on top of a shitty decade. Sure, they beat Chuck. But they lost everyone else—everyone who meant anything. This next year can’t be any worse, can it?
Later that evening, he saw she was outside on the deck, sitting on the steps. Smoking something. He went outside to check on her.
Dean says nothing. Sammy would just push past the guy and go on his merry way, but Dean’s never been able to do that.
In the booth, he feels Dean’s arm around his shoulder, like Dean is trying to hold him together. But he sees something else: Malachi is talking to two patrons, pointing them in his direction. Two familiar figures. Daniel and Adina.
“For what … we talked about. I couldn’t get out of bed either, Dean. After Cas and Jack were gone. You’re going through the same thing. Your response is just … delayed.”
He thinks about how much he’d rather be human—a being whose body has a definitive endpoint—than an angel that will live forever and ever, apparently.
“Geez. Don’t flatter yourself, Mr. Rochester—I’m not here for the view. I thought you might like to come along.”
Cas feels a kind of relief that’s two seconds from spilling into tears.
“I mean, what you’d look like. I thought maybe I was looking for someone the size of the Chrysler Building.”
He said, “Huh? What’s my ‘rationale’?”
“Put him back,” Cas says, in a tone that’s not unlike the one he once took with the Empty.
Dean tipped back his beer. He’d had several so far—Sam lost track. “And being American means not giving two fucks about bullshit semantics like that.”
It got tedious fast.
Eventually he started resorting to Winchesterisms:
It took Dean a few weeks to work up the courage to go into Cas’s bedroom. But when he did, he found that Cas did indeed have belongings—a few. One was a book called
Once again, Dean’s heaven is a road.
Sam knows it’s about Cas.
fault?”
“How could you abandon him like this? He needed you to be there, and you just didn’t show up, you looked away, you failed him—”
“So you won’t mind if I …” He touches Cas’s face, tilts his chin upward and kisses him. Just briefly, gently, but better than that day in the bunker.
, Cas thinks, and it’s deeply affecting to know this, but it also engenders in him a kind of protectiveness. He wants to assure Dean that he loves him unconditionally—that there’s nothing Dean could possibly do that would upset him or change the way he feels or make him not okay.
sigh. “Yeah, we still would have been pissed-off teenagers. But it would have been different.”
Jack pauses but keeps stroking his head, his other hand on Cas’s shoulder. “So I went to see them in a dream. And I couldn’t—I couldn’t bring them the news they wanted. I couldn’t tell them I had you back, that you were safe. But I felt I had to go to them … they’d been praying nonstop. I had to offer them some kind of closure.”
“Yeah, as a baby Sam looked just like Fred Astaire. Isn’t it weird?”
When he goes back inside, Dean is at the table in the alcove, hunched over his laptop. He looks up, annoyed. “The fuck, dude.”
Cas struggles to take in all this information.
“What happened between us—it can’t happen again. Not like that, not—” He couldn’t finish his sentence.
“Sam, I don’t know. It was just
“They don’t?” Gabriel says, pulling back to look at him. “I guess I’ll have to turn in my angel card. You should have seen me when I watched

. “I was inflicting my feelings about myself on you. I’m so sorry.”
If presented with the same choices? He’d make the same decisions. But the knowledge doesn’t make him feel any better. He never wanted to cause anyone pain.
Outside, on his way to his car, Dean expects to get an earful.
Dean’s still sad, and Sam still wants him to see the doctor, and he will … but it’s spring now—soon it’ll be May 18
He and Cas are sitting in his room on the bed, next to one another. Cas—infinitely patient, loving Cas—is holding both his hands in his, in his lap, their thighs pressed together. Dean’s just slumped against him. Their foreheads are touching.
Dean’s grief is always inversely proportionate to what he’s showing you. The worse he’s feeling, the more impassive he becomes. And right now he’s goddamn unreadable—sitting next to them in an outdoor lounge chair, staring straight ahead, a hand wrapped around a beer.
Dean’s birthday also passes with little fanfare. In fact, he and Sam are on the road, picking off a vamp nest. Fairly straightforward, low-risk mission. They don’t even let backup know.
Dean seems to reconsider him.
Cas's face relaxes again.
Dean listened to it until the little battery icon hit red, until he couldn’t get it to turn on anymore. Then he tucked it into Cas’s drawer, same place Cas kept his picture of Jack.
“I was awful to him, Mom. I was such a shit. The things I said to him after you died. I blamed him. I blamed
“So is drinking your manpain. At least smoking doesn’t make you fat.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. “So … what
is the sticking point here. You will be. You’re not right now.”
Claire turned to look at him again. “You thought maybe it was the second-to-last time. Because if you’d really known it was the last time? The
He sniffles.
“Keep telling yourself that, Casanova.”
“Malachi.”
Dean realizes now how ridiculous it was to think otherwise. But he always assumes the worst. “I just figured … you made that deal and there was no undoing it.”
“So I was in the veil?” he says.
Nothing.
“No zombies or demons or hexes. Just a bat virus that randomly made the leap into humans. We were overdue, really. Happens on this scale at least every hundred years.”
“It’s the birthday of the United States,” Cas corrected. “America is two continents. The United States is just one of the countries on the North American continent.”
He was exhausted. Unlike Cas, Dean
It’s too soon.
Cas stepped into the room and looked down at where Dean was sitting on the floor, empty beer bottles surrounding him. “How’s your mother? Is she settling in?”
to do some good—but it didn’t matter. It didn’t bring back the angels he’d killed.
“Ambriel—all those things—I did them because I felt they were right. Sometimes they
He turns to see a young blond kid, a teenager, behind a desk. “I’m just looking,” he says.
None of his cellmates bought this. “We’re not meditating our way out of torture,” Metatron said. Outside their cell, the sound of other inmates trying to breach the walls. Again.
more like it. Dean turns the radio off.
He remembers that day. How Sammy was able to hug her goodbye but he couldn’t. He was devastated. To have his mother back, and then to have to watch her walk out the door. Willingly.
When Dean had gotten rid of the bottles, Cas handed him back the photographs. “You should rest,” he said.
“Cas,” Dean said, raising his voice—and if you didn’t know him, you’d think he was about to tear Cas a new one. But Sam knew better. “Don’t ever change, buddy.”
It wasn’t difficult to figure out that they suffered in proportion to the guilt they felt, and that the anticipation of what would happen to them each night was worse than what actually happened. Gadreel pointed that out in one of his more lucid moments, which were becoming fewer and farther between. He said that all the millennia in heaven’s lockup taught him that—that waiting to be tortured was worse than torture itself. That during all that time, he never longed for an antidote to the physical pain—but he’d have taken anything for the crippling anxiety.
New Year’s Eve passes without a lot of fanfare. Sam and Eileen go out to dinner and ask if Dean wants to meet them afterwards for drinks, an invitation Dean finds ridiculous. But he declines politely, not wanting to horn in on the happy couple’s alone time.
“But these clones have no control over their lives,” Adina continues. “It’s accepted that they don’t have souls, even though they clearly experience all the same emotions as humans. They passively accept their fate, which is to give up everything for other people. What they want for themselves—well, it’s like they’re not even able to ask. And they’re also raised in an institutional setting and don’t have parents—just each other. Have you ever seen it, Dean Winchester?”
crossed with
“Don’t be so sure about that,” Dean says as he turns and leaves the room. He hates to admit this, but it feels good to say that, in a way. It feels good to say something grotty about Jack.
“For what? Not clawing your way out of the Empty fast enough? It’s like apologizing for only winning nine Olympic gold medals instead of ten.” He chuckles again. “Seriously, Cas. Lay off yourself.”
“I could do worse, considering.” She seemed to grow distant now, her eyes on the darkened tree line. “You know, it’s dumb. I’m dumb. Maybe I didn’t think Castiel could actually die. Like, not permanently. I mean, I know everything dies. But …” She paused. “It’s just—” She looked down at the smoldering joint between her fingers. “You know how, when you look back on things, you never thought, ‘That was the last time I was gonna see that person.’”
Cas shakes himself awake. “You were watching me sleep?”
Jack sighs.
he’s says. He’s not sure if he manages even that much. He tries to say he’s sorry, but he hits the floor before he has a chance.
But because he knows how Dean thinks, he knows why Dean
There’s a long silence. Sam doesn’t want to break it.
Cas had only about 30 songs on his iPod. Maybe that’s because iTunes went out of business? (Didn’t it? Dean wasn’t really keeping track.) Or maybe it was because Cas just wasn’t into music. In either case, most of the songs were uninteresting to Dean—lots of Beyonce, lots of Taylor Swift, some Demi Lovato. A little Selena Gomez. Dean kind of dug the “Same Old Love” song, it was a jam.
“Cas?”
Or reading about the things he liked.
, he thinks.
Dean drags a fry through some ketchup.
friend. But there was something about the way he’d thrown his arms around Dean right before Chuck had sent him to take out Amara, something achy and desperate. When Cas had said, “I could go with you,” Dean heard tears in his voice. He couldn’t look at Cas too long, not at that point, or he might start crying himself. Better to get back to the business at hand, and to give Cas a job to do:
In the corridor, Cas trailed behind Dean. “Dean,” he said.
“I know Cas,” Jack says, setting a hand on Cas’s forehead. “I just wish you’d forgive yourself. You didn’t fail.”
Dean is quiet and still.
“For bringing me back. For getting me out of the Empty.”
“Castiel, it’ll be okay. And then you’ll come back and tell us about it. Or—whatever you feel like telling.” He opens the door for him. “But not too soon. Seriously. Don’t hurry back on our account.”
At the table they’re playing cards.
“The program wasn’t intended for nefarious purposes,” Bartholomew said. “It was designed to help angels. You have to trust me on that one.”
“He’s your
“Oh, just shut up.”
Eventually they move over to the bench, arms still entangled. Dean pulls Cas closer. Nothing he wants to say seems adequate. Then again, maybe it doesn’t have to be. “I didn’t quite know what I was supposed to be looking for,” he says.
Cas levels his best blank stare.
It’s taking him every ounce of strength to keep himself steady.
Cas does so to find Dean’s green eyes staring into his. They stay like that for several long moments, moving slowly together. Then Dean breaks their gaze, speeds up, thrusting harder against him, his lips catching Cas’s, savoring his lower lip. He moves hand again so that it’s between them, grasping. Holding him in the right way. Breathing hard, Cas comes. Dean follows a few seconds later, and Cas holds him as he finishes, cinching both arms around him, relishing the sensation of Dean's warm breath on his neck. And Dean is kissing him again, fiercely. Then he kisses Cas lightly, his lips just grazing his cheek, his jawline. He eases off, laying his head against Cas’s chest, and Cas just holds him, weaving his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“Vampires, right.” Dean shakes his hand slowly, trying to organize his thoughts. He has too many thoughts. “How are you even—if I saved you, then—”
doing.”
“That song is very Daniel,” he says as he leads Ambriel out the backdoor and onto the terrace. But instead of staying on the terrace, they descend the steps to take a stroll around the backyard.
“And they don’t get to have nice things? You might want to rethink that policy. Probably why they get up to those … shenanigans.”
“You don’t get to say those things anymore, Dean.”
“I won’t.”
Dean picked up his bottle again. “Well, he is an angel. He sometimes doesn’t get our sense of humor. Shit sails right over his head.”
Again, Cas’s gaze slides to the door. “My last moments on earth with Dean were so fraught.” That’s the only way he can describe them. He doesn’t want to go into details.
When Jack shares with him his ideas for this new heaven, Cas recognizes that Jack understands humanity. He knows what people really need. Not perfection or absence of conflict, but space to be apart and space to come together and space to work things out. And reason to be purposeful. People in heaven can choose how to spend their time; they can work if they want; they can counsel other lost souls if they so desire.
Sam wouldn’t mind forgetting some things. “I don’t think we have the budget for that kind of thing. I mean, hiring some tech outfit to data-mine ancient Akkadian texts can’t be cheap.”
In the bedroom, Dean helps Cas out of his pants and then takes his off as well. They don’t bother to get under the covers. Initially they lie next to each other, Cas on his back and Dean on his side, his hands touching his abdomen. Cas flinches a bit. “You’re ticklish,” Dean says. “I didn’t know angels could be ticklish. Here.” Dean takes Cas’s hand and puts it on his abdomen, and then puts his hand on top of Cas’s. “That always helps.” Then he kisses Cas’s neck, his collarbone.
He's not. Or … he's trying not to be.
Now he knows Dean is joking, so he reaches up to touch the back of his head, kisses him again.
,” Gabriel says, cutting Metatron off. He tucks an arm inside Cas’s and guides him to his feet. A protective gesture. “I think this has all been quite enough for one day.”
intervene, but—”
She greets him at the door, ushers him inside. Offers him a glass of water, which he accepts. He’s tired because he’s driven all night. He’s tired because he’s been thinking—he’s had nothing to do but think for the last week.
He doesn’t say anything.
“Jesus, Sam.” Does his brother know how to do anything other than resort to melodrama? How did they make it through fifteen years of one apocalypse after another? They’re both so fragile now. It’s hard to imagine.
Even though he shot down Eileen’s suggestion of digitizing the entire collection—in ways less kind or delicate as they should have been—he’s decided to organize his spreadsheets.

means that he’ll always be part of this world—the celestial realm—and Sam and Dean will always be part of the other. When they arrive, there will be a distance. He won’t know Dean in this world as he knew him in the other. Dean will have had a life. A life without Cas. Better memories. Better times to reflect on. He hopes so, but …
Dean tries not to sigh. Sam is so freaking premenstrual lately. “No. I’m just saying. More people locked up in their homes means fewer opportunities for monsters to pick them off.”
“Secluded.”
“He may be delusional,” Metatron said. “But you and I both know he’s not lying.” He looked at Anna and Malachi. “Those rumors you heard? The things that snap you out of a moment? Those places you remember but have never been? All true.”
Sam just laughs. “Yeah, they want what they want.”
"He was the love of your life, Dean," he manages to choke out. "And you were his. You think I didn't know that? Dean."
Dean wished he were inside, where it was warm.
Finally Dean is steady enough to speak. “That sucks, Cas. It sounds … god-fuckin’-awful.”
. As it turns out, he and Sam are useless. Fucking useless! They save people from demons, not airborne pathogens.
“Jesus, Dean. I feel like I’m being interrogated by Dad. But yeah, I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Those things help sometimes.” He takes the bottle out of Dean’s hand. “You wanna try one?”
“What are you talking about?” Sam says.
He tries his best, but his heart isn’t in it. He doesn’t realize how much he dislikes the road until he’s driving these long stretches of open highway. How had he and Dean done this so effortlessly before? How had he never noticed how tedious the landscape, how annoyingly samey the interstates?
Dean’s breathing quickens with tears.
And maybe he's a little bit biased, about humans. His son is half-human, after all.
All Jack says is, “We need to go somewhere to talk.” And Cas knows his world is being ripped apart. Again.
“Charlie says hi, by the way. She said you’d be here at some point or another. Nerds of a feather, she said.”
Sam quickly shakes his head, and his eyes are stricken and sad.
, Amara said.
He tilts his head to look at Jack. “Other angels who came back from the Empty are okay. Why am I not?”
Cas’s eyes met his.
That gets Cas’s attention. He raises his eyebrows.
When it’s time—a time that reaches them far sooner than they thought possible—Dean says he knows exactly where Sam will be. Sam won’t wander heaven the way he once did.
, Sammy. Like the summer breaks we never got as kids. We should send Jack a thank-you card.”
“And Jody’s okay with that?”
“Who told you I was in love with him?” The bunker was warded; no angel could have heard his confession. Is Ambriel on some kind of fishing expedition?
He didn’t say anything. Where to even begin? He misses it all—he misses everything. He misses passing those long nights in the bunker, reading or looking at the internet while he waited for Sam and Dean to wake up so they could begin the day. He misses watching over Dean while he slept, which he did all the time, even though Dean told him not to, said it was “just creepy.” He misses the smell of food cooking, even if he didn’t eat it. He misses the road. He misses driving his

. He wasn’t expecting his brethren to care so much, to drop what they’re doing to come to see him at the fratway house. To offer their condolences.
to him instead, so you could both—this is just so dumb when I look back on it.”
He wonders how much his dad heard. Then again, he doesn’t really care at this point. If his dad thinks he’s a fruit? Oh well. He’s dead. They’re both dead.
“You’re on, like, pills?” Dean asks. “Where did you get these?”
He just keeps moving. Heaven is wild and beautiful, combining the most beautiful scenery earth can offer with some weird ethereal twist—sunlight shaded blue. Wind you can taste. One day, he longs for a thunderstorm, and when he turns a bend he sees one on the horizon. He loved storms on earth; here they’re better because he doesn’t have to worry about tornadoes. He decides to pull over and climb into the backseat. There’s even a blanket back there. (Where did that come from?) He rests as sheets of rain pummel the Impala—he always found rain so comforting on earth.
Jack looks down.
A couple times he drags himself to the door, just to prove he’s okay. Each journey to the door and back feels like it takes days.
He can still hear those things he said, feel them in his head, and he knows that they weren’t really meant for Jack.
, he wants to say, but he can’t form the words. He’s pained by everything Dean has lost: a real job. A normal home. Backyard barbecues. The opportunity to take vacations. To quit drinking, and fall off the wagon, and then quit again. To go gray. To take out a life insurance policy. To get arthritis and blame it on the hunting misadventures of his youth.
But Cas knows it’s about more than allowing themselves to indulge in these rituals. It’s about closure. It’s about saying goodbye to the things they left behind—the human world with its broken sincerity and gaudy imperfections. The world of Sam and Dean, to which they’ll never return, not
.” His voice dropped. “And then Cas and Billie weren’t.”
“Why don’t you look for him the old-fashioned way?”
. Well, okay, I did mean you. At the time. But—”
He thinks about sharing this information with Cas, whose face is pressed against his chest.
“Is it like
“Jack hasn’t put himself in the framework. That was Chuck’s greatest weakness. Jack—he

Metatron picks up his cards. “Gabriel’s the only angel in the history of creation happy to get a demotion.”

movie,” Dean says. “Ali McGraw. Ryan O’Neal. Total babe.” He glances at Cas out of the corner of his eye and smirks. Cas wonders which actor Dean is referring to.
Dean leaned his head back on the cabinets, looked up at the ceiling. “Sam deserves more time with her. Like, serious one-on-one time.”
“For what?”
happy—until the Empty made me that deal in exchange for Jack’s life. And it could do that only because it had been in my head. It had access to all my memories—even the ones Naomi tried to erase. It knew about you, and it knew about Sam. It knew that I loved you, Dean. And it knew this made me different.”
“It was to keep us all from turning into that!” Bartholomew pointed at Gadreel, who was currently doubled over, whimpering and unresponsive. “You have any idea what centuries—millennia—of fighting and killing do to an angel? Of being forced to commit genocide? To snuff out entire continents of people when the fucking archangels decided they'd had enough? Huh? That messes an angel up.” He paused. “We used to have to euthanize scores of our own kind after each battle, their mental suffering was so great. We couldn’t go on like that. So … someone found a better way.”
“No, it’s—I shouldn’t have said that.” Cas didn’t take his hand from Dean’s arm.
“He’s taken a hard line against celestial intervention. Angels—we caused more problems than we solved. Taking vessels was necessary, but a great wrong. So now both angels and demons are restricted from interacting with humans as we used to. Jack and Rowena are in agreement about that. We still help, but …” Cas shifts, cupping the back of Dean’s head. “Jack loves you. He loves you so much, Dean. There’s nothing you could ever do to make that not true. You have to trust that.”
“I—I didn’t want to say anything before because I thought it might be kinda awkward?”
That afternoon, Hannah came by. They walked through the main rooms, where others were playing pool and cards and listening to music.
? We had feelings for a reason, Bartholomew! You can't protect creation if you don't care about it. No wonder everything went to shit.”
Instead, John just points to his car and says something complimentary about it, something bland and noncommittal. Then he turns to square off with Dean. “It would be nice if you could stay longer. Get caught up on things.”
He tries not to feel glum, but he knows he’s not going back to earth. Things are different now.
to know Jack would get me out.”
“Jesus. Will you stop blaming yourself for Cas? Cas made that deal, Dean. He did so, knowing full well what the consequences would be.”
Hannah sat down next to him. “You don’t think you’ll do a tour on earth now?”
Now Dean says nothing. He doesn’t look at either of them. And then, in a voice so plain and unaware that it injures Sam to hear it, Dean says, “Yeah. I’ll do that.”
Then he wants to cry, knowing that Dean spent his last months on earth thinking about those words. Believing he’d been this paradox: the root cause of both Cas’s unhappiness and his subsequent happiness. Cas’s death sentence.
“Insurrectionists. Yes.”
“Somewhat. But talk therapy tends to be more effective. Which I haven’t gotten around to doing yet.”
I had to give myself permission to be happy. To love what I had already, which was your brother. I didn’t need anything from him other than to tell him how I felt about him. I needed to tell him how I saw him. Who he really was. He’d already given me everything.”
Gadreel was an absolute mess. His hands shook constantly. He could barely speak. When he did, it was to bargain with something, to pray in Enochian to some unknown deity.
“Afterwards we go back to regenerating ourselves,” Anna said. “The next day, it begins again.”
“Well, yeah. You had your moments. And sometimes he deserved them. But anyway, you raised me. That took a lot of patience. No wonder you didn’t have a lot left for Jack.”
“Dean.”

“I’m sorry, Dean.”
“For what?”
“Not intentionally. You were just doing what you do. But in setting the stage—”

Sam fixes his gaze on a sign in the distance:
There’s a long silence where neither of them can say anything.
“Right, I’m a stupid guy who can’t science. But I understand when you’re catastrophizing, and you are.”
into every foreign language I can think of and then some—I’m an idiot about this shit, but you’d—you’d be fucking proud.” He tries to smile but begins to sob. “And I can’t find a single goddamn thing that mentions the Empty, that would give us any fucking spell, let alone a spell we could cast with his blood. I can’t find any fucking
“Okay. I’m here, though. If you need me.”
“Thanks for reminding me.”
He didn’t believe anyone could love him, until he found out someone did, someone who was murdered for it, right in front of him. For him.
They approach the booth, smiling as they draw closer.
“I wish we’d gotten to do this with Jack,” Dean says. “He would have loved this.”
“It’s not,” Cas whispers. “Angels don’t cry.” Or, at least they're not supposed to. Cas never used to cry. These days, he can't stop.
“What does it look like? I’m smoking a J.” She took a drag.
Dean wants another beer. Anything to keep from thinking about the fact that he’s two seconds away from breaking down.
die, and being left to fend for himself on this planet, alone and cut off from heaven. He remembers the last time Cas was human, when Dean visited him in Idaho, and he was so small and pale and thin and emotionally compromised that he attracted some kind of special euthanizing angel to put him down.
The kid nods sheepishly. “Not everything, but …”
Miracle’s with Sam, and he’s so excited to see Dean that he jumps up on him. Dean lurches back. “Dammit, dog.”
“You want me to tell Sam you’re okay.”
“Cas.” Sam leaned forward. “It’s just a spreadsheet.”
He does not think these things, but at this moment, he wants nothing more than to be with Dean. He should stay at the house, really—he knows the second they’re seen by an angel it’ll be all over angel radio—but the urge to be with Dean is more powerful.
Sam closes his eyes.
the Gas-n-Sip? Maybe this is how he’s rebuilt heaven, by becoming the inanimate architecture he admired while he was on earth. Christ, maybe he’ll become the bunker next. Or the house where Jack was born.
“Well, I’m telling you to go.”
—and he knows exactly why.
Cas doesn’t quite process this. He tries to turn his thoughts back to the Empty, but he has nothing. Only the knowledge that it was terrible and he suffered and was slammed into an abyss with enemies he’d spent a lifetime pissing off.
Cas. And you still haven’t recovered. The Empty—it took a lot out of you. And my telling you about Dean certainly didn’t help matters any.”
She paused, her eyes meeting his. “He’s very devoted to you, Dean. I think—I think you mean a lot to him.”
with this man. He is the McAdams to your Gosling. And fate or chance or circumstance or … whatever the fuck you want to call it … has dropped Mr. Cheekbones on your doorstep again … and all you do is cry a goddamn river about how you should have been there to save his ass. Again. Which you have already saved eighty times, and with no satisfying resolution to your arc.”
“But what did you do before that, Malachi?”
But one day he runs into Ambriel and strikes up a conversation. He tells her where he’s living. Curious about the fratway house, she follows him home and he gives her the tour. “So this is what you guys do all day? Nothing?”
“We got back to the bunker that night, and, I don’t know. I kissed him.”
“Destroyed?”
Dean squeezes his shoulder harder. “You were such a great dad, though. You and Cas both. Everything Jack became, and everything this whole
One day he’s at a rest stop outside Poughkeepsie when he gets a call. Well,
“Well, so what?” Gabriel gives his upper arm an affectionate squeeze. “That’s nothing you can change now. So it doesn’t matter.”
“I suspect you feel bad about it, Bartholomew,” Cas said. “It’s why you’re here.”
“I know, right? It didn’t feel like the right time to visit them again. It seemed like they were finding their own way. Without me. Without you. And I was still wanting to differentiate myself from Chuck as much as possible. No meddling.”
Cas is thankful that Jack has set up this secluded part of heaven for him and Dean—not because he cares what anyone else thinks of them—an angel and a human together—but because he knows that the angels are just damn
Jack clears his throat, his voice brimming with tears. “It was an awful thing to tell them—the saddest thing I’ve ever—”
Dean sure knows how to compartmentalize.
They don’t like to talk about their time in the Empty. No one does. It’s taken Cas a long time to remember what even
“Just shut up,” Sam says. “I realized a long time ago that it doesn’t matter. You were cruel to Jack, and I don’t care why. The shit you said to him sometimes, Dean. It was … beyond abusive. It was
He knows that Metatron is here because Metatron was also brought back from the Empty. He remembers now. He was shocked to see him in the Empty when he arrived—hadn’t Metatron died a human? “Well, take that up with the Empty,” Metatron said. “It claims I’m its property, and it doesn’t seem interested in litigating the matter. It’s like the age of irony, Castiel. Just when you think you’ve put it behind you, it claps back.”
. One desperate decision turned into another, and then another, until it felt as though he had no choices at all. He’d sided with the Winchesters most of the time, and he believes he was right to do so. The Winchesters saved the world and raised Jack, making this version of heaven possible.
“No.” He’s never watched a single thing like that—ever
They do this very human thing. This thing called
And then just:
lucky.” He flips the page. “Some can supposedly see ghosts and demons.”
Dean’s thinking through the implications of what his mother’s saying when he catches some movement out of the corner of his eye. His father.
“Look, everybody needs their own space,” Dean said. “Even you, Mr. ‘I don’t sleep.’ Why don’t you just go in and relax? Take a load off.”
“What? Did I say it wrong?”
“I haven’t seen him
“Who knows,” Metatron said. “They’re not as unpopular, I guess. Being on this ward means you’re a special kind of Jeffrey Epstein pariah. Which you must have undoubtedly figured out when you opened your eyes to see little old me. I mean, are you high, Castiel? Did you really think you were going to stroll into the
Cas didn’t say anything, but Dean understood his hesitation: the “other people” Dean talked about? Included Mary. This had been Mary’s room, and Dean had blamed Cas for Mary’s death. (Unfairly, Dean knew. Indeed, Cas had told him something was wrong with Jack, had prodded Dean to see for himself—Dean just hadn’t listened.)
Dean blinks, confused. Isn’t that what he’s been doing? “I’ve been everywhere.”
Dean looks at his mother. Now it’s his turn to be confused. “I kissed
But Cas pointed out that maybe the widow was relieved to be so unlucky—that in that moment she felt lucky. She felt comfort. Her last seconds must have been terrifying, but also mercifully quick.
In the evenings, sometimes they go into the Dean Cave and watch movies. They watch anything that gets their mind off everything. Stupid romcoms, action movies, reruns of
The thought was shattering: Cas listened to this song while understanding all too well that for him there’d be no fucking rainbow. No winter sunsets. No music or birds or gardens. Nothing of the world he loved, nothing but darkness and emptiness and endless separation from everything and everyone.
“No shit, Sherlock. But why the fuck not?”
“You kissed Castiel?”
“You know I promised not to do that, Cas. I promised not to interfere.”
. Vacations to the beach, visits to Santa Claus, first days of school, missing teeth. Snow days, outings to the swimming pool, birthdays, picnics, bike rides, whatever. Pictures just because. Brothers and sisters posed side by side, giving each other bunny ears, or standing outside a minivan, or cuddling a cute dog, or eating cookies with Grandma, or catching fireflies in a backyard.
“Maybe,” Sam says, his mind on Dean—not on the possibility of having to break the spine of every book in that library in order to scan the pages.
He wakes up every so often to go to the bathroom. To check his phone, where he pulls up the case count and death toll. It just keeps ticking higher.
So each evening, when Sam is busy with something else, he goes into Cas’s bedroom and shuts the door, breathing the same air Cas did, looking at the same surroundings. Occasionally he lies on the bed, staring up at the ceiling, wondering if Cas ever looked at it in the same way. More often he sits in the chair next to the desk. It’s more likely Cas spent time at this desk, doing research in his off hours.
Dean says nothing. He doesn’t move or blink or attempt a smile. He just takes another swig of his beer, and Sam hates himself for having just done that, for alluding so irreverently to the life they’d led in the past year, the life they shared with Jack and Cas. For talking about things so casually, as though Jack and Cas had just slipped outside for a cigarette and could come back inside at any moment to order another beer, and tell another joke.
There was silence. Then Crowley said, “Well, thanks for the monologue, Cas. Just what I needed to get my mind off my next rape by tire iron—more self-serving angelic wallowing.”
Jack reaches over to touch his face. “Sleep, Cas.”
That night, he doesn’t allow himself to take sanctuary in Cas’s bedroom. He realizes that being in that room isn’t torture—it’s a privilege. One he doesn’t deserve.
Then Cas could hear it: the thrumming of inmates against some unseen wall. How was it possible? There were no walls in the Empty. Not the way heaven had walls …
“Hey,” Gabriel says, coming into his room and closing the door behind him. “What’s up?”
“Tell you what,” he says to Sam, “since we know how the world really works? We’ll celebrate Jack’s birthday. We will go all motherfucking out on that one.”
be okay. But he wasn’t deliberately ignoring you or anything. He’s healing himself, and I’m healing him … but he’s not at full power.”
Dean pulls the flier from his back pocket. “And I’m gonna have to take these classes, I guess. You know these two? Daniel and Adina?”
"Cas? What do you mean?"
Sam watched as Dean emerged from the liquor store.
Hannah’s gaze meets his, and it’s a strange moment. Cas can’t decide if she’s devastated or unnerved or just relieved. “Castiel,” she says, and her voice sounds odd and faraway.
He doesn’t ask the next question. He already knows the answer: Cas can’t stay.
And that’s to say nothing of what he did to Jimmy Novak’s family.
He manages to maneuver his wheelchair around the corner. Then he sees someone standing in his doorway. The person turns around. It’s Balthazar.
“Well.” She looked straight ahead. “It’s for medicinal purposes, then. I have a prescription.”
Sam’s concerned. Sam’s
Dean clasped his hands together in front of his computer screen. “Cas. That’s not luck. That’s not misfortune. That’s Billie being an asshole.”
“Do you think those stuffy British Men of Letters ever intended their reading room to be used in this way?” Mary asked, the pieces of her rifle spread out on the cloth.
? Will Dean be expected to kiss Federico? What if he doesn’t want to? And if Federico offers to give him a blowjob, should he politely decline? Or should he say yes? And then what? He’ll have to return the favor.
“Sleep now, Sam. Know that I’m with you.”
Dean entertains a number of scenarios:
,” Gadreel says. “That way, we can better understand the situational context in which Castiel finds himself, and properly advise him on what to do next.”
Metatron looks at the ceiling. “Oh my God, Castiel … screw Paris.” He shakes his head. “Seriously, if you go to Dean Winchester and start whining to him about all that growing-old shit he didn’t get to do? That’s what he’s going to say to you. ‘Screw Paris.’”
, he thinks. Angels can always recognize each other, regardless of what form they’re taking.
Dean breaks it off, cups Cas’s upper arm. “What we did last night—that was okay for you?”
. This is what I’m talking about when I say you have no sense of narrative. Or irony, situational or dramatic. You get more O. Henry endings than any being in existence, and it is
Jack looked up at the sky. “And this is like, America’s birthday?”
“A smooth flight the whole way,” Dean replies. “No bumps.”
“We come here on our teaching days,” Adina says. “We like the atmosphere. Good people-watching opportunities.”
“Castiel,” Jack says. “I know that’s why you’ve been calling for me.”
Human isn’t what Cas is. He’s something else that’s equally beautiful and brilliant. Dean can’t take that, can’t ask for that.
“I’m good.”
She scoffed. “It’s been decriminalized here.”
He raises an eyebrow.
“Twice a day. Human clocks—never mind.”
And he sure as shit didn’t belong in the Empty.
Dean wants to scoff and tell Sam not to be such a pill-popping drama queen, but … the fact remains that he hasn’t been sleeping well either. So he nods and Sam gives him a small peach-colored pill.
Dean sniffles, raises his head a little bit to look at Cas. “I love you too so much, Cas.” His voice breaks. “Oh, Cas. I’m just—I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t say that when I was alive. I’m sorry that I didn’t make you feel … wanted.”
“But if they were moving on, Jack. If they were moving on …”
“You’ve seen Jack?”
“I have six wings,” Cas says. “And a lot of eyes.”
Dean waited a beat. Then he rose. “Well, I want a drink. And as luck would have it, we have plenty of that around.” He got up to stroll over to the wet bar. On his way, he lingered for a second and squeezed Cas’s shoulder. “You want one, Sam?”
“Yeah, I was. How do you like them apples?”
“I swear to God, Sam. If you fucked that up because you were too worried about your sad-sack brother—”
As always, he just goes along.
“Hello, Sam,” he said, looking over his shoulder. “How are you this morning?”
He tries to put Dean out of his mind. Dean is back on earth, where he belongs, and Jack probably won’t send Cas for a tour of duty there for another three millennia. That’s probably for the better. In the meantime, he has to figure out how to get along with his fellow angels. Clear his debts. Pay his dues. Ask for forgiveness and hope like hell they can move past all the strife of the last twelve years. After two civil wars and a few failed coups, he knows he’ll never be accepted by them again—not really.
They both stopped walking. Dean turned around.
“No, I don’t mean it like that.” Now Cas is the one who’s quiet, still.
“Yes, I believe so.”
He tried not look exasperated. He hates how other angels credit him for this. As if he did it alone.
Jack looks at him quizzically.
He waits a moment. “It’s okay, Mom. I know it must have been—I mean, you hadn’t been on the planet since Sally Ride was orbiting the earth. You didn’t want to come back. You were forced to. By Amara. It’s like … when we had Jack.”
“Cas,” Dean says. “I was the most miserable son of a bitch on the planet. It’s like … the height of all irony that I showed you what happiness is. Add another line to my résumé. ‘Killed Hitler. Helped defeat God. Taught Cas how to be happy.’” He lays his head back down on Cas’s chest and laughs.
“We have three floors of this building just about angels,” the kid says, with a little too much gusto for Dean’s liking. “And another four annexes. Anything you’re looking for?”
“What about Sam?” Cas says. He feels bad that thoughts of Sam are only just occurring to him.
“Fuck you, Cas,” Dean whispered to the empty truck as the guy sang.
Sam waited, staring at Jack.
“Maybe it won’t. It might not be enough to disturb the Empty … but maybe it’ll be enough to wake one of us up. Enough of a jolt. So one of us can get the hell out of here. And if my son is still alive, you get to him and the Winchesters and tell them what’s going on.”
Jack casts him a sideways glance. “I wish you’d stop thinking it’s too good for you.”
Halfway there, he loses his nerve. He brings the car to the side of the road and slumps against the steering wheel. He can’t go through with this. I mean, what will they even
“You mean torture.”
(which Dean secretly hates). But it’s fine—he’s fine. He sits there with the dog next to him (he now lets Miracle on the sofa) and waits until it’s time for bed. He doesn’t go into Cas’s room anymore … but at some point he will. He’ll find the rest of Cas’s signs. He’ll play the Led Zeppelin tape, discovering some meaning in the song Cas last listened to. He’ll find the charger for the iPod. He’ll take Jack’s picture and tuck it in his wallet. And then he’ll go back to his own room, or go downstairs, or go to the kitchen, or go wherever else he wants to be.
“If I get out by blowing myself up, I’ll find my son. If I don’t make it out or survive the explosion, then whichever one of you manages to wake up will have to go to him yourself. You need to tell him that our minds are entangled here in the Empty. That might be why he can’t find me.”
“Who?”
“This could put a dent in hunting,” Dean says. They’re together in the Dean Cave, watching TV.
“I don’t mean it like that. I mean, well.” She put her gun down. “I mean, be careful with his feelings. He … he seems to take you very seriously, Dean.”
“I know,” Jack says abruptly, cutting the nurse off from whatever else he was going to say. Then, more softly: “You tend to the body. I’ll see to his mind.”
“Yes, he wants to see you too, Cas. He wants to see you
Cas tilted his head forward. “What?”
Novak makes a small noise of exasperation and turns away. “Exactly. And just think—this used to be a good neighborhood.”
. Yeah, of course he’s with them all the time—that’s what he said. But it sure as shit doesn’t feel like it.
He shakes his head, mostly to himself.
“Let’s just say hunting’s been slow lately. Maybe that has to do with Jack and Rowena, maybe it doesn’t. But in the meantime, I’ve taken up poker to make ends meet. As it turns out? I’m good at reading people.”
“If you were truly grateful we wouldn’t be having this conversation!”
The clink of saucers interrupts his thoughts. Then a waiter plunks two mugs of coffee, asks what they want.
His heart sinks. One person he could have done that with, had that with. Seems pointless to look elsewhere now.
“Metatron has ruined the ending of every movie for me, I’m afraid.”
“No, Dean.”
“I know, Cas, and I’m grateful—”
Cas assures Dean that he’ll still be there when he wakes up, and Dean trusts this and falls into a restful sleep. Cas is, of course, there when he wakes.
Dr. Vallens? It takes a second to sink in. The shape-shifting therapist. “This isn’t Dean, this is, um, his brother. Sam.”
“I viewed Jack as expendable. That's the opposite of selfless. And Cas, he didn’t know any of that,” Dean continues. “If he had, he’d probably still be alive.”
“Nothing,” Sam says, shaking his head, his face wet. His voice is warbly. “I just found him upstairs. He walked through the front door.”
—when he throws open the door. To find Cas.
“I’m sorry, Sam,” he gasps. “He was your friend, too and—and I took him from you, and from Jack—I took Jack’s dad from him—he’s in the Empty forever and it’s all my fault—”
Dean agrees to this. He hugs his mother goodbye and she whispers in his ear, “This will all work out, Dean. I promise.”
okay. He loved you too, Cas. Like I always said, you’re the best friend we ever had. Sam still doesn’t know what happened to you, and he misses you like hell. And for him to move on, it’s gonna take seeing you with his own eyes. Hearing your voice. Trust me, I know how the kid operates.” He takes Cas’s hand in his. “Can you do that for me?”
Deans looks up to find the kid staring at him.
At moments like this, Dean remembered why he loved Cas. “Cas, I didn’t mean it like—I didn’t mean
“Balthazar,” he says.
“It’s kind of what we do,” Gabriel says, shuffling the deck to deal a new hand. “What we
Cas and Ambriel go into the art room, where they find Adina sitting on a stool in front of an easel. She pokes her head out from behind the canvas to smile hello.
“Resting. Maybe sleeping.”
Cas looks at the ceiling. “To have left you like that. I mean, like
“No—no, it doesn’t sound like that. They’re saying it’s a novel coronavirus.”
things rather than just talking about them ….
He surprises himself, how fast he says it. And he surprises Cas too.
Cas held Gadreel’s arms, his shoulders, hoping that someone else’s presence would snap him out of it. He said, “We’re never going to find a way out of here if we don’t start working together on it.”
Probably. Dean gave him that impression. He realizes that now.
“The queen of hell,” Cas said. “And also—” He pointed to Crowley. “His mother.”
Dean pulls Cas toward him, gives him a casual embrace and kisses the side of his face. “I’ll get you something, bring it back.”
“So where is he?” Malachi said. “If he was able to wake you up once before, then why the hell doesn’t he just do that again?”
last time? You’d have said what needed to be said.”
“For some people,” Cas continued as though Dean hadn’t interrupted, “seeing ghosts is something they want. They would view someone with a psychic gift as fortunate, I suppose. Even if that person feels very unfortunate.”
In December, Eileen says she wants to go to the zoo in Kansas City. She’s always wanted to go. For the holidays, they put up all kinds of lights. And though it’s a drive, they set aside a Saturday to go. Dean doesn’t seem annoyed to be a third wheel anymore. He doesn’t even mind sitting in the back.
He wishes he’d said
So when he suggests to Sam that they hit up the Pie Festival in Akron—a two-day drive—Sam goes with him. Of
He starts to cry then, wrapping his arms around his chest and leaning against the headboard. Quiet, heavy sobs.
, he thought. When he’d been alone with his mother, looking for Sam, he’d filled Mary in on the details of Sam’s life. His achievements. National Merit Scholar. Stanford. Hell yeah, Mom, you heard that right. Fucking
“Well,” Dean says. “I believe the only reply to that observation is ‘no shit, Sherlock.’”
How can Sam possibly know that these are their last days together? That Dean will come home from Akron in a body bag? If he could know this, he would tell him what he really needs to say.
“Difficulties?” Dean says. Inwardly, he’s just glad he didn’t greet Cas—well, Jimmy Novak—with
“Dean, you were
“Okay, well that’s bullshit.”
“Hunting’s been slow.”
, he thinks.
“I’ve been praying to him all day, Sam. And just … nothing.”
Angels with little exposure to humans don’t understand: You can love someone, but there’s no guarantee they’ll love you back. There are vagaries of attraction; of sexuality, of something called “sparks.” Or “butterflies.” All of which he knows he’s experienced with Dean, sure. But he just doesn’t know if Dean ever felt the same way—if he
“Just know that he might open up to you about it, or he might not. In either case.”
Sometimes they go to a diner or a bar or a waffle place that’s just like one of the many they frequented with Sam and Dean over the years. Other times they just sit on a bench in a park next to a pond.
Part of him wants nothing more than to see Dean, to welcome him into this place. But another part of him—the stubborn part of him—thinks it’s still too soon. And, well, he’s nervous. He thought he’d have more time to prepare for this day, to get himself in order. Now he’s not sure if he’ll ever be in order.
“I—” he begins.
“I mean,
Mary still looks confused, but she also looks contemplative. A crease forms between her eyes. “So you kissed Cas … and what? It was awkward afterward?”
“Nothing, Dean. I—I’m just—”
Other nights they didn’t say anything at all. Dean would always be gone by morning—back to his own bedroom, or out walking the dog.
“I mean, she’s clearly got a screw or two loose. But still, Castiel. You gonna move on this girl or what?”
or whatever dreary movie they’ve seen most recently.
Sam shrugs.
“Rest, Castiel,” Jack says, touching his forehead, cupping his face. “Shh, don’t say anything.”
“Two tickets. I suppose this one’s for you?” He holds out one of them.
Then Sam says, “I talked to our contact in Geneva, the Men of Letters member who has deep access to the World Health Organization.”
“And yet you don’t seem to be excited about the prospect. You’re stalling.”
“You didn’t have to do that,” Sam says. “Giving away all the pie. Christ.”
So now Hannah has left and he’s in his small room, trying to collect himself. And trying not to think about Sam and Dean. His family. Moving on without him. It hurts—it hurts so much. And he knows they’ll be here soon (he doesn’t want them to be here
“I’m not taking Jack’s dad from him again,” he says.
“For what?” he says, shaken. He touches her arm, which is still wrapped around him.
Still sitting, he turned to look at her as she slid open the door. He wanted to ask her,
“You’re following this new viral outbreak thing, right?” he says. “This thing in China.”
He takes Cas’s hand in his and presses it against his chest. “That’s just not true. This thing between you and me? You give. You give a lot. And to everyone else? You’ve given everything. Your entire existence has been spent in service to others.” He thinks of that ridiculous list in the book in the library, of battles and garrisons. Talk about selflessness. Dude’s never had a day off. “And now? If I can just be here for you? With you?” He shrugs. “I’m lucky.”
, he thinks. He wants to tell Jack that the Empty should be glad it’s dead and that Dean Winchester is too, because if not, he’d resurrect its stupid ass just to torture it for a few years till it begged to be put down again.
got us all back in one piece, hermanito.”
“Confirmation bias,” Anna said, catching on faster than anyone else, providing Cas with the vocabulary he didn't have. “We’re reinforcing each other’s belief systems, based on the information Metatron gave us.”
“Who’s Rowena?”
“Your brother was a remarkable person. And he talked about you all the time. If you need anything—if you just need to talk …”
“Yeah, it’s a new thing, I guess.”
“Thank you, but I’m fine. I’ll take the elevators.” Elevators will give him some time to work out what he needs to say.
Heart sang.
“Jack?”
As they walk around the zoo, he wants to say something to Dean, but it’s something Dean’s not ready to hear. Maybe he’ll never be able to hear it, Sam doesn’t know.
“Am I—are you real? Or is this a dream?”
“What does Paris have to do with anything?” Adina says.
“I don’t know. I could wake up, or I could be still here. Or I could be gone forever.” Jack had escaped the Empty after he exploded, but that was with Billie's help. Cas also suspected that Jack strong enough to do so because he was half archangel. Cas doubted that things would go the same way for him.
Cas lies back down. And feels deeply, deeply ashamed. His son is so good. Pure kindness. Precious to him.
So this is the research library his father was talking about.
Everything took on a different meaning. He remembered a few years ago when he and his mother had been sitting in the reading room together, cleaning guns.
“We were kidding ourselves, thinking Dean would retire from hunting just because Chuck no longer had the reins. And if we send him back now—”
Dean glances up at him, unconvinced. Then he goes back to pressing his face against Cas’s chest.
. Well.” Dean rolls over onto his back. “Your six wings sound kinda sexy. And your eyes? Hmm. All the more to watch me when I sleep, I guess.”
Cas never appears to Sam again. He doesn’t need to. But he still looks in on him from time to time, just to see what he’s doing, how his life comes together. It happens quickly now, from here on out. Time passes much more easily, on both sides of existence.
been listening. He can’t look him in the face so he focuses on a thread unraveling from the shoulder of his jacket. It’s funny—even in heaven, clothes get tattered and torn. Loved.
Dean props himself up on one elbow. “If anything isn’t what you want, or doesn’t feel good, you have to tell me.”
, Dean thought.
“Peachy,” Crowley said. “This just gets better.”
“Where’s that friend of yours, Castiel?”
Okay, now this is just stupid. He’s really losing his mind.
“I mean, I never have any side-effects, so it didn’t occur to me.”
“I killed Cas. You didn’t believe me the first time I told you. Maybe you’ll believe me now.”
is the best thing for that, and it’s updated frequently, events permitting. It’s in the L Block.” He points to an area on the piece of paper. Dean can tell it’s a map of the building. If you can call the building a building.
He doesn’t call anyone. He doesn’t tell anyone. He knows the last thing Dean would want is a ceremony, a big to-do with all their friends. He hated attention in life—he’d hate it even more after death.
He passes the rest of the evening—the rest of the year—in Cas’s room before going into his own to fall asleep. He doesn’t turn on the TV, doesn’t watch the ball drop, doesn’t watch Ryan Seacrest.
She squeezes his hand and pulls him closer to her. “But how are
“So I wandered onto Oprah.com a couple times. So sue me. But you of all people deserve to be happy.”
It feels good, to be of use again. It gets a little easier.
Now Jack looks even more puzzled. “Cas. You saved yourself.”
Now he pushes himself to a sitting position, trying to shake off those memories, the heavy feelings of dread and the nightly weight of anticipation, of knowing that these entities—angels he considered family—were going to beat the walls down once again to shred his wings, take out his eyes, burn him alive, and pulverize the rest of his being.
Just when Sam firmly believes that he’s never going to see or hear from Jack ever again, he has a dream. In it, Jack meets him on a park bench, looking every bit as youthful and human as he did when they saw him last, and Sam is so overjoyed to see him he almost knocks him over. “I missed you so much, buddy,” he says, resisting the urge to give him a noogie.
. He misses his brother so much that he’ll do anything to have a piece of him. To know everything he possibly can. He needs all of Dean, and he needs him right now.
, Cas. The Empty was pure absence, the absence of everything. You were nowhere.”
“Are they helping?”
has injured Cas, so he rushes to fill the silence.
“I want you here, Cas. I really do. I want you with me
“I already know how,” Cas disclosed one night after accidentally knocking an empty whiskey glass onto the floor. It shattered. Cas usually wasn’t clumsy, but he’d been drinking.
Sam wants to believe her. He rubs his jawline. “Castiel and my brother were … extraordinarily tight. Dean never had many friends. We moved around a lot growing up. And he was, you know,
“Fine, forget—”
“No,” Dean said. “
“Actually, about that.” Cas lies back down. “I’m pretty tired. I think I’m going to sleep, too.”
in the Empty, and how he got them all out.
And Cas. Cas is the friend Dean never deserved either, a friend who sacrificed not just his life for Dean but his very existence—his essence—with no expectation of getting anything in return. And in the moment of truth, he was left with nothing. Dean couldn’t step up, couldn’t give Cas the bare minimum of what he deserved—the affirmation that Cas meant as much to Dean as he did to Cas.
“He’d just go back to doing the same thing. He thinks he has to save the whole world.”
But they can’t go back. No one can go back. Letting people jump between worlds—that was the problem. That was done solely for Chuck’s amusement, regardless of the price to humanity.
“I don’t think Castiel should be watching anything right now,” Metatron says. “I think he needs to wing his thick-as-a-brick ass down to Winchester’s part of heaven and see what happens next. And then.” He clears his throat. “
This one contains two tickets for the Eagles’ upcoming Hotel California Tour. “Jesus Christ, Sam. Completely unnecessary.”
Cas smiles sadly. “You did it again, Dean.” He shakes his head. “You edited your own memory, just as you did with Purgatory. You're so hard on yourself. Here, Dean.” He reaches up to touch Dean’s forehead … and Dean’s back in the dungeon, just for a second, but—
“Those two are a trip,” Dean says. “How do you know them?”
“Apparently not. But he’ll get there.”
not hungry. “It just didn’t work out.”
.” He pauses. “You were the one consistent good thing in that poor kid’s life.” He reaches over and gives Sam’s shoulder a squeeze. “That’s something you should be proud of. Hell, I’m proud of you, for the way you were. With him.”
Every night, he goes into Cas’s bedroom. He does this, he thinks, to torture himself.
Then again, why be embarrassed? It was Cas.
“Yes, your dimension is difficult to navigate by faith alone. Your belief systems don’t lend themselves to recognizing an un-vesseled benevolent presence. You’re attuned more often to negative energy—a consequence of your evolutionary programming. But listen, Sam. That’s why I’m here.”
Cas can’t imagine anything that Dean could do that wouldn’t feel good. “Dean,” he starts to say.
“Definitely not
. As do a bunch of other people elsewhere.
Dean feels hollow and emptied-out.
He hears voices coming from the common room, talking in a familiar Enochian clip. He wheels himself to the doorway, prepares to say “Hello brothers, sisters” but doesn’t get the chance.
“There’s really nothing to say, Dean. Jack owes us nothing.
Sometimes he prays to Jack. But not about Cas—not like that. His issues with Cas aren’t Jack’s problem. He just tells Jack he’s proud of him, hopes he’s doing well. Asks him to watch out for Sammy. And then, for Cas.
“Oh, here? In—” He looks around. “In Lebanon, Kansas. Because this place gets a shitton of tourists. Especially tourists from other countries. Bumfuck Kansas is the place they dream about seeing. Not Hollywood or the Grand Canyon or Mount fucking Rushmore.”
Dean’s gaze meets his. He’s not crying, but only because he’s cried himself out. His eyes are red and wet, his face tear-streaked. And behind his eyes—the haunted and unmistakable combination of heartbreak, guilt, and some inexplicable emotion that Sam can’t name.
Sam knocks on his door a few hours later, rousing him from sleep. “Dean, you okay? Dean, I get you want to be alone, but … just tell me you’re okay.”
He remembers the Fourth of July when they introduced Jack to fireworks, driving all the way to Salina and parking their car a mile from the display. They didn’t want to be stuck in a crowd. Even so, Jack still kept his ears covered the whole time.
should have been. It pains Dean to admit this, but Cas never belonged on earth—not really.
Dean fixed his gaze on his empty bottle. “Is this where you tell me to get my ass in there? To go be with both of them? Because I’m overcomplicating things, or whatever? As humans tend to do?”
“Are you okay? You were shouting in your sleep.”
Cas put himself between Malachi and Bartholomew. “Time to stow our crap.
Cas put a hand on his arm, but Dean just continued to pick at the label.
Dean especially. You could say shitty things about Dean, and some of them would be true—but you had to admit: he was never for sale.
Sam turned around in his seat. Dean was still in the liquor store. Outside it was blindingly sunny. He wanted to go somewhere to process this. He wanted to be anywhere else.
