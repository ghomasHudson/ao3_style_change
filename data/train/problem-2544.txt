But there he sat, at his desk, flipping through maps and star charts. Handsomer and more distinguished than how Sherlock remembers his sailor. And, nestled safe in his pocket, Sherlock’s mirror bird whispers, again,
He’d asked for his mask to be a bit more fox-like than the ottery contraption he ended up with, but, not wanting to seem fussy, he put it on and continued on his way through the throng.
Ella doesn't push, though she's very interested in my life as flatmate of famous Sherlock Holmes. I'm an interesting client and my case is Sherlock Holmes, isn't that funny? And she let me leave the Holmes family situation at "crazy rich people bullshit" - her words, not mine. I still can't even think about Mycroft.
The book is back on! Life is too boring without fiction. Mary invited me to host a local writer's group at Speedy's; we got a small crowd. You weren't mentioned once--see, you're not the center of my life. Nope, my universe expands to include weirdos in a sandwich shop. A paralegal with a fake flower in her hair compared herself to Tolstoy, which was the highlight of my week. I miss running around with you. (That much is obvious.)
Dear Sherlock,
“Quite,” said Kilgore Trout. “So it goes.” This revelation shed a great deal of new light on the behavior of others in Port Royal when I attempted to tell them of Kilgore Trout, my friend. The most mystifying element of the whole affair was how Kilgore conducted it under the apparently permissive eye of his attentive and beloved mother.
“I love you too,” said Sherlock after a pause just long enough to feel like a test, as Captain Shakespeare finally wrapped his lips around Sherlock’s cock like he’d been longing to every night for months. Every time he touched himself he imagined sucking him and sucking him and sucking him. “Oh…”
“Smoking my valentine,” the Captain says, his voice smooth and full. “Give me one good reason not to throw you overboard right now.” To Sherlock’s right, Mike chuckles and sways on his feet. The ship crests over a large wave, keeling the boat from one side to another.
there lived a man named Kilgore Trout.
“I—excuse me?”
I met someone, Mary, who thinks you're a bit of a pig, from what she's read in the papers. I haven't told her. How could I? I'm sure you'd find my inner conflict amusing, if you were here.
Shakespeare scolds himself.
“How terrible,” I told my friend, imagining Kitty’s alternatively successful life as a Kindergarten teacher.
Had he resisted smoking it, perhaps he would have evaded capture for longer. But that sweet, glittering pink dust coating his fingers when he pried open each cask—how could he resist? He tore pages from his own journal to roll himself cigarettes, and that was how they found him—sitting in the spilled out remains of an overturned barrel, coated in it, tongue lolling out as he watches the pink hazy smoke curl into hearts around his head.
“I’m fine!” Sherlock says angrily, but John goes into the kitchen and flips on the light. He swears again at the damage from Sherlock’s earlier fit, but fills one of the remaining intact glasses from the tap and attempts to guide Sherlock into a chair.
“Try,” John says firmly. “I’m not jealous anymore. But I want to know you as much as I can, and this is a part of you I just don’t know. I won’t react badly, whatever you say. Just…please try?”
"Please," she dismisses. "John Watson is as likely to cheat as you are to set fire to a Stradivarius."
He doesn’t say it. He’s almost sure he doesn’t. He can’t fight the void and he doesn’t want to fight John, but maybe John can fight it for him. Maybe John can explain everything to him.
“Both of you, just knock it off,” the female says sharply. She’s surveying the compound carefully. She’s the only one who expects trouble.
WE'LL START WORK RIGHT AWAY. NOW WE KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR.
“That’s a long span of time, John. But what’s relevant for you… He began experimenting with substances in his last year of University. And when I say ‘experimenting’ I mean he took every mind altering drug he could procure and made rigorous notes on exactly what they did in various doses and combinations, factoring in side effects and relative levels of risk. He eventually figured out that his seven percent solution of cocaine served to relieve the pain he felt when he did not have suitable distractions, and various combinations of opiates could calm his mind when it was working beyond his control. But you know this.”
“Moran seemed pretty certain he would have you soon, if his men didn’t already,” Sherlock commented. “But you thought you lost them back in Zagreb. How did you manage to get past them this time?”
Sherlock doesn't know what he expects. Anger? A punch in the face? Weeping? Kisses? He gets none of these, so he waits, waits for John to decide what to do with him. The silence stretches on too long, dull, heavy, suffocating. At last Sherlock breaks.
actually being there might do us both some good.”
John points out, crackling with annoyance.
Joylessly, almost by rote, he makes it past the guard without raising an alarm and, once inside, easily disables the first two men he encounters unawares in the corridor. The third man who rushes from the bridge at the commotion presents more of a difficulty, but his back-up to hand-to-hand combat is a syringe full of ketamine.
But now it's real. John is shattered. Sherlock is leaving, very possibly forever, going off to die unmourned in some dark place where no one will ever know. Even if he makes it back, there may be no reunion, no restoration of togetherness. Only separation, separate lives.
“Well, it did nearly get you shot. I would think you’d be more invested in the reasons behind that.”
His blue eyes are bright, he’s clearly pleased with himself and is clutching a computer print-out. And he looks better than he did when John had first seen him again, no longer quite so thin-lipped and ragged. When he speaks, he’s a little breathless.
But if he can pull a string to unravel the complicated and unnatural system of control Moriarty had put in place just for him, much of it will collapse in on itself. Pre-existing factions will turn on each other, alliances will dissolve, and both Sherlock and the world would be a lot safer.
Sherlock eventually comes out of his bedroom, but when he does it’s almost worse. John had hoped that a long sleep would have helped him, but it’s clear he’s not slept at all, although he’s got the glassy eyed look of a man sleepwalking. He ignores all casework or offers of it, leaving John to helplessly field increasingly panicked phone calls from Bryant.
Mycroft sits and sighs. “You would really like to believe that, wouldn’t you? Do you honestly not see what you are doing here?”
Sherlock takes that in for a moment, strangely relieved, and inclines his head in thanks. "I hesitate to bring up a subject that may be painful for you as well, but do you know where your father got the name Trevor from?"
He took it. “Good girl. Now tell me, did you notice anything out of the ordinary today, anything at all in your apartment or on the way here? Think!”
“Feelings?” Sherlock spits the word as usual. “I see your feelings as light?”
“You have no intention of letting this case go, do you?” he asks, when Sherlock finally sets down the violin.
“You didn’t and you weren’t,” replied John flatly.
“I was watching him slip away, I could feel it, and I could feel myself slipping away too.”
Sherlock has been summoned to see Mycroft and is in a bit of a snit about it.
“Oh, don’t act so surprised. I know Mycroft told you everything so you could babysit me for him. You just couldn’t find all the secret hiding places!” He giggled.
“I just don’t understand,” he tells her, hoarsely, voice nearly gone. “He lied to me… he tried to keep me away, then he called and told me everything he’d ever told me was a lie, but that was the real lie, and then he…he… jumped. I can’t believe it. Any of it. I have to find out what really happened. I won’t be able to rest until I know.”
long enough not to notice? They’re eating the Earth.”
SEVEN YEARS AGO
“Stowaway, Captain. He got into the valentine.”
“Hush.” A finger presses against Sherlock’s lips and draws away again before he can suck it into his mouth. A part of his head—the sober bit—wants to ask,
Knew I'd scrap it the moment I recognized you. I painted you wrong. You were the version of you I see when I'm not allowed to look. The half-you. I can't stand to look at you but I am always looking. So I play tricks on myself. And then I get frustrated by my own mistakes, and I make so many mistakes, and I wanted to write a story that would get me away from it all, just for a while, but we've really got to live with ourselves every single second, don't we?
“Careful.” The sound of his voice goes straight to his stomach. “I still have half a mind to take you over my knee and show you your actions have consequences.”
“It’s a mystery. But everyone knows—”
Could you just come back, please, so we can fix everything before you do something stupid? Come back so I can brush your hair from your forehead and kiss your neck and tell you I like the color of your eyes. Everything we didn't get to do, we'll do it. I'm there if you want me.
“Who says so, if no one’s ever seen him?”
Sherlock thought.
“Don’t get too close to that leak,” John said, as Sherlock leaned right up against his own reflection. “Your other universes might creep in.”
But another part knows exactly what. “How’d you guess—did you know anything about the
“Yes,” says the hand, head bowed, shy, shuffling in like it’s an embarrassment to even open the door. “I heard you. But I just thought… I mean, since you’re awake, and everything…”
Three years, he said that.
“I hate rules.”
“So they say. But what’s the point of skipping your own party if you don’t even need to show your face?”
“I never guess.”
Sorry I'm not very good at this. I've never done it before. It's like praying. I like it for the same reason I like writing stories: I hum my compositions all day. (The humming always sounds nicer. Sorry these aren't funny.) Of course when I'm not writing about you, I'm writing to you. It helps, though the space you occupy in my mind isn't getting any smaller. You wander through the rooms, turning things over. You're hovering over my shoulder. You're a trick of the light.
And with that, the winds fell still.
“What?”
“Shakespeare never attends Shakespeare’s Ball,” said Sherlock, so automatic it came out in monotone.
The man—tall, left leg shorter than his right, ginger-bearded, wiry, hardened by experience at sea—is caught off guard. “What are you doing?”
Just some clever soldier who talked to strangers in Port Royal.
“And you’re bothering me with this because...?”
And they were

The vendor smirked. “It’s the Captain’s Masque.”
I wish I had kissed you.
he said, emphatic, before straightening his back and putting on what he must have believed to be a humble expression. “Except for me. I’m telling you, what’s really criminal is how little people
at least, is familiar. But the Captain cannot find solid ground in it as he usually does. Isn’t that something, that the Captain might think about the hand? That the Captain might—?
You're being very unfair to me, Holmes.
He takes a moment to calm down, it's costing him a lot.
I always dreamed about this moment, but I always imagined it in a very different way.
Sherlock drops my hand, goes to the door, opens it and goes out.
You may have published me without a heart, but outside the stories, you are the
"Sherlock, I don't know what's going on ... but, I know something happens ... .". I felt the tears want to come out of my eyes, but I hold them, there is no reason to cry, I cleared my throat and took his hand again. "I just want you to know that ... I do not want anything to happen to you, wherever you go at this moment, you have to promise that you're going to return, you have to come back ... I don't want to lose you, again."
Mycroft and Mary were waiting for Sherlock in the car. All three were engaged in an important case that they would not let me be part of, I would stay with my daughter in 221b. But that afternoon when the three came out was very different from all the previous ones, something happened, something bad was about to happen, something big, they did not say anything, but I could feel it and see it in their eyes.
It's just that after so many years, I can not understand why you insist
Mrs. Hudson quickly enters the room and leaves the tea on a tray.
cold and calculating.
Mrs. Hudson is in the kitchen preparing tea.
Holmes gives up on the conversation and begins to walk to his room, but stops only a few steps when Watson begins to say
Well, it's hard enough not to be unfair to one you love.
Sherlock stepped down a step to finally get into the car where they waited, my heart began to pound. He went down a second step, and that was all I could bear. I took him by the hand to stop him, almost unconsciously. Sherlock, surprised, turned to see our hands, which were together, and then looked up at me, he was confused. I wanted to tell him. At that moment I was determined to do it. But I turned to the car, Mary was there, and she could hear me. It was not the right time.
Dear Sherlock,
“What, have you got a message for the Queen about my behavior? Or are you about to argue with me using predictably inferior logic? I don’t do contradictions, and I don’t do time-wasters, and if I’m wrong, it’s because I’ve had a very long day, but please, for both our sakes,
“For the consequences.”
“I, uh—I don’t think—”
“For the valentine. I’m an addict, you know.”
I have a thin, white, horizontal scar half an inch long running through the center of my forehead. This is a relic from my infancy, when my caring and attentive mother pitched me headfirst into a coffee table. A plastic surgeon used five stitches to sew me up again. Until recently, I considered this anomaly unremarkable. Only a month or so ago, however, while visiting my cousin, I learned that there are private, government-operated schools for wards of the state under eighteen with severe behavioral problems. I learned this from my cousin’s roommate, who works as a guard at one such facility. Some of the problems are “really serious.” One girl, for example, listens to her music all day. Most of the time is makes her laugh, but sometimes it makes her cry, and she has difficulty socializing with the other students. I assumed this was because she was under surveillance all the time, and forced to live in a jail where the condescending staff believe her to have severe behavioral problems. “Yeah, but it’s really bad though,” said my cousin’s roommate. “Some of the students have brain damage from being like, dropped on their heads as kids and stuff.”
“No use asking how much time is left?”
The crowd, however, was satisfied by this explanation, and dissipated, moving on to sample some of the arrangements of light Captain Shakespeare (presumably) had provided for consumption. This gave John the chance to approach.
“So you simply saw my ship, induced its history, and climbed aboard for a joy ride?”
“Good one,” John said, going for a drink. “Hilarious. That really cheered me up.”
adoring and honest, astonished and sad, with worlds circling around inside them. John began by kissing his brow. “It’s nice to meet you.” He kissed the side of the man’s nose, then the bridge, then the other side. He grabbed his companion by the hips and pulled them flush against his own, humming a moan.
Captain Shakespeare stopped to kiss his thighs and groin, just to tease, and—
Again—like flipping a switch in his brain that sets certain parts on fire. “I’m sorry?”
Well, it doesn't matter what I thought, maybe. You're gone. But you're a good man, Sherlock. I don't know what happened with Moriarty, and I never will, but I know you have a good heart. I know you. I can say so. Maybe if I say so enough, it'll bring life back to your face, and we can return to our rooms in Baker Street, and you will love me there. You were always a good man, Sherlock: funny, attentive, impetuous, smart as all hell, and a damn good detective. You were still a good man when you were a moody brat. But we covered that already. Just made me want to jump you. Stop burning eggs, asshole.
“Just like you never tried valentine? Never high on your own supply, Captain?” John had no idea if his wild guesswork was close to the truth, but he was enjoying himself, and on a roll, so as far as he was concerned, he had a royal writhing up against a wall.
“I am, very much.”
So nice to escape into this world! Hope my worldbuilding and stylistic choices aren’t too weird, I have a lot of ideas buzzing around in my head lately and this is something of a siphon. Really wasn’t sure about the time jump at first, but here we are! And, uh, hoping to get more into the mirrorbird telepathy next chapter lol. Wrote this chapter while listening to Stabat Meter by Woodkid, Don’t Be Cruel by Elvis Presley, Colour Me In by Damien Rice, and Eugene and My Blue Bucket of Gold by Sufjan Stevens. I have been listening to tons of new music and would love to listen to more artists you like so please feel free to share a song or two you’ve been listening to. I hope you liked it, thanks for reading :)
Maybe you don't want me, maybe you would have done something about it if you did. But I wish I had kissed you. I wish I had sunk into your lap in your chair and tasted your mouth, warm and wet. Maybe you would have let me. Sometimes it is too much to think about what I cannot have. Sometimes it is all I can think about.
Oh, look at him. Oh, he is looking at him. He is almost more pleasurable to look at for all the time spent not looking. With such a spectacular nose and brow, he must’ve looked distinguished and mature even in adolescence, though the thought of his diminutive frame suffused with coltish youth makes the Captain turn away again. It almost makes him angry, if that is the word for everything going on inside himself. He’s touching his mouth again, he realizes. Pinching his lower lip. He balls the offending hand into a fist.
He glances at the clock. Still an hour til midnight. He is waiting for the rain.
Dear Sherlock,
It’s nothing. It is what it is.
“Then I’d have to kiss your feet,” John teased, nudging Sherlock’s toes with his own as he traced his fingers up Sherlock’s navel. He was wearing bright red ceremonial shoes. “Or maybe I’d run. I hear he’s terribly dangerous.”
This is what I mean about failure and the proper appreciation of science fiction. If you do not know what I mean by now, kindly return to the holodeck.
“The crew wants to know if you—”
“Please, sir,” he said, burning thyme as an offering, “I wish for peace to come to Port Royal.”
I’ve been listening to “Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod” off The Sunset Tree by The Mountain Goats, “Terrible Love” by The National, and Strangeways Here We Come. Been reading “Timequake” and “Breakfast of Champions” by Vonnegut in snatches. Sorry again, and thank you for not listening.
“It’s
“Yes, Captain.” He strains again against his bonds, pleased by the pressure, letting the rough rope drag across his nipples. He’s wet.
“You really shouldn’t bring up the fact that you dipped into my cargo when you’re trying to talk your way out of it.”
Can't believe it's been over a year since you jumped. You are as close to my heart as ever. You idiot.
I recount these events from inside my rocket ship, which currently resides in the belly of a whale. To those confused by this situation, who wish to know more about it, I say, “So?”
Sherlock waits for the other blow, cheek proffered, confident it won’t come. It doesn’t.
John shoved his own mask to the top of his head and ripped off the elephant mask so he could begin peppering the stranger’s perfect face with kisses. “Hello,” he hummed, holding the man’s face in his hands. His eyes were…
It was Sherlock who took John by his hand and ducked off the floor towards the entrance to a tall, winding hedge labyrinth. They whip around four corners and come to rest in a dead end inlet with a mirror at its back.
I wrote this several months ago. I have since escaped my spaceship and gone on many more adventures. I love my mirrorbird, which has the capacity to be an enormous arse, when unchecked and untrained, in the service of either advertising, or showing me the patterns of the universe—never sure which. Kilgore wanted to write a story about it called
And Captain Shakespeare said,
So Sherlock sat, and lit a fire, and burnt more thyme and wildflowers and sage. He read the signals in the smoke, and, when the time was ripe and the wind was strong, he composed a new spell, and wished again. The North Wind nodded. “When the debt is served, it shall be so.”
[REDACTED – HIGHLY CLASSIFIED]
“Yes, I have, sir.”
“Have you nothing to say about my valentine?”
but he insisted on
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock says, wishing he could think of something petulant, instead. “Will you untie me now?”
Dear S,
You fill up the page. You are my favorite character. You are everywhere; you make the story interesting. And my God, do I love you. You're always talking to me in my head. Your pulse appears under the words and you are almost alive again. It's the best part of writing. I can see you on that rooftop, or smoking a cigarette, or sitting at the end of my bed, resting your hand on my ankle.
“Ever been to Shakespeare’s Ball before?”
Sherlock visits the Captain.
“I—I’ve never—”
explain everything, I have a lot of questions.
The Captain’s mouth quirks a smile, close-lipped, like it’s against his better judgment. “We’ll discuss it when there’s less val in your system.”
Sherlock’s heart skips at the sound of the Captain’s voice. He’s closer than he expected.
“Presumptuous little thing, aren’t you?”
The time had felt
he thinks, the back of his neck and ears turning red, as he shuffles through his papers and maps and the book, the bloody book—
“So it’s an event,” John concluded, “not just… the modern style.”
“Not in Port Royal.” The vendor leaned forward, conspiratorial. “And he’s fearsome. A killer, or so they say.”
“Must feel good to be the Captain.”
“Apologies,” said the elephant, turning to face John head-on and holding out his hand. John was now paralyzed with fear due to the fact that everything he could think to say was boring. “You’re an army doctor, I should have seen that sooner. Invalidated. How are you enjoying Port Royal?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Out.” The door closes as Mike goes. The Captain steps behind him and reties the sailor’s knots, pulling them tighter, straightening Sherlock’s posture. “If you want anything done right,” he says, “you’ve got to do it yourself.”
“God save whatever populace they’ll be poisoning next week, more like.”
Because to wait any longer would be torture, surely.
Ella is thrilled and fascinated now that I have opened up about you. I did not need to tell her the obvious parts. Sometimes, when I get caught up talking about something insufferable you did, like shoot the wall, she'll sit up, delighted, and say, "and you liked it!"
“Yes, I’ve noticed.” (Noticed what? He looks so grim—oh, yes, the Baobabs—
Dear Sherlock,
“A stowaway and a thief,” says the pirate who introduces himself as Mr. Mole, a name Sherlock is too stoned to scoff at, “the sharks will
The following day, Sherlock made his way to the clifftops outside of Port Royal and waited for the North Wind.
He thought it wasn’t happening anymore.
“In title only. It’s much more like she works for me. I don’t like handling… er, politics. Let alone our rather chilly neighbours to the East.”
but he could be misremembering. The Captain hadn’t shown any particular signs of recognition. The bird took pleasure in playing tricks, John hadn’t been a part of his wish to the winds,
Sherlock concentrates all his thoughts on the back of Shakespeare’s head and tries to focus on the few details he can still recall from their night in the labyrinth. He hopes he can just project the past into the Captain’s mind without having to speak his suspicions aloud and betray all the hope that hides in his voice. Sometimes Sherlock gets so sick of himself. He’s always wrong about everything. A fraud, just like they said. What even was truth, anyway?
Sorry. Got carried away.
war gas, or enchanted mirror birds, he limped into Port Royal, alone.
“How do you know Smith’s guilty?”
It was then that the leak began to behave in a highly unusual way.
Have binned the book. Nothing personal - this is the fifth or sixth time that's happened. I throw words on the page but nothing sticks, and I can't make my mind up about the concept. Think I might be a shit writer. I'd say it was a mystery how the blog got so popular, but even I can solve that one.
“succeeding” is an illusion sold by the government to a failing species to keep them from panicking as their organic spaceship identifies them as cancerous. The word has no definition, other than alluding to the idea that there is something more to life than eating, shitting, and reproduction. In the end, the success indulgences collapse with the economy, and the main characters meet God. God is a mixture of light and numbers who does not apologize for all the terrible things humanity has done. To err, after all, is divine.
“Captain?”
Before Dr. Watson knew anything of the

Instead, Mole pulls Sherlock to his feet and pulls a blindfold over his eyes. “Right. I’m taking you to see the Captain.” He ties Sherlock’s hands behind his back and leads him up the ladder and through the hatch.
says his head again, but he knows that that’s not quite— “I’ll throw you off the ship,” the captain continues, quieter, and a shiver runs up Sherlock’s spine. He wants to press his head to the captain’s thigh, kiss inside his knees, lick at his ankles and arches—“to preserve my reputation, I’ve got a dummy. And you’ll sleep here in my quarters. We’ll put about for an evening in Baker’s Port. We’ll clean you up, and you can be—”
I tell her that I can't shake the thought of you. That I like you. I like having you wandering around inside my heart, you are interesting. Life is so boring. You understood that. Moriarty understood it. I understood it, too. I thought you knew that about me. I thought that maybe-
“And it’s not political at all to further the Queen’s agenda.”
An awkward silence fell between them. Sherlock turned his gaze to his shoes. “I’ve seen sinking ships go down with more grace than the Queen.”
And his hand moans and grinds against his leg, unable to contradict him.
“Can’t be both?”
He half expects the Captain to step forward, slip his hand between his legs, and say, “you’re not even a
sorry, sir.”
A strange noise sounds from somewhere beyond the mirror, within the labyrinth’s corridors. “What was that?” he asks in a hush, still petting absently at Sherlock.
“But how will I know the

you?” John slipped his thigh between Sherlock’s to give him some more leverage to rut against. “I’m so jealous of everyone up in that damn castle... Who can see you, and smell you, and touch you, and taste you…” Their lips met. John worried Sherlock’s plump lower lip between his teeth. “…any time they like. You’re at their mercy. Is that right?” Sherlock couldn’t speak. John had taken his most sensitive strip of skin between two of his fingers and was gently pinching. “Just so you know you’re not dreaming,” he growled, rubbing and then dipping his fingers gently
time?”
“Maybe I like you this way.”
“Mmm…”
It hasn’t been smooth sailing. Wind’s all wrong. And the crew’s trying to keep their spirits up, God bless them, but they’ve been murmuring about keelhauling Sherlock, he knows they have. And half the time he thinks they’ve got a point.
John’s brain chanted.
Sherlock gets to his feet behind John, wiping his mouth, and John feels the hot hardness of him against his skin. John steels himself to take the thick girth of his friend inside him, but instead Sherlock slots himself carefully between John’s saliva-slicked buttocks, holding tightly to John’s shoulders as he slides himself up and down, gliding over but never breaching John’s entrance.
“Seriously, Sherlock, what was that? Were you just trying to fuck with people? Experimenting to see what I would do?” He does not say,
Lestrade notices his increased tension and picks up the pace. “You know, I'm sure, that she and her organisation were connected to James Moriarty.” He pauses and then says very carefully. “When there was a James Moriarty, that is.”
“It wouldn’t exist without your head wound,” John says dryly, to hide his pleasure at that.
“Probably not,” John admits. He flops down on his stomach next to Sherlock and props himself up on his elbows. He says, keeping frustration and hurt out of his voice as far possible, “Why didn’t you tell me you went to rescue Irene Adler?”
It was more than an hour later when Sherlock was returned to his cell, bloodied and bruised, though it felt like much longer. He had never actually been tortured before, at least not physically, though John often referred to the way he treated his own body as torture. He had a high threshold for pain, and Moran was not particularly creative – knives and fists, he wasn’t even original in his cruelty – but he was surprised at his own visceral reaction to the experience. He wasn’t used to being so fully in someone else’s control, being violated in this way. He had retreated into his own mind as far as it was possible, but even he could not fully block out what was happening to his body.
“Yes, they will have used it to get in tonight, to incriminate you. No need to worry, I made one of my own. Come along.”
He fidgets impatiently in his chair. The end of the day seems like years away. The boredom is starting to creep in on him again, and with it the tendrils of fear of the darkness. Sherlock could work on the cat burglar case some more, but without the ability to go after him, what would be the point?
“We can’t go back, Sherlock,” John says softly. “You know that now, right?”
“I don’t know! He’s mad, Sherlock.”
Yet just as John is about to step out the door, the baritone voice halts him.
At home Sherlock is restless and aimless. This case had done little to distract from the overwhelming boredom of the past few weeks, and John’s crankiness has put him even further off. Mrs. Hudson has left him a cold tea – the sort of cheap luncheon meats and cheese he despises, with passable bread – and he makes a sandwich resentfully.
She’ll be out for a few, and so will the hulk, so he should have enough time to deal with the driver. He crawls back up to the front and hides himself under the cab. It’s less than a minute before the drivers opens the door and climbs out, calling to his accomplices. The second his feet hit the ground, John sweeps a leg, knocking his balance out from under him. John’s on the driver before he can even start to scramble up again. He quickly applies the same hold on the driver as he had on the woman, and he goes limp and quiet.
“You didn’t take care of her?!” John hisses to Sherlock.
Sherlock cleared John’s airway of as much water as he could and then, pinching John’s nose, covered his mouth with his own and blew great blasts of air into his lungs. Nothing. He tried again. Still nothing. He alternated with CPR, beating down on John’s chest, willing his heart to start again. There was still no response. This could not be happening. It was just a routine case, nothing special. How had it have gone so wrong? He thought desperately as he worked. There had to be some way, something else he could try.
“And you still feel like this has to be the cause?” John asks.
John freezes, then slowly turns his head to see a tall, curvaceous woman with waves of copper hair, dressed all in black and pointing a weapon at them.
He couldn’t go in there without at least an idea, something to try. And it was unlikely that he would get a second chance if he got it wrong – people who had safety deposit boxes in expensive banks typically kept rather close track of them, he imagined. What date would be significant to them both? They had been together nearly every day since the day they met, and quite a few memorable things had happened since th— Oh, of course. The date they met. That was easily the most significant date they shared, assuming he was following Sherlock’s logic correctly. Well, it could also be the date of Sherlock’s “death”, but John hoped he hadn’t been that morbid.
“Is that good?”
Sherlock arched an eyebrow. “Well, I’ll see that it doesn’t happen again.” He leapt to his feet. “I’m going out – may be gone for some time, don’t wait up!”
John touches the shiny headstone gently, as he had so often touched Sherlock's shoulder. In the way he has when he's struggling to make Sherlock understand something, to reassure them both. And he tells Sherlock not to be dead. To stop all this and come back to him.
He does feel calmer when he emerges, though still unsettled by how easily he had lost his equilibrium. John is concerned too, sitting beside him on the sofa and leaning into his side, the pressure of his body warm and reassuring.
Sherlock begins his usual inspection, scrutinizing and sniffing as he makes a systematic circuit around the house, while John scans the rooms more haphazardly, hoping to catch something at random.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
John snorts grumpily.
“What happened, Sherlock? I thought you said you couldn’t… you didn’t want to… that things never worked for you… What changed? Why now?”
Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice the slip, and gives John a half smile, ruefully. “Wise as always, John,” he says, wrapping his coat more tightly around himself. “Here, if we go this way we can avoid going through the house.”
John takes an elemental pleasure in finally being able to do some of the things he’s tried not to obsess over, simple things like fisting both hands in Sherlock’s impossibly thick hair as Sherlock attempts to taste John’s trachea. Like burying his face in that elegant line where Sherlock’s torso meets his thigh and licking, lower and lower, until Sherlock gasps despite himself, John’s lips wrapped around him and his face buried in a completely different landscape, tangled and dark and glossy.
makes trouble wherever she goes. Until a couple years ago Les Butineuses stayed in Wallonia and we left each other alone. But then they start expanding, moving in on our patch, our business – got some new boss who wasn’t satisfied with the low-risk rackets they had going. And that
“Mycroft may be a cold-hearted bastard with a twisted way of showing it, but he loves you,” John tells him quietly. “Mrs. Hudson adores you, and Greg was the one who helped you get clean in the first place, before you ever solved a case for him. He cares about you.”
She shakes her head. "That's not what I mean. I think you know what I mean."
? You kept referring to
Sherlock gives John a look of calm surprise. “We let her go, of course.”
Mycroft nods. “His personal effects, his papers, his trust fund…”
Mary isn’t any more normal than John is, although she doesn’t try as hard to pretend that she is. Sherlock hasn’t quite ferreted out what it is about her that doesn’t fit, other than her above-average intelligence and perceptiveness. While he’s come to accept and even enjoy her presence, he finds that thinking too deeply about her, analysing her the way he automatically does to others, is uncomfortable for him.
“Shut up,” he mumbles to the empty room, momentarily pleased at the approval, until he remembers it’s not real.
“No, no, no! When he said he’d burn the heart out of me. I’ve been turning it over and over in my head and it won’t fit anywhere. What does it mean, John?” He collapsed back into his chair.
"John--"
Sherlock's been shaved by barbers and servants many times before, though most often these days he prefers to do it himself. Some might be surprised at that, he supposes, given his dislike of physical contact with all but his closest associates, surprised that he's comfortable letting a stranger hold a blade to his throat. But the distant professionalism of the situation reduces his agitation, rather than increasing it. And, Sweeney Todd always excepted, most barbers are motivated not to cut up their clients. This, though, is different.
Some time later, exhausted, John collapses panting and sweat-slicked onto Sherlock’s chest, sky blue silk and creamy skin soft and sticky against his cheek. Sherlock gives a shudder of a sigh under him, all satisfaction and release of anxiety, as always most at peace when John is most in contact with him. John feels empty in the most delightful of ways, now devoid of tension and fear and anger, just a memory of recent pleasure, a husk of impossible lightness resting upon the object of his deepest happiness.
John consciously pulls himself out of his memory, forcing his body to let go, putting his head back down on Sherlock’s chest if only to avoid meeting those wide, curious, clueless eyes. He takes a deep breath. “Then we died.”
She nods shortly in agreement. "And him? What's his part in this?"
"So you're punishing me with her."
WOULD I THOUGH? I KEEP ASKING MYSELF THAT AND I DON'T LIKE THE ANSWER I GET. I'M AFRAID OF THE MAN I WAS YESTERDAY. AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO.
“Sleep now, John,” Sherlock informs him, appearing to fall instantly unconscious after uttering those words.
Finally, he says, “That was Not Good, wasn’t it?”
good at getting people to care for me…as you may have noticed.” He raised an eyebrow lecherously.
He does love John. Of course he loves John. He has always loved John. He will always love John. Often he has been bad at loving John - at least Mary seems to be good at it - but doing what John had asked of him on his return, supporting his marriage, respecting his wishes, that is what loving John means. It makes him a little sad, but it's also, somehow, reassuring.
Sherlock moves and John moves with him, letting him slide out and then drawing him back in, anything but passive. He keeps one hand on John's hip, feeling him undulate beneath it, and wraps the other around John's cock, stroking the smooth, taut length of it in a steady, matching rhythm.
“Yeah,” says John dully, understanding and wishing he didn’t.
The other voice says something. It seems to be echoing through the vents of the house, which means the man could be nearly anywhere.
He narrowed his eyes and scrutinised Moran. “Oh, I see now… Moriarty never trusted you, did he? You were his second in command, but he never gave up his secrets to you. He’s gone, but he didn’t leave you in charge, at least not of more than a fraction of his dealings. In fact, the network itself has probably dissolved into a bunch of little independent operations, each run by power-grabbing toadies like you who stepped up before his body was even cold. Which means the kill order he left has probably been largely ineffective for at least a couple of months now, what with everyone at each other’s throats and no central figure to bring them together.”
John had packed a bag with remarkable efficiency, and had loaded his Sig and stuck it in his waistband. “What does it look it like I’m doing? I’m going to find Sherlock.”
John gets up from the table and Sherlock hears his chair creaks as he settles in it. Sherlock follows suit. The ritual helps.
Their relationship still confuses him, but the one thing John is certain he can call Sherlock Holmes, no matter what else happens, is his friend. He would always be his friend. To have Sherlock call that into question, even in a drug-induced fit, cuts him deeply even now, despite Sherlock’s almost sweetly atrocious efforts at apologizing without ever using the word “sorry”. The verbal gymnastics required to do this are, at the very least, entertaining.
Of course, John thought. He was too smart to pair up victims and framed suspects who had even a tangential connexion to each other, but all knew him from different places. In the middle, where the strings crossed, Sherlock had written on the mirror with a permanent marker “
Sherlock's not even sure he's understood what he's just told John, but he knows it's right, somehow. He nods.
“You knew,” she says quietly. “Of course you knew he would come down here. That’s why you left, so you wouldn’t have to see it.”
“So…not good, I take it.”
She left him without another word, slipping away with an almost inhuman quietness. John returned his gaze to the headstone, trying to forget everything she had said. It was too much, too painful. He could live with grief, but not with hope.
.” Mrs. Hudson clucks, shaking her head. Sherlock throws himself violently into his chair and shrugs off her sympathetic pat on the shoulder. She makes a sound like she’s about to say something else, but thinks better of it and excuses herself downstairs.
John shakes his head ponderously. "Not everything. Jesus, that part of it I couldn't even bear to think about, much less talk about. Even with her. I tried to forget. But I could talk about the rest. I think she suspects there was more to us but she never says anything. Because she loves me, Sherlock. And I... I love her. I love her more than I ever thought I could love someone again."
“John,” Victor says weakly. “I’m terribly sorry to disturb you, but I didn’t know where else to go.”
“Because… it’s Christmas! Drinks and games and all our friends… and you promised to play for everyone, remember? Too late to back out now.”
Sherlock falls to the bed beside John, who shifts himself up the rest of the way onto the mattress and rolls on his side to face him. Sherlock’s gaze flicks ever so briefly to the bedside table, but John grabs his face in both hands and kisses him deeply.
John shakes his head. “I don’t know what was wrong with me today, Sherlock. I’m sorry, I overreacted. Just sometimes you can be so… I don’t know. I should be used to it. I don’t know why it got to me today.”
“Please promise me, John,” Sherlock said hoarsely.
"I most certainly have not. And anyway, I'm sure he'd prefer someone of his own age. In fact, I don't even think he--"
John looks away.
“He didn’t mean to.” Her voice quavers a bit. “He didn’t know what he was doing.”
John looks at him, mildly horrified. “You’ve got to be kidding.”
“I don’t… I don’t cope well with emotions. I never have. Drugs are easier. You take a set dose, it has a set effect. I’ve been feeling things lately, things I don’t like or understand, and now this case… I just wanted something that felt good. Something simple.”
“When you’re warm like that you look like a heat lamp in a sauna.” Sherlock smiles, but John can see his mood is starting to change already, his mind ramping up, his body no longer soft and boneless. He looks worlds better than he had a couple days ago. What little colour he ever shows has returned, he seems to have gained at least half a stone, and he appears refreshed and alert.
John is in the shower. It is far too early, and it was far too late a night last night, which came to nothing. There is a hostage involved this time, but they are at a dead end for now, and John is glad for a chance to clean up and catch his breath. He lets his mind go blank as the scalding hot water beats down on him. He is startled by the sound of the bathroom door as Sherlock enters, talking.
When he's done eating Victor stands and says. "I've got to do some work to do with the bees - time to split up the colony. I promised Susie and Cora a starter hive. Would you like to help me?"
“Barmy arsehole!” John snaps, and Sherlock smirks. “Oh, and that
Sherlock doesn’t smile. “Go stand by the fireplace,” he orders. “As far away as possible and still be line of sight.”
“I promise,” he says at last. John nods his thanks, squeezes Sherlock’s arm despite himself, and retreats to his room without another word. He takes one of the painkillers he was prescribed, not because his shoulder hurts but because he can’t handle thinking about the implications of what just happened.
When Sherlock is buried in him as deeply as he can go, he lays flat against John, covering John’s body with his own, chest to back, hands to hands, legs to legs, and lips in John’s hair. He is still, draped over John, as if he is trying to melt inside of him, as if they could fuse into one person. Every possible centimetre of bare skin is pressed against each other.
“New factors.”
Sherlock pays no mind to the pain, he's too fascinated by the information his brain is feeding him, by having something to look at in what seems like an eternity. Especially when that something is John Watson.
“What? I’ve only been sleeping… an hour? Bloody hell.”
Sherlock tilts his head. “It seems perfectly logical to me, John. She’s sixteen—”
“Why on earth would it be
“Preferable to getting the police involved at this point. None of those men had any real spirit or ambition, and hopefully they’ll choose a better master next time. Of course some may get lost in the snow and die before they can get to town, but what I gave them was better than what Moran would have.”
Sherlock is more than happy to comply. That will avoid him having to navigate the flat too much. He's memorized it well enough, but things do get moved and he wouldn't want to trip and give himself away.
“Sherlock, what did you take? Tell me!” John demands, shaking him. “I need you to tell me exactly what you took and how much.”
"I am not yet certain about the contents of the shipment she's referring to, although I have a strong suspicion. But whatever is in it, they're going to steal it and pin it on Bryant. That way, no mess. We will have to intercept them in the act to prove Bryant's innocence. But as she told you, for security reasons the shipments are only announced 24 hours beforehand, and only to the highest levels in the company."
"Yes. No. Maybe? I can't be sure..." John's fear is palpable and it's starting to get to Sherlock. He can't fight fear and loss of brainpower at the same time.
Sherlock continues, “You, I need to be a person, to make me whole. Her, I need as a counterweight, to stand in relief. She’s my negative polarity. Or maybe I’m hers. We orbit each other, in each other’s influence but if we get too close everything burns. As long as she exists, I can exist. If there’s not hope for her… I think there might not be any hope for me.”
"You were lava-y before," Sherlock says after a long pause. "Vesuvius."
“Sherlock,” he gasps and he feels Sherlock smile against him, though he does not miss a beat in his lapping.
Sherlock puts his mouth to John’s ear and tells him very softly, almost bashfully.
They wait in silence for the police, give their statements grimly, and share a taxi home. Neither speaks. When they reach Baker Street, Sherlock sheds his coat and makes straight for his bedroom. John catches his arm.
trousers? They certainly aren’t yours. My dear, if you wanted to get into a smaller pair of slacks, all you had to do was
“You fucking arsehole,” John muttered when he finished the letter. He knew Sherlock thought he was being kind to him, but it was still infuriating. And Molly knew he was alive? Of course she did – can’t fake a proper death without help from someone in the morgue. And she wouldn’t tell John if Sherlock asked her not to; she loved Sherlock, not John.
He exited the building as quickly as security would allow and forced himself to get several blocks away, to a small park, before he tore open the envelope.
John eyebrows go up. “He seemed to have it together when I met him. I mean there’s been times since when I worried about… but those were isolated incidents. And now he… doesn’t.”
As we are obviously venturing into A Scandal in Belgravia timeline here, I just want to note that I have purposely (and for obvious reasons) left out any mention of John's Christmas girlfriend or Sherlock's presupposed virginity. It doesn't work with the established relationship in this series, so I'm simply ignoring it. Other than that I intend to stay on canon as much as possible when the story intersects with the events shown in the episode. =)
“No, it’s…fine. I just, I can’t think about it right now.”
“I...ah… didn’t sleep much last night. Or at all, really.”
“Shut it,” John snaps. “You know why I’m here. Let’s get this over with.”
At least one other individual is fully aware of the extent of their relationship. Sherlock returns home one day from a visit to Mycroft, beaming like he just caught Jack the Ripper. John is unnerved – a meeting with his brother usually results in a days-long sulk, and although John is grateful this has been averted, he is also suspicious.
Moriarty was silent for a few moments. The footsteps had stopped. Sherlock cocked his head trying to locate him. Suddenly, he felt hot breath on the nape of his neck.
"Oh yes, you changed everything. Clothes, manner, cadence of walk, all the scents of life, your cosmetics, everything. But I still smelled you under it. There's a smell to you James, that you can't hide. You smell of rot. You smell of decay. And no matter what you promise me, I am not going to rot with you."
He hears Sherlock, without having to ask where, reach into his bedside table. Sherlock runs his hands lightly over John’s shoulders, his back, his waist, his hips, tracing the curves of his body with long, nimble fingers, almost prayerfully. He starts kissing at the nape of John’s neck and works his way down his back, following the line of John's spine to where it meets the top of his buttocks. John feels himself being spread apart and forces himself not to tense as Sherlock slips a finger inside of him, gripping John’s shoulder with his other hand, keeping him still.
"Upstairs. Lab freezer with padlock."
John is first shocked at his venom, then furious. “Where do you get off? This is just one date, what the hell is your problem? Did you actually think I was never going to see anyone ever again? That I’d spend the rest of my life following you around and never having relationships or a career or anything but solving crimes and blogging? A desire for a balanced existence doesn’t mean I’m going to run off and desert you tomorrow, you massive prat! Though if you keep acting like this every time I show an interest in anything else, I just might!”
Sherlock says nothing but glances at the bandage on John’s shoulder.
“You’re upset.”
John gave him a funny look. “The end? What are you talking about? Don’t be morbid.”
“Jesus, Sherlock, why didn’t you tell me? After what happened last time –”
John’s stomach drops. “The music you’ve been playing…” he says weakly, feeling almost as if he’s been shot again.
“I’m not observing, I’m looking,” John replies, slowly moving his hands across the impossibly slender chest, the narrow waist, the surprisingly strong shoulders. “And what I see is… dark curly hair that I want my hands to get lost in. Clear grey eyes that see into everything. Lips with a curve meant for kissing. Perfection.”
Sherlock makes a pleased noised tinged with relief. “Doctor Watson, is that a prescription?”
you as you are. I’m just asking you to think about changing some of the things you
Sherlock straightened. “What makes you say that?”
“Hang what the crew wants, and get out!” The door closes again. The Captain, however, maintains his distance. Sherlock listens to the sloshing of the sea. There’s a dull roar of the sailors’ response as Mike passes on the news of the captain’s dissent. “You think just because you can rattle off a bunch of guesswork about my ship, I’ll forgive you for stowing away, smoking my cargo, and, what—ask you to join my crew?”
“I’ve waited a while.”
“If we look at the issue as one of unity—”
and he forgot everything he knew about what he wasn’t supposed to do so he could devote every iota of attention to memorizing Sherlock’s chest with his mouth. “I love you,” he said, devoting equal attention to each nipple so neither felt left out, “have I said that yet? There’s nowhere on Earth I’d rather be than stuck on this ship with your brilliant, annoying—”
Sherlock turns in Mike’s approximate direction. “Mike. Charmed.”
And his sternum, and his navel, and Captain Shakespeare was on his knees, “I love you. God help me, I love you.”
was the small boat from which Sherlock conducted most of his business, when he was not entertaining at masquerades.
Captain Shakespeare grunts his assent, though he is annoyed at the intrusion. Who would be calling so late, after so long? He does not move from his desk. If he does not move, he may not lose his momentum. Always teasing himself along with little tricks, forever playing games with himself. Little habits picked up over the course of his lonely life, to keep himself moving forward when he had no one. This ship. He still has this ship. Or what’s left of it.
“I’m in—I might be in one.”
The rhythm of the ship, the sound of the sea, the Book of Souls:
I'll write again later,
Oh, but how he loved things that were against the rules.
“No one?”

Like many young women, Kitty Galore harbored a secret conviction that the world would absolutely adore her if she only had a platform upon which to be adored. In this way, she was not unlike a nice vase. A nice vase, however, was just what the doctor ordered for Kilgore Trout, Almost Successful Science Fiction Author, and so their beautiful love story began.

found
Why do you have to be dead, Sherlock? Why did you kill yourself? I know you're not a fake, I just know it. So what was it? Fed up? Tired? Needed to disappear? To get away from Moriarty, or me? Was it me?
“…rules…”
You are imposing and predatory and ever-so-casual. You are the best at what you do. You have a wicked sense of humor. You're capable. You're a know-it-all. You're a bit vampiric, in the sexy way. I miss your general disdain for humanity. Humanity deserved it.
“How do you know Captain Shakespeare doesn’t attend these balls?”
Here, residents took to the streets in droves, laughing and arguing, all wearing brightly colored masks and capes. When John stopped at a vendor to get himself one—might as well blend in—the keeper of the cart identified him as an outsider with a single, sidelong glance. “Bit weird, that triangle stuff,” he said, shaping the mask in his hands.
“And this criminal obliviousness keeps people thinking your boat’s neutral territory, even though you’re clearly in service to the Queen?”
You should never trust millionaires, said my friend Kilgore Trout, as he told me of his other self over tea. This was not something I needed to be told. I had read
“Your new navigator,” Sherlock suggests, too eager. “I’ll use the stars. It’s easy.”
It's like the world is teasing me. Do you have any idea how often you come up in casual conversation? Multiple times a week, with people who have never even heard of John Watson before. Unfortunately, most people think you're an arse. I agree with them, most of the time, but for different reasons, so it's not the same. I want to sit each of them down and explain who you really are, but it's exhausting enough to acknowledge that I know you. In my mind, you are a universe unto yourself. I like us best that way.
This was the first time it ever occurred to me that I could have brain damage from the time I split my head open before I was one year old. For the record, this thought has never occurred to anyone else, either, including the multiple psychological professionals who have had the privilege of examining me. Perhaps it’s simply because I am not dumb enough to tell them I’ve had a head injury. From my perspective however, the young prison guard, who bragged about her 14 hour shifts at $14 an hour, seemed a more serious candidate for brain damage than I am. However, as there are inevitably consequences to everything, at least I can chalk up all further complaints about my personhood to the early damage sustained to my frontal lobe. I have not told anyone in my life about this, for fear someone will say, “Well, that explains everything.” If it
"You," Sherlock moaned, spreading his legs wider. "Always you."
Sherlock turned the nozzle. “All gone, John. You did so, so well. I’m going to remove the tube, but don’t let any out. Clench your muscles if you need.” He crouched down next to John again, gently taking out the tip of the tube. John sighed as the pain dulled a bit, but it was back soon enough.
Hiro Hamada: Well, I take the machines out of my brain, and actually make them. Yeah, I stopped the world from being sucked into the equivalent of a black hole. Or crushed by microbots of my own creation. Or blown up by battlebots. Should I continue?
John almost didn’t register these words. “Wait, am I done?”
"Love, what is it?" John asked as his cock went limp inside Sherlock.
"Fuck, Sherlock," John panted, rolling off of the detective. "Jesus fucking Christ."
“Here.” Holmes held out the mobile to John. His mobile.
John's eyes opened and met Sherlock's. He nodded at the detective and spat in his hand as Sherlock rose and fell again.
Sherlock grinned lazily. "There's an open karaoke at a bar tomorrow night and a suspect is going to be there. In order to get a good look around, I'll need to get onstage. The theme tomorrow is 1990s American Alternative, which is ridiculous, but can't be helped. Nine Inch Nails is a famous alternative band from the nineties and Closer is one of their more famous songs, so the bar will most likely have it on file."
John goes to 221B Baker Street, despite his doubts.
Barista:*nods* A lot of people like it that way
John stood suddenly, face flaming. "I'm not putting up with this! I let you do whatever you want all the time. Fingers in the microwave, hearts in the sink- remember the time you put a penis in the coffee pot? I'm so patient with you! Not this time."
Well, his denims were getting very uncomfortable now, weren't they. Sherlock probably wouldn't mind if John just... but no. Even with lower brain function than normal he knew that would be crossing a huge line, wanking while watching someone else wanking without their knowledge.
Jim Moriarty: Fine. I'll see you again soon, Sherlock Holmes...
But not, it turned out, louder than Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes: Serious and quiet, interested in security and peaceful living. Extremely thorough, responsible, and dependable. Well-developed powers of concentration. Usually interested in supporting and promoting traditions and establishments. Well-organized and hard working, they work steadily towards identified goals. They can usually accomplish any task once they have set their mind to it.
"I would turn away, but it only takes a split second of unsupervision," I affirmed. Half of me wondered why I was being so bloody stubborn about this, but the other half knew perfectly well why.
Sherlock Holmes: I did not realize "human" is a language. Let me guess... telepathy?
John's fingers were still tingly at the 'our relationship is the most important thing to me' bit. "You could've just said... I dunno..."
John closed his eyes and rubbed his face, hard enough to make stars bloom behind his eyes when his knuckles came in contact with them. "Quit talking so much. It's exhausting to listen to. Can't you say anything like a regular person?"
Sherlock smirked, nudging him with his shoulder. "No, that was just a bonus."
"You can't help my isolation, you can't help the had that it brings, you can't help my absence of faith, you can't help my everything. Help me, you tear down my reason, help me, your sex I can smell, help me, you make me perfect, help me think of somebody else-"
"Yeah." I was starting to feel rather uncomfortable standing here, unsure if Sherlock thought he was required to kiss me or not. "Look-"
Sherlock Holmes: And that you wouldn't tell me a simple scientific fact about yourself.
The heat pooling in John's stomach, however, seemed to disagree.
After a few minutes, I finally opened my eyes, finding Sherlock still spread out, all traces of his sexual activity gone except for the cooling semen splattering his navel and down his bollocks. His eyes were serene and calculating. Finally: "No swelling in my prostate except that due to sexual arousal."
“So there will be another time?” John asked. At the moment, he wasn’t sure how he felt about it.
Sherlock Holmes: My machine is my brain. Far more impressive, if you ask me. Most of the cases I've solved are government secrets, so I can't give any examples, but I can say I saved Britain from kneeling to a particularly powerful dominatrix.
John let out a grunt and then a moan before he felt his cock pulse in his hand, hot cum dripping down his fingers as he found his release. "Fuck... yes," John groaned as he came down, the startling white behind his eyes fading back to normal.
"So responsive," John smirked, situating himself so his mouth was right over the detective's cock. "You might be hoarse by the time we're through today."
"Then I'll be back in a mo'," John sighed, heaving himself off the bed. Sherlock smirked, stomach flipping, when he saw the tent in John's trousers. At least he was doing it right, it seemed.
John eagerly licked his cock, lapping up every drop he could reach. It was definitely saltier than he remembered but not unpleasant. He remembered the guys in the army always commenting on how eager he was to swallow. Perhaps it had some truth to it.
Sherlock shrugged, eyes sparkling. "I'm fine. It will work itself out. I'd drink a glass of water before you go to bed or you'll have an awful hangover tomorrow." He leaned in to my ear, lips brushing against my earlobe. "Happy Christmas."
Sherlock Holmes: Not Sherlock, gay, and not Consulting Detective?
John frowned as he closed and locked the door. Sure, it was tight quarters, but it'd do for the moment. He turned and rolled up the arms of his jumper to his elbows. He knelt down behind Sherlock, reverently kissing his ivory ass cheek.
John admired his work for a moment, eyes steely. His gaze lingered at some places longer than others- his dribbling, straining cock, for example- which only made Sherlock harder. God, he didn't care if he couldn't cum, he needed John to touch him.
“Only ten minutes. We can talk. What do you want to talk about?”
Sherlock Holmes: Yes. Well, if you don't mind, best be off.
Jim Moriarty: Ah, yes. You merely stretch the truth.
John slowly, cautiously trailed his tongue along Sherlock's bottom lip, attentive for a sign that he didn't like it. On the contrary, Sherlock sighed gently into his mouth, parting his lips further for easier access.
This chat is with Cas_Novak.
"CLOSECLOSECLOSECLOSE!" Sherlock shouted, the sound sliding halfway out as his orgasm built. Just one more stroke and he would be gone.
John smiled into Sherlock's jawline as he pulled back and snapped forward again, barely able to contain the shudder that ran through him at the moan Sherlock made... Besides, he was tighter than anyone he'd ever been with, man or woman... Wouldn't take long at all. He could already feel his orgasm beginning to build in the back of his mind.
Sherlock hummed in agreement as he rummaged through his drawer with his eyes closed, finally pulling out a white handkerchief. He wiped it across his face quickly before throwing it aside, turning onto his side towards John.
Sherlock Holmes: Because if so, it wasn't pop. Although I’d happily drink it.
The sound that Sherlock made was enough to make the tip of John's cock weep. Something between a moan and a cry, entirely unwarranted but not unwelcome.
Sam and Dean: Dean: woah. man? that's a little personal
"J-ohn," Sherlock groaned, rubbing his cock against John's frantically. "I'm so close. It's... Please... Fuck me-"
Sherlock Holmes: HahahAHAhaha I'm Sherlock, silly willy!
Barista:*laughs harder* Oh lord, I'm sorry that was too funny. But if he is asking for more love and respect you should give it to him. Take him out for a date, buy him flowers, when you guys have sex next time, make it all about him
"Fuck, John," Sherlock moaned.
Barista: What about?
Once the movement ceased behind him, he turned to John, extremely mortified by the slight hardness of his cock. Usually, sexual arousal could be hidden by clothing, but standing naked in front of the other man, everything was out in the open.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello.
"More?"
Despite my best efforts, my jeans were getting a bit uncomfortable, and my cheeks were a shade pinker than usual. He hadn't even started yet and I was achingly hard; harder than the detective, at any rate.
The pressure was almost too much. Sherlock could feel his orgasm building as John continuing his slow hand-fucking, each upward slide ending with a thrust of the urethral sound.
"Those all sound... manageable. How about actual sex? Do you like giving or receiving blowjobs? Or anal sex?"
"Not too late," Sherlock smirked. Challenged.
Quickly John spat Sherlock out. "I want you to fuck my mouth, Sherlock," he said hoarsely, immediately swallowing Sherlock again.
John had almost gotten the decency to turn around and leave the flat as quickly as possible when there was another sound from the chair.
John blushed. “Yes. I’m all clear.”
And then Sherlock's head tilted back up, a small, keening sound coming from his mouth before his eyes opened and locked with John's gaze immediately. He didn't seem surprised, or embarrassed, or indignant; rather, his tongue darted out and moistened those Cupid's bow lips, mouth opening slightly and the blush climbing higher up his face.
Barista: Well, honey, It's in the name *gives you 6 shots*
Sherlock Holmes: *giggles uncontrollably*
“How did you get that? And it’s password protected!” John huffed indignantly.
Hesitating for only a moment, Sherlock nodded, brushing past his Dominant (for that was his role at the moment) to the large bed and bent over at the waist, legs spread.

Sherlock looked up immediately when the doctor returned, flagging cock twitching hopefully. John said nothing, only grabbed the lube again and quickly undressed. Without a word, John lubed up his index and middle fingers, plunging them into the detective.
“I like girls,” John blurted. He shut his eyes. Oh God… he was an idiot. Now Holmes would never touch him… which was a good thing…? John couldn’t think with his professor breathing down his neck, literally.
"Say it. Tell me you're a slut," John commanded hoarsely, slamming into Sherlock again.
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, shut up, will you?
Just as Sherlock adjusted to having three fingers in him, John was lubing up his arsehole and his own cock and then he was lined up and going in, in, in, fast and deep and merciless.
Sherlock Holmes: Good. And you?
Sherlock took in a quick, sharp breath, watching John hungrily. John crawled up onto the bed, leaning down and kissing Sherlock's neck.
Sherlock Holmes: There is absolutely no shimmer to his eyes. They're cold, black, and dull. A true serial killer.
It burned a little, felt foreign, but it was so intensely arousing Sherlock felt as if the smallest movement of the sound would tip him over the edge. John pushed it back in, just as slowly, until only about a millimeter remained.
“Nothing. Look at me.”
I knocked gently on the door. A muffled reply through the door- "Go away!"- so I opened it.
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: I have some ability to maintain fitness, by chasing and hunting the wildlife, but other than that, nothing else.
John hurriedly tucked himself back into his pants and pulled up his trousers, biting his lip and creeping over to the bathroom door.
"Don't say anything, just nod," John added as Sherlock's mouth opened to respond.
“Twenty-four,” John replied. So they were very close in age… they may have gone to the same schools. Except that Sherlock was some boy-genius who probably graduated with honours at age ten.
John Watson: I'm back then...
wolowitz has left the conversation.
"Fu- Sherlock. You don't need to-" I groaned, all conviction gone before I even started.
‘My address is 221B Baker Street, London. Please come, and dress comfortably. Arrive no later than 8:00. -SH’
"Forensics. They didn't detect any substances except-"
John Watson: I don't know, really. We kind of live together, so there's nothing new...
Sherlock didn't seem to know John was in the room, thankfully, because the doctor was sure his emotions ran freely across his face for a few moments. Holy shit, he would have never guessed Sherlock could sing, or whatever this breathy moaning was, let alone that he would choose to sing something like this.
"Cum for me, John," Sherlock moaned, teeth latching onto the lobe of John's ear.
John gasped but stayed silent, body quickly adjusting to the intrusion. Sherlock pumped his finger in and out of John slowly, warming his body up. He added another digit then, and John cried out, but Sherlock kept the steady pace at which he was finger-fucking John. Now Sherlock began to scissor him, adding a third finger. By now John was getting used to it and was meeting Sherlock’s fingers with his hips eagerly.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Exactly, he's simply the flipside of you.
Sherlock laughed. “Not until you get to the toilet, no. But you can make your way there. I’ll be in the hallway. Yell if you need anything.”
Sherlock Holmes: Irene?
a troll: Okay. That's cool, do what you got to do.
The actual pain is like intense period cramps, but John wouldn't know that, so I had to improvise a bit.
My hips undulated as he took in my tip and sucked very, very, maddeningly gently. "I want to fuck your mouth, or your arse, or your cock, I want you to touch me, and don't stop until I cum, and then I'll get you off, if you want that I mean, and if not that's okay, but I really hope you do, because I want to taste you," and I was rambling, but Jesus Sherlock had asked for me to talk and if that was all it took for his clever lips to close around my cock I'd be damned if I would stop talking until I was limp.
Sherlock Holmes: I have more of an idea than you do, I'd be willing to bet.
John hadn’t moved. He had stayed motionless against the door, trying to convince himself that he was not aroused and was not actually a bit excited for this. However, he nodded minutely.
