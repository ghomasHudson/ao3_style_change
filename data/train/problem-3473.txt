“... and after she turned me down for the third time, I told her that it was up to her to propose when she was ready, and I expected her to make me feel like a princess! Do you know how she proposed? I was standing there, covered in what could only be described as Demon vomit, and Eileen dropped to one knee, right there in the middle of the warehouse.”
"Next time," Cas whispered, "I want to see your face as I fuck you, Dean."
During his darkest moments, alone at night in his room, Dean would wonder if him dying on a hunt might be what they needed to set them all free. For Cas to find that family he yearned for—for Sam to finally be allowed to concentrate on his family instead of worrying about his screw-up of a brother. Those were the nights where he wouldn't let himself hunt at all, just in case he became reckless—just in case he gave up.
“Cas…” Dean felt the word leave his lips and dissipate into the air like a prayer. His hands were tangled in the trenchcoat that he’d missed so damn much, because if he wasn’t holding on, he knew he wouldn’t be able to keep standing. His knees were weak, everything was trembling and he didn't know if it was a culmination of finally having Cas in front of him like this, or the terror of being brought back to life, sent back to a world where everything was just so horrifically hard. He wasn't sure he could do this again.
"Trying!" Dean gasped.
The horror in Dean's voice seemed to confuse Cas, although Dean truly didn't understand why. How could Cas possibly think that bringing Lisa and Ben back into his life would be a good thing? Dean had nearly got them killed repeatedly, and he hadn't so much as thought about Lisa in years. Occasionally Dean wondered where the fucking Angel’s head was at.
His stomach twisted at the thought of what Dean was prepared to offer him when he'd told him he would give him
"The sex," added Kate, coming back from the kitchen with the massive Yule Log she'd brought over with her. Cas felt like she hadn't been quite right since their dance earlier. Cas knew they should talk and he should apologise, but he wasn't really in a fit state. Tomorrow would have to do instead.
"Wait a minute, your sweaters are-"
Sam had no answers and for a moment he and Cas just sat together, lost in their own thoughts, watching the people walking past.
, Cas. Please don't hate me."
? I even looked into getting you a fucking beehive for the garden!"
In the end, brandishing the aforementioned large spatula, Dean had chased Sam out of the bunker.
"But it didn't, did it? I called you before anything could happen to him!"
"You can't just say shit like that."
He knew she was there before she spoke. Stepping over to his crumpled naked body, she dropped to her knees in the dirt next to him.
"You feel so good," Cas moaned, fucking him with more force than was strictly necessary. He knew Dean could take it, wanted it,
"But-"
Cas turned away, walking to the other side of the room, putting more space between them as he silently sent up a prayer. After a moment, Dean turned, panic in his voice.
"I didn't think that telling you would make any difference," Cas tried. "I'm human now, and I have very few ways I can prove what I'm saying without involving others. I didn't think there was any point in telling you. Maybe I was wrong to keep it from you, but we've only known each other a few months, and this? It's not exactly an easy thing to tell someone."
Cas constantly felt guilty around Claire - every moment of sadness or anger, every dangerous decision she made, he felt responsible for each and every one of them. This wasn't a new feeling, but it absolutely was a new shitty thing he'd done and he had no good explanation for it, apart from that he had been doing as Jack had asked, and he hadn't realised that it would matter this much to her. Both reasons sounded so very deficient to him now.
before. It certainly wasn't a sex thing, because Cas had years of experience of watching Dean the morning after, and he'd always been only too eager to say goodbye to the women he'd brought back. Then once they had gone he would come and watch a movie with Cas, or go for a beer with him. Not that it took the sting out of it all, but it had been predictable and Cas had appreciated that part of it at least. Dean's sex life had always been kept thankfully separate, and it had never intruded upon their friendship. In fact, over the last few years, Dean had been so subtle about it that Cas had never had to meet a single one of them.
"You loved that film! Swayze rocks! Even if you wouldn't do any of the dances with me."
Dean cut off Cas' protest with another kiss. He didn't
"Alright, alright." He cleared his throat. "I'm sure you're looking particularly handsome tonight, Cas. I'm looking forward to our date."
and I was tested after the last time."
"Can't believe that was only this morning," Dean said hoarsely. "It feels like a lifetime ago."
Cas' eyes had drifted closed but at that they shot open. Slowly, his eyes fixed on Dean's, his lifted glistening wet fingers to his lips, his tongue sliding out to lick them clean, lathing them, wetting them even more. And then without being asked, he slid his fingers back over the head of his cock, mixing saliva with pre-cum, making his already wet cock even more slippery against his touch.
An hour had passed before Dean had started prodding Gary. The prodding had progressed to none too gentle slaps before Sam strode over to intercede.
"No, Cas. We
"Fuck, you're freezing, Cas."
Sam looked closely at his brother, at the anguish on his face and Dean felt more exposed than he ever had been before.
"Shh. You'll wake your boyfriend." Sam admonished reprovingly with a finger waggle, his face lit up in delight.
"I didn't-" Cas started to deny.
Cas turned to look at the pathetic man on the floor. He deserved so much misery for what he'd done, but did he really deserve to be used like this? What else could they do now?
"Can you pass me a towel, please? I've got shampoo in my eye."
Cas. And then after all he did for me, I left him the moment I could get away."
He had to be doing this on purpose. It was some sort of cruel punishment for screwing him around, and it was perfect. It was working. Dean
, Sam."
"Fuck, I want you," Dean murmured, looking out at the rest of the room passively, like they were just talking about the weather.
"No?" Dean gave Cas a crestfallen look. "Urgh. Fine."
Dean bit his lip and it was so fucking endearing that Cas leaned harder into him, humming a noise of surprise and affection low in his throat.
https://youtu.be/F5Dp8Q-16SI
Cas pulled back enough to smile dopily up at Dean. He leaned in to kiss him, nearly missing his mouth entirely, his lips landing half on Dean's chin.
Cas tried to tip his head up enough to look at Dean, but Dean held him firm and Cas let out a desperate whimper that made Dean's eyes darken until they were almost all pupil.
"I'm not going anywhere." The arm over Dean's chest tightened in a reassuring squeeze.
"It's
“Vanished. Disappeared, teleported, apparated, sprouted invisible wings and flew? I don’t know—you tell me what you'd call it?” The fluffy, dazed Cas from earlier had disappeared, erased by the small amount of sleep he had managed to get and apparent shock over what he was insisting he'd witnessed. He wasn't yet entirely sober, but he was definitely sharper than before, and he was aiming every bit of his regained cognizance at solving the mystery that was the woman standing in his apartment.
Dean pulled back to glare at him, pushing hard at Cas' chest with his palms to push him away, then pushing harder when that didn't move Cas at all.
Dean flipped over the French toast, and took the bacon off the heat, before turning back to Cas again.
"I'm gonna need you to at least try to eat some of this, okay?" he said with a bossy edge to his voice that normally would have earned him a glare and some extra rough sex later purely to make a point.
Cas tipped his face so that his cheek was pressing against Dean's hand where it lay on his shoulder, then he did the best thing he could do - he listened, his face full of empathy. If he’d have pushed, Dean was at the point where he’d have exploded. Cas knew him better than to do that.
As his chest cleared and concern for his immediate life was no longer at the forefront of his mind, awareness of exactly where Cas' hands were surged to the front. Cas was bending over him, rubbing and patting his back with one hand while tightly gripping his shoulder with the other.
"It's just that I was sitting there and thinking that when everyone comes over later, you might do something that would give us away. And that can't happen, Cas."
Far from looking intimidated, Naomi looked at him with an equal mix of contempt and pity.
Dean felt dread roll in the pit of his stomach, his eyes scanning the room for his angel. In some ways he was so wise, and in others he was still a baby in a trench coat. Sometimes Dean just wanted to wrap him up and keep him safe from the world.
"It's good to see you, dad," Dean said, his voice coming out sounding all wrong. "And I'd love to stay and play catch-up, but I'm meant to be giving a speech."
This was ridiculous.
"You hid Dean's misery from me, so I wouldn't try to save him, so he would end up dead and in Heaven with you sooner!"
“You do understand the insinuation behind that, right?” Well, it was worth checking. This
Dean relaxed into his driving, the road stretching out in front of them, music playing on the radio, a light breeze blowing over his skin. The first notes of Angel with a Shotgun came to his ears on the radio and he closed his eyes for a moment before setting his jaw.
Kate hesitated and then her face broke into a grin.
Sam had hung around until Dean started to contemplate physically maiming him. Dean had threatened him repeatedly, including giving Sam a graphic description of exactly how he would be dragging him out of the Bunker by his balls using an oven glove and a spatula.
He had to admit that getting a couple of nights here had been a decent idea of Sam’s. Dean had played before - occasionally for cash, but usually just to pay off bar tabs rather than for any tangible form of payment. It usually took him a couple of songs to warm up and feel comfortable, but once he had he loved the way it made him feel to stand up there, belting out the lyrics to a song he really liked. And yeah, in the past he had used to use it as a way to get laid - being in the band tended to triple a guy’s sex appeal.
"I just went out onto the doorstep for some fresh air. I didn’t think - I’m sorry."
"Check-in?" Cas frowned.
Cas put his hand over Dean's where it was pressed against Cas' chest, holding Cas back from him. "Only you would beat yourself up over it. When you're honest from the start, how does that make you a monster?"
have to be sorry," Cas asserted, feeling like his heart was breaking. Tears were escaping from between Dean’s fingers, falling and hitting the floor with little splashes, darkening the carpet wherever they hit.
and Dean was just fucking
"Are you done now?" he asked hollowly, and Cas nodded miserably.
Dean trembled, his cock so hard it actually ached. The look on Cas' face alone was the sexiest fucking thing he'd ever seen. But when the fingers in his mouth started to move, to slide in and out of Dean's lips, Cas fucking his mouth with just his precome-covered fingers, Dean fell apart.
"What the fuck, Cas?"
Dean smiled and less than a minute later he fell asleep smiling, his phone cradled against his cheek.
“What?” Kate sounded wary.
"Do you really want me to come there? Cos if you do, I can be there in five."
Glaring until Cas lifted his hand from his mouth, Dean replied only when Cas had reluctantly dropped his arm back down by his side and stepped back.
"Yeah, but you didn't come to me with a halo and fluffy white wings. You came to me all electricity, explosions and '
"You think five minutes will be enough?" Cas shuddered as Dean's mouth found his neck, leaving a hot wet trail of kisses up to and across his jaw.
to be.
"Amara… Amara can you hear me? I need… I need your help." He swiped at his tear and snot streaked face with his bare arm. "I know we're not good right now. I know, and I can't fix that, but some things are more important than us fighting… Please, please help me? I need your help."
. I will always choose to save you, whatever the sacrifice. I would fall from Heaven a hundred times over, cast it aside and live an eternity of torture in Hell if it meant saving you.”
He nodded and forced a smile. It wasn't her fault he was a mess. “Nice to meet you, Beth.”
Dean pushed past his brother and from the doorway he called his goodnight to his friends from far enough away that he hoped no one could see that he'd been crying. He was done for tonight. Completely and utterly done.
Always, always his now. That wasn't going to change now. Dean finally trusted that.
Cas straightened up. "He let you do that! It was to keep you coming back and paying the extortionate fees."
"Look, it's safe for you now." Cas patted the bed.
"You're not helping by being here. This is not your fight and I need you to be safe - go and find the others."
Cas felt like the air was thinning, his head going light with it. It was like that feeling when he had the window down in the car, and it was speeding along the road, the wind whipping past so fast that taking a breath made you feel high.
"Would you drop me off at the apartment, please? I've left a few bits at the Bunker, but I don't really need them. I'll get them another time."
"When I come back, I'll come with you if you want. Just… don't fall into hunting while I'm gone, alright?"
"Yeah. You've provided a pretty awesome distraction so far today."
and it wasn't because of a demon or a monster, it was because of
“It’s okay,” Cas soothed. “I know.”
"Cas! You've got to see this!"
"Did you get stuck in traffic?" Dean asked, sarcastically.
“Dean, you have to tell me you understand that
“What the fuck?” Dean muttered.
Dean reached across the table and put his hand on Cas' arm, making him jump and look up from his lap to meet Dean's eyes. The heat radiated from his hand and Cas stared at it as he assessed this new sensation. His skin was so much more sensitive now he was human, and Cas had to fight to stop his eyes fluttering closed at Dean's touch.
Cas took a step forward, then another, then another. If he couldn't explain to Dean with his words, he was going to show him. He backed Dean into the counter with his hips and gaze alone, then lifted his hand to run one finger down Dean's stubble covered cheek and chin. Dean's eyes fell closed, his lashes fluttering, a shiver coursing through his body even at that small caress.
“He needs to sleep it off,” Kate said again. “He’s safe when I'm here, Dean, I promise. I wouldn’t let anything truly bad happen to him.”
“You could say that,” Sam smiled. “You’ve not told me about your years here though. I mean, I thought Heaven was meant to be this room with your favourite moment on play for all eternity. It’s how I imagined you - mom, pie, our old kitchen, over and over until I got here and found you. But this… this isn’t it.”
"May I?" he asked, bowing low in front of Kate, like some sort of gallant prince at a ball.
Kate's eyes narrowed, her lips pressing together in annoyance. Rowena began nodding to herself, looking like the cat who had got the cream, and then some.
"I'm sorry. You seem nice. You're good for Cas." He closed his eyes for a moment, regret written all over his face. "I shouldn't have come."
Cas wasn't stupid - he knew that what he and Dean had couldn't last. Dean had said himself that when it became too serious he would push Cas away. If Cas had to guess, all this had crept up quite suddenly on Dean. It had gone from an impossible idea burning in the background to a real possibility almost overnight, and Dean was riding a wave, completely out of control with no idea where he would land, or whether they would still be intact when they did. No, Dean didn't know what he wanted and Cas making himself more dependent on Dean wasn't a good idea at all.
"You're being petulant, Cas."
"Everything's fine. I just wanted to say goodnight."
Dean quickly dropped an arm down, closing his fingers around the hand that was stroking him, stopping Cas just in time. One more flick of that wrist and he'd have been coming all over his own damned feet.
"Tattooed?"
Dean was going to end up bawling like a baby if Cas kept this up, and he really didn't want Kate to be there to witness that. He mopped up the puddle on the floor with their towels and dropped them into the hamper.
"Stop thinking about Lover-Boy for five minutes!" Kate grumped, rolling her eyes at the smile that had appeared on his face at the very thought of Dean. "He'll be busy with a lapful of half naked women and I can guarantee he won't be thinking of you!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've taken your allergies into account, Dean. I was watching Friends, and they had this beautiful hairless cat!"
wanted was Dean.
Cas pulled back to look up at him and Dean was gratified to see that Cas was currently looking as wrecked by this as he was feeling. His eyes were heavy lidded and unfocused, his lips still looking kiss-swollen, despite the fact that it had been hours since Dean had kissed them.
Cas shrugged his shoulders. "Anything that involves kissing you works for me."
"You're wearing too much," Dean said gruffly, and he reached for the bottom of Cas' sweater.
"Do you think Kate is behaving strangely?"
"We have terrible timing," Cas agreed. "Although I'm not sure I could actually move right now. Or possibly ever again."
He walked over to the sofa on suddenly weak legs. “Cas, you’ve gotta believe me. You saw me push her away, right? Cas?”
"I'm sure Meg has better memories to explore than that."
"I sit at the table reading my books while you cook my dinner," Cas gently pointed out.
After taking his mood out on his pillow with a few well placed punches, he figured he may as well take it out on himself instead, and started searching for porn. This time there was no pretence that he wasn't fantasising about him and Cas- he went straight for the gay porn.
"Did you know that bees communicate through dance? They call it the Waggle Dance and they use it to direct their hive-mates to food sources, and…"
Cas could only hope that Sam, who had been similarly deserted, would be looking after Kate and finishing their game with her, because the look of fury on her face had been a little bit scary, and this didn't seem like it was going to be a two minute makeout session and then back inside again.
"Sam," Cas said, trying to use his reassuring tone. "Everything is fine."
"I've smited people for far less, Dean. He shouldn't get away with the things he's done. The very fact that he's even
"So much fun," Cas beamed, throwing his arms around Dean and covering his shirt in brightly coloured paint. Dean glanced over at Kate, who was trying to hide her laughter behind her hand.
Dean looked floored. "You didn't have to buy me anything, man."
"Dean, stop," Cas croaked. "You'll kill him."
Cas' hand unwound from Dean's waist and slid slowly upwards, following his chest, then neck, until he found Dean's face and could cup his cheek. Dean wanted to turn his face into his hand, to press a kiss into his palm. It was
Cas let go instantly and backed away from Sam, eyes still on the stage.
"Yes," Cas nodded. "Listen, Dean -"
I also want to say thank you to everyone who has stuck with me through my disappearing act. I really appreciate that you didn't give up on me ❤️
was an understatement.
"Me too, Cas. You're so fucking incredible." Like this - in his lap, in his hand, moaning, gasping, leaning in him, his entire body trembling against Dean's, it was fucking
Dean needed him to be.
"What were they like?" Dean would be lying to himself if he pretended he wasn't intrigued.
Cas' intercom had never worked properly, so Dean took the stairs two at a time, not wanting to leave Cas for long during their weird-assed date.
"We could have a drink, play games, spend some time with the kids."
Dean's stony face broke instantly into a proud grin. "Yeah, I did."
Cas turned on his side, letting his head drop and be pillowed by Dean's arm and it took everything in him not to turn his head a tiny bit more to place a kiss on the smooth skin that was so close to his lips.
Dean swallowed. "Okay. I can do that."
looks to seduce women instead. Dad liked that. He didn't just like it, he was damn proud of me. Then we'd move on to the next town and I'd do it all again because a warm body every night made me feel a little bit less like I was nothing."
“I never wanted the life I was created for.” Not since the moment he had set eyes on Dean. Meeting Dean had made him want things for himself for the very first time.
Next option - drown it with alcohol.
"I think we have just the right amount of sense." Dean grinned and it was so charming and so endearing that Cas' fingers twitched with the effort it took not to reach out and pull him in for a kiss.
"The one and only difference between this Dean and the others, is that in
At first Dean had been so sure that his constant thoughts of Cas were because everything else was gone from his life. But now they were in danger again, they were in the middle of another ridiculous drama, and
Cas couldn’t breathe - why couldn’t he breathe?
"Yeah, well I wouldn't have let you."
He found a pair, grabbed the first black t-shirt he could see and headed into the bathroom. Cas had already thoughtfully put out a new toothbrush for him, and after procrastinating for a few minutes to give Cas time to get changed himself, Dean headed back into the bedroom.
"I wasn't watching it to torture myself with his death. I was watching it because he confessed his… how he felt about me. I watched it to hear his voice, to hear him saying it."
There was a disgruntled noise down the line, but Dean didn't react to it. If Cas wanted to pass judgement on how Dean was coping without him, then he could come home and judge him properly, in person. Some days Dean felt like he was hanging on by a fucking thread.
Dean groaned. "C'mon man. You know I couldn't kill Scooby!"
"It's okay Dean. I've got mine," Cas said helpfully, taking the photo before Sam could try to duck out of sight behind the door.
The sun streamed down, unusually warm for late November, and it made the skin of Dean's face appear warm and bright. The man practically fucking glowed, and Cas wanted to kick him in the shin for it. He took a moment to consider that all his breakups had been with Dean, whether Dean knew it or not, and Cas had handled none of them with quite the level of grace he would have liked.
Not right now, but later, when he was all alone in his bed, Cas would tear into himself over this; over how he'd not known that his Jack wasn't Jack at all; over how badly he'd let Jack down. He'd had moments when he'd feared that the boy he loved so much was disappearing, that the power he now had as God had changed him so much that occasionally he was unrecognisable. But not once had it occurred to him that Jack had been possessed. And every time 'Jack' had made something better, made things a little less cruel, he'd wanted to believe it was Jack's goodness so badly that he didn't look past it at all.
"No offence Cas, but how would you know? You're not exactly drawing on a wealth of experience here."
“Jack's not coming." Dean bent low over Chuck. "And
"I don't think Baby deserves my ire."
Cas calmly waited until he’d finished, and then he gave him a sad half smile.
Dean wanted to punch Balthazar just for thinking about it.
"Amen to that." Kate looked at Cas closely. "Mate, you've got to come out of hibernation. When's the last time you showered?"
"Can you imagine living here?" Dean said, standing on the front porch and looking down at the lake with a faraway smile. "Getting up to this every day? Having breakfast out here? Sitting and having a beer and just looking out onto this lake?"
“I would never ignore your prayers, Dean.” This wasn’t making sense. Cas put his drink down.
Dean took in Sam's patient expression, the covered plates in his hands.
Sam pulled his phone out of his pocket to check his messages, and grinned at the screen.
Dean's bubble of happiness seemed to pop in his chest. Normally he'd just brush it off, not answer. But this was Cas. They had the difficult conversations.
"I don't think that's a good idea, Dean." Cas slid off his stool and without offering Dean so much as a quick hug or a pat on the back, he left.
"At times it's horrific and exhausting," Cas told him. "I need to eat almost constantly, and then I seem to have to relieve myself even more than that. The sensations are relentless and you don't get to pick which ones you feel - clothes rub, hair tickles and I have absolutely no control over my -" He and Gabriel both eyed his crotch warily. "- actually, nevermind."
you want this too."
Cas suddenly grinned. "You know they'll never let you live down being so preoccupied with gazing at me that you didn't hear Rowena?"
"Yeah," Sam raised his voice so that Cas could hear him more clearly and Dean leaned against the counter, his arms folded. "It's in the car."
"I didn't say anything!"
Dean felt Cas’ eyes on him and he pushed his jeans down his legs purposely a little slower than he would have done if he was on his own. He stepped out of them and then looking Cas in the eye he slowly ran a finger from ankle to knee, pouting and waggling his eyebrows in a comically suggestive fashion.
"Cas, let go of my wrists a sec."
Jack take your powers!"
"You shouldn't be jealous," Cas reassured him by reaching for his hand and squeezing it gently with his own, larger fingers. "Anything I ever felt for anyone else was merely curiosity."
Cas fixed his most exasperated look on Dean, and then seeming to have become annoyed with his own bullheadedness, he sighed resignedly, conceding that Dean might have a point. He started to shrug out of his coat, glaring at Dean as he did.
"She's never so much as hinted at having a romantic interest in me."
No. He really shouldn't think of Jack right now. He'd prayed to him this morning, and that was enough sadness for today.
"Cas, no. Don't go." Dean panicked, turning away from the mirror, his agitation manifesting in the repeated dragging of his fingers through his hair. "I just want to, I don't know… manage your expectations."
"Okay. I've watched enough Oprah to know that the cornerstone of any relationship is communication. I need us to work out, Dean."
His mouth was moving over Cas' knuckles reverently, kissing and licking between them, making Cas squirm. He was unbearably hard and so utterly terrified of letting go and giving in to this.
Cas didn't even dare hope that it was true Dean might return his feelings, because even if there was a small glimmer of it Dean would
He sat there until his breaths eventually evened out and then, mentally shaking himself, he turned the ignition of the car. Part of him was disappointed that Cas hadn't somehow known he was falling apart and come to him, appearing beside him in the darkness and letting Dean erase the last few hours from both of their memories. The other part of him just wanted to disappear entirely, so that no one, not even Cas could see him again.
"Do you feel like we're not working?" Dean asked carefully.
As Jack was speaking, Cas had pulled Dean closer to him and although Dean wasn’t sure what was about to happen, he tensed by his side.
Lifting himself onto his stool, Cas warily eyed the food Sam was preparing on the stove in front of him. With humanity very slowly building in him, he wasn't sure if he needed to eat yet or not. He felt queasy, achy, raw and tired, and he imagined this was a bit like how humans felt when they caught the flu. His head hurt and his arm had a scratch on it that he didn't want to waste his remaining Grace on, but it had started itching as it healed and it was tiresome.
"Cas isn't my boyfriend!" Dean growled.
"We'd kissed before, but that was the night we were going to-"
." Cas sounded like he was at the end of his tether, but Dean was too. He'd been at the end of his tether for
"I've sworn off men for a while," Kate shrugged easily. "Controlling, abusive, arrogant arseholes, every single one I've known. Present company excepted, of course. But then maybe gay men are nicer?"
Dean glared over at Sam, who had returned with a bottle of wine under his arm.
"Did I give you permission to do that?" Cas growled in his ear, catching Dean's wrist in a bruising grip. He was rewarded with an answering whimper. "On your knees, Dean."
"Jesus, fucking Christ," Dean choked.
“I brought wine, if either of you would like some?”
“This is how touch feels when I’m connected to Heaven,” Cas said, tracing his fingers down Dean’s arm. “Sort of numb. It’s not like this anymore - it's all buzzing impulses and constant stimulation.”
Dean hesitated and Cas literally growled.
Dean was already in the car before Cas had stepped outside. He was quiet and withdrawn, but Cas didn't have it in him to try to cheer him up, so he looked out of the window at the barely visible trees as they drove slowly past them. He wished that he still had his wings so he could fly away from all of this.
“Again,” Cas growled, and Dean was only too happy to oblige. This time he used his teeth, scraping back and forward across the hard nipple, before soothing it with his tongue. He pulled back against Cas’ tight grip on his hair and Cas reluctantly loosened his hold with a whimper of disappointment. This was short lived though, as Dean grinned and lowered his mouth to Cas’ other, much neglected nipple, giving it equal attention, curling his tongue around it, flicking, teasing. Having discovered how sensitive they were, Dean was quite prepared to spend all fucking night pouring attention on them if Cas would just keep making those needy little cries of pleasure.
Cas headed for the door and Dean, obviously wound up, tension exuding from every tightly held muscle, followed closely behind him. Gripping his arm, he stopped Cas in his tracks and spun him around. Seeing the look in Dean's eyes, Cas patted his arm soothingly, but reading the intent in his eyes, slowly backed away putting a safe distance between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why the fuck are you seeing a shrink?”
A stab of utterly unfounded jealousy knifed through Dean's chest. Unsure if he was spurred on by that, or just by how unbelievably fucking hot Cas was looking, Dean moved to stand closer to his friend.
"You could come and watch me play tomorrow? Have a drink with me after." Dean tried to keep the neediness from his voice. Cas was avoiding seeing him in person and Dean knew why, but if he didn't touch Cas soon he was going to start breaking things out of sheer frustration. Possibly starting with Sam, who was so happy and
"You've got people arriving in-" there was a rustling and the sound of Cas rattling around in a drawer for his watch -"six hours. And
Dean felt a familiar wave of embarrassment, almost a shyness that he just couldn't shake when it came to even just thinking about getting up on stage and letting people see him when he was vulnerable. He could put forward a persona, but music got to him - it always had. The feel of it pounding through his body, the words that were designed to make people feel something raw and real. Standing up there, he was at his most open, his most transparent; undisguised for all to see.
"I'm tired, Dean! I want to sleep. As I said, this isn't so you feel obligated to do anything. I'm just taking care of the problem, so we can sleep."
Should he leave Cas to sleep it off, or wake him and bring him to Sam's with him? He didn't like leaving him alone when he wasn't sure how he'd be feeling this morning.
"Great. Maybe they'll be able to work out how to get us out of here!" Dean bent to help Cas pick up the unmoving, dead weight of the man.
"Do you want me just to tell you what's inside it?" Amara asked, understanding and gentle. For a moment Dean wondered why they were fighting, why she was their enemy at all.
Taking the room in two long strides, Dean was in front of him, so close that Cas could smell him, even above the savory smell of slowly crisping bacon. He realised that Dean must have showered here, using Cas’ newest toiletries. Dean had been right—they did make a person smell edible, like pie but somehow sexy all at the same time. He laughed out loud. Maybe he’d spent too much time around Dean if he was using the words pie and sexy in the same sentence.
Now all Dean could think about was how, if Cas wanted a teacher, he would give his right arm to be that for him. Oh, the things he could teach that Angel. He let his eyes drift to Cas' mouth and felt his jeans become uncomfortably tight.
"What does it say? Is it in Enochian?"
isn’t he? Like, even if I didn’t know he was an angel, the goodness just radiates out of him. He’s not like me and you.”
"Better be."
Firstly, I wanted to say thank you so much for all your support, reviews and Kudos, because they are very possibly better than sex to a writer.
That didn't really help him, and she was on her feet a minute later, chasing after mini-Cas while Garth changed mini-Sam. Cas wondered if the names would ever be less confusing for him to hear. He'd jumped twice so far when hearing, "Cas, put that down right now!" and much worse, "Cas, take that out of your mouth right now!" when he'd just been sneakily stealing one of Gertie and Sam's strawberries. He'd never dropped anything so fast.
“It's been hell. Do you know all the things you do that you think are perfectly normal, but are actually pure fucking porn, Dean?”
“Is it alright if I hug you?” Cas asked hesitantly, looking down at Dean. He was afraid of the answer, afraid of being pushed away. Before his confession he would have just pulled Dean into his arms, but now everything could be read as something else. Every action could be misconstrued as being more than it was, could be turned into something that could make Dean run, even while he was this distressed. Cas held himself tensely, waiting.
"No," Cas whimpered. "The Poughkeepsie move is great, but I don't think either of us are, um, flexible enough for it. I'm sorry."
"And you think people should just talk about sex because it's perfectly natural?"
"And how would I explain any of that shit?
Ignoring both of them, Dean headed towards the door. "If you two are staying here, I'm going to need to get the generator working. It's going to be pitch black here soon."
"You're such a grumpy asshole on a morning. I cleaned up your vomit last night, by the way. No need to thank me - your sunny morning disposition is thanks enough."
He clung tighter, holding onto Cas like he was the only thing keeping him on this earth. His addled brain was screaming at him, shrieking that this was Cas underneath him—
Dean was actually laughing a lot lately, over things that Cas was absolutely sure weren't actually funny. It kept Cas watching him constantly, because every time that smile broke on Dean's face, Cas felt warmth hit him, like the sun had come out from behind a cloud. Dean was singing in the morning as he made breakfast for them, randomly grabbing Cas by the waist and spinning them around his small apartment, smiling for absolutely no reason at all. He was alight with happiness, and after a month of it, Cas was finally starting to trust that it wasn't going to just disappear on him.
"Right now? A three," Cas delivered dryly. "What's this sudden bout of insecurity about?
Dean gave him a look and Cas had the grace to look sheepish.
"What? It wasn't just me who was shit at it!" Dean muttered defensively.
Ignoring Sam again, Chuck turned back to Cas.
"Light."
Dean eyed the bulge in his jeans that even Cas at his most oblivious couldn't miss.
they had been arguing over - Dean who had offered himself up time and time again, just to save this world from itself
"I think this is how we communicate now," Cas agreed, and Dean felt his mouth curve into a smile against his skin. “Dean, what time do you have to be on stage tonight?”
"I truly didn’t mean to worry you. Everything is fine."
"If I stay, we'll end up in bed together."
"I think it might be best that you don't try to stand up - the oil has turned the shower into a death-trap."
It was a tough three weeks, Dean spent the entirety of the first so drunk that Sam went as far as temporarily removing all alcohol from the bunker, just to be able to have a sober conversation with him.
“There’s always time for pool and beer, Sammy!” Dean shook his head at Sam as if he couldn't believe his brother had such screwed up priorities.
"C'mon Sam! Do you really need me to spell it out to you? You know what I'm saying! I'm saying Chuck wasn't wrong! I'm saying that I can't fucking sleep without thinking about Cas every single time I close my eyes. I'm saying that when he's with me, it's like I come back to life, until the moment he's gone and I'm empty and cold again. I'm saying that he's… he's
"Because I'm great. I thought you might need to keep your strength up after…" Sam waggled his eyebrows at the other occupant of the bed, who was still sprawled over Dean unmoving.
"I think that would be very nice.” Cas took a mouthful of his beer. “It might be even nicer when you have some furniture. I tried to stay overnight the other night, because I’d had too much to drink to drive home. Ended up sleeping in a pile of old painting sheets, which my human back objected strongly to the next morning."
Kate nodded and shot Cas a smile.
"I know," Dean soothed, and instead of his face being buried in Cas' neck, he was pulling Cas' head gently down onto his shoulder. His hand slid up into Cas' hair, stroking down over the back of his neck and then back again, over and over again. "I know. I screwed up and we can't go back and I'm so fucking sorry, Cas."
As depressing as it was for Cas to admit, maybe if that was all it took for Dean to reject him, it was better that it ended now before he'd had chance to get accustomed to the casual affection, to being kissed and held, to feeling loved even though he knew he wasn't and none of it was real. He was a fool to allow himself to get so lost in it and would pay dearly for that mistake, but further down the line, deeper in love, would he have survived this? Maybe it happening now was a blessing in disguise.
"Tell me we're going to be out of here before the strippers go home for their breakfast!" Dean retorted, offering no comfort at all.
"I know this is… this is big for you," Sam said gently, as if trying not to scare Dean away. "I know it's not just friendship, or just sex either. When you lost Cas you were more devastated than I've ever seen you. More than when we lost mom, or dad, or even Bobby."
to be gone again. So believe me when I tell you that I'm not reading anything long term into anything to do with you."
Dean helped Cas shower and scrub all the dried-on paint off his skin, then found him his most comfortable t-shirt and sweatpants to change into. Cas, still practically bouncing off the walls, chattered non-stop the entire time. Every thought that came into his head was relentlessly verbalized, and most of them were embarrassingly romantic and soppy. Dean filed them all away in the back of his mind to play back later—when Kate wasn't standing outside the door, offering her ‘support’ every few minutes.
"Yes. Me too." He gave Dean a knowing look, pushed his chair back, and got to his feet. "I should definitely go."
Dean nodded. "You are so fucking blind, Cas. I get that I don't really have room to talk, 'cause it's taken me a while—but how have you not seen that I'm building up and decorating that house for
"I was hurtin' then too," Dean murmured absently, his concentration still on Cas, who was laughing at the victory dance Kate was doing, and had started joining in with it, big goof that he was with a couple of drinks in him.
“I’ve heard he’s more charming and hilarious than annoying,” Dean said, fluttering his eyelashes. He was nervous and his levity hid nothing. Was he nervous enough that he might actually agree to the every second Wednesday thing and just let Cas go back to his apartment to drown his sorrows at home with Nigel?
"Yes. I've not tried those, although I'm considering buying a raspberry one and testing it out at the Lake House. The bath there is large and sufficiently deep. I don't think our
He looked closely at Cas' face and received a shaky smile in return. Cas tried to control it, clamping his bottom lip tightly between his teeth.
Thank you for all your help ValandraEvans - you're a sweetheart xx
Cas took a few moments to answer and Dean waited impatiently, his knees jiggling, hands clasped around a glass of whisky, warming the fiery liquid through the glass with his palms.
Dean didn't react for a moment, reaching for his beer and pulling at the label on it, peeling it slowly from each corner with far more concentration than Cas felt it warranted.
"We're trying to get Jack back," Cas defended. "He's trapped inside Amara and helping the people we love is what we do."
Cas smiled into his hair. "It's what I want."
"You can do
Dean picked up the menu, pretending to pore over it. Cas rolled his eyes in exasperation.
"The concept of days of the week and calendar months is a relatively new one. I was around in the days when your ancestors had gills, Dean."
“That’s not a good idea, Kate. Go home.”
"Oh great. So just me who doesn't know what's going on then? Is it because I don't want to hunt anymore, that you're leaving me out? Or is this some kinky couples sex thing that I don't want to know about?"
"Hasn't exactly been a walk in the park for me either. I don't think they'd ever have sorted a place of their own without Sam losing it—neither of them are exactly homemakers."
Amara smiled. "Sometimes it's good to help things along a bit. Be glad I don't just snap you out of existence."
"We need to get ready anyway," Cas protested weakly and Dean groaned into his neck when Cas scraped blunt nails down his sides.
Dean's fingers tore into the pretty green wrapping paper, that had been chosen purely because everything green reminded him (rather embarrassingly) of Dean's eyes. Cas' fingers went numb as he looked on, and he stopped nervously picking at the cellotape on his own gift, thinking that for Dean's birthday, the hunter would be getting gift cards.
"What do you want, Dean?" Cas asked with a sigh. He didn’t have the energy for this.
"I want to fuck you until you can't fucking walk. I want to make you moan my name around my cock." Dean watched Cas' unreadable expression and wanted to shake a reaction from him. Why wasn't he angry?
Cas closed his eyes.
"Shit Cas," Dean swore, holding both his hands up to show Cas he was safe. "What have I done?"
Cas thought that clearing the room of angry hunters was going unbelievably smoothly, all things considered. That was until Claire shook off Sam's hand in much the same way Dean had just shaken Cas' off of him.
Dean finally met Cas’ eyes and Cas swallowed down the urge to kiss every bit of his pain away.
"I didn't tell you that. Chuck did and he's a spiteful ass."
With timing that did nothing to endear her to Dean, Kate appeared at their table.
had been a bit of an unfounded nickname for him - human Cas was a decent enough fighter. A master strategist, and he had the moves and the reflexes besides, but without the inhuman strength he was half as effective as he used to be. Most importantly, whether he was human or angel Cas didn't seem to be capable of
Dinner was nice. Eileen and Sam were the happiest Dean had seen them, and half the night was spent discussing their wedding, which they'd decided was going to be a small, traditional church wedding despite Dean trying to talk them into travelling and having it on the beach.
"I'll help you sleep," Dean vowed, and to Cas' ears it sounded like Dean thought he was a knight that had accepted a quest, and on his very honour he would fulfil it.
“Why are you here, Chuck?” Sam snapped, still catching his breath. "What the fuck possessed you to come here?"
"I meant it about being willing to do
"I was a mess before you even picked up the phone," Dean admitted, his mouth brushing against Cas' neck as he spoke. He let his tongue dart out, tasting Cas' skin for just a moment, but long enough to make the angel's breath catch in his throat.
"How come everything becomes less confusing the moment I put my arms around you?" Cas murmured, echoing the same thought that was going through Dean's mind.
Cas nodded in agreement.
Tearing his eyes away, he edged past Dean and quietly pushed open the door to his room. Pulling out his blue and grey striped blanket, his favourite because of how soft it felt against his skin, Cas tiptoed back out of the room and eyed the sleeping man contemplatively.
And with that, a dam seemed to break in Dean. Silent tears turned into sobs that shook his entire body. The months of desolation, the shame, the loss and guilt, all pushed down, hidden deep inside so that his little brother wouldn't see it, so Sam could be happy instead of worrying about him constantly. It had all finally surfaced and it hurt. It hurt so much that Dean was breaking apart in front of Cas' eyes.
They were comforting sounds, but he couldn't relax. He was no closer to figuring out how to best approach Dean, how best to convince him that changes needed to be made, that his life had value. He was holding out hope that Dean had calmed down overnight and would maybe seek Cas out himself. They did have a lot to catch up on, and if they could put Cas' confession of love behind them, they could get back to being friends again.
Dean opened his eyes to look at Cas, watchful and wary, like a dog that had been kicked one too many times and had finally given up on the entire human race.
“You’re scared,” Dean repeated. “Why?”
Dean pulled back, his eyes searching Cas’ face wordlessly for more than a minute, watching as Cas trembled in his arms, half wishing he could hide, but refusing to look away as if he had something to be ashamed of.
"Do you think I was just pretending to care about you all these years?" Dean asked, running his fingers through his hair in frustration, making it stand up in all directions. "Do you think I'm made of stone, Cas?"
"It's all dad taught him to be. Any time Dean tried to have anything for himself, dad would make sure he felt so shit about it that he stopped even trying.”
loved, Dean. You’re so very loved.”
"Cas…"
Cas winced and even Dean had the grace to look guilty. Neither of them had thought about that when they'd planned this.
“Are you enjoying it?” Cas asked curiously, sensibly changing the subject. “Being on stage, singing, performing? ”
"I think you'll survive." Cas was smiling, eyes crinkled, pearly white teeth showing. It was absolutely fucking gorgeous.
"Let me make this up to you," Cas pleaded, and using his other hand, Cas reached for Dean's hip. Lowering his eyelashes to look up at Dean through them, Cas fixed Dean with a look that he hoped came across as very obviously seductive.
"I don't know, it looked pretty intense to me."
(See the end of the chapter for
family, Castiel. Doof or not."
can't even tell."
"I can feel how hard it makes you, Dean. You can't deny it, can't hide it from me." He pushed his hand down Dean's jeans, not bothering to unfasten them. Cas' hand wrapped tightly around his cock. "I can feel how much you want me to be rough with you, how much you want me to hold you down and just do what I want—
"But you do know his name," Cas pointed out suspiciously.
"I can see how that could happen."
"Eileen has an ex hunter friend she thinks Dean might get on well with. Maybe setting him up on a date would help?" Sam was looking at Cas, obviously gauging his reaction and Cas made sure to keep his expression as neutral as possible.
They would be old men in their rocking chairs on the Lake House porch, and his heart would still beat harder every time Cas looked at him with that little smile, or that little look of need, or that exasperated glare—hell, Cas only had to look at him full stop to get his heart pounding. He was so in love that he'd turned into a sap and he didn't even care. He'd be walking on air every single day if the love of his life wasn't hundreds, maybe thousands of miles away from him, risking his life searching for celestial beings that didn't want to be found.
Yeah, like this wasn't
Sam had it open and was reading it before Cas had finished inspecting the 'creepy' doll. Wordlessly he handed the letter over for Dean and Cas to read.
legs if he didn't shut up.
Dean had torn all of the pages out of the books and had filled a large metal can with them. He patted his pockets, looking for his lighter, grinning triumphantly when he found it.
"Oh, so now I'm your friend, am I? Good to know." Dean's eyes were steely.
“Dean?”
Cas froze. "What?"
"Apparently it's what we do," Cas eventually said, resignedly. "Sam, can-"
"I know."
There was a silence, then—
"I came back! More than once! You and Sam were free, hanging out in bars like you did before things got complicated. Hunting, drinking, women - there was no place for me anymore and that's okay. It wasn't meant to be forever."
"Go back into witness protection?" Gabriel finished for him. "You know that Jack - or more, Amara - brought back every Angel and demon? The demons went straight into The Big House in Hell, and we all thought there would be some grand plan for us Angels. Sure, there are no wars to fight now, but there were still demons on the planet, still humanity to save, orgies to attend."
Dean's fingers hooked into the top of his jeans and pulled them slowly down, sinking down with them as he did until he was crouched by Cas' feet. Cas swallowed thickly, watching Dean through hooded eyes as he dragged the denim down each leg in turn.
"Horsey!"
"You buy pie," Cas pointed out. "And beer."
treat him like a small child who can’t take care of himself—"
Cas couldn't argue with that. The beautiful wooden panelling of the walls overlapped and gave the house that cabin in the woods kind of feel, despite it being very much a two story house complete with warm red slate roof and old fashioned latticed windows criss-crossed with beautiful patterns in black lead. Two of the windows were cracked and one was broken entirely, but it was easy to see how lovely it would have looked before it was abandoned.
The shower just reminded him of everything he didn't need to be reminded of. He wondered if he should be thankful they hadn't had more sex to ruin other everyday activities for him. The fresh clothes did make him feel a little bit better, and in the ten minutes he'd been gone, Kate had dug into tidying his apartment, which Cas had been too down to do. It had been strewn with trash, food packets that he hadn't bothered to put in the bin and leftover food he hadn't been able to force down. It looked like a different place entirely by the time she'd finished.
His voice heightened in pitch, taking on an element of hysteria.
"Dean," Cas pleaded, holding on tighter as if that would somehow stop the rush of emotions that were taking his breath away, making him sway on his feet. "Please don't... I can't…"
He yanked open the door to the Bunker and stormed inside. Cas hesitated for a moment, then growled under his breath and followed him.
"The shows just seem better when Sam's paying for them."
Trees lined the road, some thick, green and dense, others bare and sparse, having lost almost all their leaves for winter. It was a cold but sunny day, but there was so little light coming through the densely packed trees, that it was almost dark inside the car. Cas would have called it gloomy but it was too
Dean's mouth was perfect, the taste of him like a drug that Cas had been trying desperately to kick, and tasting it again was like he had never stopped. If Cas hadn't needed to breathe, he wasn't sure the kiss would ever have stopped. But pulling air in through his nose was no longer enough—the kiss was so much, so overwhelming, so fucking perfect that Cas had to pull back from it, panting, gasping for breath. And in response Dean smiled, pulling him back in for a brief kiss, then pressing their foreheads together.
Patience disappeared into the hallway with Eileen and Garth. Cas turned back to Dean - having no idea how to stop this, but knowing he had to do
. Try again."
Luckily, although adult conversation couldn’t sufficiently distract him, Cas had discovered that children absolutely refused to settle for just a portion of anyone’s attention. They demanded complete concentration and attentiveness, and as Gertie seemed to have taken a bit of a shine to him, he was sufficiently distracted for a good portion of the afternoon. Eventually, Cas had started telling Gertie stories about when all the Angels were together, living in Heaven. The little girl seemed particularly fond of hearing about the various pranks Gabriel had pulled, and over a ridiculous amount of years, there were a
"Run that by me again?" Kate asked, pronouncing her words slowly and carefully, as if talking to someone who wasn’t quite all there.
"No, nothing like that."
"Close your eyes," Cas instructed. "You remember how it feels to hold my hand, don't you? My fingers curling around your fingers, my palm pressing against yours, my thumb stroking over your skin?"
Cas hated this. He hated that he'd made Kate feel like this, he hated that she was right—he
“Tell me the day will get better?” he pleaded, noticing the longer than usual stubble, the sleep-mussed hair and the awesome ‘just fucked-ness’ of him.
free will.
“You’re seeing this, right?” Dean asked, turning to Sam.
A cross between a growl and a moan left Dean's throat at Cas’ words. His fingers loosened in Cas' hair, moving to massage his scalp instead, soothing where he’d pulled the hair tight. Dean dragged Cas back up to him until their chests were pressed together, their foreheads touching. Both men breathed hard, trying to catch their breath and Dean was shaking his head slowly, his forehead bumping against Cas’ as if denying the truth in the words he’d demanded from Cas.
Cas didn't want to talk this out, not anymore. He'd been such a fool to think that Dean had cared about him. It hadn’t been that Cas had ever thought that Dean had feelings for him, but he had been duped into believing that their friendship had meant something to him. Cas remembered vividly the way he’d felt last time he’d become human - the constant sinking feeling of loneliness, the knowledge that he wasn’t important, wasn’t loved. It all came back to him in a clenching pang of misery and uncertainty.
as Dean plundered his mouth.
if that didn't just make Dean that much harder.
“Hey. Look at me,” Cas said, his voice not quite steady. He waited until Dean had lifted his head to meet his eyes. “I want you so much that I can’t keep my hands steady when I touch you—I shake, Dean. I want you so much that I’ve been afraid to let myself let go, in case I lose myself so completely I can never find a way back. I want you so much that I’m prepared to give you everything—all of me, for as long as you want it, for as long as you want
Cas' thighs had fallen apart, trembling as Dean slid a hand down his side until he could grip his hip, guiding himself with his other hand.
Cas' cock jumped at his words, his hand speeding up, his wrist twisting each time he reached the head of his cock and Dean remembered how much he'd loved feeling that skilled hand on him, how those proficient fingers had brought him close with indecent speed.
Although impossible to see from a distance, when he was this close to Dean, Cas could count every tiny freckle on his face. He had hundreds of them, each one utterly perfect. Cas took in the rough stubble of his jaw, his dark messy hair, his lashes that were long, almost feminine in their length. Then there were his lips, parted in his sleep, that looked too soft, too vulnerable to belong to a man so strong.
"Josh was this… he was great. He was a year older than me, a little less shy about things. He knew nothing about hunting, but he thought I was a Goddamned superhero."
"Yes, probably. But I'm tired, Dean. And I need time to think. Do you really need me there for you to tell them that you can't explain where we went and that nothing is going on between us?"
“They’re looking at all the boring stuff,” Dean complained. “Like insulation and where plug sockets are. You can bet they won't be doing interesting things, like checking to see if there’s room for a beehive or if there's a kitty door for a really scary looking cat that will terrify all the neighbourhood children.”
The Safe Harbor was built to look like the inside of a boat, and it had taken Cas some time to get used to the nautical theme of his surroundings. It made absolutely no sense to him as there was no sea for miles, but when he'd asked Kate about it she had just laughed, topped up his coffee and not answered his question.
me not to interfere."
"Yeah, you have—you horny son of a bitch!"
Cas looked helplessly at Dean. He didn't want him to go. He never wanted him to go and Dean knew it.
“I was only trying to distract her for the first five minutes. After that, I think it’s more that she’s trying to counsel me into being a better person,” Dean explained ruefully. “I keep expecting her to get me to lie down on the couch while she holds ink blot dicks up in front of me to ask me what I see.”
"I screwed up." He hid his face in his hands, trying to breathe, trying to remember how. It hurt—it really fucking hurt. "I screwed up and I need you. I'll do anything if you just fix this."
Cas turned on his side and rested his head on his hand.
"Dean…" Cas growled low in his throat.
"This bunker is too cold. If we do this again, we're doing it in my apartment."
Chuck shrugged casually, dismissing Sam's threat entirely as he turned to look at Cas and Dean, both of whom had come to stand as a physical barrier between the entire group and him.
"Cas!" Dean yelled, swerving to miss the Angel and losing control of the car as the wheels screeched and skidded, coming off the road and spinning in the dirt. The car came to a sudden stop, which Dean was fairly sure was nothing to do with the brakes he had floored - they should still be moving.
“It’s Jack!” Cas replied tiredly, warily.
But Dean had yet to say that he wanted any of it for himself, even if some of this
Dean looked like all his birthdays had come at once.
He would have lectured Cas on using up his dregs of Grace on something as petty as slamming a door, but he was too busy being torn between being proud, and being absolutely fucking terrified of what Cas would say next. The silence stretched on, and eventually Dean couldn’t stay silent.
Turning, he surveyed the room. The TV was still on, the refrigerator was still humming with that annoying sound that sometimes made Dean kick it surreptitiously as he walked past, but two things had changed in the few moments his back had turned. Kate had gone, seemingly vanished into thin air and Cas was sitting up, eyes wide and fixed on him.
A surge of protectiveness filled Dean suddenly and unexpectedly. He reached for his discarded t-shirt and, letting himself enjoy the view of them wet with each other's cum one last time, he gently cleaned them both up with it, before throwing it neatly into his laundry basket.
"Me? It's you guys who seem to have brought me here for my execution." Chuck coughed, drops of blood hitting Cas's boots. Cas guessed that a broken rib had speared his lung and he tried to stamp down on his sense of the wrongness of it all. If no one came to save Chuck he would use the last of his Grace to heal him the best he could. He would give his last connection to Heaven up entirely to make sure he didn't die, because even
“Who else would it be?
"Yeah, I could do that…" It had been something Dean had thought of himself a few times, but there had always been something to stop him doing it, a hunt to distract him, an apocalypse to fight.
"Isn't everything we do justified by excuses?" Cas asked. "It's what humans do."
"Are we going to have to call you Steve again?" Sam asked with a grin, teasing him in the hopes of breaking some of the strained tension. Cas grimaced.
"You're biased," Cas informed him, patting him on the knee. It was a touch - casual and platonic, and it didn't help quell anything.
"Maybe that's why she took him? Maybe she's worried Jack will bring us together? Maybe it's because he's
orders. Now he needed to stand before his father and, once and for all, lay down the ghosts of their past, and tell him who he really was. It wasn't going to be pretty.
He held it out, but Cas stubbornly refused to take it. He didn't need to walk out there alone, smelling of Dean. In Dean's other hand was a decorated gift bag with a large snowman on the front.
Dean caught Cas' eye in a silent plea for help. He couldn't do this. He already felt so raw and exhausted.
Dean had never seen him like this before and it was both overwhelming and such a fucking turn-on to see his Angel without all his steely control so firmly in place.
"Why not?" he replied, turning away from the view of the street to meet Cas' gaze. "Always happy to help you out with experiencing any of your firsts, you know that."
Dean didn't want to agree, but to tell Cas to stay would be taking them back to square one. So instead he just sat there, looking at Cas, eyes flicking between his mouth, his eyes and that 'v' of skin that practically begged for Dean's mouth to explore it. He knew what it would taste like, what his lips would feel like brushing against his skin, how it would somehow electrify his whole body just from that contact. And he craved it.
"We could heat their coop… or maybe bring them inside?"
"I never needed to be able to."
was attached to Cas. Who knew how Cas really felt these days? All he knew was that he craved him like someone had coated the Angel in cocaine. He'd tried to stop it and couldn't - It was fucking terrifying, like driving a car with no brakes. He wasn't sure he would survive if he were to throw himself free of the vehicle. Better to stay in the car and keep on driving until its inevitable fatal collision.
"They had no way to get the coordinates for themselves once they went into hiding, so once we've checked the place out, I'll pray to them."
“Toast?” Cas asked stupidly. Maybe he could offer to help Dean to fix those tiny dents—to, entirely for the sake of scientific knowledge, offer to see if kissing would remove the blemish from his otherwise perfect mouth. Five, maybe ten minutes should do it. Possibly twenty to be on the safe side. For science.
sort out," Cas denied, pulling his arm away in an attempt to save his sanity. He grabbed the bowl that held the tiny individual packets of sugar, toying with them just for something to do with his hands. He daren't shred the napkins here - Kate would kill him.
"Ca-as!" Dean practically whined at Cas' lack of cooperation.
Cas smiled and pushed them down himself, his eyes on Dean the entire time, watchful and assessing. He needn't have worried, because Dean's reaction to seeing those hip bones was never going to be anything but a full-blown short-circuit. Dean was fairly sure they were his new most favourite thing in the world - better than pie, better than breasts, hell - better than
The plain blue t-shirt was stretched over Cas' chest, and Dean was steadfastly holding his gaze, refusing to let his eyes travel any lower.
instead focusing on the fact that he didn’t really
"Maybe your human nose needs time to adjust," Dean suggested with a glare that dared Sam to disagree. “Why don’t we finish our food somewhere else? Leave Sam to think about how soundly he sleeps and how safe he really is from any repercussions…”
"Want you," Cas growled, and Dean wondered if grinding into the mattress would be considered cheating in his quest for this not to be all about him.
Dean gulped in desperate breaths of air. He wasn't just crying anymore, he was sobbing big, ugly sobs with his entire body. Helpless to stop them, unable to even explain them, he let Cas hold him while he fell apart. He was dimly aware of Sam's voice coming from the doorway, but he didn't look up and the mumble of Cas' response vibrated through him, comforting him even though he couldn't make out the words for the pounding in his ears and the chant that filled his own head.
“Well I don’t know what to tell you, Sammy,” Dean shrugged, feigning nonchalance. He wasn’t going to pick at that scab - it was already permanently raw and bleeding. “It is what it is.”
Finding himself at a loose end, Cas distracted himself by trying to help Gertie locate her missing sock. After ten long minutes of trying to understand why Gertie seemed so obsessed with asking if unicorns could swim instead of helping him, Cas finally figured out that she had flushed her sock down the toilet.
The hope was still there, wavering but strong. He felt like an asshole for crushing it, but it would have been worse to just let her keep thinking that something could happen between them.
The despondency in his voice felt like knives stabbing into Cas' soul. Where was Dean's fight?
him sounding like some mortally wounded animal. He felt detached, floating above his own body, hearing everything, seeing himself on the ground, but feeling none of it.
His offer on the house had been accepted with alarming haste. Dean was throwing everything he had into making it his, and it was working, even with two obnoxious Angels living in it almost constantly. He'd started taking Miracle with him and much to his annoyance the dog had attached himself to Gabriel to the point where Dean was convinced the Angel had mojo'd him into liking him. He refused to accept that Gabriel was just that likeable. Miracle had better taste than that.
Dean nodded, resting his head on the table. "Please."
Chuck put his hands up in mock defence, turning away from them to sit at the table full of food. He turned to Claire, who was standing at the other side of the table next to Kaia.
The jingle of a bell that signaled the arrival of customers saved Cas from having to expand on that and he was grateful. Besides, he needed to concentrate. He was struggling with the 'experience' section of the form. Did interrogating a cat count as experience with animals?
"That doesn't sound like a positive thing."
“Dean?” Cas murmured.
"Well when you've got a plan, don't forget to semaphore me a rundown of it." Sam sighed, seeming to run out of anger. "Look, I'm going to see if I can salvage some of the food and then we'll be spending the rest of the day playing with the little ones and having a laugh. No drama, no monsters. You're welcome to stay, or you can go. It's up to you guys."
"So beautiful," Cas murmured, and then he finally pushed past Dean's lips with a moan.
"Gary didn't think so!" Sam muttered darkly.
"Cas, tell me you really want this? Tell me this isn't just you giving me what you think I want?"
"If you've finished hibernating -" Sam began.
"You've gone as white as a sheet."
"And secondly-" he picked up the small silver dog that was now on its side on the table. "The dog is mine.
"Hey Cas, do you fancy coming to look at this house with us on Monday?" Eileen asked, obviously trying to change the subject and quell the bickering. Sam’s face immediately lit up in excitement and as much as Dean had to admit that he was feeling a bit left behind, seeing Sam so excited was just awesome.
Confident he wasn't about to die a premature and humiliating death (again), Dean looked up from his burger to look at Cas, who had gone back to contemplating his food as he slowly tore the bread bun into pieces. Neither Angel nor human, he was in limbo and Dean’s heart went out to him. He didn't need Sam's ribbing on top of everything else.
life you get to have now!"
"It's okay," she said, patting his hand in turn. "It's just that it reminded us how many people know this address, so we're speeding up our moving out a little bit."
“I don’t even know how I would do that, and I don’t think it would help us with being just friends.”
"Don't go, Cas," Sam said, his head appearing in Cas' vision, blocking his view of Dean. It seemed to break the spell and Cas felt like he could take a breath again. "Dean doesn't have a break for half an hour. Just have a drink with us?"
“Maybe this gift giving thing isn’t so bad,” Dean said, laughing as Cas’ legs wrapped around his waist like a monkey, squashing him in a way that Cas had quickly learned that instead of objecting to, Dean actually liked.
"Damn woman doesn't need protecting. Last time I popped in to see her she told me I stank and sent me for a freakin' bath! Wouldn't let me sit next to her until I had."
Dean sighed and got to his feet.
Dean shrugged, unconcerned.
He wasn't giving up.
(See the end of the chapter for
His phone buzzed twice at 9:08am.
“I’ll shower after you,” Cas said, “And then I’ll help in any way you like.”
"It's Sam. He wants to meet me."
"Yeah, the boy did good. I always knew he'd come right in the end—a strong hunter, with a good woman by his side! As long as he don't let that law school crap tame him too much, eh Mary?"
“He needs you right now,” she admonished.
Sam sighed. "Oh Dean. It could be so simple if you'd just let it happen."
"Come to bed?" Cas begged, asking for what felt like the twentieth time.
that you ignored every single one of my messages!" Sam hissed, pinning the flower to Dean's lapel with enough force to bruise the poor blameless blossom. "If we didn't have wedding photos to take later, you'd be doing your best man duties with two black eyes!"
“I think it’s excellent he’s making healthy choices now he’s got a body that needs taking care of,” Sam said, giving Cas an approving smile. Dean remembered quite clearly now why he used to occasionally kick his brother in the shin at meal times. It was worth the ass-whooping he got if it trained even some of the smugness out of him.
“Well now you’ve got a lovely one of Nigel and I to add to your ever growing collection.”
really want? Is this the life you saw for yourself when you were growing up?”
The sky was shining the kind of bright blue that made you think of summer holidays, lazy days and ice creams. It was the perfect colour to go with the perfect temperature - just hot enough that Dean had an excuse to wind down his window and hang his arm out, his fingers tapping along with the music against the outside of the car door. He knew he looked like a poser when he did this, but this was Heaven and he was damn well going to do whatever made him happy.
"No, you didn't. What you actually said was that kissing me was a dangerous, terrible idea."
"I'm not arguing with you on Date Night, Dean."
Quickly, but not as quickly as Dean would have liked, he finally succeeded in freeing Cas of his clothes. Cas turned onto his back, looking up at Dean steadily, expectantly. Dean felt all amusement leaving him, his mind emptying of anything else when he saw how hard and ready Cas was for him.
Cas was infinitely sure that clubbing was not one of the joys that this world had to offer. Sweaty bodies writhing, loud music that was all beat and no melody, Cas was really starting to regret letting Kate and Eileen talk him into this.
"This isn't one of your stories, Chuck. It's not as if I saw Dean Winchester and a chorus of birds started singing. We don't live in a Disney movie."
Not waiting for an answer, Dean turned away, bumping straight into one of Eileen's hunter friends in his hurry to put some distance between him and his dad before he just blurted out that he loved Cas and punched his dad on the nose preemptively for his homophobic thoughts on the matter.
Only Cas would try to apply logic to his own naked ass.
"A tempting offer."
"When we found Dean in Hell, I knew he was beautiful. Even torn apart, damaged and angry he was
Both Angels held up their hands to show their palms, seared just like Cas' palm was, but their hands displayed the words, "Find Castiel."
Kate had become a little withdrawn and sad after lunch. It was obvious that it stung a little watching other children play when her own were hours away, playing the same sort of games with her ex husband and his new wife. It was at that moment that Dean had dropped the edge of hostility he had reserved for Kate, and he'd tried to distract her from her unhappiness.
"I've looked at them all—there's nothing like that in there."
Cas wasn't sure that was true at this point, but he wasn't going to argue. In Dean's arms, everything felt better, everything made more sense. It was all going to be fine.
"Things to see, people to do," Eileen corrected him with a wink at Cas, who just shrugged in unabashed agreement.
"Yes, Dean. We're more than okay."
Cas faltered, his head not capable of clear thought. “What?”
"He doesn't mind his words around anyone," Dean observed dryly. "Why do you think my parents had to find their own place? Sam told dad to get the fuck out of their
Dean had stopped struggling and Cas loosened his grip, looking down at Dean like he didn't know what to do with him, and if Cas didn't know, no-one would. No-one could help him.
Telling himself that didn’t take away from the churning, twisting, sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. It didn’t help the sinking feeling and the rising panic that threatened to overwhelm him completely. It was a feeling he’d experienced all too often lately and Doctor Graham had diagnosed them as panic attacks. Cas had been working with him on various ways to quell them, but when this one was triggered so obviously by jealousy, how was he supposed to fix that? It was Cas’s own aching agony over having lost Dean in every intimate sense that made him feel like this, and it wasn't fixable.
Cas shivered as Dean's thumbs stroked his cheekbones.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Kate isn’t… you’d have known if she was another Angel, right? Or a demon? We’d have known if she was evil, wouldn’t we?”
"Dean," Kate looked up at him, her eyes wide and glimmering with unshed tears, her head shaking slowly from side to side. "Do you really not see?"
"When it gets warm again, we'll drive out, find a lake and I'll teach you."
"Shut up." Cas growled, shoving Dean's t-shirt up and out of his way. Dean pulled his hands out from under his pillow and held them up in defence, still laughing. Horny, grumpy Cas was freakin' adorable.
Dean took it, downing half of it before putting it back down. He eyed the large dark patch on Cas' t-shirt, horribly aware that it was his tears that had made it so damp.
Cas felt the rising panic in his chest, the tightening, the feeling of not being able to breathe.
"It's fine, Cas. It's just a bit pink," Dean muttered, trying to pull his wrist free.
“Castiel has fallen,” Jack said shortly, a scowl on his face. “Rebelling once again for Dean Winchester.”
Dean couldn't sleep any more. Well he could, but when he did he dreamed. Not normal dreams -
"I liked that movie. We can watch it again together, if you like. Now go to sleep - we have to be up soon and you're grumpy enough on a morning when you've had a full night's sleep."
"Well I'd rather we were both at the Lake House, but I can't see that being peaceful for either of us just yet, and with all the snow I'm not even sure we can get there at the moment. I really need to sort out a big stockpile for winters like this, so we won't starve if we get snowed in."
"I know. I
With an expression that was a curious mix of fondness and aggravation, Cas looked very much like he was about to climb off the bed and off of Dean, which was something Dean really, really didn't want.
shit. And frankly, I don’t think he believes most of what I’m saying, but we’ve agreed to work in metaphors.”
"Sorry?" Dean asked faintly, dazedly. "You—you're sorry?!"
The door to the shower opened a few inches and an arm waved out of the gap, glistening with water, the steam rising from his skin a testament to how hot the weird, heat-craving Angel liked to have his showers. Dean stamped out the fantasies he'd been having of him and Cas sharing that massive bath together. He'd end up coming out of it looking and feeling like a well-moisturized lobster.
Any moment now, Cas would get off his lap and leave him. He should. He absolutely fucking should. Dean would tell him to, if he wasn't such an abject coward, if he wasn't so selfish that he was hanging on to every second he had left of having Cas in his arms.
Claire caught Cas' eye and he tried to smile back, tried to pretend he was okay, but he wasn't. This wasn't okay. He couldn't be here for this. He needed to find an excuse to leave before they reemerged, flushed and glassy eyed, mouths swollen, clothes askew. There was a good chance that if they did that, Cas would actually vomit up his Christmas lunch in front of everyone.
Cas climbed off of Dean with shaking legs and sat crossed legged next to him instead. His hands were still unsteady as they trailed down Dean's chest, sending little shocks of pleasure down his spine. Cas eyed the tented boxers, complete with evident wet patch and looked at Dean almost shyly, his sassiness fading into the background now he wasn't half blinded by lust.
Hands were fluttering against his sides, fingers digging into his hips, but still Cas wasn't
"How fucking sexist are you? I do all the washing at home. Wait until I tell Eileen…"
Cas sighed, narrowing his eyes in annoyance. "I could chain you to me so you can't go anywhere, but I don't think that's very healthy for either of us."
When they were ten minutes away from the Bunker, Cas finally spoke.
you, Cas."
Cas away for so long that Dean started to panic. Was Cas full of regret over what happened? Was he freaking out in there? Dean was just about to get back out of bed to check on him when Cas appeared in the doorway.

kick me out, before I go boiling your bunny or something."
"Your safe word is Geronimo," he told Dean, and then pushed past his lips into his eagerly waiting mouth.
"So do you," Sam told Dean thickly. "After everything - you deserve it more than any of us."
“You don’t have to do anything, except stay alive,” Cas soothed. “I don’t expect anything else. We’ll work on the rest.”
you. And it will live on long after you're dead and gone."
wine, sir," Sam said, presenting the bottle with a flourish and then pouring a little into Dean's glass for him to taste. Dean gulped it down, barely registering whether or not it tasted good. He wasn't much of a wine drinker, but any alcohol would do when it was being handed to him.
"Once a week Dean and Claire phone each other to make sure neither one has been injured or is missing. I'm surprised he hasn't said," Jody explained, giving Cas a hug on her way to greet Dean and Sam who had left the kitchen especially to say hello.
for Dean to sit at the same time, but over the past month they'd got into a routine where Dean would sit, and his ridiculously sensory-seeking boyfriend would crawl into his lap, resting his head on Dean's knee. He would angle his neck so it was in the perfect position for Dean to stroke and tickle with his fingertips, and they’d go through the entire film with Cas sighing quietly and contentedly under his hands.
"What the hell did you guys expect would happen to you in here?"
“Cas wouldn’t mind if I stayed,” Kate murmured, looking up at Dean with pleading eyes.
"Why? Are you gonna ask to speak to my manager?" Dean put him on speakerphone anyway. "And I've got moves! If you were really here I'd be wooing your brains out right now."
He'd never been like this over someone, and the point now was that he had to ignore how he felt entirely, so they could be friends again. But it was like all of a sudden he'd forgotten what it was like to have an actual friend—forgotten what it was like to hold a normal conversation that wasn't punctuated with touches and kisses. They'd been 'together' for no time at all, yet Dean had become inept and conversationally clumsy, constantly second guessing himself. And this wasn't him, he wasn't like this! When he wanted something, he went for it. Wanting something and going out of his way not to have it just went against everything that he was.
He leaned down so close to Cas that for a single moment Cas was convinced he was going to kiss him, but then Dean's lips were brushing against his ear and Cas groaned low in his throat, although he couldn’t say if it was from disappointment, or the way the sensations were going straight from his ear to his groin.
"Shit. I'm the worst fucking best man."
with Cas brought back some pretty terrifying memories of the other Cas he'd once met - the one with stubble, a fatalistic sense of humour and women on tap. Someone would definitely need to steer Cas away from that direction.
It felt like it had been centuries since they had been like this. Decades upon decades since he'd tasted Dean's mouth like this, since the heat had built up inside him in this way, curling in his stomach, making him pour every single emotion he was feeling into this kiss, as if it were all there was in the world, all they would ever have.
"I'm not avoiding you," Dean denied, leaning one hip against the door frame in a position that exuded attitude and insolence.
"Hang on, I’m going to put music on.” Dean climbed out of bed, wincing as the cold air instantly worked to chill his skin. The bunker really did need some central heating putting in. A soft rock radio station started playing and Dean fiddled with the sound until it drowned out the sound of Sam’s TV. He got back into bed with a contented sigh, pulling the switch of his lamp and plunging the room into darkness. Like this, in the dark with none of his senses able to tell him he was delusional, Dean could convince himself that he wasn’t on the phone to Cas at all, that he was there with him instead, in his bed, close enough for that gruff voice of his to be right in his ear.
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry," she shrugged.
“I didn’t see
“Morning Dean.” Sam’s big doe eyes were just heartbreaking and Dean sighed resignedly.
Cas took in Sam’s kind eyes, his forehead wrinkled in concern, the floppy hair that Dean threatened to shave off while he slept at least once a fortnight. He was a good man who very much deserved the happy ending he would get, but Cas had felt the sadness radiating from him in the timeline he had so effectively destroyed. Sam too would live a much happier life if Dean survived to be part of it all.
“You’ll be okay. We’ll be okay.”
Cas was at least replying to his texts, but there was tension there. A forced lightness that didn't feel real. He was still talking to Sam normally though, and it was through Sam that Dean found out Cas was coming over for a board game night. Trying not to think too hard about it, Dean couldn't help but read into it that Cas could cope with being around him as long as he had a chaperone so that Dean didn’t jump his bones. Which was fair enough really, Dean did have previous.
"You'd know if I was being hostile, Kate," Dean snapped, in an admittedly fairly hostile manner, before taking a deliberate breath. She was tense, breathing hard, as if she was preparing for a fight he wasn’t going to have with her. “Look, I’m sorry. It’s been a long night.”
Dean scrubbed his face with his hands. “You were a pain in the ass, but it was me who screwed things up. Go to Eileen. I’ve got a date with some single malt and a whole load of porn.”
want?"
Cas opened his mouth to answer, but Dean cut him off.
“Sam, get off me,” Dean fought against Sam’s grip. “I’m going to give Bruce Almighty here what’s coming to him.”
For a moment Dean truly didn't know how to respond. Then, "I washed my sweatpants. That's effort."
Kate hesitated, looking down at Cas with a sigh that made Dean instantly annoyed. How dare she sigh at Cas like he was inconveniencing her?
whose hands had slid under his robe to find and caress hot, bare skin.
In all that time, all those years, he'd never once touched Dean unless he'd been entirely sure it was welcome, or unless it had been entirely essential in saving his life. He wasn't sure what was making him so weak against temptation now - maybe his humanity was eroding his sense of right and wrong? Maybe the confession, the acknowledgement of how he felt about Dean had turned everything on its head and set him free? All he knew was that he was struggling to stay strong, to walk away, to not kiss Dean, just once before he left for good.
"I know," Cas smiled, kissing Dean softly. "You don't need to say it for me to feel it every time you look at me like this."
Kate nodded in agreement. "And how about you, Dean?"
Cas just stared at him in mild alarm as Dean finally reached him, his arms outstretched a bit like a toddler, running to a parent. Thankfully that was where the similarities ended, as suddenly a freezing cold hand cupped his cheek. Cas immediately leaned into it with a smile. He refused to flinch away from Dean's hands, ever. If Dean's touch was fire itself, Cas knew he would have gladly burned away under it.
"Harder." Cas' eyes were squeezed tightly shut, his face set in an expression that could just as easily have been pleasure or pain. As Dean snapped his hips and dove deeper into his lover, he knew by the sharp intake of breath and the way Cas' lips parted to let out low, needy moans that he was hitting his sweet spot perfectly with every thrust.
"Thank you for the rescue," Cas murmured quietly, so that Kate couldn't overhear. "She is tenacious to the extreme."
"Has Cas ever met yours?" Dean's jaw was set and Kate visibly bristled.
Dean should have been able to touch it all, to pick it up and remember Cas with it, but right now even the thought of just reaching out for it made his skin crawl. This wasn't like any of the other times he'd lost Cas—this felt like it was the end of everything. What was he supposed to do now?
of the beings you create. You can influence lives, but not who people are and how they think."
He picked up the remote, found Gilmore Girls on Netflix, and pressed play. It was safe, happy, and calming, and he knew that Cas wasn't going to go off into any TV inspired hallucinations based on what he was watching. If he did, they'd likely involve donuts and giant cups of coffee, and Cas could probably handle that.
"Sorry, Mrs Findlay." Dean did his best to look contrite. "My brother is getting married, my parents are back from the dead and I didn't even have time to screw my boyfriend this morning. And have you seen his ass today?"
“We’ll talk about this later,” Cas said, firmly.
It suddenly occurred to Dean that Cas should be eating too. "Do you have food there?" he asked Cas with a fork full of lasagne half way to his mouth. "Lasagne and pie?"
“Dean, it’s okay,” Cas said, wiggling back a little so he could look up at him. “We’re okay.”
Dean looked away. He withdrew every time the topic of his nightmares came up, and was evasive about the content of them. Whatever they were about, it haunted him for hours afterwards until he could shake off the feeling. Cas wished he could just wrap him up and keep him safe from everything that had ever hurt him. He'd had enough misery to last a lifetime already.
"You were a
Paralised by his sadness, utterly void of hope, Cas stayed silent, and after a few minutes he heard a sigh and the familiar footsteps of Dean Winchester walking away.
That hadn't been what Dean had meant, but seeing him with Kate was better than not seeing him at all. Maybe he could direct her towards Danny, the band's lead guitarist. Women couldn't resist Danny, and then Kate would be busy and Cas would be all his for the night.
"No. There was just the main event and she was very impatient to get to it." Cas scrunched his face up in thought. "I don't feel like penetrative sex should
"Dean, what is going on?" Sam demanded, and Dean looked at his brother with apologetic eyes.
"Do you know that every single time anyone says my name now, all I can hear is you calling it out as you come? I'm getting a semi every time anyone talks to me. I'm fucking wrecked, Cas. You've barely touched me and I'm destroyed."
"Did you hear me, Dean?" Cas ground out, his hands sliding up until his arms were around Dean’s neck. "Look at me. Did you hear me?"
Dean’s hand was sliding into Cas’ hair and a shocked gasp escaped Cas’ lips when Dean's fingers tightened, pulling his hair taut against his scalp.
“And that’s just for starters, Cas. I’ve done so many things, and lost so many people. How am I supposed to tell a stranger any of it? No one can know any of the shit we’ve done - we’d be in a prison or mental hospital if they did. I get that it’s working for you, but don’t ask me to do it Cas. I can’t do that, even for you.”
“Cas,” Dean sighed. “That’s not true, but I don’t know how to argue with you about that without making this really uncomfortable for you.”
go to bed now. We
The flash of lightning in the sky above them flashed at exactly the same moment as the rain started falling again. Dean and Cas broke apart and turned to Sam. All three of them pulled their jackets up to shield their heads from the sudden onslaught.
"I can't," he told her hoarsely. "Don't. Just don't."
"We've been coming here every week," Sam shouted back.
"Why are you in such a good mood?" Dean asked his brother, eyes narrowing suspiciously. "If I get up and you've put a Christmas tree up, I’m going to hurt you. Repeatedly."
he wanted right then. But this wasn't for him. None of this was for him and he couldn't just take what he wanted.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Actually, no. Gabriel is my brother, and he’s really not as great and glorious as you would think. He’s mostly just into porn, cats, and more recently, politics.”
As he picked up the honey to inspect it, an envelope caught his eye. It had already been opened and its contents stuffed back in, but it  looked oddly official to be wrapped up as a present. Dean’s expression had become anxious again as he watched Cas tip the contents of it onto the bed.
"Dean," Cas growled, lifting his hips impatiently. "Make me yours."
Having run out of more twisted, fatalistic thoughts, Dean moved on to the smaller, but still fucking terrifying ones.
"We can wait," Sam said with a friendly smile. "We're not in a rush."
"I should go," Cas said, not looking away and not getting to his feet either.
"Naomi."
Dean's eyes were filling up and he swiped at them with the back of his hand.
"It doesn't
“You need to get changed,” Cas reminded him, getting nimbly to his feet and looking down at Dean with a soft look on his face.
"What about?" he asked hoarsely.
Maybe their dad had changed? A man could change on his deathbed after all, that's what they say, don't they? They repent, reflect on their mistakes and change. Maybe...
“It was sex. Twice. Afterwards I showered, and shortly after that, I was stabbed. There was no cuddling. I'd have to feel safe with someone to let my guard down enough for that.”
"Jack believes in free will." Sam dismissed Chuck with a roll of his eyes and a wave of his hand. "He wouldn’t do that to us. He's more of a God than you ever hoped to be."
"Five minutes. Cas is helping me fix something."
"It's been way too long, sweetheart." He held the phone tightly to his face, cradling it, wishing more than anything that he could be feeling Cas' hand on his cheek instead.
"I'm just saying that we could go shopping, then go get a beer, play a game of pool or something?" Thinking of reasons to see Cas when the world wasn't ending was actually more difficult than Dean had imagined. He just wanted to know when they'd see each other next.
Cas frowned at his phone, and Kate, who was sitting opposite him while she ate her lunch, scrunched up her face.
“Hey, I’m not the one who plays hide and seek like a toddler. Where are you going to hide next, in the corner with your hands covering your eyes?” The tone was teasing more than mocking, but Cas still felt like throwing things at him.
"Do you know what I was always terrified of? What I always worried about?" he asked Cas, looking across to where Cas had sat next to him, leaving a depressingly respectable distance between them. Maybe it had worked. Maybe Cas was giving up on him. It was about time
Cas picked up the beer that Sam had made sure was waiting for him, and he had to admit that this was the perfect venue for something like this. The walls were high, trees dotted around the edges, full of fairy lights that twinkled prettily in the darkness. The tables were upturned barrels, placed on the paving stones that covered more than three quarters of the garden. The sound from the huge speakers carried well from the band at the back, and the makeshift dance floor was packed, bodies writhing, dancing, jumping, some just swaying and watching the band.
won't leave
felt this, Dean. It's changed a lot over the years, but this part… this I've felt since the moment my fingers first touched your soul."
"Dean, stop," Cas said tiredly.
“Alright Jilly Cooper. I get it. I can talk about sex just fine."
Dean pulled away quickly to look at his watch, leaving Cas standing in front of him looking forlorn and more than a little abandoned. "Shit, I'm late! The set starts at 9!"
"Hey, Cas?" Jodie said, catching his eye. "I think you might want to go after him, honey."
“You signed me? Like an artist signs a piece of art?”
to help you chill out," he called, poking his head around the bathroom door. "I was going to run you a bath, but you've only got a crappy shower in here. It's a pity—I could have stolen Sammy's girly bath products. Some of that shit could have knocked you out with its smell alone. Sam keeps insisting that it's all Eileen's, but at least once a week he comes out of that bathroom smelling like someone's granny."
"Dean?" Cas murmured, a question in his eyes. Was this long enough? Had they been sociable long enough to be able to leave now?
you knew, you wouldn't be looking at me with those big, sad angel eyes that are breaking my fucking heart!"
"Yes, Dean."
"That must be hard, when you're not hunting anymore."
"After," Cas supplied blandly but helpfully.
"Kate, that's not… not on the cards. I mean you're attractive, and a few years back I would have got you into bed the first night we met, but this isn't the me from a few years ago. I'm with Cas—I'm just… Kate, he's all there is for me."
not touching you when we're out together kills me."
"Dean…"
The music on the radio changed to a song Cas recognised from one of several mix-tapes that had appeared in Dean's car recently. Travelin' Soldier was both sad and beautiful, and every time Cas heard it he found himself singing along with the words. Evidently also recognising the tune, Garth got to his feet and bowed before Bess.
“You know when you watch a zombie film and there’s always this guy who fell into a coma at the start, before the outbreak happened?" Dean struggled to tear his eyes away from Cas. Maybe the novelty would wear off soon? Maybe that was all it was?
"Stop saying that!" Dean lunged forward and grabbed Cas by the shoulders, giving him one firm shake. "Stop saying it was over! It wasn't over! Nothing is over when it's us! We go after each other, we find each other! In Heaven, in Hell, in Purgatory! We fight and we find each other and we don't give up!"
to not care. He wasn't a kid anymore, this was his life and Cas was the most important part of it. John Winchester couldn't be allowed to ruin another part of his life—the only part he truly cared about apart from Sam. He smiled softly back at Cas.
"I don't think I can move," he admitted. "Shit, Cas. That was…"
"What do you think?" he asked the plant, twirling on the spot and immediately feeling like an idiot. He'd pulled on his freshly laundered grey sweatpants and the really soft t-shirt he knew Cas liked him in the best. He was acting like a teenager on his first date. He'd even put cologne on, while rolling his eyes at his own idiocy. Videocalls with smell indeed.
Cas couldn't tear his eyes away from Dean. He was trembling, his head shaking slowly from side to side in denial, his eyes wide, dark and terrified. Dean was
"I…" What could he say to that? How could he hurt Cas again? "I'll try harder, Cas. I promise. If it means that much to you, I'll try."
"I know all the reasons!"
His fingers moving quickly over the keys, he pressed send before he could over think it and stop himself.
"Yes," Dean affirmed against Cas' mouth, in a gasp. "Mine."
Kate appeared next to them with the ridiculously alcoholic coffee, cream and bowl of packeted sugar.
Dean had gone around the room asking guests if they’d seen him, checking the restroom, the garden, even the closed, dark siderooms of the Rock Garden with an increasing sense of unease.
"Guys…" she began.
"Fuck, Dean… what's got into you?"
"He's ah… indisposed. Being God. Well, sort of. And to be fair, I haven't met your kids either." Cas winced even as the words came out of his mouth.
"Then he wakes up and the world is completely changed and it's terrifying, but he’s got to go out there and chop all these corpses' heads off, or he's doomed? But the man’s an accountant and can’t even lift a sword, let alone use one, and he’s so out of his depth it’s laughable?”
"Would you do me the honour, my lady?" he asked, pulling Bess into his arms at her welcoming smile. The man was deceptively light on his feet as he twirled them around the room, confident in his own skilled footwork.
“Cas…” a sudden worry hit Dean. “Are you feeling okay? Do you know where you are?”
"No, do you feel like you're being watched?"
"And that's great," Cas said. "It's added a whole new dimension to our friendship that I didn't realise we could have. But you're continually panicking about it and I truly don't understand why. It's like whenever you're happy, you sabotage everything, before someone else can do it for you."
"I suppose it doesn't matter if you drop me off or not. I'd have to come back for my car anyway."
"Then try to trust me when I tell you that what you need to know is that I got overwhelmed and I went to stand outside. I should have taken my shoes and coat, but it really didn't seem worth it. Can we drop this now?"
Dean folded his arms and settled himself against the counter, as if readying himself to be entertained. He really was a dick sometimes.
"SpongeBob SquarePants," Sam nodded sagely.
Dean sighed and tried again.
use you for sex."
Like Cas would ever forgive him if he took his temper out on Nigel.
Dean could admit they were attached, or at least
"So good. So beautiful," he murmured, sucking hard at the skin just under Dean's ear, not caring if it marked him. The sting of it made Dean groan and tightening his fingers in Cas' hair he pulled Cas even harder against him, encouraging him to suck harder.
At first he searched alone, not wanting to attract more attention than was absolutely necessary. Eventually, though, he was forced to admit to himself that he needed help, and reluctantly called in the emergency services. Helicopters with spotlights, search teams with sniffer-dogs, noise, people, drama. It was everything he'd been taught to avoid, but desperation had won out—finding Cas mattered more.
He'd wanted to wait, wanted to feel Cas come apart against him, needed to be in his right mind when it happened so he could play it in his head, again and again, but it felt so incredibly
"Nothing much," Dean said, evasively. He didn't want to talk about Kate—for maybe the first time ever, he
Maybe all of this today was part of it? Part of Dean trying anything he could to make Cas happy? Was this Dean faking being in love with him because he thought it was what Cas wanted? That it would make Cas stay? Just the thought of that gave him an instant sinking feeling.
"Not at all, my dear. Kate and I have been getting on like a house on fire. Isn’t that right?" Rowena nudged Kate conspiratorially with a pointed elbow. "I was just complimenting her on her dress, I’m surprised she’s not permanently surrounded by a gaggle of drooling suitors with a neckline as low cut as that." She winked and Kate raised her hand to her mouth, covering an almost coquettish laugh that made Dean's eyebrows almost disappear into his hairline.
"What Dean is trying to say-" Sam started, grinning at Cas.
"Seriously?" Claire looked at him incredulously. "Is that really what you're going with?"
“Oh, Dean,” Kate murmured, the hands on his arms caressing now, stroking in an almost hypnotic motion. “What do
"Doesn't mean I trust her. You were all she asked about last night. She likes you.
"I could try out a move from that movie we watched," Cas said, offering up a smile that it physically hurt him to paste onto his face. "To make it up to you properly."
"I am not supplying you with porn. Use your imagination like everyone else."
"I'm going to need you to lie flat on your front. I'd use oil, but I don't want you to have to get up for a shower after."
When Cas traced one finger over the delicate skin of his wrist, Dean jumped so much that his knee hit the table with a bang, rattling the unused cutlery and making Cas' untouched beer spill.
"I told him I was in love with him."
"Daphne, Velma and Scooby Doo," Cas declared without hesitation, a challenge in his eyes.
Under the safety of darkness, painstakingly, letter by letter, Cas spelled out words onto Dean's hand, stopping to start the word over again whenever Dean tapped his shoulder to show he hadn't caught one of the letters. Finally, after what felt like hours, Dean wrapped both arms around Cas and pulled him until he was half laying on his chest.
“No, Dean. '
“I’m not,” Dean said with a smirk.
"I'm quite certain that they weren't invented for mastabatory reasons. And it's cold in there. If you're uncomfortable, why don't you go and make yourself a cup of tea? Talk to Nigel, check the news. I'll be as quick as I can."
"What do you think, Claire?"
"We should do this sort of thing more often," Dean said. "Especially when it's warmer and the lake house is free—we could have barbecues. There's loads of space for the kids to let off some steam and for Miracle to run about. In the summer we could swim in the lake, or do some fishing."
Cas sighed. "I'll come to you."
"You're drunk."
Dean nodded to his brother, catching his shoulder on the way out, narrowly avoiding making him spill the coffee on the floor. “It’s alright, man. You were the one truly good thing about our childhood. Don't let him ruin that as well.”
"He always had the girls fightin’ for his attention, did Dean. Beatin’ them off with a stick all the time. Probably got so many choices he can’t pick just one woman. Maybe I should be doin’ it for him!"
"None of this should make any difference to you," Dean told her. "Cas was your friend, and he's
He stepped closer, shaking his head, his beautiful, tear-filled green eyes so full of regret and pain that they made Cas' heart ache to see them.
“Oh.”
John was the man who had shaped him, judged him, defined him. For better or worse, he had turned Dean into the man he was today—the soldier, the protector, the hunter he was trying so hard to leave behind. His relationship with his father and his relationship with Cas were utterly incompatible, with no room for compromise, no overlap. There was no good solution, no way for Dean to keep his parents
"Fill 'er up, Sammy."
Quite honestly, Dean wouldn't have been surprised if Cas had days of the week underwear in there. He dug through the drawer, looking for the plainest, darkest boxers. He absolutely refused to have a large unicorn emblazoned on his ass, which, going by some of the pairs he was already seeing, was a distinct possibility.
"Ask me after Thanksgiving."
you, when you were talking to your brothers. I know you want a family and a partner, and… and kids. Don't deny it, Cas."
mind," Cas protested breathlessly, his fingers digging into Dean's ass, pulling him down against him over and over in a rhythm that Dean knew would take him over the edge if he wasn't careful.
"What the hell, Cas?" Dean looked up at the ceiling, but the sound of Cas' belt clinking as it hit the ground was providing plenty of replacement visuals for him. Was that the sound of a zipper being pulled down?
"Dad would leave us in Motel rooms that were paid up for the week, and he'd fuck off for three, four weeks at a time. I had to find money to pay for it, or Sammy would have been sleeping on park benches. I didn't want to do any of it. I swear to you, Cas. I didn't."
"I'm sorry that I had to call," Kate shouted over the music. "I just didn't know what else to do. I think he's either had just way too much to drink, or he's taken something really dodgy."
It was vicious. It was sadistic. It was cruel. Chuck never once fought back.
“Then let me see if I can find a way to show you how much I appreciate my gifts instead of telling you,” Cas offered, deliberately squirming in Dean's lap.
Before Dean could back away, Kate reached up, her fingers sliding over the skin of his jaw. Dean grabbed her hand in his, pulling it from his face and dropping it quickly. This was getting out of hand and he could feel panic bubbling to the surface. For the first time in his life he had something he was terrified to lose, and Kate was putting everything at risk.
"I want this," Cas groaned. "I want
“I’ll always want you, Cas.”
"I'm dying!" Sam groaned against the table. "You're so fast. What is that, leftover Angel juice?"
"You tell me
"The way I ended up going… it became rather treacherous. Possibly on purpose, which leads me to believe I was getting close."
"I see." Cas didn't see, and if he didn't concentrate hard, he was going to be sick in Dean's precious car. Part of him thought Dean sort of deserved that right now.
"You need sleep," Dean leaned close to him to whisper in his ear. "Your eyes are practically closed already."
"You're so bossy," Dean muttered, getting up anyway and gingerly padding barefoot over to the sink with his half full glass of whisky. He eyed the expensive amber liquid and then downed it all before rinsing out and filling the glass with water. The alcohol burned on the way down, momentarily distracting him from the ache of his ribs and the stinging of a particularly nasty cut near his hip. He was too fucking old for this shit. All of it.
"Mmm. Me too." He tightened his arms around Cas posessively. "Mine."
"Well… yeah." Well, who could lie to that face?
Cas' eyes seemed to sparkle in the candlelight and Dean was hit for a moment by how much of a fucking cliché he was when he was falling for someone. This was so dangerous. He shouldn't want this, shouldn't be looking at Cas like this, shouldn't be obsessing over the way the shadows played over his skin and how he wished he could uncover more of Cas' skin just to see how it would look.
"I don't get why you're so hostile with me all the time," she pouted, the perfect cupid’s bow of her mouth pursing up in a way that someone had probably once told her was irresistible.
“I sat on the floor, staring at the spot where you made that stupid fucking sacrifice - the spot where you
"You can absolutely end things with me, but I'm not that much of a glutton for punishment that I'll do this to myself again, Dean. Kissing you was incredible, and I won't
"Yeah." Cas was pushed backwards and knocked onto his back on Dean's bed before he could register what was happening. Dean's solid body landed on top of him seconds later, momentarily knocking the air from his lungs. “I’ve been kept from doing this for fucking hours.”
Cas felt heat rising in his cheeks, and the corners of Dean's soft pink lips lifted in a small smirk. He knew
Did he count as anything anymore? He didn't fit anywhere. Not in Heaven with his brothers, with Jack. Not here with Dean who quite obviously didn't want him there if his early morning escape was any indication.
"Yes?"
Cas nuzzled his neck.
Dean was fairly sure that if he held his breath any longer, he was going to pass out.
"Hunting ends in tragedy and death, and you know it!" Cas' tone wasn't gentle anymore. "It doesn't matter how careful you are or how much you have to live for—you and Sam left it for just that reason! I can't bring you back again!"
"There's an aquarium about an hours drive away," Kate said, peeling the crust off her grilled cheese sandwich and putting it on the edge of her plate piece by piece. "I take the kids every year and you're welcome to come with us next time. There's this tunnel that you can walk under, and all these sharks and stingrays swim over you. I bet you'd love it."
"I don't—"
He was going to shower, chase the estate agent about his lake house again, and then he was going to gather supplies. Fixing the place up was exactly the sort of distraction he needed, and taking advantage of having two bored Angels with superstrength at his beck and call couldn't hurt. He just hoped the estate agent or owners wouldn't think to visit the place before she sold it to him. He'd have a hard time explaining that one. All assuming they still wanted to sell.
“Kate?”
"They're freshly laundered! Besides, I don't have a wife to wash my clothes for me, do I?" The moment the words left his mouth he regretted it.
"Well that's very kind of you, Dean."
Dean gave up on being upright and collapsed painfully on the bed, scrubbing his face with the heels of his hands until his eyes hurt and he saw stars.
“Stop fucking running away,” Dean hissed. He pushed himself away from the door, away from Cas, giving him the space he needed. Cas took a gulp of air that felt and sounded suspiciously like a sob and he stood there, hyperventilating, desperately trying to slow his breathing down without breaking down entirely.
Dean's face scrunched up. "Are you talking about Miss Congeniality?"
It took Dean four, maybe five seconds to get his brain to kick into gear, to get his hands to work, his arms to push her away. He pushed her hard enough that she stumbled backwards. Scrubbing his arm over his mouth, he didn’t look at her—he didn’t want to see her face, didn’t want to think about her at all. He was beyond trying to deal with this tonight. He was done.
“He has no right to judge you.”
This was different though. He'd never imagined that Cas would make little noises in the back of his throat in pure pleasure and joy, just because he was kissing
get Cas naked, just maybe not on the same day he'd said some really, really shitty, stupid things to him.
"Yeah. I went all big and corporate at first but it made me miserable. I was snappy and down all the time. Eileen was the one who helped me set up my own company and then I got a few of us together and we really helped people. Families who couldn't afford help, kids stuck in the system, people who really needed me. It made up for not being able to hunt anymore.”
"And comfortable."
The beauty of the sky, framed by water and trees and hills - it made his problems feel momentarily insignificant.
"I can always see you." He was so deadly serious and Dean tried to swallow past the lump in his throat.
Cas groaned quietly.
"You’re going to have to speak to him you know," Cas said gently, making him pause. "I understand why you're avoiding it, but he's here,
Arms folded, Claire responded to Dean's order without question and stalked off towards her girlfriend. He had no idea how Dean managed to do that.
"Touching…" Chuck said, running his hand tentatively over a large bruise blooming on his jaw, feeling the damage.
"Dean!"
"You know, my wings weren't white. Or fluffy."
Masonic, you are utterly awesome. Thank you so much xx
a ferret.
"You know I like being with you." Cas was looking intently at the dark liquid in his mug, and studiously not looking at Dean.
"I miss you too, but we can't do this. You'll regret it."
armies!" Donna corrected, helpfully.
"The pain of you having crushed the pressure point in my hand? Yeah!"
His words seemed to light something in Cas and with a feral growl he rolled them over so that he was on top of Dean, pinning him to the bed with his own weight. Dean threw his head back at the feel of him and Cas was instantly bending over, his mouth on Dean's exposed neck, kissing hotly up to his ear and whispering in it.
"You brought knives to an escape room? Seriously? Do you have no idea how to function in normal society, Dean?"
“No!” Dean denied, turning away from Cas to look at his brother, colour draining from his face as he took in the disappointment on Sam's face. “No, Sammy. I didn’t mean to! I…”
"Cas?"
Dean turned to watch as Cas dug around in the kitchen drawers, loudly slamming things shut, not actually seeming to be looking for anything specific. He should probably have hidden his amusement, but fuck, Cas was adorable when he was annoyed with him.
Cas was never more pleased that Dean possessed absolutely no psychic abilities. The last thing he needed was Dean reading his mind.
“I adore my new bed. I would stay in this bed forever if I didn’t keep needing to get up to eat, drink and urinate."
"Get your own weapon!"
"I'm fine," he lied. He didn't think he would ever be fine again.
Dean burrowed his face even deeper into Cas’s neck and Cas finally allowed himself to press a kiss into Dean's hair, half hoping he wouldn’t notice.
A shock of something went through Dean, and he was lost. All control left him and he stopped being careful or gentle, stopped thinking of anything but the moaning angel underneath him, as he pounded into him. Each of them fed on the other's urgency, on the passion and fire between them, matching each other thrust for thrust, touch for touch, each driving the other higher and higher until all there was was pleasure, smothered by the white noise of harsh breathing, gasps, and pants.
"You only just got us these ones." Cas held up his untouched beer and indicated to his almost full, sparkling gold glass of champagne.
"You're so fucking beautiful, Cas."
"Yeah. Sure. Sorry."
“Are you going to let me?” he asked breathlessly. "Are you?"
He’d been using that excuse for so long now that the lie just rolled off his tongue. He didn’t really remember when one night stands had started to wear thin, but at some point it had become just a little soul destroying playing the same game with each woman, saying the same tired old lines. It wasn’t what he wanted anymore.
Dean beamed and Cas felt guilty for even considering saying no.
"Tonight is ages away," Dean sighed.
“I’ve only been here five minutes,” Dean explained, finally happy with his song choice as Sweet Child of Mine blared from the radio. “I don’t know much more than you do. Bobby was here when I arrived - he said Heaven is different now. Jack pulled all the walls down, and now people live together up here, free instead of being on a crappy little loop for all eternity.”
“I could do that every day for a year and it would barely make a dent,” Cas said, easily. “Maybe a week-long session with another angel…”
"That won't stop me from reassuring you," Dean growled, when they eventually pulled apart. Cas cocked his head and smiled, drawing Dean's eyes back to his now kiss-swollen lips.
Dean's eyes flew open—his actual eyes this time—his sleep-dazed mind not knowing what was real. His hands clawed at the canvas and panic seized his heart.
"Yeah, I know. But I don't think you're getting this. Look… honestly?"
"Not if you don't want to. I might not have known you as a child, Dean, but I know you now and I will protect you from anything that hurts you -
"We'll see. I'm sure meeting the archangel Gabriel will be very convincing."
"That would be the lavender." Cas pushed his way past Dean into the small bathroom and started unbuttoning his shirt. "It's supposed to be calming and yes, it is rather popular with the elderly."
Cas looked up in confusion.
that Chuck played with for a while and then left in a box somewhere."
"You're drunk," Dean accused suddenly. In his delight at this discovery, he completely forgot he was trying to escape to the kitchen. He tipped his head to one side quizzically, studying Cas like he was a new and fascinating specimen. "I barely ever get to see you properly drunk!"
"We gathered as much," Balthazar nodded. "But it's good to know for sure when trying to convince our brothers and sisters to get off their arses and join the fight."
Kate was looking stunning in a long, flattering pale blue dress that followed every curve of her body, her hair tied in an intricate style that suggested she’d spent an inordinate amount of time trying to make it look so effortless and casual, her perfect makeup hiding any sign that she might even have had a sleepless night over what she had done.
"Do you like me?" Dean asked again, frowning as Cas' sigh.
The restaurant would normally have been fifteen minutes away from the Bunker when walking normally, but Dean hadn't been walking normally, and by the time Cas had finally caught up to him he was almost at the entrance.
"I know, Cas! Every hunter knows!"
"Hey," the voice came to him in the darkness—soothing, gentle, reassuring. "It's okay."
"Nope."
Cas opened his eyes and sat up, putting a placating hand on Dean's arm.
Dean caught Cas' eye and nodded, a moment of affectionate warmth flashing in his eyes, before turning back to face Chuck.
"Yeah, well now you're half dressed and in my bed. Things change." And if our lives are going to go back to being fucked with by this world, I'm going to take happiness where I can get it.
“You know I’ve got barely any photos of you? I think the last ones I took were when you were dressed all Calamity Jane.”
The thought was still echoing in his head as he watched his parents move away from Eileen to a group of older hunters they knew from way back when. Almost instantly, John was holding court, the centre of the group, all eyes on him. Even Mary, who in her own right was a strong, confident, charismatic woman, faded into the background as her husband talked, her smile adoring, eyes not leaving his face. She had always been different around him, as far as Dean remembered—meaker.
Thinking about it, had what had happened in Cas' bed even counted as sex for Dean? He hadn't reached orgasm, or even let Cas so much as touch him intimately. It had upset and worried Cas at the time, but he was pretty sure he'd figured out what Dean was doing, and he didn't like it. Dean being willing to sacrifice his own wants and needs for Cas' happiness was touching and beautiful, but utterly misguided. He didn't want that from Dean, and maybe they needed to talk about that? Before Dean tried to do any other things he didn't actually want for himself, just to make Cas happy.
"I know, Cas. I've got you."
For a moment Dean's expression was frozen, then all at once he was throwing his head back, laughing so loudly that everyone stopped what they were doing to look at him. He clutched his stomach as he bent double, and Cas stared at him, utterly perplexed.
"Yeah, I know."
The lights flickered and flashed, then came on, highlighting clearly now just how neglected the house was. The wallpaper was old and peeling, paint on the windowsill and doors cracked, thick dust everywhere. It might have been better to leave the lights off.
Cas sat up, straddling Dean’s hips and smiling down at him fondly. “Okay, Dean,” he agreed. His hands reached for the hem of his own t-shirt and Dean grinned, his face changing from dazed and awed to cocky assurance in an instant.
Sam made a zipping motion with his fingers, and Dean watched as he unveiled what looked like a very generous slice of pecan pie. Dean's mouth watered. Sam barely ever made these for him these days, he was so busy clucking over Eileen.
"So the plan is to bore me to sleep?"
"You never liked my sweaters," Cas joked nervously, lifting his arms over his head so Dean could pull the sweater off, grabbing at the hem of his t-shirt when it threatened to go with it. "Any excuse to get me out of them."
Dean grinned. In that moment it hit Dean that whatever else was happening, he had Cas back and that was a win in anyone's book. All those tears, all that heartbreak, but it was okay now, because his Angel was next to him, chewing his popcorn in the exact same way that a bulldog would chew a wasp.
Dean's skin prickled, his senses going on alert. "Why does that sound like it's a bad thing?"
"You're even sounding like a shrink now!" Dean growled. "You'll end up being taken away by the men in white coats, Cas. Or worse! Do you know what our government would do to you if they found out what you really are? And now there's some guy out there who knows all our shit!"
“It’s fine,” Cas said calmly. “Sam’s right - I don’t really belong in either place. But giving up my Grace - that’s a bit like purposely letting blood. It’s the only thing I’ve got left of what I was before. And what if I drained it, wasted it, and then Sam chopped off a finger and needed healing?”
"In love with an Angel, Dean," Chuck admonished. "
"The way he's living, he's not going to survive long enough to be called Uncle Dean," Cas agreed.
There was a long moment where their eyes met and nothing was said. Cas couldn't help but drop his gaze to Dean's mouth - that perfect, soft, insolent, argumentative mouth that Cas constantly wanted to kiss into submission. Never sure if he was the Babysitter or the Pizza man when he was with Dean, he wondered if it would be okay if he was both - Pizza Man Monday to Friday and the Babysitter at weekends.
"I was mostly there to keep Kate company…"
“Hello? Yeah, from just outside the Safe Harbor restaurant, to…” he frowned. “Kate, where is it that you live?”
"Hand holdin', snugglin' on the couch," Donna added.
"Molecules, huh?" Dean asked, throwing a '
"Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Sorting the house can wait for a few days. Shit, Cas. How am I supposed to face him?"
Dean took a deep breath. "No, but I figured that was where we were heading."
"You pick the most inconvenient moments to want to talk," Cas laughed through his tears. "Yes, I'm more than good with it. I love you, Dean. I've loved you for so long it feels like it's always been there—like I was created with it beating inside me. I keep telling you, I'm yours. Start believing it."
Cas didn't
"C'mon, Cas. Fuck, marry, kill."
They practically fell through the door to Cas' apartment, hands yanking at clothes, mouths immediately finding each other in a bruising kiss. Neither of them was capable of being gentle any longer, hands clutching at each other’s faces, sliding under shirts, clinging, grasping, stroking—they couldn’t get enough of each other fast enough.
Cas' wide eyes shot to Dean's, his cheeks visibly reddening at Dean's blatant flirting.
Dean usually loved a restaurant with a buffet - he took it as a personal challenge to get his, and everyone else's, money's worth. Today the food felt like sawdust in his mouth. It wasn’t a recent thing - he'd been like this ever since Cas came back, and even Sam had noticed that he was losing too much weight and was looking unwell. He’d even started cooking Dean bacon each morning to try to tempt him into eating. Dean hadn’t been able to eat much of it, so he’d surreptitiously fed most of the bacon to Miracle. At least it had been appreciated by someone. Best of all, it had earned him brownie points in his and Sam's eternal battle over who Miracle loved the most. Neither one of them were prepared to admit the winner was actually Eileen.
As soon as Dean had stomped out of the room, Cas felt some of the tension melt from his body. He sat down heavily on the bed next to Gabriel.
"It was always you," Dean whispered hotly into Cas' ear. "I didn't want to think about what that meant back then, but I know now. I
"I furnished it almost entirely from charity shops," Cas said, rooting through a kitchen cupboard for the first aid kit. "It's probably not to your taste, but I needed to make it homey."
"I know where this is. I… I took Jack here, fishing. Well, near here at least." Dean's expression softened as he remembered. "There was this stream, full of fish, and after we were done we followed it to where it poured into this huge lake, so clear you could see the stones at the bottom. You should've seen it, man. It was beautiful - Jack loved it."
Jack turned to Cas, who instinctively reached out for Dean’s hand, holding it in a tight, bruising grip, moving to stand in front of him. Cas was scared for him, was protecting Dean against something Jack might do. Something was very wrong.
touching Cas would actually be the end of him.
Sam smiled. "Will do, Cas. You guys try to enjoy the rest of your date night without falling out, alright?"
every single night on the off chance you could hear me and it might have kept you sane!”
"You can't swim?"
“I would have been satisfied -”
"So help me, Cas," he growled. "We are gonna sort this out!"
A burst of laughter had pulled him out of his reverie - Dean’s laughter. His head was thrown back in one of those rare moments of true amusement. It was the kind of laugh that Cas had clung to like a prize when he’d managed to win it and make it fall from Dean’s lips. And there was this stranger, this woman in a ridiculously tight blue dress who Dean couldn’t have known for more than a few days, and it was more likely to be just a few hours, and she could make Dean laugh like this, like he didn’t have a care in the world, like he hadn’t just lost his best friend.
Dean had an acoustic guitar in his hands, his fingers sliding over the strings in a way that seemed almost tender to Cas as he watched. He was singing about being a simple man, which Cas found particularly ironic as Dean was anything but. Seeing Dean in the flesh after all this time was like finally having a drink of water after being parched for weeks. He struggled to tear his eyes away, even though he knew he had to leave, knew that it wasn't doing him any good.
"I think we've talked about this more than enough to be doing it."
Cas was fully dressed, even to the point where he’d smoothed his messy hair back down again, and by the subtle but unmistakable smell, he had borrowed some of Dean's deodorant and cologne.
"And you were mine,
“I don’t know. I just always have.” He said it so simply, like not loving Dean had never been an option. His eyes were wide, shining brightly with unhindered candour, the vulnerability behind them bewitching Dean so completely that the feelings it stirred up inside him made him feel dizzy. He wanted to wrap Cas in his arms and never let go; he wanted to protect him from anything that existed that could ever hurt him.
it and still not seeing it."
of those times were when bacon was involved.
“No.”
choice to save him.”
“Night Sammy.”
They still hadn't spoken, but to Dean's credit it wasn't for lack of trying on his part. Usually the one to shut down, back off and become angry and cold, this time Dean seemed to be chasing Cas. He had got up earlier and earlier, hoping to catch Cas before he left for the day. He'd stayed up late waiting for him, meaning Cas had to get Sam to text him when the coast was clear and Dean had finally gone to bed. Different notes were posted under his door each day:
Cas eyed him suspiciously but stayed put. Dean was fairly sure that was a win.
"Have I mentioned that I'm real glad I invited you over?"
You know that's not true. Getting back home to you is all that is keeping me going. I truly didn't think we'd be apart this long. Are you actually well? You're much harder to read over text.
"Dean, it isn't worth
Dean's heart seemed to skip a beat inside his chest. All his life he'd been the protector, keeping Sammy safe, saving other people. Other than Sam, he'd never had someone in his life who wanted to protect him at all costs like Cas did. Cas acted like Dean was something precious, not the screw-up he knew he really was.
Dean had pushed away from the wall, no-longer looking cocky and sure of himself.
"Just relax," Kate soothed, her hand on his chest. "Dancing is easy!"
“Do you see me as a paragon of mental health?” Cas asked, sprinkling some sort of yellow oil over his food, making the leaves glisten, reminding Dean of when someone had just relieved themselves on a path of weeds at the curbside. “I think my daddy issues alone will take a decade to address.”
“Wait, I’m going to send you a photo of him.”
"As much as we tried to make the best of it, it was shit. When we were really young I'd tell myself it was cool doing what we did, not being dull, normal and unaware. But it wasn't - it was fucking awful. You're right to want out of this life before any kids come along, Sammy. They deserve a decent childhood, and you deserve some peace."
"Meet?" Foolish hope rose in his chest. Was Cas closer than he thought? Could he pop back to see him that easily?
What if, when all their friends and family gathered for Thanksgiving, Cas did something to give them away? What if he tried to hold his hand or outright kissed him? People already talked about how they looked at each other, and that was before they'd kissed, had phone sex, had become so attached to each other.
"I'm sorry, but from where I was standing it looked like you were sacrificing yourself just to save me. It
"To annoy one specific angel, yes. Although Gabriel really loved the cats in the end. When he banished them to Earth, he kept fourteen just for himself."
"Cas, come back!"
"No!" A pulse thrummed through them, powerful and real, trying to tear them apart. He couldn't let it. Not again.
"No, not him - try again."
Already painfully aware that he was making too big a deal of all this, that he was putting in an embarrassing amount of effort, he didn't need Sam pointing it out. How was he supposed to pretend he wasn't doing this when Sam was practically grading him out of ten?
"There are absolutely no Hitler fantasies here," Dean denied emphatically. "I'm into some freaky shit, but Nazi uniforms are not my bag."
"You're pissed at me," Dean was still grinning, even though he could tell Cas wasn't actually that far off plotting his death.
For a moment they just stared at each other, then Cas' lips twitched. His eyes crinkled in barely suppressed amusement, then he burst into a belly laugh that immediately set Dean off too.
"I could feel touch, just not necessarily pleasure or pain."
"Say it," Dean growled.
morning, wasn't it? It didn't quite feel like morning.
"What the hell has gotten into you?" Dean spat, yanking his t-shirt up to scrub his lips on the hem. Cas' heart sank.
"Hello, Castiel," Dean mimicked his tone, and then smiled at him. "You look much better."
Dean grinned triumphantly. He slid out of bed, the cold air nipping at his skin as he dug through his drawers for a fresh pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He probably shouldn't greet Cas naked, if they were going to keep their friendship uncomplicated. Tempting though it was.
"Cas!" Sam and Eileen both greeted him warmly, gesturing for him to sit down on the cushioned bench next to Dean.
"Cas," Dean whispered his name reverently, like his name was a prayer all by itself. He kissed him again, so very slowly, pouring every bit of gratitude he felt into that one kiss - everything he couldn't say, could
"Urgh."
Neither man nor Angel moved, mouths almost touching, both so still that they were each fighting to control each shuddering breath, as if any movement, anything at all could break this, shatter it.
"Either the monsters will get him or his liver will give out - he's not looking to survive this long term." Sam's jaw was set, and for the first time Cas noticed that his fingernails were bitten down to the quick and red raw. Cas' heart went out to him.
That was all he needed.
Sam smiled indulgently at him. Life was pretty good for Sam - they'd defeated Chuck, Jack had brought his girlfriend back into existence, and Cas knew that Sam had a date with her later. For once life was pretty damn perfect for Sam, and Cas really hoped he would be able to work out how to keep it that way.
“You don’t have to hold your body that far away. I’m not going to…”
"Yes."
"Probably," Dean answered honestly. "If you were sensible."
"There's a bunch of cut out letters in this box," Cas offered. "Maybe we need to make a word? Spell out a number, maybe?"
Dean felt his face crumpling, his breath coming fast. He was splintering apart, into tiny pieces that no one would be able to put back together again. But even as the panic surged through him like an unstoppable tidal wave, Dean felt Cas' fingers in his hair, stroking, calming, gentle and reassuring.
Dean stood up and gave Cas a pointed look, tipping his head towards his room. If Cas didn’t want to stay the night it was fine, but even just getting Cas alone for five minutes to really talk to him would be amazing. Dean went down the hallway to the bathroom to very quickly relieve himself and brush his teeth. He was half expecting Cas to be sitting on his bed when he had finished, but to his disappointment the room was empty. Cas' room was also empty, so Dean sat on his bed and waited.
"Yeah, but this time you're not sure why you're pissed, and that's pissing you off even more."
"I'm sorry, would that make it easier for you?" Cas asked sarcastically. "Next time I'll be sure to consult you before allowing myself to feel anything for anyone!"
“When do you think your Grace will run out?” Eileen asked.
When he reached the library where everyone was still gathered, he knew he couldn't just sit down with them like nothing had happened. He was shaking—his entire body trembling, betraying him completely. And he couldn't let people see him like this. He needed to hide until he'd calmed down. No, he needed to go home. He grabbed his coat from the back of his chair.
Even with Sam gone, Cas was impossible to read. People had been telling him for years that Cas looked at him like he wanted to tear his clothes off and bend him over the furniture - he'd never believed it. He'd had so many doubts - were Angels even capable of that sort of feeling? If they were, why the Hell would Cas choose a human as flawed as he was? And Cas liked women, didn't he?
Dean was already turned away, leaning on the counter with both hands, his back bent, his face hidden.
There was silence for a moment, then Dean tore his eyes away from Cas. "I mean if you did it twice, it must have been good?"
“I don’t want to stop you.” He slid his hand through Cas’ hair and then cupped his cheek, helping to tip Cas’ head up to meet his eyes. “I swear I don’t ever want to stop you, but Cas, I need you, man. I really fucking need you. I’m falling apart here.”
"That would be great, thanks."
"I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?" he asked quietly.
"No…" He looked at Kate and then Dean. "No." He said more firmly. "It wasn't a fight club, it was the same teaching and sparring as the original class, just at a higher level. It was a mix of martial arts and something they called street fighting. It was all ridiculous and I only went a couple of times."
"Cas, I can
There was no way back for her unicorn sock and Gertie was heartbroken. She couldn't understand why all these supposedly clever grown-ups couldn't put their heads together to work out how to get it back, and she was making her dissatisfaction loudly known.
His phone buzzed again
On the wall, half hidden by the bookcase, was a child's drawing. It stood out, clean and new against the dirt of the walls, as if it hadn't been there long enough to gather dust. A drawing of a little girl standing under a tree, a dog with one ear sitting next to her. Cas crossed to the shelf and picked up the broken dog ornament. Taped to its underside was a string with a weight on the end.
"What? No. I don't get turned on by freakin' Squidward." Dean looked like he was rapidly losing control of the direction of the conversation.
He gave Cas a sheepish look, and he looked so guilty that Cas found himself reaching out his hand to squeeze his arm reassuringly. After all they had done before Cas fell asleep on him, surely Dean knew that he didn't have to feel bad for doing something as innocent as laying in bed next to him?
sorry—really fucking sorry. He shouldn't have ended things with Cas, and if he hadn't then that would be his hand there, doing all the glorious hard work. Or his mouth could instead. Christ, he'd been waiting such a long, long time to find out what it would be like to have the heavy weight of Cas' cock on his tongue.
"I think you're gonna be okay," Claire said with an exaggerated wink.
who I miss,
Three days.
for me. Please, please sweetheart… Please listen. Please?"
"What he
“Use your words,” Dean growled, purposely using Cas’ own words from earlier against him.
He wanted to tell Dean that he didn't want a thing from him, but the words were stuck in his throat and all he could do was shake his head, wiping his mouth shakily with the back of his hand.
Dean turned in Cas' arms, needing to look at his face.
Kate blinked and opened her mouth, but Cas got there first.
to go to Hell?" He'd be the first person in the history of the Universe to ask for a transfer when he got to Heaven.
“Dean?” Cas called, the word slurred. “I’m really tired.”
Cas drew a hand slowly down his face. Would Claire want to know how her parents were? Would it help for her to know what they were doing now? Should he try to talk to her, or would it be like offering her scraps and just make everything worse? He felt a lot like he'd chosen one child over another.
“Yes. And Sam’s. That’s complicated too.”
"Amara is still in love with you," Cas said. "I was right about that too. I should have trusted myself and not… if she wasn't so jealous of what she thought we had, she might have given Jack back. I don't think she needs him. He's fighting her."
"I get it, I do. I liked this too, but we were kidding ourselves. This is never going to be more than sex."
"You okay, buddy?" Cas hadn't said much since their tryst in the shower. He was acting like it had never happened at all, and it was freaking Dean out a bit. It had been Cas' first time with a guy, his first time with Dean. Had it been good for him? Had he enjoyed it? Did he want to do it again? Why wasn't he reacting?
Dean's own phone buzzed and Sam snatched his phone back out of Dean's hand with a half hearted glare.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright, can we assume that if I'm gonna go psycho, it's not going to be on any of you and that I'd have a damn good reason for it? Please."
"I had to coat myself in…"
Patience was sitting with Jodie and Donna, talking and seemingly reassured. She had calmed down but everyone else seemed to be in constant flux, moving from one place to the next, generally seconds behind an abnormally fast toddler or child.
"—several live chickens, for luck!" Kate was chattering away, seemingly blind to Cas' standoffishness, to the way his arms were folded defensively over his chest.
Dean ignored his brother and pressed the skip button again, even though the first chords of the next song hadn’t even begun.
"As long as it won't be like that scene in that dancing film you made me watch."
"You just don't want me to recite any more of Balthazar's poetry," Cas sighed. "It's actually quite clever."
While half drunk, alone and in the relative safety of the privacy of his bedroom, Dean could admit that there had always been a connection between him and Cas, something that had burned white hot between them from the first moment they had met. It had only burned brighter once Dean had got to know Cas, when he'd realised that he admired him, liked him, missed him whenever he wasn't there.
