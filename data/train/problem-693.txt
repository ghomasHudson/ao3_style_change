"Oh," Sherlock gasped. "And I can learn how to lipread."
"That, too," John agreed.
When they were finally fully dressed, and a bit more conscious, John pulled back to look Sherlock up and down. "Coats stay buttoned, love. You managed to come all over the both of us."
"Oh, bloody hell," John grumbled, standing again. "See, you got shot and now I've got to break tradition."
"Yes, gathered as much," Sherlock said flatly.
Taking another person's emotions into account wasn't something Sherlock avoided, per se, but it was definitely not a skill of his. Here he was, though, considerate and confused.
When the man was out of sight Sherlock rushed to John and inspected his fist, mumbling to him and dragging him to the front to wash it. "Obviously not your blood. You're absolutely mad. Never had anyone stick up for me."
"Hi," John said, smile oozing charm as he tapped the pass hanging around his neck. "I'm one of the writers. I've seemed to have lost my way."
And really, what was Sherlock meant to say? That it was intentional, that it was self directed? That he'd spent years learning how to block out the world so perfectly as to forget it? With John touching him like that?
Jane gave him a weak smile and helped him stand and toss the old food in the bin. They started walking back to the morgue and Miles shuffled along, pulling his hands into the sleeves of his jumper.
The second he had his hand in his pants, gripping his interested cock in a loose fist, a man's face came to mind. Perhaps it was the reference to his work, or perhaps it was the word mouthy, but the face in his mind's eye was that of his patient. Yes, that one. It scowled at him and rolled its eyes and John let out a huff of a laugh.
_____
"Mmm," John murmured, licking his thumb and folding the first sheet back.
"Amazing?" Sherlock asked, shocked.
Who is he, to you? That really was the question, wasn't it?
, he felt alive!
Sherlock's entire body went still before he could stop it and he pulled himself together enough to glance around the room before it occurred to him. "You've got your boyfriend's office under surveillance? Bit paranoid, isn't it?"
John looked over at him and chewed his lip in an attempt not to smile and Sherlock downed his second glass. He was already feeling fuzzy around the edges and silently cursed himself for not having lunch or supper.
"I suppose I'll need a bodyguard, then," Sherlock answered, removing his coat and jacket and hanging them by the door.
"Oh," Sherlock grunted, "oh, John. Oh, oh."
"The landlady. Loo is through that door," Sherlock added, gesturing to the frosted glass, and then, when John raised an eyebrow, "second door in the hall."
"Don't look so shocked," Sherlock dismissed. "You must have known the way I would present myself once we got here."
_____
"Where are your pyjamas?" Sherlock asked, holding the duffle upside down and shaking as if they might just be hiding from her.
"What about you?" Sherlock asked softly.
"Could do with a friend like God," John said.
If you don't want me to write again, just say.
In the photo, which Sherlock insisted John send him, the smile on Sherlock's face was almost ridiculous in its intensity. It was printed and stuck in the box in the closet the next day. There, amongst the other detritus of Sherlock's life, it pressed up against the picture of John's face when he'd called Sherlock breathtaking in that video months before. John's smile was one and the same.
"Perhaps I could show you," Sherlock insisted, looking up through his eyelashes.
"The library in town is quite small," Sherlock said in lieu of comment. "I've read almost everything of any worth there."
Dr Willar was different. He'd been in the army, used it to pay for the schooling that got him his degree, and he hadn't just been on the sidelines. He'd seen action, a great deal if you went by the hushed conversations around the base when he arrived.
Sherlock sat on the toilet lid, smoking his first cigarette of the day. Half past two; he'd made it through half the day without having to light one up, so that was good.
"You took a risk texting me," Sherlock replied. "And a further one by letting me into your car."
Greg was already gone by the time they got back to their seats, which was just as well as neither of the men wanted to see him.
"Did you know before I told you I loved you?" John asked, standing suddenly and taking a step towards Sherlock.
John rolled his eyes and quickly underlined the question.
Derrick uncapped the pen and wrote the first two words, before grumbling and handing the pen back.
He didn't ride fast, after all, couldn't at that point. He'd only managed to ride again recently. He found that riding had the benefit of reminding his leg that it had full range of motion and resulted in a less pronounced limp than he'd started with. The pain was fine. Pain was cleansing. Pain was, well, more contrition, he supposed.
It was the first time he ever told anyone. Mycroft was silent for a long time and Greg thought he wasn't going to explain. It was alright if he didn't want to, he wouldn't pry.
John nodded and threaded his fingers together in his lap.
He took the rest of the photos and brought them into his room, pulling a large rusted box from the back of his closet and opening the top. He swallowed down on the nostalgia the move caused and sat crosslegged in front of it, setting the photos aside for a moment.
"Mostly," Greg replied. "Don't mention the paperwork when you're in the academy. Reckon some of us would've given up."
And, god, he could get used to that. He really could. He was almost tempted to bring the man home with him, if only for the convenience of having him again in the morning. It wasn't that Sherlock didn't
"Yeah, well, it's long past closing and you're in my bloody flat, again I might add, so I think informal fits. I take it you aren't here for cold Chinese and a pint," Greg replied smoothly, eyes fixed on the match.
"I don't-" Mycroft tried.
They exchanged rings Mycroft had been saving for six months, thanked the judge and were done. It was official.
Sherlock had been put up with a family in the town where the transport picked up the new soldiers for the base. He was currently assigned to a dignitary who was supposedly important to the whole world, and was meant to spend his downtime trailing a seemingly unending list of up-and-coming enemies of the Queen.
There was a loud rap on the door and he stood quickly, opening it and nodding to the man on the other side.
"I'll make tea," Sherlock spat, standing so quickly in his excitement that he knocked his foot into the coffee table with a yelp.
John was saying all of this while looking at his mobile, and it occurred to Sherlock that it might have been due to discomfort. He nudged John's knee and the man looked up, lips pursed.
John set the new ice pack down and wandered towards Sherlock's bedroom.
John was pulled from his thoughts as the lift door opened and Sherlock walked out. He jogged to catch up and then matched Sherlock's stride.
John let his palm press to cover Sherlock's and closed his eyes. When he felt Sherlock close his hand and grip his own he let out a sob that made the curtains billow and the lights flicker.
John's heart felt as if it had crashlanded in a field. He could barely breathe. Who on earth was this man? What had he done to give himself away? Was it a look? Was it the way he spoke to Sherlock? His brain was going in two different directions at once, worried about how Sherlock knew and reminding him that he wasn't gay...not really. He was...something in between.
Sherlock wasn't sure why it seemed important, but he stored away the fact that John had eaten precisely half of his own omelette.
He went about making tea and breakfast, eyes flitting back to the screen even as he knew he would have to hit the refresh button to get anything to come up, and resigned himself to wait.
"Fuck me," Sherlock countered.
They got into the lift silently and rode down to street level secretly glancing at one another and completely oblivious to the people around them. It's not that every single person was watching them, that wouldn't happen for another half a week, but a few shot them knowing looks and one even opened her newspaper and glanced between it and them.
"I'm fine, just...leave it," John interrupted, laying back down and sighing. "Are you from the business office? I heard one of you was coming in for me to sign some papers. I legally have another week before you can kick me out, you know."
Sherlock flapped his hand and rolled his eyes. "I'm hardly as bad as that. Tell me something about yourself, something I haven't already figured out."
Lestrade got the door open in just enough time to find Sherlock pulling out what they both knew was a file of cold cases, labeled 'Sherlock' in red block lettering, kept for particularly boring weeks. Lestrade's eyes went wide as Sherlock stuffed the whole file into his coat.
The left side of John's mouth ticked up. "Pray?"
"James," John huffed, showing his anger a bit, as he thought he wasn't being taken seriously.
But...perhaps that's why it worked. Sherlock was dripping in sex and acting frail and confused, and the checker was feeling the savior, and Jane was LIVID.
'Rude,' John signed, rolling his eyes.
John bit into his tongue a little harder to keep from squeaking and had to look away from the interaction.
TWO YEARS LATER
Sherlock had seen some segment on people who wrote letters to soldiers, telling them to hold out for peace or some other such nonsense, and they weren't considered bad people. They were doing a service. This would be very much like that. A service for a serviceman. He would be this army doctor's friend when he had no one else.
"Isn't that-" Greg started.
Sherlock sighed, face stuck to the worn leather of the sofa, and closed his eyes tightly.
"Buggering," Jane grumbled, closing her eyes.
It was genius. The woman knew that her husband hadn't been caught up in any such thing. By going along with it she surely saw it as throwing suspicion onto a gang of thieves. She schooled her face into a different form of shock, this one false, and nodded.
"You know I detest the taste of beer," Mycroft replied, pulling off his coat and hanging it by the door before turning back around to frown at the small flat.
"Shouldn't you, I don't know, tell someone?" John asked, looking over his shoulder as if the murderer himself might be listening.
"Shower first, I think. I feel like you used a gallon of lube," Sherlock said, sighing as John's cock slipped out.
On a side note, I received a comment a while back from a reader who was concerned that they might not speak English well enough. It was deleted before I could respond, so I'll respond here:
He read through the stories he could find that he thought he might like over the next few days. One stuck out in his mind and before he knew it, he found himself writing a sort of prequel. A few paragraphs about how the two men met. Background.
Sherlock looked up and felt suddenly light-headed.
"Second, no shit talking. You don't get to call me names or make fun of me, and in exchange, I won't mention that the major issue in our 'marriage' is your uninterested cock," Sally added.
John took the receiver from her, not sure he'd ever be able to breathe comfortably again, and held it to his ear. "You know, you've given us away. Mrs Hudson knows I'm not going to see-"
"I don't know what you mean," Greg said, turning away from Mycroft and missing the fact that they were going up, not down.
John let his head fall to the side, not really minding the hand. "I did. Take it that was a good call."
Totally dull, totally normal.
The next morning Sherlock walked into the building with purpose. John was already at his seat, looking a bit less stressed out than he had the day before. Sherlock breathed deeply and went to sit next to him.
"But...wait, the stories in your books are..." John began, his brain clunking along after the uptake.
"Trousers mended three times," Sherlock began, "look of hunger. The dark circles under your eyes and bloody callouses on your fingers suggest you're working yourself almost literally to the bone. Yet you can't afford to get your shoes fixed, walking about with holes in the bottom of both. You've know this woman for quite some time, but instead of looking at her face when you speak, your eyes flit from her purse to her necklace. You're desperate. Desperate men do desperate things. I think it's best if you don't see what might happen if you try to steal from a woman in front of myself and my companion. We're rather public spirited."
John was his soulmate. How on earth had that-
"Yeah, well, we should get tested and then I can fill you with a gallon of-" John teased.
John couldn't believe it. Honestly, a DI admitting his addiction to a sex worker in broad daylight to a man he'd just met. "It's, um, brave of you to admit." John said, uneasy and growing more so.
He started on Sherlock's buttons and spoke to him, his voice a rumble in the almost dark. "Let's get this off now, shall we?"
"Oh, you brat," John chuckled. "You brat."
"Perhaps," came Mycroft's response.
"Obvious to you," John said, fingers stroking through Sherlock's curls.
With that John turned on his heel and stormed back into the room.
"Good morning," Sherlock said , grinning. "Oh, John, you must come see."
Sherlock looked over at him and scrunched his nose up. When he sat up, crossing his legs and facing John for the first time that day, it was such a change that John's breath was taken away. John nodded, as if he needed to agree with himself, and Sherlock cocked his head to the side.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat back and John did his best not to snort.
"Do you honestly think the dead man's left hand will mind sharing shelf with your milk?" Sherlock replied. "Would your severed hand mind? Your liver?"
"No. Why him?"
John chuckled to himself and went to get a towel from the loo for the madman's hair. When he walked back in Sherlock peered up at him and held his hand out, as if it was nothing, as if they'd been friends for years and John wasn't anything to cause a fuss over.
Sherlock sighed and crossed his arms. "You really think it's a good idea to be picking someone off the street for sex? You know you could pull at any local pub, don't you, doctor?"
A little pain before it all gets soothed.
last two if you're so bloody eager."
Now, after reading the full four chapters, he was more interested in the relationship, in how sweetly, how gently, the doctor treated the nurse. It horrified him, the intensity of emotion that came with that last scene, with those soft moments and the imagined breeze pushing at the curtains. He wanted to be in that room so badly, wanted to be in that bed, in those arms.
"Then quit standing about all posh-like and let us show you the way," Samuel said confidently.
There was a quiet moment when Sherlock thought things might turn South, but it passed.
Mrs Hudson opened the front door and Sherlock rolled his eyes at John before moving to help her with bags. "You're just as bad at her."
I wanted to hear about the injuries. I was only interested in myself.
"Like this?" John asked, running a hand up and down Sherlock's thigh.
"Oh, God," Sherlock moaned, head falling back as John took in more and more of his shaft.
The girls go out for food.
"Awkward?" Sherlock supplied.
Sherlock laughed, the thrill of the earlier chase coming back with new adrenalin. "Don't know when you'll run into a knife wielding ex-husband."
He'd known the man less than a week and that was barely at all, wasn't it? He wished he had Merrick back. Merrick was good for walks like this. When Merrick was there he looked less like a fool when he spoke aloud, the dog paying close attention to his intonation and looking up at the right bits.
"Anything you want," John answered.
Sherlock continued to moan as John sucked at just the tip of his prick, tongue playing with the foreskin and hand stroking his shaft with just enough pressure.
John set some money down on the bar and stood. "Sorry, uh, I have to go. I'll get you the next one, yeah?"
At the end of class, Sherlock stopped her at the door and nodded towards her desk. She walked back with a sigh and waited while the other students left. When the door to the lecture hall finally closed for the last time, Sherlock leaned towards her with a grin.
He didn't know at the time that going to war would shake that feeling, that a battlefield was very different from the A&E, that he would doubt his ability with his mate's bodies in his arms. But that, that would come much later. In the meantime, he felt as if his father would come around. He was sure that the man would see him succeeding and be proud in a way he hadn't been since John was six and wanted to grow up to be just like the man.
"And your publisher," Mycroft said, eyes not leaving Greg's.
John set down the letter for a moment.
"You'd like it if I had work today, wouldn't you?" John chuckled, not at all put off by the man's behavior.
And, oh, how a single word could remind Sherlock of what he would miss so much. The feeling swelled as John sighed and left the sink to take his seat across from Sherlock, hand towel carefully placed over one knee.
John waved him away and promptly burned his tongue on his drink. Just another day in paradise.
"It's not...I'm fine," Sherlock admitted, the concern in John's voice prompting him to, even as it seemed to fill some need deep inside. "Memory technique. I often use it to pass the time. Simply forgot to check my watch."
Jane sighed and held her head in her hands. "Yeah, well, ringing off now."
He hoped that this semester would be fruitful. He hoped that his new residence would contain the proof he needed. He was, against all odds, hopeful.
Mycroft relaxed back in his seat across town. It had gone about as well as he had thought it would. He knew it was a bit soon for Sherlock, but it was close to too late for Jane. The woman was spending much too much time holed up in that bedsit with her gun.
Sherlock licked his lips and John's smile fell open, eyes darting between Sherlock's eyes and his lips. He obviously recognised it as the invitation it was. Well versed in body language then, practised.
Sherlock shuddered and his tongue managed to join in, and things suddenly became wet and hot. The push and pull, the addition of teeth, and John was finding himself frighteningly close to spilling over right there. By the broken noises Sherlock was making, he was in the same predicament.
What the two times had in common, was that outside his body he was not alone. There were others there. It wasn't how people usually described a sense of togetherness with the world, or a feeling that they were 'not alone'. All that feel good, warm and fuzzy, return from the dead because god loves you crap was preposterous. It was what people wanted to believe, so it was what got plastered on the news from time to time. No. There were other people, other dead people, and he had seen them.
Sherlock huffed a laugh at that. "Hardly out of practice, though. You take very good direction."
"Marry me," John replied, "marry me again."
Sherlock winced back and only just managed to keep his fingers from being crushed. He looked up with a frown and John raised his eyebrows in challenge. He'd forgot who he was dealing with. John didn't let him get away with anything. It had something crashing around in his chest at the thought; ostensibly his heart.
"What are we toasting to?" John asked.
When Mike actually smiled, John ground out an angry 'what?'.
The first night in the bedsit was awful. The lack of Internet connection was honestly what pushed him over the edge. The place was pale and empty and felt incredibly dead. And there was no internet. No bloody Internet, which meant nothing to keep John's mind off the blank walls and the too-small bed, and the feeling that the room was slowly getting smaller each time his mind drifted. Yes, it was awful.
"Good," John said, a bit of concern still colouring his face, "good. Breathe. Just like that."
John's mouth hung open for a while before he slammed it shut.
"The only time I've ever been in love was in the Army," he admitted.
The door opened slowly, the street lights behind the figure there lending him a dramatic air not unlike the figure itself, and Greg watched as his boss walked through the door.
He did three days later, inquiring about a relative that might live west of London. Mr Tollance affirmed his suspicion and Sherlock explained to him that the red clay outside the window and in the parlor could only have come from one place. Mr Tollance called the person, his nephew, and invited him to dinner on Sherlock's suggestion.
When John was finally done with his last notes he hurried back to his office to find Sherlock tapping away at his laptop. His personal laptop. For a second, wind seeming to rush in his ears, he stood frozen in the doorway.
John snorted and breathed deeply against Sherlock's neck. "Sleepy boy. Have I worn you out?"
Sherlock let the mouse hover over the comment button for a few moments before slamming the laptop shut.
John set his laptop aside and walked over to the door, listening through it. He could hear Sherlock walking and moving things around and was wondering what he was doing. That was when he heard the grunt.
John snorted and licked his lips and Greg had to put a stop to it at that point because the look in his eyes was practically pornographic.
Mycroft scowled and walked to the fridge and Greg went back to watching the game.
Sherlock felt himself smiling back, that soft, sweet smile of shared exhaustion. "Well, John," he replied, enjoying the name on his tongue, "I just happen to have the answer to the first issue."
_____
Sherlock bent over to plug the tub and turn on the water and Jane got an unadorned flash of her chest due to the oversized mirrors lining the wall. She looked away quickly and bit the inside of her cheek. It was just a pair of breasts, she told herself, nothing she hadn't seen before.
John conceded to seeing the army shrink, after the chaplain didn't manage to bring him any solace. He was a gruff man, which helped. John didn't know what he would have done if confronted by some gentle and open person who acted like he could emote around them. He would have probably kept his bloody mouth shut.
So, before he was interested in dead bodies, Sherlock was interested in the dead.
Sherlock kept his menu up until the waiter came, worried that conversation wouldn't come easily. He felt his tongue was too slow and frowned to himself over his choice of early drink.
After the sermon was long over and John was standing before the vicarage saying goodbye to the stragglers his spirits were lifted by the giddy way Merrick left his side. Surely, no one else in the town had any particular draw on the dog.
"Getting a boyfriend," Sherlock said.
Sherlock huffed and shook his head, stopping his movement as he realised exactly what he planned to do. "Shut up!"
"Obviously. It wasn't there before we-" Sherlock trailed off, eyes flitting over Jane. "Let me see your left palm."
"Tell me what you are," John demanded, thoroughly in his element and loving it.
He was never alone, surrounded by nature and fickle humanity.
John felt less awkward about reading some of Sherlock's book the night before. "Oh, yeah? That's good."
"I need to drive now," Sherlock pressed, hand going to grab the keys from her.
"This isn't what I bloody wanted!" Greg shouted. "What I wanted was to be your significant other and there's nothing significant about being your fuck buddy. You don't deserve to get comfort from me. Not after everything you did."
"Hard day?" the barman asked, cleaning the already pristine bit of counter in front of Sherlock and grinning stupidly.
"What looks good?" John asked, inching his seat closer to lay a hand on Sherlock's knee.
"No," Mycroft said softly.
"Why can't you just bloody ask?" Greg hissed, taking both their cocks in a spit slicked hand and thrusting his hips.
He made tea, a whole pot for one person, and sat on the edge of the bed staring at the far wall. He needed a comfortable chair and a small side table and a bloody gun. The unfortunate thing was that he knew it would be easier to get his hands on a gun than the other two items, even in a city overflowing with discount furniture. The secondhand chair would even cost more, unless he could find it in a kip somewhere, and he never quite got over the (possibly erroneous) uni story of the sofa that gave everyone in the science department crabs.
"Have a seat," John said, sitting down as well and crossing his legs. "The plan I'm drawing up will get us on our way to what I believe is the best outcome. A root canal seems to be in the cards for you, I'm afraid. I'll make it as painless as possible."
Sherlock pushed his shoulders back and looked suddenly much older than his years. His sureness was daunting. "If I fail to add to my wealth of knowledge, to challenge it, to push my brain in new directions, I commit a crime against myself. Knowledge, unseen-to, vanishes."
_____
"Gregory," Mycroft murmured.
"If that were true," Sherlock shot back, "you're solve rate would be better than mine."
It took nearly a week, and the next chapter of John's story, for everything to blow up. The chapter, written late at night while John lay guilty in bed, was rather steamy. In it, the scientist and doctor had some long-awaited sex and lay in bed afterwards grinning and kissing. Sherlock read it and nearly lost his mind.
The second he was out of the shower and clothed in his favorite pyjamas, he sat down to write. While he recounted his day, his leg shook, heel thumping the floor. 'Oh,' he thought, 'John will really like this one.'
It was...easy. Easy to pretend this was normal and go about it as if it wouldn't end badly. Sherlock barely knew anything about him, and, though now he could see him a bit more, John felt he really had nothing to give. He wanted to keep the comfort that was laying in bed holding the person you cared about, but it didn't feel possible to do so.
His people. Arrogant arse.
"Sherlock is back at the vicarage. In the library," John explained.
The man may have been gorgeous, but he obviously didn't know how to make coffee.
"Three days," John murmured to himself.
Sherlock's good mood melted. "Be careful with what you say next."
"Marry me," Greg said. "Tomorrow. Next week. I can't wait."
"I'll bring the skull," Sherlock replied, not showing even a bit of concern.
"You really are something else," he murmured, lassitude threatening to direct him to the closest bed.
He didn't have much hope for it, as this John fellow wasn't the best conversationalist.
_____
The last bit was breathy and Sherlock felt his mouth go dry as John ran a hand through his hair.
'But you aren't afraid of trouble,' the reporter, now one hundred percent John Watson, replied, 'are you?'
"I love you," Mycroft corrected.
"Yes. Where do you live?" Jane asked, voice sounding unused.
"It's just here," Miles said, kneeling and pulling frostbitten frozen dinners and soupy expired veg from the box and onto the floor.
"My brother is a pest," Sherlock agreed in a stage whisper. "What exactly-"
Get married? Yes, because there was another Sherlock Holmes out there waiting for John for when this one died of a bad case of the dramatics.
"S-Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock replied, taking the man's hand. "What-what's your first name?"
Sherlock ushered John up the stairs and into a crowded flat and then pushed him towards the sofa. John simply stood there with his mouth hanging open as tea was started. He closed his mouth resolutely when Sherlock finally joined him in the bizarre sitting room.
"Do you ever..." Sherlock asked, voice unsure, "do you ever feel lonely?"
John unpacked the ham sandwiches and took his glass of water, lifting it to his lips and sipping it as he watched Merrick round back to them, ball in mouth. Sherlock pulled a piece of ham from his sandwich and traded Merrick for the ball, drawing his arm back once more and letting it go. It soared through the air and bounced twice before Merrick stopped looking at their food and went to find it.
Sherlock took in a quick breath and laughed nervously. "That's..."
"The thought..." Mycroft paused, "appeals to you."
Sherlock spun, tear-stained face twisting, and nearly crumpled to the floor. John took the few steps between them and held his face up.
So it was decided.
It was a depressing thought, because Sherlock was that person. He was the only person John considered a friend, and they'd only just met. It made John feel like a bit of a failure. But honestly, what was he meant to do? Get a backup friend?
"You're very," John panted, hands going up to run through Sherlock's hair, "very good at this."
John laughed, and for the first time Sherlock could see it with his own eyes, as well as feel the warmth. He was beautiful when he laughed. Radiant. No wonder the lights always flickered.
His screen name, DoctorJohn, always made him cringe, but it had been all he could think of at the time. He was comfortable telling himself it was the pain medication that took away all his sense of decency, and had decided to be happy that he hadn't gone with DoctorLove. That had unfortunately been an actual option he'd filtered past.
The boy, mid twenties when he passed she reckoned, had been standing there in the back garden for the past hour while she made dinner and ate. She'd watched him through the kitchen window and finally took pity.
And no, it wasn't a question. John had made the mistake of rolling the pen towards Sherlock's hand earlier that morning when the man had needed it. And, Christ, it hadn't been out of kindness or a liking for the man, it had been out of sheer need. He NEEDED Sherlock to bloody shut up and the man was saying the word 'biro' over and over again while doing a shite job of actually looking for one. John honestly thought he'd attempt to jump out the window if it went on any longer.
God, if he could return to that choice and do things differently. He would write back, yes, but as himself. A simple 'Sarah's long gone. Did you mention injuries?'. He wondered if that would have worked, if he could have pulled it off, because, yes, John did enjoy conversing with him, but surely he imagined breasts whilst doing so.
Sherlock curled in on himself, a smile pulling at his lips, and closed his eyes.
"It's good to see you, Major," John replied reflexively.
"You do realise that sending a sedan to pace me isn't the same as an actual invitation, don't you?" Lestrade asked dryly, removing his coat and jacket and leaving them to hang over the back of a chair.
Sherlock ran his hand along John's jaw and pushed his chin right, then left, looking for missed hairs or shaving cream. He tilted John's chin down next and pulled a small comb from his pocket, perfecting John's hair so that every strand was in place. Finally, he fidgeted with John's tie again and nodded.
When he remembered that Sherlock couldn't hear him he went and pulled the covers up over Sherlock's body. Sherlock blinked up at him, brows furrowed, and John placed a hand on his shoulder.
"We should, that is, could we," Sherlock tried, swallowing and finally looking at the floor. He couldn't ask for what he wanted, couldn't seem to find the courage to form the words. He hated himself, all this time wanting and he was dumbstruck as to what to do.
"Coincidence, surely," John said, smiling weakly.
"It doesn’t have to change things," he reiterates his words from before, and hopes John will understand what he’s offering him.
is going to
"). John has never done anything like this before, but he's happy to find that Sherlock's signature trait of always throwing himself head-over-heels into everything he wants to do and then giving his all to achieve perfection also comes into play in the bedroom. He himself might be the more experienced one, but Sherlock is nothing if not adventurous.
Sherlock obeys, getting up onto the bed as well. He spreads his legs over John’s, sitting face-to-face and framing John’s hips with his thighs, reversing the position they held earlier. John puts his arms around him to pull him even closer against himself. “I want to do this properly,” he then says, kissing Sherlock’s cheek. “I’m in the mood for it tonight...Is that okay with you?”
Sherlock nods, his chin bumping against the side of John's head.
Her shoulders twitch upwards in a defiant shrug.
, that he thought he was lying in bed with his now ex-girlfriend when he woke up doesn't seem like such a great idea.
Finally.
Encompassing all that he sees
"Yeah, baby," I pant into the damp heat burning my lips. "I love it… I love you…" His legs begin to shake, and I find that my nervousness has almost entirely disappeared. His responses are proof that he likes this, and I want more of them, and stronger ones, right now. "
, John thinks.
, and he tries to dismiss the sting he feels at hearing his words.
“You misunderstand me, John,” Sherlock responds plainly. “I
like it?
” he forces out and shivers violently.
John shivers at the feeling of ten long fingers splaying across his abdomen. He tries—but fails—to keep his reaction to Sherlock’s touch at bay as the stack of plates in his hands wobbles dangerously.
John opens his lids again, but doesn't turn around. It's private, this moment. He wants to protect Sherlock from taking the blame for his decision, but still he doesn't dare interrupt whatever is happening between the two people he loves most.
“I love you,” he whispers. “We’re together
There’s really nothing else I can think of to say.
There are unshed tears in his voice, and when I release him after a last gentle lick, his fingers slacken and caress my hair, so softly, building a stark contrast to the roughness from only moments before. The sensuality of it all is overwhelming, and my pleasure mounts. I wonder if I should wait, give him the chance to reciprocate, but I cannot stop myself. I have to give in to it, or I will go insane. My heart aching with affection and his taste still lingering on my tongue, I press my face against his thigh and stifle my needy groans, my hips rocking back and forth more and more quickly, my lungs stinging with exhaustion.
He's talking quickly, anxious to relieve himself of the words before his courage leaves him. Sherlock is still gazing at him in silence, his eyes inscrutable. He doesn't reply right away.
I’m only half-joking, and the look in his eyes shows me that he knows. He gives me a sweet, but challenging smile and kisses my temple.
His expression is so raw, so open right now that it gives John a twinge. He’s never seen his friend look like this before, not once in all those years. Not even when they touched each other for the first time. This is Sherlock with
"I shouldn't have said that. I behaved like an arsehole."
He knows it won’t be enough to go deep, but he wants to be inside the other man’s body
Seeing Sholto again has caused long-suppressed memories to resurface, and he's aware of the fact that this might be a reason for the lingering unsettling feeling in his stomach, for the annoyingly persistent inkling that this is all
“The newspapers were right all along. I want you to tell Lestrade; I want you to tell Mrs Hudson, and Molly… In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.”
Sherlock's stomach clenches with guilt. Does John think he

John is back.

to me…"
He’s definitely crying now, and John gives him one last, gentle swipe with his tongue and then pulls away to look up and see his face.
They get a case the next morning, and Sherlock slips into deduction mode and stops eating or trying to sleep altogether for a few days, and it's good. He doesn't think about John and

He laughs one of his rare real laughs then, and the sound makes me fall in love with him all over again.

, but he’s very insistent, and in the end we make a compromise. Three more days of pampering (“You’ve got to

John wishes he could travel back in time to that very first day and do everything differently. He regrets so many things. The sensation of warmth and peace and
“The floor doesn’t seem to be the right place to do this,” he says lowly, an almost inaudible question mark hanging in the air when he's finished.
“Yes,” he hisses, and I know he understands. “Yes,
“Yes. It’s starting to affect me in a way it never did before---”
Silence.
“Alright,” Sherlock mumbles and pulls John’s tongue into his mouth with remarkable skill.
He doesn't know what this will become, doesn't know if they'll make it in the end – but he's looking forward to more "data", more Sherlock, more of
For a brief, hyper-aware moment I wonder if that was too much, too soppy, but no – he likes it. He cranes his head until he can brush my ear with his hot lips and balls his hands into fists.
I cannot finish. How sure am I of Mrs Hudson’s loyalty? Is it worth the risk? And what is the alternative?

"I'm not a genius like you… but I can read attraction, Sherlock. I can read

He makes fusilli with spicy tomato sauce – Sherlock's favourite pasta – while Sherlock rests on the couch, watching
“Thank you,” he says and shakes his head. “Sorry. I’m not laughing at you. It’s just--- Thanks for trying to spare my feelings. And yes, I do. Want to talk about it, I mean.”
John laughs as well then, right into the kiss, and squeezes Sherlock's arse in response.
It's so intense that he feels like he's being ripped apart, like it's tearing right through his middle, leaving him open and raw, and the liquid heat of his seed might as well be blood, might as well be his
John watches his daughter try to comprehend what he's telling her and wishes he could make it easier for her, and he feels guilty,
“What are we going to do now?” I ask. “You must have some kind of plan.”
"What do you mean?"
Everything is wet and sticky and wild and
“I did inhuman things while I was away,” he mutters. “Maybe that’s why.”
Thinking about it now, John finds that he likes thunderstorms after all.
“John.” He seems to be sensing my distress and lowers his voice to a calming murmur. “Get comfortable. Tell me what you were doing when Mycroft called you.”
“Because his mission was important. For him, for me, for you even. For Britain, for the world.”
“People, John. Moriarty’s people. But don’t occupy your thoughts with them now – Mycroft took care of them.”
“Do you want my mouth, John?” he then asks, speaking right into my ear. “You can take it… I’ll let you take whatever you want…”
“Open your legs a little more,” he tells him.
,” I whisper. “Yes…”
John, lying beneath a pile of blazing wood, struggling to free himself. Choking on smoke. Blistering skin, screams, panic-widened eyes. The smell of burning hair, burning flesh. More screaming. John's voice calling out for help, for someone to save him, for Sherlock,
He doesn't stop until he's all the way inside, until his loins are pressing against Sherlock's buttocks, and they stare at each other in the mirror, drawing long, shaky breaths and groaning softly in between.
This is right.
"I don't think so. I think he expected something like that to happen. And if he
, and replaces the teasing finger on John’s cock with his whole hand to stroke him in a loose grip that makes up the perfect counterpoint to the gentle thrusts of his other hand.
John bites his tongue to distract himself from his own need and gently cups Sherlock’s testicles in his palm, rolls them between his fingers, and sneaks a fingertip further down and back to brush his perineum.
“I didn’t like it with
"Yes," Sherlock mumbles, and John can tell he's doing his best to smile. "I am. You're here. That's all I need."

"But it's not an excuse, Sherlock. There
“I--- It’s just a drink with a colleague.”
He sits on the edge of her bed for a little while longer, just to watch her sleep and enjoy the first real quiet moment of the day. As he looks at her peaceful face, he wonders if she senses what she’s done for Sherlock today—and how she’s helped him learn to accept himself a little more.
"Hey," he says. "Are you okay?"
if I have to wait for much longer. “I’ll go.”
"Of course I'll take care," he answers. "What do you think is the point of all this?"
"Feel free. I'll join you in a moment."
"I really wish I could see your face…" he says. "Feel like turning around? Letting me watch you…?"
John licks his lips, carding his fingers through the downy hair at the back of Sherlock's neck.
“I can manage,” I tell him.
Sherlock scoots over and John rolls the condom down his length, carefully, his tongue sneaking out to wet his lips, and then he takes the bottle of lube and slicks him up with long, tight strokes that make little bolts of lightning flit through his veins.
I’m not allowed to pick them up from the airport. Mycroft says he’s got a car waiting for them, and that we should meet at the flat. Less suspicious. Sherlock wants to stay under the public’s radar for a while – no need to let everyone know that he’s back before he’s up to his former strength.
. John is inside, warm and alive. He has to see him, just this once. His hand tightens its grip and pushes down the handle and he opens the door, just a little bit, just to be able to peer inside.
“No, I’m coming in.”
“But you have to live--- in between all his things! Wouldn’t it be easier---”
"Stay," John tells him softly. "You’re perfect like this."
He’s decided he’s going to surprise Rosie today.
"It was a trick of the light. You haven't eaten in a while, and you're tired. Come," John says. "I'll show you."
John raises his head and looks at him, desperately trying to make the depth of his love for him show on his face, and Sherlock returns his gaze with wild, wide-open eyes and sobs, biting his lip to stifle the sound.
His own death, and John's.
“I know…” I whisper against him.
He misses a beat, but then kisses me back and grips my arse, kneads it slowly. His testicles are already full and drawn up tight, just like my own. They feel so plump, and yet so tender. His chest is heaving. We kiss again, and our tongues entwine even as we pant into each other's mouths.
. It’s more than John can take, and he stops teasing him and takes him into his left hand to give him a quick, tight stroke from tip to base. Sherlock's toes curl into the duvet he’s lying on.
"I think this is the first time in all of our acquaintance that you ask me for food. I normally have to pester you to eat."
John looks forlorn in Sherlock’s faded light-blue T-shirt (the least tattered one he could find), but it brings out the colour of his eyes in a way that causes Sherlock’s stomach to flutter and clench. He’s also given him an old pair of jeans, which he had to roll up so as not to trip, his thickest dressing gown, some socks, and, of course, a pair of pants. The thought of his clothes on John’s body, of soft, worn-out fabric rubbing against warm, golden skin, drives him insane, but he tries to block it out.
“Stop,” I whisper hoarsely. I do not want this to end yet. “S-stop!”
what he thinks about me, John! I don't need you to make me feel better about myself over a pretend relationship! It's humiliating!"
“Love you,” John whispers, reaching to Sherlock’s temple and smoothing away an errant curl there.
We grind against each other and meet in another long, wet kiss that speaks of all the things we’d do to each other if he wasn’t still hurt and if we had the patience.
“God, I--- I love you too,” I moan into the kiss. I don’t think I’ve ever said
He’s actually quite excited for the opportunity to show off their little family, to watch Sherlock speak about the brilliant things he does, and to meet the parents of the students Rosie speaks so fondly about. Sherlock probably won’t be so keen on interacting with the other people, but that’s fine. They’ll make it work; they always do.
Sherlock leans his forehead against the cold window pane and closes his eyes. All of a sudden, he feels tired. Drained. Everything hurts.
My heart takes a leap, but then they unlock the cuff on his right hand and transfer it to my wrist instead, chaining us together.
“I forgive you, John.”
“Why don’t we leave that to him?”
, he thinks, trying to amuse himself when yet another flash of lightning streaks across the bit of purply-black night sky he can see through his window and the following violent bang makes his ears ring.
"I know," he replies. "I heard you."
"Sorry, John. Go back to sleep."
I gently bite his left buttock, catching a bit of taut flesh between my front teeth. He groans. Then his hand is there, two long, elegant fingers coated in thick, milky salve, and I pull his cheeks apart to reveal his entrance, rosy and soft and so inviting that I can hardly contain myself. Still - I need to make sure this is something he wants.
“Yes,” I say. “That would be lovely.”
"Okay?" he asks again, because he wants to check, give John an out if he needs one.
Sherlock nods, and John reaches for the remote.
“You trust him more than you trust me?”
“Hmm. Okay.”
Nothing has been making sense ever since he died, and John doesn't give a fuck about what Ella says or what she thinks might help him cope. He
“No, John. You haven’t let me down. And I won’t let you down now by telling you things that will endanger your life.”
Sherlock sobs.
John chuckles.
When John returns to the sitting room, he’s stunned by the perfect scene that awaits him. Sherlock has turned off the television and dimmed the lights, creating a romantic ambience, and the thick, woollen blanket that’s usually kept neatly folded on the sofa is now spread before the fireplace. He’s sitting cross-legged on the blanket, gazing up at John with an expression that is equal parts
"I know," he says. "But you'll always be beautiful to me."
, Sherlock…" he tells him breathlessly, his eyes still squeezed shut, and kisses his temple. "God, you feel---
He’s not shouting yet, but he’s raised his voice, and I hope against hope that there are no other people sitting in the waiting room right now.
He opens his lids and looks at me with so much pain in his eyes that I feel it hit me like something solid, something alive and vicious that’s threatening to sweep him away in its wake and leave me alone to grasp at thin, empty air.
He turns towards her then and shakes his head.
“Oh God,” he mutters. “Oh
Russia. India. Tibet. France. Germany. What’s next?
… not yet…" comes the sleepy reply. "I just want to lie here with you for a bit…"
When he reaches the place he's aiming for, Sherlock doesn't look embarrassed anymore. He's lying there spread out in front of John, his breathing accelerating at the first contact of John's hand with the silky skin of his penis, and John grins and grips him tightly to feel his blood pulse through his veins.
It all comes back to him.
Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and I have been confirmed as targets by Mycroft’s “source”, but I’m not scared of Moriarty’s hitmen. Mycroft might be a cold-blooded bastard, but he’s nothing if not efficient. His boys will take them down before they’ll even be able to aim, let alone shoot. It’s weird to know that a minimum of two armed snipers are following me at all times, but I think we’re safe, all three of us. What I’m scared of is being without him for who knows how long, of having to pretend he’s dead, of not being able to contact him, talk to him,
“Humiliated
By the time he'd shot the cabbie and Sherlock treated him to some Chinese takeaway, John had managed to get a hold of his hormones again. He knew that what he had stumbled into there was good, more than good, and he didn't care how many creepy brothers Sherlock had or how difficult it might turn out to live with someone who called himself a "high-functioning sociopath". Sherlock was unlike any other person he'd ever met before, and he wanted more of him. All that he could get. And so he went to bed in the upstairs bedroom that night, still high on the kill and the spicy food and
"Thank you," I sigh and bury my face in my hands. "
“Brother mine,” Mycroft says, one of his feet already on the threshold, but Sherlock just nods, and then suddenly they’re embracing each other, holding on tight.

…" John grumbles his approval and smiles around the slick flesh he's sucking on.
"What happened?" Mycroft interrupts him. "Are you injured?"
Sherlock moans and hooks his thumbs into the waistband of John’s trousers, grazing the top of his buttocks as he does so. The contact is electric.
He looks around himself in confusion, and it all comes back to him with so much force that it causes him to stagger on his feet.
John's stomach churns. If this is Sherlock's version of an
“But we’ve just slathered you in sunscreen! That’ll all go to waste.”
A silent moment passes by. John's hand slides down the side of Sherlock's neck out of its own accord, coming to rest against the collar of his shirt.
Mrs Hudson looks at the ceiling for a moment, then back at the two men.
– in John's bedroom.
Biting back his frustration he slides his palms down John's sides and then cups his buttocks to keep him from moving away.

John laughs then, a real laugh, and it gets rid of most of his apprehension. They're

"I'd--- I'd take care of you! I'd never let you deal with it all on your own."
I can't answer, not as long as he keeps doing this - which he does. He's
"Enjoying
"Come upstairs with me," John says again, his voice deep and thick like velvet and sweet, forbidden things. "I know where you were about to go, Sherlock. What you were about to do."
"You didn't?"
"Thank you," he says lowly. "That was beautiful."
"You're gorgeous," Sherlock breathes, and the sound of his own voice startles him – and John as well, apparently, because he gasps and opens his eyes again.

"Oh God, yes," he says throatily. "Keep going."
John wears a beard now.
I want him to rub his face against the side of my neck as I run my fingers down his spine.
"I want you," Sherlock says, rocking his hips slowly, deliberately, dragging himself all along John's length – up… and down. A long, hard shiver runs through John's body. "All of you," Sherlock adds, his eyes blazing, as if his meaning hadn't been obvious before.
“Yeah. And it’s--- I just--- I can’t. I’m not open for anything new yet. It’s too early.”
, don’t stop!”
"Oh," Sherlock whispers hoarsely and turns his head.
The rest of the room is barely illuminated now, but he can still make out details. Everything looks softer like this, calmer. Sherlock smiles shyly.

Sherlock inclines his head in acknowledgement and then looks at his brother, who gets up without a word and picks up his coat and umbrella from the other chair.
is alright anymore, and Sherlock knows it won't ever be alright again.
They're in John's bed, naked, rolling around and snogging and touching each other all over, and John's memory of how they got here is sort of hazy, but he doesn't mind too much.
at work. She's going out with her girlfriends tonight ("I'll be out when you get home - you don't have to wait up!"), and that means that he'll get one more whole day to try and get rid of that unbearable feeling of missing out.
“It’s okay… Just--- in and out,” he then breathes and nips at my bottom lip.
good… Oh---
John is afraid he'll faint.
The tip of his tongue bumps against me on the “l”, but is gone again far too quickly. I whimper, and I’m not ashamed of the sound. It’s okay to show him what he’s doing to me. He’s reduced me to a complete mess by talking to my cock for barely a minute, and he deserves the recognition.
is normal tonight. There's a small glass vial holding two pills sitting on the bedside table on John's side, a bottle of water next to it, and despite being sure that this is how it's supposed to be, John tries to ignore its presence for the time being, because he's not finished yet.
"Hey," he greets him and steps beside him, locking eyes with his reflection. "Are you finished? I need a shower too."
"I was asking you about the ink stains on the murderer's sleeve. But if you're preoccupied, we can always postpone this."
He exhales against my neck, and goose bumps spread all over my back and arms.
" I moan and throw my head back against the pillow when my back arches off the bed and my arms and legs go tense. "Oh GOD!"
It’s three in the afternoon and I’m dying of boredom. The clinic is quiet today – the most interesting case I’ve had so far was a toddler with a peanut stuck in his left nostril. I stare at the paperwork piling on my desk and debate getting some of it done. There’s time now, but it’s so, so
He grumbles and makes remarkably short work of said tie and my shirt, which then both join his clothes on the floor to our feet.
, John…”
. Sherlock grits his teeth against the impact of John's thrusts - it's been much too long for him to still be used to it -, but doesn't complain. This is what he wants, after all.
In the evening, Mary asks him if he's okay.
"Well…" he says. Somehow it's indeed liberating to finally talk to someone about it all. "I've tried my best to avoid labelling myself – it would have made it all too real."
“Yeah?” John grins as he brushes his fingers against the back of Sherlock’s ear. “Well. That scar says otherwise.”
"Well… it worked. I loved your sand circles. I knew I wanted to be with you quite early on as well. I was too blind to see that this holds true for
John gapes at him, his hand stopping its movement in mid-wipe.
John chuckles vaguely, putting his hand over Sherlock's where it is resting on his stomach, and is asleep again in an instant.
I exhale into the crook of his neck, bite his shoulder, then lave the spot with my tongue to soothe the pain.
"I made it for you," I say.
He's shaking violently and gulping for air, unable to gather his composure. He knows he's asking for too much, too soon, but he dreads the thought of ending his life in the knowledge that his daughter hates him for doing what he knows is the only way.
He purses his lips and nods.
"You've already said sorry so many times, and I forgave you long ago. You know that."
I nod.
"Did you now," is all he replies.
He wants a quiet life, a life with Mary, and his job, and maybe they can buy a small house? A flat of their own would do as well. Maybe they can even have children, start a family. She's younger than him, so they've still got time. He's ready to settle down.
… I surrender…” he slurs.
doing, being allowed to touch him like this, and, suddenly light-headed and overwhelmed, he reaches for him with his free hand and grabs his upper arm.
John smiles tiredly.
“At Kitty’s flat… when we met Moriarty… I
John shivers from head to toe, then reaches down and does as he’s asked. It’s a strangely unfamiliar sensation, given that he's done it before, but not uncomfortable enough to make Sherlock want to stop, and he knows that he’ll feel better in a moment, as soon as John is all the way in, as soon as he starts to move. It will be so much better then. The best thing he’s ever felt.
Sherlock swallows audibly, and for a brief moment, the apprehension in his eyes is back. But he does as John says and spreads his legs so that John can move between them.
obeys and sucks me into his mouth to go down deep right away.
“Guilt?”
"Why are you laughing?" he asks, his tone an interesting mixture of amusement and insecurity.
“Alright.”
“So… how did not getting
Sherlock isn’t sure whether he should be happy or upset that John is still there when he finally enters the sitting room again, freshly showered and dressed in his favourite suit. He feels slightly more comfortable, now that he’s equipped with his usual armour of impeccable style and impassive expression, but the latter is difficult to uphold with the cause of all his troubles so close by.
right now, his fingers leave my cheek and he hooks them into the collar of my shirt to pull me down towards himself.
“An apology," Sherlock rambles haphazardly. "It’s all true.”
He’s just finished preparing a large mug of steaming Lady Grey for John when the man himself enters the kitchen and, after a moment’s hesitation that feels like several days to Sherlock, clears his throat.
It's okay.
"It's easier for me like this," John suddenly murmurs, his voice throbbing through the haze of lust filling Sherlock's head. "Being the one--- doing the work. I'm…
They lie motionless for a minute or two, breathing together, and then John experimentally flexes his hips to push himself against Sherlock's hand.

Sherlock lets out a long, shaky breath and leans down to lick John's throat, and then he pulls out almost entirely and comes back with a smooth, controlled, absolutely fucking
," Sherlock moans in a soft, very un-Sherlockian manner, and leans his forehead against John's. "Are you--- does it--- hurt?"
"Come," he pants into the kiss. "Come with me."
My heart beating an erratic rhythm inside my chest, I rub our noses together and place a small peck on the corner of his mouth.
I growl in frustration and push my crotch against his thigh, and he shivers and draws me closer against his front to wrap his arms around my neck.
Trembling fingers come up then to trace his ears and card through his beard, and he hears Sherlock swallow.
It doesn't sound like Sherlock at all. It sounds fearful and small and broken.
He sinks into the mattress a little further, his hands holding on to the pillow now, and then Sherlock spreads him with his thumbs and slips both of them into him and
Enjoying the buzz of the alcohol softening the edges of everything I’m feeling right now, I think about telling Sherlock about Mary, but then remember that I can’t. Who knows when I’ll be able to talk to him again? In one month? Two? Six?
Sherlock wakes up to another person breathing into his ear. For a brief moment he's startled, alarmed even, ready to bolt, but then the events of last night catch up with him and he feels his body relax back into the mattress.
John nods.
Sherlock doesn't reply, but just licks the last blob of tiramisu off his spoon, making a show of it, and raises one eyebrow.
, he's always said so, in no uncertain terms---
He takes a loud, deep breath.
," John repeats. "Please.
He is probably still in hospital now – Mary insisted. She's probably there with him, sitting by his bedside, watching over him as he sleeps. Or they're talking, quietly, holding hands. Maybe she's kissing his brow, caressing his hair.
“All the time,” Sherlock replies.
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart. But he's in so much pain. He wants it to end."
John slides off his body and lies down next to him, and Sherlock immediately moves closer to snuggle up against his side. John is surprised, but tries not to let it show. This facet of his friend’s personality is new to him. He wraps his arms around the taller man, and Sherlock puts his head on his shoulder. John plays with his tousled hair and looks at the ceiling, breathing in the scent of what they just did, and he knows that this is what he wants, what he’s wanted all along.
I try to breathe through my nose and let him plunder me, my lids fluttering shut without me telling them to. He pulls at my bottom lip with his front teeth, then lets me go and grips my face, runs his thumb across my cheek, my chin, searing my skin with his touch.
John blinks at him, confused.
"It's okay, J---" he starts, but John doesn't let him finish his sentence.
"I take it as a compliment," Sherlock quips, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
,” John rambles. He crooks both fingers and nudges Sherlock’s prostate, then presses into it and massages it with his fingertips, trying for the quick, rhythmic circles Sherlock always enjoys so much. “You’re so good, so fucking gorgeous—
“Go.”
talk. But if avoiding the issue is enough for Sherlock, it's enough for him, at least for now. It's all still so fragile between them, and he's afraid that insisting on addressing the events of the past might break the bond that they've re-established, might rip open the healing wounds all over again. So he stays quiet and lets Sherlock take the lead.
Sherlock sighs softly and then opens his mouth to speak.
"I'm sorry," he says. "We should have considered that."
John exhales loudly, then moans, and it sounds as if his soul was being tortured. Sherlock closes the distance between them and wraps him in his arms to hold him tight. John groans again, his face pressed against Sherlock's neck, his beard scraping his skin.
“I’m---” I say stupidly, with no clue as to how to continue.
?" I ask him teasingly.
Sherlock has never heard him sound like this before, but he loves it, and he loves being the reason for it.
What if John leaves?
Sherlock slows down eventually, and his instinct is perfect – the waves of ecstasy running through John’s body are ebbing away, and he feels himself getting too sensitive to be touched. A long sigh makes its way out of his throat as Sherlock cleans him up with a few last soft strokes of his tongue and then lets him go. He goes completely slack, melting into his chair, his hand still in Sherlock’s hair, and the other man exhales a shaky breath and leans his cheek against his thigh.
"Care to elaborate?" John asked, not noticing how Sherlock's behavior had relaxed him.
John, who had been reading the article over Sherlock's shoulder, was bright red by the time he'd finished. He swallowed roughly and sat back in his seat, clearing his throat. "I think people are reading a bit more into this than is, uh, uh, appropriate."
Sherlock was in a great deal of pain. It had been an hour since John woke, having actually slept fairly well, and he could hear the other man rousing and hissing. He wanted to go to the door, to knock and see if there was anything he could do, but he remembered how easily that sort of hovering could get annoying. Instead, he went about making breakfast.
"You don't like writing?" John asked, ears starting to turn pink from the cold.
"You're still inebriated," Mycroft grumbled.
"I said," and the smile let Jane know Sherlock had seen how taken she really was, "that now I'm going to take you home and work on that shoulder. You'll be stiff by morning if we don't do something about it now."
"What is your favorite thing to eat?" Sherlock asked, then rethinking, "scratch that, what is the thing you eat the most of."
"About last night," Sherlock said, trying to sound relaxed. "I was bored and you were hot."
To move it, to pick it up from his lap, would be bad, Sherlock decided. The last thing he needed was John waking up with a start. Instead, he went around the back of John's chair and leaned over it to read. John's head was slumped to one side, leaving bare an interesting patch of neck, and Sherlock allowed himself to sniff it once before reaching over John's shoulder to touch the mousepad. And then, yes, he smelled him again. It was...soothing somehow. Skin and Salonpas and something warm and spicy.
But, now that he knew John, Sherlock couldn't simply see him as the one dimensional character he'd been portrayed as.
"What the bloody hell did you say to him?" Greg asked, closing the door behind them and running a hand through his hair.
Her gratitude promoted her to offer them tea when they arrived at her home.
"You've not seen me, really," Sherlock countered.
"Why don't you have your people find out?" Sherlock teased, pulling his wallet out and slipping the newly trimmed photos in behind his bank card.
And, just like that, Sherlock was walking off again, heels clicking on the pavement with near ferocity.
"Look...the building is full up because of the convention. I could only manage one room on this short notice and they've cordoned off both yours. Sherlock can spend the night at his brother's and-" Greg began.
"Sally," William corrected. (John could have sworn it was Sandy.) "We aren't married."
Soon, Sherlock was coming, breathing in short gasps. John fumbled with his belt and pulled his own cock out, stroking it and promptly staining the sofa.
"Well, as nice that is a sentiment, you do realise that doesn't change my request," Sherlock said, hands moving in agitation to his hips.
Sherlock was livid. Well, he supposed it was agitation as Molly had done nothing wrong. Still, he stomped his way to the lift and stabbed his finger into the call button hard, over and over. He needed to talk to Mike. He, at least, wouldn't act like...like...like a soppy fool. This was nothing more than investigation, and Molly had acted like she was setting up two friends.
After hesitance and much deliberation, she called her brother Harry, waking him despite the late hour, and asked him if he had any idea what it was about.
He shook his head and clenched his hands. Not. Not. Not. Now.
"I'll sleep on the..." he started, looking around the small room at the cheap red and white hearts and streamers covering it, "well, sofa, I suppose."
John pulled back to look him in the eye, shock evident on his face.
Emotional short-sightedness was Sherlock's blind spot. He tended to see his frame of mind as solidly built and standing on reason. His surety did him in every time, although this time he'd known he would use again, just not why.
He hesitates.
After dinner, John and Sherlock do the dishes together. Rosie, on John’s orders, goes and puts on her pyjamas and brushes her teeth, and fifteen minutes later they are all settled comfortably on the sofa, watching
They kiss and kiss, and Sherlock almost forgets to breathe while trying to memorise the sweet taste of John's tongue in his mouth.
John puts down his bags, steps towards him, and holds out his hand, and Sherlock stares at his own feet and hands him a transparent evidence bag like the ones he sometimes takes to crime scenes. Inside, John can see the napkin with his message, carefully smoothed out.
He feels himself get angry - at himself, at John, at the man that made John what he is today. It's too much to handle, especially right now, with them in bed together and John's cock inside of him, and he can't
bit, after all. Either way, it's both terrifying and hilarious, and John tries to stay on his toes and keep up.
He exhales a loud, relieved sigh and looks up to smile at me. Then he licks his lips, and his gaze turns hopeful.
We’re silent for a moment, but then she clears her throat and smiles at me.
"I love you… I love you," he mumbles into the damp, glowing skin underneath his lips, his beard leaving faint reddish marks on alabaster white. "My darling. My sweet darling. You're beautiful. I love you. I love you."
“John.”
Everything
Sherlock smiles and drops the crumpled tissue on the floor before cuddling up to John's side and running his fingers through his hair.
I glance over his shoulder to where Mycroft is standing, still half-hidden behind the doorframe. He’s obviously not eager to witness this reunion – or he just wants to give us some privacy.
At seeing him so eager for it, a hot wave of pleasure ripples down my spine, setting me alight with desire, and my restraint falters. I groan and kiss his jaw, then the side of his neck.
there. He doesn't want to go back there just yet. For a second he wonders if it was a good idea to get wasted on a weekday – he has to work tomorrow, and his patients won't appreciate him coming to the clinic reeking of alcohol. But who cares. He can always call in sick.
, and for a moment his remorse makes him feel so sick that he's scared he'll throw up. He did, out of shame, out of disgust for himself, that evening. Several times. He knelt in front of his toilet and kept heaving until his stomach cramped and his throat was sore and there was only bile left in him. He didn't cry, although he really wanted to. He
He breaks off and shakes his head, lost for words.
“You’re worried they’re right,” he says lowly.
He nods and exhales loudly. “Okay.”
"Yes. Thank you. That's very… considerate of you."
“John?
wrong?
Sherlock’s armchair creaks, telling him that his friend has just risen from it. Soft, slippered footsteps make their way over to him, and then there’s body heat, right behind his back, and in the window’s reflection he can make out the tall shape of the most important person in his life.
I’m too empty to make another sound. My tears are dripping on his clothes, making tiny dark spots on the navy blue silk.
When they (not Mrs Hudson, and not Lestrade; I’ve seen to that) find me –
“You know you didn’t have to.”
this hair so much), he's busy licking the last traces of whisky off his lips when his friend smiles against his mouth and nips the tip of his tongue with his front teeth.
“Want you so much,” I whisper.
, but that is, of course, a ridiculous notion.
That’s when Sherlock closes the distance between them and wraps his arms around him from behind, and John’s eyes snap open again, his knees buckle, and he has to lean back and into the solid body pressed against his back to keep his balance. He’s surrounded by warmth, and the sweet scent of bergamot shampoo, and
“You’re beautiful..." Sherlock sighs and runs the pad of his thumb along the vein pulsing on the underside of John’s cock with perfect pressure, and he doesn’t sound the same as before – there’s fascination in his voice now, and reverence, and something else that John can’t put a name to, but that makes him shiver deep inside.
“I could spend the rest of my life kissing you, and I’d never get bored,” I whisper into his mouth after a while, my lips pulsing and swollen from where he sucked and nipped at them. “You taste so sweet…”
“Oh God.”
, he wants to tell him,
John watches them and his stomach clenches. It’s like seeing his friend suffer through a painful metamorphosis – his hard, protective shell has broken in places, has been doing so for a while now, and slowly more and more parts of him dare to slip out through the cracks. He’s afraid of it, and John can see why he would be. He’s been hurt so much before.
Watching Sherlock sleep is something John could do for hours on end.
He reaches out, Sherlock can see it from out of the corner of his eye, and puts his hand on his shoulder. Holds on tight.
John stares at him and wishes he was younger – he knows he won't be able to join him in this early-morning adventure. Despite the tingling in his loins, he's still soft, and he's sure he'll stay that way, at least for today. Two times in a row would have been a miracle – but that doesn't mean that he won't enjoy giving Sherlock pleasure and release.
"This is neither the time nor the place, Sherlock, but when we get home… and had some breakfast and maybe some sleep… I'll tell you time and time again. I'll
“Wait,” John pants and lifts his lower body, helping Sherlock to undress him, and when his pants have finally come off and he’s toed them off the edge of the mattress, he turns towards the other man and puts his hand on his stomach. “Please,” he says, breathing fast. “May I?”
John's hands ball into fists without him telling them to. He breathes deeply, consciously trying to stay calm. Losing control won't help now – but he's determined to make the other man
He dreams of John and Mary, dancing to the sound of him playing his violin. He wants to stop, wants to run from the stage; he can't
"That's just the heat in here. Hand me the--- sponge. I'll wash your back."
“No, I dare say I’m not. But if he had to choose, we both know whom he’d pick.”
He forces himself to open his eyes. It's an alien sight that greets him through a veil of his own tears. Sherlock's cheeks are flushed and wet and there are large, sparkling teardrops clinging to his long, dark lashes. He's staring at John with so much pity in his gaze that it's almost unbearable.
was my excuse again?”
When I wake up the next morning, he's still asleep, and I sit up in my makeshift bed and look at him for a while. He's lying on his stomach, which is good. His face looks peaceful now, but his cheeks still carry faint traces of last night's tears, and seeing them causes my insides to bubble with guilt once more. How could I not notice this sooner? He’s being haunted by what happened to him when he was away, and I never
like that, and his body shakes with the realisation of how much he’s missed that.
Hiding his right hand, which is trembling and wants to ball into a fist so badly by now, under the table, John inhales a shaky breath.
"John!
"I've always enjoyed your particular brand of romance," he replies.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, hesitates.
Sherlock utters something that can only be described as a grunt of delight, and John thinks it’s the most erotic sound he’s ever heard. His friend’s whole body is vibrating, and when he scissors his fingers to stretch him further, Sherlock’s hips jerk forwards and their erections slip-slide against each other, wet with lube and precome. It feels divine.
“Yes,” I say, wishing I could just go home to find some more of said specimens next to the milk and shout at him about it.
Sherlock is dead dead
He rubs his chin and cheeks against my chest, first one side, then the other, and the half-gentle, half-painful scraping of his beard against my already over-sensitive nipples is what finally causes me to come undone.
, and how can he ever carry on now? What about Rosie? His life's in ruins. He had it all planned out so perfectly, now that it was all out in the open. A new start for Mary, and a new start for himself. As a family. It's all lost now.
John still wonders if Mycroft would approve.
“You did that,” he replies, still breathing a little erratically.
He runs his hand through the cleft of John's buttocks, up and down, and feels his rhythm falter. The sound of his own voice, hard and clipped, shocks him, but he can’t stop.
John reaches out and brushes an errant curl out of his forehead, tucks it behind his ear, and Sherlock's whole body is covered in goose-bumps immediately.
I move lower, his scent clouding my brain. He obviously cleaned himself before he changed into his pyjamas, and I smell body wash and skin and something that must be his own, musky fragrance, and it's surprisingly okay to kiss him down there, more than okay, in fact, and I grin to myself and finally lick his opening, teasing the soft, puckered ring with the tip of my tongue.
And again.
No. What is John doing?
John!”
He presses his lips together and moans lowly, pitifully, then shakes his head as if trying to clear it, obviously unable to pull back or do anything more than hold on to me, not pushing me, but merely keeping me at a distance that is still, as far as I am concerned, not at all
Sherlock smiles, showing his teeth, and allows it, even meets John's tongue with his own for a short, delicious moment, before drawing away entirely and rolling onto his back to gaze at John from under half-closed lids. It's the mother of all
be the only one. I’m sure of that. I don’t want to lose you. But if you ever wanted to leave, I’d--- I’d let you go. I want you to be happy. I’m sorry you haven’t been happy for the last two years.”
Ever since the first time they did this, John has told him to relax before entering him, and Sherlock loves hearing him say it. No other man has ever been so careful with him, so gentle, even amidst the most passionate lovemaking, and no other man has ever managed to make him feel so protected and safe.
, he thinks.
this?"
The mattress dips when John sits down next to him, his smell the most delicious thing Sherlock's ever known, and he's glad that he's had the presence of mind to collect and save samples of it, and of everything else connected to this new facet of their relationship, for later use – it means that when it's over, he'll still be able to go back to the memories, to John's special room in his mind palace, which by now contains a large bed too, and revel in them whenever real life gets too much.
He distantly remembers a dream he's had while he was asleep, one about Sherlock standing on the roof of St.Bart's, his eyes wild, his voice desperate.
“Wonderful,” he then whispers and grins.
His voice is shaking a tiny bit, and Sherlock wouldn't be himself if he didn't notice.
"Relax," he whispers, and for a very brief moment the frenzied haze surrounding them disappears.
"Well," John babbles to get it over with. "So we've got to stick to it until this is over, and then we'll never talk about it again. And I promise I'll keep my nose out of your business in the future."
“I’m ready to go home,” Sherlock replies, wrapping his arms more tightly around their daughter and standing up carefully so he doesn’t awaken her.

John to leave.
” he presses out through clenched teeth, and I do it again, and again.
Sherlock sucks his bottom lip between his teeth and exhales through his nose, then grips whole handfuls of the sheet he's lying on and holds on to it, white-knuckled. He nods again.
Sherlock amuses him by deducing a few of their fellow diners, talking more animatedly than he's done in weeks, and John watches his lips move around the words and his hands draw ideas into the air and basks in the aura of energy that's surrounding the other man tonight.
John clings onto him, afraid of losing himself if he lets go. He hated Sherlock for leaving him, for ripping himself out of his life just like that, without saying goodbye or telling him the reasons why. He was in so much pain; he mourned him with all of himself, body and soul – up to the point of contemplating taking his own life, too, just to make it all stop. Only in the past six months, things have slowly begun to regain some semblance of normalcy again. He's got a job, a girlfriend. He's got a small box holding an engagement ring in the pocket of his jacket. This is not what he expected to find when he decided to come here this morning. This is not what he was prepared to see, to
The detective inspector nods, apparently finally accepting his fate.
deal with it the only way I know how. If it happens at night, I take my time doing it, getting naked under my covers and drawing it out until I'm drenched in sweat and out of my mind with lust. If it happens during the day, I take care of it quickly and efficiently, using any available bathroom whatsoever, resorting to my mind palace to evoke my favourite images of him to help proceedings along. In my head, it's not a battered ceramic sink I'm spilling myself into, or my own cupped hand. It's his sweet mouth, or sometimes his tight, muscular body, writhing beneath me while he smiles and breathes my name and bathes me in his own release.
I close my eyes now, too, holding on to the memory of you resting in my arms, and allow myself to float a while, the water’s unsteady surface lapping at my chin.
“It doesn’t hurt… It just feels---
"John… I've loved you for longer than I can remember," I tell him, mumbling into the wetness between our lips, tasting his unique, complex flavour and memorising every molecule hitting my tongue. "I thought you wouldn't--- I never dared to hope. I was--- too scared."
“Ohhh… ” I moan when he’s all the way inside, and he bites my earlobe and begins a slow rhythm of in and out, pushing against my prostate with every thrust, the lubricant coating his fingers making slick, pornographic sounds that only heighten my excitement.
I shrug.
We stare into each other's eyes.
His voice breaks again and he hiccoughs lowly before another sob shakes his shoulders and makes Sherlock's throat hurt just from listening to it.
Sherlock stirs and slowly opens his eyes.
He makes his way up the stairs silently, trying to keep his steps soft and light – he can't talk right now, not to Mrs Hudson, anyway. He needs to concentrate. He needs to let it all flow over him,
On her way out, she puts her hand on the back of my neck for a moment.
“I’ll always love you,” I mumble when we part, my lids fluttering open again to find him gazing at me with so much serious, intense affection in his eyes that it takes my breath away. “Sherlock… I promise I’ll love you for the rest of my life.”
--- my---
He wants to stop thinking about Sherlock's icy, unseeing eyes as he lay on the ground with so much crimson blood running down his face. He wants to stop tearing himself apart by wondering whether he could have prevented it somehow. He wants to stop regretting the things he didn't say while he had the chance. There's no point.
"I promise."
I’m upset, but I can't help it. I
“How’s your leg?” he asks me when we are once again nestled up against each other in my bed, stark naked under the covers after a long and slow post-supper kissing session that took us from the sitting room into my bedroom and involved a lot of touching each other all over, which, as I am sure everybody would agree, is best done while wearing nothing at all.
“Time’s almost up,” he then remarks quietly.
… Let it happen…" John murmurs, kneading Sherlock's hips and speeding up his perfect,
"John," Sherlock sighs. "You're beautiful…"
It’s a condom.

John huffs and bites the shell of his ear, tasting salt and
He chides himself for indulging in this neither new nor (usually) unwelcome fantasy while his secret object of desire (or is it the object of his secret desires?) is lying right next to him, so close that he can probably use his superhuman deduction skills to read his thoughts.

out of reach, and sighs deeply.
), too. He looks at his favourites and gives them special places, and when he eventually falls asleep in the early hours of the morning, he dreams of nothing at all.
“And sandwiches?” Rosie wants to know as she skips away. “Or biscuits? Or scones?” she babbles on, still giddy. “Oh! Scones! Please?”
“Mmhh, Sherlock… Look at you… You’re
I run my hand through his hair – because I’ve always wanted to do that, and because I sense that he needs comforting, too.
“Oh!” Sherlock hiccups, and John looks up to find him staring at him out of eyes that are glazed over with lust. He grins and does it again, and Sherlock’s legs tremble in response. “That’s--- oh,
"That was amazing," he mumbles tiredly, and then, when I stop mapping his body with my palms: "
"I liked it that you called me
"I can't imagine how you must feel, John," he tries again. "I'm sorry. I'm not good at this, as you know. I wish I knew what to say."
John is completely silent for what feels like forever, but in fact can't be more than a few moments, and then takes a deep breath.
"Sherlock," John whispers. "Don't you think I don't want to forget. I do. I wish we could erase what I did from our lives and start all over again. But if we do that, it'll come back and haunt us one day.
John knows that this is the truth – when they first got together, he found it hard to believe that no one had ever successfully tried to make Sherlock his, but the younger man was so endearingly unaware of his own sex appeal, at least at the beginning, that he soon accepted the fact that he was the only one who'd ever see Sherlock like that, with his guard down and his demons gone. And it felt
human in that respect."
His long, pale neck is extremely sexy, John muses as Sherlock moves his head against his palm, and because he doesn’t know whether he’ll ever get the chance again, he lightly pulls at the strands of dark hair coiling around his fingers to make him bare it a bit more, and Sherlock moans and allows it, his Adam’s apple bobbing when he tilts back his head and swallows audibly.
John reaches out a shaking hand and takes the condom. He

John huffs.
"Move with me," John says. "You can--- move. I'm… Oh,
He's naked, fresh out of the shower, and as he stands there in front of the sink, his skin still damp and his hair in complete disarray, he realises that he hasn't really looked at himself for a long, long time.
"Since we're talking about labels… yes. That's probably as close as it gets."
"You taste like bergamot," John whispers, trailing messy, open-mouthed kisses along his side, his hip, then coming back up to tease his navel with the tip of his tongue. "Do you taste like that
“Yes,” he repeats. “Oh
Mycroft exhales though his nose, loudly and pointedly.
“So what happened to this Moriarty bloke then? How did he get away?”
, you wonder?" He raises his head, and Sherlock suppresses the urge to flinch. It hurts to look at John like this, even if he can't explain how or why. "I'm

remark about the moral dubiousness of fooling small children into believing in talking animals, and even that one seems rather muted and half-hearted.
– slow, careful, and much gentler than it had ever been before.
it!" John snaps.
," Sherlock says and puts the back of his head on John's shoulder. "Hmmm… This is nice…"
Sherlock folds his hands in his lap and leans back in his armchair. Two steaming mugs of tea are sitting on the coffee table, filling the room with the rich, zesty aroma of Lady Grey – John’s favourite. He knows Sherlock likes other blends better, so the fact that he’s made it for him makes him feel a weird, hopeful kind of warm inside.
"You need to sleep, John."
God, his voice. My whole body is covered in goose bumps immediately.
he thinks.
They manage to rid themselves and each other of all their clothes even before they reach the bedroom, and Sherlock takes a last look at the floor and the trail of garments littering it before pushing John through the door and all but throwing him onto the bed.
John swallows. This is the hardest part.
Sherlock's pulse accelerates, a mixture of apprehension and curious expectation filling his insides.
“I love you, John… I’ve loved you for such a long time,” he adds throatily and kisses the corner of my mouth, and then he goes in deep and rubs that perfect spot inside of me again, harder this time, and I sob out a desperate groan and raise my head to pull him close and kiss him properly.
John grinned and opened the first condom, rolling it onto Sherlock's prick and giving him a good two strokes before he took up the tease with his mouth. Sherlock did his best not to buck as John sucked him off and prepared him at the same time. The man's fingers were a blessing and before Sherlock could find the power to say so, John had found his prostate and was circling it.

"Sherlock," John said, staring intently at the man's back, it tensing as he huffed in a deep breath. "I don't care how you figured it out. I've been planning this party for ages, and-"
John was sitting in class, diligently taking notes, when the subject was brought up. He'd thought it would be tackled as side note. It very much wasn't.
"No, I really-how do you know I have a sibling?" Jane asked.
"Sorry? There's something wrong with my face?" Jane asked, pulling her hand away.
Sherlock's lips twisted and he crossed his arms. "Two, three hours ago."
"Last time I try to pull one over on you," Sherlock said, lips twitching with the impulse to grin.
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know why I thought going to war was a good idea. I thought A&E would be similar, but I've never seen the sheer volume of injuries that I'm seeing now. And, Christ, that's not even what has me up right now, that's not the image seared in my brain. But I'll leave that till the end, so you don't have to suffer through it if this is too much for you.
"No, and call me Sherlock," the man replied quickly.
It was a tease.
Sherlock huffed out a breath and nodded, stroking himself sloppily and biting his lip. It took less than fifteen strokes to get there, to tip over the edge. And then, after clumsily removing his pants and wiping his hand, he fell asleep to the sound of John breathing next to him. Almost.
"You can use mine." His voice sounded strange to his ears.
Anonymous'
Greg opened it and shook his head.
John shrugged. "I've always wanted to get back into helping the underserved. The slums are much closer to the battlefield than anything country life could provide. I could lend a hand with medical issues as well as preaching. I've only just adapted to country life myself."
"Lights on in the middle of the night when no one was around and strange holes dug in the ground," she'd said with a huff. "I hope you boys can keep him busy."
There was a sigh and the shadows of John's feet moving at the bottom of the door. "It's just, you were cursing a lot. Do you need anything?"
"What?"
"Can you get it while she showers?" Sherlock asked.
"Jesus. Jesus. Jesus."
John stared daggers at Sherlock, and when the genius simply thrust his hips, he spun him by those blasted things and pressed him face first into the bleeding wallpaper.
"Happy birthday, love," John murmured, kissing Sherlock's curls.
Not another word was uttered as the cab pulled up to the hospital. Sherlock looked as if he was in shock, and John hoped that it was just his arm. He focused on that, on getting Sherlock into the building and safe, and not what he had just admitted.
Lord, the man had to answer the bloody phone in the middle of-
"When did you last receive jewelry from your husband?" Sherlock asked, as he went onto the next pair of earrings.
"I can't, I just can't believe," Sherlock tried. "It's overwhelming for me when things go right for once."
John snorted and looked to his feet. "Well, alright then."
John walked towards the kitchen, almost close enough to reach out and touch Sherlock. His head was spinning. At one time, at one time, but not now. "What does that mean?"
"Tell me what you see," Sherlock said, pointing to the body, "and I'll tell you what you miss."

After texting three times and getting no answer, Sherlock made his way downtown to see what on earth was holding Lestrade up. He knew they were having trouble with the latest case, why on earth would the local newspaper think to write on it if not to harass them, and had an idea he couldn't keep to himself. He had to see the body, it was that simple.
And, oh, how the new angle did interesting things to Sherlock's brain. John had pulled him down and forward, and his cock was so thoroughly buried that Sherlock's breath was knocked out of him. The thrusts were coming harder now and he was making weak little grunting noises with each one, and his brain was MELTING.
John took it and let himself be pulled to his feet. As he wrapped up the food Sherlock walked back to the vicarage, Merrick suddenly awake and glued to his heel. John laughed at the traitor of an animal and let them stay ahead, walking slowly and wriggling his toes.
When they were finally in their pyjamas and sitting on the other bed, John looked him in the eye and refused to look away.
He gripped the base and licked up the length of it slowly, eyes on John as he took the tip into his mouth, head tilted to the side. John ran his fingers into his hair and he let his eyes fall closed and tried to suck.
Sherlock hated him. Hated.
Molly lit up and bounced on her toes, her mood the stark opposite of the gore on her hands. "John! So good to see you."
John nodded.
John huffed out a strange laugh and ran his hands through his hair. "Yeah, well, would be nice to get out of the bedsit. Not sure I can afford a place in Central London, though."
"Is that, sorry, was that not what you were hoping for?" John asked, pulling him from his thoughts.
"Thigh?" Sherlock asked, dipping back into the small bottle and bringing out more of the white paste.
Sherlock was shouting now and gesticulating. "What do you care about the sign? Did he really pull you into all this? Did Mrs H even have a nephew?"
'Would've been able to look closer if we'd just walked home,' she thought. But, no, Sherlock had insisted that they didn't do anymore damage to Jane's shoulder, and had hailed them a cab out of nowhere. (Luck, not magic, apparently. Jane had felt stupid after asking.) Now they were pulling up to a perfectly normal coloured building, and Jane was looking around for 221. It was supposed to be close.
"Let me," John pants and blindly begins to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt, starting at his collar and working his way down until he has to pull it out of his trousers to reach the last button, and Sherlock isn’t wearing anything underneath, and then their fronts are touching, and John moans and slides his arms to Sherlock’s back to feel him closer,
"Just thinking about getting older, is all," he replies, fighting to keep his tone light. "It's stupid, really."
Without thinking, he raises his hand and tucks some tousled curls behind Sherlock's ear, using his thumb to trace the skin around the shell, so soft and velvety and hot, and Sherlock leans into the touch, maybe unconsciously, his lids fluttering, long lashes making shadows dance across his pale cheeks.
But before John can respond, Rosie comes bouncing into the room. “Daddy! Papa!” she says in awe. “You two look so, so handsome! Like proper movie stars!”
John wonders if what they’re doing is making up for two years’ worth of lost time, or atonement on Sherlock’s part, or him getting cold feet because deep down inside he is very aware of the fact that his haphazard proposal only six months into his and Mary’s relationship was born out of despair and grief, and who knows what would have happened if Sherlock had come back
John nods, readying himself for the conversation he knows they need to have, no matter how much he'd like to avoid it.
killed anybody. And I--- I didn’t expect to be quite so affected by it. I knew there was no other way – Moriarty’s network had to be stopped, to be weakened, and we know that a normal trial would have changed nothing at all… They would have gone free, and it would have started all over again…”
John smiles.
“Stop this violence!” Sherlock exclaims as he bounds upwards and heads for the door. “Go make me some tea and some breakfast, John,” he calls back over his shoulder.
“Oh God, Sherlock,” I pant. “Oh

Sherlock's scent all around him. Sherlock's hands in his hair. Tears.

I'll make you a list with instructions. You can come even--- even if I'm not here, okay? I trust you. You can be my deputy beekeeper. "
"Yes," John answers, still in that hushed voice that’s so unlike him. "Thank you, Sherlock."
– firing guns at half past one in the morning!”
“Are you still high?” I ask drily, and he laughs.
Heat.
They walk over to the bathroom and John does stand in the open door while Sherlock pees, and Sherlock tries to focus on the fact that it's just transport right now, and that John has seen him without clothes before, and that the things that come to Sherlock's mind when he thinks of

He’s losing his composure, and I’m almost happy that he is – it’s better than this cold, hard, disappointed voice. “And you said you’d wait for me! You--- you
"Sshhh. Let's go to sleep."
They're silent for a while, staring into the middle distance. John feels like a stranger in his own home. He thinks of Sherlock, out there with his bees, and wonders if he's cold.
"We wouldn't have Rosie if things had gone differently," Sherlock points out. "I think it was supposed to be like this."
, I see…"
“Can you at least come and take a look at the couple’s house? Look for some evidence we can use in court?” Greg asks pleadingly.
"Are you alright?" John asks and draws him out of the spiral of nausea threatening to pull him under. Maybe it's showing on his face.
you. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't do this now. You're going to die because of me."
He is interrupted by a deft knock on my door, the vigour of which I recognise even before Mrs Hudson’s voice rings out to verify my deduction.
"Let's go," John says.
I step closer and sit down on the edge of the mattress, and he makes room to let me move right in front of him, pulling at my calves and thighs until I’m in the perfect position for what I’m sure will be an amazing blowjob. I’ve already had a taste of those lips two years ago, and I want more.
Monday.
He misses Sherlock so much, and he's so furious with him.
“There’s all the stuff, all the science equipment. What are we going to do with that? I don’t know what needs doing. I thought we’d maybe take it to a school.”
“God, you're the most amazing sight,” I tell him, taking in his pupils, widened with want, his burning cheeks, his tousled hair. “Sit up against the headboard.”
Mrs Hudson often comes over on Saturdays to have a cup of tea with me, and I ask Sherlock over breakfast whether he’s ready to reveal himself to her.
"I don't think I've ever been in love before," he murmurs at last, sounding almost shy and thus completely and utterly unlike himself. "But from what I gather, that might be a very good explanation for what's going on inside of me whenever I look at you. I suppose I'd have to… experiment."
They leave the window open while they make love, and Sherlock
“Soon,” I repeat.
I’ll be home.
She's right in a way, a way she can't possibly understand, but she's also so, so wrong.
And his eyes.
"I freely admit that I panicked," he quips. "I'm sorry I was being stupid. I should have--- I mean, it's not that I wasn't infatuated with you right from the beginning. I was. But I missed my chance."
I almost laugh, but I don’t want to be mean. Mycroft was, in his own particular way, a great help during the last two years. I won’t gloat.
, Sherlock,” he pants, his tongue running along the insides of Sherlock’s lips, luxuriating in his familiar taste. “Mmhhh.”
“What hurts, love?”
"Yes…
…" John rumbles, his beard scraping the sensitive skin on the inside of Sherlock's buttocks, and then he works his tongue past the tight, puckered ring of muscle and moves it in and out rhythmically, shamelessly imitating what's going to happen soon.
, Sherlock. I should have been braver. I should have been a better man. A long time ago. Long before---"
John chuckled and held Sherlock tighter.
John was cooking the eggs, along with some friend bread and tea, and humming to himself. It was a song from the club, the one he'd purchased the record of as they were leaving. It was impossible not to stare. John's hips sashayed from side to side as he pushed the eggs around in the pan and his head bobbed.
John chuckled and licked his lips, feeling ravenous for the hope in Sherlock's eyes. "I suppose it's the least I can do, being the disappointment I am."
Sherlock paused for a second, a bit too reminded of his childhood. When he made his decision he nodded and turned around. "Come along."
_____
"It was a horrible prompt," John said, not explaining why he was sitting in the dark.
Sherlock had their trust. He'd been working towards that point for two years, being the catalyst for change that the group sorely needed. He made sure they were seen to at local clinics and took care of the abusive johns. Their guardian angel, someone had said, though he didn't see it that way. Doing what was right was hardly angelic, it was just right.
"Apothecary," Sherlock replied, watching Jane take everything in, with the nagging feeling that she was missing something.
"Well, should we call the police?" John asked, looking uncertain.
'Sherlock is buggering the HEAD TEACHER.'
"It won't come again," Sherlock said, eyes widening in glee.
"Nothing," the man said, turning in a circle and plucking a flower to tease Merrick with, "and everything."
"I think you'd better get inside," Sherlock said, licking his lips and swallowing roughly.
Sherlock scrunched up his nose. He always hated being stuck in the same category as other men. They were, he knew, mostly horrible. "What I mean, is that I had planned on leading. Because I had done the research. Now I see that may be a mistake."
"Madam Hudson," Mycroft indulged, using the woman's professional name, "has bequeathed her flat to a relative."
The actual big reveal
The new email showed up from anonymous just as John was wondering if he should have a quick wank, and he opened it with the fervor of someone getting a letter from a long lost friend.
Before he could do anything Sherlock had jogged down the stairs and out to where John was sitting. John stared up at him, the grief he hadn't felt in so long swirling around his head and making him sick.
Sherlock nodded, curling in on himself more.
"Which is why that Lestrade fellow was here tonight," John said, sipping his water and narrowing his eyes, and then cocking his head to the right. "Except...why was he there?"
"Really, John. Two years together and you truly believe I'd leave the house without some form of lubricant," Sherlock teased.
Sally snorted and passed the keys over. Sherlock watched her get back into the car, on the passenger side, and took a moment to breathe. At least he was wearing his own pants, he reasoned, at least he had that.
He panted and pulled his shirt off, climbing into John's lap and kissing him again. Now that the flood gates were open, it seemed, Sherlock was far from nervous. John was just fine with that.
Sherlock and John woke the next morning around dawn. They were wrapped in each other's arms under the covers, a luxury they'd only had the luck to experience once before. Sherlock squirmed against John and nuzzled his neck, the affection in him bubbling over.
John licked his lips and angled his body more openly. Sherlock made note and promised himself he'd do anything he could to keep that up.
"So...she was glad to see you," John said with a growing smile.
The light in the closet turned on, a soft glow beneath the door, and Sherlock grinned to himself. This was going to be exciting.
John huffed out a laugh. "You're the one that called me."
"Bollocks," Jane said, lips already curling into an indulgent smile.
Sherlock felt him still and he knew John was coming, even as his eyes wouldn't open. John's breathing evened out a little and he pulled out, laying Sherlock's legs carefully on the bed before standing. Sherlock let his head fall to the side and opened his eyes.
Sherlock sank down onto his bed. He obviously couldn't say that he was upset because they hadn't found any sign of any illicit behavior. He simply sat, his eyes adjusting.
“Oh,” came a nervous giggle, and the woman went on, “no, not like that. Silly me. Sorry, I mean, I’m from Saint Bart’s hospital, and we were looking over your resume, Dr Watson, and we think we have a place for you in the morgue.” When John didn’t reply, the woman clarified, “As staff, not clientele, I mean.”
"I didn't mean to say-" he sputtered.
"Seen a bit of trouble then?" Sherlock asked.
"Not a thing, dear," she replied softly as she went about making a new pot of tea.
John sat and Sherlock stared at the second seat before deciding John's lap was a softer choice.
SHERLOCK, John signed, taken aback by the sudden move.
"Not exactly ideal," Sherlock interrupted.
Christ, and he was out in the yard again, the rain falling through him as he ground his teeth. He felt like such a failure. He'd only just really got the hang of not blacking out and waking up somewhere else. It took him two bloody years, and now he was back to square one. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew it was due to the panic, that it was quite like the attacks he'd had as a child when his father had too much drink, but he wasn't ready to face that.
YOU WILL SOON ENOUGH, Sherlock shot back. I'M AMENABLE TO DINNER. SEND ME THE TIME WHEN YOU HAVE IT FIGURED OUT.
The climbed into bed together, John wrapping himself around Sherlock's back, and fell asleep with surprising ease.
He should have been annoyed. He was always annoyed when people didn't know how to use technology. He'd pulled Lestrade's mobile right out of his hands on more than one occasion to finish whatever the man had been trying to do. He refused to let Mrs Hudson touch anything with a screen for fear he'd be convinced to hang himself due to the outcome. He wouldn't even let her sign the gadget for deliveries.
"And you'll be my good little soldier, will you? Take everything I give you and love it?"
"It looks like you've got some reabsorption," the man said, opening Sherlock's chart and flipping through the pages. "The problem with re-"
'After years as a combat surgeon, Dr Watson came back to British soil-'
"I already pray for you," he said, his voice less sure than he wished.
“Thank you,” he whispers. “That was---
“Look at me,” Sherlock says. “Please. I want to see your reactions.”
wish to talk to you, but I still find it difficult to identify precisely what I’m feeling, and furthermore, to find the words to describe it.”
I take your hand again, rub my palm against yours, memorise your fingerprints pressing against my skin. How am I supposed to sleep tonight, without you by my side? How am I supposed to get up again tomorrow?
do you think?” I shout. “Hold back the dogs – we’ll be right out!”
"Oh God---" he moans when Sherlock teases himself with the pad of his thumb and clenches down on his fingers involuntarily as he does so. His imagination is running wild, sending a phantom sensation of slick,
"Stop it!"
” he cuts me off and glares at me. “You’re a medical man - do I really have to explain to you what would have happened if that bullet had hit you at a different angle? If it had ripped apart your main artery?”
“I love you, John. Always remember that.”
tight… It’s starting inside of you now, isn’t it…
There’s a small pause, in which I sense him weighing the pros and cons of letting me in on the details.
"You know I don't care for being nice. It's true," Sherlock replies and raises one expressive brow. "You're special, John."
“You are doing it right,” he says, without hesitation.
“I don’t know, Sherlock,” I admit. “I really don’t. I’m so sorry.” I cup the side of his face in my palm and caress his cheek. “But you’re not a bad person. You’re fighting for the right thing. Please believe me.”
Sherlock bites down on his bottom lip, looking incredibly young for a second or two. His irises have turned dark; they're almost all pupils.
He's on the floor, his back throbbing from hitting the hard tiles at considerable speed, and John's hand is on his throat,
"Same," he whispers. "To be honest, I thought it was all just a beautiful dream. I thought---"
Sherlock's face swims before his eyes, and John's got a split second to realise that that's partly down to the tears forming in his eyes and partly to the fact that Sherlock is leaning in, closer,
I saw her move," he says.
"He was very lucky to have you, John."
Sherlock swallows – John can see his Adam's apple bob up and down nervously.
"John," Sherlock eventually says and cups the older man's jaw in his palm. "I want you to stay. We can fix this."
The touch only lasts for a second, but John's legs find that to be sufficient to wobble a bit.
do I find that so sexy?) and then makes a show of nonchalantly sucking the remaining half of the sausage into his mouth and chewing it slowly, his eyes fixed on mine.
When John finally stops and moves up his body to kiss him again, he can taste himself on his lips, and it's still the most exciting thing he's ever done. John does not only want to do this to him, but he also wants him to share it, and the sheer intimacy of the act is what drives Sherlock out of his mind with arousal – every time. It feels dirty, indecent,
There’s a tiny surprised pause, but he gets himself together again rather quickly.
John's voice crackles through the phone connection, hitting Sherlock's ear with such shocking intensity that he feels he could reach up and
John moans at the sight of his usually so collected, so perfectly composed friend letting go like that and immediately returns to what he was doing before, going down deeper this time to run his tongue around the other man’s shaft, revelling in his sharp, slightly bitter taste. Sherlock cants his hips upwards, probably without meaning to, and John sucks harder at that and wishes they had some lube. He told Sherlock it didn’t matter, and it really doesn’t, but he never expected him to like this so much, and he wants to make it amazing for him.
After Evans had been arrested, Holmes “borrowed” one of the Yard’s hansoms to rush me to the hospital, even though I could very well have taken care of the wound myself. I told him as much, but he would not hear of it, and, tired and in pain as I was, I soon stopped protesting. If I am being entirely honest, I rather enjoyed being fussed over by him in such a way - it happens so seldom, after all.
She smiles, and I can tell she knows perfectly well that
. Oh God.
, even though he has no idea what it is. He wonders if John knows.
Sherlock looks away then, his lips quivering, and blinks a few times. John has seen him cry before, but the slow, silent tears trickling out of the corners of his eyes now are new to him. It stings to know he's the reason for them.
"I love you too, John," he says, still holding John's face, his eyes dark and intense. "I've never been good with words, but I do hope you know that. You're my all. I--- There's always been only you. Only you. Always."
He shakes off and attempts to tuck himself back into his pyjamas, but suddenly John is beside him, grabbing his wrist to hold him back.
Coming up in chapter 4:
John sniffs angrily. Like every time that happens, Sherlock thinks that this really shouldn't make him look as dangerous as it does. Especially not now, with him wearing that ridiculous striped jumper that makes him look so much younger than he actually is.
"I'll take that as a compliment," he jokes to lighten the mood.
“Mmhhh,” he hums against me, and the vibrations of his voice ripple through me, causing my cock to strain against his lips and begin to leak.
She shoots him a look that causes him physical pain, and he's shocked by how much
“Yes,” he slurs and pulls himself up and against John’s front to make room. John aligns his cock with his opening and then guides him back down and onto himself.
," John replies, and hopes Sherlock will understand - he's rubbish at big words.
“We’re
"My father died this morning."
“I know, my love,” I whisper back. It takes courage to call him that, and I hope I still deserve the privilege of doing so.
“My mouth, then,” he rasps into my ear, licking into it as he speaks. “My tongue.”
He turns his head and his eyes snap open, and I drown in moonlight blue infused with specks of gold and cry out, overwhelmed with the beauty of it all, unable to stop myself.
I breathe him in. He smells of tea and warm toast and his spicy, woody aftershave. I'm drowning in his scent, and I never want to come to the surface again. I'll stay here, surrounded by him, forever.
The plane has been wobbling for a while now, and the seat belt signs have been glowing for the past half hour, but John’s feeling alright – as long as the flight attendants are still on their feet, everything is okay.
. Became godfather. Promised to protect her at all costs. And then he got her killed.
He's picturing Sherlock slipping his hand inside his jacket, his long, nimble fingers making their way across his chest, his touch light, but determined. And suddenly it's no longer his stupid phone he's going for, but the buttons of his shirt, the zipper of his trousers---
"Well, if you're free later, we could draft out the next blog story together. I could use your help with the timeline," he then answers. "It's Rosie's day out with Mrs H today, so we'll be on our own. I thought I'd use the opportunity to get some work done."
I incline my head, trying to hide my relief. I would not dream of forcing him into anything he does not wish to do. But to stop now, after having this first taste, would have torn me apart inside.
"Patience, my love…" he tells Sherlock and himself in equal measures and pulls back to let his index finger join the proceedings.
When he turns and goes to Sherlock's bedroom, he feels Wilkes' eyes on his back. He imagines sharing this bedroom with his flatmate, imagines being allowed to enter it at will, knowing its scent and the way the sunlight shines through the curtains in the morning, and he imagines dragging Sherlock here by the collar, stumbling against walls and furniture as he leads him towards the bed to lay him down and---
). He dreamed about shock and fear and Sherlock's arms around his body, about happiness that surpassed anything he'd ever known before, and about the delicate touch of a soft mouth against his own. Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's pliant lips opening for him, his tongue, so shy and sweet, nudging John's, the low hum of his deep, velvety voice.
," Sherlock sighs against John's mouth, their foreheads pressed together, and it's so unlike him to speak like that that John's heart skips a beat. "You make me feel things I'd never dreamed of feeling before you came along and showed them to me. Thank you.
His heart beating in his throat, he circles his entrance with the pad of his middle finger, massaging the muscle to make it loosen up and pressing down harder and harder ever so slowly, and after a minute of teasing he feels the tight ring give way to allow his fingertip to slip inside.
From the way he looks at me, I can tell that he remembers.
He’s on his way back to London from a medical convention in Berlin, and they’ve apparently managed to fly right into the worst kind of weather that has befallen Dutch airspace in the last three months. Or ever. They’re almost over The Hague now, he assumes, but he can’t be bothered to check the in-flight journal for details. He’s tired and wants to go home, or, which would be even better, to Baker Street to see Sherlock and get his mind off a boring weekend spent with boring people in boring lectures that are now part of his boring life.
Your eyes are unlike any I’ve seen before. They’re the most striking of your features, pools of blue ice speckled with little drops of liquid gold, framed by dark lashes. They’re so mysterious, so incredibly intense. I forget the world around me when you fix me with your gaze; nothing else matters but you and your attention, focused solely on me. Right now they are sparkling like jewels in the midday sun.
Words fail him then, and he shudders at the images his guilty conscience provides him with.
“Well… As you said, whatever I have to deal with, you’ll have to deal with as well, and… I just want to know if you want to be with a man who’s not… free.”
In a very remote corner of his mind, he is aware of the fact that this feeling right now, this sensation of complete and utter bliss and abandon, is not enough to outweigh the impending pain of its aftermath, but he can't bring himself to care. John is wonderful like this. While a part of him enjoyed being the more experienced one the first time they were together, Sherlock now appreciates this other face of John - maybe because the other man seems more like himself now, more self-confident and adventurous, or maybe simply because being the one in charge would be too exhausting right now.
“Thank you. I
"I loved wearing this," John says lowly as Sherlock pulls his T-shirt off his body and drops it to the floor, where it joins the dressing gown already pooling at his feet. "It smells of you…"
“Now I feel special,” he answers, pleased with the gentle grin that this earns him.
Even in his despair, Sherlock can tell that it's
"That would be brilliant."
"Why?"
“Okay,” I finally say, my voice hollow, and let go of him. “Okay. Suit yourself.”
Out of the corners of his eyes, he sees Sherlock twist the bedsheet in his hands, his knuckles white, and it makes him proud to be the one to make this otherwise calm and collected person lose control like this.
One: As roommates, we work so well and I've gotten so used to his presence in my---
His heart is breaking, and it hurts more than anything he's ever felt before.
"Go," he pants, breathing fast, very obviously bracing himself. "Do it."
Sherlock pretends not to understand.
I go faster still, tightening my grip on my cock, feeling the memory of his fingers inside of me, remembering the way his touch caused sparks to spread through my whole body, like the tingle of an impending orgasm, but much, much more intense.
"How many lovers?" he asks.
John growls, sounding frustrated, but relaxes again and takes a few deep, measured breaths.
…” He hums and wriggles his hips to make his pyjama trousers slide to the floor. “I like the sound of that…”
John swallows.
“Hello, Watson,” he says as he kisses her cheek. “You mustn’t inhale that,” he adds. “I’m still not sure what exactly it does.”
He trails off, stammering, but he doesn’t know what else to say. He feels awkward all of a sudden, and he can’t remember the last time he felt awkward in Sherlock’s presence. The feeling is deeply unsettling.
“And he’s mine,” John murmurs coarsely. “All mine.”
The cool night air clears his mind a little, and he starts to walk. He feels like an arsehole for what he's just done.
“I know…”
"Yes," Sherlock sighs. "Yes, John."
John is fond of pet names; he calls Sherlock
He knows it's normal that this first, frantic desire eventually developed into something else, something calmer and deeper, and that, after a few years of being together, they slowly established more of a routine - carefully perfected, guaranteed to please and give satisfaction. And they still sleep with each other, albeit not as often as they used to. He still enjoys sex with John.
“Oh,” he murmurs, as if waking from a pleasant dream, and helps me by opening his cuffs and then shrugging off his shirt and his waistcoat at the same time, his muscles bunching up under my palms.
a lesson I've already learned."
“Oh, Bumblebee, John replies. “Papa’s fine. It’s just a bit of stage fright.”
loss,
“Don’t make rash assumptions… It might be more of a challenge than you think,” he replies instead, lowly,
"You're exquisite," he says instead.
There are tears on Sherlock’s cheeks again, and he’s gone completely boneless, as if he’d fall apart if John took his arms away from around him. He’s breathing fast, moaning a little in between gulps of air, his voice entirely devoid of its usual dark timbre and sounding much younger.
I break off.
"No! I was myself! I
"John," Sherlock pants. "
John almost laughs because his tone is so conversational – so
“Fuck, you’re so beautiful,” he grumbles and nips at his chin. “I want to look at you…”
I snort.
"Fuck," John pants. "Oh
He wants them to be dead. If they aren't, he'll find them and deal with them himself, with each and every one of them, slowly and with his bare hands. It scares him, but the longing to fight, hurt,
I nod and look after her when she leaves.
He fumbles for the condom she's put on the nightstand before they started and puts it on with shaking fingers, then gets on top of her and pushes in, thrusts hard right away. One of his hands is bracing his weight against the mattress, the other one is squeezing her breast.
together, still as one, even though their physical connection broke when Sherlock slipped out of John's body as he softened, and Sherlock feels the memory of John's tight heat around himself, faint and throbbing, and knows he'll never forget this first time for as long as he lives.
“I love--- doing this to you…” he presses out after a while, and I can’t help but admire his stamina. His command of his body is marvellous, his rhythm perfect. There's a fine sheen of sweat glistening on his skin now, and I run my hands down his spine until I can cup his arse.
"No," I say quietly. "I
one now, thus reversing the roles we play in the rest of our private and professional lives, I force myself to break the spell and draw back, almost too fast, causing Holmes to blink at me in bewilderment.
“Only if you do us the honour of sitting down and eating with us,” he answers and gets up. “And I think our Watson here needs something stronger than tea. If you’d be so kind to prepare the food, I’ll go and concoct a brandy and soda for the patient.”
He doesn’t know what else to say, what to do to make this better, so he simply closes the distance between them with three deft steps and wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist. The other man’s expression doesn’t betray any emotions whatsoever. John gets on his toes and bumps his nose against Sherlock’s, asking for permission, and when Sherlock tilts his head and closes his eyes, he leans forwards the rest of the way and brushes his lips with a slow, tentative kiss.
He hesitates, but then decides to go all out. When –
"You should definitely collect more data," he suggests lowly.
. He’s hesitant to put a label to it, but he strongly assumes that his friend is located somewhere on the autistic spectrum, so engaging in human interaction of this scale must be hard, nearly unbearable for him. He can tell Sherlock wants to experience everything he’s fantasised about, but he’s never been out of his depths to this extent before, at least not in his company. He wants to make him let go of his fears and just go with it.
Mary calls it hero worship.
“I’ve already told you. I needed to see her. My imagination had been, for lack of a better phrase, running wild. It’s okay now. If you need to hear it again - I forgive you. Nothing happened. You had a weak moment, and that’s okay.”
God… I’m going to be very---
“I’ll pull out,” he tells Sherlock and carefully draws back, trying to be slow and gentle.
“What else will we do?” he asks after a while.
His eyes meet John’s just as she says those words, and he smiles at him, and John smiles back. “Love you too, Watson.”
John nods.
Sherlock's arms tighten their hold on him at that, and before he knows it, he's being kissed again, gently, deeply, and in the kiss he feels the words Sherlock so seldom says out loud. He drinks them in and gives back in kind, and when they finally stop and get out of the bath with aching joints and shaking knees, the candles have burned down to stumps.
I snort, and before I realise that I might be going too far with it, I ask: “And you’re expendable?”
. You’re here with me. I know why you had to go away, I really do, but I’ll never let you go again. And I--- I’m sorry I was so focused on my own pain that I forgot about yours. I know I can’t take this back, but please… let me make it right.” I lean forward until I can smell his skin, his hair, my palms flat on the mattress, so close to his body that I can feel the heat radiating off him. “Please let me touch you. Please. I don’t know how else to--- I don’t know how---”
Sherlock is sobbing now, lost for words, and John wants to spend the rest of his life in bed with him to hear him make those noises, and to be the reason for them. He bites down on his clavicle and sucks, then lets go and licks the spot to soothe the pain. Sherlock whimpers and starts to shake all over.
She whimpers and digs her nails into his back, scratching him until it hurts. John revels in the pain that's grounding him to reality.
it… feel
Sherlock looks as if he wanted to laugh and cry at the same time.
,” he repeats, rolling his hips. “God, you feel
, and then allows himself to fall, too.
“Beautiful,” he repeats, whispering, and then he presses his face against my groin and nuzzles it like a huge cat, eyes closed in rapture.
“John Watson, you should be ashamed. I trusted you!”
"I have no idea how she managed to return the coat without either of us noticing, John. Neither do I know how she installed that sound clip on my phone – and made it permanent. That's the very simple reason why I can't stop thinking about her. She's one step ahead of me, and that's unacceptable. It baffles me that this bothers you so."
"I'd have killed him with my bare hands," he adds. "I can't lose you again."
"Too much?" he asks, still whispering.
he? He would have killed me with it.
It hurts a little, but not enough to make me want to stop.
“No… SHERLOCK!” I scream.
“Sure. I’ll just sit here. Enjoying the blissful absence of screaming.”
Hearing his name fall from John’s lips is almost too much, too intense, so Sherlock jerks himself out of it and makes his way to the bedroom to look for some clean clothes. Then the fire, and then tea, he reminds himself. Keep busy.
"It's okay," he says quietly.
"I'm--- sorry," the man says, and something about his voice sounds familiar. "I'm… God,
I start to walk towards the building, but, as expected, he stops me.
“You… Need
"No." She lets go of him and jumps up, drawing herself up to her full height and glaring down at him, and the effect doesn't get diminished by the tears now forming in her eyes. If anything, they make it worse. "No!"
beautiful.
He does not need to finish his sentence. I know what the consequences of that would have been.
He gets up and sees that John has folded his clothes and put them on the chair in the corner before he left. His insides in complete disarray in the face of this gesture of concern?affection?
"Would you like to take another shower?" he asks.
John doesn’t know what to reply to that; he’s so overwhelmed, so he just steps back into the other man's personal space and pulls his head towards himself for another kiss.
," Sherlock presses out, his breathing accelerating.
Donovan’s voice is ringing in the back of Sherlock’s head, and despite all his feverish efforts to drown in out, it just keeps on bouncing back and forth inside his skull. He’s furious with himself for letting her in like that, but he can’t help it.
me, slowly and in the best way possible, and I throw my head back and press my cheek into my pillow and whimper at the ceiling.
“When will that be?”
He chides himself for being so weak, but strides over to the window nonetheless, his body moving as if driven by an outside force.
Sherlock is silent for a while.
Boy, was I
Sherlock exhales a small laugh. “Am I?”
Sherlock doesn’t let go of him, but loosens his grip a little and caresses the insides of John’s wrists with his thumbs.
I avert my eyes again.
“Is… is everything going as planned?”
“I know. But John… You’re also allowed to take.”
“Two fingers, John… oh, so
John inhales a quivering breath, and then another one.
"John, please." Sherlock's softly spoken words float over to him, caress the sore spot inside him. "Come, John. Please."
eyes now, because he closes his mouth and just stares at him with an expression of intent curiosity written all over his face.
“No need.
Sherlock freezes at that, looking at him with an expression of complete and utter incomprehension. John is afraid he's said the wrong thing. It just tumbled out of him, just like that. Why do you love me, even though I hurt you so? Even though I hate myself?
"You're not the only one trained in close combat," Sherlock breathes, and then he switches off the torch and turns around to push the door open and step into what turns out to be another bedroom.
" he says again, his fingers digging into his own thighs.
It’s freaking me out.
"Sherlock?"
"Shut up," John grumbles.
"Git," John mutters under his breath.
He can’t be serious. He’s so selfless, so
"It was important to me, too. And--- I've got a surprise for you. If you feel up to it, that is."
When Sherlock wakes up, he's alone in John's bed.
John bit his tongue, let the clumsy question float in the air, and partook in a bit more ritual while Mike had a chance to notice the cane and course-correct.
"Come on," he whispered, voice husky. "Come on, now."
Sherlock knocked him onto the bed, kissing his neck and tearing at his clothes. John moaned and huffed out a laugh, allowing Sherlock to start unbuttoning his shirt for him.
"No time for eating," Sherlock replied, stamping the dirt down. "I've experiments to run."
"Look," John said, sitting up a bit, "if I was too forward about-"
John chewed his lip and seemed to think on it before hitting the flashing end button and turning the phone completely off. He shrugged at Sherlock's look of surprise. "Still not completely sure how to put it on silent."
"I know that," Sherlock spat.

"You knock me out," Greg said. "I fall apart. I just, I fall apart."
"Some things," Sherlock said, clearing his throat and starting again. "Some things need to be hidden. The world is..."
Merrick had never been so happy.
Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night to find himself completely wrapped in John's arms. He breathed in and nuzzled against his neck before he realized what he was doing. God, it felt fantastic. John stirred at that and pulled him even closer, fingers moving through his hair.
He made it home after Mycroft and found him in the kitchen cooking. He left his coat by the door and changed into his pyjamas before joining Mycroft in the kitchen.
John ended up paying for the cab, the shock of it almost dimming the shine Sherlock had managed to put on himself. Thank god the army had put his cheque in the bank, or he'd have looked quite foolish.
It was the third day with sun, the ground long dried from the previous bout of rain, but it was still fairly cool out. John locked up the vicarage, for he was a man of God but knew the ways of others all too well, and zipped up the lightweight jacket he'd found the first day he'd moved in.
"Several weeks," he replied, not sure why his voice was tight, "due to the healing."
"At first I thought it was for financial reasons," Sherlock explained, stretching and rubbing at his eyes with loose fists. "When it turned out that the wife was the one with the money I had to look for a different motive."
That hit John in the gut and he finally turned to her.
That, of course, didn't happen.
"Do you? Wonderful, I have concerns as well. You go first," Sherlock said, smile slimy and dripping with unsaid threats.
The room was painfully full, standing room only at that point, but John and his guest had been saved a table right in the middle of the action. The action at that point was a man with russet skin playing the piano. His fingers moved quickly, not caressing, but assaulting the keys.
Sherlock poked his head out the door at that second and started to scold her, his voice cutting out after the first word as his eyes fell on John. The flitted over him, for some reason taking clear note of his shoes, before landing on the flowers. Luckily, before things could become more awkward, Mrs Hudson pushed John along and went back into her own flat.
"Maybe a pencil case. A pencil case with sharp edges?" Molly said, well, asked, cheeks flushing.
The answer came via a short knock on the door frame at the front of the morgue. Soft knock, hard knock. Clear, concise, and to the point.
_____
That smile, that particular, crinkling, broken, smile! John could FEEL that smile! God, how peculiar! He hadn't felt anything in years and now there was a warmth spreading over him and he could barely move. He was stuck there soaking up the warmth, stuck there with that madman, and for the first time since they had met, he was happy for it.
"Vicar Watson," Greg said, finishing his own pint.
Sherlock smiled softly to John in the next breath, eyelashes fluttering. And, God, how could John have not been affected by that, how could he not have felt a tightness in his chest? He licked his lips and Sherlock's  smile broadened. For a moment, John thought Sherlock was going to try to kiss him.
"I'm...I'm a bit of a fan," Sherlock admitted.
"Perfectly reasonable," Sherlock replied with a small nod.
Greg chewed on his lip, still amazed that things were going so well with Mycroft, and replied.
"She was always a domineering woman. My father is afraid of her," Mycroft continued. "She still treats Sherlock and I like children."
John smiled at him in a way he knew gave away his fierce sentiment. "I somehow couldn't imagine you in a place without nature."
"Oh, now you'll behave. This is what it takes, isn't it? Me fucking the daylights out of you. Mouthy little brat," John said, huffing and grunting and resting his face against Sherlock's chest.
That’s something I didn’t expect after experiencing him in bed. He’s so loving, so passionate – am I really the first one who gets to see him like that?
"God, no," John said, leaning back a bit to look into Sherlock's eyes. "No. This...this was more. You know, it's happened quite fast, but this is...this is what I want."
And before John could reply Sherlock was going downstairs to rustle up some fresh bulbs, and John was feeling so much lighter.
The second thought was that the letter had mentioned injuries.
Sherlock gestured to John and John thought he might throw up. "Dr. John Watson, formerly of the Northumberland Fusiliers."
"Hush," he whispered. "Alright, alright."
Sherlock blushed and rolled his hips. John pulled off the rest of the petals on his arse and back before tossing the condoms and lube onto the pillow and pulling him down for one last kiss. Sherlock followed him onto the bed and rested on his side, back to John, clutching a pillow to his chest.
Sherlock nodded and let his eyes close against the light from the window. When John climbed back into bed Sherlock crawled to him and wrapped around him tightly. John chuckled and ran his hand through Sherlock's hair.
_____
"Cheers," John returned, standing and turning on the sink.
The lift settled again and Sherlock fumbled to close the door on the seventh floor and hit the button for the top; the office suite. John chuckled and shifted his weight.
"This was completely out of line!" the woman shouted at Sherlock.
Greg hummed and took it, popping the top off on the edge of the coffee table, and pulled on it fiercely.
Sherlock started to roll his hips and finally found a rhythm, rocking and lifting and sighing. The whole while he was transfixed by John's eyes. Deep blue and staring up at him. Deeper than the ocean. God, oh, god, so blue.
"Tickets?" Sherlock asked, wriggling his hips a bit as his brow tightened.
Sherlock was just as meticulous with oral hygiene as he was with the rest of his body. He flossed twice a day and brushed in small circles exactly as his dentist had suggested. That was why, when the dentist told him there was slight reabsorption below the surface on one of his teeth he snorted and told her to take another X-Ray. When she did and there was still a dark spot below the gum he slumped into his seat as she explained he would have to see a specialist.
"What will you do if she isn't right? It won't be like bringing a dog to the vet, Sherlock," Mycroft continued. "Are you prepared to murder her to put her out of her misery?"
Sherlock honestly didn't know what to say. Things had gone from so open and interesting to closed off. It was a business deal, he realised, and that wasn't what he wanted at all.
"I hardly think that's relevant," Sherlock huffed, arms falling to his sides.
"Grammar school?" John asked, giggling a bit.
John had been right. Suction wasn't an option on the left side of his mouth.
When he had finished reading the letter he folded it primly and tucked it into his breast pocket before picking up the pile of drawings again and leafing through them slowly, all the while wondering how this had landed in his lap.
"Really?" John asked, chuckling a bit in bewilderment.
Sherlock scrunched up her nose at that. “I had just about put together a plan.”
John nodded and set the book he'd been reading aside, standing and walking into the kitchen. Mrs Hudson was in town doing the shopping so he was left to his own devices. It took him a while to find the tea and he realised he'd been taking advantage somewhat. He cleared his throat at the thought and went about heating the water.
Sherlock was a bit flustered, eyes falling to the floor. "That's not completely-"
He stamped out his cigarette on the windowsill and closed it carefully before turning out the light and slipping under the covers. He forced his eyes to close and worked on steadying his breathing. If the house was really haunted, the poltergeist would be happy to disturb the sleep of the first residents in years.
Jane stood gawping for a second, it apparently being her new pastime, and then jogged up the stairs to find Sherlock going through her duffle, folded clothes landing on the floor in a pile.
Sherlock spun and walked away before Greg could finish.
They snaked their way to a smaller room near the back. The walls were quite possibly mahogany and the thick carpet was a deep red. Even the fireplace harkened back to a time Greg wondered if anyone in the building was old enough to remember.
And yet, he couldn't bring himself to regret it. He scoffed at himself as he realised how comfortable he'd become with John, how much he wanted his company. More than any person he knew; John was interesting. And not just the fact that he was a ghost, either. John was pushy and met him at every step, refusing to back down, refusing to bend to Sherlock's will. People didn't act like that with him. They were never so stubborn unless they hated him, and Sherlock knew there wasn't hate coming from John.
"Oh," Greg replied, following a few steps behind as if worried the man might turn on him, literally, as well as figuratively.
_____
"You mean, confess?" Sherlock challenged.
"You've made up your mind already?" John asked, perking up a bit.
They ended up watching telly the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. Sherlock had nearly fallen asleep. His mind was more than happy to stay there in John's arm, being petted and cared for, until the end of bloody time, but his body was aching from the sedentary day, and he knew he needed to sprawl out a bit.
Oh, this was...
"Yeah, meant so much you didn't want to even see me," John said with a sneer. Because, of course, no one would really love him. Of course he wouldn't be enough.
Jane snorted and let her body slip beneath the water, but for her head. "Where would I have gone?"
"Is it...is it always like this?" Sherlock asked, sitting back a bit to hide his face against John's chest.
"Jesus, yes, yes," John grunted, fucking up into Sherlock as the man grew boneless on top of him.
"I'm sure you handled it well," Mycroft said, taking a bite of his salad and sitting back in his seat, socked feet settling between Greg's.
"We should," John parroted.
John was very hard to secretly track. He always managed to know where Sherlock was. The only way he could keep John safe was to pretty much glue himself to the man's hip. That was how he managed to be standing in the stall next to John, pretending to use the loo, when Doc entered a few nights after it became clear he was the target.
That shot a pleasant sort of shock through him. John thought he was desirable. John wanted to date him. John might think he was brilliant forever, might sleep with his arms around Sherlock's waist, might sit too close at coffee shops and pick up the groceries and rub his feet when they were sore from chasing criminals and bloody move with him to the country when he retired and-
John, overcome with affection for the man, leaned in and shut him up with his lips. Sherlock startled and held his breath for a moment before slumping down a bit and letting John run his fingers through his curls.
"Yes, the students are so...full of life! And I don't have any questions," Molly replied.
_____
"I rebel against the word of God," Sherlock challenged.
"I think you'll be fetching with one," Sherlock found himself saying.
'I could always send you information on it, the next one. If you were interested,' Sherlock replied quickly.
After the second flush he sat forward. "Would you like suction?"
"Prostitute, no," Sherlock replied quickly, lips still curled into a smile.
He'd been killed right out that front door, on his way to a lecture in his human anatomy class. He was walking across the street and stumbled and just...didn't exist anymore. There were all these people gathered around his body, and he couldn't seem to figure out how to get by them in his new spiritual form, so he never got to see it. He wondered if that were for the best. He must have been horribly mangled.
"I could get into trouble," John said, the sentence coming out like an invitation.
"You aren't going in there," John said, smiling and shaking his head.
"Gone and hurt yourself?" Mr Hudson asked, walking over from the kitchen where he had been drying plates, and looking at her hand.
Letters might take up to a month to get to you, and with all the injuries, fatal and non-fatal alike, I might not be able to write more than once a month. I hope you won't want to stop talking to me.
John felt so off his footing by the way thoughts seemed to spool out of the man unbidden that he had to interrupt lest he be pulled under by them. "You work in the morgue?"
"John Watson," the detective said, finally entering after they'd been there for ten minutes. "How on earth does a decorated war veteran end up tangled up in this mess with Sherlock Holmes?"
He let his head fall back against the tree again and stared up at the lights, counting them to center his mind. He was at three hundred and twelve when John slowly pulled his fingers out.
Jane gave her a quick look that said 'I've no doubt', and Sherlock wrinkled her nose.
"Lets go to our table, gorgeous," John murmured, smile turning his words soft around the edges.
"Okay," John said, uncertainty bleeding into his words. "Well, I've got work in the morning, so I'm going to head to bed."
Greg closed his eyes and listened as Mycroft left the flat without showering, then got out of bed and got ready for work. He would not cry over that heartless bastard again. Not one more bloody time.
"I'm not exactly an expert," John answered, feeling horrible at admitting it. Feeling like a child.
Sherlock stood there blinking for a while. He was confused. Not just at John's reaction, although he was starting to see how his words could have rubbed him the wrong way, but also at the fact that he was upset at himself for making the man unhappy. He usually had no inclination one way or the other when it came to people's happiness and the two of them hadn't got along anyhow so it didn't make sense.
John giggled and elbowed Sherlock when the taller man batted his eyelashes. "It worked, didn't it?"
"I'm afraid we don't have any books on lust," the man replied, chin raised. "Quite a few passages, though."
"I'm a mess," Sherlock said, breath hot against John's wrinkled shirt.
"Greg Holmes. Gregory Holmes. Greg Lestrade-Holmes. Mr Holmes-Lestrade."
"You're a true blond, then," Sherlock said, fingers skating through John's pubic hair as he bent to breathe him in.
"I was supposed to be angry with you but I really can't manage it," Greg said, walking over and setting a newspaper down in front of them.
Sherlock pulled at his sensitive prick at that before pulling his hand out and looking at it somewhat suspiciously. John huffed out a laugh and rested against the wall.
Sherlock grumbled and continued in his ways.
"Trying to," John said, shrugging. "Tell me about your last case."
John might have been uncomfortable while talking about it, but with lips and a tongue pressing into it while a skilled hand gripped his cock through his denims, the discomfort turned something else. Jesus, the things this man was doing to him.
(Protector)
"Still with me, love?" John asked, standing again.
_____
"I'll make you three," John said back, leaning in to kiss his shoulder. "Dry the floor."
"Quit pouting and kiss me," Greg said, eyes closing and mouth opening in waiting.
Sherlock clambered into it and sat there, knees bracketing John's hips.
"You have questions," Sherlock said, drawing Jane's eyes back to her and holding them that time.
John chewed his lip and nodded. "Yes. That would...that would be fine."
He was not in danger here.
"I've ruined coffee for you, then?" John asked, giggling harder.
Mycroft lost all restraint, bucking wildly, his perfectly coiffed hair finally beyond repair and sweat beading on his forehead. He felt Greg take hold of his cock with one hand, the other arm resting behind his neck on the back of the chair, just before Greg's arse tightened around him.
For a second Sherlock thought he was about to be the next victim of one of John's sound left hooks, then John smiled.
The worst part was that when he did speak he was strangely insightful and sort of brilliant. It's frustrating. I think he may be mad. He was arrogant and rude and a bit too posh for my liking and looks about 12 and, yes, I'm sure now that he's mad but what's really got me up a wall is that after all that he was still strangely likeable.
"At making you act a responsible adult?" John teased.
"Better than down at the station," Greg replied. "So...you two are getting fairly close."
_____
Sherlock pointed to the coffee table and John rose with a grunt to retrieve the ruined shoe. He was about to speak when he turned around, but his voice gave out when his eyes fell on the far wall.
"Fuck me," Greg whispered into his ear.
Sherlock fumbled with his belt and zip and caught John's eye. John locked the door for good measure and then gripped Sherlock in a loose fist and gave him a slow tug.
"Yes, well, if you feel like continuing to be a prick, you can speak to our lawyers. Goodbye, Randall."
_____
"Oh, God," Sherlock sighed.
Sherlock barely gave him a second to breathe, after noting that he was telling the truth, before turning and kneeling over his lap, lips pressed soundly to his neck.
"And..." Sherlock tried.
"Freedom," he said, eyes boring into Sherlock's.
"Nothing," he replied, heading to the bed and climbing under the covers.
"She doesn't take me seriously," he said, something he'd written specifically for Sally, riding in the passenger seat car of the nondescript sedan, before the ice had melted between them.
"Do you have to be drunk for this?" Mycroft asked, the softness of his voice giving away his fear.
"Don't tell me you want me to pity the death of a horrible man," Jane said, wry smile taking to her lips.
He was starting to wonder, after the leaf had been pulled from his hair earlier that day, if the spirit had given up completely.
It wasn't a proper question, but the tone of her voice said it all. Molly smiled and took her hand.
"Coffee," Sherlock said, refusing to meet John's eyes.
"Might as well," Sherlock replied. "Nothing to do in this god forsaken town."
"You'll be comfortable here," Mycroft said. "We can make changes if you like."
SO YOU NEED ENTERTAINMENT
"The house, of course. We will have to give them all thirty day notice of move out, but that time will pass quickly, what with break only a week away," Sherlock explained. "Would you come to Southampton with the family? It'll be terribly boring without you."
John ran his hand down Sherlock's chest and the man arched into his touch, gasping and gripping John's hip, his own hips pressing forward against his will.
I was wondering if you'd like me to send you a video. One of the lads has a recorder and they've been acting out music videos and posting them on the web. I promise not to send you any Britney Spears inspired content, as I'm sure you would have a coronary, and as I'm not there to save your life.
He had to walk around a bit more before he could focus enough to read them. The first was so explicit that Sherlock wondered how the writer could manage not to be completely creeped out. Surprisingly, though, the rest of the comments were different. Most were a simple sentence about how the reader liked the story, and some went into further detail about what they liked, but all were supportive.
The kettle saved them, but that was a sad thought in itself. The staring ate up minutes of time. How embarrassing.
Sherlock stilled for a moment, and then, followed.
John nodded and wiped his mouth. "Well, yes, why?"
"Quite right," Sherlock agreed. "Why would a wife kill a husband, if not for money?"
John nodded once, a whole conversation going on without a word, and Sherlock turned back to Greg. "That's quite a coincidence. We were thinking of moving to the city."
"How the...how were you reading our letters?" he demanded, heart pounding.
The water in the bath was starting to cool. Mycroft had left an hour earlier and it had taken the whole hour for Sherlock's mind to stop screaming at him. He added some hot water to top the bath off and let his thumb press the button it was hovering over on his mobile.
"You've never wanted friends before," Mycroft said, taking Sherlock's empty glass off the crushed velvet of the sofa and wondering if he needed to ply his brother with more alcohol to get to the bottom of his troubles that evening. "What is it about this vicar that has you out of sorts?"
His hand hesitated there and Sherlock pushed against it, pressing into the touch.
Summer.
"As you like it, then," Mycroft said, rolling his hips and sucking on Greg's neck.
"Perfect," he whispered, breath puffing against Sherlock's ear, as the man bowed towards him.
Merrick climbed back out of the water and started running back and forth on the shore as quickly as he could.
"How did you know my aunt?" Jane asked, not skipping a beat.
"Shhh," John soothed. "It's okay. I've got you."
Greg was a bastard when he wanted something, but, God, was he good at it. He tightened again and Mycroft started to shake, gritting his teeth and clenching his eyes closed as Greg gave and then took away exactly what he needed.
"A support group of one," John said, surprising himself.
John stayed silent for a long time and Sherlock's stomach rolled uncomfortably. When John finally did speak he was using a very serious voice and Sherlock was sure that if he didn't pay close attention he would be in trouble.
Sherlock grunted in response.
Sherlock blushed and ducked his head, mumbling something before walking to the back of the room. John grinned at him and went about cleaning the counter absentmindedly.
"Late nights reading?" John challenged, smirking as he knew Sherlock was putting it on for the upper hand.
Sherlock surged forward and pressed their lips back together, hands gripping John's biceps tightly. John was hot. His skin was soft under Sherlock's fingers. Everything felt electric. Sherlock rubbed up and down his body, fingers tripping over nipples and settling at the edge of John's pants. John slithered out of them and kicked them off the bed, laying back with his hands beneath his head so Sherlock could explore.
_____
"Be my lookout," William said.
"You're someone who has seen fighting and death and saved people with your hands and you're alone and I thought...I just thought maybe you were like me," Sherlock said.
Jane rolled her eyes, and Sherlock grinned.
I'm frightened for you. I'm frightened, and wracked with guilt because you want Sarah, the simple woman with no real interest in anything beyond the status quo. I can't be the doctor's wife. I can't be that person. Not even for you. I wish I could.
John followed, confused, and sat beside him at the desk.
"Women 35-60," John spat, "yes, I know."
"I don't," Sherlock tried, "I don't think I'll ever be quite done with you."
"You can sleep now if you like. We both need a bit of a soak if we're to walk around without aching tomorrow. Keep those pretty eyes closed and just let me hold you, yeah?" John asked, nosing Sherlock's hair.
Close.
He set the laptop down on the table in time to see John fumble with the camera and apparently turn it off and then back on again. When John started to talk to himself again, trying to get up his courage, Sherlock slammed the laptop closed and laughed hysterically.
with someone. He hadn't shared living quarters since he was in uni. He knew that he didn't make a very good flatmate, and had a feeling the cramped quarters would bring out the worst in him. Perhaps he would just have to spend a great deal of time out of doors, which wouldn't be too bad if the rain stayed away.
"What have they told you?" he asked quietly.
Social niceties, and the possibility of staying in London. 'Yeah,' he thought, 'I've got bloody nothing to do but grieve.
The thing he'd created was a sort of map of the outcomes he was facing. There were three basic starting categories; accept, deny, and avoid. Each string started off in one of those three and fanned out to meet what he thought of as the best, second best, and worst outcomes.
Sherlock walked into Lestrade's office and around his desk, the man in question looking at him like he was mad and trying to stand up.
"Congratulations," John said distractedly in the low hum of the crowded room.
"More than fine, I'm sure," Sherlock echoed.
"I find myself wanting to smile as of late," Mycroft replied. "Each time I think of you. Seems I can't stop it anymore."
He turned the bent corner round right and walked to his desk, sitting crookedly on the chair and fishing around in one of the drawers until he found the tape.
Sherlock grinned wickedly. "Quite. Just your sort of thing, Captain."
Sherlock scrambled for something to say back, trying to think about what he'd written on the blasted index cards. He fumbled in his pocket, the sense memory bringing it back to him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, flustered and embarrassed by the hyperbole.
"I've never had a proper boyfriend," Sherlock whispered, eyes flitting back and forth between John's.
And Jesus, that didn't help. The mouthy nurse to his lonely doctor? Bloody hell. John found himself pressing the heel of his palm against his crotch and leaning back a bit to push the laptop out of his lap.
He helped her move things and replaced a burned out lightbulb and then they sat for tea.
John looked shocked at first, and looked behind himself and then back.
Sherlock grinned and rested his head on John's shoulder, letting himself be wrapped in the warm cocoon of John's arms. Sally rolled her eyes and Greg handed John a lager.
"Couldn't sleep?" he asked, walking forward and cursing himself for not at least putting on the hotel slippers.
"I think I will," John said, letting go of Sherlock's waist so the man could stand and remove his trousers.
He came upon the student that jumped from the roof and printed out the article. It was possible, of course, that there were two ghosts on the property. He felt, though, that he would have noticed. So far the supposed haunting hadn't been particularly malevolent. The first day the spirit had tossed all of his clothes on the floor and locked the attic door from the inside, but since then it seemed to have given up its havoc and gone about trying to ignore him.
John looked up at him and smiled. "Only a few. House cats were the carrier in both. You don't really see people catching it from contaminated water, because the people out hiking aren't usually immunocompromised."
-Excerpt from Secretive Ways by John Watson-
"You're drunk," Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock stayed silent and got down two mismatched mugs from above the stove. Jane stood as close as appropriate and watched the water be poured, and tea bags placed, and sugar dispensed.
"It's Lestrade," came a gravelly voice from the receiver. "You up for a pint in about an hour?"
