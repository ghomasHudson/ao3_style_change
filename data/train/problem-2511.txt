"We are checking in. If you would..."
Gaston shook his head, "They both had cars, they both would have driven back through town. Someone would have recognized them; they don't exactly blend in. No, they're still up there. And if they are still alive, they are a threat."
"When I'm worried and I can't sleep, I count my blessings instead of sheep, and I fall asleep counting my blessings," he sang in a slow, sweet way. John tried not to show his utter shock, but failed miserably. Sherlock swallowed hard, but looked down and continued, "When my bankroll is getting small, I think of when I had none at all, and I fall asleep counting my blessings. I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads, and one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds," he smiled and lifted his head, his hand coming to rest atop John's, "If you're worried and you can't sleep, just count your blessings instead of sheep, and you'll fall asleep counting your blessings."
There wasn’t much sense about him when it came to children. Even after knowing him and his family for so long, I still had trouble imagining him ever being one. He was learning though, and it was quite hysterical watching him with Rosie. She would often do silly or random things, as young children tend to, and Sherlock would get the most puzzled look on his face. I couldn’t help but laugh at their interactions. It was endearing.
"This is ridiculous. Ok, let's pretend this is all true. The question still remains, what do we do with it?" John interrupted.
John smiled. He liked to tease Sherlock, even if it rarely got any reaction. Still, it passed the time when the consulting detective was in between cases and on the rampage, or in times such as these when John was feeling mischievous. He put down the magazine and walked up to his own room to start packing.
Sherlock opened John's laptop, quickly pulling up a news story, "Changed your password again," he said nonchalantly.
"Yes, in exchange for a rose. Lestrade filled me in on the tale, as did the people in the town. A load of rubbish if you ask me. All fairytales and..."
Sherlock relaxed and ran his hands over John's shoulders and up to the sides of his neck. He leaned in, a kiss hanging between them. But it would never come to fruition.
"I'll be right back. I'll at least need something to clean this with," he chose his words cautiously, not mentioning that they really should leave and get to the town. John wanted to be careful until he could ascertain more about the state of the consulting detective's mind. The mention of leaving is what set off the night's events and he did not have the energy to deal with another episode. However, the wounds may need stitches and who knows what kind of supplies were stocked in the house. He just hoped Sherlock had not sabotaged his own car as well in the event that they would require the resources of a hospital. He grabbed a nearby throw blanket and carefully wrapped it around Sherlock's shoulders. The man was shivering and the fire only afforded so much heat at this point. Winter's chill was a bastard when it got into your bones. He put a comforting hand to the thin shoulder before heading out of the chamber.
Sherlock noticed something then out of his peripheral, a vision he thought would not come to pass this holiday season. Out of one of the backstage windows, a flurry of soft, white snow was falling. The wind blew it in swirls around the thin, bare trees. They seemed to celebrate its arrival, despite the cold it brought upon them.
"Won't take that long," he called back from his room pragmatically.
"Yes, not much chance of that happening now."
"Ah-ha, so you took a case to avoid the festivities, and you saw fit to drag me out to the country a bloody week before Christmas hoping that you 'wouldn't solve the case in time' to be back."
Sherlock did not come home until well into the evening. Rosie had been tucked snugly in her crib, with a few extra hugs and kisses. I was making tea in the newly decorated kitchen, courtesy of the two people that I loved most in the world. It had all been done for me and the guilt over how I had reacted, how I had jumped to conclusions without so much as looking past my nose, kept me silent as I turned to face him. He was in the sitting room, acting as if he were busy, but I knew better. I took a few shameful steps toward him. It was my turn to stare at my shoes.
Sherlock stood up with enough vehemence to send his chair flying back into the wall, "And what if I did!!?" He shouted, coming to stand face to face with John, "Who would care? You?" He pushed him, stalking forward to trap him against the wall, "Why don't you just leave now? You seem so keen on it. It's all you've said from the beginning."
"I don't know," came the quiet and uncertain reply. Sherlock's face was solemn and he looked down at the sheets they rested on.
The jest fell as flat as the air in the room.
John awoke to large, green-blue eyes staring at him.
"I think I could sleep just about anywhere at this point," he laughed, "And I need to keep an eye on you."
"Don't touch him," he snarled, walking to the edge of the first step and holding the man over it, "Is this what you wanted to see?" He bellowed to the crowd, his eyes fierce and wild.
"It's his journal," Sherlock said. He untied the leather strings with haste and opened the book. A rose lay quietly between the pages, as scarlet and as brilliant as ever. The blooms unfurled themselves slowly as the paper gave way, as if stretching from a long nap, "And here is the rose."
John began to catch on. The two instantly moved, taking either side of the room. They searched for secret compartments and clandestine places. They looked, knocked, prodded, and poked at wooden drawers, walls, and flooring. Finally, a stone behind a picture of the manor moved. Inside the small space they found a little vermillion journal. It had been sitting for ages, and the neglect showed on its cover. The edges were wasted and a thick coat of dust enveloped it. This was obviously the first time fresh air had graced it since the young master had hidden it.
John just chuckled and laid back on the couch, covering his face with his hands. Sherlock was so...Sherlock about things. He stretched his arms above his head, running his knuckles along the wallpaper.
He shook his head to clear the thoughts. He did not have enough information to begin the process of conclusion. As Sherlock constantly reminded him, he was seeing, but not observing. So onward and upward to observe. There must be something that had acutely affected Sherlock in that room. But what could it have been and why was it that Sherlock had spent a week holed up here and not solved the case? John picked up his tea and took a long drink. The more time he spent here, the more confused he was becoming. The thought that getting away from the mysterious manor might be the best thing reoccurred. But he was curious as to what Sherlock had found and the consulting detective seemed settled on staying for the moment. He would have to keep his wits about him. No conclusions. Not enough information. Mind at the ready, Watson. He stood up with his mug.
"I don't know," Sally said, unconvinced.
John decided to drop it. It didn't matter now as he could clearly see that no harm had come to his insufferable flatmate, and besides he was tired, "Right. I'm going to get my bag from the car and I'll be back in. You can show me where the designated rooms are and fill me in on what you've found."
"Sorry, you're going to have to debunk on your own. Give my best to the ghosts of yesteryear," John sat on the couch and opened a magazine. Sherlock just gave him a confused stare. It was the one he always gave when John was not wanting to do what he wanted him to do. It said to him, 'John, why? You're my blogger. Why would you not be there?' He knew the look well and often he caved in to the puppy dog eyes, but this time he stood his ground, "I told you, I'm going to visit Harry. It's her birthday and she's having a go at being back on the horse."
John looked about intently, trying ever so hard to keep his mind off of the red flag that was waving around in the back of his mind. This house was beautiful, indeed, but there was definitely something wrong with what was going on within. The way in which Sherlock reacted to him was not at all in keeping with his normal behaviour, if one could call how he behaved normal. The air seemed stale here and the furnishings devoid of any liveliness they may have once embodied. Even if the rooms were blessed with a full barrage of sunlight, he hypothesized that they would still remain as they are; dormant, afraid, lifeless. He wondered if there perhaps was a natural phenomena of some sort coming from the surrounding area that would affect anyone who dared live here long term. Though that would not explain the people who had successfully owned and lived here with no homicide to speak of. Perhaps there was a history of mental illness in the families of the area, but that would have lead to more deaths and in a broader area. Lost in thought, John barely noticed when the kettle sounded, signaling its readiness.
I will sit and wait with you
Sherlock gave him a slightly annoyed look, but did not stop the doctor, "It would be best if we went on to the Police Station rather than stand here focusing on my attire. We have a case to solve, John."
As Tom continued on into the restaurant, Sherlock and John remained silent, glancing at each other like two teenagers who had been caught by their teacher behind the library. They giggled.
"We are going to give Mrs. Hudson a little Christmas gift," he replied, "We are going to use your celebrity to help bring people to the lodge."
"Unfortunately no," he replied, voice barely audible.
Sherlock scoffed.
"Why?" It was said in a most serious way.
I had left for the surgery around eight that morning. I didn’t work there regularly anymore, just sort-of filled in. The day had been uneventful. There were a few cases of flu, a twisted ankle, one second degree burn, and two colds. Nothing extraordinary for a mid-September day. The lack of excitement, coupled with the current domestic situation, made me anxious to get home. Normally, Mrs. Hudson was there for back up at the very least. Most often she was the primary caretaker, of both of my children. Today she was visiting a friend, so Sherlock was on his own.
John grabbed his shoulders with both hands, "Sherlock, tell me you booked a room. Somewhere, anywhere, just tell me you booked one," it was John's turn to be annoyed.
The two merrymakers turned and walked arm in arm to center stage. Lestrade, Donovan, and Anderson entered and joined them. Sherlock took a step forward, as Phil handed him his violin. He brought the instrument to his chin once more and began to play. The beautiful melody of White Christmas leapt off of the strings. It was not alone for long before the cast began to accompany it with its sentimental lyrics. And it was not long after that the audience was obliged to join in.
"What?"
"Sure," Phil replied, his attention now focused.
"Another murder," the whole of the room stopped, a few gasps heard around the crowd, "It's happened before, perhaps not in our time, but we all know that place is cursed."
"John has..." Sherlock began, but was stopped by a corrective stare from John, "I have employed certain relations of mine to aid in the dispensing of information to the public. No doubt my face is plastered all over the tele at this very moment," the disdain was only slightly apparent.
He sat up, pulling off his jumper and shirt and discarding them on the floor beside the bed, "Sit up," he commanded gently. Sherlock's stunned look was comical as he had obviously not expected the brash movement. His eyes feasted over John's chest and arms, fit as they were. Sherlock moved to rest on one elbow. John reached for him with a trembling hand. The contact was soft, affectionate, if not comforting. His thin chest rose and fell with hastened breath and heartbeats that came pounding more heavily than the iron knocker adorning the entrance to the castle. He came to sit in front of the blond man, who slowly wrapped one leg over the both of his. John straddled him wearing nothing but his blue jeans, settling diffidently down on his lap. He paused, not knowing if the next move should be his. He wanted to say something, but he did not know what that something should be. The intention was clear however, and Sherlock pushed himself up to bring them closer. It was yet another approval and John found himself wanting it. He realized that he wanted this to be ok. Leaning forward, his arms coming to rest beside the ribs of his conquest, John came desperately close to another kiss. But Sherlock would not relent. Leaning back, he teased him, turning his head so that his long curls brushed John's face and he could smell the cologne misted across his neck.
"Mrs. Hudson?" John asked, the surprise apparent in his tone.
His dinner arrived then. The barkeep placed the warm plate on the counter where John sat, "Thank you," he said and then turned back to the quick-tempered man in the red shirt, "Well, now you know my business, so you can feel better about walking back to that chair and leaving me to it."
"And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings."
John's chest tightened. Sherlock was here. For one reason or another, he had not solved the case, but he had also failed to contact John for backup. It was strange of him to not answer his phone, but perhaps the service in the area was not good. He checked his phone. Three bars, not bad. It was already six o'clock though and he did not relish driving in the dark, but he'd rather have the peace of mind knowing everything was ok. And the townsfolk were proving to be less than friendly. He had only been there a matter of minutes and he felt he had already out-stayed his welcome.
"You're here," the doctor said, rubbing the sleep from his own eyes.
"I won't do it. I will not let it happen," he cried softly.
"I'm not hungry, and don't change the subject! Now, I have a lot of details to work out. If you have something to say to me, than say it!" He wanted an explanation as to why he would back out and not have the courtesy to say anything to him. He wanted to know why he would let Mrs. Hudson down, and he wanted to hear it from Sherlock's own lips.
“John, I know I am not your first choice for a sitter,” he took a few steps forward, now meeting me in the kitchen doorway, “but I would never do anything that would put Rosie in danger.”
The rope loosened, and his right thumb slipped through into the nest of rough spirals.
~~~~~
Sherlock raised his hand once more and caressed the side of John's face more vulnerably than he had ever witnessed from the man before. The pads of his fingers, and his palm, intimated at his longing. They pulled him down with barely a brush of skin and he found himself in a passionate kiss. Tears of relief streamed from both pairs of closed eyes, but it was of no matter.
"John, get up," he walked into the flat, disposing of his coat on an obliging chair in one swift move, "It's Christmas."
"He refused an old woman over her appearance and the offering of a rose. He was a selfish arse. That much was recorded by the servants," he explained.
"I couldn't sleep. I don't know why, but I remembered Tom had said something about leftover sandwiches behind the counter. Do you want one?" John asked.
Sherlock's eyes were turquoise when they rose to meet him, as an ocean when the sun shows through on a cloudy day, "I want to kill you," he choked out, once again grabbing the cloth of John's shirt. His hands intimated at roving further, but they were stayed and Sherlock remained in the fight.
"Sherlock?" It was a spoken question, but his voice screamed urgency.
"John, I...as I have said before, I am no hero. Dark or otherwise, it's dangerous putting knights up on horses, as you so metaphorically put it. They're likely to slip off, especially in my case."
*****Rising in the East
"Not everyone," Sally gave Anderson a disapproving look, crossing her arms across her chest.
"Now, now," another older man piped up from the bar, "I am sure they are alive and well. Besides, how could they be a threat to us? Aren't we getting a little carried away with this guesswork?"
"Is it really that bad?" John asked, turning back to Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock could not abide this and he spoke out of sheer anxiety before his thoughts could complete themselves, "I shouldn't have..." His eyes searched, "John...please, I ..." but he held back the rest.
"Don't..." he struggled to push him away, "I think we should..."
"A young man, on his wedding night, refused a beggar woman at his door. She had asked for lodging in..."
The tone was so bitter, it made John cringe.
John stopped walking, "You can't die from a lack of love. Heart break, perhaps, over time. Given the other accounts, this was something that came on suddenly. Lawrence Hawkes was certainly not heartbroken. He was just a bit of an arse."
~~~~~
Before another second passed, he looked to John. It was the first real look since this episode had begun. It was clear, clever, and salacious. His eyes lowered then, back to the hips he held in his grasp. His hands moved up and behind his back then. John arched beautifully and Sherlock's head dipped down, allowing his lips to trace hot circles on the skin of his stomach. John's erection ached, hard and weeping between them. Sherlock pulled back, once again laying John down against the sheets. He knelt on the bed before him and slowly worked himself free of the confines of the last of his clothing.
"Don't do that," Sherlock gently chided.
"Get out."
John breathed in deeply, preparing to speak though no words entered his mind. Then a hard knock came booming through the house. John and Sherlock's heads sprang to attention. They looked to the door, then to each other in unison. Odd, they were not expecting anyone.
"No, I'm not hungry," but he set his violin down and came over to help John find the sandwiches, "I saw him putting them away..." walking behind the dark, glossed-wood bar, he crouched down and opened a paneled door. After a moment, he brought a plate of various sandwiches out of one of the refrigerators under the counter. Some were turkey, some were ham, a few were even liverwurst, and all were crowned with a single green olive. John suddenly realized that he was more hungry than he thought. Maybe the food really would help him sleep.
Back home. What happened with the country estate case?
John stilled. The room was spinning. It had not stopped when the music had, for reasons not yet realized. The blur went by around him as if it barely existed in this world. For a split second, he thought that maybe it did not. Maybe this was something else all together, a dazzling place he had never known. He felt uncertain and ensnared. Those eyes, those eyes would not allow him to leave here. They begged, they worried, they wanted. John did not remember seeing it before, but he knew now that the whole of it had been there all along. The time for ignorance was through.The question now was would his mind allow such possibilities. His breath halted in his chest. His lungs decided that air was not the order of the moment and were being decidedly uncooperative. John's body betrayed him and when Sherlock went to pull closer once more, he flinched and pulled back. He had not meant it to be abrupt, but he could see from Sherlock's reaction, that had been the case. John looked away, not knowing why he was attempting to hide his unease.
until next time bitches.
John hummed and ran his hands up Sherlock's arm and into his hair. He heard Sherlock chuckle softly and that just warmed his heart. After a while John felt a tugging at his shirt. He bit Sherlock's lip softly and then pulled away so that Sherlock could take off his shirt. Before the army he never wore shirts to bed, but he did all the time now, he was self-conscious of his scar and Sherlock never complained that he was wearing a shirt anyway.
Sherlock was grateful for the dark. In the dark, John couldn’t see the scars Sherlock had gotten. He wasn’t ready to talk about it; he didn’t know if he ever would be. And he was so incredibly grateful that John didn’t bring it up again in the cab. Right now it was just the two of them. The two of them against the rest of the world and Sherlock knew that, no matter what happened from here on out, he would be happy. That they would be just fine.
THAT'S SO FUCKING STUPID ITS HILARIOUS!
Sherlock glared at him slightly, “well, clearly you don’t! If I tell you something didn’t happen and there’s nothing to talk about, and you keep insisting there is, then it’s clear you don’t!” He huffed slightly.
November 7, 2019.
In other news, I still fucking love Thursdays.
Sherlock smacked his forehead. “Mycroft! This is getting us nowhere!! Just give him the stupid drug test!” He hissed.
It was John’s turn to shrug, “he’s an arsehole. I don’t think we’re going to work out after all.” He frowned, “wait… hang on. I didn’t tell you he was alive…”
“Not yours, Sherlock... John’s.” Mycroft said softly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but smiled softly as he watched John roll his body through the door and then shut it. He realised that even though they had a tough twenty-four hours… everything was going to be okay. For now, at least.
Q: Why was the cat afraid of the tree?
Moriarty’s jaw clenched and he slowly ran a hand up Sherlock’s chest, “Boredom, I suppose. You have to make a choice, Sherlock.” He smirked and ran his hand up to cup Sherlock’s cheek, stroking a thumb over his cheekbone, “Because I’m certainly not going to stop it.”
“No. He’s not dead. I just shot him in the leg, though, to be honest I’m surprised he passed out…” His chest was heaving in and out. He was practically shaking on the inside with fear, but he wouldn’t let Sherlock know that… caring was a disadvantage for him. He would blame the cake on his shortness of breath before anything else. He didn’t even eat that much cake, it was one time Sherlock. One time!
“Oh! So now you want to talk!” He sniffled and cursed himself for letting Sherlock hear what he had done to him. Perhaps the army would make him tougher, perhaps not, but one could only hope. “I don’t want to talk to you anyway, so just go away.”
He looked up at the man with big, scared eyes. He had never been so terrified in his life and he was shaking. He hated not having control over his body, but he had no choice and now big strong hands were coming down on his shoulders and then pulling him into a hug.
'Cause your life as you know it is (H)cient History
“For God’s – I DID WRITE TO YOU SHERLOCK!!” He screamed and tugged at his hair because he couldn’t deal with this right now, how the fuck could Sherlock sit there and think he was lying? Why would John all of a sudden come back to him if he had stopped writing all those years ago?
John looked down to his lap and took a breath, he felt the same about Sherlock so he understood, still… it spoke a lot about how they saw themselves. Some might call it selfless, but to John he wasn’t sure if that were the case, or if he just hated himself to some extent. Perhaps, a bit of both. “You killed people.” He finally said before raising his eyes to look at Sherlock.
John barked out a laugh and kicked him in the stomach, “No one is asking me to do this!!” He lied. “I’ve wanted to kill your brother for some time now! I’m just finally now acting upon it!” He hissed.
“Jesus! Sherlock!” He groans and scrubs his face, “Can we not talk about that?”
could go to jail!! Let’s just go home, yeah?” Because John was not about to go to jail and have his clean record tainted, all because his mad boyfriend wanted to break into a crime scene.
John swallowed and looked down, “Yeah... I know it sounds stupid, but I can’t give up on you that easily...” He wanted to be confident, to look Sherlock square in the eyes and not back down. But he couldn’t, and even if he could, he was too exhausted right now.
Eat Mop who?
John smiled a little, “I’m fine. All he did was drug me, I think. I can’t remember him doing anything bad besides drugging me.” He said softly. “I’m going to go take a shower now.”
Sherlock blinked slightly and frowned. "I told you it wasn't time yet..." He mumbled like she was an idiot, that only made Claire angrier.
“Fascinating use of words,” Sherlock said dryly. “I assume you are drawing all over your homework because maybe, perhaps, you don’t get it?”
John swallowed hard and then just broke down crying. He couldn't possibly tell you how long he cried for, but eventually the sun started to come up and John had to go back. He walked into the flat and Sherlock was there.
“Oh.. Well. What a lovely surprise!” The Doctor hummed.
A slow smile spread across Moriarty’s face, but his eyes were dead. “See, but you’re missing something. I wasn’t planning on walking away from this alive. I was going to follow you, love.”
John stood there for a minute staring at the floor before he nodded and slowly made his way over to Sherlock. He climbed into the bed and nuzzled himself into Sherlock's arms. The warmth of Sherlock wrapping around his naked back soothed him and he closed his eyes. “It’s my fault…” he whispered.
John pushed passed Mycroft and walked into the house, going into the kitchen. He saw the maps scattered everywhere, so he really was working... at least there was that. At least he wasn’t delusional about everything like Sherlock was.
The letter made John smile and that made him smile more because even though they were thousands of miles apart Sherlock still had the ability to make him smile, not only smile either, he still had the ability to make him feel better when he was down.
“Oh… No... I couldn’t intrude on you like that… I’m sorry, but I can’t… I’ll find somewhere else.” John said as he fiddled awkwardly with his fork. It was one thing for Sherlock to ask him that, but to have a grown man ask him that after only thirty minutes of meeting him, it was a bit unnerving.
John froze and then practically fell off the seat when his father turned the corner abruptly. He had thought of dying before... how it was going to happen. He thought of a million scenarios, but something he hoped and prayed didn’t happen to him was drowning. Drowning was one of his biggest fears and he would rather get shot multiple times over before he was about to drown, but now he didn’t have a choice! He couldn’t even try to escape because he was tied up! He started to hyperventilate and he closed his eyes slowly. He tried to find peace deep down, something to calm him. He thought of Sherlock, his Sherlock! The fictional one that he was in love with. His Sherlock told him soothing words of how it will all be okay and how he would be with John every step of the way.
John took a deep breath, “Look, Sherlock, I know you may want to, but you can’t… so, I will see you in chemistry on Monday, alright?” He started to walk away, quickly, just as Sherlock ran to catch up to him.
John froze and swallowed hard as he stepped into the house with Sherlock, he was a bit miffed Sherlock tried to push him into the bushes, but he understood. The blood completely drained from his face when he saw Sigar, Mycroft, and a bunch of random men pointing guns at them. He didn’t know what to say and he was at a loss of words. Why were there men with guns in the house when Sigar could have easily done the job himself? Why was Mycroft standing on his side? Had he really betrayed Sherlock like that?
DEUCES!
Poor Sherlawk!! )): Dont worry! things get better... and then they get worse.. but just remember that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel! heh!
and how I made him sick! How he’s a fucking saint because he was able to put up with me for eight fucking months! Well he didn’t say that, BUT IT WAS IMPLIED!” He screamed and curled up into a ball. “I thought he loved me...”
She just hummed in acknowledgement and they sat in silence for another minute or so. Eventually, she decided to ask the next question, “how’s Sherlock?”
Claire talked about her childhood and how she hated boys with a passion. She had gotten her heart broken one too many times and now she was giving up on men to live her life in solitude and raise foxes. However, John told her not to because men are just immature bastards that didn’t know anything, but every once in a while a gem would come along and you would have to hold onto him so tightly, but at the same time he wouldn’t ever want to let you go either. She decided to call those men a ‘John.’
alright! Until next time bitches!
DEUCES BITCHES
Question:
“I would love to meet your father!” He smiled softly. “I want to know everything about you, and besides… He can’t be worse than my father.” John said quietly as he swallowed down the emotion that threatened to make its way up his throat.
“Cliché..?” He blinked some more and looked around slightly, making sure no cars were coming. Why in the world John would pull them into the street was beyond him.
"Cases are my life, John! You don't have to come if you don't want to, but don't try to force me into something that I don't want to do!" He growled and then stormed out of the flat.
The car peeled into the car park of the motel, John parked the car and walked into the dodgy looking building. He walked past the front desk and went down the hall, deciding to use the stairs instead because he would be able to avoid the cameras better. Once he got to the first floor, he wandered the hallways until he found room 134. He swallowed hard, closed his eyes, and took a breath as he tried the handle and surprisingly it was unlocked. Perhaps this was all a trap, but either way he would kill the man before he died, even if it was the last thing he did.
John groaned some, “This is embarrassing.”
Sherlock let out a sad breathy laugh and stepped forward a bit more, “I’m so incredibly angry with you.” He growled slightly, but this time there was no bite, it was more of a fond growl.
Blake frowned a bit, but didn’t say anything. He watched as John slowly guided his hand towards him and then John gently set the palm of his hand down on his groin. John groaned softly and let his head fall back against the back of the couch. He let go of Blake’s wrist and then rested both hands behind his head.
“Sher–“ John’s voice gave out and he just stared up at the roof.
Mycroft frowned and shook his head, “Of course not... you deserve privacy, John...”
Now, it was John's turn to clench his jaw, “There what is?” He growled.
“I know. I just wanted to give you a hard time before I said ‘yes’ to your little idea!” He smiled brightly.
DEUCES BITCHES
Just you wait for Phys. (Z)!!!!!!
John hissed and stood up, he needed space between him and her and he was so bloody angry that she came and ruined his moment with Sherlock. “Why? So I don’t fucking kill myself? Relax. If I’m going to kill myself I’m going to make sure you won’t find me until it’s too late. Unlike last time.” He snapped. And no he wasn’t planning on killing himself – even though some days he really wanted to. He just wanted her to back off. He wanted space and quietness... he wanted to become an empty shell that didn’t feel anything.
Answer:
“Calm down?” he repeated with a blink, before rage filled his body, “CALM DOWN? GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME BEFORE I STRANGLE YOU!” He screamed and glared at him, he wasn’t the scared little boy he once was. Memories of Coach Lestrade danced through his mind, it didn’t haunt him anymore. That was long ago and nothing happened, but then he was frozen in place mentally… right now he was frozen in place physically, but that didn’t mean he was just going to lay there and do nothing.
“Oh... actually yes.” He surprised himself again at the fact that he actually admitted to it. He should just get used to the fact that John was going to keep surprising him, it certainly didn’t make life boring. “Caring isn’t an advantage.”
do that? Not knowing why hurt her too... Maybe if she knew the answer she could forgive, but for right now she was just so angry with the man. She growled as she yanked out her mobile and dialled Sherlock's new number.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone?” Sherlock said without looking up.
John’s father growled a bit and drove faster. “Shut up! It doesn’t matter where we are going!”
I write the fics, I write the fics
Sherlock pursed his lips and then shook his head. “I wanted to… I did, but then I thought back to Vanessa… And my father… Mycroft, everyone at school. Do you know… ever since I was in Primary school I’ve been told the same thing. It’s always the same concept, same phrase… After a while it just-…” He took a breath and closed his eyes. “It just sticks... and you start to believe what they say.” He was glad for the darkness that enveloped them… He wasn’t good at talking about his feelings in general, but in the dark it was easier to talk. It felt like the words floated out of his mouth and went into a void, never to be brought up again. In the dark he could be brave. “They say ‘sticks and stones will break your bones, but names will never hurt you’ well, I think that whoever came up with that is a fucking twat. Because they do… they do hurt. You start to take everything they say to heart and you think ‘maybe the world really would be a better place without the freak in the back of the class that can read minds’… so you start planning. Planning to make them happy, to finally give them what they want. You sit in your room contemplating on the idea while you’re sitting on your bed with a bottle of pills, or a gun, or maybe a rope… and you just… cry. For me it was the gun… that’s why Mycroft couldn’t find it…” A tear escaped his eye and fell from Sherlock's face, but he didn’t care. “Every day I would lock myself in my room for hours thinking, writing, planning. I sat there with the gun pressed to my head and I thought ‘come on Sherlock.. Just pull the trigger. No one will even notice you’re missing because no one wants you… your mum’s never around and neither is your father, Mycroft has been telling you since you were a young age that caring isn’t an advantage so obviously he didn’t care, and then the people at school who take time out of their day to make your life a living hell… well, they obviously want you gone. They have said it enough times to make it very clear’… but then I think…  ‘Don’t do it Sherlock… you’re stronger than this and what is this going to prove? That you’re weak? That you’re letting them win?’ So I put the gun down because even if they make my life miserable every single god damn day of their lives… I
He moved in and lightly brushed his lips against Sherlock's. It only lasted a moment when he heard Sherlock's whispered reply.
Sherlock's eyes flashed. He grabbed two fistfuls of John's shirt and threw him to the floor in front of the desk. The force exerted was immense and John rolled on to his back, pausing for a moment out of shock. His head hurt from the knock against the marble floor and his vision blurred for an instant. Looking up, he saw his friend angry and out of control. His appearance was tantamount to that of a agonizing cocaine fit, and John found his own rage dissipating into worry. However he did not have long to ponder it as Sherlock came after him again, grabbing his shirt and pulling him up. The threads and buttons began to tear as he was dragged across the room, his head hitting the bedpost as he was thrown against it. He struggled with the hands that trapped him there. He did not want to hurt Sherlock, but if he could not get the overwrought detective to stop, he felt he may have to use more insistent ways of deterring him.

The rest disappeared inside a kiss so fervent, the mistletoe blushed.
John rubbed his face in exasperation, "Focus, Sherlock. Why you? The others, if the account is right, would have had no love in their hearts, but you are not that way. I don't care how many times you profess to be a high-functioning sociopath...why would you be affected?"
Sherlock drew back at this and replied as objectively as possible, "I admit, I got a little carried away, but there's nothing to be ashamed of, John. It was only a simple kiss. No one has signed a contract. There's certainly nothing for you to feel guilty about," Sherlock stated, matter-of-factly.
Sherlock sat back and sulked, "The case isn't solved."
The road that lead to the castle was dark and the ancient, looming trees made the way seem that much more ominous. He drove through the woods, attempting to see where the obscure driveway began, for it was set off of the side of the rural road and his GPS had indeed failed due to lack of signal. After quite some time, and a turn around or two, he finally managed to find the entrance. It was probably once a grand entrance to the property, but brush and trees had taken it over and now it barely fit the little rental car. The wrought iron gates climbed up toward the dark winter sky and John craned his neck to look up to the top as he stood before them. Heavy they were, but opened relatively easily with a loud screech to accompany them as he pulled.
"So, we are doing this?" John's voice was barely above a whisper.
***Certain as the sun
"What about roses?" He questioned as they walked up the grand staircase.
They were ready and out the door in no time. Sherlock stood on the curb and raised his hand. A cab, as usual, stopped immediately and picked them up. The trip to the train station was uneventful. They spoke a little about the case, but Sherlock had not been able to get much more pertinent information from Lestrade nor the Weymouth police than what had already been reported. They hopped on the 4:55 at London Waterloo. Running down the platform, they almost missed the train. Out of breath and full of adrenaline, they made their way to the club car. They had three hours until they would arrive in Weymouth and John decided that if he was to be traveling during the holidays to chase a murderer, he would at least make the best of it.
They parted.
Then, a wolf cry. He stopped, which was not what one should do in an instance of known danger, but nonetheless it stopped the man dead in his tracks. He listened again, but could not tell from which direction it had come. He instinctively reached around to where he normally carried his gun, but found it empty. Sherlock must have removed it when he had tied him up. He hadn't noticed until now. Christ, why hadn't he noticed? Panic rising, John took off once again. He had no plan; he knew it was a long way into town and that it would take long into the morning to reach it. But there was no choice. He had to reach it, wolves and cold be damned.
Sherlock now looked deep into his eyes, "This may seem crazy, but it's crazy and it's true. I know you can save me, John. You're the only one who can. You're the only one who...," he stumbled, "You have already done it once. I have every confidence that you can do it again," but there was hesitation behind the look of hope on his face.
"Take it," John commanded.
John's faced was contorted with worry. As the front was not an option and the veranda not far off, he acquiesced to Sherlock's request. They stumbled through the empty ballroom. It seemed strange to be in there now. There was no music. The dance had faded back into the muraled walls. It was dim and solitary, as if the rest of the house had finally caught up to it. Nevertheless, they plodded through as if their lives depended on it, and one of theirs may have. The French doors opened with a whoosh and a barrage of fresh winter air; and for a moment, John thought it had revived the man at his side.
"You know you're going to solve this as soon as we arrive, so why even bother?" John asked.
"Merry Christmas, John."
~~~~~
"Whatever it takes," he replied with assurance.
I sighed and began again in earnest, “Thank you for taking care of her, for teaching her to paint. I honestly didn't think you had it in you.”
John tensed with frustration, shutting his eyes tight. A tear threatened to go AWOL, anxiously waiting at the corner of his eye. It was more intense than any battle he had fought in. Afghanistan paled in comparison to the war now being fought within him. He was held hostage by the intangible. It was lovely and insurmountably frightening, "Sherlock, please..."
“Fo-you Dada,” she pointed to her masterpieces.

Except for one thing. For it must be mentioned that fantastical events can lead to moments of unparalleled bliss for those that have the good fortune to discover them. And in this spirit, if one peered into the windows of 221B on any impossible and fantastical evening, one might just glance a couple mid-waltz. Music playing in their warm sitting room, a man and a beast dance and are taken away, back to an empty ballroom in a castle far, far away.
"It's the only logical conclusion to break the curse and our only choice now. Your death is unacceptable. And if you live, perhaps then all this would stop," he hypothesized, "If I give my life to spare yours... I would give my life for yours, John," his voice broke as he sank back down onto the hard stone. All strength was gone now, even the rage had subsided. His breathing was labored and John found that his pulse was slowing. John knelt over him, hands on his shoulders. Sherlock's eyes fluttered and went in and out of focus, as a camera running out of battery. The last petal was falling.
~~~~~
Sherlock's eyes remained shut, tightly shut. The look let John know that it had not worked. His heart sank a bit. He was unsure as to what he should do next and how far to go. This all suddenly felt like a bad work of fiction, a scandalous penny dreadful in which the whole story was one plot device to move the characters relationship to the erotic. Sex to save them. Yet here they were, running out of time with only a fanciful theory to work off of. Sherlock was fading. The changes were becoming more apparent, the rage more uncontrollable. Whatever this was, fairytale, penny dreadful, or plain strange reality, it was happening. And John could not allow it.
John sat back and put his hands on his hips, "If you hadn't tied me up and acted like a maniac, I wouldn't have run."
"What's unkind?" Anderson exclaimed, "John will go off at Sherlock and Sherlock will tell him he's an idiot for believing us. We just sit back and watch the action unfold. It'll all be a big joke in the end!"
"Ok, I thought you were going to skip the small talk," John shot back.
"Maybe he didn't have one."
"I know, it may not last, but I want to support her and I haven't been to see her in over a year. You'll just have to figure out how to get along without me," he grinned and pretended to go back to reading the magazine, which he really had no interest in.
he thought,
Sherlock smiled.
John turned him from his side onto his back, but his spine did not seem to want to straighten completely. His knees were slightly bent and his eyes shut tight. He seemed to be fighting something. John held his face.

"Good evening, welcome to the Colombia Lodge, what kind of accommodations can I offer you?" His baby blue eyes were warm and smiled along with the rest of his face.
With that, each man stalked off in their own direction. Sherlock toward his bungalow, and John back toward the lodge. Each door slammed in turn, it's finality echoing through the quiet winter countryside.
The music suddenly stopped and John opened his eyes to see Sherlock had looked up from his instrument.
John spun around and said with a gleam in his eye, "Well, break your leg, or your ankle, or your neck, just don't break anything valuable," with that he dashed out the side door in search of the Main Event.
"John, what are you doing up?"
The door to 221B crashed open, startling John from his rest, if that is how one would describe it. Chest heaving, eyes wide he stared at his flatmate trying to fully awake from the vivid dream. Sherlock's brow furrowed as he returned the stare.
Irritability, he thought, Seclusion. Hadn't those been his words when describing the symptoms of the victims before their deaths? Part of the "curse" presumably. There must be some kind of natural phenomenon in this area that causes this reaction in people. But what? How? Why some and not others? The thoughts came in a wash over him, but the desire to escape, to get help, was paramount. When his thumb finally slipped through the rope, his adrenaline soared. He maneuvered through the rest quickly and not without gaining a few burns and scratches along the way.
"I think you're there to stay," he smiled and squeezed Sherlock's forearm.
Suddenly Sherlock gasped and took a step back, startling John.
Sherlock, his eyes averted, stepped over to one of the blood-red roses crowned with snow. He was pensive and disquieted. His next words were brought forth low and full of loathing, "What is it..." he caressed the delicate petals, causing the snowflakes to melt and fall away. His touch was soft at first, "...that I am meant to do?" He gazed at the snickering flower. It hid secrets behind those velvety petals, which would not be given up easily. He regarded it accusingly, "Have I truly learned to love? Has the beast found love within his heart, if I may be so metaphorical? What is it that I am meant to prove to you?" His voice became a growl, his touch firming. The petals were crushed between gripping fingers, "And what happens when all of the petals fall!" With that he twisted the bloom from it's stem, his face mirroring the action. The disgust, the anger, the rage was coming back. He squeezed his hand shut, destroying the rose to keep himself from destroying anything else. His eyes tightly shut, he took a deep breath. The  fury began to subside. As he opened his hand, the petals blew away with a light gust of winter's wind. Only red streaks of blood remained striping his palm and fingers, a single thorn still lodged in the flesh. The rose had taken it's revenge for his disrespect and wrath.
"Be my guest," Sherlock said, ushering John in and then following. He made for the heavy red velvet curtains and pulled them back with a dramatic swoosh. One after the other, he opened the curtains, bathing the expanse of the room in a warm flaxen afternoon sun. John squinted his eyes for a moment, allowing them to get accustomed to the brightness. He looked around and then up, smiling brilliantly. It was the castle's library, and it was an amazing library, at that. The shelves climbed the walls and invited you to climb with them. Up to the tip top one might go by means of tall shining wood and brass ladders. A person could travel from one shelf to the next and never want for fine literature. John was not a reader by nature, but he appreciated the knowledge in books and he could certainly appreciate the craftsmanship of this glorious haven.
They proceeded to the veranda and looked out over the back gardens. The hedges and trees were barren with the onset of winter. In striking contrast, the rose bushes that seemed to surround the manor at every turn were strangely full and blossoming. Red roses grew tall, petals curved and thorns sharp. Some of them even grew possessively up the stone walls of the castle.
"Fuck," he tried not to scream it, but it came out louder than he wanted. He looked behind him into the house. No one appeared, but the outburst might have been heard. Soon a rustling coming from inside, and not far off, confirmed it. John, having no other choice in the moment, began to run. He took off for the woods heading toward town, hoping Sherlock would not follow, or would not be able to find him should he decide to take his car along the roadway. The rain had let up a bit, but the temperature was dropping. He only wore his shirt and jumper, which did not offer much protection against the wind and cold. It was of no consequence for the moment. He ran though the trees with speed, dodging the fallen branches and twigs that threatened to bring him down. Their sharp points grabbed at his clothing as he tore through the barren forest.
Sherlock did as he was told, reveling in the marvelous submission. He took John into his mouth and made a noise that caused John to pitch forward and grasp the headboard. His knuckles went white as Sherlock licked and sucked him. His hips could not be controlled. They bucked into the warm, wet mouth. It felt amazing. He thrust faster, thoroughly fucking Sherlock's savvy mouth. The man did not seem to mind in the slightest and even brought his hands to firmly grasp his arse, encouraging the act further.
And does its best to never fall
The bartender smiled, nodded, and walked away to place the order and pour the beer. The man who had called from the chair now got up, revealing the totality of his form. He was quite large, the kind of man you would expect to eat a dozen eggs in the morning. He wore a red v-neck shirt that was pulled tight over his biceps. Obviously, he was someone who enjoyed working out; probably more for narcissistic purposes than health. His face was clean shaven with a strong jaw and his teeth shone white as he smirked from across the room. John ignored the presumptuous man who was now advancing upon him.
"I promised I would be," came the low reply.
“I can’t look at you right now,” I spat, “I am so disappointed. I thought you cared about Rosie, thought you would protect her. I depended on you, and you let me down in so many ways,” my voice grew thin and choked at the end. Besides the anger, which was most prominent in the current moment, I was incomprehensibly let down. I deflated a bit at that realization and fell silent.
"It is a well known fact that eating before bedtime affects the way in which you sleep. The digestive systems diverts energy in order to process the sustenance being consumed and therefore produces an alternate reaction in the body," he paused, "If I was to choose the ham and cheese on rye, I might dream about a cool morning on the moor with a fresh body. Turkey, I might dream about a night chase through the streets to catch a criminal."
"Do nothing," Sherlock shot back, "It would do nothing John. This is not what we are looking for. Why can't I see it?" He got up and paced, his agitation growing, "It's all here. Why can I not find the clue?"
John laughed nervously, in a way that conveyed that he could not believe he was about to do what he was about to do. He looked away, feeling the burning in his cheeks and the rising of his heartbeat. But he soon looked back to his friend, smiled, and in the spirit of amusement extended his own hand, placing it in Sherlock's outstretched. In an instant they were turning about the resplendent ballroom. Sherlock lead with impressive expertise. It was such that John felt his rhythm with ease and moved in time, though he indeed was not skilled in this area. At first, he felt compelled to look at his feet, nervous that he would step on his partner's. But his head soon rose to the sight of fiery turquoise eyes locking him in, imploring him to pull closer. Out of pure instinct, his arm moved further over Sherlock's shoulder, their bodies now touching. Sherlock responded, tightening his own hold around John's waist. They moved together now, the music encountering them as one. Sherlock had been correct, this was not a dance. It was a feeling.
“I’ll have you know that I made many a masterpiece in my younger years,” he smiled and the mood lightened.
"I don't know. That's why I'm still here. All of the victims displayed the same behaviours. It begins with seclusion, then an increase in irritability," he was pacing now, back and forth in front of John, "As they were all at home, there were never any witnesses to their deaths. Even the ones who employed servants and housekeepers, they only reported the behaviour. The bodies were simply found. Nothing was done John!" he spat out with vexed disgust. He walked away from John in a huff and re-entered the bedroom.
His breath puffed out in white clouds between them. Though close, the space was quietly regarded as too great. John leaned his forehead in and gently met Sherlock's.
"Succumbed. You said that the previous owner succumbed. Succumbed to what exactly?"
"Not for us..."
But in it’s center you will see
Sherlock looked over quizzically, "Were you asleep?"
The evening of the 23rd approached more quickly than anyone had thought possible. Sherlock was nowhere to be found, but that is how it had been the past few days as they did not want the mystery to be given away. The rest of the "cast" were littered about the restaurant, consuming their favourite spirits and chatting about the impending festivities. Tom played on the piano set away by the corner of the stage and Phil sat beside him, a large plate of snacks on his lap. Donovan and Anderson sat at a table nearby listening to the upbeat music and picking at a pile of chips.
Before he had left, an older woman, most likely in her early fifties had come to seek their services. Her greying hair, precisely curled, did not move as she spoke animatedly to Sherlock regarding the house that she was charged with selling. She was a real estate agent specializing in fine vintage homes. This particular home was, in all reality, a castle. It was built a few centuries before any of them were a twinkle in their parent's eyes. The grounds were expansive and the castle itself boasted twenty rooms, including a ballroom, library, and a formal dining room. Sitting north of London in Buckinghamshire, it was a country estate surrounded by aged trees and a dense forest. If you were not looking for it, you might miss it all together. The gates were partially hidden from the road. Overgrown brush had sprung up in the absence of live-in owners and staff who would normally care for it. The wrought iron had stood the test of time begrudgingly. Locked with a chain it was, but with the slightest chiding it would give way and bend to the intruder's will, for it no longer held the inclination to deny passage. She now held the keys to the grand estate, but could not seem to give them away. She had gone on to tell the pair how the rumor in the nearby village was that there was a curse on the house. Ten murders had been recorded there since its conception in the 1700s, all with strange circumstances. Some victims were found alone with no trace of a weapon, others were deemed a murder-suicide. However, the house had been found each time with signs of struggle and items shattered. Windows would be broken and curtains would be torn from their rails; a general disarray would be prevalent throughout the house. The odd commonality between all of the cases were that the suicide victims and the single murders were all found lying alone with no evidence of fatal bodily harm. Only the secondary victims showed signs of trauma, being brutally murdered by the primary victim. All of the primary victims were male and displayed only superficial scratches and bruises. Their bodies were found hunched, hair grown long and unkempt. Their hands gripped the air in front of their chests like claws and a solitary red rose was wound in between their fingertips. Each appeared to have died in pain, but there was no record of how. Of course, the earlier murders would not have been investigated in depth as the forensics of the time were practically nonexistent.
Gaston narrowed his eyes at John, but looked back to the young lady at his side. He grinned, took her arm, and lead her back to where he had previously been sitting. As John's eyes followed them, he noticed there were two more young women already sat by the imposing leather chair. He had not noticed them when he had entered. Each looked identical to the woman in red, with shiny blond hair tied back into a pony tail and pouting red lips. These women were dressed in similar dresses, only one was green and one was yellow. Triplets then. They fawned over Gaston and scooted as close as possible to him as he sat. It was a bit odd. John just shook his head at the scene before him and proceeded to tuck in to his food.
"How could you be stupid enough to pull something like this? Messing with people's lives...you ought to be horse-whipped. First you," he pointed to Anderson, "then you," pointing to Sally, "and then you again!" finishing with Anderson.
"I'm afraid you're becoming the case," John knelt back down, his tone softer. He poured some iodine on one of the towels, "Now keep still, this is going to hurt a little," the towel pressed against the wound and stung in an awful manner. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut & breathed in sharply, but did not move from John's gentle grasp. The doctor leaned forward and blew over the area where the iodine was soaking into the skin. For some reason that always felt better despite the fact that new bacteria was being breathed into an open wound. It brought back fond memories of skinned knees and elbows. His mother tended them in much the same way, firm, but tender. Sherlock relaxed a bit, his face brightening. John continued to pat at each cut, cleaning and sanitizing as much as possible. The bleeding had all but stopped and they would not need stitches, strictly speaking. Thankfully, the wounds on his chest were the same, if a bit deeper. The coat had caught a lot of the force and so the claws had not gouged too terribly. Four even slashes ravaged the skin, but the damage was not as bad as it had initially appeared. John steadied the compliant detective with his hand softly at his back as his other came to wash the vicious looking wounds. The water did not cause him much pain, but when the iodine was added, the necessary evil obliged Sherlock to recoil. John caught him and steadied him once more.
"Not quite what I meant," John laughed, "Is that the only place you've looked? Is there another library?"
"I meant about resolving this. To Hell with the journal. All of these people died from this curse...I can't even believe I'm saying this...and you're next if we don't figure out how to stop it. Jesus, I feel like I'm in some Disney fairytale," John ranted.
"If you hadn't run away, this would have never happened."
Sherlock's brow furrowed and he looked annoyed, "Christmas, John. It's almost here..."
They reached a room toward the end of the hall. Sherlock stopped and motioned at the door. John pushed past him and opened it with a long, high-pitched creak. The room itself was just as lovely as the rest of the house, if a bit untended. Splendidly decorated, it showed some signs of disuse, though it hardly took away from the overall impression. John set his bag on the end of the bed.
"Are you worried you'll fall?"
John was now becoming nervous, "Sherlock, you've been here for nearly two weeks," he gently brought his hands up to reciprocate the hold his friend had on him, "A break, just a small break..." he looked into Sherlock's eyes and saw something he had never seen before. He did not know what it was, but it was wholly unfamiliar and strange. All he knew is that he wanted it gone. This case was doing something to his friend, something unhealthy. His face was drawn and unshaven, and his arms shook from within. He would have to up his game if he wanted to talk Sherlock out of his work-induced mania this time.
The two of them jumped simultaneously and looked up.
"Hmmmm," his eyes narrowed, "Another Afghanistan flashback, mild by the looks of it," he stepped over to the desk beside the window.
"How are you feeling?"
John drew back from Sherlock, whose cheeks were now a stunning shade of red, "I don't know how I could have doubted you."
"I should have done more," he voice was so thin, it could have been made of crepe.
I could feel the heat in my chest start to rise within me and my body hummed with overactive sensibilities, “What the Hell do you think you’re doing?” I yelled.
Sherlock looked down at the floor momentarily, "Fine. I will see you when you return then," he turned on his heel and stalked off toward his room.
John sighed, "Yeah, I do it to amuse myself sometimes."
"Good evening," he said briefly and continued on to the closest seat at the end of the polished wood counter. He sat and attempted to ignore the looks and whisperings of the room. This was, after all, a small town and he was an outsider. He understood, but that did not make it any less awkward.
"You know, just for the record, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Hudson is one of the most decent, unselfish things I've ever seen from you. I want to apologize for Donovan and the way she spoke about you. I know you don't care that much, but...she gets it in her head that you're some villain, when really...you're more like the knight on a dark horse."
"I can do that," John smiled, cupping the back of Sherlock's head, "I can do that."
"Yes," John swallowed back his fears.
“No, I don’t think that you do. I failed you once, I don’t intend on doing it again.”
Before he could finish, a familiar face came walking in the side door carrying a bag of groceries. A young boy, about fourteen, with wavy ginger hair and pink cheeks followed her with a stack of fire wood in his arms.
His long fingers rose weakly to meet John's cheek, "At least I got to be with you one time, at least I am here with you...at the end," his arm went slack then and fell to John's lap. He lay there unmoving on the cold, grey stone floor.
He stopped and looked at John.
John went to him cautiously, but he only pulled away, maintaining distance and murmuring much of the same that he had previously expressed. He repeated himself over and over and over. His demeanor was agitated, but seemingly tired now, as if tremendously weak. He rocked there on his knees in the middle of the bed, his mind far, far away. John remained still, trying to breathe and still his fiercely beating heart. He was truly at a loss, and so he stood motionless in the devastated room. He felt there was something that he should say, but the words would not come. Suddenly, Sherlock sat back and turned, his back facing John. He paused for a brief moment and then rose, walking out onto the terrace in solitary silence.
"I thought you were going to drag this one out," John said with a hint of sarcasm, "What about your family dinner?"
His name was Lawrence Hawkes. He had kept the journal from an early age and as the story progressed, his thoughts became more self-centered. After his parents died, he was given anything and everything he had wanted, except for what he wanted most. The servants had done their best, but it was not enough to replace the love of a mother and a father. The pain from his parents death turned him cold to the world, and he wanted nothing to do with it. He had become spoiled, selfish, and unkind. The things provided for him, toys, clothing, horses, they became his focus for they gave him pleasure in a world he felt was devoid of it. They were his world. Human interaction was secondary and he grew apathetic to it. The engagement to the woman who would later become his victim was only at the urging of the mindless faces surrounding him. He accepted it, but admittedly never cared for the young lady.
It brings about a mournful cry
I chuckled to myself as the cab pulled up outside 221B Baker Street. But the mirth would only last a moment. I opened the door to the flat and walked toward the voices I heard coming from the kitchen. It was there that I saw them. Sherlock was bent over the table beside Rosie, who stood on an obliging chair. Goggles, that appeared gigantic on her little face, were strapped around her head. The blue rubber band being adjusted for the size, caused two flaps to bounce off of the sides of her head in a way that would have been rather comedic if the situation had been different. But it was not. Beakers with various colors of liquid were spread out over the table. One was in front of the pair. Sherlock held Rosie’s hand as she used an eye dropper to squeeze something yellow into it. He counted sweetly to her and she repeated the numbers back to him. Her eyes sparkled and she smiled brilliantly.
It was infectious, in fact, his smile. I could not help but reflect it, “All right Picasso, what do you say to popcorn and a movie?”
It was more of a statement than a question. Sherlock was in obvious need of rest, but would not likely do so without some cajoling. Perhaps if he could get the man calmed and redirected enough, he could persuade him to lie down for a short time. He often did not sleep while on cases, however at times it went too far. Back home, John would have to insist that he take a break and normally Sherlock crashed hard for a few hours.
Down came his fingers, slashing like the sharp, penetrating claws of the forest wolves. They ripped the oil-painted face of the fair young man and pulled the frame from its mount. The whole thing came crashing down over the bedside table. Glass shattered and trinkets flew to the corners of the room. The ferocity made John take a step backward, the rain of splintered frame and debris narrowly missing him.
"Well then, I think you owe me twenty quid," John joked attempting to lighten the mood; though his smile was soon lost as Sherlock's expression did not change, nor did he offer a reply, "Umm, you sure you're okay?"
"Oh God, Sherlock," he moaned into the air, his eyes closed as his ministrations advanced. He slipped in another finger, and then another, imagining it was himself. He stroked Sherlock and Sherlock responded. His cock ached something awful. He had imagined this once, maybe twice, but that was all he would own up to. Each time could not compare to the sight, the smell, the taste, and the feeling that this moment bore.
"Come John, it seems we have a haunting to debunk," Sherlock said. He started toward his room.
"Fresh air," John began. Sherlock gave him a confused look, "Walk with me?" He finished.
"Maybe they just figured out what is wrong with it and left. No reason for them to stop back by here," the blond bartender offered.
John stared right back at Sherlock, "Sometimes I get carried away," his voice was dry and wavering. The cold bit at his sensibilities, but that was not the only cause of the tremble.
John's smile meant no nonsense and the man bristled, "You need a lesson in manners..." he went to grab John's shirt, but was stopped by a pretty young lady with white blond hair and full red lips. Her matching red dress was feminine, if a bit low cut, and she curled around the man's arm as she spoke.
"Yes," Sherlock breathed.
"She got called away to London and she won't be back until Christmas Eve. It actually worked out well, I thought," John replied.
"...the phone that has been going off for the past twenty minutes in increasing texts, a bit too often for business, at least his business. Not very successful..."
"This sudden change, and don't pretend to not know what I'm talking about, Sherlock. This was all supposed to be settled, no changes, everyone knew their part. There's a lot riding on this and you know it. How could you be so selfish?" John was exasperated and the anger showed in his eyes.
"I know," John murmured.
John huffed, raising his finger to speak his mind to the waiting face in front of him, but decided it was really of no use. Pulling the scarf from Sherlock's neck,  he turned with a jerk, and walked toward a taxi that was waiting in the near by car park.
Sherlock, already in action, soon turned around and set the steaming cups on the center island side by side. A little, round, white tea-pot, donning a purple and gold mob cap-like top, was soon to follow. Swirling wisps of Earl Grey wafted through the air between them and it all felt very settling. It was then that Sherlock finally spoke.
"Hmmm, strange..." John said offhandedly. He looked at Sherlock, standing stoic and still bundled in his coat and scarf, "Sherlock," he turned and grabbed the lapels of the detective's Belstaff, turning them down and loosening the scarf below, "You look like Nanook of the North..."
"All the more reason to find the solution as soon as possible," Sherlock fiercely interrupted.
"It's a shame about the lodge. With no snow plus the murders," he took a spoonful of soup, "I hope the business picks up for her."
It all ran through my head in an instant. My father instincts were kicking in. Not only that, but the thought of Rosie getting hurt, or worse, brought about a slight panic. She was the most important thing in my life. She was beautiful, smart, and precious. She was all I had left of Mary. I couldn’t protect Mary. My vision tunneled.
"That's quite improbable..."
"What is that supposed to mean?"
“You don’t know any movies.”
Once again, he did as was requested, overcoming the urges at war in his brain, "John...perhaps if I die..."
"But he wasn't killed. He killed his fiancée and then himself," John replied.
"This place, it's spectacular," John said as he watched Sherlock make the tea. Normally, he would have done it himself, but Sherlock seemed to know where everything was and set about boiling the pot as soon as they had reached the kitchen. It was massive. The fuscous tile floor seemed to stretch on for miles and the wood and iron chandeliers hung like planets amidst the dark beams of the ceiling. The appliances had obviously been updated, but still seemed to blend into the rest of the kitchen. They hid among the bright wooden countertops, which were fit for the most highly skilled of butchers. The cabinetry held iron hinges and handles that splayed out with flourishes of curls against their distressed taupe faces.
John sighed in annoyance, "Sherlock....listen, we don't know what is going on with you and..."
"It's all right, just stay still," he moved the thick cloth of Sherlock's jacket and looked at the bleeding wounds beneath, "I need to get you inside. These need to be treated. Can you walk?"
He checked Sherlock's room first, but the lights were out and there was no answer at the door. He went to his own room on the off-chance Sherlock had sought him out. But no one was there either. He ran back to the front of the lodge. There were still people filing into the entrance and the lobby was brimful. He sighed with frustration; he needed to find Sherlock and soon. John cut through the crowd with urgency. He moved so quickly, he scarcely noticed bumping into the shoulder of none other than the elder Holmes brother, Mycroft.
"It was long ago. I don't think it makes much difference."
"We aren't checking in," Sherlock said curtly, "I'm Sherlock Holmes and this is John Watson. We are here for the murders."
"Yes, that's all, Mr. Holmes."
The house had eventually become known as haunted. It stood alone, dark, and empty. The stories of ghosts and goblins inhabiting the manor and surrounding woods kept the locals far away, and the murders became nothing more than history and rumor. The manor was presently owned by a family that had inherited it from the previous owner, who also had refused to live there. As far as the realtor knew, they had hosted a few large parties at the location, but it was becoming too expensive to keep it in even the slightest state of repair. They were seeking help in dismissing the rumor that it was haunted. That the murders were nothing more than coincidences, more likely resulting from living a secluded lifestyle or issues of mental instability. If there was an actual issue with the manor or property, such as a natural phenomenon or defect that would be causing the abnormalities in behaviour, she would need to know that as well. Over the years, contractors and surveyors had been called upon to evaluate the property, each time coming up with nothing. Sherlock was normally not keen to accept a case that dealt with something as asinine as haunting lore, however the details of the series of murders presented a challenge. It was out of the norm, peculiar even. He decided to accept and leave for Buckinghamshire the next day. The realtor handed him the keys, stating that he could take as long as needed, within reason, and that the house was stocked in case he would like to stay there during the investigation. After handing over her contact information, she left with a smile of relief on her face.
She nodded, "I'm afraid so. The ski tow up the way is only being used to hang the wash. If this keeps up, I may have to give up on the lodge. It's a shame too. I have a lot invested here, and it's such a lovely spot to go on holiday...very quiet."
Sherlock discovered John standing across the crowd and his breath drew in viciously. He slowly raised his violin and, closing his eyes, brought the bow to rest upon the taught strings. Then came a strain so pure in its movement that it silenced every mouth in the vicinity. We Three Kings of Orient Are rang through the room and reached all spaces that would have it, and some that would not. It was sweet and nostalgic. Smiles of remembrance quickly spread throughout the room, and John was no exception. The rapturous tune hushed his fiercely beating heart though his breath remained ragged. It was suspect that the reason for this phenomenon was not his recent exertion, but that his heart held perfectly still in place to allow his ears to take in the melody, as the form onstage took his breath away.
"I'm sorry...you own this hotel?" John asked confused.
Sherlock turned back to his station before the glass, "Please, don't look at me."
"Sherlock."
An introduction was heard by both men marking the beginning of the show.
"Why...why didn't you....I didn't know," John's voice was thick with emotion.
When they parted, queries and thoughts hung in the glittering air between them. John gazed at Sherlock as he never had before. The man's hair had somehow returned to its natural state, rings of auburn shining in the brilliance. He appeared clean-shaven, his skin luminous and smooth. The curve of his spine was gone and he lay relaxed and lanky upon John's knees. The doctor then noticed another happening that he could not understand, and frankly did not want to. He opened the navy jacket. The silver embroidery glimmered in the sunlight, and cast white freckles upon his cheeks. He felt along the unscathed chest, remembering the iodine and numerous wraps it had required after the incident in the woods. Though the wounds had begun to heal over the past few days, a wolf's claws would leave their mark. Now there were none. The skin was smooth and luminous.
I looked to where her tiny finger was pointing. There, behind the beakers was a box of washable, non-toxic food coloring. Upon further inspection I discovered several paint brushes and sheets of white paper. The table had been covered with newspaper and a cup of water with used brushes sat in the far corner. I looked up from the table and peered around the kitchen. Through my tirade I had neglected to observe the multiple paintings hung on a string with clothes pins to dry. They were brightly colored, though some looked like they were overly mixed, bordering on black. Rosie showed me her hands. They were perfect, delicate, small, and all the colors of the rainbow.
His eyes flew open then, just in time to see bright flashes coming from outside. The accompanying booms forcing him to cover his ears, he sat up in his bunk. The crisp sound of broken glass was replaced by a resounding thunder. Their location was under attack. Dust and smoke blew in clouding the barrack. It assaulted his nose and eyes. He looked around. His fellow soldiers were already on their feet. He attempted to join them, but the side of the room suddenly collapsed inward. The force of the explosion sent him flying back against the opposite wall. His left arm hit hard and he could feel it shatter. The onslaught continued, explosions raining down in torrents. The last thing he remembered before he blacked out was the image of his ornament, shattered just like his arm, resting on the floor in pieces.
"Let's have a look at the room then, shall we?"
John was by his side directly, checking the hand. He carefully pulled the thorn away and covered the damaged palm with a handkerchief.
"Well, you can have any room in the place, including mine..." Tom said glumly.
"The answer to your question," Sherlock said without looking up, "the answer is yes."
"Sherlock," John interrupted.
His response:
"Homicide is my..." he began, but was abruptly cut off by John's disapproving tut. He sighed and pursed his lips, "Mycroft is coming to Christmas dinner at our parents'," he quickly finished. He fidgeted with the large holiday menu sitting near the wall, pretending to be mildly interested in the image of snow and pine trees on the front.
"You're alive..." Gaston started.
"I have just the place," protest forgotten, he walked out from behind the counter carrying the plate of sandwiches, "We'll gather around the fire. It's a lovely open-hearth in here," he headed into the other room.
Sherlock released him then. Sitting back, he allowed John to rise, though he made no indication of removing himself from atop John's legs. Eyes now open, John breathed in deeply, but would not look to his friend.
"Sherlock," the bartender answered, not looking up from the computer screen.
"I mean you shouldn't mix dreams with liverwurst and buttermilk."
"That's just it, you didn't think," John sighed and composed himself, "Now, I'm going to find Sherlock to square it with him. And I want you to do one thing for me. Make sure the crowd doesn't get restless. I don't know how long this may take. You make sure these people are filled with bloody yuletide cheer. Mrs. Hudson's happiness is riding on it."
Sherlock's face fell and he began to protest, "It is not a..."
John interrupted, "I'd rather not discuss last night if you don't mind," he ran his fingers through his hair. His manner became flustered and he paced back and forth.
"So you'll do it then?" John ignored his bravado.
A masterpiece may hang on a wall
Sherlock stood there. At first he had looked startled, then confused. Now he had turned his attentions to his shoes. He did not look at me. Perhaps it was an admission of guilt, perhaps a mere reaction to the chiding, but he looked somewhat…sad. I could not pay that any mind at the moment, however, what he had done was inexcusable.
And amuse the clouds away
"It's an interesting theory," John said.
"The case is not solved," Sherlock replied simply.
"A bit chilly in here," John interrupted. A sudden chill had run through him and he pulled his robe together over his chest.
If you never look, it will be there
They ran to the large doors behind the stage and opened them wide. The countryside was covered in a thin blanket of white. You could not have found a better landscape on a Hallmark card. The ropes were pulled from stage right and the red velvet curtains parted. The oohs and ahhs sprang up from the crowd and the clapping and cheering became even louder. Sherlock and John turned to each other, knowing smiles plastered on their faces. They had done it. The people would return to the Colombia Lodge; if nothing else, to remember and reminisce about the Christmas that Sherlock came to the outskirts of Weymouth. To remember the danger, the mystery, the music, and finally, the snow.
John had not noticed the portrait before. It was a young man; the orphaned owner of the manor. He recognized him from another family portrait he had passed in another part of the house. Seeing the painting now, it struck him in the oddest way. The man was thin and stunning. He was dressed in a blue coat with gold braided embellishments. Long, brown hair hung to his shoulders in twists and waves and green-blue eyes seemed to stare right through him. It remarkably resembled Sherlock and that unsettled John more than anything that had happened up to this point. A sense of dread washed over him.
"Where will you sleep?" He asked drowsily.
"No," Sherlock replied, his voice now resigned, "It did not."
"Maybe he hid it before he died?" John offered.
This time, John remained silent at the approval and answered with his entrance. Nerves all over his body exploded and he shut his eyes to stop the world from spinning. The cry that rang out from his lover resonated in his ears and he thought the silvery sound may never leave them. It was the sound of a warm fire in the sitting room, the sound of a deliberately messy experiment in the kitchen going awry, of tea kettles and phone calls from The Yard. It was the sound that belonged to 221B, a small, unassuming flat in the middle of London where he had found home.
"Look, it will be easy. I'll call Lestrade and Donovan. We'll create a murder mystery, but we won't tell you who the murderer is. It won't be theatre. In a sense, you'd be solving a case! And helping Mrs. Hudson at the same time," he sat back completely satisfied with his genius plan.
"After yesterday, I'm not so sure. We had a pretty good row. I think he was serious. I just don't understand why."
Sherlock looked at the sandwiches and then back to John, "I don't understand. I'm not the one eating."
"Yes, dear," Mrs Hudson addressed John, "Something I invested in after my husband died. A sort-of parting gift to myself. Tom here is my second in command when I'm in London," the grey-haired man nodded, "And this is my great-nephew, Phillip," the boy nodded as well, adding a quick hello, "He likes to go by Phil," she added, whispering to the side.
"I have to solve this," Sherlock whispered, his pain-filled voice giving out on him.
"Sherlock..." John tried, looking back and forth from the painting to his friend, but Sherlock was not listening.
"So we are going to perform this...on a stage?" Anderson asked.
"Listen, this case is obviously not getting solved tonight. Let's get some rest and start again tomorrow. I think I might have some ideas. I met some of the towns folk and they may be able to provide some more information. We could head there in the morning," he took another sip of tea.
The tremble was now shared between them. To the tips of their fingers, it tremored as their hands reached for each other. The brushing of the lips that followed brought about a hum and a warmth so virtuous that Spring itself would shy away from it's consummate execution. So soft it was and so dear, that though it pained them greatly, they parted ever so slightly for one vital tradition.
"Sherlock, please," he said, "Look at me. Look at me!"
The effect did not take hold, "Lies! Why do people lie? They lie to me because they know I know the truth and they hate me for it. And I hate them because they have always hated me. They want me to go away...the freak, the emotionless monster," he spat, now pacing the floor, "I am no better than the criminals I catch, no better than the vermin that roam the streets...a beast!" at this he bent over and pulled a chair up off of the floor. Holding it high above his head, he threw it across the room with a strength John had never seen. It broke into several pieces as it hit the opposite wall and clattered to the floor.
Soon, they were on their way to the lodge. True to Sherlock's word, it was just outside of town, on a small road dotted by thin trees. A tiny brook traversed their path and the taxi drove over a small, stone bridge leading to the property. The lodge was quaint; it was the sort of place you would go to on holiday looking for peace and quiet. The aging wood showed signs of care through the years. The white paint was not fresh nor was the scarlet trim; it gave the lodge a vintage feel that so many longed for in this age of fast-paced hours and round-the-clock technology. The porch stood inviting against the bucolic landscape as the near full moon showered its light upon the pitched roof. A few wrought iron lanterns illuminated the road and drive way, and all the lights of the main building were still glowing through the four picture windows facing front.
John smiled, "I know, but if you were..."
John helped him to his feet, "Let's get you back."
Sherlock turned his face to John mere inches away, "It's snowing."
The mystery was coming along with only a few snags and disagreements. They were mostly to play themselves, which would lend itself to each of their limited acting experiences. There was just one exception.
John sang back to Sherlock as he grinned, "If you're worried and you can't sleep, just count your blessings instead of sheep," Sherlock chuckled and chimed in with him.
***********Song as old as rhyme
"There was not much to look for. This is where I started, but most of these are normal fiction, non-fiction, reference. I needed personal accounts, details, hidden items that have been forgotten. The signal here is rubbish, so my laptop and phone were of no use. When I found the room, I knew I had a breakthrough. It has afforded me more information than anything, however I still cannot find the cause," he looked down and to the side, as he often did when having to admit something he had no desire to admit, "I'm...afraid that it may become more urgent that I do so."
And that's what did it. Sherlock stopped, the beast retreating. The man who now hovered above John was flushed and shaking. There were not many times that he had heard John plead. He examined the conflict going on behind his face. He stilled, his breath slow and measured.
"Sherlock," this time it was light, tender, and trepidatious.
John was all ears on this one, "Very much."
"It's only a scratch," the good doctor reassured him.
The page displayed the story of a serial killer on the loose in the country. There had been multiple victims so far, found in outlying locations. Strange letters were attached to their clothing, which looked as though it had been removed, freshly laundered, and returned to the victim posthumously. The letters themselves were strange in that they were in a beautiful script and formally written. Each was addressed to the victim, but did not state any personal facts. They were written as if the murderer were writing a letter of recommendation. The weapon of choice appeared to be an axe, as parts of the bodies were clean-severed and missing. The police reported leads, but it was obvious that they had none. There were no other clues reported and nothing in common between the victims.
Sherlock slowly rose, "I did not mean for you to reply, it was only an approval so that you would say my name again, in that tone preferably," he ran a long finger over John's mouth.
“This should be interesting…”
"Look at me," he commanded softly. But John's eyes remained shut, his head rolled to the side.
"Uh yeah, not quite," John rubbed his eyes and sat up, "What the bloody hell are you doing?"
Stopping once again, John looked up, "Look, Sherlock, I don't know what is going on, but you're not yourself. I think we need to find out what is happening, or what happened here in the past..."
"Because you are the only one without acting experience and you're the only one who hasn't been in front of the cameras. The whole point of the show is to get people in here who have seen the cases on the tele or the paper and recognize the familiar faces," Lestrade explained. Anderson grumbled.
Sherlock's face at first was unreadable and he walked with such command over to where John stood that he almost seemed to do it in purposeful slow motion. Though John knew that to be ridiculous, even for Sherlock's dramatics. When he reached his friend, his voice came out as slow as his gait, but as deep as the darkness surrounding the castle.
“Dada!” Rosie squealed in delight and held out her arms for me.
"I'm perfectly fine, why wouldn't I be?"
Sherlock cocked his head to one side, "None of them, really," but he said no more.
Before John could respond, he leapt off of the end of the bed and hurried out of the door. The other man was left sitting alone and found himself, once again, utterly at a loss.
Sighing, half with annoyance, half with concern, John got up and followed. He rounded the corner to find Sherlock at the large double doors that lead to the terrace. They were open at his behest and the cold was like a slap in the face. Though instead of making the distressed man come to his senses, it only incensed him further. His hands gripped the sheer drapes that framed the glass doors. Tighter and tighter they held, until his knuckles were white from the lack of blood. He roared; deep and coarse the sound came howling from his throat. In one quick movement he tore the sheers from their rod and turned. It looked like gossamer wings settling down behind him, but angelic he was not. His eyes were lit like an autumn bonfire and his fingers remained curled as if the drapes were still clutched within them. But he had let them go. He had to let them go. He wanted it all to go.
Sherlock had responded with, “She wanted it,” a slightly guilty look followed, “It’s not as if it is sharp. I took off the tip.”
"That is not what I meant," he answered softly.
"She got it in a shrewd business move," the man behind the counter answered.
“My interests are not solely scientific nor forensic. She is too young for the violin, and I remembered how much I enjoyed painting as a child.”
John looked at him, but Sherlock was staring out into the distance. Deep in thought, he remained stationary. There was so much going through his head; there was always so much going through his head. John wondered about it. He knew that there was not sufficient time for all of Sherlock's thoughts to be shared; not enough by half. He mostly listened, and often kept silent, except for when the moment called for it, of course. In this instance, there was no calling. The night was just fine the way it was without his voice stealing away from it. He moved closer to Sherlock and took his hand, standing shoulder to shoulder. They stood that way for a long while, the sanguine golden light from the ballroom competing with the clear-sighted stars shining down upon them.

John changed the subject. One thing he did not want was another train ride with "I'm-unhappy-and-bored-so-I'm-going-to-be-a-monstrous-prat" Sherlock. He looked to where Mrs. Hudson was cleaning up behind the bar.
His hands and feet unbound, he jumped out of the bed and moved toward the hall, trying to ignore the scathing marks left by his bindings. He peeked out warily, knowing that he may be discovered at any time. The house was large, but Sherlock would not leave him there for long unsupervised. He crept out into the blessedly dark passage, staying close to the walls and in the shadows. At every creak and moan of the manor, he stopped. During every bout of thunder he ran. He was able to reach the front door with no sign of Sherlock. Though he still did not trust that his solitude would last much longer. His plan was to take the car and get to town as fast as possible. He was sure the local police would be able to help. At least they could get back up there to get Sherlock out of the house and figure out what to do to stop the progression of whatever it was that was affecting him.
If you never see, it is aware
The brightness of the morning sun shining through the window was not what awoke John the next morning. He lay with his back to it, in fact. But his dreams had been erratic and his mind wanted so desperately to wake that it would not leave him alone to sleep. When his eyes opened he caught the sound of curtains swishing and saw a shadow upon the wall. He turned, the soft sheets pulling around his body.
"Will you excuse us please, Phil?" He asked hurriedly.
John had gone back into the private library after that. His insides were in a disconcerted uproar, but he felt satisfied that he would be able to hear any further upset on the part of Sherlock, for he was nearby and his ears keen. However he soon found himself awakening on top of a pile of books. He had fallen asleep. Jumping up, he ran into the other room scanning for the detective. The terrace doors were closed, the room still in disarray, but with no more damage than what had been done previously. He ran to the doors and looked through the glass out onto the balcony. Unkempt and glazed with frost it was, but at the moment no one occupied it.
“Is any of this toxic? It better not be because if I find so much as a reddened patch on her, I swear, Sherlock…”
"There is much to discover, John. Sleep would have hindered the work," he spoke slowly, as if to a child. John hated when he did that. It was not as if he had forgotten that the work was paramount to Sherlock. The half-full tea cups lying about the flat and doors of all sorts left ajar were a testament to that.
John added, "Besides, Sherlock is less likely to say something...unwelcome onstage if you're lying dead on the floor."
Sherlock turned to me, looking as though he was about to launch into one of his practical ramblings about how a toddler’s motor skills were too underdeveloped to make such a conclusion, but all he said was, “Yes.”
"Mrs. Hudson," he replied in his usual detached manner. Inwardly, he held an abundance of affection for the woman, however tedious she could be sometimes.
"It's December 18th," he yelled after him, "Sherlock..."
I then made it clear that there was to be no more experiment paraphernalia about where Rosie could reach. It was bad enough having heads in the fridge and molds on the counter. Scalpels, beakers, forceps, and chemicals was where I drew the line. Now, I am not the most cautious person by nature, but in recent months it had become blindingly apparent that the flat needed baby-proofing. I had gone about placing things out of reach of my plucky and inquisitive toddler. Some of the kitchen, particularly the cupboards, had to be rearranged, much to Sherlock’s dismay. He never said anything much, however. He knew better than that after the scientific utensils talk.
"You're really not coming?"
The sound came from behind him where John lay on the stone entry. He had not noticed in the rush of action that he had knocked his partner to the ground. He glanced back. John was splendid. He was sprawled out upon the grey stones, his blue jeans hugging his legs, his knees bent allowing his muscular thighs to be seen quite well. The white collared shirt hung open to his stomach as the buttons were wrenched off in the altercation. Sherlock was paralyzed at the sight. John's face pleaded with him. It pulled him back from the precipice, reminding him that his life was worth more. That fact sank in even more profoundly because of John's sacrifice. It was worth more because John deemed it so, because he had put Sherlock's life before all else. Because he had held him, touched him, let him know that when it came to saving his life, nothing was too great to ask. Sherlock's face softened at this momentarily before he turned back to his captive and said in a most restrained aggressive cadence.
"Why are you here, John?" His breath had increased two-fold.
"It wasn't enough," Sherlock looked into John's eyes, "It wasn't enough that I have loved you since the moment you first walked into the lab at Bart's. That I want you with me and I'm jealous when you're away. That I'd run into Hell and back if it happened that it was the only place offering the tea you prefer. But it wasn't enough. You had to love me in return."
"See? Isn't that better?" Sherlock asked hopefully.
Sherlock finished the rest of his drink in one gulp, much to John's surprise, "I was bored. Besides, it's not just homicide, John. This is a serial killer, and a proud one at that. He wants so desperately to be caught. They all do. They love their work. They want it on display. He may not even know that he wants to be caught, but it compels him. He puts a signature on his victims like an artist puts a signature on a painting. And what artist does not want to be recognized for the genius of their work?"
"So out with it then, what have you got?"
"Sorry," John murmured.
The local DI was a stern and serious young man. He took his job too seriously in fact, most likely due to the fast promotion and subsequent stress beyond the experience of his limited amount of decades on this Earth. Still, he was concise and gave the pair all the information they required, handing a copy of the file to the consulting detective. John was grateful for this as he was really hoping to get some semblance of sleep tonight.
Sherlock stopped as well and turned to look back at John, "He was cursed," he paused as John sighed with disbelief, "The old woman who came to the door, she asked him for help in exchange for a small token of gratitude and he refused her. He threw the gift out into the night. Why do you think the roses surround the house? They grow and bloom at times when all others would not. They guard this house like they are warding off apathy and emptiness. That's why not all of the occupants have come to the same end. When Lawrence Hawkes refused the woman, he says that she shed her haggard appearance and a beautiful young lady appeared in her place. He tried to apologize, but it was too late. She saw there was no love in his heart. She cursed him so that his outside would match his inside; a beast, ugly and prone to rage. He locked himself away after that and would see no one. He did not die that night, though the accounts were modified to say as much. The reality was much worse. He did not eat nor sleep. Try as they might, the servants could not get him to come out of his room. Even his fiancée tried, and she payed for it with her life. To spare the family name, the loyal house staff made the story a mystery, for it was not completely a lie. They did not know what had happened to make their master act so strangely. And there it sat, the truth was walled up inside of a scarlet leather journal in a hidden room. But now it has been discovered..."
"I'm sorry," his sigh was racked with guilt, "Christ love, I am so sorry."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, "The murderer has been caught, no thanks to the local police force. The only clever thing they did was call us. And, as you have stated multiple times, Christmas is almost here..."
It must be said that during the opening credits, and as the sweet music began, his hand came to rest upon mine. I looked down and then up. His eyes, blue, and green, and gorgeous, looked back. One rogue curl fell in front of the rest and I felt compelled to brush it aside. Not that it marred his features, you see, but at that very moment, I saw a masterpiece in him.
"NO! Don't you talk to me. I am a monster. I treat everyone as mindless peons. Because they're nothing, nothing to me! Because I don't care. I have no love, no soul, only my mind...and what's is that worth?" his voice broke and his brow wrinkled, his eyes grew red at the edges. And then something inside him snapped. It was like witnessing Jekyll and Hyde come to reality. Growling, with curled hair flowing wildly around him, he knocked over chairs and tore the sheets from the bed as he ranted. He jumped up on the now bare mattress. Standing tall with his shoulders back and his legs shoulder-width apart, his stance was war-like and frightening, "You started this," he pontificated to a painting above the headboard, "You were the same. Why?!?"
Sherlock's lips tightened and his eyes lowered once more as he paused. John cocked his head to the side and gazed up at him, attempting to garner his attention. Through tousled curls, Sherlock returned the gaze and spoke with a voice that resounded deep in John's chest, "The curse upon this house."
"John!" Sherlock called.
"Of course I'm bloody alive. Now what can I do for," he gestured to the townsfolk, "all of you."
John thought with exasperation.
"Didn't you?" Came the reply.
He lashed out, needing it to stop, needing to take a breath. He fought back once again to stop Sherlock from advancing. He attempted to free his hands, but the strength with which they were held was immense, more than he thought his companion had in him. It was no use, but he could not allow this to happen. He was not even sure if he wanted it to happen. But maybe he did. Numerous lonely nights had lead the rogue thought to enter his mind. It had even gone further than that on a few occasions. He had wondered what Sherlock's body would feel like against his; how his skin would feel sliding smoothly up and down against his own in the dark. A few times, he had run his hands up and down his stomach and chest envisioning Sherlock there. He touched himself, his strong hands squeezing and pulling at the most sensitive areas. Moans would come unbidden, and in the dark he did not feel alone. Those nights now came back to haunt him. They assaulted him, making his arms weak and his resolve weaker. He was truly torn, and if Sherlock's mind was but partially intact, he would deduce this.
Sherlock walked briskly through the crisp, brown leaves that littered the ground. Up the stairs he went, into the lobby, and straight to the front desk, John in tow. They set their bags down in an unplanned unison with a noisy thud. A gentleman, tall and thin, whose greying hair was coifed close to his head, stood behind the counter. His demeanor was formal and practiced, as a soldier's might be, but his face was kind. He looked up, smiled, and greeted the two travelers.
"You really think that the three of you could come up with a mystery that I could not solve in the first 30 seconds of your 'dinner theatre'. Really. It's going to be a short night," he scoffed.
"Sherlock? Sherlock?!" He shook the other man by the shoulders, "Jesus," he held Sherlock's head, stroking his cheeks, "Wake up, stay with me...Sherlock, please," he gave one cheek a couple of light slaps, "No, no...come on! Wake up!" He fell backwards. A sinking feeling building in the pit of his stomach, "This isn't happening. How can this be real? There has to be a reason, something we missed," A shuddered breath and doctor mode kicked in. He was back over Sherlock, bringing himself face to face. He checked for breathing. It was there, but faint and slowing, "Sherlock, please," he begged, salty tears threatening the corners of his eyes, "Please don't leave," the tears won out and fell freely, marking the dying man's face with shining crystals of despair, "I love you."
The candelabras were lit, making the entire room glow, though the ceiling was high above and the enormous windows allowed the star filled sky to act as an inky backdrop. It was a bright and mirthful place, alive and well in the sad and neglected manor. It must have been the room that was met with the most care. He knew the present owners had used it for galas and such. The grand ballroom was dressed in gold with swaths of silk fabric draped above his head. The ceiling was a beautiful mural of blue sky and playful cherubs who laughed and cheered the dancers far below. An umber marble floor warmed the room despite its cold origin in the quarries.
"It's past eight. And I'm afraid to ask if you have made arrangements for lodging," came the snarky reply.
"It didn't work then," John said quietly. The fact had been echoing in his mind despite all efforts to ignore it.
"Right," he replied distractedly, still musing over how it could be that he did not know about this little side venture of hers.
"No."
"I can't."
Sherlock let go of John's arms and took a step back, "Detached," his face flashed with panic, though he quickly recovered. He was collected when he spoke again, "I suppose a cup of tea might be helpful," an appeasing smile ghosted his lips.
"Succumbed..."
John smiled back, but sighed on the inside. It was progress. However, the look of alarm on Sherlock's face had definitely not gone unnoticed. He wasn't sure what had triggered it, but it solidified the realization that a sharp eye may be best for the time being. He closed his eyes, feeling the burning sting of weariness behind them. At this particular moment, a cuppa was a welcome thought, "All right," he stood aside, "Where's the kitchen?"
The man in red answered him, "Yeah, he came in a week or two ago asking about the manor house on the outskirts of town. He said he was investigating it. No one has seen him since."
"It'll be fine...watch..."
Sherlock looked down, "That's good to know," he sighed, "To tell you the truth, one gets a bit shaky all alone on one of those midnight chargers," his gaze once again fell upon John.
These past few weeks had not been the norm, and now they were facing a challenge that neither was fully processing. For who could process such a dilemma? Curses, enchantments, magic roses surrounding a castle far, far away. It was nonsense, and the pair knew it. Yet, the sun still shone on the ill-kept manor. It's large stone walls stood the test of time, existing in one and then the next. The air that chilled those walls turned stale as it entered the closed off rooms and dark hallways. It was stagnant, refusing to move on with the passing years. Perhaps that is how the consulting detective and the former Captain became inexorably caught up in this nonsensical situation. Air was never suspect in the beginning. It was an observer, an invisible companion to any crime scene until proven malignant.
"We're leaving," Sherlock slammed down the screen and stalked off toward his bedroom.
"No, they all had one," Sherlock answered, "His death started the whole chain. He refused the rose. He had the first."
John pulled his car around to the front; the driveway made a large circle before the structure. He did not see Sherlock's car, but perhaps there was a garage around the back, he thought. Being that there was a limited amount of light and he was becoming a bit fatigued, he decided this would be fine for the moment. He stopped the engine and got out. Climbing the stairs to the door, he looked up to the windows of the manor. Indeed, light could be seen in a few of them, announcing the presence of someone. He hoped it was Sherlock and he would not be disturbing some caretaker. Although, it was fairly late for anyone to be taking care of the chores, and where else would Sherlock be if not here? He raised the large knocker, fashioned in the image of a gargoyle, and let it fall. It made a resounding noise that he was sure could be heard for miles. However, crashes of iron in the dark notwithstanding, no one answered the door. He then tried the handle, which opened easily to his surprise. The great door pushed open and John stuck his head in to look around.
What John did next, he could not account for. He took the outstretched hand and slid into bed next to Sherlock. They lay there, warm and close. They were both thinking the same thing, although neither one would voice it. Why was this happening? How would they satisfy the curse? How deep the love and of what nature? How could something like this be possible outside of Grimm and Anderson?
"What?" Lestrade, Donovan, and Anderson exclaimed in unison.
"You'll never be able to get proper rest in that."
"You came out here to talk to me!" he exclaimed indignantly, "And if I had something to say, I would have done so. But I have stayed away as requested. I would not want to interrupt the business plans of the great John Watson."
"Don't you see? All of the murders, the suicides, they are all the same. The cause is the same!" His look had become as intense as ever and the space around him seemed to hum.
The manor was enormous and after looking in a few closets, bathrooms, and around the kitchen, he only found some iodine and gauze. He brought back a bowl of clean warm water and towels. Setting them on the floor in front of the fire, he knelt at the wounded man's side and began the process of caring for him. He placed the wet towel over the cuts on Sherlock's arm. The detective once again hissed in pain.
Please, it says, look this way
The End
"Good evening, what can I get for you?" The barkeep asked. He was a tall, average looking man with blond hair swept back from his face. His green eyes told many stories, and his full lips were turned up in a friendly smile. John liked him immediately.
John looked up at him, "Why do you say that?"
"I'm just saying, it's not a place I would want to investigate, much less stay there as a guest," Lestrade said.
Sherlock surged forward, grabbing him by the shoulders, "There's no time, John," the fervor displayed in his face was intense, unyielding, and completely unexpected.
“She has a knack for painting,” my voice was small & contrite, “Don’t know who she gets that from.”
"I'm not a loving person John...except with certain people. And at that, it has only been since...it has only been relatively recent," he sighed, "John, the woman told Lawrence that the only way for him to break the curse was to learn to love, but it was not enough to stop at that. He had to earn someone's love in return," he ran his hands through his hair, "True love."
"So..." John began, shuffling his feet.
Sherlock started back the way they had come and John followed, watching the consulting detective closely as they proceed through the candelabra-lit hallway.
"I will not kill him. I will not kill you, John...I will not...," the weak voice was barely above a whisper, and then those lovely eyes disappeared behind closed lids.
John was being pushed to the breaking point, "It's for your safety you sod! None of this is right. You're not right!" He pushed back.
He pointed through the double doors in front of them. Across the audience, and standing perfectly still in the middle of the stage, was Sherlock. He was dressed in a black suit with a bright red shirt and a white silk tie in a double Windsor. His lapel brandished a glittering silver boutonnière of holly leaves. The berries sparkled red in the center and were only matched for their audacity by the fur-lined Santa hat atop the consulting detective's wily auburn curls. He peered out over the group of expectant patrons. One would think him completely at ease should they be of little consequence to him, but John knew better. His eyes gave his nervousness away and the slight fidget of his fingers along his bow announced his anxiety. The violin that hung at his side reflected the warm stage lighting. It glowed, and though its companion was not yet running along its delicate strings, an intimation of it's lovely sound was minutely audible. Perhaps imagination, perhaps expectation, but as ever the tenor of the envisaged melody brought about a yuletide merriment that made the diminutive room seem abundant and welcoming.
"That's not what I was talking about," John took out his phone, "I've been texting you, calling you. It's not like you to not respond. What's going on? And why are you still here?"
"Yes...just like that...just..."
"Sherlock," he rasped.
"Lock your doors...tomorrow we leave at first light."
Turning, cup of tea in hand, he walked over to the couch and sat down to watch some telly. He flipped through the channels absentmindedly, trying to concentrate on finding a show, but his thoughts went back to Sherlock.
He's fine, he thought to himself, if he doesn't show up, I'll ring Lestrade tomorrow.
Sherlock's face was still that of confusion, and it made John smile even more. For a self-proclaimed genius, he could be very dim witted at times.
Sherlock thought a moment, "I need to further examine the books in the private library."
It was quiet now.
John's hand came to rest over Sherlock's heart. A lump formed in his throat and he once again attempted to fight back tears. He failed miserably and shook with emotional release.
"He was here?" John asked.
"Who?" Sherlock queried.
"A bit warm for December, isn't it?" John commented, looking around and unzipping his coat.
"Sherlock..."
Greg Lestrade jumped down off of the stage and grabbed Mrs. Hudson from the front table, pulling her up on stage despite the handkerchief she held to her teary eyes. She was received by John, who hugged her tightly. Lestrade, a mischievous smile on his face, hopped down once more and ran to the back where Mycroft sat. The stoic man's face barely held a look of surprise, though inwardly he was completely off-guard, as Greg grabbed him and gave a firm tug. Out of his seat he went and tripped about as he was dragged up to the stage. He gave a look of repulsion to the cast, but Sherlock glanced over and, with some feigned annoyance, Mycroft's face softened. He stood with them and actually allowed himself to enjoy the festivity.
"Tell me what?" John questioned.
As if by fate, Anderson chose that moment to show up backstage, "Hello all, is everyone ready for our mystery?" He rubbed his hands together.
John sighed, "...don't do that," he whispered to the warm silence of the room.
The rest of the day passed slowly.
"Gee, we didn't think..." Anderson started, rubbing the back of his neck with shame.
“Then I shall deduce which one will be tolerable.”
John chuckled, "And what was it I was meant to have asked?"
And then the light footfalls were heard through the silence, many of them. Rain soaked leaves swished behind him and soon he heard the growls. He didn't dare look back. He knew they were gaining on him. A large stick lay ahead and he increased his speed, hoping to reach it in time. He ran faster and faster, paying no heed to the strain and drug-induced fatigue in his muscles. At the last moment, he bent down, slid on one foot, and grabbed the branch. Turning over, he came up swinging, hitting the first attacking wolf in the face. There were three others closing in. His hands shook and he swallowed hard. Gripping the stick firmly, he prepared for the onslaught.
"Then do it now, John," came the deep voice mere centimeters from his ear, "Stay. Stay with me, always. Some days it won't come easy, some days it won't come hard. Some days it won't come at all, and these are the days that'll never end," he paused, smiled, and drew closer, "Love me, John, love me, please," the words rolled off his tongue sweetly, "Take me places I've never known...," he breathed.
"Perhaps not," he interrupted. John sucked in his breath and peered at Sherlock with skeptical eyes and pursed lips. Sherlock turned and firmly put the book down on the table, sending others underneath scattering. He opened it and flipped through the pages, coming to one toward the end that depicted a scene that appeared to have taken place just before the wedding night, "This John, it tells the entire story, but ends before the young man was killed."
"Well we certainly have enough ideas on how to create a murder mystery, right?" Lestrade piped up. From all the years he had known Sherlock, he had come to know Mrs. Hudson with fondness. He was excited to help. Not only was it in the service of a friend, but it allowed him an excuse to get out of London. Things with the wife were not especially glorious at the moment. Even though it was almost Christmas, some time apart was what they had settled on.
John gathered his strength and pushed back against the frenetic man. He managed to get him back a few steps before Sherlock responded. He shoved John, causing him to fall backward onto the bed. In an instant, he was on top of him, pinning him down. John fought, but soon settled when he noticed that Sherlock was no longer on the offensive. The rage had subsided and was replaced with something else, something hidden. He lay looking up at the man. Sherlock's curly hair was wild and seemed far longer than before, for it hung forward over his face and neck. He was hunched and breathing hard. His face was intent, but becoming calmer as the seconds passed. It was changing to a look that was rarely seen on the consulting detective's face. It was honest realization and delicious fear. It was the undeniable look of one who would say something, but denies themselves for want of acceptance. Instead, John found that face leaning down toward his own. It brushed against his left cheek and nuzzled the base of his neck. It was confession seen, but not said, And it was here that John found himself wondering why that particular path was always so much easier. His eyes closed, and for a moment he was lost in the sensation, the brutal quarrel all but forgotten. It was then that he came to his own, very private, realization. It was him; it was Sherlock. It was Sherlock, on top of him, putting soft lips to heated skin. His skin, his skin was heated. And it was Sherlock doing it to him. His eyes went wide, his breath hitched, and he could bear the silence no longer.
