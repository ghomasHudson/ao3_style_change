"You know what," Dante said as he stood up. "I don't have to deal with this crap. I'm going in the room!"
"Why not?"
"Ouch," Tony hissed. "On the record, I don't approve."
"Speaking of lies," he said. "What exactly did Freeman say at the press conference yesterday?"
Hopefully, I handled this with as much civility and grace as I possibly could. If not, I'm sorry.
"What's going on?" she asked. "What is all this?"
"You're fine," he assured. "Technically Hill was fine, too. I just need a minute."
Lara walked over to get a look for herself, taking out a random file and flipping through it. Indeed, it appeared to be a series of documents relating to the prior incident.
Steve held out his hand and Tony took it. He helped Tony get out of the car and once he was out, slung Tony's arm back over his shoulder. Happy gave them an odd look up and down.
"The one and only."
"Right," Betty said. "I can call…" She was cut off by the ringing of her cellphone. "Speak of the devil," she muttered as she glanced at the screen. Pulling the device to her ear, she pleasantly greeted whoever was on the other end of the line.
"Just keep me posted." Tony flew down the corridor parallel to the giant snake-turtle-sky-whale. His eyes ran up and down the length of the creature's body, searching for any opening he could spot. "JARVIS, find me a soft spot." As he gave out that order, part of the sky-whale's body collided with the top of a building. The creature seemed unharmed, but the building certainly wasn't. Yup, this wasn't going to be easy.
Rhodey bit his lip, not liking the situation at all. Tony seemed oblivious to the fact that he was being recorded. He glanced in the camera's direction a few times, but never seemed to take notice of it. That alone caused red flags to raise in Rhodey's mind but paired with the fact that Stone appeared to be completely avoiding the camera made nuclear sirens go off as well.
"I may have panicked a little and made things worse." Bruce nodded in understanding.
"No problem," Carol said.
"Unfortunately, no," JARVIS said. "I believe S.H.I.E.L.D. is jamming his cellular phone's signal. I will be unable to inform him of the situation until he either leaves or puts on the Iron Man armor."
Lara couldn't suppress her yawn as she stepped out of the subway. She was dead tired. Only getting two hours of sleep tended to do that to a person. Unfortunately, this time she didn't have PTSD, an addiction to
"Roger that," Steve confirmed. Over the coms, he could hear Tony's repulsors blasting and metal breaking apart. He knew Tony knew what he was doing, but he couldn't help but get concerned.
"So the game plan is just for me to go to Stark Industries and work from there?" she asked.
"Since my best friend nearly got himself killed opening a letter." Clint's expression softened.
"No." Although, yes, he did recognize that Lara did need to apologize for grabbing him, he knew he probably shouldn't force her to do it now. She looked scared when he walked in and probably didn't need to be pushed like that.
That's what he'd told himself. Now, he'd gone and screwed it all up. He couldn't admit it to anyone why he marched out of the party. He could only act like he didn't know and take the punishment. That's what it always came down to.
"Listen," Tony said. "None of you are going to like hearing this, but I'm going to have to go in there and confront Loki by myself for a few minutes."
"We'll wait for Clint to come back and try talking to the concierge again," she said. "If that doesn't work, we'll go back to our original plan. For right now, though I think it would do us all some good if we just take a moment to relax a bit." Steve was very aware of the pointed look she was shooting at him.
"You're not suggesting that someone stole files from S.H.I.E.L.D., are you?"
When Carol walked back into the room, Dr. Smith was already conducting her examination. Fury was nowhere to be found, but Carol figured Smith asked him to keep an eye on Jessica while she checked on Stark. The questions Smith was asking Stark led Carol to believe that she was trying to rule out Irukandji Syndrome once and for all. Given Stark's answers, Carol was sure that he hadn't been affected by the poison at all.
"My sentiments exactly," she remarked. "Is that all, sir? I really need to be getting back if I want to keep my cover intact."
, it sets a bad precedent and not just for taking my shit. Everyone and their mother will think it's okay to just waltz into my home and business whenever they like. I have enough problems with that crap as it is. I
After that, though, the forums became much harder to fill out. The second form started with listing his name, the current date, his date of birth, and the name of his primary care physician. There was also a box to check that asked for permission to share his information with his primary care's office, which Tony checked off just for simplicity's sake. The name of the therapist he was seeing was already filled in along with her phone number – likely done by the receptionist, which Tony was appreciative of. Thanks to that, he was able to skip down to the next question, which was where he hesitated.
reporter was out of line and didn't dwell on the topics she brought up for too long) but he still needed to get out of there as soon as possible. The stress of the entire day was getting to be too much and was only serving to agitate his migraine further. Once he made all the rounds and said hello to everyone, Tony made his speech thanking the guests for coming and then slipped away to his hotel room.
"There's a man here to see you." Lara furrowed her brow. She wasn't expecting anyone to visit her and especially not at work. The only man she could think of that might stop by was her younger brother, but he'd only do that if it was an emergency.
"I won't go anywhere," he said. "I'll stay right here with you and Happy. I promise." Rhodey started to smile again.
just when he finished the last round of updates. "Security breach!"
The entrance to the basement was just off to the side of the kitchen, so Jessica didn't have to go far. She got a glass out of the cabinet and started filling it with tap water. Satisfied with the amount, she took the lid off the vial and dumped its entire contents into the glass. For a second, she thought she heard Salinas' footsteps approaching her and the momentary panic caused her to drop the vial. It shattered into a million pieces at the bottom of the sink.
He was running towards the house. He could see the missiles coming. If he was just a little faster this time maybe he cold gets to them in time to save them, or at the very least, die with them.

"Sleeping pills, Tony? Really?" Tony did not seem to stir one bit at the remark, so Rhodey shook his shoulder. "Tony! Tones, wake up!"
"Well, that's at least good to hear," Cranston said.
." Freeman shrugged.
"Really?" she said. "Well then I'd have to inform you that there is a question as to this woman's identity."
"Sometimes the scariest of monsters wear the most unassuming masks," she said. "They're able to fool everyone; even themselves."
"I'd say that I have a good enough relationship with each of them." He paused for a moment. "Well, Thor's been in Asgard since the incident, so none of us really got the chance to know him too much, but the others, I'd say we're on pretty solid ground."
"Seriously?" Carol nodded. "Shit."
"Why don't we watch that show you like?" Steve asked. "The one with the rude, screaming, cardboard kids."
"Barton's sick," he said. "That we know for sure." He heard her let out what he was sure was a curse in French.
"Hey there, Rhodeybear," he said. "What's up?"
"J'aurais dû t'avorter," Lara said without missing a beat. Tony sucked in a sharp breath through his teeth. Howard might have been a terrible parent, but at least he never said that to him. At least, not outright. Barton, however, seemed to be confused.
"I don't know," he said. "I don't know what I'm doing. I know it needs to stop – the drinking, that is – but I can't…" Tony brought his hand to his forehead and took a deep breath. "I can't decide whether or not I want to make this a permanent thing. Part of me knows that I should do it; that it's the right thing to do. The other part…" He shook his head. "The other part just keeps telling me that I know I'm not that strong."
"Natasha…"
"It is no problem, husband," she said. "You could never keep me waiting."
"That would be great," Coulson replied.
"Oh," Natasha said. "How rude of me to assume."
"How so?" Since Tony had nuzzled his head into the juncture between Steve's shoulder and neck, it was impossible to miss the sound of Steve swallowing hard.
"That doesn't make you invincible, Tony!"
Tony stared at the wall, his back turned on Steve and Fury. It wasn't out of anger. It was more shame. Shame that while they were arguing about something that now just seemed to be completely petty, Loki was able to launch a successful attack on the Hellicarrier. Shame that they had easily fallen into Loki's play. Shame that both Thor and Bruce were now MIA. Shame that Coulson had to die…
"No, the majority won out," Natasha pointed out. "You just have to deal with it."
After being exposed to a biological weapon, Clint, Tony, Steve, and Natasha have been separated and placed into quarantine. Meanwhile, Bruce has reunited with an old friend.
"He's asleep," Fury said. "He's still not showing the same signs as Drew, though, so I think we can say that Dr. Smith is right." Carol nodded.
"Lorraine, this is Vasyl," he said. "I know it's been awhile since I last called but I just got out of prison and I was hoping that I could come over to see the girls.
" Tony made a point of shouting as loud as he could. "I don't give a fuck anymore! You wanna know what the fuck my problem is?"
"Of course," Natasha said. "We'll take this conversation up to our rooms." Hill nodded in agreement to that and the group started heading for the stairs.
"That's good," Steve said as he followed him into the living room. "What's he making."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa," Tony said, cutting him off. "Is this… Are you breaking up with me?"
"Yeah, I wouldn't count on that," he said. "Security probably has them held up inspecting the food, so technically it arrived on time."
"What is there to miss?" Adoniram asked. "After we ascend, there will be nothing left that this Earth can offer us. We will be free to roam the stars as we have always so desperately desired."
Bruce took a step forward, stuck his hands into the glove holes, and peered down the lenses. Once again, he saw the same white grains that he had already spent most of his time staring at. Nothing immediately stuck out to him.
"I sort of get that," he said. "When I did, I don't want to know it's coming. It'd be much easier that way."
Of course, this scene had changes to it. It was kind of obvious given that Tony/Pepper isn't a thing in this universe. Not that I have a problem with the Tony/Pepper pairing - I read fics about them all the time - but I just prefer Steve/Tony a little bit more. That being said, I hope I was able to cut back on the flirtiness between the two of them. As established in MHATRAR, although the two of them quickly failed as a couple, they still remain close friends and I hope that's what comes across here.
"I need a minute to think it over." Hill frowned.
"Tones, what's going on?" he asked. "I got this videotape passed along to me today of you talking to someone in a hotel room. I haven't even watched the whole thing yet and it's already creepy beyond hell. Just call me back to let me know you're alright, because this thing is giving me a bad feeling. …Unless this is a prank, in which case fuck you, but either way, call me back." He then hung up the phone and tossed it down onto the couch behind him. Squeezing his eyes shut, Rhodey scrubbed a hand over his face and began hoping against all hope that this was an elaborate prank of Tony's and not anything truly malicious.
Clint's mind supplied before he could even really think about it. He frowned. Deep down, he knew that was right. However, a small part of him questioned whether it was right or if it was even his own thought. The onslaught of his worst fears didn't follow, so maybe it was. …Or maybe it was planted there. Could anything he thought be his own thought or could it all have been planted there by someone; by Loki. A cold shudder ran down his spine.
"Time to go," Steve said as soon as the door slid open.
"Saturday afternoon," Tony said. "It worked most of the day Sunday, too, but on Monday the headache was back at full-force, only now I had a cold on top of it."
"Read the menu." Knežević gestured to the blackboard behind him that had the drink options listed (beer, light beer, brown tap water) and – in bright neon pink no less – the capitalized statement of
"The MK7 armor is fully functional and ready for use at any time."
"If that's all," he said. "Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Thank you," Steve said. "For all of your help through this." Hill nodded.
"No." Bruce shook his head. "There are other factors to consider as well. For example, I have no idea if I got Dr. Erskine's original formula exactly right. Betty and I tried to decode his notes as best we could, but it used deep levels of encryption. We're talking ciphers on top of ciphers. Not even the best code breakers back in the day could figure it out. It's very much possible that there's something in there we missed."
"They make diabetic ice cream," she said. "At least I think they do."
"And you said one AM?" The man narrowed his eyes at Natasha.
"Eh, why don't we save that idea as an absolute last resort," she said. "And possibly consult Rhodes and Pepper first. I don't think Tony will respond well to that."
"I'm sorry."
So, in Steve's mind, this was just a friend (He only met Tony once, should he consider him a friend?) taking another friend on a nice night out. Nothing else. Even if he did feel
Thank you to doctorherondalestark and the guest for leaving kudos on AO3! It really means a lot! :)
"I hope I'm the man for the job," he said.
"Because it's been three months and you have yet to hire a new one," Pepper explained. "Plus, I believe it's in my contract that I can pick my successor."
"No," she said. "I mean I literally flew into the building less than fifteen minutes ago." Bruce's eyes widened.
"Your mental health." Stark visibly tensed. "Because we both know that's a topic you can't avoid anymore."
Unsure of what else to do, Steve slammed Tony's door shut and got into the seat behind him. The other rear passenger seat was occupied by Conroy, who was still on the phone with the hospital. Things were quiet for almost the entire drive. Tony most likely fell asleep, Steve and Pepper didn't have much to say to each other, and Conroy was too busy telling her small, black device that yes, she'll hold every few minutes. He didn't think anything could be more awkward than the car ride the night before, but apparently he was wrong.
"So, you married a stranger and he attacked you?" Lara shook her head.
"What?" she ground out.
"I know," he sighed. "I don't know why I keep letting it get to me."
The camera panned to show Pepper, Freeman, Cabe, and a few others stepping onto the platform which the podium stood on. They took seats just to the right of the podium while a representative from S.H.I.E.L.D. got behind it. Again, nothing was said that Lara didn't already know, so she took the moment to study the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony felt Steve grab him and try to force him to the ground. In the distance, he could hear something that sounded like an explosion. Then there was another one, much closer. He could feel the heat from the blast and he and Steve were even thrown a few feet themselves. Glass broke. Alarms blared. Smoke filled the air. What on Earth just happened? As soon as the shaking stopped, Tony sat up, his eyes immediately locking on to Steve's.
"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "They could be coming in earlier or later or they could be at the airport at the same time as us. I have no idea. All I know is that they're flying in from a land far, far away."
By the time they got back to the hotel, Tony's mood had not improved. He stormed ahead of Steve after he got out of the car and wouldn't allow him to help him to their room. He only stopped at the door to their room because he forgot he needed the keycard to get in and tried to force the door. Steve stepped in and unlocked it before he could break anything.
"Tried?" Bruce questioned.
Eventually by some luck, she ran into the right person and got pointed in the right direction. She couldn't have felt more relieved. Although she had been able to ignore the wet-stain that had formed on the back of her pants when she was sitting on that snow-covered bench and talking to Bruce, it was completely impossible to do while she ran around the streets of Midtown like a chicken with it's head cut off in nearly sub-zero temperatures. Walking into the coffee shop and feeling the central heat hit her skin was heavenly.
"Holy crap," Bruce said to himself. His eyes went over to the envelope, which was resting on the table next to him. Even from the distance, he was at, he could see that the lipstick stain covered a significant area of the letter's surface. Although the letter was gilded with aluminum foil, the lead lipstick stain would add another layer of protection, ensuring that at least some of the powder wouldn't be affected by the beta rays; that it would remain active.
Except nothing was normal. None of it was normal. What he saw and what he experienced was beyond the realm of comprehension. It wasn't real, yet it was all too real at the same time. He couldn't get it out of his mind; out of his thoughts; out of his being. This was part of who Tony was now and honestly, he didn't think he could accept it. The thought of being like this forever twisted his stomach so much that he thought he was going to vomit.
"Pleasure to meet you." It was clear that she was only saying that to be polite as she extended her hand out for him to shake.
"He's still ashamed about what he did in D.C.," she said. "I don't know what else I can tell you." Steve turned his head down, squeezing his eyes shut in frustration.
"So are you," Steve said, placing a hand on Tony's cheek, stroking his thumb across it. "There's something I need to tell you about, though." Tony tried extremely hard to keep the sinking feeling from settling in his stomach.
"That much is obvious," Betty said. Bruce kind of had to laugh uncomfortably. "But she's your friend?"
"Yeah, I don't buy that," he said. "You don't just get upset over nothing. What is it?" Tony frowned.
"That makes me feel wonderful about myself." Conroy rolled her eyes.
"I don't suppose you have a superhero discount?" The cashier shook his head. "Didn't think so."
"Alright," Lara said in an oddly calm, level-headed voice. "That much is obvious. Where do you think he would hide?"
"Both you and Mr. Stark have one-hundred percent confirmed alibis," Duran said. "You're not considered suspects at this time. You're free to go about your business as usual. I'll be sure to keep you in the loop."
Natasha, as it turned out, did have a car and was more than willing to drive them back to Malibu. Tony was thankful for that as it crossed one less worry out of his mind. However, he had at least a hundred more to worry about, including the man sitting in the front passenger seat. So, instead of using the thirty minutes it took to drive back to his house napping in the back seat as he was supposed to be (Steve insisted), he laid on his back and stared up at the ceiling of the black sedan and tried to ignore how uncomfortable he was and the fact that if they got into a car accident right now, he'd probably be dead. (Although he had to admit Natasha was a safe driver, she kept accidentally drifting into the left lane, which caused a few anxiety attacks, at least on Tony's part.
"Tony Stark." Carol's face remained blank. "
"Well, given that you appear to have a more severe case," Rawls said. "The only other method of treatment would be managing the symptoms, which would be incredibly difficult. Why? Is there a problem?"
Regardless, it was only a momentary distraction. Once he finished typing the message, Tony took a deep breath, resigning himself to the long drag of filling out paperwork. The sooner he got it done, the better.
"If you're so concerned with the company I keep, why didn't you question my relationship with Stane?" Fair clearly did not have anything to say to that. Tony turned his attention to the rest of the board. "That question goes for all of you. Do you have anything to say about that? Anything? No?"
"About you." Laura clarified.
"I'm okay," Tony said. "I mean, I'm not okay, but it's not urgent. You can stay where you are."
"She knows how to deal with
"Shit…" He looked between Lara and Tony. "Listen, I'm sorry for doing that. That wasn't a nice joke. I shouldn't have scared you like that, and I'm sorry if that's what pushed you over the edge." Tony sighed.
"Nothing too concerning," Wylie said. "Just a general feeling of delirium; not being sure of where you are and what's happening around you.
"Listen," he eventually said. "I know this is a hard time for both of us and me being impulsive doesn't help anything…"
"Well, I did it after you told me not to," Clint pointed out.
!?" Panic was creeping into his voice. JARVIS had not mentioned any of that, but then again JARVIS had gotten the information off the internet. He technically could not be blamed for parroting back erroneous information. At least, until Tony worked on making JARVIS' judgement a little better.
"I don't have a private life," Tony explained. "Not really. The press follows me everywhere I go. I wouldn't be surprised if they were waiting outside the building right at this very moment for me to come out just so they could get their headlines and cover photos."
"Yeah, I wouldn't count on that," Happy said. "I just flipped channels to NBC and caught the tail end of a commercial for
"Yes." Tony sighed.
"Hey there, Larissa," he said. "What's up?"
"So S.H.I.E.L.D. is responsible for Stark's reckless behavior?" Hill questioned.
"Hey," he said. "Are you okay?" Slowly, Tony looked up at Steve and was relieved to see nothing but concern and affection in his eyes.
"No," Bruce said. "I haven't left the tower much since the Chitauri attack. In fact, I think the last time was for Coulson's funeral."
Once in the room, Steve was careful to shut the door quietly to avoid waking anyone on the floor below them. Conversely, he could hear Tony behind him in the kitchen loudly opening and slamming cabinets and drawers, rendering the point mute. Steve took a deep, calming breath.
Special thanks to DiveTooDeep for the comment on AO3! It really means a lot!
Okay, that was probably bad considering Barton was fighting for his life against two super-bugs at the same time. That alone made the day horrific in every sense of the word, but the one bright side had been seeing Betty again. Lara was right. He did need some closure on that relationship, and he was glad that he got it.
"Really?" she questioned. "That's your best argument?"
Special thanks to mammal and DiveTooDeep on AO3 for the kudos and comments! It really means a lot! :)
"Did you really think you could fool us?" he asked. "For goodness sake, a traffic cam caught you on video rescuing Stark. It was only a matter of time before we caught up to each other, one way or another."
"How about a goodnight kiss?" The cheekiness of his smile betrayed the thoughtfulness of his voice. Tony laughed.
"You sure about that?" Steve asked. "Because I don't think you should be leaving considering how sick you are."
However, the things that concerned him the most were the outright contradictions contained within the files. The report written by an agent named Natasha Romanoff painted Tony as a self-obsessed narcissist who only fought for himself, but that description was in direct contrast to his actions as Iron Man. After all, it was unlikely that someone as self-centered as Tony supposedly was would want or even care enough to do things like fly halfway around the world to save some random village in Afghanistan or stop a psychopath from killing around six-thousand civilians gathered in an exposition center with weaponized drones and a hacked suit of armor. (Steve didn't fully understand what had happened there, but that wasn't the point.) The two images didn't match up in his head and he was having trouble figuring out which version was the real one.
Again, Marx shook his head.
"I'm going to call Duane," Salinas said. "Why don't you lie back down and relax? Don't worry, I'll tell him to bring Steve." Tony gave him a hard-sidelong glare. Salinas acted like he didn't see it as he walked into the next room, shutting the door behind him.
"Well, my guest and I surely appreciate it." Viv then turned her gaze on Steve and suddenly the flirty smile was back.
"I got home at around five," she said. "Dante was sitting in the living room, watching TV. As soon as I walked in, we got into a fight…" Lara had to shut her eyes and shake her head against the wave of dizziness and nausea that came over her. She wasn't sure if it was from the concussion she'd certainly received when she fell down the stairs, or from the "minor" stomach bug that she thought she got over a few days ago, but it was unbelievably daunting. So much so that the officer took notice.
Slowly, he made his way across the room to the kitchenette. He flipped on the light above the oven, providing some amount of light, but not so much that he would be overwhelmed or hurt his eyes. The parlor attached to the kitchen held no unseen evils either. He could see straight out the large panoramic window that faced H Street and the White House. No danger outside either. Feeling reassured, he put his back against the wall and sunk down to sit on the floor.
"I don't know," Clint said. "I just found him on the street. I didn't get to meet his parents."
"Right," Tony said. "Forgot about that."
"I'm sorry," was all he could think to say. Lara didn't flinch, but she didn't move her gaze away from the fixed point in front of her.
"I don't need exact details," Everhart said. "Just give me a general idea of what was going through your mind when everything happened." Tony looked down and took a deep breath, grounding himself. When he looked back up, he forced the words out of his mouth.
"You are mistaken," Loki said. "The people of Asgard would never allow me back into their realm."
"Sorry," Clint said. "That position's already taken, officially." Lara frowned.
"Well, I don't want her to sue," Tony said. "I just want this gone!"
"Sir, the telephone," he said. "My protocols are being overwritten."
"What was?" Stark asked quietly.
"Speaking." Tony's voice sounded much more rough and tired than Steve remembered. However, he felt reassured by how his tone went up as soon as he heard Steve's voice. Almost as if he was smiling. "Is this Steve Rogers?"
have the right to consult an attorney before answering any questions, nor do you have the right to consult an attorney now or in the future." Loki could feel something tight and metal close around his wrist. He tried to tug at it, but the Widow responded by jabbing her fist into his side. He tried to suppress a groan of pain.
Seven rings…
"Thank you," he said. "For all of this. You didn't have to, but you're right. It's what I needed to hear."
Anyways, if you liked this chapter, feel free to review or comment or whatever it is you want. I'm not picky, but I would appreciate some kind of response! :)
"Good morning," Tony reciprocated as he leaned in to take that quick kiss. He could feel Steve's smile against his lips.
The most common type of radiation used by postal services to prevent biohazardous attacks was ionizing radiation, which detaches electrons from atoms and molecules, thereby rendering any viruses and/or bacteria that could be inside dead. Ionizing radiation could be broken down into four different types; alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, and neutron radiation. Neutron radiation could only be neutralized by using light elements such as hydrogen. Gamma radiation couldn't penetrate anything denser than lead. Beta radiation couldn't penetrate anything denser than aluminum and alpha radiation couldn't penetrate anything denser than paper.
It turned out to be a two-person job anyway. Steve was holding the countertop vertically. It was just a little bit taller than he was, so he couldn't see where he was going. At first, he tried walking backwards towards the door so he could turn and at least attempt to see where he was going, but that didn't really work out. Instead, Tony directed him around the furniture and over to the foyer area slowly, which went a lot more smoothly. Steve set the countertop down on the floor by the elevator carefully as not to cause another crash. Thankfully, he didn't drop it like Tony had and the two of them headed back into the office to move on to the next task.
Rushing into the bathroom, Lara thought she heard someone calling after her, but given that she was about to puke her guts up, she understandably ignored it. She just barely made it to the first sink before she started vomiting and it felt like an eternity before she finally stopped. Her heart was still furiously beating against her ribs and her hands were shaking as she reached for the knob to wash the remnants down the drain. A tear slipped out of her right eye as she forced herself to straighten up. She avoided looking in the mirror. She didn't want to remember how she looked in this moment for the rest of her life. Instead, she kept her gaze on the floor. Ironically, that just put another image in her mind that she would carry with her for all eternity.
"What the hell?" she muttered to herself. "You'd think Tony would have the place wired up with nuclear sirens."
"It's fine," Tony said as he sat up a bit more in the bed. "Thank you for coming." He wrapped his arms around his best friend, who gave him a solid pat on the back.
When they arrived at the station, Lara headed for the basement level as that's where she remembered most of the restaurants being. There was indeed a place that sold ice cream and they did have a diabetic-friendly fare in stock. Unfortunately, the only flavor they could offer her was vanilla; the blandest of all the ice creams. She could deal with it, though. She wasn't
"Deal," she said. "Now get some rest."
"But you can control it," Bruce pointed out.
"I don't know," he admitted. "I'm not really good at the whole forgiveness thing, especially when it's that bad…" Natasha nodded in understanding.
"Sir, it is now six-thirty in the morning," the AI said. "If you want to arrive to work on time, I suggest getting out of bed now." Tony groaned.
"I'm sorry that took so long," Dr. Fox said. "I usually have an entire staff to do this work for me, but I didn't think it would be wise to overwhelm you with people right now."
The opening notes of "Shoot to Thrill" roused Tony from his light dose. He hadn't been able to sleep since Pepper left. Instead, he just laid there with his eyes closed waiting for his head to stop pounding. The pain did ease up a bit but had yet to fully cease. However, the sound of his ringtone playing brought a headache back full-force. Groaning, Tony felt around for the phone on the nightstand.
"No," Steve admitted. "The past few days we haven't really talked at all. I was just focused on getting him through withdrawal and Tony was obviously suffering."
"Thank God," he muttered before standing up. "Get me out of here."
"Probably," Tony said. "And maybe a little misleading with the murder part unless it's supposed to be a murder show?"
"There's nothing to tell," Tony said. "I'm fine."
"Alright," Pepper said, turning to look each of the legal people in the eye. "Is there anything we can do about this?" One of the legal people – a man with salt and pepper hair named Mr. DeMarcus – frowned.
"What about me?" Steve asked. "I'm sick."
"That's breaking and entering," Tony pointed out. "You just confessed. Steve, arrest her." Steve snorted dismissively.
Going back to the waiting area he had occupied before, Tony listened as Steve explained all of what happened over the past few hours and his concerns for Romanoff. Honestly, Tony was left in a little bit of a state of disbelief. The idea of Romanoff losing her cool just seemed impossible. He couldn't even create a clear image of that in his mind. She fought a tantrum-ing Norse God and dealt with aliens invading the streets of New York without barely batting an eye. The idea of her being scared just sounded ludicrous. At least it would be if Steve didn't mention one detail.
"It's my plane," Tony pointed out. "It leaves when I'm ready."
"The Chitauri are coming," he said. "Nothing will change that. What have I to fear?"

"Don't threaten me with a good time." Tony looked over at Steve and smiled to let him know it was just a joke. Lara didn't find it amusing, though, as she lightly hit him on the forearm as he sat down next to her. Natasha, meanwhile, rolled her eyes.
"You're welcome." Bruce continued to hold the door open for her as she passed the rest of the way through its frame. As a result, Lara got to the elevator first and hit the call button. She then turned to give Bruce the confused look again as he came to stand beside her.
On the floor, he found Tony's blazer, socks, and shoes discarded near the tub. Picking up the blazer, Steve felt around in the pockets and found Tony's cell phone and wallet. The wallet still had Tony's cash and credit cards inside, along with his key to the hotel room. That came as a small relief. Without money or shoes, he couldn't have gotten far. Quickly running over a list of hiding places within the suite, Steve was floored when he turned around and saw Lara standing directly in his path.
"But you don't." Natasha's smile disappeared. "You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?"
"Commander Hill already gave me her reasons for making that call," Fury said. "For right now, Captain Rogers needs to rest. It's already bad enough you told him about your father's death and that you're Howard Stark's son. All he needs to do is figure out the math and realize it's been a lot longer than he probably thinks."
"Yeah," she said. "You're probably right."
Steve looked over to where Tony was pointing. He just had to jump up and across one beam two grates to get there. Easy enough. Steve got there quickly and spotted a panel inside of a doorway that appeared to pull out. Doing so, he discovered that it was filled with circuitry and wires. He had a pretty good feeling that this was what he was looking for.
"Yes," Adoniram confirmed. "It is, but please don't say anything to anyone."
"What is it?" Pepper asked.
Steve thought.
"Well, what do you suggest?" Lara asked. "Because I've got nada."
"Stable communities like the ones we had on Aurelia?" Adoniram raised an eyebrow, surprised.
"It's best not to have too many questions." Carol shrugged and put the cap back on her head.
"I don't know but I think it's Indian." A grimace crossed Steve's face.
"What did you do once you decided you wanted to try?" Carol's face scrunched in confusion.
"Will do," she said.
"Oh, God," she said. "I was so out of it yesterday; I don't think I can remember."
"I'll show you how." Steve could hear the smile in her tone. Even in these circumstances, she could still smile. He could feel his fear ease a tiny bit as he took comfort in that fact. He hoped she'd still be able to smile afterward, too. "Just be there."
"Understandable," he said. "So where's the phone book?"
"Why would I be?" Steve said. "I mean, I'm sorry that happened to you and I want nothing more than do punch out the guy who did that to you…"
Shakily, he put his glass back down on the table and hoped no one noticed how bad his hands were twitching.
"I'm sorry," she said. "That probably wasn't my place…"
"I just want to see what food they have up at the back table," she lied. "It's going to be a bit before the main course is served, right?"
"See you tomorrow," Tony called back.
"Are you done with the overt obstinance yet?" she asked.
Natasha shook her head and put all the sincerity she could into her voice as she said, "no. It was entirely about your wellbeing."
"How many of them are red?"
"You don't want to know." Tony looked down, frowning.
"We made several reports to IT about it," she said. "But there seems to be failure in communications going on. I sent an inquiry about the reports today and according to the Head of IT, they never received any such reports and seem to have as much a clue about what's going on as I do."
"Word is you can find the Cube," Steve said.
"How did he react?"
"That's assuming this is a bio-weapon," Bruce said, backing up. "This still could be something else."
"You heard me. Do it." The scientists exchanged stunned looks with each other.
"I confronted Tony about his alcoholism," she finally said. "I know, not the right time or place, but I could tell that he was making people uncomfortable and figured that I should probably get him out of the public eye as soon as possible."
am not sure what I'm supposed to do here."
The hug didn't last long for previously stated reasons, but Tony made sure to savor every second. Steve pulled back slowly and gently, giving Tony's bicep a rup.
"Listen," she said. "I'm sorry that all of this happened. I thought I made sure to lock the door when we left earlier, but I must have messed up somehow."
"Just get me out of here." Jessica nodded and led him down the hall.
"I'm here." Her voice came in through the static of the plane's radio.
"It's a surprise," was the best he could come up with. Natasha clearly looked skeptical but was not willing to push, so she let that point go.
Steve sighed. Again, he had to realize that he was talking to a brick wall. As much as he wanted to help Tony, he couldn't do it while he was this drunk. He'd try this again in the morning. For right now, all he could do was get Tony back to the hotel.
They spent the rest of their time on the phone laughing and discussing things in general. Tony wasn't sure where this was leading to – be it friendship or something more – but he did know one thing already; he was never going to regret meeting Steve Rogers, and he hoped Steve felt the same way about him.
"Yes," the concierge said. "But only one."
Picking up the envelope, Betty turned it vertically so that the ripped side was facing down and began to shake it. A large amount of powder immediately came spilling out. She shook it a few more times and a folded-up piece of stationary came tumbling out. Both Bruce and Betty looked at it in surprise before the shocks wore off and Betty started to unfold it.
"Alright," Fury said. "What would you like to know?"
"Yeah," he said. "We're going to get sick from this, aren't we?"
"Public healthcare," Bruce responded.
"Casse couille."
"Hey," he said. "I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure should have killed you."
"Yeah," Steve said. "I just can't believe it. All my life I heard it was a disease and now…"
"Uh, a little help?" She swerved to dodge another blast and increased her speed. Loki was getting way too close for her liking.
"Tony's sick," Pepper explained. "Can you call the hospital and give them a head's up that we're coming?"
Yeah, Lara didn't buy that for a second. No waitress could afford to live in New York City on that salary alone. Even if they were in Queens, it still seemed highly unprobeable. It was either that, or her husband had something else he wasn't telling her. Either way, Lara was none too pleased.
Honestly, couldn't explain because she was only just realizing how badly she messed up. She had forgotten that as far as the United States government was concerned, Carol Danvers was dead. She never bothered to get the declaration of her death reversed. It never really mattered because she was rarely on Earth. Well, now it mattered.
"For the most part, we've managed to break up the protest and bring most of the people involved into custody," the cop said. "However, other than that one guy who violated a restraining order, we can't charge anyone with anything worse than criminal trespass."
"No, I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't have access to a phone until a few minutes ago."
"I know, but…"
"Noted," Conroy said dutifully. "Also, like I said before, you look like literal death. I'm not joking. You seriously look like you're going to keel over and die right here, right now."
"Deploy!" Tony called out before being thrown through the glass wall behind him.
"Alright," Thanos finally said. "I'll consider it." Loki let out a breath that he didn't know he'd been holding. "But first you're going to have to prove something to me." Loki swallowed hard.
"She doesn't like being called that," Coulson said. "And it's not fieldwork. She's just doing a favor for a friend. At least, that's how she's justifying it to herself."
"It's nothing serious," Natasha assured. "But I still need to talk to you about it."
"Two," Lara corrected. "I know that's your second glass."
"Just hit the call button on the remote," the doctor instructed. "A nurse will be right in with a bed pan." A look of disgust crossed Clint's face.
Cat: *meows sadly*
"Alright then," Freeman said. "I'll just take note of that."
"And what would you consider a threat, Mr. Stark?" It didn't surprise Tony how quickly she had gone off-script, but the question was relevant to the topic at hand, so he figured he could let it slide.

Slowly but surely, Loki started to peel open his eyes. He was greeted with the sight of stars, but not the stars he was familiar with. It looked as though he was in an entirely different corner of the galaxy than where Asgard's little pocket universe existed. He tried to spot the constellations his mother and "father" had taught him and Thor to look for as children in case they had ever became lost in the forests surrounding Asgard. He couldn't find one of them. He scanned the sky for something, anything familiar, but found nothing.
As she picked up the popcorn, Lara kept glancing at the TV. Every time she looked up, she hoped the closed captions would reveal something new, but she found that the reporter was just babbling on, repeating the same three bits of information she already knew. It was par for the course for broadcast news, but the captions just made it far more grating. The only thing that changed was that after about thirty minutes, the station was finally able to bring images from the scene via their "Sky Eye Traffic-Copter." As far as Lara could tell, the explosion hadn't happened too close by. The site appeared to be by the water, while her building was more in the center of Hell's Kitchen. That came as some relief, but she still scrutinized every breath she took carefully, on high alert for even the slightest whiff of gas.
"Natasha?" he said. Whatever he was playing at, she didn't want to find out. She hit him hard across the temple, causing him to collapse to the floor, unconscious.
"They're vintage," Natasha said. "He's very proud." Steve, didn't know how to respond to that, but luckily this time he caught sight of another familiar face in the crowd of S.H.I.E.L.D. airmen and agents. Albeit, one that he hadn't met before.
Eventually, though, Laura must have needed to put the phone down, leaving Clint with nothing to do. He let out a bit of a groan as he stretched out on the couch – which the concierge didn't seem to appreciate, either. He sat there silently for a few moments and Natasha counted down the seconds in her head until he inevitably bothered her.
She thought as she staggered out of bed and into the living room. When she reached the doorway, she froze, having noticed the strange Asian man asleep on her couch. She panicked for a second before realizing she still had all the clothes on that she had been wearing the night before and her guest was fully clothed as well. At least she could scratch "awkward breakfast with a one-night stand" off her list of potential worries.
came to mind, along with
"Shh…" Knežević hushed. "Don't worry. You're Aunt Lorraine is fine. She's in a better place."
"Hello?" she said.
"Oh, please," she said. "Those are weak insults compared to what I've heard from my mother."
When she walked into what was supposed to be the living room, Pepper had her back to her and her hands on her hips. Tony was facing her but was too focused on Pepper to notice that she had stepped into the room. Steve, meanwhile, was tuning them out completely. He was sitting in a chair that looked like it had been brought up from one of the offices and completely focused on whatever he was drawing in his sketchbook. Lara quietly looked for a spot to put down her coat and bag.
Bruce saw Betty hang up her phone and rushed over to her.
"Really?" Peggy said. "Not even Miss Sharon? She hasn't gotten to see her cousin Tony all night."
Pulling out her phone, Lara sent one last text to Tony before shutting it off.
Tony bumped against the glass a bit as he tried to push open the glass door separating the foyer from the hallway open. Trying to push the bar down, he found that it had give, but he couldn't open it. The door was locked.
"Finally," Lara said. "Are you listening now?"
Knowing that she needed to inform Tony of this ASAP, Lara pulled her phone out of her back pocket and began texting as fast as she could.
"If you say something or mess up in a pre-taped interview, we can ask the producers to edit it out and not use it," Lara explained. "Not as much pressure as there would be doing it live."
"Well, I wouldn't exactly call the air fresh," Tony said. "But I guess you can't be too picky when you haven't been outside in… Well, it's good to be outside, right?"
"A bit." Glancing to his right, Tony saw that Rhodey had picked the pen up off the floor. Leaning forward, Tony took the item back from his friend with a soft "thank you" before relaxing into the cushions again. At the same time, he slipped his left hand into Steve's right.
"The worst thing I've done was destroy Harlem," he said. "The public already knows about that, so it's not really like I have anything to hide." Freeman nodded.
Adoniram had been introduced to Maurita Sharpton by his close personal advisor, Congressman Eduardo Salinas. Sharpton was deeply mourning the loss of her daughter during the Battle of New York, so she was easily corrupted and converted into a member of the Peoples Unity Church. Adoniram considered such a conversion a win, especially considering her high position within the Roxxon Corporation's conglomeration. Not only did it give them access to Roxxon's assets, but it also added to their clout.
"I guess it's okay," Steve said. "At least the burger is actual beef." Tony wanted to question that remark but stopped himself. Just for the sake of keeping his breakfast down, he knew he probably shouldn't.
"What do you think you hired me for?"
"Winghead?" Steve questioned.
"You know, whatever you're upset about couldn't have been that bad," Peggy said. "Especially since no one even knows what it was. Not even your father could tell me why you were upset, and he was in the room when you stormed out."
"So, you and Betty are getting along good?" Bruce asked.
Tony's thought process was cut off by Steve's lips crashing into his again. God damn, he didn't know what had gotten into Steve, but Tony had to admit he liked it and this kiss had to be even better than the last one. Steve was an excellent kisser, but this time Tony got to be even more of an active participant. It was invigorating, the heat that swirled between them with each passing second and when they broke apart, neither one of them could wipe the ridiculous smiles off their faces.
"Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?" Fury asked. At the same time, one of the scientists announced that the energy levels were starting to spike again. Clint watched as everyone rushed to their respective screens.
"What about Lucky?" he asked. "Is that a good name?" Clint raised his eyebrows.
"Holy shit." Clint couldn't imagine not telling Laura something like that – barring circumstances out of his control. It sounded like absolute lunacy. "That's terrible."
much easier.
Oswin nodded in understanding. Knežević ran at top speed towards the nearest fence and climbed over it. Oswin followed closely behind.
Remember kids, we live in troubled times. Stay safe!
"No, it's fine," Bruce said. "Just give me a minute to get dressed. I'll help you look."
"A walk in the park," Lara scoffed.
The idea caused Tony's stomach to flip and churn in ways he never thought possible. The shaking sensation started taking over his body once again, and his chest felt like someone was trying to stab a hole in his heart with a dull pencil. Steve took notice right away and sat up a bit more, gently placing his empty hand over Tony's heart, like he was trying to make sure it was still beating.
"That would've been fine," Steve tried to say, but he couldn't get around the end of Tony's sentence."
"Excuse me?"
"Alright," he relented. "But you're not leaving my side the entire time."
"Sure thing." Right away, she got to work, pulling out her phone and turning to the correct page in the planner.
"Bruce?" Betty's voice reminded him of where he was. He gripped the back of a chair, looked down, and started taking deep breaths. Thinking only of the danger he'd be putting Betty and everyone else in this S.H.I.E.L.D. base in by Hulking-out, Bruce managed to get himself into a mostly calm state. When he felt okay enough to function, he turned around and looked back to Betty.
"Hush." Tony frowned, but Pepper continued non-pulsed. "I could order some stuff, and have it set up while you guys are gone."
Steve finally took his eyes away from Tony and gazed at all the sights around him. Yes, things were very different from what he remembered. The buildings were bigger, the air was murkier, and he was right in assuming the style hand changed. Men were wearing t-shirts and jeans, and women had on tank-tops and shorts so short they were probably better classified as underwear. In comparison, he and Tony looked extremely overdressed, but that wasn't the point, though.
He didn't go back to sleep, though. While Steve drifted off with seeming ease, Tony was left wide awake and alone. He'd groan in exasperation, but Steve was still asleep next to him and he didn't want to wake him up. He already felt horrible enough for waking him up once. He didn't need Steve to be up all night as well. Speaking of which, he should probably take care of that before he did end up staying up the entire night.
Remember kids, always stick around for the post-credits scenes.
The person was talking to someone off-screen, but from the angle the camera was at, Rhodey could see the person's face, let alone attempt to read lips. The only thing that made it clear that there were two people there were the two distinctive – albeit distorted – voices exchanging words. What they said couldn't possibly be made out, but that wasn't what Rhodey was trying to do. He was listening to see if he could hear any recognizable qualities to the man on-screen's voice. However, the audio was messed up completely beyond all recognition and thus he couldn't hear anything definitive; just two voices talking back and forth.
Steve's response, however, didn't do anything to help him rid himself of dirty thoughts.
"You needed to know you were not alone." Tony shook his head.
"Last night," Tony snarked back. "The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?"
of a lock following it. Another door then opened and there was a
"I didn't sleep well last night," was the best explanation he could give. Lara nodded in agreement.
"There's a camera pointed at the front doors, right?" The concierge raised an eyebrow at Natasha's question.
"We're talking," she tried to laugh off. "Doing an interview?"
"Chemical production?" It took a second, but it all came back to her. "Oh, this is about that job you want me to do. I'm sorry. Had a bit too much to drink last night."
"What?" Again, Lara held her phone out. Steve, Tony, and Bruce (who had just finished securing the carry-on bags in the overhead bins) leaned in to get a closer look.
"And frankly I'm not going to tell you," Natasha said.
Bruce nodded and shut the door. Lara and Steve turned around and walked across the hall to Clint's door. Lara reached out to knock again.
"I'm not lying!" Oswin looked up at him with eyes filled with tears and fury.
Today's a day where I really wish I could be with my family. Well, the ones I like anyway...
"Just water," he said. "Nothing else." A look of concern came over Happy's face.
"So, what are you going to do?" Steve questioned. "Kill him?"
With that, he sucked it up and began to climb.
Tony then took his drink and headed down to the lab. It was six AM and he had only three hours before his flight. He told Conroy to show up at eight o'clock, sharp, so he'd quickly verse her in how to politely tell anyone who called for him that he was unavailable and where she should say the caller should stick it if they ignored her and still demanded to speak to him. If whatever it was they were calling about was truly that important, he'd be hearing about it from Pepper on his personal cell long before anyone else at the company thought to call him on his business line. Also, S.H.I.E.L.D. seemed to have his personal cell number, so once again he'd be most likely called on that if some world-ending emergency took place. …Oh, he'd just see it on TV. Whatever came first.
"What did I do to earn that?" Pepper's eyes went wide.
"Except for the part where she spied on me." Pepper was non-pulsed.
"Steve, what did I say?" Steve sighed.
"They've been protesting in the lobby since just after the press conference," Cabe said. "They've been sitting out there and have been refusing to move." Tony let out a sigh of exasperation.
Originally posted to FFN on 10/19/19.
"I don't want you to get hurt in any way," Steve said. "Even in ways I can't imagine." Tony smiled a bit at that.
"I wasn't planning to go anywhere anyway," Tony felt the need to point out.
"A few things," Bruce said. "Although, she's not an expert in any science, she does seem interested whenever I talk about it. Like really interested. She asks follow-up questions and doesn't dismiss everything I say as non-sense. So, I feel like I can talk to her about that, and some other things. I get the sense that she didn't have the greatest childhood growing up either…"
Yay! They made up, and just in time, too! I hope you all are enjoying this story! Please don't be shy to leave a comment or a review!
"Captain Rogers' condition is stable," he said. "All of his vitals are in the ranges we expected for his enhanced physiology. His blood pressure was a little higher than I expected, but all things considered, I'm sure he'll easily make it through the night."
"No," she said. "They were still looking into it when we left. They're probably not going to know more until they get them back to the Triskelion."
"All of them?" Salinas questioned.
"No," he said. "Not yet."
"No," Rhodes said. "Do you know?"
"Please tell me it hasn't destroyed anything yet." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. He could already feel the headache coming on.
"You okay?" Again, Tony forced himself to nod.
"Alright," Lara said. "Who is she?"
"I thank you for hosting me in your presence, Brother Daniel," Freeman said.
Vartalek kedvesem templomi imával…"
that, but he was willing to give Tony the benefit of the doubt. "Even so, mixing substances like that was unbelievably reckless and stupid, even for you." Tony shrugged.
"Your mother's birthday." A fond smile came over Betty's face as she flipped her hand around to look at the ring herself.
Despite that, Tony couldn't stop thinking about that one video. So, what would be the best way to take his mind off it? If you answered, "by obsessing over another video," then you've won the grand prize!
"Thanks, JARVIS," she said.
"You know what," Pepper said. "I could work with this."
They gathered in Central Park, the only spot in the city clear enough for Thor and Loki to use the Tesseract to get back to Asgard. The park had been evacuated along with the rest of Manhattan and no one had been allowed back inside yet – other than them. It was strange, seeing the park so empty, so dead. Streets that were normally awash with people were suddenly still. It was really an eerie and unsettling sight to see.
"In the top drawer of the cabinet behind you, sir." The first thing Tony did once Steve got on the plane was to introduce JARVIS to him. He had explained that the disembodied voice was an AI (artificial intelligence) that he created himself. You could ask JARVIS almost anything and the AI would respond within a few seconds. The concept both amazed and terrified Steve at the same time; amazed because he couldn't believe that Tony had created something so complex and sophisticated as a computer that could think on its own, terrifying because he couldn't believe that technology had advanced to a point where people could create intelligent life out of thin air. He could only imagine what horrible things someone could do with that. Luckily, Tony had probably anticipated a reaction like that and decided to introduce JARVIS to him ASAP before the AI scared him half to death. Steve couldn't be more thankful for that at least.
"I take that to mean that you didn't catch my interview on
Tony hesitated. He couldn't imagine any conversation with them going well, particularly with Lara and Romanoff. While Romanoff had already apologized, Tony was worried that she could still be holding a grudge. As for Lara, Romanoff had told him that she wanted to apologize, but given how scared she looked the day before, he found it hard to believe. He bit his lip.
"I have no doubts about that." Adoniram then stood up from his chair, put a hand on Freeman's shoulder, and started leading him to the door. "Now, if Sister Grace gives you any trouble, just tell her that she can come and speak to me personally. I'll make sure everything gets sorted out."
"How have you been handling everything that's been going on with Tony lately? Be honest." Steve had to take a deep breath before answering.
Tony's mind was taken away from his Steve-related worries as he heard JARVIS' voice come over the exterior speakers as pieces of the suit continued to be removed from him as he walked inside.
"Well, I just wanted to introduce myself," Salinas said. "I don't want to take up much of your time. Besides, I'm certain we'll have plenty of time to get to know each other in the coming months, especially when you join the cause." Immediately, Romanoff frowned, and her eyes narrowed.
"Besides," he continued. "Who's to say it was anthrax? That powder could have been anything; ricin, plague, smallpox, SARS…"
Although Loki had been a servant of Thanos for… He couldn't even remember how long now, but he had only been in the Titan's presence only twice. Once, when the Other first discovered him, and the second time only a few Earth days ago when he was sent off to conquer the planet. The Other had been the one to handle his "integration" into Thanos' band of genocidal murderers. Integration probably wasn't the proper word, though. He was kept isolated. The only person he saw other than the Other was a woman with green skin who wordlessly brought him something to eat a few times. Otherwise, there was no one. However, he couldn't think of a kinder word for what he went through, so he was going to stick with integration.
"Take a look for yourself," she urged.
"My life is completely ruined."
"That they're not going to leave you alone."
"We're here to escort Captain Danvers to a safe location." Amanda raised an eyebrow.
"Why are you telling me this?" Stark asked. "Why does it matter to you?"
"I'll see you at dinner." Natasha nodded in agreement.
"Make it so," Adoniram said, clapping his hands over one of Salinas'. "Now, I must urge you to take your place for the service. We are going to begin soon."
"I'm afraid we don't have time for that," Tony said. "Loki's going to open up that portal at any minute now and we all need to be ready to act in an instant. Now if you excuse me, I have a suit to fix."
"No," Tony said. "I'm not going to give you those files. I know what that is and I'm telling you no."
"Unbelievable," she muttered to herself.
He wasn't deflecting again, was he? Well, technically that required him to be in a conversation with another person… Could you deflect something from yourself?
"Why didn't you ask us for help?" Natasha asked. "You know we would have."
"Nothing, nothing," she assured. "Just… I don't know, the stammering is just kind of cute. You must've really loved her, or still love her." Bruce blinked. He knew that it wasn't Betty that was making him so tongue-tied.
Ever the optimist, Bruce found himself hoping that it was active and what was infecting Barton. At least then they would have some idea of what they were dealing with and how to try to treat him. In this game, a shot in the dark could easily kill Barton.
"Alright," she said. "Deal, but this better not take longer than it has to."
the powerline running directly from the arc reactor), Tony's mind started drifting to Steve again. He knew Steve probably knew that he was going to try to go in for a kiss. After all, he might be from the sexually repressed 40's, but he wasn't stupid. Even though neither of them said anything about it the next morning, Tony knew they couldn't put off that conversation forever. No, they had to talk about it at some point and avoiding Steve was only delaying the inevitable.
"I still don't think that's a good idea," she said.
"I will," Tony promised. "You have my word." Carol smiled.
"The hatch is fixed," the agent said as he walked by. "Let's get this show on the road." The agent took a seat next to Natasha and the two of them started flipping switches and pressing buttons left and right.
"Hardly," Steve agreed before looking down at their joined hands. He ran his thumb over the back of Tony's, carefully contemplating his words. "I just want you to know that I still want you, even if these hang ups hold me back forever."
"Have entered the building," Tony finished. "I already know. Is Conroy okay? The last text she sent said she couldn't get out."
"Do you want me to shut the door?" Tony nodded and looked back down at Sharon as Peggy went to shut the door. She was currently banging her fist against Tony's shoulder. He wouldn't admit it, but it felt like she was getting stronger with each small punch and it might have started to kind of hurt. She only stopped when Peggy sat down next to him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Now, can you please tell me what's wrong?"
claims and he wasn't holding Steve
Unfolding it, she quickly found it to be a pair of underwear. Women's underwear to be specific. The kinda professional stripper or someone a little bit more illegal than a stripper would wear. Although Lara herself sometimes liked to wear a little more risqué undergarments, she knew for a fact that these weren't hers.
"Now," Adoniram said. "Where did we leave off?"
"No."
"How?" Steve looked down.
"Slow down." Reluctantly, Lara slowed her pace a bit, allowing Bruce to catch up. He still had to run, though. "What happened?"
"Oh, that's too bad," Clint said. "Uh, you guys can head down to breakfast. I'll be down in a few minutes."

"I'm sorry." Tony reached out and put a hand on top of his.
? I don't think so."
"Oh my," she said. "How exciting! Hold on while I put in a call to Brother Ryan."
"What about the others?"
After sending that message, Clint got up and went across the room to get his laptop. Technically, he wasn't supposed to be getting out of bed, but he figured five feet to his desk and back wouldn't kill him. His sudden movement caught the attention of the puppy, who immediately ran over to him, crying for pets. Clint picked him up and set him back down on the bed while he went and got his laptop. That way the dog wouldn't be begging through the entirety of his call with Laura.
"I just said, it depends…"
"I don't suppose there's anything I can say to make you feel better?" he asked.
"That still does not excuse the blasphemy," Adoniram said, his voice still booming.
"Hopefully," Laura agreed.
"Right," Salinas said. "I'll get on it right away." He then turned and started walking towards the door.
Sliding out from inside the cool surface of the rock box, Knežević got up and surveyed his surroundings. He was just outside of Topanga State Park. If he continued down the Pacific Coast Highway going south, he'd come to a set of public restrooms he could wash up in and eventually a Taco Bell a few miles down the road whose dumpster he could raid. He doubted the bar he was working at before would take him back, given that he missed six days of work. No matter how shady that place may be, they'd still probably refuse to let him continue to work there. They probably thought he called the cops on them or something by now and abandoned the place. That would be the smart move.
"That's awesome!" she exclaimed. "Thank you!"
"He's not," Fury said. "I sent Commander Hill to the hotel to inform him and the other Avengers of the situation. He should still be there."
"Nope," Tony said, popping the "p." "I have my phone, which means I have JARVIS, WI-FI, and access to my personal database. That's all I really need."
"No offense," Bruce said. "But I don't think you'll be able to understand this without a heavy crash course in nuclear decay and the Laws of Conservation."
"It's okay," Steve tried to argue. "I can make you breakfast, then go back to bed." Tony shook his head, adjusting his position to better straddle Steve over the covers.
"Safe," she assured. "The Calvary has the situation under control." Clint's face filled with relief.
Remember kids, Second Christmas is Best Christmas!
"Under the coffee table, but I think this…" Oswin went across the room to fetch her laptop off the dining table. "Would be a lot faster." The man stared at the small machine as she held it out to him.
Clint woke up the next morning (really afternoon, but he hadn't bothered to look at a clock) he found that everything had been cleaned up and everyone was gone. The only evidence that other people had been in the room were the extra blankets spread across him that he didn't recognize and a note from Natasha sitting on his nightstand. She let him know that she would be by in the morning to take the dog for a walk and asked him to text her when he woke up so she could get him breakfast. However, Clint had no intention of doing that. Instead, he got on the phone and started texting someone else.
"That's nothing," he said. "Don't worry about that, but really, is there anything you want?"
"I don't know," Steve eventually gave up. "I can't think of anything that both of us would understand."
"Brother Duane?" Adoniram questioned. "I'm sorry, but he's escaping my recollection. Would you mind reminding me?"
Hopefully, I did all of this therapy stuff justice. I haven't been having a good time in therapy as of late (mostly because my therapist just wants to read me "inspirational" stories rather than, you know, actually discuss anything) so I hope my frustration and derision with the topic didn't come across. Honestly, I do believe therapy is helpful and a good resource for people who are struggling, I'm just having a problem with MY therapist at the moment. If you have mental health problems and have the means to seek help (because in the US they really make you jump through hoops just to see someone) I highly suggest you do so.
I'm an American by the way, in case that wasn't clear. I don't have the most understandable sense of humor...
"I'm sorry," she laughingly scoffed. "Since when did you get permission to speak to me, Mr. Stark, or anyone else that way?"
"That, ma'am," he said. "Is more proof to me that you should have never taken my daughters away from me." She was dead before she could give her response.
Happy first day of October, and a very happy birthday to Brie Larson! I hope she's enjoying it with the people she cares about.
"Of course, I'll be alright," he said. "I do this all the time."
"On what?" Natasha snapped.
Tony took a moment to relish in it. Although it did not mean his fear of falling asleep was cured, but it did feel nice to want to fall asleep for once. After a while, he could feel himself starting to drift off…
With a flick of her hand, Carol sent the hologram away and went back to removing Stark's shirt. She figured she shouldn't be violating his privacy and could ask him about it when he was awake and coherent. Besides, it was a much more urgent matter to his health that she gets the wet clothes off him now. Otherwise, the rest of his body might end up looking like his toes.
"I can see that." Tony shook his hands as if that would do anything to get rid of the stone. Obviously, that didn't work. Realizing he had no choice but to face Knežević hand-to-hand, he muttered another curse to himself and began to chase after Knežević again. His chest hurt, he felt overly hot, and he was having trouble breathing, but he tried to ignore it as he powered through.
"Thanks," Tony said. "Seriously, though, let go."
"Never," Tony said before becoming slightly concerned. "Wait, why are you here if you're sick?"
"And we all lived happily ever after, the end." The sarcasm was practically dripping from Stark's mouth. "You never tried to screw me over and we can wrap this up by joining hand and singing a round of 'Kumbaya.'" Natasha raised an eyebrow.
"It's a possible complication of severe hypothermia," Wylie explained. "I wouldn't worry about it too much." Steve nodded, but was still concerned. "But no other symptoms, right? No dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, cardiac arrest, confusion, none of that?"
"Alright," he said once he calmed down enough. "What kind of lock is it?
he thought.
"You're smart," Bruce said. "Skilled. Capable. I could see why Tony would pick you."
"Don't know," she said. "Don't care as long as it's far, far away."
The emergency shower area was large and spacious with five or six rows of showers and about twenty showers in each row. It was meant to accommodate an entire laboratory worth of people, but right now it was only catering to four. As such, the exposed Avengers decided to stay in the same row, though the men kept a respectful distance from Natasha's stall for chivalry's sake.
"Chicken and penne pasta with a cheese and vegetable topping," Tony explained. "It's not spicy at all. I think you'll like it." Steve wasn't so sure about that, especially since Tony hadn't elaborated on the term "Spinnocoli," but he figured he could at least give it a shot. If he didn't like it, he didn't like it. No big deal.
Tony swallowed hard. Surprisingly enough, it was easy to put down "alcoholism" in the blank space provided, but that left two spaces empty. He felt like he should add something else to the list, but what exactly eluded him.
"Oh, yes," Betty confirmed.
Dr. Cranston let out a snort and Tony narrowed his eyes at her.
"Really? We're resorting to that level of inane childishness?"
"The blood test results came back," Betty said. "Three came back negative, one tested positive for Ebola and H5N1." Bruce swallowed hard.
"No ma'am," Natasha said. "Stark is responsible for his own behavior. We as his teammates and employee are responsible for not responding correctly to his behavior and not keeping a close enough eye on him when we knew he was intoxicated. I'm just curious as to why S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't intervened when they knew this could be an issue for a while, and especially when they were directly involved in an incident that traumatized him and quite probably made his mental health worse."
"Dante didn't show up to court," Lara said. "That's how I was able to get everything approved so easily; no one was there to challenge the accusations."
"Yeah," Natasha said, but the hoarse edge to her voice indicated otherwise. "It's gonna be fun." Her idea of "fun" was very similar to Tony's idea of a "party." With a nod, Natasha started running forward and leaped up on a car while Steve crouched down with the shield high above his head for Natasha to use as a springboard. As soon as her feet hit the vibranium, Steve surged upwards and tossed Natasha in the air. She then grabbed ahold of the back of a passing hoverbike and held on for dear life.
"Yes," Lara agreed.
Tony got up from the couch and rubbed his eyes. His head felt much better, but he didn't think the Anacin had anything to do with it. The massive amount of sleep he had gotten in the past twenty-four hours probably had more to do with it than anything else. He supposed he should be embarrassed – most people who were willingly invited to a super-secret spy base not under the pretext of torture probably didn't spend most of their time there catching up on beauty sleep – but he knew that everyone in that room had probably seen him naked at least once before thanks to that magical thing called the Internet, so really, compared to that taking a nap on an international spy agency's couch wasn't that embarrassing in the grand scheme of things. Although, his neck had a weird crick in it.
"It's not that simple," he said.
"I don't like liars," Natasha said. "You can call me a 'murderous bitch' until you're blue in the face but waste my time by lying to me and we're going to have a problem."
It wasn't until around seven-thirty that he finally saw headlights pulling into the driveway. Unsure of who it was, Knežević hid behind the couch. If it was Audrey and Stephanie, then it'd be a nice surprise for them. If it was anyone else, he'd have a nice surprise for them.
"Alright. Is there any other way you can communicate other than this?"
Before Carol could finish the story, though, Captain Rogers had returned with a man who was introduced as Col. James Rhodes. Everyone got caught up in greeting the newcomer, much to Carol's simultaneous relief and chagrin. As thankful as she was for the distraction, she wanted to finish the story right then and there. After all, who knew what changes and contradictions her mind would come up with between then and when they got back to it. Regardless, Carol allowed everyone to chat and catch up with their friend and followed the crowd into the kitchen when the conversation started drifting towards what to eat. Even at that point, Lucky had abandoned her to go back to his owner. It made her feel quite alone, and honestly that is what she was; alone in a sea of strangers who probably thought of her as their enemy. That was still a feeling she could bear, though, as it was how she felt most of the time, anyway.
"I almost hate how observant you are," he remarked.
"No, I…" Tony paused for a moment. "I don't think that's right…"
"Shouldn't they be here by now?" Natasha marked the page she was on and set the book down to rest on her stomach.
building in the middle of the night and tried to break in under the guise of being a reporter." Carol begrudgingly sighed, realizing that he had a point.
Thank you to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN! It means a lot!
Knežević tuned his attention back to the girl sitting at the end of the bar, who at this point had ceased her hysterical laughter and went back to nursing her beer.
"How am I supposed to know? I've never been there before." Oswin let out an aggravated groan. "Just look at the map. Is there anything marked 'chemical lab?' Maybe 'chemical engineering?'"
"What," he snapped. "Did you stop for drive-thru?"
"What?" He punched his access code into the door again and sprinted into the lab. Steve just barely managed to catch the door before it closed and followed Tony inside. "JARVIS put the results up on-screen." The holographic screen above his desk lit up, presenting the image of a police memo.
"Stark," Fury said. "Do you have the files?"
"Alright." Tony dropped it and the two of them stood there for a prolonged period of silence until a crew member began counting down the number of seconds until the press conference began.
"It won't be forever," he said. "I won't let it."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said as he stood up. "Or it could completely blow up in my face."
"What happened? Do you think you're calm enough to explain it?" Lara nodded and started walking towards a bench lined up against the wall. Bruce followed her. Sitting down and taking a deep breath, Lara figured out how she would explain it.
Tony's chest tightened. He tried to inhale but found that he couldn't. There was no air to breathe anyway. He was trapped in a vacuum.
"Fainting chairs?"
"Do what to myself?"
She had just started composing her second message when it became clear that something wasn't right. She heard the phone at the front desk ring. That was completely normal. What wasn't normal was the grim look she saw on the receptionist's face when she looked up. When he got off the phone, he stood up and whistled to get everyone's attention.
"Well, that really helps my confidence in apologizing to you." Stark rolled his eyes, but Natasha continued. "We're all a part of the same team. I figured I owed you an apology, too." Stark gave a fake laugh.
"I want a divorce!"
"First, it's a
The next few chapters will move things along a lot better, and I know you'll all be happy to see some of the developments.
"It's a movie," Tony sounded slightly apologetic. "It came out after you were frozen. It's about a guy escaping from prison."
"It's alright, I should have expected this to happen sooner or later." The officer looked perplexed until Tony said, "who leaked it to the press that I'm here?"
"No, it's…"
Carol's ears were ringing when she came to again. She felt a heavy weight pressing down on her shoulders, but she did not even attempt to shake it off or move. She was too tired. She wanted to sleep a little more.
"What do you mean?" he asked. Tony let out a soft sigh.
"Tony, no." Steve's voice is firm, but Tony could hear the tiniest bit of worry mixed in there.
"But you are," Steve pointed out. "You're breathing at a nice, solid, even pace. No need to worry."
It was silent for another few moments before Steve felt a hand gently set itself on his bicep. Slowly, he made eye contact with Pepper, whom – to her credit – didn't look the least bit pitying.
"Technically that wasn't me or the hotel," he said. "That was Metro Police…"
"Bruce!"
"Depends," Natasha said. "What is it?"
"Like what?"
"Uh, no," she said as she furrowed her brow. "I mean I'm on Lotensin, but that's for Diabetes, not any heart problem. Why?"
"It's a yes," Laura confirmed. Clint gave a little fist pump. "I just can't help but be a little concerned."
"Look," she said. "I don't have much in the way of proof. I still have the original document I typed up and submitted to Fury. I can easily get it for you. However, that is still not concreate. The most I can say is that I know someone switched the reports sometime between me handing it in and Fury receiving it. I notified him of it, and he believes me."
"Do you want to talk about it?"
"And what would that be?" Pepper asked with caution permeating every word she spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
Giving orders for the rest of the S.T.R.I.K.E. team to stand down, Steve rushed to the location of Subarian's lab. Unsurprisingly, he found Natasha standing in the hallway, directly standing in front of the window overlooking the lab. She had one of her guns drawn. Getting closer to the scene, Steve could see a man in protective gear on the other side of the glass, holding his hands up in surrender. This had to be Dr. Subarian. He also noticed that the glass didn't appear to be cracked or broken. Trailing his eyes upwards, he spotted the bullet holes in the ceiling title directly above Nat.
. Regardless of that fact, though, you ended up proving it wrong anyways."
"Well," Lara said. "They said in the security office that it was on floor P1. Could something in the lab have broken to cause this." Bruce shook his head.
When Steve woke up that morning, he immediately noticed that Tony was so pale that his complexion was almost ashen. He was alarmed when he felt how hot Tony was, but after Tony woke up, Steve just let him fall back to sleep. He thought maybe Tony would get better with a little more rest, and the fact that Tony had basically rolled into his arms might have also made him reluctant to wake him. They stayed like that for a while, only being interrupted when some sort of device started playing music from Tony's pocket and Tony woke up to shut it off.
Natasha was still trying to clip her Widow's Bites around her wrists and Steve was still pulling up some of the zippers on his uniform as they came running down the main hallway. Bruce stepped out of the lab just in time to intercept them.
"Oh yes," Tony said.
"And you do that by bringing people into your community?" Carol asked.
"I don't need to know unless you want me to know," he said. "And you don't."
Thank you to Saidra and Senisra for the comments on AO3 and Alltheblackcatsarecool for leaving kudos! You guys rock!
"Agent Romanoff," he said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. "What are you doing here."
Originally uploaded to FFN on 11/1/19.
"Huh?" Lara tapped the equation in question.
Alarms started blaring as soon as the Tower was struck. JARVIS announced that he could not identify what the Tower had been struck with, but he did not detect any explosions. That was about as good of the news as they were going to get. The projectile was traveling at over six-hundred miles per-hour and had struck somewhere between the forty-third and forty-fifth floors; meaning that the executive level of Stark Industries' headquarters had been struck. That could not be an accident.
Peggy told me because I'm bi, too.
"No," the other woman said. "After this it should come naturally."
"Good," Lara said as she readjusted the strap on her messenger bag. "I'll get going, then. Be right back." Then she left. Just like that, Steve and Tony were left alone in the room together.
"Do you feel better?" she asked. "At least a little bit?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"So, you think she was lying?" Natasha shook her head.
The fourth and final time Tony woke up that morning, he was clutching his own ears and begging for the pain to stop. There was a loud, high pitched noise coming from somewhere in his room and Tony's eyes desperately sought out the source.
"Five figures…" he muttered to himself.
"I have an army," Loki pointed out.
He was only distracted by a sudden deafening silence. Clint's heart skipped a beat as his hands went straight to his ears. He couldn't feel any injuries and when he pulled his hands away, he didn't see any blood. However, it wasn't until he heard Stark speak up that he could put that fear to rest.
"So, do you work for them," he asked. "S.H.I.E.L.D.?"
Snapping his eyes back open and gasping for breath, Loki took a cautious look around his surroundings. He was back in the underground tunnel network. Selvig was still working on the device with the scientist-minions. The soldier-minions were still patrolling. The Hawkeye stood in front of the device, staring at the Tesseract. He was where he was supposed to be. The pain was gone. All of that was good.
In the age of the Internet, it's a given that no one watches the news anymore. If you want to keep up with what's going on in your local area, you must be on Twitter. Using Twitter, the public can break the news hours before the official news outlets can do so. So, if something strange or suspicious was going on, the first thing most people would do would be to pull out their cellphones and start posting on Twitter.
"What do we do in the meantime?" Bruce asked. Tony shrugged.
As much as she loved Tony, Pepper knew that he didn't always take the best care of himself. The palladium poisoning incident was only a testament to that. It wasn't that she didn't trust him or thought he needed to be constantly babysat, but she would feel a whole lot better if there was someone there to keep an eye on him throughout the day, help him with anything he needed, and make sure he didn't do anything stupid and dangerous. Well, anything more stupid and dangerous than what he already did. Since Tony obviously wasn't going to find one himself, Pepper had no choice but to do it for him.
"What do you mean?" Oswin took a deep breath as she prepared to explain.
As the car pulled into the Tower's underground parking garage, Natasha took a deep breath and reassured herself that everything was fine. She glanced up to look at Clint's reflection in the rearview mirror He still looked terrible. His skin was much paler than it usually was, and he was clearly very worn down and weak, but he was still alive, and that in and of itself was a miracle.
The elevator doors opened with a high-pitched ding that in Tony's opinion was way too loud. He could already feel the shockwaves traveling through his brain, agitating his fledgling headache beyond compare. It was so bad that it made his stomach roll a bit, something that hadn't happened since the aplastic anemia incident. That really put into perspective how sick he was going to be if he didn't curb the hangover ASAP.
"Well, it's not like I minded," he said.
At that point, it became clear why Lara asked Romanoff to fill in for her. It was because Lara took all of Tony's remarks about skipping the meeting seriously and she wanted someone to make sure he went. Looking back, he probably should have made it clearer that was joking. After all, he did understand that the longer he put off facing the board, the more upset they would be. As such, he was not going to avoid it any longer than he already had. However, it did irk him that Lara apparently thought he needed a babysitter. He was forty-one years old and he had been CEO of the company for nineteen years. He could take care of himself and accurately make decisions on what the best thing to do would be.
"I was what struck the Tower," Carol said plainly, leaving no room for misinterpretation. The gears instantly clicked behind his eyes and he jolted a little from the shock.
"Yes, it was," Lara said. "Which is why it makes an ass out of you and me. I have that saying right, right?"
Again, Tony found himself hesitating. At first, he didn't think that there was anything else he needed to add, but then he thought of what the nightmares were about. That was… He honestly couldn't even think of what words he could use to explain it. He new after the…
"Where were you?" he asked. "We couldn't find you anywhere."
Carol nodded and let the woman do what she needed to. She looked around, trying to decipher more through observation of her surroundings, but the problem was that there wasn't much to observe. Outside of a lone, likely dysfunctional fire alarm positioned on the opposite wall, the room was bare. There wasn't even anywhere to sit. Thus, Carol was forced to stand and wait.
"No, it's not," Stark said. "Trust me, I'm sparing him. I'm sparing everyone."
"You cut right to the chase, don't you?" Pepper continued to give him a pointed look. Dr. Griffith chose his next words carefully. His career depended on it. "We've been robbed."
"It took an hour and a half for the Twin Towers to fall," Clint argued. "And with that reinforced staircase, we'd have plenty of time to escape."
"I know," she said.
"I found the box that once contained the venom on the steps to my basement," Salinas explained. "Luckily I caught it before I could eat or drink anything in that house. I'm even having the hot water heater replaced, just in case."
The Kree were the biggest example, but Carol had been to a planet called Aurelia before. It was abandoned but incredibly beautiful with its lush green fields and vibrant purple skies. It also had one of the most gorgeous sunsets she had ever seen. Knowing that they were referencing real species and planets within the universe that shouldn't be known to Earth did raise Carol's suspicions, but it made it even harder to see how the average person was falling for it.
The following explosion threw Oswin and Knežević clean across the street into the neighbor's yard. Luckily, no cars, fences, or other yard debris impeded their paths, so they both landed safely on the nice, hard ground. It wasn't a comfortable landing, but at least they weren't paralyzed.
The building looked like a nondescript office building on the outside, but Tony knew that it was really a high-tech S.H.I.E.L.D. building on the inside. As soon as he entered the building, he spotted Coulson and Fury waiting for him.
"If you don't like it, you shouldn't have put me in charge." Tony frowned.
Anyways, if you like this chapter be sure to leave a comment or a review!
"No," he said. "Betty saved them when I went on the run, but I'd imagine the government would have taken them back after the Harlem incident."
Having already gone over her schedule for the day, Pepper knew that she had two meetings scheduled before the interviews for Tony's new PA in the afternoon. She hadn't heard back from Tony yet as to whether he'd be joining her in interviewing the applicants (who had already been narrowed down to a short-list of five people), but she did receive a text from him the night before informing her that he had made it back to LA safely. Her best guess was that he was jet-lagged and was sleeping in. If she didn't hear from him by her lunchtime she'd go to his house and make sure he was okay. These constant migraines he was having were really starting to worry her.
"I can give you an even better time," he said. "But first I have to take care of this." Steve nodded in understanding.
"Go ahead," he said softly. "We'll all be waiting for you when you're ready. I promise." For a second, Tony's lips quirked upwards.
"I don't think I…" Before Loki could finish that sentence, he found himself blown into the next room. Slowly, he got up off the ground and brushed some of the dust off. His entire chest and stomach hurt from that. Not willing to risk getting hit with another one of those blasts, Loki slowly started making his way to where his extraction team would be waiting for him.
. I want to be able to hold you and kiss you whenever I like. I want to go to bed with you every night and wake up with you every morning. I want to get to know you, Tony. I want to know everything you are." As he spoke he could feel Tony slowly relax in his arms. He liked that idea, but still, there was an underlying layer of nervousness.
Surprisingly, Freeman was fast for a man his age. Natasha could keep up, but at the same time she didn't want to confront him just yet. He was still on the phone spouting important information. She could still garner something useful.
"That's giant to us, Thor," Clint said.
like to help if I can."
"Seriously?" she said. "Does this mean that all of this…" She stopped once she caught sight of Pepper's warning look; a look you don't want to be on the wrong side of. She had the sense to at least try to look apologetic as she looked back at Tony. "That's awful, Tony. Is there any way to make this easier on you?" Tony shook his head.
"Yeah," Stark said. "Then she and Steve will track down the bastards who did this to us and give them hell."
"JARVIS," Tony said.
"I, uh, don't really know what's here," he said. "So, wherever you guys want to start…"
"No," Bruce said. "He's fine, but as I said, he's probably going to want to tell you himself." Lara nodded in understanding.
," Rhodey said. "Yes, I would expect a lot more people to be injured, but I don't think you understand how high 650 feet is."
She kept the rhythm in her head, moving with exact precision. The training was hard, and she struggled to keep a balance between perfection and failure. Failure meant death. Perfection was something far worse. Average was survival. So, she did her best not to stand out for either good or bad. With every plié, balancé, pirouette, kick, jab, lunge… Wait, were they dancing or fighting? Honestly, Natasha couldn't tell anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, of course." Rhodey waited a beat for JARVIS to elaborate further but he was not so fortunate to have the young AI understand that that he wanted more information than just that.
Natasha said nothing as she shut the door behind her and crossed the room to the chair opposite Sharpton. The two stared at each other silently for a moment. Sharpton's gaze carried all the hate in the world while Nat's face remained cold, calculated, and impassive. Slowly, she lowered herself into the chair, placing her hands down on the metal table, folded on top or each other. Another staring contest ensued until Sharpton finally became annoyed enough to speak up again.
Carol was taken aback by fear. It was truly was a stroke of luck that she happened to be in the same place as the "religion's" founder, especially since the church had multiple locations in this city alone. However, she wasn't sure if that was good luck or bad luck. She had to hope for good, though. After all, he was probably the best hope she had at finding out the Church's connection to the Kree.
"Of course, it is," she said. "I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't."
"I know," he said. "That's not what I'm worried about."
"Yeah," Lara said.
"And grad school," Bruce added.
"Who's seen the tape?" Pepper's brow knitted in confusion. "Who's seen the tape?" Tony asked again.
"Provided he wants help," Lara said. "Given that he almost killed himself with alcohol, I would say that he probably doesn't."
"Wait, doesn't the post office irradiate our mail?" Natasha asked.
Steve didn't see him, though. In fact, he had his back to Tony while he held open the giant glass door. Steve had his gaze on Commander Hill who was climbing who was climbing out of a black SUV that was pulled up to the curb. The back door of the SUV was still open wide, likely for a third person who was taking their sweet time getting out of the car. Steve and Hill were talking back and forth and neither had even glanced in the direction of the windows. So, they didn't know that Tony was standing there.
"Which one?"
"It's stupid," he grumbled, prompting Steve to take a tighter hold of his hand. "The forum just asked what I'm seeking help for. It's fine."
"Yeah?"
"So, what's wrong with Christine Everhart?" Tony took notice of the way she slowly enunciated her words, so they came out clearly without an accent.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha sat on the floor of the hallway she had been running down while being pursued by the Hulk. Literally, thank God that Thor was able to intervene. Otherwise, she probably would have had her brains smashed out. She had one leg – the one that had been trapped under the debris of the explosion – pulled close to her and she was shaking. That shocked her.
"Like Christmas," Tony said. "But with more me."
"E," Tony said. "All of the above."
"Great," he said. "Just… Great."
"Until what's all over?" Natasha sighed.
Tony kept thinking he should lean up to give Steve another kiss, but he didn't want to break the moment. Eventually, Steve went ahead and did it by speaking up.
"What'd be even worse would be if the others were here, too," Stark said. "Steve, Romanoff, Bruce… Especially Bruce. If he were trapped here with us, we wouldn't have a chance."
"You're missing the point," Tony said. "There is no throne. There is no version of this where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you because if we can't protect the Earth you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it." Loki still didn't seem phased. In fact, it looked as though he was biting back a smirk.
"Well, your brain is wrong," Tony said. "I know you have a lot of internalized homophobia, but please trust me when I say it's a lot safer now than it was even just ten years ago. I've been out of the closet for almost seventeen years and the worst that's happened was the public humiliation I faced when it first happened. That's it. Granted, I did have the privilege of not having to worry about losing my job or my lifestyle, but still…"
"And you would be right," Pepper assured. "We just came to show Tony our support." Dr. Cranston's smile seemed to grow brighter.
"And we saw you all in action during the Battle of New York," Everhart said. "Speaking of which, what was it like being in the heat of all of that; the fighting and whatnot?"
Thinking fast, Duran took her gun from where it was holstered at her hip and headed back outside to confront the alleged serial killer. When she got out there, Nina rushed to her feet.
"Well, you should have thought of that before you made the bet."
If they heard her at all, they ignored her. Frowning, Lara slumped back down on the pull-out couch, wondering why she had a friend who had to be so loud, or – even better – why she couldn't have one considerate enough not to have sex while guests were over. Even Telemachus was upset. He stood poised at the end of the mattress, ready to attack the vicious animal that he seemed convinced would come bounding out of the bedroom at any time.
"I think you mean it's a
"Right," Tony said. "Don't be surprised if they won't let me back in there." Fury narrowed his eye at him.
"I think that's an awesome name." Clint turned his gaze to the puppy. "From now on, you're Lucky. Do you think you can remember that?" The dog wagged his tail, which was the best response that Clint was going to get. "I think he likes it."
"Everything's the same as it was five minutes ago," she relented. "Perfectly normal."
"You sure about that?" he asked.
"I didn't think you'd need to be told about it…"
"That's funny," he said. "Considering you didn't want me on that team in the first place. I don't suppose you're going to apologize for that?"
"Usually," he said with a shrug. The doctor's smile didn't waver as she approached with an extended hand.
"Listen," he whispered. "This is going to be the only chance I get to say this, so pay attention. Do not let S.H.I.E.L.D. take blood from you or do any blood tests. As a patient, you have the right to refuse any medical test that they try to force on you. Understand?" Tony pulled back to look at Steve, who nodded. "Good." Tony then reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper that he then handed to Steve. "That's my phone number. Call me as soon as you figure out how to use a phone." Tony started to walk away, and Steve scoffed.
"Besides, you're not out of the woods yet," Freeman reminded them. "You still have the fundraising gala benefiting the New York Battle Relief Fund." It seemed like everyone in the car wanted to groan at the thought, but were too polite to do so, so they just let a tense silence fill the air. Well, almost silence.
"Nope," Lara said. "We're going to be stuck at the Motel 6 after Wednesday. Again, I can't afford this."
"Just in case Fury forgets to invite me to the party again," she said. "I can trust you not to leave me out, right?" She gave him a wink.
Remember kids, if your friend posts publically on Facebook that she's babysitting today, don't text them trying to make plans for the day and get pissed when your friend can't come over because "you never told me!" Yes, I did. I know I did because you liked the status! (I told you my attention's being pulled in six different directions!)
"Yeah," he said. "I'm sorry."
"Ah, yes," Dr. Fox said. "We've placed modified heat packs all around your body to warm you up. That's the weight and the heat you're feeling, but you'd probably be having a hard time lifting your arms anyway. We've given you a rather large dose of valium, so you're not at your full strength right now."
"I mean, how else am I supposed to take that?" Pepper put a hand on his shoulder.
"I promise you, wife," he said. "We will always be together. The universe has entwined our souls. We were destined to be together, to ascension and beyond."
"It doesn't work like that," she said as she slid onto the barstool next to Tony.
"What?" The cold tone was creeping into his voice again. Oswin took notice.
"Fine," he said. "Make sure he doesn't damage the room and that the hotel staff doesn't see him. If they do, you're paying for it." Clint nodded.
"Uh, better than I expected?" Tony winced. "I mean, he didn't verbalize how disgusted he was with me, so that seems positive." Rhodey could not help but be disappointed in how low his friend's bar for "positive" was set, but at the same time he could not blame him. "He also did try to warn me that the board might oust me for this, so…" Rhodey's nostrils flared almost as much as his anger.
"Alright," he said. "Now I know you all have questions you want to be answered, and we'll get to that in a minute. If everyone who wants to ask something could please calmly form a line behind the microphone located in each aisle at this time that would be great. Just please, listen to each staff member standing by and follow their instructions carefully."
The light of morning had started brightening the gray sky when Steve woke up. The first thing he did was turn over to make sure that Tony was still in the bed with him. To Steve's relief, Tony was still there and snoring softly; peacefully asleep. Thankful, Steve got closer to Tony and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. He heard Tony softly mumble the word "sure," before snuggling closer and seemingly falling back to sleep. Steve stroked his hair gently and listened to Tony's calm, even breathing.
"This way," Fury gestured with a nod of his head. Carol started walking in the direction indicated with Fury and Hill falling into step beside her. "And on the way there, you can explain what the hell happened." Carol let out a sigh. She knew she wasn't going to get off that easy.
Thankfully, the answer was not anything irrational. Steve faced Tony rather than Carol, putting his hands right on Tony's shoulders and looked him directly in the eyes.
"What's the next step?" he asked while he did so.
Tony couldn't argue with that. He got a hundred from his wallet and gave it to her. Conroy expressed her eternal gratitude before running off to call the cab company. Tony got into the back of the car and chatted with happy as it pulled off into the street.
"Same here," he agreed before looking down. "You know I can't promise you anything with this; anything at all." Steve started to nod in agreement, until he thought of something.
Tony could see Freeman and Lara out of the corner of his eye. Freeman gave him a thumbs up while Lara – despite her anger with him earlier – was trying to look as reassuring as possible. Tony appreciated that as he focused his gaze on the woman in front of him. The producer told them they were rolling, and a plastic smile came across Everhart's face.
Steve sat up and offered Tony a hand. At least he was being nice to him. Standing up, he turned to Lara.
Loki mentally added.
"I'm working on a few different projects," Tony said. "Pepper and I have been working on the idea of a self-sustaining skyscraper for a few months now. I'm designing it and Pepper's handling the business logistics of it. We just broke ground on that a few days ago. Plus, you know, there's the whole Iron Man thing…"
"Oh, that?" she said rather nonchalantly. "That probably has to do with that gay sex tape from 1995. He doesn't like having it brought up in any way, shape or form. Probably saw that himself and asked Fury to redact it. Anyway, I'll bring this right back to you, okay?" She then left the room, leaving Steve in an almost paralyzed state of shock.
"Because I've hit hard times before," Carol said. "And I would have given anything for someone – even a complete stranger – to just ask me that one question."
"I need to see the files you were given about Stark," she said. "Can I come in?"
Rhodey did his best to calm himself down on the elevator ride up to Tony's floor. He did not know what state Tony would be in when he got there and regardless, he did not need to have to deal with the stunts the media was pulling right now. In fact, he did not need to have to deal with half of the stuff he always had to deal with, but life never really got to be fair like that.
"I'm fine," Tony assured. "Just don't like people talking to you that way."

"No," Pepper said. "That's good. You did what you were supposed to do."
"Other than Clint trying to pawn some of the vegetables off on the dog? No." Steve snorted in amusement.
"That's weird," he heard Lara say. "The door is open." Stark must have shrugged it off.
"Holy fuck," he exclaimed.
The entire notion of that made Rhodey feel six different kinds of sick. Firstly, it implied all gay or bisexual people were diseased, which could not be further from the truth. Secondly, it made Tony sound like a complete idiot. Tony was very aware that AIDS was an epidemic and took great care to use protection with
"Here, here!" The two then clinked their glasses together and downed their liquor in one gulp.
A virus was sent to the Avengers through the mail, infecting Clint but no one else. Natasha rushed into his isolation room with her phone so that way he could at least hear Laura's voice one last time if things went wrong, and Tony and Steve were reunited at the hospital. Meanwhile, SI is dealing with a public relations disaster after the head of their public relations department tried to smear the company on national TV.
I'm back on track, so let's get this chapter rolling!
"Get out of my sight, Romanoff." He barely noticed the way her face fell.
"Shit!" Tony pulled his hands away. Knežević started running back down the beach. Tony flipped his hands to look at them. Both the repulsors and the metal surrounding them started to turn to clear stone.
"No, no," he said. "You just got off a plane. Don't get on another one."
"I didn't sleep with him if that's what you're asking," Tony said. "I mean, I slept
"I made this bracelet for him at school," she explained, holding up a small, pale blue box that presumably held the bracelet inside. "My daddy got special tickets just so I could come here and give it to him." The crowd gave out a wave of "awws." Clint got up from his seat and approached the edge of the stage.
"So, you might think." Try as she might, Carol couldn't avoid the hand that came around to smack her.
couldn't do anything," he said. "Believe me; she tried more than once. My mom, Jarvis, Ana… None of them could do anything at all. Howard just was who he was. Even if you were there, I don't think it would have made a difference. Besides, if you were there then, you wouldn't be here now, and I'm glad you're here now."
"Funny," Pepper said. "Isn't that what you said when I told you to get the floors done back in August?" Tony let out a breath of exasperation. Lara saw this as the perfect opportunity to cut in.
Eventually, though, they relented and a few months ago they finally came out with a press release stating that Steve Rogers was alive and well, having spent sixty-five years frozen in the Arctic Circle. You know what happened after that? Absolutely nothing. Well, Steve did have to answer a few questions for a few reporters initially, but after that, the public didn't seem to have much interest. Probably because most of the public was too young to have even lived through the Second World War. They hadn't heard of Captain America outside of their history books and their Grandpa's (full of bull) war stories. The way S.H.I.E.L.D. had made it sound, he would get mobbed just as bad as Tony does whenever he even so much as thinks about entering a public space, but no. That's not what happened. Steve could go out in public and not get accosted by anyone. Yeah, S.H.I.E.L.D. was clearly only interested in keeping everyone's eyes away from them. Well, they probably should have thought about that before they thawed him out of the ice.
"We have everything to fear from you." Adoniram said. "You may not be allied with the Kree, but you can't say the same of the Avengers."
The music that could be heard coming out of the plane's speakers. Thankfully, it wasn't one of the louder songs on Tony's playlist, but it was still very different from what Steve was used to hearing. It seemed to be entirely composed of guitars and drums and sort of an overall unusual sound to it. Eventually, Steve had to ask.
"I'm sorry," Steve tried to say, but Rhodes shook his head.
"Tony?" He froze the second he heard Steve's voice. Turning around, he could see what Conroy was talking about. Although Steve was doing his best to mask it, it was clear that underneath the surface was a mind fraught with fear and worry. Tony knew that mask well. He wore it often. "What are you doing?"
"I just thought maybe it would be weird." Bruce shook his head.
"Twice," Bruce added. Natasha let out a slightly wicked laugh and held out her hand to the man next to her.
"It's wonderful now that you're here." Tony pulled Steve back down for another kiss while Lara gave out a groan of mock-disgust.
"Hello," the man greeted pleasantly. "You're Winnifred Oswald, right?"
"Ketamine?" Rhodey questioned. "What's that?"
"No," he said softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm sorry," she said. "But you know this isn't right." Tony looked down but nodded.
In addition to picking out his pajamas for him, Steve had also done the courtesy of bringing Tony his father's robe. Like the rest of his pajamas, it too was freshly laundered and still slightly warm. Tony took his sweet time putting it on. He wasn't sure why he took the robe after his father died. There wasn't any special sentimentality attached to it and he had been so angry at the time that he had gotten rid of most of Howard's personal items out of spite, but he kept the robe. More than that, he wore it around and even occasionally slept in it. Tony wasn't sure what that said about him. Sigmund Freud would probably have a field day with it (as well as his other "Howard issues") but honestly, he didn't want to look deeper into it. He was already due in for a lot of that in the morning anyway.
When Tony got out of the shower, Steve was fast asleep – a sight he was relieved to see. As touching as it was that Steve had stayed up the whole night because he was worried about him, Tony honestly didn't want him to sacrifice his wellbeing for him. Yes, he realized how hypocritical this was, but love by it's very nature was hypocritical. He was aloud to want things for Steve that contradicted how he treated himself. At least, in his mind. A little thing called "reality" might disagree with that.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's fine," he said. "But we have
"Just take the damn pills," she said. "I promise they work. It's what I usually use to get rid of colds since I can't take cough syrup anymore. You'll be feeling
"It is not," Bruce assured. "Most normal places don't hand out free alcohol to just anyone, especially during the breakfast hour."
"And you're doing a marvelous job with that," he said. "The humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret. I mean to rule them, as why should I not?"
"Your nose is stuffed up so much, it sounds like Tweety Bird," Stark said. "It's a pretty obvious tell."
"Good. I left my phone in my bedroom. Can you go back and grab it for me and get a change of clothes."
"That incident has been acknowledged and dealt with, and it has done nothing to make me personally distrust her," Pepper answered smoothly. "I am sure Miss Conroy took all the proper considerations necessary in asking Miss Romanoff to fill in for her."
"Yes." Tony shrugged.
"You can fill this out afterward." Lara gave her a nod and a quick thanks. Lucy left the room and Lara sat down across from Carl. He didn't waste any time in getting started.
"You've been saying that for months and it's obviously not true," Steve said.
Despite his assurance, being alone in the room with Steve was easier said than done. He was just so tense and Tony knew it was because of Peggy telling him Steve was bi. He knew he had nothing to apologize for – Peggy was the one who broke Steve's trust, apparently, not him – but he didn't know how to proceed from here. He was just about to take a shot in the dark and say something, but his attention was diverted when a knock was heard from the doorway. Immediately he turned to see a man wearing a uniform emblemized with Los Angeles County Sherriff's Department patches.
"What's your thing," Tony asked. "Pilates?" Steve furrowed his brow.
"Take your damn dress back, Stark," she said. "Versace is more to my taste anyway."
"What's the matter?" Steve asked the God. "Are you scared of a little lightning?"
Jessica then went on to explain the entire sequence of events from the text her Hydra handler had sent her to the moment she panicked and paged Carol. Fury didn't say or do anything to interrupt her, he just let her explain as best she could. As Jess talked, though, Carol couldn't help but get worried. It was clear she was having chest pain from the way she kept her hand over her heart, but also as she spoke, she became more out of breath. By the time she finished, Carol was wondering if she should pull that doctor away from Stark to look at Jess.
to sit." Steve gently tried to push Tony back down.
"The one that outed you." At that point, Tony couldn't fight off the sinking feeling any longer.
"I know," he said. "As I said, I'd be right with you if the circumstances were different."
he thought.
"Good." Steve rubbed his thumb across the back of Tony's hand. "So… I guess we should talk about this, huh?"
Again, he tried opening his eyes, this time putting all his concentration into it. Slowly, a crack began to form, and light seeped through. With a little more effort, it got wider, and the world came into focus. Given that he was still being forced to lay on his back, the only things he could see looking straight-on were the blacklights above him. However, if he strained his gaze over to the corner of his eye, he could see the top of Natasha's redhead very clearly. Slowly she moved so that way she was standing over him, giving him a clear view of her face.
He dreamt that he ripped open a letter filled with white powder and he was rushed to the hospital. He had no way of knowing if he was infected or if he infected anyone else. While all of this was happening, Laura and the kids were completely oblivious to the situation. He could have died from whatever mystery ailment he contracted, and they would never have known it or gotten to say goodbye. Good thing it was all just a dream.
Yeah, obviously I'm not in the right headspace to be writing an author's note right now but I know if I don't write something now I'll forget when I actually go to publish the chapter. I hope you all enjoy the fluff! Sorry, I'm such a Debby Downer.
"Oh, Jesus, Stark," Clint said, putting a hand over his heart. "You scared me!"
Cabe ran into the shot, going right up to Freeman and whispering what Lara could only assume to be threats. Lara squeezed her eyes shut and almost covered her ears. She wasn't sure she wanted to hear what came next.
He didn't cry, not because he didn't want to, or he couldn't, but because he just didn't feel like it. He was too scared to cry. That was a surreal feeling. Worst of all, he didn't know how to make it go away. So, he did the only thing he could think to do, sit and take deep breaths of the fresh(ish) air.
He managed to get showered and dressed in record time and probably would have managed to at least get on the highway before the meeting started if he hadn't almost tripped over his new personal assistant on the way out the door. To be fair, she probably shouldn't have been sitting with her back against the front door, but she still got mad anyway.
"Yeah," he said. "I think I can." Natasha gave him another smile.
"Anything else?" Freeman hesitated a moment before shaking his head.
"They're a spy agency," Lara remarked with a shrug. "They almost always do."
"You can send them in," he said. "As long as you don't mind escorting Sister Margot to the backstage area?"
pleasure."
Tony Stark did not date people, but he did have a few that he regularly hooked up with. Tiberius Stone was one of them. He was some executive from another company that Rhodey did not even bother to learn the name of. All he knew was that he did not like the guy or the way he seemingly treated Tony like he was his property. However, that did not stop Tony from seeing him off-and-on for the past year. In fact, the only thing that did was some argument Tony was not willing to go into the details of. Rhodey did not pry further because he was only glad that the guy was out of Tony's life for good. At least, that is what he thought until he saw him appear on the tape. Then, he started to realize that Tony might not be out of the woods yet.
Steve followed him to the bathroom but could only watch from the door as there wasn't much space. When he finished, though, Steve did help him by handing him some napkins to wipe off his face. Tony got up from the floor and did his best to rinse his mouth out using water from the sink. He heard once that if your mouth tasted like vomit, it would just make you throw up again. The best thing to do to keep that from happening was to brush your teeth, but Tony didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste on him, and the closest thing to mouthwash available on the plane was peppermint schnapps, and he wouldn't be allowed to use that. He'd have to make do with just straight water.
"Oh God," Carol said as she stood up. "This is where I get hit with the cost of damages, isn't it?"
"You can't tell me this is all going to be alright, Rhodey," he said. "Because I know it's not." Rhodey shook his head.
"Alright, I understand I made a mistake. I'm sorry." Despite the apology, he didn't drop the condescending tone. "I assure you, though, Congressman Salinas' intentions were good. He only wanted to help Stark in his time of need."
The placement of the Arc Reactor already gave Tony a diminished lung capacity, not to mention the bits of shrapnel that threatened to shred his heart and lungs should said reactor become dysfunctional. Basically, his lungs were already in bad shape and having fluid constantly flowing to his lungs via post-nasal drip wasn't helping matters. So, as a precaution Dr. Holcomb had him hooked up to a heart monitor to keep an eye on his vitals, and a nasal canula to continuously provide him with clean oxygen. He had to admit that the canula made it a bit easier to breathe, but the heart monitor did nothing but add undue stress to Tony's already fragile state. He couldn't explain why, but Tony couldn't help but feel threatened by the medical device. With each sharp beep it gave, all he could hear was a shrill, electronic voice mocking him.
"Tony Stark," he said again. "
"Yeah, I know," Tony said. "It's fine. Let them do it." Steve raised an eyebrow while his mouth formed a tight line.
"Oh," he said. "I guess Fury forgot to mention that you're not the only superhero game in town anymore."
Parting ways in the parking lot, the two men got into their respective vehicles and headed to their homes. When Rhodey reached his, he made a point of running that tape over one more time as he pulled into the driveway. After getting out of the car, he swept the pieces up, took them out to his backyard fire pit, and set them ablaze.
"No, you're not," Amanda said. "So, if you would kindly leave…" Fury whipped out his badge before she could even think of saying anything more.
, a master magician. If anyone tried to mess with his mind, surely he'd be able to stop them, right?
"The press about the construction of the tower has been good." Tony mentally thanked Pepper for starting off on the lighter side of things. "The fact that the tower is going to be totally self-sufficient is a point of interest – as we thought it would be. Also, ABC released a statement announcing that they have fired the reporter who interviewed you for insubordination and publicly apologized to you."
"Get them extremely sick or get as many people sick as possible," Bruce concluded. "A lot of things can do one or the other."
"You gave me two months off and the option to see a counselor," Clint pointed out. "Did you offer the same thing for Stark?"
The producer returned a short time later, calling for Bruce. He got up and followed the woman out of the room along with Freeman and Lara. It went along like that for a while. The producer came back every fifteen to twenty minutes to retrieve another member of the team, going alphabetically by last name. Barton was next, followed by Steve and Romanoff, leaving Tony for last. Tony wasn't nervous at all. He just flipped through the packet, reviewing his answers to the questions.
"What symbol?" she asked.
"Who's they?" Tony asked. "Where are you going?"
"Tony," Steve said softly. "You're sick. You shouldn't
Even though they were showering together, they didn't engage in any foreplay or sexual activity. That would only serve to wind them up when really what they needed was to relax and wind down. Also, Steve was concerned about disturbing their guest. Tony tried to point out that Rhodey's room was on the other side of the apartment and the walls were thick enough to where he couldn't hear, but Steve's reddening cheeks convinced Tony to relent. He might be getting frustrated with the public hang-ups but wanting a private moment to stay between them was something he could easily understand.
Naturally, if someone was looking for strange goings on in the City of Los Angeles, Twitter would be the first place they would start their search. It took a few hours, but events falling under the category of strange started popping up under the hashtags "wtf", "wierdla", "dafaqisthis", and "freaky." Searching further to the earliest post that could be found, it would quickly be revealed to be a post by a person with the username "abs_rocks" of a huge rock stuck to her fence with the claims that it hadn't been there before. Other users quickly followed up with posts and pictures of other rocks of other rocks that had supposedly suddenly appeared in their backyards and gardens.
"He already has one of those, too." Natasha gave a wave, but Lara was still unamused.
"This wouldn't have to do with the Peoples Unity Church, now would it?" Romanoff raised an eyebrow, but Freeman seemed relaxed at the mention of the group.
"I don't care," Rhodey said. "If you need me…"
"Oh, I understand completely," Salinas said. "The media can be a merciless menace."
Once he woke up and got ready, he intended to pick right back up where he left off. That was until he heard a knock at the door. Before he even opened it, he knew that it was Lara. She more than likely only had a vague recollection of the night before and needed him to tell her what happened, which wasn't a problem at all. He opened the door, but before he could even get a single word out, Lara pre-empted him.
Remember kids, there's no sense crying over every mistake! You just keep on trying 'till you run out of cake!
"Conroy's trying to guess my social security number," Tony said.
"Whatever you can," Tony said. "Please, anything you can do – even if it's just holding me right now – could help. Just please…" Tony could feel Steve's arms tighten around his waist and his lips pressing a kiss to his cheek.
"Yeah," he said. "I did. Now she's moved on and so have I."
"Yeah," he said. "I mean, uh… Yeah." Betty laughed. Bruce looked up at her in surprise as she brushed a strand of hair out of her face.
Steve always thought the worst part of a rollercoaster was the build-up to the first hill. The train would slowly be pulled to the top and the entire time he'd be dreading that first dramatic plunge to the ground. Once they'd got over that first fall he'd be having too much fun to notice the other death-defying drops, twists, and turns that the ride took (either that, or too busy throwing up all over his and Bucky's shoes), but that first hill was the one with all the anticipation and momentum thrown behind it and the only one where you'd have enough time to think about it to be scared.
