Sherlock listened silently, still kneeling by the bed. He could well remember his first nights in a cupboard, only it hadn't been terrifying at all. Not after the first night. It had felt like the only safe, manageable place in the world. As long as he'd been in there, the world outside didn't exist.
John hummed in agreement and decided not to correct him. Even though John was still a little uncomfortable with the idea of being a master, he was one. And it would do no harm for Holmes to speak more like his kind.
Maybe Holmes had just gone to the Lidl around the corner. There wasn't much in the fridge and John
"House keeping. Sometimes people rent a house slave if their own is ill, or if they don't have one, but need to impress someone. I could drive if you renew my licence."
"No, no", John denied as they shook hands, despite it was true. The Mike Stamford he remembered had been...considerably thinner.
give your owners a reason to discipline you. You need to promise me, Sherlock. Promise me you'll behave."
"I have my coat and the bag could be used as a pillow if I stuff it with something."
When John said nothing, Holmes speculated further: "That, or at least you've very closely witnessed something you think you should've prevented."
"Because he would have killed Trevor." Holmes's fingers curled into fists as he told how his master at the time had repeatedly beaten this one slave. No matter what had happened, no matter who was at fault, this one slave always got the blame. If Holmes, or anyone, had tried to stop him or say Trevor wasn't at fault, it only got worse for everyone involved. Especially Trevor. One time it did go too far, and their master hadn't stopped even after the slave was unconscious.
He didn't buy a mattress, but he did buy a small pillow and a blanket. They would have to do for now. He'd think about the mattress later.
"Your parents and..?"
"Then prove it, Mr Holmes. Pick your medicine. But which one I gave you? Was it a bluff? Or double-bluff? Triple-bluff?"
"Revenge doesn't explain why he didn't shoot until I was in danger," he pointed out, annoyed that Lestrade suggested someone else might have found the cabbie, too. The DI should have known better. "But if any of the victims have an army level sniper in their family, let me know."
Sherlock pulled aside the blanket, too frustrated to keep lying down. His back was still sore from the beatings, so he rather stood anyway. He got dressed in silence and made his way to the kitchen to silently get the breakfast ingredients ready.
He was wrong of course. Sherlock's freedom was short-lived. He was seen and immediately recognised as a slave, and promptly returned to his owners. Over and over again. He could run. He could hide. But eventually, someone always caught him and brought him back to be punished for his crime.
John looked up at him. "Me? This is my fault?"
"I didn't ask for you to do that," Sherlock replied distastefully, ignoring the question entirely.
"I said I would discipline you."
he was meant to say, but instead he found entirely different set of words coming out of his mouth: “Right, no. No, I think that pretty much covered it.”
Holmes brought him his drink and soundlessly sat back where he'd been sitting when John came back. The pasta indeed was a little darker in colour than it traditionally was supposed to be. Some looked like it had been soaked in the water for far too long, whereas some sounded like al dente gone wrong.
"You've nothing to say?"
There was also a list of the personal possessions the slave 99OR-79/3J3A was allowed to keep. Or rather, all the items and accessories that came with the slave. Most of them were very much standard: several clothing items, shoes, the duffle bag he'd already seen, shaving equipment, comb and a toothbrush. But most notably it listed two items that were legally his property and which John would have absolutely no right to take from the slave or destroy them: an antique violin of uncounted value with a case and a Belstaff tweed coat worth over a thousand pounds. He turned to gape at the slave on the bed: "Your coat is worth over thousand pounds?"
"Good. And what is the purpose of a slave?"
Sherlock did his best to keep his eyes on Mycroft and his voice level as he voiced the question that had been on the tip of his tongue since his brother had stepped in: "Then why did you offer to buy me?"
White tiles and leather straps. A muffled crack of the whip. Screams. Blood.
"But–"
"I see," he said.
"No it's not. Go on, show some remorse."
“That's not what people usually say…” the slave muttered, still looking a bit stunned by John's reaction and burrowing his brows deeply as if he couldn't comprehend the logic behind his words.
His heart skipped a beat, but he looked the cabbie dead in the eye. "That's my stigma."
"Yes, yes, alright!" He gulped down the lump in his throat after John let go. The sudden sharp pain watered his eyes.
"Thank you, sir," the boy murmured and obeyed, though he was still wary and stood as far as he could while still remaining respectful.
It was both comforting and unnerving to sleep in the same space with someone. He'd missed the knowledge of other people nearby during his lonely nights here in London. In Afghanistan they rarely got to sleep alone. It was too silent in here, and too noisy at the same time. The cars passing by and the drunkards on the streets from nearby pubs made it all wrong.
"Interesting?" John huffed. What a very unslave-like thing to say.
"I could take this as a failed escape", John threatened. "God knows you've tried that before. I've read your file."
"Hello, Anderson. Long time no see", Holmes greeted mockingly, with only a slight inclination of his head. John pursed his lips, but didn't say anything. As far as he could tell, Anderson wasn't a slave, but neither him nor Lestrade were bothered by Holmes's lack of respect.
"What about the real reason?"
He could tell himself a million times over that it was all transport —no matter who owned his body as long as he had his mind. But it wasn't true. There was no escaping the fact that he was a slave, nor did he try anymore. He accepted it, he truly did. But he hated it.
"Oh. I see the freak is back", he heard the woman guarding the tape comment with distaste as they approached. She was a slim, tall woman with a beautiful take-no-nonsense face and lots of curly, black hair framing her features. If it weren't for the setting, John would have considered saying something flirtatious.
Even faked tears and promises to be better hadn't changed her mind. "Don't worry, I'll recommend you. InS will find a you nice new owner."
John opened the door to the sitting room from the landing and paced the room. Sherlock bowed his head once John noticed him and approached.
What he'd do if —when, definitely when, he found Holmes and the cab driver he had no idea of. The murderer, despite being a poisoner could very well be armed and John couldn't help but to wish he'd taken his gun.
"Of course, yes. Sorry. You can take him back", she said. She looked down at Sherlock and for a moment their eyes met before Sherlock looked away.
"I texted you just to let you know I'm available again and told you not to contact me on that number unless absolutely necessary. Clearly something's changed. What is it?"
"Three patches?!"
Anger rushed through him, but for once it was good. It gave him the much needed focus. "I
He had long since abandoned his native accent. It had only made him the favourite target for the keepers and overseers to pick on. The couple phrases he ever spoke came naturally American now.
Sherlock snapped out of his thoughts. "Yes, John?"
The slave looked at him with a dubious look on his face, but didn't argue. Instead, he pulled John a chair and made his way to get him a plate.
Renting seems a little desperate. My offer still stands.
"There's been two or three times I maybe went a bit too far in Afghanistan. But I didn't kill anyone or permanently harm anyone. And I stopped others from doing too much harm more often than I remember. But yes. I've killed a slave. Once when I was just a kid, once in university."
"No I'm not", Holmes agreed calmly, still choosing to keep his eyes cast down like he was expected to. Only he hadn't done it to this extent so far, not when he was first shown to his new master, not when John had actually been angry with him. Maybe duct taping his mouth had been enough to show him who was in charge after all. John's instincts insisted it was too good to be true, but the more rational side of him reassured that this man was a slave, enslaved as a child. Whatever the rebelliousness almost free man like behaviour had been, this,
"I'm going to flog you for this later", John fumed.
"Tea. I made tea," he said but went ignored.
be clever. Do your best to seem obedient and loyal. Don't argue with or defy the auctioneers."
Holmes was his property. His to use however he pleased, yes, but with certain responsibilities. John was supposed to take care of him, to keep him safe –and he had selfishly let easy money cloud his judgement. Holmes still found it hard to trust his newest master. Was there anything left of whatever fragile trust John may have earned?
Mycroft didn't even turn back to look at Sherlock. "I'll visit again if I can," he said quietly and crossed the road.
"Just following your orders."
Holmes had been subjected to it thrice. John had noticed the scars on the very day he got Holmes, but he hadn't really looked at them before, hadn't really thought of what they meant. Holmes was not, and had never been, a good slave. He had earned his scars.
"You're allowed to speak", his master said. "I'd rather you did."
"There's no law that'd prohibit a slave from having a free e-mail account", Holmes said defensively.
She stood up and Sherlock dropped his gaze.
But by the next night nothing had come out of it. John hadn't expected a torrent of enquires, given that the site was full of adverts, but he'd thought surely he'd get at least one.
, John reminded himself. It shouldn't matter what he saw or heard. He was less than a pet, furniture, even. No one cared what slaves thought.
"Your rugby pals. I thought so", Holmes mused.
"I wish you trusted me," John spoke softly. "Maybe you were about to trust me. I don't know, I hope you were. I hope you will still trust me, one day."
"Right." John sighed, shaking his head. "Sorry, you're right. I can see what kind of owners you've had previously."
John slapped the slave's face. "I don't care! How dare you defy me? I have been
"John Watson", he finally said, stepping closer and extending his hand. She looked at him, face passive apart from a tiniest smirk at the corner of her mouth.
"It doesn't seem broken," John spoke, brushing the bloodied nose.
Someone knelt beside him and Sherlock tried desperately to stand up. Oh god, he had to get up and work or they'd kill him, too.
"Really?" Well, there was something they had in common then. Something he might be able to discuss about. Ella would be so proud of him, socialising like this. "I actually just got myself a slave last week."
. He hadn't meant to fall asleep. Despite the warm blanket, he was shivering. Shivering like he had back then, wet to the skin, huddling together with the other escapees saved from the freezing water. Even now he could recall the desperate and utter feel of failure hanging heavily above him. Unlike the majority, he had failed before. He had known what would await him back in England. The previous wounds hadn't even been fully healed yet.
The slave narrowed his eyes. "Yes, John."
He felt a light touch on his shoulder and before he knew it, his arm flung to strike the assailant.
His hand was still below the waistband, so he pulled it out discreetly as he arched his neck to look over his shoulder.
John shifted on his chair and his eyes darted to the door and back before settling back to him.
"That’s brilliant. Quite brilliant," John marvelled. As soon as the words left his mouth, the phone vibrated and the ring tone started playing. He looked at Holmes. The slave picked the phone on the bed, smirked, but did not answer it.
“If this item doesn’t suit you, you can request it to be changed for another slave during that time. After three years there will still be a period of two years when it can’t be sold privately. Basically, if after three years you decide you don’t want to keep it, you can hand it back to The Institution and The Institution will compensate you, but won’t give you another slave anymore. If after five years you still want to keep it, the resell rights will be handed to you as well.”
"I could've solved that one over the phone."
"You know my name", he stated, stepping away from the slave despite himself. The man made no move to get closer again.
John paid and stepped out of the taxi. This was where the GPS signal had led him. His phone battery would run out any minute now, but at least the dot indicating Holmes's location had been stationary for many minutes now. He hoped it didn't indicate the slave was dead.
Sherlock gulped air and coughed when the man let go.
," he urged. Mycroft would probably have said more, had they not heard John at the door. The arrival of his master had soon sent his brother away.
Holmes growled. "Yes! Now
children even have nightmares about? Sherlock's nightmares were made of the accident that led into his enslavement, of his four failed escape attempts that went into records (and he would never admit the third one was an escape), the slave club in which he had been illegally kept for three years, the violence under his seventh legal owner, being sold to Florida...
But before he could go on further, the slave was up on his feet again and made a beeline to the pile of his possessions that still had no better place than the floor.
"I'm not getting any younger, am I? It's good to have someone around to read the small prints and pick things up from the floor. With the hip I've got, too..."
The boy cowered on the floor. "Billy, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to– Stand up, you've done nothing wrong."
John glared back at the slave. If he were to bend now, he would lose all his credibility in the eyes of everyone at the scene. He used the cane to push between Holmes's shoulder blades and when the slave bowed a little deeper he moved it to push the back of Holmes's neck. Seconds seemed to drag by like hours, but finally there was one last shaky rebellious breath drawn before Holmes lowered his eyes and kowtowed to everyone's relief.
"Ah."
"Right. Time for us to go to bed, I guess", he said. "If you want to use the bathroom before it, do it now."
Lestrade helped him up, and one of the police slaves helped him out. By the time he got out in the crisp January night's air he was already walking straight without the other slave's support. The fact that his current weakness was caused not because of the drug in his system, but because of his mind betraying him was repulsive. No matter how normal it was, he loathed himself for letting the past affect him this way.
"It started about ten years ago," Sherlock replied truthfully. He needed to start preparing dinner.
"No. Just filling-in for a few nights."
The blanket and pillow he had purchased for Holmes on Friday were still in a bag under his bed, but because the slave had been behaving so well all day, it felt like a good moment to finally actually give them to Holmes that night. No law required John to give his slave either of them, although most people did present their slaves with more than the necessary space to sleep. Said space didn't need to be private. When it came to the slave's sleep and well-being, the law dictated several things: the space had to be large enough for the slave to sleep in fetal position. It had to be warm enough and undisturbed enough during the period of sleep for the slave to be able to rest, although all the details were vague as John had come to notice was the case with all the laws concerning any rights the slaves had. They could be bent easily.
"Yes, yes I am," a bewildered female voice confirmed. "And who are you? Why are you calling from Detective Inspector Lestrade's number?"
"I'm not sorry, but I apologise."
The driver merely sighed again. “Are you getting on or are you getting off?”
an assistant", Holmes insisted. "Someone who understands about forensics, a cleanup slave won't do. But not Anderson."
"I helped Angelo get off a murder charge a few years ago," he explained instead. He finally got his eyes off the window for a moment to tilt his head to look at Angelo from the corner of his eye. "Master Watson is my tenth owner."
If Sherlock were to name one pro amongst all the cons of being a slave it would be queuing. Free people were easily tempted to queue jump a slave, but the slaves were in an equal rush to fulfil their tasks. The solution was obvious –separate queues for slaves. Not every shop had them, and most not all the time, but one could almost certainly find one or two during the busiest hours. Scarce were the free people who would willingly go to a till that said "slaves only". Most rather queued than paid at the slaves' till even if offered the opportunity.
"Give it back, give it back! It's mine! They said it's mine!"
With pink cheeks Sherlock hurried into his room changing into one of his suits. Wearing his favourite purple shirt underneath the expensive blazer. Meeting John once again in the living room The taller man held out his shoes, “probably want these to love.”
Sherlock stayed stood in front of him waiting for him to tell him off or shout still. But it never came.
“It’s the brother!” He shouted jumping up from his seat quickly. Making John who had been sat opposite him listening to him ramble on for the past half an hour, jump.
“Okay then” he whispered the blush not fading. “I’m tired, I’m going to sleep for a while.” Sherlock quickly pulled away from John and ran to his room slamming the door. leaving John stood grinning to himself like an idiot.
“Sherlock have you made a nest?” John’s mouth was quirking up at the sides.
“Sherlock why don’t you go and shower and I’ll order us take out.” John asked quietly watching him stand staring into space. Snapping out of his head Sherlock nodded and scurried off to his room. After a quick shower and a change into his pyjamas and dressing gown Sherlock appeared in the living room looking at John as he unpacked the Chinese food.
“Oh go away, the stench is awful.” Sherlock knew the second the words left his mouth that they were very not good. The alpha had his hand around his throat in seconds and his other hand ripping at Sherlock’s clothes.
“And as for Mary she understood and we have arranged to finish our lunch another day.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock said quietly still staring at the man; Who just chuckled and scrunched his nose.
Turning in the little omegas arms John looked down at the top of his head that was now pressed to the centre of his collar bones. He could smell the vanilla shampoo strongly and smiled wrapping his arms around sherlock rubbing his back.
“Bees?”
Sherlock rounded the table and sat next to him his legs crossed underneath him, even though it was just a couple of inches John felt huge next to him. It made him feel small, all his life he hated being smaller than his brother and the other Alphas he worked with but he was glad John was bigger. It made him feel warm and safe.
“Together?”
‘Love’ the moment the simple word left Johns lips Sherlock turned into jelly his still bright cheeks glowing red and his stomach doing flips. Quickly clearing his throat and recovering from the momentary laps in stature Sherlock took his shoes and glared up at John.
“We Just had lunch John, how on Earth are you hungry again?”
Sitting up on his knees he reached for the fabric a small smile gracing his lips as he touched it his whole body went warm as if he was glowing. Slowly he pulled the fabric into his arms holding it to his chest pressing his nose to the collar of- what he could now see was- a cream jumper that was far to big to be his own. Inhaling a deep breath of the wonderful scent he melted back into his chair, holding it tightly to himself closing his eyes.
“I’m going home! sleepy! Night Alp- night John.” Sherlock ducked his head and was out the door leaving John just a little confused.
“In Sussex.”
The second thing he noticed was that Sherlock hadn’t left his room since his heat had ended. John could smell soap and a musky smell of the omegas heat but it was fading. Setting the take out down on the coffee table along side his keys John took off his coat hanging it up on the hook.
“Please John I hate to repeat myself if you’re going to live here I refuse to have to keep feeding your seemingly awful hearing.”
John tilted his head with a surprised look. “Afghanistan. That was brilliant.” He laughed his stance relaxing a little while Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes. “Sherlock we’ve talked about this.”
“Me?”
“Yes Sherlock a date with me, you’ve made a nest of my clothes for God’s sake. That’s what omegas do when they want to please their Alphas, show them they see them as suitable mates.” John was practically beaming.
Bored bored bored.
A gentle hand on his face was what snapped him back to reality jumping away from the contact he stared at the owner of the hand. John, John who looked worried and scared and angry and annoyed and very very pissed off. Ignoring the deductions Sherlock dived at him barely giving John chance to steady himself.
“Eat up love you’ll need the energy for the next few days.” John watched Sherlock pick at his food. “How are you feeling? It must have been scary today..” John spoke quietly his hand resting between them his pinky finger gently rubbing the fabric of Sherlock’s pyjamas.
Sherlock wasn’t listening he groaned loudly in frustration and flopped down in his chair. “Lestrade has taken away my morgue access! I’m not allowed to the crime scenes I can’t help Molly what am I supposed to do!”
“Eat breakfast and have a quiet day watching tv or reading?” John suggested handing Sherlock a mug of tea and a plate with some pastry’s on, “dont be dull John, I couldn’t think of anything more boring than the possibility of sitting around doing nothing all day.”
“Mrs Hudson got a phone call from Molly who saw you being carted away while she was visiting Lestrade. Mrs Hudson called me frantically about you being arrested again but with you this close to your heat it’s dangerous for you to be out the house without an alpha Sherlock.”
Sherlock had pulled on his blue silk dressing gown over the top of his suit feeling homely in the soft material, slumping down in his chair he huffed. He only then noticed the new addition of an arm chair in front of his, a small table next to it with a cold cup of coffee and a day old paper sat on the top. Tilting his head Sherlock noticed a woollen material poking out from the arm of the chair.
Sherlock felt nervous now, he never got nervous around John.. “yes it smells good i sleep for hours wrapped up in them.. I-is that bad.. do you need them back?”
With a chuckle John rolled his eyes and sent back a quick;
They slipped into a cafe just off Baker Street for a snack on the way home, it was late now. Around 1am, John could see the exhaustion on the omegas face and smiled gently, knowing he should speak in hushed tones and keep big movements to a minimum so he didn’t startle the tired boy.
“Are you going to sit down? I’m starving and i know you haven’t eaten all day.” John glanced up at him before leaning back on the sofa with his food.
“Ah Sherlock dear, I found you a flatmate!” She cheered clapping her hands together. Sherlock stared at her for a moment before tilting his head. “I never requested a flatmate Mrs Hudson. so why would you think I would wish for such a thing?”
“On a date.. with you?”
“If you don’t mind Sherlock my private life is mine so if you could keep your nose out it would be much appreciated.” John snapped, the alpha in him growling at the detective.
“You want my jumper?”
“John?-SH”
Sherlock sat on the living room floor of 221b listening to the police scanner, folding his new collection of stickers that Mrs Hudson, the landlady had brought him back from her trip to the craft shop. Being an alpha with no omega Mrs Hudson found pleasure in looking after the little genius. Much like Lestrade and Molly she enjoyed the look of joy and wonder that graced Sherlock’s face when he was given anything. Even though he never said thank you or gave anything back the little scent of gratitude that radiated from him was enough for them.
“The alpha will take the room Mrs Hudson now if you don’t mind I have work to do.” With that Sherlock scurried off to the kitchen to get the toes out of the microwave. Molly had been ever so helpful in offering him body parts lately, he knew it was her way of showing she would do anything for the little omega and her intention of wanting to mate him but Sherlock had shown no interest what so ever.
That’s what Sherlock did, he stayed in his bed surrounded by mostly Johns clothes. Before he had text John he had showered and put on fresh clothes his arms and legs scratched and slightly bruised from the past few days of Sherlock tugging at his skin trying to stop the burning.
“Mm maybe.”
“I hear you’re a little sloppy with the rent.” A gentle voice came, as the alpha stepped into the room all Sherlock’s senses heightened and he found himself intrigued by the taller man.
“Okay I’ll rephrase that, Sherlock love would you like to go on a date with me?”
“John this is becoming tedious.-SH”
“Are you coming home? -SH”
John stood up carefully and stepped toward the little blushing omega. Taking Sherlock’s hand he slipped off his jumper and lay it on Sherlock’s arm. John stood in his blue shirt watching as the omega quickly pull it up to his cheek scenting it.
“Then we will keep bees.”
“I’d like to retire and keep bees. They fascinate me, they’re so beautiful and interesting.”
Sherlock curled in on himself. Placing the plate down he quietly went to the kitchen to check on some experiments he had marinating in Petri dishes. After a while he stood up noticing John had gone out. A small pang of something ran through his chest making him whimper a little. Pouting Sherlock went to the door and slipped on his coat.
So slipping into the flat John hung up his coat and went to the kitchen to make himself a glass of water before heading off to bed. He didn’t make it to the kitchen, he had stopped in the doorway of the sitting room his eyes falling on the sleeping omega in the sitting chair.
“My name is sherlock, Please use it. I find pet names very exasperating..”
“I’ll be back in a few hours get some rest, I’ll bring lunch.”
“Where?”
“In Sussex.”
“How did you know where I was. It couldn’t have been Lestrade because he would have called mycroft and my next of kin on my paperwork is my mother.” Sherlock fiddled with his hands. “I also got arrested at lunch time meaning you were supposed to be on your date... “
Sherlock was confused he was used to being shouted at when he ruined plans or when he got in trouble but John was just being quiet and making him dinner.
With that Sherlock was wrapping his scarf around his neck and slipping on his coat.
John had come home at around 3am after popping over to check on Harry after her alpha called to tell him she had been drinking again and cut her head. Harry started drinking when she got with Clara and John blamed it on the fact that Clara wouldn’t bond her.
It was three days later that Sherlock Met the alpha again, he was moving boxes up into his room. Sherlock had been asleep on the sofa for god knows how long and the sound of John dropping a box made him startle awake. Scurrying to the kitchen to make sure none of his experiments had been compromised he sighed seeing John had just dropped a box of kitchen utensils.
“Yes”
“Okay Sherlock  it’s okay.” John soothed gently rubbing Sherlock’s back as he clung to him. “Let’s get you home.” Ignoring the shouts of the other Alphas in the cell block John carried The still shaking Sherlock out to the desk where he flashed his army badge and demanded Lestrade be informed of what happened.
Arriving home Sherlock set about clearing up his experiments, putting off his exhaustion wanting to keep his mind away from the heat fuelled dreams he was sure to endure. He needed to find something to occupy his brain.. maybe he could call Molly and ask for her key card and go to barts? Maybe get a chance to check over the fungus that was growing on the bottom of the Morgue fridge again.. actually maybe not Mollys superiors hadn’t been to happy about that the last time..
“That’s what I said.”
John clenched his fists and shook his head. His eyes squeezed closed as he stood up straight and marched toward the door noticing his scarf and blue fleece were missing. So without any protection from the wind or bitter cold John practically ran from the flat. Giving Mrs Hudson the heads up on his way out.
“Maybe it’s for the best love, let you get some rest and I can tell your heat will be here in a few days so Ill be going to stay with my sister. Get out of your hair.”
John just nodded his head watching Sherlock eat.
“Yes it smells nice. I’ve taken a few but this one you’ve warn a few days it smells very nice I’d like to sleep with it.” Sherlock explained bored, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
thing. He loathed the small part of himself that thought he was a failure if his new master didn't want to have sex with his new property right away. Was it the cooking? Was he being punished? Getting to sleep in your master's bed was supposed to be a great privilege, wasn't it? It was often only awarded for the head slave of the house, or a personal slave. So since Dr Watson had directed him to take a nap on his bed, Sherlock had assumed... Well, not assumed he'd be "rewarded" with a privilege, certainly not, but he'd thought that naturally John would have wanted to test him. And then perhaps just let him stay, even if it was a small bed, but there wasn't anything but the floor for him to sleep on. All his previous private owners had tested him, save from the first ones, but he had of course been too young at the time.
"I need to think."
"I never want to hear "Happy Birthday to You" again," Holmes replied.
"Perhaps," Sherlock agreed. "But my word against theirs doesn't matter. He said I should serve her and let her touch me because it was what they were paying for. I knew he was lying, of course. I didn't mean to kick him. I shouldn't have resisted in the first place."
"Roland-Kerr Further Education College," Sherlock told. The cabbie looked pleased with his answer, but truth to be told, he had been quite lost until the very last minutes. "Why here?"
John would let him, surely. He was so desperate for it. Sherlock would help him undress, make sure to brush against his skin as he did. Maybe pay him a compliment. He'd done it hundreds of times –calculatingly, convincingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"My gloves..." he started cautiously. "Can I have them back?"
John snorted. “I'm not calling you that..! Come on, I'm
He didn't and he soon wished he would have never learnt.
While unfortunate, it wasn't terribly uncommon for parents to sometimes sell their child or children to slavery. Especially if the father of the child had been a slave. If the mother was a slave, the child more or less automatically became a slave unless the freeman father wanted to make the child a legal person for some reason. Even free children were, in the eyes of the law, their parents' property until the age of twelve.
John chuckled. "I see. You're jealous because–"
Sherlock obeyed silently. There were things he would have wanted to voice, things he didn't agree with his master, but he wisely chose to keep his mouth shut. Better not to cause any more conflicts between them tonight, even if he had miscalculated and let the mask of dutiful slave slip again. He would lose any argument just as he had lost nearly all the arguments so far, just for the fact that he had no right to have an opinion.
"He's fine, he's just had a few," the cabbie assured a bystander and shoved Sherlock onto the taxi's floor.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and adopted a skeptical expression. The cabbie only looked amused.
"Even an idiot should see that", he spat out when the Detective Inspector reassured that people would be as safe as they wanted to be. The clip ended and the news anchor moved on to the next topic.
"Anyway, the slave," John went on. "She was old for a slave and had to be put down. We never got a new one. My mum said it was either a car or a new slave."
Mycroft's eyebrows drew together. "Scared? Sherlock, if you would let me in on this–"
"Your file didn't say anything about that."
"A sniper..?"
John sighed. Perhaps it was just better to ask than mull over it forever.
"Can I–" John swallowed back the sentence. He did
That night Sherlock dreamt of his parents. Of the night they died, the night that had changed everything. Of happier days and Redbeard. Mycroft was there, too, though he was an adult looming over him and Sherlock still a child.
"You can cry all night if you want, but it won't change a thing," she announced. She leant down to look him straight in the eye. "If you sabotage this sale, I will hurt you like you've never been hurt before. Do I make myself clear?"
John nodded and straightened his back. "Alright. Good. You can get up and make that coffee now. Which you would've already done by now if you'd just obeyed in the first place. And now that I think of it, I'm actually a little hungry, too. Make that a coffee and a sandwich. There's duct tape in the drawer, I'm sure you can find it. Tape your mouth shut, serve me my coffee and then you can go back 'updating' or whatever it was you were doing. And if this happens again, I
"I told you. That bloody animal could've broken my jaw!" Ryan exclaimed.
"What?"
"Oh god, you would've," John groaned. "You defy your owners to prove a point. You risk your health and safety to feel clever."
John spoke little. They mutually avoided each other on the days Sherlock was to leave with strangers. Only the television provided some background noise while they ate and the longest conversation they had was when Sherlock asked to be allowed to leave the house the following day.
He soon reappeared, trailing a woman perhaps in her late sixties or early seventies. She beckoned them in and as soon as the door had closed behind them, pulled Holmes into a tight embrace, which the slave returned awkwardly. John had no time to warn her or tell him off. He gaped at her.
John could only gape at him.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose in distaste. "Of course not."
"I could've got a hundred pound fine for that," John exclaimed, slapping the side of Holmes's head. The slave brushed the spot annoyedly with his gloved hand.
"99OR-79/4J4B, three minutes to strip. We start by filling the auction hall A." His bag was thrown in and the door closed again.
“Bored..!” he groaned out loud when he heard approaching footsteps from the corridor. Maybe they would hear and even bang the door while they passed by. “BORED!”
"I suppose we'll have to talk here then," Mycroft said, letting himself in. He stopped in front of the dining table and regarded the room with distaste. "Charming little home you have."
"How did that happen?" he prompted, digging into his eggs.
The last time, the final time, when Sherlock had been helping Greg's team had ended with him in a hospital. His owner, who after a lot of persuasion had agreed on borrowing Sherlock, had arrived to pick him up mere minutes after everything at the scene was over. Very much in the same manner John Watson had tonight.
"You've already drugged me," Sherlock argued. "If you wanted me dead you could have done it already. Why would I choose either?"
Bored. So
"Holmes?"
"Sher– what?"
John chuckled amusedly. "I'm gonna have to buy you a cook book."
"Oh for god's sake!" Holmes interrupted loudly. "Four people have been
"Somehow I find it hard to believe you would've cared."
"I hope so..." he muttered, not really meaning what he said. He felt indifferent.
", John growled at the man,
"Mrs Hudson, how are you?" he practically beamed to the phone and after a second confirmed: "Yes, it's me."
"I lost you money. I made you look bad."
John nodded his acknowledgment and tapped Holmes's arm with the cane. The man stood up instantly, dusting his coat utterly unprepared for his master slapping his face. John grabbed the lapel of his coat and pulled him closer.
because of you."
And even if he could somehow miraculously find Mycroft, there was no home for them to go to. What good would it do for him to return when the house would be empty, his parents remained dead, their house slaves handed to others?
“I can’t do that, I just got him. He doesn’t even know where I live.”
Most house slaves, especially personal slaves and bed slaves slept in the same room with their master or mistress. Under the bed was a popular spot if the room didn't have slave cupboard, but John's bed didn't have a slave space, and was thus too low for Holmes to sleep under it. Quite frankly, he didn't want a slave sleeping under his bed. Just having him in the same room felt odd enough. Holmes seemed happy enough with the floor, or at least he hadn't complained. John was fairly certain Holmes was the kind of slave who would make it known if he thought his meagre rights were neglected.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mistress," Sherlock wailed as he clung onto her. No, he didn't want to have Hunny hurt him. And as months went by he realised he didn't want to worry his mistress or hurt her feelings, either. He loved playing the violin. He loved learning and absorbing knowledge of all things imaginable. More than he feared being beaten he feared she would take him the music and the books.
"Well someone's been gossiping", the forensics officer scoffed. "Was it Sally?"
He looked across the room. His eyes hadn't yet adjusted to the dark, but he could make the shape of Holmes next to the fireplace, the coat pulled over his shoulders.
It had been his sad duty to assure the soon to be dead slaves that yes, they had been very useful indeed and that no it wouldn't hurt at all.
"You're a slave," the Detective Inspector continued without acknowledging his request. "And even if you weren't, you can't just go looking for evidence on your own and take it!"
"Apologies," the slave muttered and bowed his head.
He reached back into his pocket and placed an identical bottle on the table. "Weren't expecting that, we you?"
"I–I... This is bad. This is
"So no trouble at all?"
Sherlock was still a slave astray, but he was too tired, too panicked and too nauseous to care. He'd find a way to get back to John's flat later. It was safer for a slave to move in daylight anyway. He'd be stopped far less likely. So surely he could rest for a minute or two. He was tired, so tired...
Holmes was nowhere to be seen when John opened the door. He tried calling, but the slave did not show up. After stepping further into his flat, it became clear that Holmes wasn't in the flat at all. Cursing under his breath he wobbled around the single room, unrealistically hoping the slave would magically turn up. He didn't.
Holmes merely mumbled something incoherent and pulled the blanket tighter around himself.
was that he plays the violin," John fumed. "He entertains you. He serves the drinks. He gets to have a wash, is fed and sleeps in peace until morning.
"No, never. He doesn't talk much about his previous owners."
“Well, if you don’t have any questions...” Ms Bruce prompted. Last chance to get the slave switched.
The next section described Holmes's physical aspects very much in the same way pedigree dogs were described: how his muscles were, the type of bone structure he had, the condition of his teeth and hair, which hand he preferred, medical history and also an embarrassingly figurative description of his sex organs and sexual performance. John skipped it entirely, not feeling like reading it while Holmes was less than ten feet away from him. Notes said Holmes had a sensitive fingers and scalp, which were considered a positive trait. After all, should he behave badly, those were excellent places to hurt him.
" he sneered, hitting the slave's scarred back with all the strength he had.
The slave rose and the lights went off with a murmured: "Goodnight, master."
Mike look dumbfounded. "Can you have him changed?"
"No. I was an investment, but my owners didn't have children."
"Usually a new owner, they want to- Well, they want to have a, uh, test ride. I didn't mean to sound like I
Sherlock gave Mycroft an equally judging look from head to toe. His brother was certainly well-off for a slave.
"And what are slaves?"
He didn't want to go through the events of that night, he never did, but the fleeting memories both from the dream and reality would tangle up in his head until he acknowledged them.
"Take them off
"There's lot you could do to ensure he keeps you," Mycroft said, eyeing his surroundings.
"And you were about to sabotage the whole thing. Everyone was aware of my position. You didn't need to make scene of it," Holmes argued. "Punish me later. We haven't got time for that now."
Holmes looked at him with a raised eyebrow. "Have you ever met a free person who wouldn't have a mobile phone in today's world? Whose number would she have on the luggage tag if not her own?"
can catch the killer."
The Sergeant gave him a pitying look. "Poor sod, I hope you can still have him changed", she muttered, then continued to her walkie-talkie: "Lestrade's found the freak, I'm bringing them in."
Had Sherlock been in his slave mode, he would have flinched at the cabbie's tone. But at the moment he wasn't a slave. At the moment they were equals. He could look at his abductor in the eye with confidence he rarely got to show without severe consequences.
She nodded approvingly. "Do you like working for my husband's company?"
Holmes instantly scrambled up on his feet from the floor where he'd been on all fours. "Good morning, master", he greeted cautiously. He lifted his hand and gave a little wave with a toothbrush. "I'm cleaning the bathroom as master ordered me to."
Holmes flinched at his tone, but John only closed his eyes for a moment before continuing in a much calmer tone: "Listen...I wouldn't want to be a slave. Of course I wouldn't. But slaves...they're slaves. They have their place in the world. I mean... You have a purpose."
"Bloody hell, it really is you", Lestrade marvelled. "Where on earth have you been?"
"Alright... It says I'm your tenth owner."
–" John shook his head. He couldn't really get mad, not with how absurd the situation was. Holmes was smirking at him and joined him in laughter a moment later.
"Yes, but he's not here now." The car moved immediately after the door closed. A click of the locks made it painfully obvious that he was trapped. The wall between the back of the car and the driver had been risen, and John realised there was a camera in each corner of it.
He tried calling for Holmes, but no reply came. Should he go in? Search the yard first? Holmes could be lying somewhere unconscious.
"I'm not allowed to leave without permission," he told. Not only a convenient excuse, but also the truth. "Get out."
He slumped on the sofa. Shit, shit,
Holmes swallowed the last of his coffee. "Why shouldn't I? Although whether or not I enjoy doing things isn't important, I actually do enjoy playing the violin and doing chemical experiments. If there is a chance that something I enjoy doing could profit you financially, why should I keep you in the dark? Your financial situation is painfully obvious. You can barely afford this flat with your pension and it looks like your job hunting isn't going very well."
Neither had moved for several minutes now. Sherlock still stared at the ceiling. He could feel Mycroft's eyes on him, but there was nothing either of them wanted to say. Then Mycroft stood up and walked out of the door. Sherlock remained as he was for four more minutes, lost in thought, hating the fact that his brother was right. He got up only to crouch on the floor to dig out the dirty sock under John's chair. He found an extra plate that still had a half eaten biscuit on it –and the other sock.
His master cleared his throat and Sherlock could imagine John's tongue darting out to lick his lower lip. Nervous. Uncertain. He'd been sitting on the computer all night, typing painstakingly slowly every so often. After finishing with the dishes Sherlock had thrown himself on the sofa, one leg over the armrest, one foot on the floor. Practically on display, but John had just frowned over his laptop. Oh he had looked at him, probably stared at him for minutes at a time while he lay with his eyes closed, but there was nothing carnal about his gaze. Mistress Summers would've smirked and walked right up to him to claim her property had he pulled the same stunt for her. She would have enjoyed combining sex and punishing him for daring to lounge on the sofa.
It took an annoying eighteen minutes for the laptop to turn on, the browser to start, the web page to load and for him to come up with a new password for his jhwatson account the InS site insisted him to do before letting him get any further. Then there was wall of text in the form of Terms and Conditions he scrolled by quickly without reading.
Sherlock had known that master and mistress were currently a little short on cash, but it had never crossed his mind that they might consider selling his virginity. It wasn't even worth that much, considering he wasn't a female. Much more money revolved around that particular business. He had of course wondered how come either mistress or master hadn't yet seized the opportunity, but he'd only assumed, with great relief, that they weren't interested. That Hannah was enough to keep them happy in the bedroom.
This was all he had. Lydia Marlowe was all he had left in the world –and he didn't quite remember why he'd thought any other way would be better. It wasn't such a bad life after all.
"They're not suicides", Sherlock immediately contradicted. "They are murders."
"Why'd you say that?" he questioned, turning back at her.
"No it's not. I'm a doctor, I know how to sprain an arm."
head slave." While it was alright for people to hit a slave they didn't own, a slave could not do the same to another slave unless they were specifically ordered to, or were named the head of all the slaves in the house. Which Mycroft was at his mistress's household.
He was a bad kid, wasn't he? He still didn't understand why, but Mycroft had told him it was secret Daddy was friends with the cellist. He'd let the secret out, and Mummy and Daddy had both been angrier than he'd ever seen them. And they were both dead now. Dead because Sherlock had not known to keep his mouth shut.
Holmes scrambled up hastily and nearly threw himself on his knees. "
"I'm not a slave," Sherlock said angrily.
Sherlock pulled down the shirt to cover the red marks on his back where the sharp pain was already turning into a dull ache. It was his pride rather than his back that suffered the worst. John didn't seem to expect him to thank him for the punishment, so Sherlock saw no reason to open his mouth or even bow.
She meant the bankruptcy, but it was too raw and painful, too embarrassing for her to say it out loud. So Sherlock just nodded, letting her know he understood. He didn't want for her to have to say it.
Mrs Hudson touched her forehead briefly, and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
"No, master. John. I didn't think it was my place to do so without your consent." He bowed subtly before obeying his order to join him at the table.
But what would normal
"I was disobedient and disrespectful," he continued, words catching in his throat. "It was wrong and I'm very sorry I caused trouble for my mistress and master."
How had he missed he was on sale? How had he not realised it was the next logical step for his owners to take? He should have seen it coming. He had been blind.
Holmes lifted an eyebrow. It was a silent challenge, John knew it, but goddammit he didn't want to flog anyone. He didn't even own a whip or a cane or anything yet! Clearly he needed to add that to his shopping list. He grit his teeth in annoyance and ran his fingers through his hair. He should have anticipated something like this, he really should have. He'd read the damn file about Holmes! Strict rules, control and physical disciplining.
"Did you come all this way to ask me that?"
"How's the blog going?"
Sherlock did not reply.
Billy helped him in his dressing gown and together they descended downstairs. He could hear a buzzing sound from Mrs Hudson's doorbell.
How angry she had been. Not mad at him, no. She was the only one defending him. He had never seen such disappointment in Mycroft's eyes before. Never seen such hatred in his father's.
“Er, no thanks, I trust everything’s alright.”
"What did my slave do that warranted drenching and beating him up?"
John stopped abruptly at the slave's plea for mercy. Holmes had screamed, but he hadn't said a word until now.
"InS thought I was too much trouble for them to handle."
"Only on principle." Mycroft shook his head. "Sherlock. You're not getting a better owner. If I were you–"
"I'm sorry young man, but I cannot help you," the InS official said, shaking his balding head. Pityingly, yet firmly. "The waiting period in cases like yours is a month. That's 31 days and not a day over. You already got extra days because of the holidays. The line has to be drawn somewhere."
Sherlock nodded, still sobbing into his hands. No matter how much he wanted to, he wouldn't dare to try to ruin his sale. "Just tell me why," he pleaded again. At least that he had to know.
"Yeah? Sorry about that then. But we're one worker short if he's here."
"Oh." Lestrade shrugged. "Apparently there's something he can do right."
"Quite clear", Holmes replied with a sickeningly sweet smile. "Is your wife away for long? Did she take the slave with her?"
"Hang on", John interrupted. "Do
"I know," he eventually said. "Believe me, I do. But I can't. I'm not like you, and I won't become like you."
"No, absolutely impossible", the slave muttered, biting his lip. After a while of thinking he said, very carefully: "What if I said I knew a place? Here, in London. Around the same price you pay now, maybe a bit more, but a much better location and better rooms."
Sherlock knelt down to sit on his knees.
"Do you understand?"
"How does that prove anything? We don't know anything about their lives, only what's been said on the papers. Most suicides come as a shock."
Well. Sherlock had proven them wrong. Greg could only hope Sherlock would finally settle for his standing in the society, and that his new owner, Dr Watson, would treat him well.
"Excellent." Mrs Marlowe turned back to her guest. "So, do we have a deal?"
His brother had arrived entirely unannounced. Sherlock opened the door and then tried to close it right into Mycroft's face the moment he recognised him.
"And some of them get no warmth whatsoever," Mycroft replied. Holmes's scowl only deepened and John, really not knowing what to say, started considering a hasty retreat to the kitchen.
He watched them walk away, side by side, and though he could not be sure, he could have sworn he heard laughter.
Sherlock cleared his throat. John turned to look up at him, and he leant down to close the case and took it away.
"My purpose is to serve," Sherlock spat out the words. His fists were shaking now, it was no use. If he hadn't been a slave for so long, he would have marched out of the room and slammed the door behind him, but years of feigning submission and the knowledge of consequences kept him kneeling on the floor.
"Oh. Well, I don't think I caught
"Almost a year", he replied. With all the shipments in and out it was easy to keep a track of the dates. Horrifyingly so. There was no escape from the knowledge of how long he had been here.
"H-Holmes!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?"
, how many emancipated slaves do you know?"
John sat on the edge of bed and eyed at the case curiously while Holmes took his towel to the bathroom. He didn't touch the instrument, though. It belonged to Holmes and John had no right to take it. But he had to wonder how Holmes had come to own such a thing. Slaves rarely owned anything and most commonly clothes or cheap accessory. He didn't know anything about violins, but this particular one didn't look new. It was in good conditions, at least to his eyes. According to Holme's papers it was antique and looking at it now that was easy to believe. The case was newer, but not new either. It had a small metal plate with letters S.H. engraved to it.
"No, but she's wearing your deodorant", Holmes replied without batting an eye. "Can I go,
"No, no, no, look
Sherlock stayed stubbornly silent. Despite how Sherlock had been younger when they were sold, it was Mycroft who had adjusted better. Logically, it should have been Sherlock, and yet he still struggled in all the wrong ways. But it hadn't always been so.
to stay in London, he rationalised. Because I need for John to keep me.
"I found you the murderer, what does it matter?" he argued irritably. "I told you where it is. John will be happy to get rid of it."
He didn't fight when Sandy gently pulled him away. They watched through the window how Redbeard was loaded into a car and taken away. She pulled him into a tight embrace.
"If he didn't know I'm a slave, then perhaps..."
"Of what? How to best wash the dishes? With soap, I hope."
"I'm just a slave, Sherlock. InS will find me a new owner, too. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Just take care of yourself. Be good to your owners."
Holmes was returned to him soon after eleven the next morning by a hungover lad in his mid-twenties.
"I'm not selling him."
They had to strip all their clothes for medical examination, and they took Mycroft to a separate room at his request. At the time Sherlock thought it was because of his leg. Only much later in life did it dawn upon him that it had been because Mycroft wished not to speak of his sexual performance in front of his little brother, or have him witness the related physical examinations. They were interviewed for what felt like forever. They had to answer endless questions about their educations, skills and hobbies to determine what they might be useful for. Mycroft did most of the talking. How he remained so calm and civil was a mystery. Sherlock did his best to mimic him, but he hated everything and everyone. He missed Mummy and Daddy. He missed Redbeard and he missed Sandy.
"What would you need an e-mail account for?"
Sherlock didn't bother to pay any attention to it. He had had worse than a little smugness thrown at him. "Coffee or tea?" he wanted to know instead.
"Why?"
"Back in your mistress's favour then?"
He remembered the gunshot and the blood and brains splattering on the hot tarmac.
"What happened? Is Mrs Hudson alright?" he urged, already standing up, ready to leap in action and find his medical supplies.
Sherlock was shivering all over and
"Maybe I should save for a car, then…" John muttered. Even if he didn't have a car, it might be a good idea to pay for Holmes's licence renewal at some point. He kept reading. The file was divided in several sections. The first part contained the general information concerning the slave: ID-number (tattooed on the left wrist in numbers and letters, but also in bar code form, which was quite rare these days), sex, height, eye and hair colour, slavery status (C, which stood for "enslaved as a child", rather than B meaning "enslaved as an adult" or A "born as a slave"), number of previous owners (nine?!)…
His eyes met hers. "No, not really", he admitted.
Mycroft had said that. Mycroft was smart and he was always right. Mycroft always kept his promises. He would come and save him. He had to. He'd said he would.
go on without it, so please, please how about it, sir? Ma'am? Wouldn't you take a look at my menu?
ride a cab on your own! Did you
"Why would you need to
"I'm just going to fall asleep on the floor if you make me bow now," Holmes said between grit teeth.
"It's a property crime," Sherlock countered, though he hated to admit the fact that should the man succeed in killing him, it would not be a murder. It wouldn't even be a manslaughter. If he died, he would become a pitiful piece of destroyed property.
"What do you think I should rent you for?"
"You know he's not. Otherwise you wouldn't have come."
do to have him react like that?"
John arched an eyebrow half amusedly, half as a challenge. The man looked like he could snap a poker in half with his bare hands. "And what did
"If you cannot speak with respect, you shouldn't speak at all," he was told and disciplined for daring to insult his owners. They silenced him with a muzzle. Like the slave collar around his neck, it was impossible to remove without an extra pair of hands.
"Neither do I," Mycroft agreed silently. For all his cleverness, Sherlock was still just a frightened little boy about to lose the last remaining person he was familiar with. And Mycroft couldn't feign much courage at the moment, either, but for Sherlock's sake he had to try. For Sherlock's sake he had to submit to this immediately, so that Sherlock would see his example and hopefully manage to adjust to his new life better.
Sherlock’s cheeks were burning red, his ears the same. A fire had lit in his chest much different from the burning sensation he had been trying to get rid of the past week.
It was a day later, John was getting ready to go shopping when Sherlock started crying out from his room. John had bolted toward the kitchen at first before forcing himself to stop as the scent of Sherlock in heat hit him. A sweet yet fresh smell hit his nose, “John! Y-you n—need — AHH — need to g-go” Sherlock shouted.
Alphas were known to be careless a lot of the time, especially with sleepy omegas. When an omega is tired they can drop off in a split second yet if an alpha even laughs loudly in their proximity the omega is suddenly awake and unable to sleep again. Part of the biology that John had come to hate while he was in Afghanistan the poor omega nurses and doctors he shared the compound with would go days without sleep after a late night drill or an injured alpha who was in so much pain he couldn’t care any less about some omegas sleeping pattern.
“Sherlock would you like to go out to dinner with me?”
“Sherlock I’m home!” John called not wanting to get to close to the omegas room; even if his heat was over, the scent in that room would be to much for him to stand. So he stayed in the living room, he had turned to get the take out trays out of the bag when he felt a small thud against his back and delicate arms wrap around his waist. Sherlock nuzzled his cheek into the back of Johns jumper humming with his eyes closed.
“Morning John.” Sherlock mumbled frowning down at his phone his fingers typing a thousand letters a second. John was stood in the door way with a paper under his arm. He had woken up an hour or so before the little omega and had headed out the get some breakfast for them both.
Sherlock was to sleepy to protest the pet name and then suddenly to concerned with the fact that John could tell when his next heat would be. Standing abruptly Sherlock grabbed his scarf from the table nearly knocking his half empty mug of tea flying.
"With a taxi."
“I’ll be back by half five. Just…” John shrugged helplessly. “I don't know, make yourself familiar with the room and do…whatever it is you do. And, um… Have me something to eat by the time I’m back.”
She walked out of the room, leaving him to dress in privacy. Sherlock did as ordered and gathered all his belongings in one place. He didn't have much. The only thing he truly owned was the violin. Everything else —clothes, shoes, collars, pillow, blankets, towels, personal hygiene products— they all belonged to his owners. Mistress would go through them to determine what would go with him as part of his sale.
"Oh no, my mistress is not interested in him", the strange slave assured, examining the tip of his umbrella. "This is purely between myself and him."
"You are British", he stated boldly. He should have kneeled, he shouldn't have looked at her directly, but for a moment he was his old self.
Holmes grimaced. "No, it wasn't."
"Of course. Thank you, John," Sherlock said with a small, respectful bow.
"Yeah, but we were tracking you," Lestrade pointed out. "How would've he known?"
For the first time since their arrival Holmes turned his full attention to John. "Master?"
The cabbie's eyes met his through the mirror. "You've got yourself a fan."
"You know each other?" he demanded, irritated by his slave talking to a stranger and ignoring his master.
He'd of course heard what InS did to escapees, but he'd never seen the damage up close. It must have been excruciatingly painful –or so he'd heard. He had not interest to ever witness it, much less experience it.
Holmes wasn't intimidated in the slightest. "I came back, didn't I? I was not aware I wasn't allowed to leave the flat."
"It says you've been a slave since you were ten."
"John Watson, we met earlier tonight. Owner of Holmes."
from my property! So you're not sleeping until you've properly apologised and been disciplined!"
Sherlock grunted and waved the comment off with his right hand. The left he kept on his lap, out of sight. The disorientation faded a little again.
"Plan or not, I'm not allowing this!"
"If you could what?"
The slave's eyes did not avert. "Yes, I understand."
"Sherlock, what have you done?"
Holmes just grunted incoherently, but didn't seem to oppose the idea.
or alternatively
He laughed, so John laughed with him.
