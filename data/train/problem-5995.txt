“PETER!” Tony yelled down the phone, making Steve jump away from the wall. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph, don’t you kids answer your God damn phones anymore? Not even Loki’s answering his phone and he’s glued to the damn thing!” he squealed, voice rising higher and higher with each word.
Bruce sighed. “Just trust me, Tony. Creating this dinosaur will bring this park to a whole other level.”
Steve turned to Bruce who knew something wasn’t right just by his change of expressions. “The tree frog,” Steve began, Tony listening in closely. “It has the ability to hide its own thermal temperature, right?” Bruce nodded slowly, already knowing what was coming. “We couldn’t find the Foniassaurus on the infrared, but she was right there in front of our eyes.”
About an hour after that, they ordered Thai from Peter’s favorite place a few blocks over and shared a quiet dinner. Peter didn’t open up any more about his day. After dinner, he took a shower before retreating to his room again, claiming he still had schoolwork to finish.
But now here Tony was, asleep and distraught, a scene familiar both from their shared past and from the last two years of Steve’s own life. Two halves of Steve warred within him: One part of him wanted to comfort Tony and never let him go. They could fix this, couldn’t they? After all this time, after Thanos, surely, they could fix this one thing. The other part of him was reminding him that thinking like that was dangerous, stupid, potentially deadly. Even if Tony forgave him, what would happen when they just started bickering again tomorrow?
(Tony didn’t want to think that Steve was capable of such a thing, but given the other betrayals he had experienced, he had low expectations) - but there was nothing to follow up that ominous statement, just fuzzy silence. It took Tony about thirty full seconds to realize the call had been dropped.
lab? What if he’s not really a reporter? What if this is corporate espionage?” Pepper raised an eyebrow. Tony put his coffee down, keeping it a careful distance from her laptop. “Okay, I didn’t mean to make it sound quite that much like a conspiracy theory.”
I'll try to get the next chapter up this weekend since I was so late posting this one! :) Thanks again for reading! You can find me @marvelsmostwanted on Tumblr.
Tony half-smiled, looking down at their interlocked fingers. “Pete was mad at me before he left,” he admitted. “I don’t know if he’ll be so happy with me when he gets back.”
“Well, you boys seem to have this under control,” Tony said in a forced casual voice. “I have to go. JARVIS?” The suit re-formed itself around him, and he took off as soon as it was on.
“Unknown number calling, sir,” the AI’s voice rang out. It had barely finished before Tony just lunged for the phone and pressed to his ear. “Hello?” He demanded, heart pounding as he put the call on speaker. He was hoping to hear Peter’s voice, but -
“No,” Peter insisted. “Plus, even if he did mention it, I wouldn’t have just told him I’m Spider-Man.” They both glanced around when he said that aloud even though there was no one else there. Peter lowered his voice a bit anyway. “I’m not going to give away any secrets, Mr. Stark. They’re my secrets, remember? I don’t exactly want anything suspicious in the newspaper. I won’t tell him."
A puzzle was coming together in Tony’s head, and it was forming a picture that he did not like. At all.
“Actually, I’m not doing anything,” Peter piped up, stepping around Tony so that Steve could see him better. “I’m free for an interview right now if you want.”
Luckily, they were by themselves; it seemed that people were lingering at the party. Tony was feeling impulsive. As soon as he pressed the button for his floor, he turned to Steve, planning to pick up right where he left off. Then, the elevator doors closed and much to Tony’s surprise, Steve grabbed
They started to make their way back to the elevator, Pepper chattering away about the breakthrough science happening at Stark Industries due to their multi-million dollar lab facilities and the genius at the helm of R&D, Tony Stark himself (she always had to stop herself from rolling her eyes at that part, but it was in the script).
Steve was actually blushing, but he recovered quickly. “Tony, you should know that, legally or not… I was already yours.”
“You know why I don’t want a reporter in here snooping around,” Tony replied with his arms crossed over his chest. He gestured to where Peter had just been standing. “If he gets any idea -
Three sets of footsteps entered the room. Peter tried to do a convincing impression of an unconscious person, but he felt like his heart was going to beat right out of his chest. He worried that his hands might be shaking. Luckily, the men didn’t seem to notice, too busy snapping at one another.
“I am Nebula,” she said perfunctorily. “You should know that I am the sister of Gamora, and the child of Thanos.” She said it like she wanted to get it over with, and that more than anything made Steve receive the words with more confusion than alarm.
Pepper was actually relieved to hear that she wasn’t the only one who was finding this whole thing tedious. “Yes,” she said smoothly. “In fact, we can head back to my office now.” They were actually right on time - it was almost as if Michelle knew that, despite the fact that she wasn’t wearing a watch. Hm. Pepper could use an assistant who knew how to manage their time, even if she did seem a little impatient.
“He is no threat to you here,” Strange explained. “It seems that all of our powers are limited in the Soul World, and he is severely wounded. I brought him here because he knows more about this place than we do. He’s been here longer.”
He wanted to know how much Tony had heard. He wanted to know what Tony was thinking. Most of all, though, he wanted to help. Because before he could fix things with Tony, they had to find Peter.
Before, it was a hole in space and Loki haunting his dreams, and then it was the visions that Wanda had put in his head, of death and destruction and nothing he could do to stop it. After Ultron, Tony was different. He was just scared, so scared, and Steve knew it, but he couldn’t help but grow frustrated when Tony would pretend otherwise: It was never fear making decisions for him; it was for Pepper. It wasn’t paranoia; it was just an experiment. It wasn’t guilt; it was only logical to sign the Accords.
Peter’s face flushed. He was perched on the lab bench, and he kicked his feet out like a little kid as he spoke. “I ran out of web fluid.”
Peter looked properly ashamed, puppy eyes and all, but the only thing he said was, “Please don’t tell Aunt May.”
Most of them just looked starstruck. At Pepper’s pointed glare, Tony finally dropped the act and said, “Well, kids, have a good time. The chocolate waterfall is on the tenth floor. Don’t fall in.” Tony intentionally brushed by Pepper before he left. “I really could build a rocket launcher, you know," he said so only she could hear.
Peter had come home upset. He had slammed the door and tossed his bag on the floor before he realized that she was home early, and then he immediately dropped his frown and greeted her with a forced smile instead.
“- therefore, you are mine.” He realized how that sounded, and backtracked. “I mean, like, legally.”
The only benefit to the challenge of finding Steve was that it meant Steve likely hadn’t realized he was being followed. Unless, Tony thought darkly, he’d been trained to shake a tail. “Scanning for facial recognition,” said JARVIS. “This may take up to 30 minutes given heavy crowds.” Tony groaned. Steve chose the perfect place to disappear: Central Park on a sunny day. There were thousands of people in the immediate area and it would take forever to sort through them all. Before giving up, he decided to continue on foot. He couldn’t have gotten that far.
As Peter descended the stairs, more and more people - students, professors, harried-looking scientists - joined the chaos, looking for an exit. Peter was almost there when he literally ran into Ms. Potts. “Oh, Peter - thank God -” She was clutching a clipboard to her chest, and even as they were pushed a few more steps down the stairs, she managed to check him off a list. “Have you seen Michelle? I think she was listening to a presentation on the 14th floor…” Peter didn't even catch the rest of her sentence before he was dashing back upstairs. “Peter!” He heard Ms. Potts call after him, but he was too busy looking at every face he passed, and too worried because none of them were MJ. Those spiders could crawl up walls, and they were going fast. Clearly, they hadn't found the stairs yet, but it was possible that they had reached the upper floors already. Peter had been one of the first ones to react; he or Pepper would have seen MJ if she'd come down already. Which meant she was still upstairs. He was out of breath by the time he reached the eighth floor again, and he could hear loud clicking outside the stairwell. He pushed down the wave of fear and kept going.
“He didn’t ask about Oscorp,” Peter said between bites. “He just asked boring stuff. What school I went to, what subjects I was interested in, why I wanted the internship. That sort of thing.”
May shook her head in confusion. “Wait, back up. He was with you?” Her expression changed subtly from fearful to concerned. “He seemed upset when he came home,” she said, her tone not exactly accusatory, but not blameless either.
Steve recognized it from his past as an army prop, when he would spend long days performing for crowds and feeling like a circus monkey half the time. He knew how it felt to be exhausted and wired at the same time. It was hard to constantly put on a smile. To be surrounded by people who thought you were something you were not.
The quiet apartment suddenly seemed eerie. “Peter?” May said one more time before she tried the door. It was unlocked. It swung open to reveal an empty room.
Tony didn't realize it at the time, but that night, he accidentally adopted New York City's youngest superhero.
“Yeah,” said the girl. What was her name again? Pepper would have to check her list. Michaela? Michelle? “I’m not in a rush or anything, but are the interviews going to start soon? There’s a protest I’d like to get to by noon.”
“Wait,” said Steve. “So doesn’t that mean that people who wanted it could keep sacrificing their loved ones to get the Stone?”
Bruce fumbled the phone in his hand, and then his eyes widened. “It’s Tony,” he said quickly, before pressing the phone to his ear.
Even though the call clearly said not to search for Peter, Tony’s first reaction was, “Can you trace the call?”
And of course, the arc reactor. That, Steve drew with careful attention. He didn’t know what it was at first, but he could tell easily enough that it was a replacement for a heart. It wasn’t difficult to assume that the technology was keeping Tony alive.
“What about him?” Peter whispered, glancing over Tony’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark, I didn’t realize - wait, what is he even doing here?” His tone shifted from apologetic to suspicious. “It’s like, one in the morning.”
They were both struggling to cope, but underneath the grief, there was restlessness. The silence that had fallen after the snap was growing louder each day.
MJ rolled her eyes, and Peter almost laughed except then the spider turned on them. Shit. It moved so quickly that they both started backing away, and it abruptly became clear that it was going for MJ and her bigger chair. With his heart in his throat, Peter lunged from the side and crushed it with his chair, putting all of his weight behind it.
“As a matter of fact, you can, Ms. Potts,” said Tony, doing his best to act like someone who was normally awake at this hour. “I just stopped by to see what was on the agenda for today.”
“Hey, Pep, who’s this?” Tony’s voice sounded strained even to his own ears. He couldn’t help it; he wasn’t used to people intruding on his space or his… Peter and Bruce. (He did not think of them as a small science family. He did not.)
Tony didn’t usually handle the interns. He hadn't really been impressed with the selection of teenagers thus far. Most of them just gaped at all of the lab equipment and had no idea how to use it. Even the microscopes, once. Who didn't know how to use a microscope? When Pepper explained that the whole point of the internship was for them to learn something from it, Tony scoffed and decided to let Bruce handle the baby scientists from now on.
Tony sighed. “I know that.” Spider-Man had made a few headlines here or there, but that was different. If Peter’s name, or his face, were in the New York Times? That put him in a whole different kind of danger. Tony thought of how Peter refused to even tell his aunt about his powers because of how scared he was to put her in danger, and he barely refrained from a shudder. It would be a disaster for everyone involved if Peter’s secret got out.
“That dude,” Tony said, looking over his shoulder to a middle-aged man in a fedora walking a poodle, “
Steve hoped he had emphasized to Pepper that he meant no ill will, and she seemed to trust him. She also seemed to run things. That was working to his advantage so far. He wondered if Pepper could convince Tony to trust him, but he doubted it.
Pepper could practically feel the anxiety radiating from the group of potential interns standing in front of her, glancing around nervously at the huge atrium in the lobby of Stark Industries. They were here for a brief tour, followed by individual interviews in her office to determine which two of them would actually make it. One of the new interns would work in the labs, and one would work in administration with Pepper. The lab intern was supposed to work directly for Tony, which meant they received hundreds of applications for the position, but seeing as the man was rarely spotted outside of his workshop, it was unlikely that they would even meet him. The interns usually ended up working with Dr. Bruce Banner instead, which was a less stressful but equally valuable experience as working for Tony.
Big ones. With red eyes that he could see from all the way up here. And a weird green glow around them.
Something strange flickered across Bucky’s face at that, but he just said, “I don’t know, kid. It looks like some of us disappeared from Earth and ended up here.”
Natasha shrugged like this was no big deal, although he suspected that she knew it was going to mark a shift in his lifestyle. “Figured you might want a change of scenery.”
Peter ignored him. “I’m not saying I need to be warm and cozy all the time, although that would be nice, but maybe if we made the suit out of a material that conducts electricity, we could heat it up -”
As if on cue Aunt May’s voice bellowed from downstairs. Peter and Wade rushed down the stairs and through the front door, finding a very peeved Aunt May standing beside her car waiting. Peter sent her a big smile as he locked the front door behind him, noticing how Wade began whistling as he avoided all eye contact with her, practically tip toeing to the other side of the vehicle.
“Look,” Steve said, voice quieting as all eyes in the room were on them, everyone waiting for an order. “We can’t stop now.” He began. “Natasha and Matt would want us to fight on. Those people down there, they’re in danger, we have to make sure we get every single one of them to safety. That’s all that matters now. We get those people off this island, then we kill that monster once and for all.”
Steve saw red, his hands balling into tight fists, ready to strike the man as he stood there grinning like a mad man. Luckily for him Clint chose that time to turn up, two massive buckets under both arms.
“You haven’t even given them a chance.” Schmidt smirked, crossing his arms over his chest. “One field test, that’s all they need, prove how brilliant they could be against our enemies.”
“Good point.” He said, grinning as Wade sauntered up to him and wound his arms around the younger’s waist.
“Please don’t.” Peter sighed and tipped his head back, looking up at the cloudy sky. “What’s Loki doing? Is he still standing by the water fountain?”
“Jesus Christ!” Tony yelled, as Peter and Wade started panicking, flailing their arms around like a couple of monkeys. It wasn’t the Foniassaurus that was on their tail now, but a big crowd of Pterodactyls that were flying right towards them. “Let’s get the fuck out of here!”
He supposed he should keep going then, since he was pretty sure May wasn’t kidding when she’d said she’d make him, he never took her threats lightly. So, with a deep inhale he put his foot on the gas and carried on down the track, seconds away from pulling into Steve’s property where he hadn’t been for months.
And that was that. With a quick goodbye and a see you later Tony was back up the steps, making his way into the technology department.
The waiter looked up at the sound of his name, seeing that it was only Stark he went straight back to his phone. It was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Why not?” Wade smirked, turning to Peter with a wicked glint in his eyes. “I say we go pet it and spring this joint.”
Tony laughed, nodding as he remembered Steve telling him that when he’d thrown one of the dead rats at the animal. “Yeah, well, I just taste that good.” The blonde shook his head with a toothy smile. “It’s good to see you smile, you know.”
“Peter?” Tony stilled, cursing the technology gods for not inventing good phone signals. “Peter? Listen to me, listen you have to get yourselves to the information centre okay? You need to get here, right now!”
Peter had never really needed the skills Tony had taught him before, only once when Wade’s car had broken down on the side of the road, and that was only because of the radiator overheating. He remembered most of what he’d learnt, so he pulled off his hoodie, threw it to the side and asked Wade to find him a box of tools. First things first, he needed to find the problem.
Thor almost jumped as Carol appeared to his right, looking not so good. “Fine, all park-goers are on Main Street and seem to be keeping busy, the boats are minutes away.”
“Wow!” Wade stared up at the gigantic hologram of a longneck. “I wonder how long it would take to knit him a scarf.”
Tony looked at Luke as he smirked and all of a sudden felt chills creep up his spine. “Where is it?”
“Is he alright?” Clint cut in. “We just saw Carol and she told us everything, did they get back yet?”
Tony just sighed, watching as the animal went still. “Sure.” Was all he said, and Steve left it at that, knowing Tony would only argue back if he continued. “Let’s just… get out of here.”
“What’s Stark going to do over the phone, Petey? Send you a new iPad to clout the thing over the head?”
There was just something about this creature that made Steve feel anxious. From the way it had looked at him that one time, to the attempted breakout, and the mix of dinosaur’s genes inside it that Steve could only imagine wasn’t a good idea, this thing was danger waiting to happen. And it only took seconds for Steve’s uncertainties to come true.
Steve gazed over at Tony, both wondering if Bruce would finally tell them what the creature was made of. After months of secrets and classified documents being hidden away in safes, only two geneticists knowing the true identity of the man-made dinosaur, Bruce didn’t even hesitate to tell them then and there.
“Watch your mouth!” Tony shouted at him. “And yes, I agree. Thank fuck.” He sighed, not slowing down in the slightest.
Steve didn’t even hesitate. “I know she will, Tony.” He said. “I have a funny feeling the glass holding those Pterodactyls inside won’t hold her, and if she smashes that thing open…”
Tony groaned, tapping his phone against his leg. “I guess we’ll just have to add that if the fences go down then dinosaurs will be set free.”
“That Loki’s funny as shit!” Wade whispered beside Peter, laughing to himself as he fiddled with his cap. “Man, I totally want to jump out of a bush and scare the guy.”
Tony was sprinting for the exit before they could utter another word, yelling back at Steve to stay exactly where he was. As soon as he got out into the outside, all hell was breaking loose around the place. People were shouting orders, others running around in panic, some getting too scared and heading for the safety of the indoors, and before Tony got into his car he looked at the side gate that led into the dinosaur’s cage.
They swam to the edge of the river, clutching at the mucky ridge and dragging themselves up weakly. Peter was the one to collapse into the mud first, not giving a damn that he practically face planted into the dirt, his chest hurting too much to care about anything at the moment.
“What? I just… I don’t know…” Tony ran a hand through his messy hair. “I guess being with you… we haven’t spent this much time together since… since forever and I just… I’ve missed this I guess.”
“What’s the matter, Petey? Scared of the dark?” he grinned. “Don’t you worry, I’ll protect you from the big, bad dinosaur.” he said, wiggling his eyebrows up and down. “We could even make out under the scary, decomposing tree I see over there.”
The pair were met by four others, standing in suits and ties with briefcases held tight in their hands. Bruce smiled politely. “Welcome to Jurassic Island.”
Tony’s face turned as white as a sheet of paper in that instant, Steve holding his breath, as ear-piercing screams blared from the phone.
“Forget the phone!” Wade shrieked all of a sudden, eyes wide as he pointed up into the sky. “Do big birdie dinosaurs like raw meat?”
“Forget about that now, Bruce.” Steve said. “We just have to concentrate on finding a way to kill her.”
“Or maybe we can just get Peter’s boyfriend to scare them onto the boats.” He joked, finally starting to feel like there was some kind of plan coming together, before that red dot on the screen got any closer to a very large buffet.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Natasha answered for him, expression serious. “That dinosaur should have been put down as soon as she tried to escape the first time.”
“Peter,” Tony scoffed, only now noticing the Shield employees gathered nearby, and trying very hard not to look awkward whilst looking at anything but them. “Watch your fucking language.”
With an unsteady jerk the jeep suddenly came to a halt, the three passengers almost flying out of their seats. Tony spun around in his seat and met the dinosaur expert’s eyes, seeing that he looked just as worried as he sounded.
“She’s not just made of dinosaur genes.” Bruce croaked, not caring in the slightest anymore, not when his friend’s lives had been taken by his and Hank’s creation, not when thousands more could be in danger on that island. “She’s made of a few dinosaurs like Therizinosaurus, some abelisaurs genes which gave her the spiky osteoderms, the T-rex of course, the giganotosaurus, but also some reptilian genes, reptiles Hank thought would make her stronger and more interesting than the T-Rex.” Bruce sighed, rubbing a hand over his sweaty brow. “I didn’t quite agree with him about the reptile genes, but he wouldn’t listen.”
Tony chuckled, helping Steve all the way up the steps. “Steve, honey, have you seen her in the mornings?”
Tony wished there was an easy answer, a way to just snap his fingers and make the problem disappear, bring back his friends. But life was cruel and there was only one thing they could do.
Peter and Wade spend the day exploring Jurassic Island with a not so welcoming tour guide. Meanwhile, the boss of the park, Tony Stark, is having some dinosaur issues.
Tony and Steve split apart quickly, the blonde blushing bright red after realising they weren’t exactly in a private place. Tony just rolled his eyes, seeing the smirk on his nephew’s face.
Steve bit his bottom lip and looked down, making Tony wonder if his word vomit had once again messed everything up. Thankfully, it seemed to have done the complete opposite this time.
“But she’s not here now,” Natasha tried to reassure him, tucking her camera back into its pouch and pulling her gun back up in defence. “Look, if it makes you feel better we won’t go searching for her, not yet anyway, we’ll just go back the way we came, we’ll go back to the van and you lot get some damn infrared cameras across the park and find that bitch and
“So, uh…” Tony coughed behind his hand, suddenly feeling like maybe he should have given Steve a warning that he was coming, and possibly not use a lame joke after what he’d done. “How’s things?” he asked, inwardly cringing at his own choice of words. His mouth really was running off.
The team split up, four heading around the stream, three walking through the stream, and Matt with two others crept along the edge of the trees. Taking small footsteps forward, guns raised at the ready, the soldiers closed in on the dinosaur who was supposed to be right in front of them, right where a cluster of trees stood.
There was silence in the room for what felt like hours. Every employee waited for someone to give them an order or say something, Tony torn between attending to Steve’s words and wanting to hunt and kill the Foniassaurus as soon as they could. They all knew Steve could be right, yet nobody knew what else they could possible do.
Tony was having a total meltdown. After everything that had happened that morning, to sorting out the parks electrical fences and formulating a plan to capture and kill the Foniassaurus, making sure Peter wasn’t dinosaur bait had quickly pushed to the front of his mind. The engineer virtually trudged a hole into the floor of the hallway of the control room, Steve standing calmly by the wall, as he held his phone to his ear.
Natasha and Matt locked eyes before just behind him something moved, rustling the trees and leaves. Matt, slowly turning on the spot, came face to face with the Foniassaurus who crept out from between the greenery as if disguised amongst it, its humongous jaws just inches from him, revealing its filthy, sharp teeth.
Peter snorted, yanking Wade’s jacket up off the ground and tossing it onto his bed. “It’s a miracle my Aunt May lets you sleep over.”
You’d have sworn he was going to a big, important business meeting, or starting on a new project that was going to change the world, but no, he was going to meet his ex-boyfriend that he was still completely and utterly in love with. And to make matters worse, he hadn’t seen the guy since they’d broken up, and that had been six months ago. Tony had spent three of those months afterwards at his home in New York, paying more attention to Stark Industries whilst Bruce took over at the park. In the last three months he’d returned to the park, getting stuck into anything he could get his hands on, almost taking an interest in the new dinosaur thing, and building new tech for the innovation centre. All the while avoiding his ex like the plague.
Just as he yelled there came a loud roar for about the millionth time, followed by Wade screaming like a girl, Peter kicking the back of his uncle’s chair manically and Steve trying to decide if one measly bullet would do anything to the gigantic dinosaur on their tail. Tony didn’t let his foot off the gas pedal, the jeep jumped and skidded across the dirt, feeling more like a roller coaster than a car ride.
Tony was about to reply, but was swiftly cut off by Steve suddenly bolting upright in his seat, yanking his hand away from Tony’s to grip at the dashboard.
Logan rolled his eyes. “You’d like that wouldn’t you, Summers. Me getting mauled by Steve’s pet lizards.”
Tony didn’t give a damn that he was probably going way over the speed limit, right now he had to get to the control room before that creature so much as got halfway to the public part of the park. Heart racing, hands shaking, Tony hastily snatched a hold of his phone and dialled the control room number, hoping to God there wasn’t some kind of failure in the system like there had been days ago.
“He doesn’t care.” Peter said, adjusting his bag on the floor. “Last time I saw him he was more glued to his phone than he was paying any attention to me and aunt May. He even tried to bribe me with a new Ipad if I left him alone.”
After a big fuss from the crew who’d left to get back to their jobs, and Bobby getting hoisted onto a truck to take to medical bay for a check-up, Steve decided to stay behind to check that the gate was holding up. Truth be told he just wanted to check on the velociraptors. The blonde stood behind the cage as he pulled out his inhaler and breathed in two puffs, watching through the bars as the raptors stood behind the trees, their eyes fixed on Steve like they were transfixed.
“You can see Jess and Luke?” Tony cursed under his breath. “Shit! I’ve got to get a hold of them, keep an eye on that damn monster!”
Natasha didn’t let up. With the cries and shouts of her friends in her ear, Natasha never took her hand off the trigger, not until the very last shell released. As the Foniassaurus dove forward to capture Natasha in her jaws, the officer threw her gun to the side, pulling out her knife. The dinosaur clamped its teeth around her body, Natasha letting out a blood curdling yell as it lifted her into the air, swinging her about as if she were a dog and its toy.
“I needed that,” Steve said, sighing softly before looking up again at the engineer, a small smile still on his lips. “Was good to forget things even for only a few seconds. Thanks, Tony.”
When they pulled apart they were breathless, still clutching to each other like a lifeline, but smiling happily at one another.
“Where’s that blood coming from?” Natasha whispered, as she noticed the red stains appearing on her husband’s skin.
So the two took a bucket each and began walking over to the sturdy shed beside the enclosure. Once there Clint opened up the cabin and lead Steve inside, stopping in front of the big, metal freezer.
After Tony’s alarmed phone call to Thor, demanding they get a move on with the evacuation, they’d hurriedly gotten back in the car, not wasting anymore time in finding Peter and Wade. Tony was even more anxious now that he’d learnt the boats wouldn’t be at the park for at least another hour, not to mention Thor had told him they couldn’t find his nephew anywhere in the park on the infrared, which meant they were somewhere in the old section of the jungle where the cameras hadn’t been set up. But at least now they had an incline of where to look.
Wade held up a hand, which silenced Peter and made him even more irritated to say the least. “My dear, sweet Peter, you cannot tell me you are sitting there not thinking about getting out of that car and exploring the Jurassic jungle.”
Tony’s foot slammed down hard on the break, the car coming to an abrupt stop right around the corner from the control room building.
“You do know that making that thing was a stupid idea right?” Steve said. “And that name, Foniassaurus, who the hell named it?”
Steve shrugged. “If she’s exploring I suppose she still would be, she’s new to this place so I’d say there’s a high chance. She’ll definitely see some other dinosaurs around so that might slow her down. Hopefully the electric fences will help a lot too.”
Bruce nodded slowly, wiping at his cheeks. “Yes… yes, of course.” He said softly. “I-I will help in any way I can… anything you need.”
Luke thought about it, he had every single builder’s schedule lined up on his office wall. “I think… yeah I think they all had a half hours break today, two guards were left here obviously, but that’s about it.”
Minutes later Tony was staggering out of the helicopter and fell onto his knees on the nearest patch of grass, throwing up his food. “Fuck.” He groaned, accepting a bottle of water from Danny who came out of nowhere. “Thanks, Rand.”
“What?” Wade got up and looked down at the younger man all sweet and innocent. “You know you love my wet, dribble kisses!”
Steve stood there in horror as the dinosaur bit down with its powerful jaws, blood beginning to pour from between its sharp teeth, Luke’s body going lifeless and limp like a ragdoll. Jessica screamed in agony, watching in anger and pain as her husband was crushed in the Foniassaurus’s mouth, the creature ripping the man’s body into pieces before flinging what was left of him onto the earthy ground, the creature eyed the two remaining prey and started to take slothful steps forward.
Peter then had a thought. Pulling back from the kiss he looked up at Wade with a smirk. “Hey, Wade?”
Steve stared at the long scratch marks that decorated the wall. They were dug deep into the barricade, starting from the bottom and making their way right to the very top. There was only one thing that could have done it.
Tony sighed heavily, he wasn’t sure if what just happened was good or bad, or if he felt better or worse, and it made his brain feel like it was about to explode. But he didn’t have much time to sit there because Steve was making his way slowly to the building Luke had just gone into, Tony undid his belt and got out of the car as swift as he could. He jogged to keep up with Steve and they both walked side by side towards the structure.
Peter was rudely interrupted as the Foniassaurus decided in that moment to have another try in breaking the trunk. The creature swung its long jaw down onto the bark for a second time, only it didn’t just sink its teeth in as it had seconds before, instead the full force of its bite broke through the tree and sent bits and pieces of the trunk flying everywhere. The couple wailed out in horror, Wade jumping on top of Peter to protect him.
The drive to the dinosaur’s enclosure didn’t seem any more promising though. The ten minute ride felt more like a ten hour ride. Tony had stuck the radio on quietly in the background as he drove off, Steve sitting beside him tight-lipped, looking at anything but Tony.
Tony nodded, slinging a gun over his shoulder that Steve handed him. “Okay, okay, we’re good… everything’s good. Good.”
Loki had had enough of this damn island. He’d had enough of pouring coffee’s at the café, enough of listening to stupid kids, and their stupid screeching, enough of Thor nagging him every five minutes, and enough of the blasted dinosaurs that wouldn’t shut up. Loki snorted as one of the big, water dinosaurs made a splash in the gigantic pool nearby, proving his point.
Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Steve, let me take you, I don’t want this to be awkward between us.”
The first thing Loki heard was screams, loud, deafening screams from half of the people in Main Street, and he quickly jumped out of his seat and turned around in the direction of the shouting. Loki’s eyes widened in horror as he looked down Main Street. Not only were people running for their lives, and finding spots to hide, but up in the sky was a sight Loki thought he’d never see.
The researcher turned to the two, feeling his phone begin to vibrate in his pocket. “What if it didn’t escape?”
Peter rolled his eyes. “Wade, they’re night vision goggles.” He said impatiently. “Now get them off and find me a key for the jeep!”
Tony chortled, giving him a stiff hug. “Ah, not far off.” He said as he noticed Wade swaying back and forth beside Peter. He arched an eyebrow.
“That all depends on what she’s made of.” Steve mumbled under his breath, sighing heavily as he walked to the back of the room.
“Look, Tony,” Steve said all of a sudden. “If you have something to say I’ll listen, but if you don’t I really think I’d better get inside the enclosure.”
Thor said over the coms, sounding like he was about to be sick from the nerves, even though he was safe in the control room.
, the clear sound of a thin twig breaking under a hefty weight, practically echoing against the quietness of the woods. They must have heard it back at base too, as the voices in her ear, Steve, Tony, Thor, Carol, began telling her to run, run and don’t look back.
“Hey.” Tony said quietly as he joined Steve by the wall. “We’ll kill that thing, no matter what, okay? We’ll do it for our friends.”
The three walked towards the blonde and the closer they got the wider their eyes grew. All three felt a sudden surge of panic, Luke cursing loudly as Jessica grabbed him by the arm and tugged him out of the hall.
“Oh,” Peter pulled a face, he completely forgot to call, too caught up in all the fun he and Wade were having. “I’m sorry Aunt May, the signal’s crap here, was going to call you soon.” He lied.
“What are the employees going to tell them if they ask why, Tony?” Steve inquired from behind the man. “You can’t say there’s a dangerous dinosaur on the loose.”
Wade put a hand to his heart and fake gasped as he plonked himself next to her, as Peter let out a groan in embarrassment. “Why, Mrs May, I would never inappropriately touch your barely legal blood relative!”
“Jesus Christ!” Tony stomped on the break quickly before he unbuckled his belt, rushing out of the car himself. He knew Steve was a bit of a daredevil, but he wasn’t expecting him to leap out of a moving vehicle for crying out loud! “Steve!”
The tedious eight hour flight to Costa Rica felt more like twenty hours to Peter. As their plane landed safely on the tarmac he was more than happy to disembark and get on the mini bus, where they’d then be driven to the boat that would take them to the island. He’d always hated flying because of the constant humming from the engines which drove him insane, and the hours of sitting on his butt without stretching his legs or arms, and on this flight Wade and himself had been stuck behind a screaming baby who had an infuriating way of knowing when Peter wanted to fall asleep.
“What are you looking at?” He called over, gaining the mother’s attention who didn’t look pleased, and was pulling her child far away from Loki without question. Loki smirked, mission accomplished.
“How do you know?” he asked, before shaking his head in realisation and cutting the blonde off before he could answer. “Wait, stupid question, you know this place better than I do.” He said, running a hand through his dirty hair. “Do you…. Do you think she’ll you know… try to get in there?”
“Electric fences!” Thor squeaked as he practically ran back to his seat, instantly typing away speedily on his computer.
Steve just sighed, looking down at the spanner in his hand before tossing it into the tool box. “What do you want, Tony?” he questioned, crossing his arms over his chest. He knew the man well enough to know he was trying to avoid the obvious tension between them with those jokes.
And that’s what Thor did. There was a few beeps over the line, then a loud buzz before the infrared map popped up on the control room’s screen, showing the area where Natasha and her team stood amongst the trees. Red figures stood out amongst the blue and the green of the scenery around them, showing exactly where the team were standing.
Tony didn’t even blink before he was sprinting towards the blonde, gritting his teeth in anger as he held up his rifle. Nobody hurt Steve when he was around. Without thinking, as he neared the pterodactyl, Tony lunged at it and with all the force he had struck the dinosaur with the butt of the rifle in its head. The animal squawked in surprise, tumbling to the side and tripping over a lifeless pterodactyl on the ground.
The engineer saw the exact moment it hit Bruce like a hard slap to the face. The scientist’s face turned as white as a sheet of paper, his eyes wide in shock, his hands started trembling as he pulled off his glasses and put a hand to his head. Luckily Steve was there as the next thing they knew Bruce’s knees had a mind of their own, and the blonde dashed over to catch him, holding him up as Tony ran across the hall to retrieve a chair for him to sit in.
Tony nodded. “Yeah…” he drawled, suddenly feeling like the conversation was about to turn for the worst.
Thankfully Wade did just that. Seconds later the two were trailing after the omnivore, ducking as low as they could, and freezing like a couple of statues when the dinosaur’s eyes glanced their way.
“Too bad there’s an ugly looking building over there.” Wade broke the daydream Peter was having as the boat came to a stop.
Luckily for them, the dinosaur didn’t take long before it gave up, and its head disappeared from their view. Feeling their chests tighten, Peter and Wade urgently swam to the top, breaking the surface with gasping breaths.
They didn’t need a dinosaur encyclopaedia to know that whatever it was was looking them up and down like they were his lunch, and it didn’t take long for the thing to decide it was hungry. In a split second the dinosaur went from silently watching to making a racket as its jaws opened wide and he let out a blood curdling roar, almost sending Peter and Wade flying backwards.
As he got out he could see people running for cover, some standing there in sheer shock, Steve started bawling at them to hide without a second thought. Then, from inside the enclosure, gunshots could be heard firing off one after the other. Steve felt his stomach do a funny turn, the image of Luke being eaten alive still on his mind and before he knew it he was on his knees in the middle of the dirt path, bringing up the contents of his stomach.
Tony’s car sped along the dirt road under the tall, swaying trees that stretched over like a hand grasping at the air. The wheels skidded against the mud, covering the vehicle in splodges of filth and grime, something Tony would be appalled at if he weren’t on his way to save his nephew and nephew’s other half from being eaten alive by a vicious dinosaur.
Thor nodded, running a hand through his unruly hair. “Steve said there’s been a breach, but according to the security systems and the cameras every cage is in tack. Well, except for the obvious.”
“Fuck fuck fuck!” Wade screamed in panic as they jumped over fallen logs and dodged branches, Wade pushing Peter further ahead to shield him. “Run Peter, fucking run!”
But before Steve could answer, the jeep hit a deep ditch in the ground, sending the jeep flying into the air and slamming back down with a thump. Steve’s phone slipped out of his hand, falling onto the floor of the vehicle and sliding underneath the front seat.
Bruce nodded, suddenly feeling a bit overwhelmed at the responsibility of it all. “I’ll get it sorted.” he mumbled, sending them a short farewell before practically sprinting for the door.
“I uh, got your text.” He said to Tony, looking between him and the dinosaur trainer. “What’s the emergency?” he asked, noticing the hasty typing and rushed chatting between the employers in the room.
“Pete, honey bear?” Wade whispered, as brash, booming stomps headed their way as they both stood. “Why do I have a bad feeling about this?”
The teenager stopped laughing when he heard his name being called, looking around in confusion he soon saw the source of the voice. Strutting down a flight of steps to their right was his uncle Tony, wearing his usual suit and tie with his phone clutched in his hand as always. Peter sent him a wave as the engineer walked towards them.
Steve had to think of something, and quick. He could just about make out her gigantic feet heading towards him, so he gave the underneath of the car a quick scan, hoping to find an item that could hide his smell. Then his eyes landed on the petrol cord. Without a second thought Steve stuffed a hand into the back pocket of his jeans, yanking out a pocket knife that Tony had gotten him a long time ago for, as he’d put it, dinosaur emergencies. He was more than thankful that Tony’s little joke of a gift was possibly about to save his life.
Luke didn’t even seem affected at all, he’d hopped out of the craft with a satisfied grin on his face and stuck his thumb up in Tony’s direction before he sauntered into the dinosaur’s new enclosure. Tony glared at the man’s retreating back, wanting to throw the water bottle in his direction. He thought better of it when Danny helped him up and told him he’d better get inside before Luke’s patience wears off.
It was true. They kneeled in the grass for almost five minutes watching the dinosaur eat grass and swing its enormous tail back and forth, and not once did it seemed bothered by the fact that the two were so close by. It became apparent that the dinosaur wasn’t going to be going anywhere anytime soon either, by the way it was chomping down on every tiny grain of the green stuff, and Wade was getting bored by just watching it.
Tony did just that as the helicopter left the ground. It wasn’t even seconds into the air before it swayed way too fast to the side and clipped the edge of the building, Tony clung to anything that he could find, and could have sworn he felt his heart stop for a second. Danny cheered like it was a rollercoaster ride as Luke laughed animatedly beside him. Meanwhile Tony held on tight to the seats and counted in his head, telling himself that next time he’ll just take that beating from Luke Cage.
Update 2/7/18: This chapter has been edited because I thought the timeline and alternating POV didn't flow well, so I re-arranged some parts. Nothing is re-written, just re-ordered, so if you already read it, you haven't missed anything!
Bruce smirked as he went back to his microscope. “Maybe this is empty nest syndrome. You’re worried that he doesn’t need you anymore.”
Pepper clears her throat. “I checked his credentials earlier, Tony,” she said tightly. She turned to the reporter with another stunning smile. “Steve, why don’t you and Peter go down to my office? It’s much cozier there. Actually, Bruce, would you mind showing them the way? I need to speak with Tony for a second.”
“Clint is alive. He’s alone. His family, they’re - they’re just gone. I called Scott, too. He vanished,” she continued, and the numbers just kept adding up; the toll just kept getting bigger and every name on the list felt like a blow to the stomach. “His daughter is fine, though. She’s with her mom and step-dad.”
Featuring the heart-to-heart between Loki and Peter Parker that you never knew you needed until now.
“You weren’t there before,” said Peter, his voice going high-pitched. “Right? I mean, no one else saw him before, right?”
Tony was getting exasperated. “Because he doesn’t hang around long enough for me to say anything! I barely get to say ‘hi’ and ‘bye’ these days.”
Worst of all, what if Tony was completely wrong and Peter was right, and Steve was just a nice guy trying to do his job?
“I know my brother,” said Loki with his hands raised in innocence, “and I know the Stones. I still can’t help you get out of here, but I have an idea of what they’re trying back on Midgard.” He looked at them each carefully before adding, “I’ll tell you, but you’re not going to like it.”
“You’re right,” said MJ, sliding smoothly in between Tony and Steve to interrupt their staring contest. She looked between them. “You both have a lot of explaining to do. Later. After we find Peter. Here’s the plan,” she began, and all of the adults glanced at each other before collectively deciding to listen. “Steve is going to go get Peter. While he’s doing that, Tony is going to distract Osborn by accusing him publicly of creating Spider-Man. Call him out. Literally. Tell the world that he’s a liar, and that if he wants to prove that it wasn’t him who created and kidnapped Spider-Man, then he needs to publicly come out and say it. Use his own tactics against him. Meanwhile, Steve will rescue Peter, and then we can prove that Osborn kidnapped Spider-Man.”
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry,” he said in a whisper. “I knew something was coming. I just didn’t know it was going to be this bad. I thought - if we could get some oversight, maybe the weight of the world wouldn’t be on our shoulders all of the time.”
Even though Tony hadn’t technically done anything yet, the words left him feeling electrified, anticipation racing through his veins. Steve wanted this, too. He wasn’t imagining it. “Upstairs,” he said then. Feeling reckless, he took Steve by the hand and led him to the elevator.
Steve just went, not asking why, and he didn’t even look surprised until Tony took him into the hallway and pushed him up against the wall.
Steve could see him descending into his own guilt. He tried to pull him out, even though he could feel himself sinking, too.
“He's not Johnny Storm – and also, then it would be the Fantastic Five. That just doesn’t have the same ring to it.”
“Oh – it’s nothing,” Steve said as Tony, not known for his patience, snatched it out of his lap. Steve didn’t protest, and he only half-smiled when Tony glanced at him for confirmation that it was okay for him to look at it. “Really, it’s nothing. Just a hobby,” he said.
“Uh,” said Tony as he turned the page. “This is really good.” That was all that he, Tony Stark, genius billionaire, could come up with. Words like
Things were finally moving. After several paralyzing hours, a plan was in motion. Steve was in uniform, prepared to leave. Pepper was already setting things in motion for Tony to make a big speech on TV. Even May looked somewhat relieved now that she knew Captain America was going to save her nephew.
“Tony? What was that all about?” Pepper came up behind him, voice gentle even though he knew she, too, was shaken by this whole thing.
Tonight was Steve’s warm gaze and expressive gestures, talking about his past without reservation. Tonight was Tony buying them a reckless number of drinks just to keep him talking. Tonight was staying in one place so that he had a good vantage point to keep an eye on Peter, even as MJ finally just grabbed his hand and led them to the dance floor, only to realize that Steve had been quietly keeping an eye on them, too.
Pepper paused, glared, and then opened her desk drawer and handed him a thin manila folder. Tony opened it to find copies of Steve Carter’s driver’s license and press credentials inside, along with a signed agreement that Steve wouldn’t use the information he gathered to slander SI’s name. Tony wasn’t an expert on identity fraud, but he was pretty sure that it was all real, and if it wasn’t, that the signed form meant they could at least sue him. “I… see you checked all of the boxes,” he said carefully. He should have known better than to question Pepper’s methods.
The other Avengers looked at Loki with suspicion, but this was a strange time and a strange place, and they were in desperate need of information.
“You’re not dangerous,” Natasha repeated, obviously reading his mind again. “Steve, you’re doing this for his own good. If he’s harboring some new superhero, then it’s something SHIELD should know about. Tony will never believe it, but he needs people to look out for him sometimes.”
Above it all stood Tony Stark, leaning on the seventh floor balcony and observing the chaos of the floors below as everyone he employed got to work. It was nine on a Tuesday morning. Tony was usually in his lab at this time or fast asleep, but he was expecting someone, and so he’d taken the opportunity to stop and observe. He didn’t often take the time to appreciate the immensity of what went on inside Stark Tower every day on the first five floors. The sixth and seventh floors contained conference rooms, the eighth through tenth guest rooms for visiting scientists and other guests, and Tony had renovated the remaining sixteen highest floors for Avengers only. He knew it was excessive but he told them he didn’t know how to do it any other way. It was mostly the truth. Pepper said it was because Tony wanted them to stay. He would neither confirm nor deny that statement.
There were a thousand moments that could have gone differently, scenes playing on repeat in his head until his shield clattered to the cold ground and Tony was looking at him like he’d never seen him before. Steve was only pulled out of his thoughts when Sam or Bucky or Nat or T’Challa forced him to focus on something else. Eventually - after longer than he thought he would need - he started seeking them out on his own. Two years down the line, Tony was a bruise that he occasionally pressed on, just to remind himself that it was there, but it wasn’t something he thought about every day.
He felt slightly better knowing that Bruce would be there to protect their most important secret, but he was still uncomfortable as he watched the three of them exit the room. As soon as the door closed, Pepper turned on him. “Was all of that really necessary?” She asked reasonably. “Tony, this is a good PR opportunity for the company. And it’s a good chance for Peter and Michelle to get their names out there. I don’t understand why you can’t just let him do his job.”
decided not to worry about this. Now he couldn’t stop wondering what this weirdly handsome journalist wanted with his son. (Uh, his intern. Whatever.) He put his head in his hands. “This really cannot be good.”
She didn’t look or sound particularly emotional about it, and Steve suspected she had done her grieving privately.
“Tony -” His blue eyes widened as Tony grabbed his tie and pulled him closer. Tony noticed every detail, from the sharp scent of his cologne to the way his cheeks flushed slightly. He leaned in. His intent really could not be mistaken. Steve took a breath, and Tony was so close to him that he felt his chest move up and down. “Tony, I’m not saying that I don’t want to do this but if we stay here, someone will see.”
Nat sighed. “I didn’t think so. Look, it’s not exactly my place to tell you what happened, but suffice it to say it’s a long story. One that changed Tony. A lot. I wasn’t there to spy on him, but against my better judgement, I got to know him pretty well anyway. Tony isn’t a bad guy, he’s just –” She searched for the right words. “He was raised by wealthy parents who had no idea how to take care of a child, and then he went through a series of traumatic experiences as a young adult that shaped who he became. And at first, he became an asshole,” she said bluntly. “He was a mess. The partying was out of control. He was reckless with his money, and he didn’t care. The mission that I was sent on – it changed all of that. Like I said, it made Tony a different person when Obe- when he went through that. I doubt his interpersonal skills have improved much,” she said dryly, “but he is trying. Or he was, when I was there.” She frowned. “Sorry, I was required to give my opinion for a psych analysis of him after my mission, so there’s plenty I could say on the subject.”
When Peter reached the eleventh floor, he started wishing he'd done more laps in gym when he had the chance. His heart was pounding and he was starting to sweat, but he kept going, one step at a time.
Norman Osborne’s rant about how Tony Stark was a liar was interrupted by a breaking news alert telling the nation that Captain America was back, and he had rescued Spider-Man from an abandoned Oscorp warehouse. Osborne was arrested on live television, and forced to admit that it was his invention that accidentally chemically altered a child and made him a superhero.
Then again, there was still a stubborn part of him that wasn’t entirely sure he should trust Steve. Things had been off with him from the start. Sure, he was handsome, nice, interesting - and a good kisser, Tony could admit - but he still didn’t really know much about him. Even after hearing about Steve’s past, something still didn’t sit quite right. Tony tried to tell himself that he could fix things with Steve, and he wanted to, but it was hard to ignore the persistent feeling that something about Steve was suspicious - maybe it was the timing of his arrival, the questions he asked, or the glasses that he clearly didn’t need. There was something that Tony was missing, some essential clue he had overlooked….
The professor stopped talking and the entire class froze. Peter was sitting in the back near the door, so he got up to see what was going on. He stepped out to see other students poking their heads out of classrooms. He started walking over to the balcony, where he would be able to see all the way down into the lobby of the atrium. That was when he heard it.
“Kid,” said Tony as he put on his sunglasses and pulled out of the parking lot, “I don’t know, okay? I don’t think Steve is going to publish anything. And if he does, I promise you I will make sure he regrets it. The problem is that once something like that is out there, it can’t be taken back. So if he changes his mind -”
Although he would never admit it to Pepper, Tony was secretly pleased to have a competent intern for once. Peter wasn't just here so that he could tell his friends that he worked in Stark Tower or take sneaky pictures of their equipment and post them online (that intern had promptly been fired). He wasn't going to cozy up to Pepper in the hopes of getting a long term job or ask if he could put on the Iron Man suit. Peter was here because he was just… curious. He was also a huge nerd, but that meant he would fit right in. Tony was pleasantly surprised to find that he enjoyed the time he spent with the kid.
“Not even Steve?” Peter asked with a knowingly raised eyebrow. Tony didn’t like that eyebrow, didn’t like it at all.
Peter could see him sitting alone a short distance away. Like with everybody else, sometimes Loki appeared to be just a few yards away, while at other times Peter would look up and barely be able to see him. The dimensions of space and time were different here. If it weren’t so terrifying, Peter might have been fascinated by the physics of it. As it was, he could only wonder if there was any way for them to get out of here.
For the first time, Steve felt a spark of hope, knowing there was a solid plan in place. Even if Thor couldn’t defeat Thanos, they would take the Soul Stone, bring back everybody else, and defeat him with the full force of the Avengers back in play. Of course, his optimism was tempered by the knowledge that he wouldn’t be around to see it.
Finally, they had pinpointed the reason that this scenario made Tony so uncomfortable. Not only was he protective of Peter, he was also very aware of how publicity could affect a young person, because it had happened to him. It had simply been his reality as a child and as a teenager that there would be cameras in his face every time he stepped out in public.
Steve called Tony back four times but there was no reply. After the fourth time he reached Tony’s voicemail, he threw his phone so hard at the wall that it shattered.
Peter’s visits were more focused on his suit nowadays than his actual health, which Tony frequently reminded him could change drastically at any moment. Tony didn’t worry constantly about Peter, but it was a near thing. He was keenly aware that Peter’s powers could still prove to be temporary or some kind of biochemical fluke. That was why he steered Peter toward Bruce’s lab even as Peter started listing things he had questions about.
“Who are these people?” Drax asked again, to no one in particular. “What is this man talking about? The Soul World? Spider-Boy? Is this a riddle?” Quill started to quietly explain to him what was going on while Mantis sighed.
“I’m afraid I can’t,” said Tony apologetically, turning his best puppy eyed look on her as he slid the test tube into his pocket. “Another time, for sure.”
. He’d like to write a piece about the prestigious internships that Stark Industries has to offer. He wants to interview Michelle and Peter, and you. I figured since Peter was already here -”
“Which almost makes up for the carbon footprint of that flying monstrosity of yours,” MJ added. “Anyway, we have to go learn about something that might actually affect us in the future. Bye, Flash.”
“Mr. Stark! I got your invitation,” he said eagerly. “I’ll definitely go, except I’m not sure how late I can stay. Does it really not start until 9:00? I mean, not that I go to bed at 9:00, it’s just that my aunt usually wants me home by 11 and -”
“Good morning, sir. May Parker is here and requesting a meeting with you as soon as possible. You have nothing scheduled for today. Should I tell her -”
It was a repetitive clicking noise, growing louder and louder the closer he got to the balcony. He had just reached it and looked down when the alarm started screeching and a red light started flashing an emergency signal. “Please evacuate the building,” said a calm female voice, echoing through the lobby. “Emergency protocols should be followed. All personnel, please evacuate the building.” It was so loud that Peter had to cover his ears, but it still didn't distract him from what was down below:
He looked around to see the remaining soldiers confused, grieving, lost. Steve’s best friend was gone, again. His right hand man. His friends had just disappeared.
“So we have to wait for the people back on Earth to fix this? That’s it? We just wait?” Peter couldn’t help but feel frustrated by that.
Steve was being horribly quiet about the whole thing, like he didn’t know what to say or do, either.
At that moment, Bucky appeared at Sam’s side. “Wanda might know something about the Soul Stone,” he said without much optimism. “She wants to talk to us.”
They were both drunk - well, Tony thought Steve was drunk, but his voice was remarkably steady - and they had reached a point where Tony had practically heard Steve’s entire life story. People were starting to leave, and Tony was pretty sure that Peter’s aunt had picked him up hours ago, which meant that it was probably after midnight. It would have made sense for them to part ways for the evening at this point, but that was not what drunk Tony had in mind. Instead, he grabbed Steve by the wrist and said, “Come on.”
The lobby of Stark Industries looked completely different decked out in holiday decorations. The ballroom (who knew they even had a ballroom?) was down the hallway, but the lobby had two bars, a long table with more food than Peter had ever seen in one place, and a crowd of hundreds milling around. Peter pushed his way past New York’s wealthiest to see if he could find someone he knew. After a few minutes of being shoved around, he decided to try the ballroom instead.
“Okay,” said May slowly, “there is definitely more to that story, but we’ll get to that in a minute because my nephew is missing.” She took a breath to steady herself before she launched into her story. She told it systematically, like she had practiced it, or possibly been thinking about it all night. “He came home and he was upset, but he told me everything was fine like he always does. He went to do his homework and then we had dinner. He took a shower. He went to his room. His light was on. When I went to go to bed, his light was still on. I decided to check on him because he’d been acting weird and quiet.”
Strange frowned. “I believe we will, if the scenario I saw plays out on Earth. When Thanos is defeated, then the Soul Stone can be used to reverse the removal of half of the universe.”
His suspicion was confirmed as she confidently strode out of the room without waiting for an answer, her red hair like a beacon for him to follow.
“What the -” Tony’s eyes flew open and his fist came flying at Steve’s face before he had fully woken up. Anticipating it, Steve easily caught his hand and deftly avoided a kick aimed at him in the same second.
“I’m Steve Rogers,” he said awkwardly to the robot girl as they made their way into the Tower. He wasn’t really in the mood for small talk, but he owed her a great deal. She brought Tony back.
They both glanced over to the corner, where Tony had set up a small bed for the sleeping black and white kitten.
“This place is endless. I’ve explored it for weeks now and have yet to discover its limits, if they exist. Occasionally I would stumble across others, but now it’s positively crowded in here.” The others looked around, but no one else seemed to be present. Loki frowned. “Some of the others that I saw… they...
“I don’t know. I was sort of hoping that my dear brother might find a way to contact me. There’s not much for me to work with here.” He gestured to the expansive nothingness around them.
“Yes,” said Strange, his tone heartbreakingly gentle as he looked at Peter. “I’m sorry, Mr. Parker.”
“Something’s bothering you,” Natasha said about halfway through the movie, grabbing the remote to turn the volume down. “What is it?” Steve knew he wouldn’t get out of this without telling the whole truth, not with the way she was looking at him like she could read his thoughts.
This was the part where they were supposed to kiss and make up, Tony knew. He was supposed to just accept that Steve wouldn’t hurt Peter, but Tony was rapidly derailing from angry to scared because he
“We had a misunderstanding,” Tony confessed quickly, “and I am sorry about that. I was going to apologize to him today.”
at once was overwhelming, immeasurable. His mind couldn’t process what he’d just seen. Bucky, gone. T’Challa, gone. Sam. Wanda. There one moment, gone the next.
Nat also introduced him to Clint Barton and Sam Wilson. Clint, according to his file, could hit any target and did it without any superpowers. When Steve met him, he just looked like a normal guy. Except for the fact that he was drinking coffee straight out of the pot in the communal kitchen. But he seemed nice. Sam, on the other hand, was an Air Force veteran who helped out at the local VA, an organization that had still been relatively new when Steve was in the Army. Steve was keenly aware that some veterans didn’t like talking about their time in the service, but Sam was refreshingly open about it and he always seemed interested in hearing what Steve had to say, even when he found himself rambling about the past, lost in reminiscence. For the first time, Steve felt like he might have made a real friend for a reason other than being co-workers at SHIELD.
“We haven’t killed each other yet,” said Sam vaguely, and that was the whole answer to that question.
Peter nodded, taking small steps into the room and staring in awe. They were in a high ceilinged hall that reached up into a glass rooftop, one door to their left another to their right as one enormous, timber door stood to their front, all covered in dirt and dust. What caught their eye the most was the life-size skeleton of a T-Rex that practically took up most of the room, taking its stance in the middle. Every wall was decorated with old, decaying dinosaur patterned wallpaper, whilst posters and flyers of the creatures lay strewn on the ground underneath growing weeds and grass.
Natasha’s husband hadn’t heard her. The team looked over at him, brows furrowing in confusion as to why he was looking up into the trees, as if something was lurking on the branches. Natasha called for him once more, but he held up his hand, gesturing for her to keep quiet. The team stood still, watching, and waiting.
The three shared the same look of dread, thinking of the thousands of people on the island that were already, possibly feeling uneasy about being in the situation they were in as it was. And to make things worse, they were all being rounded into one place.
The Foniassaurus roared once more, bullets hitting her from head to feet, bouncing off her skin as if she were bulletproof. Natasha didn’t stop, she screamed until her throat hurt, crashing bullet after bullet at the monster, standing her ground. It took seconds before the Foniassaurus reached her, its teeth baring as it flung itself forward to grab her. Natasha dodged the creature’s jaws, yanking a knife out of her pocket she swung for the dinosaur’s eye, instead slicing it across its nose. The Foniassaurus let out a loud yelp, shaking its head like it would make the pain disappear.
Tony, Steve and Peter moved their gaze at the other man, and looked at him like he’d grown a second head. And without another word, they sat back, and Tony drove the jeep down the dirt path, heading for the next right turning.
Behind the protective display was a sea of trees, bushes and plants all strewn around the earthy ground, like a jungle fit for such a large monster. The trees were tall and sprouting leaves from top to bottom, they made it perfect for the dinosaur to hide behind and not be seen so easily. Tony wondered if the thing was watching them at that very instant.
May was looking at him like he was insane, but Pepper actually jumped to her feet. “Yes, Oscorp released a new phone that was supposed to be for professionals, like a Blackberry but better. Only, there was some tech in it that made the charger hole open up and bite people.”
how responsible and smart you are, and how much we appreciate having you. I might even be able to put in a good word with MIT next year, if you’re interested.” He dropped a wink in May’s direction.
“You try to find our lost friends in the Soul World,” Thor explained with a heavy gaze. “...Just in case our plan does not work, that would be the next course of action anyway. If Thanos lives, we will have to find another way to get back the souls he has taken.”
Three months had passed since Peter became Spider-Man and Peter’s prolonged “internship” had ended, but Peter still came to the Tower a few times a week just to hang out or ask questions or modify the suit.
“I don’t mind,” Steve said casually. “As long as the headline labels me as a ‘hot blonde,’ I’m on board.”
“Pepper, Pep,” he was stammering, mind racing faster than his mouth could form words. “Pep, the - the - Oscorp. Phone. Biting people. Remember?”
He had been given strict instructions to avoid the actual red carpet, entering through a side door instead. He had to show his ID to a man at the door, who checked his name off on a list. It made him feel like he was the president or something, sneaking around to avoid the paparazzi. Did presidents do that? He had no idea.
“Well, you only left out about 70 years,” said Tony, sounding way more casual than he felt. He felt like his heart was going to jump right out of his chest, and he didn’t even have a functioning heart, so the feeling was disconcerting.
“Can't we just leave him?” MJ asked, deadpan, but she was already grabbing her chair again. Peter did the same, and they approached the spider from behind. They tried to go quietly, but Flash wasn't helping.
“What did he ask you about?” Tony asked as soon as Steve left. “Did he say anything about Oscorp? Pepper said his backstory checks out but I’m not convinced.”
There were some things in life that were incalculable. Time, for instance. You could count seconds, minutes, hours, days, but there was never enough of it. You couldn’t stop it, or change it. Well, maybe Strange could have. But he was gone now. Everyone was gone. Peter…. It was too painful to even contemplate.
With Sam, Clint, Natasha, and Coulson to talk to, SHIELD suddenly felt less like a prison and more like someplace he could actually fit in. It didn’t take him very long to figure out that this had been Natasha’s plan all along. She also managed to convince Fury to let him out on assignments, something that made him feel alive again: getting to travel, fight crime, and stop bad guys. That was pretty much his thing, even in a new century, and it all helped to make him feel like he was actually making a new life here and not just existing day to day. He felt proud of the work he was doing. Things were going well.
“Actually, if it sucked, we would be in a black hole,” said Drax. “And by now, our bodies would have been ripped apart limb by limb.” He laughed as if this were a great joke that no one else was in on.
They stumbled into Tony’s kitchen, both a little drunk, both literally and from the sudden turn of events that had led to them kissing in an elevator. Tony was afraid that breaking the kiss would bring them back to reality, and this whole night would just turn out to be a mistake, but then Steve looked at him hungrily and before he knew it, Tony pushed up against the counter on his tiptoes - since when had Steve been so tall? - kissing him at a perfect angle and pushing his suit jacket off of his shoulders and tugging at his tie.
Things were also going well for Pepper and her intern, MJ, who seemed to have every task complete before she was even asked to do it. Stark Industries was running smoothly, and everyone was happy.
“Peter was here,” Bruce said, meeting Tony’s gaze. “But Peter wouldn’t -” He trailed off, leaving a heavy silence between them.
Peter didn’t even blink. “I told him that there was some stuff you and Bruce started working on while I was an intern that I found interesting and you let me hang around sometimes to check it out. Don’t worry. I made it seem like I was just a huge nerd.”
had faded away; maybe he just hadn’t fully realized it yet. It would almost be a relief - at least then, he would have a chance of reuniting with Peter, so that he could tell him everything would be okay - but that wasn’t what the universe had in store for him. Tony was cold and alone on a dead planet.
“Tony’s not answering,” said Banner suddenly. He had climbed out of the Hulk suit now that the danger was gone, and he was holding a phone in his hand. “Pepper isn’t, either. I have no idea where Tony is, anyway. Last I knew, he was chasing Thanos into space after he hit New York.”
“You’re willing to do that?” Tony asked, arching an eyebrow at Steve. Tony wasn’t exactly up to date on what was going on here, but he could guess that SHIELD would not be pleased with Captain America being revealed to the world ahead of schedule.
Steve and Tony watched the friends reunite with equally fond gazes. Finally, Peter turned to them. He threw himself into Tony’s arms first.
Tony didn’t expect such a simple statement to cause a lump to form in his throat. It was just so rare for someone to acknowledge that Tony had been through anything. He was rich, arrogant, obnoxious, smart… most people couldn’t comprehend that there was anything he could possibly lack, or want. All he wanted was normalcy. Sure, he liked attention, but not like this. Right now, with Peter missing and things falling apart around him, Tony wished more than anything that he was just a normal person. Just a normal CEO, even, with a normal intern kid. That was why he relished those moments with Peter in the lab so much: for a while there, it almost felt normal.
Tony was about to announce his plan to storm Oscorp, find Peter, and burn the building slowly to the ground when Bruce walked into the office, clearly not expecting to find Pepper looking alarmed, Tony fuming, and Peter’s teary aunt.
“No,” said Steve. He had a not-great feeling about this, but that was to be expected. Half of the population just disappeared from the Earth. Nothing about this was going to feel right, or good, or okay. “Okoye can lead from here. I’m going to find out if Tony and Peter are still alive, and who they were with, and if there’s anyone else out there left who can fight. In the meantime, Thor can search the galaxies. Reach out to his friends, find out what they know, what’s happening on other planets. We’re all in this together now. We gather as much information as we can.” He said it aloud as he realized it: “Today may seem hopeless, but what it gave us was time. It’s not a race to the Infinity stones anymore. I’d like to get it done sooner rather than later, but the mission has changed. We gather who’s left. We find out how to defeat him. And then we rid the universe of Thanos once and for all.”
Tony stared at him for a minute. “Did he ask why you were here?” He was still suspicious. “He must have been wondering. Your ‘extended’ internship was supposed to be over by now.” He started pacing.
After laughing at a story about the time Peggy had woken him up by dumping water on his head, Tony asked, “Is she still around? You talk about her like this was all in the past.”
Abruptly, Tony remembered that before Peter told him about Spider-Man, he noticed something was off because Peter was being unusually quiet.
Sam shook his head. “Listen, man. They’re saying in the papers that it’s some vigilante, but I saw him. I couldn’t catch him, and I was
“And yet, you ‘accidentally’ take my coffee mug every time yours is empty,” Bruce said flatly. “I’m only asking because I thought a few test tubes and beakers went missing the other day, but I hadn’t done an inventory in a while so I wasn’t sure. Only now I can’t find -” He ran a hand through his hair, looking stressed. “The atomic force microscope just like, disappeared. How did I misplace that one? I’m sure it’s around somewhere. Maybe one of the grad students -”
The silence sent a shiver down her spine. “Peter?” She called again, knocking a little louder in case he was wearing headphones.
We've reached the end! This is a short, but hopefully satisfying chapter. After finally seeing Infinity War, I added an extra fluffy moment for Steve to comfort Tony, because Tony doesn’t get enough love. Plus -  spoiler alert - it has a happy ending. Enjoy.
“I won’t,” Tony promised softly, unable to stay mad at him for long. “Come on, you can spend the rest of the night at the Tower. I’m guessing you told May you were sleeping over at Ned’s?” Peter nodded, and Tony rolled his eyes. “Well, you’re coming with me and we are getting you to school on time in the morning. Don’t whine to me about it when you’re exhausted in class tomorrow.”
Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Peter, I want to know what the hell you were thinking. It’s three in the morning. That guy had a gun. You could’ve been killed. Fighting crime isn’t some game you get to play now just because you have powers, understand?”
Nat became more serious again. “No, it’s not you,” she said gently. “Frankly, I’m surprised that you’ve made it this far. You must have Pepper on your side.”
She smirked. “I have my ways. Anyway, Pepper scheduled my first interview with this guy on Thursday, so,” she started walking again, turning her back on both of them. “I’ll be the judge of whether or not he’s hot. Literally or metaphorically.”
Loki was fading fast, and the others were pretending not to care but Peter could tell that it concerned them. Even if they weren’t particularly fond of Loki, it was alarming to think that they were watching something that was about to happen to all of them.
Sam didn’t look convinced. “Yeah, well, I don’t mess with magic. Just stay away. We don’t need any more trouble than we’re already in.”
Or at least, it looked like a short distance. They seemed to be in a featureless space. The more Peter looked around, the less certain he was about exactly what he was seeing. There seemed to be no limits to the space. No walls or doors or buildings, just endless, whiteish fog. The only exception was the ground. It shimmered like water, only it didn’t feel wet. When Peter took a step toward Bucky, small ripples emanated from the spot where he put his foot down. It made no noise.
Peter had been annoyed at Tony when he came home, annoyed enough that he didn’t bother to tell Tony that he was going out tonight. As he swung through the streets of New York, he felt a similar rush as he felt during his first days of being Spider-Man. It was a little reckless, definitely dangerous, and so much fun. It felt like freedom. He understood that Tony was just trying to keep him safe, but it was stifling to have someone constantly looking after you and checking up on your every bump and bruise. Peter was
- about this gets into the media,” Tony hissed, fist shaking slightly, “I will sue you and your organization for everything you are worth and more. And then I will drag your name through the mud so thoroughly that you will never be able to get a job in journalism ever again. And I mean that,” he warned. “I know your paper wouldn’t even publish a story like that without proof. But if any
Bucky looked uncomfortable, but he said, “I think we’re somewhere in-between. I’m trying to figure it out. Hey, where did you come from, anyway? New York? Because the rest of us were in Wakanda.” He gestured to where a few people were gathered a short distance away.
Science and Tech Day.” Fury sighed. “That idiot Osborn is still under investigation. And it could be that Stark was just tipped off about the radioactive spiders that day. Maybe he was inspired by it, or made some of his own. Who knows? Somehow, it seems like he’s linked to this Spider-Man. My concern is that if Stark, or someone else, has figured out how to create Spider-Man’s powers -”
Okoye stood beside him on his left, Natasha on his right. Their presence kept him grounded. They were the only thing keeping him from falling to his knees and screaming,
When Peter first acquired his powers, he would ask Tony and Bruce a million questions. (“Am I going to be able to form webs, do you think?” “What if it turns out that I can turn into a spider like Bruce turns into Hulk?” “If I grew eight eyes, do you think I would see things eight times better or would I just see everything eight times?”) He settled down a bit once they were fairly sure that he had stopped developing new abilities. Sticking to walls and hearing things were manageable.
Suddenly, Steve remembered a time when he was allowed here. It was painfully familiar, although before, Tony hadn’t been quite this bad; he had never shouted out like that before.
“So if you could find something else to do besides make MJ nervous at her interview with Steve today, that would be great.”
A few days after that, the super hearing kicked in. That was the worst part. Peter showed up at Stark Tower in the middle of the night, panicking because he could hear everything from blaring sirens in the street below to whispers a hundred miles away. Tony didn’t know what else to do, so he gave him a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. That seemed to help, but it was a temporary relief from a problem that wasn't going away.
Steve’s blood ran cold, and he tried to hide it by taking a sip of his drink. There was no way that Tony could know. No one knew. Even if he had seen old pictures, they were all black and white, and Steve had been younger, and Tony wouldn’t suspect him, of all people, right? And there was no reason for Tony to believe or even suspect that Captain America had been found.
“Okay, I know why I have beef with them, but what's up with you two?” Tony asked, noticing Peter’s equally sour expression.
How dare he? After promising him, literally minutes before, not to make this a part of his story, Steve was making a call that could threaten Peter’s life. Tony swallowed down the bitter disappointment that Steve the Reporter had turned out to be just like every other damn journalist in this city. And to think that Tony had been falling for this guy an hour earlier.
Thor, somehow, remained optimistic about defeating Thanos despite the unspeakable losses they had suffered. It was almost as if everything had gone so wrong and become so twisted that Thor was left with no choice but to carry on. He was on the edge of desperation just like all of them, and for the first time that Tony could remember, he looked tired. Dark circles appeared like shadows under his watchful eyes, and even his long hair was looking a little defeated these days. Tony didn’t understand; weren’t gods supposed to look perfect all the time? It was equal parts distressing and motivational: On the one hand, it couldn’t be good that even Thor was worn down. On the other hand, he was still making plans to defeat Thanos and if he could do it, then so could the rest of them. He gave them something to rally around.
Steve ran a hand through his unruly hair, grabbing onto the door as they ran through a pothole. “You don’t know that, Thor just told us they found two people making their way through the woods.”
After running away from Loki that afternoon the first thing Peter and Wade did was make another round on all the fastest rides, before hiding themselves in the corner of the donut shop and stuffing their faces with chocolate and icing deliciousness. Wade thought it would be a good idea to get back on the rollercoasters afterwards, Peter literally had to drag him away by the scruff of his neck. He didn’t want a repeat of the last time Wade went on a rollercoaster with a full stomach.
“I can’t!” Tony ran a hand through his hair. Boy did he want this day to be over, the stress of it was starting to make him feel like pulling every piece of hair out of his head. “I can’t, Steve. If I do that then there’ll be mass panic, every single person here will get scared and run like hell, someone could get hurt or worse. We need to do it carefully, get each person out of here safely and calmly if we’re unable to kill the Foniassaurus.”
Tony wanted to spew out the truth. He wanted to tell Steve that yes, he did come down there to ask for help but deep down he’d wanted to see him since the day he left. He wanted to tell him that he’d missed him, he was an idiot before for not being there for him, and that he just wanted a second chance to be the man Steve needed. He almost blurted it out until he caught himself and all that came out was half the truth.
Wade leaned over the side of the car to address Steve, who was watching the two family members in amusement. “So, Steve-o, how’d you get such shiny hair?”
Tony stared ahead, mouth wide open but no words coming out. “But…” he shook his head, there must have been something wrong with the tracker. “No. No, no, she climbed out, we saw the marks! She’s escaped, there’s no other explanation!”
“No,” Thor shook his head, pretty sure by the way Steve sounded over the phone, it was a lot more serious than that. “He sounded worried, and I could hear Peter in the background being not so quiet.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Don’t be.” He said softly. “I should have put my foot down, I shouldn’t have let them walk out that door.”
“Enough with the song.” He said, flipping through the pages of his clipboard, as the elevator they were in descended.
“Steve.” Tony whispered, without thinking he extended his arm to brush a hand over Steves. “Steve. I’m so…”
Tony was getting more and more agitated by the minute, and as he pulled up in front of the Foniassaurus’s building it become apparent that he had to fix this or he’d lose Steve even as a friend. So as the car stopped and Steve unbuckled his belt, reaching a hand for the door handle, Tony heaved a big sigh and mentally gave himself a good kick up the behind before he stretched over and grabbed a hold of Steve’s arm.
Steve and Tony jumped out of their skin as there came a loud knock on the driver’s side window. Tony twisted around to find Luke’s face almost squished against the glass, glaring down at him with his huge, terrifying eyes.
Steve ran a hand through his hair, taking deep breaths as he felt his chest begin to pain. He couldn’t get over how close he’d been to becoming the Foniassaurus’s next prey, how easy it was for her to get to him, to anyone. How smart she’d been to lure them into her home, to trap them, to kill two of his friends. And now she was free, roaming the island like a wild animal, a creature that was born in captivity able to hunt whatever she came across. There were over twenty thousand people at the park, every single one of those lives were in danger.
“Don’t Steve me.” Steve smiled as he removed his hand, making Tony smile in return. “We’ll do this together, okay?”
Tony just grunted in response before looking for Loki’s name and trying him too. To no avail not even Thor’s brother who loved his phone more than life itself was answering, and Tony wanted to throw his own against a wall. With one last attempt he tried his nephew again.
Luke smiled. “I wanted to ask you about the enclosure.” He said, catching Tony’s attention who was close to running as far away as possible. “We need to have it checked, we’re not finished yet but almost there.”
Steve gave Tony a look of disbelief. “If you were about to be eaten by a dinosaur and had no other way out, wouldn’t you?”
Sorry for the stupidly late update guys! I can't update very often due to work and what not but I'll try my best :)
After Thor had called him and reassured him that the boy and his dumb boyfriend had been found, and he didn’t have to worry anymore, Loki was seconds away from throwing his phone into the nearest dinosaur cage. But instead he’d decided to stuff his phone in his pocket and take a walk, far away from people. It felt like hours before he’d gone back to Main Street.
Peter began to panic as the dinosaur let out another piercing roar, he could feel Wade’s hand on his back giving him a push, his own panic evident as he began cursing the high heavens with every breath he took. Peter was starting to lose hope the further they ran, nowhere for them to go except straight forward, and the Foniassaurus was nowhere near giving up on its hunt. The younger man was about to pull Wade to hide behind a tree and hope for the best until luck would have it, just metres in front of them was a dense, hollow tree tilted on its side. Without a second thought Peter took a hold of Wade’s hand and led him right to it.
Tony spun around in his chair, not really surprised when he came face to face with the leaders of Shield themselves. Natasha Murdock and Matt Murdock stood there looking grim, obviously they’d heard about what had gone down, and were there to put a stop to it.
Wade looked confused, then surprised, then a light bulb went off in his head and he let out a curse. “Aw, fuck.”
“Tony?” Steve leaned forward in his seat, talking quietly with the older man. “I think we’d better get back to the control room, decide what to do next.”
Loki was beyond confused as he listened to his brother blab on over the phone, wondering if this was some kind of weird joke, or if the older man had finally lost his mind. He didn’t have to wait long to know that Thor’s state of panic was real, as the next thing he knew all hell was breaking lose.
Tony stared at the screen that still had the cameras connected, Natasha’s bleeding hand just about in view. Other soldier’s dead bodies were strewn across different screens from different cameras on their clothing, all mangled and bloodied from the massacre.
“I just… They were important to mom, she wouldn’t want them to fail. She put a lot of effort into them too, May.”
He slumped down on the nearest bench, next to the souvenir store on Main Street, and watched as people shuffled on by, going about their day at the dinosaur theme park. He took note of how unusual it was to see so many people around that area at one time, putting it down to ride glitches or a special event happening at the information centre soon. But he wasn’t bothered, he just wanted to relax. After panicking and almost losing his mind earlier, when Stark’s nephew and weird boyfriend had done a runner, it was nice to actually sit down and not give a care in the world about anything. Not that he cared for Stark and his irresponsible family.
“Yeah,” Steve kneeled beside what was left of the trunk, running a hand alongside it, noticing the large holes across it which were evidently bite marks. “They were lucky.”
Thor grinned. “Yes, sir!” he shouted as he struck a button a little too hard. “Let’s hope our little friend gets a nice shock when she tries to get past the fences!”
Wade looked down at the younger man and thought for a second. Then he frowned. “See, this is why you’re the smart one.”
Matt held up a hand signalling to the soldiers. “Get ready.” He whispered, more to himself than to the others.
Bruce swallowed the lump in his throat, and just went for it. “There’s uh… there’s snake DNA in her, which explains her large jaw… uh… cuttlefish… she had cuttlefish DNA…”
“Damn, Steve, don’t say that, it’s not your fault.” Tony exhaled, realising he was starting to sound just like Steve. “We’re both as bad as each other, huh?”
Steve grinned himself, aiming for his next target as it dived towards a person with his back turned. He pointed right at it, and took the shot, hitting the animal in its wing. It was like that for what seemed like hours, but was only mere minutes. Shield had most of the Pterodactyls down, as some of the team had led the visitors off the street and towards the boats, and Steve and Tony were running around helping where they could.
However, before Steve could even open his mouth the giant opened its enormous jaws, and gave out an ear-splitting roar. The sound was so powerful it sent the three stumbling backwards, and not one of them wasted any time in making a move.
“Let’s try the doors.” Peter said as they went in. “Maybe we’ll find a map or something, find out where we are.”
“Cuttlefish?” Steve cut across, eyes widening as he put two and two together. “Why on earth… Hank wanted her to have cuttlefish DNA?”
“But they weren’t.” Steve said, his gaze running along the mud, and as soon as he found what he was looking for he stood, yanking on Tony’s sleeve. “This way.”
Peter snorted. “I’m pretty sure that’s a lie.” He said, rolling his eyes as Wade grabbed his arm and started pulling on his sleeve. “You and jeeps do not go well together, Wade.”
“It’s an ankylosaurs!” Peter grinned, watching as the gigantic creature wrenched a large chunk of grass into its mouth.
Peter groaned, leaning back on the bench he and Wade were occupying. “You just counted the Triceratops Wade!”
Tony, being cautious, took unhurried steps in Steve’s direction, sitting himself down beside him just as slow. Steve didn’t even flinch, eyes stuck on what was happening on the screen.
“Keep your eyes peeled, try not to make a sound.” Steve began, as they didn’t waste another second and started to follow the trail. “Keep your rifle up.”
“Natasha’s in charge of the security team, Schmidt, what she says goes.” Steve felt himself get angrier, the German could have a go at him all he wanted, but he didn’t like it when he brought his friends into it. “You’ll never be in charge of Shield Security whilst she’s around.”
Wade snorted. “These are all veggie dinos remember?” he poked the side of Peter’s head. “They wouldn’t let us go anywhere near those steak loving big boys, you said it yourself.
Bruce merrily nodded, letting Tony lead him out into the brightly lit hallway, Steve following behind. Once they were there Bruce could tell something bad had happened by the serious look on Tony’s face, and he was shocked to find that Steve was trying his hardest to hold back tears. He’d never seen his friends in this state before.
Peter didn’t have time to ask what Wade was talking about, as the next thing he knew the older man was taking his hand in his and urging him to run faster. As he looked ahead he saw the reason why, and his stomach dropped at the thought of what lay right in front of them. Straight up ahead there was an opening through the trees, light just about shining through, but what made it that tad bit scary was the fact that it was the end of a cliff and they could just about see the waterfall on the other side of it.
“Peter’s smart, he would lead them back up West,” Steve went on, trying to think back to when he was showed a map of the old park. “I think there’s a couple of buildings still standing around there, on the way to the new park. It’s a long walk but they could have found a place along the way, or we might be able to catch them on their way back.”
Steve nodded, giving the dinosaur one last pat before he stood, following Tony back to the car. But he didn’t get far before he bumped right into the other man who was stock still in the middle of the field, staring out at the distance. Steve followed his gaze, and his heart skipped a beat.
“What?” Tony asked in confusion as he was pulled along. “Where are you going, Steve? We have to find them!”
And without another word Peter was tugging on Wade’s hand, and practically skipping towards the information centre, knowing that’s probably where they were going to go next anyway. Tony and Steve followed behind them, gesturing to the Shield workers who were waiting patiently for their next orders.
He knew Steve was no good with emotions, he hated letting people see him upset or angry, he’d always been one to hide himself away instead of letting the tears flow or shouting out loud what he was feeling. It’s one thing they both have in common. Tony was close with Natasha and Matt, but Steve was even more so, Natasha and Matt were like close family to him, so he couldn’t even imagine how he must have been feeling seeing what he did minutes ago. After yanking out his phone and typing a quick text, Tony ambled on over to the younger man.
“Peter, Wade, get down.” Steve said to the other two, who by now where on the verge of a mental breakdown. But they did what they were told, and ducked as far down in their seats as they could. “Tony? Any chance we can lose these guys?”
Geared up in bullet proof vests, hard leather shoes, and rock solid helmets, each member of the ten soldier team stepped out cautiously into the forest. Matt lead the way in front, as his wife took the back, their most deadly guns held up at the ready. Some of the soldiers had Tasers as back up, some had brought their sharpest knives, some even had grenades strapped to their packs, ready for anything after the news of the dinosaur’s escape had reached them.
All of a sudden Wade came to an abrupt stop, letting go of Peter’s hand to clutch at his chest. “Shit, I’m getting old.” He panted. “And since when do you care what Uncle Starky thinks?”
So the engineer did.  It didn’t take long to realise what Steve was referring to, as etched in the muddy pathway were two sets of footprints, running for yards ahead of them and leading deeper into the forest.
“While you do that, I’ll give Bruce a call.” Carol said, making her way back to her desk. “See what our next step is to getting these people on board the boats without fuss.”
Opening its mouth wide, the Foniassaurus let out an ear-splitting cry, before picking up its feet and beginning the chase.
Peter chuckled. “We’re fine, we just got a little… lost earlier.” He said, trying to avoid the subject of jumping out of moving rides. “Hi, Steve!”
“You’re not… joking?” Bruce asked, merely a whisper. Tony shook his head. “T-The Foniassaurus… it’s escaped?” Steve nodded. “Nat, Matt… Jess and Luke… they’re…” The two men nodded.
“Yeah,” Tony fiddled with his phone in his hand, not knowing what to say in such a situation. He’d never lost a friend before, let alone two. “I uh… I’m sorry, Matt.”
Luckily for Loki, his brother was there to catch him as he fell. Thor caught him in his arms like he weighed nothing, just after he threw his riffle to the ground, the one that had shot the creature that had almost killed his brother. Thor dropped to his knees, gently placing Loki down, but his little brother wouldn’t let go, arms tight around his neck as he wept into his shoulder.
As soon as Steve got to Bobby he stood in front of him like a barrier, the Raptors bending their knees and ready to pounce. “Hold!” Steve bellowed at the top of his voice, arms outstretching in front of him. “Hold it right there.”
“I have a feeling it’s not.” Peter said, more captivated by the room they’d just walked in. “Wade, I think this must be the old building.”
“I’m sure Natasha can be swayed.” Schmidt said as he began walking around the place. “She’s up for anything that one.”
Tony and Steve stopped then, facing the two, as Clint couldn’t help smirk to himself as he carried on into the building. “Peter,” Steve said, a lot calmer than Tony. “It’s dangerous, you’ve seen what the Foniassaurus can do, you have to get on a boat.”
“There’s been a breach!” She bellowed, heading for Thor. “Thor, sound the siren! Scott, call security, get them out to Main Street, NOW! The Pterodactyls have breached their cage, and they’re heading straight for Main Street!”
“We have to get that Foniassaurus, Tony.” Steve said seriously, just as Tony was getting off the ground and helping him to stand. “It has to die, it’ll kill all the dinosaurs on this island, and it’s too dangerous.”
For the next half hour Tony spent his time relaxing, kind of, in the control room. He took a seat at the back next to Thor and went over the security checks that were in place, checked that the technology was up to speed, and discussed the days mishaps with his security officer Natasha, apparently two dinosaurs had escaped their compounds when nobody was looking but thankfully they had no interest in eating meat.
The jeep juddered and rattled noisily before stopping after a few seconds, Wade trying again and again to get it started, but unluckily the vehicle refused to come to life. Peter sighed, staring down at the engine and all the bits and bobs that held inside the front. He thought back to the time when he was younger, an infrequent time when Tony had babysat him for an entire day, his aunt May desperate as she had to go to a wedding somewhere in New Jersey. Tony had spent hours fixing his own car, hauling Peter along to show him how it was done, how everything worked and where everything went. Plus he was a good help passing the tools.
“Hi.” Bruce said to the pair as he approached them, the two sending him a small wave in return. “Sorry uh… sorry about the um…”
He was wearing one of his tight, blue shirts that Tony loved seeing on him, and trousers that complimented his rear end perfectly, not to mention his dirty blonde hair was falling into his eyes that made him look like he was on some kind of modelling shoot. Damn, he looked good. And it didn’t help when he pushed his hair back with his fingers, wiping the sweat off his brow. Tony groaned, he was so screwed.
