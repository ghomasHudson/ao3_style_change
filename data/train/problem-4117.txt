Cas stood up when Dean handed him the mic. "I'm happy that our family and friends were able to come. It means a lot to us. And I want to thank my mom and mother-in-law for their help in organizing everything. This has just been an amazing day. I can't think of anyone I'd rather spend it with."
The alpha looked over at the young omega, eyes scanning his porcelain skin, dark, messy hair, bright blue eyes, and his small, young, frame. He ran his thumb across Cas' cheekbone, making the omega look at him.
The alpha pulled Cas off, looking at his spit-slicked lips then leaning down to kiss them. Cas moved to get up, not breaking the kiss, jumping to wrap his legs around Dean's waist.
The moan that came from Cas egged Dean on, adding a second finger. The omega arched off the bed, pushing back on Dean's fingers.
"You're welcome, baby boy." Dean pulled Cas into his side, grabbing the tv remote from the coffee table.
I edited and added more tags. So, before you read, I would check them again. I want to make sure I don't offend or trigger anyone.
As soon as Dean left, Cas grabbed a box from under his bed filled with different fake knots he used when he was going through his heats. He quickly stuffed it into his suitcase and covered it with clothes so it wouldn't be seen.
The omega served Dean's plate first, earning Cas a kiss on the cheek and a lingering touch on the waist, before serving Benny then himself.
The omega hung up abruptly, cursing. All he wanted was the band to play the perfect song for the first dance. He groaned and tossed his phone on the coffee table, wincing when it made a noise. He had enough trouble putting Claire down for a nap, he really didn't want to wake her by making noise out of frustration.
After the appointment, the couple went back to their apartment. Cas was in a much better mood after seeing the doctor. He went to the kitchen and hung up the sonogram picture on the fridge. Cas smiled, looking at the picture, seeing the tiny body starting to form.
Cas cuddled into the warmth of his alpha, resting his head on Dean's bare chest. Dean covered the up with the blankets, tucking them in from the cool air.
"Of course I promise." Dean sat next to Cas, wrapping his arms around him. "You can't get rid of me. You're stuck with me. I'm all yours, baby."
It wasn't long after that the teacher and more people came in. Cas made sure to exchange numbers with Charlie and Gilda after class.
Dean dropped his hand, nodding. Cas gave him another small smile before walking off towards the dorms.
"Come on, Charlie. A club? Really?" Cas rolled his eyes. "I am not in the mood for grinding and loud music."
Once everything was in order, Dean carried their luggage to the the impala and they were off to the hotel in the neighboring town. While Dean drove, Cas was on his phone on Instagram, scrolling through his feed. He turned his camera on and took a picture of Dean driving, adding a filter with a caption "Going out of town with alpha."
"Right," Cas muttered. "I gotta pee," he said, struggling but succeeding in getting up from the couch.
Dean held back a laugh. He patted Cas' ass, still over his shoulder. "Calm down, baby. I know I'm yours. And you're mine."
Dean kissed the omega softly before leaving. Cas decided to fall back to sleep until the alarm goes off.
"Yeah, but they're all single guys. They're gonna want to go to a strip club. That's not my scene. Not anymore."
Dean held the camera up and snapped a photo of Cas. "No, I just like taking pictures of cute omegas."
"Yeah. I want to help save the country. That's why I wanted to go into the military in the first place," Dean told him.
"You're not getting out of going, Cassie. Don't make me drag you there," Charlie said sternly. "Meg, you can come, but you have to help me get Cas there too."
"I know, sweetheart. I understand," Dean assured, hugging Cas. "And I totally get if you don't want to ever speak to them again. Bobby always said just because you're blood, doesn't make you family."
"Just like this, sweetheart," Dean said, kissing his way up Cas' body, until he got to his boyfriend's lips.
"You better hurry or I'm gonna start without you," Dean hinted, pressing his palm into his growing erection.
Soon their food came. They ate while they talked about plans for the pup and some names. Cas hasn't even thought about Mick. He was just happy to be eating a lovely dinner, listening to nice music, talking to the love of his life on the most romantic day of the year.
Later that night, Dean went out to get takeout from the Chinese place down the street. While Dean was out, Cas was quick to put on the lingerie set Dean bought him to make up for ruining their evening yesterday.
Dean and Cas went outside to be alone to talk. Cas stood there, arms crossed, waiting for Dean to speak.
Later in the evening, Cas walked back to his dorm after having dinner with Meg, Charlie, and Balthazar. He was tired and full of paint from his 4 art classes.
After everyone ate, they gathered in the living room by the Christmas tree to exchange gifts. Wrapping paper littered the floor as everyone opened presents.
"Cas, you are the most precious thing in my life and carrying our precious pup. I can't think of living a single day without your beautiful face laying next to me. I know it's only been six months, but I know you're the one I want forever. Castiel Novak, will you marry me?" Dean proposed.
"Yeah, yeah," Sam sighed. "I have a student council meeting, so I'll see you at home later," He told Dean. "Amelia will give me a ride."
"Well, have fun in your new apartment. I have to get back to work. I forgot my office keys here." Gabe gave a small wave before walking out, closing the door behind him.
"Okay, well why don't you get some rest. If you want to talk about it in the morning, I'm all ears," Mary offered.
The omega stomped to the bedroom and slammed the door behind him. He sat on the edge of the bed, angry tears starting to fall. This is unbelieveable. Dean can't possibly be this naive.
"Thank you, Balth," Cas replied. "Guys, this is my boyfriend Dean. Dean, this Garth, Balthazar, and Meg."
Later on, Dean and Cas went to a graduation party Balthazar was having. They walked in the big mansion of a house, music pumping, kids dancing and shouting, and glasses clinking.
"Yes, it was," Naomi snapped. "Cas needs to realize what a loser you are. You can't even take care of him. What makes you think you can take care of a pup?"
Cas knitted his eyebrows together, looking at Dean. "No, he's not. It's just a coincidence. Besides, he's nice."
Once it was 2 minutes till midnight, fireworks started appearing in the sky more and more. Cas was sitting on the hood of the car, a blanket wrapped around him, watching the sky in awe. Dean sat beside him, a beer in hand.
He dragged himself out of bed to use the restroom. When he was finished, he went to the living room to stay on the couch until Dean walked back through the door. But he didn't have to wait. Dean was already home, sitting on the couch, fast asleep. Cas rushed over and flopped on Dean's lap, waking the alpha.
Cas knocked on the door, holding Dean's hand. Naomi opened the front door and greeted them, hugging Cas and shaking Dean's hand.
"No. I want to have pies since they're your favorite. I don't want this wedding all about me. I want you to have a say in things," Cas said.
"I know you're going to look at me different and won't want anything to do with me, but I didn't leave because I was scared. My dad kicked me out and threatened me not to come back or..."
"Hey, Dean-o," Gabriel greeted first. "We know it's early, but we wanted to drop off all of the baby shower gifts you guys got. There's more in the truck."
Cas mirrored his smirk, crashing his lips against the alpha's. Dean quickly dominated the kiss, licking into Cas' mouth. He helped the pregnant omega straddle his hips. Dean startled kneading Cas' ass, the omega's slick already wetting the pajama shorts.
As they were driving home, Dean decided to talk to Cas about his family, but before he could say anything, Cas spoke up.
"There's something I wanted to ask you first," Cas started. "I decided, well we, Dean and I, decided to have a smaller, more intimate wedding. So, maybe, is it possible to cut down on the guest list? Keep it just close family and friends?"
"So, I guess you and 'what's his name' are doing well," Dean commented, trying not to let his bitterness come through his words.
Cas went through the plastic bags, pulling out a bottle of ginger ale and a bag of honey flavored candy. The small smile on the omega's face dropped when he saw a pregnancy test.
"Dean, you don't have to pretend not to want to go to a strip club for me. It's not a big deal. I know you're coming home to me at the end of the night."
"We weren't trying. It was one of those rare cases where I got pregnant out of my heat." He didn't look at her. "We were still excited either way. I couldn't believe we were going to start a family."
Taking pity on the omega, Dean started thrusting shallowly, just enough to start pleasuring Cas. Little gasps of breath fell out of Cas' mouth as Dean slowly fucked him.
Cas grabbed a beer from the fridge, setting it in front of Dean. He went to sit on the other side of the table as they both started digging into the food.
Dean started putting his hand inside the back of Cas' slacks, squeezing at the flesh. Cas moaned, pushing back. The omega started slicking from Dean's touches and his warm breath on his neck. Dean pressed his growing erection against Cas.
"I'm sorry, baby. I have to go. We can finish this when I get back," Dean offered, lifting Cas off his lap.
Cas started sobbing, head in his hands. He couldn't stop his mind from thinking of all these possibilities. It would break his heart if Dean left him. Lisa would probably be so smug about it. She would win.
Dean laid Cas back on the bed, pulling the omega's slacks off, revealing his blue and yellow panties. Dean kissed his way up Cas' body, paying special attention to his stomach.
"Well, I can't have my pregnant omega doing house work. And besides, I took those hours to earn more money for us and the pup."
"E... Everything is fine," Dean managed to say while Cas was still working his cock in and out of his mouth.
"Let me get changed then we can go in the water," Dean told him, kissing the top of the omega's head before leaving.
Dean hesitated, not moving until Cas gave him a little shove. The alpha puffed out his chest to show he was a tough alpha. Cas rolled his eyes, trying not to laugh.
The omega felt his husband smile and chuckle against his ass. Dean started pulling Cas' panties down with his teeth until they got stuck around his legs. The alpha proceeded to rip the underwear off with little effort.
Cas' phone went off for the hundredth time that day. He groaned handing Claire to Dean before looking at who texted him.
"Okay, okay," Dean sighed, sitting next to Cas on the couch in the den. "You're probably right. I just don't want anything bad to happen to you or our pup. I know it sounds kinda crazy to get panicked at something so little."
When it came to dinner time, everyone sat around the table. They all held hands and said a prayer before eating. Cas smiled at everyone, happy he gets to be part of such a loving, sweet, happy family.
Cas smiled, kissing Dean's cheek. "I'll always love you too. You know, until you start going gray. Then I'll have to trade you in for a younger model."
"I had enough of his shit and wasn't just going to stand there and take it," the omega told him, wrapped around Dean's arm as they walk.
After they ate, Gilda ended up passing out while they were talking. Charlie wasn't too far behind. The mates succumbing to their exhaustion. Cas and Dean looked at each other, amused. They figured they would stay there just in case the newborn woke up and let their friends sleep.
"You're not getting fat, sweetheart. You growing our pup," Dean explained, chuckling at his boyfriend's pout. "Didn't you buy a couple of slacks that were supposed to be bigger?"
Cas was licking into Dean's mouth, slowing rotating his hips into Dean's hips, while pulling up the older Winchester's white shirt. The omega could feel slick start wetting his underwear and the alpha could smell it, making his cock strain against his boxer briefs.
Later that evening, Cas was in the guest room deciding on what to wear, holding shirt after shirt in front of him while he looked in the mirror. He groaned in frustration. Why was he so nervous? It's just dinner. It's not like he hasn't been on dates with Dean before. He was rusty on the whole, flirting conversations. After Dean left, Cas barely even dated those 6 years. Nothing serious. Not even any intimate ones.
Dean got up abruptly, turning to look at Ben. "Hey, kiddo. It was nice meeting you. Maybe your mom will let me see you again. I got to go. I'll hopefully see you later."
Cas gulped. He wasn't sure if Dean was continuing to flirt and want to do something or Cas is just reading the signs wrong. He was too shy to ask Dean about it. He just went with the flow.
Dean looked away from Charlie, pretending to mess with his camera. "No, of course not. We're just friends."
Dean sat back down, unable to think of a response. How could Lisa keep this from him? He could have visited to spend time with his son.
Cas gasped in surprise when Dean hit the perfect spot. That's when he repeatedly snapped his hips in that exact spot, making Cas see stars.
"I want to redeem myself. I want to show you how much I changed and grew up. I will do anything to win your trust back."
"Well, I thought about telling them during lunch. After we all sit down, we can make the announcement and you can show them your ring," Dean suggested.
Cas obeyed, laying back on the bed. Dean took his doctor's coat and jeans off, leaving him in just his boxer briefs, before kneeling between Cas' legs.
Once they got back home, Cas sighed, throwing his heels out. Dean took his jacket off, dropping his keys in the bowl by the door. He walked to the kitchen, finding Cas already in there drinking a ginger ale.
"Fortunately, no. Sammy didn't say anything." The alpha let out a sigh of relief, chewing in his piece of licorice. "It was your fault to begin with."
After a few more shots, Cas was getting buzzed. He probably drank more than his other friends playing this game. Obviously, Gabriel was not happy hearing about all his little brother's endeavors.
Cas pressed his lips to Dean's. "You know, it's pretty cold. Why don't we get in the car and warm up."
After the two brothers were ready, they drove to school, which looked almost deserted at the time they came. They walked over to the counselor's office to get their schedules.
"I'm really happy for you, Cas," Sam said sincerely, looking at Dean through the glass door leading to the patio. "I kind of always knew Dean liked you. He always looked at you this certain way that I can only describe as love, but he never tried anything, of course because of the age gap. But, I had a feeling you two would end up together."
"Fuck off, Lisa. We were never a couple. It was just a casual thing we had. We would meet up to have sex and maybe get some dinner, but we were never together."
Cas sat on the bed, afraid of his legs giving out. He continued to stare at the test in his hand until Dean came over to take it, kneeling in front of him.
Dean led Cas back to their table, pulling out the omega's chair to sit. Cas smiled and thanked him. Dean kissed the top of his new husband's head and sat next to him.
Cas was still extremely shocked that this gorgeous guy is talking to him. He can't stop blushing everytime Dean looks at him.
The omega hummed in agreement, scratching at the hair on the back of Dean's head. "I love you, alpha," he mumbled, dozing off.
They laid in comfortable silence, listening to each others breathing, occasionally scenting each other.
"Cas, listen to me," Sam said sternly. "so what if these kids talk about you. You can't let it get to you or bother you. You can get through the rest of the school year happy. You still have your friends."
"I know, Cas. I wish they would accept both you. Hael and Samandriel miss you. Even Michael, Lucifer, and Raphael miss you," Gabe consoled.
The omega did as Sam said and didn't let it bother him. He went straight to his seat, not giving the kids a second thought.
Cas decided to walk towards Dean's locker. The alpha stood there, locker open, just staring into it. Weird. Cas walked over, touching Dean's bicep, startling him.
Claire turned to face the TV, her back to them. Once she started counting, Cas picked Jack up and went to find a hiding space. They settled on the closet in the two year old's room. Dean decided to squeeze himself into the towel cabinet in Cas and his bathroom.
"Not all the time. I mean it's traditional for alpha's to buy collars for their mates, but we're doing things out of order anyway. We're going to have a baby before we're even engaged," Dean explained.
The omega shed Dean of his flannel, running his hand down his soft stomach. Dean was built with broad shoulders, but his stomach was always a little soft, but not flabby. Cas thought it was cute.
"Yeah, but I wanted to walk you to the parking lot to make sure nobody messes with you," Sam said, concern in his voice. "Student council doesn't start for another 5 minutes anyway."
"with the pledge to love you today, tomorrow, always and forever," Cas repeated, his voice breaking with a sob.
Cas pulled away from Dean, wiping his bottom lip with his thumb. "Sorry, Sam, but your brother is very attractive. Inside and out."
"I'm going to call Dean to pick you up, okay? Then I'll tell the principal what happened." Sam told him.
Cas got up, wrapping his arms around the alpha's neck. "You had to say that twice? Dean, I'm not forcing you to say it. I just know that I love you."
"See ya, buddy," Dean called out as Cas walked out the front door, staring at the omega's ass. "Damn," he whispered under his breath.
"Babe, I'm a little too old to be dressing up and going to high school parties," Dean said, grabbing the shopping cart from Cas.
Dean easily pushed back inside Cas, starting at a slow pace again. He brought Cas' legs up to rest on his shoulders as he pounded into the omega.
The alpha swallowed Cas' moans and whimpers. Dean started kissing down Cas' neck, stopping where his mating gland is.
Cas smiled. "That's sweet. What if I pop out of a cake dressed in lingerie and give you a lap dance?"
The pregnant omega nodded, wiping his tear-stained cheeks. Dean brought Cas into a hug, kissing his forehead.
"Pick any three alphas. I'll kick their asses without getting a scratch on me." Dean smirked, taking a long drink from his beer bottle.
"Yeah," Dean sighed. He handed over the bowl of dry cereal to Sam. "Here. Eat something. I'll go get ready for school."
Cas sat up, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hands before looking up at Dean. "I want you to fuck me on our new bed. You know, like christen it."
They stayed there, holding each other, breathing in each other's scent. It wasn't until Cas started snoring that Dean decided they should move to their bedroom.
"Why does it matter? He's out with Gadreel," the alpha said, his shoulders slumped. "It's not like it's going to make a difference."
"You most certainly can," the alpha said, eyeing Cas hungrily. "My name's Zachariah. I live right below you."
Dean took the hint and started unbuttoning his jeans while Cas pulled his shirt over his head. Once Dean was naked, he made Cas get on his hands and knees on the bed.
"Of course, baby. We'll be fine. I promise. I'll take care of us," Dean cooed, squeezing both of Cas' hands. "I'm going to get us that apartment."
Cas relaxed into Dean's warm body, smelling that familiar scent he's grown accustom to; leather, apples, and pine with the hint of cigarettes. "I love you too."
"Every alpha I met were always either trying to get in my pants or Charlie's. But you," Cas paused, looking at Dean. "You're different. You were friendly since the beginning. You never hit on me or even looked down at me for being an omega."
Cas watched Dean pushing Claire in the baby swing. He smiled and took a picture with his phone. He decided to text his mom.
Cas smiled back before passing by Dean to leave the field and pass through the school to the parking lot where Gabriel sat in his car.
"I made pancakes for us and oatmeal for Claire," Dean said, putting a fresh stack on the middle of the table.
"Well, I told all my clients and coworkers about you. They'll be happy to be invited to the shower. They're very rich, so hopefully they'll bring some good things," Naomi explained.
"We can throw the fish back. It'll be fun. My dad and Bobby used to take Sam and me to camp and fish."
Dean sighed happily, smiling, throwing himself on his bed. He couldn't be happier for inviting Cas. They talked and laughed and it was something Dean craved more of.
Later that night, Dean woke up to use the restroom and decided to watch tv in the living room so he wouldn't bother Cas, who was still fast asleep in the bedroom.
"Damn," He breathed. He couldn't find his key. He was ready to unload the content of his bags on the floor.
"I told you, he's not interested in me," The alpha said, his voice dripping with sadness. "Besides, he's already seeing another alpha."
"Look, I'm so grateful that you want Dean and me back into your life, but I'm staying right here in our home," the pregnant omega said.
"I told you that we might want to keep it a secret. If we decide to tell people, then you'll be the first person I tell," Cas explained.
The alpha wrapped a blanket around Cas' shoulders. "I'll go get you a glass of water and some crackers."
Dean watched as Cas closed in on 1st place. He smirked and started tickling Cas, giving up on winning the race. The pregnant omega gasped, almost dropping the controller, trying to move away from Dean.
Dean unlocked the door, motioning for Cas to walk in first. The omega smiled timidly before walking in.
The group chatted and ate lunch until the bell rang. They went their separate ways except Dean and Cas.
"We actually haven't discussed that," Dean answered, turning to look at Cas. "What do you think, babe?"
Dean pulled away from Cas, positioning himself behind the omega, his cock poking at his entrance. Slowly, Dean pushed in, the tight heat of his husband surrounding his cock.
"What?" Cas snapped before realizing it was just Dean trying to come in calmly. "Oh, Dean. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you."
He closed his locker, grabbing his backpack and jacket before walking out, passing a few stray students left dressing. As he was passing the bleachers, he saw Dick sitting on one of the seats with his friend, Crowley. The omega groaned, rolling his eyes.
Sam nodded even though he knew his brother wasn’t watching. Dean tried to keep his mind focused on the road, not let himself believe this was really possible. He focused on the day he burnt Cas’s body. He recounted every detail, remembering if there was anything he noticed that was strange but had been too overcome with despair that he had ignored it. He thought about how the body looked, how it felt to lay his lips on Cas’s one last time. The body had been cold in a way he had never witnessed before, but maybe that's just because it was Cas. He remembered the color of the ripped curtains he had torn down to wrap the body. Dean's eyes were brimming with hot tears. He rolled down his window to get the cool air on his face. He hadn't broken down in front of Sam yet, this was not going to be that day. The sky was heavy, and the roads were wet from a recent storm. It was Dean’s favorite kind of weather to drive in, but it didn’t mean a damn tonight.
Slightly intrigued he gave an expression of agreement. Why would it matter, he thought. He's omniscient, clearly he could tell there was no future where Dean or Sam could ever come back. The Empty has Cas so he was already returned to nothing.
Cas, a little unsure of this human tradition, wasn't sure what to do at first. Dean's hand was strong and gripping between his fingers locking his palm against Dean's. Cas's fingers were just open at first, but it felt odd. He tried to remember seeing humans holding hands and then he gripped his fingers just like Dean was doing. A small surge of excitement rushed through his human body. He felt slightly faint, his heart was beating like crazy, tingles were running up and down his arm to his brain.
Dean's phone rang stirring Sam out his dead sleep. Dean picked up the unknown call. In the hunter’s life you don’t screen calls, you know that picking up the phone can be life or death for the person on the other end. With all the pain in their lives lately, getting a call to help beat some supernatural ass was the distraction he needed.
Dean cleared his throat. "Ugh, yeah I'm fine. Just trying to smoothly ask my boyfriend to come up and watch the sun go down if you don't mind."
He had never used the shower in the bunker before, there was never a need when you could instantly clean yourself. The water was ice until he figured out how to make it warm. The sensation of almost falling on a slippery floor was new. Eventually he read, smelled, and used every bottle of liquids in the shower not really sure if he was following the directions correctly. Drying off he put his towel on an empty drying rod and started to look over the clothes Dean had given him. He knew this shirt, it was one he often saw him in when it wasn’t flannel and a jacket. Holding it up to his face to take a deep breath, it was Dean’s alright, in fact it wasn’t even clean but smelled of him in the most comforting way. There was a pair of clean briefs, and socks too. Cas put on everything but the socks and then brushed his teeth. He was very familiar with this part, when he was done it put it in the cup that had one other brush in it.
Before he had died, the bunker had begun to feel like home to Cas. Being there again he felt his body relax from tension he hadn’t known was building. The boys went to Jack first to try and prepare him. Meeting Jack was a proud moment for Cas. His emotions showed on his face as he held onto this boy he had given his protection to from the womb. As an angel he never imagined a life like this for himself. The chance to help raise a child of any kind was never meant for him. The joy he suddenly felt was intense, and not like an emotion he had ever experienced. He felt true pride. They spent several hours getting to know each other, eventually Dean and Sam slipped away to give them some alone time.
The giant being instantly disappeared and Sam could focus his eyes. He saw Dean still running, but there was a figure there. He knew it was Castiel even though it was shrouded in a dark shadow.
Jack wasn't sure how to describe it so he moved one hand to touch Sam's temple. In an instant they were both feeling what Dean was going through.
The kiss began firm but chaste. Dean didn't want to wait another moment and whispered, "I love you." Cas's lips gave way, opening to Dean as their kiss deepened. Their hands held each other closely while Dean's traveled to the back of Cas's neck.
"Guys, I...I don't know what to do. What's Chuck doing? Is he gonna leave us here in our own Hell on Earth? Are we about to be erased like every other world?" Dean was rubbing his thighs trying to calm himself.
In that instant they felt the ground rumble and fell away from them as they were transported straight up to the surface facing Chuck who was waiting.
Dean actually laughed so hard he had to put his tea down so he didn't spill it. "What did you see when you searched for salty teens?"
Cas felt Dean's breathing slow and eventually slipping away into sleep. As angels don't sleep he wondered if he should stay until morning or leave. He stayed there for at least an hour just listening to the sleeping noises Dean made. They had never told Sam they were lovers, and now with Jack it could get complicated. Eventually he kissed Dean's arm that was laid over him and teleported himself out of bed. He didn't want to make things more difficult. Besides, he could do research and try contacting heaven. As he started to pick up his clothes he heard a groggy, "Cas?" Dean was somewhere between sleep, and wakefulness, there was slight fear in his voice.
Cas gave his location and waited. It was gonna be an agonizing wait, but not worse than what he had just left. Maybe he could make sense of it all before they got there. He started to think of all his time with Dean. What in their history would be that reassurance that he was going to need?
"Cas, you've stayed in my bed all night before. If Jack sees something so be it. I'm not having our first night back together interrupted." Dean patted the bed where he had been laying.
Chuck had an agreement with the Empty. While it certainly has never been as powerful as himself it always existed, or at least it seemed like it. The thing about the Empty though, was that it couldn't create anything. It observed, watched, hibernated, and generally was a black hole to the entire universe. When it noticed Chuck was beginning to create things, using matter, it could tell it's existence was slowly being pulled away. So it struck a deal to help maintain its own existence.
He felt his heart unburden just a little. He was never one to have faith in anything, but for the first time he felt complete faith, and the peace that gives washed over him.
“I don’t even know what to say.” Sam was still grasping for meaning, some explanation as to how this was possible.
"Stop it, don't try that. No more selfless flogging. We do this together." Dean was never gonna let Cas leave again. Too many times in their past Cas would disappear, they would have a squabble and it could be months with no word. The thought of that happening now made his stomach hurt.
"Well, I mean you do come off as a macho hetero guy. I can see why Cas might have thought there would be no chance with you, he...I shouldn't tell you this." Sam wriggled on his chair and set down his coffee. "Cas once asked me if his vessel was displeasing to you. I didn't understand for a while what he meant, but it became pretty clear the way he would look at you, only respond when you prayed to him, and generally was only interested if you were involved."
“Oh of course, I’m not used to you needing that kind of stuff. Just give me a second I’ll grab some things.” Dean hurried off to his room and found his favorite tshirt and some other items he figured Cas would need. The towels were all fluffed and put away, Eileen had whipped them into shape on keeping the place tidy now that they weren’t having to leave at a moment's notice for every apocalypse.
Cas smirked, but not because Jack was already grown, and remembered him. He smiled at the small fantasy he had, had before dying. Part of himself imagined raising Jack with Dean as their son. Dean showing him the best of being human, and himself teaching Jack what it was to be angelic. That dream was only something he allowed himself in moments of weakness. He had almost been happy Kelly would surely die in childbirth for his fantasy to come true. It was his one dark thought, even now it still gave him joy visualizing Dean as a father. Cas knew he was not the angel he was before meeting Dean. That thought didn’t frighten him as it did so long ago. He had free will, he felt emotions, he was unlike most angels in many ways, and there was no way to explain it.
Finally he was there, just outside Dean's door. Seeing that it was open Cas entered. At a loss for words he looked at his feet not knowing where to begin.
Tears began falling from the corners of Dean's eyes as he laid on his back. He covered his face with his hands wanting to scream.
“Well, he...he won’t look the way you would expect. You’ve not been gone long enough for him to look as old as he does.” Sam tried to explain with hand gestures as he talked, which of course were lost to Cas as he was sitting in the back.
Dean pulled the two chairs closer that faced west and settled in. The sky was already on its way to night and the crisp air was coming in.
The clock in the main hall was reading 7:30. The sun was falling outside and Dean knew it would be dark in another 20 minutes. Going to the kitchen he put a kettle on. He listened to Sam and Castiel laugh about some old case in the early days and what a blunder they had made of it.
He pushed down the covers and wiggled under as Cas followed and got under on the left side as Dean turned off the bedside table lamp.
"Oh, no I mean the kid has so much to take care of." He lied, he had asked once. The night they got home from their victory and he didn't find Cas in the bunker. He didn't want to admit that he had tried and Jack hadn't answered his prayer, his desperate plea.
Dean and Cas were now walking up to the bunker. Grins on both their faces Dean hesitated for a moment in an awkward feeling of "this is what couples do, but I've never been in a healthy relationship my entire life moment" and then reached for Cas's hand. He was not going to let his inner failings and hate traps he's always set for himself get in the way of this. He wanted every annoying, frilly, frustrating, and joyous moment that has escaped him in the past.
"Cas, I burned your body! I'm the one who wrapped it. The one who lifted you to that pire." His words were filled with an angry pain that swelled emotion inside Cas. Before he could reply Dean continued. "My heart has been dead to the world the moment I saw that blade go through you." Dean beat at his chest with his last words. His breath was weak and short as if he could break hearing what Cas would reply.
Dean fought back laughing. He didn’t want to spook Cas or make him feel like he was being made fun of.
Eileen's prayers were like a checklist. She talked about all the things they planned to do the next day, what they had completed from the day they just finished. It was far more informational but still full of heart even though she didn't get a lot of time with Jack before he became God.
The both watched in silence but both praying in their minds. Praying to what or whom they weren't sure but Cas was the receiver of some of those even if they didn't know he existed in any form anymore. He was in their hearts and the only thing they had faith in anymore.
“Is he okay?” Cas said concerned, he knew they all would be a good influence on Jack, but being a baby it would be difficult for them both. Mary was with them though, she had taken care of a baby more recently than any of them.
“How long was I gone?” Cas was utterly devoid of time unable to tell if it had been days, or years. Clearly Dean looked similar in age, but he was much more worn than last he'd seen him. But even if it had been 30 years it wouldn't have changed the way he looked at Dean.
“What was it like?” Sam wasn’t catching all of the subtext, that was to be expected though as he wasn't fully aware of how close Dean and Cas had been. To him Cas was like a middle brother keeping Dean and himself working together rather than at each other’s throats.
Pulling two mugs from the cupboard he placed a tea bag in each. He hid his love of tea from Sam. He didn't want to hear it so he put them in an empty metal box of Saltines he had found in the bunker. These were a Hot Cinnamon black tea that had become his favorite. He poured the hot water over them enjoying the first intense smell as it began to infuse. He crept back seeing they were still all at the table. Cas saw him from where he was sitting. Dean motioned with his head and eyes to head topside.
He never understood being nude before. The shame that humans were supposed to feel after the fall and how morality became attached to what one wore was a mystery. But now that he understood real love, human love, he did know the act of undressing one another was exquisite. Standing close and having done it a hundred times before Cas unbuckled that familiar belt proceeding to undress the only human he ever loved.
Both Eileen and Sam watched Cas make his way to the staircase and take a mug from Dean. "Is that tea?" Eileen signed. "Yes it's tea, am I not allowed to like tea?" Dean said sarcastically with a hint of actual frustration. "No, no of course not that's fine." Sam had his hands up baffled and wanted to laugh as the couple headed outside.
“No. No he has no power in the Empty.” Cas realized that no one he knew with any real power could have done this. Did he have an unknown enemy to thank?
"Castiel" Jack's voice boomed, shaking the ground. "You have a choice, you can remain an angel keeping your true form and the chance to possibly find another vessel, or you can become human using the vessel you have bonded with and live a human life."
"What happened to him? Why isn't he responding?" Jack had never seen a human like this before. He felt the wind go or of him realizing Dean might be gone for real and this was the moment, the moment he'd never be coming back from.
“Welcome home, pal.” The skepticism was still in his eyes. If this was an impersonator the best way to find out would be to welcome them as if it were Cas and see how it interacted with everyone. He embraced this being that smelled like Cas, acted like Cas, but still defied all logic. Dean was good at the long game, and would hold back his approval until he could be with Cas one-on-one. Sam hugged Cas as well feeling like maybe he could let his guard down now that Dean appeared convinced.
"Let go Dean." Cas felt him do just that, sometimes that small permission was all Dean needed to finally finish. With small grunts and deep breaths Dean came in surges. It was a moment he never thought would happen again. His mind was left white, empty, and content.
"Look, we know it's useless. With one motion we are gone forever, but why don't you just send us to the Empty."
Cas turned around as a knot jumped into his throat. They were here, surely they could both tell it was him. But it wasn’t like the other times when God had brought him back. This was so different, he knew he had left behind a body. Dean's held breath forced its way from his lips as he swiftly got out of the car. Sam and Dean both walked up to Cas with questions in their eyes. If it wasn’t him they both felt themselves almost willing to accept this ruse just to have him back. Things weren’t always great when they were by themselves.
"What does it matter Chuck? This is all over. Let us be there, at least there you'll  have some trace of me, of us, your favorite characters."
“Yes, I...I’m back.” Cas sounded as uncertain as he felt. How could he be back? No one has ever returned from the Empty. He felt like himself, he had his memories. He knew everything from the moment he came into existence up until now. He had no doubts about himself, but he knew they would.
Blinking resting tears in his eyes Dean began to come back to reality. He didn't want to, his heart and mind were in a numb sorrow that felt right. He didn't want to be a part of a world without Cas, but he did love his brother and Jack.
Dean reached for Cas and settled his hand on what he could touch which was his knee. Cas placed his hand on top of Dean's.
Dean turned to face Cas, his eyes were brimming with tears that would fall the instant he would blink. His face was in anguish.
“Well it’s dark, and nothing. It’s like...nothing.” Cas made a slight shrug as he was trying to be supportive of Sam, to help him follow what he was saying, but he was breaking on the inside from what he had experienced. He knew it would be his future again. “I was sleeping, and I heard a voice that said my name, and I woke up. I thought you...had done something.” He looked to both of them, but could clearly tell from their faces they weren’t the ones to thank for coming back.
Sam was stunned, he didn't always give his brother credit for being emotional or much of a deep thinker. But, he realised, how could he not be? A new found respect flooded over him, and a sorrow for knowing how much pain Dean had been through while he's been loving every moment of this new life.
Jack watched the two humans he loved more than any others, these two men were his family. The only family he'd ever get to know. He savored the moment even in it's sorrow, it meant he was alive still.
“No, stop. We are going to drive in silence until we get there. If it’s not Cas we’ll deal with it then. If it is him...” Dean felt his voice choke, so he hid it by clearing his throat. “If it is him, then we have a win. And we’ll beat down all this shit that’s been happening. Maybe death was wrong.”
“Oh, well not usually, but I've started to finally read some manga that I’ve been wanting to read for years. The library in town has every copy, everytime I go in I switch out for the next one.”
"I never thought he could or has that kind of love for me. I...he...he's….oh god. He was an angel, I'm just human. It's always been Cas." Choking back more sobs he tried to control his breathing.
Jack's eyes were filling with tears as he began to fully process what he was getting from inside Dean. He felt sorrow, loss, pain, happiness, excitement, fear, loathing, sadness, joy, peace, and love. Love, for them of course, he could feel they were all family even after everything he had done Dean saw him as a son, as his responsibility. But there was more love, complete love. He pushed this feeling deeper inside Dean's mind and Cas's face came to him he saw and felt how the Empty took him. The feeling spread over him and Dean's mind quieted as well. Slowly Jack pulled his fingers away and waited. He just knew Dean was still there and still had things to fight for, he was gonna wake up.
"Dean, Cas sacrificed himself. It was the most selfless act anyone can do. I was going to do it for all of you. We love you both, but Cas. He was in love with you Dean. I don't know a lot of Earth and existing in it. But love, it poured from him to you from every moment I saw you both together." Dean made small whimpers and tried to clear his throat.
The sun was now peaking out from the tops of the treeline making them squint adjusting to the light. But the light was different, it shown blue, purple, and the most radiant white. Sam shielded his eyes unable to look anymore. Dean did for an instant but found he could see okay actually.
"It's good huh?" Dean was already halfway through his. He didn't have the restraint to wait and chanced burning his tongue.
This was the last test. If this was Cas he would be able to tell. It might sound like Cas and be convincing in other ways, but they would never be able to impersonate how it was between them. No one had known about them either. Dean had kept it quiet not out of any shame, but for protection. It was no secret how important Cas was to the Winchester boys, but no one knew Dean and Cas were lovers.
Cas and Dean looked at him very skeptical. Cas thought Jack was merely a baby so the likelihood seemed far fetched. Dean knew Jack was powerful, but how could a half-human half- angel do something not even God could do?
“Yeah, I was. But then I...annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back.” Cas sounded almost proud of that.
“The chair is fine, we'll get them in the wash tomorrow and you can borrow some more clothes.” Dean had set down his book.
Dean chuckled a little. "Sure, but she was human really. I mean when her and I, we connected. But it was not the same, she didn't have her grace even. I feel like the moment Cas pulled me out of hell that was it. I was his, it took me a long time to not believe it was just something Chuck had written though. I kept thinking this was part of a melodrama he orchestrated, I think he did with Anna actually." He paused reflecting on it all.
"Dean! Calm down! I mean you two looked in love for years but nothing. I thought, and I think he did too that his vessel stopped you two from ever being more."
Dean was an all over sleeper he didn’t really have a side. But he put his book on the table so he took the right thinking it made the most sense.
Dean grabbed something harder than a beer as he walked through the kitchen. It was almost a ritual of his own device now. He took out a low-ball glass, he enjoyed the sound it made on the metal work station. He pulled two large pieces of ice from the fridge clinking them into the glass. From the bar he pulled the whiskey pouring a perfect three fingers. Dean always fancied himself an excellent bartender in another life. He took a sip, the golden liquid burned and he welcomed the sensation. Dean went to his room, glass in hand. He paced in front of his desk for a while working out how to best test this Cas. His drink was gone and the ice nearly melted after his 6th lap. He still wasn’t convinced about Cas yet, there was too much on the line. He needed to be 100% sure or he would never be able to trust him with all that was coming. As he thought more, flashes of the moments he’d shared with Cas in that room came back. He turned his head sharply, closing his eyes tightly hoping to keep the exquisite and painful memories at bay. He thought of a small test he could use to see if Cas was at least still an angel. He whispered a prayer, “Castiel, I pray to you, hear my prayer. When you are done talking with Jack come see me. I’ll be up...we need to talk.” If Cas could still hear prayers it was just one more reason to trust in him. After some more pacing he turned to his old friend, the laptop. He settled onto the bed trying to distract himself. It could still be hours, and he didn’t want to rush Cas’s first meeting with Jack, if it really was him.
Dean's heart was beating like a drum in his throat and ears. Sam had never been so direct before. Usually he danced around the topic afraid of his brother's reaction.
"Did you really think...that I wouldn't have been with Cas because of his vessel?" Dean's voice sounded small and almost afraid to say the words.
Dean wanted to giggle a little, but he ate his laughter pushing his lips down tightly against each other. He placed his arms on Cas's shoulders and got a very serious sounding voice, "Cas, you are going die."
"I didn't allow myself to really believe it could be more. Cas's true form would burn me to nothing. I thought he loved us like brothers, I only let myself believe that, it was enough. I thought I could live with that, until Cas said it."
Dean shook his head. "I don't know how you can keep all of that in your brain. You've lived so long. Do you forget anything?"
"I didn't come here thinking this would happen, I mean... I hoped, but…" Cas wasn't sure how to complete his thought.
"Cas is gone." Swallowing back tears, emotions, all that comes when you've truly broken down his words were garbled. Sam patted Dean trying to soothe him, "We know, we saw. I mean, Jack, he went into your mind. We both saw, felt what happened."
"Stop, don't." Swallowing hard, he cleared his throat of the small choking tears. "I'm happy for you and Eileen, really. Cas sacrificed himself for me. I...I can't take that away from him. And we haven't seen Jack in months. If he could bring Cas back he would have by now." He sipped his coffee and held the warm mug like it was life.
He rushed off to the bathroom probably looking a bit like a spaz. His heart was beating so fast. Pure excitement took over him as he closed the door. He rested against the back of the door holding onto the bundle against his chest. His mind was spinning. He never dreamed he would escape the empty, he never expected Dean to have the same feelings for him. If he was living in his own personal heaven this day would be it. The sudden thought filled him with fear as he tried to not believe this was all a dream made to hurt him.
Cas smiled with his eyes. He knew why they hadn't told others, they had agreed a long time ago it was for the best. The world they lived in was so complicated and not becoming more simple. He didn't know what this year would hold, and if the Empty would pull him back tomorrow, this was more important. Laying the clothes back down he got in the bed pulling the covers over them both. This time Dean had turned on his other side so Cas would be big spoon. Cas drew him tightly against himself closing his eyes. He didn't sleep, but he could meditate. He took in every movement, smell, and sound as Dean slept. Cas would protect this man, this man he pulled from perdition so long ago, he was a guardian angel after all.
Eileen came bursting out through the door to see Dean and Cas down the hill in a tight embrace. Grinning she looked over to Sam who had the most coy smile.
Cas was stunned, but quickly returned the anguished probing kiss in kind. He tasted the tears from Dean mingle in their mouth. Those tears were for him, they were for them. The faint taste of whiskey was still clinging to Dean's tongue. Cas felt a deep sound of need escape him without having any control over it. Dean knew this sound, knew this response.
Dean locked his fingers into Cas hand that was resting over his stomach. "I've never been the little spoon before. It's...I like it." Leaning forward Cas kissed the back of Dean's neck. "This reminds me a lot of how I held you when pulling you out of hell. The hand you're holding was further up on your shoulder, but I guess it was a bit like spooning, and my angel blade was in this hand. I killed many demons that day."
Energy has to come from somewhere. When Chuck would create anything the Empty could feel it's matter leave. To try and maintain balance it demanded that all the beings, his angels and demons, had to come back to the fold of the Empty. One angel's mass was enough to offset what Chuck would take to create thousands of beings on his worlds.
They sat in silence as the sun and light finally fell to full dark. Near the bunker there weren’t many lights so the stars were always easy to see. “Something I never understood about heaven, was it up there in the stars? Like an actual location on a map?” Dean had a lot of questions he never asked because he didn’t want to sound stupid before. He was afraid to be the talking monkey that a lot of angels saw humans as.
"The thing about time is that it's relative. All my time as an angel I made memories, I can remember my timeline of events. But they are like spreadsheets of data. There is no life or love to them. It's not like reading a novel that fills in all that data with actual relatable content."
She play slapped at him, and he caught her hand pulling her against him. A little surprised she stumbled, but he held her tight.
"I'm so sorry Dean." Sam knew all too well what this feeling was too. Eillen was gone. He felt like he had only just found real love, true love and it was gone too. In true fashion it was just them again, all there was against the world. The Winchester boys, which now included  Jack.
"Oh yes one time I was looking in the cupboard when you were away and I was curious what Saltines were. I thought maybe it was something about teens being salty. I had seen that expression when being used online and thought this product was something Claire might like."
“How? I mean...where are you?” Dean knew not to believe it right away, though his heart wanted to so badly.
“No, it wasn’t a location exactly. It was closer to another dimension. If you continue out past the universe you wouldn’t end up there. You could only get there by being other, by being an angel, or a human soul brought there. But that’s the past, I’m not sure what Jack is planning for humanity now. It’s a little frightening, as a human when I die I actually don’t know where I’ll go. But that is the human experience isn’t it?” He reflected on his ignorance and found it oddly comforting for the first time. He had the same chances, and the same fate as everyone else.
He could feel the way Cas's body shook under him, almost like he wasn't expecting it, almost like it was something he never dared to think about. Dean wondered why he didn't say it before - it felt
"Yeah... yeah, that does feel pretty good." he smiled again, looking to their hands, and letting a sigh go. "Look, Cas, I... I'm sorry."
And just like that, looking into Cas's sparkling blue eyes, touching his warm body, and dancing to some cheese horrible slow song, he realized that this time, he actually believed that.
And after what looked like an eternity, the girl finally goes away, waving a smiley goodbye to Cas while closing the gym door. And just like that, here they were - alone. Just Dean and Cas, no one else. And it feels almost like a dream to finally be able to get close to the other.
Cas wasn't expecting that. He stopped for a moment, eyes looking away, confused, almost like he didn't know the answer. Maybe he didn't. Maybe tonight he was just a little bit more Castiel than normally.
Dean smiled. He thought about that too - the end of high school, Sam and Cas going away to college, himself going away for whatever job he can find, moving away from his father's house... yeah. Guess Cas had a good reason to be so damn happy tonight.
And when Cas's eyes started to glow in that so common and sweet way, Dean just didn't give a fuck anymore. He touched his lips with the other, and like always, it was the best thing he could have done. Kissing Cas was always the smartest choice. There was only one thing that was better than kissing Cas - getting fucked by Cas. But, hey, they could do that after all this.
The other rolled his eyes, but in the end, he just picked up an already ready playlist for slow dances, which only made Cas laugh even loud. Dean's hands went down to Cas's hips, and Cas's hands went all the way to Dean's neck, and it felt right. It always does. He spent the whole night wishing that he could have the guts to dance with Cas like that, together, in front of everyone, but right now - right now he knows, that this is the best way. Not only because no one was looking, but because it was just the two of them. And that was enough.
"I..." he started, Cas glowing eyes looking at him, their hands still connected, the empty gym looking almost scary without all the lights. "I just... why were you so happy tonight?"
"I'm sorry. I know you didn't even want to be here, but April was so sad about her date, and I just wanted to make her happy until she leaves." yeah, that looks like a Cas thing to do. "But I guess she took her time with that... I'm sorry Dean."
"Yeah, I know. You have not been in a party mood for the last two weeks." Sam said. "People even asked me why you didn't bring anyone as a date tonight."
"Because he has you," he said, and Dean's heart skipped a beat. "and you, Dean, you are... you are the best guy in the whole world."
He could play dumb and say that he doesn't even know why he's here. Even with him being a well-known face by the whole high school, that doesn't mean that Dean Winchester is the social butterfly type - oh no, that was Cas. Dean was just the jerk that just happens to have a handsome face and be good at football and was popular for that. But if he could choose, he would send all these people, all these self-called
"You're my boyfriend, of course I worry about you." how many times has Dean said 'boyfriend' out loud? Not many. "Look, angel, I just wanna make sure that you are... you know."
Sam laughed too, but it was far away from happy. The Winchesters have some affection to laugh at their own disgrace.
And his reason is out there, having the time of his life, while he's here, sitting at a table at the back of the gym, trying to hide in the shadows.
okay. But, honestly... just... be smart." he said. "Someone like Cas? Yeah. I wouldn't risk losing it. And I know it's really up to you, so just... I don't know. Keep that in mind, I guess?"
"Hey." he heard Sam's voice when the younger Winchester finally sits down at the table, smiling happily. "Where's Cas?"
But that didn't stop him from being just a ray of sunshine and delight to everyone, with made pretty much everybody falls in love with him. And honestly, Dean couldn't blame them - he fell too.
"I'm honestly surprised you stayed for so long." he doesn't say in a bad way, but that doesn't stop Dean from feeling like an ass. "Come one, let's get a Taco Bell special for you. It's your prom too and you deserve something good for tonight."
Yeah, unapologetic gay. Fifteen and already out for the whole goddamit school, no shame, no doubts, just him being him.
it was. He knew Dean and Cas had something, he knew Dean wasn't straight - and he was okay. He was, right? He... he seemed okay. At the best, he seemed worried. Worried
Dean turns his face to him, watching his expression, feeling the fear growing inside of him. Did Sam...? He never actually told Sam, because he never actually told anyone - fuck, he never said the word
"It's alright, angel. Glad you enjoyed." he said, and Cas's smile only grows more. How that's even possible?
"Chose a song, any song." he said, giving the phone to Dean, but warning first: "Just not Led Zeppelin, I
"I..." he started, and it took a while to continue, finishing in a dry laugh. "Guess he messed me up real bad, uh?"
It hurts not being able to hold his hands, take him away from all these people, and dance a stupid love song with him.
Cas laughed happily, loudly, but in the end, he looked like he had an idea. Then he picked up his own phone, open up the Spotify app, and Dean knew what he was thinking.
, to Hell. It was a feeling that he struggled with for a while - he really thought that he should adore the fact that he was adored, his father taught him that -, but now, he at least has the guts to accept that he hated being popular. He always hated attention.
And then Dean loved him too. And he tried to keep as a secret, but Cas was just so smart - and when his colorful smile showed up, asking the beautiful
Dean felt like an actor in a bad TV show with a horrible script because, damn, that was bad, but at least he was trying. Fuck, he was trying his very best here.
women. But hey, this is Kansas, he's 17-years-old and still lives with his fucked-up abusive alcoholic homophobic father and a dead mom. He could
He wanted to understand as well. There were no reasons for him to be this happy: Cas's boyfriend (Dean himself) kept him as a secret so he would have to go to the prom alone, not once dance with him, not once smile affectionately at him, not once kiss him. Maybe, if he was still in the mood, he would definitely get a make-out session at Dean's car at the end of the night - but that was it. Simple kisses, maybe a quick fuck, in the dark, away from everybody else. Even Dean was ashamed of that.
and, still, a secret. He just... understood. He understood things that even the Winchester was not entirely sure of what it was. He was happy for being with Dean, even though it was in the most humiliating way, even though he could have so much better. He just accepted, and smile, and went dancing with all the other students, unbothered. Dean didn't know why Cas kept himself in this situation.
"Cas my legs will give out if you continue." He looked up and saw Dean grinning down at him. Wistfully he pulled himself up, "Get on the bed." Cas said, gently pushing Dean back. He positioned himself on the bed as Cas removed his pants keeping his eyes locked on Dean who was matching his gaze. He went to straddle Dean's legs taking up where he left off. He began to cradle and fondle Dean's scrotum while his mouth continued to search. Dean's arms tightly grabbed the bars of his bed frame above his head. Cas may not be wonderful with words, but he knew what to do with his mouth. Cas pushed his hands under Dean’s ass and gripped it firmly, enough to leave his hand marks when they pulled away. He was taking Dean deep into his mouth when he felt it.
Cas fumbled with the buttons on Dean's shirt. Eager and impatient Dean pulled it off over his head leaving his chest bare with goosebumps prickling all over. Cas stared in awe as he always did when it came to Dean. He led his fingers gently over the warding tattoo then traced them over to his mark on Dean's arm. Cas felt the energy building as he laid his whole hand on top of the mark. Dean felt electric tingles surge through his body forcing his face to the heavens in ecstasy. Being more open than he ever had been Cas accidentally began to share his memories and feelings through their connection. In flashes Dean saw their timeline through Cas's eyes. He saw the first time Cas showed himself to Dean in that barn. He experienced the jealousy Cas felt towards the lovers Dean would take. All of the stolen glances he took, and the growing of their bond. Dean saw himself the way Cas saw him. It was overwhelming, and the truest moment he had ever felt with anyone in his life. Wanting to reciprocate he searched for that thread of himself. Pulling his memories he tried pushing them back through that connection. Cas breathed in sharply as a flood of Dean's memories crashed into his mind. He saw how early their romantic relationship had started for Dean. He felt how it grew from appreciation, to genuine admiration, to actual love. He watched Dean prepare his body, and witnessed his death feeling what Dean went through. Cas knew what he felt was love for Dean, but it had never felt so validated before. The surge proved their bond had held even past death. Cas felt bare and exposed in the most amazing way. He felt truly seen for the first time in his existence. When he woke from his trance of visions Dean was watching him with the eyes of a wolf, making Cas feel like the lamb.
Chuck raised his brow, "Why would you want to go to the Empty? It's worse than being written out of existence. I mean…" He tilted his head with a small smirk forming, "Wait, wait this could be good. Humans aren't meant to go there, you'd probably exist in there forever with nothing, no one, you all would never even find each other, I didn't even do that to humans in hell."
Sam found that with Eileen he didn't need to talk to communicate. While they often signed, and she could read their lips quite well, just looking at each other they were always on the same level of thinking.
"Oh it was not a good search. I turned off my phone right away to make it go away. I don’t suggest trying it." Cas was quite serious as he took a sip of the now cooling mug. His brow went up as the spicy brew woke up his taste buds.
Sam found Dean huddled on the floor, he didn't look dead, but he seemed wrong. Something was terribly wrong, even more than all existence on earth having just been erased and Chuck finishing it all.
“Yeah.” Dean’s voice was as cool and distant as ever. He didn’t give his name, normally whoever called knew who they are calling.
Castiel left Jack when they had finally discussed as much as they could in one night. His heart was full at seeing how well Jack was doing. He couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome, but Jack wasn’t the only one he needed to talk to that night. He walked through the kitchen and saw the whiskey bottle on the counter. He smirked lifting the bottle to his nose. He didn't drink often, it was more of a social activity to him. It took a lot for angels to get drunk and no one had the money for that.
“Cas, you need to know something about Jack.” Sam had already taken to Jack in many respects. He felt like a father figure, or at least that it was a chance to be a good older brother.
“Ugh, where should I sleep tonight? I thought maybe Jack’s room.” Cas hesitated waiting to see how Dean felt, maybe it was Sam who had been keeping the room clean.
Dean slumped onto his back in a catatonic state. His pupils were tiny dots in green. His face was raw with tears and flushed cheeks and nose that were bright red. "What happened Dean?! Where's Cas?" He kept trying to get Dean to snap out of it.
When they came back Sam and Eileen were already back in their quarters. They had taken over one side of the bunker and converted a few rooms into a larger master bedroom. All of what was left from the Men of Letters didn’t seem as important anymore but nothing was gotten rid of.
Dean interrupted him, they had found each other again, that was all that mattered now. "I never got to say goodbye before. Even if this was the last moment I could be with you for the rest of my life, I would take it. I won't risk this moment disappearing if you vanished in the morning." He hesitated because he hardly ever said these words to anyone, "I love you Cas."
Jack knelt down and touched Dean on his temples. He was glad he had his powers still as he searched Dean's mind and body for what was causing this. It was so loud and silent inside. There was every emotion and no emotion at once.
Every night Sam and Eileen would pray to Jack. Not in the traditional praying to God with a wishlist and confessional. Sam's was always talking about the day. He used it as a way to help cherish each extra day they had now, but also like it was writing a letter to a family member.
Sam came out of the bunker with two coffees in hand. He knew Dean had been quiet after they had defeated Chuck, but it was starting to worry him. Their hunter life was basically over, they could help people but not in the way they used to.
"When I took you out of hell my life changed. Suddenly I was feeling, I was caring, when I said you changed me it's  true. I am not the being I was before you entered it."
Dean threw his arms around Cas almost knocking him over. They were chuckling with joy not wanting to pull away from each other.
Dean laughed he couldn't hold it back. His head was raised to the sky as he tried to contain himself.
Dean gently pulled out lowering himself to the bed. He laid down spooning Cas with his face buried into the back of his neck. Their bodies tightly copied what the other was doing, and they cuddled almost afraid it had been a dream for both of them.
His hands searched Cas, but it wasn't enough. Without taking his attention away in a fluid movement he slipped off the trench coat laying it on the chair. Their entanglement of hands and mouths continued as they found that familiar comforting rhythm. Dean knew it was Cas, he had no doubts now. He didn't care how Cas had come back or who he owed for his only prayer to have been answered. He had the love of his life back in his arms, and it wasn't a dream.
"I...I don't know. I have never felt this before, even when I was human a long time ago." He had a concerned look on his face.  "I feel tingly, my heart is beating very fast. I feel a joy, but this is so intense. Is this a heart attack? Should I be eating toast?"
"Dean, I am going to need a lot of help. I have nothing, no powers, no money, no human history. It will be difficult for me to really be a human for a while. I know what you just said downstairs. And I want that to be true, but if being together like an actual couple will be too hard I can go, figure it out on my own and come back when I won't be such a burden."
Dean watched every movement, and every reaction that ran over Cas's stoic face. Cas bent down pulling off Dean's jeans leaving him bare. Still kneeling he rubbed his face against him like a cat. While steadying himself he held onto Dean’s leg as he laid a kiss on the growing desire. Gently pulling Dean into his mouth, it was warm and growing hotter as his tongue traced the delicate skin. He enjoyed this moment, when Dean was completely held by his attention. He explored with his mouth for longer than he realized. Dean covered his face with his hands raising his head to the sky. He smiled and spoke through his hands almost chuckling.
"Displeasing...He had the most beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen. I never cared what vessel Cas was in. I wish I could be with Cas in his true form. But I would burn to nothing in an instant. Even when he was human he felt to good for me."
