*sighs* That’s not even half of them.
Just so you know, most of the dragons are about the size of a cat. Pumarryn, Pyziedot, and Yzzial are the exceptions. Pumarryn is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, Pyziedot is the size of a large dog, and Yzzial is about the size of Toothless in How To Train Your Dragon.
did it? did it really?
Tony gasped quietly and rolled his sleeve up, revealing the words on the inside of his elbow, tears welling up in his eyes as he did.
yeah.
“Hey there, little guy,” Tony murmured. “We’re going to get you all out of here, okay?” The dragon nuzzled his thumb, then disappeared into his sleeve.
Nodding, Clint signed, “You smell like home.”
He wouldn’t be angry if his soulmate turned out to be a woman, though.
he told Steve.
I got an idea.
After a few long minutes, the glow faded, leaving Steve laying on the ground, utterly spent. Bucky helped him sit up while the team watched worriedly.
Tony spun around in his chair, swiping away a glowing map of New York. There was a blinking dot over the cafe Steve had been in just half an hour ago. “Hey, Steve,” Tony said nervously, leaning against his desk faux casually. “I wasn’t expecting to see you.”
The roof had always been Steve’s favorite place to go when he wanted to think. He would lay on his back and stare up at the sky, trying to get his thoughts in order.
Steve’s wings were way too big for him when he was younger. He would always trip over them or knock into things, he wasn’t strong enough to fly with them, and holding them close to his body made his shoulders ache.
What now?
Damn caps lock again. >:(
Ooo, nice headlock, falcon.
Sam watched him go for a few minutes before saying, “Well that was interesting.”
Yzzial said quietly.
Tony, what is this?
Maybe because you’re brilliant? Or because you’re an amazing father?
“Huh,” Charles said, sitting down on the ground. “This is not what I expected.”
“Who’s fighting, and can I watch?” Tony asked, pulling the door open, a small smile on his face.
Don’t worry, Steve. I’m keeping an eye on him.
Yinsen’s wings were already gone by the time Tony was brought to the cave. All he had left were ragged stumps that were extremely tender. The men that were tasked with guarding the prisoners thought it was funny to slap Yinsen on the back just to see his pain-filled expression.
Steve stared at him for a second before picking up the fork. He ate quietly, letting Tony fill the silence with chatter about the new projects he was working on. Their wings brushed occasionally, and for the first time since he was unfrozen, Steve felt content.
yay! the fire hydrant one!
“You’re not forgiven.”
my mom has already started sending me pictures of wedding venues
Queen dragons tend to be the ones that give the orders while the kings make sure everyone is healthy and safe. They’re also the warmest dragons because they like to curl up around the eggs and hatchlings. They are gentle creatures most of the time, and very affectionate as well.
that is one sexy professor
“Of course, Agent Barton.”
Aren’t you the one that told me that I had the sexy professor look going on?
we get extra points for every car in the pic
Pepper leveled him with a look. “Sleep. Now.” She grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the workshop. They went up the stairs, past Clint, who was passed out on the couch. Pepper dragged him toward the bedroom. “Go.”
“Why didn’t I realise you were that Tony Stark?” Steve asked as he sat in Tony’s workshop.
Eventually, with the help of JARVIS, he got the feathers done and began painstakingly attaching them to his wings. Emphasis on the pain.
“Will do.”
Tony heard Steve chuckle and say, “Dottie, please let Tony have his legs back. He needs to be able to walk.” Pyziedot just looked away from him and turned her attention to a door on the other side of the room. She walked over and sniffed the crack at the bottom of the door.
----------
Tony, why are there dozens of drawings of mechanical limbs laying all over the place?
“I have no clue, but I’m glad he did,” Clint said as he walked past, carrying a sleeping Gaigheiss in his arms. The slender purple dragon was covered in bandages. Chiepaer was following close behind, nose nudging Gaigheiss’ trailing tail.
There were things about Howard that only Tony knew, but he didn’t dare tell his mother while his father was still alive. He wasn’t going to now, either. He knew his mother would be crushed if she ever found out.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “I’m pretty sure that didn’t hurt the kid.”
“Okay, now that that’s done,” Bucky said, flopping onto the couch dramatically, “someone explain to me why it’s necessary for Steve to live here for the next few months.”
“Oh, c’mon, Stevie,” Bucky whined, draping himself over Steve’s lap. “I wanna know about your new beau.” He paused for a moment. “Hey, that rhymed.”
Steve looked up. Why was he on the floor? And why can’t he breathe?
Chiepaer nodded.
Steve picked up his phone from where it was vibrating on his kitchen counter. When he saw who was calling, he immediately picked up.
knives?
Nothing. I just wanted to scare you.
“I’ll be fine. Just make me look good.”
People were always surprised when they saw the undersides of his wings. They didn’t expect such a powerful man to have such a feminine color.
They would find out. He knew they would.
As Steve settled in, he thought back to all the things his mom and Bucky had said about his wings.
“You look tired,” Tony commented after he pulled away from the hug. “Get some rest. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
the next week
“They’re great!” Clint answered with a grin. “You did this in three hours?”
some of the things on the list may require all of us being together
Tony was currently curled up in a ball in Rhodey’s arms, crying his eyes out.
They did make sure we took the stuff off of it afterward, though.
Steve woke up when the door to his bedroom was pushed open. He started to sit up, but stopped when he saw the glint of red and gold scales.
Bucky tackled Steve to the ground, and the two grappled with each other, Sam laughing in the background.
Yzzial shifted so that his head was squarely on Steve’s chest.
“That actually makes sense,” Steve said, nodding thoughtfully.
what happened?
It didn’t.
Along with waterboarding, electrocution, and starvation, the Ten Rings did both on a regular basis.
“Thought what?”
But do you have to leave your idea all over the house?
Steve hesitated for a moment before sliding over and wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Is this better?” he asked.
“That’s my son,” Sarah said, chuckling. “And he was in the military, so he always looks like that when he’s not paying attention.”
He cares about you.
Bruce just shook his head and did as he was told.
“Hey, Steve, it’s okay,” a voice said, gently pulling his hand away. Red and gold wings wrapped around him, metal tips cool against his skin.
“What’s wrong?” Bucky asked worriedly. He’d never seen his friend like this when Steve was tiny and was beaten up daily, and definitely not since he had a growth spurt.
i thought we were in for it, but they just thought it was funny.
How about you? Have you forgotten that Clint teaches archery to small children?
why do you always try to embarrass me?
I’m in Malibu. Brucie’s staying with me for a while.
“That’s great sweetheart!” She said. “Let me see- oh, honey.” She looked up at her son’s excited face sadly. Her husband looked over her shoulder, eyes bright, before his face fell.
“This is so cool I’ve never seen a jet like this before.”
“Tony!” That was Steve. Steve was back and calling for him.
“I detect sarcasm.”
Taking the plunge, Tony formed a text and sent it to the alpha before he could talk himself out of it.
“Thanks, J.” Tony hummed. “Shit!” The brunette gasped, tripping over something that had been left in the middle of the room. He looked down, spotting an abandoned quiver full of arrows. “Fuck you, Barton.”
Steve nodded. “And more coffee.”
Steve looked like he was having a debate with himself. “Okay. Just be careful. Don’t leave the territory or-”
“Okay.” Tony grinned, pulling back a little from their embrace but not entirely.
“So much for the element of surprise,” Bucky muttered from beside the alpha.
“I like how there’s a T on the cake.” Steve grinned, looking at the cake. “Good job guys.”
The meal was very good, the group of wolves had chatted a lot, mainly the two deltas and the beta, telling Tony a bit about their pack and past life. Like Bruce, Natasha and Clint worked for SHIELD but were agents. They had been before making a pack, but still ran missions to help shifters across the country. The omega kept his past close to his chest. He gave the odd answers here and there about his pack but managed to avoid ones that pried too deep. The other three wolves seemed to pick up on this and avoided talking about the omega’s past too much, asking more about his plans and projects for SHIELD, which Tony was much happier to talk about.
“I honestly don’t know how to respond.” Steve laughed, looking over at his pack that was ahead and already greeting both Agents Hill and Coulson.
“What we up to then?” Tony asked the group, most of which just shrugged back.
Tony weighed up his options. Either he ran back to SHIELD as a wolf, scaring a load of humans and potentially getting himself in a lot of trouble. He could wait and try and call for a taxi with no cash on him or he would have to give the walk of shame back inside in front of everyone and see if he could get a lift back home. He didn’t want to do any, especially the last one. However, his options were answered when the front door opened and closed behind him.
“I'm absolutely okay with that,” Tony replied as he unbuttoned his dress shirt. “Maybe Clint is right, you are whipped.”
“Yes.” Pause. “Why do you ask?”
“I love you.”
“Steve I need to talk to you about something, but I don’t want you to hate me for it.” Tony began, looking down at the floor. “I haven’t planned this at all so some of it is going to be a bit of word vomit.” Steve didn’t say a word causing Tony to look up, the alpha only nodded as he licked his chocolate ice cream.
“Of course. I know you missed it and it gives you a distraction. I’m not going to be able to stop you. As long as you let me know next time, instead of sneaking off at 2 am. I would rather you wake me.”
“I’ve had three cups of coffee this morning and I’m nowhere near as energetic as you.” Tony groaned as Steve pulled him past the tree-line.
Steve really couldn’t wait to have children with Tony now. Especially if this was going to be the result.
“One of my less than genius ideas. I heard Rhodey come in and I was standing on the toilet seat, so my feet couldn’t be seen from underneath, and Rhodey had done a poor job of looking for me in there. So, after he left, I just wanted to make sure he was gone and instead of opening the door like a normal person, I came up with the greatest idea, to be sneaky and poke my head under to have a look around, because he wouldn’t notice that. Of course, I ended up getting stuck and how much of an embarrassment I had been was I was nine.” Tony answered, head in his hands. “But I was nine.”
“My aunt and uncle looked after me with their pack.” Peter bit his lip, eyes watering. “Are they dead too?”
Bucky let out a laugh, crossing the car park to get to the other room. Bucky knocked on the door before unlocking the door to get inside.
“Of course, Sir.” JARVIS replied before the sound increased, Tony bobbing along to ‘Rock You Like A Hurricane’ by Scorpions as he worked on DIEGO.
“You lot need to live a little.” Tony pointed to them all, each one of them had a questioning face. “Library at MIT. Twice.”
“ETA 5 minutes on backup.” Natasha’s voice said through the comms. “Strucker is still contained.”
Tony’s eyes squinted at the light change, looking from the shirt he had in his hand before the blonde who was still sat in bed. “I decided to pack my things, I won’t be able to get back to sleep for a bit so.” The omega shrugged.
Tony sat up in bed, smiling at Steve who was still sleeping beside him. Steve had apologised to Tony later that day, he knew he was out of order. Tony understood that the alpha was just scared of losing him again, but to not allow him to go into the kitchen alone was crazy.
I have other ideas too but not so much planned out as these lol.
“You started it.”
“My folks died when I was young. I was six when my dad died, and eleven with ma. But my uncles, not biologically but they were still my uncles, raised me, along with Bucky. You know, until they were killed.” Steve paused taking a deep breath. “We were eighteen, there was an ambush and only Bucky and I made it… Even though Buck lost his arm, we still survived. We hadn’t long crossed the border into Pennsylvania, I had to carry Bucky until I found a main road, and luckily, we were picked up by a stranger who dropped us off at a Shifter Hospital. From there, SHIELD helped us, and we’ve been with them ever since.”
“Not a threat!” Tony rushed out, his hands shot out in front of him to keep his long-term friend in his place, Tyler also looking concerned for the omega. There was so much protectiveness radiating from the three alphas’ over the small wolf, Tony felt claustrophobic.
She gave a soft smile before kissing his forehead. “I’ll call you later? Maybe I can come over to yours tonight? We can watch a movie or something?”
“Thanks, Tyler, but I need to make sure he gets home safely. I promised Steve I would look after him.”
The omega let out a soft whine, his left foreleg and paw hurt as he stood to have a look what broke his fall, or more like who. Tony’s ears flattened, tail going between his hind legs as he shrunk down so he was lying on the ground at the sight of a large golden alpha wolf. The alpha leaned in close, his blue eyes closing as he sniffed the omega, Tony rolling over onto his side to show he wasn’t a threat. A wolf’s most vulnerable position was when their chest and abdomen were on show and subordinate wolves would lie on their side or back to show these parts off to a dominant wolf to prove they weren’t a threat.
“I said I love you too.”
The omega reached his and Steve’s bedroom. It had been so long since he was in here last. Tony let out a content sigh as he sat on the bed.
“I missed you too.” Steve cupped Tony’s jaw gently with his free hand. “So much. I think the pack got fed up of me talking about you.”
This led to the pair sitting in Bruce’s lab, Tony on one of the counters after thoroughly looking at the equipment, deeming it good, but they can and will be better. Because of him, of course. Bruce was enjoying the company considering he usually worked alone. Tony was quite good to get along with once you got past the occasional sassy comments he gave out now and then.
“And helping me to avoid my problems.”
“Yeah, we tend to be observed a lot.” Fire spoke up from the bed.
“Yep, that’s me.”
“I told you, Bruce. Nothing to worry about.”
Steve did as he was told, squeezing his palm shut. There was a quiet humming noise as the boxes rustled before the shield came back, the blonde catching it on his arm. The alpha looked at Tony, eyebrows raised.
“Come on, we’re going shopping.”
“Ha! I win!” Loki smirked, looking over at the defeated Thor. “I’ll have my usual, Clinton.”
“This place is mould city,” Sam replied.
Tony nodded in response and slid off the stool as the pack continued to talk amongst themselves. He walked out of the kitchen and made his way up to the top floor and over to Steve’s door, knocking on it gently.
“Tony Stark late for a meeting? Who would have guessed that would ever happen?”
“I’m not a good omega. I’m never going to be a good enough for any alpha. I’m not like the others. I just-” The omega was bawling as he cuddled into Bruce, holding the delta close.
“I really am his mate. He’s been here. You don’t have to lie.” Steve growled at the receptionist.
“Our bedroom is on the top floor?”
The pack continued to discuss before looking over at Tony, who was petting the bots, smiling as they beeped happily.
The feline shifter nodded. “They’ve kidnapped both humans and shifters before. They’re trying to make humans into shifters by combining our DNA. They tried it with alphas first, so the shifter army would be strong. But it didn’t end well.” Fire stared over at the brick wall, Tony following her glaze to where there were deep claw marks.
“Obviously,” Sam smirked over at the archer.
He thought to himself, looking up as the door opened again.
The two nodded before running off, Steve walking in the opposite direction. He cursed at himself for letting the alpha get away from them earlier, luckily Natasha, Bucky and Loki took down The Baron and it seemed no more HYDRA agents were coming for them, they just had Rumlow to find now.
“We’ll work something out. But at least for now, you can go to and from work with Bruce. Or if any of the others are around while he isn’t you can go with one of us. I can’t let you get taken away again.”
“I’ll still help out whenever I can, Sir,” JARVIS replied.
“Coffee?”
“Clint Barton.” The archer spoke, hand on the pad.
“I’m not Umbridge.”
“Oh, well, thanks,” Tony replied sarcastically, putting emphasis on the thanks.
Tony let out a whine, struggling against the beta guard as he pulled him down the hall, back to his cell. He continued to fight against it, all the way into the room. A set of clothes were placed on the floor as he was released from the catcher pole. The guard only just managed to escape the room, narrowly avoiding a bite from the omega.
“Didn’t get much sleep?” Bruce asked, looking the omega up and down.
“Come on, beautiful, don’t resist it.” The alpha grabbed Tony’s hips, pulling the omega close to him so his crotch was rubbing against the omega’s bum.
The sound of something dropping onto the carpet made Steve’s head turn. Phil Coulson stood there, confused expression as he looked around.
“They’re not my pack.” Brooke gave a confused look at the omega’s statement, but he cut in before she could question him further. “Did you want to sit with us?”
Sunlight started to deep through the trees, their surroundings becoming brighter as they walked into a grassy clearing. The grass almost came up to Tony’s underbelly, but it barely reached Steve’s mid-leg. The clearing had a range of wildflowers surrounding the edge and a slow-moving river just off to the side that ran throughout the forest.
“What? Why? I need to get my car keys first.” Bruce looked at the omega confused.
//“No one is forcing you, but your friend is right, you deserve to be happy. If you think Steve can give you that happiness, then you should at least give it a shot. You’ll only regret it if you don’t.”
“Clint!” The omega lent down, smacking the archer’s head.
“To be fair, Clint, you do have a bit of a reputation for winding up our alpha.” Bucky shrugged.
“Never have I ever… Been arrested?” Scott started and Tony was the only one to drink.
“Absolutely not. We can’t lose our jobs. Let’s get you back to your room and go from there.” The delta reasoned, leading Tony over to his car. After ten minutes of trying, he managed to get the laughing omega into the passenger seat and buckled in. He had no idea why Tony was laughing at the word knees, but at least he wasn’t upset anymore.
“Yes. I do.” Tony smiled, leaning up to kiss Steve softly.
“Where is everyone?” Steve asked, Bucky shrugging in response. As far as he was aware, no one was on a mission or working, everyone was in the house, but it was silent, which was very unusual when everyone was home.
Tony nodded in reply. “I’m here to help. I wanted to make sure you were both okay, potentially answer any questions. I know those HYDRA jerks wouldn’t be looking out for you at all.” Tony paused. “How’s it been adjusting to things? Especially your senses. It must be a big change.”
“I’m, um, Steve.”
It was obvious that they were both lying. The destruction of a whole pack brought back many horrific memories for them both. But they had a job to do, and if they could save someone from the same fate that they had everything would be worth it.
“Oneself.” Tony mocked. “Someone’s been taking etiquette lessons from JARVIS.”
“Too old.” The omega took the knife that Natasha had passed to him so he could cut it. “But that’s very creative.”
“We need to test this theory… Could you get something of the omega’s? Something that would smell like him just to see his reaction.” The beta asked.
“Jesus Christ.” Tyler stared at Tony as he walked back over, handing over a beer to Rhodey.
“I did the same.” Bruce walked over two mugs of coffees in his hands. He passed one to Tony before continuing. “Before we became a pack, there would be times when we would work together on missions, though we were never as one big group. We had different abilities that we could give. Though, one time we all got put together. It felt like we were a proper pack, Steve leading us as an alpha should. So, when Steve asked me to join in on an actual pack a few weeks later, I was excited, but I was nervous too. We had only worked together twice, and he knew about my wolf form, but I was still worried about being in a pack and what that would do being around other shifters all the time. Since the accident, I hadn’t been in a pack, let alone with people I didn’t even know that well and two of them aren’t even wolves. But it worked. We’ve been a pack for five years now and it’s been amazing, Tony. I’ve learnt to control my wolf form more and he respects Steve as an alpha. It's more than what I could have wished for. We’re a weird mix of shifters, but it somehow evens out, though we do have our problems here and there.”
Wow, chapter sixteen already. I hope everyone is still enjoying it. We're getting closer to the end of the first book and I'm super excited. I honestly don't know how much I'll be posting next week because I'll be super busy. But I hope to at least get the next chapter up.
Rhodey left to go toilet after the song had finished, Tony leaning into Tyler, arms wrapping around the alpha’s neck. He rested his head on the blonde’s shoulder, going on his tiptoes so he could reach, alcohol already taking effect. It didn’t help that he started drinking at 10 am this morning and all he had was four slices of pizza to eat. The drunkenness was soon returning.
“I’ll be ready in five minutes and we’ll have to go.” Steve sighed against the omega’s neck. “I wish this night could have lasted longer though.”
Tony could hear Clint’s laughter coming from the roof as the alpha started to shout at the archer. The omega bit his lip before quickly running out of the kitchen before Steve could find him. He had been working hard on equipment upgrades for the pack and had just given Clint’s his; explosive arrows for the archer’s birthday.
It took everything in the blonde to not crash the car as he launched himself at his two packmates who were making his life hell right now.
“Is this all you wanted to talk about? Because I have lots of work to be getting on with and this isn’t a three or higher.”
Pepper let out a breath. At least Tony was responding now. “Do you want me to come in?”
“Yes, of course.” Tony smiled at the alpha. “Who else would be their parent?”
The alpha closed the gap between the two of them in a soft but short meaningful kiss. Steve pulled back, his thumb carefully brushing against the omega’s cheek. Tony blushed a little, turning to look at the other two alphas. Rhodey had raised eyebrows and Tyler looked amused.
Reasoning: Rhodey just had to be an alpha, protective of his “brother” Tony. I knew I didn’t want Rhodey and Tony in the same pack, but I still wanted them to be childhood friends, that’s why I had their packs as allies. I debated on the coat colour for a while. It was a toss-up between, grey, brown and black. Sam ended up with brown, Bucky with black and Rhodey with black.
There was a loud and repetitive banging coming from the door. Tony stumbled to get out of his seat, almost empty bottle of rum still in his hand as he made his way to the door. His vision blurry as he stumbled to the door, but made it there nonetheless. The pack had been gone for so long. Tony knew they would be back soon, but he wasn’t sure exactly when.
“Having fun?” Steve asked, head tilting.
“Yeah.” Steve nodded.
“Hey, Steve… Y-yeah I’m okay, kinda. I was hoping you could come and meet me as soon as possible.” Tony bit down on his lip. “Mario’s Ice Cream Parlour… Mhmm… Okay, I’ll see you then.” Tony hung up and looked over at the strawberry-blonde.
“Take him to the new recruits. We need everything we have got.” The Baron spoke in German, Tony understanding everything. “But don’t let him know.”
“The other guy hasn’t met you yet, I’d rather have Steve around, just in case.” Bruce looked down to the ground, Tony nodded in response. Tony looked over as the backdoor opened, Bucky and Natasha walking out and over to the omega.
Bruce ignored the comment as he got the drunk wolf a large glass of water and some ibuprofen for the morning. He glanced back at the omega who had a stupid grin spread across his face, sitting only in his boxers and he sighed again.
That was when Clint noticed something disturbing.
I’m fine, Steve. I have everything taken care of.
to see her.”
Tony grinned and replied, “What, did you forget to introduce yourself to him or something?”
Tony decided. he grabbed the other hearing aid and left the room, leaving Clint to sleep the morning away.
But, every time someone said those stupid words to him as a greeting, he had to excuse himself so he could quietly cry in the bathroom and curse the universe for giving him such generic words.
I assume you two know each other?
“What?” Sam’s soulmate asked, a genuinely confused look on his face.
“Always the voice of reason,” Bucky said fondly as he turned around to give his favorite sister a proper hug.
i picked random people 2 be on our team
What is it?
“I started taking jobs that were way over the line,” Clint replied. “Everyone wants their own personal sniper, you know?” Steve just looked at him in concern and rubbed the back of his neck.
“You coming?” Tony asked out loud. Steve nodded and followed him.
The wings shifted, wrapping around him tighter. “Yeah,” Tony replied. “Go back to sleep. Regrowing feathers must take a lot out of you.”
Just as the cold began to leave his bones, a voice spoke.
Peter plopped himself down next to him on the couch and pressed himself against his father’s side. “Not much. Bruce just said that you might need a hug.”
The guy blushed and looked around before walking up to Clint. “What can I do for you?” Clint asked, leaning over the counter toward him and smiling flirtatiously.
Rhodey pulled Tony into a hug as a response.
“I want to cuddle.”
“Come on,” Tony prodded. “Out with it.”
He hacked the DC police’s servers and installed a program that made the screen of every computer flash a picture of Grumpy Cat each time the letter ‘e’ was typed.
Steve started to get used to it, and by the time Bucky came to visit, he had come to love it.
Not again.
the kind where a rlly great guy calls u hot and u freak out cause u like him and dont know what to say
Oh, thank God.
Charles froze.
That’s awesome.
The next Movie Night, Natasha pushed Tony out of the way and sat in Steve’s lap.
This is too good to be true.
love you too, Buck.
shut up, Sam.
“Yes, Clint, it’s running,” an exasperated female voice replies. “Just go.”
Can you take a picture of her please?
I didn’t.
Clint looked away, shaking his head. “You won’t like it,” he said.
A spike of panic sliced through his sleepy haze and he shot upright.
That… actually makes sense.
“Is it running?” he asks eagerly, blue eyes glowing with excitement.
Tony, why is there a tiny robot on my desk?
“How about if we send in someone we know you can’t hurt?” Steve asked.
I will, Steve. I promise.
Scavengers Away!
Steve was terrified when he moved into Avengers Tower.
“Take me in for what?”
She went over and clambered up into Steve’s arms.
It started as an itch, but grew into a fiery pain that had him almost falling over. Bucky caught his arm and sat him on the ground. Their team crowded around, blocking their Captain from the view of curious bystanders.
“Mr. Stark?” the doctor asked, coming into the room and holding a hand out to Tony.
Tony had always known that he would find at least one of his soulmates. He just hadn’t expected to find one this soon.
we have an entire list 2 do and now we’re stuck inside!
Tony slowly moved closer and said, “Hi, big guy. I’m just going to get you out of these okay?” The dragon grunted but didn’t protest when Tony began snapping chains and straps. Finally, Tony pulled off the hood. The dragon sighed in relief, then turned to look at Tony.
Clint snorted. “Do I ever.”
Don’t worry. It happens to everyone.
“I’m not worried about him hurting me. I’m worried about me getting hurt and Yzzial thinking he’s to blame. That would crush him more than anything.”
But he didn’t like that the other dragon was spending a lot of time with Gaigheiss.
“At least let me get you some blankets,” Sarah said, brow furrowing. “It gets pretty cold in here at night.”
Steve’s words changed the day of his twentieth birthday.  He was overseas, just back from a rescue mission when it happened.
His fingers hit a small rough spot under one of the feathers. He moved the feather aside and saw a tiny scar.
i don’t mind.
The problem was that he would have to leave the tower to get away from them, and he was terrified of going outside.
Clint got arrested again.
I wouldn’t touch that thing with a ten foot pole.
“I won’t, I promise.”
Steve’s were just brown and white with a little blue. They were nothing special.
Rhodey leaned forward to see it, and said, “So you’re the sunrise.”
Pepper found him sitting on the couch in his workshop, gently cleaning his wings while the bots scrubbed the floor to get rid of the blood before it started to stain. She, understandably, freaked out a little.
Why, thank you!
Clint looked uncomfortable. “Well, uh…”
Steve smiled and nodded to the other man, saying,
like in person
Ew. Take your flirting elsewhere.
He picked up one of them and examined it. Frowning, he traced a small crack with his finger.
yeah! you need me!
Tony pulled her back in for another hug. “It’s okay, Mom. I know you miss him,” he said softly.
When Tony was able to get Yzzial to let go long enough for them to get out of the room, Steve came over, presumably to meet the new dragon, and Yzzial almost bit his head off.
Yzzial hopped up into the bed and layed next to him.
Bruce just smiled and sat down next to Tony. “Are you okay?” Tony asked his friend, taking in how ragged he looked.
“Iron Man, can you locate where they’re keeping the dragons?” Steve called out over the comms. Pyziedot flew over, dropping a HYDRA agent in front of him.
how horrible.
Steve shook his head, then realised Sam couldn’t see him and said, “No, I’m okay. Can you send me the information?”
both of you shut it
so i just learned that we dont have enough people
Yzzial grumbled.
“Thanks.”
One day while he was in his workshop, Charles barged in to make him sign a few things.
Pepper touched the back of his neck and slid a piece of paper in front of him. In her looping handwriting, it said, “Your pen tapping is getting louder by the second.”
or until we lose.
Bruce’s eyebrows furrowed. “Should we be up there too?” he asked.
“Dottie,” Steve replied. Gaigheiss toppled off Clint’s shoulder and onto the bed. He rolled into Steve’s lap and nudged his hand. “Hey, bud, you feeling better?” Steve asked the purple dragon, gently scratching behind the ridge of scales on his head.
because you almost gave me a heart attack from your sheer hotness.
Steve just stared down at his wings vacantly and replied, “I’m fine, JARVIS. You don’t need to worry about me.”
i think Tony broke him.
“Can I join this cuddle pile?”
yes. yes i do.
Tony wasn’t offended by being ignored. It wasn’t every day that you met a soulmate, after all.
HERE ARE THE ASSIGNMENTS!!
(“Who’s Bruce?” Steve asked Rhodey quietly.
Maria met Howard’s eyes. Tony would have a hard time ahead of him. Howard knew from experience. The same thing was written across his shoulder.
Bucky snorted, grabbing his hand and shaking it.
He whistled and held up his arm. Redwing sped down and landed lightly. Sam grinned and said, “Good girl.” He gave her a piece of meat before hooking the jess that hung around Redwing’s ankle to his gauntlet.
No can do. Heart condition.
Clint got arrested again.
Clint gasped, offended. “Why would you think I did anything?”
Speaking of which…
“So?”
Steve smiled. “He insisted, and you know how Tony is when he gets his mind on something.”
Clint turned around so he could throw his legs over Sam’s lap and rest his head on Bucky’s shoulder. “They are,” he agreed.
What the hell is this?
Steve wasn’t okay.
Clint and Tony were doing their best to calm him down, but it wasn’t working.
----------
Thanks everyone.
Wait, did I miss something here?
For a second he thought that he was back in his old apartment that he shared with Bucky, but then he remembered that he could never go back there again. The compulsion to pluck his feathers came back, and he had his fingers buried in his wings before he could stop himself.
Again, huh?
Tony went over and sat on the edge of the bed. He gave her a hug, carefully avoiding her bandages. He pulled back slightly and said, “How are you? No one has told me anything. If it wasn’t for Sarah over here, I wouldn’t have gotten to see you at all.”
I let Dum-E name her, okay?
“I want to cuddle,” Tony repeated quietly.
“Sir, I would suggest you pay closer attention. Mr. George appears to be lying about how much his idea would cost,” JARVIS said. Well, actually, he sent the equivalent of a text message to Tony’s glasses.
There was a crack of lightning and a flash of light outside, and the floor vibrated slightly. Yzzial lifted his head and looked at Tony questioningly. “Don’t worry,” Tony assured him. “That’s just Thor.”
She’s terrifying.
Chiepaer had a history of snapping at anyone who came within two feet of Gaigheiss when the other dragon was hurt. It had started when the two had met and Chiepaer hadn’t even let Clint or Bucky come close. It wasn’t hard to see that the two were meant to be together. The fact that it had brought Bucky and Clint together was just an added bonus.
ok everyone!
im out!
The officer sighed and pulled his cuffs out. “Public Indecency. Please turn around and put your hands behind your back.”
“Then we may have a slight problem.”
Tony looked up at him. “Can’t you talk to him for me?”
Not even the Ten Rings.
Tony’s finger shook as he pointed to the marks on Rhodey’s chest and ribs. “I have all of those,” he signed.
“Maybe I should.”
can you get another picture of them?
he told himself.
“Hello, Mrs. Stark,” Sarah said as she walked into Maria’s room. “You’ll never guess who I found out in the waiting room.”
“They aren’t lies if they’re true.”
“Steve, can you hear me?
Sarah started to walk toward the cafeteria, her son trailing behind her, carrying the blanket. “Where are we going?” he asked.
it’s not that good.
He finally agreed to build it out of fear for his wings and because he had a plan brewing in the back of his mind.
“So you’re the one that has to deal with him for the next few months,” Rhodes said. “I apologize in advance. Good luck with him.”
“This Saturday, I think.”
“On my way,” Natasha replied.
Steve went over to the door and put a hand on Pyziedot’s head.  He reached for the door knob, but before he could reach it, a deep voice growled,
They arrived in front of a room, and Sarah said, “Here we are. I’m going to go in and wake him up. Wait here.”
Susie is more than a sentient being, Pep. She’s a child, and now she’s yours.
Chiepaer asked, aghast, as Gaigheiss curled up in his spot.
“I don’t think you know how happy I am to not be the only couple in the group anymore,” Clint said as he leaned farther into Sam.
Are you alright, man?
it’s just so much fun.
Clint walked into the room with a smile on his face. “He’ll be here in ten minutes.”
look at those arms
Oh come on. Not again.
he thought.
The door opened again, and Sam stepped in. “I came as soon as I saw the chat,” he said as he went over to sit on the bed beside Bucky. “You alright man?”
“Of course.”
“Tammi picked that one too!” Tony smiled, picking up the other outfits and packing them away.
“Katniss.”
“Yeah, I am.”
Leading the omega to the spare room, Bucky poked his head out of the kitchen door and looked between the pair with a raised eyebrow. Steve mouthed the word “later” to him, his beta nodding before going back into the kitchen. Once he made sure Tony was okay, he’d explain everything to the pair.
All Steve could think about is when his pack was attacked, and they were trained in combat, this was a community pack -they had no fighters. These were shifters who owned little shops and bakeries. They weren’t trained to fight.
“It’s adorable.” Tony stopped, looking over at them too before letting out a soft sigh. “So this is goodnight, huh?”
Also, if anyone wants to ask me anything or just wants a general chit chat my twitter user is @UFookinLousah in case anyone wanted to know.
“Let me help.” The alpha said as the elevator came to a stop, doors opening on the ground floor. She led Tony out, arm wrapped around him so he could stable himself. “Maybe you should head over to SHIELD medical before you leave? They might be able to squeeze you in today.”
“I-I’m so sorry Brucie… I just wanted to pee and then I went outside for a bit… Then this alpha started touching me and following me. I saw red and had to get him off me. Never again, I didn’t want it to happen again.” The mechanic rambled, his eyes starting to water as he let out a sob.
“The number of times that you talk about them, I bet she does.” Bruce gave the omega a look. “Now get dressed so we can go.”
“I mean, Bruce is amazing. I get along really well with him. Then he introduced me to Clint and Natasha and they’re great too… when they’re not being imitating. Well, Natasha anyway.” The male continued. “But this is their pack and their alpha… and I had to go make a massive tit out of myself.”
“Okay.” Clint’s tail wagged. “I’m sorry for following you.”
“I’ll have the same.” The blonde smiled. Nat nodded although she was a little surprised as Steve didn’t usually drink, especially champagne.
It didn’t take much longer for Sam to return with Tony’s tea. “Here.”
He spotted a band tee thrown over the sofa from earlier and went over to grab it as the drunk wolf let out an excited noise, not too different from a squeal. The delta passed the man his shirt, looking away at the scars and marks on his chest. It wasn’t Bruce’s place to ask, especially with the drunk man being very emotionally unstable, and if Tony wanted to talk, the delta would always lend an ear. Taking off his shoes before shuffling over to the other side of the bed, Bruce grabbed a blanket from the bottom of the bed to put over them both. He laid down beside the wolf who snuggled up close beside him with a yawn.
“We seriously need to invest in a bigger minivan.” Bucky huffed, pushing Clint’s quiver away from him for it to fall back onto his leg. “It’s too cosy in here.”
“The guy who plays Sherlock really looks like you, Tony,” Sam commented.
“Stane reminded me every day. Reminded me that it was my fault, Pep. I was so stupid.”
“They’re beautiful.”
Tony’s tail wagged as he ran over to it and dug a little to make it deeper. Being small had its advantages. Tony managed to wiggle underneath the tree, shaking off the dirt that caught onto his coat when he got free as Steve ran over to him. The alpha sniffed over the omega, rubbing his muzzle against the brown fur to check the omega over.
“I get that a lot, it’s unbelievable.” Tony shook his head, picking up some noodles on a fork. “There’s a doctor in SHIELD Medical that looks like the actor who plays him in the modern-day show too.”
“Yes. Now go kick some ass.” Tony smiled before pecking Steve’s lips.
“I'm so sorry Mr Stark but-” She was cut off by someone else.
Steve began to lick behind Tony’s ears as they started to perk back up again. Both of their tails wagged happily as the alpha groomed the omega. Tony moved so he was lying down, Steve smoothing down the fur on Tony’s back. The alpha continued to groom the small wolf, making the brown fur smooth and shiny. Steve didn’t go near Tony’s underbelly, remembering from last time. He had heard about omega’s being protective over that part of their body, it was the part they would show when they submit to an alpha when they have earned their trust and see them as their alpha. Other submissions would be to keep low to the ground, tail hidden between their legs.
“Yeah,” Tony replied, confused.
He heard a familiar voice that belonged to Bruce from the room across the hall and that’s when last night’s memories started to come back, a lot less hazy. Steve, the alpha he’d been going on about to Bruce, Clint and Natasha, was
A tall bald man stepped in front of the glass. He had extensive scarring on his face and a monocle over his right eye. Tony still didn’t back down, glaring up at the man.
“Yes. Don’t worry. Your sister knows what she’s doing too.”
“How can you drink it straight like that?” Tyler asked, half amused, half stunned.
“I know. But you know he only had good intentions.”
“I said we’re fine.” Steve sighed before heading to a building.
“Wait, what? Reminded you that it’s your fault? How could it have been? You were two years old Tony.”
It had been years since Tony had been in his wolf form for fun because
“Y-yeah. Let’s go.” Tony managed to get out, looking over at Bruce, letting go of the counter.
The female omega gave a sympathetic smile “oh, Tony that’s horrible. But I know how much you hated our pack.” She then became confused as Tony’s question sunk in. “This is SHIELD Tony… Have you not had your meeting yet?” She asked before realisation dawned on Tony.
Steve would normally walk ahead of the lower-ranking wolves, shifter etiquette and all, but he wanted to make sure he could keep an eye on all of them. Clint and Natasha had linked arms as they drunkenly tried to skip together. He’d never seen the pair so ungraceful as long as he’d known them. They’d been drunk before but never this bad. But as far as the alpha was aware, they’d never spent so much time with an omega before and a part of them are known for their love of fun, mischief and partying.
“What do you want me to do?” Tony asked, looking at Steve as the alpha took a few plates from Bucky.
Tony ran out from the lake, Clint and Sam right behind as he headed back towards the rest of the pack. The omega turned back to see how close the deltas were before facing ahead once more, eyes widening at the close proximity of Bucky lying on the grass. Tony jumped over the beta in time and ran up and around Steve. Stopping for a second to look back at Clint and Sam before running again this time heading straight for Thor. The omega was just small enough to slide underneath the lion before running back to mini-beach, bowing down as his tail wagged.
“I-I guess I could show you my lab. Just for a bit.” Bruce smiles a little, swiping his card so the door would unlock for them both.
Tony had also gone into submission, lying close to the ground with his tail between his legs and ears flat. It was second nature to him, upon seeing an alpha in their dominant stance. Steve’s posture automatically softened, licking across Tony’s muzzle, sniffing around his face.
“But I wouldn’t be free.” The omega stepped away from the alpha. “I have Steve now.”
“Dead.”
The omega carefully climbed out of bed, minding not to wake the alpha, and made his way over to the boxes. He had been stripped down to his boxers and was wearing one of Steve’s t-shirts, the alpha’s scent surrounding him making Tony blush even though no one was around or awake to know.
“You won’t even let me make tea in our own house!” The omega could feel the tears rising. Great, now he was going to cry.
Tyler looked to Steve for a confirmation. Steve sighed “sure, if Tony is comfortable with you staying then you can.” Tony grinned as Tyler grabbed a chair and sat down. Clint was still glaring at him from across the table as he took sips from his beer.
“Get your fucking hands off me!” Tony snapped, seeing red as he pushed himself off the large male.
“That’s putting it lightly.” Clint took out a bite from his sandwich. “He needs some action.”
“Well, yeah, of course. I need to make sure you stay safe, so I will be handling all of your upgrades for your gear, not SHIELD. You’ll get the first of everything, you have to have the best.” Tony shrugged.
“Stay here, I’ll get them. What flavour do you want?”
Just as Steve said, Thor got both Sam and Clint’s portion of brownies and the alpha lion had never been so happy. Clint and Sam were both frowning until Bucky had opted to share with Sam and Tony, like he said, gave his own to Clint, taking the archer by surprise.
Steve shifted into his wolf form after stripping down and putting his clothes into the chest. The alpha rubbed against Tony’s legs before going over to the others. Whist everyone was distracted, Tony stripped down and put his clothes in the chest and shifted.
“No.”
Thank you for all your reads, kudos and comments! ❤
“Nothing, he’s just being very overprotective. Now I want a hug please.”
“Access denied.”
“You made this?” Steve asked.
“Yeah let’s go.”
“It’s okay, Mr Stark.” Tony doesn’t remember apologising but accepted it anyway. “Miss Potts, would you mind taking our guest up to Agent Coulson’s office? It will give you time to catch up.” The human smiled at the pair.
As soon as the two wolves made it to a bar, Tony had walked straight up to order his drinks, remembering Bruce telling him it was 2 for 1 on any alcoholic drinks. The omega ordered two scotch on the rocks for himself before turning to the delta with a raised eyebrow.
“No, and you damn well know what.”
Tony laughed, shaking his head. “You guys are weird.”
“JARVIS is here now?” Rhodey asked, surprised as he took off his jacket.
He was pregnant. Of course, he was pregnant.
“Just some personal projects. I finished the updated communicators for SHIELD earlier. Agent Carter came to collect them actually.” Tony said, smiling as he made his way over to his workbench.
“I’m not sure if I can do that.” The receptionist gave a small smile.
“I just like being close to you. I like having you around just so I know you’re okay. That you’re safe and I can protect you.” The blonde pulled Tony closer to his chest, holding him there. “I was scared when I couldn’t find you.”
“I-I’m coming, Buck.” The blonde let out a sigh and managed to tear his gaze from the smaller wolf to look back at his beta.
“Oh no, we’ve got this one.” Rhodey stepped up from the table and walked away with the waitress.
“Do you want me to see if I can get some help? Someone who could break down the door?” Bruce offered.
“I’ve done worse.” Tony shrugged, to which Steve only growled. He really was angry.
“You’ve been spending time with a friend. He’s not going to hate you. If anything, he’ll blame me for dragging you out again.”
“Huh, I’m sure it was near here.” Clint huffed, looking up and down the street.
I hope everyone is well and coping fine with all what's going on. I know it's hard.
The omega let his eyes close as he snuggled into the alpha’s chest, just happy to be around him. Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony, burring his face into the dark hair. Tony kept telling himself that it was good to talk to Steve about these things, that his therapist would be impressed with him. Tony let out another sigh before speaking up again, eyes opening and staring at Steve’s chest.
“I wasn’t always big and strong you know.”
Tyler leaned forward a little before reaching his hand out, wiping away a tear from Tony’s cheek. He gave a shy smile a bit his lip. The omega’s jaw dropped a little, taken aback from the small yet intimate action. Tyler had started to lean in, eyes fluttering shut as if to kiss the omega, Tony leaning back in response. He wasn’t expecting that. He definitely wasn’t expecting the alpha to be pinned down on the bar by another alpha, the latter getting out a growl as he spoke to Tyler.
“I missed you too.”
“I missed you too, Katniss.” A pause. “Hey, you’re blonde.”
“I am a delight.”
“I’m sitting next to Anthony next!” Thor grinned.
“Do you have a boyfriend then?” Wanda smiled up at him.
“JARVIS… What’s the time?” Tony’s glasses lit up on command.
“Tony?” Steve called, guiding Peter around to the doors of the quinjet.
“Thank you. Can you give me another number?” Pepper smiled, happy that Tony was at least going to think about it. Progress was progress.
Tony was exhausted, his pack had pushed his limits today, which was very clear that they did it on purpose now. If Tony’s sleep schedule hadn’t been so fucked up he wouldn’t have realised that he had been left until morning… that is if he had survived the night. A sleeping wolf was much easier to kill. He continued, his muscles aching as he walked, his bag weighing down on his back. He was glad Stane and the pack hadn’t taken it, he had some valuables he never left behind with him, along with spare clothes and other necessities. He continued to curse at himself in his head at all the gym classes he skipped in school and the lack of training he continued to have as an adult. Plus, over thirty years of a lot of cheeseburgers and a lack of physical exercise was finally taking its toll.
“I said I would.” Steve insisted.
“Not anymore.”
“Oh, no thanks. I have plans.”
Tony shook his head. “No, I’m pretty sure there were some double-dealings too. Some of these weapons were too much, torture devices even.” The omega closed his eyes, trying to forget about seeing the devices in the workshops in Stark Industries. Seeing the plans for them lying around the house. How some of the lower workers, mostly young interns, would suddenly take sick days or be limping. Tony was sure there was some lab-rat testing going on and he hated it. He could have easily messed with them, destroyed them. But they all would have known it was him and then he would have been in deep trouble. He regretted not doing anything.
“You went inside my lab?” Bruce asked, ignoring the archer’s dramatic self.
“I hope so.” Steve let out a sigh, taking out his phone.
“That late?”
Except when he was caught by a feline shapeshifter.
“What?” Steve turned to Tony.
“You okay?” The redhead asked, having smelt Tony’s nervousness, turning away from the human she was talking to.
“Listen here, I may be an omega, but I’m not scared of you.” The omega took notice of Bruce, before keeping his eyes fixed on the alpha male. “I could fucking take you. Bruce, I could take him.”
Tony turned to where the alpha was pointing. “Yep.” Steve’s shield was leaning against another counter across the room. Along with a few other pieces he had for the pack, arrows for Clint, stingers for Natasha, a prototype for Bucky’s arm.
“These are my bots, TIA, DIEGO, BRIE, WIM and Steve Jr.”
“You’re impossible, you know that?” There wasn’t a way the delta could get out of this without having a whining Tony as a result. So, it was best that he just went with it.
“Shit!” Turning around to face the slightly amused blonde he had left stranded in the hallway. “Oops. I got a bit distracted.”
“It’s Bucky.” Steve shrugged again before answering. “Hello.”
Tony went over to his couch and grabbed his laptop, deciding to watch a few episodes of Star Trek while he drank his coffee. It was still way too early for him to go to sleep, most of the time it would be anywhere between 3-6am. After watching three episodes Tony glanced at the clock, groaning at the fact it wasn’t even 1 am yet. The omega shut his laptop before grabbing his key card and folder and left the room. He took the elevator down to the first floor and walked out of the door, having to use his card for both. Between 11 pm and 6 am the building was in lockdown, although there were security and a few workers around, it was still a safety protocol.
Now Coulson would find out, how horrible he was. Good for nothing but a punching bag. He would be accused of only wanting attention, while he actually wanted the opposite, to be left alone.
Anytime Steve was out working, Bucky would head downstairs and hang around while Tony worked. In the beginning it was purely for the redesign of his arm, but once he had a shiny Stark Industries arm, he still stayed.
Phil looked thoroughly confused. "Of course you can, I'll pop it in the trunk in a second. Let me just help you out first." And as Coulson moved forward to help Loki out of the chair, the raven haired boy looked confused this time.
Tony grins smugly and winks. "As a matter of fact I have dinner planned with this amazingly hot and funny guy, you might know him, he really likes the whole red, white, and blue theme."
So skinny, obviously hungry, what happened to the kid to make him so scared of accepting food?
(--o--)
I've also created a tumblr page where I will post old fics, take requests, and give hints for new works. Go drop by! @awesomegoddessoffanfics
Tony rolled his eyes but did vaguely remember hearing something like that. He made his way to the common floor and got out of the elevator just as he heard the others talk about Peter. "Hey guys, I know my kid is amazing, what were you talking about?" He asks while dropping down on the couch and stealing the popcorn from Clint.
It took him a moment to realise the sounds he heard were soft pants and muffled sobs. Someone else was hiding here distressed. But it didn't sound like Clint. Besides, the archer would probably be in the range to calm down.
Tony bursts out laughing and rests his head on Steve's shoulder.
Stupid right? Right.
"This isn't working. Your contract is ending in a month and SI won't be extending it." Tony went straight to the point, he wouldn't be able to extend this any more than necessary.
He dropped it without a word and walked to the kitchen. After turning the oven off, Tony turned and headed back down to the workshop.
My room is in the basement, so I don't have a window. I don't really like sleeping in the basement, it's always cold and damp. And the light switch is upstairs so I cannot control the light myself. That sucks when I am being locked up when grounded.
Those sad brown eyes turned back to the camera and Steve winced slightly at how dull they appeared.
is a massive online success after all.
Pepper finally looked at him and smiled, the moisture in her eyes betrayer the pain she felt. "You may join me, I'm visiting Thor to make sure there is no cure we can try."
Steve needed a moment to cool off.
Clint and Natasha were first to arrive, always early for whatever invitation. Of course they had heard about Loki already, they knew everything that was going on in that school.
Hehehe
Damn he was pitiful.
The brunette blinks a few times and groans. "Coffee first. Talk later." He mutters before dragging himself out of bed and away from Steve's warm arms. Tony instantly regrets it when his head pounds even worse while a shiver runs through him. Steve stays silent while following Tony out of bed, offering the groggy engineer a sweater without a word.
Odin is angry. Thor and mother think it is because of the low grades, but I know it's because I have one grade higher than Thor's.
Surprisingly, the psychologist that Tony spoke to now was actually a success. The elder woman didn't take any bullshit which Tony respected.
"There is someone who can help. He is still helping me and my friends, he can never tell anyone anything without your permission. He is safe." Bruce said softly. "I can introduce you right now if you want?" He suggested as he rested his hand on Loki's shoulder once more.
Both simply smiled at Loki and didn't pressure him for anything more.
For a moment Tony can't talk anymore, but Bucky's strong arms around him gave him the courage to keep going.
The Black Widow almost missed the whispered words but nodded and smiled softly. "Goodnight Anthony."
He didn't know what was going on. No one was reacting the way they should. Not at all.
Clint jumped up and shouted
The billionaire genius no one has seen in years.
Wanda didn't join them until a month later, when she shyly showed up and was lead to her apartment without any issue.
The name was drawn out as Tony grinned at the screen and giggled in a very un Tony like manner.
It was rather early on in the day, and normally Phil wouldn't be home for many hours. But today, tomorrow, and probably the whole weekend, would be focussed on making Loki feel a little safer.
Then the parents both passed away, and the girl started to resemble him more. She did the chores, cooked the meals, did all the work. But she did it voluntarily. She was not punished for disobeying, not beaten for being less than perfect. She did it because she was kind.
And now...
But here it is at last
Natasha glared at Clint when he wanted to grab the last few slices and spoke up. "Loki only had one slice. So before you shove your face full, you might want to let him have a chance for dinner first." The redhead said coldly before sliding the last pizza to Loki with a small smile.
Jarvis remained still until a clipped "done, sir" was heard a few minutes later.
Thor just huffed. "Probably because Loki did something again. Why is he in a wheelchair? Did he get in a fight?" The sneer that layered the words shocked everyone present, everyone except Loki.
you're not your father." The supersoldier said seriously and a little pained, reaching out to take Tony's hand. "Peter
"Jarvis warned you Tony, now act like the adult you are and get over here."
"Of course Sir." The student quickly pushed his notebooks back in his bag and sat up perfectly straight despite the welts on his back aching.
The essay Phil asked Loki to write, a day in the life of Loki Laufeyson
The student was easily helped into a chair, Phil made him take his meds again, and everyone dug in.
At the genius his nod, Bucky whimpers. "But why? Why would he do such a thing? I don't understand."
All robots were now focused on shooting at him, and it was getting harder and harder to avoid all those lasers coming his way. He got hit a few times to block anyone innocent from getting hit, but nothing horrible just yet.
Clint frowns and rolls his eyes. "Like we said, it's a prank Cap. Don't worry, Tony's ego just got a little bruised. He'll get over it."
"-can't believe you're hanging out with Bucky instead of me."
Silence fell heavy within the room, but Natasha seemed determined. "We are going to fix this. Now, we already tried asking Friday, but she's been silenced. How will we find out for sure what's going on?" She asks out loud while thinking of an answer to her own question.
He steps out on the balcony and looks around the city, takes a deep breath...
A dull thud was heard when Thor sat his hammer down on the coffee table, denting the expensive wood and making Tony cringe a little. Pepper was definitely going to yell at him for that.
Another few days later there were questions about Clint's arrows.
Coulson smiled a little as he listened to the question. There were many things he couldn't answer, but that he could do.
Of course it had been a factor, but it wasn't the main trigger. It wasn't what made Tony toss the entire content of his bar through the drain. Oh no, that had been something much more life changing.
Most of the time he had to walk. Which is why Odin often aimed for his legs.
"Of course, you're right." The blond answered before taking the turkey out of the oven and carrying it to the table that Thor was already setting.
Loki asked for his notebook just after lunch, he wanted to finish what he had started that morning, but forgot to bring it downstairs.
Tony swallowed thickly and shook his head. "Don't worry about it J. He will be happy to spend even more time with his soulmate."
." Steve's voice was soon followed by the man himself. Big muscled blond anger.
It took a full year for the Avengers to come together at last.
Four teenagers were sitting on the edge of the school's roof. Their legs dangling over the edge while chatting with each other and watching the other students down on the ground.
It took surprisingly long before Phil gave the order to pull Bucky out of that cell. James was pretty sure he could have done it sooner. But then again, the agent didn't exactly appear sorry for Steve.
(--o--)
Before he left he threw a hand of crumbs on the floor. My dinner. I am too hungry to care. So I ate from the floor like a dog.
Steve was frustrated as well. He didn't want to lose Tony. "How would anyone ever be able to know who their true love is? If 'normal' love doesn't count?"
Now look at that, Tony loved both super soldiers, and they loved each other. They deserved to be happy together. To go on dates and cuddle close on movie nights and share food and... and be happy. Without having to worry about some clingy ex.
Ah... Thor again with how his brother always lied. Apparently no one should believe anything the young student said.
Loki's first instinct was one of terror, again. He couldn't get an academic scholarship! Odin would break him if he somehow seemed better than Thor! But then it slowly dawned upon the young man that, if he lived somewhere else, Odin could no longer harm him.
And he had an asshole father. Although not as bad as his friends by far, that's what he always said. His father had left when Steve was just a kid. Now his mother had to work two jobs to pay the bills, and Steve made sure to help wherever he could. His friends help him as much as they can. Or, as much as Steve will accept. He doesn't want to become a charity case.
"Steve? Where are you going?"
A week later everyone had tried to break in. Using the shield, Thor's hammer, and even the Hulk; nothing broke through. Tony had really reinforced his new lab.
Making sure his footsteps were audible, he walked over and sat down beside the black haired boy. "Hello." He said softly, after a moment of tense silence.
Steve huffed as he pushed the engineer into the bed. "Even if you would, he wouldn't even look twice at you. I mean, look at you, pathetic."
For the first time in weeks, he slept without dreaming.
The dark haired youngster trailed his shaking fingers along the soft sheets and swallowed thickly. He barely managed an audible thank you, but Phil understood and wished him goodnight.
He swallowed thickly and looked at the new element he discovered. It would be the last big achievement of his life. He'd be gone soon and hopefully this would be one good thing he could leave behind.
"He has been trying to push away the people that care for him. Yes." Pepper added, straight to the point to avoid bursting into tears.
As they should.
He totally wasn't working himself to the bone trying to create a perfect Christmas this year so maybe Steve would want to celebrate it together again sometime.
He has a team to lean on after all.
Peter loved playing with the robots, loved helping his dad out and learning about mechanical stuff. The only thing he loved more were bugs. Peter really loved bugs. Life was pretty good for the little kid.
It would make sense that once Peter grew up and found out what Tony had done before he had been born, he would end up hating his dad. But Tony just wanted what was best for Peter. He thought it was what the kid wanted. Shit he was fucking up so badly.
The engineer seemed shy and easily frightened. He flinched more often than ever, and the two assassins were worried for their friend.
It was amazing.
The nervous and terrified student looked up briefly to glance at Coulson before he nodded and kept his eyes firmly down once more. He walked inside and sat down on the examination table. A last nervous glance was sent Coulson's way as the door was closed and Pepper got started.
That night, he dreamt of being chased through the woods, growls echoing behind him, getting closer and closer. When he finally turned around the look, there was just a man. A gorgeous man with dark brown eyes.
The next week with a request for his shield.
The two guys collapsed and Loki fell backwards. He closed his eyes and bit back a scream when he landed on the agitated welts staining his back. Clint helped him up while apologising and gathered the essay Loki had dropped. He read the heading and nodded. "The writing of an essay. It does help huh?" Clint asked but didn't make a move to give the papers back.
Sleeping was a whole different thing.
Steve blinked the tears from his eyes and looked up into the face of the man of his dreams. Literally.
Loki curled up even tenser, his breathing sounding heavy and distressed. "P-Please... Do-Don't... I... I don't ha-have any m-money." He stuttered barely audible.
As Clint told the others what he heard, Thor could be heard walking up the stairs noisily. It was already making Clint and Bruce nervous.
Loki didn't quite understand the movie at first. A girl in a happy family, she reminded him of Thor a bit. Naïve and focused on having courage. The student almost huffed, being kind got you no where in the world.
Pepper pushed him forward. "Please." She whispered behind him. "We have nothing to lose. Even if there's the smallest chance... Please..."
On that backseat, curled up between the two loves of his life, Tony realised...
Such a shame he was a useless shit who just got sent away.
Coulson smiled softly and put the bags of Indian food on the dinner table. "How about I put the pasta salad you made in the fridge, and we'll eat that for lunch tomorrow with some bread. It's not really enough to feed us both for dinner but it looks delicious."
The black haired student silently accepted the books and tried to whisper a soft thank you, only to be waved away by Bruce's soft smile and assurance that no thanks were necessary.
Most people thought it was the kidnapping that changed Tony. That made him swear off weapons and focus on clean energy. That changed him from the ever drunk playboy to something resembling a responsible adult.
He had been hiding with some African king while Steve looked for him, and as soon as his mind was healed, he had returned to the states.
There was only one solution... Phil.
(See the end of the chapter for
There weren't many times Tony was wrong.
Bruce looked surprised for only a moment, that actually made a shockingly amount of sense. "That's not an excuse. He can't do this Loki." Adopted or not, everyone deserved a safe home. Bruce had learnt that now.
away, but it's close.
The whole fic might turn out a little longer than anticipated.
"We need to talk." Tony spits out while glaring at the perfect, blue eyed man before him.
As the new assistant left her office, miss Potts sat down and smiled. "Oh you'll do nicely." She muttered satisfied.
"Not now Tony, just... Just leave me alone alright?"
Pepper was pacing the floor, tense and stressed. The clicking of her heels echoed through Steve's skull as the world seemed to spin around him.
I saw him driving past, and my ankles hurt, so I waved. Maybe he wouldn't mind too badly to give me a ride as usual. But he drove past. Maybe he just hasn't seen me.
Natasha's eyes widen and she gets to her feet as well. "He didn't." She whispers shocked.
Maybe following all the advice Pepper once gave him would be a good start. He'd follow Steve's advice, but for some reason Steve never told him how to change. Which was weird since it was basically all Tony ever talked about with Pepper.
Loki just nodded, keeping quiet as he listened to the older man speak. It was confusing not to know what was expected of him, but at least he would not have to sleep on the streets for now.
What was possibly even more surprising was how quickly Steve got used to seeing his hairy boss. Sure, it was odd to help out Mister Stark with things because his claw-like hands couldn't quite manage to grab onto a small screw, but not as odd as the blond had expected.
Tony freaking Stark.
I- I talked to him about it. He told me that he could leave if I wanted him. So I begged him to stay. Working and eating at regular hours didn't seem too bad.
Damn.
He still felt scared though. "I... I can't..." He whispered shocked, scared, terrified. "Where would I live?"
But for now, he would have a roof above his head. Loki was still in the wheelchair, not being allowed to walk until the swelling of his ankles went away. And the only things he had were the supplies in his schoolbag and locker.
On top of that, Tony worked twice as hard to get all his work done so he could take all the time between Christmas and New Year's off. He missed spending as much time with Steve and his team, but this Christmas had to be special. Flawless even.
They had their demons to fight.
It was difficult answering for the kid. He had no idea. Was it justified? It seemed like it. Although Thor often got home too late from parties, and he was never hit. While, when Loki got home ten minutes too late, out of breath because he had ran all the way, he was sent to his room without dinner after receiving a few slaps.
And it was all Tony's fault.
I might write some one-shots in this universe to requests.
After their blissful honeymoon phase where they made the other Avengers sick with their constant making out everywhere, small arguments happened. It was never anything serious or big. Just arguing briefly over socks left on the floor or snoring at night.
A little while later Bruce knocked on Phil's office door. And only a second later a calm voice could be heard. "The door is open, come in."
"So your new job is classified... blink twice if you're in danger." The brunet whispered a little mockingly.
Clint clears his throat and softly answers. "Perhaps it's time one of us just breaks their privacy and takes a look into that penthouse."
For a brief agonising moment he just felt so... Alone.
"So..." Tony begins not feeling as awkward as he probably should. "You ehm, you're quite the fan?"
Also, I finished writing it, so as you can see the amount of chapters is now known. Three more after this one! :D
Luckily it wasn't hard to find and after a brief talk, which had Steve trembling in his seat, he was officially hired as someone's P.A.
Steve sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. "Peter asked me something while I was watching him yesterday."
With a small encouraging smile towards Loki, Bruce opened the door and walked in. The younger student stalled slightly as he slowly closed the door behind him, before carefully glancing up at the suited man behind the desk. His posture was still the same as always, curled in on himself, clutching his bag tight, and keeping his eyes as far down as possible behind his sunglasses.
Loki quickly shook his head. "I don't need your help." He whispered softly and raised his head just a little to show red puffy eyes and a pale face. What shocked Bruce most however, was the large bruise on his right eye.
Tony reached him just in time to catch him before he hit the pavement and immediately flew towards the tower.
Tell me what you think! :)
"What?" Steve looked confused above all else. "I don't understand? I thought things were going great?"
Bucky tensed while Tony muttered a quick mute, but too late.
At least he could always count on Jarvis to catch him if he fell. The AI he had built himself. Yeah... That was probably it. He was number one for JARVIS because he had programmed him.
Masks he dropped around them most of the time, showing them he trusts them.
That being said, it was only a matter of time before something went wrong during the hour long commute and he got to work late. And indeed, when the weather turned shit, his train was delayed more often than not until eventually he missed his transfer and ended up running through the halls of the tower with his coffee and his hair a complete mess.
And so Phil quickly said goodbye to Bruce and Tony, promised to get some beers for the next day, and pushed Loki out of the school and towards his car.
They deserved each other. And Tony?
They dated and spent lazy Sundays curled up on the couch together.
Steve nods slowly and gets a weird thoughtful look on his face before blushing which surprises the hell out of Tony.
Let me know!
"Don't you Buck me. I can't believe I was friends with you, you
"I brought you a stool so you did not have to stand and wouldn't need my help. Did you walk to the shower?"
The young man rolled his wheelchair towards the kitchen and carefully looked around for something that could be made. There wasn't much food around. But Loki had always been good at improvising.
"Tony?"
The second useful camera showed Tony waking up, a lot sooner than the two soldiers had expected. Tony woke up and appeared positively devastated as he rolled over to Steve's empty side of the bed. He asked Jarvis for Steve's location with a voice that could break any heart. Then he asked for the feed which cut in on a horrible timing. Even worse was the moment where Tony obviously couldn't bare it anymore and cut it off before hearing the explanation. A minute later Tony was gone.
"I promise. I know I can say that it will never happen, but that won't help you. Time will tell that I'm in this for the long run. And so for now, I promise I will tell you." Steve answered dutifully.
(--o--)
." He repeated half slurred with sleep. It was hard to keep his eyes open but he had to explain. "Go to... to Bucky... You love him. He's your... number one." His eyes were closed now, his throat thick with emotion as he drifted off. "I love you both so much... Please... Go... Be... happy..."
Barnes was amazing. He was charming and funny, handsome and a surprisingly good baker. So of course Tony fell for the other soldier as well.
Clint looked up in shock and took Loki's hand. "We're going to Coulson, right now. And you're going to give him the entire essay. And he is going to help you." The blond said as he lead Loki towards Coulson's office.
Over all, Tony had no reason to complain.
"Mute." Tony grumbled as he stumbled to his feet and towards the suit. He couldn't leave the others to themselves just because he was suffering from some heartbreak.
Tony was
"Loki, wait up." Dammit.
Natasha and Clint were the first to arrive at the tower. Steve was off to a short mission, and Tony came to welcome them.
Without a word he drags me off the bed and he makes me take my shirt off. I don't need an explanation for this. I was nine minutes late, that equals to nine straps with the belt.
"Oh baby... but why not? We would have been there for you. I would have... you wouldn't have had to be alone."
After swallowing thickly and gathering his resolve he gently pulled his hands back and folded them in his lap. "You should go." Tony whispered softly, unable to look either man in the eye. This was hard enough as it was. Seeing the relief on their faces at not having to be bothered to stay would only make it impossible.
"Of course mi- Tony. Would you like something to drink while we do?"
Everyone did eventually.
Bruce is quickly growing bored with the repetition of the same discussion they've been having for a week now. "Look Tony, talk to the guy. I don't care how, just
Tony's eyes widened and he got up and already headed to the elevators. "Nooo, Bruce is science, not engineering. He'd totally break it and-" He interrupted himself, turned around to face Steve, and glared at the taller man. "Don't think I don't know what you're doing."
My arms are grabbed and my rapport card is shoved in my hands. While I'm forced to look at the horribly low numbers before me, father pulls out a knife from his shaving blade, and cuts a few long but shallow lines along my wrists. It hurts so much. And I can't help a few whimpers and tears from escaping.
Thor's laughing at how low they are. It makes me feel empty. I know how low they are, I don't have a choice.
"The worst were the showers. After Afghanistan... I showered as quick as possible. Water hitting my face is just... not- not good. He'd make me stand under the cold shower for ages. Kick me out when I would get a panic attack."
The nearest screen lit up to show Tony's face. Everyone present had a few seconds to take in the exhausted appearance and the obviously drunken expression of their teammate before the video started.
Just two days ago he was being beaten with a belt, or kicked down some stairs just to break bones.
No wonder Tony had given up. Finding a true love's kiss? At least he didn't have to kiss a frog... Steve's pathetic crush briefly flared up high, shouting to go kiss Tony, but Steve immediately pushed it down. It would be stupid, not to mention cruel, to try and claim he was anyone's true love. He was small and sickly, needing a dozen pills with each meal just to live a normal life. The only people who loved him were his friends.
It didn't make any sense, but they were probably just waiting for Clint to get his word in first.
He wasn't okay, far from it, but be would be. Eventually.
He was apologising? That wasn't how things went... So Loki just blankly nodded, more in shock that in forgiveness.
"Somewhere safe."
He should have stopped drinking.
..." Tony chocked on his words and pushed back the tears treathening to spill, clearing his throat a little and staring down at his hands. "I
He was watching video footage of Clint falling. As that finished it switched to images of Ultron wrecking havoc.
This was probably revenge. Or something.
Mother hangs Thor's grades on the fridge as if he is a child. I am sent to my room without dinner. Mother briefly argues because I didn't get dinner last night either, but father promises to bring me something later tonight.
They immediately rushed in, Steve was unsure about following, but Pepper dragged him along. Not even a minute later they were back at the penthouse and standing in Tony's room.
That's when Bucky snapped. He promised Tony he wouldn't kill Steve. He promised Coulson he wouldn't punch him.
The two moved past their initial dislike for each other pretty quickly. Mostly because Tony really wanted Steve to like him, and Steve realised Tony wasn't what the media portrayed him as.
He wraps his hand around the handle and for a moment that hope glows bright within him. Another deep breath, and he tugs.
Peter frowned a little, which was adorable but also a little worrying. "Misses Jackie says I can read in the next group." The kid muttered while breaking pieces off his bread.
The soldier had broken five punchings bags in the last hour. Five bags designed by Tony to not break.
"I do not know. But father said-"
The Avengers stare at each other in shock, before being interrupted by Natasha slapping Clint on the back of the head. "Ty durak?" She snapped in Russian. "Posmotrit, chto ty nadelal."
Please leave a comment if you enjoyed this :)
Thor was running after him, quickly catching up. Making sure to keep his eyes down Loki turned to Thor. "I'm sorry." He whispered in advance, he probably did something bad again.
"A misunderstanding!!" Bucky yelled roughly. "A fucking
How retarded was that anyway? What idiot let a six year old in a
(--o--)
It was a long shot but better than watching the man he loved break down while the other had vanishes into nothing. Steve paused beating the bag for a moment and nodded briskly. At least they could try.
There was a ham in the oven, freshly baked cookies ready to be decorated. Tony had followed every cliché tradition so their Christmas could be perfect.
Epilogue
He's right.
IronFan4Ever
Tony was too shocked to respond while Bucky spoke. It didn't make sense at all. The three of them? Tony was still a genius and could quickly process new information. Only the conclusion was too strange.
Tony woke up from an alcohol induced nap to the alarms blasting and Jarvis projecting information on the wall.
16:30 - going home
The engineer also agreed that yes, Peter really should skip a class because he was insanely clever. Eventually the kid ended up going to another school where there was a class for genius kids. He quickly became best friends with a smart little girl called Gwen and a shy boy named Victor. Natasha just made bets with everyone to see when Steve would finally take Tony out for a date. Her money was on next week.
So did Steve. No matter what Tony might be feeling. No matter how hard his stupid instincts might be pushing for him to reach out and hold the PA close forever, the genius pushed it down. It's why he scared Steve off on bad days. So no one would ever realise the full truth about his curse.
Steve was still alive and perfect and... And Steve became Tony's number one. Steve. Perfect kind sweet caring handsome amazing Steve.
The soldier made a soft sad sound and pulled Tony close once more. "No, Tony, baby, he was so wrong. We didn't know. Please believe us. We didn't know. All we saw was that you stopped drinking, stopped endangering yourself. And we were happy, because we thought you were safe."
On the other side of the room, at Coulson's right, was the principal. It was a man that terrified Loki at the same time as making him feel safe. The dark skinned, in leather clad, serious looking male, kept his one eye firmly set on the door. Nicolas Fury was a force to be reconned with.
It was very very silent once Tony stopped talking until suddenly a warm arm wrapped around his shoulders and pulled him close. "Oh god Tony... Who did this to you?" Steve whispered while pulling Tony almost on his lap, sketchbook long forgotten.
So I will probably post chapter three soon to cover that up.
He couldn't turn into Howard.
Loki's thoughts were broken by a soft knock on the door. "Loki? Breakfast is almost ready. Are you awake?" Phil asked gently through a closed door.
"Just like
Even the Avengers who were just moving in had just found out.
Loki carefully shook his head. "No, I'm a-adopted. We live in the same house, but we're not b-brothers." The student explained softly. He sounded defeated again, like in the library, empty and tired.
They kissed. And Tony smiled.
Her best friend was dying and there was no cure. Thor had returned and said something about matters of the heart, but she didn't understand.
Phil knew he had to be very careful with what he said now, he didn't want to scare Loki off after all. "Loki, there is something I should have told you before, but unless I directly ask you to do something, you do not have to cook or clean. Or do any chores for that matter. I should have said so before leaving, and I apologise for the misunderstanding." Coulson spoke calm but clear, watching the fear morph into shame and change into confusion on the student's face.
Filled with dread and craving a drink, Tony landed in Malibu. He stepped out of the suit and headed straight to the kitchen for coffee. After gulping down two mugs he grabbed a bottle of scotch and made his way down to his workshop. He had slept a few hours and there was no one to stop him from working anymore.
Tony shook his head, a few stray tears escaping. "I... no... so many people died Steve... I can't-"
It took them more than a year, but it was worth the wait. Of course, the prank that happened hasn't caused Tony's issues, it had only brought them to light.
Barton nodded sharply and Potts huffed before motioning for Natasha and Steve to follow her. Once in the elevator she spoke up again. "Tony trust you two the most. I have a code to open the workshop, which will work. But I need you two to go in and talk to him. Me telling him his team cares isn't doing to work. That's something you guys should do."
A shrink first. That wasn't too difficult, he just called one of the many many cards Pep ever gave him and set an appointment.
The look Pepper threw Clint was absolutely
Though, when he put it back together, instead of making annoying beeping noises, there was a pleasant soft bell indicating his heartbeat.
Natasha nods at Tony's carefully questioning glance, and the engineer looks back at Bucky with wide eyes. "Really?"
Today is rapport day. The list of grades is being handed to us by our study coaches. I don't like rapport day. I hate it.
Tony was currently fidgeting with the flowers he bought Steve, waiting for the blond to arrive at the restaurant they had their first date at. It was cheesy, but exactly how Tony wanted to celebrate their year anniversary.
Tony swallowed down some bile and buried his face in his knees. "Friday? P-Post my letter of re-resignation..."
Bucky was watching old movies in the livingroom while Clint, well, Clint was hiding in the vents in the penthouse.
Loki had only met the man twice. Once at his first day at school, where Fury had welcomed him personally as son of the great Odin Borson. The second time was after the first exam week, when he had a firm talk with Loki about his grades. He offered tutoring, which Loki declined.
Yet another battle. A mere week later.
Bye bye Stark.
Three weeks ago Pepper walked in asking about the annual Christmas gala that Stark Industries would host. Three weeks. Tony had almost forgotten about Christmas. So he set to work.
Steve ended up with several broken bones in his face.
The family pet. He said.
A small figure was curled up in a corner, shivering slightly and obviously trying to keep silent. Bruce recognised the guy immediately, Loki. Was this what Thor's words had done to the kid?
He tried to open his eyes but quickly closed them with a small groan, the bright light above him hurt his head even more. Damn.
This time Steve looks shocked and surprised. "What? No, of course not! I've- I was just shocked at finding out that... Well, that you're Iron Man, that's all."
The soldier showed up in Tony's workshop one morning with questions about the tower's security.
It was almost amusing how confused Tony sounded at the idea of someone using the train to get to work. So obviously Steve smiled a little before answering, "I don't own a car, and I wouldn't be able to park anywhere close anyway. Besides, the fastest way to get here during rush hour is by train."
Wait. What?
Rhodey was odd. At times it seemed he had Tony at one. But he knew that couldn't be true. Tony was never at one. Work and Tech and Family probably outranked him. And as soon as Rhodes met a girl Tony would lower a spot. But that was alright.
That's when Jarvis spoke up. "Sir's vitals are getting worse. It appears his heart is giving in." The AI sounded uncharacteristically panicked and already opened the elevator doors for the three present people.
Steve made a sound that was truly intensely sad.
Steve grins relieved and pulls Tony closer for another soft kiss. "Haven't you heard? I'm a much bigger fan of red and gold."
been avoiding you..." The captain says awkwardly.
"Aye, I miss my Iron Shield brother! But he finds great value in his work. Perhaps that is where he is the happiest!" Thor exclaimed before heading to the livingroom carrying a large stack of plates and cutlery.
Steve would almost always be there, just sitting in the corner drawing, jumping in on their conversations at times and watching Peter when Tony had to focus.
The AFA shared a look and made a silent promise. They would help their schoolmate. Help him heal, no matter how long it took. He was one of them after all.
Steve brushed some hair out of Tony's eyes and nodded. "I'm sorry Tony. I'm so darn sorry. I should have realised-"
Including sitting in the front seat.
The boy left her office in a wheelchair with a folder of pictures and notes, and at least five bottles of medication. From antibiotics for his back, to painkillers for his ankles, to different vitamin pills. Until his blood work would be done, miss Potts had simply guessed what he would be missing, and given him the stuff that wouldn't harm anyone.
“You’re definitely not, Tony.”
“Where are you Steve?”
“Don’t move.” A voice said from behind, pressing a gun up to Clint’s head, making him freeze. “If you take a step closer, I will shoot him.”
“Okay.”
Tony began to tidy up, the best he could anyway, the bots helping by picking up tools and putting them away. The omega turned when there was a knock at the door, going over to it and opening it to Rhodey.
“Just passing through to get to the dining hall. Come on Loki, Banner.” Thor ushered the other two inside the kitchen. “Don’t mind us, go back to passionate lovemaking.”
“They’re behaving. Well better than normal.” Tony took Steve’s hand. “Come on, let’s go.”
He shut the door before with his foot before toeing off his shoes and taking off his shirt and joggers, leaving him in his boxers. He moved his and Tony’s shoes away from the bed and neatly folded their clothes on the chest of draws. Tony was watching the alpha the whole time but had shuffled up onto the bed and slipped inside by the time Steve was finished and grinned up at him once the alpha made his way over. The brunette patted the spot next to him, giggling softly when the blonde climbed into the bed.
The alpha sped up a little before jumping over a large tree that had fallen over. There has been a huge storm a few nights back, it raged most of the night, which would have been the cause of the tree to fall. The trunk was huge, the width twice the height of Tony alone. Of course, it was no problem for Steve to jump it, but Tony was a different story. He wasn’t strong enough in his wolf form, he didn’t shift much growing up due to his father’s business and connection to the human side of the world. He did shift occasionally to stop it hurting each time, but he never trained as a wolf and only got to go on one hunt in his previous pack.
“No promises.” The omega smirked.
Another messaged pinged through.
“Why don’t you come and join us at the table?” Steve asked, looking down at Tony before looking at the two other alphas. Tony nodded in reply, sliding off the barstool and taking Steve’s hand. Steve held the omega’s drink for him and lead the three wolves over to his pack.
“A magician never reveals his secrets. Even though magic is a scam and I don’t care what that doctor in SHIELD Medical says.” Tony scowled, thinking about the male doctor who tried to lecture him about magic and blah, blah, blah.
“J cancel everything. I need to go home.” Tony spoke as soon as he stepped back into his workshop, a shaky hand running through his hair.
“Are you going to let your omega talk to me that way?” Brock looked at Steve, unimpressed.
“You’re so mean to me, I just wanted to talk to you.”
“Excuse me I was a great student. Top of my class.”
“You’re meant to say, ‘no Tony, you’re a delight to work with’. Don’t you know anything, Brucie-bear?”
The wolf was in unfamiliar territory, and the pack knew that when they travelled across the country on business. They had stopped to make camp for the night but had faked sleeping until Tony was asleep and left him. His pack was done with using him, had been for a couple of months now, especially as Obadiah Stane recently mated. He is the man Tony detested more than anyone in the world, even before his father had passed and he took his place as alpha. If Tony was strong enough, an alpha like his father wanted, Stane would not be leading the Stark Pack, and he would be out of it. He was able to outsmart the alpha, but not overpower the tyrant that made the wolf’s life a living hell every day of his life.
“He’s a friend. Don’t worry.” He looked over at Tyler apologetically. “Overprotective brother here you see. And the one that constantly reminds me of what a disaster I am... Tyler, this is Rhodey. Rhodey, Tyler. Not a threat.”
“I… um” Steve began before being cut off by his beta.
Fire rolled her eyes, head looking out of the door before running again. Tony followed, looking out of the door and up and down the hallway. His ears twitched, picking up on footsteps approaching. It was now or never for him. The wolf omega ran, hoping to catch up with Fire. They had been led through these halls so many times it was easy to remember the routes and escape points. Tony turned a sharp corner upon hearing some guards yelling from behind him.
“No.” Tony didn’t look up at the alpha as he replied, continuing to play the game.
Here comes Steve and a new friend for Tony.
Thank you for reading. I can't believe how many hits I've received, every time I look at it the number has increased and makes me want to cry.
“Is your alpha okay?” Bruce looked up at the alpha wolf that had just approached, eyeing the blonde.
The beta wolf henchman led him down the hallway, to another room where two guards were standing either side of the door. Tony looked them over, eyes furrowing. He didn’t recognise the men, but he recognised the bodyguard outfits and guns immediately. Tony walked into the room, a scowl on his face. The omega let out a growl upon seeing the man who made his life hell for years. The one that left him to die in the woods. He’d never thought he would see Obadiah Stane again.
Steve nodded in agreement. “I could stay here with you all day. But we should head back.”
“He deserves it most of the time.” Bruce sat up, stretching.
“Yeah, I just sometimes get nervous around higher-ranking shifters. Omega thing.” Tony shrugged before taking another drag.
“I should probably finish up the meal,” Steve said, breaking the silence that had formed, stepping back from the omega.
“Legolas?” The delta tried again.
Clint.
The round heads of the bots were red, with a faint gold pattern and a small blue ‘eyes’ which were sensors. The bots had golden arm-like claws so they would be able to pick things up and hold things. Tony used repulsor technology so they could fly. Each bot had a unique pattern on their heads, along with a slightly different program which made them have different ‘personalities’.
Steve let out a sigh. “I know you like cuddles.”
“Well, you know me. I get to know everyone.”
“But why were you under the door?” Steve asked looking at Tony, containing his laughter.
“We will find him.”
“But I was dancing just fine.” Tony frowned, taking a sip from his drink.
“I know tonight means a lot to you, Steve. Bruce and I were talking and we’re going to try to keep them as best behaved as possible.”
The alpha nodded in response, Bucky leaving the room with Sam trailing behind. Thor and Loki had moved all of the blankets and pillows that were sprawled out on the floor, packing them away in a large chest in the corner of the room. Steve had moved the coffee table back into the centre of the room to let Clint, Bruce and Natasha sort out the food. The omega was confused, he felt like he needed to do something to help out.
"You figured it out?" Wanda asked.
“Last time you were alone you were taken from me. You’re not safe. You’re a target as my omega.”
The house was huge, it had to be to fit them all in. It had four floors, the bottom was a basement that had been converted to a gym for training with a pool and a changing area with showers and toilets. The floor above had the living room, kitchen with a connected dining room, Thor’s room, two spare bedrooms and a bathroom. The first floor had Loki’s, Bruce’s, Clint’s, Sam’s bedrooms with another spare along with a bathroom and the bottom half of the library. The top floor had a study, Steve’s room with his en-suite, Bucky’s and Natasha’s room, a bathroom and the top floor of the library.
“There’s space in the wardrobe for your jackets. I don’t have much in there.” Steve pointed over to it, smiling sleepily as he stretched. “Want some help?”
Tony had never been so focused in his life. He had gotten so much work done since he got to the lab. It was 7 am now and Tony was yet to have a break, but Pepper was going to be joining him within the next hour or so, so he could break then.
“Hi, have you had an appointment for Tony Stark today?” Bruce asked, looking at the receptionist.
“Let’s go find my mate.”
“I needed to get away from that shit, and I need a smoke.” Tony huffed, looking at the two wolves’ surprised expressions. “I’m a social smoker. I’ve been partying since I was twelve with people way older than me. Most of them smoked at least… so I just joined in after a couple of years of being around them. I don’t do half the shit I used to but the need to smoke while drinking has never left.”
“Huh, really now? You seem a little bit confused.” Sam smirked at the delta.
“Finally!” Thor cheered. “Food at last.”
“Sorry, Tony.” The omega looked at Nat. Her hair was ruffled, and she had a few scratch marks on her face and neck. Clint was in no better shape, no doubt he was going to have a bruise in the morning.
“Traitor.” Tony frowned but couldn’t keep it for long, BRIE rubbing against his hand so she could be petted. “Fine.”
“Tony?” Steve got up, walking out into the hall were Bruce was hanging up his coat, DIEGO flying off to the other bots. “Is Tony staying late?”
“Omega. Get me another water.”
“To say no. He’s been texting me constantly and I’ve just been ignoring him. I-I can’t talk to him because I’ll just give in. Like I did before. He keeps asking me to do things with him in the pack and I got so overwhelmed thinking about it all.” Tony groaned hiding his face in his hands. “I was being exactly what Stane said I am. A desperate whore.”
“You can’t be mean to him tonight.” Steve looked up from his phone as it pinged again.
“P-pregnant?” Steve managed to stutter out.
“We’re still expecting that guidance system.” She tsk’d.
“Are you okay?” The newcomer’s eyes were full of concern as he looked over the omega who nodded.
“Steve?” The alpha heard Tony call.
The dark-skinned omega bit her lip nervously, giving a small wave. Her dark brown eyes were just as warm and kind as her mates, though held a lot of shyness too. Brooke sat between Tony and her omega, adjusting her mate’s black ringlet curls that had fallen to cover her eyes.
“There we go. I’m so proud of you. You can do this. Can you do it again?” Pepper asked as Tony nodded, both of them doing the exercises at the same time.
“Personal projects?” Steve asked, following Tony. “Hey, is that my shield?”
“Tony.”
“You’ve noticed Steve being all weird too, right?” The redhead asked, sitting beside her best friend on the bed.
Tony continued to work on his guidance system for SHIELDS helicarriers. Their current one was, well shit, as the omega had put it and so he was making a far better one for them. Tony still paid attention to Steve in the background, just in case the alpha needed him for anything. But the blonde seemed just fine, welcoming Rumlow into his home and offering to get him a beverage.
“Well, as long as no one is angry at you.” The omega grinned.
Tony jolted awake, vision slightly blurry as he sat up too fast, looking around. He wasn’t in the forest anymore. He was in a small, simple studio apartment room, tucked into a soft bed. Panicking, he looked around for his bag which he found placed by a chest of draws and let out a sigh of relief. His memory was slightly fuzzy from the night. Trying to think back, he climbed out of bed and made his way over to his bag, taking out a set of clothes and putting them on. The brunette was sure he was in his wolf form last, in the forest where his pack had abandoned him, he sat down for a rest and –
“I keep seeing blue eyes,” Tony spoke up after a few minutes of silence, Bruce was on the edge of dropping off before the omega’s statement caught his interest. “There’s an alpha I keep coming across… happened just last night and to summarise, he’s caught my interest.” There was a pause. “He is so hot. I wouldn’t mind sucking his dick.” Bruce’s eyes widened and made a strange choked noise that he played into the cough. “Nice butt too. One time another came to get him and called him Steve? I-I want a Steve. That Steve.”
Bucky left the room, going straight to the kitchen where he dragged Clint straight out of there before the archer could get into any more trouble.
“Trying to find your ass. Stay put or else someone else will be finding your body in the forest.”
“I-I’m going to get help, Steve. Pepper suggested therapy and I think I should at least give it a shot, right?” Steve nodded as Tony continued. “I started to try and compare you and your pack to my old one and it freaked me out even more. How I would let you down like I did them and you would all hate me and resent me. Banish me from the pack and ever seeing you again. I-I can’t do that Steve. I don’t want that.” Tony looked up at the alpha as a tear fell down his cheek, Steve reaching out to rub the omega’s cheek gently.
“Save it for Steve.”
like him back, to accept the man’s offer for dinner and see it as a date.”
Reasoning: Delta for the same reasons as Clint and Sam. I really did consider making Bruce an omega, but I wanted Tony to be the only omega in the pack (well, maybe it won’t be forever *wink*). His wolf form isn’t strictly a delta but isn’t an alpha or beta either. It’s more of a confused mixture of them all from when Bruce tried to experiment on himself to see if he could, as a delta, enhance himself so he could change his rank to something higher and stronger. The green tint to his fur is obviously in reference to the Hulk.
They soon arrived back at The Avengers Packhouse, Tony herding the bots to the house and through the door, Rhodey following behind.
“Come on Tony. This is our chance.” Fire slid off the bed. “We can escape.”
“Prefer what?” Steve tilted his head.
“To make a cup of tea?”
Reasoning: Loki had to be a beta, I wanted him to have a higher ranking than the others, and be Thor’s “second”, even though Thor isn’t the alpha leader of the pack. I chose a snow leopard for Loki because I wanted a feline, along with Thor so they could be similar, but he could have the snow/ice reference to the frost giants. His birth family were snow leopard shifters, just like him. I also wanted his fur to be much darker than a normal snow leopard, and I was thankful I managed to find one close to what I was going for. Originally, I thought about having a black snow leopard, but I went off it in the end, especially once I couldn’t find a picture to go with it and thought it would be too much like a black panther.
Tony hugged Loki tight, no doubt the beta didn’t look impressed with the contact, but he didn’t care. He could finally get some work done and get rid of his cabin fever.
“Put yourself at risk of being in another pack in case it goes wrong again?”
“You know what, Romanoff.” It was an empty threat that would have done nothing even if it wasn’t.
“You said it yourself. ‘Your omega.’ Steve is my alpha and I listen to him and our pack. I don’t have to listen to you.”
“We might not have a choice,” Bucky replied.
“Inside now. So far, it’s deserted. They probably heard the bang and have gone for backup with this alarm going off.” Natasha responded. “I can’t unlock the doors.”
“Yesterday.”
“Even backwards?”
“No, you stay in the quinjet. We’re fine here.”
“My pack used to attack me too.”
Steve began taking off his clothes, putting them away in a chest that was left outside as Tony stared at the alpha’s butt.
“Not even your aunt and uncle?” Steve asked as they began to walk through the woods to get to the quinjet.
Steve went to argue back, but Tony just shook his head, knowing it best not to argue with her. Tony stood up and hugged Pepper goodbye, doing the same to Rhodey when he had returned. Steve also said his goodbyes just before Tony could drag him out of the restaurant and back out to his motorcycle.
Tony went up to his and Steve’s bedroom, grabbing his bag. He was thankful that Steve didn’t snoop around and find it before he could give it to Bucky first. Tony held the bag close to his chest as he walked downstairs, Natasha giving him a look as she passed him on the stairs, probably being able to smell his nervousness but didn’t ask him about it. Tony walked outside, spotting Bucky lying on the grass and made his way over to him.
“We came the other night.” The redhead shrugged.
As soon as he got into the car the omega let out a sigh. He really should tell Steve where he was going. Tony looked down at his watch.
“It wasn’t him, Cap.” Sam vouched for the delta. “It came from inside the building. Looks like the wing at the North.”
Thank you to everyone reading this book, I love seeing the hits, bookmarks, kudos and comments increase each day. I love the comments I receive too. Thank you, everyone.
“Thor always walks behind us, so we’re protected from behind.” The delta nuzzled Tony to get him to stand. “Come on, I’ll walk with you.”
“If you really like this alpha, please go to dinner.”
"They're not going to fall for your tricks."
Pepper gave Tony a kiss on the cheek and ran a hand through his hair. “Please do this. You deserve to be happy.”
“I never was a good hunter.” Tony huffed, sitting down as Steve walked over to him. “I didn’t get trained after I failed my first training hunt.”
“Clint.”
Steve replied to the text before putting his phone and bottle back in his locker and taking out his towel and spare clothes. This was going to be a long shower.
Steve bent down to get out the pasta dishes from the cupboard, hearing the connecting doors from the living room into the kitchen open.
“Yes, daddy.”
“What do you want, Barton?” The alpha sighed, sitting up in his bed.
“He did?” Peter let out another gasp. “This is so cool I want to build a jet too!”
Tony nodded, thankful that the beta was there with him. Bucky kept his arm around Tony as the smaller wolf stubbed his roll-up and disposed of it. The beta shot a final glare at the alpha over his shoulder as they walked back inside. His arm remained around the omega until they both reached the table where Bucky went to sit between Sam and Bruce once more and Tony slid in next to Steve.
“You’ll see.” The omega bit his lip and finished loading the dishwasher before starting the cycle. “I’ll meet you outside in five?”
