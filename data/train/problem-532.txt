Sherlock’s eyes were stars. “Why?” he asked, his voice barely breath. John felt something inside him slide away, the rock face at the side of a cliff that had eroded far too much to hang on any longer.
“You maybe could have done with some stitches,” he said. “But it’s starting to clot up so I’ll go ahead and bandage it.”
“The journal,” Sherlock said. “Even amid the horrid prose there was evidence of undereducation. Spelling and grammatical errors. Simplistic word choice. And his handwriting spoke of a pen held in calloused fingers formed from a history of manual labor.”
“I shouldn’t have left you here,” Sherlock said. “Alone. I shouldn’t have left you alone with…” He gestured back towards the photographs again.
They were nearing their flat. They would be home in fifteen minutes, ready to get on with their life together. The traffic was thinner in the suburbs; John could make it home in ten if he sped up. He didn’t speed up.
“I don’t want you hurt,” Sherlock said, the words flying from him before he had a chance to call them back. “That is, I don’t like it. When you’re hurt.” He cleared his throat, wishing for some way to stop himself from talking. “I don’t like it.”
“The force of the sea has chipped away at the island,” Sherlock said. “Any soft slope of rock into the ocean is long gone. Only the hard edge of the cliffs remain. They’ll be whittled away too, over time. Made harder as the unrelenting elements come.”
“Papa says it’s because they’re idiots,” Rosie said. “I think it’s because they’re American. Papa said it could be both.” She looked to John. “Do you know, daddy?”
After fifteen minutes, it was clear that Sherlock wouldn’t be returning anytime soon. John went back inside and did his best to occupy his time. He took a shower, leaning out of the tub to check his mobile roughly once every minute. He had a go at making something to eat, but gave up midway through, his stomach far too choppy for food. He sent Sherlock another text.
“See?” Gilly said. “And where exactly did you see this relationship going, John, if not to marriage?”
“In more ways than one,” Sherlock said. His nose was against John’s forehead, in his hair. John was sliding towards sleep, warm and content and happy, so goddamn happy in Sherlock’s arms. He could feel Sherlock relax, his muscles going limp, his breathing slipping low and steady. John was perfectly willing to remain in Sherlock’s arms for as long as he was able, however long that would be.
“Seriously, though,” John said. “You scared the hell out of me today, Sherlock. He really got you with that bat, and then you weren’t moving, and for a moment I thought...” Sherlock could hear the faint rustle as John shook his head. His hand momentarily tightened in Sherlock’s hair.
John bent over double, bracing himself on his knees as his lungs screamed at him. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he wheezed.
Walking was too complex a task. It required multiple cells, for starters, to construct bones and joints and muscles and nerves. It required legs with long bones, flexible knees, and broad hips to manage stress and impact. It required a spine, preferably a curved spine to absorb shock, to carry messages to muscles. It required a skull, one positioned upright on his body and containing some sort of brain with a motor cortex to control the entire ordeal. All of this, of course, was countless stages of development away from where Sherlock currently lay on the evolutionary flowchart. Walking was right out.
John’s brain came partially back online and sent him a rapid-fire arrangement of memories from the day. Rushing to Sholto’s room, pleading with him not to let himself die (
John squeezed at Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s body was warm and firm behind him, his breathing coming in soft, tickling at his neck and the back of his ear. He could feel Sherlock slipping into sleep, his body—tense from three days of hypomanic chasing—uncoiling and sinking into the mattress.
“The Taibhse Brothers sending a message, perhaps?” John asked. “Meant to scare somebody? Threaten somebody?”
the host wouldn’t just open a door at random and risk giving away a car. They make contestants work for it. But in doing so, they’ve eliminated a guess.”
Instead, they were met by silence. Emptiness. The warehouse was shrouded in darkness, a blackness that seemed all-encompassing. The only sound to be heard was the wind outside and the occasional squeak of John’s shoes. As Sherlock’s eyes adjusted to the dim light coming through the cracks in the windows, he could tell that the warehouse was abandoned. Not so much as a rat bothered to take up residence at the moment.
Sherlock squatted in front of him. He nodded. His hands were on John’s face—medical, also checking him for injuries. “Are you hurt?” John could just make out Sherlock’s voice; his hearing was returning.
One of Sherlock’s contacts remembered seeing a woman who had a Polish name and spoke the language but had just enough of an accent to be memorable. She needed to unload a stolen motorbike, the man said. He had given her the information of a person who stripped cars. She had black hair, the man said, and was wearing an oversized jacket.
“You’re a bastard,” John said. The comment was somewhat undercut by the fact that he was still laughing.
John broke his gaze away from Sherlock once again, clearing his throat. “He’s not my—” he started. It was a habit at this point, correcting people. He and Sherlock had been mistaken for lovers more often than John could count. It hadn’t even gone away when John was
He heard a small noise from the other side of the room, a light puff of air. “You…” Sherlock breathed.
Sherlock made a little murmuring noise. “First bit of land across the whole of the Atlantic,” he said quietly, seemingly to himself. “Nothing to stop the storm of the sea. Uninhabitable.” He shook his head. “Nobody of sound mind would call this place a home.”
is mind-boggling. What’s our entire relationship, Sherlock?” John flung an arm in the air. “If not me following you around, doing your bloody bidding? You send me off on your bloody errands, you only let me in on your little plans when it suits your fancy, you
Sherlock lifted himself off John, his softening cock slowly slipping away. John moaned at the sensation, the feel of Sherlock’s come trickling out of him. He rolled himself onto his back with great effort, his torso a mess of smeared semen and sweat. Sherlock knelt over him, grinning.
“Oh Christ, Sherlock,” John gasped between breaths, barely able to pry his gaze from the sight of their cocks pressed together. Sherlock stroked them unrelentingly and it was almost too much, too fast, too bloody perfect. John felt as if every muscle in his body was tensing, burning, convulsing. He couldn’t breathe. He wasn’t breathing. He wasn’t getting in air. He grasped at Sherlock, fingers digging into his hips. He could see Sherlock’s cock purpling against his, could feel it as his cock swelled, hard ridges protruding against his own. Sherlock was making noises above him that if John ever dreamed of he would come on the spot.
“Don’t cut the excess,” John said. His eyes were squeezed half-shut, warring against a desire to no longer observe his own surgery. “I’ll have you do a running stitch. You know how to do that?”
A whirring noise, faint but growing louder, sounds through the room. You crawl beside Sherlock and peer up at the ceiling, brows furrowed. You expect to see a man drop through the opening in the ceiling, perhaps dressed darkly and wearing some sort of military-grade night vision goggles, but instead there emerges a tiny flying robot. The thing is sleek and black and has propellers at all sides guiding it smoothly through the opening and down into the lobby of the bank. A little light blinks just at its front, and a hook dangles from its center.
enjoy long baths—Sherlock was frustratingly right about that fact—and the giant bathtub was more than a little appealing to him.
“Small,” John said. He didn’t know the first bloody thing about boats. “White. Kind of like a speedboat.”
And that’s how John spent the remainder of January twenty-ninth, 2013—sitting peacefully on the roof, ignoring the cold and the spin of the city around him, looking up to the heavens with a bewildered smile on his lips and the faint notes of an old song tinkling through his head.
“Aye,” John said again, inwardly flinching at his own terrible accent. He had just committed himself to being silent and doing his best to maneuver the wheelbarrow through the field without tipping the whole thing over when he remembered that he and Sherlock were, in fact, supposed to be investigating a death or two. “So,” John said, mustering the best Irish accent he could. “Did you know Declan well?”
“It’s just that...Doctor Watson never said in his blog,” Conor said. “He never said how you did it. So…” Conor kicked at a patch of grass with his toe, suddenly shy. “How did you do it?”
Which scream was this, then? John checked his phone. Ah. This would be the three in the morning scream. The three in the morning scream was probably John’s least favorite.
Sherlock parked the car in the dirt next to the property manager’s car. The man waved at them, taking a step towards their car.
“Selecting the car from three options is a one-third chance,” Sherlock said, maneuvering three of John’s gnocchi to the side of his plate with a fork, “but when the host opens a door, he reduces three choices to two choices,” Sherlock speared a gnocchi for effect, popping it into his mouth. “A fifty-fifty chance.”
“Likely,” Sherlock said, tucking the flash drive back into his shirt. “The material is actually quite durable.”
The drone pauses just at an impressive-looking metal door that appears to be quite securely locked. There is a moment of nothing, and then a beeping noise sounds through the lobby. The door slides open.
“We’ll have to work on that,” Sherlock said, but John couldn’t help but notice the little smile that flickered across his face as he trotted up the stairs, leaving wet footprints behind. John watched him ascend the stairs, watched the way the muscles in his arse flexed with each footstep, and considered climbing the stairs after him, pushing Sherlock back onto the bed, and continuing what they had started.
“You knew everything about her, the pink lady, just from looking at her for two minutes,” John said. “If that.” He shook his head. “It was extraordinary.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, lifting John’s hand. “It seems he wasn’t the only one with that problem.” He spread John’s fingers between his, inspecting the middle and ring fingers, still ever so slightly crooked from an ages-old break.
“Um,” John said, glancing at Sherlock. The two of them had shared a room on out-of-town cases in the past, but the connotations seemed slightly different as of late. John had absolutely no idea what the protocol was anymore.
On a pedantic note, I know that a lot of the events I describe in this fic (e.g., the pink lady case) technically occur on January 30th. Just...shhhhhhh...
“Just stay,” John said. “Stay here on this earth. In one piece. With me. Okay? For as long as you can possibly manage.”
Molly scampered over to him. “I’ll just take those,” she said, plucking the sharp tools from his hands.
“You’re worried about my food intake,” Sherlock said, lifting what appeared to be three pieces of rice to his mouth.
At the hotel, Sherlock propped himself up in a chair and attempted to look up something or other on his mobile, but he was bleary and disoriented and nodding off over his own hands. John tugged him out of the chair and over to the bed that Sherlock hadn’t even glanced at since he’d walked into the room. Sherlock made little disgruntled noises, but curled up on the bed nonetheless.
. Which led me to Dunquin Vaults, a safe deposit box facility. The key was for a box. The last five digits in the string identified the numbers on the box. Which means...” He released John and whipped the duffel bag off his shoulder, ripping the zipper open to reveal its contents.
John nodded and Sherlock tugged him into sitting. John slipped his legs out from underneath Gilly’s body and climbed off the bed. Mrs. Hudson watched them, Gilly’s knife still in her hand, looking amused.
“The bloody dolphin they were prattling on about,” Sherlock said, waving an arm at the sea. “The one in the Sound. The one they all think is friends with the fisherman. It’s a ruse. A trick.”
leave, and John would lose Rosie forever. Even if Mary consented to some shoddy custody arrangement and John got her every other weekend or some similar bullshit, it would never quite be the same. He grew up with enough mates whose fathers stepped out; even the ones who saw their fathers on the regular hated them. They were nothing but the bastards who did their mums wrong, and that was all John would be relegated to in Rosie’s life. That is, unless Mary was very, very merciful. Based on the admittedly little John knew about Mary these days, she did not strike him as the merciful type.
Sherlock was up off the bed, pacing, nearly skipping over the broken bits of the floor. “Oh that’s clever,” he said. “It was right under our noses. Right under our noses, the whole time. I thought it wasn’t possible, but,” he tapped at his chin, giddy, “I wasn’t in possession of all the facts.” Fitz was up after him, darting along the floor at his side, excited that the room seemed to be in motion again.
Sherlock jerked his head to the side and a line of cracks sounded through his bones. “A bit late for this line of questioning, isn’t it?”
John reached to his side, clambering for the box of condoms. He shoved the thing at Sherlock’s chest, hoping that this would communicate with as much efficiency as possible that he needed Sherlock
Sherlock emerged from the kitchen, looking delighted and carrying what inexplicably seemed to be even more photographs of dead sheep.
Sherlock’s tongue felt to be twice the size of his mouth. He worked around it. “Clever,” he said. “I’m very clever.”
coming up—when was it? John checked his mobile and pressed his eyes shut. Yesterday. Their anniversary was yesterday. The significance of the date hadn’t once crossed his mind.
Sherlock swallowed once and then his face dissolved into blankness again. He released John’s arms. “What you did,” he said, “was stupid.” He moved back towards the house. His coat slipped from John’s fingers.
John pressed his eyes closed. He rubbed his temples. It felt as if his brain had been cooked on high and was currently a bit charred and smoldering.
John could have defended his case if he wished. He could have disagreed. He could have petitioned for other facts, different ones.
John had his hands wherever he could reach on Sherlock. Along his arms, down his hands, across his chest, over his face. He needed to feel the whole of Sherlock’s body, he needed proof of life, he needed to lay his hands on a miracle before he would well and truly believe in those sorts of things. He was gasping, blubbering, staring. It wasn’t particularly becoming of a grown man. He didn’t care.
“We were moving into a flat together,” John said. “After only knowing each other five minutes. Surely
Sherlock’s little circles became tighter and tighter and then he was pressing upwards, slipping in slowly, bit by bit. John gasped and cursed and moved slightly against Sherlock. There was pressure, his body tightening and adjusting to the new sensation, but there was a craving behind it, a need for more. He told Sherlock as such, mumbled it against his lips, pulsing his hips against Sherlock’s hand as his finger sank deeper inside.
For a moment, John thought his guts might change their mind. “I think—” he started. Then the boat lurched again and John fell to his knees and emptied the contents of his stomach into the bucket. The ground continued to rock beneath him as he gagged and heaved, the thick taste of bile heavy in his mouth. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock kneeling beside him, a gentle hand on his shoulder. John barely had time to bemoan the new dynamic this shared experience would add to their relationship before another wave of nausea hit him and he coughed dryly into the bucket. Sherlock rubbed at his shoulder.
That gentle stabbing feeling was starting to return, and John had a feeling that it didn’t matter what he managed to cobble together for dinner, as he would unlikely be able to choke down a bite of it.
“I’m married,” John leaned closer. He planted his hand on the other side of Sherlock’s head, uncrossing his legs and shifting into kneeling.
“No,” Sherlock said. He was immobile inside of John, filling him without fucking him and John was certain he would go mad from it.
John texted. In truth, Sherlock was right. He would have preferred rhubarb. But the knowledge of what kind of jam he preferred was something a boyfriend would possess and Sherlock was not his boyfriend. Sherlock was very clearly not his boyfriend. Sherlock would, very clearly, never be his boyfriend.
The glass shattered. The storm tore through the whole of the greenhouse and the windows exploded. Glass shards rained down upon them. John dove for Sherlock, pulling him down to the ground and covering him with his arms, his body. The water pelted upon them, drenching them nearly instantaneously. Sheets of water screamed across Sherlock’s back, driving him into the ground. He clutched at John. The both of them were shouting something indistinct.
There was a gentle tapping on the door, and Sherlock poked his head into the loo. He seemed cautious, as if unsure he ought to be opening the door even a crack.
desperate, practically gagging for it. Sherlock hadn’t moved, had barely even touched him, and John would have let Sherlock do anything to him—unspeakable things, nameless things,
So you go up onto the roof, especially after days like today—which is to say, most days. You watch the city turn to robots and watch as their arms move bits and pieces of London around and try to think of anything besides the gun. You think of your time in Afghanistan, the sand and the blood and the explosions. You think of men you knew, men you lost, men you should have saved. You think of the gunshot and the infection and the fevers, how they tried to kill you but didn’t quite manage. You think that they ought to have tried harder, the fevers. You think of what your mum might say about all this, if she were still around. You try not to think of that for too long. You think that you ought to phone Harry.
John raised his eyebrows, letting out a breathy laugh. “Here’s hoping,” he said. He studied the tattered jacket for another moment before tossing it in the bin. It was fairly well ruined. Pity, John thought, it was one of his better jackets.
He tilted his head to the side and spied the barest bones of a bed at the end of the room. Sherlock was sprawled on the bed, his head lilted to the side, his curls a frizzy mess. His chest rose and fell heavily; he was in a deep sleep.
He studied John. John wavered slightly in the doorway. He was inebriated earlier—he didn’t need much to get him inebriated now that Rosie was here—but had sobered up quickly. He was dressed smartly—too casual for work but too trendy for lounging around the flat. He had been out with someone.
“You’ll leave bit by bit,” Sherlock was saying, crowding closer. “Slow stages. Here and there. Slipping your way out in tiny pieces. Thinking I won’t even notice until you’re gone.” Sherlock scoffed. “I always notice.”
“Have you two ever been to the Island before?” Conor asked. His little legs swung in the air as he perched in the seat next to John, apparently unbothered by the turbulent waters.
John went to step forward again but Sherlock’s palm caught him in the shoulder, slamming him backwards. John lost his balance and he pitched into the hill just behind him, his body caught at an odd angle—not quite fallen, not quite standing. He tried to right himself, but Sherlock’s hand planted onto his chest, holding him against the steep hill. John could feel the grass—still a bit soggy from the rains a few nights ago—sink slightly under the pressure of his body. Sherlock leaned in close, his stony face covering the whole of the sky.
,” John said. “About relationships. About bloody human connections. I know just how little us ordinary idiots mean to the great Sherlock Holmes. And I refuse to have my romantic history dressed down by a man who couldn’t recognize the feeling of care for another person if it was screamed at him through a bloody megaphone.”
The man pressed a button on the mobile, eyes on John the whole time. He flicked the screen, switching to speakerphone. The sound of Sherlock’s mobile rang through the little speakers, echoing through the cave. John held his breath. The ringing stopped abruptly as the call was answered.
died—sentiment clung to odds and ends of John’s life in a way that was nonsensical. There were bits that were obvious, of course—things too painful for John to attempt to touch again. Baker Street was right out, as was Barts. He had to get a new mobile, of course, one wholly unfamiliar to him, with foreign ringtones. It only took one heart-lurching chime of a text from someone who was unforgivably
The two hadn’t kissed since Sherlock found the journal pages in the floorboards earlier in the day, an act of affection that was increasingly starting to feel like an impulsive decision on Sherlock’s part, a rash move made when the game was well and truly on. John had observed Sherlock make all sorts of split-second decisions when taken over by a bout of case-induced mania—he had once witnessed him literally leap through an open flame to rescue a piece of evidence—and very much did not want to be one of them. Settling back into a tentative business-as-usual manner certainly didn’t do much to relieve any of John’s worries. He didn’t know what to make of any of it, and didn’t want to press his luck by asking. Sherlock, as John knew all too well, tended towards the fickle and unpredictable; John found it best to just go with things. This was usually the best course of action with Sherlock in most other situations. Still, John found himself nearly glowing from just the warmth of Sherlock’s arm pressed against his.
The café was quiet and undisturbed. It didn’t look to John as if anybody had been in there since Sherlock came for the linens the night before, but Sherlock would likely be able to tell him otherwise by examining the dust patterns on the floor or something. Declan’s lodgings above the café also seemed unbothered.
You curse and follow, trying to stay out of the drone’s eyesight. By the time you’ve made it out of the bank, Sherlock is pacing around in the back alley, staring up at the row of flats above the bank.
Sherlock reminded him). As such, Angelo was perpetually thankful and made a point of demonstrating his gratitude whenever he could. Also, Angelo had heard about the fate that befell Old Delhi’s and knew that it could easily go the other way around for him if his luck ran out.
Sherlock was whirling about the café, a half-pace, half-dance sort of maneuver. Fitz zoomed around the little room, a positive feedback loop of energy. “
John blinked. He had forgotten all about the number that the nurse had passed along to him. It felt like ages ago.
“Dreams are the child in your mind let loose in the toy shop of your memories,” Sherlock said. “Illogical. Impulsive. Acting on a whim. Most of the time they are nonsense, forgettable. But some of the time they can hold meaning, communicate information. They talk to you, tell you what matters. What is important to you. What you fear.”
“Sod it,” John said. “I’m too bloody cold for this.” He stomped up the stairs to his room. His skin was pruning under his wet clothes and he thought he might never get warm. He could use a shower, but the idea of getting even wetter was off-putting. In his room, he peeled his frigid clothes off his body, throwing them in a pile in the corner. He rubbed his hands on his arms, took several deep breaths.
“Ah,” John said, doing his best not to seem as if he were gasping for breath when the two reached the top of the hill. “No.” He pointed towards the field. “Another one. This morning.”
The anger ought to return, John knew. Sherlock was being a dick, and John ought to stand up for himself. Preferably with his fists. Preferably until Sherlock had nothing left to say. However, the only thing he could feel at the moment was sad, and the only thing he could do at the moment was stare at the empty whiskey glass with stinging eyes. “Yeah,” he said. “I suppose it does.”
Lucy started down the path, sniffing at the air as she walked. Fitz darted after her, running in little circles around her, ushering her to the field. Lucy seemed unperturbed by Fitz’s presence, trotting along the worn path, just as happy as a sheep could be. John watched her until she was just a little white puff moving against the green.
They both lost their balance together. John folded backwards, pitching off the side of the boat, the man still wrapped in his arms. They hit the frigid, churning water together.
“I wish to say hello to our new friend,” Sherlock said. “And I hear that guns make terrific icebreakers. You stay here, and—”
take the money off the island,” John said. He flipped through the remaining pages. “What do you suppose he did with it?”
John grew used to someone pressing against him while he slept. It was standard for having a bed-partner; one wakes up with an arm flung over one’s chest or a shoulder leaned into one’s back or a cold foot tucked against one’s calf. Eventually it stopped waking him up at all. It didn’t even feel odd to have the heat of another person’s body pressed against his until he remembered that it shouldn’t be there. John shifted, turning his head to investigate.

“Breathe,” John said. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “Remember? Breathe.” He took a breath, deep and slow, feeling his back expand into Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock turns the two of you down a few more streets, each shadier than the last. A few homeless people start to line the street—authentic ones, not the kind who paint up their faces in order to stalk an alleged bank robber. He slows just ahead of one particular woman who is half-slumped against a wall, absently petting a shaggy dog who wore a bandana around his neck.
The clouds had rolled back in, unwilling to give the island too long of a reprieve from nasty weather. The sky was a dull grey that darkened in the distance—likely more rain in their future. The ground had barely dried from the storms from the day before last. John wasn’t sure how the whole of the island wasn’t one large mud puddle. The wind was particularly enthusiastic today, slapping John’s face and tearing at his hair long before he made his way around to the western side of the island, seeming as if it was barely stopped by the shield of the Cró. John could only imagine how angry the winds would be on the far side of the island. He wondered if Sherlock had been blown away.
Sherlock knocked John’s hands off the headboard and shoved him down onto the mattress, his face half-buried in a discarded pillow. He planted a hand between John’s shoulder blades, keeping his chest pressed to the mattress while his other hand had John’s hips raised. Sherlock lifted himself onto a knee and drove downwards into John, changing his angle so that his cock pounded against John’s prostate with each stroke. John wailed into the mattress.
Sherlock was fully hard now, and John could feel Sherlock’s cock through his pants, through John’s own pyjamas. Sherlock’s cock was pressed along the swell of John’s arse, nudging just into his lower back, hot and insistent against him. John thought about peeling off his trousers, tugging Sherlock’s pants down to his knees, and feeling Sherlock’s bare skin rut against him. The thought alone drove a shuddering breath from John’s lungs.
“I didn’t say that,” Sherlock said. “I am convinced that they were involved in some capacity. Perhaps they sent a lackey. Someone with whom Declan was familiar and felt safe around.” He shrugged, returning to Declan’s journal. “Their involvement makes Declan’s murder more interesting, but only infinitesimally.” He slapped both hands down onto the journal, sending a shock through John’s thighs. “But why are the
“They’ll be back for you,” John said, bending to scratch at Fitz’s ear. “In just a few days.” John considered how much of his time as of late had been spent talking to animals. Probably not a good sign, he thought.
You’re half-dressed for work, already running late and very much needing to be out the door in five minutes to even have a chance of making your train when your mobile chimes.
Sherlock pulled back slightly, lifting his head away from John’s neck. He stared at John with wide, blinking eyes. His lips were parted, and he seemed just as breathless as John was at the moment. Whatever Sherlock was feeling, it seemed to be genuinely reflected on his face. His cheeks were tinged pink. His breaths were ragged. His eyes were dark and dilated and wanting. His lips were full and red and open and the only thought in John’s brain at the moment was
John’s hands—his impossible, intricate hands—were all that was tethering Sherlock to this world, tugging him along, bringing him into a new state of being. It was foolhardy, perhaps, to trust something so delicate to something so strong, but John knew how to use his control well. He knew how to bend without breaking, twist without pain, squeeze without crushing. Sherlock, however, was uncontrolled. He thrust his hips upwards into John’s hands, moaning into John’s mouth, doing his best to communicate that he needed faster harder more. Not having language was terribly inconvenient in times like these. John understood, his lips tugging into a smile and a little puff of a chuckle escaping against Sherlock’s mouth. His grip tightened around Sherlock, speeding up, wrist twisting, muscles flexing, fingers moving, turning, pulsing. Sherlock made a sound like a whimper—what would have been a little lost noise of a new being surrounded by unfamiliar terrain, unsure of what to do, except Sherlock wasn’t lost and he wasn’t unsure and nothing was unfamiliar about the way John touched him; Sherlock knew exactly what he wanted and where he was going. John was coming with him.
“I did,” John said. “I meant it.” He turned to Sherlock. “Did you hear me? From wherever you are now? Did you hear my little speech?”
John had a sense that it was his turn for a confused look, but Sherlock tipped his head back towards the ceiling and closed his eyes. Conversation time, it would seem, was over.
“You don’t need any fixing,” John said. “You’re beautiful and a monster and the center of it all. You’re perfect.”
when he starts moving, the bastard, just when it’s too much. He’s fucking you in a way that would make you come in no time if you hadn’t just come moments ago and you think you might fall apart from it. He’s pressed nearly flush against you and sounds like a goddamn porn star as he breathes in your ear, all grunts and growls and panted breath on your skin.
John tilted his head towards Sherlock. “In no version of reality do you owe me an apology, Sherlock.”
Not literally, of course, but it felt a bit literal at the moment. His body seemed lost in a swirling emptiness, twisting about in nothing. Either he was moving very fast, or the nothingness was; it was hard to tell. He seemed to have lost proprioception. He also seemed to have lost feeling in his extremities. He was relatively certain that he was still in possession of all four limbs, but he didn’t have very much of a clue where they were at the moment. Attached to his torso, hopefully, although he also wasn’t particularly sure where his torso was at the moment. It was all a bit odd.
Sherlock dropped to his knees, mouthing at the bruises on John’s ribs, down his sides. His hands rubbed along John’s waist. “How many times did they kick you?” he asked.
John shifted his weight onto his good leg, thumbing open his flies. “You’ll have to cut these off me,” he said, nodding down at his trousers. “There’s scissors in the first-aid kit.”
“Shit,” John said, trotting along at Sherlock’s side. “The whole time? He’s been here the whole time?”
John cleared his throat again. “Who…” John very much looked as if he did not want to ask the question leaving his mouth. “Who...started it?”
“Indeed,” Sherlock said. “And I couldn’t help but notice that many of the couples you killed were cheating on one another. I would wager they all were unfaithful, all your victims. That’s how you select them, is it not? Couples in which one or both partners were having an affair? Couples that present to the world as if perfect and happy but are housing a secret?”
Sherlock groaned loudly but lifted himself off the sofa all the same, adjusting an erection that had Mrs. Hudson glancing away again, blushing. He stormed back to the bedroom to change, clothes flying about in his wake.
Sherlock shook his head. His hands drifted up John’s sides. He felt John’s ribs expand and contract through his shirt. John wasn’t here. John was all in his head. He didn’t have to answer any of these questions.
“Whatever your patient had stuck up his nose,” the man says. “He put it up there on a dare. It’s the most probable reason, anyway.”
He tilted his head back to look at her. “Did you ask me to move in just so you could find out if we’re serious?”
“It’s an old house,” John said. “Drafty. Also,” John shifted backwards, wriggling against Sherlock, gathering evidence, “are you wearing any clothes?”
“I’m not capable of either of those things,” John said, a bit more breathlessly than he’d like, “and you know it.”
noise. For a moment, he forgot what he ought to do with his arms and they stuck out on either side of Sherlock’s body, waving in the air like a bug on its back. Sherlock squeezed him tighter and John rested his hands on Sherlock’s back, rubbing at his shoulder blades. Sherlock’s heart was hammering in his chest; John could nearly feel it reverberating through his own body.
for John, could he? The very possibility was enough to make John’s heart do a series of complicated acrobatics, and it
The shamming-Irish bit had come as a complete surprise to John. As the two of them arrived at the Dingle Marina, bags slung over their shoulders, Sherlock began asking around for the O’Sullivans in an Irish accent so fluid it sounded nearly perfect to the untrained ear. Indeed, the passers-by Sherlock inquired with didn’t give him a second look, pointing him towards a small building with a sign reading
This, however, meant that John’s social interactions consisted nearly entirely of time spent with Rosie. He could feel his social skills dropping away in large chunks. He reasoned that in a few more weeks he would revert to babbling and screaming as his sole means of communication. As such, when Lestrade asked if he wanted to grab a pint, John agreed immediately.
Sherlock tilted his head back towards John. He smiled at John, a sweet, sad thing. John shook his head.
Rosie walked into the kitchen. She was still wearing the skirt and jumper she wore to school earlier that day, but had removed her stockings. Her bare feet flapped across the floor. The pigtails into which John painstakingly tied her hair this morning were mussed and frizzy, one hanging much lower than the other. Dangling from one hand was a notebook filled with mad scribblings that were clearly not hers.
John wasn’t certain if he could handle any increase in physical affection from Sherlock without imploding in some manner. He was barely handling the contact as it were. He rubbed at Sherlock’s back. “I’m sure the serial killer will be by to cut us to bits in no time,” he said.
“It would seem congratulations are in order,” Sherlock said, and it sounded as if he had to shove himself further onto the blade to even speak. Then he turned and strode from the cottage, leaving John alone with his fiancé.
Sherlock exited the car and approached John and Hugh, his face carefully devoid of anything unpleasant.
“Isn’t it soon?” he asked. They had only been together a few months. But then, he agreed to move in with Sherlock after knowing him for only a day. In comparison, this seemed a snail’s pace. That said, Mary was no Sherlock.
“I don’t know,” John said, and it looked as if the words left him before he had a chance to stop them. “I have to, Sherlock. It was just…” he shook his head, regrouped. “It was just a drunk shag. That’s all. It was just the once. It didn’t mean anything. Hell, I can’t even
before Sherlock wondered if bringing John along on cases wasn’t a smart idea anymore. Not that John had very much time to tag along on cases after the baby came, anyway. Sherlock worked a few cases alone and was blindsided by how much he missed John. He called at least three of Lestrade’s forensic officers
“No!” Mary said. “Janine?” She laughed, clapping her hands together. “Well,” she said, thinking. “I suppose they got on rather well at the wedding, didn’t they?”
He needed to get out of this greenhouse, get out of 1895, get out of this wild predicament he had found himself in. He took back all the compliments he was prepared to shower upon Wiggins—this, as it turned out, was torture.
For a moment, Sherlock forgot how to do everything. He forgot how to breathe, how to think, how to move his limbs, how to work his mouth. He was a white ball of panic who had forgotten how to do anything except exist with John’s mouth pressed to his. Then he remembered. He surged forward against John, grabbing at the lapels of John’s jacket and pressing their bodies together. John’s lips parted against Sherlock’s and then Sherlock was tasting him, tongues tangling together. John tasted of whiskey and vanilla and a taste that was uniquely John, a taste that Sherlock had previously only imagined. John’s hands were gripping Sherlock’s face, winding into his hair, pulling him closer, closer. Someone was moaning and Sherlock realized that it was him.
I’ve never cheated before, not even when I was a dumb kid at uni. Now I’m just one of those arsehole husbands who throws everything away for—”
Seeing as Sherlock was a water-dwelling prokaryote, showering seemed redundant and wholly unnecessary.
“Not yet,” Sherlock said, doing something like pouting in John’s direction. “You’ll have to light a fire for me, John.”
John wilted forward—slowly, things move slowly underwater—and pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s. Soft, a leaf landing on the still surface of a lake. Sherlock’s lips were dry—he didn’t need to produce moisture underwater—and John was patient, barely moving his mouth at all, the skin of his lower lip sticking to Sherlock’s upper lip, tugging without demanding. Sherlock felt a puff of air escape from John’s nose, floating across his face like the thinnest of clouds. John had lungs. He took in oxygen. He expelled carbon dioxide. One day, he could help Sherlock breathe.
Fitz danced a bit around the room, unsure what was going on but swept up in the excitement, happy to have been a good boy.
“That you do,” John chuckled. He placed the gauze on Sherlock’s arm. “Hold this just there,” he instructed, fumbling for a bandage.
John got his leg planted on the sofa, and with a mighty shove they were both rolling off the side. Sherlock’s back hit the floor and John was on top of him, the both of them wedged between the sofa and the coffee table. Sherlock looked up at John with a mixture of surprise and something else, something that crackled like the lightning just outside their window.
“Yeah,” John said, “but if it makes this whole thing more convincing you can keep on with it. If it’ll help us catch the killer, that is.”
he did—and pulled it from his pocket with shaking fingers. He considered what sorts of deductions Sherlock might make from the number of attempts he needed to get the key into the lock, scratching metal against metal. He dismissed the thought and shoved the door open.
Sherlock said nothing, because of course John already knew the answer. They both did. The rush of water screamed behind him. The whole world was freezing and John’s body, so close to his, was the only warm thing.
Right, so the problem with the cat came about when John was walking home from school and saw a classmate approaching the thing. He thought about calling out, warning the boy that the cat wasn’t friendly and was likely to bite. However, before he got the words out the boy crouched down and held a hand out to the cat. The cat walked right up to him—no hissing or anything—and grazed the top of its furry head against the boy’s outstretched palm. The boy scratched behind his ears and the cat’s little eyes closed, pressing into his fingers. The cat moved around the boy’s squatted legs, rubbing against him. John swore he actually heard
“No,” John said. “It doesn’t even make sense to keep Sherlock here. I was the one who cheated, Gilly. This was all me. Do whatever you like to me, but please.
Sherlock looks at you as if you are the sweetest little kitten who just learned a new trick. “Well done, John,” he says. “I mean, we
—but he couldn’t miss the way in which Sherlock’s mouth tightened whenever his eyes landed on the thing. John pressed his hand into Sherlock’s and Sherlock gave it a squeeze as the two of them walked out of the café and down towards the ruins, where Sherlock could yell at more of the Irish police force for not doing their jobs up to Sherlock’s standards.
“So what you’re saying is,” Sherlock said, nibbling on a bite of the torte, “if the host chooses a door at random, I’m right.”
into his partner’s ear. John had gone past losing his appetite and was now worried he might actually be sick.
Sherlock settled down on the pillows, burrowing underneath the blankets and shutting his eyes. “I wouldn’t
John glanced down at his hands. His knuckles were a shredded mess, but his hands, at least, had stopped shaking from the fatigue and effort of use. “You sure?” he asked.
Manning the café was a bit overwhelming when the tour initially descended, everyone crowding into the little building and pushing money at John, requesting drinks and snacks in a variety of accents. Most had questions for John, ranging from inquiries about the sheep to curiosities about life as a caretaker here—what his day-to-day life was like, how he got on with no electricity, if the seals on the beach ever bit anyone. John did his best to stick to one-word answers initially, but found himself growing bolder with tourists who hailed from places far away from Ireland. Something in him figured that a group of 20-year-old Americans wouldn’t be able to pick a genuine Irish accent out of a lineup.
It was foolish, Sherlock considered, to ever believe he didn’t know how to do this. To say he didn’t know how to do this was to say that he didn’t know how to walk, how to speak, how to breathe. Loving John was as easy as breathing, and of course Sherlock had known all along.
Sherlock looked bored. “Black market,” he said, waving a dismissive hand. “Been a string of those lately. I’ve a few names. Dull. Molly,” he glanced over where Molly stood with her clipboard, startled by his sudden address. “Have you ever heard of the Monty Hall problem?”
Sherlock’s mouth moved vigorously against him, bobbing against his cock faster than John thought possible. He could feel the head of his cock slam against the back of Sherlock’s throat with each stroke and Sherlock was doing something with his tongue John didn’t understand and there was no gradual crescendo, no slow progression towards a climax. Sherlock sucked his cock like he was trying to rip the orgasm from John with his tongue and he would do it, John knew. He could feel himself already dangerously close and he didn’t understand. He didn’t understand what had happened or how they had gotten there. He didn’t understand why Sherlock was on his knees in front of him right now, sucking him off as if they gave prizes for that sort of thing, but it certainly didn’t seem like it was because Sherlock fancied him. He didn’t understand what it felt like, if it was good or bad or nothing or everything because the whole of him was screaming and it was too much and his nerves were crackling like shocks of static electricity and he still wasn’t breathing and he was starting to see spots and it didn’t make sense that it should feel so perfect because it hurt in more ways than one but
“Because,” Sherlock said, popping off the sofa and grasping Mrs. Hudson by the shoulders, “John and I will make certain their deaths were not in vain. Justice for all, Mrs. Hudson!”
The ceiling of the cave was higher than the mouth, creating a jagged dome inside the interior, yet the cave itself was small, a little circular opening in the island, just big enough for Darren’s boat to turn lazily about. It was cold in there, the chill of damp immediately slipping under John’s skin. Darren turned the boat engine off and they bobbed about in a near silence, the lapping of water against rock dancing across the walls. The light shone through the cave opening and glinted off the water, throwing shimmering reflections across the slick rocks. The whole thing had a quality of magic to it, as if the four of them had managed to step into a place that was not quite real.
“All right then,” Sherlock said, taking another sip of his tea as well. John couldn’t be sure, but it seemed as if the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched upwards around the rim of his teacup just for a moment.
Sherlock smiled down at him, a breathy, disbelieving smile that seemed to be slowly working its way to belief. He stroked at John’s face again, slower, and the reverence was back. John could have melted from it and he was reasonably certain he already had. He was vaguely aware that, just behind Sherlock, the whole of the night sky spun around them, the glistening light of stars and galaxies and all-encompassing infinity, surrounding them once again, wondering just what their center was up to. John couldn’t see any of it. All he could see was Sherlock smiling down at him.
“What the hell are you two doing here?” Mary asked as soon as they were all inside. “And how did you find me?”
goings-on, specifically the goings-on that occurred in their bathroom at half-three in the morning, and John was not interested in answering any of these questions.
alone,” you say. “You aren’t lonely, but you’re alone.” You run your hand down his body, following lines of muscle down his neck, his shoulders, his biceps. Your eyes land on a patch of scars along his arm, just at the crook of his elbow and down his forearm. Little circular scars, the tiniest of dents in his skin. Made from needles.
John started a low crawl over to the coat-rack, scanning the remainder of the cottage as he went. From what he could see, the sitting room and kitchen were undisturbed. It didn’t look as if any windows were open or broken. It certainly sounded as if the noise came from outside,  but John wondered if they ought to check the upstairs rooms as well.
Sherlock’s hips were grinding against John’s, little stuttering thrusts. He lifted himself onto his elbows and nodded towards the bedside table, not stopping his movements, not capable of stopping.
“You know enough,” Sherlock said, eyes back on his plate. “It’s not all that different from how…” he gestured between the two of them, “we are.”
John stared at her. He could hardly make sense of what he was seeing. “Gilly…” he said. “What are you…”
“All finished with that,” he said. “Good as new.” He tried for a smile but didn’t quite succeed. Sherlock’s fingers released their tension on John’s side but remained pressed gently against his skin. John was grateful for their presence.
“I just need you to know,” John said, “that it means the world to me—the absolute world to me—that you’re doing all of this.”
It was like dipping into darkness, falling deep into a swirling emptiness, twisting about in nothing. The world was black and pulsing and hot and spinning and Sherlock seemed to have lost proprioception again, lost his limbs, lost his full sense of self in this space. He was vaguely aware that he was moving, that the limbs he wasn’t sure he had anymore were flailing, thrashing. He could feel a burn in his chest and a rattle in his throat and had a feeling that he was making noise, a lot of noise. His brain was nothing, not even porridge, and he was floating in the emptiness except it wasn’t empty and he wasn’t alone this time. John was there, his hands on him, inside him, coaxing him along, breathing sweet sounds into his mouth, loving him, loving him, loving him.
“Spare me the hyperbole,” Sherlock growled. He was in the kitchen now, storming around and accomplishing nothing. “All I ask of you is that you manage to choke out even an ounce of
Mary popped up from behind the table, fired again, ducked back down. “I can’t see him,” she hissed. “Can’t tell where he’s shooting from.”
“Mister Holmes,” the man said, holding the phone in a calm hand, just at his lips. “I believe you have something that belongs to us.”
“John...” Sherlock started, although he wasn’t particularly certain how he intended to end that sentence. Words seemed just beyond him. His tongue was dry and cumbersome.
John sighed, running his hands over his face. The restaurant was mostly as he remembered it, minus a few touch-ups here and there and some updated artwork on the walls. There was a sweet swell of classical music that Angelo always piped in over the speakers, a soft violin that could barely be heard over the din of patrons enjoying their meals. What John hadn’t been expecting was the
Just last night, Sherlock had woken John at half-two in the morning by tearing about his bedroom. There had been yelling. It was not pretty. John was expecting the strop to have escalated in severity when he descended the stairs, fully prepared to find the windows blown out and the flat looking like a hurricane blew through. He was not expecting a smiling Sherlock. He was not expecting a case.
than willing to…” he glanced back towards Sherlock and stopped. Sherlock’s head drooped low over his dangling forearms, his hunched shoulders nearly at level with his knees. His curls—still a mess and covered with debris—hung over his face, but John had the distinct notion that Sherlock wasn’t able to keep his face a blank slate anymore. He had a feeling that, if he could see the expression on Sherlock’s face, it would slice him open.
Sherlock laughed, an angry sound, and stormed from the kitchen once more, resuming his pacing through the sitting room. “Not for one second have you ever given a whit what I feel.”
His body felt battered and creaky, an old door that badly needed oil about the hinges. He eased himself back down the stairs and out the door, his legs informing him that they weren’t quite in the mood for another extended hike just yet. His back suggested that the whole of him just lay down, on an
His mate’s gun shifted slightly. His finger tightened on the trigger. His heavy gaze moved from John to Sherlock. He nodded. The both of them were prepared to fire when ready.
“No,” Sherlock said, sitting down across from John in his chair. “You used to leave in the evenings sometimes. Off to spend time with that…” he waved a dismissive hand, “doctor.”
He scanned the area around the cottage for the shooter, but it would appear that Sherlock was correct about the man staying away for a while. The trail of blood he left behind, pointing towards the shore, also suggested that the man wouldn’t be back anytime soon. Some good news there, John supposed.
John turned, pointing his body towards the stairs, the door, the street that led away from Baker Street and back towards the flat he shared with Mary, far away from Sherlock.
moment specifically would have uncovered the bones of the memory from the dredges of Sherlock’s mind, he would have run from the building in the middle of the first dance, leaving his violin clattering to the floor behind him. He would have given anything not to remember. It was the first instance in Sherlock’s life in which more knowledge was a detriment. As it was, however, he did remember. And, despite his best efforts, he seemed unlikely to forget.
Sherlock stood. He towered over John again, his expression intent, scrutinizing. It seemed as if he had a host of thoughts whirling in his brain, whole paragraphs of information connecting and writing themselves out, long and silent. John wondered if Sherlock would speak any of them out loud.
“Yeah. Well,” John flattened himself onto his back, eyes on the ceiling. “I don’t think Hugh had any doubts as to the status of our relationship.”
“Right,” John said. “Not for lack of trying, though.” He took Sherlock’s hand in his, turning it over. “Case in point,” he said, kissing at a scar that ran just below Sherlock’s thumb. “Remember this? That serial killer from Cambridge who nearly took your hand off?”
Hearing Sherlock say it out loud to another person, not just in the privacy of their flat—that sure was different, now wasn’t it? John felt like he might have started sweating at some point. “Boyfriend,” he repeated, and he was midway through his handshake with Hugh before he realized he hadn’t actually said his own name. “John,” he corrected.
“I have you,” Sherlock growled, “and I’m never letting you go again.” He squeezed at John’s cock and slammed into John’s arse so hard it stole the breath from his lungs and then John was coming, body thrashing and convulsing, shouting nothing into the air as he painted his stomach and chest with hot streaks of come.
You consider that it might be more than a little daft for you to be going along with this man, this man who is aggressively pursuing a man that Scotland Yard firmly believes is not a bank robber, in a manner that Scotland Yard firmly discouraged him from pursuing anybody. Black Jacket turns another corner and you follow all the same.
“Sorry,” John said, trying to shake the shock from his head. “It’s just...unexpected. I didn’t think you went for that sort of thing. I mean…”
“Why hide away with your unending supply of meaningless girlfriends, as if you would prefer to be anywhere other than this flat?”
You don’t text him. You don’t trust yourself with what you might say. Everything you’ve got in your brain sounds like a broke addict pleading for another fix. You need to regain a bit of your composure before you even think of reaching out. You need to detox.
“Quite,” John said, the stroke of his hand steady on Sherlock’s back. “Worst flatmate I’ve ever had.”
“It doesn’t matter,” John said. He was going for his shirt now, carefully avoiding eye contact. “None of that matters.”
Darren loaded Lucy onto his little boat. She paced a bit inside, bleating in complaint at her new environment and likely the lack of grass. John worried at his lip.
Sherlock nodded again. His brain was remembering how to work in stops and starts, periodically flashing him helpful bits of knowledge and experience instead of non-stop screaming panic. He knotted the suture once more for good measure, then secured the needle back in the holders to continue his work.
Sherlock turned off the taps and the loo was plunged into silence, save for his own breaths and the drip of water from his body. The rusty squeak of the shower curtain rings echoed through the room as Sherlock slid the curtain open, looking for a towel.
He pushes you towards the bed and the two of you fall onto it together. The springs give an angry croak as the both of your shoulders land. The mattress is thin and the frame is narrow, certainly not the sort of thing built for two, but he’s managed to slot a leg in between yours and wrap you in close to his chest and you have a feeling the two of you will make it work. You’re trying to work the buttons on each other’s shirts simultaneously, knuckles knocking together. He lets out an irritated noise and pulls himself off you to tug his shirt off himself. You hear a button pop off and bounce somewhere out of sight. Under his shirt, he is slim and pale, lines of muscle and bones carved into his skin. You run your hands over him greedily, as if he’ll be taken away from you any moment now, which, knowing your luck, he probably will.
Sherlock rolled on top of him and John wrapped both legs around Sherlock’s waist, urging the movements of his body closer, tighter, harder. John wasn’t sure it was enough to make either of them come but he didn’t care. He just needed Sherlock close at the moment, needed as much of Sherlock pressed against him as possible. His hands clambered across whatever part of Sherlock’s body he could reach—grasping at his shoulders, scratching down his back, gripping his arse, feeling his muscles clench as Sherlock ground into him.
“I’m yours,” John said. “God, I’m yours, Sherlock. I've always been yours.” He lifted his head, trying again to catch Sherlock’s lips on his. Sherlock remained just out of his reach, the corners of that bloody mouth of his lifting into a sly smile.
“Oh god, it all makes sense now.” Lestrade’s hands were in his hair. He looked like he did the day Sherlock accidentally caused two bodies at a crime scene to explode. “The wedding still being on. Your odd looks when I asked you about it. You and Sherlock acting like nothing happened. You don’t remember.” Panic slapped across his face. “I shouldn’t have said anything. I should have kept my great big bloody mouth shut.”
And he knew he shouldn’t, he knew he ought not to, he knew it was the very definition of self-centered unfairness, but there was only one person he thought of in the moment.
Somewhere in the building, the commotion continued. Yelling. A cry of pain. In the room, someone moaned, rolled over on their mattress. The springs creaked, complaining. A rat scuttled by Sherlock’s head but he didn’t notice.
“Oh,” John said. “Right. That too, I suppose.” He rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “Bit of an awkward piece to forget, that.”
“No,” Sherlock said, his brow furrowing. “You’re wrong. I…” He shook his head. “I shouldn’t have left. I should have found another way to save you. There had to have been another way. I just wasn’t clever enough.”
Sherlock shook his head. “No,” he said, pressing his lips to John’s in a sloppy approximation of a kiss. His hands roamed across John’s face, fingers tracing along his eyes, his cheeks, his jaw. “You’re here. I have you here with me.” He wrapped his arms around John, buried his face in John’s neck. “I have you,” he said into John’s drenched collar.
Gilly shrugged. “The two of you were trying to find me,” she said. “I thought I’d pop in. Say hello. It’s quite rude not to at least make an appearance when you’re invited somewhere.”
“Ah,” John said, wishing that he had eaten a bit more of the linguine as a show of gratitude towards the man. “Yeah. I did. Thanks so—”
“It’s unbelievable,” John said, “what I feel for you. Christ, you’re all I’ve dreamed about for years now. You’ve taken over the whole of my head, the whole of my life, and it’s
John asked Mary later). Catching Sherlock’s gaze during his speech and seeing something that John didn’t fully understand, feeling something that he understood even less (
John blinked. For a moment, he had no idea what Sherlock was on about. Then he remembered stumbling back to Baker Street the morning after Sherlock shot Magnussen, blearily falling into Sherlock’s bed and not moving until the afternoon, his dreams full of fire. A pang of shame lodged itself in his throat, as if he’d been caught doing something unseemly.
Sherlock’s angry laugh came from the bottom of the stairs. “You’ve been about as helpful as a wax statue,” he said. “I should have just gotten one made. Then you’d be free to stay far away from me, back home with your bloody girlfriend.”
John felt the sides of his mouth twitch upwards. “Yeah,” he said. “I can be.” He held Sherlock’s gaze for a moment, the two sharing light, incredulous smiles—too tentative to believe that any of this was actually happening.
When John arrived downstairs, Sherlock was out in the loo for a wash and Fitz was standing on the kitchen table, devouring what appeared to be a plate of beans.
impossible. And yet.” He shook his head again, then lifted his bag from the ground, following Claire along the hill.
John,” he said. “He’s interested in the sheep. Which,” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, glancing over John’s shoulder in the direction of the back half of the island, “neither of us are watching at the moment.” At that, he pushed past John, heading for the path that led back to the east side of the island.
Sherlock groaned. His head fell forward against John, slapping against his collarbone. He released John’s arse with an irritated sigh. The mobile buzzed again, dancing across the wood of the nightstand.
.” He turned back towards the corpse. “Have you had any other corpses turn up that have been removed of their organs or is this the only one?”
“All right,” John said. “Careful.” He pushed back with his feet, sliding himself back up the cliff, dragging Sherlock along with him. He could feel the mud seeping into his trousers as he moved but he couldn’t be arsed to care. Midway up the hill, Sherlock turned himself, glancing at John with a bit of caution.
side of the bed back when he shared a bed with another person, and Sherlock must have slipped under the blankets next to him. Sherlock lay on his back, the length of his arm tucked firmly down John’s spine. His head was tilted to the side, face pointed away from John, the long line of his throat glowing white in the morning light.
He fell backwards onto the bed, trying to let his body sort through the odd mix of arousal and worry and disappointment that seemed to be throbbing through his innards. His arm flopped to the side and he felt the warm patch where, until just a moment ago, Sherlock lay. John rolled to his side, running a hand along the divot in the mattress where Sherlock once was. For someone who woke this morning complaining about being cold, he sure seemed to give off a lot of heat. Or perhaps that was the both of them.
The ground beneath him was cold and hard and swaying, a rhythmic undulation, a back-and-forth that was making him a bit nauseous. His head throbbed, dull and angry. He could feel a crust of blood itching on the side of his head, hardened over his eyes.
Sherlock insisted on doing another search of Declan’s room and the café, not that their investigation of that space had been particularly fruitful the day before. Sherlock was able to deduce from the soles of Declan’s shoes that he had made the trek around the island a dozen or so times himself, but mostly walked on the beach or in the field with the sheep. An impressive deduction, John supposed, but it didn’t get them any closer to solving any murders, sheep or human.
Here, you’re just another slow-moving bloke on the pavement. Nobody cares that you stitched a man’s arm back on in a tent with barely enough gauze on hand and a nurse who looked to be seconds away from vomiting up every piece of food he ate in the last week. Nobody cares that you’ve had a total of ten men bleed out in front of you throughout your career, turning blue while you shouted orders, while you put compressions on wounds, while you tried until the very end. Nobody cares that you kept working even after the bullet went through your shoulder, that they had to pull you away from the firefight, that you had to give instructions to your own men as to how to treat your wound, how to bandage you up. That you watched them do it wrong anyway, watched them botch up the cleaning, the bandaging. That you watched yourself get infected, go mental with fevers, and very nearly watched yourself die.
it’s too much and the whole of you shakes and that’s what he wants, you know—you shaking and clenching and quivering on his cock. He’s breathing something into your ear and you realize it’s your name—he’s whispering your name back to you and you scream against your arm and your legs nearly go out from under you and when he pulls out you feel like something’s been taken from you, some vital organ removed without your consent. You feel his come splatter against your arsecheek, and it’s a courtesy, you suppose—an easier clean-up than having him leak out of you all night—but you can’t help wishing he hadn’t, that you could feel him warm and wet inside you. He bends down and licks his own come off your arse and Jesus
“Do you know how I’ve wanted you, Sherlock?” John said, resting his head against Sherlock’s shoulder. “I thought for so long that we would never… But,
The man doesn’t have anything close to a twisted lip at the moment—everything on him is all right angles and his lips look like something you might fantasize about later, hand in your trousers—but you know what blokes can do with a little makeup.
“That.” John could feel his face growing hot. “And I just...I never really saw you have anyone stay over at the flat except for Janine, and I…” He shook his head. “Never mind. Forget I asked. Please.”
John found himself still a little swept away from the whole of it, although mostly (if he was being honest with himself) by the lingering feel of Sherlock’s lips on his. “What?” he asked.
“We agree on that last bit,” John said. He closed his book, tapped at the cover. “It’s not all you, though. Not even mostly you, really. Sarah and I weren’t right.” He shook his head. “Definitely shouldn’t have gone to New Zealand with her, that’s for damn sure.”
Fitz seemed comprehensive in his search of the room. He examined each corner, poked his head underneath Declan’s dressers, and even scooted underneath the bed, emerging with cobwebs coating his fur. John brushed the cobwebs off of him but Fitz paid them no mind, moving about the room with his nose firmly planted to the ground.
Mary hadn’t exactly told John that they’d be naming her Rosie. It just sort of happened. In retrospect, he ought to have known that Catherine was off the table once Mary declined to name her at the hospital.
“Right,” John said. “I’m done for the moment.” He turned, starting back down the narrow path, taking care on the slick grass.
“Good,” John said. “I trust you as well.” Of course, it was a bit easier to trust Gilly, with her easy manner and her smiles and her garden-like appearance. It was like trusting a flower. There wasn’t much a flower could ever do to harm you.
A hand landed on John’s forearm, warm, gentle. Long fingers draped over the curve of his skin, a thumb stroked at his arm once, slowly. It was enough to tug his brain back from Afghanistan, but not quite enough to bring his body along. John opened his eyes and stared at Sherlock’s hand, forcing himself to breathe through his nose. His fists clenched, and he felt the muscles in his forearms tense and shake underneath Sherlock’s palm.
Memories of the night before flitted around John’s head like some sort of insect that he hadn’t yet decided was beautiful or a nuisance. He kissed Sherlock. He and Sherlock kissed. They kissed for what felt like hours, days. John’s lips felt rubbed raw. His chin burned from Sherlock’s stubble. The thing in his chest—the warm, hopeful thing—had grown large and forceful and felt as if it was blown in from the sea itself, threatening to sweep him away. He didn’t remember when they stopped kissing. He didn’t even remember falling asleep. All he remembered was being wrapped up in Sherlock, pressed closer than he’d ever been to the man, closer than he’d ever been to anyone, feeling as though his body was finally where it was meant to be.
John nodded and ascended the steps. He supposed he ought to feel sad or perhaps heartbroken. Gutted, really—it seemed as though he ought to feel gutted. He could still feel that slicing sensation in his chest, the pain of being torn open by something that was decidedly not a knife but somehow just as deadly. However, all of this felt faint, the ghost of emotion. Something somebody else was feeling, whispering to John about all of it through a canned telephone. At the moment, all John felt was exhausted. He barely had the wherewithal to slip off his trousers and crawl under the blankets.
Something flickered across Sherlock’s face, a pain that made his face twitch and his eyes shimmer. “I clearly don’t,” he said, his voice steel. With that, he turned and strode from the cottage, slamming the front door behind him.
Sherlock was already curled on the sofa, buried in John’s laptop. The clicks of the keyboard sounded slightly more forceful than strictly necessary. “I disagree,” he said.
John’s body stilled slightly. His heart was still pounding and his chest was still heaving, but Sherlock could feel things starting to slow, dip towards homeostasis. John’s head rolled towards Sherlock. A tear slipped out of the corner of his closed eye.
The beach was practically empty now, although the number of little annoyed heads poking out of the water and watching the two of them increased exponentially.
The body of one of the Taibhse Brothers—the larger man, the one John shot—was found in the boat, flopped on his belly with his gun pinned underneath him. Divers were able to recover the body of the smaller man in the Sound, the tide having carried him quite a distance from the island.
Sherlock nodded again, a fast, tight movement, and John felt Sherlock’s chest expand behind him, shuddering yet deep. Sherlock’s arm was still clenched over John’s chest.
As such, John was a bit surprised to discover that his answer had changed. Here he was, the ceiling crashing down around him and the room overrun with white light and ear-splitting noises and something or other pushing down against his body and he was almost certainly being murdered, and all he could do was scream Sherlock’s name over and over and over.
Sherlock’s expression was unreadable. “It’s quite all right,” he said, as if John had simply stepped on his foot by accident. “Is that settled, then?”
“Yeah,” John said, also realizing that he was a bit cold at the moment. “I suppose it is.” He rubbed at his arms. The temperature had taken a bit of a dip after sunset, and the wind whipping through the island certainly didn’t help.
“He’ll lose his job, of course,” Sherlock said. “Something about an employee with a penchant for lurking outside of cottage windows in the hopes of watching tenants shag isn’t particularly appealing to a rental company, it turns out.”
“I’m hogging all your pillows at the moment,” John said, pointing down at his foot. “It’s only fair that you get one too.”
“Of course I saved you,” Sherlock said. He lifted himself off John’s shoulder and grabbed at his penknife, which he had apparently tossed into the sand after he separated John’s hands from each other. He started slicing at the remaining binds on John’s wrists, ripping the ropes off him as the knife hacked through them. John flinched as the ropes peeled off his angry skin, and Sherlock scrutinized John’s wrists, examining the welts and scratches with a deep frown.
“Did you not remember?” Lestrade asked. “How could you not remember?” His eyes were wide. He looked as if he wished to crawl under a table.
They stripped themselves of their sopping, sandy clothes as soon as they made it to their cottage. Sherlock dropped the flash drive—still dangling from a tattered string—onto the table and tugged his waterlogged mobile from his pocket, shrugging at the thing as he wedged it into a bag of rice.
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s, stilling him. “Wait,” he said, gasping, very much not wanting Sherlock to stop. “We need… Do you have…?”
John was shaking his head at the ceiling. His breathing was going a bit unsteady. “Jesus Christ,” he said. “I've managed to cock everything up, haven’t I?”
Sherlock rolled his head back towards the ceiling. It was still spinning, a whirling mess of beige and gray. “The placement of the bedside table was ideal,” Sherlock said. “A perfect arm’s reach from the bed.”
“Right,” Mary said. She blinked and looked away briefly, her brain shifting, acclimating to the information. “And the two of you… That is…”
John’s mind boggled. His imagination had gone a bit wild at the thought of Sherlock thinking he was in love, flooding his mind with images of Sherlock cuddled in bed with his partner, grinning at his partner with that smile that crinkled his eyes, whispering
Claire whistled for Fitz and the group of them walked back down the slippy rocks to the dinghy. Darren’s boat—the boat they first took out to the island what felt like ages ago—sat peacefully in the waves. An older gentleman with an impressive beard sat behind the wheel, staring off at the island with a smile. A new skipper, John assumed.
.” That was, of course, assuming that Sherlock still wanted him around after, a thought that made stinging things start happening in John’s chest.
“Jesus. Sherlock.” John flapped at Sherlock’s hands, trying to shove them off so he could sit up or, at the very least, acclimate to being awake. The room was filled with light and the storm seemed to have cleared, leaving the island with a bright and chipper morning.
John felt a pang of relief shoot through him. For a moment, he considered with confusion his own reaction to their texts. His dopey smile, his elevated heart rate, the schoolgirlish way he stared at his mobile, waiting for Sherlock to respond. If John didn’t know any better, he would say they were flirting.
, he muttered, forgetting that you never told him your name. You didn’t bother to correct him. You saw the tan-line on his finger as he did up his flies, the space where a wedding ring usually sat, and you knew that you wouldn’t even be a story he told his mates. No, you were an encounter soon to be forgotten—sooner, if he had any sort of control over his own memory. To this man who had your cock in his mouth only moments before, you were the rough equivalent of a fantasy, the blur between imagination and reality. You were nothing, and that’s what you told yourself when you had a wank to the whole thing later that night.
Sherlock understood. That wasn’t just a simple shag that had happened, that was something else. To call what had happened a simple shag was to call the Mona Lisa a clever drawing, or Beethoven’s symphonies a series of catchy jingles.
Sometimes you stay for more than a pint. Sometimes a pint turns into three or four. Those are the nights you leave the barstool, looking to pull. Even three or four pints in, you can be charming, and it doesn’t hurt that you can tell who else is out searching for a good time. Drop a hint that you also happen to be open to a one-night stand or a blowjob in the loo and it’s surprising how lucky you can get. It’s not exactly fulfilling, but it’s something to do. You try not to take anyone back to your place if you can swing it, and you’ve stopped telling people your name. They just forget it half the time, and them never knowing it in the first place makes that a hell of a lot less depressing. You keep to dark places, keep your shirt on. People tend to have reactions when they see your scar. It’s a bit of a mood killer. It is, you suppose, what it is.
Sherlock sighed. He massaged his temples. “In order to lure this killer to us,” he said, “you and I will need to convince him that we are a couple.”
“It’s not meant to be,” Sherlock said, tugging John into a sweets shop, where he proceeded to swing John into his arms and declare that the smell of chocolate made him horny. John’s face burned, and he was reasonably certain he would dissolve into a pile of ash by the end of the day.
“About six kilometers from tip to tip,” Sherlock said. “A speedy hike around the island should take about three or so hours, but I want to be thorough, of course.”
“As soon as we get to Keswick,” Sherlock said, narrowly avoiding being run down by a van nearly twice the size of their rental, “you and I are a couple.”
Sherlock nodded. “Agreed.” He extended his hand and John shook it firmly. They went back to watching Rosie, who was walking slowly around the boy’s fake-dead body, looking serious and introspective.
He set Rosie’s carrier on the kitchen table, nudging aside beakers filled with god-knows-what to make space for her. “I wish you’d given me a bit of warning, Mary,” he said. “I could have been off somewhere with Sherlock.”
The water switched off and Sherlock rolled to the side, leaning his back against the wall just next to the bathroom door. He ought to move elsewhere, he knew. By all accounts, it looked a bit odd for him to be loitering just outside the loo while John bathed. Sherlock found himself not particularly caring at the moment. He pressed the back of his head against the wall, listening to the squeaks and groans of the floor as John moved about, the little splatter-drops of water leaking from the showerhead. He listened as John found a towel, rubbing the well-worn fabric over his body, his hair. John sighed, and Sherlock felt it in his chest.
“Got it. Thanks.” John waved his hand, seeing all desire he had to fix some breakfast for himself go right out the window. Even from a distance, John could tell that the photographs of the sheep were in
“And look,” John said, pointing to several other posts. “More prominent mathematicians. In agreement with
“Yes you are,” John said. “You brought treats in your pocket when we went to that client’s house who had a dog. I saw you feeding the dog the treats when you thought no one was looking. That wasn’t the first time you’ve done that, either.”
“I prefer cadavers,” Sherlock said. “Stakes are lower.” He wove another suture through the wound, doing his best not to flinch as the needle popped through John’s skin. John was breathing steadily above him—forceful, slow exhales out his nose and muttered curses out his lips. The toilet roll was well and shredded by this point, but Sherlock figured it to be an acceptable sacrifice, all things considered.
“No,” the woman said. She looked properly terrified by John’s sudden appearance, which John figured she was well within her rights to be. She scurried away just as John ran over to a man waiting to cross the street.
Sherlock padded down the stairs. His flies were open, and he was still buttoning a shirt over his bare chest. “Problem?” he asked.
Mrs. Hudson chuckled, her gaze darting to John. John grinned at her. They both enjoyed it when Sherlock was like this—grinning and energetic and not madly digging through Mrs. Hudson’s drawers in search of his revolver.
Mary’s lips lifted in a little half-smile. “I’ll be fine, John,” she said. “I have plenty of experience in these matters.”
, for that matter. They manage to complete their robberies without a single scrap of eyewitness evidence. They famously robbed three petrol stations all on the same day, all in broad daylight, all without any witnesses or CCTV evidence. It was as if they were ghosts. Hence the moniker—the
…” He grabbed a piece of wood from the pile beside the fireplace and started digging at it with his fingernails. “These things I’ve done to hurt you, I’ll never do them again. I promise. But I’ll still hurt you. I won’t want to, but I’ll find some way to hurt you. It’s how I am.” The wood cracked as his fingers dug into the thick bark. “It’s best that you leave.”
working, and it wasn’t even a real apology. John found his hands on Sherlock’s hips, rubbing gently. “We act like an old married couple?” He grinned.
“Yeah,” said John, wiggling his toes with a wince. “Nothing snapped. Nothing’s misshapen. No numbness.” He touched at the swollen flesh of his ankle, flinching as his fingers touched skin. “Just a sprain.” He lay back on the bed, hands running over his face. He was still a touch out of breath, exhausted from the climb up the stairs. “Ice and elevation. And meds. Whatever we’ve got.”
“For the record,” John said. “And I know it’s not the same. But I was lonely too, you know. After you… When you were dead.”
And John went hard. The sound of his hips slapping against Sherlock’s arse filled the flat and Sherlock’s hands scrambled on the sheets, searching for something to brace himself. He sounded like he was dying, like John was murdering him here in their bed, but John knew better.
“Start the sutures a little back from the edge of the wound,” John said. His voice was rough, his teeth clenched. Sherlock lowered the needle to his skin and John nodded. “Good. You won’t need to push too hard. The needle is sharp enough, it’ll do all the work.”
John nodded, beginning to crawl towards the door. Sherlock’s hand darted out, catching John’s wrist.
John shifted, trying to cross his legs but slipping down in the tub and nearly drowning himself again instead. “Just a little hard to focus when I’m naked,” he said.
“Are you saying that because we…” John gestured between the two of them. “Are you saying it because you think that’s what people are supposed to say after they…”
He pulls away and you nearly go reeling. Your vision feels blurred. He’s out of his chair and moving, walking to the back of the pub. Towards the water closets. He throws you a look over his shoulder.
Sherlock for John to figure that one out. He kept his old mobile—he couldn’t bear to part with it, couldn’t delete a single text from Sherlock—but turned it off and stored it away in a closet, for fear it might ring. Other bits were unpredictable. He couldn’t eat dim sum anymore; he learned that the hard way after nearly choking on his tears over a dumpling. Riding in cabs was oddly treacherous; he could never predict when a cabbie might turn down a street that inexplicably reminded him of Sherlock and he’d be tamping down tears in the back of a bloody taxi. He started taking the tube. And then, of course, there was the striped jumper. Into the bin with that. The whole of it was enough to make him realize that Sherlock had painted across his life in broad strokes, managing to work splashes of his unique color into nearly everything John found familiar. When Sherlock was alive, the world had been breathtaking. Once he was gone the colors only hurt John’s eyes.
Angelo leaned in close, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Just say the word, and whatever it is,” his face grew serious, “I’ll handle it.”
“I—” John started, but every thought he had in his brain evaporated instantaneously because Sherlock’s mouth was pressed to his neck. As promised, Sherlock wasn’t kissing him, not exactly, but John could feel the softness of Sherlock’s lips against his skin and the warmth of his breath tickling his jaw and the lone thought in his head was that this was physically the closest he and Sherlock had ever been and it wasn’t exactly unpleasant. It was actually quite far from unpleasant.
“Um. No,” John said. “I didn’t know that.” His brain was spinning a bit, and his cock seemed to be listening intently. “So. Are you...wearing pants? Right now?”
John laughed, the nails falling from his mouth, and he figured that his argument about not going in for
John swiped at the wound again with  a bit of saline-drenched gauze. He pressed a piece of dry gauze just over the wound, securing it in place with plasters.
“I know,” John said. “I just like to hear you explain it all out. All your little deductions, all in a row.”
—your scar. It’s an on-and-off of sensations, a mix of warm and nothing and wet and tingling, and nobody, not a single person has ever done this before. Most people go out of their way to avoid even touching it. The last person who saw it, you had to fuck her from behind so she would stop looking at the thing with that terrible expression on her face. And now his mouth is on it like he’s trying to make it a part of himself too.
Sherlock was busy wedging the flat end of a screwdriver between two floorboards. He made a little humming noise.
“That flashdrive,” he said. “The one you gave me, with your initials on it. Was there ever anything on it?”
“Do try not to faint from the shock,” Sherlock said, his hands still placid on the steering wheel, eyes on the road. “We’re making good time and I’d hate to have to pull over to revive you.”
In retrospect, it was apparent that Wiggins had mixed something different into his concoction, something that took all the bones out of Sherlock’s limbs and replaced them with water. Not that it mattered. He wasn’t going anywhere and he couldn’t even smell the piss on his mattress anymore. Everything was fine. There was absolutely no reason to panic.
, that was the grounds for divorce the two decided upon, the one that made the most sense for them and would get them divorced in the shortest amount of time. John read through the little paragraphs of behaviors Mary listed, the facts that they intended to present before the court, the cracks that broke their marriage to pieces—objective truths that carved a frown onto John’s face. He didn’t like any of it, but he agreed with all of it.
Sometime in the night, he and Sherlock wrapped themselves up in each other. Sherlock’s arms wound around him,
“Thirteen,” John said. His hips wriggled a bit at Sherlock’s touch. His fingers tangled in the sheets. “Good guess.”
“I’m reasonably certain I know what I feel, John,” Sherlock said. He swallowed. “I ought to have told you sooner. I only recently figured it out myself.”
“Three bullets,” Sherlock said. “Three gunmen. Three victims. That’s what he said. He had snipers—Moriarty—ready to fire. The three of you would die—Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and…” he swallowed, “and you. You would die. Unless I jumped.”
“—And if you tell me that Sherlock doesn’t go for relationships,” she said, “I swear to god I will stay married to you out of sheer spite.”
That, of course, would all be ill-advised. Sherlock wasn’t John’s to wrap his arms around, and all physical touch the two of them shared this week would be all for show, to lure in the Holiday Killer. It would all mean nothing in the end. So instead, he lay on his back in bed—still as a statue—with his arms propped under his head, where they would be completely safe.
“The next time a restaurant we like is involved in some sort of money laundering scheme,” Sherlock said, “I’m allowed to turn a blind eye. And you?”
John stayed standing where he was for just a minute, stiff as a board and vibrating at the edges. Then he sunk into one of the kitchen chairs, all his energy focused on calming his breathing. The whole of his body was hot and shaking, and he felt the sick, angry tears needling away at his eyes. He had absolutely no idea how the two of them had gotten there, how waking up in each other’s arms transformed into the two of them shouting at each other in a matter of minutes. And about what? About John not being a convincing enough fake boyfriend? A convincing enough boyfriend in general?
Sherlock collapsed against the mattress, forehead pressed against his arm. He was lying in his own come, but he didn’t care. He tried to steady his breathing with gulping gasps. The air of the room was cold on his slick skin. Goosepimples arose on his body and he shuddered once more. His breathing slowly stilled, body returning to homeostasis, and the flat fell back into a silence that only served to highlight the lack of life that surrounded Sherlock at the moment. He heaved out another breath just to fill the room with a sound.
“Why are you doing all this, Sherlock?” John asked, eyes still on Sherlock’s arm. “Helping out so much. Not that I don’t appreciate it, it’s just… You aren’t obligated to do any of it.”
The shooter flopped to the side and grabbed at his gun, but Sherlock fired another shot, spraying into the dirt just at the shooter’s side. The man scrambled to his feet, clutching his shoulder as he darted away from the house.
He blinked, his eyes warring against their sudden use. He didn’t remember falling asleep, didn’t even remember feeling sleepy, but apparently had fallen into something akin to a coma, deep and motionless, that spanned the entirety of the night. His brain was struggling to emerge from said coma, sluggishly shuffling through the data Sherlock’s tired eyes sent in and trying to make sense of it all.
John sighed. He rubbed at his eyes. “Do you think I could have been happy?” John asked. “If I stayed? If I tried to work it out? If I’d just…”
Sherlock tugged John away from the doorway. He needed John away from the stairs, away from the door, away from any route he could possibly take to leave the flat, leave Baker Street, leave Sherlock. Sherlock swung the both of them around and shoved John into the kitchen. John’s arse bumped against the kitchen table and several beakers toppled to the ground, shattering into shards.
Sherlock had been in a category-five strop for the past three days. His mood was abysmal even by Sherlock's standards, and he took out his frustration on whoever was around—John, Mrs. Hudson, and even once an unfortunately timed postman. John had long since asked Mrs. Hudson to hide Sherlock's revolver away, but Sherlock managed to find other ways to be destructive—scattering body parts about the flat, screaming at the telly about incorrect facts reported during a nature documentary, nearly peeling the wallpaper off the kitchen walls after some half-cocked experiment went poorly. Sherlock needed a case. Badly.
You consider. He has a point. It’s nearly one in the morning and neither of you have eaten anything all day. A bit of food might be advisable, especially since one of you was recently in a bit of a fight.
“Anything I can do to bolster the realism,” John said. He chuckled, shaking his head. “Sherlock Holmes, a good boyfriend. Who would have thought?”
John cleared his throat and turned back to Mary. The look of surprise was long gone from her face. “I’m sorry, Mary,” he said. “I really am.”
With a low grunt, John shifted off of Sherlock and lifted himself from the sofa, stretching his arms over his head, the bones in his back cracking, a disadvantage of walking upright. He turned back to Sherlock and reached out a hand to him. Sherlock grasped his hand—opposable thumbs, how useful—and John heaved him off the sofa, pulling him into standing. Sherlock’s feet shifted on the floor, feeling out his balance. His legs lodged a brief complaint at the sudden call to action and his head swum, little dots dancing in front of his eyes as his blood rearranged itself to acclimate to the sudden change in position. Standing upright was a momentous task. Sherlock blinked and after a moment the dots faded and his legs strengthened. He wriggled his toes. He was a regular bipedal creature—very advantageous for terrestrial living.
. For our purposes, however, I believe Declan is referring to the Taibhse Brothers.” He slid a finger along the journal—still sitting in John’s lap—as he read.
“I…” Sherlock swallowed. “Is that… That is, are you…?” He swallowed again. He had never felt less articulate in his life. “Do you want me to?”
Sherlock crouched by the fireplace but didn’t appear to be doing very much of anything. He stared into the cold ashes, hands hanging limp over his knees. “You ought to leave,” he said.
Sherlock wasn’t downstairs, and a quick poke of John’s head out the back door told him that Sherlock wasn’t in the loo either. His coat was gone, however. Must be off exploring the island some more, John figured. Given the size of the island, at least he couldn’t have gotten very far. After what was arguably one of the fastest and coldest showers of John’s life, he dressed, shoved a piece of stale bread and some jam in his mouth, and threw on his jacket. Time to go find wherever Sherlock ran off to.
John shook his head, his eyes dropping back down to Sherlock’s chest as he finished cleaning the wound. “It’s not,” he said. “It’s really not.”
The next day, a group of them were playing tag outside of school. The boy—the one the cat apparently liked more than John—was with them and John ran full-force into him, shoving him to the ground with a two-handed push that surprised even him. The boy hit the ground with a thud and skidded across the pavement, scraping his elbow.
Sherlock hopped onto the bed beside John, shaking the whole of the mattress as his knees hit. Fitz looked up from his gnawed wood with a flash of irritation that was quickly forgotten. His tail gave a thump and he returned to chewing on the wood. Sherlock settled himself close to John, peering over his shoulder as he read.
An hour or so later, John heard the scrape of wheels in the driveway and nearly leapt out of his seat. He was still on the same page in his novel as he was an hour before, but he had managed to send Sherlock a series of what could clearly be interpreted as increasingly desperate texts. Dashing to the door upon hearing Sherlock return didn’t exactly make John look any less desperate, but he couldn’t be arsed to care at the moment.
Thankfully, Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. “I’ve already called the surgery for you,” he said. “Told them you needed to take a few days off.”
In Mary’s tiny cottage, on some freezing corner of an island off the coast of Finland, explosives were detonating.
“God yes,” John whispered against his mouth, and Sherlock could hear the hunger there as well, the need that turned to an ache. John brought his hands to Sherlock’s hips, fingers sinking into skin, urging him faster, harder. Sherlock complied, moving against John with fervor, their bodies sliding together in the sheen of sweat that had formed between them. John’s mouth was open and wet and he was panting into Sherlock’s mouth, each breath coming with a whimper, a little plea for more. John’s hands slipped lower, running along Sherlock’s arse, scratching into soft skin. His fingers slipped into the cleft of Sherlock’s arse and Sherlock felt his whole body throb. He heard himself moan against John, a noise he wasn’t certain he had ever made before. He slipped his legs open, straddling John’s thighs as he lay atop him, opening himself wider for John to explore.
nature of such a sentiment, but he felt his cock give a twitch. His eyes dropped to half-mast as Sherlock dipped lower in front of him, kissing at the bruising along his chest. John wound his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, cold and damp and sandy. A gust of wind blew the rain against the window.
You stumble onto the stool next to him. “What the hell are you doing here?” you ask. Rude, perhaps, but then the man did recently abandon you in some alleyway after tailing a person who may or may not have been a bank robber, so you feel you’re due a little rudeness.
“Now that you’ve got a better grasp on the context,” the man said, “here’s what we’re going to do. Just to the side of the harbor, there’s a little rock outcrop. You’re going to climb down onto it. You’re going to bring the flash drive. We’re going to bring our boat over, and you’re going to give us the flash drive. Understood?”
Strictly speaking, John wasn’t supposed to enter the building, it being condemned and all. However, he didn’t quite see the point of taking a cab all the way out to Brixton just to loiter outside. Besides, the door was made of plywood and already broken in half, so John figured to call what he was doing
So the paramedics patched John up and allowed him to remain at the flat. They checked Sherlock over as well, although his injuries were superficial in nature—a few bruises and scratches. They treated the rope burns on both of their wrists. After each of them had been medically cleared and thoroughly questioned and John’s bedroom had been searched and photographed within an inch of its life, the police departed, leaving the three of them in the silence of the flat. Sherlock insisted that Lestrade stay behind for a few moments to converse about Hugh and what Sherlock hoped was a fairly speedy release from custody. The two of them chatted outside the flat while John and Mrs. Hudson went back inside.
You can’t get him out of your bloody thoughts. Your body is a mess of sparking nerve endings and fireflies. You’re light and jittery and
Breathing still hurt a bit, but John figured that there were a few different contributions to that difficulty at the moment. “No,” he said. “I’m fine.”
“Besides,” Sherlock said. “I died right there.” He pointed across the street to the spot where the street-preacher was still waving his Bible and waiting for nothing. “A bit morbid to hang around here all afternoon, don’t you think?”
John stood in front of the flat as the cab pulled away, bracing himself for the hell he had in store. The lights were out in the flat—Mary must be asleep. He thought he might wake her, go ahead and get this mess over with. Besides, it might be better to do this with Rosie asleep, so that they wouldn’t have to worry about fighting in front of her.
It might have been a shift in the tide, but Sherlock’s head lolled to the side to point at John. John looked concerned but not overly so; he had studied Sherlock’s evolutionary progression before and was becoming something of an expert. John was wearing a dark jumper and a pair of faded jeans that the Sherlock who used to have a frontal lobe would know were over a decade old apiece, but at the moment looked much smarter than Sherlock, whose non-body was covered in the same pyjamas and dressing gown he had been wearing for four billion years. Clothes weren’t particularly meaningful for Sherlock’s state, and changing them was even less meaningful.
.” He pulled at the fabric hard enough to yank John’s hips forward. “Why are you always wearing so many
John exhaled, and his breath was already shaking. “And if I did?” he asked. “Want it, that is?” He felt a tremor run through Sherlock’s body. Sherlock’s arms tightened around him and a puff of air—small, gasped—drifted over John’s neck. And if John shifted back ever so slightly he could feel it—Sherlock’s cock stirring against him, pressing against his arse. “What then?”
The head-lamp dropped into the grass. Sherlock was standing in front of John now, looming over him, his eyes black pits that bore into John’s. “I am uninhabitable,” he said. His voice was low, slipping into John’s skin and wrapping around his bones. “I will break you. Toss you to the sea.”
“I don’t see him anymore,” Sherlock said. He peered up at the mountain, brows furrowed. He crawled further down the path, then circled back, hands and knees. “He didn’t continue down this way. He didn’t go up the mountain. He…” Sherlock’s gaze landed on the cliffs and in a moment he was on his feet again, striding towards the edge of the island, the spot where the long grass sloped sharply until the land gave way to nothingness.
you still went into the loo with him. He half-arsed a toothy blowjob through a condom and you barely forced your way to an orgasm—picturing yourself anywhere but where you were—before he stood up and gave himself a quick wank against you, thankfully managing to spill his load against the wall instead of your trousers.
He blinks at you for a moment, as if not expecting any sort of compliment. He recovers quickly. “It’s not a trick,” he says. He takes off back down the street at his earlier rapid pace, his head swinging around, looking for something.
Mary’s eyes widened and her laugh rang through the room like a gunshot. John felt the sound poke at what was left of his headache.
John took several deep breaths before he could trust himself to respond. “Yes,” he said. “That’s what I’m saying.”
Sherlock steered John towards the telly, pushing him down onto Sherlock’s chair with a two-handed grip on his shoulders. “There is so much more to it than just the three doors, John,” he said.
John disappeared into the loo and returned with his medical bag tucked under his arm and a bottle of painkillers that Sherlock knew he meticulously counted every day, despite Sherlock’s assertions that he had no intentions of becoming addicted to the things anytime soon. John set his bag on the kitchen table and shook the pills out into his hand.
His face has changed. He’s staring at you with a hazy fascination. His lips are slightly parted and they look like just the sort of thing you’d love to dive into. You trace your fingers along the edges of his mouth.
loads of them, the majority of which were idiotic and unnecessary. It was a lot, and it was all set to the backdrop of the ever-flashing bulbs of cameras of what appeared to be every reporter in London. Everyone loves a good explosion, Sherlock figured, although there was a bit more to be said for being on the outside looking in rather than the other way around. John was at his side for much of the evening. Sherlock wished him closer.
“The effects of Rohypnol wear off after a few hours,” Sherlock said. “I’ve been physically safe for some time.”
is interesting.” He slid forward on the table, moving closer to John. Sherlock’s knees were on either side of John’s crossed legs, effectively bracketing him in. John shifted, uncrossing his legs, doing his best not to think about how their thighs were nearly touching.
It was either very late at night or very early in the morning, depending on how one looked at the matter. Sherlock didn’t much care how one looked at the matter. He was tired of looking. He had spent much of the trip feeling frozen, a block of ice. Being frozen took effort. Sherlock was running low on effort.
John shifted his bag on his shoulder and started to follow Claire. Sherlock remained planted where he was, standing squarely in front of the beehive. He had set his bag on the ground and gazed placidly upon the domed structure, hands in his pockets, seemingly entranced by the thing. His eyes looked alive, the look he got when his brain was rattling through deductions at the speed of light. He had a little smile on his face.
“Wrong,” he says. “I’ve wanted you inside me since I first saw you.” He writhes against your hand. He sinks his nails into your scalp, pulling you in. He bites at your lip. “And you still aren’t fucking me,” he says.
Sherlock’s sour glare hit him in the side of his face. Sherlock’s moods today seemed particularly changeable. John hoped this wasn’t foreshadowing for the whole of the trip, especially since it would be just the two of them for an unknown length of time. Trapped on an island with a moody Sherlock seemed the perfect recipe for grueling days.
The room was alive with sound. The mattress was screaming, antique springs giving out the last of their lives to squeak and growl beneath John’s knees, each movement louder than the one before. The headboard slammed into the wall, rattling beneath John’s hands, little flecks of plaster and dust taking to the air. And then there was John, howling and cursing and shouting disjointed commands—
Hugh started towards the front door and Sherlock released John, grabbing instead for his hand and interlacing their fingers. He leaned in close to John’s ear, his lips nearly grazing John’s skin.
“Mrs. Hudson might have a thing or two to say about that,” Sherlock replied. He nudged John’s shoulder.
Petrol attendants all up the highway confirmed that they had seen Mary—she was back to blond hair here, but wore it longer. Still a wig, John supposed. The time at which they reported seeing her seemed to get closer and closer. They weren’t missing her by days anymore; they seemed to be right on her tail.
In retrospect, John never explicitly told Mary that he was moving back to Baker Street, and she never asked. They both knew that was where he was heading, like some sort of unspoken truth. Hell, John barely had to tell
The woman seemed hesitant suddenly. “I fear you won’t believe me. You, humans, are so skeptical of everything.”
“I guess we’ll wait and see…” John murmured, “What do you think, Sherlock?” He looked around the room sadly. John tried to imagine what Sherlock would say:
John wanted to look, but he kept his eyes closed as she had instructed. “Within the next few moments, you will experience time travel. Are you ready, John?”
John glanced away briefly with a small shrug. He was tired of hearing that question. He wasn’t doing good, but he didn’t want to admit that. Lestrade seemed to get the hint and gestured to the park bench to the left. John nodded curtly as they both sat, staring out at the park before them. Birds chirped mindlessly in the trees around them and people passed by laughing or talking between each other. The world seemed to continue on and on despite one of the most important people in John’s life no longer being there. John felt an intense bitterness and anger toward the world suddenly. How dare everyone continue on normally as if Sherlock Holmes never existed. How dare the world continue when it lost the most brilliant human to ever exist. John’s eyes fell to his hands that were clasped in his lap.
“Don’t think too hard about it, you’ll only hurt yourself.” The woman advised and John looked at her like she was crazy. “Just, imagine the plate of biscuits, will you?”
Feeling a bit better after running into Lestrade, John stuffed his hands in his coat pockets. He was staring off to the right at a couple of kids who were chasing the ducks and trying to feed them. He smiled at the kids who were laughing when someone collided harshly with him. He stumbled backward a little as well as the other person and when he looked forward, seeing who it was, his eyes widened.
“In simpler terms, you will have all the knowledge you contain now, that means you will know how every case goes if you remember them fully, you will know Sherlock’s death is approaching, you will have the knowledge that you have experienced up until this point, but as John Watson in the past. You will most likely experience an insane amount of, as you humans call it, Deja Vu.”
“Don’t think too hard about it,” She said, “I know it is difficult to understand, but it is easier to take my word for it.”
When John finally felt a little calmer, he peeked up at the woman. She was no longer holding the plate of biscuits, the plate was nowhere in sight. John swallowed uneasily. “Okay.” He mumbled, “Okay.”
“It seems complicated and probably a bit overwhelming if you think about it too closely, but people make choices every single day of their lives, some as simple as choosing where to eat for lunch.”
“Yes. It somehow got a bit popular.” John smiled sadly. He had not written a thing on the blog since Sherlock’s death, nor was he thinking about it anytime soon.
tied with human fate and their destiny,” She started to explain, “You see, Sherlock was not destined to die that day on the roof just as you are not destined to live on without him.”
. He wasn’t going to miraculously come back from the dead as John had been secretly hoping for the past six months. John felt like collapsing to his knees, but he held steady and exhaled softly at the news.
Destiny released a breath as if she had been holding it in. Had she thought he would refuse? “Good.” She murmured after a moment. “I’m going to take us out of your memories now that we’re on the same page.”
They began walking for a while through long corridors that John recognized from Bart’s hospital. They walked through another door and came back to 221B, except it looked to be like she was showing him another memory. It was a simpler memory than his first meeting with Sherlock. This memory contained a calm afternoon between Sherlock and himself. ‘Memory John’ was sitting at the table in the common area, typing away at his laptop, and ‘Memory Sherlock’ was sitting at the kitchen table creating some horrible mess of an experiment.
“I’m allowed to do that?” John raised a questioning eyebrow. Destiny chuckled and nodded. John thought about it for a moment, “My laptop?”
“I need to sit down.” John murmured and sat down in his ‘mind’ chair that looked exactly like the chair in the flat. He put his head in his hands for a moment, trying to stop his spiraling thoughts. The woman was, thankfully, quiet for a moment.
“Ding, ding, ding! Correct!” The woman exclaimed, clapping her hands, “Except yours is more of a…” She glanced around, “mind flat. A replica of your current flat, hm. Interesting.” She was murmuring to herself now as the cogs in John’s brain continued to turn and then click.
Mycroft, surprisingly, helped John throughout the first few months of Sherlock’s death. Even now the man helped John and the two became weirdly familiar with one another and formed an unusual friendship despite neither meaning for it to happen. Mycroft helped cover John’s bills, so John was able to take time off from the surgery. He didn’t know when he would return. Grieving was an undeniably long process people had to go through and he was glad to have the extra support from Mycroft so he wouldn’t have to worry financially. The surgery, of course, told him to take as long as he needed and John was thankful for it. John knew he would return in the coming month as he knew Mycroft would not continue paying his bills forever. His therapist also thought it to be a good idea for him to return to working to have a sense of normalcy and routine or to simply get him out of the flat.
Destiny smiled as she shook his hand. “I’m pleased to hear. If you don’t have any more questions at this time, I need to start preparing immediately and I need you to get all the rest you can get, preferably starting now. Time travel is exhausting and you will need all the strength you can manage.” Destiny headed toward the door, her red heels clicking against the floorboards.
“Just let me…” John felt a little embarrassed, but he stepped passed her and over to Memory Sherlock sitting at the table. Destiny watched from her spot near the door, a curious tilt to her head.
“Yes. Multiple timelines can exist depending on the choices of humankind. A human can have two roads with two choices, the human can decide which road to take and the timeline will alter slightly, depending on the choice.”
“Like...go back in time and redo everything. Figure out what you could’ve done to save him? Give him more cases, talk to him more…” Lestrade trailed off. John’s heart gave a small pang.
“There have been many different scenarios. You two could have met at a University or on the tube ride home from work. There was even a slim chance of you two meeting during your time at war.” She explained before her eyes drifted to the memory scene playing out in front of them, “The scenario you lived is my personal favorite. It’s just so…interestingly sweet how he tries to impress you upon first glance, don’t you think?”
“Sherlock’s death created a huge anomaly in the system that altered the original timeline so badly that it created a separate timeline from itself, thus where we are currently.”
John didn’t know when he had fallen asleep, but he was soon woken by someone gently shaking him. He jolted, startled from his sleep. Through the darkness of the room, his eyes adjusted to see a familiar face there. Destiny’s eyes pierced him through the darkness of the room.
“We should hang out again soon.” Lestrade said and pulled John in for a tight hug, “Call me if you need me and don't be a stranger.”
“There is no meaning.” She said simply and in a matter-of-factly type of voice, “It’s just how it has been written. I don’t make the rules.”
John’s brows knit together in both concern and a bit of dread. That was a lot of pressure, but if it meant bringing Sherlock back, John didn’t think he had it anywhere in him to refuse such a deal.
“Please, I insist,” John said as he grabbed the paper cup of the coffee and discarded it in the nearby trash bin.
John opened his eyes. They were standing in the middle of 221B. John frowned in confusion. This lady was making a fool out of him, wasn’t she? He sure felt like one. But, hadn’t he been sitting? He didn’t remember standing up. John glanced around, everything looked the same and felt the same.
The woman was staring at him now, but John didn’t care. She had a sad look in her strange eyes, but John didn’t care. He didn’t care about her pity or anyone else’s pity. He never wanted to leave this place if it meant he could stay here with Memory Sherlock.
John paused and shook his head, swallowing the lump in his throat that promised him tears. All he could do was keep Sherlock’s memory alive. John exhaled shakily. He closed his eyes for a moment before he opened them again, feeling a little calmer. He was about to continue walking when he heard someone call out his name.
Except, John was not accustomed to normalcy. Not when he used to live with Sherlock Holmes, the most eccentric, unique, adrenaline chasing junkie of a man he’d ever met. No, there was no “
“A part of me keeps thinking and hoping it's just one of his games or brilliant plans.” Lestrade continued, “I find myself waiting for him to waltz into Scotland Yard, ready to rail me about giving him a case.” Lestrade smiled sadly and glanced away from John, who could see the tears that pricked Lestrade’s eyes.
“Your name.” The woman was speaking to him now, her strange eyes locked on his own. John fumbled for a moment as they stepped to the side to wait for their coffee.
Destiny pursed her lips at the slight mockery, but she ignored it and opted for explaining instead, “I plan to send you back in time. I can’t personally meddle with human choices and their variables, but I can...influence them to an extent, so that is why I need you. As a human, you are not bound by any laws of my world, you’re allowed to change your mind and alter things in a way that suits you, therefore you can set the timeline back on course.”
“Of course. Time travel is not an easy task to complete. It requires preparation and precise calculations.”
Destiny was quiet for a moment, but when she spoke, John could hear a smile in her voice, “Most definitely. You won’t be alone in this.”
“If you could change the fate of Sherlock Holmes, would you or would you not?” She questioned again, her stare locked onto him. The way she said the words had John’s hair standing on end and a prickly feeling crawling up his back. He turned a little to face her fully. He searched her eyes, but he didn’t see any malice or mockery in them.
The woman smiled again, her cherry red lips glistening. They walked in silence for a while, sipping on their respective coffee and watching the cars rumble by. John was still trying to figure out when to part ways with the woman. They were nearing 221B soon. They continued in silence and it wasn’t long before John stopped in front of the black door of 221B. The woman stopped with him.
“You’re the only one I can use to help me,” Destiny explained, “You’re the closest to Sherlock. It is only logical to use you to figure out what the variable is.”
John sighed and closed his eyes again, he imagined a glass plate with some of Mrs. Hudson’s fresh biscuits on it, like the one he had the day prior. He opened his eyes again and glanced around.
“You and Sherlock Holmes are one of the only two pairs of people in the entire world that have been destined to meet no matter the circumstances.”
“213 days, 24 hours, 59 minutes, and 58 seconds,” John mumbled to himself. “Interesting.” He huffed out a laugh in disbelief. He made it.
Destiny placed her hands in her lap, “Yes, more or less. I oversee destiny and the fate of humankind to put it simply. Hence my name. I ensure that people’s destinies are fulfilled and aim to study anomalies in the system unless they deviate to the point of creating another timeline that is not supposed to exist, which has never happened...
“Dreadful what happened to him, isn’t it?” The woman mumbled carefully, her eyes briefly glancing at John as if gauging his reaction.
. Look what you’re putting me through now.” John whispered to Memory Sherlock even though he knew this Sherlock didn’t technically exist. “You wait for me, you hear?” John commanded in a soft voice. His cheeks felt tight from the drying tears, so he wiped his face with the sleeve of his jacket. He inhaled and released a soft sigh.
John stared at Sherlock from the side as his other self commented on the layout of the room. Something along the lines of “a bit different from my day.”
John shut his eyes and tried to get himself to sleep. After about thirty minutes of trying, he sat up, frustrated. How could he sleep with all the information Destiny gave him? How was he supposed to sleep and drift off into dreamland when the possibility of saving his best friend from death was just on the horizon? John felt restless suddenly.
John felt his throat tighten and he swallowed thickly as he watched the memory. The woman was quiet next to him, watching as well. John couldn’t help the tears that pricked the corners of his eyes. The woman glanced at him before directing her gaze down as she brushed invisible dust off her dress.
When she hung up abruptly, John felt like an idiot. He stared at his phone in disbelief. This lady had to be playing him somehow, he just didn’t know how.
“Yes, John Watson, I swear I’ve heard it somewhere before. Have you been on the news or something lately? Or maybe something I’ve seen on the web?” The woman pondered, not so much directing the questions at him. John hesitated for a moment before saying,
So I think I may upload a chapter every time I finish a chapter. For example, I almost have chapter 3 fully written, so that is why I'm uploading chapter 2 now and so when I finish writing chapter 4 I'll upload chapter 3. Does that make sense? Well, it does for me and helps me to continue writing consistently rather than floundering about not uploading.
John stared at it, trying to understand why the woman (well he assumed it was her) had given it to him. She clearly wasn’t interested in dating him, or at least, he didn’t think so. She’d been so
