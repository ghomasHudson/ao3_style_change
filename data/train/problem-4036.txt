Cas hums, brow furrowed, only half listening. He glances up briefly, replying, "It's a green light, Dean," before looking back down at the map. Dean smiles like an idiot to himself for the next five miles.
Castiel tastes something bitter in his mouth at the word
A hand rests on his knee, and when Dean opens his eyes Castiel is leaning back in his chair, eyes on him. “Tired, Dean?”
Dean reaches up then to cradle Castiel’s face in his hands delicately. Castiel is unperturbed by the blood, instead meeting Dean’s gaze with his own sleepy, blown out one.
Naomi pauses. Then, she says,
He wants so badly it wraps around his grace and strains against his vessel's rib cage and tries to push its way out, towards Dean.
"That can't be right," Dean says. "Over a hundred?"
“Castiel.”
Castiel, for all of his fury and power, is an angel of simple decisions. And despite him vanishing from the brothers' view, he still keeps an eye on them. He can’t put a reason to it; he came to the decision sometime between the first time he met Dean, and the time Dean prayed to him from the Impala, and he’s going to stick to it. He is aware that Dean probably hates him, and Sam is too concerned with his brother’s happiness to bother him about bringing Castiel back, not when Dean sounded so adamant about killing Castiel if he saw him again. But Dean’s hatred doesn’t impact Castiel’s decision.
He comes to in the dark. He can’t see anything, only what seems to be the moonlight filtering just barely into the room- just enough he can make out the vague shape of furniture, but nothing else. He blinks a few times, sorting out the stiffness of the chair he was tied to and the throb of his head from being knocked out.
It is a clear dismissal. Castiel doesn’t push it- this is more than he’s gotten from Dean in months. He disappears from the car, watches from the shadows how the moment he’s gone Dean lets the rest of his tears flow freely, like he was just barely keeping them in.
Dean looks grumpily at the burnt dish before turning in Heaven Castiel’s arms. “That’s not the point, though. The art of cooking it is as important as the end result.”
His hand falls back down to his side, and just like that he slips back into unconsciousness, almost like he was asleep the entire time.
Castiel has to swallow down something that forms in his throat. He takes in the look Dean is giving the Heaven version of himself, that same unidentified emotion that he so often looked at Castiel with in life. He is hit with the terribly overwhelming, undeniable realization of what that emotion is. Love. That emotion Dean has been looking at since he met him has been love.
They stare at each other, perfectly still in the darkness. The darkness presses in on Dean’s eyes, and he can’t make anything else out other than the eyes. They’re blue, he thinks.
“It’s a war between Heaven and Hell,” Castiel closes his eyes, tries not to think of Michael using Dean’s body- the body that Castiel had so carefully and
To their right, a portly hunter with a beard and the wrinkles of someone who's been in the business longer than Elijah's been alive leans towards them, loudly sloshing his beer as he gets in their space.
There is silence. Meg’s hand squeezes his thigh again, her fingers trembling ever so slightly, and he pulls her between his knees with an arm around her waist. Castiel pours himself another glass of wine.
“Killing him wasn’t part of the plan!” Castiel snaps. He presses the hand that isn’t holding Dean up against the wound, but it does nothing, his grace charging up and dying feebly. He can’t heal an angel blade wound and both he and Zachariah know it.
, loudly thumping against his ribcage like the wings of a hummingbird trying to escape. He stares at Castiel, eyes enormous. By his side, his hands tremble.
After about fifteen minutes of driving in silence, Dean clears his throat. Castiel, who is watching him intently, recognizes he is about to be called upon seconds before Dean tentatively says, “Cas?”
“I am Castiel,” Castiel replies, calmly. “I’m here to speak with Dean Winchester.”
“Alright,” Castiel murmurs. Dean looks surprised at his easy agreement, but Castiel doesn’t stay long enough for him to say anything else. He meets Dean’s gaze, taking in that galaxy of green one last time, and smiles as best he can in an unthreatening manner. “We’ll meet again soon, Dean.”
The hunter scowls at him. "We didn't come here to hear about your weird kinks with your fag boyfriend-" He starts to say, but he never finishes his sentence. The man in the trench coat, Cas, lunges forward so fast Elijah doesn't even see him move- one minute the hunter is talking, and the next he's on his ass on the ground, blood pouring from his nose, Cas looming over him with a dark fury on his face.
He decides to grow up the slow way this time. He decides to be too short to reach the sink without a stool, too uncoordinated to write his name neatly. He decides to use a nightlight and learn to ride a bike and paint messy watercolors of Daddy, Papa, and Tatti in kindergarten. He decides to let Dean sing him old Zeppelin songs to make him sleep when he's cranky, to let Sam lift him on his shoulders to tower high above the world. He decides to curl up on Castiel's lap to read 'The Little Prince.' He decides to let Claire paint his nails and dress him like a doll and sneak him pieces of nougat.
“I can help.” Dean says, glaring at his brother. Who the hell does Sam think he is, anyway?
"Would... would it be okay if I was four years old now?"
Sam scoffed, shocked.
“How simple it is to create chaos with a twist of one’s wrist. There are trillions of ways to twist this cube away from its original state. Quintillions, even.”
Cas’ face is like stone, but he lays down all of his seed packets and his potted plants with out complaint. He even thanks the cashier by name when she finishes ringing them up and bagging their items for them. They return to the car in silence, packing the grocery bags into Baby’s back seat. The silence remains as Dean puts the car in drive, as he drives out of town. Cas stares down at his hands, and Dean keeps swiping at his lips, thinking longingly of the beer he’d left behind. He’s supposed to be past this. He thinks about how he and Cas had spent this morning tangled together, floating on a cloud of their own happiness. He should have known that it couldn’t last.
Cas didn't respond, instead tracing a box that featured a nightlight shaped like an angel. After lingering on that one, he let his gaze drift to some of the others- some were plain, others had designs from various children's shows and movies.
“I told you, I want seeds.”
Finally: Kudos and Comments are my bread and butter, please leave some!
“Cas, come on!” Dean calls. “We’re checking out.”
Cas’ scowl borders dangerously on a pout as he pulls back and sweeps out of the room, empty mugs in hand, and Dean allows himself to chuckle. Of the many inconveniences that came with being human, brushing his teeth seems to be Cas’ true kryptonite. Sam was on a campaign to force him to do it regularly, twice a day, but so far results had been mixed. The former angel did not like the feeling of the brush against his teeth, his gums, or (Billie forbid) the roof of his mouth. He did not like the consistency of the toothpaste. He did not like to gargle. Sam was beginning to despair, and Dean knows he isn’t much help, often slipping Cas a piece of gum to freshen his breath rather than go through the work of forcing him to use ‘proper dental hygiene.’
"I don't need a goddamn nightlight, Cas. These are for kids. And we don't need Christmas lights either, holiday is long over." Dean complained as Sam strode back into the room.
Sam and Eileen went on increasingly long runs that Dean was growing increasingly convinced were more for romance than for wellness. Dean went outside to walk Miracle four times a day when there were no hunts. Sometimes they jogged. Sometimes they sat on a hill near the bunker and looked at the sky and the grass, and Dean’s eyes would trace the path of a honey bee going from flower to flower and tell Miracle about that time Cas had shown up naked and covered in the insects.
And yet.
"I would have to get a more appropriately sized sleeping bag." Cas frowns a moment. "And mind your bed time."
"You can." Cas' lips are at his cheek now. "You've faced bigger demons."
Castiel smiles that smile that Dean loves so much, the one that scrunches up his nose and flashes his teeth, and Dean can’t help but kiss him. Then he wrinkles his nose, pulling back.
“You still going on about Crowley? Because I swear we've covered that ground already.”
“Were you hoping I wouldn’t notice? That I would be so… ah,
“Wait, so you're literally made of love, is that what you're telling me?” Dean had shifted a little closer, but his face was screwed up in almost comedic disbelief. “You're saying freaking
Everything about the bunker was
“Dean?” Cas prodded after a few moments of silence. Dean shook himself back into reality.
“No, listen- You remember back before the apocalypse started? Pamela had just died, and Cas showed up with Uriel--”
“But—” A low keening sound comes from Dean’s throat and Sam blinks back even the thought of tears.
“Did you say--”
"You know, Cas... they say that whatever you're doing the first few minutes of the New Year... that's what you'll be doing all year long."
Dean throws back his head and laughs, imagining Cas’ face when he is denied something sweet, and feeling lighter than he had since Cas had lost his powers, he guides their son to the kitchen.
TO EILEEN: It’s kind of tense around here.
Finally, Lucifer unearthed a box which held a seed and a bit of dirt. He smirked- this could only be from the tree of knowledge in the Garden. It wasn't a weapon, per se, but as a source of power (his smirk widened when he realized it's holiness had not faded with time) it would be quite valuable. He stuffed it in the pocket of Castiel's ridiculous trench coat and exited the cage. There were other weapons, he knew, lost to the sands of time, some collected by upstart humans or demons who knew to ward against angels… but hardly inaccessible. Perhaps it was time to pay the Winchesters a call in that regard...
Sam scowled after his brother's disappearing footsteps, then continued on his way to the bathroom, his hand against the wall to guide his way.
"That is something I cannot give you." The angel muttered. Sam bit back a grin and placed a bag containing apple pie on the table.
“Good.” Cas nods, but is silent as they get into Baby and drive towards town for the store. That’s fine by Dean. He turns on the radio, suddenly feeling as irritated as Cas sounded.
“Yeah, I know.” Dean mutters, and looks away. He tries to skip a rock in the brook, grunting in dissatisfaction when it only plunks into the water with a splash.
“I'm gonna be here until we find something. We have to save Cas.”
Naomi’s voice rings out, and Castiel almost lurches in surprise, the sound echoing through his head in the otherwise silent room.
“Fuck off, Cas,” Dean snaps, the sharpness of his words diluted by the way he struggles to breathe around the gash on his neck, and all of a sudden Castiel is
“Dean, I have to tell you something,” Castiel says. He grips Dean’s hands tightly, suddenly wondering why they had never done this before. Dean’s hands were warm in his, calloused but soft, and he squeezed Castiel’s hands back gently. “You are the sword of Michael. The angels had you killed to keep you prisoner in your own Heaven until Michael could bring you back to life to use you.”
“Don’t lie to me,” The Ghost murmurs, his voice going quiet. “Who are you?”
Dean frowns. “Use me for what?”
“Jesus, Dean,” Sam breathes out, worry flooding his features. “Any other injuries I should know about?”
"Angel blade," Dean explains, surprising Elijah that he actually answered. He opens Cas' trench coat and tugs at the button down shirt tucked into his pants- Cas lets him move him easily, allowing Dean to lift the shirt to reveal his ribs, where a large
Castiel nods as if to say
The first time Dean meets The Butcher, it is entirely by accident.
Naomi cuts in sharply.
“That’s what we were just asking him,” Bobby says, shotgun still aimed at Castiel’s chest. He takes a few tentative steps forward, pointing with the gun as he adds, “You gonna tell me how you got in here without us noticing?”
and the voices disappear completely.
Cas sighs happily into his mug and closes his eyes, resting his head on Dean's shoulder. "I love you, too, Dean," He murmurs. Dean's heart sizzles like the oil in the pan, and he lets Cas doze there on his shoulder, his coffee slowly getting cold in his hands.
Sam asks Castiel to continue watching over Dean. It’s a kind sentiment, one that Castiel is sure he would take time to appreciate more if he wasn’t already doing just that. Nevertheless, he agrees easily, tells Sam that he will always be here to keep them safe. To keep Dean safe.
Elijah shakily checks his watch. "One twenty-three."
. Like I’m Picasso or some shit.”
The shower turns off in the bathroom, a jarring reminder that they are not alone in the world. Dean’s eyelids flutter closed again, and Castiel dumps the remains of Dean’s shirt on the bed and vanishes as quickly as he can.
“Dean,” Sam says, voice unnaturally calm. “Dean, wake up.”
“There has to be a
and disappears out to his car.
"Dean," Cas says, voice just as grating as Dean remembers it in the best way.
Castiel can’t come out and say he needs to make sure no harm comes to the Michael sword, so he simply says, “Of course.”
Dean has coffee ready for Cas one morning, steaming hot and in his favorite blue mug with the different types of flowers on the side, and Cas looks so happy at that first sip, leaning one hip against Dean's as he stands over the stovetop making breakfast.
“They said,” Castiel’s lips form around the words like they are foriegn and unpracticed. He is surprisingly nervous for how Dean is going to react. “That because physical torture would not work on you, they used psychological torture instead. Tortured your mind.”
Dean blinks back to life when Sam touches him, his eyes sliding back to normal and his face setting into hard lines. His gaze turns into a glare, and he looks at Castiel with all the ferocity of the first time they met.
Zachariah’s grin falters. “Did Castiel not tell you of your fate?”
Zachariah pulls a handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit, wipes his blade down carefully with it. The red of Dean’s blood is stark against the cream white silk. “Do not worry, Castiel- it’s all part of Heaven’s plan.”
Dean sighs and scratches at his head. He moves to come closer to the three of them, standing just a few inches away from Elijah. He smells like leather and oil and something distinctly similar to ozone. "You got the time?"
“Dean,” Castiel says again, and his voice breaks heavily. Another terrifyingly human trait.
"Nah, man, he fought Lucifer. Got possessed by him and dragged his ass back into Hell with him inside," Richard grins, like the story is a legendary piece of gossip and not a horrifying fact of life, one that makes Elijah get chills up his spine.
“It’s whatever,” Dean mumbles.
“Perhaps,” Castiel murmurs between kisses, voice soft. “We should take this back to my hotel room. I wouldn’t want to contaminate your work.”
“How did it-” Sam approaches him quickly, taking Dean’s face in his hands and turning it this way and that. Dean swats at him like he’s an annoying bug. “What happened to it?”
Beneath the tree Dean and his Heaven version of Castiel lay. Heaven Castiel lays on his back, his wings spread completely open and bare, stretching to their full size around them. He is clearly asleep, his face slack and peaceful- Dean is tucked into his side, his palm flat against Heaven Castiel’s chest, like he’s watching the expanding of his ribs, counting the thumping of his heartbeat. Castiel can relate, thinking back to watching Dean sleep, comforted by the mere sight of him breathing.
Castiel is so surprised by Dean’s words, by the implication that
“Huh?” Dean reaches up to paw at his face, pressing against his cheekbone. “Really?”
Sam lets out a noise of confusion, whipping around to look at Dean. Dean doesn’t respond again. Instead, he turns around and turns the car engine on, the rumbling of the Impala the only sound between the three of them.
Zachariah seems to ignore his question, instead shrugging to himself. “Ah, well. You’ll know it soon enough,” He looks back up at Dean, eyes flashing white blue, and adds, “Really, terribly sorry about this, Dean,” in a voice that does not sound sorry at all.
“Is this just from blisters? Did you trip over something? Step on glass?” Sam asks, and Dean shakes his head, taking on the sheepish expression of a child being scolded over something they had already been warned about. Sam sighs again and sets about cleaning the blood off of Dean’s feet, as though he expected this to happen.
It's what triggers Dean to move forward- a horrible sort of realization that Cas may be afraid of what he'll do next, and the even worse memory of the last time they saw each other, that Cas didn't think Dean felt the same way. That he had to keep these feelings close to his heart, quiet and content to never share them for the rest of eternity.
“Yeah,” Dean says, slowly. “That’s me.”
Dean looks like he’s genuinely thinking about it. He sort of wiggles his limbs around, moves his head back and forth, rolls and bends his joints as though he were taking inventory of his entire body. “I think my feet are blistered,” He announces finally.
“You’re dead,” Castiel repeats. His grace shivers inside him, and suddenly he doesn’t think he can hold himself up. He drops to his knees before Dean, his vessel shaking. “You’re dead because I didn’t get to you in time.”
“Thanks, angel,” Dean breathes out, and for the first time since they’ve met, his lips quirk into a crooked smile, directed at Castiel.
Dean stops scratching, frowning. In his lap, Cas feels almost tense, waiting for him to respond. Dean tries to count in his head, but honestly, he's lost track.
All of the breath leaves Dean’s lungs like he’s been punched in the gut. For a very long moment, they both just stand there- Dean blank-faced and in shock, Cas hesitant, like he's not sure what Dean's next move is. Like he's not sure if Dean's going to greet him or punch him out.
In the silent stillness that follows as his wings disappear, Castiel can just pick out Dean’s heartbeat. It’s solid and
It doesn’t help, but he can at least pretend.
Richard and Henry take a step back. The hunter flounders for a second, clearly as a surprised as Elijah that there was someone in the car. But once he takes in his appearance he settles, like he can tell the man isn't a threat- other than his stare, he does look in the least bit alarming. If anything, he looks ordinary.
“They showed me visions to torture me because the physical torture wouldn’t work,” Dean takes a shakey breath. “They were of… I mean, they showed me you.”
“The Ghost,” Dean repeats, and the man looks at Dean like he’s speaking a foreign language. Dean squints at him. “Dude, you don’t know your own name?”
Dean looks stunned. In the few seconds Castiel allows his wings to be seen on this realm, Dean takes them in with a look of awe, his hand twitching in his lap like he wants to reach out and run his fingers through the feathers. Castiel is surprised to find he is not entirely against the idea.
Dean frowns, his brow furrowing. Castiel is overcome with the sudden, foreign urge to reach out and smooth out the crease between it. “No, I mean when you- when you pulled me out. What did you see?”
Dean’s brow furrows. “My what?”
Castiel is, as he finds himself often these days, at a loss for words.
"I said, who are you?" The hunter demands again.
Castiel’s head snaps up immediately, and although he can’t see anything but the water-stained motel ceiling, he can still hear the tittering echoes of his angel brethren, all of them listening in with bated breath, their attention focused on any information regarding the Michael sword.
Sam, to all his credit, doesn't even blink. In fact, he doesn't react at all- all he does is grumble, "Morning," as he fetches a mug from the cabinet. Like it's expected. Like it's normal.
“What am I eating?” Meg asks one night, her mouth full. They’re all gathered in Meg’s apartment for dinner, a routine they try to uphold at least every other week.
The first time Elijah meets Dean Winchester, it is at a bar, nearing one in the morning, and Dean is gloriously drunk.
Dean makes a noise like he’s trying to find his voice, his throat catching. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and when he opens them again his face is hardened and impassive.
"I love you," Dean blurts out. He's mildly surprised he's not embarrassed by it, now that the theatrics of their reunion are over, but he thinks maybe he's waited so long to say it that embarrassment has no place here and has moved on completely. The way Cas' eyes light up and his whole being glows when he hears it might be helpful, too.
Zachariah replies in a dismissive tone.
Dean’s reads,
“Fuck,” Sam suddenly says beside them, and he drops to his knees, forehead pressing against the edge of the bed. “Fucking hell. Thank you, Castiel.”
“And what purpose is that?” Dean asks, eyes fierce. Castiel curves his hand around Dean’s neck, around the wound, and Dean reaches up to grab Castiel’s wrist like he thinks he’s strong enough to pull him off. “What reason did you have to pull
“Just in case you have another seizure.” Eileen says, her voice firm. “If you really wanted to get a drink, I couldn’t stop you.” She pauses, and then smirks at him. “Well, I could but…”
The usual triggers for this chapter regarding alcoholism, and the usual reminder that Dean does not know how to deal with things in a healthy way.
“Alcoholism is a disease with both physical and psychological components.” Cas interrupts. “The very shape of the human brain changes because of it. Dean has always been… wary… of any interference with his mind by angels. As have you.”
“Wha—no, he doesn’t.” Dean knows he was rough with the kid in the beginning. After Mary died as well. Dean couldn’t forgive him fully, but he had tried, hadn’t he? He’d made him birthday cake and watched Scooby Doo. Jack didn’t
“Mouse Trap.” Jack chirps, relaxing. “It’s a game. Do you want to play?”
“I have led garrisons of angels against the worst forces of hell, I have looked the Empty in its face and rebelled against God, but that might have been the most terrifying moment of my life.” Cas says, his voice muffled against his hands.
To Jack's surprise, Dean is the first one to wrap his arms around him. Dean's gruff voice rumbles through him.
"This is what is going to happen." Cas says, his voice dripping with authority, and Dean distantly thinks that he would find that voice
, surely it wasn't wrong. “How
“I don't know what you're talking about.”
“Dean.” He whispered. He was not sure how he intended to continue that sentence, but suddenly he didn't have to, because Dean's lips were on his and his grace was blazing within him. He gasped at the feeling of it, and Dean took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. Cas was vaguely aware of his hand reaching out to grip Dean's shoulder, and then it was Dean's turn to gasp as his soul rose up and in congruence with Cas' grace, straining against the physical boundaries between them. Dean pulled away then, eyes wide and lips swollen.
"Trees are for Christmas, Cas. These are Christmas lights." Sam explained wearily.
, but they managed to get back to the Bunker in one piece (and when had Sam assigned the Bunker a capital 'B'? It felt right, though.)
“That’s because Sam is a nerd.” Dean throws an arm around Jack’s skinny shoulders, noting how the kid leans in to his embrace. “Let’s go show him what a real breakfast looks like.”
“It’s nothing local.” Eileen assures Dean, elbowing Sam, whose brow furrows in consternation. “We are not going. Just helping fill in blanks.”
“That's really what you see in me, Cas?”
Dean feels Cas’ breath in an amused puff against his chest, and another nuzzle of his stubbled face, before the man rolls off of him.
“Just so we're clear, I'm iffy on this.” Sam said, even as he pulled on his boots and followed his brother towards the car. “Lucifer must know that Crowley worked against him during the Apocalypse, sat on a throne while he was stuck in the Cage. That he's still breathing air without having offered Lucifer something is sounding pretty far-fetched to me.”
gave you?”
“Dean?”
"What's that-- Cas, you know I don't care about the damn powers." Cas leans closer, more intent, hands gripping Dean's wrists now.
Deep inside him, Jack's hybrid grace moves, pulsing warmly. Shifting. Asking a question. Jack rests his hand against his stomach and casts his eyes over the park again. He notes that a couple of parents are giving him odd looks, remembers that he's too old to be hanging around a park with no child of his own.
And then he went.
“Dean!” Cas’ voice is sharp, almost angry as he approaches. Dean turns to face him, astounded at the scowl on his face. “What the hell are you doing?”
Sam stopped leaving the hallway lights on at night.
“’S meant to.” Dean says, grunting slightly as Cas shifts his weight.
“We were wondering what you might know about angelic exorcisms.”
“Yes. It is not something that I could bring indoors.” Cas said apologetically. “At least, not to the same effect. Will you come?” And dammit if Cas isn't using his big blue eyes to his fullest advantage- Dean could no more say no to that look than he could deny Sam's patented puppy face.
“So, if they were gonna happen, they were gonna happen around now.”
"What the fuck, Cas, Sam's been filling your heads with smoothies and self-help books..."
timing. Anyway, sometimes seizures happen during the worst parts of alcohol withdrawal. You’re about sixty hours in—”
EILEEN: I don’t mind.
“It is somewhat more complicated than that, but, for the purposes of this conversation, yes. The love that creates us is pure. Like anything, however, it can become corrupted. Twisted. It is a fate that has befallen many angels.”
“Y-y-yes it iiiiiis.” Dean gasped out, fighting to get his (irritating, obnoxious, and definitely not endearing) laughter under control. “Y-you're like freaking Snow White or something. A goddamn Disney princess. And here I was thinking all you angels were so freaking bad ass...”
“Perhaps it is strange to you. But to me...” Cas looked down at his hands, turning them over in his lap. “I am not a physical being, Dean. Though I inhabit this vessel alone now, this body is not
“Wait, why is Crowley an idea?” Sam scowled. “It's not anything but a
“Then I suppose you will have to kiss me, if you wish me awake.” Cas murmured without thinking. Dean stiffened next to him and Cas froze in place for a moment, terrified that Dean would pull away.
“D-Dean...” Sam swallowed, leaned his head against his brother’s. “It- it’s okay.”
Sam turns towards his friend and his brother and immediately clocks Cas’ concern. Dean is sitting stiffly, his jaw working, his eyes staring straight up at the ceiling but completely unfocused. In Cas’ lap, his feet are curled and his legs fully extended, almost unnaturally so.
“Sammy?” Dean’s eyes are glazed as he looks at Sam before he blinks and they become clearer. “We holdin’ hands now?”
Dean wants a drink. Badly. And he’s absolutely fucking pissed that he can’t have one. There’s not even any booze left in the bunker, from what he can tell. He’d gone on a desperate search the night after he’d had his seizure, taking advantage of the uneasy sleep Cas had fallen into. With shaking hands he’d gone through all the cabinets, checked the garage, looked in the fridge, and the place was bone dry. All his efforts had yielded was a startled yelp from Sam when he walked in on him making out with Eileen in the library. Swearing, he’d returned to bed, ignoring Castiel’s confused sleepy grumblings. Now, another twelve hours of absolute misery later, he’s moving restlessly through the bunker once more. He’s sick of this.
“I appreciate you not wanting to maim me.” Dean laughs, feeling his shoulders relax. “Sam won’t miss you?”
“Your skills are second to none.” Cas overrides Dean again. “The threats that remain in this world are as nothing compared to those you have already faced. There is no reason to assume that you will find your end at the mercy of a ghost or vampire. You can have a long, fulfilling life, Dean.” Cas reaches out and rests a hand on Dean’s knee. “You deserve a long, fulfilling life. I want you to be able to live it.”
Dean whispered that last part, leaning in a little too close but what was too close to them anyways. He looked back at Cas and saw the younger boy blushing, so hard in fact that the blush was creeping down his neck and up his ears. Dean smiled as he turned away to fix his royal blue tunic. He was jealous that Cas didn't have to dress in the traditional formal wear he had to and got to wear his favourite blazer. He felt a gentle hand placed on his shoulder, realizing it was Cas he turned back to his best friend. He realized somehow super quietly Cas got up and picked up his crown ready to help Dean place it perfectly on, Cas was always better at it. Cas gently placed Dean's elegant crown on his head, making sure the emerald stone was facing the front, it was Cas' favourite. Unfortunately that meant Dean's favourite, the sapphire one, was a little crooked and off centre but it sat their right beside the emerald just as beautiful as the other gem. He was glad he decided on a alternating emerald and sapphire crown when he was younger.
"Dean, Scooby Doo isn't real." Cas said rolling his eyes.
"Who says I have to be friends with only boys. There's Jess. Her mom is the seamstress. She's kind and laughs at my jokes." Sam said matter a factly. Dean knew who Jess was, the seven year old girl was a cutie pie that was for sure. Always happy and giggling. She always was happy to see Dean and Cas and would hug both of them whenever she saw them.
They were 36 when they got the call from the King's Advisor in the middle of the cold December night, Bobby had passed. He seemed so healthy other than his grief for the passing of Mary. The kingdom's top doctors revealed the cause of death to be literally a broken heart. It was that night they packed Charlie, Claire, and Jack up and went back to Sioux Falls, where the castle the boys grew up was. It was that night that they went from just Charlie, Claire and Jack of Lawrence, sons and daughter of the Dukes of Lawrence, to Princes and Princess of the United Kingdom of South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. Charlie forced to become the next heir of the throne at a young age. They had always held these titles, but the responsibilities of  the title was something Dean and Cas tried to hide with the freedom of Lawrence, with the cottage and the normalcy of just being a family of five with their two rescue dogs, Zepp and Aero.
You could hear Bobby's laughs. But when Cas and Dean looked at Mary, she did not look as pleased as the King. "I want both of you to apologize to Sam before dessert, but if you three can excuse me, I'm going to go find my scared little boy, god knows where he ran off too in this castle." She left the dining room in search for her youngest son. The boys looked at Bobby for his take on the prank.
"Princess Charlotte, would you care to dance?" Dean asked offering her his arm. She snaked her arm around his and he led them to the dance floor. He looked up to his mother and saw her smiling. She approved of Charlotte, at least he was doing something right. They started waltzing to the song, both clearly classically trained in dancing, something expected by two royals.
"Girls are not icky Dean-o." Charlie butted in.
"Well technically it called demisexual, but yeah if you are more comfortable with bi." Cas explained. Dean felt overjoyed. The boy he had loved for longer than he can remember liked him back.
"You guys can't tell anyone else. Promise us." Dean started.
"Well Ma said back when I was eight that she'd rather Cas be King Advisor instead of Prince consort."
"Dean," Cas said cutting Dean off from his pep talk. Dean just laughed.
"Well Cassie, your eyes remind me of sapphires, what other reason would I insist sapphire be on my crown."
Sam joined Charlie in looking intimidated. Cas had a question in just how Sam managed to disappear everyday and not get caught.
Luckily Charlie and her father arrived, they enjoyed a nice lunch before Charlie convinced them to go for a walk to the lake that was on the edge of the palace boundaries. It was a hot August day so how could the boys say no to that idea. Sam even joined them on the little hike.
"I was eight, I was thinking of more like my best friend and I ruling together, co-kings like partners in crime not marriage, instead of marrying some icky girl."
"I can and I will. Dean is going to be an amazing King. Elisa was never promised to Dean, hell Mary didn't even try and convince him to seek a relationship out with her. I will not tolerate the slander that I am hearing against my own family. Castiel is an amazing boy, with more of a heart than you can ever dream of." Bobby replied.
Dean choked on his food a little bit and he heard his father and brother snort. "I will consider it Mom, don't worry." He wasn't sure he even wanted to date Royalty. He wasn't even sure he wanted to date girls.
Sam scoffed and Charlie looked a little intimidated. "What do you have against us Dean?"
Sam and Jess and their two sons, James and Gabe met them at the palace gates when the family arrived in the early morning. Meeting them with hugs, tears, and hot chocolate. The funeral was to be New Years Eve.
"Well Dean, I am Queen consort. It means that I am married to your father, the king. One day your wife will be titled Queen consort as she stands beside you when you reign," Mary said sweetly to her curious child.
"But I don't get to have a friend with me to go to school, or eat dinner with, or have sleepovers every night do I? And they are girls, as much as I like Jess and Jo, they have cooties and I am not risking it."
"And Daphne is sweet, but she says she found this boy named Emmanuel while at University." Cas said placing the last of the flowers beside the queen. Blushing slightly from the conversation, but Mary only expected that was because Cas was a shy kid.
The boys quietly changed and made their way to the dining room, sitting in their normal spots. It was different when someone figured it out accidentally and they were forced to explain, but this time they were going to tell Mary without a reason. When they all began to eat and settle into the meal, Bobby had to open his mouth.
"I'm just Castiel, I can't be a Duke." Cas said quietly.
"Apologize or you'll have to come with me to this month's town hall. That goes for you to Novak." the boys grumbled. They knew Bobby always came back exhausted after the monthly town meetings, but they were important to the kingdom and the smooth ship Bobby was running. It gave the King an opportunity to see straight from the people what the issues were and ideas of improvement.
Dean was glad it was a warm July evening. He had asked Cas if he wanted to take a walk to the lake, the place where they shared their first kiss. He was sure Cas would notice something was up when the ever so bright Sam announced that he was going to join them with Jess and Bobby hit him with his newspaper over his head. Gratefully Cas seemed to ignore the entire Sam thing and accepted Dean's hand as they walked towards the lake.
"Your mother isn't doing harm Dean. Though I am quite surprised that you are finding me a partner, Ma." Dean simmered down a bit hearing Cas' voice, and him calling his mother Ma just made him think about what if he was actually Mary's son in law instead of just surrogate son.
Dean laughed at the princess. "No Charles, he's not gay. Doesn't mean that I don't want to get over him."
"I'm so sorry Cas, I don't know why I did that. You aren't gay and I should've just swallowed my feelings-" suddenly Cas leaned in and kissed Dean back. All Dean's worries suddenly vanished. This felt so right.
"You're right, I'm not gay." Cas said after they pulled away from each other.
"You chose my favourite one of your shirts." Cas said when he saw Dean's outfit.
"I know that it isn't the 67 impala that Bobby gifted you or the song or rather the anthem the kingdom gifted you, but I know that you love your plaid and I remembered that you ripped your favourite one when you went horseback riding the last time, and well you've never had a green one, which is a shame considering green makes your eyes pop and that will make all the girls swoon for the future king." Cas said, the last part a little sarcastically but still made Dean laugh.
“You gonna be up all night solving that thing?”
“I will be as gentle as I can, Dean.” Castiel insisted, seeing the hesitation on Dean's face. He seemed distressed that Dean might not come with him. Dean sighed and nodded.
But he also knew that when Cas was back, he'd been able to cut back on his drinking. Of course, he drank more beer than water, he was still an alcoholic... but it wasn't bad. It wasn't drinking ‘til he was passed out in his own vomit on the floor, it wasn't shaking hands and slurred words and out of control anger. It was... baseline, he supposed. He was never drunk when he drove Baby (his BAC might disagree, but he'd built up a tolerance, dammit, and a lot of experience, and he knows where his limits are), and a glass or two of whiskey before bed wasn't the same as passing out drunk. When he did get wasted, he wasn't nasty with Cas around. He laughed, snorted beer out his nose. Got a little clumsy. Maybe leaned into Cas' touch a little more, maybe let himself rest his head on his shoulder. He ruffled Jack's hair until it was sticking out in every imaginable direction, leaving Jack looking like a disgruntled rooster and Sam guarding his own hair with defensive arms, face caught somewhere between a scowl and a laugh. It was good. It was fine. When Cas was here, even the hangovers weren't bad. He would sometimes wake up on the couch in the Dean Cave to Cas brushing his fingers over his shoulder or through his hair and alerting him to a glass of water on the end table. When Cas was gone… well, the less said about that the better.
"Lights." Cas explained. "You will not hate them. I made sure."
“I’m not fucking hiding.” Dean pitches the empty bottle into a bush. “I just wanted a drink in peace.”
“That sounds like fun.” Eileen says.
It's Jack's fourth birthday!!! As his family prepares to celebrate, he does some thinking and comes to a decision.
I'm not sure I'm happy with this chapter, honestly. I might have put too much in it, or too little.
It doesn’t take long for Dean to find what he needs—bananas, Nutella, some blueberries for Sam. He grabs a new bag of flour, and a new one of sugar. He turns down the juice aisle and picks up a jug of apple juice and a jug of cranberry. On a whim, he tosses some cherry Kool-Aid into the cart. Jack might get a kick out of it. Turning down the next aisle, he snags a few bags of chips to stack up the Dean Cave. He moves on autopilot through the rest of the store, coming out in the front to see Cas still talking to the man at the floral counter, his hands now full of seed packets and a potted plant nestled in the crook of his elbow. Cas laughs at something the man says, shaking his head and saying something back that prompts a further smile from the man. Dean heads for a checkout line, drumming his fingers on the handle of his cart. He watches the woman in front of him begin unloading her cart—mostly kitty litter and cat food—and turns his head back towards the floral department to look for Cas, who’s still chattering away. You’d think he hadn’t spent the whole car ride in stubborn silence in protest of Dean’s music choices.
Cas’ eyes flicker to the edge of the bed, where the cap of the bottle is just visible. Dean wavers for a moment, but then puts it back down.
Dean snarls and Sam tenses, but suddenly Cas is between them.
“You 'require more love.' Jesus, you're a worse princess than Sammy.” He complained playfully. “But I guess it is my duty, isn't it?” And without waiting for an answer, he leaned in to kiss Cas again.
It’s the way his name (Cas now, just Cas. No longer Castiel, God’s Shield. Dean had claimed him completely) sounded so right and safe in Dean’s mouth, like it was meant to be there.
“One week.” Dean says finally. “I’ll stop all of it for one week, just to prove I can. No beer, no booze. And if I decide I don’t need to go bone-dry after that, you leave it alone.”
“All that matters.” In two more minutes of silence, this time peaceful, they pull up to the bunker and into the garage. They unload the groceries and carry them into the kitchen.
“He does.” Cas has both of Dean’s hands in his, his thumbs stroking over Dean’s fluttering pulse. “He isn’t angry with you. In fact, I… I think he believes he deserves your ire.” Dean cannot handle the sadness in Cas’ voice. “He doesn’t. And he certainly does not deserve to feel afraid of you. Not in his own home. Not when he loves you so much. Dean, you
Dean startles and turns his head to see Eileen knocking on the passenger side window, looking unimpressed. He contemplates, briefly, pulling out of the garage without acknowledging her. It would be so easy. She doesn’t deserve that. He unlocks the door, lets her settle into the passenger seat.
“I couldn’t even scan his body for damage.” Cas says thinly. “Humans are so limited in what they can do. So fragile, so many ways they can break.”
And they did.
“Was it unpleasant for you?” Cas asked, suddenly concerned. Humans were such physical creatures- he had no way of knowing if the sort of metaphysical reaction that had occurred between him and Dean might have been too overwhelming.
“Alright, alright. Let's go already.”
The silence between his question and Castiel’s answer is painfully long.
“Are you sure about that?”
Just as the Enterprise makes its escape from the black hole, Sam hears Cas’ concerned voice.
It was not a unique occurrence, and even after Sam started using his phone flashlight, they would often bump into each other if they were both in the hallway after they'd turned the lights out for the night. Both Winchesters were large men, after all. This was to say nothing of the stubbed toes on the slight lip that led into the bathroom, or the glasses of water knocked off the end table by searching hands (this happened more to Sam than to Dean, but only because Dean would often fall asleep with his beer cradled in his arms like an infant.
it. He'd fix it, and he'd be disappointed in Dean, but Michael would be gone and Mom and Dad would be together, and Sam would have both his parents for the first time in his life.
“What the hell was that?” Dean asked. “I mean, not that that wasn't great, but what was that bit with my shoulder? Felt like… hell, I don't even know what.”
Eileen's name-sign for Jack is "nougat", which doesn't really exist in ASL but is a sign in German Sign Language.
“Dean.”
“They’re plotting now.” He mutters to himself, then hooks a finger in the collar of Cas’ trench coat, tugging him towards the door. “Let’s go, Jolly Green.”
“They were my brothers and sisters, Father, as well as your children,” he'd pleaded while God created Purgatory and locked the Leviathan away there. “Let me help you- Let Michael and I be your sword and shield, and we shall not let you down.”
Despite himself, Dean’s lips quirk up, and he pulls Cas’ hand to his lips in turn.
"Cas...." Dean trails off. What can he say? He’d never thought about it before but looking back… he thinks of fingers through his hair, on his shoulder. Days without the hangover.
“Dean, please.” Cas sets one of the mugs down on his end table, holding the other out to Dean. Dean’s fingers twitch before he lets go of the bottle again. He stretches his legs out, lets the bourbon rest in his lap as he takes the mug from Cas. It’s his favorite, he notes, the one with a chip near the handle and the Harley Davidson motorcycles chasing each other across the faded grey background. The coffee within is rich and dark, exactly the way he likes it. He takes a long pull before he turns back to Cas.
Castiel's grin is brighter than the fireworks. And- because who was he to defy tradition?- he leaned in and kissed Dean again.
“I want you to stay.” Dean said immediately. “You better fucking stay, Cas, I swear to God--”
“I think the water needs to be still for that.” Eileen says, chucking a rock of her own into the water. Dean shrugs and throws another rock.
"Dean? Sam? There have been temporal distortions radiating out from Lebanon, are you--" Cas stops halfway down the stairs, his eyes wide as he takes in John standing defensively between Sam and Dean. "Well. That explains some of it at least."
“Whatever. Bitch.”
Cas turns his head towards Dean’s voice, a smile still on his face. He nods and turns back to the man at the counter for a moment before heading to the checkout line. The man seems sad to see him go, which gives Dean no small amount of pleasure as he starts tossing his groceries onto the conveyor belt.
"Alright, alright." Dean put his hands up. "Dad, we've got a lot more to tell you. But Cas is here because this is his home, same as it is ours. He's one of us." Dean forces his voice to firmness, goes for the same tone he used to use to defuse fights between Dad and Sammy. He gives Sam a look, and his brother sighs.
“You’re right.” Cas says. “I’m sorry, Dean. It seems I let my emotions get the better of me.”
"I am Castiel." Cas is suddenly much closer, having descended the stairs while Dean panicked. "You are John Winchester."
“Welcome back, Sam. Thank you.” Cas doesn’t look much better, if Sam is honest. His eyes are rimmed red, his hair messy on one side as though he’d been making a fist in it—a nervous habit he’d been developing since he’d become human and started letting it grow. He takes the bottles of Gatorade and sets them on the end table next to Dean, then walks past Sam to where the remote still rested on the floor.
"I can't, jerk. It's dark. There's no windows."
“Not that.” Cas lowers his hand and looks at Sam. “I didn’t push the issue sooner. When I still had my grace.”
Dean didn't say anything in response. But he went.
"I do not see why I need to be here, Sam. It seems very... chaotic."
He decides to climb every tower in the playground.
"Wh- Dean." Cas sounds upset. Dean doesn’t look up.
“Oh yes you are. Sleeping Beauty.” Dean laughed, jostling him playfully.
Dean mulls it over in his head. He’s man enough to admit that he’s craving the bourbon at his bedside. It’s easier to fight the urge when Cas is around. He also knows that Sam doesn’t approve of a certain level of… well, there’s that word ‘excess’ again. But it isn’t…
“Charlie and Stevie have settled into their loft.” Cas presses on. “They meet up with some of the other hunters from apocalypse world to speak about their experiences.”
“See what, man? It's freezing.” Cas smiled at him.
for something so much, for it to consume him and set his very being aflame.
EILEEN: Two hours.
"Yes, it's quite dark at night." Cas agreed, shrinking away as a family with several children loudly moved past them. "I've healed you and Dean of several stubbed toes."
"You're damn right about that." Mary was in the doorway now, observing. "You hit him, Cas?"
And then Dean is running the short distance up to Cas and throwing his arms around him, chanting his name like a prayer.
And then there’s Cas.
“Then I will bear it for you, Father.” And his Father smiled at him and began to explain his plan.
"So, I'm sure you've noticed that there aren't really any windows in the bunker."
“Yes, he is.” Cas agrees. Then he holds his hand out to Dean. “I understand that he helped you plant a garden. Will you show me?”
He's just turned four.
And Dean was gone, in the Impala and practically flying down the road, feeling years melt off of him as he did. His back, which had started protesting at being on the road in life, now felt fresh and young. His knee, which had twinged with every change of the weather since the fight with the British Men of Letters, felt brand new. And every part of Dean’s being, every atom, was accelerating in one particular direction- towards Cas.
Dean mulls it over for a minute, letting his thumb trace the familiar shape of the bottleneck. It isn’t a conversation he wants to have. But when Cas is right there, looking at him with all the hope and affection in his eyes he always has, and when Dean remembers the press of their lips together at last… He sets the bottle back on the floor and nods.
“Dean
“I looked in that one already.” Dean said, pulling the book away from his brother. “And if it's something the demons made up- we might not have it. The lore we have on angels is spotty at best, anyway-- Remember how Cas threw out like five books because they were full of nonsense?”
“Whatcha got there, kid?” Dean asks, oblivious. Cas knows that he writes off much of Jack’s behavior as ‘weird angel stuff’, much like he did with Cas himself before they came to know each other for so many seasons.
TW for alcoholism and descriptions of anxiety (though that isn't the name that is put to it- yet). Please take care of yourselves!
“Dean?”
“Woah! Sorry!”
As always, I'm going to say that getting sober is a huge undertaking and it is advised that someone attempting to get sober does so with professional help. These boys are not handling this in a medically advisable way. Also, while I've done some research, I am not a doctor so take everything said in this chapter with a grain of salt as well.
,' he'd say. To everyone, even me. Even
"Twice, they were hairline fractures." Cas clocked the look on Sam's face. "I do not see why I should leave you in pain when you don't have to be."
But Castiel, as had been pointed out, is not human.
“Alright, fine, say you're right. What makes you think Crowley would help us? We haven't heard jack from him since we left Hell. He might have thrown in with Lucifer- or Lucifer could have killed him. I'm sure he remembers who helped us take him down last time.”
Sam enlisted Cas' help for his next shopping trip, knowing that Dean would never let him hear the end of it and that he needed to at least be able to make the purchases without needing to murder his brother first. They pulled in to the Wal-Mart outside of Lebanon, which Cas looked at with apprehension.
“No, not about Crowley. About Cas.” Sam allowed that to hang in the air between them for a moment. He knew that what he had to say next would not be received well, but he also knew it had to be said. “There's a chance he might not
Dean paused, took a breath he didn’t need anymore. He turned to Bobby with his eyes wide. Bobby raised his eyebrows at him.
“Just in case I try to sneak a drink?” Dean asks bitterly.
The drive is exactly what Dean needs. He and Eileen cruise down the highway, with the windows rolled down. He sings along to Zeppelin unashamedly, and Eileen smiles and laughs, tapping her foot to the beat because with the volume turned all the way up, she could feel the vibration of the bass. Instead of the bar Dean had intended to find, they stop at a food truck and buy burgers. Dean even manages to keep his down. On the way back, he pulls over and shows Eileen the babbling brook where he’d taken Jack to fish when he was sick.
“I’m sure Jack is gonna get him out of it, Dean. He’ll come back. Cas always comes back to us- to you.” Sam squeezed his shoulder.
“I didn't mean--” Cas began, but then he felt soft lips press against his forehead. He froze again. The lips moved to his temple. His grace rejoiced within him, dancing and healing. He felt calloused fingers brush against his neck and touch the underside of his chin, tilting his head up. Dean's mossy green eyes searched his for a moment. Cas' grace thrummed in anticipation, pushing against the surface of his vessel to be as close to Dean as possible- he didn't know it was possible to
“Dammit, Cas, how many times to I have to tell you...” He grumbled as he turned around to face his friend. He found Castiel standing behind him, staring with his usual intensity.
The rest of the trip was largely uneventful. Sam snuck a few of the plain night lights into the cart, hoping that if his brother saw options he wouldn't react with his typical displays of toxic manliness. He and Cas picked up a few groceries. He was unsuccessful in stopping Cas from getting the most sugary cereals he could find, and they spent far too long debating peanut butter textures considering one of them
“What is?” Dean asks around a yawn.
Yes, I am continuing with Rubik's Cube symbolism. For those who don't know, when you're solving a 3x3 cube, the best way to go (according to me) is layer by layer- you build your top face first, then you do the middle layer. These two things are actually fairly simple. The tricky part is the bottom face (opposite the one you started with), because you must be aware of how every turn you make affects the top face as well, and you have to be sure to not deconstruct the rest of the cube while you build your bottom face.
“Ok, well maybe I did… but you have to admit, it's pretty weird.”
Sorry for the slow updates, it's hard to write fic, read fic, and do a Masters Degree at the same times.
“Oh man, I remember this thing… we never had all the pieces.” Dean hurries down the stairs to join Jack at the table, running his hands over the pieces with an eager grin on his face. “Where did you get it?”
Below, in the Impala, Dean laughs at something Sam says, a map spread out amongst the dashboard, the open road ahead of them. Castiel closes his eyes and focuses on the sound of it.
Castiel considers arguing. The stairs creak as Bobby comes running down them, presumably with the first-aid kit. Sam is deliberately putting his body in front of his brother, like a shield, as though trying to keep as much distance between Dean and Castiel as possible. It’s probably for the best Castiel leaves, then, and resumes his post of watching in silence.
“I don’t know.” Dean shifts and uses his free hand to reveal the handprint on his shoulder. Sam glances up and does a double-take at it, eyes huge. “Whatever it was, it made sure to leave it’s mark.”
“Yeah?” Dean’s jaw clenches tightly, and he looks everything short of furious at Castiel’s statement. “Who asked you to do that?”
All three of them move at once. Meg reaches into her back pocket and pulls out the folded card. At the table, Castiel reaches into his trench coat and pulls out one as well. Dean reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out his most recent card.
Dean swallows thickly. His eyes turn glassy, and instead of him dismissing the angel, like Castiel remembers it, he reaches out with his palm open and allows Heaven Castiel to take his hand gently.
He's sat in the library with them both one morning, trying dutifully to work his fingers around the ASL words Eileen is teaching him as Sam scrolls through his laptop looking for a case, when there is a knock on the front door. Dean looks at Sam, confused, and Sam looks up from his screen, brow furrowed in a similar expression.
Dean's eyes flicker back to his brother for a split second, but Eileen comes into the kitchen then. She wanders over to Sam and tucks herself under his arm, still in her pajamas, and he smiles stupidly at her and presses a kiss to the top of her head.
Dean opens his mouth to speak again, but nothing comes out. He does it once, twice, and finally on the third try, he manages to rasp out, “Angel.”
“I will,” Castiel growls. “I pulled you out of
“My card was just down the street, actually,” Castiel circles the bodies, blue eyes almost glowing in the dark as he takes it all in. “I saw you on the sidewalk as I was finishing up.”
Cas' eyes are soft when Dean looks back at him, his lips curling into the tiniest smile. He reaches across the table and takes Dean's hand in his, squeezing it gently.
“Just let it happen,” Dean repeats. He reaches up, then, hand shaky and cold, and presses it to Castiel’s cheek. Castiel leans into it openly, closes his eyes and tries to channel more grace into the wound. It flashes weakly beneath he and Sam’s hands. “Angel, look at me.”
He swipes it from her, heart pounding suddenly. “What are you, stupid?” He snaps, ears going hot at his own mistake. He should’ve hidden it better. If some random girl at a bar could grab it, anyone could. “Didn’t anyone teach you not to touch things that aren’t yours?”
“Fuck you, Dean,” Sam snaps, eyes welling with tears. “Shut the hell up.”
“I- uh-” Now that he has the angel beside him, Dean seems to be at a loss for what to say. His eyes flicker from the road to Castiel and back again. Castiel waits patiently. “How are you?”
When he swings the door open, Cas is standing there.
Meg’s reads,
Zachariah’s voice thrums suddenly.
“We don’t need to bother anyone with this,” Dean says, and he looks frustrated. “I don’t know why we’re looking for this thing in the first place.”
The Ghost moves with absolute silence. One minute he’s a vague outline in the corner, and a split second later he’s looming over Dean, the cold, sharp point of a needle pressed against Dean’s neck. Dean’s throat closes up at the feeling, his eyes struggling to adjust and take in whatever features he could gather of the face now inches from his own.
"Branded?" Henry repeats skeptically. "How do you brand an angel?"
Without thinking twice, Castiel appears before Dean, standing between the television and the bed.
“Get away from me, Castiel,” Dean breathes out, and it is more unsettling than any of the other times he’s said it, his voice trembling quietly, soft and full of restrained fury. “Get the fuck away from me. If you ever come near me again, I will kill you. I swear I will.”
Her response is instantaneous.
“Dean,” Castiel begins, voice softening in a way he didn’t know he was capable of. “You feel no pain. Your body was destroyed, but your soul persisted. What did they do to you?”
He isn’t sure what he expects. In fact, he’s not sure he expects anything. He doesn’t think he knows enough about Dean’s past to properly place what Dean’s Heaven is going to look like. If he could guess, he would say it looks like the open road, with Sam by his side, conquering monsters and having a family and a home to return to at the end of the day.
Castiel’s heart thumps in his chest strangely. Sam, focused intently on wiping away all the dried blood and dirt from the wound, doesn’t even look up.
The lack of self-preservation comes with how Dean throws himself at anything and everything, only realizing in hindsight the effects it has on his body. Castiel has seen Dean get sliced open, burned, cut, poisoned, and broken, and any other physical extremity of damage he can think of. Sam is always there to patch him, checking his full body almost clinically every single night and morning, checking for blood or wounds or angles of bones. Dean can usually tell if something is broken, from what Castiel can see- he’ll notice the strange pressure of bones out of place, or the tightness of muscles being stretched out by it- but other than that he is the equivalent of a newborn baby at attending to his own injuries. Worse, even, because at least a baby would cry out in pain.
Dean says it again when Cas is settled- when he's said his greetings and removed his coat and taken a shower and is standing in Dean's room, looking like he belongs there and no where else. It's not even late, probably early evening, and randomly, Dean wishes the bunker was above ground, so his bedroom had windows and he could see Cas in the light of the sunset through the glass panes.
“Why are you following me?” The Ghost asks, and Dean almost jolts at the sound. It’s definitely a man, his voice deep and gravelly, just the slightest hint of an accent to it. Dean immediately wants to hear it again.
He’s freshly recruited, only on his third or fourth card, and he’s relishing in his new found power over his victims, and freedom to create his masterpieces. He’s learning, he knows, and he’s the newbie, so he has to be careful every step of the way for fear of being thrown out too early. He could always misstep and cause his higher ups to decide he is disposable, in which case he’d end up coming face to face with colleagues he’s only heard rumors about. He thinks, however, they like that he has a flair for the dramatic, has an almost obsessive attention to detail, because so far he’s only had high praise on his completed cards.
There’s something to be said for how intimate it is to watch a woman gut open a corrupt politician while you sit just a few feet away, Dean thinks as he does just that.
Cas looks at him, smiling, his eyes crinkling at the corner and his shirt untucked from his pants, and it comes up again unfiltered. Like Dean's body is so desperate to say it it'll get it out as fast as it can, any way it can.
Castiel explains. He watches Dean drive the car over highways and through towns, flitting in and out to make sure he’s alright. Dean seemed to have a destination in mind, somewhere he was determined to reach.
Dean doesn’t need her to elaborate. He looks at Castiel, who stares darkly back at him, before saying, “Show me.”
“Provençal stuffed squid,” Dean replies without opening his eyes from where he’s sitting on the kitchen counter, head tilted back against the cabinets. “It’s a French dish.”
"I love you, too, Dean," He replies, dutifully, and Dean's heart flutters in his chest. He takes Cas' hand in his own and pulls it to his mouth so he can press his lips to the back of it, feeling like he maybe doesn't deserve this kind of happiness.
Castiel removes his hand from Dean’s neck slowly, already missing the warmth of his skin. His hand drips blood onto the sheets. Dean stares at him like he’s terrified of him. His face contorts into several different emotions before settling on what seems to be betrayal.
Without thinking, Castiel reaches out and takes Dean’s wrists in his hands. Dean jerks, but his strength is no match for Castiel, who keeps him in place without even trying. Bobby yells something, but Castiel doesn’t hear it. He focuses instead on channeling his grace into flames, white blue light shining from his hands as he burns Dean’s flesh beneath his palms.
As he's unlocking the dead bolt, he has a terrible flashback to doing this just two weeks ago, after getting a call from Cas, and opening the door to Lucifer instead. The memory sits bitter and ugly in the back of his mind- he doesn't like that the last time he ever heard Cas' voice wasn't the words that Cas wanted him to hear.
Richard physically jerks backwards when Cas rips out the hunter's throat. Beside him, Henry mutters, "Jesus fucking Christ...", and after a few seconds, Elijah hears him turn tail and flee back into the bar.
“Dean,” Castiel whispers, because he doesn’t know what else to say, and these new, human emotions are still swirling around inside him, tangling with his grace.
Watching the Winchesters attempt to contact him is amusing to say the least. They begin by back tracking to Dean’s gravesite, which Castiel has to assume is traumatizing for Dean, but the man doesn’t look at all bothered peering into the broken remains of his own wooden coffin. If anything, he seems more affected by the impact of Castiel placing him in it; the circular destruction spanning almost half a mile out in every direction, trees and plants brought to the ground as though a bomb had gone off.
“I mean, we all have colleagues,” Dean says. “You’ve just never met yours before.”
The angels murmur in surprise. A new voice, Zachariah, sounds clearly amongst them.
It is frighteningly easy to get into Dean’s Heaven. No angel even blinks at him as he passes; he is barely thrown a gaze, the word spread too easily of his disappointment and failure at obtaining important information on the sword of Michael. It allows him to move through Heaven with ease, slide past judgemental eyes and cold shoulders until he comes to a halt before the door that reads
you were pulled out, Dean,” Sam says, for what must be the hundredth time in the past few days. His patience is unyielding against Dean’s stubbornness. “I can’t think of it being anything but a demon, and they’re not exactly known for doing things out of the goodness of their hearts.”
Castiel swallows. Outside, there is the clicking of the gas pump as Sam returns the nozzle to its place and screws on the gas tank cap. Inside the car, it is tensely silent.
Dean flips them over one by one.
"Now we wait," The hunter says, proudly.
“Stop it!” Sam shouts, and suddenly he’s throwing his full body weight at Castiel, only moving him because he takes the angel by surprise. Castiel blinks back to reality, feeling like he was in a dream for a moment. His hands shake, something he is absolutely not adapted to dealing with. Something he has never felt before.
The Ghost doesn’t reply. Dean shifts, the scratchy rope on his wrists chafing his skin. He makes a face, knowing the other can’t see it, and continues, “Is this a kink thing? I’m not one to judge, but I’m pretty sure you need my consent before tying me up.”
Dean feels the rope loosen, and he wiggles his hands out so he can bring them up to his chest, rubbing his chafed wrists. He swallows, loudly in the otherwise silent room, and meets The Ghost’s intense gaze.
Castiel presses their foreheads together. Dean closes his eyes and hiccups through another sob, and Castiel feels his grace humming in happiness despite the clawing sadness in his vessel’s heart. “Look where that got us. Now you’re dead instead.”
Dean nods, pursing his lips as he thinks. He glances between Cas and the hunter, and after a few seconds, lets out another sigh. "Okay," He says at Cas, nodding at the hunter. "Make it quick, though."
“However, this poses a serious question,” Castiel continues. He steps away from the brothers, instead circling around them slowly, taking in the way they both follow him with their eyes, never letting him out of their line of sight. “What was Hell like for you?”
It goes on like that for almost two weeks. Anytime Dean gets injured, Castiel waits until he’s deeply asleep to appear, channels his grace into his fingers and heals Dean’s body with all the reverence of a holy man touching something hallowed and sacred. Sam catches him, once, with his hand laid on Dean’s chest, healing a broken rib. The younger man doesn’t even blink, and if he sees the way Castiel looks at Dean like he is something brilliant and not just a human man, he says nothing.
“I know.”
"Dean," The man says, turning his gaze from the hunter to said man. His expression softens, but only a little. "This man hit Baby."
Castiel takes in the anger radiating off of Dean, the weight of his words. Anyone else would be eternally grateful to be pulled from Hell. From never-ending suffering, torture that breaks the body down to atoms and builds it back up again just to rinse and repeat. So, why isn’t Dean thankful?
Dean’s eyes flash with hurt, and it is the most response Castiel has ever seen at the mention of Hell. “Oh.”
a voice says in his head, echoing like bells, and he pinpoints it as Naomi’s. He hums to indicate he’s listening, keeping his eyes on Dean as he hotwires a rusty old car parked outside the store.
“Did… did they send you for me?” The Ghost asks, and it takes Dean a few seconds to understand what he’s really saying.
Henry and Richard jerk back, dragging Elijah with them. Dean doesn't move, looking down at the hunter with the expression one might look at their shoe when they've stepped in a pile of dog shit. "You're the one who suggested a leash," Dean says casually, like the hunter isn't bleeding through his fingers as he clutches his face, glaring up at them.
Dean knows almost instantly this is The Ghost. He also knows that the creak of the floorboard was intentional- The Ghost knew exactly what they were doing, and exactly how they wanted Dean to know they were there.
“Hello, Dean,” He says, and Dean nearly throws the remote control at him, jerking violently.
“Sammy, stop,” Dean gets out, brow furrowed. His eyes are startlingly clear for someone who had just been stabbed through the heart, but then again, he probably didn’t feel any of it. “Let it go.”
“No concussion,” Castiel confirms for Sam. “No brain damage of any kind.”
Castiel finds a vessel within twenty-four hours, from a devout man in South Dakota who prays every night and has a wife and daughter. He almost immediately says yes, and Castiel wonders if he should feel sorry when the daughter asks him (or rather, her father) where he’s going just before he vanishes off the front steps of their home.
Finally, as he shifts the car into park, he says, without looking at him, “Get the fuck out of my car, Cas, and don’t come back.”
On the couch, Dean’s gaze never wavers. He simply whispers, “Prove it.”
“It is?” Dean raises said appendage to examine, twisting it back and forth. Castiel almost winces, sees the way the bones grind together sickly beneath his skin.
“Yes,” Castiel replies, breaking Dean’s gaze to look at the younger Winchester. He looks amazed, he and the other man staring at him with the amount of respect and intimidation that most humans look upon angels with.
Castiel blinks at him. “I am aware that there are people fated by the universe and tied through the fabric of time and space to end up together.”
“Do you know about soulmates?” Dean asks.
“Following you? I was simply enjoying my evening, going for a stroll, when you-”
Castiel growls. There is a surprised silence, the quiet shiftings of other angels murmuring to each other over his tone.
It all comes to a head when Dean, stupidly, gets viciously wounded by a shapeshifter, and is dragged into their motel room with a broken leg and a slice on his neck that is dangerously close to his jugular.
“Your wrist,” Castiel clarifies. “Your left wrist is broken.”
Over the course of the next few weeks, Castiel finds that Dean has absolutely no self-preservation skills whatsoever.
anatomy; the way his skin knits itself back together, the way his bones straighten, the cords of his muscles. The knowledge was a requirement after rebuilding him from his time in Hell, and it is only strengthened as Castiel helps heal his wounds over weeks of time.
At one point in the night, Dean rolls onto his back and opens his eyes. Those green galaxies meet Castiel’s gaze, and for a moment, Dean simply blinks up at him, eyes startlingly clear for someone who had just woken up.
Cas' body relaxes. On the screen, a scuba diver swims by an enormous clump of pink honeycomb coral, swaying gently in the water.
Castiel closes his eyes to the sight in front of him.
Dean’s wrists sport third degree burns, the flesh sizzled off and revealing burnt muscle underneath. They’re blackened and charred, bloodied around the edges. Dean is staring at them with a look of withdrawn shock, like he’s not entirely sure what just happened. Sam grips Dean’s hands in his own, looking horrified, already yelling at Bobby to get the first-aid kit.
Castiel grins at him. “Yes.”
Dean gets to his feet, readjusting the gun tucked into the back of his pants, and shakes his head. "Were you?"
They stand in silence for a few minutes. Eventually, Richard lets out a full body shudder, squeezing his eyes shut and turning away from the corpse.
Castiel shouts, appearing without warning as Zachariah pulls the blade back out with a sickly squelching sound. “Dean!”
is. “You are possibly the most idiotic, selfish, ungrateful human I have ever crossed paths with.”
Richard throws him a glare. He gives Henry an indiscernible look- Henry shrugs, and with a heavy sigh, Richard gets to his feet.
It had been slipped under his hotel room door, and he only notices when it is because he’d been in passing to the bathroom. He stands there frowning at it for a minute, as though if he stared hard enough it would magically disappear.
Both of them give him confused looks. Richard raises an eyebrow, looking a bit condescending. "If angels aren't real, what do you think Lucifer is?"
Castiel tilts his head to the side as he considers his answer. “There are not many words to describe the darkness one can encounter in Hell, Dean. You should know this. But,” Castiel continues on when he sees Dean open his mouth to interrupt. “When I found you in Hell it was indescribable. Your soul is brilliant.”
he replies.
Dean, for everything that's happening, does not look at all affected. In fact, he looks almost bored, watching Cas tear apart the hunter's body like some sort of feral animal attack as if it were a normal occurrence.
“Why not?” Castiel asks, curious. “It’s the truth.”
“A crime of passion,” Dean supplies, and he feels Meg shake her head.
The man doesn't respond. The silence is awkward and charged, and the hunter bluffs, taking a step towards the man like it might bully him into speaking. The man does not even blink.
Elijah knows who he is, has heard rumors of what he's done in the past, but he hasn't heard anything new. "Where's his brother?" He murmurs, eyeing the way the barstools to Dean's left and right stay pointedly empty despite the bar being crowded enough to warrant them being taken.
The victim is a middle aged woman with crows feet and bleach blonde hair. Dean tails her to the restaurant she attends with her husband, and he watches everyone they interact with carefully; the hostess who seats them, the busboy who fills their water, the waitress who brings their food, and even the husband's coworker who just so happens to be eating there as well. Dean sees no foul play, doesn’t think any of these people even know he’s been watching them for over six hours today- they were all so blissfully unaware. The Ghost wasn’t striking here.
Dean laughs wetly. “Yeah, but it’s still better than watching you die.”
"Probably the same time you received her name," Castiel answers around the lip of his wine glass. "And I received yours."
“Who the hell are you, and how’d you get in my house?” Bobby demands in a gruff voice.
“Couldn’t,” Dean clarifies. “I can’t feel physical pain.” He pauses, staring at Castiel with an indecipherable expression, before he adds, “You should’ve left me there.”
Finally, it comes out, tumbling from his mouth muffled and warped against the collar of Cas' shirt.
Dean looks at the man, confused, before lowering his gun just the slightest bit. “You’re not a curvy brunette in her 30’s,” He says, which is such a Dean way to greet someone.
Dean’s head jerks back so he can look at Castiel properly, not just through the mirror. His face slides into one that is also carefully composed, his lips pressed thinly together and his brow furrowed. “And? What did the demon say?”
Elijah's head almost cracks with how fast he snaps around, staring at them wide-eyed. "Angels aren't real."
A surge of protectiveness rushes through Castiel’s vessel. It is so strong and sudden that he is sure the other angels can sense it. There’s hushed whispering amongst them, but Castiel can’t focus on them through the abrupt, blind rage that joins the protectiveness. Anger like he’s never known, and the unrelenting desire coursing through his grace to tear whomever hurt Dean atom from atom.
“You stupid, useless human,” Castiel snarls, and he’s shoving Sam out of the way before he can think about it, the younger man stumbling as the angel inserts himself into Dean’s personal space. He can feel his grace thrumming, ferocious and angered, his eyes glowing hot white blue as it tries to contain itself within his vessel. Dean holds his gaze, but cowers slightly, like he’s forgotten what Castiel is, what
“Did you hear that from Sam?” Heaven Castiel asks, thumbing over Dean’s hip and brushing gentle kisses to Dean’s cheeks.
“Hell didn’t affect you,” Castiel says, feeling like he’s missing a significant piece of a jigsaw puzzle. “Why?”
Castiel asks. It’s not the most important question, but a few angels seem suspicious of the origin as well.
Naomi echoes, and Castiel winces at his mistake.
They don't have to wait long. The night sky rumbles, dark and menacing, with thunder from clouds that do not exist. In the backseat of the car, someone sits up, like they were in there the whole time, although Elijah swears the car was empty when they first approached it.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says. “Your work is beautiful, as always.”
Zachariah laughs, and the sound of it makes Castiel uneasy.
Henry snorts into his drink, rolling his eyes. "He doesn't have an angel on a leash."
Dean’s heart skips a beat and thumps loudly in his chest. “That’s high praise coming from you,” He says lamely.
He hovers for a moment above Bobby’s house. He can hear the voices of everyone inside, hear Sam and Bobby’s hushed whispers and the clink of beer bottles in the kitchen, can hear Dean’s gentle, even breathing from the living room. He manifests himself into the living room, just beside Dean’s sleeping form on the couch, and for the first time, takes in his physical form up close.
"Who are you?" The hunter gruffs, puffing out his chest.
Unsure of how to react to this realization, he simply disappears, leaving the brothers blinking in his wake.
Bobby suggests contacting a psychic. Dean seems to think that’s unnecessary and childish; Castiel can’t help but agree. A psychic had once tried to summon him over a hundred and fifty years ago, and she’d ended up a smoking husk of a human after he’d appeared before her.
Dean’s breath catches in his chest. He is visibly trembling, and for a moment, Castiel worries he’s injured. But after a quick check he finds no, he’s not injured anywhere; he seems to be only overcome with emotion.
is the one in need of comfort and not the other way around, that he almost misses the way his grace sings and glows when Dean touches him.
“It’s fucking delicious, is what it is,” Meg says, swallowing loudly for effect.
"Dunno," Richard shrugs. "I heard he couldn't. Locked up too tight down there."
Castiel wrinkles his nose at the nickname. He has never been called that before, but it sounds right coming out of Dean’s mouth, and he finds he doesn’t hate it. In fact, he thinks he likes it.
“Thanks,” He finally says, lamely, and when he looks up Castiel can’t decipher the expression on his face.
Cas is frowning at a map in the front seat, head tilted to the side as he tries to follow the line of a highway with his finger along the paper. Dean glances over at him when they pull up to a stoplight, Baby's engine humming around him like his favorite song. Dean lets himself trace the lines of Cas' face with his eyes, content to just look.
Dean frowns at him. “You know my name.”
"Well, I didn't, but guy I know did," The hunter says. At his table, his other friends look a little embarrassed, sneaking glances at Dean at the bar, who's working his way through his fourth glass of whiskey. Other hunters around them are leaning in, listening with rapt attention. "Little thing. Wears a stupid coat all the time and follows Dean's every order. Guy's seen 'em work their way through a whole vampire nest, just the angel killing on his command. Even got it branded, he does."
A new voice asks. Elijah feels chills run up his spine, and his grip on Richard's wrist tightens.
