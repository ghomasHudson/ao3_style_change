“If you can't keep up, take a seat and let a more talented dancer have the floor,” Rhodey shot back.  He executed a beautiful step, spinning in place as DJ spread his arms out like wings.  “And if you can get him to put a Louis Armstrong album on, all the more power to you.”
Jan grinned.  "Trust me, she can handle it."  She bounced along next to Tony, her feet barely touching the ground.  "Carol and Thor are still on site?"
"I'll leave that to you," Tony said, pouring himself a cup of coffee and digging into his eggs.  "Did you find any good ones?"
DJ looked up as Jarvis approached, his empty plate pushed to the side, a pad of paper braced on the table in front of him instead.  “Mail?” he asked, his tone full of hope, and Tony scowled behind the shield of his paper.
"Slander and lies," Tony said.  "And I'm grieving, there's grief involved, Tater Tots, because I'll never get to see Steve's door in its current state.”
“And that's not possible when I'm talking to you, now is it?” Sam shot back with a wide grin.  He reached past Steve, pushing the door to the locker room open.  “Steve.  Can you slow down?”
"Then best you sit down and clear some space on your plate for it," May said, her voice tart.  She filled a plate with three huge pieces of chicken, pushing it into Steve's hands.  "Would you like a sandwich?  We have tuna, chicken, egg salad, cucumber-"
Jan smiled.  “We’ll mount this.  If someone wants a kiss beneath the mistletoe, they can ring the bells.  If someone wants to give a kiss, they can respond.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, in that particular tone of voice that he used when Tony was being very irrational.  Tony was used to that tone of voice.
“I’m going to regret this,” Peter agreed.  “But I’ll regret it with fifty dollars, and most of the time, let’s be honest, I’m regretting it with zero dollars.”
He stopped, his face crumbling for an instant. For a moment, just a moment, he looked young, and hurt, and heartbroken. He straightened up, and it was gone. “I need you, Tony. I don't have many friends. And you're-” His lips twitched, trying for a smile. “You're the one I depend on.”
“I’m quite impressed,” Mrs. Parker said, holding her hands out to DJ.  “Can you say good night?” she asked.
Time after time, Steve had ridden out ahead, chasing the flight of birds that fluttered through the clear skies above the road, or keeping pace with the hares that darted through the underbrush.  Now and again, he had gone as fast as he could, giving Nomad his head, letting him run as fast as he pleased.  When he reached a fork in the road, or a bend that would take him out of sight, he slowed, savoring the warmth of the sunlight on his face.
Obie shrugged.  “It would do you well, Tony,” he said, his voice arch.  “You need a stabilizing force.  A good woman would help keep you on the straight and narrow.”
"I doubt we'll be seeing much by way of customers until the street is less..."  The man paused, looking out at the street, his mouth tight.  "Less on fire."
Grinning, Tony stuck out a foot, nudging a chess piece under the table. “The mess I made?” he asked.
He stared at the schematic, rage sweeping over him like a wave, gone almost as soon as it hit.  And leaving him exhausted and swaying on his feet.  “Fuck you, Obie.  Fuck you.”
Rhodey’s hand was holding onto his, and there was red on his fingers, on the white cuff of his shirt.  Blood, spattered across his arm, across Tony’s shirt.  Rhodey’s voice, tense and sharp.  “Home.  As fast as you can.”
"That's not really a fair assessment of the situation," Morrison said. He braced a hand on the arm of his chair, leaning into it. "There has to be a consensus, in a society, about what should and should not be discussed publicly. You can't just force your opinions on other people, as to what you can tell their kids."
Miss Van Dyne leaned in.  "That means he HAS candy," she explained in a stage whisper.  "And as soon as dinner is over, we can start hounding him for it."
“You’re going to end up eating her grapes,” Shawn said.  Harris made a face, and Shawn patted him gently on the back.  “They look okay.  I’m going to hit the salad bar.”
Jarvis sighed.  “You tried to follow him.”  Clint gave him a look.  Jarvis shook his head.  “Of course you did.”
“Look, he uploaded a video to YouTube at like, four am, and that’s a time when people make bad choices, and you’re out of town, so I just wanted to make sure that he’s not cheating on you,” Bucky said.
“I don’t know, but considering he kept eye contact with Coulson the entire time he was handing the package over and while Clint was unwrapping it?”  Natasha shrugged.  “I’d say revenge.”
Tony was surprised to find his heart was pounding.  “How did he possibly sleep through all of us running through the grand hall?”
“Annoyed and frustrated?” Tony said, because he didn't want to think about that.  Didn't want to think about Steve, trapped in a chair like this, his stomach churning with fear and anxiety.  Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “Pissed off?”
Trip’s head swung from one to the other and back, fascinated despite her determination to not get involved in this most recent round of crazy.  “I mean, yeah, usually, of you wouldn’t be in a 24 hour wedding chapel,” she pointed out.  “But the requirements in Nevada are pretty-”
Hulk let out a snort that ruffled Gyrich's short hair.  “No Banner,” he rumbled.  “Only Hulk.”  He leaned in, his jaw set at an obstinate angle.  “You.  Go.”
“And unnaturally powerful, I'll have you know,” Jan said.  “I'll send someone over tomorrow with some clothes for DJ, just have him try them and keep whatever you want.”
Jan grabbed the front of his shirt, dragging him in until their noses were almost touching.  “Marry me,” she gritted out at the exact moment the door to the workshop opened.
He scooped up a noodle, his eyes closing as he chewed.  For a long moment, there was silence, as everyone waited for him.  Finally, he opened his eyes, and nodded.  “Goddammit.”
Steve blinked.  “Hi Tony Stark’s Phone,” he replied, a reluctant smile curving his mouth.  “Which sounds a lot like Tony Stark’s Assistant.  This is Tony Stark’s boyfriend.”
He rocked forward, the movement sharp and violent.  “Your job is to feed people.  Your job is to feed anyone, and everyone, who comes through your doors, to the best of your ability.  You want to call yourself a Chef?  Then, fuck you!  Do.  Your.  JOB.”
"Right, you're easily amused, this is good, because two pounds of frozen blueberries can distract you for like six hours and god knows I need those six hours." Tony pointed at the blender, and DJ was off like a shot, bare feet pounding over the concrete floor.  Halfway there, Butterfingers rolled into his path, and DJ jumped up, grabbing hold of the bot's support strut and pulling himself up.  Butterfingers, apparently pleased with his new burden, continued on his way with DJ still hanging from his arm.
Nine and a half minutes later, he stepped off the elevator into the lobby, knotting the scarf around his neck as he walked.  He waved at the security guards.  “How's things out there?” he called.
“If that means you'll leave?” Tony said, giving him a vicious smile.  “Yes.  I am.  Get out.  And if you have any problems with the situation, you can take them up with Fury.  But unless he comes down here to reinforce the status quo?”  Tony leaned in.  “I'm in charge.”
Steve gave him a look, but it was tempered with a slight smile.  "You could ask," he said.  "Unless you'd like to continue wasting time?"
“Excellent, get right on that, but first.”  He strode across the room, his head up.  “Jarvis.  Can we run a scan here, because I think my entire team appears to have been replaced by pod people or life model decoys or-” He pointed at Bruce.  “Banner.  Really, I expected this from Cage and Danvers, but you?  You?”
Tony took a breath, steadying the erratic beat of his heart.  “Is that how you seal your deals, Rogers?” he asked, and he was proud of himself, the words were steady and calm.  Almost amused.  “With a kiss?”
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “And that-”  His fingers went to fists and he shook them out, trying to get rid of some of the tension in his arms.  “I started having, uh, dreams, about-”  He stopped.  “Dreams-”
The metal melted away, peeling back in a silent rush, revealing a face that was almost, just almost, familiar.
The massive fireplace was swept clean, but there was a fresh pile of logs stacked on the hearth.  Grateful for that small mercy, Tony grabbed a few, tossing them into place before reaching for the kindling.  Starting a fire was tedious, cold fingers fumbling on the matches and the newspaper, but he was nothing if not stubborn.  And cold.
With a sigh, he sat up, shoving a hand through his hair and squinting at the clock next to his bed.  Too early to get up.  Which had never stopped him before, and it wasn’t going to stop him now.  He rolled out of bed, kicking the pillow into the wall with a great deal of gusto.
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing to thank me for,” he said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed again.  He studied Tony’s sleeping face, loving him so much it hurt.  “I should never have left.”  He shoved a hand through his hair, frustration tearing through him.  “Or maybe I never should’ve come back.”
“Any good?” Tony asked him, and DJ nodded.  “What happens in Vegas is carbs, I suppose.”  Tony took the bowl from him, dumping a healthy portion of fried potatoes, onions and peppers onto his plate.  He’d get to the fruit salad right after he finished them.  And also some more bacon.  He glanced over his shoulder.  “How’d it go, champ?”
"No," he said, cutting her off.  She pouted in his general direction, and Stark rolled his eyes.  "I know that you think all men are weak to your charms, but I am not going to fall for that, so just-”
Steve looked up at the sky.  “Yes.”  It tasted like a lie on his tongue, and it must’ve sounded like one, too, because Tony just nodded, a muscle in his jaw twitching.
Ellen tossed it back in the general direction of her inbox.  “But no.  Nothing personal.”  She glared at her computer monitor, where Tony Stark was charming the pants off of a room full of reporters who really should've known better.  “Just Mr. Razzle Dazzle doing his usual softshoe.”
Steve went back to staring at the path.  “I cannot wait for you to get your comeuppance, you know that?”
She paused.  “You didn't used to be,” she agreed.  She folded her legs beneath her, one pale foot tucked neatly under her knee.  “You like schedules.  You like to know when things are happening, and where you should be, don't you?”
“We're done,” Pepper agreed. “Ladies, gentlemen, if I could have a word with you later on this afternoon, I'd appreciate it.” She headed for the door, herding the legal team along with her.
There was a flash of light and a sizzle, like a piece of wet vegetation trying and failing to catch fire.  Harris could smell something like a crackle, like the scent of burning ozone, like burning hair.
“It was an entire pie,” Clint said.  The eggs were crackling in the pan, and he gave it a shake, the flames licking at the sides of the skillet. “You've got an empty leg, kid.”
The elevator doors opened, and Steve paused just enough to kick his shoes off.  “Did he sleep at all?” he asked, heading up the hallway.
“Yes, you can, but you could also get an idea of taking revenge on Happy for his spontaneous change of plans tonight by running over something he likes or needs.  Like his foot,” Bobbi said.
“Guess the ghost probably won’t snore as badly as Steve does,” Bucky said, and Steve flicked his reins in his direction.  Laughing, Bucky held up a hand to ward him off.  “Truth hurts, don’t it?”
“Anything,” Steve said, and it came out in a shout that echoed around the massive hall, swirling around them like a condemnation.  Steve stopped, his chest expanding as he sucked in a breath.  And another.  He shook out his hands, and let them fall back to his sides.  “Anything is more productive than banging my head up against this particular stubborn, foolhardy, short-sighted wall.”
“The instructor was very attractive,” Steve said, because that was safe, that was a person he’d never have to see or deal with again.  He rolled his shoulders.  “I just…  Wasn’t expecting that.”
“Last week,” Obie said, sipping his whiskey.  “So far, it’s going well, but we’re going to have to talk to our steel supplier, what we’re getting isn’t worth the price we’re paying.”
She leaned her chin on her knees. “I'm sorry,” she whispered. “I shouldn't have pushed. I just...” Her lips pursed. “I just wanted you to have an actual wedding reception. With the people who love you. Who want you to be happy.” Her eyelashes fluttered against the pink curves of her cheeks. “But I should've listened, when you told me no.”
“Yeah, considering.” Fury leaned forward, folding his arms on the table in front of him.  “Phil says you had a bad time at Dr. Strange’s place.”
“Are we really selfieing this?” Tony asked him, but he smiled anyway.  Then he took the phone out of Steve's hand, turning to the girls who'd gotten him into this mess.  “Picture?” he asked, holding it up, and the tall one took it with a pleased smile and an enthusiastic nod.
Tony's head bobbed in something like a nod, and his fingers fumbled at the hem of his shirt.  “Okay,” he said, the word pulled like taffy from his lips, slow and sweet.  Before Steve could stop him, he stripped the t-shirt over his head, the fabric sliding over his skin.  The shirt fluttered to the floor, and Tony leaned back, his back arching as he ran a hand through his hair.
“Thanks for the story, your highness, time for you to be off,” Bucky said, taking her bowl out of her hands.  “Before Okoye comes looking for you.”
“The results weren't optimal, no,” Sam said, wandering over to take a seat on Steve's other side. His shoulder bumped Steve's, and Steve leaned into him.
“That's your first mistake,” Tony said, letting Pepper pull him towards the stairs that lead down to the kitchen.  He waited until Obie was out of earshot, then leaned towards her, pitching his voice low.  “When, exactly, did I agree to this?”
Hands closed on Tony’s shoulders, his arms, dragging him up, pulling DJ out of his grip.  He screamed, something vicious and obscene, and it was no use, he couldn’t stop them, couldn't stop them, couldn’t stop anything, he was bleeding, he was dying-
Steve blinked at him.  “It's a door, Tony.  I don't think we need an entire crew.  I wouldn't even need him if I didn't have to take it off the hinges.”
“Yes.  Keep the front door locked.  If anyone comes in that isn’t Hammer, if someone tries to force the door, or if you smell smoke, take the other boys and go out the back.  Straight down the alley north to St. Mary’s.  Father Kimball’ll do a lot of yelling, but he’ll let you in.  Stay there until I send someone for you.”
Tony paused.  "I honestly don't know," he said, his hands propped on his hips.  "I just know that there's china.  And some of it is 'good.'"  He looked at Steve.  "That's what the caterers use when I'm throwing a sit down dinner party."
“Yes, ma’am,” he said, scrubbing the back of his wrist across his nose.  “Yes.  I’ll-”  He nodded.  “Yes, ma’am.”
Steve didn’t ask who ‘they’ were.  “No, not necessarily.  It’s pretty common for kidnappers to wait to make contact.  Drives up the stress, and lets people talk.  The more family involved, the greater the chance they’ll find someone willing to pay what they want.”
“Right,” Steve said.  “Right.  I think-”  He stopped, a pounding at the hotel room door interrupting him mid-sentence.  “And that’s either the most enthusiastic hotel cleaning staff ever, or Isaiah is here to yell at me to get my ass in gear.”
“Did you get close enough to hear them?” Bobbi asked, folding her arms on the banister.  She leaned forward, one booted foot tapping against the floor.  “What are they fighting about now?
“No.”  The word came out of him, vicious and cold and very quiet.  Which didn't matter, because every other member of his team had apparently reached the same conclusion at the same moment.
“The-” Tony turned back towards the hall just in time to see the potted plant in the corner make a scooting movement sideways.  “Right.  Herd him towards the billiard room?”
“Everything is a bit easier to take when you have a bit of something familiar in your belly,” Jarvis said.  He stepped around Tony, straightening his lapels.  “So if nothing else on the table looks or tastes familiar, he doesn't have to be afraid.  He doesn't have to be hungry.”
DJ smiled, peeking out with one eye as Steve herded Tony and Clint back into their dining room, his expression exasperated.  Clint had a tower of corn dogs on a plate, the pile wobbling with every step.  Tony had a cup of coffee and a slice of pie.  “I’m just saying-”
For a while, they just played, with Tony trying to coax DJ into making a good move.  He failed more than he succeeded, but he just kept trying.  “What’s our move?” Tony asked, and DJ just twisted around with a yawn, burying his face in Tony’s chest.  Tony tipped his head to the side.  “General?”
“Still my damn wedding,” Stark pointed out, throwing his arms across the back of the pew.  Next to him, Rogers ducked his head forward, not quite fast enough to hide his smile.
“I had quite forgotten about the time you chose to raise bullfrogs in your mother’s fountain,” Jarvis said.  “And the night when they escaped into the great hall and then down into the kitchens, causing half the maids to quit in less than an hour.”  He paused.  “Including the chef and the entire kitchen staff.”
Clint unleashed a barrage of terrible fake French that still managed to convey that he was reluctant to let Tony start disassemble anything in his kitchen and also that he was more than willing to start stabbing if Tony persisted with doing so.  Tony pointed at him.  “How dare you talk like that in front of an impressionable young man?” he asked.  He looked over his shoulder.  “DJ, cover Peter’s ears, he shouldn’t have to hear this.”
Tony didn't respond to the question.  He just looked back at the red carpet, where Namor and his people were taking their time upstaging the surface dwellers. "Marcy."
“Then he should not have annoyed the man responsible for keeping the doors locked,” Jarvis said.  “Luckily for sir, I do have a spare set.”  He gestured to the kitchen door.  “I shall wait up.  The rest of you, get some sleep.  I expect you to be at your posts at the normal hour tomorrow.”
Bucky snickered, and Sam stood up with a sigh, moving to sit next to Steve.  Grinning, Steve moved over to let him take a seat on the rock.
“I can call Nat, though,” Clint said, tucking the bottle into the crook of his arm so he could grab the chopsticks out of the lo mein.  “She can.”
“Didn’t have a clue,” Clint agreed.  “But he gestured at the door, and Nat got off of the shelves, and we were force marched out of the library, down the main stairs, down the back stairs, and into the kitchen.  Stark’s got the vase in the crook of one arm and the gun in the other, and he’s chattering away in French the entire time.
DJ gave a pleased nod.  There was dirt on his forehead, on the side of his jaw, his fingers caked with soil.  His feet were bare, and he left small, damp dirty footprints behind him on the slate.
Tony would've laughed, but there was nothing funny about this.  “That doesn't change the fact that it's a pit right now,” he pointed out, and God, Steve smelled good.  He nuzzled at Steve's neck, breathing in the scent of skin and soap and...  “Did you make spaghetti sauce today?”
“For you,” DJ repeated, tapping Thor on the head with the box.  Laughing, Thor put him down and took it.
The ceiling collapsed in a rush, the wood and stone and plaster shattering to pieces as Clea fell through.  She tumbled through the air, her hands throwing off a shower of sparks, and disappeared through the floor.  The ceiling swirled back into place, leaving only a faint hint of dust in the air.
“Put on some tight jeans and a pair of boots and we'll talk,” Tony said.  “Jan, who are all these people?”
Trip looked at the kid, who was still studying the chapel.  His hands were now braced in the front pocket of the hoodie, dragging the fabric down.  “Not important.”
“I do not lay the blame entirely at his door, but, yes.  He’s made quite a mess of it,” Jarvis said.  He huffed out a breath.  “All that work.  All that careful work by every member of this household, and he offers the man a job.”
Steve felt his face heat.  “Yeah, that's...”  He let out a wry laugh.  “That's not going to happen, Sam, I'm not-”  He stopped, and held up a hand.  “We're not discussing this.”
“What do you expect me to do?” Tony asked, his brow furrowing.  “I don’t suppose you’ve noticed, but I haven’t a coin to my name, Jan, it’s not like I can-”  She was smiling up at him, and Tony’s stomach sank. “No.”
“She used to talk about the old things that lived in the wood, the fair folk.  The old ones.  And they'd take those who were caught alone, or unaware.  They'd take children from their cradles, or travelers from the road.  Some'd be back in a few days, some in a few minutes.  Some never came back at all, but those who did...”
“Right.  Hiding in his office slash storage closet again, I assume,” Tony said, tapping his tablet against his other hand.  “Is he sleeping on the couch?”
"He holds a grudge, it's true," Tony said. Jarvis, anticipating what he was going to do, had the elevator doors open, and he jogged through. "I look like I was dragged through a grease trap backwards; I have to shower, when is this shitshow happening?"
He was halfway to the bathroom when he realized that Tony's phone was still vibrating, the buzzing almost lost in the fabric of his coat.  Frowning, Steve reached for it, suddenly worried if there was a problem back at TOBRU.  But the number on the face wasn't Bruce or the restaurant.  Instead, the lock screen said “DJ.”
Tony almost could.  “I’m not sure I’m willing to secure a church just so you can taunt my business manager,” he said.
“Could’ve sworn I did,” Tony said, but his smile was tight now.  Thin.  “Didn’t realize anyone was paying attention.”
Steve stared at him, his pulse still pounding in his ears.  “He’s fine?  What do you mean, ‘he’s fine’?”
"Right," Steve said, and he hung up, because that was mature.  Because he was mature.  And he regretted it the immediately.  Because this room was very empty and very stark and felt very expensive.  It was the kind of room that Tony fit into without even trying.  Tony, suave and collected and sophisticated, who made things easier for Steve without even trying.  Tony, who made things feel comfortable, feel natural.
“Just a little,” DJ said, as Steve walked back to the head of the bed, taking a seat next to Tony.  He moved one of the pillows out of the way, leaning up against the headboard.
“Ooo, I know a few high status ladies who would be happy to lower themselves to your level,” Jan said.  She fluttered her eyelashes.  “All, all, AAAAAALL the way down.”
Rogers nodded.  “Yes.  It was.”  He leaned back.  “I read it, you know, it was very well done.”  He smiled.  “I liked it, actually.  It was…” He looked up at her.  “Kind.”
“Except he ended up here,” Wanda said.  She played with threads of light in midair, her fingers moving idly through the air.  “And you haven’t brought him back, why?”
“I think that's my line,” Steve said.  He raised his hand, opening his fingers to let the wind catch the petals.  They swirled around the table, disappearing over the edge of the into the sunlit sky beyond the wrought iron fence.
“No, but he’s a natural salesman, when he believes in the product,” Sam said.  He started moving forward again, and this time, it was up to Steve to catch up.  Sam gave him a look over his shoulder.  “He seems to think you’re boyfriend material.”
Clint wandered into the kitchen, wearing a pair of sweatpants, a button-down dress shirt, and one sock.  Carol leaned back in her chair, her head tipping in his direction.  “Hey, Clint?”
“What the hell am I fired from?” Sam asked, and Steve was laughing. He didn't know why he was laughing, but he was. Sam glanced at him, his expression worried. For some reason, that only made Steve laugh harder. “Steve? Buddy? You okay, man?”
One hand slid across the width of the bed, looking for something he couldn’t quite remember, but when he didn’t find it, the sense of loss was staggering.
His eyebrows arched.  “And right now, I want to go down there, but I can't, because-”  He gestured at the photographer.  “I have to get my picture taken.   If you can help me with that, maybe you could come down with me?”
"I was in college, and it was the least of my scandals at the time," Tony said.  He pushed himself upright.  "I was used to it.  Like you said.  Lots of experience."
Halfway to the elevators, he paused, his head swiveling in the direction of the coffee shop.  He couldn't see the boy through the lobby windows, and wondered if he was still there.  Maybe he'd taken a breakfast sandwich and left.  Maybe he was sitting at one of the corner tables, taking advantage of the warmth until the morning chill had burned off.  Steve wondered if he should've asked the boy what his name was.
There was an aching note to Steve's voice, words full of yearning, of memory.  Tony let his eyes slip shut, let the vibration of Steve's voice slide over his skin, into his very bones.
“Yes,” he said.  “You, too.”  He leaned over the desk, looking at the computer screen.  “Can you do it?”
Still drying off his chest, he squinted down at the text.  “They’re back.  Stay there.” he read aloud, hoping that it would make more sense.  It didn’t.  Water dripped from his hair down onto the face of his phone, and he wiped it away with an impatient swipe of one thumb.
“No, as a matter of fact, you bit me,” Bucky said, pushing himself to his feet.  He collected his bowl, and tossed Steve’s on top of it.  “Still got the scar.”
Steve stared at him, and Nicholas chuckled.  “You always were one for a straight frontal assault,” he said, his voice warm.  “How did you survive a war?”
“Right.  Right.  Same here.  Anything you’d like to talk about?” he asked, reaching for the Goldfish again.  Harris handed them over. “Because all the questions that are springing to mind aroe about your father and I think I’m trying to use it as a diviniation method of how to deal with my own-”
“That you could alter your code,” Tony said, and DJ nodded.  Tony cupped a hand over his mouth.  “Grounded.”
The video started with a rattle of static and the sound of someone saying, “-Probably isn’t a good idea, maybe-”
“We’ll wait until he’s not looking,” Tony said to the cat in a stage whisper, rattling the newspaper in front of him. Furbro opened one golden eye, peering at Tony over the fluff of his tail, and Tony shrugged.   “What?  It has to happen eventually.”
The kitchen door opened, and Jarvis slipped in, an envelope in his hand.  “Thank you for waiting.  Your reply,” he said, holding it out to Mickey, who scrambled up so fast that he almost overturned his stool.  “Please take care returning to the office.”
He doubted that would happen.  But strangely enough, he also believed she was going to try.  There was a sort of sincerity to her, maybe it was the stubborn line of her jaw, or the way she looked at him, without disdain or pity or judgment.  She was a strange one, but he'd known a lot of tough women in his life.  His neighborhood was full of them, and she didn't seem so different, despite her fancy clothes and fancier manners.
Tony rocked back in his seat.  “So.  You guys.  You keep doing what you’re doing, we’re good.  You’ve got a hard job and ninety-nine percent of you are rocking it every step of the way, I’m proud of you, because, honestly?  Honestly?” He tossed a hand up in a half-shrug.  “Sometimes, you just have to go to Olive Garden.”
He had a sudden and overwhelming vision of Steve in one of StarkIndustries more formal and overwhelming board rooms, the table piled high with profit and loss statements and charts showing a failing business.  But Steve was grinning at him, rough and wicked, his fingers wrapping around Tony's tie and tugging him forward, confident in his ability to secure continued funding, despite all financial sense.
“Would you have had him walk?” Jarvis asked, an acidic note to the words.  He picked up Tony’s dinner plate.  “Ah, I see we are drinking our dinner tonight.  What a wonderful choice, sir.”
"It's disingenuous, that's all I'm saying."  Steve slapped the menu down.  "In any case.  I already ordered."
Mrs. Arbogast caught his shoulder, her hand falling in exactly the same spot that Obie’s had.  Tony wondered why it felt completely different.  “Tomorrow,” she said, smiling just a little.
The holograms lit her pale hair, casting icy shadows over her face.  “I think you are a man who is very well acquainted with fear,” she said, her voice soft.  “A man who has lived with fear, for his entire life.  After all, that is the curse of brilliance, is it not?  The average person walks the street, comfortable in their ignorance.  Something beyond their vision may kill them, but they’ll sleep peacefully until it does.
Steve looked up.  Mrs. O’Malley was standing on the sidewalk in front of their building, her youngest cradled against her chest, a shawl wrapped around them both against the evening chill.  She looked tired, her thin face drawn tight, but she smiled easily at Steve as he approached, bouncing the baby in her arms.  “Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” she said, and Steve couldn’t help but smile back.
Steve blinked, and realized that he was crying.  He shook his head, reaching up to swipe up his cheeks.  “I'm fine,” he said, with a slightly wobbly smile.  “I'm just fine.”
Steve's stomach rumbled, and he nodded.  “Any of that,” he said.  “And a cup of coffee, if I could.”
Tony took a deep breath and let it out.  His eyes were stinging, and he didn’t want to examine why, whether this was grief or relief, or something else entirely.  He’d thought he knew loss, in all its myriad forms, but this was new, for all that it was familiar.
Steve grinned.  “Probably.”  He braced his hands on the bench, leaning back.  “Just so you know, I have sketchbooks of you, too.”
Tony’s head tipped forward, his dark eyes glinting under the line of his brows.  “Darling, it’s been three days since we’ve been in the same city and you’re so wound up that you’re almost vibrating in place.”  His lips twitched up in a slight, knowing smile.  “Pretty sure me getting my hands on your cookies is a sure thing.”
“Yeah, but most of them are beneficial,” Clint pointed out.  He folded his arms on the wall, leaning into them.  “And most of them, we don't want the police involved.”
“Thank you, James, thank you, the only real friend I have, the only voice of reason in a world gone mad, really, I am grateful for your-”
“Charming.”  Tony made a face, then twisted around, his body rolling away from Steve's  “Don't answer that.”
"Well, the paint job alone," Clint said, his voice laconic and amused.  "You never did strike me as a man who favored pink."
“I think-” The shutter clicked again, and he stopped, sighing. “Want me to make a face or something?”
“Too close?  Too big?”  DJ nodded.  “Was it too-”  Tony  stopped, trying to find the way to phrase it.  “Was it too much, all at once, for you to handle?”
“Well, since you’ve been dead for almost fifty years?”  Nicholas took a sip from his tankard.  “Wasn't really expecting Wilson to come back with anything other than an apology.”  The tankard thumped against the tabletop.  “But since you’re here, I think it’s time for some plain words.”
The more they talked about this, the less Tony wanted to talk about this.  He looked at the window.  “Shouldn’t we have heard from them by now?”
He could’ve made the trip from the old workshop up to the main floor with his eyes closed.  He had done almost that often enough in the past, sneaking along the hallways and down the old stone stairs in the dark, trying to avoid prying eyes.  At some point, he’d memorized the number of steps from the workshop door to the bottom of the stairs, the number of stairs to the main floor, the length of the hallway to the kitchen, to the parlor, to the music room, to the grand ballroom, to the dining room.
“Great, we’ll be able to send you back, except we won’t, because you’ll be in jail,” Harris said.  “Wonderful.”  He looked at Darcy.  “No heists.”
“Information no one needed,” Pepper told him, trying her best to keep a straight face.  “So.  It would appear you’re not the only one making a spectacle of himself.”
“Yeah, how long have we known each other?  You know that's not going to happen.”  Ellen made a face.  “I'm not going into a battle of wits with Tony Stark without a lot of cue cards, you know why?”
Tony was aware, on some level, of Peter leaving, but May was still there, her attention on him now, her face unreadable as she stared him down.  Tony held up a hand  “I know, I know, I overstepped, it’s not my place to discipline him, that’s-  He’s your nephew, and I apologize for-”
“Yes,” she said.  “And to be honest, we’re still not sure what broke the spell.  Whether it was something we did, or just time running short on the spell’s effectiveness, but one day, it just-” She stopped, her eyebrows pulling up tight.  As quickly as it had come, the expression disappeared.  “Cracked,” she said, turning her attention to her meal.  “Right through the heart of it.”
Steve’s head jerked around, but DJ was still lying on the lawn, one hand held up above him, his fingers flexing as he considered the night sky.  Reassured, Steve looked back at Tony.  “No.”
“Mom says I'm very mature for my age,” Val said, her chin up.  “She never says that about you.  Have you noticed that?”  Her eyelashes fluttered.  “I've noticed that.”
Tony’s eyes closed.  “Gentle,” he said, the word coming out on a sigh, and Steve realized he was smiling.
Stepehn looked up.  “What?”  He looked back down at the watch.  “Oh.  Yes.”  His hand closed, and it dissipated, light trickling through his fingers for an instant before going dark.    He looked up.  “I need to speak to an old friend, and I suspect you would not want me to do so here.”
“Oh, pop culture mockery and pre-apocalyptic partying, that’s good, I can work with that,” Drew said, folding his hands together and cracking his fingers.  “Let’s do this thing.”
"DJ and I discussed the etiquette of the situation with him," Thor said.  Tony gave him a look, and Thor grinned at him.  "He has promised to be an ideal guest."
“She married someone else,” Steve said, and he had no idea why he was saying any of this.  But it was like poking a bruise, to see if it still hurt.  To see if the ache was finally passing.
“If you say so, Phil.”  She braced her hands on her hips.  “I’ll call your mother back and let her know she can cancel the plane tickets.”
He exhaled, his breath warm against Steve’s skin, and Steve shuddered.  “And you’ve been spending more and more time wandering around Brooklyn in the classic ‘no one would ever guess I’m Captain America’ disguise of sunglasses, hat and hoodie.”
“Well, in Tony’s defense, it’s worked out remarkably well for him.  I can’t blame him for going with a winning formula,” Rhodey said.  Across the room, DJ had managed to hook his foot into the strap of Steve’s bag, pulling it across the polished floor, as if he could hold Steve here by hiding his things.  Judging by the slight smile on Steve’s face, it wasn’t going to work, but Rhodey admired the kid’s moxie.
Sam looked at the box.  Looked at him, his eyebrows arching.  “Has…  Has no one given you a Christmas present before, Tiny Tim?”
“Two, Phil’s problem,” Fury said, and Harris flinched.  “So those are your choices, Mr. MacIntyre.”  He raised one hand.  “A Stark.”  He held up the other, like a scale seeking balance.  “Or a Coulson.”
“You do that,” Steve said, his eye caught by a familiar form cutting his way across the parking lot at a hard jog, his kitchen whites bright in the low light of the streetlamps.  As the woman wandered away, Peter darted up to Steve's window, his breath coming in quick bursts.
“He's having a pretty bad day,” Bruce said with a slight smile.  “And if you don't want to have a worse one? I'd suggest you leave quietly.”
Steve smoothed a hand over his head.  “Would you blush and stammer like a schoolboy?” he asked, and there was laughter in his voice.
Sam shrugged.  “Look, I'll be honest, as your friend, I don't think you should sleep with him until you get this whole thing straightened out.”  He stopped.  “So to speak.”
“I'll take them off your hands,” Pepper offered.  She reached for them and Tony moved them out of reach.
“It's lovely,” Pepper said, without missing a beat.  “You should consider shorter suitjackets to really show it off.”
“I never want breakfast,” Tony said, throwing an arm over his face.  “Let’s just stay here and open presents in bed.”
“It might happen!  I might do it!” Tony turned the sink on with a sharp jerk of his hand.  “God help me, that might be my only chance of survival here, starting a moral crusade against Captain America's goddamn fucking indecent short shorts.”  He shoved his head back under the tap, letting the icy water sluice over his head and shoulders.  It didn't help.
“No,” Pepper said again, her voice dire.  “No.  The two of you are not allowed to go out alone.  With Steve?  Sure.  With Bruce?  Absolutely.  With Thor or Nat or Clint-”  She stopped.  “Actually no.  Not with Clint.”
“Is he-” Steve stopped, hand his arm tightened on Tony’s waist, his fingers sinking in, clutching, desperate, and Tony’s reached for it, covering Steve’s hand with his.  “He’s safe.”
“He’s a practical man,” Natasha said with a smile.  “It was there.  He was tired.  Probably seemed almost logical at the time.  He’s a special boy.”
Natasha gave him a look, and he shoved a piece of toast into his mouth, his eyebrows bouncing up. "Officer Rogers, Bobbi Morse.  Bobbi, Officer Rogers."
"NING!" Duck's voice rang out over the newsroom floor. She glanced over to find him standing in the door of his office, one hand braced against the wood. "My office. Now."
“Aw, isn't that cute?” Tony asked, tucking his hands in his pockets.  “He thinks I have friends.”  One last grin and a flick of a salute, and he headed for the door.  “Good day, gentlemen and ladies.  Stay warm.”
Tony looked at Peter.  "Cat," Peter agreed.  Tony didn't break eye contact, and one of Peter's shoulders rose in a half shrug.  "I'm...  Sure it's a cat."
“We'll pencil that in,” Tony said, and his head was spinning, heat and something like euphoria rolling over him in a wave. It was a possibility. It was something that could happen. A first anniversary. If he played his cards right, he could actually-
“I consider myself to be ready for all contingencies, but I’ll admit, it wasn’t something I’d anticipated,” Bobbi admitted.
The kiss went on and on, and he was drowning in it, he was losing his mind, he was losing everything, and he didn’t care.  And when Tony’s mouth finally pulled away from his, he was breathing hard, gasping against the plane of Steve’s check, his jaw, his neck.  Steve let his head fall back, somehow not surprised to find himself on the floor, Tony half straddling his legs.
He lunged for DJ, who backpedaled, almost crashing into Steve’s legs.  Steve made a grab for him, and so did Tony, but DJ slipped out of reach, ducking under their arms.  Tony crashed into Steve’s chest, and they both froze, face to face and chest to chest, and DJ grabbed the newel post, swinging himself around and hopping down the steps.
“Hawkeye gives everyone a nickname, but they’re not usually fit for polite company.”  Natasha rotated the wheel, pulling the car around another corner.  “Then again.  “I suspect he already has one.”
“This is something that’s bad, but not…  Not that bad,” Tony said.  “She’ll fix it before the party even starts, and be able to relax.”  He smiled.  “Right now, if she had sleeves, she’d be rolling them up.”
“'Blow up the missile, Iron Man,'” Tony said, wheeling his way down towards the warehouse floor.  Someone shot at him, and he let off a repulsor blast without even looking in that direction.  “'Fix the hole in the fabric of space and time, Iron Man.'  'Find out if that'll kill us, Iron Man.'”
Anything Steve could've said to that would've come out wrong, and he beat a hasty retreat, the fabric of his jacket balled tight between his fingers.  He stalked through the bedroom, trying not to look at the tumbled blankets of he bed and the discarded clothes on the floor.  He didn't need any more fodder for his fevered dreams.
Rhodey, two steps behind them, was shaking his head.  “You’re an idiot,” he told Clint.  “You’re…”  He looked at Tony.  “How did this become my job?”
Sam gave him a look.  “And you keep doing it.”  Steve nodded again.  Sam's head fell forward in a nod.  “Right, right.” He glanced up.  “Next time, I'm letting you fall.”
She tried not to laugh.  “The numbers?  You mean, like, the odds?”  The kid nodded, and Trip pulled up the booking calendar.  “And if there’s ever a place that can tip the odds in your favor, I guess it’s Vegas.”  She looked from him to the blonde man and back.  “When are we rolling the dice on this?”
“And I’m probably going to shoot you this time,” Carol said.  She shrugged.  “I never said I was good.  I said I was enthusiastic.”
He took a seat at the bottom of the stairs, his elbows braced on his knees.  “He does that sometimes, but he’s always back by now.”  He squinted up at Steve, his eyebrows arched.  “You showing up seems bad, but not as bad as someone from the Board of Orphanages.” His toe bounced against the worn wood of the stairs.  “He dead?”
Trip’s eyes scanned the room.  “Does anyone present have any objections to the joining of these two people?”
“Hey, now, what-” Before he could lose something, he tossed back the rest of his drink, swallowing it in two quick gulps.  The warmth hit him almost immediately, curling through him as he threw the cup at a nearby trash can.  “Okay.  What are you doing?” he asked one of the girls.  She pointed at him, and plucked at the cuff of his tux jacket.  “Oh, you like my clothes?  Great.  Me, too, but-”
“Oh, Deej.”  Steve hugged him tight.  “He’s right here.  Promise.”  DJ nodded against Steve’s chest, and Steve smiled down at him.  “Want me to wake him?”
He could feel the pull, even as he set his foot on the first step, on the second, on the third.  The sound of his footsteps disappeared first, never reaching his ears, never escaping the pull of that darkness.  He ducked down, beneath the level of the floor, his eyes wide, trying desperately to see something beyond the reach of his hands.
Clea held her hand out to the side, and the scroll rolled itself up to float over her palm.  “Why in the name of the seven hosts would you bring someone else from our dimension here?”
Natasha gave a whistle, and he opened his mouth.  She tossed a sugar cube into his mouth.  “He’s right,” she said, flicking grains of sugar from her fingertips.  “As a recruiting tactic, seduction isn’t always effective.”
Peter obligingly put his hands over his ears, and Tony’s eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.  “Parker.  Not you.” He pointed at DJ, who was taking in this new development with his usual wide eyed curiosity.  “DJ.”
"Of course, sir," Jarvis said.  He glanced at Steve, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips.  "If you'll follow me, Officer Rogers, I'll show you to a guest room."
Down at the edge of the garden, the cop was crouched at the gate, his fingers smoothing over the wall.  Natasha watched as he rubbed his fingers together, his head coming up.  She looked at Clint, who shrugged, taking the jam back from Happy.  “Keep him out of the greenhouse,” he said, tipping the jar back, pouring the last of the jam into his mouth.  “At all costs.”
“A normal Tuesday for me,” Harris said to DJ, who smiled at him around the stem of his spoon.  Before he could say anything, Wanda ducked back into their private dining room, a plate in each hand.  Harris craned his head, looking behind her.  “Clint and Tony still out there?”
“Do you think they missed something?” Stark asked, and it wasn't as sarcastic or cutting as Steve expected it to be.  Just mildly curious.
Steve watched him, relaxing by stages.  “You’re good at that,” he said, as Jarvis slipped Tony’s second shoe off, settling his foot back on the bed.
Clint braced his hands on the counter, leaning into them.  “Stark is bored by anything he understands.  He’s bored by almost everything, so if you can just…  Make him think, even for a minute, even for a second, you’ve got an in.  He’ll look at you different.  You’re…  Interesting.”  He rocked back on his heels.  “If you can get his attention, he’s-”
"Yeah, but that was, what, twelve fifty?  Thirteen dollars?" Tony asked, and it wasn't funny, it really wasn't.  But his voice was warm and familiar and Steve loved him so much it hurt.
"It's not so fond of you, either, buddy," he said.  He maneuvered Tony onto the couch.  "But I love you both, so guess what?"
“As is his right, as the house’s cat,” Mrs. Parker said.  She fluffed Steve’s pillows.  “I’ve always wanted one.  But Mr. Stark seemed quite set against animals.”  She straightened up.  “I find I’m quite pleased with the changes DJ has made to the household already.”
“Excuse me, I am a mature and intelligent woman, he's a five year old,” Jan said.  She aimed a tiny fist at his shoulder. “Jerk.”
“Hey, Clint?”  She switched hands, still holding onto his like a lifeline.  “If something goes wrong, will you-”
"My reaction was similar but a bit more..."  Tony made a considering noise under his breath.  "Slightly more spicy."
Steve froze on the step, one hand grabbing the banister.  "Is it now."  He looked up, then back down.  "Thank you for letting me know, before anyone else, Mrs. O'Malley.  I'll see it's taken care of."
“TechWire didn't get it, he's asking-” Tony turned back to the mic.  “Yes.  I am married.  I married Steven Grant Rogers in Symkaria, on our way back from an official trip to Latvaria.”
"Where-"  Tony spread his hands.  "Where are you going to find this mythical, unicorn like reporter?"
He picked up a nut and rolled it across the workbench towards DJ.  It bounced its way across the metal surface and DJ leaned over, waiting until it slowed almost to a stop before he picked it up.  Tony folded his arms on the top of the bench, content to watch DJ turn the small bit of metal over and over between his fingers.  “It’s nice to have someone around who appreciates the little things in life,” he said, and DJ nodded, his attention still focused on the nut.
"You don't know.  There might be someone in the pantry.  Will you check?" She set the ledger in her hands down next to her cup, and reached for the tea pot.  "And bring out the basket of scones if your hands aren't occupied with invaders."
“Oh!” Steve tried to get out of the way, and somehow ended up bumping into him instead.  The young man staggered backwards, grabbing for the doorframe, and Steve caught his arm, steadying him.  “Sorry.  I didn’t-”
He looked at it, his expression suspicious.  But he reached out to take it anyway.  "Sure.  Options are good."
“Someone’s already gone,” the boy said, looking down at the man.  He looked quesy.  “An’ the manager called, from the house phone.  They’ll come, right soon.”
When the cushions were clear, he grabbed a pillow and blanket, and shifted DJ into a fully prone position.  “There you go,” he said, but it was still wrong.  He crouched down next to the couch, his fingers pushing DJ's hair back.   He looked so young still, but Tony could see the hints of the adult he'd become in his face, and it hurt.
“My ma raised me right, I guess,” Bucky said.  He balanced the plate on his hip.  “Look, Stark?  You have this weird thing going where you seem to think that you're the only one who's trying to figure out the whole relationship thing.”
“No one believes that, Tone,” Rhodey said.  He hooked a thumb in Steve’s direction.  “Maybe Rogers does, he’s still new.”
“Right,” Clint said.  “So.  You, Harris, the kid, and Lewis, in Vegas?”  Tony glared at him.  Clint looked around.  “Anyone in this room who spent six months keeping Lewis from getting shot, getting kidnapped, inciting an international incident, or blowing up a chunk of the sovereign state of New Mexico, raise your hand.”
With his toolbox in one hand and the bread Mrs. Arbogast had given him in the other, he considered the long trek back to the manor house.  It wasn’t particularly appealing, and it’d be safer to eat before he set foot back onto the main grounds.
Steve hung up on him, which was rude, but Sam would count it as a win.  He glanced over towards the passenger seat, where Tony had gone still and quiet, his head tucked down into the bulk of his coat.  Steve could hear him breathing, the sound slow and raspy.  He reached over, his fingers ghosting over Tony's hair.  “Hey, we're going to go back to my place.  Okay?”
"Ah."  Rhodey came up behind her, peering over her shoulder.  Down on the sidewalk below them, Officer Rogers was fending off a half dozen boys with a faint smile, ignoring as they circled him, stealing pieces of penny candy from his pockets.  He shook his trunchon at them, making them scatter, but they were all laughing, skittering just out of reach before darting back under his guard.  Rhodey braced a hand on the windowframe, his eyes narrowing.  "Not what I expected."
On the bedside table, Furbro looked up from the nest of tissues DJ had made for him.  “Walk?” DJ asked.  Furbro considered him, head tipped to the side, then yawned and snuggled back down, his tail flopped over his nose.  DJ smiled at him.  “Guess not.”
“New York,” Strange confirmed, nudging him towards a bench.  Steve sank down, only now becoming aware of how his legs were shaking.  “But not the New York where you belong.”  He crossed his arms over his chest, his face set in a scowl.  “Give me one good reason why I should not send you back, right this moment.”
“We shouldn't have left it so long as is.”  The door was pushed open, and a shot, thin woman in a black dress and white apron came bustling in, her arms overloaded with packages.  Without even thinking, Steve moved, crossing over to take the boxes from her.  She smiled at him, her dark eyes bright behind a tiny pair of wire rimmed glasses.  “Oh, aren't you a sweet boy?” she said, as Steve relieved her of her burden.
“Not since Tony last managed to reprogram the whole damn thing,” Rhodey said.  “And his tastes in music are both bad, and loud.”
Cynthia reached out, her hand clasping his arm just above the elbow.  “You did fine,” she said, with a smile.  “Just...  Tell them the truth and listen.  The listening is important.  Most of them, no one listens, or they-”
“And now it’s a topic of conversation again,” she said, collecting the empty cups and plates from the desk and piling them up on a tray balanced on her hip.  “And it’s your fault.”
Steve leaned in.  "You look like death, you're clearly unwell.  You should not be handling food right now.  So.” He paused, letting that sink in before he repeated, “Who's taking your station?"
"ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLWAYS," Val said, her voice rising to a painful pitch.  DJ tried not to flinch, his back teeth locking as he held himself still.  Val put a hand over her mouth.  "Sorry, Deej."
Tony grinned, his head lolling to the side.  “Morning,” he said.  “In the morning.”  He fumbled at the waistband of his pants, and before Steve could stop him, he shoved his jeans down.  As he was sitting on them, it wasn't particularly effective.
But the robot had already turned away from him, stepping around Tony's hovering form and continuing up the street.  “Don't worry, Cap.  It's not interested in me,” Tony said.  He flipped around, darting around the robot's shoulder, trying for a better lock on the power source.  “I'm having a hard time not taking that personally.”
With a melodramatic sigh, Tony opened his mouth, letting Steve tuck the thermometer under his tongue.  “Thank you.”  Steve glanced over his shoulder. “Eli, any chance you can throw the kettle onto the stove for me?  I have to keep him from...”  Steve waved a hand at the trays of cinnamon rolls.  “Gorging.”
“There's no room,” Steve said, and that was the stupidest thing he could've said, because Tony promptly twisted around, wriggling his way to the other side of the bed.  The blankets went with him, and he clung to Steve's shirt, his hand stretched out to hold tight to the hem.
Tony set his bottle of soda down on the workbench.  “Maybe I shouldn’t have thrown that,” he said, his voice thin.
“Eventually, perhaps, but not just yet,” Jarvis told him.  To DJ, he asked, “May I open that for you?”
"Feeding it and making sure that we keep things from getting destroyed, as much as I can, I mean, sometimes things get destroyed and it's my fault, and really, there's not much I can do about that, but-"
“I’m always afraid that if I push you too hard, I’ll lose you.”  Steve’s voice seemed to come from a distance.  Somewhere outside of himself.  “I don’t know where the line is.  My entire life, I’ve never been able to figure where that line is, I just want too much from people, I want too much, and I…”
Cursing, Steve shot off after the boys, and Tony wandered after them, grinning to himself.  It took him a few minutes to work his way through the lobby, nodding and smiling at people as they passed, accepting stumbling, shy thanks from children clinging to their mother’s skirts and their father’s hands.
He squeezed his eyes shut. “I can't do it again, Pepper. I can't. You get used to the weight, the pressure. Of, of life. You get used to it and then you don't even feel it anymore, because it's always been there and it has to be borne, so fuck, just handle it, just bear it, and don't think about it.
“At the end of the night, everyone is welcome to take one of these assorted dessert trays.”  She gestured at the display platter with all the grace and charm of a game show hostess.  It had been wrapped in colored cellophane and topped with a big bow. “Or, if you’d prefer, we’ve partnered with the Maria Stark foundation to distribute the extras to their network of homeless shelters, domestic violence safe houses, and children’s charities.”
"You're a very lucky little boy," Obie said, slicing into his roast beef.  He gave DJ a tight lipped smile.  "In my day, children took their meals in the nursery until they could carry on a decent conversation and had some manners."
DJ blinked at her, confused, and she gave him a slight smile.  “I don’t like the other ones,” she explained, her voice kind, and DJ nodded.
“You alienated half of the city’s culinary scene in one three minute video,” Fury said, as Thor collected Tony’s empty cup and returned to his blender.  Fury considered Tony over the rim of his cup, one eyebrow arched.  “That’s efficient.  Even for you.”
“Yeah, he's snoring,” Steve agreed, grinning at him.  “Lots of snores.”  He reached for the light.  “Do you feel better?  Is it okay if I turn off the light again?”  DJ nodded, and Steve turned it off.  “Okay, let's go back downstairs.”
“Yeah, money's horrible, just...” Sam made a scoffing sound.  “It's lucky for you that I don't hold a grudge..”
Reality came crashing down on Steve like an ocean wave.  This wasn't real.  This wasn't ever going to be real.
He leaned over, collecting a rook from the base of the chair, where it had ended up.  “But if you want to talk about hired help getting ideas above their station-” He set it down, gently, so, so gently, into its spot.  “The same would apply to you.”
“I will break fingers, I don't want to, but I will,” Jessica said, skittering sideways to keep the punching bag between her and the designers.  They were whispering among themselves, doing quick calculations and sizing her up from a safe distance.  Jessica gave them a suspicious look.  “You need your fingers, right?”
“'Wait Til Next Year' was really good,” Steve said, dishing the pasta sauce into a deep bowl.  “So I figured I'd read some of her other stuff.”  He set the bowl aside.  “I liked the one she did on the Kennedys better, I think.”
Frustration overwhelmed him.  “Because I said so,” he finished, and it was stupid and childish and he didn’t care.  If there was one thing his father had taught him, it was that Starks made their own reality.  The rest of the world be damned.  If he wanted to do it, he did it, and to hell with anyone who said differently.
“Wait, what-” Steve, caught in the act of drying his hands on a kitchen towel, stared at him.  “What porn?”  Tony held up the slim volume, and Steve grinned at him.  “Okay, 'Leaves of Grass' has some erotic leanings, but-”
Bobbi picked it up, tucking it back into the folder and closing it, her hand resting on top of it.  “It was odd,” she said.  “In the past, he’d broken up a few anarchist groups.  Which, since that’s to the benefit of the rich and powerful of this city, that’s not so surprising.  What is surprising is that the only ones he seemed to bother were the ones who were actually a threat.  Men with bombs.  Men who planned on killing people.”  She met Steve’s eyes.  “As many people as possible.
“I can’t speak for you, but I’m okay with it.”  Steve added a few numbers to the webform, then deleted them again.  “Really?  We need cheesecake?”
Tony gave him a look.  “I can’t keep a child,” he pointed out.  “It’s insane.  The entire idea is insane.  I don’t even know why we’re having this discussion.”
“Hi,” Clint said, focusing on the girl in his arms and not the voices yelling in his ear.  He had a lot of experience in ignoring that.  “I'm Clint.  How're you doing?”
“Oh, we're going to need one of those, too,” Tony said, toasting Luke with his coffee cup.  “Do you have a lawyer lined up?”
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm.  “Faster for us to get out if she drives,” he said.  To Billy, he said, “Run.”  Billy took off, and Steve got the back door of the car open.  “Nat?”
Steve glanced back at him, and Tony was staring at him, his face set.  “Come home with us,” he said.  And then, in the silence that followed, he took a deep breath, and another.  “Steve.  Come home.”
“Don’t get me wrong, he’s not really my type, but I can see the appeal,” Jan said.  She leaned back, bracing her hands on the bench.  “And more than just sleeping with him, you…” Her head tipped to the side, her eyes considering.  “You like him.”
“Yes, but it's good for us, and that's all that matters,” Jan said, crossing her arms over her chest. “You need to tell him, Steve.”
He probably would.  Steve had seen Greer down in the workshop a few times, perched on the edge of the workbench, idly playing with a holographic design or just dancing to the music Tony blasted every time he was working on something serious.  Steve wondered if Tony danced with her sometimes.
It was the quickest car ride Steve had ever had, one hand braced on the roof of the car, the other locked in Tony’s death grip.  It would’ve hurt, hell, it might’ve hurt, but he didn’t care.  All he cared about was the small, fragile possibility that Tony needed him as much as he needed Tony.
“Did you want to see a movie today?  Tonight?” Tony said.  Broad, to specific.  Narrow the scope.  Pull it in, degree by degree.  DJ nodded again.  “Did you like seeing everyone?  Did you like seeing the theater”
“Only the dress uniform,” Steve said, trying again. He was going to end up tying his hand to his neck. “I didn't like the dress uniform, and the dress uniform didn't like me, and there were a lot of people who could just tie my dang tie if it came down to it, so...” He looked at Jesse. “Can you tie this?”
"I-"  He stopped, his mouth open, then subsided back into the chair.  “Okay, that's fair.”  He sipped his coffee.  He paused.  “Before or after Pepper?”
“Someone’s been listening to podcasts again,” Tony said,  he waved at DJ and waited for him to cut the connection before he turned to face Steve.  “Haven’t you?”
“What's the fun in that, ma'am?” Peter asked, straightening up.  “And it's not that we mean to get into trouble, sometimes, it just...”  He shrugged.  “It happens.”
“Acceptable,” she said.  She looked at Steve, tucking a whirl of dark hair behind her ear.  “Steve?   Do you want to look at the menus?”
Steve perched uneasily on the edge of a wicker chair, not quite sure how he’d ended up here. Like with everything else that had happened to him this week, he'd had a clear plan and a strong sense of determination.  And just like with everything else, it had meant absolutely nothing.  He'd been swept out by a rip tide before, the sand beneath his feet dissolving as he found himself pulled out to see, far over his head.  Struggling was useless, against the might of the ocean, and the tide didn't care if you lived or died.
Stark took a deep breath.  “And I did it first,” he said.  He met Rogers’ eyes, his gaze steady.  “I did it first, with less of a chance of success, with more at stake, and while I’d like to argue that depending on Richards is a small step up from Strange-”
His head tipped forward and he considered her from under the hard line of his eyebrows.  “Right.  I'll get right on that, Sue, that's a great idea, I'll, I don't know, I'll hire some children, where do you rent those, Jarvis, can you-”
“Well, it's packed with food truck chefs, so...” Steve rolled his head on his neck.  “I've slept in quieter places.”
“We’re in Vegas, buddy, guys my size are probably their prime clientele for the sexy varient,” Clint said.  He held up the Iron Hero bag, giving it a little shake.  “Your choice.  I”m pretty sure they’ve got five of these.  Or I can just load up on Sexy Iron Scouts.”
The studio was small and comfortable, with a wall of mirrors along one wall and floor to ceiling windows overlooking the New York skyline across from it.  Music swirled through the space, the precise, measured march of notes.  Natasha was at the barre, one long leg balanced delicately along the polished wood, her body swept forward over it.  She didn't even look towards the door, she just continued with her stretching, her left arm sweeping through the air in a perfect arc.
"We will be replacing this trash-" Stark swept the kite off of DJ's head.  "With something structurally sound."
“I cannot feel anything below my hips and that’s a good thing, because when I can feel my legs again, I will want to die,” Pepper said.  She rolled her head in his direction.  “Happy Valentine’s Day, boss.”
“Right, I do that, I probably shouldn’t, but I’m sure I didn’t mean for you to use it.”  Tony wondered if he’d survive a trip to the kitchen.  Coffee might be worth dying for.
“The child knows what he wants,” Agatha said from the other side of the table.  In front of her, a crock of French onion soup steamed away under a thick blanket of cheese.  “It is something to be admired.” She picked a piece of crusty bread from the platter in the middle of the table.  She considered DJ’s bowl.  “What sort?”
“I’ll put it away later,” Bruce said, which was so patently a lie that Tony didn’t even bother pointing it out.
The words died in his throat.  Home.  Come home.  What right did he have to say that to a child, to this child?
“Now I feel like they're booby trapped, or maybe poisoned,” Bucky said.  He picked up the biggest one on the plate and took a huge bite.
Nomad tossed his head, and Shuri’s mare did a dancing side-step, pulling away from him.  “He can walk,” Steve said, patting Nomad’s neck.  The horse’s ears flicked back towards him, and Steve smiled.  “Yes, I’m talking about you, you foul tempered nag.”
“We'll...  We'll handle the sketchbooks,” he said.  He gave her a bright smile.  “Grab the box of paint?”
The thug swung the cudgel against his palm, the wood hitting flesh with a crack.  “Guess so,” he said, taking a darting step forward.  Steve shifted his weight, centering the shield in front of him, bracing himself for the coming rush.
Tony took a breath.  “I promise,” he said, because he was adept at two things: lying to himself, and forcing reality into whatever form he wanted it to take.  His hand smoothed over Steve's hair, and even that casual contact hurt.  “Go to sleep.”  He made himself smile.
“I forget,” he said.  He frowned.  “Or.  Maybe, I think too much.”  That wasn't right.  Frustrated, he scrubbed his hands over his face.  “Too long?”
“Hi, Shirley!” Clint said, and the other shoe dropped so hard that Phil could swear he felt the earth move. His head snapped up, and he found Clint staring at him, a pleasant smile on his face.  “It’s-  Yeah.”  He grinned.  “Yes, I know I’m in your phone, I just-”
There was an unexpected tartness to the words that Tony didn’t know how to handle.  He looked down, at where his fingers pressed against his skin. “I think I had another..”  His fingers flexed, and he let his hands fall into his lap.  “Another attack.”
“You're the worst,” he said, but she'd already hung up on him, which was fine, it was easier to get the last word if no one was listening any more.
It was a smaller bedroom, but more then the physical size, it was less imposing.  It was tucked in a corner of the floor, with large windows on two walls flooding the space with light.  Someone, Jarvis probably, had opened them, and now the breeze stirred the lacy, cream colored curtains.  Instead of the heavy, dark wallpaper he'd seen elsewhere, the walls here were painted a pale green, with delicate, twining vines running around the top near the ceiling.
DJ took a breath, and when he exhaled, something went with it.  Something he couldn't define.  “I'm...  Gonna bot now,” he said, the words so hard that he could barely manage them.
“Gluten free frozen waffles,” Rhodey said.  “Which, you know, it’s a good thing they’re available, for the people who need them, but-”
“I could not have timed that better if I had tried,” the Tony Stark who was not Steve’s Tony Stark said, a split second before Clint yanked his phone out of his hand.  “Hey!  I-”
“How she puts up with you, I have no idea,” Pepper said, shifting through the paperwork.  “Is it dinnertime, Jarvis?”
“I think you should hit up some sympathetic voices for an interview or two where you ask for privacy in this time of transition, do a few social events together,” Marcy said, brisk and efficient.  “You'll have a nice photo op or two where you act the way you always do, but now it all seems very romantic.  You keep running the Avengers, you keep things together, and then in six months, after you're yesterday's news and everyone's moved on to the next hot Hollywood scandal, get a quiet, no-contest divorce.”
“Right,” Tony grumbled.  He hovered by the couch, knowing he should leave before he got himself in trouble, but fuck it.  He made bad choices.  “You have dinner yet?”
"And this is how our friendship ends," Tony said, leaning an elbow on the counter.  "With baseless accusations and a complete lack of understanding of how I function-"
“You got it, Mr. Stark.” He tucked the money into an interior pocket, straightening his jacket as he did.
“That's how it's going to be spun by the media,” she said, her voice calm and firm.  “That's the message that's going to go out.”  She leaned back, cradling her pen between her fingers.  She rotated it, slow and controlled.  “That's what you're going to face.   Which isn't a problem.” Her eyes slid from Tony to Steve and back.  “You both have the political currency to weather this storm.  It'll end up on a few highlight reels a few years from now, it'll be the go-to joke of a lot of bad stand up comedians.”  She arched an eyebrow, her voice sardonic. “Remember that time that Iron Man and Captain America got hitched?”
She looked up.  “My preference, of course, would be to rent the function space here in the building,” she said.  “It's big enough, there's an excellent catering company on call, the security is already in place, and I'm familiar with the layout and the staff.”  She huffed out a breath.  “But when I contacted the building management, I was informed that it was already under contract.”
“Why is he-” Steve started forward in a quick-paced jog, needing to do SOMETHING.  “I told him that I wasn’t interested in you.”  He stopped, his mouth going tight.  “Sorry, that’s-  That’s rude.”
DJ’s fingers picked at a loose thread of the blanket.  His head was down, his eyes focused on his fingers.  “All right?” he asked, his voice small.
Pepper was staring at him, silent tears rolling down her pale cheeks, and that was a body blow he wasn't expecting. His shoulders slumped. “Oh, God, Pep, don't-”
“I’m thinking about if he’s still pissed about that article in the Financial Times.  Wondering if he’s fixed that bug in the knee joint of the newest armor.”  Steve stared at the horizon, the morning air cold on his throat, on his lips.  “I want to text him and tell him I hate this meeting, because he’ll have a response that’ll make me laugh.  I want to check the team calendar, to see if Jarvis has added anything for him that we know about, and I also find myself resenting that I have to learn about his trips and his absences from the team calendar and Jarvis, anyway.
Steve realized he was gripping the doorknob hard enough to bend it.  He forced his fingers free.  “I’ll pay for-”
“No.”  He stopped, a suit jacket hanging forgotten from his hand.  “Do you want a corsage?” he asked, because that sounded like information that Greer might want.
“Why do you hate me so much much?” Jan said, her voice rising to a dramatic pitch.  She slumped forward, resting her forehead on Steve's breastbone, half of his wardrobe pinned between them.  “Why?”
There was a slight tap on the door, and then Mrs. Parker bustled in, a covered plate in one hand.  “I’m here,” she said. “DJ, go wash your face and put on your pajamas.  Peter can’t go to bed until you’re tucked in as well.  Mr. Stark, you can help him.”  She pushed Tony’s paperwork to the side and set the plate down. “Officer Rogers, sit and eat.”
He looked up, something like benign confusion floating over his pasty, bruised face.  “He’s just a little boy,” he said, his voice breaking.  “He’s just a kid.  I wasn’t going to-”  He stopped.  Took a drink.  “I couldn’t KILL him.  But Stane was screaming, louder and louder, and I just…”
“That word has lost all meaning,” Tony said, skipping sideways as Steve gave him a gentle kick in the shin.  “Yes.  We’re ready, why do you-”
Tony paused, peeking over the back of the couch.  Rhodey was lying face down on the cushions, buried under half a dozen blankets and clutching a throw pillow to his face.  “What?” Tony asked, bracing a hand on the back of the couch.
“You hit a very, very powerful witch who may or may not be a descendent of the fae with a broom,” one of the Stephen Stranges said.  “If I were you, I would guard my name very carefully at this point.”
And he wasn’t asking about the bus, but Harris pretended to think about it.  “I’d say the driver, but honestly, with traffic being what it is, that’s not really true, either.”  That won him a small smile, and Harris leaned forward.  “C’mon.  What do you want to do?”
She smiled.  “This isn’t for him,” she said.  “It’s for Mr. Stark.  If DJ is going to stay, then it will be his responsibility to make sure that DJ is taken care of.  He needs to get used to that sooner, rather than later.”  She tipped her head forward, peering at Steve over the rims of her glasses.  “And you need to learn that if you’re not going to be here for dinner, you need to tell us.”
DJ focused on the cat.  “Couldn’t sleep,” he admitted.  The words were thick in his mouth, losing meaning somewhere between his head and his tongue.  The cat’s tail paused, a shiver running down its length.
“Because just a few days ago,” Jan said, pulling him back towards her.  “You would’ve gone along with my joke.  You would’ve made it bigger.  Worse.” She leaned her chin on Tony’s shoulder.   “Less than a week ago, Mr. Stark, you would’ve done everything possible to make that cop believe we were seconds from tearing each other’s clothes off down here.”
She glanced at Steve.  “I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm a lousy human being, Steve, and that's hard.  That's, that's a hard thing to understand.”
“Then can we narrow it down a bit?” Tony asked.  “I’ve got a very full day planned, I don’t really have time for a rousing round of 20 questions.”
Ellen held up her hands.  “'Statutory Surprise in Symkaria: Same Sex Marriage Made Legal Overnight,'” she said, still pleased with that.
DJ’s hands were locked on the straps of his backpack, his knuckles white with the force of his grip.  “I can…  I can just come back tomorrow,” he managed.
Jarvis nodded.  “This is true.  Perhaps I should say, he hit Anthony in front of me once.”  He took a deep breath, his eyes hooded.  “I picked him up, and I carried him back to his room.  I washed his face, helped him into his pajamas, and put him to bed with a cup of cocoa.
“What?” Steve’s head snapped down towards the board.  “Son of a-”  His breath came out in a burst of laughter.  “You did that on purpose.  To distract me.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “You're an exhausting human being, you do know that, don't you?” he asked. But Steve was pretty sure he was hiding a smile.
He stopped again, and Rhodey said there, waiting patiently.  “It’s his body,” Steve said at last.  “And I don’t want to pressure him.  Either way.”
“I’m not expecting much, to be honest.”  Clint paused in front of an oversized booth packed from floor halfway to the ceiling with t-shirts.  “Where’s Darcy?”
Behind them, Rhodey had DJ on his shoulders, his big hands locked on DJ's small ones.  DJ was howling with laughter, his heels digging into Rhodey's chest, his body canted forward to lean against the back of Rhodey's head.  Despite that, Rhodey was laughing, too, spinning in circles until DJ was tipped to the side like a drunk who couldn't find his balance.
Steve gave a slight shrug.  "He's violating the law, and everyone knows it," he said.  He could hear the tension in his own voice, and he made a deliberate attempt to relax.  He'd wasted too much time looking for DJ, who'd disappeared before he'd woken up.  He was tired, frustrated and hungry, and that wasn't a good combination.  "I've got a duty-"
“And sadly, I know that’s the best I’ll get, when it comes to you,” Strange said.  He pointed at the bench, his other hand tracing an arcane set of symbols through the air.  “Sit.”
Tony straightened up.  “Did we-”  His head snapped around towards Rhodey, who was cradling his head in his hands.  “Tell me we didn’t give him alcohol.”
Tony let his eyes roll up towards the ceiling.  "Fine.  Thank you."  Rogers' eyebrows arched, and Tony hid a smile behind his coffee cup.  "You proved an adequate replacement for an eight year old street urchin.  Your ancestors should be very proud.” He pointed the cup at Rogers.  “You should be proud."
Dummy settled down next to him, and Franklin reached up, his fingers gentle against his main support strut.  “You're safe here, too,” he said, his voice quiet, and Dummy's head dipped in a nod.
“So you should be used to my outsized style by now.  Well?" he asked, when she stepped back.  "Do I pass muster?"
The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,
Steve's lips twitched.  “I think that's a conversation I need to have with him, and not you.  Don't you?”
"Yes, as rational as, you know, bigots can be," Sue agreed.  "But even so.  If they come for her brother, she's going to be involved.  On the off chance that the government doesn't make a target of her, she'll make a target of herself."  This time, her smile was a little deeper, a little more real.  "They're a matched set, those two.  Reed keeps hinting he wants another child, and I've told him, if they outnumber us, we're doomed."
"I'm not going far," Tony said, but he wove his fingers through Steve's, his grip firm and strong.  "Try to keep up, old man."
“If you bring Washington down on us right now, I will show you the true meaning of terror,” Pepper said, her voice dire.
“Only now?  I must be doing something right.”  He tapped Tony on the nose with the thermometer.  “Open.  Up.”
Sue was already shaking her head.  “It’s one per family for us,” she said, ignoring the way both Franklin and Johnny groaned at that.  “We will take one.”
“She's a runaway.  Her parents are the ones who involved us,” Gyrich said.  He gave Steve a pleasant smile.  “They called and reported her missing, and the local authorities referred the case to us.  We assured them that we had the tools and the resources to find her, and they agreed.”
Fingers, warm and firm, slipped under his chin, holding him still, and then Steve's lips brushed across his cheek.  Startled, he turned, and Steve was right there, eyes bright and gleaming in the shadows of his mask.  Tony felt his face heat, an embarrassing response for a man of his age, but Steve's fingers were still cradling his jaw, and his lips, lips that Tony had absolutely not had filthy, filthy thoughts about during more than one Avengers team meeting, were right there, right-
Happy stepped out of his reach, the movement so smooth and easy that Steve was left clawing helplessly at the air.  One of Happy’s hands shot up in the air.  “Wait.  Gotta…”  He looked at Steve, his eyes wide.  “My cigar.  Don’t wanna drop, it, gotta find someplace to-”
“I'd worry about her stealing your truck, but she doesn't have a driver's license yet,” Tony said.  He patted the bed next to him.  “Get your fine ass up here and we can watch something on your laptop.”
He could hear a rhythmic tapping, what he suspected was a pen against the top of a desk or maybe a fingernail against a coffee cup.  “So…”
She took a large bite, and chewed with vicious intent.  “This.” She bounced the spoon on the edge of the bowl.  “Do you even know what you’re doing?” she asked Bucky.
Just a minor warning for a tough conversation about parenting, and some mind control in a non-harmful situation.
He smiled back.  “I hear good things about your pies.  And your pancakes,” he said, and to his surprise, she reached up, smoothing his hair down.
“It’ll be-” The crowd parted, and at the far end of the aisle,  Harris caught a glimpse of Darcy, waving a hand in their direction.  There was a bag slung over her shoulder and a wand in her hand, and he caught himself grinning at her.  She grinned back, and made a ‘come on,’ gesture before she disappeared around the corner.  Harris wiggled between Tony and Clint.  “Over there.”
“As I was hoping to get through this without a kidnapping or Sue being forced to shank a head of state with a butter knife, I have made note of that,” Jan said.  She stopped him before he could pick up a water glass.  “Stop touching everything.”
“I played baseball down in the Parade Grounds, in Brooklyn,” Steve said, as DJ rolled the ball between his palms, flicking it up into the air and catching it.  “Thank you, my lord.  That was kind of you.”
"That's it?" Victor asked. "That's your only regret?” He was trying to hold back a smile, his lips twitching. “Chafing dishes?"
“And you did it as a joke.” Marcy tapped the end of her pen against the table.  It hit once, twice, three times, the click seeming to echo in the silent room.  Her head tipped to the side, her eyes wide.  “Is that it?  Let's get married, bro, but hey, no homo?”
"I'm docking your pay," he said to DJ, who twisted around in Rogers' arms, burying his face in Rogers' shoulder.  "No use crying on the help, my mind is made up.  You've failed me, there will be nothing but bread and water for the foreseeable future, unless it's the good kind of bread, and then it's-" He didn't know where he was going with this.  Judging by the look on Rogers' face, neither did he.
Tony grinned as he reached for his napkin. "And he's still after my pastry, so..."  He patted the bed next to him.  "Guess it wasn't enough.  Come on, hop up here, kid.  I'll distract Jarvis and you can finish off my eggs benedict."
“If that drier eats one more of my shirts, I'm going to shove it off the loading dock myself,” Steve said, shoving the apartment door open with his hip, a laundry basket balanced on his other side.  “This is the sixth time that I've-”
Steve laughed.  “Isaiah ran the best kitchen in the city, and then he ran the best food truck in the city.”  He headed for the bathroom.  “The original War on Hunger.  He and Eli are going to take the truck out for the next few days, so I can take a break and watch you.”
He’d made a lot of bad decisions, based on gut reactions, poor judgement, and a keen sense of justice.  Bucky always said, he never remembered to look before he lept, and sometimes forgot to correct that error even long after his feet had hit the ground.
“The history books will record this act of monumental cowardice,” Tony said, reaching for a pawn.    He moved it.  “Luckily for you, you have an able lieutenant, and I’m here to save this army from ruin.”
He paused.  “Who does that, ya know?  Who pays that much money to get a dusty, ugly vase from a top shelf in a room no one seemed to go into?  I figured it was perfect.  Might be days, or even weeks, before anyone even noticed it was gone.  If we were careful, if no one saw us?”  He tossed the pepper mill in a high, controlled arc, sending it flipping end over end through the air before he snagged it with one hand.  “Easy money.”
In a rush, it expanded, folding out into a swirling portal, and Clea stepped through, her head bent over a scroll of paper.  “Is this important, darling?” she asked, walking the paper upwards with careful fingers.  She frowned down at something on the page, her mouth pursing up tight.  “I think I may have found something of use, it’s just-”
“Better than anyone else,” she said.  She tipped her face up, her eyes fluttering shut as she savored the sunlight through the leaves.  “And if my mother could not control me, he would not expect you to.”
“I doubt it,” Morse said, her ponytail swinging behind her as she moved.  “After all, I’m pretty sure Tony just unlocked it to throw you off of his trail.”  She grabbed a heavy jug, swinging it up onto the workbench. Steve wasn’t sure if it held whiskey or something a great deal more caustic.  “Didn’t he?”
Steve’s fingers beat against the polished marble top of the counter.  “With homemade apricot jam inside,” he said, as Rhodey pulled one apart.  It ripped in half, layers of whisper thin, flakey pastry giving way to the golden yellow jam at its center.  “They should still be warm.”
Steve sighed, but he was smiling. “Let me guess.  He’s trying to charge people for pictures without Tony knowing about it?” he asked, setting his cup down.
DJ gave her a suspicious look, and Wanda drew her legs up, bracing her heels on the edge of her seat.  “So.  What do you want to do?”
"It does not matter," Jarvis said, and the elevator started up again with a faint, almost imperceptible jolt.  "He wants to be.  And he cannot.  And when he cannot, when he is aware of his own, what he would consider his failings, the presence of his parents adds to his stress.  They serve as a reminder that he cannot be what he wants to be.”
Natasha smiled.  It was not a nice smile.  “No.  You haven't.”  She clapped her hands.  “Let's start.”
“I noticed that, yes,” Jarvis said, his lips twitching.  He reached the door and pulled it open. “I’ll keep your account open in my ledgers until they are returned.  I expect you will be prompt about it.”
"Please tell me that you didn't let her into the inner circle," Tony said to Pepper, who just smiled.  Her dress was a swirl of green fabric, cut close around torso and hips and falling in waves around her feet.
Tony paused, the slice of pizza halfway to his lips.  On the other end of the couch, Steve was grinning at him, his eyes bright behind the lenses of those damn glasses.  "We're doing what now?" Tony asked.
“But it would be such a marvelous joke,” Jan pointed out.  She rolled over, folding her arms on the arm of the couch and leaning her chin on them.  She fluttered her eyelashes at him.  “Can you just imagine his face?”
Steve stopped, his mouth working.  After a moment, he took a deep breath, and continued, his voice shaking.  “The Brooklyn Children’s Museum was chartered in 1899, and for more than a hundred years has served to educate, entertain and enlighten the children of the borough of Brooklyn.  Now, more than ever, the museum remains dedicated to offering a safe and welcoming space for all children who find their way to its doors.”
“To open presents, and per your agreement, he has not touched a single one,” Jarvis said.  “You neglected to instruct him to remain in his bed until such time.”
“Ten bucks and a box of crab rangoon says I absolutely can,” Tony said, tossing a chopstick up and catching it in his fist, his thumb braced on the end.
“Damn right,” Sam said.  He wrapped an arm around Steve's shoulders.  “C'mon.  Let's go and do this thing.  I want to impress Abby with my new moves.”
“Excuse me, give me a minute.”  Harris stepped between Tony and the registration table.  “Can you not?” Harris stared at him, his eyebrows drawn up in a sharp line.  “Can you-” He waved a hand behind him.  “She’s saying it like that because there’s a guy over there in a bow tie and holding a clipboard, and I know you’ve never had to deal with a supervisor in your entire life, but for everyone else on Earth, we know what that means.  She’s saying it like that because she has to, because that guy-” He stabbed a finger in the man’s direction.   “Is watching her to make sure that she DOES say it like that, so can you be less of an ass about it?”
"Peggy loved me, and I loved her,” Steve said.  “And Bucky could do better than me, anyway.”  He shifted in his chair.  “I can't hurt the dead, Tony.  And Marcy was right about something else.  The damage is done.  Even if I wanted to deny it, that's-”  He shrugged.  “That's out there.  There's no getting it back, no changing people's minds.  The ones who want to believe it are going to, the ones that don't, well, they'll have to deal with it.”
“Worth a try, I suppose,” Tony said with a wry smile.  “Fine.  I’ll have Jarvis bring me a sandwich up to my office later.”
“Nothing.”  Tony's fingers traced intricate patterns on Steve's skin, his breathing smoothing out.  “Sorry.”
"Less rabid," Tony said, and that won him another burst of laughter.  He grinned.  It felt like a win, in a way that he wasn't quite comfortable with.  But he'd take the wins he could get.  "Ready?"
Jarvis paused at a door, shifting Steve's hat and bag into one hand.  “Here we are, Officer.”  He pushed it open, waving Steve into the room.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist.  This, he understood.  “We’ve got a few hours til breakfast,” he whispered against Tony’s shoulder.  “And I haven’t got a wife.”  He resisted the urge to ask if he had a boyfriend, because that way lay madness.  Instead, he slipped his hands under Tony’s shirt.
She glanced at the coffee shop by the front door.  "I don't..."  Her voice trailed away, and she looked up at Steve, her eyes steady.  "I don't want to be that far away from them."
“Yes, it is, and yet, you’ve done it again.”  Pepper slapped the letter down on the workbench.  “Which has resulted in her renting out Radio City Music Hall.”
Hank shrugged, but there was a softness to his face now, a slight smile tugging at the corners of is mouth.  “There is.  Beat it out of him.”
Tony reached up, batting his hand away with a mumbled sound of frustration. “Mmm. Yes,” he said, dragging the blanket over his shoulder.
“I’m sensing some resistance to the idea of there being two Tony Starks being in this universe,” Darcy mused.
“Oh, I am committed,” Okoye said.  To T’Challa, she said, “Will you please make her eat something, your Majesty?” She waved a hand at Shuri, who gave her brother a cheeky smile and a wave.  Okoye looked at her, disapproval on her face.  “Everything we give her, goes straight into her horse’s mouth.”
“I pay more attention than you,” Val said, and it wasn't mean, the way she said it.  She didn't look at Franklin, and she didn't look at DJ, either.  She just stared at the tv, her eyes hidden behind the sweep of her lashes.  “And people don't pay attention to me the way they do you.”  She shifted her weight, leaning forward to rest her chin on her knees.  “Do you, DJ?  Have bad dreams, I mean?”
“I got arrested, caught up in a raid,” Bobbi said.  She smiled, her lips kicking up on one side in a wry twist, and spread her hands out.  “Wearing clothes like this.  The arresting officers didn’t do a lot of investigation, they had much bigger fish to fry, but sooner or later, someone would’ve figured out that I wasn’t the sort of man that they thought I was.”
“Fine,” he said, rolling to his feet.  “Coffee it is.” He headed for the door, doing his best to ignore the wolf whistle from the bed behind him.  “Behave yourself!”
“Can you not?” Clint said, but the sentence was lost beneath the roar of the repulsors.  And whatever was above them was vaporized, releasing a rain of stone fragments and grit.  Pebble sized chunks of concrete clattered across the floor, dust swirling in the sunlight that came flooding in.
“I don’t know anything more about his love life than you do,” Steve said.  “But I’m-”  He smiled, and it felt like his face would crack.  “I’m sure he’d-  Love to have dinner.  Or something.”  The words stumbled, every attempting ending sounding worse to his ears.  “With you.”
Steve folded his arms on the edge of the counter, leaning into them.  “Spicy waffle fries, tossed with taco seasoning, then broiled under a blanket of cheese before being topped with jalapenos, sour cream and pork carnitas.”
DJ stared up at him, his eyes and nose red.  His grip wasn’t steady, so Tony held onto the cup for him, guiding it to his lips.  DJ drank, a few quick, greedy gulps, before pushing it away, his head falling back on Tony’s shoulder.  But he was calming down now, and Tony let him, waiting until the sobs tapered away to rough gasps.
“Yes, his manners are quite good, for one of his background,” Obie said.  He looked up, giving Rogers a smile.  “As are yours, officer.”
“So you said.” Clint twisted his arm around, trying to get a good angle.  “I can’t believe you went to buy a churro.”  Darcy stared at him, her face incredulous, and he shook his head.  “Okay, I can believe it, because you’re, you know, you, but we’re kind of in the middle of something here.”
“Good night, Mr. Stark,” Peter said, and his eyes were red, and so was the tip of his nose, and Tony hated everything about that.
Steve picked up the glass from the floor and dropped it into the sink. “I swear to god if your ass moves one inch off of that couch, Stark, we are going to be having a discussion that you will not enjoy.  Stay.  Still.  I will bring you some water, okay?”
“The instructor was a man,” Sam said, and Steve cursed under his breath.  Sam gave him a distinctly amused look.  “Look.  You’re my friend.  You know that, right?  That I’m you’re friend, and I’m going to support whatever decision you make here.”
There was a faint tug on the hem of her shirt, and she looked down.  DJ offered her a tall silver cup of greenish sludge.  "Dummy," he said.
“Always.”  Tony turned his over in his hands, a faint smile curling the edges of his lips.  He glanced up.  "Why?"
“The hot tub,” Carol said, and Steve gave a full body wince.  “Yeah.  Anyway, they found a place that usually does restaurant wholesale for like, cruise ships, a place that sold Jell-O powder in fifty pound boxes, and-”
She tossed it back on the pile.  “I have so many problems,” she said, waving a hand through the air.  “I have two weeks to pull this together, and Tony's going to fight me the entire way, which was to be expected, but still I could do without his fussing so-”
He took a slow, deep breath.  “Parker, I will have you thrown into the Hudson, just tell me what the fuck happened.”
Steve swallowed.  “Isn't this-”  He stopped.  “It's not fair, it's not right.  Just because I feel this way, isn't this-” He shook his head.  “It's not right.  To use this to my advantage like this, it's not right.  We have to do this in public, Sam, I can't pressure him into something he might not...”  His throat hurt.  “Into something he doesn't want.”
“No, inappropriate would be teaching him extra swears in extra languages,” Bobbi told him.  “It’s an important life lesson in New York, Jarvis, people take you seriously if you can curse ‘em out in their mother tongue.”
DJ took a breath, and another, trying to slow his heart rate.  The room was featureless.  If there were walls, he couldn’t seem to focus on them.  Just the heavy wooden chairs, the cushions a dark wine redc, and the wooden table, and the carpet beneath their feet.  He wanted to look up, to see if there was a ceiling, but for some reason, he couldn’t manage it.  “I…  I don’t know you,” he said, forcing each word out.  “I don’t-”
“I’m lucky for a lot of things,” Bucky said.  “And you’re lucky I’m willing to wake up in the middle of the night to watch the videos that Tony chooses to upload when you’re out of town for more than twenty-four hours.”
“Lies.  Lies and slander, I am the center of your world.” She stopped in front of Steve, holding up an imperious hand.  “Off with it.”
Tony caught his chin, tipping his head up.  He was smiling, and Tony loved that smile.  He leaned in, brushing his lips against Steve’s.  “We’re getting there,” he whispered back, and wasn’t at all surprised when Steve tipped backwards onto the bed, pulling Tony down with him.
The boy shifted his weight, his feet shuffling awkwardly on the polished stone floor.  “‘Bout that,” he said, his voice shaking at the edges.  “Wonderin’ if I could just take a turnover, or maybe two?  And eat ‘em later?”
There was a long, long pause, where Tony just stared at the camera as if it had talked bad about his second course, and then, the voice from off-screen said, “Are…  Are you asking me?”
Tony nodded, letting Obie’s voice wash over him as he struggled to focus on the rows of numbers on the statement in front of him.  They made less sense each second that passed, but he was nothing if not stubborn.  Obie’s voice rose and fell in the background, complaints and commands, and on some level, it was just as comforting as the whiskey.
“I don’t think it’s your fault, DJ, but even if it was, even if you deliberately and rationally made the choice to come here?  I’m glad you did.”
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Thatta boy,” he said, picking up a sandwich.  He unwrapped it.  “You got a name for this brilliant girl?”
"Three," Steve said, juggling the garlic knot between his fingers, stopping to lick the butter from his fingertips.
Steve took a deep breath, stalking through the chaos, heading straight for Tony.  Everyone gave way, getting out of his way with looks that ranged from pitying to grateful.  Steve wasn't sure which one worried him more.  "Who's taking your station?"
“Stop falling in holes,” Tony said, and Clint was going to stab him in the ass as soon as they got off this street.
Clint said something utterly nonsensical in what Steve had come to recognize as his fake French, even as he distributed deviled eggs, the golden centers dusted with a dull red spice.  Natasha gave him a look as she handed Bruce a cup of wine.  "Mr. Stark doesn't need an egg," she said.
Tony gave him a hard look.  Bucky shrugged and reached for the plate.  “Okay, I'll just balance 'em on the handlebars.”
“And how pleased I am to hear it,” T’Challa said, shaking his head.  “Then you are here to meet people, in the hopes that in five or ten years, you’ll agree to marry one of them.”
“Maybe the password’s different here,” Clint said, ambling along behind them.  He bounced the unicorn plush against his leg.  “I mean, it could be?  That wouldn’t be that weird.  It’s a different universe, right?”
Sam huffed out a breath as he came up next to Steve and kept running.  Steve fell in with him.  “I’ve seen people run from their feelings,” Sam said, his voice tinged with amusement.  “But you always did take things pretty literally, Rogers.”
“To Professor Xavier and the X-Men?”  Franklin shrugged.  He shrugged a lot now.  Like things didn't matter.  DJ was pretty sure that things still mattered, and he wasn't sure why Franklin pretended they didn't.  “Sometimes.”
He reached for a book, trying to wiggle it out of the middle of the stack.  Analytical Magic, one of his favorites.  It had a lot of numbers, and he got to use a graphing calculator.  It wasn’t much to cling to, but at this point, he’d take what he could get.
DJ scrambled to his feet, sliding in shoes that were too big for him.  Steve wasn't sure how he'd ended up with shoes that were too big and pants that were too small, but Hammer had a knack of doing everything wrong.  DJ hopped onto a chair, using the extra height to snag the tea tin from the top shelf, and the cups with his other hand.
She opened her eyes to find him considering her, his expression unreadable. She gave him a tight smile. "I think you can call me Ellen."
“I want a burger,” Tony said aloud.  “Cheeseburger.  Everyone shut up.”  He pointed at Clint.  “You.  Drive.”  He let his head fall back against the headrest, his eyes sliding shut.  “Wake me when we get there.”
“Welcome.”  DJ leaned his forehead against Rogers chest for a second, his eyes flickering closed.  Then he straightened up.  “You, too,” he said to Stark.
“I do, too,” Tony said.  His free hand came up, his fingers tapping against his breastbone.  “But I think something’s coming.  Something worse.  Something…  Unavoidable.” He took a sip of his wine.  “And we’re massing something to meet it.  Something just unstoppable.”
Jarvis drew himself up, his back going ramrod straight.  “Excuse me, sir,” he said, his British accent getting crisper with every word.  “In the last few years, I have not had much chance to look after a child.”  He paused, his mouth pursing.  “Other than yourself, of course.”
“Yeah, of course, we can do something for lunch if you-” That was as far as he got before all three of the kids took off towards the elevator.  Steve stared after them, amused despite himself.  “Aaaaaand they're gone.”
“Some days it feels like it.”  Tony braced his hands on the small of his back, trying to work the kinks out of his shoulders.  “What’s the problem?  There’s no alarms and no one’s running around grabbing weapons, so what’re we looking at here?  Past due on the grocery bill?  Thor get into a diplomatic incident over street food again?  You need me to get you reservations at Per Se because they’re not returning your phone calls?”
DJ dug into his pocket, wiggling his arm until he came up with Furbro, the little lizard darting around his fingers.  His feet spread on the back of DJ’s hand, Furbro looked around, head darting from one side to the other.  DJ stroked the back of his head with one fingertip.  “Stay with Steve?” he said, and the lizard tipped his head back, blinking up at him.
“Oh.  Right.  His driver.”  Steve took a step back, waving Hogan through the door.  “Come in.  I-”  He shook his head.  “Is there a problem?”
He caught the bannister with one hand, scanning the main hall below him for any sign of movement.  If DJ had slipped out of his room, he was probably curled up in the alcove beneath the stairs as normal; Peter had found him there in the mornings before.  Still, a strange sense of unease curled in the pit of his stomach, and he found himself picking up speed.
“Are they having a party and they decided not to invite me?” Tony asked, trying to make it sound sarcastic, but it just come out a bit hurt.  He headed for the door.  “What, do I smell bad or something?”
“Everything in here is filthy, you want to just dump a bucket over the room, or do you want to take it outside and maybe avoid breathing some of it in?” Sam asked.  He looked into one of the pots.   “It wouldn’t be my choice, but-”
"Thanks, but think I can handle opening a door on my own," Steve said.  He headed around the back of the car, his shoulders squared and his jaw tight.  He did manage to open the car door, but any sense of pride he might've gotten from that small act was immediately wiped away when he smacked his head trying to maneuver his way into the back seat.
Pepper looked down at DJ.  “I cannot imagine this sweet child being a problem.” She crouched down, her arms looped around her knees.  "Would you like to come with me?" she asked, giving the boy her most winning smile.
Fury nodded.  “You know how it comes to this,” he said, leaning back in his chair, his hands folded against his stomach.  “You, more than anyone else in this room, knows how it comes to this.”
Inside, there was a workman standing on top of the billiard table, his back to the door, his head tilted up to study the damaged light fixture above him.=.  A heavy drop cloth had been tossed over the tabletop, but Steve still flinched as the man moved, his worn boots bunching the cloth with each step.  His pants were stained with grease, a long sleeved shirt tied around his narrow waist.  His white undershirt clung to the lines of his back, the sleek muscles of his shoulders and arms on full display.  As Steve watched, caught off guard, the workman propped one gloved hand on his hip, his other pushing his dark hair back.
“So I hear.”  Tony picked up a piece of bacon from the platter, peeking over Bruce’s shoulder.  “What is he studying?”
Tony's head came up.  “This is going to be a disaster, but fuck it,” he said.  He leaned up, and his lips ghosted against Steve's cheek.  “If you had to have a disastrous, short, regrettable first marriage, I'm glad you picked me.”  He stepped back.  “So, you going to move in?”
Steve covered his mouth with a hand.  “Yes, we can make popcorn,” he said to DJ.  Tony mumbled against his fingers, and Steve gave him a look.  “And yes, we are going to eat that popcorn.”  Tony threw his hands in the air, making DJ giggle.
Tony opened his mouth to say something, and Steve's fingers tightened on his.  He was tall and broad and perfect, his pale hair ruffled by the cold wind, his cheeks pink, the red scarf around his neck a spark of color and light in a world that had long since gone dark and gray.
The lamplight caught on the words carved on the stone’s surface, but he could’ve recited them from memory now.
"Right.  So this was a waste of everyone's time.”  He flipped through the pages to the back of the file.  "But I appreciate the update."
She reached up, cupping his face in her hands.  “Yes,” she said, with a wealth of feeling in her words.  “Yes, you absolutely are.”  She went up on her toes, brushing a kiss on his cheek.  “Absolutely useless.”
The words broke in his throat, and he took a deep breath.  “We're not alone anymore, you and I.  We've got back up.”  He smiled, and it ached, it hurt, in the best way, because DJ was staring at him, unblinking, unmoving.  Tony smiled at him, because it was okay. It was going to be okay.  He had to believe that.  “Someone is always, always, always going to come for you.  And you have one job, Deej, and that is to stay safe, and stay alive, until one of us gets there.
Pepper peeked over at DJ, who was grinning at her, his face alight with the warmth of it, and she struggled against a rush of warmth.  "Am I encouraging you?" she asked.
Steve opened his mouth, and whatever he was going to say was going to be horrible; he could taste the words on his tongue, bitter and poisonous, and he had no idea what they were going to be.  He was beyond thought now, beyond even trying to think.  His fingers flexed, dragging Tony closer, and then, he stopped.
Mickey snorted.  “Ain’t that the truth.  I do my best, and my ma takes what she can find, but it ain’t much these days.”  He shoveled another heaping spoonful of rice into his mouth.  “I keep a roof over our heads, but sometimes, it don’t stretch as far as it could, you know?”
"The game does not.  It would like me to buy 'farmbucks' with my real bucks, and let me tell you, it's not happening."  He stabbed at his phone, his face intense, and Steve bit back a laugh.
Tony tucked his hands in his pocket.  “I've got a meeting, but I've got time for something.”  His head tipped towards the door.  “Can I buy you breakfast?”
“I didn’t,” Ellen said.  “I came to work.  And you were here.”  Her shoulders were tight, her back straight.  “Why are you here?”
It was a disaster, it was chaos, it was something he had no idea he'd be able to survive until he did it.
“I suspect I’m exceptionally hung over now,” Tony said.  “Exceptionally.  Painfully.  Horrifically.”
“When am I not?” he asked, catching her hand and brushing a kiss across her knuckles.  “Did you cover for-”
Okoye’s lips twitched, the ghost of a smile.  “I know you too well for that, your Highness,” she said, and Shuri burst out laughing.  Okoye glanced in her direction, her expression melting into affection in an instant.  “And value you too highly.”
Her mouth went tight, but she didn’t fight him any more.  “We’ll do the dishes,” she said, pressing a napkin into his hands.  “Be careful.”  He nodded, his hands closing around the cloth.  He felt the weight of it and knew what it was, not that either of them would ever acknowledge it.   It was too dangerous for both of them.
“The two of you look like you've been to war, and you haven't even had to deal with the press yet,” Pepper said, her voice tart.  She picked up her tablet from the side table, her fingers sliding over the shining surface.  “I'm going to need you to pull yourselves together, the press release has gone out and the internet is losing its collective mind.”
Jarvis sighed.  “Yes, sir.  I should.  I’m doing my best to accomplish that, right now, and you’re proving to be the biggest impediment to the process.”
“You seem to think you have to do this alone.”  Tony pushed himself to his feet, displacing the cat, and paused, putting his clothes to order with a few quick, efficient flicks of his hands.   Furbro paced around his feet, still purring.  “I assure you.  You don’t.”
He’d expected that, but it still hurt to hear, a twist of a knife that he’d almost forgotten about.  Still, he managed a tight smile.  “I figured,” he said, closing out his holographic programs, one after another.  She waited patiently on the other side.  Tony tossed the files aside.  “No news is good news, I suppose.”
“I am refusing to look directly at you,” Pepper called, still swimming in slow, graceful strokes.  “For fear that I'll swoon and drown.”
Tony put his cup down, and picked it back up again, his fingers twitching on the handle.  “Excuse me?”
“I’m not…  Panicky,” Steve said.  “Sure, I got up obscenely early to handmake croissants in an attempt to bribe you, but that’s something I do normally.”
Tony paused, his cup halfway to his mouth.  Slowly, he looked up, meeting Peter’s eyes over the top of his paperwork.  “We’re not keeping him.”
He looked up and found DJ staring at him, his face tense, his fingers locked on the hem of his shirt.  Tony blinked at him.  “Hey, what's-”  He stopped, figuring it out a second too late.  Which was, after all, his parenting style in a nutshell.
"If you had a severe problem with alcohol, like, maybe not alcoholic levels, but you realized your relationship with alcohol was definitely not healthy and could lead you to make very poor decisions, up to and including public humiliation, would you choose to hang out in a bar?" Steve asked.
“Harris can’t,” Harris said, talking over him.  Tony opened his mouth and Harris held up both hands.  “Nope.  I can maybe take care of myself.”  He paused.  “Maybe.  I”m good for moral support, and that’s about all, I’m-”  He looked at Tony.  “All in favor of taking Clint with us?”
Steve leaned over, brushing an upside-down kiss on his lips, the gesture both odd and familiar.  “I already sent everything over to Pepper,” he said, and Tony groaned.
Isaiah stomped across the room, his cane thumping against the floor with every step.  “I subscribe to Stark’s YouTube channel.”  He snatched the hanger out of Steve’s hand and shoved it against his chest.   “Rang the little bell for notifications and everything.”
“Lasagna sounds good, thank you,” Steve said, as he maneuvered the car to the curb in front of the Sanctum.  There was always an open spot there.  DJ wondered about that sometimes.  Steve smiled as he put the car in park.  “I’m picking you up at six, right?”
“Yes, we save the manhandling for the grounds,” Jarvis said, utterly deadpan.  He collected DJ's shoes, dusting them off with a flick of his fingers.  “Or preferably off property.”
The staffer, his face flushed and his hair disordered, glared at him.  “I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said, and made a grab for the broom.  Harris jerked it up and out of reach.  “I’m really sorry, I’ve called security, we’ll have him removed right away-”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “I,” he said, his teeth flashing in a vicious smile, “do not work for you.”  He stalked up the stairs, each step driving his frustration higher.  “Get away from the windows.”
“No,” Steve said.  “He’s not prone to violence.  He’s a fast talker and a schemer, but he’s not a fighter.” He stepped in front of Tony, and Tony let him.  “But a desperate man does desperate things.”  He opened the door, letting the shield lead the way.
“Traitor,” Tony muttered under his breath, reaching for the coffee.  It was barely lukewarm, an unspoken punishment that he took without a word.
As soon as he said it, he could breathe again.  For the first time in what felt like forever.  “It’s your choice.    We’ve been moving you around, everyone’s been…”  He nodded.  “Doing things to you and around you and no one’s given you a choice in the matter, have they?”
Fury was considering the tray of sandwiches.  “Anyone eating this?” he asked, reaching for one.  He glanced around the table, waiting for each of them to shake their heads before he picked it up.  “Nothing but radio silence,” he said.  “Not pleased, but also not surprised.”
Mrs. Parker was seated on the bottom step of the grand staircase, her back leaning against the carved newel post, a basket of apples next to her feet.  There was a bowl in her lap, cradled in a tea towel, and another by her side, full of peeled fruit.  She was watching the boys, a faint smile on her face, while she ran a knife under the delicate skin of the fruit
Jarvis smiled at him.  “If that child is going to go back to the orphanage,” he said, his voice quiet, almost gentle.  “You will be the one doing it.  It will not be Miss Potts.  Or Officer Rogers.  Or me.”  He straightened his jacket.  “If you make the choice that he is better off there, than he would be here, then you will be the one to carry that out.”
And the thing popped into existence.  Right in front of him, so close that he could touch it, so close that he could see his reflection in the smooth, dark surface of the metal.  Harris bit back something like a scream, his heart in his throat, one hand flailing out.
“I’m sorry, do what?” Tony asked.  He reached up, and for the first time, Steve realized he was still holding onto Tony’s shirt in a death grip.
“How many couches are in this place?” Jan asked, rubbing her forehead.  “How many couches, and he looks at a pool table and goes, ‘yeah, that’s the ticket.’”
And every other inch of space was kitchen.  It was sunny and bright and he'd lay good money that everything was just a little bit untidy, except the kitchen.  The kitchen would be pristine.  Tony caught himself grinning, despite the way his head ached.  Definitely Steve's place.
He remembered the city.  He remembered the looming buildings that hung out over the narrow streets, and the small stretches of common ground and the old wells.  He remembered the way the wind swept down the central streets, sending leaves skittering against the cobblestones.  He remembered the way that the sun caught the windows of the stately old buildings, of the cathedral and the grand mansions, of the university and lower school buildings.  He remembered the clatter and call of the market streets, the faint smell of fresh vegetables and damp dirt.
“Oh, she will be.” Jess crossed her arms over her chest, one hip popped out.  “So we were playing touch football with everyone, because we’re idiots, and it went about as well as can be expected, because no one in our circle of ‘friends’ has any measure of self-control, and the Ms. Suave and Sophisticated comes up to me, slaps me on the back and says-” She paused.  “And I quote, she says, ‘Good game, Drew.  If you weren’t straight, I’d ask you out.’”
But Rogers just rolled his eyes and straightened up.  "A lot of things are overrated, and I guess that does depend on who's doing the rating, doesn't it?"  He smiled at DJ, who was playing idly with the clock innards  "Want to go outside?"
“God grant me the strength not to strangle him in his sleep,” Jarvis said, the words so tart that they were nearly curdled, and Rhodey choked on a laugh.  Jarvis gave him a look out of the corner of his eyes.  “Too much?”
“See, Steve keeps pressuring me to accept these cocktail party invitations with all the other costumed lunatics in this city, and I’ve never had a concrete reason as to why other than, you know, absolutely not wanting to bother, but now?” Tony shook his head, and tossed a fistful of goldfish into his mouth.  “Now I’ve got a reason.”
“I mean, I technically did,” Tony said.  He leaned against the workbench.  “Wow.  Now that you say it, yes.  I guess I did.”  He straightened up.  “He's kind of a lab accident, I mean, a lot of kids aren't precisely planned, but DJ does take it to an entirely new level, which is kind of funny when you-”  He glanced up, and caught the look on her face.  Tony arched his eyebrows.  “Not funny?”
T’Challa’s eyes were hooded.  “It was a concern,” he said.  He smiled at Steve.  “We have not known you long, but…”
“It’s entirely possible,” Clea said with a bright smile.  The pages ripped free of the spine with a sound like a scream.  She tossed them cheerfully over her shoulder.  “I’m rather hoping he’ll find Wong.”
Tony glanced back over his shoulder.  Steve was standing in the door from the kitchen stairs, carrying a fresh basket of split logs in one hand, the shoulders of his sheepskin dusted with snow.  His heavy boots rang on the marble floor as he walked to the fireplace.  “Ah.”  Tony leaned back on his hands, a slight smile on his face.  "And why is this delivery so late?"
He slid two fried eggs onto a plate, holding it out without  even glancing over his shoulder.  Natasha took it from him on her way past, adding two pieces of toast to it and sliding it over to Bruce.  “Doc.”
"Neither am I, but I'm nosy as hell," Carol said, not budging.  She waved a hand at the hallway.  "Go.  We'll catch up."
Steve blinked at him.  It took him two tries to get a single word past the lump in his throat.  "What?"
“Don't worry,” Steve said, wrapping his arms around Clint's waist as he started his slow, inevitable descent towards the floor.  “I've-   This has actually happened to me before.”  He heaved Clint up.  “I'll just-”
Steve put the lid on the teapot and moved it to the counter next to a stack of Chinese style teacups.  “Stop making a mess,” he said, his voice mild as he opened the oven door, pulling out the box of crab rangoon he’d hidden there.  Dangling the wire handle from one finger, he held it out to Tony with a smile.  “And maybe give your teammates the benefit of the doubt.”
“You should be, you do enough of it,” Harris said, and Tony’s head snapped in his direction, his mouth hanging open.  Harris held his hands up.  “Yeah, I said it.”
“You know the rules, but you are pretty selective about following them,” Steve said.  He gave Clint a look out of the corner of his eye.  “Star Wars?”
DJ considered Tony, his lips a thin line, his eyes narrowed.  Tony pushed the cat off of his lap, nudging it gently down to the floor.  It hopped right back up, purring up a storm, and rubbing its cheek against the edge of his tablet.  DJ stared at the cat, then gave Tony a very suspicious look.  “This is a borrowed cat,” Tony said, giving up as the animal rubbed against his jaw.  “It does not belong here.”
Stephen Strange sighed, a faint, almost inaudible exhalation, and Tony resisted the very real urge to lunge over the workbench, straight for his throat.  Steve, who knew him a little too well, rested a hand on his shoulder, half comfort and half restraint, and Tony sucked in a long, slow breath from between clenched teeth.  “You lost-”
Jarvis nodded, settling the hat on top of the coat.  “Yes, sir.  Mr. Stark was quite adamant.  I would be happy to escort Officer Rogers, if you’d prefer not to-”
He stopped.  The fire was crackling on the hearth, a heavy iron pot hanging over the flames.  The room was filled with the comforting smell of wood smoke and bubbling stew.  A loaf of bread was sitting on the wooden table, along with a stack of bowls and a pitcher.
Tony picked up a mini cream puff from what used to be Steve’s plate and popped it in his mouth.  “Pretty sure Jan’s convinced Jarvis to lock me out of my lab, so you should have the pleasure of my company for a little while.” He gave Steve a wink.  “Don’t get used to it.”
He pushed forward, and he had no idea where ‘forward’ was anymore.  He had no idea where he was going, if it was the right way, if there was a way, if there was anything other than the place where he was, like being trapped in a kaleidoscope, always shifting, always turning, the world altering catastrophically with every single step.
Clea on the third floor glanced down a the Clea in the stairs.  “What did I think that would accomplish?” she asked, and went back to flipping through her book.  The pages appeared to be on fire.
“Rogers!”  Happy stepped off the curb, his hands on his hips, and Steve accelerated, heading straight for him.
Harris’ head appeared at the end of the aisle.  “How…  Would that work?  With the flying?  And the-” He gestured at his chest.  “Missiles?”
“Yes, but this time, you did it in front of everyone.”  He did not sound amused.  Clint winced.  “A giant robot threw a bus, and for once, that giant robot wasn't aiming at you, and you chose to run directly into the path of that bus.  In front of everyone.”
It took him a moment, a moment where he took in the solid, warm weight of the body tucked against his, sprawled half over him. Tony was curled against him, one arm thrown over Steve's chest, his hair tickling Steve's jaw. Something was thrown over them, a blanket, and he didn't know where it had come from, he didn't know where they were, but he remembered the weight of Tony's leg against his, the way Tony's breath eased over his skin, slow and even. The smell of Tony's hair was already familiar, the warmth of his skin, the lines of his shoulders, his arms.
