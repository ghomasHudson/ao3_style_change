“I don’t care how sodding old you are now, if you live under my roof you are going to follow my rules.” John’s dad growled as he pulled him away from Sherlock. “You can’t just flip off in the middle of the night to God knows where without a word.” Sherlock moved in front of the pair once more and cleared his throat, interrupting the man as he made to continue his lecture.
Which of course did not mean that Sherlock stopped being the insufferable child he always was. It did mean that John could start coming back to the long-suffering, reliable, and loyal doctor Sherlock had always admired. It meant taking cases from Scotland Yard once more, nearly killing Donovan when Sherlock laced his fingers with John’s easily at a particularly challenging crime scene. Sherlock had claimed it was to help him focus but John suspected it was mainly for Donovan’s reaction. Lestrade had merely rolled his eyes and huffed as if to say
“Do you even know how much I’ve done for this family?” Mr. Holmes asked levelly. “I’m the only reason you have this house and I think I deserve a bit more respect than this.” Sherlock bristled a bit, glaring at the man in front of him.
When Sherlock returned to his hotel, the cheapest and most appalling one nearest to the hospital chosen simply so that his brother would not follow, he sat at the edge of his bed and stared at the door for a long moment. Closing his eyes, he cleared his thoughts of all the cobwebs that had collected throughout the day. Sherlock pushed and shoved and deleted until nothing but empty, malleable space remained, and then he started with the smell of biscuits.
“Do either of you have anything else to say on the matter?” The question was met with silence and Dr. Grundy turned to Sherlock in frustration. “Surely, you have something to say. With the show you put on upon arriving, I’m surprised it was your brother, and not you, who argued with me when I suggested extending your mum’s stay.”
Sherlock wondered if he would have to physically push past his father before the man slowly stepped aside. Each step Sherlock took past the man and through the front door was calculated and careful. Not too fast as to be classified as a retreat and not too slow as to be seen as frightened. It was nearly ridiculous and once the door was closed behind him Sherlock resumed his normally quick pace to the unattached garage.
Sherlock grinned slyly. “I guess I’ll just have to learn to share then.”
“Word travels.” John smirked. Sherlock grabbed the pillow behind him and threw it at John who ducked with a laugh. The pillow landed on top of Marlowe, who hadn’t deemed it necessary to follow the two men into the living room. The cat gave a yelp and then ran indignantly off to the bedroom.
me.” He said attempting to struggle out of Sherlock’s embrace yet again. This time Sherlock tightened his arms, hooking his chin over John’s shoulder, and squeezing his eyes shut.
“Yes.”
“Mrs. Holmes, I understand your desire to be at home, however, I am not convinced it would be the best decision. You say that your sons live over three hours away in London and your husband seems to be a very busy man…” Dr. Grundy stood with his arms crossed at the foot of Mrs. Holmes’ bed. The starch white lab coat, carefully gelled hair, and singular crease to the front of the doctor’s undershirt gave away his affair with one of the nurses. Sherlock presumed it would be the one who had come in, not once but twice, to “check on his mother” since the doctor had come to discuss Mrs. Holmes’ discharge.
hospitals.” Sherlock spat as Mycroft made himself comfortable in one of the chairs lined against the wall. His brother leaned back and watched as Sherlock began to pace the length of the room agitatedly. An hour passed before Mycroft snapped.
“Molly?” Sherlock prompted.
“I’m sorry,” John paused uncertainly. “Did I wake you?”
All eyes in the room turned to look at Sherlock with varying expressions of warning, frustration, and expectancy. Mycroft was hiding grey hairs, it was obvious that the shade of his hair color was a bit off which meant he was dying it. The man would only dye his hair, and dye it nearly the exact same color as it was originally, if he were hiding grey hairs. It was just a matter of cause then; stress or age?
“I don’t mind you know… The staring I mean.” Sherlock’s eyes widened but he kept them glued to the screen. Every muscle in his body was taught to the point of aching.
. He replied distantly. Somewhere in the house Mycroft was returning to his room, having only had one drink and the smallest portion of dinner his mum allowed he’d still feel an inevitable need to rededicate himself to some diet or other in the morning. Sherlock prayed he wouldn’t be back at the toilet.
“Ah, there you are. Tea?” Sherlock startled imperceptibly at the sudden sound of that deep voice above him. With the slight nod of his head Sherlock let his arm fall to his chest and opened his eyes to stare into the green above him. How had Sherlock missed that undercurrent of worry, even apprehension, in John’s loyal gaze? The two men stared at each other for an indeterminable number of seconds, each lost in their own thoughts, before John gave a quiet
“John?” The second person to call the students name that day had a voice decidedly less cheerful than Mrs. Hudson’s. “Who is this?” Sherlock glanced up at the man moving to stand at the edge of their table.
Another hour passed before the flight attendants’ shoulders collectedly relaxed and it was announced that boarding would finally begin for the flight to Ireland. As Sherlock queued for his seat on the plane Eliot glanced at his own ticket and then up at Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shoved his phone back into its pocket just as the metal doors of the lift began to peel open. The front lobby of the staff office building was as empty and silent as it ever was. Really, it was more of a glorified hallway than a proper lobby. Off to the left of the lift was a secretarial desk where Anderson stood scrolling through their phone; on the right were two doors leading to the bathrooms and a few sofas. Shoved in the corner between the front doors and the first of the sofas was a small stand with cheap coffee set out.
, Sherlock took a deep, steadying breath.
“What was that?” Sherlock shook his head and John shrugged. “It doesn’t have to be today, though. If you wanted to watch the new episode of the show, we were watching?” John’s blush showed no signs of giving up or fading and Sherlock cocked his head to the side.
Sherlock thought as his eyes drifted from the cats to the thighs of the man in front of him. A strange, desperate urge to bite John brought back the flushing urgency to be as close to this man as possible. It was a desire that had begun to settle under Sherlock’s skin back on the couch. His heart was racing, his skin burning, Sherlock pulled back from John and then gently gripped the student’s face pressing their lips together before he changed his mind.
Mummy was still in the study. The dark circles beneath her eyes and the slight shake to her fingers betrayed the return of her insomnia. She might have a glass or two more, maybe a Whisky or a Screwdriver, before pulling herself from her chair and making the journey into her bedroom. The longer she waited the less the risk of finding her husband still tossing and turning beneath the sheets. The less the risk of finding his eyes watching as she dressed down and slipped on her nightgown. Sherlock shut the path his thoughts had taken off.
The professor hesitated, considering. It wasn’t often his mother spoke, let alone argued for something. If he ignored her now it would just serve to further encourage her lasting silence. Ignoring his mother’s request would certainly not help any with her increasingly frequent suicide attempts. Mycroft opened his mouth to speak just as Sherlock pulled a chair from the table and reluctantly sat down, allowing the duffel to slide to the floor beside his chair. Across the table, Mycroft nodded approvingly and Mrs. Holmes beamed.
“Will you
“Why would I have offered it otherwise?”
“How many times do I have to tell you, I’m not as nice as you seem to assume I am? I wouldn’t give my left hand to save Anderson’s life, I’d be more willing to give up my sight than do a favour for anyone, and I give my students research essays as a punishment for annoying me.” Sherlock leaned back to glare into John’s eyes. “I’m asking you because I
Sherlock let his head fall to one side and his gaze fixed on the dresser beside the bedroom door.
Sherlock slid gracefully from his seat, forcing the man to shift out of his way and crane his neck to meet Sherlock’s eye. “Doctor Sherlock Holmes. I teach Biochemical Engineering and Criminal Pathology at John’s University.” The man’s hand twitched as if anticipating a handshake but Sherlock coldly ignored him to turn back to John. To the eyes that were flickering between Sherlock and his father, between appreciation and fear. The man’s brow furrowed in confusion.
Wow, this last chapter has taken me so incredibly long to post and I am sorry for the wait! I lost my will to create for awhile and while I really wanted to finish this fic I just never had the energy for it. For those of you who have stuck with me I thank you from the bottom of my heart! Every kudos and comment and bookmark gave me a spur of confidence and hope that I can actually create something that people will like and that kind of encouragement is priceless. Thank you all so much!
Sherlock noticed, and began tapping a finger against his chin as he looked into the mid distance.
“Well, that was a bit rude, dear.” Mrs. Holmes said at last.
“That’s not necessarily the truth, is it?” Wide eyes looked back at Sherlock’s and the flush across John’s cheeks deepened.
file had gone down considerably when a plate landed beside Sherlock’s thigh. Marlowe stretched along Sherlock’s opposite thigh, tail thumping Sherlock’s hip as the cat looked lazily up at the man above them.
A foot lightly kicked Sherlock’s leg, snapping him back to reality. The John Watson that greeted him from the corner of the sofa was decidedly not stern, nor was he wearing any green. His face and muscles had gone slack with sleep. The bruises on his eye and upper arm seemed darker now than when he first came in. John’s foot had slipped as he fell asleep.
Marlowe was curled up on the arm above the spot watching some speck of dust, or stray piece of lint, shift inconspicuously through the air. The cat had also been acting oddly in John’s absence. Marlowe had taken to looking into each room at various times of day and then coming up to meow disapprovingly at Sherlock’s feet when he found each one empty. The tabby barely tolerated anyone but Sherlock, the fact that he had taken so quickly to John was also rather puzzling.
“Sherlock?” The professor’s breath caught in his throat as he felt more than heard John shift on the coach beside him. Suddenly his view was obstructed by a looming blonde figure.
The hamper bin is, unsurprisingly, full.
John stared up into those familiar eyes silently. In the time it took to breathe shakily in and out his lips were crashing into Sherlock’s. One hand came up to grasp at the man’s shoulder while the other hand tangled in Sherlock’s dark curls. The detective gave a strangled, desperate noise and began to kiss back fervently. A hand twisted once more into the doctor’s hair while the other clutched at his back pressing him close and holding him in place. Sherlock leaned back until John was practically in his lap, leaning over him, the kiss unforgiving and messy. Their teeth catching at lips, clicking against each other, tongues laving against the other’s. Nails dug into skin. Stubble, yet to be shaved from the previous night, burned faintly as it rubbed against skin. The rough mess of a kiss was so full of emotion that it drew out sobs as well as moans and ended in the form of truce.
“Well, if you need help with any of your classes I have plenty of textbooks. You could come over and use it as an excuse to see the cats.” John could have sworn Sherlock was twisting his leg yet the offer didn’t feel like a joke. He paused, surely the professor wasn’t inviting him to come to his house for study sessions; that would just be inappropriate.
“This conversation isn’t over.” Sherlock ground out through clenched teeth. “You can’t treat her like this.” Mr. Holmes signed the bottom of the page with a bit more force than was needed and took another sheet. “You could spare a moment to at least drive to the hospital with her. She was dying!” Mr. Holmes sighed and slammed his pen down on the table.
“I have to leave.” John said quietly, glaring at the phone in his hand. Sherlock picked apart the corner of the sofa with his own gaze.
That night John woke with a broken sob to find himself immediately wrapped in long pale arms. His cheek was pressed against a bare chest and the calm, even beats of Sherlock’s heart lulled him back to sleep. Just before he slipped back into unconsciousness he felt the warm press of lips against his forehead.
Sherlock thought he was being rather inconspicuous about it as well until John huffed a laugh and turned to him at a commercial break about halfway through.
“I don’t care.” John sang back. Sherlock frowned at John before pushing off the counter and going to unpack his bag. When everything was thrown back roughly where it belonged he walked back out and slouched into one of the dining room chairs. John was already sat at the other, one plate in front of him and another at the spot Sherlock now occupied. Two cups of tea also sat on the table.
“I wonder how long that will last.” The challenge hung in the air between them thickening like a physically barrier. It was one Sherlock dared not acknowledge. Letting his father bring up the past and the time Sherlock had been kicked from his apartment and fired for using illegal substances would only end in hurt pride. Sherlock hadn’t touched an ounce of the stuff since he grabbed his current job at the University and Lestrade had helped him off the cigarettes and benders. He hadn’t fallen into any vices in years and yet that wouldn’t deter his father from holding it against his character.
“I’ll take some tea.” Sherlock said, stooping down to give Allan a few rubs of attention before stepping into the kitchen to give Marlowe’s chin a few scratches. John barely looked up from his task as Sherlock maneuvered into his personal space to get at the cat in his arms.
“I have no one to watch my cat. Or to water my plants.”
“Enough,” Sherlock sat straighter in his chair as Mrs. Holmes began to speak for the first time since waking. It was rare for him to hear her voice so clearly and, as horrible as it made him feel afterwards, he rather looked forwards to the few times when someone provoked her over the scars and bandages she did so little to hide. It was always when someone came to her supposed rescue that Sherlock and Mycroft’s mum seemed most in control of herself and steadfast. Her shoulders set back in a pose to challenge Achilles, her chin held high in defiance, her slim hands rested one atop the other as if it were not a hospital bed but a throne that she sat upon.
“Why did you come here?” Sherlock asked quietly. John’s cheeks reddened and he looked away. Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he frowned further. “I mean you barely know me. I’m sure you have people you know better and would feel more comfortable with.” John gave a short laugh and shook his head.
It wasn’t that Sherlock lacked enthusiasm to share his deductions and the reasoning behind his knowledge; Sherlock desperately wanted to jump into the list of things he had noticed as soon as he had opened his door to see John standing in the hall. But, it had been a little over a week since Sherlock had last seen John and when he imagined that indescribably handsome face twisting into scorn or those lips forming the all too familiar word “freak” his stomach flipped and twisted up to crowd against his ribs.
“The writers of this show are absolutely ridiculous.” Sherlock snorted, pushing around the noodles in his carton. John glance over at the professor and smiled. “The elder brother clearly has feelings for that scruffy looking man. They should’ve been together three seasons ago.”
“I don’t have a job. All I have is what allowance my father gives me every week, and he is on my account…” Sherlock grinned.
“But, you didn’t even eat anything!” Sherlock merely shrugged, placing his card in the slot and then catching their server’s eye to signal that he was ready to pay. The table between them was empty except for John’s plate, silverware and napkin neatly stacked on top of it. It had taken a solid three minutes for Sherlock to successfully threaten John into picking something off the regular menu instead of the children’s; He wasn’t leaving any room to start another argument over the bill.
The muscles in his fingers twitched as he glanced down at John’s hand but he stubbornly kept them at his side.
“I may not know everything about your family, but I know enough.” Sherlock paused and then forced himself to continue. “Trust me, respect isn’t saying how high when he asks you to jump. Respect isn’t flinching away from his hands when he reaches out to you. Respect isn’t letting him bruise your skin and fracture your bones. Respect isn’t letting someone tear you to pieces just because they fed and clothed you for most of your life. It was his decision to keep you and it is his responsibility to take care of you, and you owe him nothing.”
“I’m not that hungry.” John nodded and turned away glancing around the room that he had spent the last week staring at.
(See the end of the chapter for
As the ending credits of the show scrolled past the screen John cleared his throat. “Well, I think it’s time for me to go.” Sherlock looked up as John stood from the sofa. Marlowe jumped from the back of the sofa and landed on the floor, walking to John and rubbing against his legs. “I’m going to miss these cats.” He said smiling fondly at the tabby.
“Hello,” Sherlock said after a too long pause, finally shutting the door behind him as an excuse to look away from the man. John turned back to the counter where he had a few sandwich ingredients neatly spread over the counter. He had been making a sandwich with just his right-hand instead of putting Marlowe down and using both like any normal person. Sherlock was definitely
“Anyways, just because you’re an arse to your students doesn’t mean you’re that way in person.” Sherlock’s frown deepened, he bit his cheek to keep it that way though technically John wouldn’t have been able to tell either way.
“Well, I wasn’t.” Mr. Holmes unfolded his arms and settled forwards in his chair, taking a sheet of paper from the stack and setting it before him. He began to read calmly, completely ignoring his son who stood trembling before him.
“Father, Doctor Holmes is the man that hired me to watch his flat and his cats while he was out of town.” John interrupted before Sherlock could reply. The student’s tone was ridged, controlled, far from the tone he took when he had been speaking with Sherlock. And that posture more fit into Sherlock’s brief military doctor fantasy than a student slogging through med school.
“Sure.” Sherlock said after a second. John gestured to the, still untouched sandwich in front of him.
“Oh, let me get that for you.” He said, taking the three strides to her and bending over to grab the few envelopes.
On the one hand, I hated the man standing in front of me, on the other hand, I really needed the information.
"Good evening, John."
He pulled me up by my shirt and pressed me down onto the table. I felt some of the things scattered on there press roughly into my back.
"John, you've been working at our department for quite a while now. And to be honest, I don't know how to put it into words."
"And that would be...?", I asked and fliched.
“Excuse me?”, I barked back, a little confused, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
I felt my heart skip a beat once I found myself unable to move.
Hopkins shrugged. "Less work for us especially if he did the job right."
"I shoudl kill you right here and right now, but that would be no fun, would it?", he whispered in my ear, sending chills down my spine.
"Vampire", I mumblred to myself once I saw the bite mark on her delicate neck.
"Is probably in his office", I thought out loud.
"Yes, thank you. I just explanied your collegue what the culprit looked like."
"I need to go somewhere else. Don't wait for me, go back to Scotland Yard."
“I’m not yet turned”, I said, “I can still do my work.”
I stared at my hands, which were resting on top of my lap.
I then meet an impatiently waiting Lestrade. "Everything's alright", I said with an taunting look. "We didn't need to come here."
“Come”, Emma then said to me and extended her hand. “We better get going.”
Sitting in the cab, I placed my hands onto my lap and thought about Lara Owen. A hidden inverstigation wasn't a bad idea after all and I decided to chance my destination. But once I found myself in Lara Owens living room, I finally realised how plain stupid this idea was.
"Scotland Yard!", I shouted, "DSO!"
Then he pulled me on my feet and I saw, that I could only barely stand and stumbled after him back to the ball room. As we left the private room, I saw Molly running towards us with widened eyes but as she saw Sherlock, she stopped.
With slightly shaking hands I accepted the present.
"What is it?", he asked amused, "Do you want me to leave or not?"
I looked at Lestrade for a moment and then lowered my eyes to the ground.
I wanted to respond to Molly but suddenly felt a wave of nausea coming over me and pressed my hand onto my mouth to not vomit right on the spot.
"I'll go left, you go right?", I asked Baynes, who looked at me with furrowed brows.
"Well, this is probably the friend you've mentioned", Sherlock said and eyed Molly, "A doctor, I see."
I tried to cover my chest with my arms in shame. Sherlock on the other ahnd ruffled his hair in confusion with one hand and supported his body with the other ahdn he rested on a chair.
“What are you doing here?”, I shouted at the tall, dark-haired man in front of me crouching on the floor.
I coughed a few times until I could breathe properly again. "Yeah, I think so."
I tried to look around but I couldn't tell where we were.
I tried to push him away from me, but his lips were locked with mine and I hadn't had any strength left to fight. As Sherlock finally released me from the kiss, I tried to gasp for air and tried to hold onto him, to not fall to the ground. To my surprise, Sherlock supported me.
"There already are DSOs on the spot and I need you here."
"The Department for Supernatural Occurences."
“I don’t know”, Molly whispered.
I followed the hunters outside, they called a cab and brought me home safely. I invited them into my flat and before they left, Daniel left me a piece of advice.
Wakefield nooded. "Take your time."
Sherlock then continued to watch me squirm in pain for a while, not saying anything.
"Baynes!", Lestrade shouted and a tall, dark-haired man in a grey coat approached us. "Please do accompany John. I won't let him go on his own."
"Don't be scared, dear", he whispered into my ear and I felt his breath against my skin. Then I felt his cold lips against my neck and was startled because by now, I couldn't move at all anymore.
It was a bit cool outside but not too cold. Without looking for anything, I roamed the streets. Sometimes it can be really nice to just have wind blowing around your ears. But sadly, this calmness wouldn't stay for long, then soon I reached the place where I found Lara Owen and to my surprise I was greeted with a similar scenery. I drew my Lancaster and pointed it onto the man in front of me.
"Why am I here?", I hissed.
“Yes, indeed. I’m not yet sure to why this is, but I have a couple of ideas why this might be.”
"You're afraid. The same way when we first met", Sherlock reasoned amused, "Why is that? What makes you so afraid of me?"
I jumped when I heard the woman inhaling air sharply and turned around. She was breathing in short quick breaths and had her fingers clithed onto the collar of her dress. I touched the Lancaster and put it into my waistband to have it handy. Closing in, the woman turned her head and asked something that I didn't understand again.
I turned my head and that moment Sherlock was gone. I fell onto my knees and gasped for air. The spot Sherlock touched me was hurting badly.
"Yes. The Case of Jason Brending. What if it
"John!", I heard Lestrade shout and then felt strong arms bringing me on my feet, "Are you alright?"
But the tall figure didn't budge an inch.
Lestrade widned his eyes. "John, you can always take a few days off, you know? I mean, it's a bit difficult at the moment, but if you really need some free time..:"
"Correct. So, I was on one of my patrols", I made a short pause, "And I, well, I ran into a vampire. Everything went well, mostly."
“Are you by any chance a descendant of wizards?”, Sherlock asked.
I decided to give her first-aid first and noticed that her body temperature was decreasing rapidly. I grabbed the telephone and called Scotland Yard. I nervously waited for a connection.
The woman gave me a nod. "Yes, of course."
Lestarde and I moved away from the scene as I became more nauseous.
I was startled by another knock and haistly rushed down the stairs.
The man and the woman exchanged worries gazes.
Luckily, nothing much happend that night but Hopkins didn't seem to return to Scotland Yard. After multiple inquieries, I found out that Hopkins had called Lestrade that night and told him, that he went home earlier because he didn't feel well.
Sherlock laughed. "Please don't be like that, Milady. Come, let's amuse ourselfs."
"Good evening", I surprisedly greeted a woman standing in front of me with big eyes. She pressed a hand onto her neck.
This moment the door opened and Lestrade came in.
Sherlock took a deep breath. “Has it ever occurred to you that the murderer you are looking for is targeting you?”
"Everyting alright?", I asked.
"We'll meet again in a few hours", I heard him laugh before he closed the door.
I nooded. "Whatever we can do to help."
I suddenly was wide awake and sat up straight in my bed. “Leave!”, I shouted and clutched my blanked tighter. A cold hand was still holding my wrist.
The corners of Sherlock’s mouth curved slightly upwards. “More or less.”
“You bastard!”, I managed to wheeze at him, “How dare you?”
"Lestrade, what's the real reason I'm here?", I then asked and my colleague stopped at once.
“I don’t know”, Sherlock said pondering. “Not many of us night dwellers approach the church too much, there must be a way that he’s able to enter it anyways.”
"What happened?", I asked and sat down next to him, opposite to his desk, "You said it was nothing too dangerous?"
The woman stared to sob and I placed my hand onto her knee to calm her down. "You don't need to tell me more, I know the rest. Do you remember what the man looked like?"
When did he stop referring to me as Dr. Watson anyways?
"Everything's alright, yes", he affirmed.
I shook with fear as he came closer, the wound not seeming to stop him, so I took another shoot. And a third one. By then, Sherlock was standing right in front of me grabbing me by the shoulders with bloodied hands and pressing me into a wall again.
Sherlock chuckled lowly. “Exactly.”
"John Watson? Come in, it's cold outside!", revenant Blair Wakefield invited me into the chruch. And together we took our seats in the first row.
Lestrade took in a sharp inhale and looked at me with a strong look. “We are not done talking yet.”
"Calm yourself", she whispered, "I'm going to go away for a while."
"This ... actually explains a lot", he then said, eyes darting around the room.
I heard feet shuffling and a moment later, Sherlock appeared in my field of view, my heart going into overdrive of the realization of what had happened.
“The bond will be broken if you’re finally dead!”
"Nah, we'll be too suspicious to be guests", he said but for the next twenty minutes, nobody had another idea.
“Did … did it work?, I asked myself and twisted the golden thing in my hand. The door creaked but I suddenly was flung backwards. I stumbled, hit my head on the table and again sunk down to the floor.
"Yes. Of course", I said with a faked smile.
“No! At least, not that I would know of”, I said trying to recollect my memories, “But maybe…”
"But I think it's time to give you a promotion."
"Lestrade!", I cried, "I need some guys over here at my flat!"
"Hopkins?", I cried out after I found myself on the cold hard pavement. Blood was dripping from his mouth onto my face and I accidently pulled the trigger.
to you?”, he asked almost panicked.
The woman shook her head.
"Shhh...Quiet", Sherlock said and strocked my hair.
She said something I didn't understand and then seemingly became unconcious. I managed to caught her on time and brang her to my flat without second thought and put her on the sofa. She seemed to breathe shallowly.
"Want to give it a try?"
"John...John Watson!", I said back before I left.
"Just for safety, John."
“The hospital is not far from here, I was just on my way home”, she explained.
The Monster suddenly turned around and I amlost dropped my weapon. I was so startled, I could've been just thrown to the ground. The eyes staring at me were glowing red, but the face ... og the face was all to familliar.
"Brending."
"Your blood is of an uniquely good quality, Dr. Watson. You cannot waste it like he would've done."
"Fantastic. The watchmen have captured some men. Would you care to take a look at them?"
Lestrade gave me a crooked smile. "Seems like it. But someone's gotta tell the lady that she needs to be careful and that she should stay away from any public events for the next few weeks.
"You mean the man that was seen with you that night?", the man asked and I nodded to confirm.
I sighed and we took two of the chairs in the room to sit on. Then, I started explaining. Lestrade, who has listened attentively, scratched his chin.
“He wants to make me his servant. He gave me his blood”, I explained.
"So you want to be my company at the next festive?", Lara asked.
“Please, don’t-“, I whimpered and I actually felt like he was considering.
"We ... we should tell Lestrade about this", he said absent minded.
"I am truly sorry, if I caused you two any trouble for coming here", the woman apologised, "May I get you something? A cup of tea or coffee?"
My vision went blurry again and kept me from another snarky remark, so Sherlock continued: “Don’t worry, I will not turn you into my kind. I don’t need your hatred against me amplified by vampiric powers.”
"It's not your first time", Lestarde said to calm me down, "Yeah, well your first hunt with your own weapon, but not your first hunt. You know what I mean."
"Baynes?", Hopkins asked and the only thing I could do was nod.
"Say", Banyes then murttered, "Have you heard something from Hopkins?"
"I...I want to help people. I always wanted but I just didn't know how and I got this job by accident. I was bothered by a ghost and the DSO helped me. I was so amazed by their work that I wanted to join them. I didn't like the hunting like most others."
Wakefield kept quiet.
“What should I do then?”, I said frustrated, my hands covering my face.
I gulped down a bit of my fear. “Just who are you two?”
Slowly, I tried to move her hand from her neck and noticed all the blood running onto her clothes. I wasn't surprised to find a vampire bite on her neck.
“You annoy me”, Sherlock said, a disgusted look on his face, “Get lost before I decide otherwise.”
"How could you help me?"
"Lestrade-!"
Frustrated, I buried my head into my hands. "I don't know!"
I gritted my teeth, but I didn't move when Sherlock wanted to leave my flat.
like a human. I feel pain like a human."
I bit my lower lip. "Have you heard about someone called Sherlock Holmes?"
To my surprise, Sherlock suddenly backed away. In the dim light I saw a rim of blue eyes, as if they were illuminated like lightbulbs from the inside and the widely dilated pupils.
I narrowed my eyes.
The next night, Lestrade gave me a setback.
I lowered my voice in disgust. “Is that why you gave me your blood? So we don’t hunt you down?”
I bit my tongue unable to respond anything snarkier.
"Wh-what is that supposed to mean?", I asked a bit angered.
Once I opened the door, I felt a strange kind of aura. I didn't know what it was but it surely didn't seem right. Carefully, to hear every sound, I went up the stairs and got my pistol ready. I quickly opened the door with a kick and got ready to shoot. I really had to restrain myself from shooting. Right before me, on a chair with an ear to ear grin, was sitting Sherlock Holmes and he was looking at me with his perfect grin.
"Av... a woman?!", he cried out in surprise.
Molly carefully stroked my back. "Everything's gonna be alright."
“Have you considered that your dear Reverent Wakefield is actually a Revenant?”
"Have we met before?", Sherlock asked and I flinched.
We stopped at a crossroad.
Lestrade let go of me immediatly. "John..."
I couldn't tell how much time had passed. The room was always dark, I had completely lost my feeling of time. My heart grew heavy once I heard shoes on stone once again. But this time it as two pairs of shoes. The door opened and I saw two sillouettes enter. One taller and more masculine, the other shorter and more feminine, clearly in a dress.
“I have no clue what you are talking about”, I said steadily and truthfully.
We walked through the twilight and I used my chance to ask Baynes something: "Did you take care of the poltergeist yesterday? You could've told us!"
"I will", I whispered and felt something cold when revenant Wakefield placed his hand ontop of mine.
I suddenly froze in fear and let Daniel continue.
to not recognise her?"
"What's so special about you?", he said slightly closing in, "Is there a secret you have I haven't figured out?"
With the blink of an eye, the man was gone and I was left again, this time only shivering.
The woman moved her hand to her neck to check on the bite and didn't avert her gaze from me for a second and touched the plaster slightly with her fingertips.
"Ah!", the man cried out in laughter, "You must be an aquaintance of the host then!"
Frustrated, I let the restraints be restraints and heard footsteps getting gradually louder. The hollow sound of heels on stone. A door was opened and and light came in, blinding me for a short time. Due to the light, I couldn't see the face of the person who had entered the room.
“Let me go!”, I wheezed and tried to loosen Sherlock’s hands from my neck. I felt the edges of my vision getting blurry.
"Oh, shut up!", Lestrade shouted, I never heard him getting this angry. "You two are highly suspicious and we'll keep you here until we know more aout that nest!"
I followed Lestrade outside and we walked a while through the downtown until I could see ploicemen from afar. I slowed my walking pace in shock.
"It is", said Lestrade and kneeled beside me, ""But take a look at this."
Lestrade was about to open his mouth, but once he took a good long look at my face, I saw him freeze.
I gulped to speak more clearly. "I...it was self defense."
“You’re keeping a secret. Maybe even from yourself”, Sherlock continued, “What is it?”
"Stay back!", I tried to sound brave and icgone the fact that I was shaking.
"Revenant Wakefield!", I cried out relieved, "Thank God, you're still here as late as it is!"
A groan escaped my mouth as I tried to get up from my horizontal state and felt my head spinning even more.
On our way to the woman's place, I felt like we were being watched. It's probably just my fear of meeting Sherlock Holmes again but Hopkins seemed to have the same problem.
“Oh, and what do you think they will do to you?”, he asked back coldly. “Now that you’re on the verge of becoming a vampire’s servant?”
"Please come in for a moment", the woman said, "just until I have found my friend."
I forced on a smile. "Well, he did attack an innocent woman. She's alright, luckily, but what would've happened if I didn't show up?" I rubbed my upper arms to warm myself up, I was suddenly freezing.
"Wait, let me go", I said and started to panic once Sherlock gripped my wrist tighter.
If I thought he was rough at me that last night I saw him, I was clearly wrong. I felt his fingernails dig into my shoulders, even through the fabric of my coat and shirt, his breath going quick and unsteady against my skin. Violently, he ripped open the collar of my shirt, buttons falling to the ground with a quiet rattle.
"But why is it impossible for me to her his name in the streets?", I then asked scepticly, "Somebody could've talked about the case, couldn't they?"
He let go of me and I slid to the floor, gasping for air.
"Would you like to dance with me?", he asked and offered his hand. He musn't recognise my voice, so I ran my closed fan through my hand.
“What on earth has happened to you?”, she asked examining my beaten-up face carefully.
I forced myself not to answer.
I poured myself a glass of water. As I took a few sips, I heard a knocking on my door. I choked on my drink and went to the door coughing. Once I passed the window, I saw something there from the corners of my eyes. And I saw a bat sitting there after I turned my head. I grabbed a broom near me and opened the window.
"No", I whimpered, frustrated at my own weakness. Sherlock was right. I was weaker than him and that made me afraid.
"So you're not interested in how your dear collague died?"
"You're dead!", I interrupted his monologue.
"Right."
"Oh, John Watson", Sherlock purred, "You're so easy to suss."
"I do", Sherlock giggled and moved closer, "That's why I enjoy it so much."
"Molly? What are you doing here?", I asked the impish grinning woman.
I fell into her arms with no strength left.
"Yes!", I cried out surprised, "Breathe deeply. Deeply like profoundly!"
Sherlock swayed back to the chair. "I could tell who who it might be, but I'm not good at thinking with a gun to my head."
"No I'm not lying! I swear!", I lied and hold my hands in front of me. "Maybe I just got the name wrong?"
"Just now, Sir", he apologised, "The body seems to be fresh, one hour old, The Bobbys found it."
"What are you doing here?", I asked angrily after we entered a private room.
Molly’s eyes widened in concern. “What did he do to you?”
We took the woman to the infirmary which we luckily had for a month now. As I layed the woman down onto the sickbed, Lestrade already wanted to leave.
"Excuse me?", I stuttered.
"Yes I can. It's quite obvious from the black blood on your right sleeve."
"Take this", he said and I opened my hand. He placed a silver necklace with an crucifix charm into my palm.
I got closer and put my pistol to the man's head.
I looked at Lestrade shocked about his outburst of anger and once he noticed how harshly he has spoken to me, he looked to the ground and left without saying another word.
"The Case of Jason..."
"This man", I said, "is a vampire."
gentleman?", Molly asked amused.
"I could help you. Provide you with information", he said with a wry smile.
I fixed my scarf and croaked: "I think I will patrol through London a bit. I can't handle a dead body right now.
“I’m afraid I’m going to keep you here until you run dry”, he then added a sly grin showing up for just a second.
"Some watchmen heard shots. What happened?"
I felt my heart skip a beat and the vampire in front of me seemed to notice, too.
“Probably just a cover”, Sherlock said, “To lure unsuspecting people in.”
"So, shall the game begin?", Sherlock said and got me out of my coat and then opened the buttons on my shirt, "We don't want this to get soiled, do we?"
“Take a look at yourself, my dear. You obviously cannot.”
"Maybe it's a code", Anderson said, "Some type of ancient vampiric language."
"Jeanette, what do you think of me?", he said softly and put a strand of hair behind my ear.
"You know the department I work at", I tried to tell the story from the beginning.
There was this thick air between us and it stayed until Lestrade shifted in his seat and cleared his throat. "Could you find anything useful about this symbol?"
"John, I don't know what you're thinking", Lestrade said while looking outside the cab window, "But I think we have our first suspect."
"What's in the bag?", I asked as she put it down onto my kitchen table.
“You’re sick!”, I spit out, “The DSO is going to find and kill you for doing this to me!”
"Don't be so mean, John", Lestrade said, "But we can as well check the Barts for more information."
Lestrade has gotten anxious. "There was a strange case about fifty years ago", he said. "Of course I wasn't there to witness it but I've heard and read about it. It must be one of Scotland Yard's most curious cases!"
“Maybe it has to do with Blair Wakefield?”, I remembered his face. He was like a second father to me, but I didn’t know if he would’ve been able to put a magic barrier into my mind.
"No that's not it!", I said, "I'm just not an interesting person. There's not much to tell about myself!"
"Ah, yes...surely..."
From outside the door, I heard Lestrade's loud arguing. "What happened?", he shouted, "And who the hell are you two?!"
"No it's not!", I said angrily, "This man is disgusting me! I think he's doing that on purpose!"
"John, I just...", he stopped once he saw the woman and lifted his hat, "Madam. Are you alright?"
"You know damn well what happened", I hissed.
"But how do you want to help people if you cannot even help yourself?"
“You shouldn’t stress your body too much”, Sherlock said, “You have lost a lot of blood.”
My vision was still a little blurry and my eyes had trouble focusing, but I could tell that his expression didn’t reveal much emotion.
I turned around as quickly as I could and left the alley to not puke on the spot. Baynes came running right after with my gun in his hand and we left again for Scotland Yard.
I blushed and wished, I had my fan to cover it up. Sherlock ran his other hand carefully through my hair and then looked directly into my eyes. I felt my body growing numb and I stareted to panic even more.
I shuddered once I felt his lips on my neck again. This time I was ready for the pain, but it didn’t come. It was just another chuckle from Sherlock.
"It does, actually. Do you think we should give it a look?"
"Oh God, what happened to you?", Molly asked as she guided me outside.
Then he caressed my cheek and cupped it in his hand. The feeling of his cold skin through his thin glove against my burning cheek made me shudder. Then his hand wandered down my neck onto my collarbone and rested there for a moment.
Daniel took his hat from the counter and smiled at me. “Just like Emma said. We’re just hunters. Stay save, Dr. Watson, so we’ll hopefully never met again.”
"Detective Inspector Lestrade speaking", I herad his voice.
"You need to stay calm", I adviced her, "You need to breathe carefully. Do you understand? Respriation!"
"I hate you", I whispered so quietly, not even I was sure if I really said it.
"Good evening, Milady", Sherlock Holmes said with a smile.
"My name is Daniel Goodwin", I heard the man's voice. "This is Emma Goodwin, my daughter. We saved this woman from a vampires' nest."
“Yes, of course”, I answered.
As I felt his weight shift onto my bed, I pressed my back into the wall beside me. “Please, don’t…”, I whimpered suddenly feeling more vulnerable than ever.
Then, I finally unwrapped the thing inside and once I held it in my own hands I was even more staggered.
"John? Are you really alright?", Lestrade asked. I finally was released from my forced holiday and was walking down the hallway as he noticed me.
"She said she's been approached by him on a festivity. We may start investigating there."
"Are you in company?"
Lestrade looked at me in shock. "Why?"
"God, Molly, you know me. I'm not that sensitive!
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. There is more to you than just your blood.”
He then suddenly grabbed my neck and pushed me up against the wall. His lips again ran across my neck, as to find the best spot to bite into. He was rougher than last time and I felt tears rise in my eyes.
"Oh God", Bayned, who had also shot, said once he saw whom we have just killed.
“I leave you alone for a couple of minutes and you tried to break my spell?”, Sherlock shouted at me. His towering figure in the doorframe. “Seems like I haven’t broken your spirit well enough.”
“I … I’m not sure”, I said, trying not to let the events replay in my head again, “I don’t think it’s because of that…”
I sighed again. "I don't either."
The woman didn't answer but let out a soft moan. At first, I thought that she might me a prostitute but after looking at her clothing, I knew that they must've been quite expensive.
"Hm, yes. They found a hat."
"It's alright!", I intererupted him, "Please don't worry. I'll call for you if I get into trouble."
"John, I really should let you-"
"You're awake!", I heard a voice say, a voice which I didn't recognise, "Good. Good. Then we'll start rigth away."
"But who would've solved the case then?", I grumbled.
I also found a cup and filled it with a bit of the water. I needed a candle for the spell, but I hoped that this still would be enough to undo the spell. I kneeled in front of the door and put the cup down and let the ashes fall into it.
"You are at the infirmary at Scotland Yard", I explained, "You're safe. No worries."
"Exactly. As I said, we need everyone right now."
“No!”, I screamed as he again lowered his head, “Don’t you dare!”
"Thank god!", she said, lifting up her dress to better run, "Young man, can you help me?"
"You could call it a special gift", Sherlock said and got up, "Now for your part of the deal."
"Why do you keep this job?", the revenant asked, "Think of a reason why you work at Scotland Yard."
"You like it?", Lestrade asked with a little smirk on his face and I couldn't contain my happiness.
Lestrade had his arms crossed in front of his chest and looked at me gloomily. "John. I'm not sure if you're aware how this whole situation makes me look."
"Hopkins", I greeted him and lifted my hat a bit.
"Don't exhaust yourself", the person laughed, "You'll make it harder on everyone otherwise."
Standing around the corpse were some poilicemen and I carefully made my way through to take a look at the victim slash culprit. On the ground layed a tall young man. His light grey eyes were fixed on the heavens and opend wide as in shock. His mouth opend as he wanted to scream.
The procedure was repeated five times in total. And everytime, I felt my mind slowly slipping away. My eyelids grew heavier and heavier and I became more and more aware that I couldn't escape anymore. The first two times I cried, screamed, kicked and tried to free myself but then I lost my strength until i just let them do whatever to me.
Everything inside me felt like it was twisting, and I gasped for air.
"A ... a vampire", I said.
"No bite wound?", Dr. Hooper asked.
Lestrade gave me an serious look. "John, this case was about fiftly years ago. Why would anyone talk about it? Unless... Unless you're not telling me the truth."
"Jeanette", I answered not looking at him.
I carefully tugged at her collar which was decorated with lace and frills, as I noticed that it was slightly covered in blood.
"Yes, can you understand me?", I asked.
In frustration, I let my head rest against the door behind me. The thought that Sherlock intended to turn me into his servant was still lingering in my brain. I closed my eyes and tried to recollect what I had learned about the vampire-servant relationship in the DSO training.
"This shouldn't stop our fun though", he said mischiviously, but I could still see the shock in his eyes.
"May I come in?", she asked an pushed her way up the stairs.
"I said...!"
"That's a job for the DSO and not some random private persons!", the Inspector protested.
"A woman knocked at my door and fell unconcious!"
"You'll be getting home safely?", he asked concerned.
“A vampire, that smokes?”, I chuckled to myself.
"You little...!", Sherlock hissed and stood that quickly in front of me that I hadn't had a chance to evade. He grabbed me by the neck, lifted me up my feet and pushed me against the wall behind me.
“Surely it isn’t
The temperature around the departure gates had dropped a significant amount since Sherlock arrived an hour before boarding was scheduled to begin. The seats were uncomfortable from the beginning and the crappy knock off coffee shop Sherlock had stopped at had over roasted the beans. Refusing to let on that the cold was beginning to bother him Sherlock slouched further in his seat, chilling coffee balanced on the seat beside him, and stared at the screen of his phone.
“I wouldn’t say you have
“I’m often convinced you are the devil himself in disguise. The only evidence against this conclusion is your utter incompetence and stupidity.” Sherlock turned on his heel and stomped back to the lift without another word.
Sherlock’s long fingers stroked over the strings pressing, releasing, drawing a steady bow quickly and then haltingly along the instrument. Body swaying slightly with the rhythm and eyes squeezed shut he played from memory, adding notes in places that felt lacking. London’s shadows slanted across his body leaving slanted lines where the blinds had been opened and chasing raindrops like sweat down from Sherlock’s hair into his unbuttoned white shirt, down his torso, the front of his black slacks, and to his bare feet. Sherlock startled as Marlowe hit the floor with a hiss and paused just in time to hear knocking at his door.
"You owe me something, John Watson", and with those words he was gone.
I felt a sharp pain rushing through my body and pressed my teeth together, so not cry out in pain.
Baynes nodded silently and our ways parted. I went straightforward for a while, until I saw shadows moving in an ally. I carefully snuck around a corner and silently got my Lancaster ready. The person I noticed was standing above another, slurpling noises coming from him.
“What is it?”, he asked, true curiosity in his eyes. “I tried to read it in your blood, but there seems to be some kind of spell protecting you.”
"Here we are", he then said relieved, after we stopped after a while. Before we entered the house, I saw something moving in the corner of my eye and turned around. I saw a kind of spectre moving behind a wall but didn't see anythign too suspicious.
"And I apperciate how dedicated and talented you are", Lestrade contunied.
"Nothing's happened", I assured, "But Mister Inspector insisted I visited a doctor."
"Do you speak English?", I asked her helplessly; I couldn't help her like this.
The person came closer and rattled beside me. I couldn't see what it was nor could I tell by the sound.
“Nothing really”, Sherlock answered defensively, “Just a hunch.”
"You are to my liking", Sherlock said, "I'l have fun with you later."
“Excuse me?”, I felt my voice a few octaves in shock.
“Is this what it’s about? Is this all a game for you?”
"Damn it!", Lestrade grumbled and hit the table with his fist. "I cannot tell you anthing else than 'Keep looking', can I?"
Lestrade took a deep breath before answering. "There was another murder. We found a dead body near Jefferson Street; Jason Brending his name. We thought it was the same murderer who killed Betty Walter but..."
I then heard Daniel break the silence with a cough. “Well, we would like to escort Dr. Watson home, if that would be alright.”
"Good Evening", I greeted them with a friendly nod.
"But why two weeks of forced holiday?"
After I told Lestrade everything Sherlock told me, I sat down again on the chair. Thinking about this night, I touched my neck where the bite wound would've been. Frustrated with Sherlock, I got up and took my coat with me. The night was still young and I didn't want to waste any more thoughts on Sherlock Holmes. While wanderings the streets, I came across a young woman, who seemed lost. She was wearing a bright red dress and once she noticed me, she came running towards me.
The person seemed to turn my way, but I couldn't see their face in the shadows. Then with a jerk faster than I could notice the person fled. I instantly ran after them and tried to keep my hat on my head. The thug was very fast and I had problems keeping up with them. I drew my weapon. I wouldn't be able to hit anything while running but there still was a chance that the criminal would be startled by the sound and stop. We entered a wider street and I pulled the trigger. The recoil made me take a few steps back but I saw that I hit them. The person stopped and put his hand on his upper arm. But they kept runnign away so that I lost sight. After I made sure that the thug was totally gone, I decided to go back to the attacked woman hurrily. I knelt in front of her.
“Jeanette Holly Watson, care to explain where you have been and gotten all these injuries?”, Molly asked sternly, hands on her hips.
Sherlock lifted his eyes, his expression severely hurt, pupils dilated wide and breath sounding heavy.
"I doubt it", I said quitely.
“I need to tell this Lestrade!”, I said again, trying to get up.
"No!", he shouted, "I want you to keep out of my sight!"
"Excuse me?", Lestrade exclaimed and positioned himself next to me, "John, would you care to explain what exactly happened?"
“You’re not leaving this place!”, Sherlock hissed at me, “Not until I can drink anything else than your blood!”
"I don't think so, John", Lestrade looked at me scepticly, "That's Anderson's field of knowledge and this isn't his case.
Closing in to the corner of a house, I heard something and was ready to draw my gun. Carefully, I approached the corned from where the sound came from and went around it. In shock, I let out a gasp.
"Lestrade these peoplesaved me!", I protested, "Please just look at me!"
Molly shurgged. "I wanted to ask you if you'd like to come with me. Of course in a manner that Lestrade won't notice us."
I placed the bar of soap inside the cup and continued: “Make this spell cleaner as I wash this spell off from you.”
"Fantastic", Lestrade whispered on our way to the crime scene and ran his fingers through his hair. "Another body and we haven't solved the other three cases."
I sat down on the chair opposite to her. "Do you remember anyting specific?"
He leaned down lightly to me and whispered: “You’re in no condition to walk the streets at night at the moment. Plus, I’m not going to let you leave this easily.”
"I want you to tell me everything you know", I said as quietly as possible, "and then we'll talk about the payment."
"I'm not the one you're looking for", he hissed as we heared boots running down the street.
I took a confused look at Sherlock, unable to tell what he was trying to tell me.
Molly gasped for air in surprise and searched for bite marks on my body. "But you've got no..."
"How do you know all this?", I asked. We were trying to solve this case for days and this man just solved it in 5 minutes.
"Hello? Are you consious?", I stared talking to her softly. I didn't want to startle her afterall.
I would be lying if I said that I didn't think about that Sherlock Holmes after we met. This curious fella triggered a strange feeling inside me that I later identified as pure fear. Nervously I bobbed a pen up and down between my fingers while starring at the piece of paper in front of me.
The man let go of his victim while laughing and lifted his hands. The woman sank to the ground without any streanth left to stand.
"Are you alright otherwise?"
"No! No, forget it!", I shouted, "Never!"
"How marvellous! I am searching for someone to chin-wag. This festivity is getting awfully dull!"
I trot next to Baynes while pondering.
"John, what happened?", he asked with widened eyes.
"A little present", he said with a soft smile, "To keep you safe."
Lestrade tugged his collar into place. "John, I think you should take a look at it yourself."
"Anderson insisted on switching", reaffirmed Lestrade, "Everything is at sixes and sevens right now and we need everyone, John."
"So there is a secret!"
“Now, would it be fun to let you go, or should I just keep you here with me?”, he said through the fingers placed thoughtfully over his chin, the grin eerie and fangs still covered in blood. He grabbed me by my hair and pulled me onto my feet; knees still wobbly.
"Please, don't scream!", I plead and made a careful step towards her. The poor woman was obviously scared and was shaking strongly. "Do you know where you are?"
"Don't say that!", Lestrade cried out in surprise, "If you don't want to tell, that's your business!"
"Where should we start to search?", I asked.
The only thing I remember after that, was me waking up in an unfamiliar bedroom.
“But I’m not sure if he’s able to perform such a complex exorcism”, I said, “Putting such a spell on someone requires lots of magical talent and-“
"Please try to stay conscious", he said to me, "As soon as we get out of here we will bring you to a doctor."
I carefully ried to get her on her feet but she was so weak that I decided to carry her to Scotland Yard.
Sherlock came closer and leaned down to me. "Let me tell you a secret, John", Sherlock said with a low, husky voice, "I'm certainly not the only vampire who found a liking to your blood. Blood of this kind of quality doesn't stay unknown for long, escpecially if that person is always running around at night."
“And why is that?”, I asked while trying to free my arm from his clutch.
“You’re awake”, Sherlock said coldly, approaching me but keeping his distance.
In my hands was a beautiful Lancaster, definitly custom-made. The butt was decorated with various carvings and worked smoothly. I weighed it in my hand. It was really comfortable to hold it.
“No other blood will quench my thirst anymore!”, his pressed through his teeth, “I should’ve drained you dry back then!”
I secretly hoped that I wouldn't find Hopkins lying there, but this was absurd. If Hopkins was really dead there would be much more panic at Scotland Yard. It was still not really dark outside, so not every poiliceman was carrying a lantern, as you could still discern enough without extra light.
"Care for a little hunt?"
"That's...that's a joke, isn't it?", he stuttered horrified and looked at me with a crooked smile.
I tried to pass Sherlock to the door, I could see from the sofa, but he grabbed my arm tightly.
“Oh, I will of course leave the choice to you”, Sherlock laughed.
I haven’t noticed Sherlock coming towards me, but I only realized it once he grabbed my wrist.
“That man is not a man of the church”, Sherlock spit out the words, “He might have implanted false memories into your brain. The original Blair Wakefield is long gone.”
sounds more thrilling than it acutally is. You just basicly partol a certain area and make sure that nothing bad happens. London may be big but it's highly unlikely that something will happen in your distict. A real "hunt" only occurs if you notice something odd. I put my pistol into my waistband because I hadn't has a holster yet and I checked if it was still there. As I went around the corner, I saw two watchmen crossing my way. One of the two had a little lantern to guide their path. I was surprised to see them, watchmen were getting rare.
I would've jumped if I could and inhaled my breath sharply, as I felt his fangs piercing my skin. I grabbed him by his shirt and clung onto the fabric tightly but as the sharp pain faded away, I loosend my grip.
Lestrade snorted. "How would you get this wierd name wrong? That's highly unlikely!"
I cleared my throat because I didn't know how to start. "I was on a patrol", I started and only continued once Molly nodded, "And I was unfortunately attacked by a vampire."
I took a look at the piece of paper. "Well yes, I actually do know where this is! I coul escort you, if you'd like."
"No, John", he confirmed.
I asked myself pretty surprised.
"I ... I do."
Watson. What brings you here tonight?"
“Make a step towards me and I will shoot you!”, I warned him, finger on the trigger of my gun now.
Was he using his vampire powers on me to dominate me?
Sighing, I took a seat near the dance floor and observed the people. After a while I found Lestrade wandering around and this made me keeping up my guard even more. This worsend once I saw another familliar face. As he approached me, I tapped my own fan on my right ear.
"Who was
"We will get you out of this place", the man explained as he caefully lead me to the door. The light, though dull, blinded my from my time in darkness and I had to squint for a long while.
"A festivity?", I cried out surprised, "But that was my idea!"
“We’re not done here!”, Lestrade snapped at him.
"You never come without news!", I laughed and also took a seat.
With worry in my gut, I decided to go to bed. Sleep was rough, though and I woke up startled and paralyzed in the middle of the night, a shadowy figure looming above me.
We said our goodbyes and kept walking our ways. I myself didn't have a lantern, even if it would've been nice to have one for seeing into the dark alleyways. On the other hand, it would highly obstruct me when in a possble chase, that's why I was pretty content with how things were now. Also, my eyes have already adjusted to working in the darkness. Out of sheer curiosity I glanced into one of the alleyways I was passing and saw two figures. At first, I wasn't planning on doing something, they should be allowed to do what they'd like and the watchmen didn't do anything either, but then I herad a woman's wimper.
Baynes shook his head. "I just wondered. Forget it."
"No, we're fine", I replied, "You should probably go to bed. It's still in the middle of the night."
"Y-yes...", I lied.
I agreed and went inside. Everything was decorated ecssesively and I definetly wasn't dressed appropriately fr this event. I followed the woman into the crowd fro a while, but then was grabbed and pulled out. I wanted to shout at the person and free myself, but after I saw his face, my heart stopped.
"Hands up!", I shouted.
"I probably will tell you things you already know, Dr. Watson", he said after we both sat down at my table, I of course within safety distance.
"You're a revenant", I declared and tried to keep a safe distance.
"Erm...I...no. I'm not", I stuttered in an attempt to find a reasonable excuse.
“A spell?”, I asked, cold sweat running town my back.
"I could ask you the same, John", Sherlock hissed back, "How did you find this place?"
"I feel like I'm about to vomit, I cannot walk straight without help and my head hurts, but yes, I'm alright", I muttered.
"John", the revenant said with an soft voice, "You'll encounted a lot of things in your job that other people would find disturbing. That you're afraid is a completly normal reaction to what is happening to you. You're strong, but even you have limits and they seem to be crossed. You need to decide for yourself what is best for you now."
“With these ashes I take you back and all that came besides.”
Sherlock then cupped my chin and foreced me to look into his pale eyes. "John Watson, don't you think it would be far better if both of us enjoyed this?"
“We don’t think the vampires from the nest will come back for you, as we’ve taken well enough care of them. But we still would advise you to stay home for a couple of days.”
"Yes. A woman came here last night and told me that she heard strange noises in her house and that there was no source for them. That's why she consulted us."
“It’s your fault, that I can’t drink any other blood anymore!”, he screamed at me.
I tugged a little bit at my dress and followed Molly a bit through the ball room.
I looked to the floor, ashamed, and evaded Sherlock's gaze.  He took of his glove and ran his fingernail across the fabric to cut if off. The fabric fell to the ground and exposed my chest. Sherlock had to take a step back and if he weren't already pale as snow, all colour would've faded from his face.
Sherlock grinned, no sign of his usual mischievousness lingering in his eyes. “It’s only fair if you need me as much as I do you, don’t you think?”
Frustrated, I leaned back in my chair.
After a while of thinking, I started talking again. "Lestrade, I thought about Betty Walter."
A loud bang echoed through the night and startled myself. Both Sherlock and I looked at each other in surprise. I still clutched the pistol tightly in my hands while Sherlock pressed his hand onto his shoulder. My bullet apparently brushed him.
“I wish, it wouldn’t have come to this”, I said under my breath and too tried to not make any eye contact with him.
"John!", Lestrade raised his voice but then lowered it again, "Please. I can understand that you really care for this case, but the dead can wait for a while. Let's focus on tonights case, alright?"
"Say, John Watson. What part of me isn't human? I certainly look like a human. I speak like a human. I
I sighed. I did that a lot lately. If I was lucky, maybe I got to speak with Hooper... The cab suddely halted and I followed Lestrade into the hospital without further ado. And luckily, I got to speak with Dr. Hooper. I sat down on the treatment couch and the doctor in front of me on a chair.
"Do you spy after me?", I asked skepticly.
“Dr. Watson, may I talk to you for a bit?”, he asked, as I took a deep sip of a cup of tea.
"Were you able to notice anything of importance?", Lestarde asked as he got up from his chair.
The man turned around and, indeed, it was him. A mischievious smile was on his face, blood stuck to his lips.
“Maybe what?”, Sherlock asked impatiently.
"Your last visit was quite a while ago", Wakefield said, "Something must have happened, am I right?"
“Oh, am I?”, Sherlock growled into my ear. “You know what happens when a vampire drinks more than once from a single victim in a short period of time, right?”
"Lestrade", I whispered, "You don't mean-?"
Hi, sorry that it has been so long since updating! I guess life and uni just get in the way!
"You're afraid of me because you're weaker than me. Like meek prey."
"Why? Who's that?", I asked and put the pencil down.
"Well, I'm going to call off a manhunt, maybe some of the watchmen will catch the guy", Lestrade said before finally leaving the room.
"And else? A fine young man like you sure is engaged", Lestrade then said quietly.
"Hm? Why?"
I again felt my body freeze in fear. “Is he also a vampire?”
"I don't do this for you, I do it for the well being of London!"
"I really think this is a bad idea", I said as I got out of the cab and pulled my skirts up to not dirty them.
"I gave you a promotion three days ago. And since then, you ran into danger twice. I don't want to look like I gave you the promotion because I like you."
"Pardon me", he said, "I just noticed you. Are you a companion?"
"Don't be like that!", Molly said as we then went inside.
Then, the inspector got up and left the room with a quick stride.
"Of course madame."
I thought he would let go of me, let me drop to the floor for either Anderson or Hopkins, who were both on patrol duty tonight, to find me but he instead lifted me up.
You'll take Marylebourne and I St. Regent's Park. We'll meet again in one hour."
“You kidnapped me.” It wasn’t a question on my part, more like a statement, a realization.
"I...I don't know yet", I said out of breath. I still needed time to properly process what happened.
"Please sit down", he said and looked down upon me.
After some investigations, Lestrade sighed at me. "The same symbols on this man's underarm."
"Heard the name on the streets", I lied without looking at him.
Baynes stared at me with big eyes: "What poltergeist? I was at my office the whole night!"
I gulped. I didn’t feel anything different towards Sherlock, so that must mean that there is yet no contract between us, which was good. I needed to get to Lestrade as fast as possible to lead the others of the DSO onto Sherlock’s trail, no matter if he was connected to the murders or not. I couldn’t risk another bite from Sherlock and in my current state I wasn’t even able to defend myself from him.
I nodded back and undid a few buttons on my shirt. She then carefully touched the red marks with her fingers.
"Answer me!", I demanded and tried to move again.
After the door closed, I took at deep breath. All the adrenaline in my blood started getting out of my system, I started noticing just how exausted I really was. Deep in thought, I looked at the woman, who seemed to have fallen asleep. She was breathing quietly but steadily. Was I lucky and prevented another murder? I shook my head to get the thought out of my head. No this was different from Betty Walter's case. Those cases weren't connected. After that, I stared to patch up the lady laying on the bed to treat the bite. It honestly looked worse than it actually was and to finish of, I dripped a little bit of tincture on the wound and finished my work with a plaster. As I was putting everything back to it's original place, I heard the woman quitely moaning and then the sound of rustling fabric. I turned around as saw her staring at me in shock. As she inhaled her breath to scream, I tried to interrupt her.
As I left the chruch, I put the necklace around my neck, hiding the charm underneath my shirt. And I asked myself on the way home, why I didn't own such a thing before.
"That woman is your dear Dr. Watson", Daniel said, "Are you
"Oh? You don't?", he said softly with a smile, "You will, my love."
Sherlock lowered his head and bit into my wrist which causes me to scream loudly in pain, but he didn’t drink my blood. Instead, he bit into his lower lip with one of his fangs.
After a while I found myself laying on one of the beds in her examination room.
"Why are the pretty ones always so noisy?", he asked himself and wiped the little blood off his lips and his face came closer and closer to my own.
But all the calmness came to an end the very next night.
I tried to free myself from his grasp, but suddenly the curtains of our little private room were pulled open and a few women and men entered quickly. I screamed and felt something hit the back of my head. I wanted to turn around to see my attacker, but then something hit me again, I fell to the ground after losing my balance completely. I saw shoes running around and a final, third blow brought me to complete unconciousness.
“I very well think we are”, Daniel responded, all kindness gone from his voice and gaze. “I would advise that it would be best if Dr. Watson would not strain her body too much after being drained by vampires.”
"The woman in the red dress lead me here", I explained as I saw her in the crowd.
He lifted the dead man's arm and rolled up the right sleeve. A strange symbol was carved into his underarm. From another pocket I took a pen and a notebook and copied the symbol.
"Nope. No bite."
“You haven’t been donating blood lately, have you?”, he chuckled.
The word
"Yes", Lara sighed, "I think I can do that."
Sherlock got up and straightened the fabric of his coat. "Then I will leave this case to you, John Watson."
"And you want to talk with someone."
Although I insisted that I was alright, Lestrade still demanded that I visited an hospital. Together, we sat in a cab; Lestrade opposite to me. With a shaking hand, I tried to fix my shirt collar. I secretly hoped that I wouldn't meet Sherlock Holmes again in the near future but another part of me would like to put another bullet in him, preferably between his eyes.
"What...", she croaked and then cleared her throat, "What happened?"
His face was so close, I could count every one of his dark eyelashes. Sherlock's face moved out of my vision and became a bunch of dark curls. I twitched, once I felt his cold lips on my neck and waited for the sharp pain when his fangs brake trough my skin. But there was no pain. Sherlock stood up and looked at me with this disgustingly mischievious smile of his.
"We don't know. He just vanished after you got captured, we think", the woman now explained, "Who is he?"
I tried to shake my head carefully.
I felt bad for Hopkins. He was a sentimental person and rarely handled cases outside his office.
"Yes, I'm with a friend", I said and looked up.
I clenched my teeth. "You're a bloody monster!", I hissed at him, "You're not human!"
I felt myself blush and Sherlock looked me in the eyes.
Sherlock lifted his hands as a defense. "You might have forgotten that I'm not human. I have my ways of getting information."
"Give me one reason why I shouldn't shoot you here and now", I hissed at him and he got up from his seat.
Alarmed, I stopped. I closed the door behind me as we entered. Lestrade leaned against his desk while I kept my place at the door.
“You are surely aware of this, but I will elaborate it for you: Once a vampire has tasted your blood, it will be easy for him to follow your scent if you wander around the city. You’re save enough in your home but be careful to whom you open your door.”
“Why should someone target me anyway? There is nothing special about me.”
"One hour. Alright", I said and went on my way.
But Daniel’s words have left a bad taste in my mouth. Sherlock wouldn’t be able to follow my scent through the city, but he knew where I lived and there was nothing I could do to keep him away. Plus, there was the whole situation with Lestrade. Now that he was aware of my true identity, I surely was going to be dismissed from my job.
"We're on our way", Lestrade said without an goodbye and hung up.
I waited a couple of seconds and touched the door knob. No electric shock.
“Now that your body is changing, you are dependent on me.”
"Well, it seems that Lara Owen's case is closed then?" I tried to sound nonchalant about this but in reality I wanted to pull my hair out because I now got those stupid event dates for exactly this cause.
After a while, the pain in my arms stopped and the person left the room without saying anything else.
I considered to not tell her about it and took some deep breaths of fresh air.
"Holmes ... What about Holmes?", I whipered.
Together with Lestrade, we sat in his office.
Our ways parted and I, again, got the feeling that someone was watching me. I tugged my coat nervously around me and started walking a little quicker. I only started to panic, as I noticed something moving around the corner of my eye but when I turned around, nothing was there. I kept speeding up my pace until I was running back to Scotland Yard. Gasping for air, I entered the building. Since when was I scared by darkness?
"Well
"Holmes, you damn...", I hissed while still trying to free myself.
"I'm...I'm going to get a doctor...", he said and ran his hand through his hair.
"You always worked hard, John."
Then suddelny I heard a loud voice shouting and I noticed that it was myself. I had apparently not fully regained my senses but held on to reality tight enough to cry for help. My effort were then silenced by Sherlock who covered my mouth with his hand and finally let go of me. He held me because I lost the ability to stand upright as I still couldn't feel my feet properly.
I took a few steps back and bumped into the wooden door behind me.
"Try a little bit of resting", Wakefield suggested, "You'll know what you need after that for sure."
“I’d rather die than be dependent on you!”, I hissed through clenched teeth.
"Yeah", I lied, "Probably just caught the flu."
"You don't need to say anyting. Just tell me if you want it or not."
"A hat!", I exclaimed surprised, "What about an Locating-spell?"
"If you say so, John."
"Well", I said and rubbed my neck, "Lestrade said that Hopkins called last night but I haven't heard from him personally. Why do you ask?"
“A protective spell? Seriously?!”, I screamed helplessly and slid to the floor without any strength left.
"You look pale, John", Sherlock noticed with a smile, "Did something happen?"
"Let's hope it won't stay like this", Lestrade grumbled.
"Good evening", I said back. Hasn't he recognised me?
"Yes. A very nice man. Tall and dark haired", she explained.
“Yes, and do you know what happens if I’m dead? A servant will starve without his master’s blood!”
"Is that so?", I asked, eyes open wide, "Then it must be destiny, that you found me of all people!"
"Where are we?", I asked my voice tired and slurring.
Gotcha!
The man who approached me looked a lot like the dead man we found tonight. He had the same tall slender figure, the same pale, translucent skin and the same light eyes. The differences were his dark brown locks which fell lightly onto his neck and his dark blue coat. But I noticed that afterwards since I wasn't able to put anything into words at exact this moment.
"An..lish?", she croaked.
“Am I right?”, he said over his shoulder, grinning.
Both starteled and stunned I stared at Lestrade.
"You shouldn't be so loud", he whispered, "Someone might find us." And then decended his lips onto my own.
"Not you probably, but maybe someone else. I still ask you to be careful while he is on the loose."
“Keep quiet”, I heard that person shush me.
"There just isn't anything to tell!", I said a bit too quickly and to harsh. We stared at the floor for a few moments.
"Your first real nightshift and already a vampire hunt. John, I'm not sure if this is bloody luck or awful misfortune."
I sighed. "No, I'm not and you know that Lestrade. I'm still single." I felt how thick the air in this room was getting, so I stood up from my seat. "My shift ends in twenty minutes. If you ecuse me, I'd like to leave now.
"I cannot quite grasp your idea, Mister John Watson", she said, looking at me in a confused manner, "The culprit surely won't attack the same person twice, will he?"
"The culprit is the same in every case so far. Except in Ms Owens case but that guy's dead.", Sherlock explained, "It's a vampire, no doubt. But I might express the thought that he might have accomplices."
"Bring me to Scotland Yard", I said and the next thing I remembered was waking up in one of the infirmary.
She nodded and then stood up. "May I take a look at your neck?"
time for me to search for an partnership. But I wasn't able to finish my chain of thought because someone adressed me from the side. I looked at them in surprise.
"Sher...Sherlock Holmes."
"Lestrade, is this...?", I asked as I saw the person laying on the ground.
"We're currently in a vampires nest", the man explained, "They capture humans and harvest their blood to not go hunting every night."
Sherlock put his hand together and his eyes ran around for a while. "I would say that the culprit comes from the East End but I'm not sure from where exactly. It's most likely a man, between 5'5 and 5'9 in height, regular weight, not older than 40 but no younger than 25."
"I do, John", the Inspector said and reached into one of the drawers in his table. Out he took something wrapped into brown paper.
With that he slammed the door shut. I tired to get up, clothes bloody and dirty and started walking towards anywhere. I had no clue what part of London I was currently in, of course, if I indeed still was in London.
After talking with some of the other policemen, I went to the nearest library to do some research, but to my misfortune I found nothing that seemed to fit the symbol we found. I put a book back into it's shelf and took a look onto my pocket watch. My shift wasn't officially over yet but I didn't want to waste any time in this library, so I snuck out. After talking to Lestrade last night, I finaly realised how isolated I lived. So I thought it would be nice for me to meet some new people. The small festivity I was planning to attend wasn't far from my flat, I noticed and because one didn't need an invitation, there was quite a crowd. I stood at the edge of the dance floor, leaning against the wall behind me and let my gaze roam the people around me. Maybe Lestrade was right. Maybe it
"Looks like geezer squeezed you quite a bit. Nothing too bad but it hurts obviously. It'll be surely gone in a few days", she explained and then took a seat again. "Everything else alright?"
I was more than relieved that Lestrade wasn’t going to dismiss me. But he reassured it more than necessary that it was only because my skills were of much worth to the DSO. After about a week, he put me back into duty and I was on another of my nightly patrols tonight.
"We're just not moving forward", Lestrade said and stared at the dead body in front of us.
"I couldn't understand you my dear, please speak a little louder."
"Why didn't we go straight to the crime scene then?", I asked openly confused, "Wouldn't it be better if we wouldn't waste any time and investigate?"
"I need to stretch my legs", I said and put the paper and pen back into my pocket and checked if my weapon was still safe inside its holster.
The Monster stopped his movement and I heard footsteps followed by another shot. The Monster let go of me, I got up and shot a second time. The monster clutched his chest, black blood oozing out of the wound, and then collapsed on the floor, the glowing in his eyes quickly fading.
With a hammering migraine, I woke up. My eyes had problems adjusting to the darkness at first, plus my throbbing brain wasn't helping at all. After finally being able to see at least schemes of things around me, I tried to move. My body felt wierdly stiff. Moving was a very bad idea, my arms were fixed somewhere above me and every muscle seemed to be strained.
"Would you recohnize him if you saw him again?"
I felt shivers down my spine as I felt his teeth slightly touch my skin.
I froze and held my breath before I spoke. “You said you were unable to drink any other blood”, I managed to remember while the thoughts in my head were racing wildly.
connected to Betty Walter's?"
"hm" was everything that left my mouth before I got caught by another case of severe dizzyness.
"Why yes. A clever one, are we?", Sherlock scoffed at me, "Of course I'm a revenant. I'm surprised you didn't notice earlier!"
“Something is off”, Sherlock mused to himself while he was closing in to my neck.
I gulped carefully, afraid that it might cause him to bite me. “I was drained by vampires”, I managed to say, my words not more that an exhale of breath.
"Yes", I answerd with my voice cracking. I was so thirsty and my throat was dry.
"Is there a legitimate reason why I have to do the night shifts now?", I yawned while walking through Scotland Yard's entrance together with Lestrade. I recieved a telegram about one hour ago and this of course woke me from my slumber.
“Jeanette that’s a disastrous problem, are you aware of that?”, Molly tried not to scream at me. “If Lestrade finds out they will terminate you! In their eyes you’re no better than a vampire now!”
"Information isn't cheap, I'm afraid", Sherlocks grin got wider as his fangs peeked out a little from his lips.
"Dead people aren't humans?", Sherlock said and raised his eyebrows.
"A little present", she said smiling and sat down on one of the chairs. "I've got news."
"Yes."
Although it still was night, it was pleasantly warm outside with a mild wind blowing. But I still tugged my coat tighter.
I, meanwhile, buttoned up my shirt, halfway through, Sherlock grabbed my hand.
"Fantastic", I mumbled as I rolled up my sleeves, "Truly fantastic." I took out a little pencil case out of my coat's pocket and took out a little wooden prick. I used it to take a look into the man's mouth and I saw two sharp fangs. My gaze wandered down and I saw his sliced throat.
The woman then suddenly drew a piece of paper from her cleavage. "I have been invited to somewhere, but I just cannot find that place. Do you know where it is?"
I wanted to answer, to ask something, anything but a wave of dizzyness came over me and I had to use all my strength to not just vomit on the floor.
"The name's Sherlock Holmes!"
Sherlock pulled me closer to himself, my head almost resting on his chest. I felt my heart beating even faster and cursed myself for it because this bastard might and probably will interpret it the wrong way.
"Why? Because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Holmes was a factor we didn't even consider."
I shook my head. "No, sorry. It was too dark."
"You're perfumed, you wear make-up and your hairstyle is different. Maybe it's that?", Molly considered.
Sherlock spun me around, so he almost held me in an embrace.
"Isn't that a case for a doctor?", Lestrade asked scepticly.
With shaking hands, I dropped my weapon. "Oh God", I echoed Baynes.
“Jeanette is that you?”
I wanted to rather vanish into the ground than for her to see me in this condition. She slowed down once she got a better look at me.
"Lestrade...", I whispered and tried to get up, but the room was spinning around me and I didn't want to puke all over the place, so I decided to stay still.
"Not with this", Molly said and pointed to the paper bag.
"Now what?", I asked, panic rising up.
Sherlock leaned on the wall, heading towards me and I took a shot at him. He stopped and for a moment and clutched the wound with a labored groan.
"But this one is different", I completed the sentence.
"I must disappoint you then", I said trying to escape, "I must be going it's late already."
"Please...let me go...", her voice went up and this seemed quite dodgy to me.
"Hopkins, you mean? And how can I be sure that you're not behind this?"
"What kind of event are you going to, if I may ask?", I asked on the way there.
"That means that you're quite lucky that you have encountered me and not someone else", Sherlock said and I felt his breath on my neck, "Someone else would've torn you to shreds already."
