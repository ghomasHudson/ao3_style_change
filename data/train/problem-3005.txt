Castiel waited in the library looking through a book knowing that the brothers would want some time just them. He picked up a book pretending to be interested the only thing he could think about though was Dean. If Dean knew that he loved him in a non brotherly way how would he respond? Cas couldn't help but hope that maybe Dean would feel the same way. Cas sighed Dean liked girls and though he is not technically a boy his vessel is male. Cas picks up another book sighing why did he have to fall in love with Dean, he thought to him self Sam walked in the room pulling Castiel out of his thoughts.
Chapter 2
After Sam left Dean sat down with a bottle of whisky and just stared at the bottle. He thought about how after that night the next day at school Lee cornered him in the gym and begged him to tell him what happened after he left. Dean was still ashamed of what he did after that, he shoved Lee to the ground and called him a faggot. Dean unscrewed the lid on the whisky bottle and took a swig trying to bury and forget the memory once again.
The table was filled with the crinkling of wrappers and sound of pleasant chatter. Sam and Dean and Gabriel talked about how collage was going and the candy shop, and even about Dean's job as a mechanic. Castiel just sat quietly watching it all with what to others wouyld look like a blank look, but in actuality he was observing and getting a feel of Dean's and Sam's personality and relationship.
While laying in bed that night staring at his ceiling waiting for the answer to all his problems to land in his lap Dean's phone goes off. His screen lighting up with the notification that Cas texted him.
“Well it doesn't matter because I don't, so knock it off Sammy” Dean said not looking at Sam and focusing on the road, because he knew if he looked at same he might break and as his dad said ‘only girls and pussy's cry’, Even though he new it wasn't true he wouldn't let himself cry.
Castiel turned to look at Dean, "what is it" he asked tilting his head in away that Dean found adorable, but would never admit to thinking.
Cas grabbed Deans hand and pulled him over to the bed and sat him down pulling off his red over shirt and and pushing Dean so he is lying back before unbuttoning Deans pants. " What are you doing??" Dean questioned startling up from laying.
Cas stepped in "You look terrible." Cas took in the sight in front of him the man that he..... deeply cares about sits on his bed in the same clothes as before, his hair is all over and his clothes crumpled and he had bags under his eyes. It was as if turning him human again had brought the whole world crashing down on him. Cas wanted to hug him but knew Dean would not be open to the idea.
But then Chuck is gone again.
(There are hunters out there, hunting monsters. That’ll never change. But the monsters can hold off. Dean’s damn sure they’ve done enough.)
“That’s okay,” Dean says. “I know, Cas. It’s – it’s okay. We’re good.”
“If you’re wanting to learn more about our bay,” he says, glancing down at their research. “My wife, she’s really an expert.”
Dean looks at Cas. His mouth is parted, slightly, and he hesitates before he speaks.
In Heaven, Dean drives, and Castiel plants bluebonnets.
“I love you,” Cas tells him.
They’re in Austin for two days. It’s not a difficult case. The first day, they load up on silver bullets and track down the skinwalkers. There’s some college student, a band kid or whatever, going around infecting people. (“Why do colors need guarding?” Cas asks, watching her twirl a baton on the football field.) Using her, they get to the pack leader, and it’s over pretty quick. Sam, ever the buzzkill, vetoes the star knife, so Dean gets the girl with his silver pocketknife. (She has dark hair that hangs around a thin face, and Dean remembers how she flipped that stick around at practice. He stabs her through the heart and tells himself that she doesn’t look like Dark Kaia.)
Sam comes for him.
And he sent himself to the ground and he bled and he tried to say
The Empty is not made to hold souls; it is made for Empty. And souls are so
Something’s burning. Dean can taste it, thick in the air.
His fingers wrap around the bottle’s neck, push their fingerprints into the glass, and Dean thinks,
There are flowers that smell like rotting flesh, pulsing like hearts, blooming everywhere. He can’t move without stepping on one. He looks down, and they’re not flowers. They’re faces. They sing
Dean’s next exhale is shattered, scraping his throat on its way out. She must feel the rise and break of it beneath her fingertips.
Dad goes to the bathroom to get fixed up. He sits on the toilet, pouring peroxide into the wound. Dean hovers in the doorway.
“If you say so.”
“To die at the hands of Sam Winchester. Of Dean Winchester: the ultimate killer. It’s kind of glorious.”
Backed up against a wall, the blonde cheerleader let out a scream.
“That it?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says, coming to a stop a couple of feet away.
“Yes,” Dean tells him. He steps closer. “I did, I – I do. And I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, Cas. I should’ve said something sooner. There have been – I’ve had all these chances, I know, but I – I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t believe you were back. Here. Staying. Cas, I need you. You don’t get it. I – I was a mess, when you – when you were gone. I don’t want to do this without you.
“Cowabunga,” Cas says, flatly.
I drive fast.
“Forget about it,” Dean’s already out the door. “It was nothing.”
“I’ll, uh, meet you in the car,” he tells Cas, tossing him the keys. “Just let me grab my stuff.”
“Oh,” Cas says.
She rips his kidney clean out.) While they sleep, Cas wanders off, doing who knows what.
“Okay,” he says. “Okay.”
“So,” he says.
Cas’s free arm comes around Dean’s back, and he presses the heel of his hand against the smooth, unblemished skin there. His fingers clutch at the fabric of Dean's jacket.
Dean’s urgency is gone. He feels numb. He feels like Hell.
It’s been a while since Dean’s seen the ocean. It unfolds against the horizon, dark brown seaweed gathering in the surf. (Dean imagines lying in a box at the bottom of it, awake and churning, for eternity.)
The Empty
She is not John
The Empty laughs.
The family wanders off again.
In rare moments of lucidity – spiking hot, slicing deep into him – he realises, both slowly and suddenly, that the dreams here are different. Different from what he’s imagined dreams being, and different from his own jumbled, stuttering remembrances of his brief humanity. He does not experience the dreams, does not see them like pictures or watch them like fractured films. Instead, they are quiet – but there is no quiet, only lack. Lack of noise, lack of vision, lack of touch. There are no sensations. There is no cold Hell, no burning Heaven. There is Empty.
without inflection. Knows
Claire takes a weighted breath. When she speaks again, her voice is shaking.
Dean catches the scent of him, of sweat and smoke and grass. He wants to bring his hand to the curve of Cas's neck, hold him there, breathing and alive.
Sam has a stiff look about him. Dean doesn’t like it.
He is still dreaming, but it is slowly slipping away from him. With a low groan, he clings tighter to it, curling into himself. He can’t quite remember. It is beginning to get away from him, but he still feels himself inside of it. A happiness. A happiness like he’s never known before. He doesn’t want to give it up.
“We’ll find a way, Dean. We will. We’ll get Rowena, Jack, whoever – we’ll do it.”
“No,” Dean says. “It’s exhausting — the coming back. I was ready.”
“It’s time to slice and dice.”
They don’t speak as Dean gathers the ingredients. The pan scrapes loudly when he pulls it off its hook. Dean winces.
, that it is bright, that it is
Jack is a silent, steady force behind him. Castiel stands.
“Hey,” he says. “I wanted to talk to you.”
“Let me take you to him,” Jack says, softly. “You should be the one to greet him. He’ll want to see you.”
was an eye for an eye.
Their breakfast is a charred, blackened lump. Dean coughs when he leans over it, flipping off the stove, grabbing the handle, and shoving it in the sink. He runs the water, waving off the smoke and shooting a wary glance toward the ceiling’s sprinkler.
“Claire, I – yeah, Claire. He’s gone.”
“Well, then,” Dean says. “Let’s get you settled, I guess.”
And then — then Dean is
He saw Dean’s life, as well.
“It’s okay,” she says. “Again.”
And again. Again. Again.
Dean pauses. “I think she’s doing alright. Hunting and stuff. Her and Kaia are still together. They’ve, uh, dropped ‘round the bunker a few times. We don’t talk much. She, um. She took it pretty hard, when you – ”
Dean is so
When he looks, his phone’s just beside him. He stoops to pick it up, feels the stretch of his sore muscles. It’s dead.
“Yes, sir.”
Cas’s eyes are closed.
These words, they are all he understands.
With angels, it is different. Being creatures of God, servants and soldiers born for obedience, angels are more like waiting chalices. Crafted carefully, beautifully, blessed with divine purpose. But Empty. Waiting to be filled. And Grace is poured into them. God’s own Grace. It is not all that they are, but it makes them what they are. The sentience comes later, and it grows apart from that.
The librarian steps out of the back room. Catches the scene in front of him.
Cas is two feet away.
(Dean, passed out on the floor. Dean, keys in hand, leaving the bunker. Dean, on the beach.
“Okay,” Dean says. “Okay, yeah, okay. What are we looking for?”
Cas returns to folding, picking up a pair of pants identical to the ones he’s currently wearing. “I feel like I should. And – you know I want to be here, Dean. But I think it might be good for me. To get some space.”
Dean’s not leaning against the table anymore. On his back, he stares up at the ceiling. He couldn’t say where the bottle’s gone.
Jack steps away, and Dean lets him go. Makes him promise to stay in touch.
This was before there was the Word; still, all this was said and known and done.
“Castiel,” Jack says, appearing behind him. He rests a hand on his shoulder, then pulls it away again, stepping back.
Castiel sleeps. And then, shifting within the Empty, he begins to stir.
(Dean’s in the garage, under the Impala’s hood. He’s really just checking up on her. Looking for something to do with his hands. It’s been two days since Jack saved the world.
Dean takes a pull. It’s all too easy to think about now. It’s all he can think about now. For the first damn time in his life, he has nothing else to distract him.
“I miss you, kid,” Dean says. “We all do.”
“Do – do you feel like that?”
Sam thanks them, promises to have a look into it online. They’ve been at it a few hours, so they decide to head back to the motel.
“Uh,” Dean says. “Yeah. Once, after you were taken. I tried Jack, too, for a while, but – guess he was busy. I just – you
The waitress comes over, smacking her gum. She’s an older woman, with teased-up blonde hair and deep blue eye shadow. She shoots Cas a wink when she sets the check on the table in front of him.
“I’m sorry,” Jack tells him. “I’m so sorry, Castiel. I wish – I wish I could have stopped it.”
“She gets out,” Cas repeats. He steps forward into the librarian’s space, grabs him by the collar, forces him against the wall. “
“Hello?”
Dean snorts. “Haven’t you?”
“Ben,” Jess says, reaching out. But Ben turns, walking into the connecting room and shutting the door behind him.
,” Cas says against his skin.
Jack answered, and he said, “Those answers will be in each of them.”
He doesn’t know what’s going to happen from here on out. He’s light in a way he hasn’t been in years. They could do anything,
“And Billy Bowlegs,” her husband points out.
Jack felt their will wash over him.
Ben’s color comes back, but his voice is thick when he says, “Yeah. Yeah, he was like that.”
When he wakes, there is sunlight spilling through the motel’s windows.
(There is no Roadhouse. No drinks. There is golden warmth, and the low murmur of voices surrounding him.)
this sort of case.
The cups clatter against each other as Dean finishes and places them in the drying rack. He cuts the water, wipes his hands on his jeans. (He doesn’t turn around.)
He was all of three years — but the millenniums whispered to him, in the wind, and thrummed at his core.
Sometimes, they are not.
“That’s bullshit. Jack is the fucking rain, now.
,” Cas says, “will also be a selkie. They’re called to the sea. They both are. That won’t stop. And you and her father, you’ve been lying to her, her whole life. Are you surprised she’s murdering men? But these are
It’s Sammy.
The sun begins to rise.
Dean’s laugh sounds bitter to his own ears.
Dean looks at Cas.
“Jack, I’m sorry,” Dean says. Because this wouldn’t have happened, none of this would have happened, if it weren’t for him.
Castiel is an angel; he doesn’t have much experience with dreams, but he knows this is the kind that will follow after him in the day, weighing down his heels.
They pleaded.
It waits. Considers itself. And it feels a welcome tired. A tired that has been too long in the coming.
Because Dean Winchester is dead.
He’s feeling less generous a couple of hours later.
Cas is here. He’s here. He’s alive.
“Okay,” he says. “Okay.”)
“No,” Castiel says, pulling away. “No. Let Bobby do it.”
with her – we – you gotta believe me, he wouldn’t have just walked off with some woman – ”
“Heya, Cas.”
In the kitchen, Dean grabs the glasses and pours out the whiskey. Swallows one down. (Pours another.)
“You died,” Cas says, fierce. The air hums. “You could have had that. The dog, the house, everything. You could have seen Sam marry Eileen. Met someone. I gave everything for you, Dean, and you died.”
“You sleep?” Dean asks.
He feels words: words pulled from him, taken from him, and thrown back against him.
(Down the hall, Cas is sleeping. Cas is here. Cas is sleeping. Cas has a soul. He’s alive. He’s alive. He’s here.)
, grabbing at him, pulling Cas roughly against his chest. Cas gasps into the fabric of his shirt, raising a hand to Dean’s shoulder. For balance, or to ground himself, or — or because it doesn’t seem like he needs an excuse to do it anymore.
He is sure that he’s tired.
But he’s still looking.
The Empty, the Shadow, had slept nestled inside of itself, swaddled in its own Nothingness, for many eons. As angels and demons alike returned to their essence, to their Emptiness, they were joined in this eternal sleep. This void. For most of these creatures – after such an existence, after holding such sanctity, such blasphemy – this was Good. This was as it should be.
“Gross, dude,” Dean says, guarding his plate as Sam tries to swipe some bacon.
“So, no ghost.”
is a word made of Empty, but it has been Castiel’s constant companion, his intimate friend. It has taught him, and it has led him out.
, Cas. You just left me there.”
Dean stays trained on Alice. “
“What?” Dean asks.
. Hunt. Go fishing. Take a goddamn vacation. It’s them, now. It’s all them.
, but Dean can’t, he can’t, he wants to, but
Dean Winchester. The Righteous Man. The Sword. The Son and the Brother. Unyielding.
“That’s what I’m talking about,” Dean says. “We’ll take two spicy and, uh, a regular, for this one.” He gestures to Sam, who’s loping off to look at the peaches.
And the rain poured down.
– a lucid moment –
, and then it pauses.
“He wants to see you,” Jack says. “He knows you’re here.”
But Dean knows.
Dean feels the cool metal edge of the counter cutting into his back. Cas has one hand on his neck, the other fisted in the back of his shirt. Dean gasps, clutches at Cas’s sides. (Cas is here. Dean is holding him. They’re standing in the kitchen. Cas has a soul. He’s alive. He’s alive. He’s here.)
They sit in the grass, and Castiel listens to the workings of Heaven and of Earth. Jack tells him what can’t be seen; stories shared at the Roadhouse, coarse jokes and full laughter.
Dean Winchester is dead. But he is still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
“Ghosts, man,” Dean says. “Maybe she just got triggered.”
“We hunt monsters,” Dean says. (He feels exhausted, bone deep. Wants a nap. A vacation. Something.) “And the more we do it, the less I’m sure about what that means.”
He walks away.
And the sun shone brighter and the rain poured down.
“Grace and a soul,” Sam says. “You’re a double-whammy.”
The warmth of the Creator’s light bathes the garden in a honey-wheat hue.
Cas lets him speak.
. Like
I guess I’m not the man either of our dads wanted me to be.
He should get up. At least get to his bed. But that makes him think of sitting on a different bed, in one of those run-down motels, with Cas on the one across from him.
Cas is gone; he’s dead, and then he isn’t. He’s back. No warning, no explanation. Just Cas, standing outside the bunker, waiting for him, with a firm
This time, Castiel sleeps. The Empty churns, seething with reluctant insomnia. It prods at him, threads itself into his dreams, taunts that gaping place inside of him, that space absent of soul; still, Castiel sleeps.
Dean can’t pretend to understand anymore. Alice. John. This Will guy – human, but awful.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Why not just give her the pelt thing? People have died.”
He grins. “Heaven, huh?” he asks.
They’re stuck on that front though. A few hours at the motel is enough to tell that Maria’s been cremated, has no family they can find around, and they can’t be sure about what’s keeping her tied here. Dean hates water cases. What’s he supposed to do, drag the bay for answers?
He’s right, probably. They’ll salt-and-burn and be out in a few days.
Castiel has a memory the Empty does not know how to process. It is the worst of them and the best of them; it is human in its contradiction, and the Empty halts, stumped. It recycles old words, instead.
Angels can change, so who knows? Maybe Winchesters can, too.
He sets the glass on the table. The artificial light bounces off of it. It can’t be later than four, but it’s never easy to tell down here. Dean feels like he’s been awake a long time. (Cas looks tired. Wasn’t he sleeping? Isn’t that what the Empty’s for?)
Still, they asked.
They asked.
We’re family.
He had grabbed one of the burners from the trunk, and he pulls it from his pocket now. He dials. It rings once.
He hears,
Dean speaks.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean begins, “can I ask you something?”
Cas is nearby, messing around with the saltshaker. He tilts it, makes a pile on the countertop, traces a finger through it.
The Empty cannot take this. This was the first, the beginning. Castiel was there, he was witness. He stood witness.
But it grows bored. It decides to feed him the memory in ruined pieces.
“This is a good thing,” Sam says.
“He saved me,” Dean tells them. “Billie was coming after us, and Cas summoned the Empty. It took her. And it took him.”
(Dean can’t sleep, that night. He eases out bed, careful not to wake Sam. Their motel’s not on the beach, but if he walks across the road, he can sneak between the condo buildings to get to it. He’s sat near the dunes, five minutes maybe, when Cas joins him.)
I don’t – I need – what happened, Dean?”
“I won’t make any promises.”
, Dean remembers.
They tumble out, and the Empty discards them in turn.
“Cas— ”
Moving slowly, like trucking through water, he makes his way upstairs, past the open, sigil-marked door. The blood is dark now, black like – like
without inflection.
And he isn’t. He gives himself a final moment to cherish the feeling. He exhales. And then, all at once, he
Right.
They are, simply, more.
When they get there, they park at a shallow beach and walk her down to the water. Alice is still. Her eyes are clear. She takes the pelt from Cas without a word, and she waits there, cradling it in her arms, for a long time.
Dean was a pillar; his arms hung heavy at his sides.
Eileen looks delighted. Which makes no sense, at all, because Dean knows Sam gave her the good news a week ago.
“I don’t mean it like that, and you know it,” Cas says. (His shoulders are tensed beneath the fabric of his coat.) “I would appreciate it if you could try to understand, Dean, that this isn’t easy for me.”
He keeps moving.
Dean Winchester is dead, but he presses their foreheads together. They breathe, and it is an unsteady echo between them. Dean raises his other hand to grasp at Castiel’s neck, fingers rough and firm against his skin.
Dean grins.
, they actually did it.
Still, the creation of souls has been safeguarded. It is a higher knowledge. And Castiel has come to question many things, but never this. Never the soul.
“I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that, when people have to be their best, they can be. And that’s what to believe in,” Jack said.
Alice’s hair catches, tangling, in the wind.
“Tell me what it is,” Dean says. “I can find it. You, uh, should probably stay here though. Christ, you’re what, five months along? Stay here.”
Cas had turned to Dean, waited.
“I can’t,” Dean says. “Claire, I can’t.”
The library’s not promising. They go there the next day, pour through old records, and while there’s plenty of drownings, there’s no red flags for the supernatural. Typical college students going a bit too hard, boating accidents, and the like.
Sam takes the seat next to Cas. He’s got sweat trailing down his hairline.
“An adventurer,” Will explains, “who came through back in the eighteenth century. Did a lot of stuff with Native Americans, I think.”
Baby Cas had been there, too. Dean should ask Garth to come around again soon. Kid should meet his namesake.
“No, yeah, of course. Whatever, Dean. It’s not like – it’s not like you were the only one who cared about him. And what about Jack, huh? Kaia is – she’s broken up, Dean. But you go around acting like you’re the only one with fucking issues.”
We do not know what souls are made of. But they are made. They are forged. And they fill those blessed creatures who possess them with more than divine purpose, more than power, more than knowledge.
“She’s pregnant,” Dean remembers. “When did these kills start again, August?”
“I’m fine,” Dean tells him. “Hell, I’m great. Freakin’ fantastic. Sure, the asshole could have given us a heads up, you know,
Mary radiates warmth from the ceiling. It devours her eyes first, blackened and charred.
“Cas?? What the fu-? How? What? Wait what?”
"Dude no, I heard some college kids are gonna be there. They could wreck you for doing the wrong move." Dean threw on his father's handed down brown leather jacket.
"I'll be 18 soon- It doesn't matter."
"That's only for paying supporters," Dean teased. Castiel held his hand up and clasped the hem of Dean's shirt between his middle and pointer fingers.
“Y’know... I heard that alcohol makes one more sensitive...” Castiel took Dean’s dick into his hand, massaging it up and down.
“What are you doing here?”
"We can go to the garage."
Dean waited to hear the front door shut and rushed to his room he undid his belt and, leaning against his door, looked down to see that he was hard. Dean pulled out his dick and started rubbing himself, ‘Fuck he felt so big against me, so muscular, I wanted to touch him... so mm... so badly... And, and-,’ Dean was starting to breathe heavily. He lifted his shirt and bit into it as he slid his own hand over his chest making his back arched; he let out hushed moans. ‘God why does he smell like that, so good, so go- mm so fucking good! And he... he's so... big... so big...’
“Spit it out... No, don’t…” Dean, embarrassed, reached for Castiel’s face that drooled some white. Dean reached his thumb to Castiel’s mouth, prying it open. Watching it spill out, Dean noted he definitely probably swallowed the rest, which made his cheeks burn hot.
"Yeah! We're just friends." I gave him a smile.
“Dad... it was a surprise. I didn’t know...” Castiel lightened the force. “I wanted to go with you... I just... I really did..!” Castiel forced Dean around onto his back, sitting in the same position, knee on his chest, looming over him. They stared at each other, one more glaringly at the other though.
Dean looked through half of the school for Castiel until he found him headed towards the boys’ locker room.
“Ha... yeah...” Castiel moved Dean’s hand away and got up. “Hey uh, Meg and Lucifer are going to have a party at her house next week if you want to come...” Castiel leaned against the bathroom door.
Dean gulped, “I was gonna wait to see if you even came over and if you did, I would’ve taken you to an arcade... I was gonna pay and stuff ‘cause I got my allowance that day from Bobby and, ugh, I was... I wanted to bring you back to my place to... hang out... later...” Castiel exhaled, closing his eyes and slid his knee off Dean to rest on the other side of his body and dropped his other leg to his knee. Surprised, Dean looked down seeing Castiel’s thighs pressing on top of him and he was letting his weight fall onto him remembering that Castiel had his arms pinned down. ‘He’s... on me... like... like...,’ he looked away immediately and tried to calm down. He focused on the furrowed eyebrows that Castiel had on as he thought. With further inspection he saw he had new marks around the base of his neck, some visibly fading though. Castiel opened his eyes and leaned down to Dean’s face, and the grip he had on Dean’s arms loosened. Castiel chuckled Dean laughed nervously. He noted how heavy Castiel was the closer he was now, definitely a pressure on him, but it felt good.
“Dean,” Castiel breathed.
. He’s giddy with it.)
Instead, Dean says, “I know.” He says, “I know that means shit to you. He’s still gone. Trust me, I know. It sucks. Like you’ve lost the only thing that matters. I’m not gonna say it gets better because it doesn’t. But you got to live with it. You have to find a way. You just have to.”
“It makes sense,” Sam says.
“Kaia? Hell if I know.”
When he looks back, Sam’s got a shit-eating grin on his face. Dean flips him off over his shoulder, starting up the staircase. When he reaches the top, he pauses.
And then he pulls tighter. And then he lets go. He steps back.
“Yeah.”
Cas laughs. (Cas is here. Cas is alive.)
(Dean looks at Cas. Cas looks at Dean.)
“Hello, Dean,” he says when Dean gets in.
“Yeah,” Sam’s got that look about him, “yeah, we are. She’s been staying here, mostly, but she’s on a case with Alex in Idaho. Should be back in a few days.”
Dean grabs their cups, his plate, moves to the sink. (Turns his back. Feels the water on his hands, his wrists. Moves the sponge in focused circles over the dishes.)
Dean’s hands are shaky, later, as he cleans the wound on his throat. When he gets back to the motel, he ducks his head and hopes Dad won’t notice. He doesn’t.
(Dean kisses him. Cas leans into it, and it’s good, it’s great, it’s freaking fantastic, it’s
, Castiel feels. It curls into that space inside of him, that place made of Empty, absent of soul.
like icy water, like blaring trumpets and searing knowledge.
(Five months.)
“Do you want one?”
Together, they walk back into the street. Where Jack is waiting for them with all the time in the world.
These dreams, they are all he knows.
, Dean,” Sam says. “You need better coping mechanisms.”
“So,” Dean interrupts, “you’re staying, right?” He finishes off his drink. Sam scoffs. “I mean, this is, you know, permanent? It’s permanent this time?”
(With all that’s happened since, it’s almost too easy to forget how dramatic it was when Cas tried to be God. The Leviathan crawling out. The lake. One of the first times Cas died. Dean is a sick, sick man to feel nostalgic for that.)
“Oh,” Dean says. “Yeah, Claire. She’s – ”
With an odd and absolving mercy, the Shadow carefully unwinds itself from Castiel. It feels blessedly heavy now. It gives a wide stretch, pushing itself to its infinite limits, and then it releases, retiring.
men. With lives. With families. She should have taken you. You’ve trapped her here.”
And the mountains grew and the seas met the sand and the stars filled the sky with stories.
“Bitch.”
Jack said, “Dean, I know your belief. Reach out your hand. Let your will be done.”
It burns, scorches. He’s in Hell.
Dean can’t. He can’t. He has to.
“I won’t be gone long.”
“Well, I’m telling you again. That was one for the history books, man,” he said as David Yaegar approached, one arm raised.
The sun is out, and the sky is blue, like it only is in photographs. He drives a road that weaves through rolling hills.
else make the sacrifices for them.
He watched Dean and he watched Sam.
, Dean prays.
But Castiel knows. Castiel knows now.
Cas levels him with a glare. (There’s a lot they’ve been speaking around, lately, Dean realizes. Has realized. Cas is evidently sick of ignoring it.)
He moves up the stairs, step by steady step, until he’s at the door.
“I know,” Cas says.
“You’ve got a twisted idea of love,” Dean tells him.
Dean doesn’t know what’s going to happen from here on out. That’s nothing new, though, is it? And if there’s one thing he’s ever known, ever believed in, it’s family. It’s Sam. It’s Castiel.
“I can’t find it,” she says, desperate. She’s dressed the same as before, but her green cardigan’s slipped down her shoulders. She has mascara chasing down her face. When she looks at him, her eyes are pleading. “Please.
“I’m not arguing,” Dean tells her. “But what’s the context here?”
This creature comes barrelling through the door, going straight for Sammy, who shrieks and lifts sticky, chocolatey fingers into the air.
He can’t stop looking around him. They really did it. It feels like there are people everywhere. Like the whole world is full again. He keeps looking around.
Dean moves back again. He’s dead. He looks the same. Cas aches.
“Three months,” Castiel repeats, and the lake darkens to a bruise. It doesn’t split, but it pushes downward, a brim-filled net.
A beat. They listen to the gentle white noise of the waves.
Chuck. Chuck and his freaking
“Not that I don’t appreciate having your ugly mug around, but I’m beat. Might nap for a bit.”
“Where were you?”
“I’d like that,” Cas says. Dean flips the pancake. “Dean. Look at me.”
Dean Winchester: Powerful. Dean Winchester: The Blunt Instrument. Dean Winchester:
But they’ve got a long drive back to Lebanon.
Cas looks over. “I meant them,” he says.
The choices all loomed before him, a vast, yawning gulf of hope and fear. The possibilities were daunting. What would happen if Dean defied Castiel and kept that baby that Castiel didn’t want? Would being pregnant fully cement the mating, making it so that there was no way some judge would invalidate it and hand him over to Josie Sands? Or would it make no difference. What if he weren’t pregnant this time? What if all this vomiting was just his OFT coming back in in a new form? Could he stand another long hospital stay? He’d come so damn close to dying before.
“Ohh okay….” Cas muttered with a slight blush highlighting his cheeks before Gabriel and Sam Came back over to the table laughing.
"I tried to kill him, Cas." Dean almost whispered not meeting his eyes, knowing that Cas would see through him and try to comfort him.
“Look dude don't be mad at him he was worried about you,” Charlie pleaded on behalf of Sam, “I mean come on he doesn't want you to end up like your father.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next day they kissed in the bathroom during lunch. Dean knew that his father would be mad if he ever found out but couldn't bring himself to care. On the way home with 12 year-old Sam on his one side and Lee on the other. They planned for Lee to spend the night over the weekend (it was currently Thursday) which wasn't unusual. They stopped at Lee's house and said goodbye. Lee brushed his hand on Deans as he walked by. Dean blushed and walked away pulling Sam with him who was hollering “By Lee!!!!”
They sat there for awhile  just staring at each other neither one moving. “I should go” Dean said  “I’ll see you in the morning at school”
“Ya, so, He’s cool it might be fun just to hangout, guy doesn't seem like he has a lot of friends.”
Of course your not you just don't want your dominance threatened. Cas rolled his eyes at the thought.
Sam not wanting to get his hopes up to much and wanting to be sure unscrews his flask and splashes Dean with holy water. Dean spits some that got in his mouth out and looks at Sam, "Welcome back, Dean"
“What happened last night Dean?” Charlie asked realizing that whatever it was had clearly hurt him.
Crowley turns and walks over to were Cas is lay on the verge of death on the ground, and still wanting to do the right thing tries to weakly push Crowely away.
“Well I didn’t mean to, just Sammy didn’t tell me his friends were coming until after I already agreed to coming so I was upset he tricked me on my day off, and im not used to meeting new people.”
Charlie stood up knowing he was done talking about it. “So let's get you cleaned up, go get in the shower while I fix your living room.”
Dean looked at Cas confused, Why was he standing so close and what is green supposed to represent? Why wont he just tell me? Normally in a situation like this he would be angry at Cas for avoiding his questions, but today he was to tired and to curious to yell or demand an answer.
Thats how Sam found them hours later still wrapped in each others arms Dean sleeping and if he didn't know better it seemed as though Castiel was sleeping too.
A knock at the door pulled him out of his thoughts. He didn't feel like getting up so he began tucking away his pictures and called out "Yeah".
Dean swallowed "I... I saw some of your true form..." he paused he didn't think this through it just came out of his mouth, " I wanted to ask you about it. If thats okay?"
When they got home John, like usual, was passed out with a bottle of whiskey by his head. Sam went to the kitchen and got a snack and Dean went over and roused John just enough to get him to stand. Dean Johns arm around his shoulders and slipped his arm behind his back and half carried his drunk father to his bed room. As Dean was walking out the door he heard John “I'm sorry Dean you deserve better than this.”
“So,” Sam interrupted the glaring session between the brothers, “Castiel what do you do?”
Castiel wondering if the demon even cares quizzes him "You realize, worst come to worst … That means killing him."
Dean nodded and went to his room and grabbed clean clothes and he paused when he got to the bathroom, and looked down at his wrists and the scars that ran up and them. It would be so easy just a few cuts and it would help just take some of the pain away, for a short period of time. He shook his head, he wasn’t going down that road again.
Dean looked down at the floor "Well, thank you for, um… Stepping in when you did." he said still not looking up, I don't want to think of what would have happened of you hadn't shown up when you did angle, he thought to himself. Dean finally looked up to see Cas nodding in understanding. Dean cleared his throat and smiled "What did Sam say? Does he want a divorce?"
“The lady at the counter asked me to give you her phone number.” Sam laughed some more, “Why does this always happen when we go out to eat?”
Dean is 16 and sits in the back seat of the impala outside of his house….
"Sam's asleep," he repeated, "I've got nothing else to do here."
"Oh, he'll graduate next year then. Unless he flunks." I laughed as we reached my house, "Want to come over this weekend? I think my dad will be back after that and stay for a week or two."
"Saturday, but only for Sam." He left. Dean got up with a smile and sped over to lock the door. He turned around slowly, kicked the air, and stared at the bed. He remembered that he was here with someone else for a moment which angered him a bit, but he let it go. He stood with his knees on the bed and let himself fall on his side; he tapped his finger on the mattress being engulfed by the bed. He could smell the sex and both people but Castiel's natural scent stood out considerably more; the smell of dark oak and linen possibly a flower of some kind. Dean felt his face get red. Dean thought about how he just had sex on that bed, ignoring that another person was with him, and how his face must be look like when doing it. He imagined Castiel's eyebrows furrowed together with his eyes shut tight with his mouth agape having moans escape him. His face reddened imagining the range of Castiel's moans, hoping that they dropped deeper than his voice. Dean clenched his jaw, slowly undoing his belt and pants and felt himself. He engulfed himself with the smell and started to move his hand. He felt himself get harder and harder in his hand and his breathing got heavier.
Dean didn't know a whole lot about Meg Masters other than they don't get along and they once had English together in sophomore year; he did know one key thing that intrigued him: she was best friends with Castiel.
"Oh yeah? How would you know?" Dean started scribbling circular doodles in his notebook.
“Yeah, and like their third album...” Dean drifted his eyes across the blurry crowd of kids in front of him, looking at the backs of a small group in the corner. ‘I’m just gonna leave…’
Hours went by as they entertained Sam with all the games he brought from his room, successfully avoiding monopoly, and sitting through a well practiced magic show by Sam where he messed up shuffling the cards twice and lost the toy pigeon in his hat, but otherwise did a few good tricks. Dean made popcorn for that occasion as well as made them a quick lunch of sandwiches before continuing. Castiel stayed the whole day to tuck Sam in, by this point Dean was in his room laying on his bed feet touching the ground slightly.
Dean scratched his head, "Ehh... Yeah but..."
He sat across the hallway looking at the door. He sat there thinking about what he was going do, what he was going to say. His foot tapped rapidly and ruffled his hair occasionally. He sat there 30 minutes when one of the guys headed out the room.
“Yeah... somewhere. That’s why I came over here; you’ve been standing here for like 7 minutes bobbing your head like an idiot.” Dean turned to face the table behind him and filled his cup of soda again, “Heh, you look like a bodyguard for the drinks man calm the frown.”
"Hey yo Cassie, show little ol' me a lil' something more, huh? Long skirts are so prudish." Some kid in the crowd shouted at him and without a second to waste Castiel turned around glaring at the exact kid pointing the open stapler at the bridge of the kid's nose.
“Hey man... time to-... pack it up...” Dean straightened himself up.
"No sir, but you can't really blame them, huh? " Coach Singer chuckled.
Dean took a couple steps forward, hands behind his back, "Who was that with you a minute ago?"
After school that day, Cas walked me home.
"The hell Cas, get out the way." Dean squatted down to get the football.
“Oh, uh no it’s, uh, not weird just, uh, you just caught me off guard!” Dean looked her up and down, ‘She’s pretty, I guess, but...’ Dean looked back around to the guy in the corner. It was Castiel. He was holding onto another guy’s arm, blonde with spiky hair and usual build. ‘Finally, but fucking hell! Really?!’ His eyebrows furrowed.
"Dean could you please-!" Sam reaches out for the volume knob to which Dean smacked his hand away.
“Yeah I know,” she mumbled as she took the shot.
My first game took place a couple of weeks later and I played a few more that semester and each one I'd see Cas in the crowd cheer for me. Just before winter break, I had my first real game with against another school. I was pumped, I wouldn't stop talking about it with Cas who just kept hyping me up. I looked out into the crowd before the game started and saw Cas yelling and cheering, my face got warm for sure. Needless to say but, we won and by a long shot too; my teammates all bumped chests and gave out assorted handshakes. I looked around for Cas and saw him jump the fence and run towards me; I let my helmet fall onto the ground as I picked up his small, light figure and spun the both of us as we laughed and he congratulated me. When I let him down he congratulated me and started rambling about the other team, but something bothered me; in the corner of my eye I saw Lee looking at me, kinda mad looking, and he whispered something to the other guys. I tried to brush it off and follow along Cas's conversation.
"Yep." Castiel smiled nervously, unsure why he admitted that to Dean.
"Aw c'mon, do me a solid why won't ya?" Dean laughed and noticed a stain on Castiel's neck. "Hey you got some'n," Dean made a scratching motion at his own neck.
"Fuck..." His voice shook and his legs started to tense. He moved to all fours starting to move his hips having his face rub up on the bed. His spare hand wandered around the bed and felt something wet. Dean looked over and his face drenched in red as he saw a stain he undoubtedly knew of. He went faster on himself, taking in the smell, the sight, and the thought of Castiel cumming until he came in his hand.
Castiel smiled, cigarette hanging on his lips, "Nice jacket." Your favorite, Dean thought. "I'm assuming you planned this little get together huh? You can turn around now." Dean turned around and Castiel sat too.
"Not technically," Castiel gave Dean a glimpse, it had been a long time since he'd seen Dean so close up and have the chance to take a proper look at him, he noted Deans tight band shirt and casually 'loose' fit pants. "But Dean, I don't think it'd-"
He caught a glimpse of which room they went in. Dean stood at the top of the stairs and his eyebrows furrowed. Dean could feel his heartbeat in his ears. ‘I'm gonna break that fucking door. I'm gonna break the door down. I'm gonna break that fucking door down,’ ran through his head. He walked up to the door and gripped the door handle. Dean breathed heavily, ‘I'll just wait.’
Later that day, I looked up what gay meant and was confused. ‘Just two guys who like each other, doesn't seem gross. I like Cas. Ohhhhh did he think me and Cas...? Like... like-like? I mean... hm. Wait- so does wanting to be with... another boy make it gross?? Would that make me gross? Lee said it so, like, angrily...’
"Yeah yeah yeah, cake or whatever..." Sam slumped back into his seat and covered his ears with his hands.
"He's older, 8th grade."
"How's your dad?" They made eye contact.
"Why do you always do this?" Dean heard shuffling and felt the weight of Castiel's arms on his shoulders and his chest on his back.
“Heh no, just tell her I invited you. Just make sure she hears that first before she curb stomps you.” He laughed.
“Cas...” Dean felt himself heat up again.
"Yeah, Luci's coming but you won't see much of him... if you know what I mean... which is also another reason why you shouldn't go. And Ruby..? No."
“... So is Lucy here?”
"They'll see me. If I leave now!"
A memory from Dean...
“Y’know, you’re such a good listener..!” The girl told him. ‘I’ve been here for a fucking hour or something! Damn. I know, like, no one here...’
He would try to look for him, sneak up to him or make a move towards him, but Castiel would disappear in between blinks. Dean, at this point, knew a lot of his school schedule from trying to find him throughout the day’s, or at least the hallways he’s supposed to go to. Today, after lunch, Castiel went down the English and language hall and stopped to go to the bathroom. That’s new, Dean noted. He would skip his class for a couple minutes for a chance but noticed that Castiel didn’t go to the bathroom at school, and who could blame him they’re filled with germs. He waited a bit, which felt eternal to him and tried to move stealthily in.
Cas snapped his head toward Sam as if not used to being used to being included in conversations. "I work at the library, and volunteer at the animal shelter. ", Castiel answered so quietly you almost had to strain to hear him, and the whole time he spoke he was looking at the table.
The whisky isn't working though in fact its doing the opposite, all he can think about is how blue Cas’s eyes were and how he had perfect lips and sex hair. Dean ground and rolled over on the couch. Why me? Sober Dean would have never done this but, drunk Dean didn't care. Tears finally escape his eyes and eventually he passes out on the couch with one hand still holding the bottle of whisky.
Cas looked at Dean slightly surprised, "Relax Dean I'm not doing anything just getting you in bed." he said softly cupping Deans cheek in one hand. Dean nodded and laying back again. Once he had his close off except his undershirt Cas helped him adjust in bed so he was laying with his head on the pillows.
C: Hey, I know it's late and you're probably asleep already but do you want to get coffee in the morning?
“Hello Charlie.” Dean said but it came out muffled because his face was still pressed into the couch.
Dean chuckled shaking his head "You know, it wouldn’t kill you to lie every now and again." Dean looked up at Cas almost sad not to see the green and blue swirling inside and around him.
Dean read the text message three times, willing his racing heart to slow down. Before answering.
Gabe smiled and said “I own a candy shop, but of course you already knew that.” he smirked being his usual cocky self.
Dean kept walking, wishing his mother was here but she left John and them when Dean was just 4 and Sammy just 6 months old. She ran off and married some rich british guy named Ketch. Then John fell off the wagon and for the most part their Uncle Bobby and Aunt Ellen raised them.
D: 7 sounds great, See you tomorrow.
Dean gulps before opening his mouth, “I’m a mechanic.” he says trying to help Castiel to feel more comfortable.
“I know no ‘chick flick moments” Charlie sighed in a resigned voice, “you know it doesn't make you less of a man to have feelings.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He stood next to Sam and Gabe saying goodbye, while Dean stood studding the paper with the girls number and his own on the back. he watched as dean turned the paper over and looked at his number with surprise and flash of excitement before he tucked the feeling away and turned back to his brother. Dean gave Castiel a smile and a nod before he turned back towards the group to say goodbye too.
He watched the door open and when Cas opened it he swallowed trying to keep the pink he could feel coming of his checks. He didn't want to blush in front of Cas, he was better than that.
Sam looked at Cas "He’s uh …" Sam paused not really sure how he wanted to word his statement, "He’s still a little out of it, but better, I think. I mean, I think this whole thing—the blood cure, and the … " Sam looked away he want to think or admit that his big brother wasn't okay, "all of it—really wrecked him, you know?" Sam looked back and met Castiel's eyes.
"Hows he doing?" Cas responded hoping that sadness didn't leak into his voice.
Dean rolled his eyes pulling back a little, "I'm fine"
Castiel stayed in the corner watching this all happen, he felt like he should say something, but he didnt know what to say. Sam let the silence settle over the room, not only did he not know what to say, but he appreciated the silence it let him think about everything that is happening in there lives right now.
“Fine but if anyone ever finds out it's your ass okay.” Dean sighed working up the nerve to move.
“I know that but you can't bury yourself in a bottle every time things get ruff.” Charlie sat down beside Dean.
Cas turned to leave, "Stay..." Cas stopped and turned to face Dean, "please?" Dean finished his cheeks warm. Cas turned off the light before going to the opposite side of the bed and taking of his trench coat, suit tie and finally his shoes, leaving him in his button up and pants. He nervously gulped before sliding in next to Dean on his side so they are facing each other, he put the covers over him. Before he was even fully adjusted Dean was cuddling up to him. Cas chuckled at this.
Dean glared at him for a few more seconds before rolling his eyes “Your fine Sammy,” Dean sat up a little straighter at hearing Gabe’s voice float through the air. He’d never met his brother and hoped that they were nothing alike.
Cas took a deep breath, he could feel Dean thinking, he reached up and lightly touched his face, this surprised him just as much as it did Dean who was suddenly pulled out of his thoughts. Dean and Cas meet each others eyes, Dean was blushing and clearly confused. Cas was also blushing but he also looked longingly. Dean was froze were he stood and just stared at Cas all he could think was oh.
Dean sighed,“Charlie, Charlie, listen “ he said finally getting her attention, “You can come over, just stop rambling and we are not talking about feelings no…”
Gabe sat down by Sam leaving Cas to sit with Dean. Dean moved over as far as he could to give Cas plenty of room but still Cas sat on the end of the bench, Dean frowned in confusion at that. Did he do something or was Cas just strange? Gabe spoke up, “Cassy here doesn't like being touched by anyone, so don't take it personally.” Dean nodded in understanding and Cas glared at Gabe in a way that made Dean nervous even though he wasn't the person on the receiving end of the glare.
When the weekend came John was out of the house (probably at a bar) they boys ordered pizza with some money they found on the floor and watched a movie. At that point Sammy went to bed and Dean and Lee watched one more movie then they went into Dean's room. The second the door was closed they were on each other. Somehow they both ended up on the bed Dean straddling Lee, Lee’s hands were on Dean's hips pulling them together Dean let out a surprised gasp and put his hands in Lee’s hair. They were lost in each other and didn’t hear the door opening and closing or John's footsteps coming up to Dean's room. By the time they realized someone was there it was too late and John had seen everything.
She started walking over to him confidently eyes glowing. Crowley pulled out his blade and sliced her neck silently and captures her grace in a clear vile. Crowley rolls his eyes annoyed at the fact that yet again he is saving the Winchesters and Angles making his life more difficult."Why can’t you people just sit on clouds and play on harps like you’re supposed to?" Crowley said to the dead angle in his arms pulling the blade from her hart.
C: Yes, I was thinking maybe the coffee shop on the corner of Main and Purgatory lane? It's called Heavens Garden?  They have good pie.
" So breakfast was nice, maybe we can do it again sometime with a warning next time." Dean said shooting a look at Sam who looked at the ground with a sheepish smile.
“Dammit Sammy it's my day off man,” Dean sighs in a ‘I'm tired of you but I love you voice’, “Fine let me get dressed” he moves out of the way so now a smiling Mouse can get through. Dean turned on his coffee pot before he wondered back towards his bedroom to put on clothes that would be considered acceptable for breakfast.
"Purely business. Since you’re five miles away from the Winchester’s Clubhouse, I can only surmise that you’re headed there. And that Dean has become a handful. Having him as a demon has caused me nothing but grief. Fix the problem." Crowley said voice laced in sarcasm and bordom.
The person behind the counter called their order and Gabe and Sam scooted out of the booth to get their food leaving Cas and Dean alone at the table and an uncomfortable silence fell descended over them.
Dean opened and and closed his mouth a few times and finally just stared at Cas with a surprised look on his face. Cas took one last deep breath before sliding his hand back further on his head fingers threading threw his hair. He slowly pulled Dean in closer thankful for there close heights, Cas gently but passionately pressing his lips to Deans. Dean didn't move but he didn't pull away either. Dean finding himself stepped slightly closer grabbing Cas's trench-coat lapels to keep him from moving.
"Yeah," Sam began to walk away and Cas needed Sam to understand that hes worried though hes never been good at words, "Sam."
Crowley replied turning to walk away "I’m not sentimental."
“Hello Dean, Sam,” he said in what has to be the deepest voice that Dean had ever heard, it sent shivers down his spine, “I hope you guys don't mind me joining you?” Castiel said looking at them intently, but at the same time almost shyly, Dean shook his head.
D: I would love to meet you for coffee, do you have a place in mind?
Dean hung up the phone and decided that he should at least put coffee on. Once the coffee was started he flopped back down on the couch and let his eyes fall shut. He woke up again when he heard the door open, when saw his best friend step through the door he let his eyes close again.
When Dean woke up the next morning it was to the ‘walking on sunshine’, and the sun shining in his face. He rolled over reaching for his phone and in the process knocked over the still half full bottle from the night before. He sighed as the phone stopped ringing in resignation that today nothing was going to get done, and let his head fall back to the couch. The phone started ringing again he reached over and grabbed it off the floor without moving which made him just a little bit more angry.
This work is again not finished I am not sure when I will be able to post updates so please be patient and share your thoughts and suggestions on the comments!!!
“My friend Gabe is coming too,” Sam said looking at dean with puppy eyes, Dean stopped in his tracks, then Sam spits out as fast as he can, “andhesbringinghisbrother.” But before he could say anything Sam continued, “You already said you'd go.”
"You realize one problem is solved, but one still remains. Dean is no longer a demon, that’s true. But the Mark of Cain…" Cas paused stopping emotion from leaking into his voice, "that, he still has. And sooner or later, that’s going to be an issue."
Dean looked startled, " Why green, or Blue then? What do you love?" Dean watched as Cas slowly walked a few steps forward.
Gabe smiled and happily agreed shooting a flirty smile at Sam when he thought no one was looking, Sam nodded still not quite done pouting, and Cas smiled a little and muttered a that sounds nice. Dean looked up at that and smiled wide obviously happy that Cas the quite seemingly lonely man had enjoyed himself. Cas smiled back a little bigger which lead to them standing and smiling at each other.
Cas rounded the corner just in time to see Sam with the demon knife pressed into his throat. Dean continues to taunt him, "Well … Look at you. Do it. It’s all you." Dean says with a smirk. Sam drops the knife seeing Cas closing in behind Dean. Dean smiles his eyes going black and just before he could left his arm to swing Cas had his arms around him holding him there.
In his room Dean sat looking through his pictures of his family that he kept in a box by his bed he paused on the one of him and his mom. What would she say if she was here he thought to himself. He thought about earlier before..... when he was chasing Sammy and then when Cas grabbed him and he looked back and saw just a glimpse and had to look back once more to see the bright swirl of blue and green that glowed. Some how even then he knew he had just seen Cas, really seen him for the first time. As a demon he didn't care but now.... he had so many question and didn't even know if Cas knew that he had seen a little bit of his true form. It felt like a secret like he shouldn't know, kind of like when he was a kid and would ease drop on his dad and other hunters.
Castiel watched the workmen pull their truck through the gate posts, possibly the first vehicle that was being driven this deep into pack lands in some time. The ambulance was kept close to the road on purpose. The shuttle dropped off just outside of the gate. He’d tried to negotiate with the business owner to keep motor vehicles off pack lands, but the man had refused to budge. It was a burning irritation that he hadn’t been able to negotiate that, considering how much money was going to the man, how great the expenses were besides, as well as the substantial in time completion bonus. Castiel had even offered the labor to cart any and all tools and supplies from the gate to the building site by human power. The builder had refused.
“No, I guess I qualify as abandoned,” Dean said.
Dean just pushed his anger down. Of course if he’d known how, it would have been fixed already, but you couldn’t exactly find spare parts for a thirty year old car at the Auto-Zone. Even if he could, he didn’t know how to fit the part into place. He couldn’t afford to pay someone else to fix it, not since all the household expenses were pretty much on his back, now that Dad had moved on to professional level drinking. And he couldn’t flirt and flutter his eye lashes out of this one, not to Doug, who had a lot of bullshit ideas about what Omegas owed him just for walking the Earth. Thought Alpha’s were God’s gift to the world and that if he wanted an Omega’s time, and maybe other stuff, he could just take it. No one had ever proved a damn thing, of course, but you heard stories.
He had no home to offer Dean, no savings, nothing but second rank billing with a second rate Wild West Show. People treated him as little better than a Vaudeville hack. He had no family of his own, having been raised in the Shurleyite orphanage. He had nothing to offer the truly stunning Omega that he had loved for years by that point. When Dean had offered to buy him dinner, Castiel hadn’t even the price of a restaurant meal to his name and wouldn’t until his first check that season from the show, his last penny having gone to pay his train ticket. Castiel felt the depth of his unworthiness and had fled, vowing he would go and do better.
“Riding in the Territories is rough. You won’t be able to ride sidesaddle.”
He’d brought Bobby with him on the riverboat, their other ranch hand. Bobby had been with them for years, taught Dean more about riding, about ranch management, about horses than his father ever had. John Winchester was a proud, stiff man, and ashamed, Dean sometimes thought, that he had to rely on an Omega son to run the ranch with him. Bobby had no such qualms about teaching an Omega the rough work. Dean was needed more where he was than Mary would have needed him in the kitchen with her.
“He is a highly eligible match for you,” she said.
“Sam abandoned us. Abandoned me.”
"That's the master suite," Cas told him. "That door over there is our play room."
“The only thing that the weather is telling us is that it’s unpredicatable despite the advances in weather forecasting. There are no portents here. If the Goddess wants to speak, she will do so clearly, with another manifestation.”
They didn’t want him to labor. The doctor thought that his heart was still too weak for that, that it just might  explode with the strain of trying to push a baby out. Well, that wasn’t the technical term, but that was it, basically. He had never fully recovered from the pining sickness. So, he would have a c-section with a team of cardiac specialists on standby, in case they were needed. He’d been in and out of the hospital a few times over the course of his pregnancy. Sometimes, he thought the best thing would have been if he died while giving birth. Sam and Jessica would raise his baby as if she were their own, even though they were now having one themselves. His bean deserved better than an Omega parent who could hardly manage to stand up on his own and go pee.
“What about Sam? Do they want him too?”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Angel said. “I knew that I risked my own peace of mind and heart when I went out that night. I never thought about the heart and peace of mind of the Alpha I would meet. I never meant to hurt you but I was selfish. I thought only of my own wants and needs.”
When the man put his white hat on and turned to walk out, Dean knew it was Marshal Novak, the one Sheriff Mills had told him about. He wore a long, light brown duster over a black suit, his badge shining bright silver on his chest. It was a circle around a five pointed star, on top of the star was the United States eagle, bearing the arrows and the olive branch. His eyes were bright blue, like lightening. His face was stern, almost angry. He frowned as if it were habitual and he looked like it had been a good two days since he shaved his thick beard. Despite the earthy touches like the stubble, there was something almost unworldly about the man. His eyes were a startlingly sapphire blue, like pools of water on sunny days. Dean just wanted to dive right into them. When he got closer to Dean, the Marshal’s nostrils flared a little and he took in a deep breath, as if the better get the scent of Dean.
“It’s Sam!” His little brother snarled at him. “Goddess, Dean! Just don’t even try and talk to me. Dad would be so ashamed of you. Getting to mate the Pack Alpha and all you can do is cry like a baby.”
Of course, John Winchester wouldn’t see it that way. An Alpha like that thought an Omega was something to be owned, tossed aside when it wasn’t of any current use, but that it had better be where it was left and in the same shape it was left in when he needed it again. Castiel pondered, briefly, the wisdom of seeing if Winchester could be paid to, as Dean would say, ‘take a hike’. Most people had a price, but Castiel also knew that people that could be paid off usually didn’t stay paid off, that they came back again and again looking for more. If they had any clue that money could be had easily, they would dig for it. He had that mercenary look to him, a hard meanness.
“Yeah, we usually are by this time on Full Moon,” she said, as if they didn’t mostly sell out by the end of day, most days. “You should try the raspberry lamingtons. They’re a lot better than everyone thinks they are.”
“We’ll need to start on the funeral rites,” Castiel said. “Everything that is fitting for my father as Pack Alpha. I know he was not well in his last years, but he was once the father to us all. And suitable rites for John Winchester. He died a hero’s death.”
“No,” Bobby said.
They talk. They use words.
“You’re at Margie’s, aren’t you?”
“Hello?”
Dean supposed it was a function of living in a country where each pack set their own customs, especially surrounding Omegas. This place though, this was a good place. You never saw Omegas kneeling on the floor here. One time when Dean had been here with Jimmy and Amelia, some Alpha passing through town had tried it and a manager had given him a choice of not doing that or getting thrown out. Thankfully, the jerk had allowed the Omega to sit at a chair, though Dean had heard him say, “just this once, don’t go getting any ideas.”
—I’m too young to drink, but dinner is good. I eat. I might enjoy doing it with you.—
Dean sighed as Sammy retreated to the other side of the cabin with his new novel, one of the pre-packaged meals and a whole gallon of milk. He’d be okay. A lot of kids got jealous and possessive of their older Omega siblings. It was normal for certain switches in the brain to get crossed at this stage of development and they almost always got uncrossed before the young Alpha was big enough, strong enough and potent enough to do anything about it.
When Sam started to breathe heavier then, almost snore, Dean woke up. He gently slipped out from under Sammy without waking him and climbed between the front seats and took his place at Castiel’s side, where he belonged.
They’d gotten the biggest chunk of the tree trunk blocking the road free and carried away to the firewood processing and storage area. He walked back to see about carrying another big log back. No shortage of those this morning. They probably wouldn’t have to cut down any trees for winter wood this year. The storm had downed all that they needed, looked like. He headed to where the Pack Alpha’s cabin had been and came across Cole who was staring at a chunk of shattered board stuck into the side of what little remained of a wall of the cabin. It seemed familiar somehow, that wood, and as Sam looked at what Cole was looking at, he got it. It was a shattered piece of one of the storm shutters, thrown so hard by the force of the wind that it speared through a board and batten wall. He recognized that cast iron latch.
“That’s the plan,” Garth said. “He’s doing good. No need to worry about him. Now, let’s get our little angel here taken care of.”
“How ‘bout a kiss from my extremely shy but devastatingly handsome friend here instead?” Dean countered, wrapping his arm around Castiel’s shoulder. The flannel of his outer shirt was very soft, Castiel thought. For a moment, Castiel melted. Dean had called him devastatingly handsome. His heart leaped a little. Then shrank a little when he thought about the context.
“You gotta admit, I look good,” he said.
Dean had no problem pitching in if he was needed and it wasn’t like he was the only one serving. He couldn’t approach Cas at all, not while he and Hannah were going over something that looked like a big, thick contract. That was a lesson John Winchester had once literally beaten into Dean- never interrupt an Alpha when he’s talking business with someone, no matter what. Dean passed around the tarts. The young Alphas must have had a hard work day, because they grabbed the tarts quickly, some grabbing two at a time. Once, some kid took two, stuffed half a tart into his face right away and grabbed a third even before Dean walked away. Before long, there had been only one left on his tray. He thought he would take a chance, see if he could get Castiel’s attention and maybe an invitation to sit, if not at his right hand, but at least nearby.
And Ishim could have broken custom to respectfully greet Castiel’s mate who had been presented honorably, in the expectation that courtesy would prevail where custom failed. Castiel didn’t know what else he could do. He had been led to this moment by their insults. He had given Ishim a chance to retract, to reconcile, but had only been reminded instead of something they had taken as insult, despite the fact that Castiel knew Eden had pack had a similar custom, as most packs did.
“Then we don’t have a deal,” Dean said. His arousal was instantly replaced by fury. “You misunderstand me. I’m riding out to find this coward. You’re along to see it’s all done legal like. I’d rather see him hung by the neck by a court, but if need be, I’ll ride out on my own and bury the man in the territories.”
“You mean the possibility of pregnancy? I am aware and am willing to risk it.”
“I liked that. A lot. We should try that again sometime. Soon,” Dean said, shifting back down, moving so his body was pressed up against Castiel’s side, not lying on top of him.
“And Omegas just show up and get the Alpha every time.”
“You’re sure?” Sammy asked. “Because I thought I found the one and when the chips were down, he definitely wasn’t it.”
“Cas, this is Little Dean, Sam’s oldest,” Dean said.
He was taking the pre-GED classes, so he was getting something like a high school diploma, though some of his classes, like math, were pretty remedial. John Winchester hadn’t focused a lot on their education before Dean presented as Omega and Dean had been pulled out of school once he had presented. He was years behind where he should have been. Never mind graduating high school, he hadn’t started it yet before he became Novak Pack.
“That’s the least he deserves.”
Castiel smiled, knowing she had been outflanked already on this one. “On the contrary, I already have my majority share. This morning, Gabriel and I signed the papers. He is now owner of Arcadia House and its estates. I am now the owner of the twelve percent of the mine that he owned. Both of these are our personal property and this sale not subject to approval from the Crown.”
"You look beautiful that way, my darling," Michael told him. "Don't wipe it off. We'll rub it in, so other Alphas know you're mine."
Then, to the shower with him. That was one thing that both Folsom pack and Pack Lands pack agreed on- plenty of long, hot showers and baths. Good grooming was a value they’d carried down from their ancestors. The bathroom in Jimmy’s house was particularly nice, with strong water pressure, dual shower heads, bright white clean tile, pale blue paint on the walls that weren’t tiled. It was a very modern room, a recent remodel, a strong contrast to the bath house back in the village with its slate tile walls and floors, cedar wood anywhere that wasn’t the stone.
The Omega nodded and tilted his head to give Dean access to the scent glands. Outside, he smelled even better without the grunge of Alpha musk and spilled beer to cover it up. Dean could feel himself getting hard, just from the scent of it.
“In other news,” the TV anchor Omega said. He was a blond, pretty O, well dressed. In short, the usual type you saw reading this crap. Pretty but bland. “A spokesperson for the Royal family announced that Omega Crown Princess Castiel of the Principality of Eden, Duchess of Arcadia, has returned to his retinue this morning, after having been missing for nearly twenty hours yesterday. Reportedly, the Omega Princess slipped away from security at his hotel and was seen, on security cameras, leaving the Presidential Suite at the Hilton alone. It is undetermined where he spent the time between leaving the Hilton and returning. The Principality of Eden rose to international prominence just a few short years ago when the largest ever vein of Angelthenium was discovered within its borders. The Royal family also are the majority shareholders of Grace Industries.
Something was nagging at the back of Castiel’s mind. Something was missing. He wasn’t quite sure what.
“He is the thorn in my side, not my mate to be,” Novak said. “And yes, he is too young for that. Practically a child still.”
“There’s a second film to play still,” Cas said. “This is a double feature.”
“Of course,” Castiel said, aware that Garth was manipulating him by Omega calming scent and by getting him to focus on the baby. He understood why and tried not to fight it. Dean last words to him were to ask him to take care of their girl. Would those be Dean’s last words period? The delivery had obviously gone terribly, horribly wrong. Was Dean dying or dead already? He’d heard stories of Omegas sick with pining who lived only long enough to deliver their child, then died after giving the child to the care of another.
“It’s nice out here,” Dean said as they settled onto the bed in the back of the van. Castiel did end up opening the rear doors. The late afternoon was warm approaching hot. “We should go fishing sometime.”
“It’s not a real mating,” Dean said again, ignoring her comments about the sex she thought he should be having with Castiel. Last night had been kind of the opposite of fun. Not as bad as he feared, but not great. He wished he’d maybe gotten a chance for a do-over this morning.
“Against what?” Dean said. He didn’t really believe in the devil. Hell, he hardly believed in God. They were always kind of Christmas and Easter Christian’s in his family. But these people seemed like halfway to wacko. Nice wackos at least.
“This is my hunting trip and I say who goes,” Dean insisted. “And I say this criminal isn’t going along. She as much admits to being a cattle rustler.”
“You know what sounds good? More of that watermelon we had earlier today,” Dean said, thinking of his own personal watermelon to cart around.
“Again, this is my personal life. Not pack business.”
“It is my duty. I don’t think it is a duty incompatible with your reward offer, but my duty comes first,” Novak said. The ferry pulled up to the dock and Novak directed his horse on first, then spoke to the ferryman, “Pull away. The Omega is not riding with us. He is a minor and he is an unaccompanied Omega.”
The Marshal’s left eyebrow arched high. “We are not going anywhere at first light. I ride alone. I will not endanger an Omega by taking him into the Territories.”
Somehow, with stuffing enough pizza in his face and movie after movie and his best friend at his side, he got through the second night of his mating even though his mate had left him alone. His heart ached only just a little, a nagging, fretful pain, but a manageable one.
“But it’s so early,” Castiel said moving down Dean’s body, nuzzling the side of Dean’s face, his neck. His whiskers were ticklish, but it was a delicious torture.
“Dude, literally no one else gets a vote. It’s your body and only you get to decide if you want to use it to gestate a fetus. When it happened, I made the mistake of telling Dorothy and she tried to force me to keep it. I’m just glad I’m Beta and it’s biologically impossible for an Alpha to do a scent claim on a Beta, but she used that Alpha compliance mojo bullshit on me and I just barely got my head clear in time. If I were Omega, I’d have a two year old kid now and no degree and no job and no life of my own. So, whatever you decide, don’t tell your Alpha until after.”
“The word you’re looking for is abdication, Highness,” Balthazar said. “It’s been a century since a Prince has, but you would be far from the first to abdicate. Many people thought your father abdicated in all but name and that your mother has been the ruler since she married your father.”
“So if I show up at your doorstep someday with a dead body?”
“I’m sorry there was no redemption for you, Brother,” Castiel said, softly, so the others would not hear. “I don’t think you would have wanted it anyway.”
“Yes, God, yes,” Dean said, and shimmied up a little so that his chest was at Castiel’s face, the nipples right at mouth level, which wasn’t the question Castiel was asking but a welcome answer nonetheless. Dean’s small but lush breasts were taut, engorged with milk. He sometime wondered what Dean did on the days when they didn’t meet. Surely Sam was too old to be nursing on Dean by a couple of years? He was at an age when most Alphas went away to an academy of some kind, often the pre-military, but there was university prep or pre-vocational.
“Yes, I am certain.”
“Oh, hey, little brother,” the man said. He was about of a height and same build as Castiel, but where Castiel was dark, the man was pale. His hair, where it was visible under his dark felt hat, was sandy, possibly blond. His beard as well. His eyebrows all but disappeared under the shadow of his brim. “Funny seeing you out all this way.”
“I’m not saying your brother is a whore or anything. Just saying Castiel’s got it going on, you know?”
“Maybe? I don’t know. I’ve never had one. I want sex with him because I want babies and that’s how you get those,” Dean said, finally. “I think maybe he doesn’t want sex with me because he doesn’t want babies with me.”
Dean settled into the space under Castiel’s arm, burrowing deeply.
And the hotel allowed Omegas to rent rooms on their own as well. He usually stayed there when he travelled. Unlike the Omega only boarding houses where most Omegas traveling on their own stayed for propriety’s sake, the hotel was big enough that, so long as they were discreet, an unrelated Alpha and Omega could spend a night together. Or so he heard. Not that he’d ever tried it or wanted to before.
“I’m driving ya’, runt. Cas bought me a car,” Dean said. “Leave the food. We can buy more snacks later. Be ready in two. I just have to get some stuff for myself.”
Gadreel eye was suddenly caught by Dad’s hunting journal, which Sam had left open to the page about reapers. “Oh, what’s that? That’s very fine work. Beautiful handwriting.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said. “When you react like that, it makes me uncomfortable, but that is my problem to handle. When you kneel in submission like that, the only thing I should ever do is help lift you up again. We are mates and in our pack that means you belong with me. Not to me.
“So if Castiel says that he needs your kidney, you have to give one up for a pack member, for a transplant. Even though he’s Pack Alpha, is he allowed to demand one of your kidneys?”
“Don’t get too close to Bellatrix. That horse is the apotheosis of evil,” Castiel warned.
“Silver,” Castiel said, slightly slurred. “Muh stars silver. Pure silver.”
“If you ever want me to come with you, I will,” Castiel promised. At some point soon, he would go with Dean regardless. He wanted to talk with Dean’s doctor, see how Dean really was doing. Discuss seriously if Dean might be able to have children safely some day. Tomorrow though, taking the time would be inconvenient, even if he was going to be in Folsom anyway, to meet with the realtor and the real estate attorneys again. They wanted the offer for the farm lands in a soon as humanly possible.
Dean touched Impala’s flanks with his heels and rode on ahead.
“Me?” Dean asked. Omegas did not patrol the borders. That was for Alphas to do.
“It’s your supplies.”
“He’s had a good life here. I took care of him for you.”
Then to Cas, “You will explain later and if I find that you’ve so much as touched him.”
“I have no experience with ranch work, but I can ride a horse and I’m not afraid to work hard. I could be by his side, taking some of the burden of work from him.”
Castiel saw red. Of all the inequalities that Omegas faced in this state, needing the signature of the Alpha in their life in order to keep a job was one of the worst, keeping them trapped and economically controlled. Still, he knew that Dean was making money from their business, which had done quite well, thanks to Dean’s careful management and hard work. He made sure Dean got more than his fair share of the profits.
Not that the dude didn’t look good in it. Very good. It sat on his shoulders just so, like it was made for him. He wore it with a gray and black striped tie that was classic and understated. The whole get-up reminded Dean of why he didn’t actually mind his arrangement with Cas that much. Dude was hot, despite being a little weird and kind of like a hermit, living out here in the country with the bees.
“The culvert is creepy as hell,” Sam said. “But that’s not the thin place, is it? It’s there.”
Truth was, the ranch was in better shape now than it ever had been under the direction of John Winchester. As for the family, well, they got on happily enough without the man. Dean thought he might have almost caught Ma canoodling with Bobby the other day and honestly, good for her. Dean knew that his own freedom to do as he pleased would not have been allowed should Dad have lived. He’d be in some Alpha’s kitchen, maybe with four, five pups by now, if Dad had lived. In many ways, it was better for Dean that Dad had died. Dad would have thought he was doing the right thing by Dean, but many a righteous man has cast a long shadow of misery behind him. Dean felt guilty about the facts, but they remained the facts.
“No one is responsible for your father’s death but Azazel. I’ve brought many men back across the river and delivered them into the custody of Judge Turner and his hangman. This Azazel is far from the first murderer I’ve hunted. I know the kind of evil that lurks in the heart of such men and mostly, it is banal and vile, and it has a particular scent to it.”
“Then my Dad calls me up a few nights ago, drunk off his ass, ranting about slutty, worthless Omega whores trying to take the place of his Mary, that’s my Mom’s name, and how he’s better off without him, that he threw him out for good. It sounds like he threw my Omega brother out of the house, but I don’t know why. Why would he do something like that? And why wouldn’t my brother come to me first? The cops won’t help. My dad’s not talking. I don’t know what to do. I just can’t even think straight, thinking about Dean out there on his own.”
Dean’s clothes were grubby at the best of times and today’s outfit was particularly rough, with a hole in the knee of the jeans and some unsavory looking brown stains. More to the point, they were Alpha clothing, with the look of something that had been worn and passed down. More like worn out first, then passed down. They were about three or four sizes too big, belted until they pleated and the cuffs rolled up. He could see Dean struggling with the question and he willed the young Omega to say yes, to accept the gift.
“You took a second dose of the morning after pill after you threw up, right?”
“Do I have wear this thing?” Dean asked. “Nobody’s going to be looking at me. I’ll just wear the black jeans and a black shirt or something.”
“What Omega mysteries?” Dean asked as he scrubbed his hair dry with a towel. Amelia laid out the wedding outfit for him.
“It's just I remember Lee Webb from when we were kids…”
Cas could see that Dean was only half joking and hiding his fear and sadness behind a mask that he seems to always have on. "I’m sure Sam knows that whatever you said or what you did, it wasn’t really you. It certainly wasn’t all you." Cas said quietly trying to reassure Dean that Sam wasn't taking it personally.
Castiel stared for a minute “You didn't look like you wanted to be here when we first walked in and youve barely looked at anything beside the table and me?”
Crowley rolls his eyes once again at the angle before him tired of the boys and the angle and their do the right thing attitude. "Don’t be an idiot. Yes, it’s hers, but she was killing your girlfriend. Your hands are clean. As much as it pains me to say this … You’re useless to me dead."
“I wanted to know if you would like to come to breakfast with me?” Sam pouts, “We hardly spend see each other anymore.”
Chapter 3
Dean stood there glaring at Sam silently until Sam shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Dean turned around saying nothing he reached in his cupboard and pulled out the Stanford mug he had bought the first time he visited Sam at collage. Dean pored his cup letting his brother squirm in his seat. Finally he spoke deciding he had torched his brother enough, "fine"
Finally after what felt like hours Dean wakes up his eye black but unlike all the other times it slowly goes away so his eyes are his normal fairy tale green. Cas seeing this steps forward trying to calm his heart beating hopefully at the chance of Dean being back.
