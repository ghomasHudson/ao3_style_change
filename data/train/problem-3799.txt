Cas just lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “If the quote fits.”
“But fishing? Really?”
, Cas,
Dean let out a choked sob in relief and hugged Cas tightly to him. “Scared the shit outta me, man.”
Dean started laughing while Cas looked deeply offended. “I am not tricking Dean into being with me.”
“You’re not eating?”
“He won’t.”
"Well, we're glad you're feeling better now," Cas said.
“Lucky,” Jo said.
Ms. Harvelle started the lecture as soon as the bell rang, and Cas quickly opened up his book to the proper page. Instead of looking at the explanation of how a punnett square works, however, he was distracted by the cramped writing ringing the entire page.
“It was almost like they planned that,” Sam said.
“But how do we fight it?” Dean asked, for what felt like the billionth time. “How do we get it to stop?”
“You think I wasn’t your age once?” she asked with a wistful look that made Dean feel a little nauseous.
Cas chose to answer by stuffing one of his newly assembled s’mores into his mouth.
In the end, they decided that a meet up with John Winchester was inevitable and that they might as well try to do it on their own terms. They spend a while debating where the meet up should be. Somewhere too public and they run the risk of dragging civilians into something that could potentially turn dangerous if their father gets too overzealous. Somewhere they feel comfortable and it’s like they’re handing over information on their lives. In the end they decide on an abandoned barn about half an hour out of town that Dean always passes on his way to Bobby’s. They had bandied about the idea of taking the situation to Bobby, but they thought it better to keep him out of this. If anyone could find out what Cas was (and subsequently how to kill him) it would be Bobby. They were fine when Bobby wasn’t looking, but John would insist and it would turn into a

That evening, Castiel marched towards what had been Dean’s and Sam’s room—now just Dean’s. And banged on the door with the side of his fist—

hurt.
Castiel’s own quarters in the dragonrider corridor were comfortable, with all the glowstones he could want, but far from luxurious, and he still spent a few nights a week in the Rookery—whenever he was needed. No one had tried to take his room there, despite it being the one with the largest dragonet sands; by this point, everyone expected he’d be moving back in at least temporarily whenever there was a new clutch of hatchlings.
The bird grumbles and doesn’t take beady, suspicious little dark eyes off Dean’s face.
He puts it off through Benny raising his eyes at him at dinner and drawling, “Can’t decide which one of you’s got the prettier pigtails, chief, but neither of you seems to be having much fun pulling at ‘em.”

tucking into this little hole, much less anything else. Dean flinched a little, a spasm of jerkiness every time Castiel so much as moved his fingertip. He’d almost kicked Castiel with the leg he had up, the other time. “I don't want to hurt you.”
He believed it then. He doesn’t know why it feels a little like a lie right now.
“Yes,” she agrees. Her voice is maybe a little bit quieter, like she’s just a little sorry but doesn’t know how to say it. Maybe she doesn’t know how to feel it. “Yes. It’s very unstable—we thought it was likely a buildup mechanism that was leading to the portals splitting open, but it’s more likely something like sunspots, or solar winds, and we just only catch the acceleration phase.

And, alright, it repels lightning like a

“So you go out there, and you kick ass, and you put assholes like me away where we can’t hurt good people. You have a good life, Sam. You’re gonna go far. I’m proud of you,” Dean continues, and his voice is steady. “I’m so goddamned proud of you.”
“Whatever,” Dean says dismissively, and turns his back.
“Guess the question is,” Henricksen continues, like he’s talking to himself rather than Dean, “Who’re you gonna want to be when we get back?”
” There’s a loud shuffle through the speaker like Cas is looking through what sounds like a metric fucking ton of papers and notes.

April had been smiling at him all night. But the smile was nowhere to be found now. “Why not?” she said. “Too good for someone who’s not one of your precious Candidates?”
“Mm.” Cas makes a small, throaty noise that isn’t either agreement or disagreement. “But it doesn’t obviate the fact that those rules exist for a reason, especially in a powder keg space like this one. If I were military, I’d likely be facing a court martial.”
Well.
He wasn’t

But Dean knows that there’s only one answer to that. He doesn’t look up from where he’s running his hands and the diagnostic scan on his radio—he’s got one of them and Henricksen, as their official government mucketymuck, is carrying the other, even though Victor admits that he didn’t go through the training in how to take it apart and put it back together the way Dean, Sam and Garth did—when he says “Yes sir.”
The boy’s shoulders shuddered. He looked up.
“Yeah. G’night,” he says, because that’s all there is to say.

“Says you,” Cas points out, like an asshole.
Dean blinks slowly. That’s what the memory was. Dean remembers it now: his dad changing out Sam’s burnt-out bulbs the other evening, then turning to Dean and doing the same, even as Dean stared off into the distance at nothing at all.
It was a weak attempt at an old joke that Castiel realized too late Dean probably didn’t even remember; after a moment, though, Dean's mouth lifted at one corner. Sam's face squinched up a little, but he didn't complain—even though he was almost thirteen, and Castiel knew that Dean, at that age, would have whined to the high heavens at that statement.

But there was that flicker again. Maybe not nerves. Maybe… maybe embarrassment. Maybe humiliation.

Castiel smiled a little at the gruff—accurate—rendition of Bobby. “Exactly.”
“Yeah, so, um…” Heather starts, with a little flutter of her eyelashes. She reaches up to adjust the purple headband she’s got in her light brown hair, pushing some of it out of her face.
“He doesn’t do so hot with compliments,” Sam notes wryly.
Yes, I headcanon Dean as someone who would just devour books by the series if given the opportunity.

Dean’s never asking Cas if it’s possible, because Cas almost definitely knows the answer and Dean just does. Not. Want. To. Know.
silently, it twists, it fills the world and then a second later shrinks to a glowing needle stabbing the sky. It doesn’t have weight, it doesn’t have force, but it’s shoving at them.
“Sure are.” Well, maybe Dean’s ribs took a little bit of a kicking, but they’ll be good as new by the time they make it back to Alabama, especially if Sam takes over some of the driving. “Got ourselves a nice spot here right outside the Rocky Mountains. Two stars and all, livin’ the high life on the company card.” Dean grins. “Might even get myself a burger on room service.”
The first hour was… tolerable. Castiel buried himself in his favorite book; when it got too hot, he stripped off his shirt. He drank his way through a carafe of water in sips, enjoying the way it felt so cool against the back of his tongue.

“Yeah,” Dean agrees, and squeezes his shoulder. “It sucks.”
And now that he’s looking, he sees the deep, slow breath Cas takes before he starts to talk again, and the way he holds his shoulders so steadily, facing forward towards them because he won’t try and hide by making himself smaller. He keeps talking, like this isn’t really fucking personal to him, too.
“Oh, rub it in, will you,” Dean muttered, but it wasn’t without a hint of a smirk lingering around the corners of his mouth and a touch of amusement in his eyes.

He trails off into an awkward silence. Dean thinks fast. “I just, y’know, got watch tonight, and this thing’s got to stay on anyway through the night to record data, right? So maybe, uh… you could keep me company.”
Castiel informed her, frowning, but her eyes didn’t swirl any more quickly or more slowly at that. She just blinked her flight membranes at him like she wasn’t sure what he meant by it, and tipped slowly over onto one side, leaning on Impala and curling her wing behind her. The skin on her sides was starting to detach in loose shreds. Castiel put a hand on the slightly concave arc of her stomach, rubbing gently, and heard her rumble a deep purr.
The kid’s just looking at him eagerly, though—with those big blue eyes, the pouty mouth, the gentle tilt upwards of his chin as he rocks back in his chair, wearing a pair of Walmart Levis and a flannel that’s a little too big for his skinny shoulders. Shit, Jack really does look so
“Dean!”
“So, what’s wrong?”
“Hi babe,” Dean called, throwing his hat and keys on the table in the entrance hall. He could hear the TV on and guessed that was where Cas was. He decided to try and play it cool to begin with, to pretend that today had never happened. “I’m home!”
All heads in the room turned towards the croaky voice of Dean Winchester.
Cas stifled a laugh, already getting over his previous butterflies and loving the way Dean so easily went from professional to sneaky older brother in less than 0.4 seconds. Apparently, he could return to professionalism faster though, and acted as if he hadn’t mentioned anything he just had.
Dean said nothing and instead turned his worried gaze to Sam. He shook his head in disbelief as his eyes began to well with tears.
Sam furrowed his eyebrows and glanced over his shoulder at Dean. He shouldn’t have been surprised to see Dean holding his chest, admiring his new additions.
“I knew it!” Charlie repeated. “I mean, I always had a feeling; but I could never be certain. And then after today; I had to check it out or myself. Oh man! I knew it! I fucking called it man!”
“Everything?” He asked cautiously.
“You asked, on his behalf, what was between my legs… I merely informed him,” Cas’ voice remained calm and Dean couldn’t believe it. “It’s nothing but the truth.”
“John!” Mrs Winchester snapped, standing up. She still held Dean’s hand. “Don’t do this; the poor boy is just doing his job!”
So, when he had woken, merely 30 minutes before he was due to be walking into his office and starting work, it had been a mad rush to get himself ready and out of the door in time.
Cas dipped his head down and shared a soft, long, warm, open-mouthed kiss, pulling Dean's bottom lip in his teeth as they pulled apart.
They laid cuddled together for a moment, and Dean let himself fall further asleep again. But where the two were lying intertwined, Dean felt Cas’ every movement. He jarred awake especially when Cas threw the cover’s back and stranded to climb away from him.
What had he done?
“She works for me…” Dean mumbled quietly.
that, the voice and threat alone sending chills down Dean’s spine and all the blood rushing to his cock. But at the same time, he didn’t want to go over Cas’ knee while that large hand laid heavy-slap after heavy-slap on his ass; because he knew once it was all finished and he was all taken care of, he would be parked back on the seat in front of his desk and have to sit on his sore, throbbing ass until all his work was completed.
Dean looked up at the sound of the voice. It was the older student, now back on his own two feet, and Dean knew without having to even try that his words were lost once again. The other guy smirked with a knowing glint in his eyes as he held his hand out to help Dean to his feet.
It seemed to take a moment for what he’d just said to sink in. Gabriel was trying to hold back the smirk.
“Yep,” Sam nodded. “And a hot water bottle, a few tubs of ice cream, chocolate and some pie.”
“Dean, the children do not call me professor. They call me Mr Novak.”
“Oh, hello Professor,” Dean smirked, leaning against the door and popping his hip out. “This is a surprise.”
Dean opened his mouth to fight his corner, but Sam hurried to continue before he could.
~FORBIDDEN~
“What?” Cas snapped harshly, pressing the phone to his ear. He listened to Kevin’s hurried rambles for a minute, pinching the bridge of his nose tighter with each passing word. He could feel the frustration building already. “Can’t it wait, Kevin?!”
“Sir,” Dean continued, and Cas could have snapped at him. “If you could please step out of the vehicle.”
“Cas, I…” Dean started, but he wasn’t quick enough.
Dean paled. It had been talked about; and ultimately, that was the goal. Originally Dean had been completely against the idea, but Castiel had brought him round to it. One day, Dean would give everything up and become Castiel’s right hand man… and he wanted that, kinda. But he didn’t know if he could bring himself to doing it just yet.
In the end, it was the promise of cuddles that had Dean diving into his studying.
“Cas, no…” Dean hushed.
“Then I guess I’m in,” Dean huffed, as if he didn’t want to do it. But Cas knew, better than anyone that the way into Dean Winchester’s heart was through his stomach.
And suddenly it clicked. Sam remembered. Dean had collided with a student ambassador and both of them had gone crashing to the ground, surrounded by what looked like a million comics (it had felt like it too when they had to pick them all back up again).
“I don’t want to
Castiel frowned and turned his eyes away from Dean. He set them back on the TV but paid the colourful pictures no mind.
“Wasn’t gonna say anything about that. Octopuses, huh? I like that kind of thing,” Dean answered, then smirked. “Hey, tentacles, what’s not to like?”
But. Benny. Garth. Victor. Dad.
That? That was no moment. That’s a little blunt. Like water is a little wet. Wow. Okay. What?
It's not a question. And it leaves Dean feeling naked and flayed. “You’re my best friend,” he manages. “That’s… y’know. That’s what you
Castiel raises his chin and meets Dean’s gaze. He doesn’t look away. Neither of them do. “Maybe,” he agrees, slowly. He feels his head tip to the side. “Would you turn me in like that?”
Rowena, after an arched, silent moment, smiled—a long, slow pull at the corners of her lips. It looked like approval. It looked like
Into the next thrust, Dean tightened sharply around Castiel's length, his body going rigid—tight enough that Castiel jerked to a stop, gasping—no, had he hurt Dean? He'd seemed to be enjoying it so much—
Dean blinks, then chuckles. “Okay, maybe you’re right about that.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says a little helplessly, reaching out to pull her away by cupping his hand around her whole body. But she screeches a complaint that makes Dean’s ears ring and comes scampering right back, starting to pick at the label. “She likes the noise her beak makes against the glass.”

A confused little wrinkle appeared between Sam’s eyebrows. “But you’ve been avoiding Dean—your best friend since before I could string together a full sentence. Avoiding all of us, Cas.” He lifted his hands, though he didn’t get to the point of throwing them into the air. “Hell, my room’s

Dean’s never asked why his brothers didn’t. Not everyone’s close like him and Sammy, and even they had their rough patches.
“I… I thought I was making a friend,” Castiel says, finally. He grimaces at how childish it sounds, even if it
“Castiel, are you coming?” Naomi asks, over her shoulder. Her expression still hasn’t changed. Her gaze flicks, just for a moment, to Dean, but she doesn’t acknowledge that he’s there. None of them did.
(T) - Dean and Cas take a road trip.
“Fractured?” Castiel snarls.
Dean laughs. “Mildred?”
Dean rolls his eyes at the fact that Cas needs someone to
(Dean doesn’t leave the doorway, though. So Castiel has to turn sideways and press against him to make his way in. It might be a power game. It might be something else.)
“Nothin’, just…” He hitched up one shoulder, talking with his mouth still full. “I dunno, I guess… I guess I was hopin’ one of the little lizard guys would keep you company. Hang out with you. You know. After I leave for Bakerhold.”
Gabriel had taken sympathy on Castiel eventually and had allowed him to avoid Dean Winchester for the rest of his shift. But the next day, when Castiel approached his brother, he wasn’t surprised when Gabriel sent him straight to Winchester’s room.
“Are you okay?”
“No!” She demanded, reaching desperately out to Dean. “Daddy!”
Cas looked over the menu with raised eyebrows. He was used to this, and put the menu down before standing up.
Cas pulled his mobile out of his jeans pocket and typed out a quick
Sam’s breath caught in his throat again at all this new information being thrown at him. Benny chuckled but took pity on him.
!" Dean finally managed to get the cell phone in his hand, and just as he did, the call connected.
He grumbled, more asleep than awake for a moment. He blinked his eyes open and lifted his head slightly to see the digital clock blinking on his bedside table.
He tapped his foot quietly against the white, shiny floor and listened to the tap-tapping of Meg’s fingers on her keypad. A radio was playing music softly through the speakers, dotted around the room. Meg then picked up the phone, and her voice sounded, loud around the almost silent space.
“You can say that again,” Dean scoffed, crossing his ankles as he stretched out. “And they have to deal with so many extra parts!”
Kevin on the other end of the phone, waffled on for a moment.
In the next moment, an Asian man appeared. Dean recognised him as Kevin, a guy who turned up at the house once in a blue moon because Castiel was being stubborn and not answering his phone. Kevin hauled the mob boss away, guiding him through the gunfire and out of the warehouse; soon, the rest of the gang followed suit.
The angel was looking at him weird. He stepped forwards, tilting his head. His blue eyes were calculating and Dean shivered. He knew that Cas was literally staring into his soul, but that look always did things to him.
“Sam too, is female?” Cas asked slowly.
Cas couldn’t help but smile smugly, as Dean entered the kitchen that morning with a slight limp, and a large, purpling love-bite on his neck. Dean shot him a quick look, and if Cas wasn’t expecting it, he would have missed it.
She took their order, popping her hip and chest out, in Dean’s direction. Her smile and words were flirtatious and Sam sighed impatiently, watching his brother eating out of the palm of her hand.
“Oh man,” Dean groaned, falling back. Castiel hurried to his side, at the same time the other man in the room did.
“What the hell was the freak out for then?”
“Cas, you know I can’t lie on an official document,” He explained, his CEO voice dropped in an instant, now sounding like a whiny child, and sounding more like the Dean he knew. Cas shrugged his shoulders, smirking too. Dean thought for a minute. “I know, I’ll write
you are.”
Dean wanted to believe him, but when a third, louder, more persistent knock sounded, he knew that whoever it was, wasn’t going away. Castiel seemed to realise it too.
The two men laid together in each other’s arms, surrounded by a cosy, comfortable silence. Their clothes lay around the floor haphazardly. The curtains of the room were still open, and the setting sun cast the last few dregs of light into the room and over the bed, basking them in its last warmth of the day.
Dean paled. Cas bit his tongue to keep from laughing at his flustered hunter.
Castiel nodded once but didn’t take look back at him and still didn’t speak.
Oh god.
“No,” Castiel decided. “I think it’s not nearly enough, personally. I think you should be weighting on me hand and foot for the rest of forever to make up for this.”
“I really am sorry Cas!” Dean begged for his husband to really hear the apology this time. “I really am! Please!”
“Drama queen,” Dean rolled his eyes. Cas hummed again but leant across to capture Dean’s lips. It was the sign that Dean was forgiven, mostly, and the cop accepted it readily.
“It there going to be a problem Sammy?” Dean asked, voice rough and stubborn. Sam looked behind Cas to his brother, almost surprised to see him still stood there.
When they pulled apart, Dean’s pupils were wide with wonder and lust; his cheeks slightly pink. Castiel loved how Dean reacted to each kiss as if it was their first. Cas chuckled and his tongue darted out to lick his lips.
Dean nodded slowly and smacked his lips together. He was quickly falling back to sleep again, and Cas reached down to press a kiss to Dean’s forehead. He would text Dean the details later, because he wasn’t sure if the man would remember once he woke up.
He then returned to the laptop and, Cas guessed, typed out their address. He then turned his attention back to his husband again.
“What the hell is in here Dean?” Sam grumbled, feeling like he might just crumple under the weight of it.
Cas leant across and pressed a kiss to Dean’s temple.
The smirk he got from his boyfriend was damn exhilarating and Dean felt his heart fluttering. And when the distance between them started to get smaller, Dean felt his breath hitch.
“Good boy,” He praised, warmly. “Cuddles?”
“Pain,” Castiel explained, in a gasp of breath. He was huffing and puffing, trying to get his breathing back under control. “He’s in pain. Needs more morphine.”
“See you later, short-stack!” Dean called as he walked out of the kitchen.
Cas scoffed and reached over to unplug the iron.
Dean grunted and went over to the fridge. He stared into it for a moment, before sighing in frustration and closing it again.
“Pa!” Claire called when she saw him.
“Did you check?” He asked playfully.
Dean threw his down onto the table, liking the comforting
A few minutes later though, Dean got his reaction, kind of.
. Maybe it really was time to start thinking more seriously about joining Cas.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh.
The knocking at the front door sounded loud around them.
They were both tired of the suits they were practically having to wear all the time, and as much as they had once had to rely on fast food in previous years, they had both recently gotten a real taste for good home cooked food and missed it dearly, what with being away from the bunker. (And Dean wouldn’t admit it, but he missed cooking it all).
“Sam?” Dean prompted.
Cas’ voice dropped an octave and Sam couldn’t stop balking, eyes wide at finding out this little titbit of information. Dean squawked slightly, his face burning brighter. And then Cas seemed to understand.
“Don’t get into too much trouble!” Dean shouted back. Cas heard him fumbling round for his keys. He called out again, voice light and joking. “I really don’t want to have to arrest you! Love you!”
Gabriel couldn’t stop laughing. Now he had started, he was finding it so hard to stop.
“Nurse?”
“Charlie,” Dean addressed the police officer, who just so happened to be a friend of his. “Now is not the right time to be asking about my husband.”
“So,” Sam poked, teasingly, already knowing the answer because of the position he’d found the two in this morning but wanting to hear Dean’s version. “Are you the big spoon or the little spoon?”
“Always hurt, ma,” He admitted to her, before shifting himself so he could better see his father.
“What’s this?” Sam asked with a sigh, turning from his laptop to glance at the closed file.
“Alright,” He sighed. “I know when I’m not wanted.”
Later on, as Dean was saying goodbye to his family, his thoughts were still occupied by Castiel and how amazing it would be to see him pull off that sickening yellow polo shirt.
“Comics?”
Breakfast came out, and Dean flirted some more with their waitress, soaking up her responses and having a whale of a time. When she left them alone once again, the brothers started talk about the hunt once again.
“I hate you,” Cas grumbled, knowing his boyfriend could hear what he was saying. He also knew that Dean knew he didn’t mean it. “I fucking hate you!”
“No flirting allowed,” Dean all-but whispered.
Castiel shook his head, unsure whether he would be able to retell the story.
“Your Papa is a party pooper,” Dean grumbled to the little girl in his arms as he climbed back into the bed.
to get used to this!” Dean hissed, slumping down on the edge of the bed and scuffing his feet against the rough carpeted floor. “Son of a bitch,” He cursed again, more quietly.
Gabriel tried to make heads-or-tails of what Castiel was trying to tell him, but with the man talking at a mile-a-minute, it was next to impossible.
And that’s what they did. Charlie sat in the living room, feeling slightly anxious to be sat in a mob boss’ home, but she tried not to let it show. Dean and Cas walked into the room simultaneously, Dean now dressed, and Cas looking very domestic carrying a tray of 3 steaming mugs.
“Maybe when I leave here, we can arrange for you to feel them some more?”
When Dean finally emerged from the bathroom, he was looking a little better. There was colour in his cheeks again, and he looked refreshed.
to take the Winchester name as his own.
~COMIC BOOK LOVERS~
“Yeah, well… uh…” John chuckled nervously, looking successfully chastised as he tried to think of a comeback.
But his older brother just slowly raised a forkful to his mouth and chewed obscenely with the sounds to match. Sam looked to Cas for help, but he was too busy smiling and blushing over Dean’s antics. If Sam wasn’t so terrified of the stories about Azkaban he would have throttled the both of them with their own ties. Instead he kicked Dean under the table.
There was a resounding boom as their front door slammed into the wall from the force with which it was thrown open. “Cassie!”
Dean shrugged, still avoiding her eyes. “Where’re the snacks?” he asked.
Dean snorted and shoved at Cas as much as he could. “Well, thanks for that assessment, Cas, but I’ve really got to get going.” He gave up again with a sigh. “If you let me out of bed right now I’ll have time to suck you off before work.”
“But did it work?” Charlie asked.
“It’s true,” Dean said, clapping Sam on the shoulder. “Dude’s useless until at least ten. And then he still needs a cup of coffee and full meal before he’ll play nice.”
“You love it here, Dean,” Cas replied. “We have friends here, businesses that you love. We have a life here, Dean. Together.”
“Yeah, I know,” Cas said. “But we never really do anything in front of other people.”
Dean grabbed at the paws, trying to move them but to no avail. He tried to shimmy his body to hopefully dislodge the creature, but it was again ineffective. It did, however, remind Dean of the gun he had tucked into the back of his jeans as he felt it push into the small of his back. He reached a hand behind himself, cut his arm on one of his feathers, but managed to grab the gun. He pulled it out in a fluid motion, aiming and letting a half a dozen shots fly directly into the things chest.
“Same page,” Charlie said in a squeak. “Definitely on the same page. I mean, video games are one thing, but they don’t exactly prepare you for the real thing, you know?”
“Dean, may I come in?” Cas asked, standing just outside the doorway.
“Dean!”
Charlie and Jo were already in the dining hall when they got there.
John just gestured to the photo with his gun. “What the hell is this?”
“Dean?” Mary said, rushing out of her room. “Honey, what’s wrong?”
you’re making out—“
“Yeah,” Cas continued. “You’re like Simba. He was adorable, too.”
“I don’t know,” Sam said, making his way towards the door, pulling Jess along with him. “I must have gone temporarily insane, thanks for helping me realize what a huge mistake I was making.”
“Got the knife,” Cas gasped out.
But it was just a note. Sam picked it up gingerly by the corner nonetheless, and read in Dean’s untidy scrawl:
“It was my wish,” Dean said in little more than a whisper. That’s why Cas was embarrassed. He was embarrassed
“Ah,” Bobby said, finally putting his coffee down. “Hence the favor, I’m assuming.”
“Wait, what?” Sam asked. “Well, then it won’t work, right? It doesn’t matter.”
Cas smiled, big and gummy. “You think my eyes look awesome?”
“Yeah, she was cool,” Dean agreed. “I can’t believe Charlie met her while LARPing.”
“Nothing,” Sam said honestly. “But I may have overheard Dean talking to Cas.” He leaned over and rested his elbows on his knees, rubbing his hands over his face. “You know how I told you that Dean got into a lot of fights when he was younger?”
Cas rolled his eyes. “I did. I said you were
“I’m his husband,” Cas told him, wings flaring, trying to push past Dean to go in for another attack.
“So, Dean…” Cas started, still in awe with a pinch of confusion.
Cas mirrored the sympathetic look back to Dean who just brushed it off with a shrug. “I needed him to take me to the auto parts shop anyway. I’d rather he get all of his disappointed yelling out on a fifteen minute car ride instead of the thirty minute one. Now it’ll just be awkward, disappointed silence on the way to get the parts.”
Sam laughed, refusing to admit that Ansem’s story about the yellow eyed monster still gave him nightmares.
The shopping trip was a success according to Dean who bought enough food to last them at least three weeks.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said. “I lost my temper.”
“Oh my god, it is you.”
“How?” Dean asked. “We’re going to have to move. I hate moving.”
“You know," Dean said shyly, once Sam’s footsteps had faded down the hall, "you don’t have to get me anything for my birthday,”
“Do you want it to go away?” Cas asked softly.
Charlie narrowed her eyes at him. “Well, none of this information explains why you were all smiley when you got here. Actually, I figure you would have been all mopey and grumpy.”
He let out a soft exhale. Was it really his fault that the only thing to do was stare longingly at his best friend? Was it really so bad? He took one look back at Dean who was now snoring a little, half his face smashed into the drool-soaked couch cushion and when he felt his heart constrict in his chest he knew that yes, it was that bad.
“Fine!” Sam shouted, and Dean finally allowed him to squirm his way out of the headlock. “Ugh, you’re such a jerk,” he said, fixing his hair where Dean had messed it up.
Dean scoffed.
Cas growled so Dean planted a kiss on the side of his mouth.
“Sam!” Ava had come back to yell at him. “We are getting left behind!” She stomped her foot on the ground to emphasize her frustration with him.
“Who?”
is already in the player, so sit down, take a load off. You’ve been working yourself to death lately.”
Dean nodded. “Me, too,” he said softly.
Jo shrugged. “Like everyone at the bar. Why?”
Sam shook his head. “Not in so many words,” he said, trailing off as he thought about how the words weren’t even directed towards him.
“Let’s go, lover boy. The dance started five minutes ago and I’m sure your prince charming is searching high and low.”
don’t know how bad he could get?” Sam laughed. “Dude, all me and dad ever did was fight.”
“Jeez, Ava, calm down!” Sam said, trying to wrestle his shirt out of her grip, but her fingers were like vices.
“This was the last one they had at the store,” Dean grumbled.
“It was freaky at first,” Dean informed him. “I mean, shit. You don’t know how weird it is to trust someone instantly and absolutely. It’s like…” Dean pursed his lips and leaned back into Cas’ embrace. “One day there’s dad telling you to trust no one and the next thing you know there’s this person who you just
Dean barely refrained from rolling his eyes. He hated being a legacy. It did come with special treatment, just not the kind anyone wanted. For Dean, it just meant that his grandpa used to work here way back when and people still felt bad for his family because he died so horribly they never even recovered his body. There was even a plaque dedicated to him and his Bondmate so every kid who came here knew that Dean was never going to live up to his grandpa’s uber heroic legacy.
He grinned as he leaned in to kiss her. “What would I do without you?”
“No.” Sam tried pushing them back and closing the door on him, but then John walked forward. Sam saw the exact moment Dean noticed, his eyes shuttering and his posture straightening like he was in the presence of a superior commander.
“He has begun threatening to move out,” Cas said.
“Dad,” Sam stepped in when he saw John open his mouth to reply, probably with something scathing. “Don’t push it. Just go.”
“Yes,” Cas continued. “Which is why I think that, though they’re not people, perhaps they could be a window that people can look through. Your loved ones are still there, but they are not the stars themselves.”
Dean just shook his head again. “How did I get so lucky?”
“Makes sense,” Dean said. “You were promoted.”
.” Cas shook the hand he still held out.
Dean kissed him then, slow and long and just on the cusp of indecent.
Dean sped the whole way home. He was sure he left marks when he turned onto his street, but his mind was far from caring about anything so trivial.
Dean grabbed his wrist and pulled him into a kiss. “You gunna keep your wings out, babe?”
The gym had been decorated with balloons and streamers in red and white, photo booth in one corner, drinks and snacks in another, game booths spanning the far wall like some sort of carnival. It looked decent, even if the ever present scent of B.O. still lingered in the air, like a sign seen from the corner of your eye. It was definitely still the gym, no matter how much glitter they doused it in.
The others arrived about fifteen minutes later, Sam trailing awkwardly behind Meg and Hannah with his date, Ruby, in tow. She was a pretty, dark haired girl with a scowl to rival Meg’s.
“What is that?” she whispered.
“He’s going to try and kill me,” Cas corrected him.
Cas grinned. “That was a very good upside. Unfortunately, it will not apply to tonight.”
“Shut up, Dean,” Sam said. “Don’t be a jerk, just come with me.”
“Um, thank you,” Cas added, before following.
Cas’s cheeks reddened. “Apparently only when you’re not staring at me,” he replied.
“Ava?” Dean called, stepping forward. “You’re Ava, right?” But the girl made no sign she had heard anything. Just kept standing there.
Cas narrowed his eyes. “Fine, but you’re going to suffer with me. You have to wear a flannel shirt.”
“I know what you are,” John said to him.
“This was it five minutes ago, too,” Jess told him. “We’re already like ten minutes late, we really should go inside now.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Dean runs his own car restoration business. He’s very in demand.”
Cas rubbed a hand across his forehead. “Dean, he’s already seen you.”
“You have no idea.” Dean couldn’t stop smiling for the rest of their conversation. Not even talk about Dean’s father, who was now starting to hound Bobby for any information on Dean, could dampen Dean’s mood.
“You sure?” he asked. “You seem a little out of it. I can take Balthazar to the airport on my own if you’re not feeling up to going—“
“Great, now I’m getting nutritional advice from the guy who only eats fruit that’s baked into a pie.”
“His name is Cas. That’s all you’re getting. Now leave because I have to go meet my girlfriend.”
Dean shrugged. “Don’t make a big deal out of it.”
“You promise you’ll listen to me?” he asked
Cas just shrugged. “May I go and get the beer now?” he asked. “I promise not to terrify random passerby with my true form and tip hunters off to my whereabouts. Even though doing so is my one true joy in life.”
“Balthazar is here.”
“We’ll be right down,” Cas told him.
“What does that mean? ‘What he’d been through’?” Sam asked, caught off guard at the direction of Bobby’s answer. He was also a little annoyed that everyone seemed to be taking Dean’s side with the whole ‘woe-is-me, Sam abandoned me’ shtick. “I mean, not to sound self-centered or anything, but what about what I went through? I thought he was
“Hello, Dean,” he said. “Would you mind grabbing the syrup?”
“Fine,” Charlie said. “Argument over. I win.”
and instead of thinking the guy’s a nutjob, I trust him.” Dean grinned and shook his head. “I mean, it’s still weird sometimes. Like when I want to be mad at him but there’s this huge part of me screaming that I should go and make up with him.”
“No,” Sam said. “It’s just, uh, Dean called me.”
Dean grinned as he looked Cas up and down. He did look great in his deep blue sweater that actually showed off the athletic body usually hidden beneath his favorite boxy trench.
Charlie got a teasing smile. “It is a little cheesy.”
“Maybe we’ll even have a little fun with both our wands.” The tone was serious again, but this time there was the undercurrent of sincerity that had Dean spluttering and flustered instead of sullen and moping.
It was Cas’ favorite part of the day. Shoulder to shoulder with his best friend (their closeness excused as platonic since they needed to share the body warmth in this chilly weather), staring up into the inky darkness dotted with a handful of stars, as if some preschooler had gotten stingy with the glitter. Cas wasn’t exactly an astronomy buff, but he did love staring up into that staggering depth and wishing he could exist in it.
“How do they know that you’re not going to mess up taking his vitals? Maybe that’s why he’s not getting any better, because they keep sending fucking trainee’s! You should not be allowed to work in a hospital until you earn your fucking degree! You keep messing everything up! That’s why he’s not even able to use the toilet by himself yet! That’s why he can’t sit himself up! That’s why he can barely feed himself! Because they keep sending
Cas smiled. “To the best of my abilities.” And with that, he also left the room.
“Dean!” his father shouted, raising his hand to smack him again.
“I’m processing,” Sam said. “I mean, dude. You’re like the opposite of who you used to be.”
“Aw, babe,” Dean blushed. “It’s in the job description.”
With a soft snort of laughter, Dean leaned over and kissed him again, this time on the lips.
“What do you think that was about?” Charlie asked.
hadn’t even known, but he thought that conversation might be better between just Dean and Cas.
be, but Charlie just rolled her eyes again.
Cas just shrugged. “Bobby was serious.”
Dean made a disgusted looking face and threw the head away from himself.
Cas gave him a quick squeeze. “After dinner. I’m starving.” He let go of Dean and hurried out the door of their room.
“Nothing,” Sam said, eyes darting from Charlie to the phone. “I’m—um—not feeling very good anymore. I think I’m just going to…” He pointed towards the hall and his room and then bolted before anyone could ask him what was wrong.
“I could ask Gabriel,” Cas suggested.
summer,” Dean argued. “But I can still ditch you two for part of it.”
Dean just shrugged. “Probably this lame music,” he yelled back.
“Just speculating on how you guys would plan it.”
Dean chuckled.
“It’s possible, though I’ve never heard of it,” Cas replied and he began walking towards Dean once more, not stopping until he had backed him up against a wall. “I suppose I could ask Professor Slughorn about it, if you really wanted to know.”
Sam’s grin was sheepish. “I can’t help it,” he said. “It’s just too good.”
Dean wiped a hand over his face and gave Cas the cliff notes of what Bobby had told him.
Cas looked over at him with wide eyed excitement and grabbed three more marshmallows, sticking them all on the skewer. Dean was pretty sure that was too many to get an even cook, but he wasn’t going to do anything to diminish Cas’ enthusiasm. He decided to do the same, grabbing a handful of marshmallows and popping one in his mouth before putting the rest on the skewer.
“We are soul mates,” Cas replied, matter of fact. “And if one of us is the sap in this relationship, it is most definitely
,” Dean insisted.
“A friend,” Sam said evasively.
“It is quite pleasing, yes,” he agreed, taking a larger bite.
“Yeah, I’m not exactly the glitter type either.”
Dean barely heard him. Hell, Dean barely remembered he was there because Castiel Novak,
After that Sam seemed to come back to himself, more so than he'd been since the whole monster debacle took place. Dean couldn't stop smiling. He had his brother back, he had the best boyfriend in the world, and his mom surprised them all with a cherry pie. It was pretty much one of the best days ever. Even after Sam saw Cas' hickey and started teasing them while simultaneously making gagging sounds.
“Better,” she said. “Now hurry up and finish eating. You have to get to school early today for your field trip.”
“Where’s your other half?”
They both nodded and shot each other a quick glance with shy smiles.
“Maybe because you’re making a scene,” Sam said, staring at the deer in headlights look his brother had now. Sam rolled his eyes and elbowed him. “Seriously, Dean. They’re going to make you leave if you start freaking out the star of the show.”
“Sammy, I’m sorry,” Dean choked. “It’s okay.” His chest began to burn.
Dean kept his eyes shut tight and took another breath in before pouring it out. “Okay,” he said, eyes fluttering open. “I’m okay.”
“Who raised you?” Cas asked, wiping a bit of crumble off of his shirt from where it had landed after it flew out of Gabriel’s mouth.
“You would know,” Cas replied. “You, apparently, spend a lot of time looking at my eyes.”
Dean shrugged. “According to you, maybe. But he treats me better than you ever have.” He took Cas’ hand and held it tightly. “If I have to ask you to leave again, I’m going to let Cas do it.”
Thankfully, Cas left without further prompting. Dean let out all of the air in his lungs and banged his head against the lockers behind him. “Suck it up, Winchester,” he told himself. “You got this.”
Dean harrumphed. “I’m just saying,” he continued, trying to not let Cas’ kisses soothe his annoyed expression. “You could have told me that you wouldn’t be back until dinner.”
Dean pushed him and Cas pushed back, both giggling when they stumbled their way back to where Mary was getting plates down from the cabinet.
Sam’s hands dropped from where he had been pressing them tightly against his mouth. “I was going to ask Dean dumb questions about his crush to get him back for being mean to me about Jess.”
Cas listened as his mother made the phone call. Something had happened at the New York branch of her company that could not, in fact, wait a week so that she could take Cas to school on the first day. Instead, Cas was stuck leaning against her door to try and hear her talk her way into special treatment for her and her son.
Charlie had a distant look in her eye. “We can work with this,” she told him.
He slammed the book closed and forced himself to pay attention as his heart raced.
. It was that same buzzing feeling, but stronger, and… The only way he could think to describe it was like the moment before glass shattered from high frequency.
“What? Of course not,” Sam told him, hurt coloring his tone. “I mean, I still don’t know
“What?” Sam asked. “Seriously?”
Seven figures stood before them, statue like. The missing teens and the missing children. Everyone except for—
Cas cleared his throat. “I apologize.” He turned to Dean. “Did you replace his shampoo or hex it?”
“You talking about me getting kidnapped or you getting stabbed?”
Dean forced his eyes open and saw Sammy lying next to him, eyes wide open, blanket clutched to his chest.
Jess patted him on the shoulder. “That’s just a nuance. The anger your feeling towards him, it’s the same anger he felt towards you.”
“What the fuck!” Dean shouted into the eerie stillness that followed. He had a moment’s indecision before grabbing a flashlight from his bag and running towards where he saw it land, ignoring the voice in his head shouting at him that this is how people get killed in horror movies.
Which is why, when Dean came running up to Cas after school to ask if he could spend the night, Cas’ response wasn’t immediate.
“Or maybe the monster got them, too,” Charlie cut in. “They were last seen in the woods, right? Sam and his friends saw them and then they saw the real thing? Nobody saw them after that.”
Cas squinted at him. “I said I’ve loved you for a very long time. Yesterday happened to be the day that I told you about it. Upon seeing your reaction, I do wish I had told you sooner, but I no longer have the ability to time travel.”
“Cas,” Dean said, putting his hands on either side of his face. “I’m sorry. I really am. I was being stupid and I wasn’t thinking. I’m sorry you fell for an idiot.”
Cas just cackled in response. “I’m only joking.”
“Less so when you comment on it.”
But Dean just grinned. “Admiring my artwork?”
His breathing got shallow and his palms started sweating.
“His hand, Dean,” Cas said.
“Why?” Cas asked. “You LARP.”
“I think I’ll make some calls tomorrow,” Cas said, closing his eyes and making himself more comfortable against Dean’s side. “See if they can speed up construction for our island. I believe we deserve a vacation.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You just want me to retire and spend all day at home like you.”
Cas outright smiled at that. “Dean hates this story,” he told her.
“Ah, the famous Gilda,” Dean said as the three of them made their way into the house. “Where is she?”
“No, it’s not that,” Dean assured him. “I want this, I just…” Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “This is real, right? Because I can’t lose you again, Cas, I just can’t.”
Cas nodded. “Let’s just hope he doesn’t try to bring Jo and Charlie in on anything. Then, I believe, we’d see how bad it could truly get.”
“Boy, I don’t care if it was a friend of the damn Pope!”
“Well then where did she go?” Jo asked. “She wasn’t knocked up by her lesbian girlfriend. And the dudes definitely didn’t have to worry about being a baby daddy.”
“It would be a lot easier to hide this thing in the winter,” she grumbled.
The blood drained from Dean’s face and his breathing came more quickly. He felt the beginnings of a panic attack coming on and without Cas’ soothing voice he couldn’t remember how to stop it. The pounding in his head increased as he heard the rush of blood through his racing heart amplified tenfold in his ears. He couldn’t catch a breath, he was going to suffocate, he couldn’t get any air into his lungs.
Cas grunted.
“Uh, I was sort of hoping you could tell me that.” Dean kept a grip on Sam’s shoulder, sure that it was the only thing grounding his little brother who’s eyes kept flitting around as if the answers could be found hidden somewhere in the air.
The phone rang then, and perhaps Dean should have seen it as an omen, but he ignored it and went about cleaning up the plates from Cas and Sam’s late breakfast.
“Have you finished with everything?” Cas asked him.
Sam’s eyes were constantly red ringed and puffy, though no one had actually managed to catch him in the act of crying. Pleading with the catatonic figure of his brother in a broken voice, yes, but crying, no.
—tonight?” she asked, pushing past him and walking into Dean’s house. “Because Sam sounded pretty worried.”
“I don’t think that stars are people, per say.”
Cas deflated with a sigh and dropped John to the floor. He turned around to face Dean who was finally free from the chair thanks to Charlie’s continued efforts.
didn’t even know half the stuff they were singing about.”
“I think that we did a lot of good,” Sam said softly. “I think we saved a lot of people.”
Sam ignored his last comment and got up to grab himself some of the leftover eggs and bacon.
Cas didn’t think that outer space was actually as colorful as he had painted it, but he had taken inspiration from the galaxy cupcakes that Dean always pinned to the pinterest he wouldn’t admit he had. Purples, blues, and pinks swirled through the air, streaks of gold glittering throughout as stars dusted the scene like sparkling sprinkles.
Cas cleared his throat as he turned to pretend to fiddle with a machine so that he could hide the deep red blossoming over his cheeks. “I’m clocking out in twenty, so you’ll have a new nurse for the night. I should warn you that Meg is a little rough around the edges. I would suggest not trying to flirt with her.”
“This is what I’m talking about, Cassie,” Gabe said, barely audible through his food. After another withering look from Cas, Gabriel managed to swallow the remainder of his food. “Your actual job is stressful enough. Why did you have to go and get yourself a real job and add to it?”
“Fine,” Sam said. “I won’t tell him.”
“Oh my god,” Dean said again. “How do all of our friends think that
Cas smiled and looked away from the stars to face his universe. “I know.”
“Castiel, Castiel,”
“Oh, it’s just a small thing,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Jeez, you been talkin’ to Cas?” he asked. “Because that guy wouldn’t know what a normal workday looked like if it bit him in the ass.”
“You realize I have heightened hearing, right?” Cas called.
Sam, upon seeing this, threw his hands up and let out a shout of frustration.
“Is it lame?” he asked her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean groaned. “Since when do you turn down a perfectly good blow job?”
“I dropped the knife, too.”
“Always, my love.”
“I love you,” Dean said with all the sincerity he could muster.
“Fuck that,” Dean said. “I’m at least stitching you up, come here, sit.” He pushed Cas down into the back of Sam’s car. “You got a first aid kit, Sammy?” he asked.
“Dean,” Mary admonished. “Stop scaring your brother.” She turned to Sam. “There’s no such thing as the monster in the woods. It’s just a stupid story made up by teenagers to scare their little brothers. You have nothing to worry about, sweetie.” She walked over and bent down to place a kiss atop his messy hair. “You’re going to have a great time today, promise.”
Cas gave him a penetrating look. “You should. The things you make now are delicious and they’re just regular flavors.”
They both turned to look at him in confusion.
“Shouldn’t we be listening to Cas’ favorite music since it’s his birthday?” Jo piped up from the backseat.
Dean grinned and felt a warmth spread through him just thinking of Cas. “Yeah, I can’t tell you enough how much I recommend marrying rich. Best thing I’ve ever done.”
Dean still eyed him suspiciously, but seemed to let it pass. Unfortunately, instead of picking up his drink again, he began to pile eggs and sausages onto his plate. The amount of food he had amassed made Sam scoff.
“I don’t appreciate being cast as the princess in this scenario you’ve got going,” Dean told her, falling into step next to her as they made their way to the gym along with fellow stragglers. Dean was a little embarrassed to see that the vast majority of people they were walking with were girls who had touched up their makeup. Oh god, he
“I’m sorry,” Cas said. “I didn’t see him until after.”
Dean said.
They both turned to look at Cas, but he just shrugged. “Gabriel doesn’t really care what I do as long as it doesn’t lead to teen pregnancy.”
“No, Dean. You can come with me or you can stay here, but I’m going.”
Castiel cast his eyes down and noticed that his entire front had been covered in flour. It must have happened when he had first tried opening the bag—how was he to know the powdery substance would puff out of the newly torn opening? Needless to say, it had surprised him into spilling nearly half of the bag down his front. Perhaps he should have worn one of the aprons that Dean had hanging on a hook near the pantry.
“Think we’re gunna get in trouble?” Dean asked, looking down at their still entwined hands.
Dean held up three fingers. “Scouts honor.”
Cas cleared his throat and looked back at his book. He could feel the heat of his blush rising to cover his entire face. “I—umm…”
Charlie’s face broke out into a huge smile and she stepped to the side, sweeping her hand out towards Dean. “Good luck,” she said. “Not that you’ll need it.”
“You okay there, Cas?” Sam asked.
“I’ll be right back,” Jess said, standing up. “I have to use the ladies room, excuse me.”
Cas sighed and followed at a much more sedate pace.
Dean sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. “I didn’t mean that.”
“No,” Sam said. “I mean like
“Why do people ever leave their houses?” Jo grouched, heading straight for the kitchen where she proceeded to open the fridge door and fan herself with it. “Why exactly are we going to the park today? It’s like the devil’s butthole out there.”
Dean immediately looked down at his pants. “My wha--?”
but he couldn’t do anything he was frozen, gasping for air.
"Sammy?" Dean said uncertainly.
But Dean just shrugged it off. “It’s cool. I actually did get the memo on that one.”
“Ghosts?” Bobby scoffed. “Boy, the scraps I throw you ain’t nothin’ and you know it.”
“Call me Dean.”
Dean groaned in frustration. “But he saw the monster, too! He told anyone who would listen that he saw the stupid thing like a week before Sammy and the others saw it! And Sam told you all of this yesterday and you didn’t believe him and now he’s gone, too!”
I want to give a huge shout out to my AMAZING artist
“I should’ve seen it,” Sam said. “I mean, we basically lived out of each other’s pockets. How could I not have seen it?”
“I lo…” Cas started, but found that the rest of his short statement got caught in his throat. This was much harder than he had anticipated. He should have given Sam much more credit for coming clean. Perhaps he should have even prepared himself in front of a mirror. “I,” he tried again, but that was even less successful than his first attempt.
Cas nodded, though he wanted to do nothing of the sort. He wanted to remain where they were to try and recreate whatever bubble they had created around themselves, let an actual thousand years pass them by.
Sam made the call. Dean refused to give up his number and subsequently have to change it. John agreed, and only yelled at Sam for a minute about lying to him about where he was going. Although, he did admit that he should have seen it coming.
Cas turned to look out the window, but he didn’t take his hand back from Dean, so he took that as a good sign.
acting like children. But you didn’t try very hard.”
“Until I have to get back in the car. I didn’t even realize how cramped they were. I’m not meant to hide them for so long. And now that our house is no longer a safe place—“
Dean slid to his knees in front of Cas and hesitantly reached his hands out, unsure of where he had been injured.
Cas frowned and perched himself on the couch next to Dean. “I was under the impression that you no longer found my presence agreeable.”
“Yeah, and I know what that’s code for. Wasn’t born yesterday, baby bro.” Gabe threw them a wink.
Then, what—uh—“ Dean cleared his throat and purposely lowered his voice. “What do you think the problem was?”
“Do you have Sam’s number?”
“How do you know that?” Jo asked.
His wrist finally free, Dean yanked the gag out of his mouth.
Cas nodded.
Cas brought a hand up and cupped Dean’s cheek. “Can you tell me what happened?”
Since Sam’s revelation seemed to go over well, Cas decided that he would try it out as well. At least this way he would know and the awkwardness would be minimal, since it would last a couple days at the most.
“Ugh, fine,” Dean said. “You’re such a baby, I swear.”
pathetic.”
“Just because it’s not a great plan doesn’t mean I’m not going to go through with it,” Sam said. “I’m still staying.”
“Cas,” she said in a tone that let him know she knew he was lying.
“I hope you realize neither of you will be leaving this place alive,” Cas growled, still pacing the perimeter.
“Thank you.”
“We should probably try and get out of this hole,” Dean finally said, looking around and assessing the situation. It was deeper than expected, but he was pretty sure he’d be able to crawl out with moderate ease.
“But how—“
“Yeah,” Dean said, “but I had the whole falling in love with you thing going on to help. I’d really prefer Bobby to keep his hands off.”
“If you keep this up I’m going to tell Vic your full name,” Dean threatened as he and Jo finally came to stand next to Cas and Charlie.
Cas loved his brother, truly, he did, but sometimes he wanted to strangle him. Gabe had pestered him most of his life to ‘be more normal’ and ‘get out more’ and now that Cas had finally taken his advice? Nothing but disapproval. Well, it was lucky that Cas couldn’t care less whether or not Gabe approved of his life choices because they were
“What happened in it?”
“You still staring at Dreamy McCreeperton over there?”
“Yes, but I’m the queen,” she said. “Besides, I’m not drowning in mine. You’ve got a good body, Winchester, show it off a little.”
(It’s the first time he sees Cas laugh out loud.)
Cas is off walking the perimeter—barefoot, because to this day he still kicks his shoes off at the first damned opportunity he gets, but still in his mage-armor, tasting the winds. It would be a hilarious sight, if he weren’t being such a brat. It’s one of Dean’s favorite visuals of Cas, normally—this powerful asshole with his big bare feet, curling his toes into the grass because he likes the feel of it.
Dean fumbles out a white phosphorus capsule with his jaw clenched so hard he can feel it throbbing up to his temples. With his fingers all muddy, though, it takes three tries before the chemicals catch and click together. It flares bright enough to make his eyes sting and water when he drops it on the faceless, melted sack of muscle and organ and empty face that, for just a second, looked like Cas.
(Dean could say this for sure, because Dean really

Dean’s hands gentled, both of them, after what seemed like the fiercest orgasm of Castiel’s entire life. The fingers inside him slid carefully out—oh, still strange, but not as strange as it had been—but Dean didn’t release Castiel’s cock, petting in gentle little slips that weren’t much more than a hold. Castiel panted. Sweat trickled hot down the side of his neck. It was absurd that he was

“I do not appreciate it,” Cas grumps at him, but he’s still got that cute, confused bird thing going on.
He still doesn’t know if he would have made any that are any different, even knowing what he does now. He doesn’t think that makes him a terrible being: only a father who thinks the best of his son.
Dean smiles. With all his teeth.
(He’s pretty sure Sam is Hannah’s favorite. Which, well. Fair.)
“Brother, take a load off, c’mon,” Benny says, sternly. “You’re down to bone.”
He’s looking exactly where he started, straight ahead at the remnants of what must’ve been some kind of a big meeting tent once upon a time, but it looks dried-up, almost wispy, like the sails of a ghost ship. There’s no wooden horse out to eat him.
, and Dean’s laid a hand on them, now.
It was peach-raspberry—his very favorite.
Dean stares at him. “Uh, dude, what else would I mean?”

Hannah says, “Hunters,” clearly. None of them are asleep the way they might ordinarily be at this time of the night, so they’re all awake when they gather round.
Maybe they’d both fallen, somehow.
Cas pressed his lips into the crevice he’d been lapping at, and
“Thank… you?” Castiel answered, confused; it just seemed like the right thing to say.
Watching demons fall wasn’t the same as seeing illustrations of it in a book. Because they didn’t…
Dean scratches the back of his head. It just figures that Cas isn’t a car guy. “Look, she’s a lady, man, I don’t want anyone laying a hand on her,” he complains. “If anyone scratches her ‘cause she doesn’t fit right in those teeny little parking spots, I don’t care how many stars they’ve got on their collar or whatever, I am going to
, he’s terrified.
And Dean, of all people, knows how hard it can be sometimes to just be nice to someone, rather than pretending they’re not there, that they don’t matter. Being a hunter is all about focusing on the things that other people don’t notice, things they brush off. Things that shouldn’t matter—but they do.
“Am I a lump now?” he asked quietly. “I… I guess I am. You always have to take care of me when it storms. Is that why you want me to leave?”
,” Dean blurted out, the words gushing from him.
When he bends in and kisses Cas, it’s a little too harsh; Dean’s riding a little too high and shaky to make it good. Cas tastes like sleeplessness and tears, his mouth a little sour and salty and a little gross. But Dean can’t get enough—there’s scruff under his hand and full plush lips he’s been dreaming of since the first time he ever dreamed about
There are all kinds of theories about why mage-grace manifests itself the way it does, especially in battle-mages—for some people it’s animals, for others it’s swords. For Naomi, it’s ice—Dean’s seen that firsthand more times than he wants to think about, since Naomi took a very
“Hey, Cas, you got your ears on?” Dean says into the silence.
Castiel has no idea what she means by that.
Dammit, he should’ve at least tried to teach someone else how to take it apart and clean out the insides, just in case…
“Hah!” Dean puffed his chest, grinning. He leaned back on his arms and swung his legs, heels of his sturdy work boots thumping against the rock face “Lucky, then, I get to have a really big-ass party.”
“That was really good,” Castiel sighed with pleasure, licking the last of the butter off his fingers.
But when Dean looks up, Sam is staring at them with his eyes rolled so high that the momentum of them should be lifting his hair.
“I didn't know that!” Sam's expression cleared a little. “Ms Rowena says people don't know as much about fire lizards as they should. I've never seen one. Is it true they listen to dragons, if the dragons tell them to do things?”
“Well, I don’t mind it, that’s for sure,” Dean answered with another bark of laughter. “And I figured, if you mentioned it just off the cuff like you did, had to be something you’d thought about at least
~to be continued~
He’s awake, but blinking, sleepy, like Dean turning over and grunting into his pillow, the way a guy just does when he’s got memory foam under him and no apocalypse in front of his face, was what woke him up.

For someone who couldn’t catch a joke if it were thrown at his head, Cas always knew the right thing to say. Dean breathes out, deep and shuddering. “Yeah. I know.” And… he does. He knows that. Cas keeps his promises. It was always Dean who never knew which ones to make. “I always could count on you.” He smiles, thinly. “You always were such a responsible sonofabitch.”

All of their other stuff is in a facility storage locker, now—or, well, anything he and Dad and Sam consider valuable is stashed in Baby’s trunk, none of them actually trust the government not to rifle through any junk they actually put in storage. They don’t need clothes: they’re gonna have uniforms. The boots are the most comfortable things that Dean’s ever put on his feet, and he fucking loves the steel toes on them. There might be things on the other side that can’t be taken out by good old-fashioned salt and silver, but they’ve got their angel blades for that—though Dean’s pretty sure Jo’s going to be bringing a lucky switchblade anyway, and nothing’s going to make Rufus leave behind his lucky machete.

Castiel thinks about that into the evening, long after he and Charlie have finished discussing whether he wants to do a magazine interview, and the renewal of his publication contract. He thinks about it as the sunlight coming through his living room blinds starts to dim—the days are getting shorter. He thinks of it as he shuffles through his takeout menus again, realizing that he doesn’t actually

Dean arches his eyebrows. Oh, this is going to be good.

Dean doesn’t ask what Castiel’s doing here, and Castiel doesn’t offer—not least because he doesn’t know the answer. They finish off their beers in a strangely comfortable silence, watching the rest of a truly terrible episode of some torrid romance thinly veiled in the white coat of a medical drama.
“He considered it a reason to threaten to beat you and cut you off from

He knows this is foolishness. He is well-aware that he’s as likely to get shot as he is to walk away from this. Dean has no reason to go easy on him, any more than the FBI, really, has any reason to go easy on Dean.
“You need a beer for this talk, and I need whiskey,” Dean announces, pulling their son to his feet with a rough pat of his shoulder.
“I thought we were going to do this together,” Castiel heard himself say before he could bite it back. This wasn’t about

The only times he doesn’t when they’re out of the Magisterium citadel are when they’ve got to be out on the road during Stormdark. Dean’s… never wanted to think too hard about what that means, honestly. Because yeah: Cas was like that even when they were kids.

But their dad doesn’t look at either of them, in the rearview or otherwise. He keeps tapping his fingertips lightly on the steering. “Marshall Space Flight Center,” he says. “Joint Task Force is asking for some know-how.” He says that in a calm, even tone, like the combined might of NASA and the military calling him on his cellphone is just something that happens these days.
“Cas,” Dean said softly. “Hey, you can stay and watch. Seriously, man, it’s fine! I’m good.”
Castiel actually did believe that. Surprisingly, it quieted down the little fire lizards trying to scrape firestone off the lining of his stomach. But still, he raised one eyebrow. And when Dean just stared back at him, his green eyes fierce under the fringe of his light brown hair, he raised the other one.
From sucking Dean’s cock.

“I’ll get the star chart!” Elliot says, almost tripping over his long legs as he pushes out his chair.

It was like a shitball to the face after a few already shitty hours when Sam’s face went pale. “You couldn’t get enough?” He sounded so scared. He looked down at the pile at Dean’s feet like he was just realizing that that was all that there was.

Castiel frowned and sat back. Hadn’t he made himself clear? “What if I

, as a child should be, rather than having to care for someone else. He wonders if the man gave a damn. He wonders, uncharitably, if the reason John retrieved Dean at all was so that someone else would have the care and feeding of Sam again while he went tilting at more windmills.
The next time he saw Dean, it was at the stables. He was facing away from Castiel, arguing about something with Bobby. He was grinning and gesturing with both his arms, because Dean—for all that he claimed to have no use for school—loved stories and songs more than just about anyone.

It might have just been a check-in—might have just been Cas saying his name purely for the pleasure of it. Cas didn’t need to be careful with him, but sometimes Cas was for his
Castiel didn’t argue with the ‘least offensive’ part of that—Michael had called him far worse growing up.
Some things are still easy.
It’s when one of them falls on the other and starts chewing  right through the screams that they realize just how bad it is. That’s when they realize that they had no goddamned idea.
“C’mon, Cas,” he complains, sleepily, toeing the cover sheet up and over his waist. “The book’s still gonna be there for you to read tomorrow.”
Dean doesn’t even bother to tell Cas just how much of that pie is going to end up all over her. Either he knows, or he’s fooling himself. It’s also Cas’s turn to do laundry, anyway.
. He spaced out for hours thinking about something so hard that he forgot where he was or what he was supposed to be doing (or to wait for a green light before he crossed the street). He spent hours reading the news and then wrecked his knuckles on a punching bag because he was so angry about the things that they would never be able to change. His insomnia was worse than either Dean’s or Sam’s—and that was really fucking saying something.
So maybe it wasn’t so unusual that Dean didn’t notice that he wasn’t

Three times.
The kid’s wrapped in a dark green blanket that looks like it weighs more than she does, and has thick dark hair that looks like she licked a light socket. She can’t be more than a few weeks old, but what the hell does Dean know? Her skin is so fine and thin he can see the veins under her eyelids.
And he had to acknowledge that Dean was, indeed, right: morning sex
Yeah, attaboy, Sammy.
But when Cas meets his eyes, his eyes are so blue even in the lowlights of the garage, and still so serious. There’s no laughter in them. “Do you have your keys? We could relocate her to my spot, since you’re going to be… away, for a while,” he offers. “I don’t mind having my car in regular parking. It’s also big, but it really won’t matter if it gets scratched. It’s probably almost as old as your Impala, here.”
But his shoulder beats and beats. It hurts, but it hurts the way Dean’s side gets a stitch in it when he’s running, or the flutter inside his ribs after a monster’s dead at his feet. It’s the painful beat of survival.
. And guess what? Dean fucking
. Dean’s carried it, the memories of it, with him for so long. He can’t believe he’s leaving it behind, finally, with its rightful owner. He should feel lighter without it, but instead, he just feels naked.
“What?” he says. “But…”
“Some equipment. These are not yours to keep,” Novak reminds them, with a pointed glance at Jo—Sam chuckles—”and they can’t leave the training room for now. But you’ll be able to practice with them a little before you take them with you through the Gate.”
But paying attention to Cas had never exactly been Dean’s goddamned problem. Never. What he did with it, though, that was another story.

“He’s, um, Cas—I, uh, Castiel’s my classmate—” Jesus Christ, why is Dean tripping all over the end of his tongue? Why the fuck does he suddenly feel
“Yeah,” Dean agrees softly. The little pit in his stomach unknots itself a little bit. It’s hard to feel down when Cas sounds so excited. He should be. “Kevin’s a really smart kid.”
He doesn’t know what to ask. He doesn’t know where to even
“John Winchester. You were a Marine,” General Novak says, over the look on Adler’s face. It’s the first thing she’s said. She’s in a full navy blue uniform, too, with gold braid on her shoulders and a tie around her neck, but her voice is so cool and low Dean’s not sure sweat would dare to bead up on her face. Her eyes are electric and hard. “In ‘Nam. And rather than a hand-picked team of elite soldiers, you’d rather take…” there’s a long pause, “them.”
But when Dean looks up, Cas is watching him hopefully. “You’re always nice,” he says warmly. “That’s obvious from the fact that you were even willing to call me back and give me a second chance, even thinking that I was, well… springing an atypical relationship on you,” A shy little dimple peeks out of the corner of full pink lips that Dean’s only just barely had a taste of. “I’ve known you were kind since you helped after my car broke down, though.”

“Did you see Bart this morning?” Patty’s whispering to Chris as Dean walks up to his locker, hugging her fancy zippered three-ring binder to her chest. “He’s on a crutch and has a sling around his arm!”
There’s a weird freedom in that. (Dean’s aware that there might be something a little fucked-up about it, too. But that doesn’t make it any less

Castiel knew the rules, once. He was good with the rules. He knows that they matter. Or they did, once upon a time. He thought he could make a difference, once.
“Dean,” Cas hissed as soon as the door was closed.
“He won’t,” Dean cut him off.
Dean held it out, so Cas put his hand out to take it.
Dean looked around and spotted Cas and Charlie across the way. Charlie had her hands on Cas’ shoulders, obviously trying to get him to dance along. Dean grinned and led Jo through the crowd of girls dancing and singing along.
“Dean, I know you secretly like the Spice Girls—“
“I already did it,” Dean told her flatly. “Yesterday.”
Here is my 2016 DCBB! I just want to give a shout out to my awesome betas,
“I think this makes four times this week,” Charlie said in lieu of a greeting.
“Yeah, man,” Dean said, pulling a little black switch out of what seemed like thin air. “Look.” He flipped the switch and the little beads strung around the violently green tree lit up in bright blue, yellow and orange. “Awesome, right?” He looked up at Sam expectantly, excitement radiating from his lopsided smile.
, do this one thing for me. Just let me live my life.”
“Hey, I’m pretty sure those extra lyrics were all your brother. I don’t even think Sam knew half of what they were singing about.” His cheeks turned pink. “
Dean rolled his eyes. “They were betting on whether or not we were going to get together.”
“And how did I react yesterday?”
“Mess?” Dean scoffed. “Now who’s being dramatic? It’s a hickey. It’s expected of us. We’re teenagers.”
Jess set her jaw. “Is there a reservation for a Dean and Cas?” she asked, throwing all her cards on the table and praying, actually praying, that the universe would come through just this once.
Dean grunted in response and squeezed Cas’ hand. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “’M fine.”
“Pestering?”
“Thank you, Cas,” Mary said with a radiant smile.
“Then where is he?” Dean demanded.
Cas could feel tears blurring his vision and he told himself it was from the contrast of the golden vial to the darkness of the night around them, though it was a lie. Inside the vial were dozens of glowing, golden sparks, flying around, bouncing into the glass and off of each other. “Dean,” Cas breathed softly.
Cas furrowed his brow. “So am I.”
all the time with him,” Sam protested.
“Forget it,” Dean said, once he regained enough senses for his flight reaction to kick in. “You—uh—you do what you gotta do, Cas.” He took a few stumbling steps backwards before he turned and fled to his room.
“Please, Gabe,” Dean said, and yup, he was definitely crying now.
“You totally lied about not understanding this game,” Sam accused.
“This is a good thing, though, right?” Jess said after a small pause. “This is what you want?”
“Thank you,” she said like she was desperate for the caffeine and hurried over to the counter where Dean was placing the lid on one of their to-go cups and sliding it across the counter.
“I can’t, Cas,” Dean said. “What if they changed their mind? I mean, I haven’t talked to Sam since he agreed to come. What if he decided that he was happier without me? What if—“
“Nu-uh,” Dean replied, keeping a tight grip on his squirming brother. “You gotta say it first!”
“Oh yes, because not only do I want to wear a button down shirt in triple digit weather, it won’t be conspicuous at all.” Cas rolled his eyes and sank back into the couch cushions in defeat.
He was tired, but he knew he still had a while to go.
“It’s been a long night,” Mary said. “I think you might feel differently about this after you’ve rested.
“So, uh, Cas?” Dean said, taking a couple quick steps to be level with him.
Mary sighed and rounded on her eldest son. “You see what all of your teasing has done, Dean?”
“Stop that,” Cas said, swatting Dean’s hand away. “I like it. Besides, we get workouts in.”
Dean rolled his eyes in exasperation. “He’s not going to kill dad,” Dean added. “Cas, tell him you’re not going to kill our dad so he wipes that stupid look off of his face.”
The other three rolled their eyes in unison.”
Three hideable and one obvious hickey later, they broke apart.
“Have you packed like I asked you?”
Dean swore and pulled Cas away. Sam heard him swearing all the way down the hall.
“Get him enough taffy and I’ve found that can buy up to two hours of relative silence.”
“What? Why would he do that?”
Dean crossed his arms tightly over his chest. “Well, I mean, yeah” he admitted, “but you always get hungry like two hours before dinner and come to scrounge in the kitchen. I was getting worried.”
Sam followed Dean out of the kitchen, also apparently done with his breakfast even though he’d only eaten half.
“How do you think I felt?” he asked, hurt lacing every syllable. “Excited to finally find my mate after so long of having given up hope only to have him reject me?”
“Don’t worry, Cassie,” Gabe said, walking over to ruffle his hair. “I trust you to keep Dean in check.”
“What? Real?” Dean turned to Cas. “Seriously?”
Cas gave him a little shove before knocking on Sam’s door. “Sam?” he called. “Your mom sent us to get you for dinner.”
Cas just shrugged and placed the lid on the box.
“Yes,” Cas replied simply and with a smile.
“Nah,” Dean said, looking for a spot to fit the ground beef they bought. “I think owning one restaurant is enough.”
“Who is Dr. Rose?” Cas asked.
Originally, Cas had thought that it would be easy. Balthazar had always been able to read him like a book and he had a very difficult time lying to him about his feelings. Lying to him about facts was a piece of cake, but somehow his cousin knew every time he so much as glanced in another’s direction. So really, this should have been simple. He knew he was in love with Dean, had been for quite some time now and had already resigned himself to the fact that his feelings wouldn’t be reciprocated, so he thought yes, perfect, Balthazar would never suspect. He’d be able to see that Cas was smitten and simply lie about the fact that their relationship wasn’t romantic in nature. He did, however, forget to factor in one tiny little thing—Dean was a little shit.
“Flying should be instinctual,” Cas said, turning to face Dean who Cas could now see had his eyes squeezed shut. Cas couldn’t help but to let out a chuckle. “Dean,” he said, giving his boyfriend a nudge.
“Still eating,” Dean said. “I gotta go see Bobby.” He began walking and then turned back quickly. “Oh, I told him I’m meeting Bobby for family stuff, so make something up if he asks.”
“Perhaps you should go and talk to him,” Cas suggested.
look.”
“I think it might be fun.”
Cas sighed. “Dean, out of the two years we’ve been together, what have I ever said or done to make you think I’d give in to your ridiculous request now?”
Dean got a call from Bobby just as their food arrived.
“It’s barely seven o’clock, Dean,” Mary said with a smile. She let the silence drag on for a few moments as Dean stared like a deer in headlights. “You don’t have to tell me anything,” she finally laughed. “I’m just glad you two had a good time.”
“Gross boyfriends, still sticking together in these trying times,” Charlie said with an eyeroll.
“Great, because Cas bought you one, too,” Dean said.
Quick as a flash, John dropped the gun he was holding and brought out a knife. Dean threw up an arm to deflect the blow and felt the blade slice through the meat on his forearm. Cas let out a snarl of fury behind him that drowned out his own grunt of pain and the next thing Dean knew he was being hauled back and saw Cas, wings bursting from his back, jump forward onto John.
The ride back home seemed to take forever, but when he finally pulled into the paved driveway Cas was sitting on the porch waiting for him. Dean collapsed into his arms when they met halfway.
And speaking of the star, was it getting… brighter? And bigger? And coming right at him?
“Shit,” Jess said, torn between impressed and terrified. “I mean, is your dad okay?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Come on, Cas, give me some credit.” He walked around to the trunk and opened it up. There was a cooler and three large beach bags. Cas could see his own swim trunks folded neatly on top of the bag in the middle.
“Pie’s probably cool enough to eat now,” Cas said.
No one was there.
Sam slumped, defeated. “How is he always so freaking hungry?” he mumbled while stomping from the room. He picked his bag up where he had left it by the door and ignored Bobby’s admonishment for kicking his door open. He’d feel bad about it later, but right now he had too many emotions vying for top spot and it was making him irritable.
“Uh, Cas,” Jo piped up. “I think Meg is talking about a date.”
Dean had decided on Spaghetti Bolognese, since Charlie called that morning requesting it. Well, he says requested. It was more like she called, insulted his taste in fictional men, and then demanded the dish because, “Dude, the last time you made that I think I went a little straight for you.”
“You did?”
Dean’s eyes widened in horror. “Oh god.”
Cas nodded his agreement and they finally broke apart, Dean making sure to take Cas’ hand as they weaved through the raucous groups of preteens and barely teens.
“What do you mean, ‘no’?” Sam demanded. “That’s my brother. I have a right to see him.”
Cas narrowed his eyes in a squint and turned to look at Dean. Dean had made them watch the movie in question two weeks prior. Perhaps this had been the point all along? “I don’t know what you mean. I’m not living the same day. If anything, you are the one living the same day over and over.”
“Your letterman jacket?” Cas asked, stunned. No one got to wear Dean Winchester’s letterman jacket. Not even Lisa Braeden who Dean had dated all of sophomore and well into junior year. Cas had only been seeing him for about a month now—he wasn’t even sure they were technically official yet.
“Wait, what?” Dean asked, looking up to see the look of pure evil glee on his best friend’s face. “Charlie…” he warned as she stood up.
“Did you have a good birthday, Cas?” Dean asked him, a crooked smile on his face. His cheeks had gotten sunburnt, but mostly he’d just gotten more freckles.
Bobby and Sam remained at the table long after Dean and Cas had left under the pretense of showing Cas around the junkyard, which Sam thought was a pretty flimsy excuse for fooling around in a junker. But hey, as long as he didn’t have to hear anything, he was happy. He’d made the mistake of showing up a little too early to meet Dean and Cas for lunch one day and was met with sounds that still haunted him at night. (Seriously, though, who actually
He heard a grunt over the line. “Not all of us can have rich husbands that let us quit out day job.”
“Stay out of this, Sammy,” Dean warned loudly.
. Did vultures even have teeth?
“You won’t, Dean,” Cas told him. “We’re going upstairs. You won’t see him at all, I promise. I won’t let anything happen to you.”
He claimed he was “going the extra mile” with the teasing and flirting and the wandering hands (oh god, the wandering hands—half of Cas’ time was now spent trying not to pop an awkward boner in public), and in all honesty he was selling the lie better than he could have hoped.
By half past ten they were in Dean’s car. Dean had toyed with the idea of blindfolding him, but Charlie talked him out of it, thank goodness. Cas didn’t know how long it would take to get wherever they were going. All he knew is that Meg and Hannah were meeting them there.
Cas glared at him. “I thought he wasn’t ‘
A silence settled between them long enough for Dean to think Sam had heeded his word.
Dean’s heart was racing. He couldn’t quite believe that this was real, that he was allowed to do this, to have Cas this close. He couldn’t remember ever feeling this good.
They all said their goodbyes and left Dean and Cas alone in their house. The two of them retired to their bedroom where they stripped down to their boxers and cuddled up under the covers.
“Oh my god,” Dean groaned from the driver’s seat of the impala. “What is taking Sam so long?”
“Well, I won’t argue with that,” Bobby admitted.
Mary snorted. “Yeah, but shouldn’t you be trying to make a good impression on Cas?” She lowered her voice to a whisper, “We want to make sure he sticks around.”
Cas pressed a kiss to his hair. “I just want you to be happy, my love.”
“I didn’t tell her,” Cas said.
"What's got your panties in a twist?"
But Dean ignored him. “Cas, please,” Dean said. “Please wake up. I need you.” He put a shaking hand on Cas’ cheek. It was still warm, but that might just be the pervasive summer heat. He slid his hand lower until two of his fingers rested on Cas’ pulse point in his throat and held his breath as he waited… and waited… and
“Lafitte’s?” Jess asked. “Fine dining doesn’t really seem like your brother’s M.O. from what you’ve told me. Maybe he’s trying to make an effort.”
Dean groaned as he turned back again. “What? I’m kind of in a hurry.”
Sam sighed, but knew the conversation was over. “At least stop ignoring Cas,” he told him and with that he left.
Dean snorted. “Come on, Cas. Give my mom and Gabe a break. It’s sort of Parenting one-oh-one to not let their kids be alone with the people they’re dating. And it’s Kids one-oh-one to work around it.” He slid his arms around Cas’ shoulders and gave his best flirty grin.
The sounds of the woods were wiped out and the thing opened its mouth and spoke to them.
“It’s not a Christmas tradition,” Cas admitted, “but Dean assured me that a prank war was Winchester tradition.”
A rather awkward silence followed, but it was one nearly bursting with potential.
He already had everything set up perfectly so he just waited patiently for his brother to arrive at the Gryffindor table. It didn’t take long.
“There’s power, Castiel.”
“Please, man,” Dean begged. “Sammy’s spending the night with a friend and I don’t think that I can handle a night alone with my dad.”
“Oh, you wound me, Cassie,” Balthazar replied, feigning hurt with a hand over his heart.
Mary nodded. “So what are you two doing tomorrow then?”
Cas didn’t continue, figuring Sam got the idea, and instead wrapped an arm around Dean’s shoulders and led him up the stairs and to the room they were staying in. He sat Dean down on the bed.
“Besides,” Cas continued. “That’s not the real one anyway.”
“But what?” Dean demanded, unable to go even a second without hearing the next part of that sentence.
“What?” Dean said. “You can’t imagine that I could actually find someone who loves me? Cas has to be a siren because there’s no way someone like me could ever actually find happiness. That’s what you think, right?”
“Sam,” Bobby cut in before Sam could protest again. “Go home. Don’t get dragged into your daddy’s mess again.”
are being overprotective it’s okay, but when I try it’s a travesty against nature just because of what I am.”
“You can’t blame me for that, Dean,” Sam said, “I had to get out. Dad was driving me insane! I didn’t want to be in the family business, alright? I’m so sorry that my plans for
“You were raised a hunter,” Cas shrugged. “I get it.”
Dean laughed. “Fell for the guy, stayed for the s’mores?”
“And why do you think that?” the male detective asked, making a note in his little notepad without taking his eyes from Dean. It didn’t seem like he was trying to be mean, Dean was sure he was just doing his job, but the question still made him set his jaw into a defiant frown.
Sam just shrugged. “Sounds good,” he said, making his way out of the car, shivering slightly at the breeze that had kicked up. He was almost appreciating the warm glow of the lights on his sweater. Almost.
.” Sam smirked as he skipped along beside Dean.
A breeze picked up and Cas knew that his adversary was getting ready for his next strike. Putting some power behind the thought, Cas healed the wound in his side, a bright blue-white light sealing it over without even leaving a scar.
“He is,” Dean stated, a little too vehemently to land the lie.
Cas watched her go and stood up as well. “If you will excuse me as well, I just remembered that I have to discuss something with Benny.”
Dean’s scowl turned into a wicked grin. “You bet, sweetheart.”
Cas forced a small smile onto his face. “My love,” he said gently, preparing himself to crush Dean’s manic façade, but at the pleading look in his eye he relented. With a sigh, he asked, “Would you like to pick an island, or would you like to do it together?”
Sam just nodded dumbly. “Hey.”
Cas smiled at him and took a sip of his drink.
“Then what were you two doing in there for so long
“Dean,” he said in his gravelly voice, harsher than usual from its disuse. It was the first word he had spoken in a week.
Dean snorted. “No. He saw me and came over and gave me a hug and then I sort of, maybe ran away. Oh god,” he said. “I left the groceries there. Fuck.”
Cas turned to Dean. “I apologize for my Neanderthal of a brother.”
“Ain’t that the truth,” he muttered.
“Are Charlie and Jo here yet?” Cas asked, looking around as if he might have just missed them. He seated himself on one side of the aging wooden table, making a face when his leg came in contact with a spider web.
“Fifty,” Dean repeated with awe. “Fifty first loves, huh?”
Sam sighed. “Okay, you’re right. Let’s go in.” He remained immobile.
“No,” Dean said. “It’s not that, it’s just…” He sighed. “I saw… Sammy was at the grocery store.”
Dean craned his neck back to see his boyfriend who was standing just behind the arm of the couch where he was resting his head. He cracked a smile, “Can you hand me the remote?”
“Alright, fine,” Charlie huffed. “I suppose that is what a good hostess and gracious winner would do. Sam and Cas can go first while Dean helps me grab some snacks for the poor losers to munch on.”
Dean sighed and leaned forward to rest his head against their clasped hands.
“So now we… hug?” Cas asked, head slightly tilted as he squinted at the other couples around them.
Cas ran his hands over the deep blue comforter on either side of him. “I don’t want to presume anything. I fear my own desires are clouding my judgment.”
“I don’t—I was sleeping. I don’t know why I’m here.” He was shaking.
Cas pushed his way past Gabriel. “You say that to me every morning.”
“Speaking of,” Cas said. “Did you really want to go to Benny’s tonight, or was that just another excuse?”
Dean just shrugged. “If I call him it’ll be too easy to hang up. I’m getting this settled.”
Charlie just grinned. “You should ask him out.”
“Did you ever get the dog?”
“Did you check out my ass, Novak?” Dean asked, the smirk Cas was refusing to look at obvious in his tone.
“Hm,” the man said, absolutely oozing cheeriness. “The name doesn’t sound familiar. Let me check.”
“Hey, Dean?” Sam called, bursting into his room. “Where do you keep the—OH GOD!”
“I know, babe,” Dean replied softly. “I just don’t want to deal with any of this. I want to go back to our life.”
“You ever think I need to know as much about your Bond as possible to help you?”
Most people were dancing or playing games, so they didn’t have a problem finding seats at the tables set up near the pizza station. Dean scooted his chair closer once they had sat, finding that once he had tasted close proximity with Cas he never wanted to let it go. The dance ended with them still sequestered in their own private world, huddled together, whispering and laughing.
“Well,” Sam replied. “Seeing how I brought our dad back into his life, I wouldn’t bet on that at the moment.”
“Cas, you are not killing my dad,” Dean told him in a bored voice.
“Real mature, Dean.” Sam gave him a bitchface as he sat down across from him at the Gryffindor table. His blue tie stood out among the sea of red and gold, but his bright pink hair stood out more. “What did you do to my shampoo?”
“My knife!” Jo said.
“You’re so boring, Castiel.”
“Dean,” Cas cut him off. “It’s not stupid. I’ve just never really thought about it before and it deserves a well thought out answer.”
Balthazar threw back his head and laughed while Cas’ turned an alarming shade of red.
Dean nodded again, too scared to open his mouth in case something other than words escaped.
“Apologies, Sam,” Cas said into the phone. "Your brother is being ridiculous. Is your father still there?” A short pause as he danced out of Dean’s reach. “Will you be able to meet us without him following you?” A longer pause. “Okay, good. We’ll meet you at our house in an hour.” He threw the phone back to Dean after he ended the call.
of you, it kind of makes it a little easier to smile in the morning.”
“Maybe forty. Hell, Sammy, I don’t know. A long ass time.” Dean sighed, a happy and content little noise and closed his eyes. “Probably forever.”
“No, hey,” Dean said, trying to angle himself in such a way that Cas would have to make eye contact again, but though they were still closely dancing that just seemed to make it easier for Cas to keep his face turned away. “What do you mean?”
“It was my pleasure, Dean.”
“Thanks for the number, Charlie,” he said, going back into his office.
“And you’re okay with that?”
“He’s still the same guy, Bobby,” Dean told him. “He just… has wings.”
“I was not making a euphemism, Dean,” he managed to squeeze out between his laughs. “You—“ he pointed behind them, “you set the class on fire.”
Dean stayed behind for a minute to cut some chunks of parmesan cheese to grate over their meals when the doorbell rang.
sorry that I broke his arm, though.”
“I am when you’re not being ridiculous,” Cas said. “Besides, you were planning on a ‘detour,’ weren’t you?”
Dean smiled. “Hungry?” he teased.
Dean shrugged like it was nothing, but Cas could feel his relief like it was palpable. “Yeah, you’re welcome, buddy.”
“What?” Dean spluttered. “I am
Cas sat down for third period with his newly returned biology book. He and Dean hadn’t managed to talk during break since Dean had forgotten his math homework at home and had to hurriedly scribble down as much as he could copy off of Cas’. Usually, Cas wasn’t one for cheating, but he figured this didn’t really count since Dean actually had done the homework.
Dean just grinned. “I ate when I woke up. You know, at a normal hour.”
Sam and Dean laughed, while Jess and Cas shared a slightly horrified look.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean smiled when his boyfriend opened the door. He leaned in and gave him a peck.
“There’s always a hunter in this house,” Cas replied with an eye roll. “Now what would you like me to do? Shoo or stall?”
Dean’s jaw dropped open. “What?”
“Hello, Dean speaking,” he said, balancing his phone between his cheek and his shoulder.
Cas calmly turned to Dean. “Sam has enrolled in the community college here.”
“I sort of promised Bobby we would visit him this weekend,” he said quickly, flinching away in preparation for Cas’ reaction.
He eventually accepted. And now he and Jess were back in their bungalow, sleeping off the huge meal Dean had cooked for dinner.
“Thank you for sharing this with me, Dean,” Cas said softly, relaxing further into Dean.
“Did you finally try out that new recipe?”
“Yeah?” Dean asked, still keeping his eyes glued to the same spot on his jeans.
“Would that be so bad?” Cas asked.
“Which I still think is going too far,” Cas interjected, but Dean ignored him.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Come on” she pleaded. “I know you asked us to come to the park later so you could ask him. Did he say yes?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ew, what?” Charlie exclaimed. “No way he said yes.”
“It was Dean’s idea,” Cas continued. “At first he considered being the head chef himself, but then I suspect he realized how much work it would be and found Benny.”
“Yes,” Cas added. “Dean gets cranky when he’s tired.”
“My girlfriend,” Sam replied. Then he tossed him the ruler he had finally found which clattered to the floor since John didn’t have a spare hand to catch it. “I forgot that I promised I’d meet her for lunch.”
The line of his mother’s mouth turned downwards, obviously annoyed at her son’s taste in food (and what she referred to as ‘culture’).
“Yeah, well. I need to do something before I snap.” He let out a frustrated groan. “I mean, if Sam asks me one more time why I don’t want dad to know where I am, I might kill him.”
“Nice,” Dean said as he looked them over with a grin that Cas loved.
“Can we sit?” John asked, gesturing to some seats lining the tan wall.
“What?” Dean asked.
Dean grabbed the large pot of pasta and made it to the dining room just as Cas opened the door to greet their other guests.
“Tonight?” Cas almost exclaimed.
“What?
“Of course,” Cas replied solemnly.
Jo, Charlie, and the teen girl, Lily, ran ahead to call for help as the others made their way out of the forest in varying states of distress. Ava was still crying, silently now, holding tightly onto Jake’s hand. Andy and Ansem walked so closely together that they looked like they were attached at the hip and Sam was practically hanging from Dean’s back where he had a grip on his shirt so tight that Dean was sure there’d be no salvaging it from being stretched out.
"Of course, sweetheart," she said and ruffled his hair.
“My little brother the optimist.” Gabriel rolled his eyes.
Cas merely smiled to himself as he took another bite.
“Yeah, but it’s the worst one there.”
“It’s my decision.”
Dean wanted to protest—surely a man with galaxies in his eyes was more than human—but when he took in a deep breath to try and get the words out a sharp pain rang out through his chest and everything was lost in a groan.
“Do you…” He trailed off and began picking at the blades of grass beneath his fingers. Cas moved his hand the inch or so over so that their pinkies would brush together. It calmed Dean’s fidgeting and he took a deep breath and continued, “Do you think that stars are, like… people?”
“Oh, so accidents do happen,” Cas said. “From the way you’ve been acting you’d think I was just incompetent.”
Gabe let out a low whistle. “You sure know how to pick ‘em, Cassie.”
“Oh my god,” Sam groaned from the back of the room while the rest of the classroom erupted into wolf whistles and raucous laughter. “Not more kinky pet names.”
Dean cursed loudly and swerved over onto the side of the road. “Are you fucking kidding me?” he demanded, trying to grab the phone back from Cas who dodged his attempts easily. “Dammit, Cas, hang up the phone!”
“I know, and I’m looking forward to it,” Dean said. “But you’re still hurting.”
“True,” Dean said. “But it’s also your birthday, on a Saturday, so wake up quick. We’ve got plans.”
Cas let out an explosive sigh and crossed his arm tightly across his chest.
“I was just trying to help,” he said.
It would have worked if the banging on the door didn’t continue with Sam’s continued shouting, “Come on, man! Just open the door! I just want to talk!”
“That kid does not know how to leave well enough alone, does he?” Dean flexed his fingers on the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the strain.
“It was a friend of a friend,” Dean muttered.
“You called,” John replied.
John narrowed his eyes. “Don’t give me that crap,” he said. “You kidnapped my son.”
“Why didn’t you say something?” Dean asked. “Why didn’t
Dean ran a hand through the back of his hair and let out one last laugh. “Guess not. Maybe we can just wait for a slow song. All you’ve gotta do to those is just, like, sort of hug and sway to the music.”
Cas sighed. “He said he wasn’t feeling good anymore.”
Cas could feel Dean’s mood lift.
“Goodbye, Gabriel,” Cas called, not turning around.
“Hate to break it to you, Cas,” Jo said, giving him a pat on the shoulder, “but you’ve never acted normally.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Bet you he won’t get in trouble for being late,” he told Cas, jerking a thumb over his shoulder towards Sam as they left his room.
“Get ready for this Liz Lemon eye roll,” Charlie said, and then with the utmost exaggeration, she rolled her eyes. “Go ask him out, dummy.”
“Be careful what you wish for,” Charlie told him. “She’d swat you down.”
Castiel Novak, was walking over towards them, his cowboy boots making soft thunks on the floor.
“Hey—hey, shh!” Dean clapped a hand over Cas’ mouth. “That’s the most inappropriate! This is a
that lined Dean’s yard.
A hand on his chin prompted him to look up at Cas who’s blue eyes were boring into him. “I forgive you,” he said. “And I’m sorry as well.”
“Yeah,
“Talking,” Jo answered. “We’ve found the best way to actually have a conversation now is to keep you and Cas apart. Otherwise things go downhill pretty fast.”
Another kiss and then Cas was up and across the room, picking up the crutches and bringing them back over. “Let’s go make you a pie,” he said, holding his hand out to help Dean up.
The story they told everyone about how they met went a little something like this:
“Long story,” Dean laughed. “Do you think I could borrow your bio book? I left mine at home and Ms. Harvelle is scary when she’s mad.”
“Charlie,” Gilda said, tugging on her shirt. “Maybe we should go. This sort of seems like a family thing.”
“This has got to be real,” Dean whispered as they lay their foreheads together. “I never would have dreamed up something that cheesy.”
“I never should have even told you about him.”
“Well it turns out it wasn’t as many as he led me to believe.”
“But after?” Sam asked.
Dean went over and sat down in one of the chairs, crossing his arms over his chest.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Gee, thanks Dean."
Cas rolled his eyes even though there was a pink tinge to his cheeks. “I’m a dragon.”
“Dean, wait,” John said, managing to push Sam to the side and going to grab Dean’s arm as he was turning to leave. Cas stopped his hand before it reached Dean and with a sickening crack John screamed.
“Come on, man,” Sam said. “You won’t even look at him anymore. He thinks you blame him for what happened.”
“It could have been worse,” Cas told him. “I believe he was trying to reign himself in, in deference to your brother.”
Sam quickly tried to erase whatever emotion had flitted across his face. “Like what?”
“Sorry, Bobby,” Dean said. “We stopped to grab something to eat on the way.”
“Charlie was the problem?”
John turned to Sam. “This thing got its claws in you, too, huh? You knew about him all along and you just let him have your brother?”
Charlie stuck her head between their seats. “North on the interstate.”
His groan was cut off by Cas’ lips.
Dean grinned as Cas walked in and sat in front of him on the desk. “Have I told you lately how awesome you are?” he asked, taking a proffered bag and opening it up, getting a whiff of meat grilled to perfection.
Cas glared at the red stick of licorice. “What’s the difference between movie candy and regular candy?” he asked, taking it from Dean and letting it hover in front of his mouth as he waited for Dean’s answer.
“Did you just use the term ‘sweet’ and ‘VW bug’ in the same sentence?”
“Oh, uh… yeah,” Dean tucked his head into Cas’ shoulder so he didn’t have to look at him.
“Bitch,” Dean said.
“At least we didn’t have to suffer through another discussion of who’s the hottest in Star Trek, right?” Gilda replied.
Dean shook his head with a fond smile. “I’m not up to making your lazy ass anything, want to order in?”
Sam’s jaw dropped while Dean put his head in his hands.
“Well, then there you go. I can’t be lonely if I’m talking to you.”
Cas just kissed him again.
“I can be very persuasive,” Cas said with a smirk.
. But Cas, this
There was a soft knock at the doorway and Dean’s eyes snapped open and over to the source.
“You better hope I don’t take that into consideration,” Dean replied, walking over to stand behind her so that he could peer at the computer over her shoulder. “What do we have today?”
Jo rolled her eyes. “The whole town, dummy. About why those lame ass high schoolers ran away?”
Dean smirked. “I knew that truce wasn’t real,” he said. “I can read you like a book, Sammy.”
Cas’ eardrums were throbbing by the time they got back to their apartment, but it was nothing to how his heart felt. He should have tried to convince Balthazar to move here while he had the chance. Would Dean have allowed them to keep the ruse up for the rest of their lives, or would he have demanded a fake breakup to their fake relationship?
“Well, in that case, I miss you, too,” Cas said.
,” Dean said, aiming for a smack to the back of Cas’ head which Cas easily ducked, huge grin on his face. “Just for that we’re getting a meat lovers pizza. None of those nasty vegetables that you love.”
So Spaghetti Bolognese it was. With a dumb salad on the side that Dean made Cas make. And of course, a pie for desert. Dean had even made it himself. He was just taking it out of the oven when there was a knock at the door.
And then their lips were touching and for the second time that day Dean felt as if he had died and gone to heaven. Cas still smelled of the pepperoni pizza they had eaten earlier, and Dean could almost taste it on those soft, plush lips.
Sam turned to watch as Cas stumbled into the Great Hall, eyes still half closed. Both brothers knew that Cas was not a morning person and the only reason he would be up this early on a Saturday was because it was the only time Gryffindor could get to book the quidditch pitch.
Cas shook his head fondly and wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist. “You are ridiculous.”
“It’s not a prank,” Dean told him.
Next, Dean pulled Cas over to the photo area he had just spotted, which was really just a cheesy backdrop with streamers and a teacher with a polaroid. They posed for two pictures anyway, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, huge grins plastered across their faces. Dean would never admit it, but he was definitely going to frame his as soon as he got home. And with the reverent way Cas was looking at his own picture, Dean thought he might not be the only one.
Cas’ lips thinned and his eye narrowed. “I’m sorry,” he replied tersely. “I’m
“Then what—“
“Of course,” Cas replied, walking further into the living room and stopping a few feet away from Sam.
“But you have
Sam took a step forward on bare feet caked in dirt.
“Aw, ain’t you two sweet,” Bobby cooed at them, expecting Dean’s usual brash dismissal of such things.
Castiel smiled softly to himself as he flipped through the next few pages. Two more were covered in the same notes, a sloppy doodle of the impala on the last one.
“I’ll never doubt her again,” Dean swore.
“Falling isn’t enough to kill me,” the man stated as if crashing into the earth from heights unknown was an everyday occurrence.
Charlie threw up the Vulcan salute. “Scout’s Honor.”
“What?” Dean asked, taking his eyes off the road to shoot Cas a confused look. “Why?”
“You’re disgusting,” Castiel told him.
“Husband?” John laughed, and Dean had to admit he thought that was pretty ballsy of him seeing as how Cas had already proven that he was more than capable of taking John down. “Dean, did this thing actually convince you to marry it?”
And then it was their last day of school. The dance would start twenty minutes after the final bell rang. Dean could practically feel the passing of each second in the beating of his heart.
He rummaged in his bag and pulled two skewers out, sticking fresh marshmallows on them and handing one to Cas who stared at him, awaiting instructions.
“Protect him from what?” Sam laughed. “His happy life away from you? I think he’s made it pretty damn clear that he doesn’t want you to be a part of his life anymore, and after what I found out you did to him, you’re lucky I’m not finishing what Cas started.”
It had taken thirty minutes and Gabriel swearing on his life that Dean would not be let out of his sight for even a second to convince her to let him go.
“The doctor said I shouldn’t move.”
“Got it. I’ll be there as soon as my skin stops feeling like it’s melting.” She held her arms out to the sides to soak up more of the air-con.
“It wasn’t a costume!”
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Please,” she said. “This place is doing so well I could show up to work in a chicken suit and we’d be fine.”
Dean looked longingly over to where Cas was paying the pizza man, his stomach growling. With a sigh he turned and walked into the kitchen, wedging his phone between his shoulder and ear. “Do we have to do this right now?”
“Well, not in your case.” Flecks of chocolate sprayed out of his mouth as he spoke through his too large bite.
“But time went on. Sam started to see me. The real me.” Dean started pacing. “That light in his eyes just faded. I was just his stupid brother who was always in a fight, always jumping to do dad’s orders. Sammy started looking at me like he was ashamed, that he couldn’t believe he got saddled with such a fuck up. This is going to be just the same, Cas. Except this time it’ll have pity mixed in there. I can’t do that, Cas. I
“What the hell are you guys doing in here?” Dean asked, stomping his way into the kitchen. “Just raiding my fridge without so much as a hello?”
Cas glared at him. “This is getting ridiculous, Dean. We can’t just not go to the store because you’re afraid you’re going to run into your brother.”
The second he hung up the phone, Cas started in on him. “I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, Dean. I did lead a
Jess’ heart sank all the way down to her knock off designer heels that were already killing her feet. “Are you sure?” she asked, lowering her voice in the hopes that Sam couldn’t hear them.
“I’m sorry,” he said. “Sam wasn’t acting like he wanted to confront you about it and I thought that perhaps it would be best if we were in a safer place. I didn’t want your father to come back while you two had it out.”
! And a huge thank you to all of you readers who made it this far!!! I hope you liked my fic! Comments and kudos are always appreciated :)
Dean took the seat next to him on the log. “Stick it over the fire like this,” Dean told him, holding the speared marshmallow over the flames. “Don’t put it too close or it’ll burn. You wanna try and get it a nice golden brown color. Turn it over when the bottom looks done so you can get a nice even crust on it.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic.”
Cas turned back to John Winchester and looked intent on finally making good on his numerous threats.
He turned to get a better look and deflated. Sam was hunched in on himself, eyes rimmed red as if he had been crying.
Dean rolled his eyes and followed Charlie into the kitchen while Sam and Cas started a round behind them.
“Yes,” Cas answered. “But our friend Benny runs it. He knows far more than either of us about how to run a restaurant. Also about how to cook, although Dean can give him a run for his money on some dishes.”
Dean snorted and threw himself into the seat next to Cas. “Join the club.”
Dean was sitting on the bed poring over the applications Charlie had given to him when Cas walked in and sat down next to him.
“So can I assume that you’re totally crushing on him?” she asked. “Like some serious Doctor/Rose type crushing?”
“What’s another thing?” Dean asked.
“You’re always starving,” Dean told him, taking a small sip of his own coffee.
“Yes, you did,” Cas said. “And I don’t understand why when
“You’re just processing,” Cas said. “And you have a lot to process.”
Well, that would explain why he was sweaty and out of breath that morning, though, Cas had to say he had never noticed Dean’s fear of Ms. Harvelle quite so acutely as he had today.
“Asshole,” Dean grumbled before pressing another quick kiss to his lips and standing up. He wobbled a bit on shaky legs before Cas grabbed him and helped guide him into the kitchen where he sat him down at the table.
Both of them turned to look at the door, and after a moment, John asked, “Aren’t you going to get that?”
“He’s not serious, is he?” Sam asked, turning to Dean.
“Ava, what the heck?” he said, but she shushed him and grabbed his arm, holding tight enough to bruise.
Dean sighed. “Let’s not get into this fight tonight, Cas. Can we just have one night of peace?”
“It’s going to be okay, Sammy,” Dean told him.
“I didn’t say it was.” Dean shrugged and looked anywhere but at Cas. Was he really trying to prove he was pathetic? “Just, you know, get your adjectives right.”
Finally, Dean broke the silence. “You really love me?”
Dean could smell the shampoo in his hair. Vanilla and cherry. It made him smell like pie. “I—uh—I don’t know how to dance either.” He looked down at his feet sheepishly.
“We should get a new tablecloth,” Dean mused, taking a gulp of his drink.
Sam hardly waited until he heard Cas’ feet on the stairs before rounding on Bobby. “Why doesn’t Dean want dad to know he’s here. What happened between them?”
Cas snorted as he watched him. “Are you okay?”
He needed to take his mind off of it. He needed to find something to distract himself. Star Trek, as much as Dean loved it, just wasn’t cutting it. Casting his eyes around the room, he finally landed on his backpack lying innocently next to the door.
“That sounds like a great idea,” Mary said. “Maybe you and your friends can go to the police station tomorrow and help put up posters.”
The writing was messier than usual, the words running together as if he had written it in a hurry.
“But—“
His mother’s mouth twitched at the corner and she let out a sigh as if Castiel was the most exasperating thing she’d ever come into contact with. “I suppose we could go to The Burger Palace—“
!” Sam whined.
John continued, undeterred, “Though, I gotta say. I never knew a siren to stay with their prey for so long. What the hell does he make you do for him?”
“Ansem Gallagher was the first to disappear, and he wasn’t there,” the male detective said.
“That’s what you get for betting, Joanna Beth,” Dean said. “You’re just lucky I’m not telling your mother about this.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, gruff.
Cas bit his lip. His sweet tooth wasn’t anywhere near as bad as his brothers, but he did like a good candy bar at the end of the day. “Your mom would buy me candy.”
“You better do it before he looks over here and sees us talking about him.”
