Instead of speaking, Castiel drops his arms and laces his fingers together before lifting them again and stretching. He presses his shoulders against the door frame, arching his spine and sliding a foot up the back of one leg, really letting Dean get an eyeful of his profile. The shirt rides up, but not quite far enough to reveal the big surprise, so Castiel flips himself around, hugs the doorframe with his left arm, right leg, really playing up the tease.
Hence the three cups of coffee he’s already inhaled and the fourth sitting in front of him now. Ultimately, Castiel takes a deep breath and blows it out before lifting the mug to his lips and taking a deep swig. For all of this institution’s faults and issues, one thing the Bay does not lack is good coffee. In the admin section, anyway.
Cas nodded, and Dean felt his hand sneak under Dean’s coat where it puddled over his thighs, and he gave Dean’s leg an encouraging squeeze.
By the time his flight is back on the ground and taxiing to the arrival gate, Castiel is all worked up. Before the cabin even has the go-ahead to turn on their electronic devices, Castiel’s phone is powered up and dialing Dean’s number yet again. Still no answer, plus no messages and no voicemails. From Dean, anyway—there’s one text from Jody indicating that she and the girls are headed in Whitefish’s direction. There’s another from Sam asking Castiel to check-in and update him when he knows anything.
Castiel takes a deep breath, filled with righteous rage and pride. “So either end the world, or leave us the hell alone.”
Seemingly confused by the sharp change in conversation, Cas nodded, scowling. "Yes, the one where Sam said yes."
the pounding music. A gloved hand waves amiably at Castiel, who nods easily and raises his own hand in return. Sounds like a man, and with an
Despite that distinction, Castiel still managed to make the idea of inflicting and receiving elevated, intentional pain sound exhilarating. He described the kind of eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head experience that could transform a scene and a subsequent orgasm from
“That’s not how I heard it,” Zachariah’s voice chimes in, joining the fray. Inside his room, Castiel groans and buries his face in the pillow. “I saw Ellen at the café this morning and she said—”
With a non-subtle clearing of her throat, Charlie sits up straighter and places her fingers back on the keyboard of her laptop. “Ahem. As I was saying, Dean showed me the recordings from last year’s tactical training class, back when he was still only thinking about signing up for the SWAT team. You’ll be unsurprised to hear that his holdup was that
presumably realizing that her worry over Cas and Dean misunderstanding what went down is wholly one-sided and without gravity. Not to mention, pretty much the last thing on the list of stuff Dean even remotely cares to deal with at the moment. When Cas is better, all bets are off, but for now, Dean has exactly zero brain cells to spare for Charlie’s crap.
Plan B in motion, all that’s left is to carry it out. If all goes as planned, Dean will meet Castiel on the far outskirts of town, and they’ll head into the city together. The Bay has never had an escaped inmate, and the local force is small and pathetic—it will take them quite a while to organize a proper search. Worst case scenario, Dean heads off ahead of him and Castiel follows later. Dean has his burner phone from Sam in the car, so once they’re reunited, contact shouldn’t be an issue.
Sighing and rolling his neck until it cracks, Castiel flips Crowley’s folder shut and tosses it to the side. He sits back in his cushioned leather chair and grimaces at the developing ache in his back. He taps the end of his pen against his lips and surveys the paper-strewn mess he’s made of his desk. Dean’s history, his crimes, all the details of his life are spread out in one-dimension, detailed coldly and dispassionately on various legal forms and copy paper.
okay, but Castiel just nods against his neck and drags Dean in further with one hand on each ass cheek.
Get your jealousy in check—we all saw you with the vampire, alright—because Squirrel sure ain’t gonna stand for it.”
steal Castiel’s entire brain capacity, and only after Sam’s said his name several times does Castiel even realizes he was talking. With reluctance, he tears his eyes away from the still-closing bathroom door, redirecting his attention to the pair of tipsy lovebirds openly laughing at him.
None of the goodbyes are drawn out. After all, this isn’t a place anyone is hesitant to leave. By the time Alfie and Dean emerge from their cells, H2’s living space is mostly clear. Their block mates and a few others are still present, waving and clapping them both on their backs as they pass, and then—
. Time to Indiana Jones it. We should be able to get through with brains and brawn, no angel tricks necessary.”
“So?” Dean prompts, sitting down on the opposite side of the bed but facing Castiel. His body language is much more calm and casual than he was on the beach, much closer to the Dean that went speeding down the highway and back earlier today.
,” Castiel grunts as he surges forward and climbs into Dean’s lap without waiting for permission or bothering to finish his sentence. "
Between his legs, Dean’s cock is rock hard in its ring, even though his arousal has been simmering slow and steady, an afterthought to everything else going on. He supposes that’s the purpose of those things, though, isn’t it? He didn’t pay attention and now his dick is almost painfully engorged.
Dean the only way he thought Dean would let him to acknowledge any of that, and now Dean is paying the price.
. At this point, Dean can wrap his head around the idea that if it escalates, he could die, or at the very least, that he’ll be wishing for it.
“Only asking because I thought angels, you know.” He pauses to scratch the back of his neck awkwardly. “You’re not exactly big with the whole ‘range of human emotions’ thing. ‘Specially the kind of emotions that have a
“You were the one who told me not to intervene when it comes to free will and ‘natural consequences,’” he replies, making air quotes with his fingers.
“May I—” he starts and then stops, hesitating. “I’m going to kiss you, because I love you so much and I can feel it spilling over inside of me. It’s not because we’re sceneing, and I just thought—perhaps you should have the opportunity to say no.”
The way Castiel looks at Dean when he says this makes Dean wary of what he’s going to find on his arm, but when Castiel lifts the gauze, Dean can’t help but draw in a sharp breath.
“So I went down to the courthouse,” Sam continues. “Partly because it was a good place off of a main street to drop a phone for Cas, since he was struggling to dodge the cops. But also because Crowley’s case is still fresh—all of the case file boxes are
Bringing his hands around to slide them across Castiel’s flanks to his back, Dean cast aside every other worry—how Jack was going to kill Chuck, how the forging of the keys was going to go, if Jack had truly forgiven him, if Sam was going to make fun of Dean tomorrow for his soap opera-level day—and just lost himself in Castiel, instead. It was everything he’d needed for so long, and there was no barrier between them anymore. Castiel knew that Dean was in love with him—that perhaps he’d always been. And he returned it with his own love, that Dean could feel the depth of with every single kiss.
Except, once again, Castiel surprises him, his voice steady and even when he says, “He’s adorable, what’s his name?”
deal Cas made, and that Jack hauled him back out of there before Dean had the chance to enlist Billie to throw
Like the asshole he is, Castiel recognizes Dean’s plight and just smirks about it, leaning back against Dean’s raised legs and circling his own hips in sequence with what Dean is doing.
Not that they need to hide; Castiel knows exactly what Sam is up to, and he’s more than welcome to go where he pleases. Sam’s well-integrated into the crew at this point, though it wasn’t always so easy for him. Regardless, he’s in the wings right now for precisely the reason Castiel isn’t—show duties aside. “Will I?” hits a bit too close to home for Castiel, especially with
to him before Cas is being wheeled away and out of Dean’s reach. His heart feels like it’s ripping apart inside his chest but all he can fucking
“Be careful,” is all Benny says, and Dean nods automatically before turning on his heel and heading up the steps. He’ll deal with Benny later. Halfway up, Dean remembers his phone, pulling it out to find an astronomical number of missed calls and messages. There’s exactly one text from Sam—he was the trauma surgeon on duty at Central’s ER today and got to hear about Dean’s heroics first-hand from the rescued kid with the broken leg. He sent a joke about Dean not having to throw himself off a cliff to get out of having dinner with Christian and Brady, and any other time, Dean would have found it hilarious.
“I’m still your home,” he says gruffly, tipping Castiel’s chin up to ensure that he sees that Dean is as serious as he gets. “I’ll always be your home, long as you want me to be.”
the untouchable douchebag he was so intent on believing he was. Cas isn’t perfect, either—he’s got some really problematic thoughts about omegas and about his own role in the way the world is right now—but shit, Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Dean’s not ruling out at least taking the guy to bed over it.
“You,” he declared, pointing his finger at Jody as they walked towards the station. “You are my friggin’ hero. Listen, later, after we get the camp set up, you think we could go out in the truck and—”
that way about me, about men in general.” He looks away, clearly ashamed and Dean is struck, having to confront for the first time, live and in person, how
“Hello, boys,” the man says, surprisingly sporting a pronounced British accent. He’s dressed as sharply as Castiel; full suit, tie, waistcoat—but something about him tells Dean that his dapper appearance is
They really don’t have the time for Dean to test Castiel’s patience, so he nods and grabs the base of his dick, looking up at the camera through his eyelashes. He’s not stupid—Dean knows exactly what he looks like all tied up and splayed out, propped on one elbow over messy, unmade sheets. That’s gonna be one hell of a picture, and suddenly Dean finds himself warming to the idea of Cas maybe taking a few more with just him, after all. He’s already all-in for Cas’ other suggestion, no convincing needed.
“Damn it, kid,” he says. “C’mere, none of this is your fault.” Before he can think better of it, Dean steps forward, dragging his sort-of-son into a tight hug that Jack only hesitates to reciprocate for a split second. That’s likely out of pure shock that it’s happening at all, which makes Dean feel like shit. Still, all he can do is move forward. “Sorry,” he mutters in Jack’s ear. “I know I’m tough on you. But you
He does his best to tug Castiel towards the bathroom they’d visited earlier, but Castiel’s much more sober now (though not entirely), and has no problem resisting.
“Listen,” Dean interrupts, sensing his brother is about to dissolve into an unfixable ramble. He gets up, puts his plate in the sink, and then returns to rest one hand on Sam’s shoulder and press a finger to his chest. “Shut up. I heard you, and I promise I’ll think about everything you said. Maybe. Alright, I’ll at least listen if you need to talk about it sometime in the future. But you and me? We’re good. Everything else? Gravy. This is your day, Sammy. I’m your best man, s’my job to do exactly three things. Keep a beer in your hand, Jess’ ring in my pocket, and steal the whole damn show with my good looks and the best wedding toast in history. Simple as that. You just find your way to the altar and I’ll be right behind you. Got it?”
was a genius, coming up with this plan. Not only did Lowe’s have all the supplies they needed to start rebuilding Bobby’s place, but it also had all sorts of shit to make the cleared out junkyard habitable for humans. The first thing they did was to grab a forklift and load up the empty eighteen-wheeler with several sheds, the log cabin-looking ones that were bigger than some motel rooms Dean’s stayed in. They took every generator in the warehouse, a bunch of portable heaters, plus a crap ton of lumber, drywall, insulation, and all the tools necessary to start work on the house. They stacked everything until the truck was mostly full, almost floor-to-ceiling. Sam eventually had to rein Dean in, reminding him that the store wasn’t going anywhere and that they could always come back for more construction supplies later. Dean reluctantly agreed and settled for grabbing every tarp and extension cord on the premises, along with pallets of toilet paper, cleaning supplies, a toilet, and an actual, full-size shower (and a water heater to go with it). He was pretty proud of that one, and almost a whole seventy-five-percent sure he’d be able to rig it up with the plumbing available in the garage. Twenty-ish people to one bathroom, not a
And yet, Dean wasn’t happy. He knew he should be, they’d gained so much ground in the last twenty-four hours. But it felt like he’d lost something, too, and the feeling churned sickly in his stomach, dampening the excitement he should feel.
The first time Castiel catches sight of Dean Winchester, it’s a bit of a shock to the system. One minute he’s walking down the stark, gray halls of Bay State Penitentiary, mentally reviewing the little information he’s absorbed about the man who never showed up for his intake appointment. The next, he’s rounding a corner, wandering headlong into a scene not often stumbled upon outside the context of a porn set.
together like they were always meant to be touching. Plus, their natural ability to anticipate and play off of each other’s tactical ebb and flow? Well, that just makes for a hell of a show.
But it’s one thing to let people fuck him up and fuck him over, to—as Cas says—make him a prisoner in his own head, if he wants any goddamn peace. It’s a

. Sighing a stream of icy vapor-clouds, Castiel glances around with increasing dismay and regret. He takes in the slightly sagging popcorn ceiling, the stained walls, the trash-covered floors. Realizes with a sinking feeling that those are the

For the first time in months, he doesn’t worry about what Claire is doing while she’s out of his sight.

other type of call and he might have opted to pause and wolf down at least half of his meal, but with a code, seconds matter. Ethically, Castiel couldn’t justify it. Those bites might translate to the difference between being able to restart someone’s heart—or not.
It’s wasteland, as far as the eye can see, dotted by pinpoint settlements and shadows. Even his angelic sight can’t isolate any particular boundary or limit to the scenery—it’s just never-ending red rock desert, and not much else. In the far distance, there
It only takes Castiel maybe thirty seconds to reach them, but by then the guys have given up on fighting Dean. They lower the Reeves to the ground, muttering about how Cas is a medic anyway, and take the free moment to pull off their masks and breathe the fresh air.
It’s no birthday cake from Cas, but Dean can’t stop the smile that spreads across his face at the sight. He won’t miss this place—
Castiel thinks to himself as he wets his hair and soaps himself up, trying his best not to worry that Dean’s simply taken his ball and gone home.
“I have one task for you, just one, and I need you to perform it perfectly, do you understand?” Dean’s eyes slipped closed but he nods, and Castiel is so proud, so in awe of Dean, considering their circumstances. “You are to tell me honestly and clearly, the truth about what you
“Oink,” Fatback snorts pointedly, nodding his head in Jack’s general direction like he understands the conversation and wants to partake.
Thus, during her baby and toddler years, Claire lived mainly with her mother. Later, after her mother took off, Castiel’s own mom stepped up to the plate. It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t
on the cushions, taking up more than half of the couch’s width for absolutely no reason, Dean’s left arm drapes across the back and his legs are spread wide. Yes, an observer who doesn’t know Dean very well would be right to interpret that stance as “easy,” perhaps even carefree.
Walking up to where the Army and National Guard have the end of the street completely blocked off, the scene feels surreal. Dean can’t help but look around and take it all in with growing horror, an emotion he’s rarely felt in his life up until the last few weeks. Spotlights are set up to flood the streets, so bright that once you step underneath them it’s hard to remember it’s night. The sight of the East River Bridges and the outline of Brooklyn lit up just beyond the halo, their own lights a beacon in the darkness, is a jarring reminder.
Dean wasn’t sure if the shaking was turbulence or a world-shattering panic attack. “TELL HER TO GO FUCK HERS—”
Another deep breath. “No,” he replies firmly, clearly, surprised to find that he means it. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the glint of the nearest candle’s flame reflecting off of the metal sitting on top of its little box, but Castiel fits a hand to Dean’s cheek and redirects his gaze to his own face.
Aside from the local government offices, there’s also a hospital, a firehouse (plus another on the west end of town) with an ambulance, and a support services building for families with children and the elderly that includes school and caregivers. There’s a facilities/maintenance building, and several warehouses-turned storage centers, for community supplies. There are also multiple grocery-style “stores”, divided by type (dry goods, produce, animal-related offerings including meat, eggs, and milk). Even what passes for a coffee shop, where several industrial-sized coffee makers are always available and full of hot, caffeinated (or decaffeinated, why?) bliss.
As he walks, Castiel only becomes increasingly confused. He knows that he and Dean act differently together than Sam and Gabriel do. That blanket comparison is missing a
do this, he has to let Cas be the boss of himself. Be the boss of both of them, really, not just when it comes to sex or when Dean deems it convenient.
This is the most risky part, as Dean will have to contend with the other members of his housing unit—either electing to let them in on his plan, or hope that no one feels like hanging out in the common area. In Castiel’s opinion, if this plan is going to go wrong, that is where it will happen.

“Thank you,” Dean belatedly calls out, as Benny wanders into his cell and puts his box down. As Dean steps towards him, Benny walks in his direction and holds his fist out for a bump. Dean accepts the offer gratefully, hoping that Benny can read his sincerity.
Once he’s satisfied, Castiel flips his hair backward. The movement causes water to spray everywhere, including over Dean. He yelps, flinches, and glares, but then seems to realize that the coolness feels good and hops off the counter to do the same. Castiel pretends he doesn’t notice the way Dean wobbles on his feet, still unsteady. It is, after all, the night before their wedding—he can give Dean a break just this once.
"Uh, if I've got a vote," Carl started, then immediately snapped his mouth shut with an audible click when both girls glared at him. "Okay, nevermind."
at that.” Christian pauses to make a face and spit on the floor, and Castiel marvels at the irony, unable to stop himself from cracking a smile. “Oh, you think that’s funny, faggot?”

He was cut off abruptly by Castiel grabbing his arm and yanking him forward. “Focus, Dean,” he growled, slashing his arm out to the side and stabbing an approaching zombie in the head with the point of his angel blade.
It’s that last possibility that roots Dean to the ground, stops him cold where he stands. That harsh reminder that he can look, he can love Cas from afar or from as close as Cas will let him, but he can’t touch, can’t cross that line. Not if he wants to keep him. And fuck Dean’s life, he

Remembering both Amara and the nurse’s warnings, Castiel forces himself to pull away much sooner than he wants to (
Which brings them to here and now, with Cas fussing over his bike and whatever he’s jamming into the saddlebags while Dean stands awkwardly nearby. It’s chilly this morning, but the coastal air feels fresh and relieving after that shitty wakeup call. Dean shifts on his feet and wonders how obvious it is that he’s working crazy hard to will down a semi before it’s time to press his crotch up against Cas ass.
here. Filing cabinets lining all three walls, plus several rows across with space to walk in-between. Near the back of the unit, there’s a large metal rack that obscures the full view of the posterior wall, and curious, Castiel leaves Dean leaning on a cabinet to make his way over.
Donna waved her hand and giggled, “Oh, Dean. Loosen’ up, it’s Christmas. My mom sent me a basket of goodies and well, Jack and I just tore right through ‘em, didn’t we? Candy canes, and salted caramels, and white hot chocolate mix. Jack’s real fond of the salt water toffee too, huh! And—wait...Sam and your boyfriend got kidnapped?!”
They turn, responding to something Cas calls over the music but Dean can’t quite make out. The boys hear it just fine, apparently, brightening as they wave at Dean and lean in to clap him on the shoulder. Everyone’s still jumping and dancing, more paired off than before now that the music has dropped tempo, but it’s loud enough that they’re not going to be having a successful group chat out on the floor.
Once they were settled back in the car, Sam checked on the still bleeding hole in his shoulder, picking at it carefully but resigned to the slow trickle of blood, at least until they could get home and into the real medical supplies. Without any hint of his usual snark and sarcasm, Dean shifted Baby back into drive and pointed them in the direction of home.
"I’m betting on you, you know. After all, I know exactly how our feisty squirrel likes it, I’ve already smuggled in that tunnel—” Crowley was saved from Castiel’s angry fist only by the reddening of his demonic eyes and the way smoke began to curl around his hands. “Step back, Castiel.”
Gabriel could see the water surrounding the massive city and mountain, but there seemed to be a huge dome of air holding it at bay. Question was, what was holding the air? There was no physical barrier; they were too deep for any type of glass or known clear substance to handle the pressure. Besides, whatever was keeping the bubble of air around the city felt magical, or possibly Enochian, in nature. Not only that, but the whole area was lit like mid afternoon, even though they were so far below the water’s surface that the sun didn’t reach them.
The truth is, Castiel knows exactly where he’s going and to whose booth, but he plays it cool all the same, dragging his feet and pretending that he’s not actually making a beeline for Dean Winchester and
The action drives Cas to grind harder against him with a particularly wanton moan that Dean is all too happy to swallow.
Naturally, the ambulance is long gone, and Dean can’t wait to be gone too. He says a blurry and worn-out goodbye to Jesse, somehow finding himself agreeing to poker night with Cas sometime soon because Dean can’t be trusted with his best interests when he needs a nap. Despite that fact, he’s back in his seat in the engine before anything else dramatic can happen (or before he does something really dumb, like imply to more people that Cas loves him back).
threatening—all things considered—Castiel relaxes minutely. He peers with interest at what’s going on behind the bar, where a mirrored wall is inlaid with floor-to-ceiling shelving displaying their wares. Each shelf is crowded with numerous colorful bottles of varying sizes, all filled with mysterious liquids. Castiel wouldn’t venture to guess what’s
Dean saw Sam, Rowena, Gabriel, and Balthazar, the four of them staring at someone in front of them. Dean squinted his eyes until he recognized Crowley.
“Okay,” Dean tells him, touching the uninjured side of his face gently. “It’s okay, Cas, don’t—don’t stress about it, no worries. Sammy’s got a real good doctor ready to fix you all up, okay? And then I’ll be there when you wake up. I’ll be there and we’ll go home, and everything is gonna be okay. You got that?”
Dean squinted at his brother while Castiel agreed, “Sam is right, Dean. You are a pessimist most of the time.”
Grabbing Sam by the sleeve and tugging Cas through the snow, leading them away from the wreckage of the globe, Dean barked over his shoulder, "Oh, I believe. I believe if you ever show your fucking face in my life again, I'll let Cas do that messed up stuff to your intestines."
Cas is busy sticking his hand under the spray and adjusting the temperature, but he rounds on Dean just as soon as he manages to finish that full sentence.
“Dean,” Castiel says quietly. “I hate to ask—but how do you know that Crowley won’t go after Sam anyway? You said—”
“After the funeral, we’ll practice,” Dean murmured, his eyes flickering across Castiel’s face. “I’ll help you, like I promised.”
The phone starts ringing as Dean lifts it to his ear. “Charlie,” he says warmly, when his friend answers. “Hey, I need a favor.”
“I know I said later,” Castiel starts, openly admiring his work and the way Dean’s dick has plumped up significantly from the incidental contact. “But can we circle back to the photography question early? I would love—”
any way for him to go here that doesn’t lead directly into a fully-engulfed fire. He has to ask, though. “Should I—should I try the doors?”
Despite the fact that the back of Zachariah’s clothes are caked with dirt, he has absolutely no shame about it. Like the dad he is, he walks the store aisles proudly, throwing gourmet appetizers and snacks into the cart. To see him, you’d think being covered in mud, pine needles, and sap is some meritorious badge of honor. For a dad at Christmastime, Castiel supposes that may be true. Meanwhile, he and Michael bicker over eggnog brands and whether to get pizza rolls or bagel bites—the
“Absolute—” Balth broke off as he dove for Gabriel, tackling him forward several feet where they both landed in a heap. “—ly,” he finished. Behind them, rubble from the part of the building that hadn’t collapsed when the street caved in lay strewn across the paving stones in the exact spot Gabriel had been standing. “And more than one. I’ve no idea what kind of creature can be there and gone so quickly, but whatever they are, they’re multiplying. Or converging from all corners of the city.”
Dean slides a hand over Castiel’s jaw, thumb tracing over his cheekbone as his muted green eyes blink back at Castiel tiredly in the dark. “Can I tell you something?” Dean asks hoarsely, and Castiel nods, leaning forward to steal another sweet kiss which Dean accepts with a delicious little hum. He licks his lips as Castiel pulls away, flashing an unbelievably soft version of his usual charming grin that makes affection swell inexorably in Castiel’s chest.
What he wouldn’t give to get his toes in that sand, just for a few minutes. He closes his eyes again, feels the salt-sticky breeze in his face, and inhales deeply.
Ignoring that, Zachariah fights with the door, albeit unsuccessfully. “Can’t we continue this inside, Novak? Never understood how you can stand it out here.” He disappears and lets the door close behind him before Castiel can so much as reply, but that behavior is par for the course for him. Castiel resents it, but replacing Zachariah is more trouble than it’s worth. On the whole, he makes and saves the company millions per quarter, catches thousands of incredibly costly mistakes, and frequently readjusts Castiel’s frame of mind when he becomes too lavish with his donations. He’s a counter-force to Castiel’s wild empathy, and that is not a bad thing. Novak Corp is a business, and people like Zachariah are necessary.
in these parties to find joy in. A friend he hasn’t spoken to in a while. A colleague with a fresh or novel idea to create some inspired change. Those little hamburger sliders his party planner knows are Castiel’s favorite (and that she always ensures end up as leftovers in his fridge).
to realize it), the intense wave of emotions took him by surprise, to say the least. The feelings themselves were recognizable, sure, but they were also intertwined with guilt and self-recrimination in a way he had no reason to feel back when he was a sub. Thus, it was a lot harder for him to cope.
“Have you never had the ‘top or bottom’ conversation before? Seems unlikely, considering your record.”
“I’m brown,” Kaia says bluntly. “Not that the police care when they’re beating my ass, but at the end of the day, I’m not Black. If the organization you’re forming is directly connected to Black Lives Matter… then it isn’t right for me to lead. I’ve been guilty in the past, not just of failing to elevate Claire’s voice as an omega, but of taking those spots. I’m trying to do better, trying to pass the mic. We all are,” she adds kindly, offering him a warm smile. “And I still want in on this thing.”
Just like that, Dean’s attitude changes. “Yep, nope, no fucking way. Dude’s got enough ammo to mock me for the rest of both our lives as it is.”
“We’ve been here ever since. The store had power until a couple of hours ago, maybe it had its own generator. We were just waiting, watching the TV. We saw that newscaster get eaten alive and then… it all just went out, no warning. Nothing seems to work anymore.”
In his pocket, Dean could feel the weight of Castiel’s note, and it seemed to get heavier with Sam’s carefully chosen words.  But when he looked up, Sam had that soft annoying-knowing look in his eye, and somehow...it was okay.
“You’re really pale and sweaty, dude,” Dean said rudely. “You’re in shock. It’s okay. It’s normal. We just need to get this magic-healed ASAP. It’s not exactly a run of the mill break here...”
The attempt to use his grace flickered, then faded in a split second. The indignity of the fall struck him first, and then the scent of the alleyway ground that permeated his nostrils; many must have died here already. His hands were scraped and the material of his shirt and tie were ripped against the ground. The gun that had been in his hand before the fall was a few feet away from him; too far.
Instead, Cas’ strong arms come wrapping around his middle, yanking Dean upright so that his shoulder blades are flush against Cas’ chest. The move drives Cas deeper, tighter, as far inside as he can go. It’s so much exactly what Dean wants that all he can do is moan—
small, and Dean wishes more than anything that there was a view of the parking lot, some glimpse of the outside world to ground him.
Down by the ocean, the boardwalk separating sand from town is even quieter. That solemn, isolated atmosphere is just how Castiel likes it to be. The boardwalk’s wide, lit path stretches for nearly half of a mile in either direction, the only barrier between various hotels and vendors and the beach. Nearly completely deserted tonight, the shops and arcade are shuttered and dark, shells of themselves during these colder months. Similarly, the ice cream and fried food stalls that surely buzz nonstop with business during summer are sporting heavy chains that keep them locked up tight.
“We’re surrounded,” Sam observed, far too calmly for their situation. He didn’t move his head to look at Dean as he spoke, just yelling and letting his voice carry back. He was far too experienced to make that kind of mistake.
With a snap of his fingers, Gabriel called the iron box to them and they flew inside it. That was easier than remaking the box. Constructing it had taken quite a bit out of him. And now they were planning on making one much, much larger. “We should give it an hour or so to give the ghosts time to get here, then drop the cage. The bars have to be close enough together that none of the ghosts can get through the gaps, though.”
Smiling slightly to himself, Castiel slid his empty hand slowly up and down Dean’s back, stroking idly as he began to whisper.
Dean flapped Castiel's hand at them while they barreled over, letting out celebratory whoops as they moved. Castiel was quiet as they talked over each other, poking at his hand and asking for details, but his silence was the peaceful kind. Dean could tell he was pleased, endlessly so, and he felt the exact same.
fuck on a balcony?” His composure while being swallowed is commendable, but Castiel is beginning to take it as a challenge.
But Castiel just smirks and thumbs over Dean’s lower lip, pressing down on his chin and forcing him to make eye contact. It’s a check, he’s seeing if Dean is alright. When Dean winks in affirmation, Castiel grins and goes right back to the punishing pace that’s probably going to result in Dean needing a new hip. Not that he’s complaining.
“Lieutenant Fifteen to Fire Command,” he says, after depressing the mic button and waiting for the channel to click open. Benny answers in short order, and Dean rolls his eyes. “I’ll be with EMS for fifteen,” he says grudgingly.
Castiel wakes early the next morning to his phone ringing and a painful pulsing hardness in his boxers. On the other end of the line, Castiel’s deputy rambles in his ear about some diplomatic emergency his skills are needed to smooth over while he presses the heel of his hand between his legs with a stifled groan.
Dean blinks, his turn to be surprised. “Uh, sure. Um, the panic button is the ultimate snitch. You press it, whoever’s Top Dog is like, legally required to beat your ass bloody. That’s one of those things that never changes between regimes, either. You’re a prisoner? You never,
Without asking for permission, he slides across the bench seat and unbuttons Dean’s jeans. He turns up the radio—Zeppelin—reaches past Dean to roll down his window, and then refuses to touch Dean’s cock for the next twenty or so miles. Instead, he sucks kisses under Dean’s jaw and just below the neckline of his shirt. He palms Dean’s stomach, pinching and tweaking his nipples until he’s squirming. He drags fingernails up and down his inner thighs, teasing and torturing until Dean seems to forget about whatever
For lots of reasons, but just for starters: Dean has seen Cas almost-naked more times than he’s seen the body of
Dean opened the door to the truck but paused to grin, his hand gripping the frame of the driver side. He was one foot in when he stopped to say, “Dude, I’m trying to tell you you’re looking good. Like…” As Cas stared at him, Dean began to lose his nerve. “Uh, you know, like...sexy.”
Sex-related tags: hand-feeding, lowkey public play, Shibari, suspension, rimming, deepthroating, gentle facefucking, nude photography, plugs, vibrators, spreader bars, restraints, hair pulling, slapping, wax play, clothespins for nipple torture, bottom Dean, coming untouched.
of them. He told me it was very important that all stories in this universe were told. This one was his masterpiece. But...I became aware that he had limits. His tolerance of change in these plotlines was thin, and I knew one day he’d leave this world like he left all his others if it did not go his way. God, I realised, was fickle.”
it, Winchester,” he demands, but Dean doesn’t even dignify him with a reply. He does check the exterior windows as they move past the classroom and Cas’ office (
it. Almost as much as he hates the fact that he’s been sniffing for Castiel’s scent ever since he entered the room and he’s yet to be able to suss it out.
“Sam was tracking your phone all along. It was easy enough to conclude that the blood trail leading away from Gates Way belonged to you, although I
still the Queen and we’ve done it before. You were both there,” he adds. Jack and Sam exchange yet another knowing glance, and Castiel misses Dean more than ever. “
Three fish, six beers, and a shared can of cold Spaghettios between them later, Castiel and Dean replace their fishing rods against the wall before heading out to the car. The ride to the Intrepid is a short fifteen minute drive, but they stretch it out. They pit stop at the video store to exchange the movies they have and Dean
Castiel snorts when he thinks about the fact that Gabriel likely scars their neighbors on a daily basis. To the chorus of Gabriel’s sleep-mumbling, he quietly lifts the sash on one of the other windows and slips out onto the fire escape. Gabriel sleeps on, oblivious.
I chose to still post the chapter this week because we all need an escape sometimes, and I thought y'all could use the big step towards our happy ending amidst your fight for social justice.
—>Poor coping skills—Dean attempts to hide his feelings from Cas and does some running away. This is brief.
“But ultimately,” Cas whispered, eyes flickering between Dean’s and then resting on his lips, watching them with a strangely distant look in the depths of azure and sapphire, “I chose to stay. ”
“I’ll stay behind as well,” Rowena chimed in. “The warding needs some additional fine tuning and I do believe I’m close to spelling our water source into something passably drinkable.”
Sam thought, though he couldn’t quite parse out what all that might mean, so he didn’t bother to vocalize his observations to the peanut gallery. He tore his gaze away from the window to check in on Dean and found him darting concerned glances in the rearview mirror at Cas more often than was probably safe while driving, at least with so many unpredictable hazards wandering around. Apparently Sam’s not-so-subtle insinuations that Dean had messed up with Cas
of air entering and leaving his lungs, the soft comfort of the mattress below, the weight of Cas’ strong arms bracketing his body, and the constant
“Never something I thought I’d say, but—” Jo followed Rowena as she headed towards the door."—I’ll help the witch with the voodoo.”
Have wanted to marry you for way longer than I let on,” Dean admits easily, sliding an arm around Castiel’s waist and pulling him in close, swaying them both gently back and forth. “Sorry, Cas,” he adds with a little laugh and a shrug before trailing more kisses over Castiel’s jaw. “I ain’t scared at all about tying myself to you. You know, all of my worst nightmares—back when we were running circles around each other? Every single one of them was about losing you. What I’d have left when you were gone, when you decided it was time to move on.”
As they walk away, they can hear Sam laughing from the War Room. “Dude,” Sam says, “Pretty sure that was the most outstanding personification of a “fuck you” in all of history. No, but seriously, get out or I’m gonna shoot you.”
Cas’) plans for the latter part of the supply run together, and Sam had seemed genuinely happy that Dean wasn’t attempting to shoulder the full responsibility for absolutely everything that lay ahead of them on his own. Obviously, that meant Dean was
glad, otherwise he’d have to use his own brain and that’s—well, Castiel’s brain is not one hundred percent online at the moment.
As anticipated, Dean rolls his eyes and shoves himself up off of the couch, closing the distance between them in less than three strides. It’s a long enough period of time for Castiel to see what’s coming and to stand, but he opts to stay where he is. He does force a look of surprise onto his face as he leans back, allowing Dean to step in and straddle his lap.
In a twist that shocks absolutely no one (least of all him), Dean struggles to believe her most days. After all, Batman never got
Dean would mock him if he were to admit that, the same way he did Castiel’s job at the Gas-N-Sip. Dean doesn’t understand—
“This is the one,” Balthazar says, comparing the markings above the door to what’s written on Gabriel’s paper. He holds the door for everyone to pass through. “Room two-oh-one,” he calls out, and Castiel nods as he takes the lead.
“Fallen in love, huh?” Dean asked slowly, a bead of hope swelling to the size of a balloon in his chest. His lip twitching up in the corner, flashing Cas a peek of teeth. Dean chuckled. “Fancy that.”
But Dean isn’t careful now, the way he usually is. He leaves a few scattered lights on around the house. He doesn’t make any attempt to stay quiet as he locates a bottle of whiskey and takes it upstairs to his bedroom.
At first, he caught himself. “S—” is all he’d get out before stopping and forcing himself to say, “Hunter.” But after a while, when it kept happening, Dean ran out of reasons to care. It wasn’t as if the real Sammy was around to protest. Maybe that was unfair to the human Sam and it was probably definitely unfair to the dog, but Dean was exhausted. And terribly lonely. And for whatever reason, having a tiny piece of Sam back, even if it was just his name, felt
“No, Cassie, let me explain. The staff Moses carried didn’t have the tip. After the keys were broken, I gave part of it to people I knew in Egypt that would hide it. They fashioned it into a spear tip and attached it to a spear, and since Ancient Egyptian times were all about who could make the Pharaoh the happiest, the staff eventually made its way into the hands of whoever was on the throne at the time. You following?” He glanced around waiting for a nod or two before continuing. “You know the story of Moses? How he was brought up in the Egyptian royal household but escaped to the desert to avoid a death penalty?”
For a moment, Dean actually thinks it’s going to work. Sam’s increasingly shallow and rapid breathing slows down, back to normal range. The redness in his eyes clears and he stops growling. Dean is
The church itself is very pretty, though, with tall, elaborate stained glass windows that spill multi-colored light onto the worn pews, even in the early evening. There’s also the fact that it means something to Jimmy to be able to marry his brother here, which Castiel can’t argue with. And Dean could not care less either way—his exact words were, “that means it’s free, right?”
And no doubt Dean would find that creepy as all get out, would probably kick him out of their home, might even want a new partner at the precinct. Ten plus years of friendship down the drain because Castiel couldn’t control his stupid feelings and emotions. A hot rush of shame washes over him and he stares down at the way the toes of his black work boots sink into the muddy grass with just the slightest pressure. Dean can
blushing and ducking his head, like he was the one playing pop star in the middle of the kitchen. As quickly as it came though, Dean’s interlude dissolves and his normal persona is back, bustling over to help himself to Castiel’s clothes in his hands and to nudge him into taking a seat at the table.
He’s so pleased and proud of Dean, so turned on by the way he’s spread out and willing to do anything Castiel desires of him. When both cocks can go no further, Castiel gives Dean another moment to adjust, and then starts to move. He’s careful to hold the dildo in place and to not be too rough or demanding, but there’s plenty of lube in the mix and Dean’s rim is doing just fine. Castiel fingers it admiringly as he rolls his pelvis, and Dean moans, flexing his hips up for more.
The urgency and gravity of the scene below contrasted by the loud cheering, the music and partying that leaks out from windows and doors all up and down the street, is stark. That—and the illegal fireworks shooting into the sky all around them—contribute to a feeling of unreality for an already off-kilter Castiel.
Cas lets Dean nose behind his ear while he pisses, and when he’s done, he says so, without any indication that he’s feeling any type of way. The manner in which his dick has filled out a little in Dean’s hand says otherwise, though, so instead of complying, Dean gives it a stroke or two.
This wasn’t the story God had written, Kassiel had thwarted his ending. God had plotted everything out so closely and Kassiel had
Their conversation is abruptly interrupted by the director calling them all, “back to one,” as if they’re real actors on a set. Upon glancing over his shoulder, Dean sees Alicia laughing sheepishly with Victor, and he narrows his eyes at the apparent competition. Reminding himself that he’s glad Alicia is okay, Dean finishes off the champagne before standing and forcing himself to trek back through the sun to the patio, Charlie trailing slightly behind. Remembering her fears, Dean takes a moment to turn around and squeeze the petite redhead’s shoulder reassuringly.
Dean stretches out his hand in offering and Castiel takes it reflexively. His stomach flips. Dean’s fingers are calloused but his palm is warm and dry, his grip firm, and the butterflies return to Castiel’s abdomen in full force.
a worst-case scenario, and likely why Bobby hasn’t suggested he access those doors at all. There may not
“Self-preservation,” Castiel retorts. “Nothing about this is easy, Dean. You’re doing an incredible job here.”
“Come on,” Anna says insistently, looping an arm through Castiel’s and dragging him towards the first vendor, something with a sign that suggests they sell fancy personal care products. “There are some
With a sigh, Castiel moves to sink down onto one of the bar’s matching wooden stools, plain but sturdy, when he’s stopped cold in his tracks by a familiar,
“Sorry,” Dean says brusquely, tone covering desperately for the waver still present in his voice. “Just—one minute. Let me try, please? I’m trying.” He manages to look up and make eye contact, because he’s figured out it’s what Cas responds to best, what makes him feel respected and like Dean is being sincere. It works; Cas nods and relaxes minutely, letting Dean have the space to get what he needs to say from his brain down to his tongue and out into the world.
“Want you,” he says into Castiel’s skin, pressing a soft kiss to the crease of his groin. Above him, Castiel exhales in a measured way, barely suppressing a twitch of his pelvis that suggests he wishes Dean would get a move on. Smiling to himself, Dean wraps his hand around Castiel’s cock and strokes loosely until he’s nearly fully erect.
And then he spent the next three weeks pretending that he was the victim and not the villain. Castiel dug in so deep—ignoring Dean in the hallways, avoiding him at work, even blowing off Sam when he tried to hang out—that it became far too difficult to simply admit he was wrong and ask for forgiveness (no matter how many times Gabriel tried to convince him to do so).
Here in their bed, Castiel shifts, shuffling around until he’s straddling Dean’s face, Dean’s dick still halfway down his throat. It only slips out when Cas collapses ungracefully onto his side, growling at Dean and using his heel to dig at Dean’s shoulder, impatiently asking him to follow. With a chuckle, Dean turns onto his own side, hand on Cas’ hip, and gladly takes Castiel’s cock into his mouth. Right away, he goes to town sucking and humming noisily, smiling stupidly around it when Cas finally sighs and relaxes, going back to what he was doing before and
If Dean feels any relief that Alastair isn’t due to be a part of whatever’s going to happen next, he’s deprived of taking even one single moment to enjoy it.
the government—had seen fit to even bother trying to recover what was left behind there. That might have been understandable considering the circumstances, but the lab
idea what Dean is like as a sub or what his limits may be. This is a safety precaution as much as it’s anything else—a “getting to know you,” of sorts. This way, everybody gets what they want, everybody wins, no one goes home crying.
“Nah,” Dean said, already nodding at Cas to follow him down the side corridor. “We’re just down the hall. Should be back before you guys are.”
Out on the patio, the rest of the cast has already gathered, and all of them look as confused and anxious as Dean feels. Charlie finds him immediately, looking excitedly between Dean and Cas while raising her eyebrows.
That’s a nightmarish thought, and Castiel quickly banishes it in favor of reveling in the beautiful way this moment actually
jingle bells, and a little speaker that looks suspiciously functional and probably plays Christmas music. He’s definitely not going to draw attention to it. “Long time, no see. How are you? When did you get into town?”
. He watched the angel run his hands over the edge of the sleigh and over the black velvet seat, a small laugh escaping his dry lips.
“Awesome,” Dean declares in amazement, staring down at his own chest and then back at Castiel like he’s never seen a simple illusion before. “You’re awesome.”
existed a time when Dean was able to convince himself he was not actually head-over-heels in love with Castiel, those days are well and truly over.
A sudden, incredibly distressing realization brings Castiel up short, and he’s glad he’s facing the wall so that Dean can’t see his face.
bad. Dean works him over, teasing and drawing pleasure until Cas can’t remember his own name, never mind his problems. The water washes it all away.
He sighs. “Great, Charlie,” he replies reluctantly, though he continues glaring at Castiel. “Breaking news, Castiel Novak can buy nearly everyone’s loyalty.”
Even though Dean owes the kid more than he could ever find a way to repay, somehow, Alfie is the one helping
Gabe tugged his team’s walkie from his belt and raised it to his mouth. “Breaker 1-9. Get a haircut, you punk. You look like Justin Beiber.”
“I vomited while I was on her bed. If that’s the same thing, then yes. There was a bucket involved, but I can’t imagine that was any less disgusting for her.”
No reason they can’t use that time to have a little fun, though. Castiel’s softening to that prospect surprisingly quickly. By the time they part, he’s already making a mental list of what
“Yup,” said Dean on a sigh, already resigned to whatever seasonal fuckery was about to take place. “If it’s more elves, I suggest baseball. You guys pitch ‘em, I’ll bat.”
He must not have heard Castiel enter, must not be able to smell him over whatever is fragrantly heating in the pan (chicken masala, on Castiel’s wild guess). The alpha puts his folder down carefully on the counter before seizing the rare opportunity to surprise Dean. Coming up from behind, he wraps his fingers over the handprint on Dean’s shoulder, watching the way the omega shudders, how the hairs at the back of his neck prickle right before Castiel’s eyes.
The bars slam shut behind him and Dean winces, but at least the cuffs are off. The entirety of what he’s up against—the fear of the undeserved wrath of these officers—all of it really starts creeping up on Dean, threatening to overwhelm him. Hands shaking, he sits down on the pillowless, blanketless metal cot bolted to the wall and sucks in a deep breath before blowing it out slowly.
Dry-mouthed, Dean nods, maybe not entirely sold but definitely willing to see where this is going. “Relax, Dean,” Castiel says softly, leaning down to press a kiss to Dean’s neck. “It’s important that you know this is not a punishment, this is me giving you something you feel you need. You can slow things down or bring them to a stop anytime you like, and if you do, you won’t be disappointing me. There’s nothing to live up to here but your own expectations for yourself. What is your safeword?”
The surprise on Castiel’s face isn’t something Dean was expecting, but it makes him hopeful. Cas keeps his eyes trained on where his fingers travel, but his voice is not nearly as steady as it has been. “I fear that I would be exposing myself in a very transparent way if I were to admit that I’m not disappointed that we are being discouraged from sharing sexual intimacy.”
he reminds himself. He has to be calm for Cas because Cas needs him. All day, every damn day, Cas worries about Dean, puts his needs first, is
“That’s a story for later. I should get Alex now, though,” Castiel replied. “You might need more drugs, or something…”
Steadying himself, Dean tries to prepare for what might be on the other side—life or death; this is the moment of truth.
word or grunt in return, but that wasn’t exactly new. Still, by the end of the call, Castiel was wondering if he’d made a mistake in cashing in this chit, since Cain had gone completely and totally silent.
By the end of the transformation, Castiel (who is still glowing) has two perfect wings, every feather intact and sporting multifaceted, inky blue-black coloring that flashes rainbow in the same way an oil spill might when it’s hit with light. It—
But in response, the kid had dug in his heels, sticking out his tongue before socking Dean in the stomach and high-tailing it out of his living room and up the stairs.
For a few minutes, anyway. Then he covered it back up, reminded himself that Cas loved him as he was, and headed back up the corridor.
“Don’t fuck it up, Castiel,” Crowley’s voice sounds in his ear, terribly timed as usual and nearly stepping on cues for the entire cast and crew. One of these days, Castiel is actually going to strangle him. Instead, he rolls his eyes and breathes the irritation with his director away.
Naomi hums and nods slowly, swallowing what might be half of the whiskey she has left. “Memorable for the right reasons,” she says, by way of agreement.
The sun is already peeking determinedly through the early-morning dusk outside, so between that and the timing of Meg’s phone call, Dean puts the hour at just before six a.m.
“You could’ve waited to let him open it,” he grumbled, though it was only half-hearted. “Just until me and Cas were here.”
“Isn’t it?” Alfie cuts him off, shoving Dean a little so that he steps back. “You think this is over, you think we’re out? Mark my words, Dean, you’re gonna wish you let me put a bullet in him.
, and a big part of the story is figuring out what that might be. The scenes with D/S and S&M are fully intertwined with the storytelling. Cas does certain things because he
intentional teasing). The effect lands; Castiel’s eyebrows shoot nearly up into his hair and he abandons the armful of crap he’s carrying unceremoniously onto Dean’s desk.
The drive is around two hours long and Cas begins to complain when they’re still thirty minutes away that he needs to pee and can’t hold it any longer. Considering how close they are, Dean knows that if he takes the blindfold off now, Cas will definitely guess their destination. Maybe that wouldn’t be the end of the world—it’s definitely not the end of the surprises—but Dean has an image in his mind of how he wants this to go.
Every time Cas’ hand grazes his thigh, his ass presses against Dean’s crotch, or his arm slings around Dean’s stomach (neither of them is a subtle sleeper), Dean finds himself staring at the ceiling on a thirty to forty-minute reset.
So that’s what he’s been doing, up to this point. Setting Cas up with a new series to binge watch and then taking off for a few days to chase down whatever ghost or werewolf or ghoul is scaring up small-town America. It’s not the smartest idea to hunt alone, but it’s not the first time Dean’s done it, either. On the one hand, he’s no spring chicken, but on the other, he’s friggin’ gone up against
As Castiel descends the staircase, he can’t help but admire the two-story display of backlit glass “windows” to his right. They’re obviously fake, since not even the tops of them are visible from the outside, a tromp l’oeil that Castiel finds extremely effective at convincing his own brain that he’s not underground at all. There’s plenty of other lighting as well, soft and homey, doing its part to showcase that this is a welcoming space, and Castiel is suddenly glad that he didn’t run.
With a put-upon sigh, he heard Cas’ dress shoes squeak against the tile, clacking softly as he started to walk away. But before Dean could fully breathe that sigh of relief he started to let out, Castiel changed his mind, because
Sam looked. Castiel was leaning against the wall, his shoulders hunched, his arms folded over his chest. His eyes were fixed on Dean as Alex worked, wide but somehow unseeing. He was pale, and his fingers flexed against his arms. He looked to be panting shallowly, as if…
Once situated, he admires the way the metal sits nestled between Dean’s plump cheeks, a bow on the best gift Cas has ever received. Just like Dean, part of him wishes they could fast-forward the night, skip to the grand finale. On the other hand, good things come to those who wait, and all of that.
The entire center square filled with shrieks of terror, the elves tripping over each other to get away from Dean, who was unloading his gun into the heap of red velvet and fluff in the snow.
“Do they?” Dean blurts out, forgetting himself, at least until Novak raises an eyebrow. “I mean—sorry,” he amends. “Most guards would write somebody up for somethin’ like that, accident or not.”
Dean Winchester is no rocket scientist, but it wouldn’t take a genius to see why that was the absolute wrong thing to say at that particular moment. Castiel’s face falls heavily and Dean immediately kicks himself, rushing to explain. “No, ah, shit. That’s not what I meant,” he mutters, more to himself than anything else, but Castiel eyes him warily. “Normal like, you know, we have to buy lube at the store, not make it
As the guy makes his way towards where Alastair is still lurking in the doorway, Crowley turns his attention back to Dean. “You have a decision to make, Mr. Winchester, and limited time in which to make it. As you likely have not yet figured out—because your brain is the size of a squirrel’s and boasts the same attention span—my associate is going to knock your escort unconscious.”
“I know I’ve said this like a hundred times, but this really means a lot to me, Dean,” she says, back to talking as if Castiel isn’t even there, and Castiel supposes that’s pretty normal when you’re basically the display behind glass for a bunch of window shoppers. Dean just grunts, wiping a gauze pad across his work before going back to it, and okay, that’s
though, there is a bigger revelation at stake. However painful, it’s become abundantly clear to Castiel that people are not honest with him. His entire inner circle does nothing but butter him up, pat his back, and tell him all the things he’s doing right. Even Crowley, who certainly doesn’t shy away from saying what he thinks, doesn’t do so about anything that really
Dean shrugs before flitting a glance around the deserted bar. “Trust me, the demon riding the bartender won’t care. I got a room out back if you’re catching nerves, though.” He winks. “Is the big, bad, orgy-throwing angel feeling shy?”
All of the gear worn in the burn buildings today needs to be laundered, and Dean’s thankful a few of the other city stations took some of the newbies’ stuff, or they’d be washing straight through until he’s due back in again on Monday. Officer gear takes priority, so Dean doesn’t bother checking in with Benny before emptying his pockets and dumping his pants, hood, and jacket straight into the open industrial washer at the side of the bay. It’s full, so he closes it up, checks the settings and detergent level, and sets it to work.
It’s quickly becoming apparent to Dean that his unconscious self doesn’t have the same reservations about Castiel that his waking brain does. Hell, after last night, even his waking brain is having a hard time remembering what, exactly, he’s so damn worried about.
“Howdy,” he says brightly, ignoring Crowley completely as he drops his arms and heads casually over to the buffet line. Cain’s warnings about the corrupt kitchen staff echo in Dean’s head, but he’s not worried. His crew knows not to touch the food, and this isn’t about
Myself, I'm looking forward to not having Jingle Bell Rock stuck in my head at all hours of the day.
He must look upset, because Dean’s brow furrows and he visibly slips back into his normal persona, out of any subspace that might have been creeping in. As Castiel stares down at him, Dean struggles up onto his elbows, balancing on one so that he can reach out and touch Castiel’s face. “Yea, Cas,” he says pointedly, voice full of solemn empathy. “I hear you. I promise.”
“Alright,” Castiel persists impatiently. “He’s not responding to my messages, should I just check your apartment? Or—”
Dean laughed as he turned the key, holding his breath as the engine turned over and the fuel gauge rose, only blowing it out when he was sure that they did, in fact, have fuel. “Probably should have checked that first,” he muttered under his breath. To Castiel, he said, “We’re just lucky it’s mostly flat between here and home and that no one else is on the roads. We’ll let Sammy get ahead of us a little and then I’ll, you know, just... step on the brakes really early.” Dean shrugged and the terrified look started to return to Castiel’s face. “Aw, c’mon, man. I drove a cement truck once, figured that out on my own. This can’t be much worse.”
“I was only going to suggest that you stay,” Castiel says, reaching out but stopping short of touching Dean’s hand. He draws back as Dean looks up at him in confusion. “Here.”
Elbows deep in the zombie, their torture master pulled out a handful of intestines, staring at them like they held Hell’s darkest secrets, before he swiped at the innards with a long, curved razor. Black goo poured over the demon’s hands from the guts, and he dropped the gore back into the open science experiment.
Well, they at least didn’t mind taking Cas’ money in exchange for those changes, anyway. Same diff, as far as Dean is concerned. It’s nothing that’ll be noticeable to anyone who isn’t looking for it, but still. Testing the strength of the two ropes hanging from brand new silver loops in the raftered ceiling of the living room, Dean grins and makes a mental note to send Meg her favorite pizza the next time she’s at work. He owes her big.
Tessa sighs, coming to stand next to him and placing a hand gently on his forearm. “Dean,” she says patiently. “Please don’t make this harder than it has to be. You know I don’t want to force you, but this is the Warden’s call. It’s a direct order for me. If you’re going to refuse, I’ll have to call Deacon back and—”
The pre-entry area of Dean’s basement lab is outfitted with UV lights in the stairwell and a surgical scrub sink outside the door. The sink’s purpose is obvious, but the lights are two-fold. One, they test the skin of any Darkseeker he might bring down for human trials to confirm the presence of Krippin Virus and two, they provide
And so, Dean gets Cas’ hands down his pants, up his shirt, and squeezing his ass at every available opportunity and then some. He has an innocent-faced Castiel sliding into the shower behind him and hopping into bed stark naked, knowing full-well what he’s doing and having the nerve to
Appearing disturbed by something, Dean sat down defeatedly onto his backside, guarding Castiel’s injury from the others, bracketing it with his legs.
Grabbing a wavering Dean under the arm to support him, Castiel walks them forward, over the threshold and into the musty-smelling space. Luckily, there’s a switch on the wall and Castiel flips it, leaving them both blinking like newborns in the sudden too-bright wash of light.
Perhaps while he was hunting with Sam, or maybe long after Sam was gone, some night he forgot scent killer or improperly secured a window. Or hell, maybe he’d get pneumonia, the kind that came with a raging fever and needed IV antibiotics and the kind of medical support only found in nonexistent ICUs to recover from. One day he’d be fine and the next,
But Dean picks that moment to shift against him, and Castiel is reminded of his responsibility to the man. There is no time, no
“If I let you suck my cock, you’ll be my good boy, won’t you? You’ll be still. You’ll raise your hand if you’re in pain and say “yellow” when you’re able?”
As Castiel closes the back doors to the ambulance, he lingers inside Dean’s personal space bubble, only for a moment. “Will I still see you later?” he asks softly, his hand hovering
Eyes locked on Cas’ pools of ocean blue, Dean doesn’t trust himself to reply. Instead, he twists his hand where it sits in Cas’ and slides their fingers together, glancing down at where they’re joined briefly before focusing back at Cas’ face. He could lie, he could vamp, he could joke, or—
choice to make, Dean, not yours. If we need to do it, we have to do it, no matter the consequences. I thought you were going to let me do what I have to do.”
“It’s why you were here,” Castiel spoke up, his grim voice loud in the boiler room. A pipe dripping behind him was the only other competing sound. Cas’s crossed arms dropped to his side and he reached behind him to point at the door, out to the mall. “You were fetching new meat for his experiments.”
“I can leave,” Castiel offers. “I only wanted to see and support you and Claire. But this is—I never intended to make this event uncomfortable for you.”
Which means that—if Castiel is understanding this conversation correctly and not actually still asleep and dreaming—Dean’s
“Don’t.” Dean cuts him off, closes his hand the rest of the way around Castiel’s arm and tugs. “You don’t gotta apologize for how you feel and I’m not gonna listen to you beat yourself up about it.” Taken aback, Castiel lets himself be swept along, uncaring that his shirt is unbuttoned halfway down his chest because at least it’s still covering his back. Dean ferries him along down the steps of the library, through the war room, and out a door on the far side. All the while he hangs on to Castiel, a steady harbor in the storm of Castiel’s otherwise building anxiety. Exiting the War Room, Dean heads confidently down the hallway Castiel recognizes from when they’d drunkenly stumbled through it together on the night he stayed over.
shoot it, you just can’t hit anything except your sister…” Dean dissolved into indulgent chuckles. “Sorry.”
“Finally,” Balthazar gasped three traps later as the hall opened into a round chamber. The golden instrument sat atop a pedestal in the middle of the room.
“Clothes,” he murmurs against Castiel’s lips, unwilling to really pull away even as they fumble at each other’s shirts and belts, the process of undressing at least three times more difficult for it. The extra struggle is worth it though, as far as Castiel is concerned, to feel the way Dean
“Charlie,” Sam says patiently, cutting her off as she opens her mouth to launch into another spiel of complaints regarding Dean’s inability to use actual words regarding his emotions. “It’s not that I don’t love having you here, or disagree with you at all about Dean, but you do know this is actually my job? If I don’t, you know,
At least where he’s staying right now, he could walk to the prison—easily, in fact—if he truly wanted or needed to do so. Absently, Castiel turns all of this over in his mind as his drive comes to a close. True, his current residence is small and come winter, will almost certainly make him feel as if the walls are closing in. All the same, a better option has yet to present itself.
Earlier this afternoon, after skipping out of work long before close of business, Castiel (and his party planner) put the finishing touches on his party and then opened the house doors wide. The event commenced at around six in the evening, just as the sun began to set. Invitations sent ahead specified cocktail wear or business casual, and most everyone came in their work attire, straight off the Metro or out of government-issued, chauffeured SUVs, fresh from the office.
of us would have pushed you towards someone we thought would give you an ultimatum? God, we all overestimated your ability to act like an adult, though, didn’t we? Dean is the
With a grin (and a crook of the finger still firmly inside Dean’s ass), Cas nods and swallows him down again, the texture of his slick tongue and pulse of his throat muscles dragging Dean
“You have and would do the same for my dumb ass,” Dean retorts, unable to stop himself from capturing Cas’ lips once again. “C’mon, kiss me back, asshole,” he demands when Cas is less than responsive. In response, he gets a hand in the middle of his chest slamming him back down on the couch, followed by a reproachful glare.
“While I’m enjoying this unexpected change of heart immensely, next time let’s just yell at each other and one of us sleep on the couch instead of inviting near-death experiences in, shall we?” Castiel’s joking, but something behind Dean’s eyes darkens, and he looks ashamed. In truth, it’s a fair emotion that Dean probably deserves to feel, but circumstances considered, Castiel thinks Dean has suffered more than enough punishment for his transgressions.
“Shit,” Dean swore, picking up the pace a little as they skirted the edge of town. “Any idea what this means?”
people to notice, wants them to ask. Wants them to be aware that in nearly every way that matters, Dean is
In response, Claire just grins and points up at a makeshift podium—basically an upside-down crate, a mic, and some speakers from somebody’s home entertainment system—where a darker-skinned girl with thick, wavy black hair is struggling to balance without falling over.
There’s also the fact that there is an animal out here, following them. It’s not very big (from the vague glimpses of grey fur Castiel has caught) and doesn’t seem outright dangerous, but it’s definitely on their tail. Whenever Castiel hears it rustling in the bushes, he quickly navigates a bit in the other direction. Strangely, each time he does so, the interruption in his mindless “one-step-two-step” rhythm forward alerts him to the fact that he has, indeed, gone somewhat off-path.
Bobby and Ellen, Pam and Claire, Naomi, Garth, and Tessa. Sam and Jess apparently drove down after leaving the hospital instead of going home like Sam
Castiel prays that Chuck’s final gift came with a pardon for Sam’s soul. Not that he can ask, since when he turns his head back to where Chuck was just standing, he’s gone.
But Sam doesn’t want to be cured. He doesn’t want help and he doesn’t want Dean. He has a new family now, that much is clear. Whatever he is, whatever—
Admittedly, between the lack of light and the distracting nature of Cas’ presence, Dean gets caught up and forgets to warn his guest about the broken step towards the top of the flight. It’s only when Castiel huffs and stumbles, tumbling forward and out of Dean’s hands, that he remembers.
They don’t bother with condoms. The very thought seems ridiculous now, though it did occur to them to consider protection before their first time. As far as they both know they’re clean, and even if they weren’t, would it matter? Here and now? The world’s fucking over. In the end, they each came to their own separate conclusions that it wouldn’t.
With a hum, Dean drops said pen to the table with a clatter and taps his foot against the floor. “I’ll make you a deal,” he offers, hand reaching out across the table, palm up,
“Meg,” Castiel says tentatively, watching as she uses chopsticks to pop a California roll into her mouth and chews. “There’s more. Specifically, I think I may be falling short in giving Dean what he needs in aftercare. I’ve been leaving his side, denying myself certain affections for self-preservation purposes. Only after he seems to be fully recovered or has fallen asleep, of course, but I’m concerned that it’s not enough. I fear—”
The sight of him catches Dean off-guard, sends an avalanche of recent memories cascading through his head. The sound of Cas’ pleading voicemail echoes in Dean’s ears even as snatches of his own awful, embarrassing proposal flit across his mind. Unaware of Dean’s building inner turmoil, Castiel’s eyes lock fiercely with his from across the room.
Today is no exception. Castiel kicks his shoes off immediately, ripping his sweater over his head and dropping it to the floor in their wake. And
“C’mon,” Dean says, waving his arm for Castiel to follow as he steps past a small reception desk and up three more stone steps into an adjacent room, and Castiel follows, curious and wide-eyed. If he’d found the atrium impressive, he’s not sure that he has words for the Winchesters’ actual workspace.
to become a murderous, raping asshole. You buy, beg, and steal your way to the top of the food chain, and it all gets taken away by
so damn much that he can hardly fuckin’ breathe. Instead of stressing about it, Dean just searches out Castiel’s mouth and kisses him harder. He lets the friction of their bodies and the way Cas’ knot begins to swell and tug at his rim buoy and sweep him over the edge until he’s spilling between them with a loud moan.
and about to be caught and punished at any moment. Of all the things he expected from his next contact with Dean, this was nowhere near the top of his list.
a single tear spilling out of his right eye and rolling down his cheek. Castiel wastes no time—he surges forward, climbs into Dean’s lap and frames his face with both hands. “Are you my sub, Dean?” he demands. “Are you?”
“If Jo won’t do it, then go get Rowena then!” Dean screamed at Sam. “Don’t let her use the last of her stuff on Carl—”
He does, slumping down onto one of the bar stools with a sigh and playing with a shiny apple he pulls from the fruit bowl. “I’ve just… been reconsidering some things, lately. Things that I may have previously taken for granted. And I’m finding out that very little is either entirely black or entirely white. All of these… neat little boxes where I’ve kept so many of my thoughts and beliefs, I guess—well, for lack of a better descriptor, many have come spilling out.”
“Uh, Dean? You have a little…” Sam wiped at the corner of his lips and Dean quickly raised his sleeve to catch whatever drool was apparently leaking out of his mouth. Sam was leaning over the back of Dean’s bench seat with his arms crossed, smirking knowingly as he looked between Castiel and Dean.
As soon as he’s finished, Sam jumps up on the bed, circling once before laying down and closing his eyes like he’s perfectly at home here, not a care in the world. Watching from across the room, Dean can’t help but feel just a touch envious. He leaves Sam behind to go check on Castiel, holding the surprisingly sturdy railing as he strides down the wooden steps back to the first floor. He would have thought stairs would take up an excessive amount of room in a space like this, but these are flush up against one of the side walls and hardly intrusive.
Nothing really changes. Castiel is plenty competent as a hunter without any of his celestial abilities, and his talents in bed were learned and perfected as a human. The days and weeks and months continue to tick on by, and if Castiel had to describe Dean in one word, it would be
in their third-floor loft, and Castiel can’t even bury his head underneath a pillow without feeling like he’s on the verge of suffocating.
Neither Castiel nor Naomi bought that rehearsed version of events, though, and Castiel didn’t think the Board would, either. Mostly because it left no reasonable explanation for what
of the time, and Dean only ever looks at her as he should. As a charge, as a friend, perhaps sometimes as a co-conspirator—
“I’m with you,” he replies quickly as Sam looks on uncertainly, hand poised over the Mac 4 blade he’s picked out to intubate Dean with. Sam knows Castiel’s lying, knows he shouldn’t be anywhere near Dean’s medical care right now, but needs must, and EMS is always about doing the best you can with what little you have. Always about saving lives and making things happen
having a bottle squirreled away is a hell of an interesting surprise. Clearly, Castiel isn’t the blushing virgin Dean assumed him to be, proving that to be the case when he also mutters the incantation to prevent either of them from catching any germs the other might have, so they can skip the condom. “Holy fuck,” Dean remarks. “Where’d you learn to do that? I could never get the—” he waves his hand around between them. “You know, the intonation right.”
Balthazar and Gabriel were grinning at them, Gabe even going so far as to plant his chin in his hand and look playfully enamoured. “Please,” the trickster said, waving at hand at them, “don’t stop the lovey dovey smooches on account of the room full of people watching you. Carry on.”
did,” Sam argues. “And there was always the chance that whatever he was hiding was missed or moved back in
“On deck.” Chuck, the set designer and assistant stage manager confirms to everyone that the company is in place and ready to explode onto the stage for their opening number.
When they don’t say anything else, a confused Jimmy eventually pronounces them married to a chorus of slightly-delayed cheers and clapping, but Castiel is too busy kissing Dean to pay anyone else any mind.
Maria creeped around the side of the main building, determined to steal herself some Twizzlers...and some Snickers, if she was lucky. With a tiny grunt, the girl lifted herself up over the side of the front porch after throwing her bag of marshmallows up first. She was short and little for her age, but she was crafty. Once she’d hauled herself up, Maria snatched up her shmellows and tiptoed towards the front door.
and Castiel’s never been more human than he is now, today. In fact—and judging by how virtually unfazed both Sam and Eileen appear as they take in their surroundings—he might be
“See?” Dean enthuses, waving one hand around, the other on the wheel. “Amelia made her own choices, but so did you. Claire’s awesome. I know she doesn’t always show it, but that girl thinks the sun shines out of your ass. Believe me.”
“Don’t do that,” Cain swiftly chastises in return. That same, knowing little smile tugs at the side of his mouth. “I’m not your father.”
Dean groaned, throwing his head back. “Great, ‘cause I just love reading. Was this how Kevin felt when I wanted him to read the tablets fast?”
