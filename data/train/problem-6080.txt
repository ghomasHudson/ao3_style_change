kind of pride. He'd felt nothing like it before. It got him more than he could have hoped for back in his twenties, when he thought (and maybe hoped) he'd die in the war, fighting the good fight. He had access to a better team than any could have asked for. He had more resources to do good than he ever thought he would, and God, the love he was able to feel was astronomical.
He was happy with his own second chance, as well. He'd learned more than he ever thought he'd learn in his life- more than his know-it-all 20-something year old self thought was out there to know. He made his friends, he built his family, he fought alongside them and he fought them themselves, and he learned.
“That’s the only reason?” he asked. His tone was a little quiet, a little sly— it was intended to be a joke, but Steve didn’t seem certain he could take it that way, if the stiffening of his shoulders was any indication.
, no more complicated than that. It wasn't as if Tony's curiosity had been stamped down completely-- quite the contrary, in fact, as his relentless drive to learn more, learn better, learn quicker overtook him. It just happened to be... put to better things, in the end. He could certainly put a twist on his projects, just to keep them interesting, but they were ultimately for people more deserving than him of the freedom required to ask trivial questions and treat their answers with the utmost importance, day after day after day.
It was almost for naught, as the sharp knock on his door nearly startled him into losing his balance anyway, but he caught himself before he could stumble. He rinsed his mouth out, slipped on the complimentary robe from the bathroom closet, and went to go answer it.
The man looked bright and spirited and well-loved, and the lines that had seemed sloppy before looked nervous now, as if their creator had been fighting with himself to get them right.
He was polite, Steve thought, in a strange sort of way. He clearly didn’t expect people to be so polite in return; the one time Steve himself asked, “May I be invited in?” as he stood in the doorway of Tony’s laboratory in the dead of night, Tony gave him a funny look, almost as if he wasn’t sure what to make of the question. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d even say Tony looked taken aback.
It felt like Tony didn’t know him enough sometimes, that was all, like every impression he made was a first impression again. And maybe it was selfish, maybe it was cowardly, maybe it was some stupid thought for stupid men who didn’t know any better than to care more about themselves than anyone else in times of tragedy— Steve thought distantly of his father, of the climate, of the hurt— but he didn’t like that.
“Here,” he said, grabbing a creme dress shirt and a dark brown, almost black, pair of dress pants. He set those on the bed beside Steve, stepping away one more time to reach into Jan’s accessory bin. Out came a pair of leather suspenders, coupled with a bowtie.
Tony urged Steve to sit against the headboard again, half-looking up through his lashes as Steve got into position. He couldn’t quite make eye contact, then, couldn’t quite focus on anything other than the task at hand lest he take himself out of the moment again.
The first fix was relatively simple, and Steve had a difficult time commending Hydra (he thought it was Hydra, at least, but there was no way of confirming-- he didn't recognize the cell he'd been placed in as anything he'd seen before) for something so simple.
He knew he cared. But it had been so long, and he'd spent so many years being told not to concern himself with trivial things like this that to return to the questions he'd had so long ago felt strange, almost forbidden. Don't dig too deep. Don't look too hard. Let it be what it is.
it himself, so many times over that sometimes Tony’s in awe of it— in a not-so-great way, of course, like someone might be in awe of an oil spill or all the waste in the seas. He feels small next to Bucky sometimes, feels like his pain’s not quite as deserved.
Perhaps preemptively, Tony found himself mourning the night they could have spent together. If barely-earned grief was a pool, he was just dipping his toes in when Steve interrupted him:
Steve had been sat down on the hard, almost purely decorative couch of Marshall’s too-big living room (and he wondered for a moment what made Tony’s living room just the right size, as the square footage, he thought, probably didn’t differ much) for an hour at that point, unable to catch a break or slip away. Tony’s voice, at least, popped in every so often to crack jokes at Marshall’s expense or check in to see how Steve was faring.
It was a nice design choice, Steve thought. It looked expensive. It looked almost comically stereotypical.
Tony used his umbrella quite like a cane at times, though Steve wasn’t entirely sure why. He assumed it might have been related to the fatigue, which might have been related to the iron deficiency, which might have been related to his diet. But Steve didn’t want to comment on his diet- again, Tony was rather touchy about it, for reasons unknown to him- so he simply allowed Tony his space and his comfort.
Tony barely ate at all, from what Steve could see. He didn’t smell food in the night, either, so Tony must have been eating milder foods. He had specific dietary restrictions when he ate with the team (which was a rarity in and of itself): no garlic, no silverware, and, if it could be helped, nothing too pungent (garlic, he supposed, was especially pungent). Eccentric, indeed.
Tony made no effort to speak to them. He chose a seat at the far end of the bar, his face turned away from the rest of the patrons. He ordered one drink. He waited for that friend of his to show up.
That was the kind of warmth he wanted for Tony, outside of literal terms. The kind of warmth you could wrap yourself up in. The kind of warmth that made you feel at home.
“No, it’s good, it’s good,” Tony reassured him. “It’s good. I don’t— I don’t know what’s happening here, actually.” He huffed out an awkward, nervous laugh, met with an answering laugh from Steve. It sounded wholly unconvinced and completely discordant with the half-concerned expression on his face.
Maybe he was thinking too broadly. There was hardly room for personal costs when the dream- the dream he represented, the dream he defended- had become him. That was what he believed for a short while, anyway, after Bucky's death. It was what he had to believe. There was no Steve Rogers to mourn him anymore- not one his mother would recognize. There was Captain America, and Captain America stood up for what was right, and Captain America would fight when the men around him fell because otherwise, they would have fallen in vain.
And Tony looked through, as promised, and found that nothing had changed. There was no point at which the man on the page wasn’t absolutely shining, even when rain-drenched or sleeping messily on the couch or irritably sipping from a beaker-shaped mug of coffee. Tony wasn’t friendly with mirrors, barely even looking at them when he got his damn hair cut, and this was effectively the emotional equivalent of a mirror with a ring light and a 10x magnifier, tinted rose for good measure.
But sometimes he went down. Sometimes, he didn't wake up easy. Sometimes, he woke up strapped to tables, or chairs, or walls (which were the least comfortable, he'd found, as gravity made everything dig into your skin
But he could say that he memorized the color of Steve's eyes. He could pick it out on a color wheel. He could tell you that Steve's eyes were more deep blue than teal, ever so slightly more purple than green, with a dark ring around his pupils and light flecks like a Jackson Pollock stretching from the center of his eye to the outer circle. There were more shades in Steve's eyes than there were in crashing waves and nebulas. There was more complexity to his irises than there was to all the stars in the sky, pushing and pulling and falling and turning.
He’d heard plenty of accounts of people who felt as if the years became shorter with time. They weren’t unimportant people by any means. In fact, it seemed perfectly
They’d fallen into Tony’s plush, expensive bed together, tumbling downward in a mess of cheap fabrics and silly props, and they’d possibly been as excited and uncoordinated as they were when they were teenagers. Tony laughed, and Steve laughed with him, thinking his laugh to be the most recognizable and most gorgeous laugh of all with its low, rich timbre.
“Okay,” Jan started, nabbing something off the rack. She held the hanger up, revealing a pristine white jumpsuit with flared bottoms, a popped collar, and a deep V. “Here.”
Had he been less stubborn, perhaps he'd be allowed more freedom. That was one thing he admired about Tony, and it was one thing Tony did that frustrated the hell out of him.
The gentleman he was, he did try to let Tony go, to pull Tony’s head back. Tony insisted, though, pulling back enough that he could swallow painlessly. He was gentler through the aftershocks of Steve’s orgasm, his movements smaller and more deliberately soft.
Tony shrugged. He rested his hand on the table where his phone lay, running his thumb over the volume buttons as he spoke: “Something tells me the personality flaws don’t end with the tie.” It was a casual enough quip that it almost went in one ear and out the other for Steve, his gaze fixed on the small movements of Tony’s finger, on his long, slender fingers and small electrical burns on the side of his hand.
It was an easy sentiment to adopt, and one that could have saved him quite a bit of grief throughout his life; it allowed for simplicity with objective antagonists to the more broad global view of the dream he'd been defending all his life (freedom, that was, in its purest and most thriving form), and it allowed for complexity in how he'd handle his allies.
, their gazes lingered, moments longer than Tony thought was normal. Whether or not it was reality or just a figment of his imagination-- his brain longing to stretch those moments out into infinity-- he couldn't say for certain.
That was all Tony needed to repeat the movement, inching down further and further with each passing second. Before Steve was too deep inside of him for the movement to be rendered null, he swallowed around what he could; the answering jerk of Steve’s hips was praise enough for Tony, shocking and sudden as it was.
“It’s 50 degrees out,” Steve argued still. He’d give up any opportunity to admire Tony’s figure for the sake of Tony’s comfort.
He couldn’t coax it out of himself. No affirmations registered as anything but noise. He grew lonelier, more frustrated, more isolated. At times, it seemed best that isolation led him to a disconnect from himself— after all, he was most effective without distractions, wasn’t he? He was the most equipped for all the altruism he hoped he was capable of, wasn’t he?
“And here I was thinking it couldn’t get worse. What’s him being a twink got to do with it? You know, back in my day—”
He was laying in bed with that god-awful pillow hugged to his chest as he tried to fall asleep- the last step of his "daily" routine- when one of those blindingly white walls collapsed violently in on itself to reveal a vibrant array of colors Steve hadn't seen in ages. There were blues and purples. There were oranges and yellows, and Steve hadn't even
Walking through the mansion alone could be considered a “walk,” Steve thought. It was a large place, and the rooms were all localized on one side of it. There were a handful of exits dotted around, but Tony always made a show of using the front door. It was grandiose and almost ill-fitting, as if it was built separately from the rest of the building and tacked on at the end. Most of the walls, the counters, and floors- the chairs and tables, even- were made of a dark brown wood with reddish undertones. The front doors, though, were almost cherry. Its accents were gold, spreading upward from the bottom corners as if creeping up the sides like vines.
He might’ve been able to sort his thoughts more clearly if he weren’t so focused on Steve’s silhouette atop him, the ceiling light blurring like a halo around the edges of Steve’s form. Wisps of Steve’s hair fell forward, swaying with his movement.
It was the love without the attention, Steve thought. It used to feel horribly isolating in the beginning, back before Steve had found where he belonged. But it became familiar as all things did with time, and if he listened closely, he could still pick out Jan’s pixie laughs and Sam’s squawks and Peter’s many mouths chattering away excitedly.
He watched Tony’s hand— slim, a little bony, with callouses on the tips of his fingers— trace over his own abdomen, down the line of his happy trail and along the inside his thigh. He spotted the funny little quirk in Tony’s brow when he examined his own skin, seemingly surprised at the lack of spend there.
It was a beautiful sentiment from a beautiful man. Truth be told, though, Steve didn’t think it was possible to make up for lost time. He didn’t think he’d ever have enough time with Tony; the guy was on his mind constantly, taking up space in every corner of his mind, even when the world was at its end. They could spend the rest of their lives together and Steve would still want more, would still hope and pray that they’d meet again after that.
“Yeah,” he agrees, his voice understandably dull. He’s trying too, though. Tony can tell. “I’ll just get changed.”
“Are you--” His nose scrunched up as he searched for the scent once more, but he couldn’t quite find it anymore. “Tony, are you alright?”
would bring to surface, but he knew well when he was being othered.  “What you said would be offensive.”
One of them had passed out already, he heard. RB2-B. The treatment was ineffective. The other two were responding as expected, he heard.
The color blue, Tony had learned some years ago in school, rarely occurred in nature. And the things that
He didn’t realize how hard he was until Steve touched him. It was almost painful, too much, but Steve continued on. He wrapped his hand loosely around Tony’s hard-on, thumb gently caressing under the head, and began to stroke him.
Marshall’s home was about what Steve would expect from a man like him. It was both sparsely decorated and excessive, the few pieces he
“That was a compliment to Mr. Stark. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve received no compliments tonight.”
In the fridge was a glass tupperware with already-cut lemon slices. It was a nice little touch, Steve thought— something Tony mentioned once upon a time, something that made him feel less like he was having a nurse come in to fill up his ‘thirst’ meter and more like he was staying at a luxury hotel with butler service. He said it like a joke, and mostly, it was.
They could have known each other from the moment they opened their eyes, and it still wouldn’t be enough time.
The Black Knight glanced down at his hands, seeming half shocked and half impressed with himself. “I struck in desperation—
“You make a habit out of drinking like that?” he asked. He had the voice of a Manhattanite, though not quite the stature of one. He seemed to be hiding himself almost as much as Tony was, his coat wrapped tight around him and his head bent down ever so slightly. He barely turned his head to look at Tony as he spoke, and Tony could recognize the action; he was trying, however unsuccessfully, not to show his face. His hair alone was unique, a little long and a little wispy, unkempt and wild enough that it covered his eyes when he shifted or jerked.
Tony, more often than not, wore the armor to meetings like this. Regardless of whether he was going to actively participate in the missions discussed or not, he treated the armor like a uniform. The suit was for Tony Stark. The armor was for Iron Man. Though Steve couldn’t quite tell the difference— both were plain old Shellhead in his mind— he supposed he could empathize to some extent. He always felt more
The Black Knight seemed worn from the effort of his valiant swing, Goliath’s hand coming down to steady him. He leaned into the weight of it, huffing out a tired, but victorious laugh. Steve couldn’t help but match the smile.
Steve felt it would be unfair to associate everyone in the bar with this man. After all, it was unlikely that his behavior was representative of everyone’s, and while Steve wasn’t
The longer he was gone, though, the harder it was to worry. He felt so separate from his family, then. Sometimes, he felt as if he didn't exist at all.
He always wondered how he never resented them, not even for a moment. And now he thinks he knows. He turned all of it inward.
Tony nodded. Uncertainly, Steve pulled the bin closer, sitting aside so Tony could do what he would with them.
Steve thought of him in kind; his mind fluttered back to his hopeful fantasy of a sun-kissed Tony smiling in the day, but more realistically (and more seriously, he thought, as he loved no version of Tony more than the tangible one), the Tony who was always in the shade and covered head-to-toe in gorgeous thin fabrics, draping across his body weightlessly and gently.
Steve didn’t look any different. He didn’t look any more hesitant or any less eager than he did just moments before.
“Hey,” Steve greeted, entering the hotel room with a brown paper bag in hand. “I, uh, hope you don’t mind me stopping by. I brought breakfast.”
Steve laughed then, too, more genuine than he had before. He seemed less concerned, too, though he wasn’t entirely without the worry in his brow. “Yeah, well, the real thing was better. 3-Dimensional, and all. And I don’t think I knew how big it was, anyway, what with the skinny pants and all.”
Steve thought, and he thought everyone thought the same when they looked at Tony, whose skin was clear and fair and soft. His cheekbones were sunken in a way that would befit a corpse, though he somehow managed to look the most lively out of anyone on the team. His eyes were light (almost white), his gaze piercing, and his lips were red in a way that looked both natural and painted on, as if he were a work of art walking alongside all the average Joe’s in the world.
“You’re just…” Glancing down thoughtfully at the checkerboard dance floor, Tony allowed his words to trail off into nothing.
It was surreal, almost. It didn’t hit him so hard most days— he was home, after all, having grown accustomed to the ways of the world and the family he’d built for himself— but standing there in what felt like an upscale Hollywood dressing room was certainly something.
“I thought the note was supposed to be the goodbye.”  Tony took a seat beside Steve, bringing his knees up onto the mattress and leaning over to get a peek at the bag.
“Seriously, what do you do to me?” Tony leaned against Steve’s side, reaching over his arm to flip to the next page. “You make me skinnier, don’t you?”
It was dark out by then. The shadows wrapped around him, bled into the black of his suit, kept him in one piece as he walked along. Outside, it was quiet. People kept their heads down, for the most part— truly, Paris had never been so tired. It was as if the whole of the city had been battery powered all this time, and someone finally ran the charge down.
They had a sweet few minutes together, tangled together like that- like one being- and then Tony slipped off of Steve, retreating to the bathroom to prepare for bed.
Tony felt sick the way he always did when he was a little too loved. It was, again, a feeling wholly disconnected from desire— it was the feeling of wings set aflame by the sun. It was the aftermath of warmth, perhaps a few hours too early.
Tony closed the door quietly behind Steve, eyes slightly widened in disbelief as he watched Steve plop down on the edge of the bed. He huffed out a laugh, averted his gaze. “Uh, no, I— That’s really… I didn’t expect this.”
This time, when he woke up, he was strapped down to a cold metal table. The restraints weren't so intense; each wrist was cuffed to the side of the table closest to it, each ankle the same. There was a strap holding his forehead down. Under different circumstances, he was sure he'd be able to break out of these easily, but there was something foggy and not-quite-right with the way the room looked flat and distant and the way his body felt so heavy- as if it were melting into the table itself- that made him believe struggling wasn't going to do much for him at all.
“Yeah.” Tony’s voice was quiet, then. When he looked back up at Steve, he offered a small smile. It was nervous, but it was a smile nonetheless.
At that point in his life, he was so much angrier. He was so much more frustrated. He was so obsessed with this idea of righteousness and human freedom, this idealistic version of it he'd seen stripped away from so many who were helpless to allow the abuse, and he concluded: never.
Steve sighed, shifting closer to where Tony was on the bed so he could get an arm around the guy. Casual as it was, it was like fireworks had gone off on his nerve endings, skin set alight where Steve touched him.
Steve shrugged in a dismissive sort of gesture, leaning over to press a kiss to Tony’s temple before shimmying out of the bed. He crumpled the paper bag up and tossed it idly from one hand to the other, not quite ready to leave. “I’ve gotta head back about now. It was real, real nice to spend that night with you, Tony. Thanks for letting me have breakfast with you.”
It was a childish way of viewing it, perhaps, but he couldn’t help himself; what did he want, if not someone to hold and to hold him? What did he want, truly? He would have liked to be a do-gooder, but there was no identity in that. There was nothing but the right thing— no Tony Stark, no nights of blissful romance, no indulgence nor fulfillment. The
was, Tony had offered to do the same, making it a battle of who could be more insistent about the whole thing). He’d set a hand on the small of Tony’s back as they walked through the halls, which were eerily quiet, eerily empty. The team was probably trying to give them space or something. Steve wasn’t going to complain.
grateful. He’s just weighed down by it, unwillingly grounded by it, and he’s so tired of being chained down to reality like this.
“Well, lucky for you, I might be able to swing a, uh,” Steve looked Tony up and down, assessing him, “tall… brunette kink.”
He looks around himself, now, at the too-neat walls of the penthouse and the cute, comfortable decor he and Steve picked out together. He looks at the home he doesn’t deserve, the home that could be piled ceiling-high with the bodies of those he’s failed— friends, lovers,
“’Course.” Steve slipped a hand into his pocket, feeling around for the little device. It was about the size of a micro USB and, as promised, not visible through the fabric of the pants’ pockets. He’d find Marshall… seduce Marshall, get to his place, find his personal computer, and insert the drive. Tony would take it from there. It was an easy plan, Steve knew. For them, at least. Still, years of things going south in spy and action films had him antsy.
Steve thought he might have liked to comment on the undertones of Tony’s hair in the light or the shine of his eyes outside (perhaps even the sun-kissed pinkness across his nose and cheeks if he was blessed enough), but the umbrella’s shade was cast over the entirety of his face, and Steve was left to speculate.
“Steve,” Tony responded. He stopped fidgeting, stopped looking, and- very realistically- he might have even stopped thinking, because Steve couldn’t have imagined a contemplative and serious Tony saying the words he’d said next. “Would you like to come to bed with me?”
Tony felt light with relief, so light that he could barely ground himself enough to approach Steve, grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him into a long, deep kiss. Steve let the crumpled bag fall out of his grasp to set a hand on Tony’s waist, pulling him in ever closer, like they’d never be close enough.
It was an easy flight home. Steve was able to relax, finally, for the first time in... well, he hadn't asked yet, but he'd figure out soon enough. Tony was used to having passengers, but he was more delicate with Steve in the moment than he would have been on any other day. He landed gently on the balcony of the penthouse, stepping out of the suit the second Steve was supporting himself on his own two feet.
They headed back to the mansion, the nerves came flooding back, and it wasn’t quite as nice as it had been all night. It wasn’t like Steve could follow any sort of standard procedure; they lived across the hall from each other, and any ‘I’ll walk you home’ sentiment might have been a little redundant. He didn’t want to kiss Tony and overstep boundaries. He didn’t want to
Rose bouquet in hand, he knocked on the door of the conference room, gently pushing it open. Tony and Carol were standing over some large schematic spread over the table with edges crinkled and half falling over, Carol’s hand on Tony’s back as they spoke. They both looked up at Steve as he entered, Tony standing a little straighter at the sight.
He realized what it was they were trying to do. He was certain, at least in the beginning, that it wouldn't affect him so much. He'd been through worse, hadn't he?
“You’re getting water,” he said, glancing back to find Tony staring almost blankly back at him. They stayed like that for a long moment, long enough for Steve to wonder if Tony was any closer to remembering his name this morning than he was the morning prior.
“No, I.” Steve held the flowers out for Tony, an earnest but nervous smile on his face. “I was hoping I’d get to go on an impressionist-lesbian-painting type first date with you, actually.”
Steve didn’t push it. He simply slipped the coat on himself, though he knew he didn’t need so much warmth. If Tony needed it, Steve would have it on hand.
Steve huffed out a laugh, bumping his shoulder lightly against Tony’s. “No worries, Shellhead. No harm, no foul.”
met Steve’s eyes- for the first time since their meeting. What he found was impossible to decipher. Steve stared back at him, brows furrowed ever so slightly, expression fixed but neutral.
“I heard you walking.” Iron Man shrugged, taking a step forward to stand beside Steve. He crossed his arms, and the helmet tilted ever so slightly upward; even in the dimly lit room in the middle of night, he could make out those ice blue eyes of Iron Man’s, focused on the image Steve had been looking at moments prior. “I figured I would keep you company.”
And then he forced himself to look up, following the lines of scar tissue to the metal disc embedded in Steve’s chest. Raised white lines of skin branched out from it like roots.
Tony wished he could have said the mess of metal clinging freakishly to Steve’s chest was the first thing his eyes were drawn to. It might have been some distorted sort of narcissism guiding his eyes; his gaze fell immediately to Steve’s awkwardly protruding ribs, a sight Tony had seen in the mirror a handful of times. Tony noticed the line of Steve’s hips and the bruises on his sides.
“Given how hard you are right now after almost nothing, Steve, I don’t think there’s anything you could say to me to convince me you don’t already have one.”
Instantly, Jan appeared, landing lightly on her feet with what Steve could only describe as a squee. “Oh my God, I’m sorry, I just had to be a wasp on the wall. Tony, dear, c’mon. I’m gonna get you dressed.”
He’ll never mention it. He won’t put that on anyone else’s shoulders. And part of him is worried about what it might turn into, what banter might arise from it;
of Steve’s head falling back against the headboard, and he couldn’t quite keep himself from smiling as he pulled back. “Who am I to deny you something you’d like so much?”
The room was modest enough, though not lacking in its amenities. It was small but neat; the bedsheets were folded crisply, and there were two floor-to-ceiling windows hugging the room’s corner. The curtains, pillows, and walls were bathed in a pleasant, calming tone of blue. It may have been the nicest place Steve had seen in months, if not longer.
Anthony Stark was a tallish, thinnish man. His cheeks were sunken, but only slightly; he looked hollow those days, more hollow than he used to. His mustache wasn’t as neat as he usually kept it, his hair mussed. Needless to say, he didn’t look quite like himself.
He hated to frame it like this, but it didn’t feel like anything more than… theft of property, as if someone had stolen a gun off Bucky’s rack or an arrow from Clint’s quiver. He was more concerned about the implications, more concerned about the damage it could cause, more concerned about the fact that he’d
at the flowers, his eyes darting from petal to petal like he didn’t quite know what to do with them.
It’s almost thrilling, to be so careless. It reminds him of his youth— of the youth he saw in his youth, at least, as he was rarely more than a spectator to the antics of others. But every so often, he’d be roped into something  reckless, something dangerous, and he’d feel the same bittersweet thrill that came with violent risk taking at any cost.
“Just—” His hips twitched, his words coming to a brief, stuttering stop. “Just make me come, please.”
wrong with this, of course, as most of the time, it allowed Steve to escape his captors before he could ever really be considered a "victim of kidnapping."
“Lovely.” Marshall flagged the bartender down, offering a smile. “Two bourbons. Neat.” He turned to Steve, then, reaching out to fiddle with the buckle on Steve’s suspenders. “Call me Jack, by the way.”
Tony took the bagel that was handed to him, staring down at it almost like he’d never seen one before. He just wasn’t quite with the program yet, didn’t know how to handle the— well, the fuck-buddy-turned-breakfast-partner ordeal.
“Well.” Steve paused. He set the glass aside, folding his arms in front of himself. “I’m sorry, truly, but.” He nodded his head toward the group Tony had pointed out earlier. “Better to be cautious about that kind of thing.”
Steve tried to force the tension out of limbs. He could still feel the ghost of a hand on his back, the acute and sudden self-awareness of how flush against himself the waistband of his pants was. His shirt felt a little too tight then, the tie around his neck almost choking him.
Steve would say anyway, because what’s the alternative? What else would he think? Tony hasn’t given him any reason to think otherwise, has he?
“You much of a dancer, Cap?” Tony asked. His voice was clear, sharp as anything. If Steve closed his eyes, he could picture Tony beside him, murmuring in that same low tone. He almost missed the older comms, the ones with that sounded a little more static, tinnier. They always made Tony sound a little more Iron Man-like, in a way that was funny, charming, and comforting all at once.
Tony watched as Steve reached into his pocket, fumbling through its contents for a moment before pulling out something rectangular and shiny— shiny-ish, at least, in the way worn things tended to be. It was a little tin, the design on its top faded at the corners. It featured a nice woman on its front, sitting calmly with her legs to her side; her hair was short and poofy, her expression barely there. THREE ORIGINAL DUBLE-TIP PROPHYLATICS, the tin read, though some of the letters were lost with wear.
All together, they were a tank with mismatched wheels and chipped paint. No, not a tank- not a weapon- but a shield. A suit of armor. They were better together.
He grunted in response, settling back in bed beside Tony. He set a heavy hand on Tony’s forearm, thumb rubbing idly over the skin there as he fixed his gaze on the treetops and the sky just above them.
The metal underneath him was warming, and it was almost pleasant for a moment as it hit a point of warmth that wasn't so extreme. And then it kept going. And it kept going, and all over again, he felt like he'd been set aflame, and no amount of writhing could free him from his restraints.
They split a milkshake. Steve, with the sipping force of a goddamn hoover, drank 80% of it over the span of a few seconds. They split a second milkshake, and Steve restrained himself.
“And you, Kang, can do nothing to escape the flat of my ebony blade!” the Black Knight cried, bringing the blade down on the murderer called Kang with a heavy, violent swing. The man flew upward from the force of the swing, his body landing at the end of a perfect arc with a loud
Steve knew before he knew. All the pieces were there, and he knew they had to fit together, but it took him some time to really
goodbye,” he said, voice halfway muffled through the bite of bagel. “Any idea where you’re heading next?”
Tony would say, though it might sound like a bold-faced lie; his security’s not exactly lax, and the gun is hardly the first thing he’d reach for when the suit’s so close by.
It was so much all at once that Steve wasn't quite sure he felt anything at all. His body was loose, almost limp, when Tony pulled him into a tight hug.
Tony looked away from Steve to examine the walls in question. He hadn't thought much of them, but his understanding settled in as he recalled his brief glimpse of the stark white room in which Steve stayed.
Carol snapped the picture, turning the phone around to show Steve and Tony. “You guys thought I was a prom mom? You look like prom
“Mm.” Tony turned to face Steve, then, weakly pulling the blanket an inch or two further up his body. Steve took the edge of it, pulled it up harder, tucked it around Tony’s shoulders more comfortably. “Wake me up in half an hour?”
Once the shirt was open, Steve lightly pushed its sleeves down Tony’s arms. It was a suggestion, and after a moment of dumb staring, Tony got the hint and raised himself up enough for Steve to tug the shirt away and discard it. Steve smoothed his hand over Tony’s side, leaning down to trail his lips along Tony’s collarbone.
He couldn’t name them any longer. Some of them, he couldn’t place. He didn’t know whether he’d read them months ago or decades ago, and it was as funny as it was sad. He remembered one about a bird old enough to be wearing one of those big-hipped dresses with the corset top, somewhere in Maine away from the stresses of the real world. He remembered she was in a lighthouse or a cabin or something or another on the beach, and her husband was with her, drawing the blinds every night and opening them up every morning before she woke to make sure her first sight every day was of the water.
Steve got up. Steve fought. When it was right to fight- when the fighting was justified- Steve fought.
Right? He’s losing. And he can’t just lose like that, can’t just disappoint— can’t just take away a hero like that, the hero he never asked to be, the persona he never truly felt at home in. He’d spent so much of his life
in his tone. That was the way it was, though. Wasn't it? It wasn't a feeling. It wasn't a fleeting thought, nor was it a loosely held belief that fluttered in and out of his mind like anything else. It was a fact of life.
It was the love without the attention, Steve thought. Except this time, it was all the love he could hope for centralized in the body of the one man whose attention he was lucky enough to hold for a few moments. He still couldn’t believe it, sometimes, when Tony turned his gaze onto him and held it there thoughtfully.
He rested his head against Steve’s shoulder and, finally seeming willing to reciprocate something, Steve leaned back against him.
for the first time in years, really, and the thought of losing it to shaky concepts like duty and loyalty was agonizing.
Steve smiled, reaching out to give Iron Man’s back a firm pat. Iron Man bumped his elbow against Steve’s side in response, his eyes crinkling behind the mask.
“Could we split the difference?” Steve finally asked. It was reluctant, but he’d been reluctant going into this, anyway. All he wanted then was for the mission to run smoothly.
him, or whatever version of him Steve saw when their eyes met, and Tony felt a keen sense of insecurity at that, as if he and all the life he’d lived were smaller than these beautifully crafted paper idols, unable to live up to them.
Tony’s plans had fallen through, yes— but was he destined to go the night without someone warming his bed as he’d so desperately hoped? His something-of-a-lover had stood him up more than a few times, and for him to come all this way for nothing would be…
“Hey, I know men, too. I’ve been with men. And I can tell you that if this guy’s looking for some leather daddy or something, he’s not going to find it in the guy with the tight purple clothes. I mean, how many gay men tried to hit up Hawkeye in his skirt phase?”
Instantly, Steve felt he knew the play-by-play. All they had to do was apply it to the floor plan in front of them, wait for Captain Marvel to send Wasp for recon, and once they had some info on the security systems in place, they’d bring Iron Man and Black Widow in and put the break-in in motion.
He took the sketchbook from Steve’s loose grasp, staring down at the image it portrayed. A man— Tony Stark— sat loosely against the side of a bed in the early hours of the  morning, his robe half-slipping off of him and his knee bent to hold onto. His head was tilted downward, his eyes peering up fondly at the man with the pencil who’d sat behind the sketchbook as he was drawn. A mess of hair on his head stuck out in funny places, and there was a tiredness to the expression on his face that was sweet, content. It was messy and beautiful and tender in ways Tony didn’t think he could be.
Steve gave a little wave, the same sense of unease that had washed over him in the conference room returning to settle in his stomach like a rock. He took in the sight of Jan, who was, admittedly, wearing something that even Steve knew was tasteful— he’d say it was spy chic if he was asked, with a black skin-tight turtleneck, high waisted wide pants, and some fingerless gloves that he could personally appreciate. Tony was Tony, dressed how Tony dressed, and the whole scene felt right out of a movie. A movie about people that Steve, once upon a time, thought were too expensive for him to even
, then. It was really, truly safe, and not just in theory anymore. There was no need to sit by and hope desperately for someone like Captain America to save him, to pick him up when he fell. Not when Steve
He just… looked. Admired Tony’s features. Watched as he blinked and licked his lips and rolled his shoulders back. It wasn’t much, but given the lost souls Tony tended to pick up when he was seeking out bed partners, it was more than he was expecting.
to get Steve out again, to just— to just get him to leave. And Steve would. He’d get up, he’d turn around, he’d walk away. And Tony, selfishly, would put that bullet in his head knowing damn well Steve would come right back in, knowing damn well that Steve would find his body, hold his body, cry over his body—
“You know him?” Steve asked; if he were more fidgety a person, he might have shifted in his chair at the twinge of discomfort that radiated through his chest, but instead he sat still, his eyes on Tony.
The Grand-Master raised a hand; his whole body was alight with an aura Steve could feel against his skin, warm and cool on his skin all at once. “Now, I must depart for new games… new galaxies to conquer. And, as I restore you valiant ones to your long-ago mansion, think of Kang, and have
Tony raised a brow but complied, peeling himself away from Steve’s side to sit where instructed. He leaned back and rose a knee to hold, just to have something to do with his hands. Steve picked his pencil up again, flipping through a handful of books before finding one with some blank space in it. He leaned against the wall opposite Tony, set the sketchbook in his lap, and got to doodling. Every so often, his eyes flitted up to Tony, taking in the sight of him fully.
Because that’s the kind of person Tony is, isn’t he? Deluding himself into thinking he’s a man to clean up his own messes, ignorant to the plights of those who follow in the wake of his destruction, irradiated and disfigured by his mistakes.
He glanced up, caught his own reflection in Steve’s eyes, and couldn’t find a difference between himself and the man Steve had drawn so many times over.
Steve reached out with his free hand, appreciatively sliding his palm over Tony’s calf. It wasn’t too much of an intentional movement, seeming more like a natural impulse than anything else. It was sweet. Tony didn’t often feel casually desirable, wanted in the way that well-loved wives were when they received a goodbye kiss from their husband on his way out to work every morning, but Steve did something to him. He knew it wouldn’t last, but for these precious moments, at least, he could pretend like he’d wake up tomorrow morning and get to do this all over again.
“Mm, yeah,” Steve stroked a little quicker, then, his grip slightly more secure. “How would you best
“I was thinking, too, you know. About the you from the past, and all the fight he had in him. He was
“You better.” Steve tilted Tony’s face toward himself, and Tony caught another glimpse of the softness in Steve’s wandering eyes.
“Of course,” Steve answered. Tony lingered in the doorway for a moment more, and Steve added, “Come in.”
Steve set his hand on Tony’s chest, pushing him away ever so slightly. Once he had enough room to maneuver, his hand went to his pocket again. He presented Tony with a little packet of lube, the amused sparkle in his eyes clear as day.
the fuck out.”) Steve gets home Saturday. Their anniversary is next week. Of course, he has work on top of that.
Steve shifted awkwardly, taking a seat on the edge of the bed. He lightly ran the pad of his index finger over his nail, gaze focused on that small, repetitive movement as Jan and Tony spoke. They weren’t getting terribly heated, but they were both prone to talking a lot, and Steve
But as years passed for him, life seemed to stretch into infinity. At times, it came as a comfort; he could, at the very least, give himself grace for not yet finding that love he so desperately desired. At times, it was the opposite— a cruel reminder that there would be more days just like this one.
“And paint,” Steve added, then. The emotion in his voice was lacking, his tone neither certain nor uncertain, and it gave away very little, if anything at all.
Needless to say, it was uncomfortable. Tony found himself sucking in a breath, jutting his chin out— anything to hide the undesirable bits of him he thought Steve might catch sight of.
He lifted the sheets off of himself. He was about to stand when he saw the spots of red left on the cloth.
“That’s, uh.” The stranger turned his head a fraction of an inch more, and Tony caught a glimpse of his eyes, deep blue with a bit of a twinkle. “That’s classified.”
He could put a bullet in his head in a fit of anger, frustration, sadness, whatever it might be… and it’ll never be just for him. Some part of him will know, even in the end, that he’d have loved to be the kind of man who could guiltlessly overstay his welcome. But he’s not, and he won’t ever be— he could put a bullet in his head in a fit of every feeling he’s ever felt, and the ghost of him would kneel over his body, fading extremities shaking violently as he’d ask,
He felt Jack Marshall’s breath on the back of his neck before any words were spoken. A hand came to rest on his lower back, fingers teasing at Steve’s waistband. His mind went to the image inducer before any fears of violated privacy; he reached back and took hold of Marshall’s wrist, exercising great restraint as he pulled Marshall’s arm away from himself.
His breaths came in quick and shallow as they turned him back around. His back felt raw against the cold metal of the table. He was a resilient man, certainly- Steve Rogers was, at least- but this was so much after so long of so little, and he couldn't help but succumb to the overwhelming pain. His head lolled as far to the side as it was able to, and when he was finally able to open his eyes, he noticed a red spot of blood on the white coat of the man standing at the table's side.
“Three days out of surgery now,” he said. “Doc was in earlier. You didn’t wake up much. She said the amount of swelling was fine n’ they’d come by to drain it tomorrow.”
He didn't remember the next time they came to retrieve him, nor did he remember any time after that. What he
His hand rested on the doorknob for a few seconds of quiet, the shock of the sound having kick-started his brain. It felt as if, suddenly, his mind was alight, buzzing anxiously with what-ifs. Worst case scenario, someone had found him and Steve out, and they were coming to— Lord, he didn’t even know what they’d be coming to do, but they were coming to do it. Best case (and most likely) scenario, it was a housekeeper who forgot to say “housekeeping.”
Tony glanced back at the men. They seemed wholly disinterested in anything outside of their little bubble (aside from the occasional waitress passing by), disinterested enough that Tony didn’t understand the concern. He’d shared drinks with friends in the past before and few seemed to mind. It was almost shocking just how much you could get away with when the assumption was that you wouldn’t
“Oh, yeah? That’s something I’d like to see.” Steve let his hand slide down to the side of Tony’s face, his thumb affectionately stroking over Tony’s cheekbone. “You’re a dear.”
Steve set his free hand on the small of Tony’s back, pulling him in closer and jerking him off in earnest. He was quick, turning his closed fingers with each up motion. The pad of his thumb caught the head of Tony’s cock every single time he moved, and Tony, sensitive as he was at that point, didn’t take long to come hard, pitching forward against Steve and riding through the twitches of his body with Steve’s hand still on him.
Tony hummed thoughtfully, letting go of the book and resting his hand on Steve’s thigh instead. “… You, uh, fuck with the line weight? Make my lashes longer? Eyes a bit closer together? Shoulders a little broader?”
Another contradiction Steve found in Tony Stark: he was unpredictable and predictable. He was a rational man, clearly, and some would say he was too much of one. Steve figured you could throw a handful of variables into the mix again and again and, if you were smart enough, or if you had the tech to help you out with it, you could figure out what Tony would do under almost any set of circumstances. Steve thought Tony was consistent in beliefs and rationale, but inconsistent in actions; at the end of the day, he was under the assumption that Tony was just working with a different set of variables than Steve tended to.
of color, that any blue one could see was an illusion. Tony had fought back a little bit on the wording--
He knows his schedule inside and out, always as aware as he possibly can be; he has lunch with Jan on Thursday, an appointment with Bucky at some point the day after (his pinky finger’s been “freaking the fuck out”, Bucky’d said, “and there’s nothing really awful about that, but it freaks
He heard the word "sterilization" next, and after that came searing pain. It was a careless but generous splash of- of something hot and cold and sharp and awful, and it reeked of alcohol, and Steve couldn't-- God, he couldn't-- He could--
And the day had ended. And he thought, maybe, that Steve would have done the dirty work himself; he thought Steve might have woken him up early, might have kissed him once for courtesy, and then sent him on his way before the morning set in.
And so Tony kissed him, hoping desperately that they’d ebb and flow with each other more easily if they kept things unspoken. To his relief (delight, really), Steve set his hands on Tony’s waist, tugging him closer, pulling him back into the space between his legs and deepening the kiss.
It could have been explained away, but it wasn’t, and that fact alone was more damning than anything Tony’s active imagination could have dreamt up.
“No one’s deluded themselves into— Jesus, Tony,” Steve says, and Tony’s not sure whether he’s disappointed or just a victim of Tony’s ever-reaching projection.
The gun is a familiar weight in his hands, though it’s unsatisfying; the thought of any weapon being
Tony gasped, taking the bowl of popcorn out of Steve’s lap and setting it on the table. He swung a leg around Steve’s waist, half-straddling Steve’s lap enough to see him straight-on. He set one hand on either side of Steve’s face and squinted.
That wasn’t the case here. He’d been half hoping the guy was decent to lovers (prospective lovers, anyway), as he’d known a handful of… villainous people who were. Decent enough, at least. But this
This piece, larger than the others and less neatly done, was of an interesting-looking man with a smart grin on his face. The lines were sloppier, less clear, as if erased and re-done. The shadows seemed either poorly thought out or far too meticulously placed, facing multiple different directions and faded at the edges. The man’s skin was smudged, some of the hatching lost to touch, and his jawline didn’t sit quite right atop his neck. If Tony had to guess, he’d say this was one of Steve’s first drawings, or something he’d done after a bad fight. Technically, it wasn’t the most sound— until Tony’s gaze landed on the eyes and focused there, an uncomfortable feeling of familiarity settling in.
Steve reached down himself, then, and tugged his pants and underwear down enough to give himself some breathing room. He took his cock from the confines of his briefs, stroking it loosely with his free hand. Tony watched— if not to take a breather himself, then to see how Steve liked it, how he paced himself. The hand in Tony’s hair, thin and bony as it was, felt heavy where it lay. Steve’s fingers wrapped around a tuft, not pulling nor grabbing, but holding. Had Steve been the threatening type, Tony might have stiffened with anticipation.
It was hard to feel human, sometimes, when people didn’t want to look at you that way. All they saw were the tubes, the bandages, the monitors.
“Take a seat at the bar. Let him come to you. This is coming from one mega-rich guy with secrets; it’s less suspicious if you can let him think he’s in charge.”
“I was thinking,” Steve said again, “of how much he reminds me of that Time Traveller sometimes. He was all I could think about while we were back in France—
He'd dreamt of a rescue in the beginning. It wasn't as much a hopeful sort of thing as it was a fact of life bleeding into every thought he had. His team would come for him, and he knew it. He knew it. He dreamt of red, and he dreamt of gold, and Tony's icy blue or green or grey eyes and his maybe sharp-ish jaw, and he could practically
“I have. You look nice,” Tony insisted. It was a funny sort of misalignment; Tony knew damn well what Steve meant, but the urge to reassure him in whatever way possible was difficult to overcome. Tony wanted to say it, maybe because he’d wanted to hear it himself. Steve was all sorts of things— all sorts of things that Tony had been, too, though he knew they weren’t the same. They couldn’t be more different.
of time travel— reversing the polarity of the time axis within the boundaries of the time-space continuum, that is— but how one would even accomplish it? Why, it’s magic; rather, it’s science we simply haven’t pinned down yet.”
Tony reached up, fingers delicately outstretched. His movements were slow and careful as he watched Steve’s face for any sign of discomfort.
of a t-shirt, at least, made out of some kind of dense mesh material— dense, at least, in most areas. There was a panel accenting the abs, the mesh inside of it more transparent and less tightly packed. The transparency traced downward from the navel, curving along the insides of his thighs and leading downward. Now, Steve knew his hair was fine; it was thin, wispy, and so light that you could hardly see it against his arms just by looking at him, but he still felt there was hair down there that would be a little… exposed in clothing like that. It wasn’t the most comforting thought.
“Haven’t been since 1926, Shellhead,” he answered, bringing a hand up to wipe across his mouth to hide that he was speaking.
“Sorry, sorry,” Steve huffed out under his breath, apologetically caressing the nape of Tony’s neck.
He can think his way out of just about anything. He’s gotten this far with that method, but something tells him it won’t work tonight. Maybe preserving his state of mind isn’t quite worth the effort anymore.
He observed Steve closely, staring into that inscrutable bluish gaze— though deep as the sea, there was a warmth to them Tony hoped he wasn’t imagining. Was it a lovely, radiating warmth to draw Tony in?
Steve raised his head from the skin he’d been loving on, gently touching his nose to Tony’s. He stayed like that— close— for a long, quiet moment, and Tony wondered whether he’d spoken at all or just imagined what it might be like if he did.
“Hey,” Steve whispered against Tony’s skin, taking hold of Tony’s wrist to stop him. “Let’s keep that on, for now.”
“Well, I can’t say I’ve ever brewed my own beer, but. Looks nice enough. Can’t say the fittedness’ll feel any different from my dress greens.”
“Well, he looks both like he’s gay and like he’d brew his own beer,” Tony answered. “And the leather’s— well, there’s the implication.
“You make me look good,” he half-teased, wiping the tears from his blurring vision to look back down at the paper. “God, I could be a model in these books.”
He looked at Tony- the real Tony, standing in front of him with his face covered in shade and his skin light as ever- and Tony looked back, and they shared a smile.
"Steve." Tony’s insistence was weak; he didn’t seem particularly vehement about going against Steve’s wishes, and whether it was for Steve’s sake or his own, Steve couldn’t tell. If the circumstances were different, he might have been stricter, but. They were both tired. They both clearly missed each other.
just given up. Maybe he was leaving it up to the team to find him. But that wasn't like him, was it? He couldn't stop fighting now. They must have been drugging him. There must have been something in the food, something in the IVs, something in the air.
He steps closer, closes what little distance is in between them, and wraps his arms tight around Tony. Tony sighs, lets his weight fall against the solid mass of Steve’s body.
“Aye, Panther, for I do sense that we are truly of one mind!” Thor, in contrast, was  boisterous. He took up space and used it well. He reminded Steve of friends he’d made among the soldiers he’d fought with— after a few drinks, at least. His voice held the kind of warmth one might feel after having a drink themselves. “Though the Black Night was not one of us when he struck, we now should make him so!”
“… I’m not really dressed for the occasion.” He gestured to the armor he was wearing. Despite his answer, he did take the flowers from Steve. His movements were slowed— he even took a little while to
Oh, that was beautiful. Wasn't it? Red, like Tony's robes and his lingerie, and his sheets, and the paintings on his walls. Red like Tony's suit, and red like Tony's throw pillows, and red like the bouquets of roses Steve bought for Tony every anniversary they had. It was red like the silk tie Tony wore to most public events, and red like the gemstone on Tony's engagement ring, and it had been so long since Steve had seen that gorgeous, gorgeous color that for just a moment, the threat of tears was more pressing than the threat of pain.
“Uh-huh. Cap, take a look at this.” Tony held up a nice, bright dress shirt with a watercolor-like sunflower pattern. It was sweet-looking, almost out of place in the dimly lit hotel room with the moon and the stars in the backdrop behind them. It seemed apt for the outdoors, for a brighter, warmer day.
Steve half-shrugged. He took a sip of his (Tony’s) drink, taking a moment after to order that pitcher of water on Tony’s behalf. Tony could give him one thing, at least; he was assertive.
Steve’s expression was hard to read, then. Tony almost felt like he was talking to an old friend, or— god forbid he let his mind wander— a plain old boyfriend. Steve showed no signs of awkwardness. He wasn’t acting as if this was strange or new or anything of the sort. He looked, to put it simply, like he wanted to be there. He looked like he was content just to be around.
Chatter filled his ears, and though much of it was French (to be expected), there was a good number of men cheering and chatting away in bright American accents.
Steve clearly remembered a tinge of discomfort in Tony’s voice, as if a boundary had been crossed. Steve could understand why; he realized in the moment that he’d commented on Tony’s medical history without warning, and perhaps they weren’t quite close enough yet to feel concern for each other in that way.
And it was perfectly justified, and as temporary as any temporary thing could be. He gave Tony space, and Tony eventually got past the little crossing of boundaries. Steve was glad; they were better together.
The lemon water felt silly at first, too frilly and special to really register as anything meaningful. It was something a guy might drink on a hot day if he were rich or European, probably French. It was something ladies sipped at while they gossiped if they were watching their kids, too, and couldn’t break out a bottle of wine. It was that kind of drink— simple like Steve was, and delicate like Steve wasn’t.
This didn’t feel quite the same, though. Tony didn’t look at Steve and imagine another face, at least not for more than a moment. When Steve looked at him, there was nothing in his eyes nor expression suggesting he felt any differently. He didn’t look at Tony like a body to be used. He didn’t look at Tony like a morbidly pleasant tombstone of a past love.
He gets up, hands still trembling as he picks the gun up off the floor. It’s unclear in what direction it shot, and Tony’s not really of the mind to be finding bullet holes in the walls. He clicks the safety on himself, gaze lingering on the trigger for a moment too long before he shoves the whole thing a little too hard back into the nightstand, shutting the drawer.
He’d stopped, then, at an image hanging up of the Avengers in the main room of the building, just above the fireplace. It was sweet and homely, somewhat matching the feelings that blossomed in Steve’s own chest. He always felt that sense of not-quite-nostalgia after inducting a new recruit; there was some feeling of
Iron Man didn’t feel like a symbol any more than Tony Stark did. Even back in the day, before Steve knew they were one and the same, they both seemed to shoulder similar amounts of responsibility, similar weight.
Tony thought he could drown in them. It felt like it, truly, as Steve's gaze on him took his breath away every time.
Tony smiled, holding the bouquet a little closer to himself. “You want to come inside? We could start making up for lost time.”
Steve’s light golden hair felt soft against Tony’s nose as he took Steve all the way down, eyes fluttering shut so he could block out any distractions and
“I’ll walk with you,” Steve said, getting up from his desk to grab a coat from his closet. It was a hefty sort of thing, a thick black trench coat that
When he woke up again, he was bandaged up. The sheets had been replaced, and his shirt had been changed. His nails had been dulled and filed down so close to the nail beds that, on any normal day, he might have been worried about an infection.
have up too garish, taking up too much space. They seemed abstract in a way Steve couldn’t appreciate, focused more on how nonsensical they were than anything else. It was an art form Steve thought, perhaps biasedly, was better suited to revolution. Convolution in art from those in power never read the same, and this man seemed to have quite a bit of power.
“Oh, sure,” Steve replied. He was getting to the point where he would have taken one anyway. It was nice to have company.
“That’s sweet, Tony, but the United States Army doesn’t really pick its soldiers based on sex appeal.”
The future had given him all of that and more; his favorite thing of all, he thought, was Tony Stark. It was only fitting that the future would gift him a futurist, so gorgeous and bright that all the stars in the sky couldn't outshine him. His eyes sparkled and his body- lithe, but toned- was quick and jerky in as graceful a way Steve could have pictured it. He was a man rife with contradictions; he sought love more than anything but never thought he could have it, he so desperately wanted to live to do his work on earth and yet seemed to struggle every day of it, he was lively but pained and handsome but tired and so complex that Steve had difficulties keeping up at times. Tony Stark was everything.
Tony’s gloved hand delicately fiddled with the plastic end of the bouquet, his eyes seemingly stuck on the few drops of water collected at the bottom of it. He wasn’t quite meeting Steve’s eyes.
He seemed to be about done with talking. He took a few more deep gulps of his drink, leaned against Steve’s shoulder, and promptly went limp, eyes fluttering shut.
Steve’s jaw clicked shut, the silence that followed deafening. It could have been explained away, Tony thought, and they would have been fine. As Steve sat, wordless, Tony’s brain lit abuzz with all the possibilities of what it could have been.
Tony split his bagel in half, took a bite out of one of the parts, and sat back against the headboard. He wouldn’t, in a million years, have imagined that Steve would have tracked down the hotel room for some quality time, but he certainly wasn’t going to complain.
“No.” Steve interrupted all too quickly. Tony had half the mind to push, but Steve elaborated without prompting. “I volunteered. Tried to join the fight plenty of times, but— I mean, you see me.”
He’d ignore the guilt curling in his chest like the vines of a rose bush. He didn’t want the daily reset button, didn’t even want the thought of it. But he had it, and all the two of them could do was adapt.
The place was quirky in a homely way. It was cluttered in an organized manner, every mismatched painting beside the others in a melted asymmetrical grid on the walls. Eclectic suits of armor that would never have encountered the others in life stood opposite each other in hallways, some occupying corners as well. There was no way to escape the feeling of being watched in the public areas of the mansion as a result, but Steve found he didn’t mind it so much. It was nice to be looked out for. Perhaps he’d imbued the mansion with its own personality long ago, something caring and lovely, and found himself comfortable being enveloped in its warmth.
“I don’t want you waiting on me,” Steve answered, lightly patting the top of Tony’s foot before returning to his own bagel. “You know how these things are.”
That night specifically was October 31st- Halloween night, as everyone knew- and the mansion was filled with friendly faces, both human and otherwise. Steve hesitated to call Tony a “party animal,” but he certainly was a more-than-decent host. Tables of food spread so far across the ballroom floor that Steve thought individual desserts alone might outnumber guests, and the music that played seemed to filter through every room equally, never leaving one’s side.
The first issue with stubbornness in his line of work, he found, was that you more often stood at the side of familiar sized caskets than you did in the crowds of the ceremonies celebrating your good work. There was a cost, always, and it happened to be personal more often than not.
before, and sure, there was something almost slimy-feeling about the deceptiveness of it all, deserved or otherwise. It was a self respect thing, he thought. It wasn’t that he was better than the job itself, but he knew his boundaries, his limits, and if it wasn’t Avengers business, he wouldn’t even come close to anything like this.
He watched as Steve stood from his chair and reached into his pocket, taking his wallet to set a few bills on the counter top. Tony sat deadly still, unsure whether it was intended to serve as an invitation or a harsh, silent rejection.
they’d call Steve. It was sickeningly sweet and horribly endearing, especially when Peter came around with his many heads and many fuzzy arms, gazing upon Steve and Tony with many eyes and saying (with many mouths, of course), “Mom and Dad are fighting over the remote again.”
Steve’s tone betrayed his words, his voice cracking with a small bit of a laughter on “wasn’t” as he lost a small bit of his composure. At that point, the jig was up, and it all crumbled.
Steve pulled back, then, and Tony pushed himself up onto his arms to follow him. His heartbeat, which felt nonexistent since the moment Steve first touched him, accelerated. Tony watched anxiously as Steve moved to sit against the headboard, waving his hand to beckon Tony over.
Steve opened his mouth to speak, but shut it again quickly. Tony would have taken it as a sign of frustration if not for the tiny quirk of a smile that followed. Steve was clearly trying to hide it, clearing his throat and taking a moment to re-blank his face.
“You’ve never aspired to do anything more than this? You never wanted the wife, the kids, the white picket fence?”
Steve met his eyes. The mischievous twinkle Tony had grown accustomed to in their time together was gone, replaced by something deeper. Steve’s gaze was, impossible as it seemed, more difficult to decipher than it had been seconds prior.
He was isolated, though, and he knew how that alone could damage even the most resilient men alive. He was isolated, and there were only so many thoughts and memories he could cycle through before even that became more of a chore than a comfort. He laid down and tried to imagine Tony there next to him, with his olive-toned skin and his icy blue eyes, but Steve found himself losing his confidence in his memory of those eyes. Tony's hair was black- jet black as opposed to a warmer shade, which Steve noticed as soon as he met Tony- but even his hair was difficult to remember too accurately. The more Steve tried to picture Tony's face, the more it felt as if he was grasping for vague concepts of what he
“Having a late night wander, Winghead?” a voice greeted from behind him— Iron Man’s, it was clear. There was no world in which Steve wouldn’t recognize those words, that tone.
He closed his hands around one of the smaller sketchbooks, flipping loosely through the pages. Gail was an ever-present theme, though never young like Steve knew her before. She had wrinkles around her eyes and draped along her neck, laugh and smile lines prominent. Her hands were long and elegant even in age— maybe even more so— and her hair, lightly shaded, was styled beautifully, flyaways framing her forehead and livening up her image. Bucky was in the sketches, too, though young in some of them, and handsome as Tony had known him to be from the photos.
“Whoa, hey,” Steve pulled it back. “Look, I’m not… No offense intended here, I think it’s best we keep our drinks to ourselves now.”
nonsense he'd dismissed before. He'd always appreciated the thought behind it, the nuance behind it, the
His bookshelves were filled to the brim, mostly with titles that Steve recognized (or thought he might be able to recognize based on timeline alone, even if he hadn’t read them himself). There were little trinkets strewn about every available surface. Some pieces of decoration seemed outdated for the home but not ill-fitting; Tony must have been a collector. He had the money and the interest to pour his time into antiquing, Steve supposed.
And Tony does, though he knows nothing Steve says will settle in. Nothing will seem right or feel right or— or be right, and it’s an impossible situation to be putting Steve in, and he
Steve Rogers was a biter. He was a biter, as well as a kicker, a puncher, a grabber, and anything else you could be if you'd grown up scrappy and weren't a fan of being kidnapped by terrorist organizations. There was nothing
It’s suffocating, being on display like he is; he should feel grateful for the love, the praise, the honor that comes with being that hero for so many kids like the one he used to be. He
“Easy, love.” Steve set his hands just under Tony’s armpits, gently urging him to lay his side against the mattress. “There you are. That’s good, huh?”
There was the same gradual decline in the quality of his living space that there was in the testing areas. The worse he lashed out, the less he'd be able to keep. At first, it wasn't the worst arrangement in the world-- though he was spiteful still, of course, given that Hydra accommodations were Hydra accommodations no matter how pretty they tried to make them.
Tony frowned; he’d been content to make a joke of it, content to move on, but Steve was still— Well, he was still being some kind of way about it.
When his eyes landed on Tony, he approached. He always did. Tony was an alluring man, and even if he hadn’t been, Steve could still think of no one better to seek out for a break from the crowd.
He ran a soft hand over Steve’s chest, pressing a kiss to his cheek in between bites of popcorn. Steve didn’t respond, not even with a grunt or a hum. It wasn’t terribly out of character, but it wasn’t the
Tony’s chest tightened. It was a feeling wholly disconnected from desire— in fact, if he gave himself a moment to think, he might have come to the conclusion that it was the opposite. Steve was warm, bright like the sun, and far too pure in his tenderness to touch someone like Tony— it hadn’t occurred to Tony until he saw Steve bathed in that heavenly glow. Under the dim lights of the bar, with Steve hunched over his drink and barely turning to look, Tony could have convinced himself he was worth a night with this man. He
And though T’Challa’s face was obscured by his mask, his grin was audible. “We ask no more, friend,” he said.
It wasn't so bad, but one day, he woke up stripped of the clothes he was wearing before entirely, and he figured he wouldn't be worse off in that white shirt and those white pants.
“A trick,” Kang coughed out weakly, and Steve had half the mind to boot him in the cheek for his crimes. “It was all a trick.”
“She’s not, because you’re not wearing it,” Tony interjected, taking the hanger out of her hands and placing the jumpsuit back on the rack. She let out a scandalized gasp, gently whacking Tony’s hand with her clutch. “It doesn’t really scream alpha male. At least, it hasn’t since the 70’s.”
“Yep,” Steve answered, popping the ‘p.’ “It’s not too different from… I don’t know, armor? It’s really not that crazy once you get into it.” His tone betrayed his words, wavering and wholly unconfident.
“Sure. But you did what you set out to do. Mission complete. You got us access, and he’ll wake up tomorrow with a bad hangover, probably thinking he got laid or something. Take the win.”
For a man who didn’t seem to do things like this terribly often, Steve certainly wasn’t shy, taking hold of Tony’s thigh to tug him closer. Reaching down to cup Tony’s bulge with a hand, Steve kissed him hard, eliciting a moan from between his lips.
— food, water, shelter, temperature control, fresh air. He didn’t want to give Tony the bare minimum. He wanted to bring drinks, meals, warmth, breath.
"Six months," Tony replied, pulling away from Steve just enough to get a good look at him. He rested his hand on the side of Steve's face, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "But that's- That's alright. You don't have to worry about that. We don't have to worry about that right now."
“I could totally be a— Okay, this is starting to get hurtful.” The playfulness of Tony’s tone undercut the words. The banter, at least, was something to focus on.
in t-shirts and jeans and plain leather jackets, but he attributed that more to the fact that Cap was a character, a symbol, than anything else.
And perhaps Tony was even more funny in the moment, putting those plastic fangs back in his mouth for just a second to playfully say, “I
Steve would never admit it, but he’d read short stories about this, about amnesia. They were never the silly, so-deep-they-sounded-pretentious kind of stories, nor were they the young and frilly kinds of stories that children picked up to cry to before they knew how to feel proper. They were plain old stories, ones that might be hung up in a classroom or slipped in between two pages of the Bible if someone felt a particular kind of way about them.
“It lets me access some… dangerous technology. It’s a part of me. If anyone else gets ahold of it, if anyone else tries to get this— this thing, and use it themselves, it’ll—”
“I was just preparing for a walk,” Tony explained, walking over to meet Steve at his desk. He left his umbrella (black, with a lace trim) against the doorway. The low, stiff heels of his shoes clacked against the dark hardwood floor that dressed every bedroom in the mansion. Tony held his hand out for Steve’s book curiously, and Steve handed it over with no fuss. Tony’s finger (dressed in a white glove alongside the rest of his hands) lightly traced along the edges of it, his gaze fluttering over the cover with a twinkle that perplexed Steve.
He flipped the cap of his cup open and took a sip, closing it shortly afterward. Steve was so enamored by the redness of his lips that he didn’t even notice the scent that had wafted toward him until some seconds after the fact.
And he hadn't gotten much farther than that before the teacher interrupted, said "It's more complicated than that," and left it there. Tony-- young as he was and curious, bright, more lively than he'd turn out to be after a few more years of that same school-- wasn't off-put by the correction at all.
"You gonna hop on, big guy?" There was a waver in Tony's words that Steve elected to ignore; there was no need to call attention to it. Not then. It wasn't like no one on the team would understand.
if his legs couldn’t even support the weight of some guy, but he wanted to be gentle anyway. He spread his legs, straddled Steve’s thighs, and leaned forward, resting his face against Steve’s shoulder.
The laughs and hollers became little more than a murmur once they’d exited the ballroom. It was a pleasant sort of thing to experience, almost akin to a lively child snoring softly on your lap or a unit of soldiers all far from the atrocities of war for a short while, laying together under the stars while a fire crackled beside them.
Wordlessly, then, Tony led Steve inside. Steve scanned the room, and his tight grip on Tony's hand loosened as he took it all in. The lighting was warm and soft. The bed was adorned with red and gold sheets (Steve's suggestion, because really, Tony just looked so
Steve wouldn't say he'd forgotten what had happened to him- that certainly wasn't the case- but he'd been so worried about Tony while he was gone. He'd been so worried.
With a sigh, Tony said, “Yeah, I can honeypot. Been a while since I’ve felt a guy up,” and Steve’s chest tightened.
And Tony thought to himself one night, as he lay in bed with the vision of Steve's irises practically painted on the insides of his eyelids, if there was any meaningful difference between eyes that were blue because they were made to be and eyes that were blue because they simply couldn't be anything else.
Tony wrapped the chains loosely around his hand, tugging Steve forward to press a kiss to his lips. There was a moment where Steve seemed as if he’d reciprocated eagerly, but then he was pulling away, shifting to the side to keep Tony from getting any closer. It had the opposite effect; Tony was jerked forward, his hand still tangled up in Steve’s dog tags, and his body jolted at the sensation of his chest touching Steve’s through the thin fabric of Steve’s shirt.
“What do you need?” Steve asks, then, making it painfully obvious that he’s cycling through all of his options. Tony can’t blame him for that.
“Which ones?” Tony asked before pausing, blinking in what looked like surprise at the words that had come out of his mouth. Nat turned to meet his eyes, the corners of her mouth forced still to keep her smile at bay.
He kind of wanted to get on with his day. The whole “don’t be mournful and melodramatic” thing took a lot out of him; he knew better than to dwell. Knowing and doing weren’t quite the same, and he was sure Steve would cross his mind throughout the day (or week, or month, or…), but effort was worth something, at least.
He released the tags, flailing his hand frantically to untangle himself from their chains. Steve, wide-eyed, made no effort to help nor hinder him.
It wasn’t until Tony had finished his morning routine by securing a wig to the top of his head (a wig that Steve hadn’t ever noticed until just then), and smiling at himself, satisfied. He stood, then, and he made his way back to bed with Steve. He fished a little digital camera out from the nightstand drawer and turned it around to point at the two of them.
“Ehh,” Steve shifted, peeking past the bar to assess how crowded the dance floor was. “Might be more comfortable than it is back here, I’ll be honest.”
It was up to the leader of the mission— Carol, it was, this time around— to pick and choose who she wanted at the conference table. It was an odd bunch; to the left of Tony sat Jan, and across from Jan was Nat. They were the only four called, each with a different skillset and style, and even with all of Steve’s tactical brilliance, he couldn’t piece together what they were all there to do.
He laid there alone and hugged his pillow, trying to remember what it was Tony felt like in his arms. He was... cold. His hands were cold. No, they weren't. They hadn't been, since the new body. Or were they? Had they ever been cold? Was Steve just creating false memories based off of what little he knew about Tony's health? He knew Tony had circulation issues before... Didn't he? Or was it just trauma that affected his torso, close enough to the heart that Steve thought it must have been related?
bit bad when he thought he’d hurt someone’s feelings, no matter how dumb it seemed. And this, admittedly, seemed a little bit dumb to him. He had his own dumb little things, too; he could hardly blame Steve for being a little sensitive.
