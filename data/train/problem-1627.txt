“John!” he yells when he doesn’t see the doctor in the sitting room.  “John, the case!  Where are you?”
Rationally, John probably could have determined that all on his own.  Even so, he also knows that rationality rarely comes into play when dealing with your child being injured, so he’s not too ashamed of the heavy sigh of relief that comes out of him when he stands to retrieve Rosie.  Sherlock stands – silent and still, more’s the wonder – next to John, giving a single squeeze of his hand before John moves towards the exam table.  The girl thrusts her arms in the air the instant John nears her, whimpering at him as he hugs her to his chest.  He shakes the doctor’s hand again and gives her a rueful smile when Sherlock insinuates himself between the two of them and sweeps out the door without another word.
“As much as I am able.”
know where we are but no idea
“Come here, little bee,” John chortles and snakes his hand through Sherlock’s legs to curl around Rosie.  He brushes Sherlock’s calf with his arm just lightly enough that it seems like an accident as he pulls Rosie to him and lifts her up against his chest.
Sherlock tries to say the last part of it as casually as he can, hoping that Mycroft won’t latch onto that particular detail.
“Did they—”
Sarcasm and amusement are plain on Sherlock’s face as he lounges languidly across from where John has gone rigid.  Suddenly all of his hinky behavior over the last few months makes sense and it’s all because of a bloody cup of tea.  It was something he’d done for Mary, making her tea first so it would have time to cool before she drank it.  When she was pregnant, she’d had trouble with her teeth and gums being extremely sensitive, so he’d gotten in the habit of making her tea before his own and blowing on it to cool it before he gave it to her.  She seemed equally amused and touched by the process because she always remarked that by the time hers was cool, he was so impatient and intent on sharing the evening ritual with her that he burned his mouth on his own because he refused to wait for it to cool.  He’d once gotten frustrated and asked her what was so bloody sweet about that and she’d favored him a brilliant smile before answering, “That’s real love, John: a man who’ll burn his mouth every night just so I won’t drink my tea all alone.”  Thinking back on it, John realizes he’s been doing the same thing with Sherlock for months now, the damn nightly tea scalding.  If he stacks it up in his mind next to the trail of snacks, the annoyance at Irene Adler’s texts, the terror at Sherlock’s injury, and that moment in the alley, it’s impossible for his brain to miss what this really means.  Jesus.
“You’re not—”
“Another fifteen minutes or so,” he answers woodenly to Sherlock and then leans around the detective to gaze at his daughter.  Rosie reaches out with her right hand and whimpers, eyes filling as she leans towards John.
When he opens his eyes, his best friend stands too close, fingers threading around Rosie’s back and just barely brushing John’s arm underneath her bottom.
John has very little doubt that he has Mrs. Hudson to thank for this; she’s been subtly prodding at John about Sherlock’s involvement in Rosie’s rearing since they moved into Baker Street with him.  He’s been avoiding the discussion as slyly as he can but apparently she’s decided to force the issue by teaching Rosie to call Sherlock ‘Papa’.  Can’t point that out to Sherlock, though, given the carefully blank expression on his angular features.
Sherlock gently lays the bow across the stand and packs his violin away in the case left open on the desk.  John rises from his chair and shuffles about behind him – looking for some reason to stay in the room? – but Sherlock doesn’t turn.  Eventually, John sighs and heads towards the stairs.  The doctor pauses at the doorframe.
“And she was having sex with him on purpose?  I mean, she was aware and consenting?”
John blinks and furrows his brow.  “Well, you were a few inches wide of the mark.  Left shoulder.  You know that.”
“John, stop,” he says quietly.
The jagged marks and circular ones down the small of his back and across his hips both look like … “Burns?  But with different,” he clears his throat, “mediums?”
A long moment of silence passes because John can’t seem to say the word.  Sherlock eventually gets frustrated and snaps at him.
“Something relatively simple and free of danger so we don’t get hurt, but something out of London.  Preferably far enough away that we won’t be able to return to London until the next day.”
Sherlock nods.  “Nightmare?” Obvious, but John doesn’t like it when he assumes the blatant facts without checking.
“So, the case?”
“Oh come on, if I didn’t know better, I’d think you were a teenager with his first crush!”
John’s gaze softens as it glides over his daughter.  “She’s asleep?”
“I can handle myself, Mycroft.  And John.  So I’ll thank you to keep your nose out of it,” he says with as much dignity as he can muster.
John starts, then nods.  Sherlock can hear him clambering back under the duvet as Sherlock deposits Rosie back onto her cot.  Nearly out the door, Sherlock almost believes he hallucinated the sound of John’s voice when he speaks again.
John scolds himself.  Definitely not the sort of thing you think about surrounded by commuters while on the tube.  Hard not to think about it, though.  The talk he’d had with that last patient, Alex, had stuck with him.  The boy had looked so mortified, as if embarrassed about his entire being just as a by-product of admitting to participating in gay sex let alone enjoying it.  John had wondered, in that moment, if that’s how Harry had felt when she’d first known herself and come out.  He doubts it; Harry had been intentionally, even excessively, brash when discussing and detailing her preferences in those days.  John wonders now if it was bravado to cover up something more like Alex’s feelings.  It made him want to help the young man in whatever way he could.  And if John’s completely honest, he’d wanted to test out the words on his tongue, see how they felt in his mouth, calling Sherlock his boyfriend.
Sherlock hesitates a moment with a half-raised bow before he brings it to the strings and begins to play.  The tune winds around John in the air, beginning with an intense and foreboding sawing at the strings that leads into a bouncing, mercurial melody that seems eminently Sherlock.  If John closes his eyes and leans his head back against the chair, the tune speaks to him of midnight chases through the streets of London and laughs at crime scenes.  Yes, this is Sherlock, condensed into a single line of music.  But not only Sherlock … the line blends into something different, a haunting descant that is at once melancholy and sweet.  He gazes up to see Sherlock turned away from him, dragging the bow across the instrument in long, sweeping strokes, coaxing a strain of plaintive wails from the wooden body against his chin; John feels the notes in his bones.  And then it’s gone again, dancing away under notes that are sensual and lilting then foreboding, then unmistakably anguished … and then it twists and turns again and John finds himself not so much actively listening but letting the music wash over him.  Some of it he recognizes – he picks out a phrase of the song Sherlock wrote for the Woman, some of it are lines and strains that he’s heard Sherlock composing over the years – but though much of it is new, it feels … familiar.  John finds himself just watching Sherlock as he did that night of the gypsy tune; beads of sweat run down the center of his back as he breathes the music in and out, violin and musician moving together.  John thinks that this is not so much a song as it is a story without words.  He feels the story in bursts of emotions:  sorrow, fear, joy, menace, danger that roils in his belly, a hot punch of agonizing sorrow that rattles him to his bones, and then quiet.  Sherlock’s fingers pulse against the strings but it’s barely louder than a whisper.  John can’t help but think that the growing tension in the melodic line is fear … and hope; a tiny tremulous thing, but unmistakably hope.  John realizes he’s leaning forward in his chair as if chasing the anticipation in that strain beneath Sherlock’s fingers.  And then Sherlock stops abruptly, his arms dropping back to his sides.
Sherlock is about to protest when he feels John glide his fingers across the expanse of bed between them.  When they interlock with Sherlock’s fingers, any words the detective may have had on his tongue scatter to the winds.

“At least Action Man didn’t favor such god-awful jumpers.”
“Daddy,” Rosie answers dutifully.
The reassuring weight of Sherlock’s hand and the warmth of his arm at John’s back feels … good.  Comforting.  He’s barely aware that he’s leaning into the circle of Sherlock’s arm until he registers that the detective has angled himself in so that John’s side presses in against his.  John stares hard at the top of Rosie’s head, trying to gather the courage to say something when Sherlock’s arm tenses behind John’s back and pulls the doctor just tiny bit closer.  A puff of Sherlock’s breath ruffles the hair above his ear and John turns his head, finding Sherlock’s face much nearer than he’d expected.  He’s just opening his mouth to speak when a high voice says, “Watson?” from the other end of the room.
“He just said no,” John says to the empty room.  He feels the realization creeping up on him and Mary nods as if she hears his thoughts whirring.
John scowls.  “Two
writing a referral to Child Protection for a father that has scalding liquids within striking distance of his two-year-old.
It wasn’t as though the tactic the blond employed didn’t work either, of course, and so he didn’t really need the Omega traits and to deal with that part of the stereotype.
John inhaled sharply at that, then pursed his lips and worked his jaw to try and keep moderately calm. It didn’t work. He glanced up at Sherlock, or, more precisely, he glared back.
By the time they sat in the small airplane – though it was still large enough to be a commercial rather than a private one, because of course it was – John was fairly vibrating where he sat, and the worst part is, he had no goddamn good reason to. Or any reason at all, really.
For him to outright threaten their unborn children as brazenly, for him, as that, that was something else, entirely, and the Alpha instincts rose on their own, despite his efforts.
Yes, it was decidedly the best finale he could possibly have hoped for, regardless of what had gone before.
“His colleagues could hear, though, or at least his neighbour could. There was a slight sound that would indicate the volume is wrong. In any case, you could see her pause on the way past him, her head tilted. She’ll have plenty to tell her friends over tomorrow’s lunch.”
There was no way that he wouldn’t be feeling all of the things he had since…well, at least since finding out about the paper on his daughter. Further than that, honestly, but it had certainly escalated at that point. Sherlock would defy almost anybody else to not react emotionally after everything John had been through.
One part was that he’d tapped into some of what he’d used as a keeper. Not entirely the same but the mindset was there and could be utilised.
John could fight with his bare fists if he needed to and a gun if he needed to as well, but even if he didn’t need it for combat, there was every likelihood that he was going to need it for something much more practical, such as cutting through something.
How could he tell? After all, their sibling rivalry was heavily entangled with the instincts and behaviour of dragons, for very obvious reasons, and it would be difficult to know which stemmed from being siblings and which from their dragon heritage, especially without others to use for reference.
Sherlock had continued to watch him during his little mental tangent, with a wonderful patience that John suspected was…if not a little out of character, if such a term could be used, then at least something that was mainly bestowed on him.
“Three.”
It certainly didn’t seem as though there was much of Sherlock left in there, at least not in the driver seat. The eyes were still entirely reptilian and almost pure white as they stared at him, with no hint of actual recognition of the person underneath him. The teeth parted just enough to allow the tip of a tongue to flicker out for a moment, the movement turning the smile almost grotesque.
Gods…as though this wasn’t complicated enough as it was.
“And how do you know that that will last?” he asked. The question didn’t come out challenging or menacing or anything remotely similar. Instead, it came out quiet and flat, an honest question even as the answer was foregone.
Or it could be a mere coincidence, too. In either case, it was nothing to get worried about.
“Good. The large pair of scissors should be…no, we used them after that. They’re probably in the living room, on the windowsill. I’ll need the first aid kit and everything I put out on the sofa table plus anything else you think essential for dealing with this.” He waved his free hand for emphasis.
Sherlock frowned. “I’d never expect you to be or ask you to.”
“I’m not struggling through that brush when it’s even longer than it is now. It’s going to be enough of a bugger as it is.”
They ended up assisting each other, a fact that wasn’t lost on Sherlock, small and apparently irrelevant though it seemed, and he couldn’t say he didn’t appreciate the metaphor, at least.
Perhaps precisely because he knew both the sibling behaviour and that of dragons, faulty though his knowledge was, so well and had little experience of a romantic side, he could recognise that it felt different.
All the while he was arguing with himself, Sherlock was aware of Moriarty. He couldn’t see him or his face clearly, but he could feel him behind him, yet to make any real move, and he had a fairly good idea, insofar as that was possible, of what the man was thinking.
“I get that, love,” John said. “I do and I’m not – I’m not blaming you for your solution to the problem. It’s not that. Never that. It’s just that…that I don’t want to lose you, either. There cannot only be one solution or the other.”
who they were rather than in spite of it.
And yet, it felt…immensely wrong. Perhaps…
“Yes, he has,” Sherlock said, openly and loud, staring back at the enormous eye. He even raised his chin a little, taking care to mimic the way John did it, just to prove a point, knowing that the dragon would see and would know, too. “A far better one than I deserve, without question, and you won’t get me to think otherwise or think less of him in general. But then, I’m not the only one to be affected by him, am I?”
And that wasn’t even considering if she hadn’t been thriving.
“It will be, after all of this. There is no need to exacerbate it.”
John. What about the…no, not the figment, he was more than that. He was a manifestation of the real John. But that said, he was
He fervently wished that Mycroft would hurry the buggering hell up and get back there, with whatever cure he had managed to scrounge up somewhere.
The mask that had been in place since they’d entered the building, at least mainly, had slipped off his face, though, which Sherlock considered a good thing in the situation.
Granted, he had passed through them once on his way down, able to shut them out as he did so. But as the dragon woke and subsequently started to move, or perhaps more precisely by this point, thrash, they’d started to clamour, too, and as they were part of his makeup, this deep down, he couldn’t remain as unaffected. Not when he was tired, with such an important thing in his grasp, as well.
Roughly, anyway, as they had been in Nantes only a year before they’d gotten a larger and more luxurious place to stay in Angers, which they again hadn’t stayed at for more than eighteen months, mostly because the user who’d provided access had gotten ideas about the actual ownership of the harem. Rather unhealthy thoughts, it turned out.
Oh, god, I’m going to die. This time, I’m really fucking going to die. Killed by my best friend and kept as the ultimate serial killer trophy by that same friend.
“It seemed like it mattered to you,” he said, quietly.
Well, mostly ignore it. He couldn’t quite help sending down, or possibly out, the thought that if he did that, then it would be the end of not only him but it as well. There was no dragon yet that had survived without a host.
He stood there, at a bit of a loose end as to what he ought to do.
He nudged John’s chin up with two fingers, so their gazes met. “I would never take you away from your children. I promise, and I apologise for making you think that.”
Another thought crossed his mind as he waited; would Mycroft bring somebody back with him, after all? He’d said he wouldn’t but that was hardly a guarantee, was it? Why had he so readily agreed to John’s, admittedly stupid and ungrounded, demand? What was he aware of that the doctor wasn’t? An extensive list, unquestionably, and not just in relation to dragons, but in this specific case, he meant.
“Yes, boning. You buggering me, or me buggering you. Either is perfectly fine but I’d really like to know whether you’re going to go feral dragon on me while either of our cocks is buried in the arse of the other.”
John got to his feet, too, a little more awkwardly than the ginger-haired man, mostly due to the continued grip on his arm. They were standing quite close but even if he could move, he wasn’t about to. He’d refused be intimidated by a madman dragon with a handful of snipers, he bloody well wasn’t about to allow a pompous arse to do so, in his own home.
Another, deeper sniff of their joined hands. Sherlock tried to pull his hand away so she could scent the Omega on his own, but she stopped him and pushed the hand back to where it had been, with a very firm ‘no’ to go along with it.
Sherlock shook his head. “No. That would just result in a horrible mess that would require clean-up and nothing more. That wouldn’t be
This wasn’t because he was afraid of the self-important twit, quite the reverse. He’d more than once slapped the boy – who was half a year older than Sherlock and a prefect, a job he had weaselled himself into and took pleasure in as only such people can, but still looked as though he’d just started secondary –  down, verbally if not physically, and had done so both skilfully and, if he said so himself, almost elegantly.
~~oOo~~
“But you do want to,” John said, making absolutely sure.
Davies looked at them dispassionately as the big man left the room. “So, you have some... business for me, you say?” His tone could not be more uninterested.
John smiled like a boy with a secret and stroked his hand down Sherlock’s neck to his chest. “I think you liked me in that suit.”
“Well,” John said, pitching his duffel into the closet to land where it would, “let’s go see Rosie, hmm?” Sherlock remained where he was, looking intently at John as he crossed toward the exit. John stopped a few paces before he would have to push past, and eyed the tall form wryly. “Blocking the doorway, Sherlock,” he gestured for his friend to precede him from the room.
“But then I heard they were dead, and you were free! It was like God smiled on me. I knew what I had to do, so I could be ready for you when the time came. Aha!” With a sound of satisfaction, she found a second cartridge for the atomizer, and swapped it with the empty one. “Richard, with his stupid yoga and his bloody vitamins, so smug. Well, I fixed that. A little mercury in the formula, increase the dose over two months, and I was free too.” She nudged the prone form at her feet with a trainer-clad toe; incongruous with her wedding finery. “Roll over, John.”
“Marjorie. She’s been quite fixated on John since her husband passed. We came up with the idea to put her off.” He chuckled. “It was rather more effective at showing us what the other was hiding, it seems.”
John stepped into his scuffs and started to walk back toward his room, snagging a bottle of water on his way out. He cracked it and handed it to Sherlock, putting his other hand on a wool-swathed arm to halt his friend’s rush for the door. “Here, drink this - you’re a little flushed, and no wonder, in the sauna in your coat like that.” A shiver ran through Sherlock, and he took the bottle gingerly, sipping with clear reluctance. He handed it back with a nod, eyes dark and hooded despite the fluorescent lights. “Are you alright, really, Sherlock? You’re not coming down with something are you?” John squeezed the arm he had been grasping, then absently slid his hand down and off as he continued on toward his room while his friend waved away any notion he might be ill with impatient strides and scoffed denials.
“John,” Sherlock breathed after a charged moment.
"I need a case, John. Something to stop my mind racing. It's been days since the last one -"
“Wow,” John breathed, jaw slack. Sherlock nodded in ardent agreement. “Is that me? Imagine stumpy old me looking like this.”
“I need them too, you imbecile, you should have taken your own notes in class,” the figure said, and John realized with surprise it was Marjorie Penton. John and Marjorie crossed paths frequently enough, since her father and his Aunt were a pretty serious item these days. John knew Marjorie was in higher-level chemistry with some of the older students, and she had helped him with his own homework in the subject more than once.  He hadn’t realized she shared a class with any of his teammates, and in her goth-inspired outfit, so unlike what she wore at her father’s house, he hadn’t recognized her until she spoke.
The rumbling in his stomach led him to the nurses’ station, where Nurse Savage was typing away at a computer that even John could tell was antiquated. A weathered health care veteran, she exuded a stoic calm and capable authority, even while bathed in the unflattering greenish glow of the screen. She grumbled under her breath as she squinted at what she had written, then banged out another word or two before looking up inquiringly.
An hour later, he stood beside a flustered Harry and a beaming Clara in the reception line, shaking hands and accepting congratulations for the happy pair. The wedding guests passed by in a blur, with a few standouts: Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim, grinning and demanding John come sit with them and catch up; Stephen Penton, all grown up, with an attractive young lady on his arm; Clara’s mum, who was as lovely as Clara and had a similar fondness for bums, John discovered. He hadn’t realized he could make that particular sound, and Clara’s mum laughed delightedly. He flushed crimson, and somehow ended up agreeing to save the lady a dance. Harry widened her eyes in eloquent disgust while Clara cackled from her other side.
Sherlock swings around, gesturing to his own chest, and then freezes when he catches John’s raised eyebrows.
He actually chuckles, which draws Sherlock’s eyes back to his face.  John’s cheeks are pink but that could be from the steaming bath water.  God, he doesn’t know, he can’t seem to process because his brain just won’t
“And who’s this?” He pokes a finger into the baby’s belly, causing her to laugh.
“You want me to—?”
sake—please don’t throw your life away just to look clever in front of strangers.  It’ll never be worth it, in the end.”
John’s breath falters when Sherlock’s thumb sweeps across the top of his.  Another gentler sweep when some of the tension slides out of John’s shoulders.
Sherlock says in answer to the half-formed question on John’s lips, “but not the way most people do.  Or so I gather.  I don’t feel attraction to an entire gender en masse, I don’t feel attracted to subsets of people, I don’t ‘have a type’, I don’t walk into a pub or a supermarket or a coffee shop, see a stranger and feel attracted to them the way so-called normal people would, John.  I just … don’t feel those things that way.”
Sherlock feels his entire face flame with color.  “I’ll have to take your word for it.”
God, even Mary knew.”
“Captured,” Sherlock amends.  “They believed I was a spy from a rival syndicate and tortured me for information which I didn’t have.  They refused to believe I didn’t have it, I admit, because I did my usual performance and made them all look like morons inside two minutes of capture.”
“So,” John begins, his voice just a tiny bit tense, “you saw the pages I left for you then?”
“Right.”  He’s trying desperately to restart his neurons firing but he just keeps blinking and gaping and gripping the doorknob.
“Completely ridiculous that I didn’t see it before, John.  Absolutely insane.  Should have been obvious from the moment we walked in the door—”
John flicks his eyes up and catches Sherlock’s gaze.  The detective has the trace of a smile on his face when he looks up from where Rosie now pokes her head between his knees, buzzing ostentatiously, and the expression freezes a bit when he links eyes with John.  He’s still bent almost horizontal, peering  at where Sherlock has bowed his knees out around Rosie’s mischievous little face, and John lets his grip on his towel slacken just enough that he can feel it slide down to the top curve of his arse.  Sherlock’s cheeks redden as he scans John’s face and even though John tips his gaze back to his daughter, he can feel the heat of Sherlock’s gaze as it slides down John’s damp back and over the curve of his bum.  He smirks just a little when he hears a distinct throat clearing above his head but decides to put Sherlock out of his momentary misery.
Sherlock resists the urge to grind his teeth at the phrase ‘little blog’ which has generated the interest of actual royalty before, not to mention saved his brother’s ample arse in the last year.  “I’ve already checked with Lestrade; he doesn’t have anything that meets my needs and neither does the website.”
“I have the same,” Sherlock flounders for a word and hates it, “needs as any other man.  It is a biological imperative; I meet the need when it needs to be met.”
no less,” Sherlock amends, smirking at John’s bewilderment.
“I haven’t timed you, John; I pay attention.  Subtle difference.”  Sherlock moves to the desk where he lays out his bag and fishes for his pajamas inside its depths.  “Besides,” he continues as John begins to bang around getting his bath started, “given that I delete things that you consider fundamental knowledge such as the current members of the monarchy or the structure of the solar system, I’d think you’d be flattered that I pay attention to your bathing habits and how you take your tea and consider them of significant importance to occupy space in my Mind Palace.”
“Alex, you do know that this is nothing to be ashamed of, don’t you?  The sex but also learning where your boundaries are.  It’s something everybody learns, no matter who they are and no matter who their partner is.”
John feels his face pinch and he can’t help but give one last protest.  “But—”
He opens his mouth but finds he has no good response.
The muffled thump of Rosie’s hands clapping together echoes in John’s ears.  She’s clearly pleased with herself as she regards his face, tapping his lips once more for emphasis.
A tiny hysterical part of Sherlock demands that he sit down this instant and figure out how a dead woman is still sending him video diaries no one seems to know about nearly a year after her death, but Sherlock knows that it would be useless: Mary’s too good (
In the next few weeks, though, John notices a subtle but definitive shift in the
is out there already and you can
Sherlock twitches beneath John’s touch and reluctantly admits, “Nine.”
John absorbs that for a moment.  “Do you love her, Sherlock?”  When Sherlock turns back and stares at him, stricken, John angles Rosie towards him to emphasize the question. “You love her?”
For a moment, John’s chest warms a bit at the idea of Sherlock putting that much care into John’s appearance.  Until, of course, he continues speaking.
Hearing the telltale creak of floorboards in the hall, Sherlock turns his head to regard John.  The doctor lays a small lilac hold-all on the floor just inside the door sill, shifting his overnight bag to his other hand.  A crooked smile quirks his lips on one side and John leans heavily against the frame; his face softens and lines of tension smooth away as he watches Sherlock rock back and forth, Rosie’s small fingers twining in a few errant curls at his nape.
“He—you must understand, John,” Sherlock says in a rush, “sometimes we wouldn’t be able to communicate for days or weeks at a time because I was constantly moving and it wasn’t safe.  It took him three weeks to become aware of my situation, a week to actually find me, and another four to wade in far enough to even get close to me.”
“You once called me the most human human being you’d ever met, John.  I feel … need the same as anyone else does but desire and attraction?  I just … don’t feel it.  Well, not
His eyes had naturally gone to the flannel in question, stuck at one corner in the trail of hair leading down from John’s navel and beginning to float away with the current from Rosie’s splashes.   John clears his throat and the gentle noise of displaced water suggests that John has pressed a hand down to hold the cloth in place over his genitals.  Sherlock gulps.
Anxious fingers dart all over John’s upper body, skittering up his arms to his chest and then, to John’s surprise, up under his t-shirt where Sherlock’s touch scrambles along his pectorals.  He pushes along John’s collarbone then down the breast bone, heedless of the tug of his fingernails in John’s chest hair.  Although the detective doesn’t completely relax, some of the tension goes out of Sherlock as he slides his hands back down John’s stomach and out from under his shirt. After a few moments of tracing his gaze across John’s bewildered features, the younger man drops flat to his back and brings shaking hands up to cover his face as he tries to regulate his breathing.  John lets the silence hang for a while then slides back down to his pillow and gazes at his friend as he massages the bridge of his nose and avoids John’s gaze.
The doctor’s heart is in his throat and he sends the door banging off the wall behind him as his knees nearly go out from under him.  He leans against the wall for support. Even with all the joking he’d done about Sherlock’s ‘bedroom voice’, John never actually expected to hear said voice in a bedroom.  Saying
“Promise,” John demands.  “Nothing about you could ever be worse than knowing you were so ashamed that you didn’t think you could tell me.  That I did you such a disservice that you didn’t even want to try.”
“Ugh, just the thought—”
“That’s a surprise,” Sherlock mutters and goes back to the screen he’d been perusing.
Sherlock moves out into the foyer towards the stairs but a glance into the kitchen stops John in his tracks.
Sherlock smiles indulgently.  “You poke fun but that sounds like an excellent plan to me.  Perhaps you could learn to garden, John.”
“Look at me, John; I’m
“This from the man who had the both of us literally leaping across building rooftops and chasing a serial killer the day after I met him.”
“Sorry,” John says with a self-depreciating grin.  “Didn’t think you’d just invite yourself in.  Stupid of me, all things considered.”
Sherlock shakes his head before John even finishes speaking.  “Never again, John.  Not if I can help it, of course.  I’m no good without you.  My conductor of light, remember?”
“I mean it.  You’ve nothing to be embarrassed about, all right?”
“She’s a lesbian!” Sherlock yells.  “She told you herself!  Honestly, John, I think you’ve said ‘not gay’ so often you’ve lost all concept of the meaning of the word.  She.  Is.
“Most A&E doctors would be suspicious of two middle-aged men bringing in a toddler with a burn at this hour of the night, Sherlock.  And on top of that, any good doctor would at least
And somehow, John finds that’s exactly what he needed to hear.  Sherlock knew it, without John even knowing it himself.
“My fault?!” John remarks.  “How could this possibly be
in the alley after their case the other night.  They have a rather spectacular chase through Clerkenwell with some low rate thugs and end up ducking into an alley with a little alcove just big enough for the two of them to crowd in and escape their pursuers.  He allows himself to be shooed into the tight space and shaded from the outer alley only because Sherlock is a) bloody insistent and b) wearing entirely dark clothing, so less likely to be spotted in their dingy surroundings.  When pressed back into the alcove by the inexorable motion of Sherlock’s body, John gets wedged tightly against a sharp corner without a way to turn his body to align flat to the wall; with nothing else to do with his arms in the limited space, John’s hands drop to Sherlock’s waist.  Too late, he realizes that they end up underneath the folds of Sherlock’s coat, settling onto the smooth fabric of his ungodly expensive shirt.  Some footsteps clack in the outside corridor and Sherlock presses closer, his forearms braced above John’s shoulders on the dirty bricks of the building and the heat of the other man’s body radiating against John all the way down to his knees.  Sherlock cranes his head sideways to listen for the thugs chasing them and John can’t help notice that the position would look, to an objective observer, as if they’d slipped in here for an amorous embrace.  John’s arms are nearly laced around Sherlock’s back now and his fists tighten over the prominent span of the detective’s slim hips.  Their position puts his face right into the base of Sherlock’s throat and suddenly he’s surrounded by the warm aromas of clean sweat drifting up from inside Sherlock’s clothes, posh aftershave above John at his neck, the crispness of the laundry soap John buys and astringent tang of the antiseptic soap Sherlock uses after his experiments.  Christ, how could he have not noticed how overwhelming all of these smells were surrounding his flatmate for years and then suddenly be overpowered by them in such an odd moment?  And why in God’s name is his heart galloping like a bloody racehorse and he can’t seem to control his breathing and he may be panicking a tiny bit at the electric zip down his spine because it’s far too close to that thrill he gets in the first flushes of arousal and—
For his part, John seemed bemused by how seriously Sherlock was taking their practice. He amiably received any overtures Sherlock made with evident, or at least well-feigned, enjoyment and no sign of discomfort because Sherlock was a man, or because he was Sherlock. He was remarkably relaxed with the whole situation. When Sherlock was honest with himself, it irked him a bit. Here he was, genius consulting detective with an international reputation, all in a dither over a pretend boyfriend who was not interested in him; while said pretend boyfriend was oblivious and unaffected. And irritatingly calm. And unfairly attractive. Damn him!
“John, what on earth are you talking about?” Sherlock’s voice snapped him out of his head and back into the conversation, where his friend eyed him incredulously. “You didn’t, and you won’t, and it’s ridiculous to imagine something that will never happen.”
“Got it in one. A mortar round landed right in front of me and took off my foot in an instant, then shrapnel ricocheted off the building beside us into my throat." Duck spoke matter-of-factly, not particularly fussed about discussing what must have been a devastating event at the time. "Your RAMC blokes had me in the ambulance and on my way to hospital for surgery in less than fifteen minutes; it’s part of why I healed up as well as I did. I talked to one of the blokes later; he came to check on me after I was out of the operating theater. Said I should have bled out right there, but for that they could chuck me straight into transport. I’m one lucky bastard, right enough.” He pushed the door to the garden open, enveloping them in humid floral-scented air. The weather had returned to London drab after yesterday’s bright sunlight, but it didn’t look like it would rain in the next little while.
John snickered, mollified by his friend’s reasonable response. “Yeah.”

"I'm not going to be able to occupy my mind with exercise," Sherlock said acidly, "the brain's what counts, the rest is just transport." His feet continued to tap a complex beat.
the table, but look at me.” He cuffed his eyes again and snagged a tissue to give a good blow. “Fucking crying more in the last three days than in the last three decades, and that includes being shot.” He blew his nose again, and pulled a fresh tissue to dab at his eyes.
His hands worked by muscle memory, checking the chamber of the pistol to be sure it was clear, slipping out the clip and opening his top drawer to stow both pieces next to the bowl of odds and ends there. He paused, gaze arrested by the modest china bowl filled with the detritus of a doctor’s life.
“So, that was Sherlock,” Duck began, once they had sat down in their usual places. “He’s taller than I imagined, actually.”
And it,” John hesitated, then blew out a whoosh of air trapped in his chest from his rapid words, “it surprised me. Frightened me, I think. I didn’t know what to do, what to think about it, so I thought maybe if I went for a run it would help.” He sighed mightily, trudging back to flop onto the sofa again.
“Nonsense, he’s already past your rather thorough take-down of the suspect, I’m sure. You’ve given him all the time in the world to build an ironclad case. Usually he’s scrambling before the murderer gets a solicitor and posts bail.”
“What’s this, then?” he asked, starting to unwrap it, and gasping when he saw what he held. “Sherlock, this is my phone! I’m not supposed to have it here!” He had started to raise his voice, then abruptly dropped it to a whisper, as though pastel-clad nurses would storm the room if they overheard him.
Sherlock thought it a good idea to interject: “Spike, you will serve time for this, but if you give yourself up...” John elbowed him in the side to shut him up before the man’s rage turned on them.
Aunt Brigid was right behind him, beaming as she sipped. “Sometimes the second try is the one that sticks,” she said pointedly, poking her husband’s arm. John and Sherlock laughed with relief and raised their cooling cups together.
“Bag of Hammers, John, do keep up.”
He’d reached his lowest point, there in his bedroom only a few nights ago, and when he awoke afterward, he had realized that he didn’t actually want to die. He was terrified by how close he had come and he was grateful to have lived, grateful that Sherlock had been able to save him. But that didn’t translate immediately into being fine.
Sherlock dragged him to a crime scene the day after that. “You look like you could use a pick-me-up,” he quipped. “I’ve got a nice double-homicide, a locked room, on the hob just now. Come on!” And he hustled John into a cab, blithely informing Amina they’d be back sometime before tomorrow. His manic grin faded a little in the face of John’s haggard silence.
“Come on, my girl, I know it’s not the most delicious stuff in the world, but it’s what’s for breakfast,” he cajoled, giving her a wide-eyed, open-your-mouth-like-I-am expression in hopes that she would at least laugh and he could push some of the cereal in that way. At last, she opened her mouth, and in it went.
"No!" John took a breath and blew it out, swallowing his irritation. "No mantras, Sherlock. Right, okay. Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Take a breath."
When he arrived at his doorway, he heard Rosie crowing and babbling from inside, interspersed with baritone comments. He grinned widely, and stepped in to see Sherlock and Rosie arranged on the floor with a post on a rocking stand, stacked with graduated, brightly colored rings. Rosie had managed to put two rings on the post, and judging by the bottom lip clutched between white teeth, Sherlock was emphatically restraining his instinct to organize the rings by color or size or some other criteria known only to him.
Silence stretched, thick and cottony in the tiny protected room. Behind Sherlock’s shoulder, slow-motion figures oozed across the video screen like grainy ghosts. John felt the quiet weighing on him, along with Sherlock’s stare, until he couldn’t bear it. “And you did fine - it was, ahem, it was lovely.” His face flamed and cast about in the bare room for something to look at other than Sherlock, then gave up as there was nothing to look at except the screen behind his friend’s back.
Even more unexpectedly, Sherlock would let him have the last word once in awhile, usually in conversations about Rosie. The more time Sherlock spent with the girl, the more she seemed to charm him. When she did something especially to his liking, such as making a random sound that included most of the consonants of his name, or enthusiastically eating the special blend of fruits, oils and cereals he had concocted for her “to provide optimal nutrition for her developing neural pathways, John, this is a critical time for her intellectual development,” he would grin broadly and shoot John a look that said ‘see? She likes me!’ as though it was the last thing he would ever have expected.
“Of course I got you the pants. You can’t wear a suit like that with shabby undergarments. It’s disrespectful.”
“Much better this morning, thanks,” John replied, “I slept well, at least.”
John pulled off Sherlock’s cock with an unselfconscious slurp. “I think you’re ready, then, yeah?” His torturous fingers slipped out of Sherlock, leaving him empty and frantic for release.
“Yes!” Sherlock exulted. “Precisely so. Our distance killer has struck again.” Sherlock was all leashed excitement now, shimmying in place in his eagerness. “So, where would be the best place for them to have been placed? You’re the marksman between us, John - where do you think?”
Sherlock smiled, that sincere expression that softened his face and deepened the crows’ feet by his eyes. “Of course.”
“I shot you, Sherlock. No one else had a gun here, only me. I was about to take him down with a shot to the leg, and you slammed into me, and I shot you instead!” John was trembling with shock and a swiftly building anger. “Why the HELL did you knock me down in the first place!”
John grinned a sardonic grin at her as she fiddled with the sliders at his back, then smoothed the waistcoat again and gestured for him to do up his buttons. “Maybe. And aren’t you supposed to be the uptight one today? Should I be telling Harry you’re going around patting bums?”
“I don’t know what I’m doing here, Sherlock. I’m fucking pants at this with women, let alone redefining my fundamental understanding of myself to boot. But I - this feels right. To me, I mean. With you. Just… if you want it too, I want to - this. But maybe take it slow, yeah? I don’t want to… ruin us, because I went too fast for myself. I couldn’t take that, er, so...” John trailed off, having delivered this speech to his shoes. The thick silence fell again between them, but John couldn’t bring himself to look at his friend.
“Please, John. Your normal attire is fine for sniffling noses and ingrown toenails at the surgery, but at an event like a wedding when you’re not the groom, you’ll need some help.” He eyed the blocky oatmeal jumper and loose-fit trousers John was wearing with a sneer. “Second, I think for this to go well, we should practice.” Sherlock leaned back to watch John’s reaction. He wasn’t really set on either of these requirements, but he wanted to know how far John was comfortable taking the pretense. Of course, any chance that he could live his fantasy of dressing John the way he deserved was worth taking, and the ‘practice’ would give him a whole week of opportunity to store up memories, not just three days.
The thug ducked his head and scuffed a foot on the carpet. “Sorry, Spike, but we found these two up in the hallway by the door, din’t we, strolling in bold as you please. Me’n Archie stopped ‘em, but they said what they ‘ad business for ‘im.” he looked over at the bill-counter for confirmation.
He made a sound of negation, and she knelt down to roll him over herself. John resisted as best he could, and as soon as he was on his back, put his arms over his face like a sulky child. “No! Bugger off!” he slurred. “Sh’lock… he’ll come. Save me.”
“If you like,” John replied. “I hope eventually you’ll want to, but that’s up to you.” He shimmied his shoulders luxuriantly against the pillow mound and waited.
But friends protect people.
“No,” Sherlock says. It would be funny if it wasn’t so horrifying. “The lock of hair will do its part. Now, close your eyes and focus your mind’s eye on the middle of the table, and think of your…. friend.”
Sherlock looks down. “Right. Of… Of course.”
Sherlock turns and angrily leaves the door open as he sashays away.
Sherlock swallows. His eyes glance briefly at John's, and if he didn't know better, he would have sworn there was a hint of sadness in them.
“We?”
“Of course,” John says. “Yeah, of course. You’re my best friend.”
- with your plans. You just went ahead and put yourself in bloody danger!”
“That was fun,” Sherlock says. His eyes scream terror.
,” he quotes the threatening note they thought was directed at Wilson.
As if it’s just one of his little cases with one of his obvious little answers.
“While taking care of the shaft, you want to use your hands for additional stroking, or for rubbing… his…”
“Tell you what,” Wiggins says. “Let’s make this about more than just the money. You win this game, I give you the name and location of my golden mate.” He smiles. “You lose, I take a little finger. Off you, or your ‘partner’.”
The mechanics of shooting himself in the face sound quite interesting to Sherlock now.
“Just leave, John”, Sebastian says, but he can't stop himself from muttering – “And take your boyfriend with you.”
John clenches his teeth. It’s a disturbing memory, really. His father used to come home drunk, and he’d take the beatings so Harry and his mom would be spared. The next day, his mother would tentatively make pancakes, as an unspoken apology.
John’s mouth runs dry. “So I heard, five minutes ago at this exact table, yes.”
John’s jaw drops. That git is not seriously suggesting they go through with this lunacy, is he? The case is solved, he’s not staying here for one more minute.
“John? How do you seduce people?”
John looks at the camera. He should not tell the whole of Britain about his hidden, deep affection for Major Sholto.
Suddenly Sherlock retches. He spits something into his hand.
Right. ‘
“God, Sherlock, I --”, John starts, but then pales as his eyes focus on something behind Sherlock.
That's all it takes for John to grab his empty wineglass and fling it, angrily, at Sebastian's head, who ducks away. The glass shatters against the wall.
, underlined, twice. David:
Next update: Friday.
“I feel like Mr. Darcy,” John comments as they step close.
They pant. Sherlock clings to him, trembling. They’re safe. They’re safe.
Mycroft frowns. “Are you sure?”
And Sherlock should probably concentrate more on Jonathan. He needs to stop using John as a catalyst to unlock his buried desires and emotions. How can he build a good, trusting relationship with Jonathan and open himself up if he starts the whole thing off with lies?
John excitedly follows.
“Who beat you?”
John, on his side, head resting on his elbow. Smiling indeed. A soft sun-kissed smile.
“It's not okay, Sherlock”, John almost yells, and he meets the man's gaze. Sherlock's eyes are wide, he looks stunned. John thinks back about his father. How close they are in this moment, how unhappy his father would be if he knew it.
Though surely, it’s not a big deal, is it? They’ve known each other for years. And Sherlock doesn’t have too many people in his life he can rely on. John thinks back about Hannah from camp, whom he met when he was twelve. Back home, he had a huge crush on Natalie, his mate’s older sister. But he didn’t want to make out with Natalie for her to discover he was a useless bag of chips. He needed to be 100 percent
“Errrr….” John says, but gets distracted by Karamo flexing his muscles.
Three letters.
“What?”
“Oh, tell them the story”, Sebastian tells Sam. Sandy flashes him a look. “About the kitchen.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock says in a low voice.
“That’s not true,” BenDeLa defends herself.

“You're lucky it was me who realised it was missing, not Anderson,” Lestrade says.
She turns to John. “Don’t worry, I used
After quite an uncomfortable taxi ride – the three of them in the back, Sherlock insisted on sitting in the middle but proceeded with utter silence – they arrive at Sebastian Wilkes's building. It's a tall building in the middle of the City of London, where all the finance whizz kids live – or rather, sleep, work and snort – and Wilkes apparently lives all the way up in the penthouse.
Suddenly, a gunshot rings out.
John licks his lips. He glances at Molly. Is that why she wanted him to do this show? He starts to panic. Maybe there have been times when he wondered if it could ever be something more between him and Sherlock. And lately, it has very much felt like having a family. Sometimes he’s wondered… what it would feel like to kiss Sherlock? Or go even further? But Sherlock is simply not interested, so it doesn’t matter, anyway.
a celebrity doctor,” Sherlock says.
He tries to relax. Insofar that’s possible. Sherlock’s fingers are really fucking him, now. Stretching him out. Sherlock is panting. There’s an urgency to it.
John looks up, and relief seems to wash over him to see She-lock smile.
“Who are you?” Wiggins asks, allowing Sherlock and John to join the table.
“I’m just very shy about it,” David says, surrounded by cameras. “It’s very personal to me.”
-Pads: pieces of fabric/foam that drag queens use to create more boob/hip
John knocks three times on a hotel door. It opens.
-Airline: Jujubee’s name of birth
“Me seeing your penis.”
John waits a few seconds, then moves gently up and down again. He is a doctor, after all. He knows to be careful. He's also done this with two willing girlfriends before, but never with a man, not even in the army. There would be the occasional sad shower wank in each other vicinity, then. Nothing more.
(See the end of the chapter for
This jolts Sherlock out of his illusions. John is not here… for him? He doesn’t recognise him?
“What are you doing here?” Mycroft hisses near a giant cross depicting a dying Jesus. With impressive abs, Sherlock notices.
“Oh lord. Is he dead?”
But before he can open his mouth, Bill Wiggins joins them, monkey’s tail dragging behind him.
“They were hellbent on framing me, exposing me, hurting me,” Sherlock continues.
It’s almost like hugging, except someone is usually dying.
Sherlock presses his lips together.
“I also wasn’t in L.U.V. with your dancing,” Brooke adds. “That was a Monique Heart cartwheel, henny.”
“You smile as a means of flirting,” Sherlock says, his voice in rapid deductive mode. “We come here twice a week, and usually, you choose this particular till. Is this averagely attractive young lady any faster than the others? Oh please. Even
In the background, John can see Alaska only briefly looking up, face unreadable. She remains quietly focused on her work.
“Gender is a construct,” Sherlock replies. “This could taste vile, no matter your sex.”
“Thanks... I suppose,” John says, shifting on his feet. He has taken a more military stance, Sherlock notices with some pride.
Sherlock nods. “Right… Erogenous zones.”
“Also, my dance and lip-sync were amazing...” Phi Phi says, seemingly undisturbed.
She-lock looks down. “There was only one thing I loved, and it was wearing my mother’s clothing, trying on her make-up. I studied fashion magazines. I taught myself. I became very, very good at it.”
“I’ve got street smarts, Mister Watson,” Wiggins replies. “It’s time you folded. Ready to pack?”
“This phone call… it’s… it’s my note,” Sherlock says, shakingly reaching his hand toward John, far below him on the street at St Bartholomew's Hospital.
That’s pretty much everything that’s going through John’s mind, as they wait on the stage for the judging session. In a loop.
“Don’t mind Sharon,” She-lock says. “She’s just jealous because she thinks I’m her biggest competition here, since we both do druggie drag. Junkie glam. She’s hated me ever since The Princess followed me on Instagram.”
Oh, Mycroft.
Wiggins looks none the wiser. Of course.
“I don’t know. Who am I to judge? Can’t we just bottle our feelings like normal people?”
“You’re not only… criminally attractive,” he says. “But you’re also incredibly smart. Have you ever considered going into police work? The way you solved that case…”

He slides his fingers across them carefully, adjusting them. The touch sends a shiver through his legs, an old ache. Perhaps a good wank will serve as decent stress-relief. He has earned it, after all.
Until, suddenly, Sherlock stops singing, stops mouthing along, looking briefly unsure for three long seconds.
Christ. The bravery of the soldier. John releases Sherlock’s hand. “Not the… Bond girls,” he says, and he averts his eyes. “Not so much.”
Sherlock is tied down, lying spread-eagle on a table while a man wheels a giant machine towards him. He would recognise that silhouette anywhere. Small shoulders, impeccable outfit - John instantly regrets his Star Wars tshirt - and threatening posture: it’s Jim Moriarty.
She slips him a note in his breast pocket.
Sherlock bites his lip. John’s fist clenches. The hairs in the back of his neck rise.
And at that, he touches the outside of John’s hole softly, with the tip of his middle finger. It’s already a bit loosened from the rimming. Should John try to offer instructions, like the last few times? Sherlock seems to have it covered. And anyway, John’s knowledge of anal sex is rather limited. He’ll have to trust Sherlock on this one.
-Pointer Sister: a drag queen who points to the place she’s gonna walk to, during a lip-sync or a runway walk
She-lock swallows. Oh, John.
“I’m not about to pull an Adore Delano, if that’s what you’re implying. I don’t care for Michelle’s opinions, she’s a boob queen stan.”
She-lock looks over the candidates one by one.
Sherlock positions himself at the tiny desk with a chemistry book. “You can take the bed,” he says. “I don’t need much sleep.”
But on the other hand, they’re not teenagers - quick orgasms aside. Sherlock is an adult and he took the initiative for each lesson. Moreover, virginity is a ridiculous concept and rather overrated. It’s just sex. And if it’s sex with your very best friend, isn’t that a good thing either way?
“Are you kidding?” Janine says. “I hope he stays. It’ll be bloody good for the ratings. With or without an actual murder. Closer, you little fucker!”
It is brilliant.
“How would I know your address?” Sherlock says, following John quickly up the stairs. “Easy, I’m a psychic.”
, for christ’s sakes.
Sherlock stands up.
Sherlock stares, speechless.
“You merely told a cyclist when to hit someone.”
“Go on, Poirot,” John says. “This isn’t a detective show. We have a rose ceremony to attend.”
John feels nauseous. Last night - he remembers. Sherlock’s hands on his back, softly caressing him. Not once did he hesitate to touch his scar. Nobody had ever done that with John before.
No, She-lock is probably being professional, and very non-caring about John in general. Not that John is concerned about that. Sir, no sir.
“John, if you wanted to redecorate, you could have told me, because obviously I’m gayer than the Fab Five mixed in a blender with an avocado, and actually, John, if you wanted me, you could have told me seven years ago. I’ve always, always been yours,” he breathes against John’s lips. “Always.”
“Right, no more knife on the mantle, even though Rosie’s too young to reach up there anyway. Tedious! And they better have stored Billy away safely or I’ll hunt them down. I’ve already deduced where they live. Those sofa cushions are horrendous. Was Bobby trying to gender-bend again? And a kitchen island? For crying out loud. Why do we need one?”
“Oh yes, I saw you interrogating him during dance rehearsal. Very cunning!”
“Here’s my number. If you ever need to practise your massage skills for real.”
“Wait, why didn’t
“Mmmh,” he breathes.
“I didn’t mean for this to happen!” John says, looking apologetic. “It’s involuntarily. Something must have set it off.”
The safety curtain rises. The stage is set.
“I don't know what that was, Sherlock, but if it was something that you needed to get out of your system, that's okay. We can stop now, and it will change nothing between us. We will still be friends.” Sherlock winces underneath his soft touch.
“Oh, please. How emotional can sucking a cock be?”
He flips a few pages.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary!”
Sherlock gets out John’s flaccid penis and releases some of the... tension. In his bladder, of course. This is the weirdest thing he’s ever done, he thinks, as the last of it disappears down the urinal’s drain. He shakes John’s penis to get rid of the last drops and -
Under the table, he moves his fingers across Sherlock’s index finger. Slowly. Suggestively.
“When you... sober up”, Sherlock says, still not looking at him.
John raises his eyebrows. Bold move, mate. Bold move.
Sherlock looks up expectantly. But John, it seems, is just staring at his own feet.
“A thorough exploration of all of the combat zones is are very important,” Sholto says.
put you in that casket.”
Bursting with anger, he pushes into David. David stumbles backward, and falls hard on the floor. John feels his fist itch with want, but when he looks up, he sees the cameraman smiling eagerly, going from him to David, to Sherlock, who stands frozen.
Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race... She-lock and John took a dance class. John interrogated her; she thought he was flirting. She invited him to her hotel room...
Moriarty laughs, mad as a hatter. “How touching.” He steps closer. “Speaking of touching… Did you like my little gift?”
The camera frames the large black cab. Karamo’s in the front, the rest of the Fab Five are cheering behind him.
In each pub, Sherlock refuses to drink. He grabs a beer just like John, but barely sips it, making John feel self conscious about drinking his. Maybe it would be wise to stay more vigilant, indeed, and not become intoxicated? There is, after all, a would-be murderer on the loose.
Sherlock squeezes John’s hands and quits his mumbling.
Sherlock holds onto John’s hands as to a life raft. It’s not so much that the room is spinning. it’s that the room was spinning all along and now has stopped.
He stands so close, he watches every detail of it happen on Sherlock’s face. First, the drop of a bottom lip, just slightly. Then, the crumpling of his nose. The long fall of Sherlock’s adam’s apple. And finally, seeking a fast death, the trace of a single tear to his lips.
“Let’s not take that chance, shall we?” Bobby says.
“Mrs. Thames”, Sebastian addresses his girlfriend, still trying to make the murder mystery dinner happen, “As Herlock's hot landlady, what can you tell us about him?”
“Yes, like stomach acid.”
She-lock hasn’t said a word since their kiss and their subsequent lip-sync, dance and runway posing. But surely that has nothing to do with that transfer of dark blue lipstick. Kind of like a positive STD, now that John thinks about it. Or something.
All British? She-lock knows exactly what this is: the producers apparently really want her to stay in the competition. They’re giving her an edge - it’s an advantage to be speaking the same language as your victim. They want her to bond with her vet, throwing ‘blimey, mates’ all around the work room. It’s a reverse Thorgy.
Sherlock is awake, and looks nervously at Moriarty. “Re-enacting Goldfinger? It’s not our favourite. You should stick to Glee.”
“Like an amateur tabloid press, a cesspool of fans, the vilest gathering place of mean girls”, She-lock says. “Naturally, I’m one of the top posters.”
Sherlock just blinks.
John thinks about his ex-girlfriends who wore high heels to work, or to parties.
John nods. He can see the logic there. He could make more of an effort sometimes, he supposes. Especially if he’s going out in public with Sherlock, who’s always impeccably dressed.
“I suppose you’ve all seen the article by now,” Jonathan starts.
pleased to see you,” Lestrade says. “But I
Sherlock quickly complies, but John notices how he rubs his erect penis against the bed in anticipation.
“Yes, don’t you know?” Trixie says. “BenDeLa hates competition!”
John hears Sherlock get up and dust off his trousers behind him. God. John just can’t bring himself to open his eyes and have eye contact, now. But he should, perhaps. Look at how he’s lying here, arse up like an idiot.
“I got lost in the hair product cupboard,” John says, whipping a pancake on Sherlock’s plate.
“Oh hunty, that’s botox.”
“I have to do one more surprise elimination before the wedding,” Jonathan says. “I wish I could throw out you and Sherlock together, since you’re a package deal anyway. But Janine keeps threatening the next four generations of my lineage.”
John angrily pushes the button to the second floor.
Confusion crosses John’s face for an unbearable instant. Has Sherlock overplayed his hand? But then Sherlock can see his jaw resetting, determinedly, before John stretches his arms on the table. Palms up.
Not… gay? Not bi?
“You! You did this to me!” he says. “You’re trying to eliminate the competition by… by cheating!”
“This is humiliating,” he complains.
In the corner of his eye, he sees John raising an eyebrow.
John finds his bank card and smiles at the cashier.
“Does she do it any differently than Sherlock?” Karamo asks. “Is he stepping up as an adult in Rosie’s life?”
Sherlock looks at his feet, presses his lips together. Then, he disappears without saying another word.
“John, I’m gay.”
“Put on some clothes at least, woman,” he insists, not even very shakily. That’s a win.
“Jonathan Smalls did stab Wiggins, that much is clear,” Sherlock says. “But only because Wiggins found out about his affair with Bainbridge. Wiggins walked in on them while he was…”
?” John lifts his eyebrows.
Sherlock blinks.
“No,” Sherlock agrees. “It’s rather hot.”
Oh no.

He straightens his back, and, staring levelly at the wall in front of him, he slowly unzips John’s trousers, reaches in…
or anything”, Sherlock continues. “So please. Just let me… experiment. I know you’ve done this in the army. I’ve deduced it.”
“Mycroft wanted you to find me,” Sherlock finally says.
“John, no,” Sherlock says, keeping his hands in the air.
Ru leaves, and the queens take their new family to their work stations to get to know them. She-lock turns to her assignment. It’s more painful than ripping off tit tape -
“Yes, I know, that would be Ellen Degeneres, probably,” Sherlock mumbles. “But Tan means, who do you aspire to look like?”
“How did you know I was a doctor?”
Sherlock sniffs indignantly. She must be new here.
John is not religious, but now he’s praying for help. Bloody erogenous zones.
The boys are shopping at Tesco when suddenly, Sherlock asks an odd question.
Sherlock’s heart stills. Oh. Of course. It’s not about him - why would John ever? He’s never even flirted with him. They lived together, for God’s sake. If anything could have happened, it would have, ages ago, and even then….
Much like John’s heartbeat.
“There’s always time for a cocktail,” Katya says, three cigarettes already perched between her lips.
“Right…” she says. “Come here.”
John turns toward Sherlock, glaring. He’s still standing uncomfortably close, but the stream of cruel comments has stopped. That's a sign of self-control, John reckons, because Sherlock must be absorbing about a hundred details right now: the hitching of breath, the flustered laugh of the lady, and the light red discoloration in his neck. John can imagine it all too well. A complete arse, he is.
“Do you trust me?” he asks John, looking him in the eye intensely.
He should get a punch card for each time that happens, actually. Five times drugged, get one free.
For a short minute, the room is filled with steady wanking noises. Then, while pulling on his cock, Sherlock puts his other hand on John’s ass cheek. A tiny noise leaves Sherlock’s back throat, like a cry for help. He picks up speed. Meanwhile, his other hand travels down, forcefully pulling one cheek aside. Trying to get a glimpse -
“What did you do?” John shouts, panicking as the laser beam starts moving slowly up between Sherlock’s legs again, cutting the table in half.
“And no less gay,” She-lock adds. But Captain Watson doesn’t laugh.
“Downstairs,” Bobby says. “With Sherlock.”
“We’re not army veterans,” Lestrade says. “I mean, look at the shape of us lot! We’re members of Scotland Yard, and we’ve been undercover to investigate threats being made to Miss Visage.”
Dutifully, Sherlock wraps his long fingers around the base of his cock, and looks at it, almost in wonder. Like it’s the most glorious thing he’s ever seen. Lightly, he gives it a stroke, and even though it’s clumsy, it’s the hottest thing John has ever seen. There’s just something about introducing someone else to sex that’s incredibly arousing to John.
Neither Mary nor Janine nor Jonathan Wilson are around. There’s a tired looking cameraman across from them to record their morning faces, though. If he zooms too closely, John might show him his morning middle finger.
“What?” Todrick yells, angling for more screen time.
“You are loved,” John says. “Damn it. I can’t… I thought I’d lost you, Sherlock. Lost you forever. Our chance, my chance… There are things I haven’t said. Ever. And I thought I’d have to whisper them… to a grave.”
Sherlock’s air quotes were dramatically affected and intended to make John smile, which it did, faintly. “Hang on a moment, I’ll be right back.” He hopped up from the chair and headed to the door, again speaking to someone out in the hallway. Then he was stepping backwards into the room and holding arms out to receive Rosamund Watson, sleepy and soft, clad in a mint-green fleece romper. Behind him, Amina slipped into the room, smiling ‘hello’ at John and dropping a bulging diaper bag on the floor by the wall before plopping into the other guest chair and pulling out her phone to fiddle with.
He got up at suppertime, and gave Amina a break by making a simple pasta dinner for them before she left to teach Aikido at the dojo where she trained. Then Rosie needed a bath; John was wistfully charmed by his child’s splashing in the tub and her fascination with water scooped into a set of colorful cups and poured out again. Then it was pajamas, and a story, and a cuddle, and bed. Rosie was delighted with all of it, even the going to bed, since her stuffed elephant was waiting there for her with its blue fuzzy fabric smooth and soft against her pink cheek.
John, still blinking at the notion of Sherlock calling him ‘quite fit,’ had agreed and said his goodnights without looking his friend in the eye.
They paused there for a few moments, just being together and savoring the newness of it all. When Sherlock pulled back a little, John ducked his head to catch his eye. They gazed at each other for a long beat, faint smiles on their faces. John leaned in for a gentle kiss, lingering and sweet.
“A run? Why?” Sherlock asked, and peered down at his friend, causing unexpected double-chins to appear at his neck.
New facets of behavior also began to present themselves when John was actually using his computer when Sherlock was nearby. John stopped allowing his friend to lean in and read over his shoulder; he changed the password every other day; he clamped the lid closed if Sherlock passed too close. And most disturbing of all, a faint blush occasionally stained his cheeks and once or twice an expression of guilt? Furtiveness? What was that? Would cross his features and John would ‘head out for some air’ in order to deflect Sherlock’s scrutiny – though not without leaving the laptop with Mrs. Hudson.
He waved off her concern. Something about that statement niggled at him. “Not to worry. John will tell you I’m the last one to be proper at any gathering. So, what did Richard die of? An illness, I think John said?”
“Round and round the garden, like a teddy bear,” he mused under his breath, then spoke more loudly. “Rosie will want to know about her mother,” he suggested.
“Mrph... wha time ‘sit?” John rolled over in his bed, squinting at the red digits on the nightstand. 3:09 AM glowed indifferently back at him. He had become much too familiar with this time of night since Mary died.
But he, himself? That James might have loved him only made him feel a sort of wistful regret for the pain he must have caused his friend. He compared his feelings for James with those for women he’d fancied, to how he’d felt about Mary at the beginning, even. Something missing there, with James. Yes, he cared strongly about the man, felt grateful to him for his care, honored his sacrifices and appreciated his wisdom. But his feelings lacked the element of desire, the urge to claim and possess, that his love affairs had been flavored with. While he did his best not to be a dick about it, he was somewhat possessive of his lovers; and those crushes he’d had that hadn’t come to anything still were colored through that lens of
He’d watch crap telly, or ridiculous YouTube videos, or obsessively read immersive fantasy novels far into the quiet hours of the early morning, wrapped in his dressing gown and a blanket, shivering when the heating program put the temperature down to save energy. When he couldn’t keep his eyes open a moment longer, he’d drag himself off to bed.
“Not really hungry, no. But I could come with you if you fancy thirds,” Sherlock offered. He desperately wanted a cup of tea, but not enough to eat an omelet to get it.
John hit him with a pillow. Then kissed him for a very long time.
“It’s enough to be his best friend?” Duck asked with carefully mild curiosity, propping his chin on his curled fists which were braced on his knees.
John felt a leaden tightness in his chest, that stayed with him for the rest of the day; but if anyone noticed, they didn’t comment.
John blinked. “What?”
Conversation was flowing easily between the four of them when Marjorie joined their group. She was taller than John but shorter than his own height, with long chestnut hair pulled back in a severe bun. She wore a flattering pastel dress but no makeup and little jewelry – not wearing her wedding ring any longer, Sherlock noted, but the tan line was still minutely visible. He could see she worked in a chemical lab, consistent with her job in pharma research, had no pets, and couldn’t take her eyes off John. Sherlock didn’t like the intense way she looked him over, top to bottom and back again, with a glint of possessiveness in her perusal. He narrowed his eyes at her and regarded her down his nose.
best friend, who he had only barely come to grips with having feelings for at all - let alone considering himself ready to be acting on them. Once they’d begun though, it seemed the most natural thing in the world. John couldn’t stop kissing, catching Sherlock’s soft lips -
Abruptly Sherlock lurched forward and wrapped John tightly in his long arms, breathing a sigh that sounded very like John’s name against the top of his head. He heaved deep breaths in and out, and John could feel the tension wound tight in the body that held him. The doctor and father in him couldn’t help but try to soothe, speaking in a crooning singsong. “Hey now, Sherlock, it’s all right. I’m all right.” His own arms had come up around his lanky friend, so he rubbed one hand up and down against Sherlock’s spine and returned the hug firmly until he felt the muscles under his hands lose some of their thrumming rigidity.
“I’m no stranger to tinkering with my brain chemistry, John, as you well know.”
Sherlock regarded the man levelly. “An opportunity, yes. Do you know Amanda Wilmington?”
Marjorie’s mouth dropped open and she blinked for a moment. “What? What’s that? Brigid, you must be mistaken. John, you’re not with …
Sherlock blushed. He, Sherlock Holmes, international reputation and deductive genius, blushed like a schoolgirl! At the thought of spending the afternoon with John. In their room. Together.
“Yeah,” Duck agreed. “I convinced them to put in this ring path for my runs - it’s something I do with many of the people I work with. But the grounds were already well established before I ever got here.”
“How long did it take to clear up?” Duck asked, intrigued curiosity in his tone.
John looked away from his friend’s kind gaze, swallowing against the unexpected tightness in his throat.
He pulled in another deep breath and blew it out with a whoosh as Sherlock demanded details from Lestrade in his usual arrogant tones, and then had to repeat himself, as Lestrade entirely ignored him.
“Bloody pretentious cock thinks he can do anything, and there’s a criminal, too,” John cracked to Lestrade after they had interviewed the main suspect, a trust fund kid who made threats about his father’s lawyers and his family’s connections and seemed in no way perturbed that his sometimes-girlfriend had been violently murdered in her flat. Sherlock met the little twat’s fronting with cold arrogance of his own, methodically deconstructing the bluster and determining that the youth might be a prick, but he couldn’t have murdered their victim.
Instead, he picked up the trite novel he’d been reading that afternoon, and slogged along through another few chapters before changing into the pajamas he saw Sherlock had left on the bureau, enthusiastically brushing his teeth for the first time in three days, and settling down to sleep. As he lay there in the not-quite dark, listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the facility at night, he wondered what the next morning would bring.
John dropped his head into his hands as he sat on the side of the bed, legs suddenly rubbery with after-reaction.
When they finally settled down by rigidly staring ahead and breathing deeply, Sherlock found that the irritation he had been holding for John and his inexplicable half-declaration of the morning had dissipated. He was willing to stick out this wedding, and then would have a very serious talk with his friend and hear what he had been going to say, whether John liked it or not.
monologue cut off mid-word. “What do I think of him? He’s a fucking murderer, probably a hired hit man.”
When they were out of sight, but not out of earshot, Amina persisted. “Well, then? How did you get a strangling, eh? Because I’ve seen enough marks like that when my students mess about in class to know what finger marks look like.”
John awoke the next day feeling tired. He had spent a comfortable afternoon with Rosie and Sherlock, heading indoors after John started to worry about Rosie’s fair skin, and even Sherlock was showing a little color. They had talked some more about John’s appointment with Duck, and what being in counseling would be like. John didn’t feel comfortable raising Sherlock’s hopes, and stayed guarded on the whole topic. Sherlock seemed to take that as self-conscious pessimism on John’s part and tried, in his own emotionally tone-deaf way, to encourage him as he left for the evening, Rosie asleep against his shoulder.
Sherlock said quietly, “or she hid it well.”
They managed to skip the reception line altogether and made their way over to the hall, where a hearty wedding lunch was planned since it was mid-afternoon. The dancing would likely go on as long as the staff could be convinced to stay, however. Sherlock looked wistfully at the dance floor, remembering his lessons with John in their flat, so long ago. How he had loved those afternoons, thinking it was the chance to dance he had enjoyed. In retrospect, he knew it was dancing with John. He looked over at his friend, just in time to see the silvering head turn away and scan the room, looking for their place cards.
For a while he merely basked, occasionally renewing the steam with splashes of water from the bucket, sipping from his bottled water, breathing deeply of the heated, steamy air. The calm quiet and all-encompassing physical sensations of the sauna brought to mind last night’s dreams and their results, and while the heat dampened much of anything, he was still aware of his groin feeling full. He replayed the dream in his mind, enjoying having a response from his libido after so long without, but was soon diverted as it brought to mind the conversation he’d had with Duck about James, and John, and men...
Sherlock strode from the bathroom into the sitting room, which was unexpectedly empty. He looked in the kitchen; also empty. Where was John? He should have been waiting, putting down his tea to jump up and follow Sherlock promptly back to his bedroom. Sherlock stood there, unaccountably disappointed and more than a little disgruntled, until the chill in the air reminded him he was entirely starkers. With a huff, he stalked back to the bedroom to dress.
John regarded him with a raised eyebrow. “I doubt I would find anyone with a similar set of circumstances to mine, Sherlock. Unless there’s a group for anger-challenged, assassin’s widowers whose best friends came back from the dead?” John’s tone tried for jovial, yet he didn’t miss the fleeting stricken look on his friend’s face as the comment passed. Sherlock resumed his poker face in an instant, but John still felt like a heel. He sighed. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes, actually. It’s only a few months along. But yeah, me and Sherlock… are, yeah.” He slid an arm around Sherlock’s waist, cozying up to him where he leaned on the bar. Sherlock put an arm around John’s shoulders and lazily kissed his cheek, then regarded Marjorie’s distress with a superior smirk.
Kudos to EllieSaxon, who spotted my utterly cunning plot twist way back in Chapter 2! Brainy is the new sexy, you know.
Duck and John exchanged a look - John’s rueful, Duck’s thoughtful. “Yeah,” John said. “He’s always like that.”
They were neither at their most precise after the whiskey, so their aim was off a bit. What Sherlock expected to be a more lingering kiss like they had shared earlier, instead was a series of soft touches that made Sherlock’s mind spin with sensation: the lithe body in his arms, a hand sliding up his shoulder to skim into the curls at his nape and another slipping around to his lower back; John’s lips, mellow but insistent, returning for press after press against his own; John’s breath whispering past his ear, against his skin. He attempted to record it all and could not – there was too much. John’s mouth returned again, slightly wet as his lips opened and latched to Sherlock’s lower lip individually; Sherlock’s lips parted with his gasp. John’s tongue made darting little licks to each of Sherlock’s lips in turn: first top, then bottom, then top again, then dipping in for a brief taste of tongues touching, then a deeper, exploratory tangling. Sherlock realized he was ferociously hard, his erection pressing against his trousers uncomfortably. His hands had been sweeping up and down John’s spine, caressing the red cashmere and the muscles beneath; now they clutched the fabric as he clung to John.
John furrowed his brow in profound thought.
“And that’s supposed to help, is it? Just relax and not be bored anymore? Excellent advice, I don’t know why I’ve never considered that.” Sherlock stated waspishly.
“The Naloxone you were given lists crying as a side effect. Of course, given the email you sent, you may be upset to still be alive. It’s understandable. You have your pride; when you decide to do a thing you must do it well or not at all. And yet here you are, and while I can understand it, I cannot sympathize, John. In this instance, I am glad you cocked it up. I could wish you hadn’t decided to do it at all, but I won’t presume to tell you what to think. I’m just thankful I got to you in time.”
"My hand, why?"
In the face of this wisdom, John lost his desperate bid to remain stoic. He sobbed into Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms slipping around the lean torso, clinging pitifully while something deep down, full of fetid, spiraling recrimination and inward-focused hatred, cracked open and in the tiniest trickle, drop by slow, minuscule drop, began to drain away.
“Well, Dr Watson,” the woman chirped, “it looks like you’re getting settled in alright?” She plopped her tablet on the rolling side table near the wide window, and started typing, hardly looking up at either occupant of the room. She shot a few dirty looks out the window, seeming to be irritated by the glare, or possibly by the bright flowers and shrubs.
The conversation started back up once everyone had eaten as much as they were going to; John asked what had happened to Stephen – he was sorry this business had overshadowed the wedding. Brigid snorted with a bit of restored vigor; turns out the bride’s family thought the excitement was a great thing and they would be the talk of their circles for years. Stephen and his bride were more aware of the human costs, but had still gone on the elaborate honeymoon the bride’s father had booked them. There was little they could do to help at the moment, and the tickets were bought. They had flown out last night on a later flight than originally planned.
There was someone in the room. A dark form loomed at the bedside, reaching for him.
He leaned back as Sherlock's face went still, his brow furrowed, and his breathing became more measured. In the diffuse afternoon light coming through the curtains, John could see the pulse beating fast at Sherlock's throat. He realized he had been holding his breath, and let it out slowly. The room grew quiet. John looked at his watch and nodded.
The woman regarded him calmly, untroubled by his antics and observing his discombobulation with bovine serenity. “When my head gets full, I put the outside around it,” she declared in a round contralto at odds with her slight frame. “The bees can get out with all that space, and they like the flowers.” With that, she turned and ambled up the hallway. John noticed she was only wearing one slipper and her other foot was bare, but the day was warm and she didn’t seem bothered by it. He watched her go with bemusement for another moment before taking her odd advice and pushing out the door to the garden.
Sherlock nodded soberly. “You?”
Jones made a show of brushing the bottom of the bag off before handing it back to Marjorie, who took it with modestly good grace. “S’right, Cap, din’t want it to get all in the mud,” he said, “must’a got a bit enthusiastic afore you came along.”
The man grinned with delight. “Murdered! My goodness, how terrible!” His words were appropriate to the tragedy, but his tone implied approving surprise. “How was it done?” John realized in that moment that they were dealing with a true psychopath, someone who lacked the slightest bit of empathy for other people. This man could easily have murdered someone just for the fun of it, or because he was curious about what a human liver looked like up close.
“Well, there you have it.” Sherlock pronounced, waving the matter off as inconsequential. “This will be the same. People will take care with you for a while, as you work back to health, as you say. After a bit, everything will go back to normal.” He took John’s hand and squeezed with his big paw. “As much as that is possible for you and I,” he said with a half-smirk.
Sherlock began to stir, and emitted a purring sort of yawn. He rolled his head under John’s hand, forehead sliding on the mattress until he was facing toward John, and sleepily smiled. He made no move to get out from under the fingers against his scalp. “Hello,” he said, and drew in a big sighing breath. “You’re awake.”
Spike tried to keep his poker face as Sherlock continued, but it was cracking at the edges. “You met up with her last night, intending to get a leg over. When she refused and offered you cash, you became enraged. It didn’t help that you’d been sampling the goods in order to enhance your tryst with Ms. Wilmington; you had a loud row, which her neighbors all heard and thought was the boyfriend. She demanded, and then threatened, and then begged and you lost your temper and snapped; and before you knew it, so... had... her... NECK.” With each of these last few words, Spike flinched as if slapped, breathing like a bellows. The room descended into silence, punctuated by the click of the latch as Jack took his chance to flee.
“Not arguing with you there, mate,” Duck replied, then took pity on John’s stewing discomfort and adroitly changed the subject.
Sherlock paused the playback, then set it to run at 1/3 speed. He leaned back and stretched himself too, long and tall, blowing out a breath with a loud whoosh. He glanced over at John then looked over more pointedly a second time. “What,” he murmured, voice hushed in the soundproofed room. “John, what is it?”
John put down his fork and regarded his relatives somberly, considering his words. “Tim, Aunt Brigid, it’s not for you to be sorry. Marjorie is… well, she’s ill; and she did some awful things because of it. She was very good at hiding it, but that’s not your fault. Sherlock and I, we come up against people who are greedy, or malicious or just plain bad all the time in our work, and she wasn’t that.” He cut a bite of omelet and chewed it philosophically while he ruminated. “We’ve had much worse in our time together, him and me,” he took Sherlock’s hand as Sherlock nodded.
John thought. “And then,” he said, turning his back to Sherlock with careful steps on the steel beam. “You’ll need to unclip one of those ropes back there, and I’ll attach it to you on the big ring in back. That way, if you fall, you’re facing downward and attached by the middle of your body. You’ll still bloody swing around and bash into things, but you won’t pull your arm off, or pass out from the blood rushing to your head while someone comes to get you.”
John thought the view rather nice. “Yes, I seem to have arrived,” he said wryly.
The song ended, and the DJ announced the next phase of wedding obligations would be coming up: cake, first dances, and the throwing of the bouquet. Sherlock barely registered it.
When he got back there he had cooled off considerably, and the sweat between his shoulder blades had started to feel chilly on his skin. As he entered, he peeled off the hoodie and chucked it on his bed; intending to have a wash and change clothes back into pajamas after using the head.
“So when you get it… it’s overwhelming, yeah?” John said. Sherlock nodded. “I get it, Sherlock. We can stop, if you want?” John checked Sherlock’s face and smiled at the outraged frown the question produced. Sherlock tensed his abdominals again, nudging John with his erection. John chuckled, and nudged back with his own. “That’s a no, then.” He leaned in to kiss the tip of Sherlock’s nose, then heaved himself up to sitting. He unbuttoned his shirt and took it off, throwing it over the side of the bed, then laid his arms out to the side. “Here’s what we’ll do. I’m all yours – have at me.” And he flopped back on the pile of ridiculous pillows behind him.
"You've never talked about being shot before."
“Annnnd?” John echoed, still peering at the shopping bag when the penny dropped. “And - that’s a corner of a flannel shirt poking out the back through that little tear. Jesus, Sherlock, how… you saw that, with your mind half distracted on - well, on me, I guess, and you still picked that out? ‘S fucking amazing, you know that? Even after all this time, just… extraordinary.” John rocked back a half step, bowled over by the brilliance Sherlock demonstrated so casually, as if anyone could do it. He was itching to lean in and kiss Sherlock where he sat, so impressed was he.
“Now, John, there’s nothin’ t’apologize for. Your girl here is a pure delight to watch, and I’m happy to do it. We’ve become friends, you an’ I, haven’t we? Friends help out.” She chucked John on the shoulder, not at all as gently as she had Rosie; he rubbed the spot absently. “And it’s what you pay me for, so I come out ahead, don’t I?” She laughed musically, eyes sparkling.
Sherlock stepped back a pace, the gown held reverently in his hands so John could step out of it. Beneath, John wore the scarlet garters, black silk stockings and a shaping garment to sculpt his waist a bit - and the silver knickers. It was clear that John had not been unaffected by their proximity tonight, his tumescent prick pressed to one side and escaping from the dance cup beneath the underwear. He raised an eyebrow inquiringly.
“There is such a thing as bisexual, you know,” he said forcefully. “Sherlock makes me happy. What’s wrong with that?” He had stood up straight, bristling with offended annoyance.
“So?” demanded Sherlock.
“Mr. Davies, I think you’ll want to talk to me,” Sherlock’s cultured, deep voice rolled in stark contrast to the light tones of the bill-counter, who John was surprised to learn was the Mack Davies that wanker had described back at the Yard. The kid had made him sound like Freddie Krueger in a slim tie and waistcoat, and this scrawny git didn’t look all that terrifying. His sidekick, however... well. That bloke was bad news if John was any judge.
They all said hello, and Aunt Brigid insisted ‘the boys’ go fix themselves plates before they had even sat down. Sherlock shrugged, and dutifully headed for the buffet. Once there, he and John exchanged suppressed smiles, then strode over and ordered from the gloomy attendant. Somehow, using doctorly charm that Sherlock didn’t understand and certainly didn’t possess, John was able to quietly take the fellow aside and suggest that he give up the motorcycle. The omelets they received were two inches thick, and absolutely delicious.
“That’s true,” John agreed, “before your Mum passed, she carried you in her belly just like that.”
“Just... What might be on your mind, yeah?” Greg scruffed a hand over the back of his neck and up through his short spiky hair as he came out from behind his desk and crossed to look John earnestly in the eyes. “Are you sure you’re ready to get back in the thick of it?”
“You said something like that yesterday, while you were… loopy,” Sherlock mused. “That you’d stay with me even if I never wanted more.” He turned to pin John with his gaze. “But I do want more, John! I just have no idea what I want, or how to do any of it. Where does one even begin? I could be rubbish at it, you know, and you’d be saddled with a terrible lover for the rest of our lives.” This time he actually clapped a hand over his mouth before more appallingly inane sniveling could come out. Where on earth had his vaunted control gone?
~~oOo~~
Yes, that too - Sherlock had kissed back, after all.
“Not to worry, Doctor. You can make a cuppa and some toast in the break room, how does that sound?” The nurse had an unexpectedly impish smile on her severe face, and John realized she had been taking the piss. “But no more deliveries, hmm? I had to turn back four patients who were following their noses to join your little dinner party the other night.” She shook a finger at him.
John pulled his gun from the small of his back and pointed it at the man’s head. He barked  “alright now, Spike, mate, stay right where you are. If you come one step closer, I will shoot you, do you understand?”
John thought.
John blew out a long breath. He hadn’t been asleep, not really, but the memories he’d been wandering in were certainly bad enough to qualify. “I guess I was,” he said. “Er, thanks.”
The mattress rocked again as Sherlock got up. “Amina and I are going to find the canteen and bring you some tea; whatever they’ll bring on the tray will be horrible, no doubt. We shan’t be long.” Before John could summon a rejoinder, the door was closing behind them.
His brow creased; something had been odd about the quick visual perusal he had made on his beeline from door to loo, but he couldn’t quite place it.
“Love him,” John said. “Sh...lock…”
John scrubbed at his face and looked up, “I…,” his mobile features twisted with remembered anguish. “I thought it was a trick, at least at first. She’d lied and lied, Duck. I never knew what was true with her. Didn’t even know her right name, just the one she’d put on when I met her. Christ,” he scoffed, “she said she’d named Rosie after herself, but was that even true? There’s not really any way to know for sure, now.”
Sherlock realized what John was getting at, finally. He was worried he had pressured Sherlock into doing something he would regret and it would damage their friendship. How little he knew that the regret would come when he had to stop! Sherlock huffed impatiently. “John, I’m a grown man, and I know that I don’t have to pretend to be your boyfriend so we can stay friends.” His face softened. “While I… appreciate your care for my sensibilities, I’ll be fine. And we’ll be fine, afterwards.”
John popped up between them, blowing out a whooshing breath and handing the pen back to Sherlock. “Well, that’s all signed, in duplicate, et cetera. What’s next?” He looked from one man to the other, surprised by the new bonhomie between them. “What?”
A moment passed while Sherlock collected himself and calmed his racing pulse. “Come to the mirrors and see,” he said, smiling somewhat manically and pulling John over to the corner. They both looked into the glass.
“The scrapes we’ve found have been positioned for someone of your height or just below. Statistically speaking, if he were a man, he’d be on the short side - not likely to inspire confidence in potential employers of his skills.”
A half hour later, Sherlock was absorbed in an increasingly interesting conversation about John’s escapades as rugby captain in secondary school (there were pictures! Of John, in the uniform! Probably muddy… He must convince Aunt Brigid to send them to him.) and what he was like as a young man. John never let go of Sherlock’s hand unless it was to stroke his forearm or put his arm around lean shoulders, like he thought he needed to keep contact or their new understanding would evaporate. Sherlock didn’t mind; he occasionally found himself shooting John a look that said “really? This is us now?” and meeting the same look in his (more than) friend’s eyes. Sherlock couldn’t remember ever feeling so marvelous without chemical help.
Then the lovely motion stopped; John’s hand returning to his shoulder while he blinked at the people standing up around him, applauding. He stood also, just in time to see the bride and groom grinning like fools and walking back down the aisle, hand in hand. The service was over, and the veritable platoon of groomsmen and bridesmaids were trooping out two by two to the strains of ‘Ode to Joy’ being butchered by the organist in the gallery. Marjorie went by on the arm of a strapping young usher, glaring daggers at Sherlock as she passed. He smiled beatifically at her and put his own arm around John, who looked up at him and smiled. (Holmes one, Step-Whatsit nothing.)
Just as he was about to cast around for a reason to do another lap of the garden while he thought furiously, John tugged him over to one of the shady benches and sat down. “You’re thinking awfully hard, Sherlock.” He raised his eyebrows inquiringly.
Sherlock paused in the doorway, blocking John’s exit as he looked back. “How long?” He asked tersely, fixing Duck with a sharp stare one last time.
Sherlock shakes his head. “We packed very lightly, you know. You want to go to Disneyland… Dressed in Valentino suits?”
case though? Johh sighs. They've been bored out of their minds for days. Proof: Sherlock is reading a popular science book.
“We figured out very quickly the same had happened to you two,” Moriarty says, touting her lips. “The harness thing was quite… amusing.”
Sherlock Holmes is definitely gay.
“No”, Lestrade says. “The production team wants to keep his reactions... genuine.”
“Take his hand,” John orders. He knows this drill from many awkward dates. The adrenaline makes you bond faster with someone. Hand holding helps - in several ways.
John steps forward, hesitantly. He bends over to untie his shoelaces, while She-lock works very very hard - not to look over.
Probably it’s for the best to put a stop to it now, John reckons. They went too far, last night. John needs to step away and allow this all to naturally happen.
Jonathan sniffs. “Right. Sherlock.”
Irene points at Sherlock’s lips. John groans. The kissing - yes, there might have been some excess saliva. But he was just so overwhelmed with lust. He’s not usually… This little in control. But it’s Sherlock. It’s forbidden fruit that now can finally breach his lips. And yes, his mouth is watering for it.
“Sister? I thought he was my daddy,” She-lock winks.
John winces visibly, and Sherlock quickly pulls back his hand.
, that pompous dick.
Finally, John gets one leg free. On to the other one. He bites the rope - if only he had those iron teeth now - and pulls on it. In the corner of his eye, he watches the beam moving slowly upward.
Oh god, he hadn’t even thought of pooping yet.
close to his body.
“Sixty. Five now, fifty-five after I get my clothes back.”
Sherlock immediately moves as far away from John as possible.
Mycroft’s mouth twitches in anger, and he lifts his blindfold. He motions to the chess board. “The way is not blocked, it’s right there.”
She-lock rolls her eyes. Right. God save the Queen. Being queer was illegal until the late sixties and gays have only been allowed to marry each other since bloody 2014. She’s got tucking panties older than that.
There is no denying. Sherlock is coming in his pants.
“He does?”
“Good. You see, I have a party to attend, and I need your expertise.”
Is that John ‘falling’ into Sherlock’s body? If Sherlock is inside John’s, that would make sense. However, it’s slightly inconvenient if one’s body is standing on the edge of a strikingly tall building.
Bold move from someone who only sucked a cock
Likely, John reckons. This Jonathan Wilson guy is a celebrity doctor - he was in a show called ‘Top Doctors’, and has appeared as a specialist (and eye candy) on numerous talk shows.
Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race... Shangela was found in a box, and immediately wheeled off set. DI Lestrade pulled John aside to tell him about a new threat made to Michelle Visage: a 'bloodbath' full of rubber ducks in her bathroom. Oh, and Ru was just about to announce "one more thing..."
Sherlock blinks. “Can’t we just go to the hotel spa? I’m not... unreasonable. I’m open to compromise.”
They freeze.
“Oh, you’re early,” She-lock says confidently. “I was just slipping into something more comfortable.”
Sherlock’s face appears.
“Very Detox,” Michelle says, “But that weirdly didn’t bother me. You’re my kind of winner.”
“Oh, sorry…” John says, looking a little dazed from the wall to his knuckles. “I was so sure… I thought there was a hidden space behind this, just like in Spec… Um, a film I saw. I thought there were more clues, like the massage oil.”
... I've been dying to say it...
‘Stayin’ Alive’ by The Bee Gees.
Bainbridge stares at his feet, tears falling. Where is his military training now? John straightens his back.
John doesn’t know how she managed to finish her garments while sleeping half the time, but they do look amazing. Dimm-cock regards John smugly.
“We’ll have to change inside the car, John,” Sherlock slurs with plastic in his mouth. “To remain inconssssspicuous.”
John exhales.
“You look like a million dollars,” Trixie tells Phi Phi. “I mean, a million RuDollars.”
Like a subdued beast. Whatever might happen if Sherlock touches it?
“Yes you can.” Sherlock’s eyes harden. “You’re not a homophobe, are you?”
“Deep exploration is advised,” Sholto says. “Though be aware of the possibility of friendly fire. Take out the enemy’s soldiers.”
When there’s no response, Mycroft turns and leaves. But Sherlock can’t quite face the crowd yet. He finds that he needs to stand underneath the Jesus statue until his shaking is under control. He’s never been this shaken up - Mycroft is… right. This is a serious matter to John, at least so long as he really believes Sherlock is dead. And by dressing up, Sherlock has made it his responsibility to make sure this is a proper goodbye. The only one he can give him.
“Wow,” Katya says, eyeing BenDeLa en Ru. “I would’ve noticed it sooner if I dared to look Michelle Visage in the eyes.”
She-lock turns around and marches off set, into the backstage area decorated with a large couch, chairs and vanity stations where queens usually fight for a few more seconds of airtime, or learn their lines for the lip-sync. She grabs the largest cocktail off a tray, and paces back and forth. Trying to think. Why can’t she think?
“It’s… massage oil,” John says, dumbfounded.
“If you’re expecting me to welcome you home…”
Special thanks to Wildishmazz (for the inspiration) and my beta 88thparallel (I owe her everything).
are at stake!”
Nope, he prefers getting shot at.
this?” Sherlock says. “I’ve done everything for you. But no. Apparently it wasn’t good enough because you needed strangers to provide you with better furniture, better kitchen material, a better…” His voice breaks, then he recovers. “A better home for Rosie.”
Back in the monitor room, Lestrade nudges John. “That’s our cue, mate. Are you ready?”
She-lock raises her eyebrows. “You’ve… succeeded.”
When they arrive at the hotel, a charming cottage in Bristol, Janine has a long, lively conversation with the reception desk before she returns, face apologetic.
at people.
“Good?” John folds his arms behind his back. “Sherlock. That man's life is in danger. He deserves to know.”
Oh, She-lock ain’t got time for that. “You see, Ru, the only place I slay anyone, is on the runway. Now, arrest Sharon Needles so I can go on lip-syncing for my 10,000 dollar tip.”
. To be invaded. To feel all its length.
John rolls his eyes, and glances at Sherlock. His breath hitches. Sherlock's back is straight as a rod, he has his hands folded in his lap, his face open. He's absorbing every word.
“Well, She-lock does seem to have some mixed emotions about Michelle Visage, even if she has a hard time admitting it,” John says. It’s not a lie. Then why does it feel like a lie? A betrayal?
Sherlock looks at him with questioning eyes. God, he is beautiful. His white shirt is unbuttoned a little too far, exposing his lean neck. His waistcoat fits his shoulders beautifully. His wrists are red from struggling against the ropes. John takes one of Sherlock’s hands, and softly traces the scrapes.
“So how about… Dinner?” John asks, breathing heavily.
funny”, Sebastian says, grabbing Penelope's side quite forcefully. John removes his hand from Sarah's side.
“I’m sorry about last night,” Sherlock blurts as John opens the door.
John chuckles. “I didn’t think you had. But you know about anatomy, don’t you? Just, you know. Don’t accidentally paralyse him and you’re fine.”
“What are you listening to, by the way?”
“Well, obviously”, Sherlock had told her. “It’s the Church of bloody England!”
Sherlock’s warm tongue finds its way back eagerly and licks across the edges of John’s hole.
He feels a royal flush on his cheeks.
. I feel like I’ve been sleeping on a turtle. I need to rest, rest, rest, bitch. Stay tuned!”
“I’m here for a consult, Doctor.”
However, John proves himself a helpful student doctor, taking over most examinations of the day.
Mycroft points his phone at the speakers again.
What else. Oh, John.
“Don’t tell me -
“Before inviting you for tonight's Murder Mystery, I've sent all of you the names of your characters and a short discription. However, in these envelopes I've included a few more details that you're meant to keep to yourself, and that you can use for your character. Including whether you are the killer or not.” He smirks. “Please only open the envelopes after the murder has happened, though.”
When she puffs her chest like she’s Scarlett Johansson or something, Sherlock stiffens.
“What?” John says, scratching his head. He feels like he just got shot in the heart. He should be falling backwards. He looks at Sherlock. He wants to fall forwards, so badly.
struggling against the harness, like a puppet. A mobile phone falls down the building’s front to the pavement. This wakes him from his haze, and Sherlock runs toward the scene.
?” Lestrade asks John, eyeing She-lock as they walk along the corridor.
John rolls his eyes.
“You want me to kick that fancy doctor’s ass?” She asks, defiantly. Then, mumbling dreamily: “Or perhaps that producer’s ass.”
Sherlock stares out the window, hands folded behind his back. They’re on the top floor of the hotel, right across from Disneyland’s entrance. He can see people leaving, smiling. Carrying awful balloons with
‘Hello, Goodbye’ by The Beatles.
John didn’t even know Janine had a copy of his hotel room’s key card, and jumps as she barges in. He’d been sitting on his bed, dumbfounded. Ready to pack.
Right. Not Christmas.
“I’m sure you will,” Ru says, leaning over the work table. “Have you come up with a name for your new sister yet?”
Then, with a shock, She-lock realises that
“It’s not that pretty a dragon, mate,” a man says, passing by whilst pushing a pram.
“Tell that to Bianca Del Rio on the West End, bitch,” Phi Phi says.
Jinkx: “She-lock, girl, you think you’re the new Aquaria but we’re only halfway this season and you’ve already been in the bottom two.”
“How do you feel about international crime? Teammates should know the worst about each other.”
She quickly tightens a corset around her waist, gets into a deeply pink dress, pushes up the collared construction on the top and paints faint diamond droplets around her eyes. Pure opulence.
Suddenly, a voice booms next to them. “Step away from him.”
“What?” Alyssa snaps. “What the hell are you squirpin’ like a chirpin’ like a bird?”
Abruptly, Sherlock pulls back, licking his lips and swallowing. He looks up. Like this is a videogame, and this is a task he has completed. He’s ready to go to the next level.
The elevator pings. It’s the fourth floor. An elderly lady slowly walks inside and stops between them. They stand in painful, deafening silence. On the third floor, the lady gets out. Shuffling her feet excruciatingly slowly. When the elevator doors finally close, and they are between the third and second floor, Sherlock pushes the emergency button. The elevator comes to a halt with a shock.
Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race... The queens read each other to filth. Jinkx won that mini challenge. Now, it's time for the main challenge: a make-over. John Watson and the rest of Scotland Yard are on their way to the 'werk room'...
“Reading is fundamental,” RuPaul tells the gaggle of queens.
, Sherlock thinks.
With an unexpectedly heavy arm, John reaches behind him, touching his neck. He looks at Sherlock’s hand. He’s holding a syringe. Confusedly, John searches Sherlock’s face, pale and speechless. A guilty look. John blinks and blinks, but the haziness won’t disappear.
“According to the producers, Michelle has been especially hard on She-lock’s runway looks,” Anderson continues. “More so than on the others’.”
“Yes, of course”, John replies.
“Now, I managed to sneak Wiggins’ latest notes out before the police could get to them, but they’re mostly useless.”
Quickly, John checks that there aren't too many people around to overhear this odd conversation. Or perhaps that's the point – and there's someone nearby who prompted the question? Someone... attractive?
The reply is swift.
, there are huge grainy pictures of Bainbridge and Jonathan Smalls, taken with a telephoto lens. They’re inside a bedroom at the Landmark. Having... a conversation. In depth.
Sherlock pushes in. Just the tip of it.
“A new threat?” John asks.
There’s some mild cheers from the contestants - and Dimmock - for the two drag queens seated at the high judging panel in front of them. According to Lestrade’s briefing, these two former contestants rose to unstoppable fame partly thanks to All Stars, which was Absolut All Stars’ predecessor show.
“Look, Phi Phi…”
“Hello, Sherlock. Welcome, although I don’t remember inviting you.” Tan raises his eyebrows.
He misses the rest of Mary’s explanations, until Magnussen puts his hand on the small of his back.
She-lock steps closer to him, making John stand upright immediately. “Your limp is psychosomatic,” She-lock whispers tauntingly in his ear.
Why a forensic scientist has to be here, John has no clue. It’s not like the murder has actually happened yet, so there’s no body to examine. But, John guesses they needed more men, and Lestrade must have pressured Anderson to come. Just as he did John.
Behind Antoni, Sherlock pops up, and angrily whispers in his ear. “You think you can come here with your cheekbones and make salad? John doesn’t want your avocado.”
He calls Mycroft.
John stops in his tracks and turns on his heels. Silence falls. Nobody breathes. Sherlock refuses to look up.
“Your parents?”
John giggles. Look at that amazing man organising a funny James Bond case for his birthday. A casino, a chase on a train - classic Bond. Bloody brilliant.
Sherlock pulls John on his lap and throws his scarf on the ground himself, exposing his long, pale neck. Sherlock locks his arms around John, keeping him in place. John hesitates. How intoxicated is Sherlock? He’s not acting like he normally does. But he hasn’t had that many drinks, and he doesn’t seem to slur his words too much.
John starts rubbing his right nipple through the fabric of his shirt.
In the small hours of the night, John was awakened by intense dreams. But for the first time in a very, very long time, the dreams were not full of screams and explosions and terror. Kinesthetic impressions of muscled flesh beneath his hands, soft skin under his fingertips and against his lips, sweat and musk and electric heat, had him waking to gasped breaths and a throbbing erection. He lay in bed, surprised at this turn of events. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had an erotic dream, let alone a wank. He chalked it up to his improved mental state, and took himself in hand. No sense wasting it, after all.
A half-dozen young people, men and women alike uniformed in plaid flannel and artfully torn jeans, disappeared into the copse of trees that were the focus of his and Sherlock’s interest. One androgynous straggler hurried to catch them up, a reusable shopping bag of thin fabric slung over their shoulder. The footage hummed on, the park quieting as the evening crept in, and Bag of Hammers stepped onto the cobbled path, only minutes away from his appointment with death. Sherlock slowed the playback, peering intently at the victim-to-be. Hammers ambled slowly, smoking a cigarette and tossing the butt in a bin after bending to stub it out on the cobbles, before strolling a little further along the path with hands in pockets, utterly unconcerned.
John expected to feel irritated, but instead was washed with relief. He didn’t have to tell Sherlock what his night had been like, the man was reading it off him like letters on a page. No words needed.
John blinked, and his fists relaxed. His lips twitched in a brief smile. “Yeah… yeah. Okay.” He went to fill the kettle. Sherlock jumped to his feet and did a few laps of the room himself while the tea steeped, to settle the frantic thoughts bouncing though his mind. He heard John taking deep, steady breaths in the kitchen, his calming routine the only useful thing that therapist had ever taught him.
“Your Aunt? You’re usually pleased to hear from her. Has she said something unexpectedly offensive?” Sherlock persisted, wanting to know what put that particular combination of expressions on John’s face.
“I suppose that’s true…”
They spent a convivial half hour drinking tea around the table while Rosie played with her food, eventually cramming most of it in her mouth. Amina caught John up on the neighborhood gossip, Rosie’s recent antics, and the results of her latest checkup, which had occurred earlier that week. “An’ she’s up to date on her vaccinations; I’ve got th’ paperwork in her folder when you want to look it over. She landed solid in the 49th percentile for weight and height, so no worries there.” Amina chucked her charge gently on the chin. “That’s our perfectly average wee monster now, innit? Grrr!”
bedroom.
Sherlock merely grunted as he lifted the tea to his mouth, blowing as John had before sipping. His absent hums of appreciation as he scanned the video and drank made John smile.
“The same way our killer might have,” came the reply, “over there.” Sherlock headed for a pipe-and-board scaffolding that had been erected a few columns away so that workers could climb up to higher levels and continue piecing the skeleton of the building together. Careless of his suit and dress shoes, Sherlock swung up to the first muddy board, and reached for the next.
“All right?” John asked. Sherlock huffed and nodded. “Too much, before?”
He snorted at that - all his claims to be ‘not gay’ seemed pretty thin, now. He cringed inside thinking of the looks he would get once people learned of this; he was in for a fair share of the piss, that would be for certain. Some would think him a hypocrite.
John snickered, then heaved himself out of bed and headed for the bathroom. “Don’t stop talking; back in a tick,” he threw over his shoulder. He didn’t close the door all the way, and Sherlock heard him start to relieve himself. He stuttered a little in his recounting, then coughed to cover and resumed.
“The paramedics looked you over, and declared you fine, aside from the drug; a little bruised but nothing major. Said you would sleep it off, and helped me get you up here. You rather indignantly insisted on changing for bed, though you needed… er, help.” Sherlock’s cheeks bloomed pink, and he was glad John had moved on to vigorously scrubbing his teeth and couldn’t see. “The paramedics had left by then, so we got you out of your suit, and into your pajamas. Then you hit the bed like a downed tree and have been out cold entirely until this morning.” He sighed ruefully.
“John, you wouldn’t hurt me -”
“I sort of promised to marry her!” John yelled back defensively.
When he went back to his room, no one was there. He tried not to feel disappointed, but had hoped that he might come across another heartwarming scene like yesterday’s. Seeing reserved, impassive Sherlock so engaged with Rosie was surprisingly satisfying, and he cherished those moments.
Sherlock had watched all this bemusedly, and now observed John’s approach with a sparkle of mirth in his eyes. “How very safety-conscious, doctor,” he stated gravely. “You look smashing in that getup.”
Sherlock nodded, and looked like he wanted to say something; their faces were so close John could see the variations in color in his friend’s irises easily, even in the fading afternoon light. After a moment, the man blinked and pulled back, a little faint color on his cheeks. “I’ll text,” he said shortly, and was gone.
He returned for another, then another, each kiss more heated than the last until they were smearing lips over each other’s faces, sucking at tongues and moaning, fingers clutching at the muscles of each other’s backs. John’s blunt fingers traveled down, tracing Sherlock’s long spine vertebra by vertebra, then scrabbling at the waistband to his trousers. “Sherlock,” John gasped between kisses, sounding desperate, “please, Sherlock, let me see you, let me touch you, please, please.”
Sherlock had said it before as well, with the proper gravitas so important a truth demanded; feelings were not his area, so admitting to such a one as love was something he had to work up to. At the moment however, his chest felt so full that something must be done to relieve the pressure. He took a deep breath. “John,” he rumbled, his voice cracking a bit, “John-”
The critical little voice in his head that had caused so much trouble scoffed at such an optimistic hope, but John told that part of him to sod off. He and Duck had talked about checking his assumptions, that the little voice in his head had been trained by his depression and inertia to feed him unsubstantiated judgment about his actions.
For that matter, Sherlock found having to stop to be rather frustrating, too. His body was certainly interested in the replays; he was thickening in his trousers already. Well, he wouldn’t have to stop anymore, he told himself. John opened the bathroom door at that moment, and Sherlock popped up to catch him in a kiss, open-mouthed and fervent, arms curling tightly around a muscled form. John reeled back a step or two, then gave as good as he’d got; expertly taking control of the kiss and walking Sherlock backward toward the bed until the backs of his knees hit the mattress and he folded to sitting. He looked up at John, vexed, and blew a wayward curl off his forehead.
. Not… together-together, just being in the same place. Like flatmates who are friends. Sherlock rolled his mental eyes at himself. Truly, this sentiment business was worse for brain work than the smoking bans. Did he have any patches around?
“John, please,” Sherlock said, and that tight note was back in the deep baritone, a crack in the smooth velvet sound that revealed profound concern.
“That’s true. I suppose you could have her genetics tested, if you’re really concerned.” Duck seemed to think it a small thing, if his offhand tone was anything to go by.
seen John miss a step in a performance.
After a moment, he heaved a breath and pulled some jeans and a soft, long-sleeved Tshirt out of his dresser, hurriedly putting them on and going to join Sherlock in the sitting room.
The weight room and locker area were deserted when John got there, and he briskly stripped off and rubbed himself down with a towel to remove the worst of his workout sweat while the sauna heated. He chose a modest 72 degrees C, not wanting to cook too much, but knowing he had a higher tolerance for heat than some after his time in Afghanistan. He grabbed two bottles of water from the fridge near the door (another perk of this posh facility) and stepped into the small, dim room, towels clutched in a bundle over his nudity.
Sherlock’s thoughtfulness had made John’s throat tighten a little when he arrived back in his room, but when Sherlock approached for a now-customary hug, John froze with panicked certainty that his inconvenient feelings would somehow communicate themselves through touch. Instead he had thanked his friend somewhat stiffly and hurriedly stepped into the loo to change and splash a little water on his face, shutting Sherlock and the confused frown on his lean face on the other side of the door.
Sherlock surprised him by capturing his hand firmly in his enormous grasp, long fingers engulfing almost the entirety of John’s smaller palm and sturdy fingers. Scintillating eyes searched his face for a quiet minute, while brows drew down in concentration. The usually eloquent genius seemed to struggle for words. “John,” he said seriously. “I know you don’t want to talk about it, but we must discuss what Dr Harrington said to you yesterday.”
), in the widening of his eyes, in the licking of his lips as he regarded Sherlock. “May I…” he said, gesturing to Sherlock’s body; Sherlock nodded, beyond ready to experience John’s touch in this way.
~~oOo~~
“It’s…” John huffed. “Well, it’s…” he crossed his arms, then uncrossed them, then wiped his hands across his face again. “You see it’s… well, you remember Marjorie?”
But, I think now, if I had done it... you know... actually died? I think that would have been the worst thing I could possibly have done to him. I’d have taken away the one person he’s been able to find that kind of connection with in the whole world. I’d have robbed him of the one chance he’s ever found of understanding what it’s like to care for someone, and have them care for you.”
John scrubbed a hand through his hair to give himself a moment. “I guess, seeing him get taken down like that. I was thinking,” he looked at his foot as it scuffed a little mark into the horrible brown industrial carpet under his shoes, “how Hammers wasn’t expecting anything when he died. He was just having a nice little stroll in a downtown park, enjoying himself, looked like. Then he was dead. Just like that, yeah?” He peered up from under his brows, then back at the floor. “You - it can all be gone, just like that.” He trailed off and scuffed the floor again. Silence fell, palpable in the dim video booth.
“…promised me, John! You said we’d be together when I was forty, and now I am, and now we. Will. Be. Together!” She interspersed her words with heaves of effort, trying to pull John along toward the last line of parked cars in the lot.
~~oOo~~
Thursday rolled around, and they still hadn’t made the attempt. Hadn’t even hugged fully. Hadn’t found out if they (if Sherlock) could cope with so much physical contact. They were slated to travel on the eight o’clock train that evening, so he stiffened his resolve and faced up to the problem.
“Rosie, then, Sherlock?” John knew his expression must be transparent to the most perceptive man he’d ever known;
“I couldn’t tell you, mate, we haven’t been watching the hallway. But naw, that’s my buddy Trevor’s room. She’s that uptight bitch in the room next to his, right? She called security on us last night because we was too loud, she says. It’s a bloody wedding party, o’course it’s loud!” the inebriated informant’s voice raised indignantly.
"Let's get this over with." Sherlock stepped over the arm of his chair and dropped sulkily into the seat, ignoring John's raised eyebrows. "You are obviously angling to have me try one of your 'relaxation techniques,'" he sneered, "so just get on with it. What's my mantra, 'Vatican cameos?' No, that will make us tense. 'The silence of the mountain enfolds me?' No? 'I'm a little teapot?'"
In the darkness of his the quiet room, the image that had caused all tonight’s trouble seemed seared on the inside of his eyelids. John slowed his breathing and did his level best to concentrate on something - anything - else, but it was like being back in his psychology lecture in uni, talking about ironic process theory and being told not to think of a pink elephant. Eventually the only thing he could think about was that image, and how it had made him feel. With a groan, he turned onto his side in the bed and just gave into it; picturing the photo, and moving on to other times he had ignored - repressed, Duck would likely say - flashes of appreciation for his friend’s aesthetic impact. There were… a lot. Really, a surprising amount, for someone who up to a few hours ago had been convinced he had no interest in men whatsoever. The burnished mahogany curls; the lean body, tall and imposing one moment, and limp and languid the next; that bloody swanlike neck; the plush Cupid’s-bow lips; and the eyes - those indescribable eyes: tilted, feline, flashing with color like an opal as a result of changes in the light or their owner’s mood.
“A pleasure,” Sherlock said.
~~oOo~~
Sherlock offered John a cup of water with a straw without asking, and when John was done sipping, he took John’s limp hand again, clasping it more firmly. “Rest now, John. Amina has young Watson in hand, and I will be here when you wake up.”
The woman spluttered her outrage for a minute or so, then muttered something that sounded suspiciously like “looks like the wrong one is the patient,” and stomped out of the room, pink tablet clutched to a pink bosom, fingers white with the tightness of her grip.
“Like this?” he asked calmly, grasping the front-most two ropes and with some contorting of his arms, clipping them into the big steel ring on his back, then jerking the other ends to ensure they were properly secured to the beam. “I’m not certified, but I’ve used gear like this before,” he assured the fuming foreman. “I’ll just bring a harness over to my friend there, and get him clipped in, and we’ll be done before you know it.”
Sherlock’s whole body shivered and he moaned, high-pitched and heartfelt in the silence of the room. Startled, John again dropped back down on his heels to catch his breath. Sherlock wrapped himself around John, hiding his face on top of John’s head as he recovered himself, his lean chest working like a bellows with his suppressed emotion.
“What the hell, Sherlock?” he snapped, eyes flashing. Sherlock stepped back a pace, fingertips to his scar, unaccountably hurt. He scowled.
“Do you hear me? Don’t give me that blank stare, Holmes, you know you could get me out of here if you wanted to. So, I’m what - too broken to let out? Too unstable? If that’s how you felt all along you might as well have not tried so hard to drag me here in the first place! I’d not be a problem then...” John’s ire drained away over the course of his rant and he sank back against the pillow, despair enveloping him. He squeezed his eyes shut against the tears that threatened
“No, you missed it. Let me,” his friend said.  His big hands spidered across John’s scalp, making the short hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He shivered as Sherlock stepped back, a bit of green something pinched in his fingers. He dropped it in the bin.
John squirmed in his chair. Thinking about being back home, playing with Rosie, going on cases with Sherlock, even just talking to Amina or Mrs Hudson, filled him with uncomfortable shame.
Sherlock detoured to the kitchen to collect the second cup of tea considerately left there for him, and settled in his own chair. When John glanced up, he nodded in thanks, indicating the drink. John smiled and went back to his hammering. Sherlock sipped delicately. Perfect.
Sherlock’s mind was whirling faster than the dancers on the floor. He looked at John; really
“Sherlock...”
He had tried to kill himself, and failed. Sherlock had thwarted him. Saved him.
“Know what, John?” Sherlock said quietly, his voice emerging deep and velvety.
Sherlock blew out a breath as Lady Grey slipped from his view. Seeing her moving so sensually and the peekaboo nature of her garments had the craving in his belly flaring almost to the point of discomfort; had he ever wanted someone the way he wanted John? The Lady was beautiful and alluring, but it was the man who brought her to life, who breathed fire into her from the inside; that was who made his groin tighten and his breathing pick up. He wanted to find someplace immediately where they could be alone to peel John out of his garters and heels and worship him for hours - no, for days; until they passed out from bliss. He crossed his legs the other way over, hoping his burgeoning erection was not too noticeable.
Sherlock in, by obliging him to ask favors from his brother, the man who hoarded them like treasure and called them in for reasons clear only to himself. John cringed a little inside at the thought.
John turned his head and caught Sherlock’s eye, who was watching the play of emotions on John’s face with a frown. “You’re not eating?” He said carefully, indicating John’s carton with his spoon. “It will get cold.”
“Are those my discharge papers, Duck?” He stepped up beside Sherlock as he interjected, tugging the man’s sleeve in a subtle
When the door shut behind her, Sherlock and Rosie settled back into the chair by the bedside, where he produced a set of plastic keys on a ring from a pocket to entertain the girl. She was happy to manipulate them and mouth at them while Sherlock and John regarded each other in silence.
Continued thanks for those reading along as this is posted; your encouragement has kept me writing despite a very busy time in RL. I hope this continues to satisfy! Updates will be erratic but as often as I can make them. :)
Holding hands in a cab, kisses goodbye and hello, complaining about having to get reading glasses? Growing old?
“I’m… Christ, I’m…Sher-”
They lingered over coffee and dessert. John flirtatiously demanded that Sherlock try a bite of the rich crème brûlée, right from his spoon. He closed his eyes as it melted on his tongue to the sound of John’s giggle, and Sherlock took time to fix this moment in his mind palace. He felt… happy. He slipped his hand onto John’s knee, and added the gasp of indrawn breath to the moment he was recording.
~~oOo~~
During this time, John began to exhibit a new pattern of behavior toward his laptop. Sherlock, who missed little when it came to John, hadn’t put the pieces together until they had finished with Lestrade, though the symptoms had been scattered through those weeks. It started small, just an irritated huff or a tightening of the lips when he would open up the screen, or an unusually firm closing of the cover when finishing up. These little tics intensified as John and Sherlock resumed the routines of their life – John opening the laptop, looking at it for only a moment or two, then clacking it closed again; occasionally looking at it like it might bite him, whether it was on or not; clearly having to make himself get on it and hammer away. He also stopped leaving it around the common spaces of the flat as often, bringing it up to his room with him or even taking it to work a few times. It puzzled Sherlock; he observed these little oddities in his usually composed friend and turned them over in his mind like one might run a worry stone through their fingers. He found dwelling on John, any facet of John, soothing and absorbing.
,” she said, still not addressing or even looking at Sherlock. She said ‘gay’ like it was a synonym for ‘unclean.’ Sherlock suddenly felt offended on John’s behalf – and his own, for that matter. He drew breath to respond scathingly, but John beat him to it.
Sherlock nodded emphatically. “If I finish before it’s time to pick up young Watson, I’ll come by again.” With that, he was out the door, polished shoes tapping on the hallway tiles.
The day after John's confession, Sherlock emerged from his mind palace after hours of silence. He had been mulling over the emails he had read between Marjorie and John after breaking into John’s laptop while he was out walking. Marjorie was obviously fixated on John, likely as a way to cope with her loss. John just as clearly was trying to be kind, but in no way encouraged her. John's idea had merit; appearing to be in a gay relationship would take John about as far off the market as it was possible to be.
Duck let out a long, sighing breath as they held the pose, then casually asked, “so, how was your last night here?”
“Tedious,” his friend retorted, “Lestrade called. He said the suspect is recovering well, but they need us to clarify the evidence for Anderson’s people so that once he’s out of hospital they’ll have a case to prosecute. Are you coming?”
John blew out a long-suffering sigh and told his thoughts to behave.
Sherlock decided he would take his shirt off, and began with the buttons. He looked up at an unexpected sound from John – a sort of growling hum. He raised an eyebrow in question.
John fit him perfectly, Sherlock couldn’t help but think. He was shorter, but that meant Sherlock could rest his chin on top of John’s head. His arms reached most of the way around John’s shoulders, and when he spread his hands on John’s back, he could feel the muscles along John’s spine adjusting to support the new position. He could feel John’s hands doing the same, splaying from under one arm up over his shoulder and the other over his spine. They both were still rather wooden, and there was a bit of space between them, so nothing was pressing into… anything, thank God. But John’s body was firm, and his warmth came through almost immediately, everywhere they were touching. John’s hair smelled like rosemary shampoo.
Sherlock had stalked to the door and shut it pointedly on the woman’s pink-shod heels. Then he whirled and groaned in a theatrical way, returning to John’s bedside and slumping in the guest chair pulled up close. He rolled his head against the chair back until it pointed in John’s direction. “I’m having second thoughts about this place after meeting that... person,” he complained. “Perhaps Mycroft is having his little joke, putting you here where the staff has been so carefully vetted by his people. It would be like him to instruct them to vex me incessantly.” Sherlock’s face settled into a petulant frown as he contemplated his brother’s possible culpability in the pink nurse’s irritating presence.
The woman snorted inelegantly. “Not even close, but it was no trouble - well, not too much anyway.”
Until Sherlock’s head popped up, and his entire body tensed; he lunged for the trackball, leaving John again alone and chilled, though faintly relieved that there wouldn’t have to be more emotional awkwardness for the moment.
“Sort of. Not really. But not… calm, either.”
John thought.
In the spring of John’s first year at St. Bart’s medical school, Aunt Brigid called to let him know she and Tim were getting married that summer. John was genuinely pleased for them; in his opinion, Mr. Penton was good for Aunt Brigid, and Aunt Brigid was good for Tim and his kids, especially Stephen.  Marjorie had outgrown her goth phase and matured into an intelligent, self-possessed young woman who was well on her way to a doctorate in Chemistry and a career in pharmaceutical research. Stephen had struggled to find his way in school, timid and accident-prone in his teens. In recent years, he had come out of his shell somewhat and was looking forward to Uni avidly. John privately thought some time out of his sister’s shadow had done him a world of good.
Sherlock jerked out of his reverie when the stagehand that had given Lady Grey her flowers snapped his fingers near Sherlock’s ear, holding out a note. “From the Lady, innit?” he said cheekily and clapped Sherlock on the shoulder. “Cor, but you’re a lucky man, Mister ‘Olmes.” Grinning widely, the stagehand briskly headed backstage as the house lights came up for intermission.
John shook off the momentary distraction
When his mobile went off a half hour later, a gleeful Sherlock declared a case was on, and he was off out to tackle it immediately. When John said he’d stay with Rosie and Amina, he received a disbelieving stare; at Amina’s snort it transfered to her with a narrow-eyed consideration. “Well, be dull if you must, far be it for me to stand in the way.” He whirled and headed for the door, his brusque “I’ll text!” echoing back just before the sound of the door closing.
He put down his supper half-finished, appetite draining away. He’d have to be careful, that’s all. Be sure. Be certain before he acted. That’s all.
Duck looked as though he would ask more questions, then caught the look on John’s face and reined himself in. They loped along, neither speaking.
When it was finished, John stood and bounced on his toes a few times. “God, that’s much better! I was worried I would end up really sore tomorrow. I mean, yeah, give me something else to focus on besides my problems, but I’m not so into pain as all that.” He plopped back down on the bed and snagged Sherlock’s hand to squeeze it. “Thanks.”
“Anytime someone’s killed, everyone looks for the big, scary bloke with the scar across one cheek,” John cut in. “Well, unless they’re you, they do. But sometimes you need someone ordinary, someone people would overlook.”
Lady Grey nonchalantly walked around from behind the platform in yet another costume change, this time into a deep red cocktail dress covered with glittering silver beadwork on the form-fitting bodice and tight sleeves, paired with a full, drapey, asymmetrical-line skirt of some diaphanous stuff that swung and flared with each step she took. On her feet were a pair of criss-crossing, thin-strapped, spike-heeled, peep-toe, rhinestone-encrusted platform sandals. The shoes were stunning, the outfit was stunning; Sherlock couldn’t look anywhere but at Lady Grey in her element. He hurriedly sat on his hands when he noticed he had been pressing the heel of his palm hard against his erection.
“Charmed, I’m sure. But I’m not dead, I was undercover,” Sherlock drawled. “And you’re the one whose husband was dead just recently, I believe? I’m sorry for your loss, though you don’t seem too put out by it.” He made a conscious decision to go on the offensive right off, so he shook her hand with a deliberately limp grip and dialed up the posh gay in his tone; it went better with the catty remarks he intended to make.
John stared straight ahead as they emerged from the lift on Lestrade’s floor and strode through the scattering of desks in the bullpen. He resolutely did not acknowledge the heads turning in his direction, preferring to keep his eyes on his goal and avoid catching the looks of pity and derision he was sure he’d see on the faces he passed. Sherlock had already arrived in the fishbowl of Lestrade’s office, and was dropping the shades while throwing unfriendly glares at the more persistent gawkers.
Duck grinned as he strode along, his gait somewhat more bouncy on the hook leg. “Thought you might have a few, being a doctor and all. Have you seen much of amputees before?”
Lestrade looked down and away for a moment, then seemed to steel himself. “Sherlock, can you give us a moment, please?”
John’s brow furrowed as he tried to process this totally unexpected occurrence. His eyes opened, and he peered up into Sherlock’s face. His carefully impassive face, wiped clear of any indication that he might have just bestowed anything so ridiculous as a peck on the forehead to anyone, ever. John knew Sherlock well enough to tell when he was covering, and he looked for any tiny indication of what might be going through his friend’s hyperactive brain. And then he looked for any sign that Sherlock wanted to step back and end the moment. And then, he just looked.
John pursed his lips and frowned. A stone a little smaller than a ping-pong ball, shot at a force to cave in a man’s forehead bone, would need a pretty strong slingshot. He squinted at the photo again, wondering about the damaged bark, but his eye caught at the expanse of almost translucent skin highlighted by the merciless flash. Sherlock had a scattering of moles on his neck, John noted, that caught the eye in the harsh light. Had he never noticed them before? How odd.
She wished John luck and continued improvement, and he wished her luck with impending motherhood. Both of them laughed at the way Rosie’s tiny fingers got caught in Dr Harrington’s necklace as she indulged in one more cuddle; even Sherlock flashed his fleeting smile at the charming picture.
John was always the caretaker, the strong one, the provider of comfort, by profession or by circumstance. Either that, or he was manfully refusing comfort when things got hard because he thought he shouldn’t need it. So this hug felt new, and actually quite lovely. Relief was not a true enough descriptor for the light, released feeling inside him at this moment. He could stay like this forever.
“Oh,” John said warily. His brows drew down. “What’s that, then?”
Which is when the wedding party arrived: including Stephen, his bride (Suzette? Susan? Shirley? Unimportant, anyway) Aunt Brigid and Uncle Tim… and Marjorie. They couldn’t leave now, with such a perfect opportunity to introduce the ruse to the reason it existed in the first place. A cold voice in his mind, unaffected by the turmoil in his body and thoughts, suggested that he likely looked somewhat rumpled, and John looked deliciously mussed himself. It would not take a genius to guess they had been, er -  canoodling; all the better to lend verisimilitude to their story.
“John?” The hoarse rasp of his name snapped him rudely out of his reverie. Duck smirked at him from the chair, his glass cradled in both hands on his lap. “Where’d you go this time? You were smiling.”
With a sense of resigned sorrow, he took her and laid her against his chest. How could he refuse with her right there? Asking for him? The small body was unexpectedly solid; she looked so frail, he was always surprised at how firm her tiny form actually was. The weight of it on him felt grounding; he could hear his heart rate slowing on the monitor. Words tumbled from him, reflexively. “Hallo, lovey, how have you been? Making messes for Amina to clean up?”
Duck let the silence stretch between himself and John until John began to feel a little uncomfortable. Abruptly Duck grinned and held out his hand. “John, I think you and I are gonna get along just fine. I’ll help you all I can, and your Sherlock, and Rosie, is it? Will get you back in one piece as soon as we can manage to find a big enough shovel, alright? I’ve got a good feeling about you.” He grinned as John shook his hand firmly, wiping his eyes one last time and nodding his head.
John wearily tipped a dash of milk into his tea, took a sip (too hot!) and scooped another tiny spoonful of the colorless rice cereal out of the bowl, offering it to Rosie. She clamped her rosebud mouth firmly shut and, looking at John all the while, evaded all his attempts to feed her the smooth pap.
Something in Sherlock’s words, as they replayed in his head, felt familiar in a way that made him simultaneously terrified and angry. He cuffed his eyes again, taking deep breaths to regain control of himself, mortified at his tears.
"Why not?"
– and softly, gently, pressed his lips to John’s. His eyes fluttered shut. The kiss was short but lingering, and he felt John’s lips spread into a smile under his own. As he pulled back, John’s lopsided smile came into focus, bright and pleased. John was a better actor than Sherlock had given him credit for, if this was him shamming a boyfriend reaction. As it was, he had no idea what expression was on his own face; he was breathless with his own daring and the pounding of his pulse.
"Just!" John got hold of himself. "Just," he continued more calmly, "compose yourself. Um, do whatever it is you do when you go to your mind palace, only wait at the door, don't go in." It was Sherlock's turn to raise a sarcastic eyebrow. John plowed on. "Now, wait there a moment. Be still. The version of this that worked best for me was to focus on physical sensations." He leaned forward and spoke more slowly, more softly. "Pay attention to your body resting on the chair. To your feet resting on the floor. What does that feel like? As you breathe, feel your rib cage expand and relax. What does that feel like? Pay attention to those sensations."
Sherlock didn’t get around to poking in John’s email until a few weeks after the ‘Vacuum-Packed Adventure’ as John insisted calling the case on his blog. There had been little in the way of diverting cases after that case wrapped up, (‘Ha!’ said John’s voice, ‘good one!’) but Sherlock had had a few email puzzles that occupied him and two new experiments on what happens to flesh when abruptly exposed to unusually low pressure. Gruesome, but very informative. He’d had to go to Bart’s morgue for the second experiment; he was right in thinking it would need a space with a drain in the floor. John had asked where he was going, thought for a moment, then calmly wished him luck and suggested he wear the protective suit for once. Good advice, when it came to it. It would have taken ages to get the bits out of his hair after the second trial reacted more vigorously than he had anticipated.
“At the very least, it will help you understand your reactions, John. Maybe nothing will come of it, other than you’ll know something new about yourself. Maybe you’ll recognize where some of the impulses that have worried you before are coming from. That can only be a good thing, right?” Duck leaned back in his chair, and laced his fingers together in front of his bristly chin. “And,” he said carefully, from behind the shelter of his hands, “perhaps you’ll see some new things about this person,” he raised a wry eyebrow, “that will surprise you.”
Suddenly Sherlock became aware of fingers snapping in front of his nose. “Sherlock, hey, Sherlock? C’mon now, this is more scary than the best friend thing, really. Come back, now. Hey, Sherlock?” He blinked one more time and the mildly concerned and mostly amused face of John Watson swam back into view, much closer than when he had last seen it. John was half knelt in front of Sherlock’s chair, leaning in, hand resting warmly on Sherlock’s knee for balance. It was as if all bodily awareness in Sherlock’s mind narrowed down to that point, John’s hand on his knee.
This time, no shrill ringing broke the moment, and neither man seemed inclined to step back with any sort of haste. For John’s part, he concentrated on the sensations of being comforted and held, of letting someone else take his burden for a bit. He could easily get used to having this feeling in his life more often; he suspected he’d come to crave it if he wasn’t careful.
when it wasn’t acting for a case, fitted within normal parameters for Sherlock. Which in turn was quite the strong indicator that he was genuinely back behind the wheel in his own body.
Well, that was the million-pound question, wasn’t it?
“And now you’re repeating yourself, so you’ve probably got concussion or something. Shit.”
Though he could feel the claws on the bony fingers as they circled and tightened around his ankle, it was only around the one, which left his other foot free. It wasn’t the best or safest way to do it, but he estimated that he’d have about enough leverage, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to allow the dragon to just pull him back in like it pleased.
“Hm?”
Sherlock blinked, not liking the direction his thoughts were taking and attempting to wrest back control of them.
His expression then softened. “Nor need you worry that I lose myself,” he said.
Her ‘mother’ hastened to assure her that she had done really well, and that she was proud of her. The female Alpha even smiled, though she couldn’t quite hide her pain.
Which didn’t seem to include much that he could actually make a meal out of. He sniffed the open milk gingerly, but it smelled alright, so there was that. The best-before date on the few eggs in there looked alright, too. The meat he’d bought some time ago had been lying next to who knew what of Sherlock’s and had an unpleasant shine to it.
The nervousness was certainly evident in his expression, including the eyes, but nevertheless, he didn’t move or look away.
Or maybe it was something else. The doctor didn’t know and couldn’t say.
“Nngh…!” Was all that he got, the breathing still too shallow and too fast. It was slowing, though.
“As for your other questions…to have the bones of another dragon, in whatever form they are, get past your scales and into your blood will act, well…yes, quite like an infection does to humans. Except the root cause is much more…fundamental.”
He couldn’t abandon that duty, either.
“I...eh, yes.”
John blinked.
Btw, I know John isn't handling that whole exchange quite right and that was...rather the point. Just to say, I know :)
“That’s not worry on your part, that’s Mummy being worried and sending you out to locate me and haul me back and you not daring to contradict her.”
Despite her reassurances, he decided to alter the plan somewhat so that he wouldn’t have to rely on what she made. Or rather, he made an alternative plan.
, did I? Barely even implied that I will, if you – “
He sat up, somehow managing to squeeze himself into a seat beside the blond, pale eyes fixed on blue, imploringly. “John, that wasn’t…I didn’t…I don’t want to go back there. Back to where and what I was, without you. But it’s…” He trailed off.
This was just about the worst.
The unbidden thought of Moriarty pushing along a shopping trolley was somewhat amusing. At least, until it morphed into that of the dark-haired Irishman pushing a pram or a pushchair along instead, with a child inside. A blue-eyed, blond child in a lovely little dress.
“It’s John, not Sherlock, and whatever you think you’re going to reprimand him for, save it. I need your help and I need it urgently, without any Holmesian horse-hockey bullshit taking up time.”
“Oh, so that’s how it is, is it?” he said, trying to play it off as a bit of a joke instead. “All this time, all you were interested in was me beard!”
“It’s something. Thank you, John.” The ‘thank you’ was delivered unexpectedly earnestly and quiet.
That wasn’t to say it had been the chore that the expression ‘made the effort’ often implied. Quite the opposite but that was beside the point right now.
For once silently thankful for the number of seemingly useless things that had accumulated in the flat even while he’d been there, a pair of tailor’s scissors chief among them, John moved so the opened cutters were kissing the expensive woollen fabric as well as some of the lining.
“I…does it work for twins?” It felt silly the moment he voiced the thought and he almost grimaced.
“Yeah, okay. I…yeah, I do. No point in trying to hide it any longer, I suppose, with you so close and all.”
The first was the hand Sherlock held, where she leaned in and inhaled, first a small sniff and then a deeper inhalation, snuffling just a little bit as she did so.
“It was to you, which makes it valid on its own, even in this situation. No, also in this situation, that is,” he amended then paused for just a second. “Then there’s the fact that if you’re feeling jealous, which I’d hazard that outburst stemmed from, then we need to address that first before we proceed with this.”
He walked on for a bit, marched, really, in a direction that was most definitely not towards Baker Street. Quite a long bit, actually, long enough that he had not just made it to the end of the rather lengthy road he’d been on but had also turned a corner, crossed a road and walked down that for a bit before he stopped again.
He therefore shifted from foot to foot, on guard despite himself while he waited for the other to finish…wherever his thoughts had run off to, which, quite frankly, could be a lot of places, many of them all at once.
“Precisely.”
“Right. Sorry.” Saying ‘please’ twice in fairly quick succession rather drove the point home. There was a drawn out pause between them. “Can you tell me the rest of it? Why did – you didn’t claim the person you were trying to have sex with back then, did you?” A thought occurred to him. “That’s not…fuck, that’s not the skull, is it?”
It was comforting because it meant that he…well, that he was allowing himself those nerves, if that made any sense. Even though he was trying to keep on top of them, keep in control by suppressing them, as evidenced by the tenseness of his body, it was only some tenseness rather than a strong one, which the brunet would have expected if it were bad. Or, rather, if he was trying not just to curb it but to eliminate it.
“There’s only four of you in the sixth form, one’s on holiday and another’s doing a solo act. Besides, I think you’ll like him.”
“Hey, now,” John said, voice gentle now, the anger gone. Something deeper was amiss. He brought a hand up to brush his fingers against a cheekbone. “What’s all this about all of a sudden?”
He’d confronted them. Acknowledged them, rather, and then considered whether and why he felt as he did. It might not have been in so many words nor consciously, as evidenced at least somewhat by the way the statue had behaved, but nevertheless…
John grimaced a little as he remembered. They’d been face to face with Moriarty at the time and Moriarty had been the one to out the fact that John was indeed pregnant. Given that –
He watched as the blond swallowed but nodded. “He’s waiting for us, isn’t he? Wherever they’ve gone, they’re waiting for us to reach them.”
The hand around his wrist was still as tight as ever, despite the limp and unresponsive body, which only added to the confusion. Why could he do that? Why was he doing it? Why grab John’s and not Mycroft, who’d been equally close at the time and was, after all, his brother? Surely, in such a case, even for dragons, familial connections ought to matter more.
Now wasn’t the time for such thoughts, though. It certainly wasn’t the time for talking through this, either. Not with Tessa right here in his arms. She might be asleep, and she might not. On the chance that she could hear them, they needed to be mindful so as not make things worse.
As he took in the tableau, Sherlock also kept an eye, both metaphorical and not, on John.
“Could hardly gut him in the middle of a crowded street, could I?”
the baritone voice chimed in his head.
A realisation hit him, then, and hit him rather hard. He tried not to let it show, though, as he tugged at the hand of his Omega, first so he could plant a kiss at his temple and then lead him out of the room for some breakfast.
John getting angry wasn’t necessarily a problem on its own. His temper was a known quantity, even if that didn’t mean it was something you could toy with or wouldn’t burn you if you weren’t careful. The point was that the precedent gave some avenues of tried and true responses to said anger.
He had no idea where those words had come from or why they hadn’t been deleted when he’d heard them, but he couldn’t deny their relevance in the circumstances.
“Need you here, you idiot,” the voice was a little hoarser than normal, “not somewhere over there, watching things.”
After all, that was his job, wasn’t it? Looking after Sherlock Holmes and making sure he was alright, whatever that might take? That hadn’t really changed just because he happened to have discovered the bugger was more impossible than he could have ever guessed, had it?
Though it was an issue that he needed to keep mental track of.
It wasn’t long after that that John started asking about the papers on Ruby. Sherlock produced them without fuss and admitted that he had only gone over them the once, while they’d been in the cab home.
“John, please. I didn’t mean – it’s not that I – “
Still feels like we went through a lot, here, but that may just be me.
“And you have?”
“Shown me that I have made the right decision. That I am making the right decision and that it will be the permanent solution.”
John Watson was the exception to a lot of rules, it seemed.
Sebastian Moran was his name, according to Mycroft. A former colonel in the army who had been dishonourably discharged because of his behaviour in a battlefield. The details got a little sketchy at that, but as this was Mycroft, he had managed to find out that Moran had had a bit of a side-line business of shooting rivals of the people who came to him for help dealing with them.
Right. If it could manage that, without much other input from him than having to keep a constant hold of the rope, then…well, surely, even if they were expecting it…it might not be a hundred percent effective but was he really going to allow that to stop him?
Another part, a far more practical part, knew that at least getting out of this whole commitment wasn’t going to happen, if for no other reason than he believed Mr. Duffy would make good on his threat. To have broken his promise to stop smoking wouldn’t make his parents amenable to pay for university, never mind sending him there a year early, and Mycroft, the cake-addict bastard, would make sure they didn’t renege on it, no matter what Sherlock did.
Did he consider it a failure on Sherlock’s part that he’d gone out for food and that Alpha thug had used the window to drop in to try to mess with John on a psychological level, something which he’d succeeded with to an extent, even if the blond didn’t let him see?
But no; at a closer glance, it was more than clear that this was something different. The face was at the same time far more alive and yet more relaxed than it had been at any point during…that time. It looked healthier, too, somehow, though that might be John’s wishful thinking because of the state Sherlock had been in when he’d pushed him into bed.
Without those limitations, some of them could give a dragon a run for its money.
