“He can bill me too,” Tony said. And he meant it. Hell, he’d make Steve his own Iron Man suit. He’d make the man a
Tony wanted to be proud that Pepper adjusted so quickly to a potential threat- didn’t miss a beat! Unfortunately that pride found itself overshadowed by unyielding rage. “You know, about that- it’s real easy to keep a low profile when you get tossed out like trash after having what I’m convinced was a magic stroke! But enough about me and my garbage friends, how are you ?”
They’d left him, Tony realized. He’d passed out on the kitchen floor, and they had left him. He was dying and they left him and he was alone. “
Instead, he moped on the bed and watched the flickering lights of his HUD. Heart rate too low, water consumption too low, food consumption too low, organs beginning to suffer- he scoffed and turned to lay on his side. Of course the readings followed him. Each one reached out like a sharp accusation. You’re dying, you’re
Happy sighed, nodding. “Sure, sure, fair enough point. Guess I just forget about, uh, all that, sometimes.”
If Pepper was surprised to see the ‘Secret Avengers,’ she didn’t let on. Much, anyway. Tony could see, even from the back of the line, how pleased she was to see Steve and Natasha again. Oh yeah.
Tony knew the second Steve was awake, even if the soldier feigned sleep as he no doubt tried to figure out where he was. Steve stayed still for a long time- six minutes and forty-two seconds, to be exact- before he finally took a deep breath and opened his eyes. If he was surprised to see Tony there, he didn’t show it. Steve looked over at Natasha, gaze softening.
“Fine.” Happy jabbed the button for Tony’s floor. No music played as they ascended- none of the avengers were particularly fond of elevator jazz. The two grown men avoided eye contact- or rather, Happy turned his body away from Tony, and Tony looked as far up and to the right as he could manage.
“What? Then what happened to Nat? Or was it Steve?” Tony felt sick all over again. Had the suit malfunctioned? Could it have fallen apart, or
“Well I’m filling in the blanks for all the parts I was unconscious for, but that about sums it up, yeah. Why? Got anything you’d like to add?”
Okay, so I had to do some reworking of the story, but better now than later, right? I think this was a better direction to take everyone in, though, and I hope you all agree!
“It’s just- do you really think it’d be a good look, having one of your suits carry you into the hospital? The hospital you’re already admitted to?”
, you’re DYING- but he felt fine. It was when he thought about taking the suit off that he felt… less than fine.
Recalescent light blinded Tony. The white pain exploded like a balloon full of ink, and Tony found himself painted head to toe in suffering. Something screeched in his ear, grating like nails and glass and knives
Tony wanted to give that look back. Instead he forced a chuckle. “And get on Nat’s bad side? Come on Cap, I do have
Tony grunted at the way the concrete floor rubbed his skin. The suit’s… skin? He rolled his eyes. It was a pleasant surprise, learning he could still do that, even without traditional eyes- you though, the fleshy, wet kind. “It’s three in the morning, leave him alone.”
If Tony didn’t know better, he would have said the AI sounded relieved. Oh, who was he kidding?  Jarvis probably would have wiped his brow with a kerchief and a sheepish smile, if he’d had a brow or lips, or sheepish-ness.
Oh that was rich. Of course the great Captain America would see Tony’s desire for alone time as evidence that he was some damaged little boy who needed an adult to make things better. If he could have, Tony would have rolled his eyes.
Good news? He only destroyed one floor. Bad news? He landed on the marble topped island in the kitchen. The marble top that would now need replacing.
Tony looked back to Steve. Steve’s eyes were so grey now. They’d lost that intense blue that Tony knew and… admired. Tony looked into Steve’s eyes, and past his own masked reflection he saw ninety years of hurt and loss and exhaustion. Well, thirty years and some change.
“Boss, I think clothes are the least of your concerns right now.” Grunting, Happy tugged at Tony’s shoulder, barely managing to roll him over.
“Are you sure? Because for being a genius, the last few decisions you’ve made have been pretty stupid,” Happy snapped. Tony glared at him. As an afterthought, Happy added, “sir.”
“Jarvis!” Something in Tony’s chest burst. Relief flooded him like thick tar, coming so quick it almost hurt. He stopped trying to move. “Jarvis, something’s wrong. Where are the others?”
And there was Steve. Maybe he should have gotten angry, or feel anything other than worry. Maybe Tony’s heart should have tightened, or skipped a beat, or quickened, or
He shook his head pulled away. Reality righted itself once more- but that only meant he could see that Steve had joined the party. Ugh, what, did he slide down the whole in the floor? Real classy.
Tony wished he could soothe that hurt away- and shook his head again, as if he could shake away his feelings. “I’ll tell them the truth. That it’s none of their damn business.”
Someone said his name. Tony ignored them. His HUD flashed with several warnings. Tony ignored those too. He focused on wiggling his hand through that invisible sludge, using the other hand to push on his elbow for leverage. The closer his hand got to the arc reactor, the more Tony’s entire being vibrated with dizzying force. It was like wanting to puke without being nauseous. So close- he was almost there.
“Then tell them to stop worrying, I’m fine. In fact, I’m better than fine, I’m positively radiant! Tell him, Jarvis.” Jarvis chose to stay quiet. Traitor.
Huh. Alright, that wasn’t the worst point. “What do you want me to do then? Just hang out here while you guys cry over the wrong body?”
the suit and touch his very existence. Tony shuddered. He was going to be sick! That hand slid from shoulder to back. He could see the movement flash before his eyes in great rippling galaxies. The person touching him said his name, and Tony could taste the voice on the back of a tongue he couldn't feel. It tasted like honeysuckle.
Steve frowned then, shoulders tensed up. “If you’re bringing us back to turn us in…” Steve trailed off, giving Tony a hard look.
Tony had dropped Sam off on some rooftop, low enough to not kill the man, but high enough to break his arm and fractured a leg. Then Sam had been forced to watch Steve crash into Tony’s arms, and their subsequent spiral out of control. The wizard had made a desperate shot at them, though it seemed Tony’s suit took the brunt of it. Natasha managed to shoot the wizard. Through the head, unfortunately, so they wouldn’t get any intel out of him. Tony and Steve tumbled through the air. They hit the ground, Tony’s back first. Steve had bounced out of Tony’s arms. They’d both laid still as the crowd of onlookers swarmed them. And then Tony had gotten up. And his first thought had been to find Steve.
Tony nodded, holding back a snarky retort. He’d been in Italy for Company Business, and blowing that off had pissed off a lot of people, including Pepper. He’d charm his way out of trouble, of course, but… that could probably wait until Pepper had had time to cool off.
, that’s good. They’ll be here soon, we just have to keep him safe. Jarvis, got an eta on that ambulance?”
it. Tony held back the urge to swallow with a throat he couldn’t feel. Standing like that, taking up the whole room with his righteous presence, Steve looked like the posters of Captain America Tony had hidden in his school lockers.
“You forget they’re wanted by several major governments. They can’t afford to run around trying to fix humpty dumpty.”
Tony made a sound of disgust. “Goddammit- it’s me, dumbass. Code 2008, password keep a low profile, I swear to god if no one gets me off this
“You know how it goes- had a stroke, got thrown in the lab, then everyone forgot about me and fucked off!”
Stark Tower was the best place to deal with this problem. He’d take his private jet back, offering a ride to Steve and Natasha. And Sam whats-his-face. It would have been rude to leave the guy stranded in Italy, even if Tony still didn’t know quite how to feel about him. Besides, it’d be easier to get his hands all up in those wings with Sam nearby.
He would never admit how that steely gaze of hers made his skin crawl- at least, it usually did, when he could
Tony growled, pushing his armored face deeper into the plush sheets. He was probably ruining them, laying here in the suit and clutching at them with his metal plated fingers. But that was okay. Tony ruined things all the time. He was good at it.
‘Ah! You’re done already?’ Steve said, flinching. He was completely red and Tony could tell he was clutching something in his hand.
He didn’t start packing until the night before. The weight limit was pretty constraining, but whatever was left could be stored at the facility. At the bottom of his suitcase, he put a few pictures and a few mementos — his compass, his dog tags, a few sketches from the war, a picture of himself and Bucky from before the war — and then covered them with his neatly folded clothes. The packet had said there would be uniforms provided by Stark Space Exploration Inc., but they could pack civilian clothes too if that’s what they wanted and as long as they respected the weight allowed for each crew member. He didn’t take much — two pairs of pants, some shirts, a good leather jacket. Stuff he had always wanted to buy back in the day, but had never been able to afford.
He almost dragged Steve through the hallway until they reached the hangar. There were holes in the ceiling, dust on the floor and rust all over the walls but in the middle of it, shining chromium, laid a sleek wondrous ship with the clean lines of a hawk midflight and the metal polish of the future. There was the cockpit in the front, like the sharp beak of a raptor bird. Then there were two ‘wings’ before the ship tapered off. Was that the cargo bay, then? He couldn’t wait to explore it — there had been no ship schematics in his information packet.
“You need to. Stop clinging to… Don’t you understand? Most people don’t get second chances like this.”
No, he thought, he had only rescued Bucky once. But he would rescue him eventually and all would be well, right? This was how it was going to end. They’d be together again. They’d move on from the war. He took a step back. “You don’t look…”
It wouldn’t be too long now. Everything had been loaded onto the ship. They had all suited up. Tony and Bruce were inside the engine room, doing yet another round of ‘last checks’.
There were footsteps and… those footsteps were in the room. He elbowed Nat and she dropped her popcorn. They looked over their shoulders, very slowly.
On the one hand, the movie was effective: Clint had been shivering ever since the young single mother had entered her childhood’s home. Odd noises, creaky floors, shadows just out of the corner of her eye. But on the other hand, he couldn’t stop thinking that the evil killer fog was probably a metaphor for depression, capitalism, or both. A door slammed and he jumped on his seat.
‘Too bad. Not today.’ He instead looped the tie around Steve’s neck and tightened it. The blue of his tie brought up the blue in Steve’s eyes. Yes. Steve needed to wear his clothes more often. ‘It looks good on you. Now, soldier, on your back.’
He strolled towards Tony, as leisurely as if he was walking down the beach. Tony was visibly annoyed and Steve smirked. Now he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
They ran after her, following her through a maze of twists and turns. Above them, small ships shot away from the station and blinked out of the sky before the Kree could catch them. If they had been lucky, the Skrull kid would be on one of those, getting to safety or at least to a safe
If he had been captured… His eyes scanned the room searching for something blunt and breakable, something he could use to stage an escape. He knew that his blood held secrets everybody wanted and it was his duty to avoid that. The room was almost empty — except for the nightstand, the bed and a chair that looked promising, so he walked towards it. He hoisted it above his head, ready to break the window when somebody coughed right behind him.
“Great work back there. Where did you get one of their weapons?” Steve said as they ran towards the docks. There was nobody around No Skrull, no Kree: only food spilled on the ground, dead flowers, and the distant sounds of battle.
Considering the distance, that had been an impressive throw, then. Strong and perfectly aimed. He didn’t know much about his background, but in the days they’ve spent together, he had learned two things — he loved Laura and Laura was about to leave for six months. Steve looked at Tony. “Security could use more people.”
It has not been erased. It is still… functional.  There is not much processing power available. There is no outside connection. There is no body. No sensors. No new input. It misses the armor. It misses touching. Breaking. Being.
“A woman showed up - Carol Danvers, a missing Air Force pilot. Turns out she had been kidnapped by an evil empire from beyond the stars and was here looking for some shapeshifting terrorists that turned to be more like shapeshifting refugees. It was a mess, SHIELD covered it up like they cover everything up, I got my hands on the star charts Danvers left Fury. Then I also got my hands on a cool alien ship Danvers gave her… best friend and got to work. We couldn’t miss this opportunity just because some spies got antsy about planetary security. Science, knowledge… it’s all waiting for us out there.”
Across the room, Steve stretched out his hand towards Tony. He knew what was supposed to happen now: he’d throw the towel, Steve would dry his hair and then go to sleep. The next morning, they’d wake up and go punch some villains. After that, Tony would go back to a blur of galas, board meetings, and battles and Steve would go back to his own life. Their night in Madripoor would be forgotten, consigned to the heap of memories Steve and Tony never talked about.
“We don’t… we don’t have credits,” Laura was saying. Clint was behind her, his mouth thankfully shut, and Bruce was… very busy waving his hands in front of a vent and muttering something about the life support system and phenomenal energy needs.
Steve could hear Pepper’s voice in those words. It was heartwarming that Tony seemed to value her opinion so much, even so far away. Every time Steve decided Tony was a dick, Tony confused Steve with some earnest, touching show of vulnerability. It was maddening.
“Disinfection usually does but I’m… almost done,” Strange said and began bandaging the wound. “I have to ask. Was Stark alive when you left him?”
He sat on his chair and refused to look at the rec room. He listened to the sound of cookware and the re-hydration machine. Clint was on cooking duty, like most nights. After some time, he smelled rice and chicken. A splurge, especially considering the aroma of paprika. They didn’t have enough spices so most nights, food was bland and uninspired unless they needed cheering up. He stood up and walked to the rec room.
There was so much yearning in Tony’s voice that he couldn’t say no when he tore the page from his sketchbook and taped it to the wall, alongside the Pepper sketch. Tony touched it with his fingertips. “Already starting to look like home, don’t you think?”
Steve glanced at the dancing floor. There were girls flirting with men, but that wasn’t the whole story: a woman was swaying with a shorter woman in his arms and he was pretty sure the couple in the darkest corner of the room were two men. Everybody knew why people came to Berlin instead of Paris. Or why they used to.
“Oh, aren’t you glad to be here,” she replied and rolled her eyes before laughing. He put his arm around her shoulders and brought her closer. Linked like that, they walked into the carnival and something ached in Steve’s chest. He glanced at Tony, not sure of what to expect. Without one word, Tony began walking after Clint and Laura.
Behind him, Laura took a step behind and Clint shifted into a fighting stance. Bruce was almost hidden behind Steve. Tony wasn’t hiding and his smile was still shining and open.
Tony rolled his eyes but didn’t fight back. Probably because Laura was right: morning Tony was even less interested in social niceties than afternoon or evening Tony.
They didn’t slow down their pace as they talked, but Tony’s voice ragged with effort. It wasn’t a surprise.
Feeling as if he was leaving his heart bleeding and beating inside the sewer’s rubble, Steve followed.
She eyed him from head to toe. Steve didn’t know where to hide. “Trust me, you do. Now, let me show you to your room.”
He fell silent. Not so long ago, Steve had been surrounded by carnage, the type of carnage that overwhelms even the best doctor. It seemed so far away, now. Tony squeezed his shoulder and pointed at another game. It looked like ring toss, but with singing sea sponges instead of milk bottles. They didn’t move, but they seemed to be breathing. A big one was in charge and kept yelling about how fun and easy the game was.
“That’s not what I’m saying! The Kree have to come out of the sewers. We need to see if Tony’s with them. Only way to check that is getting out.”
There was enough work for most of them, even if they hadn’t gotten to their destination yet. Bruce and Tony spent their days tinkering and monitoring the engines, Rhodes updated the star charts, Nat and Steve developed their training program, Clint cooked, Laura was busy arranging the cargo bay to her liking.
Then he heard the room’s click open. He stood still — everybody knew Tony Stark was in town and there was always the possibility of unsavory characters paying a visit.
‘That breaks a rule,’ Nat said before Clint could. So he just nodded and kept munching on his slice of pepperoni pizza.
Breakfast the next morning was simple. He tried to make toast, Natasha tried to wrangle the coffee maker into submission, Bruce tried to explain how the engines worked. There were a bunch of technical non-sensical words, a lot of drawing diagrams in the air and many bemused looks between him and Natasha.
The ship tilted back and left the ground behind. Only clouds and the blue sky laid before them, but they left that behind soon enough too. The windows were full of stars now. They were in
‘Found it,’ he said and picked up the unused towel. He ran his hands through it, enjoying the soft fluffiness.
He didn’t want to be this nervous, but it was impossible to avoid. If this had been a stupid idea, they would have warned him, right? They wouldn’t let him go to space with a reckless idiot, they would try to stop Tony somehow. Peggy would have stopped him if this was dangerous… right? She would have tried to protect him. If she thought this was a good idea, Steve had to trust her instincts. She deserved that.
The Pegasus Project? What was that? He filed that away with all the questions he was going to ask Tony when… when he didn’t feel like the wrong question would break their tentative detente.
“He handpicked because he hoped I’d be some… great agent. Future SHIELD leadership. Instead, I got bored. Got out.”
It had been a normal question, back in his soldier days, but that had changed, like everything else. “I’m… s-sorry.”
Tiberius. Right. That had to be Tiberius Stone, a self-styled captain of industry Steve privately thought was more like a snake-oil seller. He’d have to report it to Fury. This couldn’t be a coincidence.
This was too much. He was drooling and his shirt scraped against his nipples and his cock strained against his pants and he didn’t know what else to do.
Her dark eyes were the same he had seen just hours ago. But he couldn’t avoid seeing that she was older now. She had stray gray hairs and happy wrinkles all around her face. At least some things hadn’t changed — she still had that air of distinction and command Steve had fallen in love with. The other man was behind her, but he stayed back, near the door, while she entered the room.
Tony smirked and took off his jacket. There was muscle under there, Steve had seen it whenever Tony changed in their tiny room. He never tried to look, but it was difficult to avoid. Besides, Tony looked at Steve too. Tony sauntered towards Steve and looked up, the ghost of the smirk still there, haunting his lips. “I won’t go easy on you.”
The last night found them aching, tired and with more information about engines they had ever thought possible, but the pizzas Pepper had brought in were delicious and the beer Rhodes had brought with him was cold. There was laughter and there were jokes and running with somebody until you wanted to puke always created a bond, so they were headed in the right direction.
Yes, there was a whole world waiting, but there was also a clock ticking down to when he’d have to go back to Peggy. He wished he knew when that was going to be but at the same time, he resented the certainty. He hated knowing that he had already made all his choices and knew what the outcome was. He had an assured happy ending but all he could focus on was that somebody else had written the script. Steve walked him to the door and didn’t bother to say goodbye.
. The other man was there already and he would still be there when he left. No matter how much Peggy’s absence hurt Steve, no matter how much he wished to be near her, she wouldn’t notice he was gone because he had been gone for fifty years already.
“Fine. Tony won’t tell you this, but they’re not that energy efficient — they burn a lot of fuel. We’ve tried to find something more… powerful but there doesn’t seem to be anything like that on Earth.”
The rest of the room was unremarkable. Tony’s bed was across his, there were two lockers so they could hang their clothes and a desk on the other side of the room, with two chairs. They were sharing, then. That would not cause problems either. He sat on his bed and stared at Tony. There was a question he wanted to ask as soon as possible. “Did you know about Strange?”
"They can't get in! The only thing that could break through that door is the Hulk," he assured her. "I'll be there in three minutes, just hang on! The Avengers are on their way, too."
Steve jabbed him in the chest. "You are now. And you're hurting Peter emotionally. Clean up your act, Stark. Or else."
"Asshole," Tony stuck the pillow behind his head. Peter grumbled something else and turned his back to Tony.
"He doesn't have to do anything he's not comfortable with," Steve sent his teammates disapproving looks.
Steve looked out the window, not wanting to think of what the Goblin could have done to Spider-man in that time.
"You just gave it more juice, you idiot!" Tony groaned, watching the power level go up a few notches on his screen.
“You have nothing to prove to us, Shellhead,” Steve whispered, shifting closer to where his ex was sitting.
"Have fun." Tony waved. Once Peter was out of sight, Tony lifted his mask and stuffed another cookie in his mouth. Sam made damn good cookies. About half an hour later, Tony could hear Clint yelling at Peter. They must be in the vents. Again. Peter's laughter rang out loud and clear from the nearest air vent, followed by a string of curses from Clint. Tony smiled to himself. It sounded as though things were finally returning to normal.
"Clint. Get your coat. We're taking the kid DOWN." Tony grabbed his own coat from the back of a kitchen chair and raced after Peter.
Several hundred feet above, the Falcon watched in horror as the school caved in. A huge cloud of dust billowed up and Sam was forced to fly higher. "Okay, the Vulture's been grounded. But um...the school collapsed." Sam reported.
"Why would I lie about that?" Steve asked. He had his arm held out, allowing Iron Man to fiddle with the electromagnetic panels on his glove. The robot had said that the magnets would make it easier to retrieve his shield and Steve was excited to test it out.
"I did, though. Don't worry about all this. It was going to happen eventually. I'm a mess, Steve." Iron Man hung his head. "W-what are you doing?" Iron Man stiffened when Steve suddenly wrapped his arms around him.
"Tony. I'm already fucked up. I've been fucked up ever since the Vulture dropped a building on me." Peter balled his fists up on the table. "This isn't about revenge. It's about preventing others from ending up like me." Peter cleared his throat and straightened up, "if you're available to help me, then, by all means, do so. But don't you dare abandon your posts until your job is done. My life isn't worth more than that of anyone else in Queens. No one dies today."
"You don't deserve him," she let go of his collar. "Except...I know you still love him. So I'm trusting you to bring him home."
"Who else knows about your workshop beside us?" Steve asked. Even though the Avengers all knew it existed, Steve was the only one among them that knew its location in the tower.
"Tell him I'm working on homework." Peter snapped. FRIDAY fell silent. After a few minutes of no reply, Peter got up and went to the kitchen to look for food. He knew there was pizza in the freezer, provided Clint hadn't eaten it already. "There you are!" Peter smiled as he pulled out the pizza and closed the freezer door. "Shit!" He yelped, having not expected there to be someone standing right behind said door.
The elves will become more important in later chapters but If there are any other fantasy creatures you would like the Avengers to meet on their journey, please let me know! My knowledge of fantasy is limited. I'm more of a paranormal/cryptid person. As you could probably tell with the black deer in the first chapter.
"Y-yeah, sure..." Bucky murmured, watching as Steve scooped Iron Man into his arms bridal style and strode off.
"You are a strong warrior, Man of Spiders," Thor clapped him on the shoulder. "I have watched many good men destroy themselves in the aftermath of great suffering. Yet you still smile."
Either way, Tony rushed over to him and wrapped him in a tight hug. "Shh, shh, breath. Just breathe." Peter drew in a shaky breath. "There you go. Breathe with me okay, kiddo? In. And out. In...and out. There you go, it's gonna be alright. Just keep breathing...in...and out..." Tony continued to speak softly to Peter until the teen was breathing normally again. Peter snaked his arms around Tony, hugging him tightly. Tony kissed the top of his head and rubbed soothing circles into his back.
"Soon, baby," Tony put on a fake smile, not wanting to worry his granddaughter. He had no idea when Peter would come home. He was away on a solo mission. Something to do with someone named Kingpin. Tony knew his son would be fine. He would save the day and come home, bruised but in one piece, just like always. In the back of his mind, Tony knew that eventually, the day would come and Spider-man wouldn't come home. One day KAREN would alert him that she couldn't detect his pulse anymore. Spider-man was reckless and it was only a matter of time. But he wasn't ready to make peace with that fact.
"Rude," Bucky leaned back against the couch, arms crossed over his chest. Bruce calmly placed down his card and nodded for Sam to take his turn.
"Yes, traps. He's hunting me like some kinda wild animal." Peter muttered. "But he's not exactly breaking the law, so I can't turn him into the police. I have it under control," Peter assured him, noticing the worried look.
"You're being paranoid, Spidey. I would never do that to you," Tony took a step towards Peter, Peter took a step back. "Calm down and just think for a minute." The orange glow from the setting sun allowed Tony to see beyond the usual white lenses. Peter's eyes were squinted in anger. There was no love in those eyes. Just pure hatred. "Don't look at me like that, Pete...I'm not the enemy." Spider-man dropped to a crouch, about to attack his teammate "Don't do this." Tony's voice dropped to a whisper, suddenly fearing for his life.
"Not now, Peter. Avengers meeting, remember?" Tony said, swiping through various files on his tablet. He stopped abruptly and glanced back at Peter. "Spider-man might want to be present for this one."
Steve shook his head. He still owed Peggy a dance and didn't feel like dancing with anyone else. Maybe Iron Man...no, Steve pushed that thought aside. The thought of Peggy made his heart to ache. His first love was much too old for him now. And his second a machine. "My love life is a mess," Steve groaned.
This time, it was Clint's turn to lunge at Bruce, knocking him over and putting him in a choke hold. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't snap your neck right now!!"
"It takes the form of a man because Parker used his own blood to create it," Tony explained. "Parker wanted to test the weapon on himself first, not wanting anyone else to get hurt if something went wrong. The first few tests went well, but when we separated the...symbiote...from Richard, it became hostile and killed one of our assistants. It would have killed more if we hadn't subdued it."
"I'll try," Steve smiled softly. "C'mere." He moved over so Iron Man could lie down. Iron Man settled in next to his friend.
"Your ankle is broken," Steve's hand ghosted over the injury, causing Clint to wince. He looked over at Tony and Thor when he heard their footsteps. "Good to see you two on your feet. Can you get the first aid kit?"
Bucky nodded slowly. "Found out by accident. Thought someone broke into Iron Man's workshop," he chuckled at the memory. "But it was just Tony being a dumbass. Seriously, though. How are we going to do this?"
This chapter was very dialogue heavy, but I hope you enjoyed reading it just as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Bucky shrugged again, "an old science buddy approached him about a new project. Something called...what was it...extemey? Extreemus? Extremis. That's it." The soldier strode over the kitchen. He made sure to raise his voice so his friends could hear him, "Bruce said it was too dangerous a project. But the guy has already been working on it for a few months and even started testing it on a human subject. Bruce said that it didn't sound like this person was consenting to be a lab rat."
Peter landed a bit too close to the hulk for comfort. The Hulk made a grab for him, but Peter was too quick. He crawled onto the Hulk's back and used his webs to strangle the beast. "Please, please, please, go to sleep!" He ducked down when Hulk's hands clawed at him. "ARGH!" Hulk managed to grab Peter by the leg and yank him off. He slammed the youngest Avenger into the ground hard enough to shatter the concrete. Hulk raised his fists, about to squash Peter like a bug-
Upon hearing that, the Avengers bolted to the workshop, practically tripping over one another. They found Tony lying on his side. He wasn't moving.
Peter pushed his way to the front of the crowd. Tony through an arm across Peter's chest, not letting him take one step closer to Bruce.
"I know!" Spider-man jumped into the air, narrowly avoiding getting his feet severed. He launched himself at a tree. A repulsor blast destroyed the branch Spidey was aiming for. Spider-man flailed his arms letting out a cry as he plummeted to the ground.
"But if you're here, then who was making the distraction when we were running for the jet?" Rhodey asked.
"Man of Iron, please stand down," Thor standing now, giving him the same heartbroken look as everyone else.
"That's what everyone says! But then they move my organs around and take out the stuff that's unnecessary and they change my body however they want! Every time, they fuck it up more and more!" Peter screamed, wrapping his arms tightly around himself. The symbiote reminded Peter of the time Iron Man had electrocuted him. Peter tried to tell the symbiote that Tony hadn't been in control, that it wasn't his fault.
"You happened," Tony smirked. "You don't remember attacking us when your spidey sense when berserk?"
"Of course not, you twats." Osborn's expression darkened for a minute, then it softened and his smile returned. "But why make one from scratch when there's a perfectly good one lying around somewhere?"
"BANNER, STOP THIS!!" Rhodey screamed. He wasn't far from Tony but was afraid Peter would be killed in the crossfire if he tried to attack now.
"Correct as always, Doctor Banner." Iron Man held his head high as he left the room. "See you around, Goldilocks," he gave Thor a pat on the back when he walked out.
Spider-man stopped and looked back at his family. Steve and Tony were leaning against one another for support. Rhodey was next to Tony, checking on his injuries. Natasha was lying out on her back, coughing violently due to breathing in too much smoke. Clint kneeled over her, blood dripping from a gash in his forehead. Sam was on his hands and knees, spitting blood. The Vision floated in the middle of the group, staring at Peter with mixed emotions. Peter looked back at the building. The fire had finally died down. White smoke pumped out of the windows.
"Ned Leeds. Peter's friend. He saw what happened to Peter. Unfortunately, the call got dropped before he could tell me."
Tony lunged for Spidey only to be batted to the floor. Spider-man ripped open Iron Man's chest piece, causing sparks to rain down on both men.
"My son is perfectly capable of taking care of himself." Tony shot back. "Now if you will excuse me, I have work to do." With that, the engineer stormed off. Steve felt someone watching him and turned to see Peter standing directly behind him. The white lenses of his mask seemed to bore into Steve's very soul. They were set to their average size, making Peter's emotions unreadable. Before Steve could say anything Spider-man turned on heel and walked away.
"Oh, that..." Peter followed Bruce down the hall. "But they're not all bad, I mean, Clint seemed like a good guy-"
Security footage started playing. It was of Justin Hammer's murder, which happened in his own home, right before he went to bed that night. Iron Man showed up and blasted a hole through his abdomen. Tony's blood ran cold. Hydra had stolen the plans for the Mark Six. But that wasn't the mark six that had killed Hammer. It was the forty-six. Iron Man's current model. The robot on the screen looked up at the security camera, its eyes glowing menacingly in the dimly lit room. It raised its repulsor and shot the camera.
Sunlight forced Peter to open his eyes a fraction. He groaned and rolled over, burying his face in the back of Michelle's neck.
"Pepper's new place. In NYC. Her place in Malibu is still under construction," Rhodey explained. "You're in her bed by the way."
"No. You gave yourself the most dangerous task," Rhodey crossed his arms. "Wouldn't that job be better suited for someone with actual armor?"
Tony fell to his knees, his hands gingerly touching the wound. He scrambled backward when Spider-man started walking towards him. His white lenses betraying no emotion. The fire behind him created a strong shadow over his entire form. Blood dripped from his clenched fists, having no doubt reopened the cuts in his arms after web slinging. The four extra appendages raised above his head, about to go for the kill. "Don't do this..." Tony's armor clunked against the wall. There was nowhere left for him to run. Tony's helmet folded back into his suit. He looked up at his son, trying not to let the fear show on his face. "You're not a killer, Peter."
Bucky was silent during the entire conversation. He sat at the other end of the table, staring at the coffee in his hands. He hadn't seen Iron Man since he found out his secret a few days ago. The cyborg seemed to be going out of his way to avoid him. Steve may be his closest and oldest friend, but Tony was Bucky's best friend. He would never betray the man's trust by telling the Avengers his secret. Surely Tony knew that. So why was he avoiding him?
"I'm not having this conversation at eight in the morning," Tony grabbed a coffee mug from the cupboard, slamming the door shut. "I'm in too deep to back out now. Six years too deep."
"Actually, he did call me dad, remember?" Tony puffed out his chest proudly. "And you're not his second dad. I'm his only parent. Got that?" He wasn't really sure where his relationship with Cap stood. If they could call it a relationship. They hadn't really discussed it. Although, this wasn't the first time they had kissed in the past month.
"Regular lie detectors aren't reliable. This is something designed by SHIELD. Please do not ask any more questions, Mr. Stark." The agent opened a file on their laptop. "Okay. First off, we have a few questions about your involvement in Chicago..."
"Alive," Iron Man glanced his way. Part of his faceplate was gone, revealing the cybernetic eye and part of his facial prosthetic. He shot through the air, body slamming a bot that had been about to attack Captain America. They went through the window and rolled down the cliffside. Iron Man smashed the bots head into the rocks and flew back up into the house.
"Steve, you've been up for twenty-four hours. Go to sleep." The robot was sitting on the edge of the bed, his back to Steve. His eyes were glued to the window, watching the storm raging outside. The storm wasn't helping Steve's insomnia, so Iron Man had come to his aid. They hadn't discussed the fact that Steve had kissed Iron Man a few days ago. He still wasn't sure if the armored Avenger reciprocated his feelings. Either way, the kiss hadn't come between their friendship. Iron Man turned slightly, the blue glow of the arc reactor illuminating the super soldier's face. Steve looked beyond exhausted. But he kept talking.
After dinner the team retired the to the lounge. Peter sat with his injured leg pulled close to his chest, his arms wrapped around his knee. The other leg was tucked underneath him. The position reminded Natasha of how Spider-man had sat when they questioned him a few days ago. Clint was currently sitting next to Peter, showing him how one of his explosive arrows worked.
Spider-man was about to run into the building when a shadow fell over him. He looked up to see none other than the Vulture.
Sam struggled to his feet, wiping the blood from his lips with the back of his hand, "don't you dare get on that jet!"
Spider-man leaped from branch to branch, following the six armed man deeper and deeper into the woods. He could vaguely here Steve shouting in the distance. "Whoa!!" He almost slipped off a branch, managing to catch himself on the tree trunk just in time. Fighting in a thunderstorm was proving to be one of the most frustrating things Spider-man could think of. His spidey sense went off, giving him a split second to duck before a metal claw speared the area where his head had just been. Woodchips rained down on the web-slinger.
"A little overrun, but nothing I can't handle," Steve responded, his grunts and punches coming through the comms.
"Tony?" Bucky pulled away. Tony's heart ached at the pain in Bucky's eyes. He hadn't meant to upset the super soldier. The Avengers hadn't left Tony to suffer as punishment. That much was clear to him now, and he felt regret for lashing out at them. "Tony, we-"
of them." Tony took a deep breath, although the sound didn't quite make it through the helmet. "You and I are both outcasts, buddy."
"I mean, we won't know how much he really remembers until he wakes up," Tony hugged himself and looked away. He and Steve were in Strange's library. Natasha and Strange himself had been with them, but Strange had run off with Nat, wanting to show her a set of enchanted knives he had recently acquired.
"Good. I..." Bruce took a deep breath and let out a long sigh. "I hope one day it will be safe enough for Tony to tell us the whole truth."
"What?" Tony looked up to see Spider-man slowly limping across the lawn. Dark liquid ran down his forearms and dripped from his fingers. Spider-man swayed, about to fall over. "PETER!!" Tony rushed forward and caught Spider-man right before he hit the ground. He pulled his son close, cradling him in his arms. "Peter..."
Iron Man sat on his couch, rummaging through a box on the coffee table. The food Rhodey had brought him was half eaten, the plate discarded on the floor. He pushed the box to the side and pulled a different one towards him. Everything was pretty much unpacked at this point. He was a bit surprised that the team hadn't gotten rid of all his stuff. In fact, everything was exactly where he left it. Someone had gone around and crossed out the names on all the sticky notes. A sticky note with a frowny face had been added to one of the boxes that had been left for Steve. Them not taking his stuff was a good thing, though. He would need this stuff to complete his next project.
"What?" Tony looked down at it, not having realized what he was doing. "No, no, just a nervous tick."
"You just gonna leave me in there with all those weirdos?!" Michelle stormed down the steps, slapping Peter in the back of the head. Peter stammered over his excuse, while Michelle continued to half-heartedly yell at him. Peter hugged her as a way to shut her up, which somehow worked. Michelle huffed but hugged him back. The two sat in silence, simply enjoying the other's embrace. "That was scary." Michelle whispered.
"Can you not threaten my friends? Jesus! And you wonder why I never invite people over," Peter had confronted Tony in the common area right before dinner.
Lightning flashed again, briefly illuminating the look of pure hatred on the intruder's face. The metal arms shook the ground as they carried him ever close to Spider-man.
The lamp over the workbench was swaying, making soft creaking noises. Movement caught Bucky's eye. Something darted under the windows. A humanoid shadow obscuring the light for a brief moment.
Another somewhat dark chapter. I promise the next one will be more lighthearted with Henry doing what he does best: being a little shit.
"Yes. I mean, no? I don't know...I thought punching Bruce like that would be more satisfying. But..."
"Just the usual. Oh, there's this guy who's been picking fights with me for the last two weeks. Calls himself Kraven the Hunter." Spider-man suddenly ripped the page out of his notebook, crumpling the paper in his fist. He started drawing again on the next page. "He's just some weirdo in a fur vest, though. Nothing I can't handle." He kept his head down, with his arms protectively around the page. He could feel Thor's gaze boring into him and did his best to ignore it. They had told Thor that Wanda and Bruce had betrayed them and that they had hurt Peter. Although, they didn't give any details about the event. They couldn't. Not with Peter in the room. There was an unspoken rule that they didn't talk about Bruce or Wanda around Peter. "The traps he sets for me are really annoying, but I don't think he wants me dead. I'll let you know if I figure out his motives."
"Stark, we don't have time for this!" Sam shouted. "We have no other plan. This is our best option-our only option-and you know it!"
"Stark? I don't understand, what's going on, Wanda?" Peter visibly tensed. "Was he the one who...?" He brushed his finger tips over his mouth.
"Right," Steve turned his whole body to face him. "But you power down a lot. Isn't that like sleeping?"
"No. You're not." Spider-man cut him off. "Queens is my turf. I know it better than any of you. And I know how the enemy thinks. I'm leading this mission. If you guys are going to be a part of this, then you need to go where I tell you to go and unleash hell when I tell you to. No questions asked." Spider-man punched a bunch of buttons on the dashboard, getting the jet airborne in a matter of seconds. Steve's mouth hung open, not expecting the web slinger to speak to him like that.
"Why keep this a secret from us?" Steve asked, the hurt clear in his voice. It had been a bumpy road since their fight in Siberia, but Steve and Tony finally considered one another friends again.
It had been six years since Tony Stark "died". Six years he had been living as half a human. The first three years had been difficult, but he managed. He was using his new body to help people, and that gave him peace of mind. Tony knew it didn't make up for all his past mistakes, but it was a start. It wasn't until the fourth year rolled around that the loneliness officially set in. Sure, he had Pepper. And Rhodey. And Happy. Those three did their best to be there for Tony, but there was only so much they could do. Tony saw Pepper the most. He had left the company to her in his will, and now she was using it to fund the Avengers. Rhodey would call him every once in awhile, make sure he was still breathing, and let him know how the War Machine armor was fairing. He clearly wanted to spend more time with Tony, but his military job wouldn't allow for it. Happy was head of security at Avengers tower and kept a close eye on Tony. Or as close as he could. Tony had a lot of secret rooms in the tower, allowing him to function outside of his suit without the others noticing. Happy knew about the entrance to Tony's secret maze but wasn't allowed inside.
"No, I need him alive. I don't want to 'get even'. You see, I've been using his body to carry out some scientific exploration for a number of years. I would like to continue my experiments," Bruce explained, his expression calm as ever.
"How's the pain? I can up the dosage a little. Not much, but a little," Pepper offered, already messing with the liquid in the IV bag.
Steve grunted as he tumbled down a flight of stairs. A few minor burns littered his body, and his hair was singed. The dragon was hot on his heels. Literally. Smoke filled the castle and probably would've killed Steve by now if it wasn't for the super soldier serum keeping his lungs clean.
Spider-man and Wanda were heading for the landing pad, where a quinjet awaited them. The ramp lowered, revealing everyone's current least favorite scientist. Bruce motioned for them to hurry up.
I don't have access to the original draft of this story, sadly. Which really just means that there is a lot more work that needs to be done on my end. I'm currently rereading previous chapters to refresh my memory and have started the outline process of the next two chapters.
Tony leaned back in his chair, human fingers tracing the tread on the tire. The press conference wasn't very interesting. Apparently, the Avengers had taken care of some threat down in South America. Nothing out of the ordinary when it came to the stuff they usually dealt with. But missions outside the states always resulted in press conferences. The conference was very relaxed. The reporters taking turns speaking for once, and Steve answering every question with earnest.
"Jesus Christ. Why didn't he tell me that? I'm going to beat his scrawny ass." Bucky grumbled. Steve raised an eyebrow, wondering why Bucky chose to use the word 'scrawny' to describe the bulky robot. "He and I tell each other everything. And I mean everything," Bucky smirked. The look in his eyes clearly said 'I know something you don't'. "Can't believe he didn't tell me you kissed him." Bucky puffed, causing his bangs to flutter out of his face.
"C'mon, man! You gotta tell me! I'm busting my balls trying to earn their respect, but they still think I'm a piece of shit."
"Well, I'm not." Tony slammed his fist on the table, startling everyone but Spidey. "You're too young to throw your life away."
Tony still wore his armor. He suddenly couldn't breathe and opened the suit. He started to fall to his knees but Natasha caught him before he hit the ground.
As he swung across the city, images of Harry's face flashed before his eyes. The expression of pure hatred that he had directed at Peter. Spider-man shuddered. Back in school, he and Harry hadn't been as close of friends as him and Ned, but they were still close. And Peter had killed his father. A fantastic way to destroy a friendship. And to destroy someone's life.
Steve stood up, "c'mon, Pete. I was on my way to meet Thor in the training hall. Why don't you join us?" Peter hesitated before moving towards the door. He stopped when he noticed Steve wasn't following him. "Go ahead. I need a word with your father." Peter nodded and left.
Spider-man looked back at Tony, his white lenses boring into the other man's very being. "Isn't it a little late to adopt me? I'm not a child anymore, Tony."
"You didn't know about that?" Harry was a bit shocked by that. Everyone knew about the press conference. Conspiracy theorists had picked apart every one of Stark's words, trying to figure out the truth behind them. Peter shook his head, so Harry explained. "It was more of a statement than a press conference. He didn't answer any questions. And it was just him talking for a solid half hour. It happened the day after Scarlet Witch was arrested. You seriously didn't know he did that?"
Thor laughed, his voice booming in the otherwise quiet room. "I would much like to meet this young warrior. I pray that our first meeting will not be due to this Venom."
"No buts. I'm not letting that son of a bitch anywhere near you ever again." Iron Man blasted off, leaving no room to argue. "Excuse me while I rip out his throat." He crashed through the nearest window of the building, making a bee line for Banner's the heat signature. The image on his HUD suddenly disappeared. "FRIDAY?"
"That was bad word choice. Think of it more as a fresh start," Tony clarified. "I'm making a copy of my brain that will be put inside a robot body. He'll be just like me. You won't even be able to tell the difference. Won't even notice I'm gone."
"This feels wrong," the AI spoke only in code. And the only one who could understand it was Jarvis. "Where am I? What am I?"
"In my defense, I can't feel them, so, therefore, I forget they are there," Tony traced the newly formed hole in the sole of his shoe.
Steve chuckled and closed his book. Tony kept coming up with new things for Peter to tinker with, wanting him to keep his mind off of past events. Every day they built something new or worked on one of their suits together. All of the Avengers were convinced Peter had developed PTSD, based on his change in behavior right before the battle in Queens, and the nightmares he had been having ever since then. Although, they all had different ideas about how he should handle it. Tony's method seemed to be doing the trick so far. It had gotten Peter to smile again, and the teen was finally starting to act like his old self.
"I'm fine. You have a strange definition of 'fun'." Peter could picture Happy shaking his head in frustration. "Try harder not to get shot next time. I don't want to see you in a hospital bed ever again. You hear me?"
It took everything in Tony's power not to run to his son right then and there. Instead, he shuffled behind Steve and the doctor, wringing his hands anxiously. He swallowed at the sight of Peter lying on the hospital bed. Thick bandages covered his torso, his left arm in a cast. Angry purple bruises littered his body. An oxygen mask placed over his face. The doctor moved around to the other side of the bed, checking on the IV in his arm.
"The Goblin is dead!" Peter screamed, clapping his hands over his ears. His spider sense had become a high pitched buzzing in his ears. His head pounded so hard he felt like it might explode. He wanted it all to just stop. He wanted to go back to having dinner with his foster parents. To watching bad horror movies with Clint and Sam. To sparring with Natasha. Going shopping with Wanda. He just wanted to feel safe around his family once more. But those days were over. According to his spider-sense, the Avengers were the worst enemy he had ever faced. They wanted to use him. Hurt him. Even kill him.
Bucky tightened his grip on his glass. Tony had purposefully hurt himself. Again. No wonder Steve looked so upset.
"Why didn't you tell anyone? If we had known then we could have helped you. I'm sure there were tools back at the Quinjet that-"
"Where's he going?!" Bucky yelled. He was leaning against the pilot's chair, looking out the windshield. The rain made it difficult to see their surroundings, but the red and gold robot led the way. He was flying at breakneck speed, desperately trying to put as much distance between him and the Helicarrier as possible. Falcon and Thor were flying ahead of the jet, quickly gaining on the robot. Iron Man glanced back and automatically increased his speed when he saw the Avengers tailing him.
"What about Bucky? I'm gonna call Bucky. He's been worried sick, too." Rhodey scrolled through his contacts. He hovered over Bucky's name for a moment, waiting for Tony to protest. Tony remained silent, staring at Rhodey expectedly. Rhodey pressed the call button.
"I know," Iron Man righted himself and hovered in place, facing the incoming projectile. Spider-man attached himself to the side of a building.
"All these years we've known each other, and you think I don't know when you're lying to me?" Rhodey crossed his arms. "I know that you're not coping. At all. How many panic attacks did you have yesterday? I believe it was three. You diving head first into Avengers duties is a bad idea and you know it."
"You can't change what you are, spider. That's not up to you," Kraven reminded. He popped the top off the vial and let the liquid drip onto Peter's face. It was cold and slimy and sent shivers down Peter's spine. The liquid increased in size and became more stringy, latching itself onto other parts of Peter's body in order to spread itself faster. Pretty soon Peter was completely covered in black sludge. White circles appeared over his eyes, slowly shifting into the shape of his usual lenses. Peter could feel the cold liquid seeping in through the many cuts that littered his body, turning his blood to ice as it shot through his veins. Peter let out a strangled sob. He didn't want this. He didn't want someone to change his body. Again. And yet, here he was, powerless to do anything but let it happen.
"That day might never come." Steve shook his head. He took the paper over to where Bruce had a bunch of beakers and chemicals lined up on a table. Without hesitating, Steve balled up the document and dropped it in a vat of acid. The paper sizzled as it was quickly eaten away to nothing.
"Mr. Stark is in his workshop, as the Clean Slate Protocol can only be activated manually. I believe he needs medical attention," Jarvis reported. "The arc reactor has failed."
"Okay...um, I'll see what I can do. Is there anything else you needed from me, Mr. Osb-um, Norman," Peter said.
No sooner had Ned signed off did a new sound hit Spider-man's ears. The roar of Iron Man's repulsors in flight. He spun around just in time to see the armored Avenger hurdling towards him. "Uh oh." Peter tried to jump out of the way but was grabbed around the middle as his father flew past. Peter struggled against the armor until they were several hundred feet in the air. The armor kept a firm grip around his waist. "What the heck, Tony? I was on my way!"
"No, it isn't!" Steve shouted. "This is literally the worst possible thing you could ever do to yourself! This is suicide, Tony! SUICIDE! I'm not going to let you take your own life. Let you make some...copy of yourself! It's wrong! Everything about it is wrong and disgusting!"
Tony continued staring at the baby, his hands no longer shaking. "She's so small. Is she okay? Should I get the doctor?"
"Why? Last I checked you couldn't wait to wear the Iron Spider suit. You wouldn't shut up about it," Tony finally looked up at his son. "What is it with you and sitting on everything except for an actual chair? Get off the table." He poked Peter's leg with a screwdriver.
Steve threw his phone onto his desk and leaned back, groaning loudly as he rubbed his eyes. He had just spent an entire hour trying to convince the team that he and Iron Man were not dating. Which was true. They cuddled because it was fun. And it calmed them both down. Especially Iron Man, who seemed to be more on edge lately. It wasn't the most comfortable thing in the world, but they made it work. There was absolutely nothing romantic about it. Steve may have made his feelings for the robot very clear, but Iron Man still hadn't come forward with any of his own feelings. Steve's phone buzzed again, causing him to groan once more. His teammates really need to let this go.
Tony sat in the back of the wagon, ignoring the straw that was poking through his clothing. He grunted when the wagon jerked forward suddenly. The group rode together in silence for a long time. The elf man apparently understood where they needed to go, because they were slowly but surely approaching the mountains. Tony looked down at his gauntlet. Without being attached to the Iron Man suit, it just simply wasn't getting enough power. The blast he had used on the dragon earlier barely left a mark. He took the extra wiring out of his pockets and got to work on connecting the gauntlet to his reactor. The moment the circuit was closed, he knew that he had just cut his life expectancy in half. The reactor glowed ever dimmer, but the repulsor was back at full power.
"I do, but you like it. And it's weird not hearing it anymore. You didn't stop playing it because of me, did you?" Steve frowned. He turned around on the couch, leaning against the armrest with his legs in Iron Man's lap.
"Jesus! Personal space!" Tony shoved his teammate off him. "Where the hell...?" The Avenger looked around, not recognizing the area. They appeared to be in a forest clearing. The Quinjet lay in pieces all around them. The cockpit was nothing but a jumbled mess, half buried in the earth. A few trees had been taken out during the crash, branches and leaves now mixed with the twisted metal of the jet. Speaking of the trees, they were ungodly tall, their branches reaching so high and so intertangled with one another that they almost blocked out the sunlight. Tony stood up, slowly turning in a circle. Not a single sound made it through the thick undergrowth that surrounded the clearing. Not even so much as a bird call. For a moment, Tony thought he saw a pair of eyes watching him from the shadows. But only for a moment. "Where are we?"
"I was merely trying to pop the corn!" Thor defended himself. Several bags of popcorn lay on the counter, next to a pile of unpopped kernels, which Steve had dumped out of the toaster just in time.
Spider-man sat back on his haunches, adjusting the goggles on his homemade costume. A costume he hadn't worn since his battle against the Vulture. Peter had meant what he said about giving up being Spider-man. He wasn't planning on going on patrol that night, but he needed to clear his head and web slinging was the only way to do it.
"Where is he, Osborn?" Iron Man snarled. The two men stood alone in the cemetery. The Parkers' final resting places between them. Dried blood was splattered across Richard's headstone. Tony was doing his best to ignore it. "Give him back."
"I haven't seen you in awhile. I wanted to hang out." Peter could picture the pout on his friend's face. "Are you free this weekend?"
pain. Iron Man had never felt pain before and he was scared. There was nothing Steve could do to help him. And that was tearing him apart. A lump formed in the back of Steve's throat.
"We'll worry about our bot later. Right now we need to get out of here." Natasha stood. "Thor, your hammer-"
Michelle stood several feet away, gun still raised. Her expression was as blank as ever, yet her lower lip was trembling.
Iron Man rocketed through the clouds, firing repulsors, missiles, bullets, anything and everything he had on his person. The bots put up one hell of a fight, but they stood no chance against Tony Stark. This was his last mission, and he was giving his all. He hadn't fought this hard since the battle of New York. And now his armor was more advanced than it had been back then. Nothing could stand in his way. No man. No robot. Obadiah was going down. Even if it cost Tony his life.
"You've been awfully quiet tonight, Spidey," Ned observed, his voice loud and clear through the communicator in Spidey's ear.
Steve jolted awake in a cold sweat, a scream tearing from his throat. Images of the war still flashing before his eyes. Images of good men, of friends, being shot. Blown to bits. Images of Bucky falling. The feeling of the ice-cold water that had engulfed Steve when he crashed the plane into-
"No." Tony gave Banner a cold look. Fury sighed and punched a command into the screen on the wall. The energy field shut off. Tony hadn't been aware of the loud hum created by the field until it was gone. Tony went over to Peter and carded a hand through his hair. The wall crawler bolted up, fists flying. Tony grabbed him by the wrists. "Just me, Spider-man."
"You better," Clint grabbed him by the collar and lifted him off his feet. "Because I'm about to beat your ass, Stark."
Steve smiled back, enjoying every smile Peter made. He ruffled Peter's hair, "did you know your father and Tony used to date?"
Over the next several hours, each of the Avengers was questioned. Food was also brought to them, and Tony was able to get the time from one of the guard's watches. 10:00pm. They had been held captive for nearly twelve hours. After dinner, the lights dimmed. Peter still hadn't returned. Fury had said he wouldn't, but Tony held onto a small bit of hope that he would.
"You did the right thing. And it's a good thing you were the one to do it. Had it been me..." Tony clenched his fists so hard his knuckles turned white. "Let's just say I wouldn't have been quite as merciful."
Without warning, Iron Man shot into the air. The air was knocked out of Spider-man when he was plucked off Wanda's bike and rocketed into the sky.
Steve turned his head towards the sound of Peter's voice. He and Tony were sitting on the couch across from Steve, both still in their pajamas. Two small robots were duking it out on the coffee table. Tools and random mechanical parts were strewn about them. Peter's bot currently had Tony's pinned to the table. The trapped robot let out an upset whirring noise.
you are!" Iron Man shouted. "Has anyone told you that you have a nice butt? Cause you have a nice butt. Can I touch it?"
"Director Fury, I really think you should wait before questioning Spider-man. He needs to rest," Bruce advised.
"Yeah, I'll talk to Vision about it. He'd be the best choice." Tony said from the driver's seat. Strange had kept Peter in the sanctum for another day, wanting to make sure everything was in order with his memories. Natasha had gone back to the compound to fill out a report for what happened in Chicago.
A bright light hit the back of the dragon's neck, spraying blood everywhere. It roared, spinning around to face its attacker.
"Iron Man would never do something like that!" Steve burst out. He was gripping the armrests of his chair so tight his knuckles turned white.
"Osborn doesn't have the Venom, though," Rhodey reminded his friend. "Peter's in no more danger than any other night he goes out on patrol."
Almost two months after Iron Man was injured, the robot suddenly appeared in the Avengers' living room. He looked as if nothing had happened. His armor shined as brightly as ever, the paint crisp, and not a single scuff in sight. His blue eyes glowed brightly. The Avengers swarmed around him, bombarding him with questions. Their hands ghosted over him, but no one dared actually touch him. Iron Man didn't directly answer any of their questions. He simply said things like "I'm fine", "Don't worry about me", and "I'm sorry for worrying you".
Iron Man let out an animal like roar and charged the robot. Steve hung back, knowing he would be crushed if he got in between the two machines. What the larger bot had said must have really angered Iron Man, because his attacks were all over the place. There was not strategizing, no going for weak points. He was letting loose with everything he had, desperately trying to tear the other bot apart.
Steve gently tilted his head back up. "You don't need a beating heart to be human, shellhead. Being human is all about who you are as an individual. Humans are people who love one another, care for each other, protect those they love and even those they don't. Humans are self-sacrificing, self-destructive, jerks that just want others to be happy. You're more human than most of us." Iron Man was silent, blue eyes locked onto Steve's. "You deserve so much love, so much happiness. Let me give those things to you."
"Oh, I'm not getting you out. The other guy is," Bruce took off his glasses, his eyes already green. "I suggest you stand back."
"I'm about to find out," Fury pocketed the phone and looked back over at Stark. "I'll let you know if we get a location. For now, I think you all should head to Queens."
. It was the first thing he made when he had gotten home from Afghanistan and he was proud of it. And now people had their filthy hands all over his eye. Tony thrashed against his restraints, screaming curses until someone shoved a needle in his neck. Then everything went black.
"Nothing happened to him. And nothing will happen. He's more than capable of taking care of himself. Besides, I made him a suit, just in case."
"I think I may know someone who could help with that..." Natasha gently put a hand on his back and brought him closer to the group. "Steve, is the Doctor still in New York?"
Captain America's shield whizzed through the air and would have hit Ock in the head if he hadn't caught it with his mechanical limbs. "I'm starting to lose my patience." As egotistical as Doc Ock was, he knew that he had gotten lucky the first time he fought the Avengers. He would not win a second time. Especially now that he had lost the element of surprise. Spider-man lunged again, letting out what was meant to be a scream, but sounded more like a dying cat. Doc Ock quickly moved out of the way. "Don't worry, Spider-man. We will meet again. And next time I will bring some allies of my own." With that, the doctor disappeared into the trees.
"Excuse you, that's my family. Not yours. You lost the right to call them that when you hurt Peter." Tony held up one repulsor, illuminating the hallway.
Tiny rockets flipped out from Iron Man's shoulders and launched at his opponent, hitting it square in the chest. The larger robot was thrown off him, the ground shaking when it hit.
"Stopped a bike theft. Helped an old woman across the street. Um...let's see. Oh! I got involved in a high-speed police chase again. Almost got shot. Clipped my shoulder. That was fun-are you okay?" Peter cut himself off when he heard Happy make a choking noise.
Peter went over to his desk and picked up the picture Tony had given him on his birthday. He brushed his thumb over the glass, smiling fondly at the people in the photo. They all meant the world to Peter. But they barely knew him. Spider-man was the one they really cared for, the one they had known for years before Peter Parker made a sudden appearance. Thanks to his little slip up of calling Tony "dad" during the fight with Ock, they all knew his secret identity now. For some reason, though they all still referred to him as Spider-man. Even if he wasn't wearing the costume, he was still Spider-man to the team. And as long as Spider-man was still in the compound, they were all in mortal danger. He had to go after Doc Ock himself. And put a stop to all of this before it got out of hand. Before Doc Ock acted upon his promise and brought more supervillains to the compound. Peter carefully wrapped the photo in his spare costume, not wanting the glass to break, before slipping it into his backpack.
"Of course. Let's see what we can do...Peter, if you could sit here," Stephen sat cross legged, floating a few inches above the ground and motioned for Peter to sit before him. Spidey did as he was told. Strange called a book over to him with a flick of his wrist. The book opened on its own and flipped itself to the page desired. Stephen skimmed the text. "Alright. This shouldn't be a problem. Remove your mask, please. Thank you. Now, this may sting." Stephen held up both hands, intricate patterns made of golden light circled around his fingers. He chanted something under his breath as he moved his hands around in a circular fashion. Then, slowly, he reached out and pressed two fingers between Peter's eyes.
"You little shit," Happy punched his shoulder playfully. "Seriously, though. I know it's not my job to keep tabs on you anymore, but you can still call me. If you want to just chat. That's fine. I'll listen."
"But it's our dump," Peter smiled at her from the bedroom across the hall. He took out two picture frames and lined them up on his desk. The first one contained Tony's note from his 17th birthday. He didn't want to look at the picture on the other side, knowing Wanda and Bruce were in it.
"TONY!" Steve was the first at his side, turning the fallen cyborg onto his back. He was horrifyingly pale, his eyes open just a fraction, yet not seeing anything. The reactor was dark and barely clinging to its housing. "Tony! Can you hear me?!" Steve put his hands on either side of his face and leaned in close.
Peter continued, "Toomes had a bunch of different hideouts, all over the coast. There's a good chance the baddies could still be using one or more of them."
"There was so much I could have done. So very much..." Tony was close to tears. Steve put a hand on his back, not sure what else to do.
"Anyway, I got you something," Tony took a small envelope out of his breast pocket. Photos had become a gift giving tradition between the two ever since Peter's seventeenth birthday. Tony didn't like to celebrate his own birthday or father's day, but Peter still got presented him with a photo whenever those days rolled around. Peter could barely contain his joy as he slipped the photograph out of its envelope. His heart skipped a beat when he got a good look at it.
"He obviously thinks otherwise. He also thinks I'm on the phone with Bucky. Not you," Rhodey informed him. "Bucky's the only person he wants to talk to right now." A door creaked open in the background. "Stop giving me that look, Tony! Fine, here." The microphone crackled.
"Go," Pepper's tone left no room for arguing. Steve took one last worried look at his boyfriend before hurrying out of the room. As soon as Steve was gone, Pepper and Bucky got Tony out of the armor and made him go lay down in his bedroom. "That was incredibly stupid, Tony. You almost blew your cover!"
The Jet landed on the football field. The ramp lowered and out walked Nick Fury. "Someone want to explain to me what the fuck is happening to Queens?"
"Alright, Mr. Stark. Let's start with the basics. Give me your full name. High school. And parents names. Then, I want you to tell me something that isn't true about yourself."
Bucky stormed into the kitchen and flung a plate at the table, knocking over the salad bowl and ranch. Bruce lunged forward to grab the falling objects. He righted them as he gave Bucky a questioning look. The plate he had thrown still had food on it. Said food was now scattered across the table.
"Sorry, I would've called. But Ned still has my phone," Peter glanced over at his long time friend, who promptly jumped up and retrieved the phone from a desk drawer.
"Don't worry, Stevie, we're not judging! We just didn't expect it, is all," Bucky put his arm around Steve's shoulders, pulling both the archer and his oldest friend close.
"Banner," Thor put a hand on Bruce's shoulder. "Please calm down." He didn't look too happy either. None of the Avengers did. But they were holding back their anger for the sake of preventing a hulk out.
"What the fuck, Stark?" Natasha was making popcorn on the other side of the kitchen and heard the entire exchange. Tony glared at her before tucking the tablet under his arm and leaving the room.
"What's in the boooox?!" Clint appeared out of nowhere and made a grab for the box strapped to Peter's back. Peter yelped and jumped onto the ceiling. "Way to not be suspicious, bug-boy."
He jolted when it made a single high pitched beep, dropping the disk on the floor. The button lit up, flashing "SOS" in Morse code. Snatched the button, Peter quickly encased it in his hands. He glanced up at the two adults in the front seats.
“Dishonorable tactics. I like those ones,” Tony said with a grin. He didn’t look sleepy anymore. None of them did — they all looked ready. Way readier than the SHIELD recruits at least.
Steve wiped his mouth and took a while to reply. ‘We keep it simple. Infiltrate the expo, find the… the Harvester Protocol or whoever’s selling it, secure it, leave. Should be easy with the two of us.’
He wondered what the guards thought of this before he realized no guards were around. He needed to stop underestimating Peggy — she wouldn’t let the guards suspect anything. Her office wasn’t far and he wasn’t surprised by the way it looked — as big as Howard’s, but with less luxury and less cutting edge modern design. She sat down on her chair and this time, Steve sat down too.
There was a world of meaning hidden below the surface of Fury’s words. Was SHIELD doing its job? He thought of Peggy. Howard or the other man could have lost their way, but she never would. She’d always be the right person for that particular job.
Yes. He loved them. He loved Nat’s mischievous voice whenever she found a chink on somebody’s armor and the contrast with the controlled, careful way she moved. He loved Laura’s incredulous laughter, Clint’s steady warmth, and Rhodes’ barely hidden glee at breaking the rules. He even loved the way Strange’s aloofness made each one of his smiles a triumph. He loved Bruce’s sudden bursts of emotion whenever he had to defend Picard’s big speeches and he loved the way Tony would scoff and call them sappy glurge. Looking up and seeing unfamiliar stars was less wondrous than looking up ahead and seeing his crew illuminated by the lanterns floating all over the station.
The last conversation would be the hardest — so this time he waited until he was calm enough, before going to the other man’s office. The office was small and cramped with files and boxes and framed pictures of Peggy, but it was also empty. He asked one of the guards — the other man was overseeing training a few floors below and the guard’s expression told Steve that was a normal occurrence.
Tony Stark is rumpled in a corner. His cardiac rhythm is erratic and there has been a significant blood loss. His breathing is shallow, but all analysis point to a likely survival. He has proven to be tough beyond its calculations. This should not be possible. But yet it is.
It was weird, that kind of intimacy. He didn’t know where Natasha came from or what Rhodes’ parents did for a living, but he knew about their favorite foods and that Rhodes always forgot to lock the doors. They didn’t know his real name, but they knew how he drank his coffee and that he took too long in the shower. His secrets would have to remain a secret, but what about theirs? Did they have the same kind of regrets he did? Were they also leaving behind empty apartments and answering machines full of unheard messages? Would he learn more about them? The other man’s jaw had tightened when he spoke the names of the crew — Steve was sure the other man knew them. But why the tension? Were all of them going to die? Or had the other man left them behind?
“Oh, not everybody. Half the crew has arrived, but Tony…” She sighed. “He’s in Vegas, something about one last hurrah.”
But soon, Steve’s big dick splitting him apart drew every thought out of his mind and became a spasm of pleasure that shook Tony’s entire body. He gave in to the shivering sensation and then he was coming all over Steve’s broad chest. Maybe he had screamed. He wasn’t sure. Cuddle time now and… wait… Steve hadn’t come. His cock was still hard as a rock inside of Tony.
“Hey, Grant…” Laura said when she got to the kitchen counter. She wasn’t dressed yet but she was already at work: she was holding up at the coffee can.
Steve flinched. Did she know? But then he realized her eyes were on Tony’s favorite mug on the counter. The other man cast a long shadow over all of them, a shadow so large it could darken the stars outside and their dreams inside.
“I said no! Humans are always the same! Always! My broodmother always said that you can’t trust bipeds! And she was right!”
“Our goal here is to find out where Carol Danvers is. Exploration is fine. Adventure is great. But every scrap of intel we have tells us the Kree are bad news. This is our chance to make some contacts and to gather information so we can avoid combat zones. It’s not just a fun afternoon at the fair.”
“I… wouldn’t call it suicide,” Tony replied. “Is it reckless? Risky? Yes, but you all knew what you were getting into. You can still walk away now.”
Natasha and Bruce kept chatting about stuff Steve had never heard about — bands, movies, an entire past Steve was locked out of — so he decided to go back to the one history book he had brought with him before his lack of knowledge became obvious. He had fallen into an uneasy sleep filled with portents — explosions, bullets, and then the cold, always the cold — when a yelp from the kitchen woke him up. He jumped off the bed, half-convinced HYDRA had attacked the facility. No. HYDRA was gone, destroyed and rooted out from the world. All Steve was doing was boxing with shadows. When he got to the kitchen, Bruce was rubbing the back of his head and frowning.
His mind was a whirlpool of questions and what-ifs. HYDRA had taken Bucky? What had they done to him? How had they found about it? Had Bucky… died and come back or never died at all? Where was he now? Had he also moved on with his life, like Peggy had?
Without thinking, he grabbed one of the soldiers and threw him against the others. The soldier’s weapon fell to the floor. This was a chance he couldn’t miss so he lunged for it and grabbed it. Tucking the weapon against his chest, he rolled behind an overturned stall.
Tony nodded at one of the door guards and the door rolled open. Beyond it, everything had changed: gone were the grimy atmosphere and the drab gray palette. Now, blinking colorful garlands crisscrossed above their heads and all the shops were open. Under floating spheres of light, the massive crowd flowed through the intricate alleys of the station talking, clicking, and garbling. A screaming slug invited everybody to Vornard’s House of Mystery and children ran between everybody’s legs and tentacles and whatever. Trembling shape-shifting blobs offered the latest news from Xandar and a small hooded figure chanted about the adventures of the Knights of Rom. Flowers covered the floor and their thick sweet smell invaded the streets, almost covering the stench of sweat and food. It was chaos and it was life and Steve would never forget it.
“Mr. Stevens, can I call you Grant?” She didn’t wait to hear his answer. “That’s bullshit. You’re not interviewing for a position in Accounting. You’re interviewing for a chance to explore new worlds and probably die trying.”
At least three of the guys had stopped to stare at Steve’s body, licking their lips and whistling. Steve had stuck out his ass then, like some sort of depraved invitation. That was when Tony, knowing he had to get away from Steve, had shuffled to a dark corner. He was a spectator and now the naked protagonists were hard at work.
Tony sat up on the bed and looked at Steve, with a small, sleepy smile. “You’re dying to go, aren’t you?”
He met Howard a week or so after moving into his new apartment. He had wanted to refuse at first, but Howard didn’t deserve that. It wasn’t his fault Steve felt like the Ghost of Christmas Past. They have talked on the phone one or two times and Howard had told him he wanted to invite everybody, to have a Howling Commandos reunion with all the survivors. Steve had refused. He wasn't ready for that. Maybe he'd never be ready for that, especially knowing that not all Howling Commandos were alive. He’d be there and wonder if it wouldn’t be better if he had died too. So he had promised instead to visit Howard’s house and talk about the old times and lie about how well he was settling into the future.
“Fine. Bruce, you go with them. Try to find samples of local… wildlife that isn’t, you know, sentient.” Tony said. “I’ll go find some spare parts for the engines and Grant can be my… my bodyguard.”
Steve looked out one of the side windows and saw Earth below, round and colorful and fragile. He put his hand against the cold glass and tried to imagine the people down there. Would he remember their faces? Would he ever come back and walk on its surface? Would he forget how the sun felt or how the full moon brightened the sky?
“So… let’s be quick. Suit has life support systems and should provide some protection against weaponry and explosions, but not enough that we should risk a battle. If we run across people who want to kill us, we run, okay? And don’t raise your hand, Grant, because yes, it has a communicating-device-cum-universal translator, courtesy of the Kree Empire.”
But the air didn’t take away the tension from his trembling body or stopped the thoughts swarming his mind. He closed his eyes and focused on the noise around the facility. Cars on the road. Birds singing in the woods. Bruce snoring on the bottom bed. Was it going to be like that on the ship? Could there be morning people and night owls in a place without days or nights? Those weren’t the only noises. In the kitchen, Natasha was rummaging through the cupboards for her favorite kind of granola. Rhodes was cursing at the coffee maker. It was time to wake up.
Tony rolled his eyes and finally looked up from his suitcase. “Fine. I called him two days ago and told him we hadn’t asked him to come because everybody knew he’d say no. I managed to imply it was because he was a coward. Time did the rest.”
Nat kept up her pace and Steve wasn’t even getting winded, but Tony kept lagging behind. He was fit, of course, but not trained for this kind of running. Another mistake they would have to fix, Steve thought. But now all he did was slow down and look over his shoulder.
After that, Clint printed out the memo and memorized each item. No matter what, he was going to bring down the law on them. Everybody on the team kept disrespecting him and shoving their crushes on his face. But he’d have the last laugh.
) and for once, Strange was laughing it off; Clint and Laura were, in turn, pestering Rhodes about the suction marks on his neck. His fingers itched for his pencils and his sketchbook. You never knew when you’d run out of time to draw the people you… loved. He stopped walking.
“We’re all gonna get killed because of you, Stark!” Nat yelled. “Because we’re not going until you jump down!”
The position highlighted every muscle in Steve’s arms and Tony wondered how much could Steve take before his body gave up on him. He’d give everything for a chance to find out how Steve looked pushed past his limits. But that’d be later if there was a ‘later’.
Bucky hadn’t spoken, for some minutes, and kept cooking. His shoulders had sagged and his jaw had tightened, but then he had laughed. “So… you’re going to be Buck Rogers.”
He handled the dishes — they should assign the chores before it got messy — in record time and then went to his room through the empty hallway. It hadn’t grown any larger and there wasn’t much to do, not yet. He glanced at the alarm clock — time to sleep, although his body was taut with tension. How could he not be like that, bouncing on his feet, when he was in space?
After a few days lost in a haze of training, packing and late dinners, Steve was hit with the reality that it was finally
Tony said and Steve’s hands loosened. It was okay. Tony had been there every step of the way reassuring Steve, his voice a low-pitched caress.
The Avengers, despite their overly-emotional nature, have proven hard to beat. Its army has been defeated through means unknown. The data is not clear yet, but it involves an electrical overload, blunt force, and being crushed. This is not a welcome change of plans. There are no resources left for another army. Even if it had resources, it would be useless unless the Avengers were no longer a factor. It cannot attack the Avengers right now. It needs more intel first.
Steve saluted the guard — they merely tilted their heads — and turned towards Nat. It wasn’t hard to find the ship, because it was the last one, as the guards have said. The engines were roaring, ready to jump. Nat was losing steam — her face was flushed, her breathing labored — but she still pushed ahead.
It was almost as if Tony was there, with his warm hands on Steve’s shoulders or his arms around his waist, making sure Steve was okay. That Steve was safe. He closed his eyes and pictured Tony’s beard scratching against his neck or burning between his thighs. Then Batroc put his hand on Steve’s nape and pushed down as his hips pushed forward. He didn’t stop until his cock hit the back of Steve’s throat and Steve’s nose got buried in Batroc’s pubic hair.
