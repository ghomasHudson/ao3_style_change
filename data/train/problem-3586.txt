“The funny thing is,” Cas continued, “I don’t even know who to ask for forgiveness, anymore… or if the weight of my sins can even truly be forgiven.”
Quaking fingers venture to touch seared and searing skin, tracing a careful perimeter of where Cas’ shirt and tie dutifully hung mere hours ago. A singed hole has temporarily taken up residence in their stead, breaching fabric and delicate skin in an almost perfect and gastly circle. Seemingly sensing the aftershocks of this gruesome evidence, the angel sheds the remaining layers in one smooth motion, as though the tattered ensemble had personally offended him. Perhaps it had. Stubborn bastard never did like being proven wrong.
Bleary-eyed and sighing, the hunter hauled himself out of bed, unsure of what to make of the solitude. Despite Cas’ inclination for beeping into the veil at the drop of a hat, Dean had to crack a mirthless  grin at the irony of being on the receiving end of his patented fun-and-run tactic for a change. Of course, this wasn’t exactly a one-night stand. It wasn’t like they’d… well. They’d shared a bed, for actual sleeping, post-kiss-of-life-and-heartfelt-declarations-of-bondedness, and while absolutely weird and intense (and well fuck, also kinda nice), it was mostly innocent. (Okay, 97% innocent, if he counted the half-conscious snuggling he begrudgingly suspected of himself.) Either way, if Dean was left feeling the same vague shame and disappointment as some sort of jilted celestial Tinder date, that was his problem, not the angel’s. Poofing out of sight and mind was business as usual for Cas, after all.
In fact, the angel grabbed at Dean’s entire face with all the subtleness of a vice, angling his head to and fro with spine-crunching intensity under his scrutiny. Dean wasn’t a Hallmark guy by any stretch of the imagination, but this was a bit rough even for him.
This train was veering off track faster than Dean could even process. He’d never fathomed the truth of it all would come out so… angrily, but he found he wasn’t entirely surprised. He and Cas weren’t exactly eligible for any prizes in stellar communication.
Dean knows he’s a dangerously eroded cliff right now, and he kind of wishes Cas would leave before the inevitable collapse.
Without as much hesitation as he probably should have felt, he reached for a few of the feathers in his orbit. He heard the sharp intake of breath from beside him, but deliberately ignored it.
“I was enjoying the head rub,” Cas quipped tiredly, while a pool of Grace eerily lit the back of his mouth, behind his teeth.
heavenly beings he may or may not have been into, who also happened to sport respectably attractive vessels with kickass wings. It could happen to
Attachments were dangerous in this line of work, after all. Or worse for unadmitted softies like Dean, they could leave you disappointed. Somehow, the assumption of Cas’ presence had slithered its way past his defenses over the years, and sprouted stubborn roots inside him. His need for Cas was inexorably woven into even breath now, stitched into the skin of his twitching fingers, twisting in his stomach whenever the angel moved, churning in his gut whenever he was gone.
With a frustrated groan, Cas regained his bare feet, the gleaming wings blooming behind him innocently like anemones in a warm current. Their staggering reach made him appear to tower over Dean, but the impression was corrected by the irritated moue of the angel’s mouth hanging all too near, almost precisely at lip-level. Dean cleared his throat, looking away while Cas’ eyes narrowed.
“I don’t understand,” Cas groused, his sharp blue eyes pinning Sam for all he was worth. “Where’s Dean?”
In the middle of said lawn stood Castiel, plain as day with coal- black wings fully extended and bathed in a brilliant column of forest-filtered morning light. And damn him, Dean stopped right on his heels, enraptured by none other than his best friend
Dean was an idiot; a needy, repressed, affection-starved idiot, and now Cas was suffering for it, spiraling towards an untimely fate Dean had no idea how to prevent.
Castiel brought said limbs up between their faces, demonstrating the severe tremor rattling his fingers at his efforts to contain the holy light. Dean immediately tried to steady them in his.
But to be honest, I am beginning to think Dean taking advantage of me isn't even the worst thing there is. The loneliness and boredom while being alone is slowly driving me crazy and I'm starting to crave human touch like I used to crave hamburgers. So whenever Dean comes downstairs to fuck, I can't help but take, take, take.
"If that's all you figured out, I'm gonna punch you," Sam said. This time it was Dean rolling his eyes.
Dean Winchester was a ladies' man and everybody knew it. A different girl every day is what he was known for -- a quickie in the janitor's closet, blowjobs behind the school... There was nothing Dean Winchester hadn't done and everybody was more than aware of it.
The next time Castiel saw Dean was later that day during his lunch period. Shoving his books into his locker, Castiel threw the door closed and was treated to the sight of Dean fucking Winchester heading right towards him. He had an embarrassed blush on his face and was looking anywhere but at him.
Castiel gave a lot of instructions, in general, seemingly liking to have the upper hand. When he was in a bad mood for example, he'd make me clean stuff around the flat; when he was particularly happy, he'd tell me to go out and do whatever I wanted. I mostly met up with Benny whenever that happened.
"Come on," Dean announced, grabbing Cas by his elbow on instinct and not letting go. He apparently knew where he was going, so Cas followed behind him more or less willingly, all the while watching the other customers curiously. Some of them seemed to be in a hurry and cursed when they saw the long line at the checkout. Others didn't seem to mind as much and took their time looking around. Cas hoped Dean and him counted to the latter ones. Cas had decided he didn't like being under pressure.
Like always, Castiel wanted to be anywhere but here this evening, preferably in bed and fast asleep, but Winchester's parties were compulsory for all employees and since he was one of the most renown inventors the corporation employed, Castiel's absence would surely be noticed. Additionally, his boss, John Winchester, would always introduce him to new people throughout the night, showing him off to whoever was willing to listen. Castiel thought it was stupid but he couldn't change it either.
Afterwards, Dean took away the plates while I wiped the table clean. I was leaning over it when Dean passed behind me and before I realized what was happening, he'd grabbed my ass and pushed me against the table, making me bend over in surprise. I could feel his hard dick pressing against my ass through our pants.
"Dean--" I started, and that's when he hit my prostate again, making me gasp, and I came untouched all over my stomach.
"My name's Castiel, by the way," the boy introduces himself when they're done picking up books, and Dean looks up for a second despite himself. His gaze gets caught by bright blue eyes.
It was different than last time - which didn't mean that it was worse. It was slower, for one, and more sensual. There was none of the drunken desperation from Saturday, none of the sloppiness; it was simply nice.
They walked to the store. It wasn't all that far away after all, and Sam had taken Baby to check out the hospital -- which, honestly, Dean couldn't even mope about because it meant he'd gotten out of researching again. So walking it was.
Benny's party was huge. Not that Benny's parties usually weren't rather large, but this one was just... huge. Dean wasn't sure whether he had ever seen so many people in one place.
Dean nodded and smirked stupidly, a little spaced out, but Castiel knew that was his own fault. "Let's go," Castiel said and grabbed Dean's hand, pulling him with him. Dean followed willingly.
As soon as Mom was back, things returned to normal; or so I'd hoped... They didn't. Because if I genuinely believed Dean was gonna stop when my mother came home, I was proved wrong quickly.
So, yes, Dean held back for some reason, and that reason, as they found out later, had indeed been Castiel Novak from the start.
Dean forced himself to shake off the thought. Why would he even want Castiel to talk to him? He didn't like him!
Inside, it was quiet. Somewhere in the back of his head Cas knew that was what libraries were supposed to be, but the silence in combination with the relative emptiness of the building had a somewhat eerie effect. Cas didn't even notice though. Fear was an emotion he did not feel.
"Oh, hello Dean," Castiel greeted, impassive as ever, as if he didn't jack off in front of me the last time I saw him. I blushed furiously when I looked at him but didn't want Benny to notice, so I muttered a quick, "Hey Cas," and otherwise ignored him.
"Like I said, I'm okay with that," Castiel repeated, squinting a little at Dean's incredulous stare. "You being a single-father and having been with a woman doesn't change how I look at you, you don't have to worry. You're still the same Dean."
The last flickering hopes of Dean Winchester being straight were soon destroyed however, leaving them no choice but to accept it.
And still the obvious was ignored. 'Dean Winchester isn't gay, he's straight enough to let a guy blow him and not be a fag.' 'Dean Winchester is just done fucking all the girls at this school, so he's doing it with guys now. A hole is a hole, nothing gay about it.' And the most surprising statement, 'Dean Winchester is simply lying,' which wasn't something anyone had ever dared to even
Firstly, he'd woken up half an hour later than he was supposed to, making him late to his first class of the day -namely History- and had gotten a lecture from his teacher in front of the whole class. Then he'd realized he hadn't packed his lunch, had missed the meeting with the chess club during the break, spilled soda all over Kevin's stuff, and ran into a glass door when he wasn't looking. Also, he hadn't seen Dean all day, which significantly worsened his mood even more since his long-term crush and almost-friend-more-like-classmate was usually the only one capable to cheer him up on a bad day.
"Dean," Castiel repeats once again, but this time quieter, so it's almost a whisper. He's evidently opened the door and is shocked at the picture Dean is making, not that it comes as a surprise. "What the hell happened?" he asks carefully.
On the other hand, though, Dean's heart sank. He had wanted Jack to dislike Castiel, so he could use that as an excuse not to go on another date with Castiel. Now that Jack liked him, he had to actually tell Castiel that he couldn't date him because he was straight. And he couldn't bear the thought of hurting him. Castiel was so kind-hearted and just... so absolutely awesome. He’d have to make it right soon.
Castiel gulped down what was still in his mouth. "I-- I missed lunch," he then stuttered, a pathetic attempt to justify himself, but all Dean did was laugh.
"M-me?" Castiel stutters. His eyes are as big as Dean's ever seen them. "Really? I- I'm your gay awakening?"
Dean turns towards Castiel as well, heart stuttering behind his rips as they both wait for his decision.
More blood is spilling, red color against white skin and I have the weird urge kiss it. I don't though. Instead, I add another cut on Dean's shoulder and hear him humming contently. He pulls me closer eagerly and bares his throat, pointing a finger to it, offering.
for making a mess on the floor -hah!-, Dean was looking down at the shards with pursed lips and a somewhat angry expression in his eyes. He quickly caught himself though, glancing up at Castiel with a forced smile.
I got up quickly, taking a shower without asking Castiel, and when I came out of the bathroom again, I found him making breakfast in the kitchen. We ate in silence.
"Hey, dude, you okay?" the man from beside him asked curiously and Cas turned his head towards him. He was still standing where he stood before, his book open in his hands, but he was now staring at Cas with raised eyebrows. It was obvious he was talking to him.
"Because my parents know you, Dean," he responded, genuine regret in his voice. "It would be weird to just... show up together all of a sudden."
The night passed in a blur for Castiel. He didn't sleep, not that he would have been able to even if he wanted to. To be completely honest, Castiel was scared shitless. Trapped in a world where everything appeared to be the same but nothing was as it seemed, Castiel was left alone with his thoughts and it was driving him mad.
"You do feel though, right? Like, in general?" Dean continued, genuinely interested, and Cas glanced up at him, nodding thoughtfully.
And Cas did. He followed Sam past the cheery librarian, who waved at both of them again, and outside into a black muscle car. It was still raining, but not as heavily as before.
"You know what I'm gonna do to you first?" Castiel asked conversationally, letting go of Dean's arms and looking down on him predatorily. Dean was staring up at him with a blank look in his eyes, eyelids heavy, and his lips were parted slightly. The sight made Castiel's dick throb painfully. "I'm gonna fuck your mouth and then come all over your face," Castiel decided and got up on his knees, crawling forwards and stopping right above Dean's head. Gripping his dick and stroking it one or two times, he pressed his cock against Dean's lips.
"Another 10,000 were just replaced," he told his boss. "So, adding the ones we've already replaced over the last few weeks, we have a total of 250,000."
Since he had no choice but to stagger backwards at the wings’ behest, he fanned his fingers over his unrelenting feathery prison.
in order to expose the soul. For humans, it’s often in the form of physical and emotional vulnerability. So violence, or alternately closeness, depending on the case.”
… why Dean could even see the enormous appendages at all when they were usually relegated to the realm of Big
He seemed so frankly pleased by this small development that Dean was thrown for a loop, somewhere out near Saturn.
He circled Cas, as the wings gently swayed from their fullest extension, unable to tear his gaze from the lustrous wall of feathers.
“I remind you that there is no force in the universe so far that has kept me from loving you; Not Heaven, not Hell, not God, not even
After a fruitless half hour of nervous meandering through the Bunker, Dean finally found Cas outside on the roof.
As a result, in the cloying dimness of his grimy motel room in the middle of nowhere, Dean was forced to reckon with a rare bout of vulnerability. Tonight, he was sick of fate, fighting and faking a determination he didn’t feel. He was bitter and spent, empty and desperate for a meaning to all of it that he knew he wouldn’t find.
“Well,” Cas mused gently after a time, as he pressed their foreheads together “If I am formally allowed to take advantage of you now, we can make up for lost time whenever you’d like.”
- not two - and for a moment, Dean wonders if someone has spiked his coffee. Dean - god help him, is just a mortal man, and he's barely grown accustomed to processing two of those gut-punching things. This dramatic addition seems completely unfair. Castiel now looks the part of the stained-glass Demi-god most humans assume angels are; a vision from mythological text whose presence Dean is definitely unworthy of. It’s like he’s back in that infamous barn all over again; with considerably less stabbing.
It didn't help that he could feel Cas’ warm, trembling breath skirt across his denim-clad lap, smell the iron-tainted air encapsulating them…. And in fact, now that his brain finally bothered to override his less decorous bodily responses, he realized that Cas having any smell at all, or breath beyond his cursory imitations for that matter, was totally,
“So basically you’re saying make a guy swoon, and boom, soul unlocked, spell broken? Like I said, sounds a bit Snow White to me...”
“I'm sorry, Dean," the angel soothed, brushing his wide palms over Dean's shoulders. "I was worried about you too."
He howled the angel’s name into the screeching inferno that Cas had become, and somehow, the chaos yielded just enough for Dean to hear his reply.
“Dean. Come in,” he greeted warmly. His voice still sounded a bit rougher than usual, and that was saying something. Dude sounded like he gargled shrapnel on the regular (not that Dean minded).
The curve was steep, but Dean had been learning how to pick his battles. More importantly, he was learning that here, he didn’t always have to fight.
If Bobby’s description had been any indication, Dean had expected his ribs being cracked apart beneath him, his shuddering insides to be twisted at the blistering light thrust upon them. He’d expected to be devoured by Cas’ terrible aura while his heart was being sucked into a vacuum, being swallowed by a black hole personified. In short, he’d expected the usual horrors which were wrought unto mortal flesh by the awesome, soul-pulverizing effects of Heavenly power. He’d been exposed to the deafening, otherworldly scald of it many times before, starting all the way back when Cas only knew how to speak “ear-shatteringese” and had seemingly attempted to scour a greeting directly onto his brain in that post-resurrection gas station.
Sam huffs out a laugh and watches his older brother stop mid-stride. Dean veers around and surprisingly, there's not even the slightest sniff of indignation in his features, as Sam had expected. In fact, Dean's eyes seem to be dancing - like actually
He finds it easier than he’d imagined to let himself come apart this way, with Cas panting a hungry rhythm against his heat-flecked chest, where Dean can tether his fingers into dark, debauched hair, press his mouth to the throbbing expanses of warm skin and follow the sinuous ebb and flow of naked hips beneath his fingers.
have felt a twinge of misty-eyed pride about how Sam had been stealing his thunder in that regard lately, were the change not so drastic. In fact, despite how deliriously happy Dean had been to see him again on that fateful day in Lisa’s neighbour’s garage, this was only one of the many things that he’d come to realized had changed in Sam’s usually predictable personality. Sam had been different since his return from Hell, period. Of course, spending the equivalent of years in the fiery pits of bloody absolution wasn't exactly a recipe for mental health, but it was somehow more than that. Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on the root cause (and he was not getting
the flames of Hell trying to rip it from my grasp, well… it is indescribable even in all the languages I know. To feel it resonating within me, to hold it so close again was wondrous. That’s why. You probably felt my joy at the experience of it, which might have spared you from the less pleasant effects of the transfer."
The angel’s growl carried an intoxicating touch of holy wrath in its gravel tones, but even so, Dean felt his insides coil in anticipation for a fight. One he’d started, again.
Mercifully, Cas seemed unaffected by Dean’s accidental visit to Euphemism Land and merely returned an uneasy look.
Like so many other emotionally-charged issues, these were just more gaping potholes he’d have to detour and leave in the rear-view. It didn’t make it any easier to digest though, because as loath as he was to admit it out loud, their previous exchange had felt like a hell of a lot more than a last-ditch exercise of spiritual mechanics. And surprisingly, he’d felt pretty damned okay with that. What really rankled him was the idea that this whole thing might just have felt like celestial indigestion to Cas. It was a distinct possibility; angels were pretty robotic, even when putzing around with the very cores of people. But this was
There was a longing to Castiel’s voice that spilled warmth into Dean’s choked chest, and sent his adrenaline-polluted pulse simmering.
Though his Grace was impaired, the angel had that twitchy look about him that usually signified Dean would soon be talking to empty air, so he seized the rare occasion to press on.
Dean simply leans in, gently cupping Cas’ face like he always seems compelled to with the angel, and Cas kisses him right back, easy as anything.
“That poor woman must have been terrified.” the angel finally muttered. His eyes were glazed over, likely in somber visitation of those terrible events from the days prior. This was the first indication that Cas hadn’t quite recovered. His fingers still shook, and his facade had easily cracked.
Dean bitterly resisted the urge to swipe his fingers over the handprint seared into his shoulder. It was time to stop blubbering, and just accept that despite all they’d been through together, perhaps he was just a utilitarian convenience to Cas. Because Angel Things superseded Dean and his pouting every time.
“It’s a sin to lie, Dean. I know you love the coat as much as I do,” he says between a yawn or two. It’s still disconcerting sometimes to see him do that, but for now, Dean tries to forget how much the Earth has tarnished him - how much Dean himself has - and smiles, instead.
choke - but when Charlie brandished a small pink bag with a silver zipper, he immediately reconsidered.
It’s barely satisfactory, but Dean nods all the same as one of the wings gently wraps around his shoulder in an impossibly soft caress. He’s sure they’ll butt heads about this again, but for now, he’s sick of arguing.
Cas actually squirms a tiny bit, and while it might be objectively the most adorable thing Dean has ever seen, he releases the wing and is now sort of worried all over again.
There was no mistaking it: Cas was ecstatic. His blue eyes flickered from Dean to the sky with a kind of unrestrained joy Dean had rarely seen on him. It was like a revelation.
It’s not even anything dramatic, like the hundreds of scenarios he’d pictured over the years in his front-row frustration. Sam is almost disappointed.
He seemed so genuinely pleased that Dean couldn’t help grinning. Leave it to Cas to be concerned about performance issues during a near-death experience.
Cas than riding him. Neither implication entirely displeased him, but Dean’s eyes remained resolutely cemented shut.
There was hope brimming in Cas’ thoughtful gaze as it rose to meet Dean’s, and he decided it was the best look to ever have graced Cas’ features.
“I would rip you apart,” he wheezed and Dean frowned into the increasing brilliance. Cas unfortunately had a point: if someone was going to pull a Kali-Ma on your soul, better that they have a steady hand and not turn your insides to pudding.
“I can’t go anywhere while my wings remain on this plane.” justified that sumptuous voice from the shadows just beyond. Each word blew whispered promises across his neck, tantalizingly close.
“This is comfortable. Thank you, Dean,” Cas says in his usual deadpan, from the nook of Dean’s lap. He looks for all the world like he’s always belonged there, and this both awes and frustrates Dean, for the decade’s worth of wasted potential. He watches, mesmerized as Cas sighs deeply; his head stretching back, muscles uncoiling languidly against the rickety frame of couch and legs. The angel has drawn himself into a rather casual picture of exhaustion, which is impressive for a creature so covered in his own gore.
“I don’t see why you insist on calling them that,” the angel griped. “Chicken wings would hardly provide enough lift to sustain us both aloft.”
“That’s it?” Dean balked in disbelief. His own body confirmed as much: he felt like he’d been dunked in a cold lake; undignified gasping included.
Or at least, that was the plan before a cloak of darkness restrained his retreat. Long midnight feathers encased him, and forced him back towards the angel. He swore he could almost
The angel’s eyes were eyes slanted in silent contemplation, likely boring holes into the hideous carpet by now.
their victims.) He did a quick sweep of the room, which revealed no such exposed Angel of the Lord anywhere. Dean shook himself from his Inappropriate Morning Thoughts™ and attempted instead to find relief in the clothing totem’s conspicuous absence of pants.
After a cursory shower, he pulled on some grey joggers and a clean(ish) tank which he left half-hiked up to expose a rather nasty gash along his left obliques, and half-heartedly pulled out the first aid kit. He took another swallow of the rotgut before proceeding with what would likely be a long session of stitching and bandaging. He didn’t quite know where to start, tentatively poking at the largest wound in deflated irritation. Go big or go home. He sterilized the needle and went to town. He was harpooning himself with the third stitch when a bizarrely familiar sound interrupted the hiss sliding through his teeth. The soft and unmistakable ruffling sound, which Dean had
On cue, Dean feels his heart give a guilty clench at constantly causing strife for his little family. It’s the first thing he’s felt in hours if he’s honest, but he convinces himself he doesn’t care. He can’t right now, or it might all just drown him. It had all come so dangerously close this time, even on terms they’re used to. Figures that after defeating most cosmic entities in the universe, a particularly motivated nest of ordinary, run-of-the-mill vamps would almost do him in.
Cas nodded and shuffled to extricate himself from the scratchy motel blanket. He scooted to the edge of the bed nearer to where Dean stood, rooted in molasses. It was still strange to see the angel sans tie or coat, not to mention without socks, but it was a much better look than the one in which Dean had been forced to leave him.
“And uh, hey,” Dean fumbled as his butt hit the counter, “maybe someday you can gimme one of yours instead huh? If that’s a thing or -”
“Takes one to know one, I suppose,” Cas finally says in his usual deadpan, betrayed only by the tiniest grin. “But thank you, Dean.”
Dean froze as his infuriatingly perceptive sibling stared holes into him from below a raised brow. The toast impudently popped in the heavy silence.
worry. But I trust you, too. I trust you to come back to me, as long as you are able, just as I will always return to you.”
The harsh shafts of daylight streaming in from paper-thin curtains illuminated a mess the likes of which no meager deposit could hope to recover. Broken furniture, torn carpets, shattered lamps… it was almost an improvement to the unforgivable chintz of the place, but he wasn’t sure the owner would appreciate his decorating flair (which he found himself dubbing “Angelic Tornado Chic”). In fact, the only thing which had been spared aside from the bed, was a single wooden chair which seemed at least 10 years older than the Impala. It stood starkly in the middle of the room, untouched in its arresting ugliness like the drabbest eye of a hurricane. It was draped with an impeccably-folded swatch of beige.
Before he could even put the spatula down, Dean found himself crowded by piercing blues and a scowl, right up in his bacon-filled grill.
meant. He was angry after all, but not dead from the waist down. Right? Right. Totally normal reaction.
“Sam says I’ve been coddling you,” Dean says suddenly. The confession tumbles out of him over the lip of his cup.
Of course, at first, as molten fountains of Grace had begun pouring from the angel in great arching surges, scorching Dean in the process, the ‘kiss’ was far from the stuff of fantasies. He’d wanted to scream in fact (and not in a good way), but found himself almost magnetically sealed to Cas while angel mojo blindingly exploded all around. It branded white hot pain over all his other senses, while their lips remained the only thing anchoring them to their physical bodies. Insofar as all the ways he’d admittedly pictured this happening in the deepest, darkest corners of his brain, this version was definitely the most removed from his sexy (if unoriginal) backseat-of-the-Impala scenarios, and frankly, eons more terrifying. Dean was no Casanova, but having his face melted wasn’t exactly his idea of a hot date.
This time, Cas turned fully and regarded him with such a familiar, squinted expression of confusion that Dean couldn’t help but feel fond despite his trepidation.
A heavy pause hangs between them as the halved seraph drags his leaden feet to a halt. He turns to face him, features haggard with fatigue, but eyes bright. They peer undaunted at the hunter almost in challenge. “It’s just… slower. I’m fine.”
There was a long pause before Cas seemed to steel himself, and Dean found that his nerves were humming right alongside him.
Dean grumpily snags his coffee cups and hesitates under his brother’s cheeky surveillance, not wanting to give him the satisfaction. He doesn't even extend him the customary
In fact, despite being covered in monstrous bodily fluids of all kinds, Dean found he was outright smiling into the polyester.
“Cas?” he prompted again, after several tense moments. His dark head wobbled uselessly at Dean’s nudge.
“I guess you’ll be going back upstairs to the big Chicken Coop in the sky now,” Dean accused, turning away. “Love ‘em and leave ‘em, I guess...”
Man-crush aside, Dean was dismayed at what he saw. Cas seemed drained beyond all measure. The bags under his vessel’s eyes were so dark and cavernous they almost seemed contused, while the thin lines pulling at his expression were engraved so deep that the gravity of his face had increased tenfold. The heat lighting his core had all but evaporated, regardless of
Dean hoped his jokingly-cocked eyebrow would successfully convey that he was kidding around my guy, my good buddy, and that hey, we’re all super-cool here with platonic kissing, bro-migo. Fortunately, Cas disarmed those frail mechanisms with a dose of his patented earnestness.
. And damn his faulty voice box, Dean couldn’t restrain the girly gasp that escaped him at the sight.
brethren? It’s a complicated spell as not many are left. I’ll have to go through the whole roster, and I’d rather see if we could avoid that  because it may take hours. Dean might not have that long.”
“They seal their soul deals with kisses for a reason. I thought that, given the uh, circumstances, borrowing their technique couldn’t hurt.”
“My brothers can be staggeringly powerful, though quite unimaginative,” he confirmed quietly, before letting his hands drop altogether. “The spell’s point is to bring its targets together, or else. Once that happens, its duty ends. In any case, the dangerous effects should be subdued for now, at least until the spell wears off entirely.”
In fact it’s kind of a point of sarcastic pride sometimes, that he feels like the owner of Team Free Will’s sole brain cell.
I’m beggin’ you Cas, cuz I’ll never fucking forgive you if this is how we end because I - there’s so much I - Just… please -
The offer was so unexpected that Dean froze for a few moments. There were layers to it he didn’t quite know what to do with, and honestly didn’t care to unravel just then. The only thought coming in crystal clear was how unusually vulnerable Cas looked in that moment, like it had taken everything out of him to ask… Like perhaps Dean had been correct to worry a little after all.
Castiel throws himself onto the bed and buries his face in the pillow. He wishes it still smelled like Dean. With everything going on in the last week, they hadn't spent any time down here. Castiel realizes mutedly that the sex wasn't that important to him anymore. Sure, Dean's attractive as hell, and Castiel wants to bend him over any available surface at least 98% of the time, but if Dean declared that they couldn't have sex ever again, Castiel would be okay with that.
It had when he thought it but now... Dean lapped at the bite with his rough yet soft wet tongue and Castiel couldn't help but whimper. "What... smell?" It was all he managed to get out but Dean seemed to understand. "Pheremones. It's a power I have. What's it smell like, by the way? It's different for everybody." Suddenly Castiel was hauled up and he realized he was laying down part of his body on the bed, and his upper body resting across Dean's chest, his face buried into Dean's shoulder.
They walked through the crowded city streets, Castiel had no idea where they were going. Within ten minutes he'd been flashed four different times, and Dean had been assaulted by a young woman who attempted to shove her tongue down his throat. He pushed her away gently and gave her a debonair smile which made her giggle and then she was gone. He gave Castiel a sideways glance as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grimacing slightly. They made their way through the crowded city slowly, but Castiel was enjoying every moment of it. All the colored lights, and the hundreds of smiling faces, Dean's hand in his, their finger's entwined. It was the happiest Castiel had felt... ever. His entire system was reeling and he could hardly stand it. The smile on his face would just not go away.
"Well, it's settled then. Sam can track the number. If it is John, then we'll deal with that. If it wasn't, we'll contact the police and report a break-in. Does that work for everyone?"
Dean grinned. "Something like that. Come on. I'll get the lights." Dean walked across the room and flipped the switch, dousing the room in darkness. He could see perfectly fine. That's why he had nearly forgotten to turn on the light earlier when he brought Cas in here. Cas was standing by the bed and Dean could hear his heart beating loudly.
but I wanna try it. Like, full-time, 24-hour sub, like how you were with the other ones. I wanna see what it's like."
He just flies by the seat of his pants, trying to think of threatening things, but it enrages her, and her face changes into a Vulcan mask or anger.
Cas bats Dean's hand away from his dick where Dean had been trying to jerk himself. "Only my cock. Cum just from me fucking you. I know you can, sweet boy. You can cum for me again."
"Alright, if you would, just take a seat in this room here," She gestures at the open door across from her, and Dean nods, "I forgot to grab some of your paperwork. I'll be right back. While you're waiting, if you'd change into the gown that's on the table, that'd be great."
Dean grimaces. That meant he knew where Cas was going and came here to... He was going to hurt Cas. As Dean realizes that, Cas steps around Dean and in front of Sam, creating a wall between them and Dad.
"Listen, Cas, there's something we need to talk about..." He trails off, and Castiel tries not to let himself worry about what might be coming next. He mentioned his father earlier but that doesn't give him any clues. Dean takes a huge breath and closes his eyes, flinching at a high-pitched squeal from a child in the next booth over. "Fuck... I'm not good at this. Talking about this stuff."
with a sex-induced deepness, and Dean obeys, freezing as Cas lets go of his hips. Two thumbs plunge into his hole and tug on his rim, opening him up to Cas's mouth, and Dean groans at the drag of stubble on his cheeks, and then his heart stops. Cas thrusts his tongue into Dean's hole in between his thumbs and curls it upward, teasing at his rim, and Dean's mouth drops open, uncaring of how he looks.
"Where are we?" Castiel asked, looking out the window blearily, rubbing his eyes. "Williamson County, Illinois." This gave Castiel a small amount of shock. "You drove all the way through Tennessee?" Dean nodded and steered the Impala off an exit and down a small road that looked rather run down. Weeds were growing high alongside the highway and everything was brown. It was still dark outside. The sun was just beginning to rise. Maybe. A look at Dean's phone confirmed the time as a little past six thirty in the morning. Dean had driven all the way through the night. "Dean, you're going to exhaust yourself like this. Don't vampires have to sleep?" Dean gave him a half smile. "Sort of, yeah. I'm gonna crash soon, that's part of the reason I had to wake you up. We'll be getting a room here in a minute."
Castiel gulps a cup of water, wincing as the ice-cold liquid hits his empty stomach. He needs to make lunch. Time on the treadmill always helps him clear his mind. He feels better about the whole regression conundrum.
They make plans to meet later next week. Castiel will have to run it across Dean to get his schedule, but it's a tentative plan anyway. They talk about the club and some random things for the next few minutes before Castiel decides to try to work on his article again; he feels better now. "Thank you, Cain."
"A couple of hours. Did you sleep well?" Dean stands and makes his way over to Castiel. Without preamble, he hops up onto Castiel's legs. In his lap, he wraps himself around Castiel, burrowing his face into the space between his neck and shoulder. Castiel wraps his arms around Dean and murmurs, "You seem to have an affinity for my lap."
"Am I supposed to submit to you? Is that what this is?" Dean looked a little miffed at the idea and stood, running his hands through his hair. "No, Cas. Damn, this is complicated. It's not about that. It's about... Fuck. You belonging to me, in a sense. It means no one else can touch you. You're basically wearing a sign that says 'Dean's.' You're protected. Dammit, I just- Cas, you wanna be my mate?" He just suddenly threw his arms out and exclaimed a little too loudly and Castiel suddenly knew he was nervous that he was going to be rejected, as ludicrous as that was. Dean was a very powerful vampire, who would've known he would be insecure?
well. He knows they rushed into this, all his experience is telling him that, but everything feels so right with Dean. They have a connection he can't deny, a unique bond. It's not something he's ever experienced before, with anyone. Not even his first Dominant, or any of his subs. It's a relationship that has been specifically for Dean Winchester, and Dean only.
Dean shuffled awkwardly and ran a hand through his already tousled hair. "Listen, I- Just- Oh, for fuck's sake. I-" A knock sounded on the door and Dean cursed colorfully before going to the door. "Yeah?" A rough male voice with a beautiful deep Cajun accent sounded from the other side. "You gonna let me in, brother?" Dean chuckled and pulled the door open revealing a tall man with a scruffy but well-trimmed beard sporting a black Stetson Cambridge cap. "Hey, Benny."
The temperature didn't much bother him anymore, he was nearly always comfortable, lucky for him. You could always tell the locals from the tourists by how red their faces were, as well as the clothes they wore. Tourists often wore revealing clothing in an ineffective attempt to ease themselves of the heat. He breathed the scent of the French Quarter in deeply, reveling in it momentarily. It was one of the only small pleasures he allowed himself or was allowed rather. Ever since his mother Naomi had remarried his step-father Zachariah his pleasures and interests had become of no importance. Only the mission, only the will and word of God mattered to his step-father and mother. His wants or needs were of little concern, they did not stand up to the importance of spreading the word of God.
Another thing about today is that it's a special day. One several months in the making. September eighteenth. Cas' quote-unquote "birthday". The day that they actually met. He pulled Dean from Hell, but that September day in that dusty barn. That was the day Dean set down on a road that's twisted and turned a lot further than he ever thought it'd go.
like this. Felt so hollow inside and yet stuffed to the brim with pain and longing. Cain strokes the back of Castiel’s neck, and he doesn’t stop until his sobs have quieted. They stand there longer still as Castiel tries to get ahold of himself. It’s been a long time since he’s allowed himself to be so vulnerable in front of Cain. But Cain is one of his oldest friends and the one who would understand the most what Castiel is going through. What he’s put himself through.
I suck at fight scenes, I'm sorry I made you read that. We're going to get more of just how dark and bad Dean went in the next chapter. Sorry, it's short. I feel like crap today. Comment and tell me what you think guys. Love it? Hate it? Wanna scream at me? Do it, lol.  Oh, and guys... I have a confession to make. I feel like you're gonna hate me. I won't be able to update for an indeterminate amount of time, I'm not sure how long. BUT I WILL UPDATE AGAIN. I'm NOT abandoning this, I will finish it, I'm just moving and there's a shiz ton of stuff going on personally right now, and it's just not possible. But as soon as I can physically update, I promise I will spam you guys with chapters. It might take a while, it might be as little as a week, I have no idea, that's how much things are in the air right now. *Eff my life* But I hope you guys bookmark, or subscribe or whatever that way when I do start posting again you will be able to read it. I absolutely adore all of your comments, and those of you that are reading the fic, it just makes my day better seeing you guys actually enjoy it. Much love from me to you guys and I will be back. <3  Don't give up on me.
Cas is packing. His cock is thick and heavy, hanging between his legs. Strong, tan runner's legs, Dean notices. Cas is hairless below the waist, and Dean can't help but find it hot. His eyes travel from Cas's calves up to his eyes slowly only to find Cas staring at him.
It's shorter than I wanted it to be, but I've got more coming. I'm chock full of ideas just short on time. Life happened. More soon, hopefully. Let me know what you guys think. Feedback brings me life. What do you guys want from this? TELL ME. :) I'd like to hear your ideas about where you think it's going too. Oh, also, I've got another story that I've written on my laptop. It started as a comfort fic for myself but quickly grew to over 100,000 words in like four days, no joke. It's Destiel, and Castiel/Dean/and a person I totally made up, not an actual character from the show, as well as Sabriel. Is that something you guys would be interested in reading? It's a lot of plot, and some awesome porn if I do say so myself *blushes*. Lemme know?
B: Fix it. You know what you're doing is stupid. Don't do that to that boy. He deserves better than that.
Castiel chuckles, "Nothing could scare me away from Dean, Sam. Not even your father. He's nothing compared to your brother," Castiel looks down at Dean, who's curled up into a small ball against Castiel's side, burying his face into Castiel's arms, "He's everything."
Cas's hand curiously runs over his bare balls, rolling them with his gentle hand. He runs a finger up over Dean's dick with a light touch, and Dean shudders, gasping. He wants so much more than this. "So desperate. So entirely responsive. It's refreshing."
"Uh." The sheepish grin is back and Dean can't help but feel happy. His brother's back. "Well, I was kind of hoping I could stay with you? Or if you were too busy with Cas and everything I was gonna ask Benny!"
"No, no, no. I mean, uh... Like, for uh, antidepressants or something." He whispers, looking down at his hands in his lap. He picks at the skin around his thumb, nervously trying to scrub away the rough edge. A finger touches his chin and draws his face up until he's angled up to Cas's face, but Dean looks off to the side. He doesn't want to see judgment now in those blue eyes that are always so kind to him.
right now. The thought makes his heart flutter and race beneath his sternum so fast he thinks he might faint.
, that was a lie. He did. He was doing this to indulge his boyfriend. Cas was surprisingly picky about the clothes he wore now that he was human, a far cry from the stoic angel who consistently wore the same outfit for years. An outfit he was partial to, it seemed. Cas had been devastated when his trench coat had gotten shredded in a Wendigo attack. And so, that's why Dean is taking Cas to the mall to find a new one. Cas is riding shotgun in Baby with Dean manning the wheel, and Sam's back at the bunker researching a vamp case since he didn't want to get sucked into the teenage whirlwind that was the mall at this time of year.
"Yeah, but it's true, isn't it?" A faint smile came over Cas's face. "Yes. It is. Is that okay? I mean... I hope you're not homophobic?"
surely-to-God leaving a red handprint on his ass cheek. It stings like crazy, but he relishes it. Fuck, he never thought he'd like spanking so much. He whines and looks back at Cas, who has his Dom-brow going on, and Dean gulps.
"You're not messed up. You've been dealt a bad hand, is all. I promise I'll be here every step of the way to get you healthy and to where you want to be. If you want me to be, that is."
Some shout-outs right now, y'all, because all you guys give me life and keep me writing when I need to be.
“You look really cute in my sweater,” Dean says. He pulls on the ragged end of the sleeve and Cas leans against him easily. Dean wraps his arms around him and breathes him in. They’ve been making pasta in Dean’s kitchen for the last hour, and the scent is heavenly. Roma tomatoes, bacon, and a ranch sauce that Cas made have all been prepped to get thrown into the cheesy noodles. The soft yellow glow of the overhead light bathes the kitchen in a cozy feeling. Holding his boyfriend, his love, here in the center of his tiny house, gives him butterflies. Everything’s coming together, it seems, and it’s like Dean can feel something within himself healing, suturing itself back together. Cas’s stomach rumbles, interrupting the quiet ambiance, and Dean chuckles. He leans away a little and Cas kisses him on the nose.
I hope you liked it, and as always, if you feel moved please feel free to leave a comment. I adore hearing from you guys. :D
"You dropped by. You can leave now. Maybe we can all catch up in the morning when you're sober." Cas's jaw is set, and Dean swears he can feel the tension radiating off him like actual sparks of electricity bouncing into the air.
"Is there going to be a problem here, John?" Cas says, his voice smooth and silky. He sounds dangerous. Any other time it would've been a huge turn-on.
. Castiel tries to reassure Dean, tries to tell him it's okay and that he can talk to Castiel in not so many words.
"There are classics in every genre of music," Castiel argues, turning to stir his sauce again and throw more salt into the boiling noodles. "Yeah, but when you say classics, man, you gotta be talking about rock music. That's where it's at."
Dean glances around the room, but nobody is paying attention to them. He looks back at Cas and nods slowly. Cas grins and leans back, looking at ease, leaning against the back of the booth. "Good. I like seeing you like that. You're all flushed and squirming, and we've barely touched. It's intriguing."
"You beg so beautifully for me, baby boy. Good job." Castiel pulls the plug out of Dean, takes a moment to turn it off, and abandons it on the floor.
"I... Well, I'm a mechanic." Dean rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. Cas tilts his head to the side again, and his eyes are kind of squinty. Dean feels like he's under a microscope. Like this guy can see into his soul or something. "Are you embarrassed by your occupation?"
Dean doesn't even bother going home. He just drives straight to work. Dean took a shower at Cas's, and he's got his clothes in the trunk. Today's going to be
“Hmm,” Dean wraps his arm around Cas’s side, “Now that’s an idea. Maybe you could be the bossy bottom today.”
The thick southern accent makes him think of Benny and he smiles as he grabs a grocery bag from the pile that Cas has amassed. He loads fifteen in the bag, the whole time the woman is talking - "And well, I just don't don't know what I'm going to do with him, he's such a rascal." She shakes her head in exasperation then smiles up at him, her false teeth nicotine yellowed, but a kind smile nonetheless. "Thanks for all the help, and I'll be seeing y'all later."
He points to a flower pattern on the inside of the lapel and Dean can't argue with that one. They keep trying more on, but every one of them is a no go. Dean is about to give up when he decides to walk back to the beginning of the aisle just in case he missed something.
he thinks. Castiel gently pulls Dean’s grip apart and turns to face scared eyes. He looks into their green depths and nods. “Yes, Dean. I love you.”
Deciding in a moment's notice to do something he swore he'd never do, he picks up the phone and calls Cain, who picks up on the first ring.
Cas leans back and lays his arm out for Dean to use as a pillow. Dean happily scoots forward, the angle a lot less awkward now. Fingers skimming over his waist makes him gasp. He places reverent kisses against Cas's throat, enjoying the feel of his stubble scraping against his cheek. Dean shivers as Cas's hangs glide over his erection through his boxers.
He nods and Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. "Nobody did this to us, sir. It was him. Winchester apparently tagged us tailing him and caught on. He surprised us and managed to drag Gadreel out of the car. We didn't tell him who we were or who we worked for, but he was rather determined." Alfie winces and rubs his ribs. His face is bruised, and his nose looks broken. Gadreel's not much better. His shoulder looks dislocated which was going to be a bitch to get back in place. Castiel knows from experience that the injury has to hurt terribly. They both have blood covering their street clothes and there is a large tear in Gadreel's shirt, going across his stomach. Castiel finds this amusing and is having a hard time restraining his laughter despite it being two of his own injured. "When was this?"
He whimpered, "Alpha." The rumbling growl in his ear went straight to Castiel's penis, and now he was achingly hard, rutting against Dean's thigh without even thinking about it. "Again, Omega."
"Ah. No. Not exactly. Probably a solid 3.5." He says quietly but with a hint of pride. It hadn't been all that long ago that he'd come out as bisexual to Sam. Not that he'd been that surprised because -
He's not entirely sure where that came from, but it felt right to ask, and apparently, it was the right thing to say because Cas groans and says, "Fuck. Yes. Suck me, baby boy. I'm going to have you quivering with need by the time I'm done with you."
Yeah, right. Sure, whatever. If Cas wants to try to lie about liking his house, that's fine. The man has a lot of money. Dean's house is a shack compared to his. Dean just stands awkwardly, unsure of what he's doing here or what he wants.
"You always think the worst of yourself, Dean." Cas presses his left hand to Dean's cheek, and Dean lays his palm against Cas's hands, pressing it into his cheek and leaning into the warmth of it, his eyes fluttering closed. "I know. I'm sorry."
Rich, juicy strawberries so sweet and ripe that the juice dribbles down your chin when you bite into one. Whoa. Holy shit. He hadn't been excited about human food in decades, what the hell? A brief flash of arousal coursed through his body with the smell, but it was enough to catch his attention. His eyes widened as he looked over at Benny, astonished. He was smirking at him with an eyebrow raised. "Is that him? Holy crap." Benny nodded and laughed easily. "Yeah. He smells amazing, right? I've seen him around a few times the last couple of years. Ya know Zachariah Adler?" Dean scoffed loudly. "Yeah. The bible-toting, fire and brimstone guy?" Benny nodded seriously. "That's his kid." He gestured across to the room to the guy slumped over the bar, looking dejected and tired, Dean thought. "You're kidding. There's no friggin' way."
Castiel considers it for a moment before adding a new contact to his phone. His cellphone cannot be tracked, they'd made sure of that after the last mishap where Anna had nearly lost her life. Besides, continuous contact with Dean would be easier if he was using a cell phone. It was harder to track as well. He's had a security team trailing Dean since the thought occurred to him. Gadreel and Alfie worked well together, and he trusted they could keep Dean safe should something come up. There's a sharp knock on his door to which he responds, "Come in."
Dean pulls away with a laugh, swinging his duffle bag over his shoulder, leaving a grumpy Cas standing in the doorway. Dean throws open the door to the Impala and tosses his duffel in the backseat. He closes the door and wipes the condensation off of his palm. Baby's frosted with dew, and it's going to take a bit to get her windshield clear.
"Fuck," Dean mumbles under his breath. Cas plucked that right out of his head. Dean likes to be called that. Then Dean's mouth is assaulted by plush lips and a warm, wet tongue plunging into his mouth, stroking nerves across the roof of his mouth Dean didn't know he had. He responds enthusiastically, twining his tongue around Cas's, thrusting it into his mouth in a cheap imitation of sex until Cas's palm slides over his throat, clamping lightly and he pulls away. "No, no, baby boy. I don't think so. You're going to take what I give you, you understand?" Fuck, his best friend is hot. Dean nods mutely, astounded. He didn't know Cas had it in him to be so domineering... so perfect. Damn.
"I do." Then Cas leaned his head against Dean's shoulder, resting his head against Dean's chest. After a few minutes of silence, and the highway rolling by steadily out the window, Cas spoke, his voice deep and sincere. "I'm sure that whatever you did you did because you believed it to be the best option at the time." The words touched Dean, and he didn't trust himself to speak at the moment, so he settled for the next best thing. He leaned down and kissed Cas's temple softly, who hummed in response. This was nice. It felt so right, like Cas had always been meant to be here. He was supposed to be occupying shotgun in the Impala. He was supposed to be resting his head on Dean's shoulder, and playing idly with Dean's spare hand, running his fingers over the numerous scars and imperfections they held. It kind of hurt, if he was being honest, for someone else to fill that spot on the other side of the bench seat.
"Yes, Sir." Maybe he'll do okay with this whole 'Sir' thing. Cas leans away, and with the wall of heat gone from his back, he feels exposed again. But then a shiver runs down his spine and spreads across his back. Fingertips are being dragged across his shoulders, blade to blade, and back again. It feels good. Cas's hand follows the natural path down his spine to the cleft of his ass, where he palms a cheek, squeezing lightly. Dean gasps.
His boyfriend is smiling at him with nothing short of awe and pride, and the warm feeling Dean gets in his chest when Cas calls him 'good boy' is amplified without words. When Dean traces his fingers over Cas's chest, scooping up the splatters of his pearled, shining cum, and offers them up for Cas to taste, he's never seen a more amused look. Cas stares him right in the eye as he bends his head to engulf Dean's fingers in his warm mouth and proceeds to lick away his cum. They continue until they're both as clean as they can get and collapse onto the bed. They're a dried-sweat, fucked-out mess of cum smears and satisfaction that has Dean grinning like a cat that just devoured a bowl of cream, and when Cas tells him as much, he says, "Yeah. How could I be anything but satisfied with you for a boyfriend, Sir?"
"Dean, unless you would very much like to get jumped, I suggest being quiet and eating your food, or it's going to be cold when you get back to it," Castiel says with a hint of dark warning in his voice.
"Yes, of course." Castiel nods. He follows Dean and Sam into the hall after a look back at Cain, who still seems amused. Sam hurries ahead, and Castiel murmurs to Dean. "I'm sorry I worried you. I tried to call, but-"
"I think you know." Dean pushes his ass back against Cas's groin, eliciting a soft groan from him. "You want me this morning too?"
Dean bites his lip and tries to think of the speech he had laid out, but everything seems to have fallen out of his mind, and his tongue is heavy.
It takes Castiel only one day to fully understand the implications of their argument on his porch that night. It takes him another three before he’s done kicking himself in the teeth for it. It’s not
"It depends, I guess. Sometimes I'm okay. Like I'll be fine for a while, and then something will happen, and I'm super depressed again," Dean addresses his hands as he speaks. He doesn't want to look the doctor in the eye. There's always judgment with that statement. "I always feel... Not fully happy. If I'm not super depressed or super happy, I'm just neutral. I can't really just be happy, even when I am. If that makes sense."
I set my jaw, suppressing my anger. This was not the way I'd wanted dinner to go. I'd wanted to eat delicious steaks and have some sex afterwards, was that too much to ask?
"Just a little more patience," Dean said, winked at me, and then proceeded to cover his dick with lube. He positioned the smooth head at my entrance and I sobbed needily. "Please, Dean, please," I panted, wiggling my ass against his dick, drawing a moan out from him. "Please fuck me," I begged him.
"I – I wish I could be with you, you're a really amazing guy, but... I'm straight," he started to explain, tears forming in his eyes. Castiel frowned in confusion at his words. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, I just didn't want to hurt you because I really, really like you and the dates were so great, and I thought you'd run away as soon as you heard I had a son anyway, so I figured what the hell. But then you just accepted it and I... I didn't know when to bring it up. I felt too good with you and didn’t wanna destroy everything. I'm really sorry, Cas, I'm so sorry," he apologized, and a few tears escaped without his knowledge. He hadn't expected this to hurt so much.
Cas just continued looking at Dean before he had to glance away for a moment, and then nodded solemnly. "I understand," he replied. Weirdly enough, he didn't even feel insulted by Dean's mistrust. It was justified after all.
laboratory! Winchester Corp is paying good money to keep me here!" Castiel shouted, exasperated, completely disbelieving this guy's ignorance. Yes, he might look like Castiel but that was no excuse for being an assbutt.
"Will you call me tonight then?" she wanted to know, her face stony as always, and she came to stand in front of his desk determinedly. Dean had to admit, it was somewhat threatening to have her standing above him like this, quietly seething on the inside. He didn't know what to say as to not anger her even more.
"Wanna join me?" Dean asked on day two, sitting on the couch while watching a movie. It was already dark outside, the only light in the room coming from the TV.
"Benny's a bad influence, Dean. He doesn't love you like I do. Doesn't need you like you need me. He doesn't realize how dependent we are on each other," he continued, his nose burying itself in my hair. I tightened my grip around him, desperately holding on to him. He was my everything. "You're nothing without me," Castiel concluded and I knew he was right. I knew he was the only one that really mattered in the end...
Castiel arrived in his laboratory early once more, getting to work right away as it was the best distraction he could think of. He was lonely at home, the empty apartment suddenly starting to feel suffocating. Being at work, he'd decided, was the better alternative in the end.
"Alright," Castiel starts and his eyebrows lower dangerously when he comes to stand in front of him. "Here's what I think. I'm assuming you just found out I'm gay, just like everyone else at this school. But let me tell you, if you're following me around for an opportunity to beat me up, I suggest you back the hell off, 'cause I know how to throw a punch," he says darkly, a glint in his eyes that Dean can't help but feel intimidated by. He hasn't done anything wrong, Dean knows, but Castiel is fucking scary like this.
Dean's naked body is wrapped around mine, covered in dried blood but breathing. I didn't kill him. For some reason, I'm relieved about that.
"Anyway," Dean changed the subject and took a look at his clipboard. After all he was Garth's substitute for the day, probably because Amara wasn't able to supervise the whole floor all on her own. It was a big building. "How's the teleporter coming along?"
"You're in my apartment," he said matter-of-factly, his voice deeper than I believed possible, and I shook my head, forcing a smile.
"Fuck!" Dean exclaimed, almost jumping in his seat, that's how surprised he was by the sudden appearance of the vehicle. He'd seen the episode before of course -he'd seen
He's right though. Fighting him is hard and exhausting, and I'm not getting out of here anyway. Dean's not concerned about that in the slightest. Maybe I should just give up my resolve and comply...
"You know, you're actually quite handsome," Dean mutters, realization in his voice. "I might just keep you," he announces and his gaze snaps up to mine, a smug twinkle in his eyes.
They formed a quick friendship. Whenever Dean Winchester was seen during senior year, Castiel Novak was sure to be close, and after a while, people just knew to expect them together wherever they walked.
The cut actually isn't all that deep but almost immediately pearls of blood are forming on my skin, the red color glowing beautifully. I dip my finger into the liquid, watching in awe when my finger is suddenly covered in red as well.
I didn't say a word when he crowded me against the fridge, kissing me eagerly, and I reciprocated like always. It wasn't as if I didn't have the physical strength to shove him away, I just couldn't help myself. I was weak because wanted him. I
And there it was, minutes later, they watched quietly as Dr. Sexy broke down crying in the janitor's closet, still high on pain meds, effectively ending the episode in a giant cliffhanger.
I shouldn't watch this, I realized. I should leave right this second and never turn around, move to another country even. But my limbs were frozen and unmoving, the only part of my body reacting in any way being my dick that was perking up in interest.
Dean, who had of course noticed Cas's stolen glance, turned to look at him and sighed defeatedly. He disappeared in his bedroom for a few seconds and when he came back, he set some kind of cube down in front of Cas, crossing his arms as he looked down on him.
Today when Dean found me, Mom was out jogging, leaving me alone with my step-father yet again. I was in the kitchen, looking for something to eat when he came in, fixing me with that look I'd gotten used to over time.
"We could've gotten together after time," Dean said weakly, knowing that his argument was pathetic. "You know what?" he added before Castiel could reply. "Forget it."
All of a sudden, I noticed a movement out of the corner of my eye. It was Castiel's hand wandering over to his white boxers determinedly, cupping his obvious erection and slowly stroking it through the cloth. He let out a small moan and I felt my breathing becoming shallow.
"Stop teasing me, asshole," Cas ended the conversation, shoving Dean's shoulder playfully, and then shifted on the table, so he was lying down, resting his head in Dean's lap. He closed his eyes contently, humming when Dean started stroking his hair, and smiled.
"What's your last name?" Castiel suddenly asked, realizing the only possible explanation for all this.
"You got space for one more?" Castiel spoke over the music, locking eyes with a stunning model-type man in his thirties. He had intense green eyes and a stubbled jaw, and he was weirdly pretty for a man his age. He was obviously older than Castiel by about ten years but Castiel wasn't all that bothered by it. He'd screwed around with older guys before and he'd never been disappointed.
"See you around...Dean," Castiel muttered, more to himself than anyone else, and watched Dean disappear into the crowd slowly.
"Did you get bullied?" Dean wants to know and he sets his jaw hard, seeming weirdly upset. My heart flutters when I realize he's angry at my harassers.
"I wanna show you something later," he says nonchalantly and puts it down at the edge of the bed for future use. Then he crawls back onto the bed with me.
I shifted slightly, trying to escape his arms without waking him up, but he just pulled me closer, possessive even during sleep. I turned my head towards him.
The door closes again and a few seconds later, Dean is standing in my room, staring at me as if I'm an angel. I don't break eye contact when he comes closer and cups my face with his hands. His eyes are full of wonder.
Castiel's smile slipped off his face slowly. He visibly gulped down his disappointment, glancing away to hide his unshed tears. Dean knew they were there anyway.
It takes hours until I'm thinking clearly again. Most of the time under the influence I'm a barely conscious mess, holding on to Dean with a death grip and blabbering unintelligible sentences. I feel like I'm flying.
"Um, since the beginning?" Dean replied, cocking an eyebrow at my unbelieving expression. "What's going on, Sammy? You
On the fourth day after, Dean stayed home instead of going to work. He called in sick, not wanting to deal with people, or anything, really. He didn't even want to deal with himself, but sadly, there was no escaping there. Still, it was better to stay home for a day and figure it all out before he started going mad and throwing stuff around.
I didn't know how long I ended up standing in our doorway, staring down the hall, but it was way to long for it to be normal. I couldn't help it though. I was completely smitten.
"So? It's not like anyone will notice," Metatron waved off Inias's concern. "Just fix the problem on the next ones. And I expect you to increase the number we produce! Now leave me alone, I have some thinking to do," he explained and Inias nodded, setting his jaw.
The movie was good. Castiel hadn't seen it before, but it was such a nice mix of action and comedy for Castiel to be really into it. He also liked Dean's frequent huffs of laughter and the way their thighs touched almost accidentally but completely on purpose.
"Call me," Dean repeated and winked one last time. Then he left the store, seemingly satisfied with the way things had turned out, the pain in his back forgotten.
It was an awfully dull morning, Dean decided. Outside it was raining, the falling drops drumming a tiring rhythm against his bedroom window, and even the prospect of coffee didn't make him perk up like usual. It had gotten a little late yesterday. After the party his Dad had made him attend, he'd gone to a bar with his friend Benny to relieve some of the evening's tension with some drinks. He might've had one too many...
Ten minutes later, he was back in the room with two plates full of food, setting them down on the table, and gestured for Cas to get over there. Cas complied immediately and watched Dean putting syrup and butter on both their pancakes, impatiently waiting for Cas to sit down.
"What do you want me to say?" he asked, a pen in hand. "How can there be mind readers and nobody knows about them, huh?"
"That's...?" I asked, ignoring Dean because this was more important. How could it be that Cas was engaged? Who would he even marry? Did he even talk to anyone besides Dean and me?
"Who are these from?" she asked and reached out a hand to touch the blossoms, not seeming to appreciate their beauty but rather wanting to feel the delicate structure underneath her fingers. The gesture felt violating in a way.
He deflated quietly, not knowing why he felt like he did, and turned his head, not wanting to continue listening. Instead, he forced himself to take another look around. Hanging on the wall were a few family pictures of Sam and Dean as kids with their parents. Also, a photo of a grumpy looking older guy in a suit and a tough-looking woman in a wedding dress, a girl of about 16 years standing next to them proudly. Maybe their daughter? Cas didn't know. He should ask Sam about it later...
"Please," I start, sounding even more frightened than before, and a wayward tear leaves my eye. "Please, I won't tell anyone, I don't even know your name, just let me go, please," I whimper. I'm a pathetic mess, that's for sure, but I'm hoping for a miracle.
One cup was empty fairly quickly, the second following soon after, and before he entirely realized, he was sitting in his Baby and on his way to work.
Once the man is bleeding from what feels like every pore, his fighting becomes less and less, exhaustion and blood loss making him weak. He won't be alive for much longer.
"You... You want to be with me? Really?" Dean asked. "Even though I'm a needy boyfriend?" he added quietly, still not trusting the whole thing, but Castiel wiped away his worries by leaning over to press a gentle kiss to Dean's lips. Dean felt slightly dizzy when Castiel pulled away.
"Your mom has a night shift, you'd be alone anyway," Castiel answered before I finished my question.
"This, Sammy, is the answer to everything," Dean said smugly while watching Sam frown down at the thing in Cas's head. "It may sound a little sci-fi, but just imagine if someone managed to do a
As soon as Dean had heard about Amara's attempts though, he'd started coming to work earlier, so he'd be there to accept the bouquets. He didn't want to take the risk of Amara getting to them. Yes, they were just flowers but Dean had never received that much attention from a person that wasn't Amara, much less a
people! Improved versions. And of course, they're all completely under my control!" Metatron exclaimed and laughed exhilaratedly. The happiness didn't suit him. But then again nothing really
"What do you say, you move upstairs with me?" Dean suddenly suggests between kisses and I can hardly believe what he's asking me to do.
Dean didn't bother replying and simply smiled instead, taking a huge bite. It tasted just as heavenly as it smelled. "Holy fuck," he cursed unattractively with his mouth full of burger. "So good."
He looked back out the window, the men having disappeared into the hospital. Now was the perfect time to go. They wouldn't see him leaving Dean's Baby and therefore not question where it was he came from -- or it would be easier to lie about it, at least.
Only when Dean's arms wrapped around my thighs, pushing them up so my hole was exposed, did I come back to reality. I pulled back from the kiss, too nervous to reciprocate, and Dean kissed a trail down my jaw.
I stayed with Castiel whenever Mom wasn't there -which was often- and I even stopped eating at home in general, not wanting to waste Mom's food. Castiel had assured me that he earned enough to support us both without it having negative consequences for him. I was unbelievably thankful that he did that for me.
I stopped going to school as well, the risk of seeing my friend and being confronted was too much for me. Castiel said it was fine, school wasn't important for me anyway since I had him to care for me. And if Mom found out about my skipping, I'd deal with it later.
The drive to Sam's house was a short one. Apparently, he lived close enough to walk but had decided to take the car because it was raining. Sam told him that even though it was his brother's car, today had been one of the rare occasions Dean -that was his brother- had allowed him to borrow it.
," he said, obviously mocking the name he had given himself, and Cas glanced up at him expectantly. "You might've fooled my brother," he started, holding Cas's curious stare, "but don't believe for a
The memory came back quickly. I was with my neighbor Castiel after a night of an intense jerk off session and he was lying in bed next to me at the moment. My chest filled with panic. What had I gotten myself into?
"Sit on the bed," Dean orders and I turn towards him in surprise. I just assumed he'd left, but he's still there, closing the door shut, turning a key around in the lock. I am closed in with him.
"Sorry I didn't tell you he was coming, I just figured he'd be welcome," Dean apologized and I shook my head quickly.
“Shut up,” he warned preemptively, “I’m actually pretty good at mechanics, in case you forgot. Here,” Dean offered, face inelegantly red as he clamped his hands around Cas’ wrists tightly. The angel followed suit.
Dean could just barely make out the pile of beige trenchcoat splayed against the offensively coloured carpet. It was scattered beneath what at first, appeared to be a huge black miasma. Dean drew in a tight breath.
voice. It was the placating, grisly-call-to-desperate-action-or-we’re-all-going-to-die sort of one he used whenever the latest apocalypse had befallen them, or occasionally, when the beer had run out. (He was a conscientious fridge-keeper.) Either way, Dean’s innards clenched with the anticipation of something drastically wrong and he bulldozed right past Cas and his stupid, harbinger-of-doom tone, cell in hand.
He could hear the dull throb of electronic music even through the thick, chromed steel of the Impala.
He refused to open his eyes, even though the pulsing beat of wings was undeniably more steady now, and smoother than he would have pictured given the angelic canon balls Cas had been pockmarking the landscape with earlier. Furthermore, Cas’ firm, encompassing hold on him, while definitely functional, seemed far more affectionate than the workings of a mere safety feature. He’d somehow tucked his feet beneath Dean’s like this was some sort of aerial dance lesson, while his arms locked tightly around his waist. They were so close that he felt more like he was
Dean felt a surge of satisfaction as Charlie glanced over and raised her brows in surprise at the queue of
This time, the angel intervened. Dean was brutally reminded that Castiel could have stopped the proceedings at any point, as he suddenly found himself pinned to the wall like a sputtering butterfly, wandering limbs immobilized under Cas’s steel grasp. He panted hard, finding it difficult to deny his body’s clear enjoyment of this turn of events.
His pulse immediately shot into the stratosphere as the smell of summer rain- Cas - breached him, uninvited and intoxicating. He braced himself on the doorframe, fingernails etching desperate anchors into the wood. The angel’s word’s barely registered as Dean’s flesh danced with unwarranted delight at how sinfully Castiel’s lips moved to form them.
Dean hummed his assent, cheeks blazing. He had to crane his neck up now, to properly follow Cas’ face, and grinned proudly at the apparent success of his strategy.
Dean confirms, as his hand reaches without permission and clamps down on the angel’s shoulder. He knows he’s caught now, but old habits die hard.
Dean felt a light chill travel up his spine at the mention of his name from the kitchen’s entrance. He knew the angel could be grumpy at the best of times, but the arctic tone seemed uncalled for, especially at this hour of the morning. He hadn’t even poured his coffee for chrissake, there’s no way he could have fucked up already. So, determined to maintain his precarious good mood, Dean flipped his eggs, tightened the belt of his robe against the bunker’s chill and turned towards Cas with a forced smile.
probably BAKED the first one - which gives you points in my book by the way - even though it was probably made of rocks and sticks or something.”
because Sam is right on the money. (Dammit, is he really that transparent?) He briefly considers giving one mug of joe to Sam, as though that were his plan all along; as though he didn’t know fine well that Sam has actually been drinking some fancy, flowery tea with his breakfasts lately. Before he can decide, his younger brother foils him.
“That was too close, Cas,” he says. He hates the obvious tremble of his voice, yet makes no attempt to mask it.
An assembly of visibly-excited patrons of all persuasions were queued under a large marquee with the words “
Cas meanwhile, seemed sheepish at the statement, pressing his teeth into that generous bottom lip of his, which was almost Dean’s undoing.
Cas teetered like a buoy in rough seas, but managed to stay upright somehow. Dean suddenly wished that his brother and his gigantor nerd brain were here to lend him a freakin’ neuron or two, though he figured Sammy 2.0 was probably sandwiched between a pair of bosom buddies with dessert-themed names by now, given his recent tendencies. Besides, Cas’ needle looked like it had dropped from quarter tank to empty in the last 30 seconds. He’d deteriorated so fast Dean’s head was spinning, and he doubted Sam would even get there in time..
“They probably recruited a very powerful warlock, or worse, to concoct such a spell. One of my lieutenants took the brunt of the strike, but I was still partially hit. It was enough to cause me considerable damage… my angelic attributes have been….
Cas stirred slightly. Dean could have sworn there were hands on his cheeks again, and a soft brush of lips against his forehead. His suspicions were too soon extinguished by the gentle brush of grace for him to really tell.
Not that he hadn’t sort of enjoyed Cas essentially monologuing to his posterior, but now that Dean felt direly sentimental about the angel’s admission, he grudgingly turned around to face him. He’d expected Cas’ sharp blue eyes to be locked on, peeling away his defenses layer by layer in that unsettling way that only Cas could. However, the angel kept his penetrating gaze resolutely angled away. His eyes were downcast in fact; his posture crumpled like discarded newspaper while his wings caged them.
From his lips poured the familiar tingle of Grace trickling down into his limbs, knitting his wounds back together. Dean bristled in dissent, given how dangerously drained Cas had been mere hours ago, but the firm squeeze on his shoulders had been warning enough.
And okay, some of Dean's friends later argued that 'a blowjob was a blowjob, no matter if you got it from a girl or a guy, no big deal at all,' but most of them knew that this was special. If it really didn't make a difference, then why had Dean never done it before?
Caught in a weird sort of hug, all Dean can do is stare down at the dorky, trench-coated boy below him, who is looking back at him with surprise in his wide blue eyes. The boy's mouth opens but no sound comes out for a few seconds. And then he finally seems to realize their predicament and pushes away quickly.
Thank God his Dad was the owner of Winchester Corp or Dean might get in trouble for showing up late some day. As it was though, nobody would scold him as long as he turned up within the first half of the day. Yep, his life was awesome like that.
Yeah, things with Castiel were getting more and more serious, indeed. I was beginning to depend on him, following him around like a puppy, and I knew it was dangerous but I didn't mind.
Conversation returned back to normal and by the time the check came, it was later than Dean had expected it to be. It was good that Jack usually spent the night at Mary's whenever he was on a date (which hadn't happened very often lately), so he didn't have to watch the time.
Letting a small moan escape his mouth, Dean leaned further into Cas, gently pushing him down on the couch, and let one of his hands travel underneath Cas's shirt. His skin was smooth and warm and Dean slowly let his hand wander upwards across Cas's abs, his flat stomach, his strong chest, and stopped right above where Cas's heart was beating rapidly beneath his fingers. Knowing that it was
to go out with Castiel? Did it make any difference? He wasn't gay after all; hadn't ever been. He'd slept with more women than he could count, and there was probably no point in going out with Castiel if Dean wasn't even into guys, right?
One of the bedroom doors opened then and Cas looked up. It was Sam, already dressed up in a loose shirt and shorts, apparently about to go for a run. He greeted Cas and asked him how he felt, which Cas thought was nice, replying with a heartfelt, "Very well." Then Sam said goodbye and went for his jog while Cas continued sitting on the couch.
"You're still young... Oh, I can teach you so much," he swoons and his gaze wanders to the ceiling, probably lost in his daydreams of a hundred different ways to fuck me.
Noticing Cas's gaze, Dean nodded at him and disappeared in the kitchen for a little while. He came back with a cup of coffee and sat down at the table alone. His eyes found Cas's again, the look in them evaluating and skeptical.
Suddenly, the door to what Castiel assumed was a bedroom opened and a tall guy with shaggy brown hair stepped outside. When he saw the two men in the living room, he stopped in his tracks.
"Cas," he said, knowing he'd have to come clean now. There was no more postponing it. He looked down at the hands on his lap in shame. "I'm sorry, I – I can't."
"Dinner," I replied, voice rougher than usual. "I'm making vegetable soup," I explained, clearing my throat. Dean's arms tightened around my waist slightly, his warmth sending a pleasant shiver down my spine.
And just like that, the air around them seemed to crackle in anticipation. It was as if that sentence had opened the door to a million possibilities. The atmosphere was tense, but it was a good kind of tension, and neither of them was very eager to avert their gaze.
Especially when there's a bloody, beaten man hanging from the ceiling limply, a cloth in his mouth to keep him from screaming. His skin shimmers in a lovely shade of red.
"Yeah, I thought... I thought maybe it might be fun." Dean shrugged. He seemed even more insecure now than before, so Castiel tried not to question him any longer.
Cas narrowed his eyes in thought. "Not that I can remember," he said. "But then again, I cannot remember
"Hey, Cas," he suddenly said, a humorous tilt to his voice, and Castiel looked up with raised eyebrows. "I'm pregnant," Dean announced, grinning widely, and held up a
My lips travel down to his collarbone, slightly pulling his shirt out of the way, and I can hear Cas suppress a moan. It starts a fire inside of me. I bite down hard, just as hard as he had before, and smile to myself when I hear Cas gasp. His hand's in my hair all of a sudden, pulling me up slightly. His eyes are closed when I look up at him. He's beautiful.
Either way, the speculations reached from 'he has a girlfriend' to 'he's gay' to 'he grew out of it' to 'Castiel talked some sense into him'. Because it really had been a little embarrassing now that they thought about it. A guy shouting out just what kind of sexual act he'd just engaged in was a little childish after all.
"Hey babe," Balthazar greeted Castiel and threw his arms around his neck in an exaggerated manner, pressing his cheek against Castiel's. "How's the best boyfriend in the
A few weeks later, Castiel and Dean went to Prom together. They had dinner at Dean's house before they left, just like they'd planned it, and Dean's parents fell in love with Castiel almost as quickly as Dean had. At Prom, Castiel got to meet all of Dean's friends - whom Dean had apparently told weeks ago that they were dating - and surprisingly got along great with all of them. Then again, he should've expected it, since Dean chose his friends carefully.
"It just... happened, I don't know, we just talk sometimes," I said and if Benny knew I was keeping a secret, he didn't comment on it.
"Mhh, that's really good pie," I exclaimed surprisedly after taking the first bite and humming contently. Even Mom's pies didn't taste as good! I wondered where he'd gotten it from.
This morning, Dean had been working on giving him back clear thought once his cover was opened, and he'd succeeded spectacularly. Dean was a beautiful and smart man, who seemed to be very gifted in all matters of mechanical engineering. Cas couldn't help but feel honored that such a wonderful man adored his company.
"No," Dean said, smirking smugly, and that was when he finally noticed me. He smiled even wider and turned towards me, holding up his free hand in greeting.
"Yes, I do wanna learn somethin'," I repeat his words enthusiastically, slurring slightly, and Dean stands up, holding out his hand to me. I take it immediately.
Castiel was quicker putting in his clothes than I was. He had less stuff anyway, seeing as I was washing Mom's clothes, too.
"Well then, I'll leave you to it," John announced, clapped Dean and Castiel on the shoulders and left them behind, causing a slight panic to rise in Castiel's chest at the thought of having to talk to Dean alone. But Dean didn't seem all that bothered by it and just continued talking conversationally.
Breathlessly, I push him off me so he's the one lying underneath me and then I adjust our positions so I'm hovering above him. "Where do you want 'em?" I ask hoarsely and Cas vaguely points in the direction of his pulse point. I nod quietly and lean down eagerly, kissing the spot tentatively at first to get a taste of his salty skin -- you gotta take the chance once you have it. Then I start nibbling and licking and sucking slightly, all the while feeling Cas's unnaturally fast heartbeat underneath my lips. He must be as turned on as I was before, but who wouldn't be?
somebody, needed them to be his, and for the first time in his life Castiel was ready to take a risk for that.
what exactly our plan is?" he asked, as if the plan hadn't been the only thing they'd been talking about for
It was disgusting and pathetic and Castiel only hoped nobody would ever find out about this part of the night.
"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun," Dean said and winked at me playfully. I felt the usual uncomfortable warmth pooling in my gut and shifted in my seat slightly. Damn him and his ability to make me hard and uneasy at the same time.
Sam and Cas arrived soon enough and Sam parked the car in a spacious garage next to a small but pretty looking house. Leaving the car when Sam did, Cas followed Sam around to the front door.
We do it again afterwards. We're too horny to care, cocks ready again after what feels like seconds, and we give in to our drives happily. It's amazing how good one can feel while exhausting themself.
"Cas!" Dean exclaims and hurries over, too relieved to recognize the warning signals Castiel is giving off. He's alright - that's all that matters.
"What the hell?" he asked nobody in particular and frowned in confusion. His fingers found the cold thing again and pushed away Cas's short strands of hair to get a better look at whatever it was.
Why the hell did Castiel not spontaneously combust when that smile was directed at him? How did he survive? Castiel didn't know either. But he suddenly remembered vividly why he wanted this guy so badly and what he'd promised himself this morning.
It's hours before I finally hear the sound of footsteps. Unexpectedly though, Dean doesn't enter my room immediately, instead, I hear the door of his torture chamber creak open. He's taking a look at the mess I made, I realize. I instinctively wonder whether he likes it.
"Well, what is the last thing Sam would expect us to be doing?" he says and I raise my eyebrows expectantly. "I mean, what would have to happen for him to be completely and utterly speechless?" he adds.
When I was halfway done, Castiel suddenly stood up and came to sit next to me. I looked up at him questioningly, mid-bite, and let go off the pie.
