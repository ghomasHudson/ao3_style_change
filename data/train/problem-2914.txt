Cas got up and followed Dean into the kitchen. Dean could still feel his heart beating fast, but tried his best to hide his nervousness.
With a sigh, Sam gets up from the bed and leaves without another word, and Dean's left again with his own painful thoughts.
"Chick flick, Cas" Dean laughed again. "Apparently you bring out the romcom in me." Dean looked into Cas face, seeing the relief there. 'He should know I'd never say no spending time with him' Dean thought. He leaned in and kissed Cas. "So, what were you thinking?" When Cas just stared at him, he said "for the date, Cas. Where do you want to go?"
Dean turned, pulled Cas against him, and wrapped his arms around him. He felt Cas' arms slide around his back.
"Fuck, I missed you." Dean says quietly, fingers still carding through Cas' hair. "I missed you so much." He presses his lips back to Cas'. "Never wanna be away from you again." His words mumbled against Cas' lips.
Dean was saying the things Cas had wanted to hear for years, and he couldn't wrap his mind around it. Joy surged inside his chest, and before he could even think about it, his hand was on Dean's face, cupping his cheek. "I've been in love with you for so long." Cas whispered.
Peering up through his eyelashes, he watched Dean's face. Dean was staring down at him with a look of wonder and pleasure.
Cas looks up at Dean, sees the honesty in his face, and he is so beautiful. Cas kisses him then, slow and sweet, losing themselves in each other.
"Wow, okay," Charlie says, sitting back as well. After a minute, she turns back to him. "Alright, first of all, you need a shower, cuz no offense but you're not gonna fix anything smelling like that."
"Hello, my name is Cas and I'll be your waiter this evening. Can I start you gentlemen off with something to drink?" He asks. Dean looks up into bright blue eyes and a gorgeous face, and is struck silent for a moment. Cas is smiling down at him expectantly, and Dean is tongue tied.
Cas is even more confused now. He's looking from Dean to the tarp and back again, head tilted in question.
"Hi!" She said, standing. She took Cas' hand, shaking it. "It is so nice to meet you! I'm Courtney."
is on, then figures it's probably late enough to shower and get ready, even though he still has an hour and a half until he needs to leave.
A bang comes from down the hall, some rustling, then a minute later Cas appears, hair a mess, shirt on backwards and inside out, and face flushed.
"Well, I figure either you're lying to scare me away" she said, staring at Cas. "Or you're telling the truth to scare me away."
"Damnit Cas, stop!" Dean said. He reached forward and grabbed Cas' arm, holding him in place. Dean moved forward until he was direct in front of Cas, then he leaned in. He wanted to show Cas, rather than tell him, all the things that had been running through his head for the last four miserable days.
"When I left here, I didnt plan on doing what I did. I stopped at the bar because I needed a drink." Dean said.
Dean's brow furrows for a moment, then understanding dawns on his face. "Fuck, no that's not what I was saying." He pulls Cas closer to him. "I can see how that sounded like what I was saying, but it wasn't."
Dean turned around in his seat and looked into the face of a beautiful woman. She had long dark brown hair, almost black in the bar light, plump red lips, a hot body covered in a short black dress, and sparkling blue eyes.
Suddenly there was movement in the doorway behind Sam, and Cas walked into the room. Dean could feel his heart start to pound, and his hands start to shake a little. "Cas" he whispered.
Dean laid his hand on Cas' thigh, running his hand along the outside, up to his hip, then along his side until it reached his bare chest. Dean skimmed his hand along the hard lines of Cas. This was different than being with a woman. Not soft and supple, but hard and firm. And the stubble rubbing his chin and cheeks raw. But damn he really liked it. Not because it was a guy, but because it was Cas.
"Damnit Cas" Dean said, before leaning his head down and kissing Cas one more time. After pulling back, he climbed out of Cas' lap and sat back in his own chair. His hard cock was throbbing with want, but he wasnt going to take Cas right here in the library, with Sam right around the corner.
Cas nodded. "I understand Dean. But this means we have a way to kill Chuck and, in the end, that means freedom."
That is what it feels like, Cas thinks, sitting here with Dean in this limbo, smells of antiseptic around them, sorrow and guilt coursing through him.
. Cas, who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. Cas, who he cares for more than he's ever cared about anyone. Cas, who he loves.
"Its really fine Cas. Here" Dean said, as he handed him one of his tshirts. "Put this on and let's grab something to eat. Dont worry about Sammy."
"So, you made an egg white and turkey bacon breakfast sandwich?" Cas asks, because that doesn't seem like Dean either.
"I'd like to know, too." Dean mumbles to the onions. He sets the knife down and looks at Cas, leaning on his hands braced on the edge of the counter. "It's just me. Just me and Emma. Sorry to disappoint."
"Of course, Dean." Cas says, another kiss pressed to Dean's hair. "I love you. I love you more than anything. And I missed you so very much."
God Dean was beautiful, all long and lean muscles. His cock was hard and leaking, and Cas wanted so badly to take him in his mouth. But he knew what Dean wanted, and he knew if he started that it would be almost impossible to make himself stop before Dean came down his throat. Instead, he leaned over and pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom from his nightstand, setting them on the bed before returning to Dean's mouth.
about it. He's not extremely excited, or even nervous really like he has been in the past before first dates, but he is looking forward to it, which is a start.
Dean brought his hand up, resting it on the back of Cas' neck. He leaned his head forward until his forehead was pressed against Cas'.
Down the driveway, Cas tells him to take it around the side of the house, then leads them to the large building in the back. They set it down outside so Cas can spin the numbers on the lock, then get it back up and inside.
Jumping apart, Dean swore under his breath. "Shit, forgot about the damn popcorn." Dean shook his head, pulling himself out of the almost trance-like state he had been in.
Cas continued his slow pace, it taking everything he had not to just thrust into Dean. The feeling of Dean surrounding him, buried deep within him, was almost too much. If he didnt take it slow, it might be over far before he was ready.
"Just throw it over there" Claire responds, gesturing to the side of the room where at least 3/4 of her boxes still sit, full.
The long lonely days of an empty apartment seem like so long ago, with Dean's large personality filling the spaces now. Asking Dean to come stay with him had been a spur of the moment, not thought out plan, but it's been the best thing he could've done.
Dean makes his way out the backdoor and across the yard to Cas' workshop, pushing open the cracked door until it's wide enough for him to enter.
God he's beautiful, even angry, and Cas can't even blame him for being mad, he has every right to be. Cas fucked up, but Dean is here. He's right here.
Cas let out a small laugh. "I dont think you can get any closer, Dean" he said. That wouldn't stop him from trying though.
Dean wedged a leg in between Cas' thighs, and Cas could feel himself growing harder, pressing against Dean.
Dean's arms wind around him pulling them flush together. His body tingles where Dean touches him, and all he wants is more. He licks into Dean's mouth, and he opens up to him, deepening the kiss. A whimper escapes Dean's throat, and Cas just grips him tighter, never wanting to let go.
The morning goes smoothly, and Dean is starting to cheer up a bit, thoughts of Cas bringing a smile to his face whenever he thinks of his amazing boyfriend.
"I meant tonight, dad. After we eat. Please? I really wanna try the caramel popcorn flavor they have, I've been thinking about it all day since Emma told me about it." She's practically bouncing in her seat.
When Cas joined him on the bed, Dean turned towards him. "I dont want you to ever think I'd regret any of this. Even if you change your mind 5 minutes from now, I'll have enjoyed what we've done with no regrets." Dean brought his hand up to Cas' face, touching his cheek.
Dean dug through his drawers again, pulling out a pair of sweatpants, a grey t-shirt, and a pair of boxer briefs.
Cas started to move his hips in time with Dean's hand, moving his own hands down Dean's back onto his ass. Cas gripped him, and pulled him against himself, feeling Dean's own hard cock rub against his right leg.
The space between them closed, and Cas felt Dean's lips on his for the first time. They were warm, and soft, and so perfect. Cas slid his hand behind Dean's neck, and gripped Dean's hip with the other, pulling him even closer. The hard stone behind him was pressing into his back, as Dean pushed against him.
As Cas pulled his head back to breathe, Dean moved down to his neck, kissing and biting any skin he could get to. He reached his hand down to the hem of Cas' shirt, and pushed it up, trying to get to more skin. Cas leaned up a bit, allowing Dean to pull the shirt over his head.
Dean popped his mouth off, and licked a line, slowly, from the tip to the base, then back up again. When he got to the head, he sunk his mouth down back over it, this time continuing down until Cas' tip hit the back of his throat.
Dean is the most understanding man he's ever met, always checking in to make sure Cas has taken a break, or eaten, or even drank something. It's so completely the opposite of every relationship he's ever had, and he's reveling in it.
What felt like hours later, Cas sat up and looked into Dean's eyes. Hed finally calmed himself down.
Dean, in silence, ate the rest of his two pieces and grabbed two more. He was stuck in his head, the thoughts of what he and Cas had done swirling around.
Dean sits on the edge of the couch, arms resting on his thighs, head bowed. "You're right." He makes a motion to the end of the couch and waits for Cas to sit down.
"Okay." Dean said, grabbing Cas' hand and pulling him to his Impala. Cas quickly scrambled into the passenger seat, as Dean slid in and started it up. Dean tossed Cas his phone. "Can you text Sammy for me?"
"It's a Southern Tier Pumpking. Pumpkin ale. You can only get it in the fall, but it's one of my favorites" Cas says, taking a drink of his own.
The only thing he's gathered, from the information he was given to do the job, is that Dean's shop does very, very well. Impressively well. Cas didn't realize how much money auto restoration brought it, but it makes sense. The cars are old, irreplaceable, and people want them done right. Clearly, Dean's good with his hands, good at what he does. He always was.
He could hear Cas take a breath, then felt him slide his hands under the waistband of his pants, pulling them down and off, and discarding them to floor as well.
"No problem. I'm glad someone around here appreciates my cooking" Dean replied, looking pointedly at Sam.
She has to have surgery. His little not so little girl is going to have surgery and she was in pain and he wasn't here for her because he's selfish and a bad father, and... fuck.
They're at a steakhouse, and Cas has a delicious strip steak and a glass of wine in front of him, the lights are low and romantic, though it's a little loud in there. Asa's talking about books, the conversation has never once been the normal level of awkward for a first date, and Cas can't stop thinking about the look on Dean's face when he'd told him he had a date. He keeps thinking about the words Dean said, how he wanted to start over, how he'd said that Cas had been different.
Cas smiles, face softening. "It's Dean, right?" When Dean nods, Cas continues. "It's not necessary because Benny is not my manager." Dean's confused now, and it must show on his face because Cas chuckles a little. "This is my restaurant, I own it. We had some call offs from the waitstaff tonight, so I went out on the floor to help out. I knew your date wouldn't let up until he spoke to someone else, so I grabbed Benny." He's smiling more now. "It would have to be pretty bad for me to fire myself."
Sam leaves the room without another word, and Dean falls back into a fitful sleep, pictures of Cas like snapshots in his mind.
Dean kissed Cas deeply, exploring his mouth with his tongue. When Dean pulled Cas' body against his, Cas pulled his head back a little, breathless. "We're going to be late, Dean."
"Yeah." Claire breathes out, before looking at her dad. "What're you doing?" She asks, as he reaches for the door handle.
He's already left at least twenty messages, but he leaves another one anyway. "Dean, please call me. Please. I'm sorry."
Right around 4, the doorbell rings. Alex and Patience show up first, together, and then Kaia, who's another new kid that Claire actually made friends with and brought into their little group. When Dean found out she was new too, he joked with Emma "I didn't date her dad too, did I?" Which he thought was actually a funny joke, but Emma just looked at him like he was insane, so he said "her mom?" And she kept looking at him like that and he realized that he's now in dad joke territory and he's getting old. It was still funny though.
"I've had the shop for seven years, and I've done the books every month since we opened. It's definitely never gotten easier." Dean walks over to the fridge and pulls out a couple bottles of water, passing one over to Cas who moves to stand on the opposite side of the island, just like the day before.
He makes the pizzas and fries and the girls converge on the kitchen and scarf them down with liters of soda like they've been in the desert for 40 years without food or drink.
"I'm sorry Dean, you just seem like a chicken guy." Gordon says, with what seems like an almost forced smile.
Once again, after Cas leaves and for the rest of the day, Dean feels content, even happy. At dinner, when Emma looks at him strangely because he can't stop smiling, he just smiles bigger and hands her another piece of pie.
Cas followed behind Dean to the shower room, sure that Dean would start up two separate showers for them.
Dean just smiled and shook his head. 'I cant believe this is mine.' He thought to himself. 'I cant believe I ever denied myself this'.
Cas thrust his hips forward and pulled Dean against him at the same time, eliciting a moan from Dean's mouth.
When Charlie arrives through the still unlocked door, she takes one look at Cas, drops down onto the couch next to him, and pulls him into a hug.
"No, don't be sorry. I liked it, a lot, if you couldn't tell." Cas nuzzles along Dean's neck to his ear. "I don't think you have any idea how sexy I find you."
"Yes Cas, please." Dean said, knowing what the question was. "I need it. I need you. Please" He leaned over and pulled a bottle out of his nightstand, handing it to Cas.
Blind dates are usually a disaster, but his dry spell is going on almost a year now and he's desperate enough to get back out there that he's decided to give it a shot.
Cas blushed a bit in the almost darkness. "Sorry Dean. It just happened, I couldn't control it" he said.
Dean presses their bodies together, and Cas feels hot, burning up, so full of lust that he doesn't know what to do. He tangles his hands in Dean's shirt, pulling him even closer until there's nothing left between them except their clothes.
Dean feels fingers carding through his hair and opens his eyes to get a sightful of Cas. "Hello, Dean." Cas says, a small smile pulling at his lips.
Dean placed his hands on Cas' hips, pulling him even closer to his body. He felt Cas shiver against him.
"How are you?" Dean asks, and isn't that one of five million questions Dean wants to ask. How has he been all this time, why is he here back in Kansas, who is Claire's other parent, are they still together, does he hate Dean for what happened? 'How are you' seems the easiest.
Dean coughed a little, then adjusted himself in his seat so he was facing a little more towards Cas, but not a very noticable change.
Cas, the perceptive angel that he was, picked up on it almost immediately. As Dean went to start the popcorn machine (a purchase he told Sammy was a necessity), Cas slowly walked up behind him.
He knows that it's probably not right, that this is putting too much pressure on Dean, but when Dean grabs him and pulls him into a hug, he can't help but feel warmed by it.
Dean leaves without argument, because he knows the sooner he gets home the sooner he can tell Cas, and then it'll either be really bad, or the most amazing thing that's ever happened to him.
Feeling Dean solid and warm against him sends shivers of arousal and want through him. He can feel it curling in his stomach, and pulls Dean even tighter against him, deepening the kiss.
"What about you? You don't have to tell me, I understand if it's too personal." Dean says, and he's so sincere about it that Cas knows he really has to.
Cas hands him the sander and points to some wood on the workbench, just like the other night, and Dean gets to work, losing himself in the vibration and humming of the machine.
Dean's appetite is gone, he's getting a headache, and he just wants to go home. This is one of the worst dates he's ever been on, and he had such high hopes for it going in that he's extremely disappointed.
"I told you, I like you the way you are. You don't need to change." Dean says, brow furrowed with concern. Then Cas can see understanding dawn on his face. "This is because I cancelled last night. Damnit, I'm sorry."
Dean pulled his mouth from Cas', and dropped to his knees, his face mere inches from Cas' hard cock.
Standing up, Cas takes another look at the boxes. "At least try to put one or two away before dinner please." When she nods, he leaves the room and heads back to his own.
Cas' heart sinks into his stomach, and he swallows audibly, backing up minutely, hands dropping by his sides. "Okay." He says, nervously.
Cas moved his arms from around Dean, and grabbed Dean's upper arms so he could look at him. Cas didnt say a word, just pulled Dean to him and pressed his lips against Dean's.
"Don't deny it, and don't sell yourself short. You are fantastic." Cas hands over the box, and Dean takes it without opening it. "I think you should start your own business. You can work out of here until we finish building you your own space, but I know you can do it. I believe in you." Cas nods to the box and Dean opens it.
Dean smiled. Hed just met this chick but she now sounded as invested in this as Sam was. He pulled up a blank message and wrote:
He looked into Dean's eyes as his tip slowly moved inside of him. Dean closed his eyes, throwing his head back into the pillow.
"Be there in twenty. Hang in there." She hangs up the phone and Cas is left just sitting there staring at it.
"Dean Winchester, I love you. I loved you seventeen years ago when you made me feel like the most important person in your world. I loved you even when you left, when it hurt not to see you or even hear your voice. I loved you through all those years of heartache. I loved you the second you opened that door for me all those weeks ago. And I love you right now, standing here, even more than I thought possible, because of everything you said. You protected us as best you could, and gave up something you wanted in order to do that, and I will never ever be able to tell you how admirable that is. You're right, I shouldn't forgive you because there's nothing to forgive. You did nothing wrong."
Dean unlocks the doors and Cas lays down the sheet on the back seat, carefully setting the chicken cage on top of it, which Dean appreciates so much.
Cas ducks his head, worry flowing through him at how Dean will react. He bites his lip, stalls as long as he can, then finally just says it.
After a couple more strokes, Cas slid his hand up and then down past the elastic of his sweatpants, reaching his hand down into his pants.
"Dean" Cas gasped again, more urgently. Dean just hummed "mhmm". He knew Cas was about to come, he could feel his thighs tightening, both hands gripping the sheets, knuckles white.
Dean makes a stop downtown and a group of three guys gets on. Young guys, early twenties probably, college age. The type of guys who think they rule the world and everyone around them wants them. They're loud and obnoxious and Dean cannot wait until they get off.
"I'm really glad you're here." Cas says, surprising himself. But he means it, so he let's it hang there and just holds on until the doctor comes in.
He's fucking forward into Cas' fist, and back as Cas' cock runs between his legs, over his perineum, catching on his hole, and the extra stimulation has Dean rocketing toward the end quickly.
The longer Cas sat there, the more uncomfortable he got, with the wetness in his pants. He knew he'd left his clothes in Dean's room, but he didnt want to go in there, especially while Dean was like this.
Deepening the kiss, Dean felt her slide her hand around his hip. Thoughts of Cas' hands on him flitting through his mind.
She doesn't even think about it before nodding. "Of course. The Love Of Your Life." She says it like it's Cas' official title, which almost makes him laugh.
Dean nods. "Okay." His shoulders slump in rejection. When he starts to move away, Cas' hand shoots out of it's own accord, grabbing onto Dean's arm to stop him. Then the words are flowing out of him.
Cas flicks his eyes to Dean, then away quickly. "I may have, uh, said someone else's name at a very inopportune time."
Dean can see Cas is getting aggravated, but he turns to Dean and with a tight voice asks "would you like me to have them remake yours, sir?"
Dean smirked around Cas, grabbed ahold of his ass, and plunged him into his mouth again, while stroking himself faster.
"Hello, Dean." Cas says, and Dean's mouth quirks up in a small smile. Cas' hands slide down to Dean's neck, and then they're just standing there, so close, staring into each others eyes and it feels like he's finally
Cas sits on the floor of his room and pulls another box towards himself. They've been officially moved in since Monday, four days now, and it feels like the stacks of boxes are never ending. Once the box is open, he looks inside and sighs, standing and picking it up. He takes it down the hall and knocks on the door at the other end.
Jesus, Dean fucked this up. He didn't even mean to say it, it was just a random thought in his head, a feeling, and he still has yet to learn to think before he speaks.
Dean watched as Cas went around to the trunk, opening it and pulling something out. Walking around to the front of the car, he laid a blanket on the ground and set a cooler and a bag to the side of it.
Dean placed his hand on Cas' chest to keep him from moving. He smiled. "Nothing happened Cas. Nothing bad at least. I'm just... I'm just happy. I dont know man. I'm not good with these things. But seeing you there, seeing the pleasure I gave you. It just makes me happy."
"I'm sorry, Cas" Emma says. "But I'm not leaving here until I know my best friend is fine." She has her patented determined look on as she stares Cas down.
. Fuck, yes." Cas' hands grip Dean's hips again, and he plants his feet on the bed and thrust up into Dean each time he bounces down.
He updates them on Claire and says she's healing well and they've told them she should be able to go home today but she won't be back in school for at least a few days. Emma promises to get her work for her, and yet again Cas is so grateful they're in their lives.
"Its alright Cas, hes just pissed because he doesn't like me to know certain things about his personal affairs. But let's face it Dean, I already knew. Ive known for years, I've just been waiting for you guys to pull your heads out of your asses and do something about it." Sam took a small bite of his pizza.
They're halfway through dinner, the usual "how was school" "fine" "how's homework" "fine" "how's Emma" "fine" exhausted, and they're eating quietly when Claire actually starts a conversation, which is unusual.
Cas obliged, shoving his tongue into Dean's mouth. Dean slid his hand behind Cas' head, wrapping his fingers in his hair.
"I'd be a LARPing virgin for one, which I could most definitely live with." Dean says, but he has a teasing smile on his face. Cas has absolutely no idea what that means, but seeing Dean smile so fondly at someone makes butterflies flutter in his stomach.
Fern Guy looks ashamed when he answers. "I did, I'm sorry. It was not my intention, but I had no choice." And fuck, that voice is nice.
Cas leaned his head down and placed another kiss on Dean's lips, then he looked down into his eyes. "Me being in a male vessel is a problem for you."
Charlie sits next to him, gives him a minute, then gets right to the point. "Alright, what happened and where's Emma?"
"I could tell." Cas says. When he looks away again, it feels awkward and Dean realizes he hasn't answered the question.
"Cas?" Dean looks even more nervous now. He should say something. "I am so fucking sorry I hid this from you. I promise I'll tell you everything from now on. Please, just... you have to believe me."
He parks in Cas' driveway, locks the car up, and heads down the road to wait at the bus stop. It'll still be at least 10 minutes before the bus gets there, with it's other stops, but Dean doesn't care. He's thrumming with excitement at seeing Cas again, the little bit of time away from him making him want more.
"Just, ugh, fuck" Dean rubs the bridge of his nose, headache forming at the strain of the day. "Tell me Gabe doesn't know why I left. I really, I just... just tell me that please."
His nervous energy is wearing on him, so he heads outside and gets to work again, setting an alarm this time. He's determined to be better, if Dean doesn't cancel again. Determined to be less absentminded, more focused on him.
Silently, they leave the workshop, and make their way around the house. It's stopped raining, and the air is fresh and crisp in Dean's lungs.
"Cas" Dean moaned, pulling up to kiss him again. Suddenly Dean pulled Cas flush with himself and rolled them over so he was now on top of Cas.
Dean drove the long road in silence, thoughts of Cas flitting across his mind. The way Cas looked at him, touched him, made him feel something for once.
Most of the messages he'd received had been awful, some pretty obvious that they just wanted sex, and some downright disgusting.
"Dean" Cas moans into his mouth, he wants to tell him he's close, that he's going to come if they don't stop, but Dean holds tighter to him, thrusts up against him and the words are lost.
Dean pulled into the lot of the bar, parking in the same spot he'd parked the other night. He shut off the car and turned to Cas. "You're okay?" He asked.
', and settling back down into her nest. "That's very helpful, thank you." Cas says, rolling his eyes at himself. Talking to the damn chicken again, he really needs to get out more.
Cas clings tighter, putting his whole body into the kiss, and Dean can feel arousal curl in his stomach. Cas is kissing him like it's the last thing he'll ever do, and Dean wants him, wants to feel every inch of him under his hands, taste all of him.
"Have you seen Dean?" Cas knows he sounds frantic and desperate, because he is. He has to get a hold of him, explain himself, he
"Castiel," Michael starts, trying to reach out again, but Cas just sees red and pushes him away again.
Jesus fucking christ he fucked Cas' life up so bad. Dean throws himself back on the couch and let's the guilt wash over him from the knowledge that he sent Cas into a downward spiral of drugs and alcohol that lead to him doubting who he was.
"Dont be sorry Cas. I'm glad I heard it. I'm glad to know how you feel. I just cant yet." Dean responded.
When he'd first seen it, it spoke to him. Rusted black metal, swirling designs through the armrests. But it's the backrest that really drew him in, made him feel connected. A design of feathers, intertwining throughout each other so they look as if they're floating, spinning and twirling around each other.
Dean wakes to his brother standing over him. "You've gotta get up, you're going to be late for work."
"You, Dean Winchester, are an infuriating, beautiful, brilliant man and I would very much like to get to know you more." Cas presses his body even closer, until their lips are mere centimeters apart. "Now, my ride will be here shortly, and I would like to kiss you before I go."
: Are you aware that you paid me for at least five hours of work when I only did an hour and a half?
"Right." Dean replies. He wishes he knew what else to say. Wishes he could apologize for everything that happened, for making Cas hate him, and for making everything so uncomfortable.
"I know." Cas sighs. "I know the odds are highly improbable that something would happen again. I'm being ridiculous and I know it, I just can't help it."
"Dont Cas" Dean said, backing away and shaking his head. "Dont." He turned around, quickly opening the door to his room, and shut it in Cas' face.
He mentally shakes himself out of it, and nods toward the girls who have settled at the kitchen table. "Kids. The second your back is turned, the true snark comes out."
What? Cas is trying to sort through everything Dean just said in his head, because none of it is connecting. "I don't understand."
"Not just the sex, Dean, though that really was incredible. Just, you, you're amazing." Cas said, running his hand along Dean's arm.
He stepped closer to Cas, hooking his thumbs into the waistband of his pants, and slid them down. Cas stepped out of them. Then Dean did the same to his own, until they were both standing there in nothing but their underwear.
Dean slides Cas over to the side, heads into the ensuit, cleans himself and comes back with a washcloth. Cas' eyes are closed, and when Dean starts cleaning him up, Cas peeks one eye open and looks down at him. "I can do that." He says with a sleepy smile.
Dean shrugged. "I told Cas last night, before you got back, that I thought you two would get along."
"You wanna hang out? I've still gotta make dinner, but I'm gonna be here surrounded by a bunch of teenage girls, and I could use some backup. Though, Em's got a new tv in her room so I'm not sure I'll even see them again after they eat, especially with Charlie up there." Dean says, hopeful. Hanging out, or even just texting with Cas has become something he looks forward to.
"Now you just need..." she turned toward the dresser, digging through the drawers, and pulling out a pair of tight, black skinny jeans from the back of the bottom drawer.
He sees Claire perk up, but Cas cuts her off before any words even leave her mouth. "Thank you for the offer, Dean, but I believe Claire has some boxes to unpack." When he gives her a look, she deflates but nods. "Thank you for lunch, but we should get going now."
Not only does it fucking hurt, but it's gross as hell seeing as hundreds of people are walking over it daily, and who knows when the last time it was actually mopped was. Sputtering, Dean clambers to his knees and crawls after the asshole.
They're laying in Cas' bed, still naked and sated, facing each other. Their faces inches apart, staring into each other's eyes, breathing each other's breaths. Dean's right hand is tracing patterns on Cas' left shoulder, the side of his face, his neck. Cas' left fingers are leaving trails of goosebumps along Dean's hip and stomach, down to his thigh and up his back.
Dead closed his eyes, resting his head back on Cas' chest. He felt Cas' hand move up into his hair again, softly running his fingers through.
Realizing Dean isn't going to take the money back, Cas folds the envelope and sticks it in his pocket, and Dean drops his hands. "I have a masters in financial accounting. It's what I've done for a living since college. Trust me, it wasn't that easy for me at first."
Looking at the time, Dean heads into the restaurant. It's a nice place, not extremely fancy, but nice enough that the waitstaff is wearing slacks and a maroon buttondown covered by a black waistcoat and maroon tie. The aesthetic is nice, and Dean's already impressed that Gordon picked this place.
Dean's eyes are scanning the room, then come to rest back on Cas. He can see Dean loosen up a little the longer they stare at each other. "I want you." Dean says, then pulls Cas against him into a searing kiss.
Dean's really happy that she's making friends. It's been just him and Em for so long that he wonders often if he's doing right by her. But she gets good grades, she never gets in trouble at school, and she seems genuinely happy most of the time, barring normal teenage girl stuff, so he figures he's doing something right.
"Ah, no." Cas replies. "I let each of my nieces name one. Lunch, Ellen Deheneres, and McPeep. I named the fourth one Heather."
They've been living together for a little over a month now, and not much has changed, even though everything has. When Dean's landlord had informed him that he was selling the house Dean had been renting, and that Dean had 2 weeks to move out, Cas had offered up his spare bedroom.
"I'm gonna pick you up and bring you to the car. It's gonna hurt but I need you to just hold onto me, okay?"
Gordon is in the middle of telling an anecdote about a time he went camping with some friends, when Cas comes back with their meals. He sets them down, and Dean makes an appreciative comment because damn it looks good.
The office gives him aftercare instructions and antibiotic and pain meds. He pays the fee for her visit, which is an insanely high amount, but worth it, and he collects his chicken. She looks okay, seems a little lethargic which they say is normal, but she looks at him and seems happy, or as happy as a chicken can look.
"Sure sweetheart, what do you need done." Dean says, walking over and taking the tool from Cas' hands. Cas shows him what he needs sanded down, and after a short kiss Dean gets to work.
On top of that, the stupid chicken is standing directly in front of him, squawking. "Gotcha." Dean says with a nod, and turns around taking the last few steps to the car. It shouldn't feel this shitty. It was just a date.
"Look, it's fine. I'm sorry if I snapped at you, I was just surprised and it's been a long day. I don't mind giving you a ride." Dean says sincerely.
"I did. A woman went into labor, her water broke, so I took her to the hospital. I was only fifteen minutes behind and got back on schedule pretty fast." Dean says, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
Within a minute, Emma's back and Dean is calling Cas' number while the girls make a path and he pulls his shoes on.
Slumping against the closed door, Cas closes his eyes and let's his head fall back as tears start to sting in them. What has he done? He's such an asshole. He knows how Dean feels about Michael, he knows what Michael put him through, and yet he brought him back here anyway. He could've possibly just ruined their friendship, over what? Something that meant nothing.
Dean shook his head again. "I was stupid. So stupid. Cas, please believe me. I will never do anything like that again. I... I want..." It was hard for Dean to get the words out. 'Say it' he thought to himself. Letting out a hard breath, he said "I want to kiss you." 'Not what I was supposed to say' he thought in his head.
"I really don't mind, as long as you're comfortable with it." Dean says, pulling his car out onto the street toward Cas'.
Cas reached over and gripped the side of the table with his right hand, biting down on his lip harder. It was taking everything he had not to thrust his hips up into Dean's hand. Not to reach over and pull Dean into his lap, crushing their lips together.
Cas' heart is pounding hard against his ribs, and he can feel his hands shaking a little where they're clinging to Dean.
He can feel Dean getting close, blunt nails digging into his back, breathing faster. Dean throws his head back in pleasure as he spills over Cas' fist, calling his name, and Cas follows right behind, cock pulsing inside Dean as he fills the condom, muffled cries into Dean's shoulder.
"Okay, okay, I'm going." Dean said. He grabbed his robe off the back of the door and headed to the shower room.
"Wow, okay, nice. I get the batman comment now." Charlie says, and he has no idea what to make of that.
Dean sits in the car for several minutes before he drags himself inside. Cas isn't there, so he's sure he's outside working. Dean isn't supposed to be home for several more hours, and he wonders if he should just wait it out. He promised himself he'd stop putting all his problems on Cas, but this is more than just a work problem, it's now a lack of work problem.
Dean is baffled. That was not even close to anything he'd expected to be said. And then it hits him, Cas is embarrassed about this. He's standing there blushing and nervous and didn't want to say anything because he thought Dean would judge him for it. This has probably happened before with past relationships, and it didn't go well.
He shakes himself out of his frozen state, and reaches for the door to close it. He can't do this, especially not right now.
Jesus, when had she gotten so good at using his words against him? "Haven't you ever heard the saying 'do as I say, not as I do'?" He mumbles, while resolutely turning the truck off.
"Harry Potter, again?!" He mumbled to himself, looking at the TV. "That's what I get for telling Sammy to pick. I'm an idiot."
Dean nodded, and rolled off Cas. He reached down and tried to unbutton his pants, but struggled, the booze and tiredness winning out.
There's a noise to the side of them, and they both look over to see a chicken, with dyed red head feathers, standing on the work bench, watching them. Cas laughs. "I really don't know how she keeps getting in here." He says fondly.
"That won't be necessary." Cas says, walking to the desk and leaning his butt against it, facing Dean. "But thank you. For this" Cas holds the money out. "And for apologizing."
"Let's go upstairs," Dean says, voice lower than normal sending a jolt straight through Cas' body. Cas nods, then slides out of the car to follow Dean into the building.
When he sees what it is, he opens the door fully and steps out, extremely confused. Dean is to the side of the porch, wood and mallet in hand.
Ignoring him, Dean makes his way further into the apartment, intent on getting this over with and not saying a word.
Dean is sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, hoping a change of scenery will help, when he hears the doorbell.
"There are things more important than a party." Emma says, and Dean is so damn proud of her he wants to cry.
Dean laughed. "What are you doing that has you so entranced by that screen that you dont want me to see?"
Dean approached the table, walking around to Cas' side, and plopping down into the chair next to him. "So, you guys up for a movie? I need to do some unwinding" he said.
"I replaced her with you. I thought maybe you'd understand. And then you got up there, and started singing. And that song..." Dean stepped even closer, until there was almost no space between them. Cas' hands were still hanging limply by his sides. "I thought... please don't tell me I'm wrong about this."
He doesn't really think about the fact that it's just after 10 in the morning and they're probably still closed until he's pulling into the parking lot, but there's a neon sign in the window that says open so he parks and goes inside.
Dean glanced at Sam to see his reaction, but he didnt seem to care. What the hell. Whenever he ate grease, Sam was always on his ass about it. Of course, he did get something from her last night.
So basically, he's just gotten 2 jobs, thanks to Dean, while sitting in bed, when he'd been around town for over three hours the other day and got nothing.
"It's Claire, there's something wrong." She says, and Dean's down the hall and into her room before she's even finished talking.
Dean stared into Cas' bright blue eyes. The eyes he'd had many dreams about. The eyes that now looked at him with concern.
anymore. He could tell Cas, but the thought of that makes his heart rate spike just thinking about it. All the risks he'd be taking, if Cas doesn't feel the same way. Part of him believes it'd be worth it, with the slim chance that Cas feels the same, but risking losing what they have, he's not sure he can do it.
Attempting to control his laughter, Dean shook his head. "Dont look at me Sammy, Cas is the one who let the cat out of the bag."
"I missed you too." Dean's hand runs along Cas' stomach. "Do you think..." Dean stops there, and Cas looks down at him. Dean looks back up, and shifts. "Do you think you could come home?" He asks quietly.
Dean nods, but it's more of a placating gesture than anything else. "Sure, alright." Though he's positive that once he walks away, he'll never hear from Cas again. He's just a nice guy, doesn't want to hurt Dean's feelings or whatever. Fuck feelings, and fuck dating. This kind of shit is why he stopped. "Well, enjoy your bus ride." He says, and pushes past Cas to continue on to his car.
Courtney nodded. "Okay. I just... " She nervously chuckled. "I don't want you to think I'm a slut. Or easy. Or whatever they call it these days. First, trying to pick you up. Then your brother. That's not me. At least, not usually."
Dean pulled himself up off the floor and looked at Cas, who was standing there, panting, and looking completely sexed out. It was probably the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.
"Yeah" Dean huffs an unamused laugh. "Yeah, seriously. It was that, or move out, and I just… I couldn't not say anything anymore. Got this stupid fucking flower and everything." He shakes his head and looks down into his lap. "I got there, and he comes out of his room, looking all," Dean waves his hand around, "ya know? And I'm gonna tell him, and I'm nervous as hell, but he looks so good and I know it's gonna be okay."
Dean is trembling and moaning and pushing down against his fingers and by the time he gets a third one in Dean is babbling and begging and it's turning Cas on even more. His own cock is throbbing and leaking between his legs, and he wants to be inside Dean so fucking bad but he holds himself off and works to stretch Dean out even more until he can get a fourth one in.
They sit in silence for a while, Cas unsure of what else to say, before the girls come into the kitchen. He looks over at them and notes Claire's face is red and she looks sad.
It starts slow, gentle, nice. Dean's hands settling on Cas' hips, Cas' other hand on Dean's neck, body pressed against his front. Cas' lips are warm and soft, and butterflies kick up in Dean's stomach. It's been so long since he's even been kissed, let alone kissed well, and this is perfect.
Cas tells them he'll be back with their meals soon, giving both Dean and Gordon a look before walking away.
"Dean" he replied, grasping her hand and giving it a small shake. "Nice to meet you." Dean picked up his glass and took a small drink from it. "Havent seen you here before." He said.
Dean walked past Cas, over to his desk, where he grabbed a bottle of whiskey and a glass. Holding the glass up to Cas with a questioning head tilt.
Cas started to speed up his thrusts, causing Dean to grab onto him again, digging his nails into his back. He heard Cas moan his name, causing his untouched cock between them to throb.
Dean gripped tight to Cas' hand as he felt him moving inside him. Slowly, the pain faded away, and was replaced by pleasure.
Cas pushed his hips down against Dean, and he felt Cas' hardness press against his own, eliciting another moan. Cas did it again, wanting to hear that noise again, the noise he was causing Dean to make.
Dean stood there, adjusting his clothes for a few more minutes, before he picked up his phone and looked at the time. It was a minute till 7, 'better get moving' he thought. He shoved his phone and wallet in his pocket, and took one last look in the mirror.
Breathlessly, Cas pulled his head back "Dean-". But Dean wasnt listening. He attacked Cas' neck with his mouth, attempting to pull him even closer. He could feel Cas breathing hard against him. Cas tried again. "Dean, wait. We still need to talk about this."
Worried that it's too soon, he hasn't brought it up yet, but he wants to. Dean spends so much time at Cas' house as it is, and when he's not there, Cas wants him to be. He only worries he'll scare Dean away by rushing too fast.
"Get your things and leave, now," Cas says again, stomping to his bedroom. He snatches up Michael's shirt and shoes, pushing them into his hands, and shoves him towards the door. Michael doesn't have a chance to respond, stunned as he's forcibly pushed through the door and Cas slams it in his face.
Sammy was right, he needed to fix this, but he didnt know where to start. So he started with the easy stuff. He got out of bed and pulled everything off of it, bundling it up and throwing it in the bottom of his closet to be washed later. Then he replaced it with fresh bedding.
"As much as my parents disapproved of having a child out of wedlock, their help is the only reason we made it. I think, because Amelia had passed, they were more accepting. I was able to finish school, and give Claire the best life I could. Unfortunately, once it came out that I'm gay, and that had to happen eventually, they cut off all contact and we haven't spoken since."
"No!" Cas says vehemently. "No, that's not it, I promise. I had a great time and I'd really like to do it again."
Dean nods again, and before Cas even registers what he's doing, he's pressed against Dean, kissing him. It's a grateful kiss, a thank you for being so kind and understanding and wonderful. And for making something that he will cherish forever.
"Okay Sammy. Its fine, I was just messing with you." Dean said seriously. "I'm actually kind of glad."
They talk about their families, both with one brother. Their work, Dean knows what Cas does but he explains it more, how he's actually a chef but backed off a bit when things at the restaurant started picking up and he was needed in the owner capacity more and more. Dean explains his car restoration business, and Cas listens intently even though he admits he doesn't know much about cars. It's nice, simple, and perfect, exactly the kind of evening Dean was hoping to have when he'd come out tonight.
Cas stroked himself up and down several more times, his heart pounding in his ears. Thoughts of Dean's hands and mouth all over his body pushing him closer to the edge of where he wanted to be.
He never wants it to end, but his emotional exhaustion is overpowering his want, and he knows Dean has to be feeling the same. They part slowly, with sweet light kisses until they're resting their foreheads together with eyes closed and just soaking up the other's presence.
Dean turns to Fern Guy. "Look, I gotta get this bus back now otherwise my ass is getting reamed. You're coming with, and I will take you home myself." He sighs, and lightens his tone, rubbing a hand down his face. "If that's okay with you. Otherwise I can take you to your stop and just deal with it."
Dean heads to work on the afternoon, dreading it more and more every mile he gets closer to the station. He hates this, hates feeling like everything is forced, like he's pushing himself just to go to work. It's miserable. He wants to be home with Cas, not dealing with asshole people and their asshole complaints.
This was the same bar they'd met at the other night, as it was the only one in town. Dean didnt know how Cas would feel about it. "Cas, man, if you dont want to-"
"Sammy, grab some beers from the kitchen, would ya?" Dean asked, walking over to the drink cart. Cas followed behind him, watching him pour amber liquid into 4 glasses.
They found her already at the bookshelves, pulling out leather bound books, and staring at them open mouthed. "I've died and gone to heaven."
Cas approaches him a minute later, a curious look on his face. "Look, I want to apologize, but can we go somewhere where half the restaurant isn't looking at me?" Dean asks, glancing around again.
He needs to talk to someone. The only person, aside from Sam, who knows what happened. His best friend.
Cas deepend the kiss this time, unapologetically shoving his tongue into Dean's mouth. Dean groaned, and slid his hands up Cas' back, trying to get past all the layers. Realizing Cas was still wearing that damn trench coat, and getting any closer was a futile effort, he moved his hands up and slid it off his shoulders, taking the suit jacket with it, until Cas was in just his white button up shirt. Dean was finally able to push his hands up the back of Cas shirt, feeling his skin.
Courtney looked down at her plate, then back up at Dean. "You can actually cook" she said, looking impressed.
Hed promised Dean he wouldnt say the words until he was ready, so Cas put every ounce of love he felt into that kiss.
Cas leaned down, pressing his lips to Dean's again, as he lined himself up and slowly pushed in. Dean's tight heat enveloped him, and he couldn't stop the gasp that escaped his lips. "Dean, fuck you feel so good."
They were perfect, Dean was perfect. It was only ten months, but they were the most life changing moments of his existence. Dean was his first everything. When he'd gone, just up and disappeared one day without a word, Cas didn't think he'd ever recover from the heartbreak.
A zing of arousal courses through Cas' body, straight to his cock. He didn't know he'd enjoy this until today, and now he doesn't think he'll ever want anything more than he wants to see Dean in those panties right now.
He continued his path downwards, until he hit the top of Dean's pants. He looked up at Dean, who was looking back at him with such desire in his eyes.
Claire makes them promise that they can have a do over sleepover as soon as she's feeling better, and they set a tentative time for a week later which Cas thinks is too soon, but Dean quietly tells him that if she's not up for it he'll make an excuse to push it back, and once again Cas is appreciative and overwhelmed by Dean's thoughtfulness.
"It really wasn't a big deal, and only took me an hour and a half. You don't need to pay me." Cas says, trying to hand the envelope back.
Sighing again, Cas slowly stood up from the table. Not looking at Sam, he walked around the table towards the hall.
He hadn't known. He knew John was a drunk, that he was hardly ever around, and that they barely got by, but he had no idea he'd been violent. Dean apparently hid that very well, because he really had no clue.
Back at the table, he set the beer in front of Dean. When Dean tried to turn toward him, Anna grabbed his arm, diverting Dean's attention back to her. This was going to be a long fucking night.
"Getting me drunk isn't going to get me up on that stage, Dean." Cas said, already reaching for the liquor.
"She was my dad's." Dean says fondly, watching Cas run his hand along her shiny black frame. "I rebuilt her at one point, after an accident totaled her."
Once he was done with his tasks, he stood up and turned to Dean. Dean watched as Cas stared at him. He looked a little unsure, worried that Dean wouldnt like this.
As Cas approached Dean's bedroom door, he hesitated. Not sure why he was so unsure, as he and Dean had just kissed, twice, he waited a full minute before he knocked.
"Why would he tell you?" Cas asks. He really does want to know. Though Gabriel has been butting into this, he's been on Cas' side, respecting his choices even while trying to discuss what's happened.
"Manners, Claire. Seriously, did I teach you nothing?" Cas says. It's embarrassing, is what it is. She acts like she's never been to someone else's house before. He supposes it has been a while. For either of them.
Dean stared at it, so many thoughts going through his head. Cas really put a lot of thought into this. Hed done research, and picked something he thought Dean would enjoy. This was the most thoughtful thing anyone had done for him in a long time. Maybe ever.
"It was enough of my fault for me to feel like complete shit after he told me all that. Even worse than I did before."
He likes Dean, a lot. He likes his energy, and his stupid jokes that he doesn't understand most of the time. He likes what Dean brings into his life, things he didn't even realize he was missing until Dean.
Dean stepped foward again. Cas was trapped. He supposed he could have pushed past Dean, and doubted Dean would stop him, but he didn't.
Cas leaned in, pressing his body flush against Dean's. He put his face against Deans ear, whispering "dont forget again" and bit down on Dean's earlobe.
Cas held onto the back of Dean's head, throwing his own head back to give Dean more access. He could feel his already partially hard member, growing harder by the second, pressing into Dean.
"I'm here to pick up my daughter." Cas says, and fuck if his voice didn't get deeper and sexier with age.
Dean's had a decent day at work. Not good, not bad, just normal. He's on his way to his car from the bus terminal when his phone rings.
Cas rolls his eyes at her almost slip of the tongue. "It doesn't matter, it was a long time ago." If he's being honest with himself, it does matter. But, since he has no idea why what happened did happen, it's pointless to get into that right now.
There was a knock on the door. Dean looked at it, then walked over, preparing to tell whoever it was he was busy. He was not about to be late for his and Cas' first... date.
"That doesn't make it okay. I don't want you lying to me." He says, really disappointed in her. He doesn't say no often, so when she feels the need to lie it really gets to him.
"Yeah. This life doesnt provide much time for... dates." He said, just standing there. That word was still a bit hard to get out.
Dean stops, his heart in his throat, stunned by the words Cas just shouted at him. He slowly turns around, and takes in Cas' rumpled appearance, the bags beneath his eyes, the heartbreak on his face. "What?"
"So" Courtney said, and Dean almost jumped, it had been so long since anyone had spoken. "What kind of monsters do you hunt?"
"Thank you Doctor Mills." Cas replies, shaking her hand. She nods and walks away, and Cas turns to Dean for a second then looks away, biting his lip. "I guess we should go."
Dean reached his hand over and grasped ahold of Cas', intertwining their fingers, and pulled Cas closer to his side.
"That's okay." Cas says as he stops at the end of the bed. "What happened? I got your voicemail, I'm so sorry it took me so long." It hurts to see his daughter in a hospital bed, and he's trying really hard to keep it together.
"I'd like to meet them before sending my daughter in there." He replies, like that should be obvious.
Before Dean knew it, the movie was over. He remembered bits and pieces of it, but he was so caught up in his own thoughts he really didnt pay too much attention. Dean hit the remote so the movie stopped, and looked over at Sam in the chair, who was slumped down with his feet up. He was sound asleep. Dean looked the other way at Cas "guess hes wiped out. I thought hed want to watch the next one."
Dean should be the one freaking out, really. In true Dean Winchester fashion, at any sign or word of serious commitment, he's usually gone. And really, it did scare him at first. But, it's
Dean was elbow deep in grease when he heard the garage door open. He looked up, and watched as Courtney crossed the room, this time fully clothed in what she was wearing last night.
The friction was incredible. Feeling Cas' hard body beneath his own, the noises Cas was making into his mouth, as he unmercifully stroked Cas faster. Dean bit down on Cas' bottom lip, sucking it into his mouth, then pushing his tongue back into Cas' mouth.
A moment later, he felt someone pressed to his side, and looked up into Dean's face, only inches from his own. "You couldn't wait for me to get done?" Dean asked jokingly, gesturing to the shot glasses.
Hope wells in his chest again, but this time he doesn't push it down. He let's it fill him, grasping onto it, relishing in the first thing he's felt in weeks that isn't pain or anger.
And then they're really kissing, and it's wonderful and beautiful and so perfect. Dean's lips are soft and warm against his, and when Dean dips is tongue into Cas' mouth and grips his hips to pull them tighter together, Cas moans his assent.
After Cas stumbles out of bed at the bright and early time of 8am, downs his minimum 2 cups of coffee, skims the morning news, and wakes Claire up, he finally pulls Dean's business card out of his pants pocket where he'd tossed them on the floor the night before.
"'Thanks dad' 'oh you're welcome honey, glad I could make you happy'" Cas mumbles to himself, finishing his meal. But really, if getting ice cream makes her that excited, how is he supposed to say no.
Lunch has moved back outside with her sisters, and Cas' livingroom is now sadly empty. He'd thought about keeping her in there longer, but it really wasn't fair to keep her penned up inside with only his sorry ass for company, when she should be out enjoying herself. So he'd reacquainted her with the other chickens, and is now as alone as ever. Maybe he should get a cat, but that probably wouldn't work well with the chickens.
It's silent for a minute or two. "Oh my god! You guys dated!" When Cas nods affirmatively, Claire says "I didn't know he's gay."
Dean all but growled in response, jumping out of his chair. He bent over Cas, grabbed the back of his neck, and smashed his lips onto on his. Forcing his tongue into Cas' mouth, he moaned as Cas wrapped his arms around him.
Dean felt it. He felt the love that Cas had for him. He felt the need and want that Cas had to be close to him.
"Alright, if you need anything call me." He says to Charlie, as he makes his way across the room. Emma's by his side, and he looks down at her. "I'm sorry, sweetie. I'll be back as soon as I can."
Once they're in the room, Cas starts pulling at Dean's clothes again, and Dean does the same to Cas until they're both naked, and Dean is pushing Cas back onto his bed. Cas scoots up until he's centered, and Dean stares down at him, taking a moment to appreciate the beautiful man spread out naked on his bed before he climbs up over him, bringing their lips back together in a passionate kiss.
"No man, I'm not doing that. I'm going." Dean stood up, already walking towards the door. He didn't look back, knowing what he'd find on Cas' face.
He was right, and it doesn't take him that long. Within an hour and a half, he's found two places where the numbers were transposed, he's fixed it, and everything matches.
Cas stopped walking, but didn't turn around. This was bad. Maybe he could just blame it on the alcohol. Or run home and pretend he didn't remember any of this tomorrow. Fuck, how could he be so stupid. And why the fuck had Dean come on stage? What the hell did this mean?
"That, too, is a long story. But it seems as if my daughter is not coming back any time soon, so I guess we have time." Cas bites his lip and shifts around to get comfortable.
That was three weeks ago. Three painful, torturously slow, lonely weeks. After he'd stayed with his brother a few days (he couldn't stay there long, he knew Dean would come there), he'd found the small apartment. He'd changed his phone number, and cut off contact with anyone except his brother, and even that contact was few and far between.
Cas slowly moved forward, and took ahold of Dean's hand. Silently, he let him down the hall to his room.
"I appreciate your cooking, Dean. Even if I dont eat it, it's still nice that you do it." Cas said looking at him.
The pain's too much. A part of him is gone, a very large part of him that he will never get back. He never would've thought his marriage would end this way. Hell, he never thought his marriage would end. He thought they'd been happy. That they'd grow old together, have kids, and grandkids, maybe great-grandkids. Retire, and spend their days working around the house, and their evenings curled up in each others arms, until the end.
He's shaking, his heart is pounding, and he's never been so relieved and crushed and furious all at the same time.
Cas thrust into him hard, and a burst of pleasure shot through Dean's whole body, which caused him to let out a loud moan.
"So, what is this exactly?" She asks, pointing between the two of them. So much for he and Cas talking about it first.
Naomi looks down at some papers on her desk, shuffles them around, and looks back at him. "It seems as if you went off your route today" she says. It's not a question, but Dean answers anyway.
This is leading to sex. Dean wants sex, and god Cas does too, but he's never done that before. He's never even come close until now, and he doesn't know what to do, or how to do it. He's going to be terrible and Dean's going to regret all of this.
When Cas opened the door, Dean had to take a moment to straighten out his thoughts. Cas stood there in black slacks and a button down black dress shirt that was slightly open at the top. It looked like he'd tried to tame his hair, but had only made it more messy, which, if Dean was being honest, was hot as fuck.
Sam turned around in his chair and looked at his brother "oh yeah, you know us, a couple of chicks" he said.
He tells her. He tells her that Cas has a date and he'd really thought they'd be able to just start over but that was never even a thought in Cas' head. He let's only two tears slip out, and then he pulls his shit together and heads to the kitchen, because this is Emma's day and he's gonna make it as damn near perfect as he can no matter how he's feeling.
Charlie pulls her eyes away from the girls, and sets them on Cas. "Holy blue eyes, batman. You are one hot dude." She says, and Cas can feel his face grow warm.
Dean sighs. "I came home from work one day, and she was just gone. Emma was with a babysitter, some teenager I didn't even know, and there was a note. It basically said sorry, I never wanted the kid, yeah that's what she called her, and only did it to make you happy, and it's my turn to be happy. We haven't heard from her since, aside from divorce papers and court papers assigning me full custody, that arrived in the mail a few weeks later with no return address."
