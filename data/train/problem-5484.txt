care, probably. It meant so, so much to have a new set of people who smiled at him and delivered those little touches that were everything to him. It was amazing to have people who didn't flinch back from his own tactile nature, but allowed him into their space freely instead.
"I think he'd like that," Tony whispered, grief etched onto his face. The moments when it was visible were fewer and farther between, but the loss of his oldest son was still something he felt keenly. Some days were worse than others, and Steve worried that maybe this conversation would turn this into a bad day. "Nobody else--" he stopped himself to clear his throat, then swiped carelessly at his eyes. "Only me, Steve and the other kids have left something. Pep and Rhodey talked about maybe... but they're busy. And they never--"
Comments warm my soul greatly even though lately I've been crap at responding to them. Thanks so much for reading! :D
All he ever saw when he looked at Harley was that kid who had busted into Tony's room, terrified and furious.
Then I want to maybe do some newspaper article type things, or some transcripts from interviews? Maybe some communications back and forth from the two teams? 'Cause in this version Thanos doesn't come for another three years, so I gotta get my bbys to that point. XD
"Think you might be the only one besides Buck who'd rather cuddle with skinny Stevie than Captain America. After the serum everyone wanted to... I dunno. Got lots of 'cuddles' after that."
Which was when Rogers lunged forward again, that 'I could do this all day' attitude ruining the moment - again. "Hey!" His startled cry got Steve looking in the right direction just in time. Instead of being taken down by the big idiot's rush to his legs, he was able to side-step and then catch Rogers right in the ribs. The blow was clearly a lot harder than it looked, because Rogers went flying. This time Steve went after him, pressing his advantage.
Shellhead would probably love a giant stuffed rabbit. He was a little bummed Steve had nixed the idea. Pepper had taken the 'no more giant rabbits, Tony' side of things and Rhodey had been quick to jump ship. Only STAR had agreed with him, which really just showed how democracy was broken.
"First off, I ain't no clone. Sooner ya get that through your fat head the better. Nat here oughta know better, so I dunno why she let ya talk her inta this."
"I'm okay right now." Tony weakly punched his arm when he snorted in disbelief, but his eyes were crinkled in silent laughter. "I mean it I... it hurts all the time right now, but this isn't any worse than if I was laying by myself. Having you here just means instant help when I want to shift positions. Usually I have to buzz someone up from the medical floor."
"My Anthony has been very nearly desolate. You two were so close, and then you were suddenly gone. He may understand the reasoning for it, but it doesn't change the way he feels. And he very much feels abandoned. Your prolonged and completely unnecessary silence did not help matters."
Thanks so much for reading, comments make me all happy and giggly inside so maybe leave some if you like it? <3
"We'll speak of it after you both have taken your rest." Oops, he hadn't meant to say that out loud, and from the look on Lokes' face he knew it too. "You're both far too tired for discussion."
"Too much." Steve agreed quietly, glad he didn't need to explain. Harley and a few others might complain about the human noise and light pollution, but for him it was just... just the whole place that was too damn loud. "We used to do this."
"I scared three of them away. Viz almost gave the fourth a heart attack when he forgot about doors again. With Friday monitoring me and help no farther away than it would be in a hospital anyway, we all agreed that it would be better if nobody hung around the floor all the time. I was really mean to some of those poor people. Do you think sending an apology fruit basket that includes a note that says I've paid off their debts would work?"
"Tryin'." The word was a grunt - when he looked, Maverick was holding on to the wicked looking weapon and slamming his shield into glaive guy's face. "That lady keeps-- shit."
, which was just... fuck. That was world altering information there. "Still. I got no blackmail to give ya. You said you buy Ms. Potts shoes, right?"
And then they were gone. They left behind a silence that sat for a little while, and then Tiny Adorable Steve heaved a sigh. That was their cue to all drift away to their respective tasks. Tony though, he drifted right on over to Steve.
"Yes. No? I mean..." While searching for words, Tony turned and pressed a kiss to his palm. "It sucked," he admitted, lips tickling against Steve's skin. "It sucked a lot." A beat later, his lover hid in his neck again, a small shiver running through his body. "Metric fuck-tons of suck. But I thought it would be worse. Without you and Pepper it would have been."
at him like they were on the same side before turning her eyes to Steve, poised and ready to unleash her black widow's bite.
A weary sigh was his only answer, and he was pretty sure that poor JARVIS had had just about enough of being their go-between in moments like this. He just wished he knew what had gone wrong, and why the genius kept blowing so hot and cold. Maybe he should have pushed before now or even sent Nat snooping but he just... he really had wanted Tony to tell him what was going on in his own time.
"He says he wasn't trying to poison me, but I don't believe him. I'm telling you Cap - don't trust this man's leaf water."
"It rips me up inside, what he did," Steve told me about the Captain America of our world. "I love Tony more than anything, and to have anyone hurt him is... but it wasn't just anyone. Steve Grant was part of Tony's team, someone he trusted. Someone that looked like me. I didn't... after I found out I didn't want to be Captain America anymore, to be honest with you. That's another reason I like being Maverick better."
"Yes." The AI's firm response left no wiggle room for him to get out of this and he was proud as hell of her. "Boss was very disappointed when he realized that I was the one who told you about Captain America. I watched him cry. A lot. If I hadn't told you then you would have stayed here when Other Loki came to get you."
"I'd marry ya in a heartbeat, but not until after ya can get outta this bed and off-a these machines." A careful, calloused hand trailed down one cheek, then his neck and then made its careful way to his chest. Tony would have flinched back from anyone else - even Rhodey and Pepper had to deal with how gun shy he was now - but Tiny Adorable Steve would never hurt him. "I can't believe he did this ta ya," he whispered, anger throbbing in his voice despite his gentle touch. "Might have ta kill him after all."
All those hopes had been disappointed, and Tony had learned to live with that. He had in fact embraced it and been very determined to live down to Howard's expectations of him. The cutting remarks didn't sting as sharply, and his father's inability to see any of his good qualities didn't cut as deeply.
"Damn straight I did. Deserved more, the little punk. Thinkin' he could bust in here without even askin'. His ma's prob'ly rollin' in her grave ta see him bein' so damn rude." He ran his fingers over Tony's jaw, which had gone tight, then cupped his cheek. "Hate that he did it when he did especially. Worst timin' ever I think. Are ya... I know it had ta have been hard, seein' them. Seein' him."
So he missed it when the pair of them moved without waking up, gravitating towards each other until they were in the middle of the bed. Rhodey was afraid to so much as breath, eyes so wide they almost hurt as he put one trembling hand over his mouth. Helen had grabbed him, but this time she was clutching at his arm so hard her nails were digging into his skin just a little. Harley let out something that sounded a hell of a lot like a sob, but Rhodey couldn't take his eyes away, because what if he did and whatever was happening
. The kid had taken a gap year right after high school, then another, citing more interest in full-time Avenging than going to school. It had been a major fight in the Stark-Rogers household, one that Rhodey had ended up mediating. Talk of college had stopped soon after, though there was a dedicated account for his future education if and when he was ready to take that step.
This was late!! Of course it was, I always am. ;.; This time I have a decent excuse at least. I was in one of the sub-committees that was working on plans to re-open the school I work at which has been a very special brand of hell. There is a 65 living document now, and guidance from the governor, health department and CDC seem to change daily and often conflict, because of course they do.
It was Tony's turn to snort, and when he turned back to his work Steve wanted more than anything to just pull him into another hug. "Then maybe you weren't doing it right."
After Howard had died, Tony had been able to forget a little of that. He had other things to think about - booze and drugs, beautiful women and men who were more than happy to come to his bed. There was a company to pretend he was any good at running, weapons to be designed, wars to be won and soldiers to be protected. Even if disappointment had wrapped around his bones tightly enough that it never really went away, Tony didn't dwell on the reasons why very often. He didn't have time to think about all the ways Captain America would loathe him, and he hadn't realized how much more it would hurt now that Howard's happiness was no longer the trade-off. Hell, Tony had given up any real hope of Captain America ever being found years ago anyway.
Magneto was a son of a bitch and as soon as Tony was released from medical he was going to design a suit that could actually handle the bastard.
"Mmm. And maybe, you know. I mighta..." Tony's inquisitive, beyond-pleased hum cut through his embarrassment. And really what the fuck did he have to be embarrassed about? "I started trying to design a wedding ring for you too." The man in his arms went completely still, breath catching audibly. Hoping like hell he wasn't making a huge mistake, he swallowed hard and kept going. "Because I do want forever with you. I know I'm not... that we haven't..."
"Steven Brian Rogers, I am incredibly disappointed with you." Peggy had always been able to make him feel like his ma was scolding him. He couldn't help but wince away from her voice and the displeased purse of her blood red lips. Loki, meanwhile, was smirking as the boys rolled over to poke and prod and investigate. Probably would have made Tony crazy with worry, but he knew the mage would be gentle with the kids. "It's been months and we've heard
'That ain't who I am here. Mebbe Rogers is shit at it, but someone else from this world should take up the mantle, not me.'
pressed close. Having him so nearby started to drain some of his anxiety about that future, grounded him in the here and now. It was usually so, so hard to stay there... but Steve made it easier. Why would he want to focus on what awful thing was coming when he could feel his lover's tongue gently teasing at the seam of his lips? It was far more interesting to dwell on how the calloused fingers on his face felt as they trailed over his skin. Letting his thoughts fade into a murmur was easier than it ever had been when one of those hands went to his hair instead and began to tug at the strands
Tony hadn't talked to him for three days after he brought the dog home. He might have been more worried about that if JARVIS hadn't constantly been relaying information from him that was all about how to best take care of dogs. There'd even been a few care packages delivered, all of them with Tony's unique gift-giving flair. Steve suspected that he was worried about getting too attached only to have someone snatch the dog away. That was something he could understand, so he figured it was best to let the genius come around in his own time. JARVIS and Rhodey both agreed with him and he could afford to be patient. Especially since he had a little princess to dote on and introduce to the other Avengers.
interrupted gently. "I ain't worried about ya stealin' him if that's what ya think." He shot Steve a thankful look, only to get a smile and a wink in return.
Okay, sure, maybe he was a little jealous, but he wasn't going to punish Captain America by sticking him on a floor all by himself. It wasn't his fault Tony was the way he was. Howard had always told him it would be like this, that Captain America would take one look at him and know that he was too sensitive, not manly enough to be worth his time. He had been expecting it since he was a kid, and he could deal.
Despite that and the more modern sensibilities, Steve could also see touches that made him certain the design had been based off the motorcycle he'd driven back in the war. It was familiar without being threatening because of it, because of course Tony would understand how to straddle that line for him.
Miracle of miracles, that was just what happened. Oh sure it was Sam and Nat urging Rogers towards the elevator, and she definitely had to give him a firm elbow to the small of his back to get him inside of it, but still. It happened. All he had to put up with was one last painfully sincere look before the doors closed... and then all the air rushed back into the room.
"I'm gonna rip ya a new one later for not believin' in me, in us, and for givin' up so easy. But right now we got bigger problems so we're gonna shelve this one for later, okay?"
“Then into the fray we go. Make sure my scotch doesn’t spill - I’m going to need it in a couple of minutes.”
"You can't make her do anything," Rogers butted in, jaw set in anger again. He was always jumping to her defense, even after Ultron. Even after
"Passing? Tony, come on - I know you've seen the pictures. Howard had to have kept them. And when I saw him come out of the tower a couple days ago to go to that yogurt place--"
"I hate to interrupt as this is going so well," Fri's sarcasm was lost on no one, and from the corner of his eye he saw Shellhead jerk at hearing a voice that wasn't JARVIS. "But we have another problem. There is an unidentified craft rapidly approaching, one unlike anything I have ever seen, and they are... 'requesting' permission to land using the tower's facilities. Sir," she paused, sounding both baffled and furious. "Captain Rogers is demanding he and the rogue Avengers be allowed to come and, in his words, save you."
"Didja gimme a new name?" Tony would have answered, he would have, but Steve chose that moment to sink his teeth into the side of his neck. It was just this side of painful, and all he could do was buck up in response while giving a hoarse cry. Steve chuckled, then gave the same spot a few kitten licks to soothe the burn. "Bet ya did. Bet ya came up with somethin' all meaningful and sweet and all-a that. Ya can tell me all about that... later."
The story Rhodes had told about the animal shelter stuck with him. He had thought about going to visit but with Tony working so hard to keep his distance, Steve knew it wasn't his place to arbitrarily step in. Still, he loved knowing about it, loved that Tony's heart was big enough to save even lab rats that probably hadn't known love a day in their lives. He could see it, the way hearing about them would have put little lines of distress around Tony's eyes. He'd probably planned for months how to get them out of their cages safely - there was no way it had been a spur of the moment decision. Maybe he'd needed to be drunk to put it into motion, but the idea had been rattling around that genius brain long before that night.
"Yeah. Hit the road soon as Fri let them know the fight was over. Kamala's with them," he wasn't surprised by that at all. Kamala was six months away from being allowed to be a full-time Avenger instead of a junior member. She'd been devastated not to be allowed in the fight. "Leavin' now would be dumb. You should take pops home though."
... they still trusted him to keep them safe. Peter had trusted him enough to admit that he had been afraid.
Despite that it had been kind of nice, at first, to be together again without it being about sex. Sometimes... sometimes when he remembered things it had been hard to convince himself that Steve really loved him. His mind could easily turn it into something else - his
“That’s enough,” Steve finally interrupted, voice firm. “JARVIS, could you bring up the menu for the diner? I think that’s the way most of us are leaning.”
But... Ms. Potts-- [pause] I suppose I can understand why you believe my intentions weren't very noble. I can also see the merit in your suggestion. I'll have my office call and set up another appointment. Will next week work for you?
because of the superhero thing, and it's not that it didn't work out because I've got Steve and you've got Ben - who really oughta swing by and say hi to Steve, since he's basically the reason you two are together and all - so it was for the best and I still adore you, but we broke up because of Iron Man. So forgive me if I'm a little confused by your sudden urge to don some primary colors and battle evil. Pettiness is not a good motivation to do that in my personal opinion."
"Anyway, I scrapped it and started over a couple of times because it wasn't right and maybe this one isn't quite there either, but J pointed out I could keep tweaking it forever and not be happy with it so it was better to just rip off the band-aid. I got a lot of original parts and repurposed them and I hope it doesn't bring up bad memories - fuck maybe I shouldn't have... if you hate it that's fine. I can come up with a better design. I mean, I also sort of centered your new suit around this one but I could make it work with something else. Anyway--"
"Are ya hurtin' now?" He brushed his fingers through Tony's hair, pushing some of the lanky strands back so he could see the man's expression better. "I need ya ta tell me if ya are. I'm not gonna leave ya, promise, but we can find better ways ta lay down, ones that won't hurt ya so much."
Dr. Greene had told him he should say something. She had smiled when he gave his emphatic no and hadn't brought it up again. The doc was infuriatingly good at waiting him out. His actual shrink, the one still paid for by Fury and SHIELD, had called Steve 'well adjusted' on his last report, which was interesting since they still didn't even talk to each other during their sessions.
because a red mist was rising over the place where he'd last seen Vision. The witch was on their side, allegedly, but her methods still gave him the heebie jeebies and threatened to throw him into a flashback. He held on to the sound of Rhodey's bitching to prevent that, and focused the rest of his attention on the death petals.
"Oh? Why don't we have Barton call him that and see if he gets the other arm broken for his troubles."
"If he ever tells you this story, I want you to know that I didn't scream. It was a damn war cry, because I was ready to fight the little bastard. But it ran, so I'm thinking I'm safe, right?" He snorted, then took another pull of beer. "Nope. They're all. Over. The dorm room. Asshole had gone and 'rescued' them while he was drunk because he kept thinking about how they were getting experimented on - which he decided meant torture and certain death. He cried over the damn things, Steve. They were rats, but he was crying like they were puppies dropped off at a kill shelter. It was awful."
"I don't need a translator, dust mop. And yes, we're going and yes, you need coats. Last time you two were 'only going to be in the mansion' you came home covered in mud and telling me all about your adventures. You're both lucky I'm not making you wear... what the hell does Rhodey call them? Wading boots or something. FRIDAY--"
Steve looked down at his favorite set of comfy clothes and could admit that they were kind of shabby. He'd ripped the sweatpants in a few places and stretched the t-shirt out; both were stained and verging on gross. If they weren't so damned comfortable he would have thrown them out months ago. So sure he didn't exactly look his best, but he'd only expected to see his Rosie and the other Avengers for the rest of the day and they'd all seen him in that particular get up before.
Actually he thought the look on his face probably matched Probably-Nathan’s almost exactly, because the touchy-feely man looked more turned on than nervous.
“Easy there big guy. We just settled the debate - no need to get it going again. Besides, Bruce deserves all the nice things including Reuben sandwiches and sleep.”
Shame wasn't something Tony was well-acquainted with. He had a passing knowledge of the feeling, knew when it should be knocking on his door... but this was one of the first times he had actually answered. It had been a long, long time since he genuinely wished the ground would open up and swallow him. The physics of it would be mind-bending and world-shattering, but that was okay. Science breakage was a go if it got him the fuck away from Captain America, who was now smiling behind one goddamned hand.
"... fine. Been learnin' about articulated manipulators and such from STAR - she wants ta build a robot'n that's your fault. She says articulation is real important. Mentioned some stuff about prismatic joints and Cartesian topology--"
specialist, which is not... look. Pepper tries, she does, but she doesn't really get it. I mean, she doesn't scream in surprise when U brings her things anymore - she's his favorite, so he's always... she doesn't scream now. She'll even talk at him, but she doesn't even act like he's a dog or anything. So she tries, but she doesn't get it. My gummy bear does better, but he tends to get frustrated, you know? To him they are like dogs, but ones that are really badly trained. Which isn't their fault, by the way! I mean, I was really,
Once that was over, Cap threw the tennis ball for Dum-E. The ease with which he did it suggested they had been playing for a while, which was absolutely sweet but it did not mean that Cap was any different from Howard's stories of him. Probably the guy just wanted a dog or something, or maybe he was bored. He wasn't playing fetch with the silly old 'bot because he cared about Dum-E's
Regarding the two alien members of the team, apparently of a race called 'Skrulls': Captain Danvers has vouched for them, and the Accords Committee claims to have vetted them extensively. It remains to be seen if the general public reaction to this decision will be positive or negative. Certain news outlets have claimed that this is just another, more extreme example of aliens stealing American jobs. So far there has been no reaction from the New Avengers regarding these allegations.
It was new, being important enough to someone that they would defend him like that, at least against something like this. Rhodey would - and had at parties when they were both younger - but he wasn’t at the fancy shindigs. Pepper was more likely to roll her eyes in exasperation at his antics, because despite how amazing she otherwise was she hadn’t quite clued in to how uncomfortable it made him. It was probably the only way she had bought into all the hype about him.
"Whatever she said, it still don't mean ya gotta do this. Rogers isn't gonna like it, so he's gonna be an ass."
"Thanks a lot Steve. For, you know, everything. Thank FRIDAY for me too, will you? She's been... she's been really trying for me, and I know she didn't have to tell you anything, so... yeah."
I came because I was fascinated with Maverick, one of the most reclusive heroes apart from Rescue. By this time in the interview, however, Steve Brian was far more interesting.
Steve was a good guy - he’d make someone a great boyfriend. Once the thought didn’t make him want to break things, he decided as he drifted off, he was going to find someone worthy of dating Steve. It was just a shame that couldn’t ever be him.
"You're damn lucky he doesn't exploit the hell out of that." Rhodey took his beer with a nod of thanks then let out a heavy sigh. "So. Welcome to the club." He knocked his bottle against Steve's and they both took a long swig. Being so goddamn worried about Tony all the time wasn't fun, but he was grateful for the reminder that he wasn't alone doing it. Even apart from the Avengers, Tony had people who cared about him, who would probably do just about anything for him.
Even saying goodbye to Thor when he left to for Asgard or to see Jane was hard. There was the chance he wouldn't come back, after all, especially when he went back home. With Loki doing better Thor spent much more time in Asgard. Maybe one day he would decide to forsake Midgard completely.
Sam was the only one who didn't look ready to attack, but he was still geared up just in case, and fuck. It just made his stomach want to rebel because he'd redesigned those wings too. He had streamlined them, given Sam the means to really compete on the super-stage despite not having any powers or Black Widow training. Maybe the guy didn't have his finger on the trigger the same way Rogers and Nat did, but Tony couldn’t take much comfort in that. Not when he knew that Sam wouldn't hesitate to jump into things if Rogers' finger even twitched the right way.
Well, not unless it meant that Tony felt the same way. Then he'd be just fine with both of them staring at each other all damn day, and who cared who saw it.
"Stuff just like this got me through the European countryside, you know. Good to have in a pinch. Maybe I oughta start carrying some with me again just in case. You wouldn't have had to wait so long that way. Ah, there we go. Now I have your interest, don't I sweetheart? Don't worry, this is for you. Not all at once though or you'd probably get sick. Doesn't look like you've been eating much."
Your questions. You just said this interview was to learn about what we at SI are doing to help the New Avengers and their other allies protect our planet from extraterrestrial threats. So. I would like to hear your questions.
"They don't quite get it," Shellhead interrupted. "They try harder than almost anyone, but they don't get it. I mean, my Rhodey understands how important JARVIS is to
They had a lot of good allies these days. Their roster had been growing steadily, and with Steve's input Rhodey and Carol had begun to recruit more members that were an auxiliary of the Avengers. The Defenders down in Hell's Kitchen were a great rotating addition, as were some of the mutants that called themselves the X-Men. And honestly, as much of a pain in the ass as Magneto could be, he had also been willing to step in in the clutch. Tony wouldn't want him ever appearing on the actual roster, but it was nice to have someone who would totally come in during a world-threatening event.
"I... bringing Fri would be the hardest part." Instead of scoffing the way most people would, Steve just made a thoughtful little noise. He'd forgotten, somehow, just how much his
The hallway outside was far more tasteful, unfortunately. Tasteful enough that it felt like the home of someone truly wealthy. The rooms that were opened on the way were the same, and it was almost enough to send him on an unpleasant flashback to his childhood home. Maybe Shellhead had struggled with that too, because there was the perfect amount of personality to keep that from happening. Little hints of Iron Man, Lokes and the other Defenders were everywhere, reminding him of
Tony slumped over, expression closing off as he came to that realization out loud. It wasn't one that Steve agreed with though. Not given the context and their histories and even the less pleasant set of visitors they'd gotten. God, he wouldn't blame the man for curling up around him and demanding he never leave after the day they'd had. His lover wasn't an asshole - he was human, and he was hurting.
The future wasn't what he had wanted, but it wasn't as bad as he had thought when he first woke up in it.
She wouldn't get into it today, he knew that much. That wasn't how Pepper worked unless she was in an emergency situation - that was when she went in guns blazing. Otherwise she liked a series of steady and organized steps. Still, she did let go of his hand and took a few steps forward. Her fingers ghosted over Rescue's mask, then trailed down the suit's throat and shoulder. Then, like he knew it would, her hand fell to that light shining out of the suit's chest.
He didn't know how to fix it, didn't know how to say 'hey, could you please start touching me' to a friend. When he thought about it, really thought about it, Nat and Thor were the only ones who ever did. They were the same friendly, familial touches he'd gotten from Bucky and it didn't take long until it didn't feel like enough. How did you tell someone that you wanted to wrap them up in a hug? How could he ask Tony to snuggle up to his chest so Steve could tuck that dark head of hair under his chin? How was he supposed to let Tony know that he might wither up and die if Tony didn't start granting him the same level of casual intimacy that he gave the rest of the Avengers?
Fear and longing both took his breath away, mingling to become something bittersweet that made him ache. Because fuck, he had always loved being Iron Man. That armor had meant safety and freedom, had given him the means to turn his shitty existence into something that might actually mean something
"I would like to meet them," he finally said, thankful for the silence his Tiny Adorable Steve had given him to process. "It'd be... maybe it would be... nice. To have a re-do with some of them I mean. Won't be happening for a while though."
Tony had never really enjoyed the glitzy parties he had been attending since he was a kid. There had been the years of boredom and wishing he could kick certain adults in the shin followed by two years of faux rebellion - sulking in one corner while being vaguely rude to anyone who talked to him had nothing on what came next. The drinking, sex and drugs that had hallmarked his true rebellious streak had made the parties only a little more bearable.
"If you keep staring," she said quietly, sensing he wasn't really in the mood for a Russian lesson. "He's going to catch on fire. That or you'll manage to actually kill my archer with a look and then I'll have to kill you."
"She tied Clinton down," Winter added helpfully from his spot on the couch where he was reading, STAR tucked against the side of his neck. "And she stole Strange's cloak to keep him from visiting his counterpart." The cloak itself turned to Winter and saluted, making the ex-assassin chuckle quietly. "Everyone else has been behaving, right
"So what do you think?" When he didn't get an immediate answer, it took everything he had not to snarl at the woman standing between the two hospital beds. "Helen!"
Most of their property was heavily forested and largely untouched by human hands. The wildlife was pretty fucking amazing to watch from their sprawling porch. He and Steve sat out most nights, either alone together or with some of the kids. U was especially fascinated, and was working with Steve to carefully build a hiking path that was safe for all the bots but wouldn't disturb the land too much. Dum-E was more interested in the pond behind the house, and had learned to skip rocks over the surface but fled whenever the resident cranky snapping turtle made an appearance. STAR was still spending most of her time inside, helping him with the renovations and with building up his workshop space. His girl FRIDAY, meanwhile, spent a lot of time interfacing with this universe's JARVIS and the internet, learning everything she could and peppering their conversations with new facts.
"True, but Lokes won't let him be the first inta a potentially hostile situation. Wouldn't mind usin' Pegs as fodder though."
We were never meant for mortal hands. He thinks he is so clever, hiding his away and using the gauntlet instead, but it will not be enough to save him.
was understanding and patient - about this at least - and never pressured him. Tony would just get soulful looks and sweet kisses, slightly sad smiles and soft words of understanding. It was both infuriating and guilt inducing to the extreme. Once - just once - he would like to fight about it. A real knock-down, drag-out, wringer of a fight where Steve was demanding and unreasonable about the whole thing.
"How 'bout ya show me my suit? Then... 'workshop sex' before I take ya upstairs'n cook ya a fancy dinner. I'll romance ya, then spend hours takin' ya apart. Does that work?"
"Yeah. Got almost ten back." The teen inched forward, eyes on the dog the whole time. "How much of that do you want?"
Tony lost hold of the large drill bit he had been using as a microphone. It clattered to the ground along with the shreds of his dignity. Damn thing landed on his foot too, because of course it did. He couldn't bite back the urge to cuss quick enough, and so the show continued with him swearing and hopping up and down on one leg because it had hurt like a
Tony guessed he'd never really gotten over the small, fragile hope that Captain America might learn to like him after all.
"Well. You've always been my Queen," he teased, dropping a kiss to her knuckles. "I had to give you the color of royalty."
"The other Avengers wish you to know that they are... ah. Deliriously happy that the pair of you have gotten your heads out of your asses is how it was put to me by Master Clint. Mr. Rhodes wanted me to inform you that he will be stopping by in two weeks to help you both celebrate properly. Miss Potts--"
"Oh! Right!" Tony brightened again and jumped up, dislodging Steve with enough force that he almost fell off the couch. That didn't even slow the genius down though - he just grabbed Steve's hand and began tugging. Amused and backside stinging a little from the fall he followed after the guy he was finally going to be able to call his fella. "I've been working on this forever - that's also why I didn't, you know. Say anything right away. Because I wanted it to be perfect and you know..."
. Don't let them take that away, Buck. You're still a good man - Bucky, you've always been one of the best men I ever knew--"
allowed to tuck that tousled head of hair under his chin. It was probably the most perfect hug that had ever happened to anyone, and he'd fight anyone who said otherwise. "So why don't we hug, exactly?" he dared to murmur while his eyes drifted shut so he could really savor the moment. Christ, it was amazing to finally have Tony be so close, and he couldn't help but tighten his arms just a little when it felt like the other man might be letting go.
"Find Quill and keep him from doing something stupid." Carol sounded winded, which... it wasn't good. Wasn't good at all. Even he knew that despite the way it felt like something was squeezing his head like a grape. "With Gamora down--"
I apologize. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Poppleton, that Tony has been working in coordination with SI, Reed Richards, Hank Pym and the Asgardians to find ways to protect our planet from any extraterrestrial threats. Carol Danvers, Tokra and Noren have all been incredibly informative regarding what kinds of threats we should try to prepare for.
When the petal was nothing but flames, twisted metal and dead monsters, he and Rhodey moved on. Several of the remaining demon-dogs tried to leap high enough to drag them down to earth, but their crazed attacks were easy to evade. Captain Marvel was leading a charge into their ranks, only a token defense left around the Tesseract as the battle had turned in their favor. It distracted a good portion of the demon-dogs and left him and Rhodey to do their work mostly uninterrupted.
The rest of the players in their little drama faded away as he turned around, suddenly desperate to spot his lover. He didn't know exactly how he felt about all of this but he was pretty sure he knew how
It was enough to get me thinking about the characters again instead of angsting over how they're going to fuck over my precious cinnamon roll in the next film, because Tony Stark Deserves Better, Dammit but I know he probably won't get it. But anyway, now that's only like... half my Marvel feels? The rest are happy ones where I am ready to engage in the fandom again, so. With that I am hopeful that I can get on a schedule, but I probably should stop promising that.
Tony had teasingly asked him to pull it on. Still... J almost never asked anything of any of them, and he did know what the hell was going on so he figured he might as well humor the AI.
"This is going to turn into a circular argument, so how about we don't? How about you just take me at face value?"
"Using me. You worry he'll think you're using me to take away his friend." His brow furrowed as he thought of that, one hand lightly scratching at one cheek. "That's stupid. How would I do that? And I don't want him anyway. I have enough trouble with what's left in my head without stealing another Winter Soldier to look after permanently."
The Avengers were still in trouble - the demon-dogs were a pain in the fucking ass even if the seemed more mindless than anything. Maybe they weren't going after the Infinity Stones but they
"Tony. Sweetheart." Steve sounded just a little upset, and it was music to his ears. He was also still there, which never happened when Tony was so awake. Tiny Adorable Steve's ghost never stayed long enough to argue with him. "I got a version of ya ta work with a Trickster God in order ta bend the fabric of space and time ta get me here. It'd be real nice if ya'd open your eyes and maybe gimme a kiss good morning. Quite a few people went ta an awful lot of trouble so we could kiss again."
"I can do that. And we can start slow too. Maybe mostly Defenders ya never met here. Well, and Lokes'n Shellhead. Don't think I could keep 'em away if'n I tried."
"Pep. Pepper. Light of my life. Steve knows I love him unconditionally but that I am also obligated to mock his awful dance moves."
, and usually he would turn and offer the man a smile, but he... he just didn't have it in him just then. Staring at the glass as he tried to mentally prepare himself for what was coming was better. Easier.
Fri was quick to agree to his plan - maybe too quick. He hoped Loki wasn't having a negative influence on his girl. All he needed was for FRIDAY to take a page out of the God of Chaos' book. Still. At least she was willing to play along.
"Tony, no," he interrupted, for once doing it with laughter instead of scorn. "I don't want shoes, ya mook."
"Maybe a little. But so am I. All-a us are, but at least we got each other. He's got nobody and that ain't right."
Sooooo... lately I've had like, a super ambivalent feeling towards MCU and kind of Marvel in general? Or maybe not ambivalent, probably more like vaguely angry and drained? Which makes it very hard to write in the fandom, as one might guess. Having that feeling during this particular chapter where I was feeling lots of pressure to get it
His Tiny Adorable Steve was still there, worried but beautiful blue eyes locked on his own. The sob that was stuck in his throat hurt but it was a pain he would happily bear. Steve was there, Steve was real, and he had promised not to leave him behind again. Maybe everything in his life had gone to shit in the past few months, but suddenly it didn’t seem all that bad. His life no longer felt irredeemably fucked. He had Steve and that… that was enough to make it all seem bearable again.
“That is cheating!” Clint cried, flinging an accusing finger at Bruce. “You know you’re his favorite and you are playing dirty.” Tony wasn’t really sure what he was talking about - though Bruce was his favorite Avenger if he didn’t count Steve - and he didn’t care either. He wanted to get Brucie his Reuben and tuck him into bed.
"Can it short stack. Bucky needs some help and they tell me I'm uniquely qualified. Agent Carter says--"
," Winter grumbled, eyebrows drawing together in a frown. Steve was smugly pleased that, once again, his opinion of the awful club was being validated. Then that expression cleared and the man smiled. "I broke two noses, three feet and an arm before Jan and Agent Carter pushed me out the door."
I suggest you think long and hard about what you are hoping to accomplish here. If you aren't looking to discredit or disgrace Mr. Stark, if you have genuine concerns not motivated by personal or political gain, stop looking to Mrs. Weatherby for answers. Her dislike of Mr. Stark is well known, and her inability to set those feelings aside to work with him in her role as a member of the Committee does not speak well of her character. I am willing to offer you the benefit of the doubt here, Mr. Poppleton, and I hope that our next meeting will be more satisfactory for the both of us.
leave ya, Tony," he whispered while lifting a hand to stroke the man's cheek. "Never. Not willingly. If someone or somethin' tries ta take me then I'll fight like hell ta get back home. Ta get back ta
"The other 'bots you're... 'managin' are playing tug of war with a pretty flashy looking wrench - that torque one ya got at mad at me for not knowin' about I think."
."  U made a chirpy little beep, then came his way. Little disaster almost didn't stop in time, and the only reason Steve didn't tip over was the arm he slung around the 'bot's main strut. "Yeah yeah. Your brother'n sister'n ya are part of the reason why things are so good. Don't have ta bowl me over 'cause of it." The whistle that earned was full of doubt, and as Peggy and Loki chuckled the 'bot headed back over to his new friend.
, chances were they'd never have gotten close when they first met. Not when JARVIS' death had still been eating away at his soul. He shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, and since he happened to love this particular gift horse very much…
"Of course they do. You're my sweetheart," he said like it was really that simple. "Always have been. They'd love ta meet ya after all the stories I told. Showed some of 'em some of the pictures too. And they..." The pause couldn't mean anything good, so he braced himself only to have Steve kiss his temple again. "They know that ya might not want ta know them right away. Some of 'em look an awful lot like the people who hurt ya. They don't want ta bring up any bad memories or anything. Shellhead says I should punch Rogers in the dick for him."
"Don't worry. I'll thank her and Tony will too once we get this sorted. Now get home and get your schoolwork done, ya hear?"
"... they didn't put that in the history books either. You're portrayed as a very straight virgin in most of them." Steve snorted and buried his nose in Tony's hair, letting himself breathe the genius in one more time. It was so, so hard to let him go, but hugs couldn't last forever.
They were both dead tired when they finally got to the tower and stumbled off the Quinjet. Steve knew they really ought to deal with whatever Fri had been talking about and then eat something, but their bed was calling and he didn't think he was strong enough to resist. She had said that it wasn't anything bad - surely it could wait until after they'd had a nap. In the elevator Tony sidled up to him and then half-collapsed, his head ending up on Steve's shoulder. He pressed a few kisses against the man's hair, not caring that it was sweaty and lank, wondering if maybe the elevator wouldn't be fine for a nap after all.
Tony had said there were too many variables for him to risk coming, even to support Winter. Steve knew that his fella just wasn't ready to face his mother's killer and hadn't questioned the decision. In a rare show of tact, Winter hadn't pushed either. Hell, the former assassin had just ruffled Tony's hair on the way out the door, his cold eyes thawing a few degrees in a show of kindness and understanding.
"Shhh… sorry, sweetheart. Forgot you're still hurtin' for a minute. Our little Starry Skies is makin' some food for us. Should be back in here soon, I think."
and asking about his art projects. The man was so much better at explaining all the new tech and such he was surrounded by - even managed to do it without treating him like a complete moron while he did it. He let Steve mother hen him, gave him full access to the workshop, and they had standing 'dates' - friend dates, ones where Steve was desperate to grab Tony's hand but couldn't - every Sunday and Tuesday.
"We won't. I promise." Standing back up was hard - it made his knees and back ache, and his heart flutter strangely. Tony's hand was instantly at the small of his back, and the contact made him feel better.
A unibeam was his best bet, but he was glad to see Rhodey busting out his missile launchers instead. Rhodey's armor hadn't gotten all the same upgrades as his own yet. War Machine's missiles still had a bit more kick than its unibeam, and they could be used a lot more frequently.
Though now he was going to have to tell Tony. Working through the implications of that with the other man should keep life interesting for a good long while.
Rogers has been ordered to see a counselor about his growing obsession with Tony Stark, particularly his relationship with Maverick. In addition, his phone privileges have been revoked, and the VI at the facility will only dial numbers from a predetermined list when he is permitted to use the phone. He is confined to the facility until further notice, except when Captain Danvers gives special permission. Per the rules set forth when he signed the Accords, this will constitute his first strike.
"You aren't as big as me period," he teased just to watch Tony's cheeks puff out in irritation. "Not without wearing the armor or putting lifts in your shoes anyway."
The aching sorrow he was sure he could see in those eyes demanded a personal effort from him too. No matter how much he wanted to stay wrapped up exclusively in Tony, their kids needed him too. That included the Vision even if he did end up being a grandkid instead the way Fri thought he should be. He knew he would love the Vision - Viz - as much as he loved the others, but he also sensed it was going to take a lot more to get to know him. Mission happily accepted.
are, and I am not... I almost got that kid killed! He almost died because of me, and now you want me to-- no. No. He's better off without me, alright? He was doing just fine before I dragged him into a fight he wasn't nearly ready for."
For his Tiny Adorable Steve, he guessed he could put himself out there one last time. And if this was real? If his
“It wasn’t even that big a deal, honest. I mean, when he tells you the story it might sound kind of bad, but that’s why I raced here--”
It took Steve a while to figure out that there was still something wrong. When it finally hit him, he'd gone to the gym in the tower and worked his way through three of Tony's 'indestructible' punching bags.
You were mine from the moment you drew breath, little Mechanic. Space brought you to me early, but you were always mine. In this matter you will be my hands, so that together we three may throw off the yoke of Thanos' enslavement. Together we will free Power and Reality, and we will show Thanos what comes of attempting to abuse our power.
While the cave troll and evil Jedi had shared the spaceship brought down by Earth's shields, glaive guy and spear chick had learned from that. They'd kept their ship above the atmosphere and only sent down the metal petal-like shuttles the demon-dogs rode on. For every one that had been shot down another two landed, an infuriating lesson for Tony and the others who had designed the shields.
, he always--" Tony bit whatever else had been about to explode out, closing his eyes in a poor display of patience. "Maybe you weren't ‘Bucky and Steve’ the way Rogers and his version were, but I know you still... you're practically brothers from what you've told me. I would be an asshole if I asked you not to go see him."
"Uh-huh. Whatever you say. Hey, you ever hear about the time Tony tried to keep twenty rats as pets in our dorm?"
"No! No. That's not... fucking hell. Look. That was just a fucked up situation and... Howard. He used to... say things. So I thought... I thought someone like you couldn't ever... feel... anything for me. Shit, I never thought you even would want to be my friend." It hurt to hear, and by God did some part of him want Tony to build a time machine just so he could go back and kick Howard Stark's ass. He hugged the man a little tighter, one hand rubbing up and down the length of his spine. "I was so fucking glad that you wanted to be my anything that I... Rhodey said I was being an idiot."
Rhodey moved in with them when he was finally ready to retire. Pepper chose not to, though she visited with Ben until her husband was bed-ridden. Burying her next to him and having to walk away was one of the hardest things he'd ever had to do. Steve, U and Harley found a clearing near the house and turned it into a memorial space for those friends whose final resting places were a universe away. Eventually most of the Avengers he'd known had their names carved into the marble statue, and soon after that he and Steve stopped visiting.
When Pep stopped putting it off and raised her eyes to her new suit, Tony was gratified by the look of awe that entered her eyes as her mouth dropped open. He'd worked hard on the design, scrapping more concepts than he'd kept in the end. For her, he had kept things simple and understated - it was what she liked best. The flashiest part was his choice for the main color. He'd eventually decided on a deep, rich purple with silver accents. After some debate, he'd indulged himself just a little by letting the light in her chest piece shine arc reactor blue instead of tinting it another color. In a show of both truth and a reference he knew she'd understand, he had also shaped that opening to look like a heart.
Tony had dreamed of his Tiny Adorable Steve coming back to him so many times that when he began to wake up he was sure this time wasn't any different. Sure it had felt real, but it always did. He always had trouble in the moments between being fully asleep and fully awake, because it always felt like his
to bring them through once it was too late to stop you," Winter commented, voice almost idle. "She told me she had specific instructions not to activate the portal until
, intense in a way that felt ominous. It didn't hurt, exactly, but it was making it difficult to focus on what he was supposed to be doing.
That line of thinking reminded him of his scotch, and he kept right on ignoring the room as he reached for a tumbler. One shot wouldn't be enough to see him through once Steve left him, or it wouldn't if he was still a person who drank. Since this was all about temptation - some would say self-sabotage - and symbolism, the bigger cup was the right move to make. He even filled it with ice as he refused to try and listen in to what was going on between Steve and his
Everything in his torso wasn't completely fixed though. Helen had warned that his chest was always going to be a weak point for him - regrowing tissue could only do so much. The Cradle had its limits and he had pushed right up against them. The good doctor had promised that he would be the first to know when she was ready to advance the technology further and he wasn't quite sure how he felt about that. On the one hand it would be nice if he didn't have a weak spot to be exploited; on the other there were probably people younger than him who could use the boost even more. He was still on his way out, and even the Cradle couldn't change that.
With Harley there, smiling and waving brochures in his face, Tony could almost believe it was true. And maybe the other shoe would drop, maybe they would regret it in the years to come, but he wanted more than anything to stay in the moment where they were home, happy, and with nothing more pressing than helping Harley choose a college on their plates.
"Dunno how much more I can help ya shut that brain-a yours up without gettin' ya undressed," his lover teased, a glint in his eyes and a blush on his cheeks. God, part of him couldn't believe the man still blushed and he couldn't help but be delighted every time he saw it. "Could prob'ly get your pants off quick enough ta make ya blue screen before Dr. Cho comes in though."
Before Rogers could pick up steam, Winter interrupted with a string of Russian clearly directed at Bucky. He hesitated only a moment, glancing over at Rogers, before answering back in the same language. Of course that had Rogers' face turning colors again while he staunched the flow of blood with one hand, and Steve briefly hid his face in his hands, because fuck. It was a fucking mess just like he'd known it would be. Trying to tune Rogers and his impending temper tantrum out, he listed to the two former assassins and wondered just what they were talking about.
“I’m not sure I can go on at this rate. There’s a white light and soon I’ll be bored enough to head into it. I've survived an attempted crushing only to--”
Having to crane his neck to look up at Harley was something Steve didn't think he'd ever get used to. At 18 Harley was almost as tall as Rogers, and he wasn't convinced the kid was done growing quite yet. Long hours of training and exercise had done wonders for a once gangly physique, and from the fan mail he was painfully aware that his son was now considered one of the hottest Avengers to a certain demographic.
I was so startled that I dropped my open water bottle, and I'm sure my mouth was hanging open and making me look like a complete moron. Tony began cackling - there's no other word for it - while Steve stared back at me with wide blue eyes. A moment later he sprang into action with Tony still laughing and me still gaping. He ran to the kitchen and came back with a washcloth, and I'm ashamed to say the water bottle was still on the floor, liquid still pouring out of it. Steve was the one who finally righted it and even put the cap back on before mopping up my mess. I was so embarrassed I wanted to floor to open up and swallow me, but thankfully the two men were so busy teasing each other that they didn't seem to notice.
The man was probably about to embark on an obnoxious, self-congratulatory speech to poke fun at himself. Shellhead was even more fond of self-degradation in humor than he was. Everyone would listen and laugh, and then he would give a speech of his own - he was teetering between something funny or heartfelt. At least until he saw the banner that was strung across one entire, huge wall.
Rhodes had ended up staying in his room for the rest of the night - they'd finally fallen asleep on the couch and woke up cuddling. That had cemented their friendship, apparently, because now he was under strict orders to call the man 'Rhodey' and to get in touch if he needed anything. It was almost enough to leave him feeling starstruck. Rhodey was the center of almost half of Tony's stories and Tony admired him,
"From a mad scientist. Never got much bigger'n I already was, but I got some muscles outta the deal. Hey, if I called Pepper and got her ta stop by'n confirm she sees me… would that help?"
Sooooooo. Not as plotty as I had intended, but I wanted to get Peter in there and then end with a kind of cliff hanger, so. :'D
"Hey Harley?" Peter waited for him to grunt in acknowledgement, then continued to whisper. "That was really scary. I mean, I knew that... that being a real Avenger would be different, but..." His brother stopped, looking for words, but Harley was pretty sure he knew what his brother meant. Before that day Harley had already been called in a few times as a full Avenger; the battle against the Black Order had been Peter's first time being in that kind of fight. Even being called in to handle 'normal' villains had been different and way more intense than the stuff they'd handled as junior members. Peter had to be experiencing that times a hundred. "I mean, I'm not sorry and I'd do it again, and I'll fight Thanos, but..."
As soon as Tony's lower lip protruded in a pout, Steve put out one hand. "On second thought, looks like someone better take a pin ta Clint's ego before he floats away. That turn you offered still good?"
"You don't know anything about me or Bucky, so why don't you shut your mouth? We got a reading on Loki's magic here just a little while ago - I know you're just one of those clones he can make. I never believed he was dead no matter what Thor told us. Now I know what scheme he's been working."
"Before. During the war. The one we fought together." Though his sentences were getting short and his accent was thickening, there was no added tension in Winter's body. So long as that didn't happen, reminiscing was alright. "We used to do this. Before battles or after them."
Steve's heart had stuttered for a beautiful, painful moment when Tony said 'I love you'. Sure it had been implied and all, but actually hearing it was... Christ, it was everything. He felt a little breathless, head spinning a little because this was sort of every dream come true.
"Still. What must I give in return for your silence?" With those words, Captain America's cheeks again turned pink. His shoulders hunched as his smile turned unsure, and fuck if the guy didn't look
Tony absolutely didn't break down into proud-parent tears, and anyone who said so later was a dirty rotten liar.
"Everyone wanted me when I was cleared for duty," Winter pointed out, that smug arrogance firmly back in place. Guy was worse than a cat when it came to that. "Tony Stark hates me but even he still requested me on his team."
"Jan is small, but her heels are sharp and she has good aim." When Winter shrugged, his broad shoulders and built arms gave the impression of a small mountain shifting. "And Agent Carter is... she says she is not my handler, but..." A tiny frown as the man searched for words, and then an even smaller smile graced his lips. "She is fierce and she does not mind telling me what to do or when I am being... sometimes the soldier comes forward too much. She is good at helping him stand down."
Soooooo... I like the idea of Pep keeping her powers regardless of what happened in Iron Man 3. I like to think that Tony made her version of Extremis a lot less volatile and easier to control rather than stripping it away entirely.
It was Steve who said it, so of course they all did it. Mostly anyway - they were figuring out their orders but Clint in particular was still muttering rebelliously to himself. Hopefully the archer would get to pick dinner the next day; Tony silently promised to cast his vote Clint’s way to better the chance of that happening. Maybe he could talk Bruce and Steve into doing the same.
"Tell him to stop rehearsing what he's going to say and get his android ass in here, Fri. He'll only work himself into a dither if he doesn't."
"'Course. Lady's out. Oh, I like the name Beacon too, but I'm not... I don't think it fits. Next dog maybe."
Eating golden apple didn't ease his hurts quite as much as Extremis had for Tony, but Steve did find that it was easier to ignore them.
It had led to him leaving the tower to jog a lot more. He liked the space it gave him, and he knew he needed to start integrating or whatever the way Dr. Greene was always telling him to. Getting a feel for the city the way it was now was something he needed to do... and it was something he could put off when he was completely comfortable staying in the tower all the time. Now that the air there felt charged and uneasy he found himself needing to get out. In the process he was learning that he sort of liked modern day New York City.
But the Mad Titan's attention was fixed on Tony, because that was how it was always meant to be. They were... connected, had been since Tony had flown through a crack in the sky and had seen what was up there waiting for him. Distantly, without any real interest because there just wasn't enough of him left to feel it, he thought that would have been the case even without this ending. Even if Soul had never interfered, somehow he and Thanos would have met in the middle of the battlefield.
Before he could get any further the man yanked his hand away and moved to put the bed between them. It was purely defensive, he got that, but it still hurt. His lover couldn't even look at him, and was instead staring up at the ceiling while rubbing his chest where the arc reactor had once been. Where, more recently, Captain America had put the shield through his chest, and Mother of
"Breathe, kid," he advised with growing alarm. Tony could go on for even longer, sure, but he was a grownup whose lungs had regular practice with rambles. No way a teen was up to that kind of breath-stealing exercise. "I'm here, ain't I? And I'm sure Tony's not mad and it sure as hell ain't your fault the rogue Avengers got away, ya hear? Was just bad luck and bad decisions all around'n I'm sure Tony's more mad at himself, alright? So just... breathe."
"Harley!" Tony's shout almost immediately gave way to a gasp of pain and a few hacking coughs that he knew hurt the man even worse. There wasn't much he could do besides shift his fella a little, trying to relieve some of the pressure as he ran a soothing hand down his side.
"Pegs said that too. Thought it was kinda unfair, and so did Tony. My Tony, I mean. I know Shellhead is still kinda..."
"How is he?" It was the question he had dreaded asking, but it needed to be done. Neither of them asked who he meant, and Loki's smirk immediately faded away to a grim frown. Peggy looked a little less foreboding, but there were shadows in her eyes. She kept rubbing her left thigh as well, and he was sure his wayward brother had injured her somehow.
Anthony has superior craftsmanship," here both 'bots gave an offended beep and even Fri made a rude noise through her speakers. "But he hasn't yet managed to give his creations such... life. I hadn't expected to see such a thing here, to be honest. I would have thought this little planet centuries away from such a feat. His is special, your love."
By wordless agreement they bypassed the living room and kitchen entirely to head right to the bedroom. He even shut the door behind them which almost never happened unless they were planning on being intimate. It was just that he didn't want the boys to interrupt this conversation no matter how much he loved them, and now STAR and Fri would respect that privacy too unless there was an emergency.
team. The Avengers trained together multiple times a week and participated in 'bonding sessions' that had been first ordered by Fury but quickly became second nature.
He wasn't getting armor the way Pepper was, but somehow... somehow he suspected that he was going to look a hell of a lot more like Iron Man when it came to his color scheme. With each Tony egging the other on, there was no way they would be able to resist decking him out entirely in Iron Man's signature colors. He didn't mind though, not when he knew it was code for how much Tony cared. And as much as he might try to deny it... well. He sure was looking forward to having the shield back on his arm again.
Few notes! I doubt anyone remembers Ben - the contractor from the very first story. He's the one who fixed up the common floor and Tony now has him on retainer for all his most personal projects. Ben is also dating Pepper, which is something that happens in a side-story I haven't sat down to write yet. :'D Someday all of those will be written and put up. Someday.
Eventually they ended up on the sort of shitty couch that Tony kept in the workshop, the 'bots now making a safer scene with specialized cans of silly string and bits of confetti. Steve knew he'd be helping them clean up later, but that was more than okay. He was in love with a gorgeous genius who cared about everything more than most people could ever guess; amazingly enough the guy loved him back. And while yeah, he could die happy... he would give everything he had to keep on living so he could stay with Tony.
to me and I know I messed up but... but... Look, if you could just get him to give me another chance I
"Do you know how terrifying it was to wake up and find your bots in the mansion?" There was an edge to Shellhead's voice, a hint of anger finally coming through the purposefully bland front he'd been putting up. "Those are your fucking
Thankfully he had other people whose good opinion of him he wanted to keep so he could ignore that urge. He set the glass down instead of downing its contents and leaned his left hip against the bar. Steve and Rogers were still trying to stare each other down, Nat's gaze was flicking between Steve and STAR, and Sam was calmly taking them all in and probably trying to determine a point of weakness to attack should it be necessary. A mean, petty part of him hoped the guy thought Pepper would be the one to go after, because she would absolutely destroy him. Probably without even chipping her nail polish.
"Teeth in! I was gonna say teeth in! Jesus fuck." Steve didn't have time to yell at Harley for emulating the way he spoke, so the tiny terror just shot a glare over his shoulder. As soon as he had, Tiny Adorable Steve had braced himself again, an immovable force set in front of them as Natasha headed their way. Not that she got far - Jessica stepped into her path suddenly enough that the assassin hit her and bounced off. Jess just sighed and looked off into the distance, pretending she didn't give a fuck about what was going on.
"We're not spying! We just... look, I know that sometimes you get yourself into trouble, and I was worried that without me here--"
“Woah!” Clint’s concern was overblown - he had hardly even stumbled after launching himself into the air. U had been ready with a handy strut so really everything was fine. Clint didn’t need to follow after him… but it was kind of sweet that he did it anyway. “Tony, I was only a little serious about that whole life or death thing. Why are you--”
"We had a connection!" There were tears standing out in his eyes, and Steve had a feeling that there had been a speech he planned to give only to have it all fall apart now that he was here. "You... you promised after that mess with Ultron that you wouldn't... you fucking promised, Tony. We didn't know anything about it until the news picked it all up and then we didn't even know if you were alive for a while. You aren't allowed to disappear, because maybe dads leave but you aren't my dad so you don't get to just disappear like that and then not even call me once since you got back home!" He seemed to very suddenly realize there was someone else in the room, because his tears abruptly shifted to anger. "You've got time to shack up with some pretty blond, but you can't pick up a fucking phone?"
Time and I working together means we can spare some of our power to keep your body from, well. Disintegrating. We're choosing to work through you, so we won't burn you up Steve. I promise.
Sure he'd have Buck - maybe, an ugly voice inside had whispered sometimes, unless his best friend and brother found a woman that could keep his interest, and then what what he want with small, skinny, needy Steve - but there wasn't a white picket fence at the end for him. Wasn't even going to be a lousy apartment he could barely afford, at least not one that had a wife and kids living there with him. No, little Stevie Rogers wasn't what any dame was looking for, and anyhow it was only a matter of time before a winter came that was too long and too cold for him to survive.
Well. He was staying the fuck out of all of it. He even left that damn knife right where it was - Winter was a big boy who could clean up his own messes. Instead he chose to flop down on one of the cozy looking chairs in the room and pulled out his phone. There was probably a few hours to kill before he headed home, so long as nothing else went horribly wrong.
"Dunno much about shoulds and shouldn'ts. Don't have much use for 'em, ta be honest. I'd rather focus on doin' what's right for both-a us, not worry about what other people think we oughta be doin'. I love Buck like a brother, I do... but if me goin' ain't right for us... well. That's what’s most important ta me. So I can wait. Pegs'n Lokes'n Shellhead'n all the others will make sure he's taken care of. When you're ready we'll both go visit."
Steve smiled at him, all good humor and warmth. “Sure. If you say so. And if I wanna share the gunk our son got all over me with our other kids… well. How’re you gonna stop me?” Eyes still locked with his, Steve scooped up a handful of the slime on his shirt and smeared it over one of Dum-E struts.
was important, and that he had to go meet him. Tony was being stubborn about... something, and their oldest girl was pretty much refusing to give him the full story out of fear that he'd get stubborn too. It was all very close to being too much, and dammit he needed to try and take this seriously.
"Is that right?" There was a smile playing around Cap's mouth again, and Tony hated the thrum of happiness that started up in his veins. "Well I'm gonna have to disappoint you, I guess. 'Cause I can't think of anythin' I could tell you that'd compare to that."
"A house." Tony shifted enough that Steve's feet were comfortably in his lap and absently began to rub them as he thought out loud. "It would take too long to get one built. I wouldn't mind a fixer upper though. I'm pretty handy, and I bet I could teach you how to use tools too. We could turn it into a fun DIY project. I mean. If you're going to buy the place then we're going to be keeping it for more than just the vacation right?" The way Tony said 'we' had his stomach fluttering pleasantly. He liked the acknowledgement that things were
"Butterfingers won't take nothin' that's really special, you know? I left my compass down here once or twice'n it was always right where I left it. When I left those swanky colored pencils you bribed me with he didn't bother those neither. So he he knows, you know? That some stuff isn't for taking'n that some things aren't for playing with. And U's always trying to manage his brothers, same as you are. Has about as much success as you too." He was afraid to look up at Tony, terrified that maybe he was getting this all wrong. "He looks out for 'em, tries to make sure they won’t go poking at things that'd hurt 'em. And yeah, he runs over my feet but I know he feels bad about it. Whenever it happens he brings me somethin' before I leave, some little scrap of metal that he's shaped or once a bit of some glass or something that he polished until it was mirror-bright. Just you watch - he'll give me something to say 'sorry' before I get outta the room, bet your bottom dollar."
On nights when Fury weeded out the guest list to get maximum manipulation for his buck, Steve stuck pretty damn close to either him or Bruce. Nobody fucking messed with Bruce Banner at the little soirees, not even when Captain America was clearly using him as a shield. Tony was so good at distracting anyone who came over that they usually walked away smiling and without saying much to Steve at all.
show her his initial floor plans. "That would have been over the top. But this... I think this could be good for all of you. Now that you aren't at each other's throats, anyway."
"The 'worried as hell about Tony Stark' club. Used to call it the 'I love that asshole even when I want to kill him and I wish he wasn't so good at nearly getting himself killed' club, but Pepper said that was too long. She's scary enough that I let her change it. Sit down and pop a couple of these open, will you? That man takes it out of me. I argued with him for forty minutes about going down to the workshop. Almost caved when he cried."
Steve thought about the Sokovia Accords, and he thought about the dream he'd had of Tony and Ross. He remembered SHIELD and how it had fallen in this world, and he remembered how his ignorance of the politics in his world had almost sunk his team a time or two.
leave one of them wanting for anything when he was gone, and he sure as fuck wouldn't leave the company to only one of them. "You've got to know--"
"I had plans, you Star Spangled jerk," Tony whispered between chuckles before pressing another too-smiley kiss against his lips.
Steve just had a thing about touching. He had noticed how uncomfortable Tony was and now wanted to protect him. It wasn’t a couple thing - it was a friend thing.
"What..." He would never acknowledge the way Tony had to stop and clear his throat, too choked up to keep talking. "What names were you thinking of?"
God, he was pathetic. He didn't really know that Tony wanted a dog and he was already planning on them being pet co-parents. But surely it wasn't that different than the 'bots - he always called them his kids now, and the genius never objected. He'd taken to Tony's kids, and if he brought the pup home then he was sure Tony would do the same for her.
"I did not! Well, perhaps a time or two, but Steven is hardheaded enough to withstand even the mightiest of blows!" Steve would have told him to pull the act back a little if he could actually talk.
"Mmm." A soft, sweet kiss later Tony sighed and pressed his face against Steve's neck. It was a tickly feeling that he loved, and he squeezed the man briefly in return. "They can... I'm not ready to visit there yet, but I don't want... they're your friends. Your team. I know you miss them. So if they want... they're always welcome here. Even... even your Bucky," the shiver of fear in the name meant that Steve wouldn't be inviting his finally-found, misused brother any time soon. "Could come tripping the light fantastic and stop in."
Tony almost spit his latest sip of tea out at the hint of humor that had left Captain America's mouth. He choked and spluttered for a second, and when he managed to swallow and then look up he got another surprise. The guy looked almost smug, with a hint of a smile playing around his mouth and eyes. Bruce was play-scowling - another victory even if it didn't belong to him - and it was kind of awesome.
"Pffft. More like he and Ned are building Lego stuff. He just doesn't wanna be here because this is--"
sending the kids away, had cried right along with Steve when they had to pry their shirts out of metal claws while ignoring their plaintive, desperate whistles. The boys had been far less understanding than STAR. "But we could make sure the rest of the kids were safe. We figured even if Thanos did get his snap on--"
He wasn't jealous that Steve had gotten along so well with that other Tony, but hearing stories always made him just a little sad. It was like looking in a funhouse mirror and finding the distorted reflection was so much better than reality. He couldn't help but feel like he'd gotten the shaft while that other Tony - Shellhead - had hit the jackpot... and that wasn't fair. Shellhead's life hadn't been perfect by any means from what Steve had told him. They'd both gone through their share of shitty situations, and they both had their triumphs and low points.
Winter was suddenly at his back, and clapped one hand on the kid's shoulder to gently move him out of the way. Where Harley suggested and might have burst into tears if denied, Winter just acted. He went to Steve's bed first, mouth a thin line as he brushed a lank piece of hair off his friend's forehead. Then he squared his shoulders, put both hands on the side of the bed, and began to shove it toward Tony's.
"I don't have to do anything." The lazy, smug arrogance in Winter's voice probably shouldn't have made him as proud as it did. "Not anymore. But I am choosing to do this, so don't worry so much Stevie. Besides," he shrugged, the motion making Steve think of mountains slowly shifting. "Tony Stark did not have to help me but he did. It is my turn to... pay it forward. Terrible movie." Winter was adorable when he wrinkled his nose. Probably wouldn't appreciate being told that though, so he kept his mouth shut. "I don't know why your Antosha made me watch it."
"Yeah, okay." She sniffled a little, squeezing his hand. "I'll see if I can fit that into my schedule. The color?"
to herd him towards the couch. The big comfy one they usually used to watch movies, not one of the smaller ones grouped in front of the gaming consoles. He had a feeling he was about to be surrounded and forced into a pile of cuddles, and it was definitely not the worst thing in the world. Hell, he'd admit to himself and maybe Steve that he actually loved the nights when they all snuggled down with blankets and hot chocolate together to pick apart some poor, innocent movie that had only been doing its best to entertain them. Nothing was safe from their varied tastes, not even things Tony counted as sacred classics... and he fucking loved it.
What Tony didn’t understand was why lately he was always in the middle of those mostly playful fights.
Dum-E and U swung between desperate concern and easy acceptance of the new normal. STAR and Fri had found a way to explain it so it made sense to their brothers. Steve suspected the boys were waiting for someone to come and do either maintenance or an upgrade on their glitching parents. Both of their girls were a Godsend, and he appreciated everything they were doing to help.
to just melt into it and beg Tony to never let go. Even if he'd spent all day working, he still smelled so good - like money, Buck would say with a grin - and Steve was finally,
He forced his attention back to the matter at hand - exterminating the last of the demon dogs. There was at least an end in sight now, with their ranks shrinking instead of swelling. The clean-up of hell hounds went even faster once the Benatar broke through the clouds, firing on the monsters while the hatch opened to spit out Quill, Gamora, Nebula and Drax. It was a breeze after that, and much sooner than Tony would have anticipated the din of battle was replaced with the unnerving silence that always came after.
"We're going to need them," he said quietly as his eyes tracked her. If he started to see any smoke or if anything burst into flames he was definitely going to have to act. It was a good thing Dum-E had been banished along with U, STAR, Harley and Laney for the duration of this little talk or his oldest would already have a fire extinguisher in hand. "I know you and Steve and Rhodey don't want to admit it and Viz is only a little better, but... we're gonna need all of them when the next intergalactic big bad comes knocking at our door. So we need--"
He laughed at that, because he knew that Steve knew the Senator’s name. The man was a fan, always stumbling over his words and doing his best to get on Captain America’s good side. He had boasted numerous times that they were on speaking terms - practically a first name basis - and Steve had been asking for his name every time they met since. The venerable Senator denied climate change and took a dim view on vaccinations. Between that and the vaguely misogynistic attitude, Steve practically foamed at the mouth when he talked about the politician in private.
"Okay, so ya made a mistake," he allowed. Buttering Tony up and painting too rosy a picture wouldn't work, after all. It'd just make him dig his heels in all the harder. "But I also know ya never woulda taken him ta Berlin if you'd known that Rogers'n them would be fightin' like it was for keeps. So now ya know better and ya can move forward -
Phew! Meant to have this up earlier today, but Supernatural and a new game on my phone distracted me. XD
"Yeah. Not leavin' his side for a while yet." Steve gave him a gentle squeeze and he let his eyes slide shut as he sighed. It was still so hard to believe that Steve was there, that he had come back. That he was staying. That only happened in his wildest, most unrealistic dreams. Shit like this didn't happen to him, not ever, and he wasn't quite sure what to do with it. He didn't know if he was quite ready to really believe that Steve wouldn't be leaving again.
“Listen my friends! We must not forget the merits of the most soulful of cooking. They are running a special on jumbalaya--”
"No. One last chance ta walk, and I gotta be honest here - part-a me really hopes ya don't take it. Been itchin' ta kick your ass for years now." He found that a lot sweeter than he probably should, because he knew that his Tiny Adorable Steve meant it. Rogers had hurt him, and his
with Pepper on his right and Steve pressed against his left side, one Iron Man gauntlet on and the rest of his suit at the ready. Maybe he'd get out of this without physical injury or massive property damage after all.
There was so much history and love in that well-worn exchange, more than he would ever be able to explain to anyone. From the soft smile on Steve's face and the sweet look in his eyes, he didn't even need to try. His
But maybe he was just a little more present than Tony had given him credit for. One fist loosened, then turned so his open palm was facing upward. It was easy in that moment to slip his hand there. Steve immediately settled his fingers between Tony's and squeezed.
"Instead he thinks ya hate him. Didn't know how ta tell him that ya hate yourself more'n ya could ever hate anyone else."
Besides... he was never leaving Tony again. This was his world now, and he was going to learn everything he needed to in order to be a part of it.
"Come on in." He stepped back and opened the door wider while gesturing Rhodes in. "I haven't been sleeping so well myself." Or at all, really. Even if he might have managed to do it in a few more minutes, he wouldn't begrudge Rhodes the company. Not when the guy looked so drawn and tired; not when he was Tony's best friend. "Might as well stay awake together. Any of that beer for me?"
"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We are not going to only get tacos - dessert is the best part of any meal. Because I am a generous man, I will let you decide if we're going for ice cream or pastries. And Steve? I said some shitty things that I didn't mean back then, and I thought after that you wouldn't want to be anything more than teammates. Super happy to know I was wrong, but this is absolutely not the bribe I am using to buy your silence. We're friends, I'm sorry for that bad first impression, and now we will never speak of that again. Hey, how are you on art supplies? Because I can definitely see using art supplies to keep you from running your mouth."
It was a constant struggle. If Tony ever agreed to go steady with him, Steve knew that he'd manage to brag about his fella at least twice in every conversation he had. Fury was going to love that.
"Please. Dum would steal it back before I even sat down." That was annoyingly true. He had to come up with a better punishment. "And what the hell are ya talkin' about?"
Once Peter Parker and his Aunt May were tucked neatly into their family unit, he had a feeling Tony might even be thankful for it.
He also wasn’t thinking about how Captain America managed to look both adorable and sexy in his grandpa-style clothes... but that was mostly because he worried it would read on his face. Captain America wouldn't like having another man think of him like that, no sirree. So in case of sudden mind-reading spells, abilities, aliens or monsters or some shit, Tony only thought about that kind of thing when he was alone in the penthouse.
When he finally chanced a look over at Tony, his breath immediately caught in his throat. There was an intensity in the genius' eyes that was usually only there when he was working on a particularly fascinating bit of engineering. At the same time some invisible bit of tension seemed to have vanished, and Steve only noticed it had been there at all now that it was gone. Suddenly Tony broke out into the brightest, most brilliant smile he'd ever seen. He felt almost blinded by it, dizzy with the possibility that
that even seeing it has you on the edge of a panic attack, because I've only ever seen it used to protect our team and the civilians caught in the crossfire. Pisses me off that you had to see it used against you instead. So we're gonna get rid of this fucking paint job, and we're gonna repaint it with something a lot more
Then Magneto had almost killed him and Steve was forced to let go of that happy delusion. He could lose Tony forever in the blink of an eye and he wasn't... he didn't know how he was supposed to survive that. If Tony ever... ever died... it would be like losing everything all over again.
The near-silence was heavy, almost uncomfortable and kept from smothering him only by the presence of his siblings. Moments from the battle kept flashing through his mind, all the little things that had gone wrong and could have gone so much worse. He couldn't help but play them over and over, trying to figure out what he could have done differently, done better. And while he tried not to give in to all the gruesome imaginings of the worst case scenarios, he couldn't keep them all at bay. There'd been a moment while fighting the cave troll that he'd been
"So I'll put Shellhead on that ta keep him from whinin' and moanin' about not pickin' out the spot. Are we lookin' just for property or a house?"
He mourned what could have been as he headed towards the room Harley and Peter had commandeered on their floor. He could hear music - loud, annoying, slightly awkward music - blaring as soon as he got close. Underoos was still trying to sell the stuff he listened to, but Tony knew Harley wasn't buying. His curly haired human kid was firmly on the side of AC/DC, Black Sabbath, and other classic and timeless bands. At least he was humoring his brother now instead of throwing his phone into the trash.
He ended most drawing visits to Tony's workshop by setting up a mug full of his favorite pencils, but he never started out having it handy. Butterfingers like to take the mug and hide the pencils, and the silly 'bot would spend at least five minutes engaging Steve in a game of keep-away that almost always meant he wasn’t doing the real work Tony had given him. U would chase after the both of them, scolding in whistles, until Tony threatened to send them
Getting take-out after training became a ritual. It was sort of awesome the way Captain America could use one 'aw, shucks mister' look to keep SHIELD's cafeteria staff from complaining about them bringing in outside food like that. Sort of sucked that they had to eat in the cafeteria instead of being actually comfortable, but it was fine.
"Or lookin' at ya outside of battle. But he don't hate ya. Lokes'd throw ya outta the mansion if he did. Shellhead just needs some more time, is all."
STAR burst out of the Nightmare Beast, leaving a gaping wound that Rhodey and Shellhead didn't take immediate advantage of - they were too busy staring at him. Winter, below him, wasn't as useless in the moment. The soldier immediately began to fire into that open wound, widening it, and then Harley zoomed in to follow his example. Almost immediately  the thing gave a death cry, then fell to the earth; as it did, its form wavered and then it was only a twisted piece of metal, no hint of the creature Thanos had turned it into.
been impressed on her few walks through the facility to meet with Fury to discuss what SI was and was not willing to help the organization with. "I know I would want to get out of there as soon as possible. The whole place is so depressing."
"Really? 'Cause when Winter first shook it off, he was full-a rage and fear in spades. He'd go from holin' up in the walls of the mansion like a damn rat ta breakin' people's bones without any kind-a warnin' at all. He wouldn't hardly speak ta nobody, and when he did it was mostly in Russian or sometimes German." Not that he'd been around much for that, but he'd both heard the stories and seen the tapes of those first months of Winter's freedom. "Some days he still can't talk in nothin' but that, 'cause as much as I want him ta magically be all better and whole, he's fucked up and he always will be. Maybe Carol didn't give me the details, but Bucky has ta be goin' through some-a that stuff too. She wouldn't have called Winter in otherwise."
"Fuck no. I'd be a terrible farmer and so would you. Mostly I liked the idea of being away from the city, out in the country surrounded by nothing but wilderness. Fuck, that sounds corny. I just have always been in the city or at the beach. For a vacation I want something different. Quiet. With maybe space to build a kick-ass workshop to play around in with the kids."
Right. We've received some concerns that Mr. Stark may be attempting to repeat the Ultron Experiment.
Before he'd finished saying her name she had the stand lit up. Like Rescue, the suit it held was brand-spanking new and gleamed softly. Gone was all the red, white and blue and not just because it made him remember a shield coming down on his chest. Steve and he had talked a little about what he wanted and what he didn't. One thing he'd been adamant about was not 'stealing' Captain America.
His hands jumped from where they'd landed on Clint's shoulders to draw up a slew of schematics and models that he was working on with his minions at SI. Having all that bright blue light floating around them would hopefully keep Steve from becoming suspicious. Tony never had an empty plate, so if there weren't any plans up at all he would smell something rotten in the state of Denmark.
"Nah. Just meant to be yours all along even with worlds separatin' us." The sweet words and kiss he got to go along with them didn't fully compute with the way Steve's hands were already working at his clothes. His
"Fuck. Harley, you don't have to follow us. We'll still be connected, and no matter where we live you'll
mine. Now we are Avengers, so the both of us belong to you. Also to Tony, Thor and Bruce. So he's not mine alone, but he
With Clint on one side of the large, heavy drop cloth and U ‘helping’ on his side, they managed to get Tony’s latest project covered in time. Everything on the table was largely still in pieces, so hopefully the spy who’d dropped in wouldn’t be able to get enough information to sing. Or maybe…
at him, and this wasn't how it was supposed to go. They snapped and snarled at each other when they weren't ignoring or circling each other warily. They weren't friends or the kind of people who just joked around... but there Cap was with a shit-eating 'what are you gonna do about it' kind of grin on his face. He was even rocking back and forth on his heels, like he was expecting Tony to break rank and give chase, like this was all a big game.
"Yeah? Me too,"  he murmured, heart and stomach fluttering wildly. This was... Christ, it was everything he'd wanted for so long, and he couldn't help but catch those lips in another kiss, and then another. "Ten years worth."
slammed into him and he saw white while he hurtled towards the ground. It took a second and some fancy footwork to get out from the debris; he managed just before it crashed it a spray of metal. His left arm was numb - it so often was - but the rest of his vitals were good. Minor contusions and hairline fractures were just... hazards of the job.
This chapter was hard because I'm mostly laying the foundations for what's coming, so I feel like nothing really happened. XD I promise more plot and such in the next chapters to come!
"I've had just about enough of you. I really wanted to talk to Tony first, help him understand what was going on before I took you down. He was alone and vulnerable, and it's not his fault he fell for this - like I said, he gets in trouble when I'm not around." And wow, was that condescending as fuck. "But I'm willing to be flexible."
"It's a magic thing," Tony interrupted quickly, then tugged Steve over to join him on his sofa. "A bullshit magic thing that I am very grateful for. So he's Steve, but not Steve Grant."
me? We are going to a bar right now and I want to hear the whole story, start to finish. In return you can pick one of my missions and I'll tell you what
"Not really. But if I'm translating right... that means we're going. Grab your coat or he's gonna start poutin'."
"I'll give ya a rubdown later as a thanks. Maybe even a sexy one." If neither of them were too tired, anyway, which had happened a lot since waking up after the battle. Getting away from all the demands on their time might help fix that. He hoped it would, because otherwise he was out of ideas. Lokes would have some though, and so probably would Loki and both Doctors Strange. The side effect wouldn't last forever, probably, and with enough downtime surely they would both get back to being 100%.
Memory came back all at once, making him tense and then go boneless on the bed. The Black Order had been defeated, the day and the Infinity Stones saved. Worrying about Thanos could wait just a little longer - just long enough to kick the Defenders back to their own world. What the fuck they'd been thinking was anyone's guess. They'd left their world, well,
"No, that was you and Peter. I spent that whole talk laughin' at you idiots. Besides, if you think Parker isn't gettin'--"
"Tony I ain't... I told ya, didn't I? I'm not goin' back without ya, and not without our kids neither."
She was still nameless, because he'd wanted to talk about that with Tony. He'd thought that they could agree on a name together; he wanted so badly for them to be taking care of the dog as partners. He couldn't call her 'princess' forever though, and he couldn't keep waiting on Tony. So he'd taken to jotting down names on scraps of paper, searching for one that felt right.
"Aw, Harls. Come here." He helped when Tony tried to rearrange himself, earning a smile and a quick kiss. Once the man was propped up on him and several layers of pillows, there was enough space on the other side of the bed that he could open his arms. "Come on, I need a hug and so do you."
It sort of hurt to have her remove or adjust parts of his designs, but he trusted her taste and judgment. Besides, that was a stupid thing to be upset about so he shoved the feeling down deep where it belonged.
Spear chick was doing a decent job of fending Fri's attack off - from the bit of debris at her feet, she'd even managed to disable a few of the weapon orbs completely. He might have respected that if he didn't want her the hell off his lawn. "Give me a hole, Fri." Immediately the orbs shifted, clustering more densely in most places to give him a clean shot. The cluster cannon felt right, and he activated it quickly; as the cannons on his back unfolded, Captain Marvel closed in from the other side. FRIDAY was amazing so she adjusted her orbs without being asked, all of them still firing and making a nuisance of themselves. The chick with the spear was so distracted that she didn't notice Captain Marvel until one glowing fist had almost reached her - she never noticed Tony's attack at all.
sorry. Tony, how can you even think about working with them again? After everything they--" Pepper whirled away from him to start pacing, heels snapping sharp enough against the floor that he expected to see sparks. Her face was a beautiful mask of rage, and the way the ends of her hair were starting to twist and curl had nothing to do with her movement. No, the heat wafting off her body was causing it to stir, and he had the idle thought that maybe he was about to see her control snap for the first time since she'd fought so hard to get it.
Steve never seemed to really care what they ate. It was probably because of the whole ‘spent most of my childhood going hungry’ thing.
But the break-in was only STAR and the boys. Seeing the ‘bot he’d so carefully crafted for Steve caused the tears building in his eyes to finally fall, dripping over his cheeks and down his chin. It looked like she was vibrating, but she stayed where she was perched on Dum-E’s claw, wrapped around her brother tightly. Maybe his oldest was worried that he would hurt her, because he was moving incredibly slowly and carefully.
Thank fuck the Nightmare Beast had grabbed one of the Iron Legion next, because his poor AI armor was slowly
"As fun as this is I would like you all to leave my tower pretty much now, so. To what do I owe the dubious honor of this visit?"
He was the one to break eye contact, swallowing hard before glancing toward the couches. Both Thor and Rhodes were watching with rapt attention which would have been bad enough. It was the judgmental arch of the latter's brow that really got to him, making his cheeks go even hotter. Another hard swallow almost brought enough moisture back to his mouth to talk, but it took just a little too long. When he turned his attention back to Tony the man looked concerned and that wasn't what Steve had been aiming for.
By the time dinner rolled around Tony was usually exhausted, so he could shoo everyone else gently away and get some more time alone with his fella. Well, his fella and their metal kids, because the three 'bots had a hard time not being with at least one of them. Steve got it completely so he never scolded or tried to force them to 'sleep' elsewhere. Their charging stations just managed to fit in their bedroom, and as a temporary solution it worked just fine. Sleep was a careful, cautious affair so he didn't disturb Tony too much but he didn't mind because at least the genius was back in his arms.
Sam still had hero worship in his expression, but it was waning. Tony wondered if being on the run the way they were was dimming some of that golden boy shine that hung around Rogers. He wondered if the man knew he was no longer a Reservist; Sam Wilson had been given the Other Than Honorable Conditions discharge around the same time as Tony had finally been given the go-ahead to fly back to the states. Natasha was more put together than either man, of course, but he could still see signs of wear. Most notable was the hint of expression he could see in her eyes, in the nearly non-existent lines around her mouth. He couldn't quite figure out what that elusive, barely there emotion might be... but part of him hoped it was shame.
So I realized that in my last set of notes I didn't say that I wouldn't be able to post this last Sunday. :o I knew that with everything going on I wouldn't be able to get everything all set until today... which is why Wednesday is my other day that I'll post if I get a chapter done soon enough. XD
Warmth crept over his neck and ears as happiness made his heart swell. They'd never... they called the boys and Star and FRIDAY their kids, but they hadn't ever really stated it so firmly before. Not out loud anyway. He pressed a kiss to Tony's hairline and tried to hide just how damn pleased he was.
"But it was the right thing to do." He pulled Steve closer, squeezing the man's trembling fingers with his own. "We would have come through ourselves to explain things if we hadn't been running short on time."
for them. He couldn't wait for his dad - it had still been dad then - to find Captain America and bring him home. Tony couldn't wait to meet his hero.
"Bet it's not even close to the craziest story you have. I might have to try and get you drunk so I can hear more." He just rolled his eyes at the tease, shoving against Clint without actually pushing him away. When he looked back up, Captain America's expression was strangely tight as he looked between them, and he couldn't help but flinch a little. It was like he offended the guy just by existing sometimes.
Steve's eyes automatically went to his lover, and he saw the merit in the suggestion. Tony was grey under his tan, near to drooping with exhaustion. His left arm was back in a sling after FRIDAY had tattled the man's vitals to the medical team. There were cuts and bruises littered on what skin he could see - none of them had gotten away unscathed. Rogers was still fussing over Bucky, and Carol was watching over both Frank and Tokra who were the worst wounded. Even Harley's right knee was in a brace, and Steve was sure there were contusions all over his son's body that he hadn't been told about. He wanted to take them
"I saw the memorial for him. Would it be okay if I, you know. Made something? He wasn't mine, but--"
Mr. Stark has equipped the Avengers for years. It would be ludicrous of him not to offer his expertise in this matter. And despite what everyone seems to believe, Mr. Stark learns from his mistakes and works hard to keep from repeating them. He is also very clear-eyed when it comes to what is required to implement something like this. Having one person or one viewpoint be solely in charge of a project of this magnitude wouldn't work. Not only would it risk overlooking innovations that could be the key to saving lives, it wouldn't make people feel very safe during times of peace. As ideas are developed and tested, they will be presented to the UN before any implementation occurs on a large scale. They can be voted down just like any measure, Mr. Poppleton, and I resent the implication otherwise from you and a few other members of the Committee.
A huge reason for that had shifted to stand in front of him, Tiny But Fierce like so many Avengers and Defenders were. Steve was resolute in his mission to keep any of them from so much as looking at him funny. He had a feeling there would be broken bones if any of them actually tried to approach him.
"No you wooon't," he sing-songed before pressing a loud smooch on Tony's temple just to be obnoxious. "You love me and would never make me homeless that way. Because I can't go back to living at SHIELD after such extravagance, Tony. I just can't. Also, I am deeply wounded that you think I would do anything at all to a drink of yours. Cut to the core. Hey Steve, you wanna come with?"
The quiet, inappropriate jokes Tony was cracking probably didn't help as much as his hands running up and down Harley's back. Steve's own hand was on his shoulder, awkwardly trying to offer a little comfort. For all that 'boy toy' talk, the kid did seem to appreciate it. Or at least the look the teen sent his way seemed to hold more gratitude than irritation. Could have just been his own wishful thinking though.
"Mm-hmm. They're delicious." He pressed a kiss to Tony's temple, reveling in his ability to do it and the surprised delight in the man's voice. "Maybe she can make a celebratory one for the both of us. Thor bought me Iron Man pajamas a little while back. I wear them so much there's already holes in ‘em."
"Team building exercises are actually good for something. Who knew?" Tony kept his voice light, refusing to think of the one Avenger who was still stiff and awkward around him. "We should implement some of SHIELD's techniques at SI. Maybe a retreat where our workers can all shoot paintballs at each other and play capture the flag."
was the one on glaive guy while Tony was all-around air support; they had been too far apart for most of the battle. He hated it, but it was necessary.
Someday he would return of his own volition, bringing his children and his lover with him, and Soul's realm would be filled with the laughter and love their souls would bring. Waiting was no hardship, not for an Infinity Stone.
