Two users appear and ask other questions of the room and John watches the screen with interest, waiting for guest_47995 to respond. It’s another entire page of text input before an alert pops up on the right hand side: “guest_47995 has left the chat.”
John reckons that a psychotherapist would have a field day, with the two of them.
He stares at his reflection a bit long and then in a fit of pre-date-
John’s thrown for a moment, by Sherlock’s change in posture–he’s sitting taller now, has reached out to cup his palms around John’s knees. It’s such a stark difference from five minutes ago that John almost asks him to wait a moment, to slow down. But if this is how it has to happen, all fits and starts and nothing at all like he imagined it, then so be it. “Is it?”
John chuckles to himself as it all falls into place in his mind. Tongue catching at the corner of his lips, he pecks away eagerly at his response.
Sherlock felt a warmth pool in his stomach; John had remembered exactly what he said. “Indeed,” Sherlock pressed, “tell me about it.”
The heat around his fingertip was encompassing and Sherlock couldn’t help but extrapolate the pressure that was gripping his digit to think about what it would feel like wrapped around his cock. It was nearly too much, and he felt his cock throb almost painfully at the thought.
“Hm?”
John is up and out of his seat in an instant. “Oh god, yes.”
Molly took a step back, huffed, but was not deterred “Listen, just because you don’t like to have fun-”
Is it wrong to spend time with John under the guise of a case? It likely isn’t the best avenue, but Sherlock finds himself rather confused. Are there rules about this? Surely there are. But this isn’t a date, so perhaps there aren’t.
“Great, I might call it,” John says, mouth turned into a mock frown.
John frowns at himself, wonders what exactly he has to lose and stands, clutching his cane. “Yeah, yeah alright.” He tosses the rest of his takeaway in a nearby bin and follows Mike out onto the pavement.
“Where’s John? And
sends a warm thrill racing through him. It feels almost like… flirting. It feels like what he’s been doing with Guest but so much more
It fills John with a sweet, buoyant glee, at how uninhibited and ridiculous Sherlock is being.
John’s mouth twists. “Oh you poor, arrogant arsehole genius. I feel so sorry for you. Have I hurt your feelings?”
There were only a few athletes waiting outside the warming hut, all chatting cautiously, and Sherlock rounded them swiftly so as not to get caught up in conversation. He didn’t ask who’d already taken a training run and he didn’t care to know; Sherlock always preferred taking his first run blind, just letting his mind soak up the specifics of the course.
After a laugh, John is back to it, holding Sherlock open, teasing him with light pressure. Tongue and then lips, tongue again and then a good suck. He somehow manages to keep Sherlock on edge, varying his pressure and his strokes. When he adds a gentle finger, Sherlock releases a moan so tortured that it sounds like pain.
“This line of work is… not without the threat of danger. The Met does ask me to consult on traumatic cases, murder scenes and the like. Not to say that I
it. Can’t quite say I’ve seen that look on you before.”
He suggests dinner, finding it easy to slip into the fantasy that they’re on holiday together. They’re a couple, going about their evening as any other couple would.
John, at his side, said nothing, but Sherlock felt his right hand curling into a fist between them. Sherlock gave the slightest hint of pressure back.
And being back at all, well, that was something else entirely, something that pricked under his skin, though not in a completely bad manner. It was as though something was warring within him, spurring him to make some sort of decision he couldn’t put his finger on just yet.
John huffed, “I most certainly did not! You just… look like the type of man who likes a good... experiment?”
“Oh,” John said, a little surprised but mostly amused; his eyes crinkled in good humor and his tongue peeked to wet his lower lip. “So you are a dick. Good to know some of the press got it right.” He shook his head and laughed, dipped his chin towards Sherlock as though conceding a point. “But you know all that from… what, the delegation dossier?”
Sherlock dipped his head suddenly, seeking out John’s lips and John obliged, their mouths slotting together just as eagerly as they had before. Sherlock didn’t step forward to urge the moment further and John stood his ground, hands still warm, covering Sherlock’s chest. It faded, Sherlock nipping one last time at John’s lower lip before pulling back to grin down at him. “Thank you for coming by this evening.”
Phillip had unsheathed the skis, settling them on the ski vice so that Molly could prep them and smooth them over with wax. Some skiers preferred to see to this on their own, but Sherlock trusted Molly, had for some time. She had her face down close to the surface and was pressing a shiny cloth from the tip to the end of the ski before pulling back. “Does anyone have my red stick? Not the pink one but the-”
“Can you tell us then, do you think he would have beaten you, had he skied?”
John’s gaze tore back across the room to meet Sherlock’s and they stared at one another for a long beat. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel that his entire future hinged on this one moment. He held his breath, his pulse hammering painfully in his throat while he waited for John’s decision.
Sherlock huffs a little laugh and moves to dot a kiss next to John’s left eye. “All those years,” Sherlock begins, and John takes a moment to become comfortable with Sherlock being sentimental; he’s a fragile being when he’s like this.
John feels a hot stab of rage sizzle down his spine; the sheer nerve of this Sherlock Holmes… “Or I’ll have you removed!”
There was blissful silence for a moment and then Moran appeared back in front of him. “You think I can just be bought?” He sounded amused, like he pitied Sherlock.“I’ve been working for Jim for years, I can’t just be
“Can be quite nice,” John says, moving to snatch up a bottle of hotel-offered shower gel. “Intimate.”
John smirks back, shifting so that he’s resting more loosely. “The hair product, the couture clothes, the penchant for the dramatic. You’re a stereotype!”
. No, no. They found out,” he says simply, shrugging his shoulders, like a throwaway.
“So much has changed, Shannon. So much."
“Here,” Sherlock urged, helping John to roll over onto his stomach; he grabbed a pillow and together they worked it under John’s hips, careful of the heavy erection that hung between his quivering thighs. “Yes, god, perfect,” Sherlock hummed as his palms reached out to grasp John’s arsecheeks. He squeezed experimentally, jiggled them together and John giggled. With a little smirk, Sherlock lifted this left hand and brought it down on John’s arsecheek in a light and playful slap. “None of that now.”
, this wonderful man. This wonderful man he’d almost
Delicately shifting through the contents, he searched until he could see what was beneath the waxes. Underneath it all was a small, weathered notebook, secured with paperclips and a rubber band. He extracted it carefully and worked it open.
He’d been silent for some time and he realized that the polite thing to do when one was treated to a meal was to thank the person who’d paid. “I will; next time is most certainly on me.” He was surprised at how level and even his voice sounded when inside he was so damned conflicted. “Thank you very much.”
Sherlock peeked up at John’s face, delighted to see that he’d been right, that John had covered his eyes with his arm and was silently cursing to himself. He chuckled against John’s left nipple as he moved to give it the same attention and that drew a groan from John, the vibrations from his laughter having caused a pleasurable rumble against John’s skin.
John hangs his head, drops his towel on the bannister and trudges back into the kitchen. “Yeah, hah. Thanks for that.”
associated with the Olympics. Shit, Sherlock, you know this might be moot; you don’t exactly have the most stellar of reputations, most people think you’re a right arsehole!”
, is the text from the unknown number, though the signature gives it away instantly; beneath the text is an image of his cane, leaning against the outer gate of the crime scene. He doesn’t wonder how Sherlock got his number, not after being regaled with talk of his skills, and it doesn’t really both John to begin with. What bothers John is how in the world he hadn’t noticed that he’d left his cane behind.
Sherlock finds he can’t figure out the first thing to add to the conversation.
“I’ve had worse, and the painkillers do their job. All of that combined with all of this excitement, I’d forgotten about it a bit. Yeah, thanks for bringing it up, actually.” John splashed at him and Sherlock chuckled, splashing back, as they fell into silence.
are, s’a bit shit of me.”
John ran his tongue over his bottom lip. “I don’t care about what happens to me, I care about-”
something. John rolls his shoulders, almost uncomfortable with how much he’s thinking about the presently, entirely-fictionalized life of Guest.
The flippant way Adam greets him, along with the careful manner in which he pushes his voluminous hair into place, makes Sherlock’s mouth tip into a genuine half-smile. Rippon proves himself to outwardly project a sort of confidence that Sherlock admires; he’s completely devoid of arrogance, but isn’t afraid or ashamed, instead embracing his eccentricities, playing them up for the cameras.
Moriarty and Moran fell back into whispering at one another and Sherlock craned his neck around to glance at the room, seeing if there was anything he could possibly use to his advantage. To his left was the bathroom and the hallway to the bedroom and to his right--
Sherlock runs an index finger along the lip of his glass and then picks it up to drink. “He and I’ve not met, we’re going to…”
“Mmm,” Sherlock glances out the window, at the people walking by, does his very best not to deduce their lives. “Not someplace one would generally come alone.”
Greg sipped at his coffee, eyes widening in disbelief. “You say yes, just like that? No argument at all?”
“Hey,” John huffs out, feeling his blood simmering, “I, uh, can we slow down?” John manages shakily, glancing up at Sherlock briefly; he slows the hands that are working Sherlock out of his clothing, tempering himself. His hands instead fall to the curve of Sherlock’s hips and hold.
“I can hear you splashing around in there. Swear to christ you’re half amphibious.”
: Is that what?
, he begins.
Sherlock scrunched up his brow, feeling an uncomfortable heat sizzle up his back. “Not a one,” he eventually replied as Moran sauntered back in, wishing he could reach out and take John’s hand to comfort him. The thought that he wouldn’t get to discover what was blooming between them, that he wouldn’t get to see what John looked like while making dinner or how he sounded when yelling at a bad program on television, the thought that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to do a thousand tiny, innocuous things with John--
,” Sherlock chants, eyes clear and open and present. They’re both wrecked, debauched beyond recognition.
With one hand flat against the plane of John’s stomach, Sherlock takes a breath and slides his mouth over John’s fullness, relaxing until he manages to take his entire length.
John was already seated at a table when Sherlock showed up, but Sherlock requested that they be seated in a more private spot on the second level; it wouldn’t do to have more paparazzi photos surface in the midst of his investigation. It was a delicate matter and Sherlock’s credibility would be on the line if he brought any damning evidence to light. He didn’t need the added stress of the media prying into his personal life alongside that.
“In my room,” Sherlock said with a grave finality.
for no discernible reason at all-he would hesitate if John weren’t… attractive.
Sherlock, rolling his head on his neck, glanced over at her with cool, disinterested eyes, placing her as one of the female snowboarders. His voice was sharp and crisp when he answered her, “Yes, thank you, I’m aware of the time.”
“Sherlock?” John asks and he’s tugged from the complex web of his own thoughts to focus on the information in front of him. He sinks back into his file with a feigned sense of purpose, and finds himself passing the short time examining the crime scene photos, simply for future reference.
Now was a time for reflection and contemplation.
“It’s very nearly midnight and-”
“But isn’t that what friends do?” Sherlock asks, freeing John’s wrists from buttons and fabric.
It's another moment before the Irish setter meanders into the kitchen, snuffles and then trots to Sherlock’s side. “How was your day?” Sherlock asks as he drops down to his knees to give his dog a very throughout scratching. “Mine was brilliant! New case, serial killer, they’re always so desperate to be caught!”
“It’s a very nice offer; I’d like to think on it a bit, if I might,” he says.
He grinned at the camera - it felt odd, but good - and then down at the snow at his feet. “I always feel as though I’m capable of a medal, though I can’t enter a race envisioning that; I attack the course with everything I have and focus on each aspect of the run as an individual segment-”
Sherlock pulled away and blinked, arrested for a moment by the light from the fire playing against John’s features. When he finally made eye contact with John, the only words he could manage were, “You’d… like me to?”
His pointer finger pokes at the screen gently and John glances up the road with a smile and finally crosses the street.
“Right, anyway. The bag.”
“Or, we could stay here and I could suck your cock,” Sherlock suggested.
He side-eyed the food for another beat before grabbing his watch, stunned to find that the time had gone half-nine.
that. He recalls a husband relating a tale of a home-cooked meal that ends with an argument. It all begins to make sense, the little things, the keys given and asked to be returned, the anniversaries and births and deeds signed. It’s people building their lives around one another, wanting that. It’s important, because that’s the minutia of a relationship.
John writes.
Sherlock’s left fingers splay just above John’s belly button and with the other hand, he reaches below to take John’s bollocks. He earns a shocked grunt for his efforts, and diverts his attention to direct his attention below. He’s startled a moment later when John’s left hand finds purchase in his hair and tugs; he gets one last lick at John’s perineum before he slides back up John’s body and is immediately taken in a fierce kiss, John’s tongue finding his immediately.
“That’s all it takes?” Sherlock asks, reaching over and switching off the light.
John grinned, the color high in his cheeks, and positioned himself so that his knees were on either side of Sherlock’s thighs. In this position they were nearly eye to eye.
“Right,” Sherlock says and takes a step toward John, thinks better of it, and shuffles backward. “How shall I…”
John’s voice, that careful neutrality caught Sherlock’s attention, and he moved his head around the flask in order to meet John’s eyes instead of putting the flask down.
But even then, mired in his grief, months after he’d watched soil dropped carelessly onto the lid of the casket, John knew he was doomed for eternity to live with lovesick regret. And it’s that— his recollection of the promises he’d made to himself, tear-streaked and burrowed into bed—that make his mouth move before he can think any better of it.
Upon properly pondering that thought, Sherlock clears his throat, shakes his head just so and
Sherlock tips his head back, silent for a moment. His right brow quirks in a perfect curve, “Savor it?” Sherlock asks with a note of genuine confusion in his tone, stepping away from John.
Because...
“Fuck christ, Sherlock, ah!” Immediately, John’s hands went to Sherlock’s hair and held. He rocked fluidly into Sherlock’s mouth, his breath hitching as he hit the back of Sherlock’s throat.
‘Moriarty and co. leaving. Need to know anything else?’
changed for him. He blew out a breath and considered. He felt the pain that was throbbing in his foot and his ribs flare back up and he acknowledged silently how close he’d come to death.
“Bloody--” was all he was able to get out before Moran was charging at him.

In the transport van, Sherlock settled his hand atop John’s where it lay on his chest. They were attached to IVs and two harried paramedics worked on cleaning their wounds.  It was cramped, not unlike an ambulance, and made even more so by the several members of the ethics commission who had accompanied them.
John manages to find a rhythm again, two strokes, three, and then Sherlock is tugging and saying “Yes,” and “More,” and “Oh Jesus, please, this is-” There are grunts, low, primal sounds that punch from John’s chest as he slams his hips, there are growls and groans from deep within Sherlock’s gut. Hands, everywhere, across a sweaty brow, trailing precome, fingers twisting and tugging at hair.
“If you’d like.”
“You know,
“Well, used to ski with my gramps, spent almost every holiday up north. He lived in Norway and that’s just what they did; he’d ski and he’d hunt. I was too short to really break onto the scene competitively but, well, it was a good workout, and I enjoyed it. And I was fairly good at it.”
Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock considers for a moment, tapping his chopsticks against his plate. “That garrotting I was telling you about. I placed the murderer by accurately comparing the strangulation marks on the victims by infiltrating a coffee shop in the area and using invisible dye to mark cups. From there I measured the grip range, and worked off of a fairly well-done psychological profile, looked to the regulars who frequented the shop and found the suspect.” Sherlock says it like it’s nothing, like it the most common solution in the world, but the genius of it stops John’s chewing.
: I guess what I’m saying is that I came back from where I was thinking I was of no use and then we met in that chat room
“Hey,” John says, stepping alongside Sherlock, close enough that he can feel the heat from Sherlock’s body.
“You know we have to go to the IOC with this,” John said carefully and quietly, bringing a palm up to slide carefully over Sherlock’s bicep. “There’s too much at stake. You’re in the final and you won’t be focusing on your race, you won’t be
For a long while, they sit and drink their beers in silence.  Sherlock finishes his and then clears his throat, his thumbs trailing up and down his empty glass. “Like the Oxymoron, then?”
and just what he was offering with that.
Luckily, a knock sounded at the door, snapping through the sweet tension, and Sherlock hastily made his way to the door, accepting their dinner. It took him a moment, but he wheeled the food-laden cart next to the coffee table and stood back, assessing the bounty.
Squinting in suspicion, he unlocked his device and scrolled down to the end of what appeared to be a blank text.
“The high flouro please,” she whispered down to the ski itself, reaching out blindly until the milky white block was placed in her hand. She ducked down once more, moving smoothly and methodically until she was satisfied with the job she had done.
?” Until that moment Sherlock didn’t know where John lived, but that knowledge was promptly superseded by acknowledging the fact that yes, it
Sherlock darted his tongue to wet the center of his upper lip; how intriguing John was. “Mmm, no.”
John finds that he has stopped walking, and takes a glance down at his own stockinged feet.
Sherlock sizes him up, makes a show of giving John the once-over. “Civil,” he tests. “Alright.”
John spends the most of the afternoon and early evening working on sprucing up his resume and developing a solid cover letter. He sends them both Molly’s way and leans back in his chair with his palms spread over his thighs. A feeling of accomplishment glows warm in his chest and he basks in it for a time, just sitting there.
, but just a bit, don’t want to come on too strong.” Sherlock looks so damned self-satisfied that John wants to throw his coffee at him. “A
you.”
He’s on autopilot, registering Sherlock’s voice, though distantly, telling him to be careful in stepping into the water. He doesn’t want to touch Sherlock for any longer than he has to, doesn’t want to give anything away, because this is a fine, fine mess he’s gotten himself into. Together, they manage to lower him into the water without too much jostling, and once submerged to the best of his ability, John groans and leans back.
Two weeks of chatting with John5NF and he still feels like he wants to learn more, still feels like he wants to tell him more. Sherlock takes a shower and brushes out Redbeard’s coat and recalibrates both of his microscopes before he deigns to pick up his mobile again. When he does, he’s rewarded with a new email from John5NF, and not one in the string that they’d been sending back and forth. Those emails remain, read, in light gray print below this one.
Sherlock sighed and hung his head, nodding even as he did. “Right. Yes.”
“Stop what?”
“He’s nearly ten years my junior; I wouldn’t even begin to know how to respond to that!” Sherlock huffs and kicks his feet up on the chair opposite.
“I like
John twists, brings himself closer to Sherlock, has to almost, or he fears he’ll lose his mind. “What else?”
John responds so quickly that Sherlock wonders if he’s waiting on Sherlock’s replies. The simple act of wondering that causes Sherlock to shiver. Is it possible that John5NF is as excited as he is to send and receive these emails? It’s so appealing to think about, it’s ridiculous to hope that John feels the same way, but…
“You know, I’m fully healed now,” John murmured eventually, deep and low, predatory.
Her voice is almost pitying when she follows up. “You know what Grindr-”
A flood of relief coursed through him when he saw the minute rise and fall of John’s chest and he slumped down in his chair with the force of it. “Oh,” Moriarty said offhandedly, noticing the movement. “We picked up your boyfriend.
They meandered over, stopping along the way to accept words of congratulations from onlookers; as he passed by John from behind, he angled his elbow just
“I!” Molly squeaks and jumps, and John too is startled at the quiet being disrupted; he straightens and takes in the entrant.
John clicks.
Sherlock blinks at her, takes in her shoes, her coat, the sweater she’s decided on. “And uhm, I’m sorry but there’s really no one else interesting,” she giggles. “Either dead or alive.”
“Why do you even carry anything but the high stuff around him,” Philip asked, but she ignored him, intent on the task at him.
“Call it planning for the future,” Mary had said with a bright smile. “Besides, afterward you and I can just go to the pub and get pissed and talk about how positively abysmal the home decor is, alright?”
…and he can’t lose any of that.
He frowned and considered Sherlock, taking a moment to glance over his face. “And deal with your strange clients and bizarre cases at all hours of the night… I have read the website you know.”
The raucous atmosphere was a detriment to his focus, and he trusted his agent to find separate, quieter accommodations away from the athletes. In Turin he’d bunked in a hotel with the journalists and other delegation members, and in Vancouver he’d managed to secure a quaint and rustic rental cabin away from the center of activity. This year’s lodgings were far less lavish, but they were private and quiet nonetheless.
“I brought bubbles,” he says, holding a champagne bottle in one hand and a bottle of bath bubbles in the other.
“Afternoon, Molly. All’s well in sub basement B?” he asks with a smile and then turns to wink at John.
“Wow.” John finished off his beer.
But John was shouting again, screaming at the top of his lungs, thrashing his bound legs and spitting like a rabid animal. Sherlock’s brow furrowed, he glanced up at Moran and knew in that moment that Moran had chosen not to take the supposed out that Sherlock had presented him with.
“I’ll be at the finish with the medics, as usual,” John said around an affectionate smile.
But why is he feeling guilt at all? The thought stops him in his tracks.
after the excitement and fervor of the Games went away. John had said he wanted to see what happened between them, all but said that they were
Sherlock’s mouth lifts in a smile, something safe and private; John can see the weight gone from him now, too, see how he leans into John’s touch, releases a heavy breath that sounds like it’s been held for ages and ages. “Now, that wasn’t so terrifying,” Sherlock claims, and shifts around so that his right knee is just against John’s left.
Sherlock stands abruptly and faces John. He straightens his spine to stand at his full height and John finds himself standing up a bit taller as well. “The press, they’re always clamoring. After the incident with
“Just?” Sherlock asks, and then presses in again, bending at the waist, catching John’s mouth in another, sloppy kiss.
“Yes, well, it was a mere matter of observation. He found himself in a pattern, and when a pattern becomes discernable to others, well…”
Wind whipped at Sherlock’s face and he glanced down at the ground, reminded of what John had texted him and noting that he was most certainly more than a meter and a half off of the ground. He laughed, then, looked up at the crisp, blue sky and released a breath, and leveled his gaze forward, back at the official who was about to present the medals.
His chuckles peter out and then he just watches as Sherlock drapes his shirt over a chair, and then gets to work on his trousers. He feels numb, entirely taken, unable to think or move as Sherlock drops his trousers and is left standing in his boxer-briefs, clothing pooled at his feet.
He really, truly despises himself in that moment, has never hated himself more.
John hummed noncommittally and walked on, and for a time neither one of them said a thing. Sherlock was content to glance at John out of his periphery, noting his shortened gait and the set of his shoulders, the utilitarian cut and style of his coat. Conventionally attractive, Sherlock supposed, with a pleasant and unassuming demeanour. There was the mystery of him too, the possibility of something harder and more dangerous; perhaps he used his sad jumpers to hide the soldier in him, the harder, rougher edges.
John tipped his head to the side in concession, but it was a rather long moment before he said, “That, that you are.”
John does his best to smile. “It would be nice to work somewhere a bit more quiet,” he adds, and the words feel oily and wrong on his lips. It’s a lie, sure, but one that may help in landing this position.
He’ll go down in history as the only man to ever medal in any skiing event for Great Britain, let alone secure the gold. It’s likely to keep him relevant for years to come, unless another skier comes along to change that. It’s an incredible feat, something he’s proud of, but to have trained his entire life to achieve just that and to then be left without the sport is difficult, even for a man like Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock took the opportunity to run his full gaze over the man beside him, from his plain brown shoes to the very tips of his gray-streaked blonde hair. A sports reporter would likely know the extent of his injuries off hand but he didn’t fit the bill of a member of the press. There was only one other option, then.
“Mmm, no, I live just upstairs you see. But you, well… live on the other side of the city? Are here on a Tuesday evening drinking coffee. Pressed shirt, bit of gel in your hair. And aftershave,
“Ah, right, sorry.” He allows the dog to do his business but stares straight ahead at nothing as he continues. “Furthermore, John’s taking the lead of the situation insinuates that there’s a reason for him to take the upper hand, no? Or, alternately, perhaps he wants to be in charge, perhaps that means that with men he—wait, no, that’s not, no.”
“These will do fine, thank you, Molly,” Sherlock says, his voice taking on a softer tone, and John watches on as Molly’s apprehension at walking in on their tense situation melts away. John has to try very hard indeed not to roll his eyes at the spectacle.
Sherlock saunters up to him, a small smile blooming into something larger, and his palms find John’s hips, pulling him gently into his arms.
John smiled down at his feet. “Shouldn’t we be strategizing about what to do about Moriarty?”
Sherlock smiled and watched as John rounded the corner before retreating to his own room.
When Sherlock again opened his eyes, it was to low lighting and very faint elevator music; glancing down at his watch he was stunned to note that he’d fallen asleep and had been out for nearly two hours; the hotel staff hadn’t bothered to wake him. With a stiff back he made his way to the front desk, and at not being able to find a living soul to help him, slinked up to his room. Perhaps the clerks were still tending to his keycard situation.
“I was thinking,” Sherlock began, his chest feeling much too small to encase his heart, in that moment.
He was lucky to have accommodations in a resort that was reportedly filled with foreign press and special park personnel. Slumping in the elevator, he stabbed at the button for five, leaning back into the corner of the rising box until the cheerful jingle of the bell announced his floor.
, his mind supplies haughtily–to Sherlock Holmes, then perhaps Sherlock doesn’t see all of himself, either.
Sherlock sighs, withering. “Self-deprecation is not attractive, or conducive to what we’re considering, currently.”
“Well,” John chuckled silently, “you’d never know.”
John shrugged sheepishly. “Okay, I… I might have read about you before yesterday,” he conceded. “A
There was a moment of silence and then Sherlock briefly explained to Lestrade what had happened. “Moriarty is planning on pinning it all on Moran; we can’t let that happen.”
“It’s all a bit petty.” Sherlock aimed for nonchalant instead of furious. “Killing me just to win gold.”
John’s eyes seemed to twinkle in amazement and Sherlock swallowed, reserving the look to replay in his mind whenever he wanted. “You were… god, I’m a broken record. You were fucking brilliant, how do you feel?” John asked, all the while smoothing Sherlock’s hair away from his face.
, he really is, but it strikes him that perhaps that isn’t the best thing to do. Not now. Not with John. “I…” he takes a breath; how do people speak about these things? “I’d rather hear it from you, about you.” It’s something he knows he should say, even though he can read John’s family history, the history of his schooling, what brand of crisps he prefers just from
“Just make sure it’s, you know, safe for humans when you’re through.”
With a last wiggle of his arse, Sherlock got into position behind the gate, hunching low on his skis and looking down the magnificently blanched mountain. His team melted into the background and all Sherlock could hear was the whipping of the wind and then three starter beeps.
He could swear—
Rolling his eyes again, he tossed the entire stack of mail back down on the table. “Fine, what else?” He crossed his arms, as though he were put out, but a faint smile lingered on his lips.
His mouth curved into another quick smile, Sherlock stood from the couch and retrieved his laptop, bringing it over for John to see. “This is much of what I discovered this morning. No concrete evidence but surely enough for us to be going on.”
The room is lovely, rustic in a modern sort of way.  There’s a large window that overlooks the back garden, a well-appointed bathroom, and a queen-sized bed. There is also, John notes, a rather opulent sleeper sofa situated on the far wall, whose presence feels like a betrayal.
Sherlock nods, “Would be wise.” Sherlock taps against John’s skin a few more times. “I’m going to,” he gestures towards the wall with his thumb.
“Yes,” John gasps, suddenly completely attentive, watching as Sherlock’s lithe body stretches taught.
Sherlock blinks, his eyes picking up stray light in the room and refracting it. Stagnant sound, a calm before the storm. “I love you,” and it’s foreign, warbled and almost swallowed up by his throat. Because it doesn’t mean I love you it means
Sherlock, for his part, decided a shower would be in order as well and after sorting himself and donning comfortable sweats, he unearthed the sample of wax he’d taken from Moriarty’s tackle box. Setting up at the table, he laid out the waxes he used, waxes that were popular amongst other athletes and the various types he’d collected over the years. There was no way to get a definitive breakdown of the substances and compare them, but he could compare texture and viscosity.
“Be good, or at the very least, not quite as bad,” John murmurs, dropping a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips before he leaves in search of a drink.
John is left sitting with his mouth agape, staring at Sherlock’s retreating figure, wondering whether to be put out or impressed that Sherlock paid not just for his meal but for the entire tab. Just as he’s sure he’s rather put out, Sherlock doubles back, walks up to the table and stares down at John.
, he was a medic for the ski team
When he returns to his bedsit, he’s a bit sore and very tired and he drops down into the small desk chair and feels relief. He’s going to sleep tonight, he knows it, and he’s grateful for it all. Compulsively, he logs into his email to find a bevy of messages from Molly.
John took a breath, which Sherlock found puzzling, before saying, “Then let’s do it again, yeah?”
Rolling his shoulders, John stepped out of his trousers and turned, securing his palms on the swell of Sherlock’s hips and grinning up at him. “Then, Sherlock Holmes, you are going to celebrate. Properly. Well, as properly as you can with a fractured foot; come to think of it, we should see about getting you booted but... You’re going to party--conservatively!-- like a gold medallist should party.” John tapped his fingers against Sherlock’s skin and moved away.
A deprecating laugh barked out of Sherlock. “Skiing with
“Because the thing is… I like you. I think I… no, I
For what, exactly?
for the machete job on this.
It was only a short ride to the hotel but Sherlock was so impatient that he stood at the back of the bus, making a short circuit in pacing the aisle. Once inside his room in the Olympic Village he immediately unpacked all of his belongings, sorting them neatly into his dresser, and set off for the Rosa Khutor downhill course. His team would be waiting; they knew he liked to get on the powder as soon as he was able, and the training runs for the men’s downhill had opened that morning.
Teeth find the muscle on Sherlock’s shoulder and clamp down, hard enough to smart, but not break the skin. Sherlock keens at it, finds the knife’s edge of pleasure-pain to be what he needs. With shaky fingers he locates the bottle of lubricant and slicks up his hand, fisting himself almost erratically to the timing of John’s thrusts.
Sherlock wanted to know every ridge, valley, and freckle.
murder.
And the world shifts.
“Well,” Molly says. “Don’t be nervous. It’s a nice feeling though too, isn’t it?” She watches Sherlock until he nods. “I know it’s, it’s… pointless to say that but you’re dapper and lovely and while you leave an awful lot to be desired in the…
There’s a ping, alerting him to a new email but John ignores it, just tries to read the chicken scratch that the doctor has scribbled. He leans back, goes to reply to the first email and ask if there’s any way that guest could provide him with the scan that is mentioned in the report. But then he sees the second email, the subject of which reads
And if this was going to be his last race, he thought in that instant--feeling a thrill of confidence roll up his spine and pound in his temples--he was bloody well going to make it count.
Sherlock took a few steps towards him. “It is what it is. I hadn’t the faintest what the room was like when I booked it; I didn’t intend to spend much time here.”
Molly is in the process of closing up for the evening when he finally arrives, traffic making him later than he’d intended. That adds to his frayed nerves, but he does his level best to mask that as he catches her attention. “Oh,” she says happily, though surprised, blowing a tuft of hair out of her eyes. “Sherlock, hi! I was just getting ready to pack up!”
Sherlock holds his gaze for a moment and then sits up straight, “Alright, I have.”
: Don’t jump to conclusions.
Sherlock’s gaze on him. “What?” he gives in, eventually glaring across the table at Sherlock.
John blinks, touched by the softness in Sherlock’s tone, in his touch. “There’s nothing wrong with my pajamas,” he whispers back.
“Sorry.” John feels the blush threatening to creep up his face and grabs his icy glass in order to stave it off.
Sherlock smiles at John, and then directs his gaze down at the bar. “Yes. That and the name amused me.”
“Not a bad time. Had a kip, woke to the news. Please.” He stood back and gestured John in with a sweep of his arm. John walked past and Sherlock ducked into the bathroom and retrieved a fluffy white robe, pulling it around himself haphazardly.
somehow, being the one to notice and cherish these things about John Watson. He wants to be the only person who knows these things about John, the only one who knows what they mean.
it reads. Not
It was Sherlock who suggested that the house be sold sooner rather than later, and that John should reoccupy his old room until the basement flat was adequately livable. “Can’t take more than a year.” And just like that, Mrs. Hudson had agreed to the changes, happy to comply with a renovation if she didn’t have to pay out of pocket for it.
“Yeah, you did. Took me years to give credit where it’s due, but…it all makes sense. You are… the best and wisest man I’ve ever known, told you that before. Still true now.” John swallows, glances to the floor, and stretches his left hand to mirror his right, on his left knee. “In the interest of getting it all out there, yeah? Because I don’t think, that after this conversation…we’re going to be the same. Please, just…”
Sherlock gapes; for a moment he feels as though time has stopped entirely. John’s nervous about meeting him. John’s wondering what it would have been like getting coffee with Sherlock. John is interested in both pieces, in both…halves? No, that sounds too trite.
John smiles at the computer and then gets up, goes about making himself some coffee and breakfast. The sun is up properly now and so he draws the curtains and looks down on the rather desolate street. Yesterday the sight might have caused him to fall further into his depression but now, with the concrete dappled by sunlight, he takes in a breath and finds it within him to realize that things may just be looking up.
The last bit he barks out as his eyes flash and his nostrils flare and John listens as the do rings out in a bit of an echo in the cavernous room.
Molly stops halfway down the pavement and grabs his arm. He too halts, turns to face her. “Sherlock, you’re really brilliant and very good looking and well off and a catch, I think, but just…”
before a race because-”
Sherlock glares, but can’t sustain it and then he blushes furiously, shakes his head seemingly at himself, rousing himself from his momentary bout of insecurity and says, with a gust of a breath,  “Right here.”
He was able to carry his body across the expanse of marbled floor, and collapsed on a garishly-patterned sofa, his bones very nearly sighing in relief as he did. Sherlock closed his eyes and waited, listening as other patrons entered the hotel, though they didn’t stay to linger in the opulent (but rather needlessly expansive) lobby. He didn’t consider for a moment that someone of import might see him because he was too busy attempting to keep his eyes from remaining closed when his lids would falter and droop.
a voice rings out clearly in his head. He ignores it, resolutely.
It’s a testament to how out of his element he is that he doesn’t bother fighting it.
“Then how did you know about me, all of that?”
It’s only an hour before Sherlock bounds in the door, snowflakes in his hair. “Ah, John.”
Sherlock felt as though he were on autopilot, flying around the first of the tight right turns with what he swore was more speed than he’d managed in any of his other runs.
“So glad I found this, found you,” and he captured Sherlock’s mouth again, moaning into it as Sherlock managed to wrap his fingers around John’s cock and began to stroke. They moved in tandem for a few moments, finding a rhythm of sorts until John tipped his pelvis down and back and his head lolled on his shoulders. “You, you first,” he said and peeled Sherlock’s fingers away, lacing them with his own in a tight, hot,
“John,”  Sherlock had said, derision so thick it was nearly visible in the air between them. “You tend to gravitate towards descriptors like rustic and sweet and we’re likely to end up in a barn. The idea of you picking a room for us is actually quite anxiety-producing.”
Sherlock picked through the kitchen and living area, but found nothing of interest. The rooms were nearly spartan in their neatness and Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder who’d imposed that rule. John appeared a moment later from around back where Sherlock assumed the bedrooms were and gave him a short nod.
“Oh, you know, anytime I have them in.” She smiles. “Not those, specifically, but when I have something interesting in I-I call you!”
“Yes, well, I-”
but I suppose yes, when you say it like that, it is rather a strange resume,” John chuckled and finished off his own glass, taking it upon himself to measure them out each a refill. “And with that, I need to use the loo.”
“I’m shit at talking to people, too,” he provides, leaving the sentence hanging, saying nothing more in the hopes that Sherlock will pick up on the thread of conversation. When his cool blue eyes flash back to meet John’s gaze, he feels momentarily as though someone has shoved him quite hard in the sternum.
Sherlock smiled at him and knocked a knee against John’s and John pressed back, warmth seeping through Sherlock’s trousers and suffusing his entire frame; it was lovely. “Believe me when I say I’d much rather be in a situation where I could readily give you one-hundred percent of my attention.”
“Bit of a,” his right hand curls into a fist, uncurls just as quickly. “Lie in. With me.”
“The camber on those is super thin, so pay attention to how they react on the hairpin turns,” Phil called, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, pulling his goggles down firmly over his face.
of meeting him. His ego reminds him how intelligent he is, how intuitive, how handsome, and it bolsters his intent, makes him hit ‘Reply’.
Moran disappeared into the bedroom and John sighed loudly. “Ideas, anything at all?” His shoulder bumped hard into Sherlock’s and Sherlock rolled an inch or two away. He felt the absence of heat immediately and wished desperately that there wasn’t any space between them. If they were going to go down like this, Sherlock wanted to at least be tethered to the one person he--
One-tenth of a second.
Sherlock’s eyes glass over, just a bit. He’s caught off guard. “Really?”
“John-”
“Don’t like being hurt, Sherlock,” John responds, but Sherlock’s words, his voice, have kicked up a fit of butterflies in his stomach. Sherlock is protective of John, always, but John’s never seen him this obviously upset. John doesn’t know what to do, or to say, so in his classical stiff-upper-lip form, he deflects. “Hazard of the job.”
“Nah, s’fine. I don’t mind. Worse situations that this in Kandahar.” With that, John rounded the bed towards his suitcase. “Have a shower, get some sleep, you’ll get things sorted in the morning.”
Sherlock gets the distinct impression that he’s being teased; it’s such a novel feeling that he pauses to catalogue it. It’s not like the teasing he received from the boys in primary school, but rather good-natured. Something that friends do to one another.
draft. Frustrated, he quickly googles whether or not he can retrieve a sent mail and to his dismay, finds that it’s impossible. He then checks that the email was at least sent from the Guest account and not his general one and is relieved to see that it was.
that the universe rights itself, and it all balances out. They breathe, side by side, elated, free, finally devoid of the tethers of their collective past.
And like that, Sally is all but forgotten; they fall in step next to one another as they cross the threshold into Lestrade’s office. “Can’t believe you’re asking for actual case files,” is his way of greeting, as he chews the last of his mid-morning donut.
Sherlock groaned, “Go away.”
“Well, I’m… not. I’ve met far worse.” John settles for saying, purses his lips and leans back, perfectly at ease. “That is something, though. With the deductions. Extraordinary.”
“Come boy,” he calls and the dogs gets up with little difficulty, trotting over and taking his place at Sherlock’s side as they leave the park. Sherlock can’t help allowing his mind to linger on that last image, the slightly rotund man with the easy smile; he isn’t attracted to the build or the face he’s dreamed up, not in the slightest. Surely that wouldn’t even be a thought that occured if he wasn’t think of this as something else entirely.
Sherlock blinks, the light from the candle shading his face in greys. There’s something there and they wait, suspended in time. Then John feels Sherlock’s calf settle against his beneath the table; it’s the easiest thing in the world to reach across the table and place his palm over Sherlock’s hand and it seems to prompt the ensuing confession out of him. “I want you, John. In every conceivable meaning of the word. You understand that, don’t you?”
He crossed the finish line, swerving to a stop, even as he held up his hands. His heart was hammering in his ears; he felt positively on fire. Sherlock knew he’d done much better than his other run; it had been much smoother and it had
Sherlock taps his mobile to his mouth while he thinks of what he wants to say; how he can possibly properly convey what he’s striving to?
Eventually, John puts his menu down and folds his hands atop the table, the perforated surface leaving little diamonds embellished into his skin. Sherlock looks at those, too. John’s hands, the blunt fingers and the neatly-trimmed nails, the way his knuckles press into one another. Then John’s wholly unremarkable wrists; Sherlock’s eyes travel up the length of gingham shirt, linger on John’s shoulders–strong, wide, but not garishly so–the curve of his neck, the tiniest bit of stubble coloring his jaw.
“Huh?” John misses the heat of Sherlock’s finger instantly.
John hunkers down on the sofa, snatching the photos from Sherlock’s hand. They’re bound together by twine, each individually wrapped, a post-it note denoting the more obvious details of the case. Sherlock must have meant to file them, but as his life–their life–unraveled, he must have forgotten. Some are proper police photos and others are from Sherlock’s phone, or from John’s small, efficient digital camera. Most are gory, some are artful and others are just plain confusing.
John’s eyes narrow just a bit, playful with a flicker of danger. “Yeah?”
“Naw,” John said, bouncing up onto the balls of his feet. “I was just flirting with you.” His right hand weaved its way into Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock dipped, kissing John lightly before John pulled away to brush their noses together.
Sherlock took photos of the pertinent pages and the canisters of wax with his mobile and then set off to find John. It had been quiet for some time, and John couldn’t have gotten far. He was just about to close the case back up when his mobile buzzed.
Sherlock considers that for a moment, sliding the safety goggles up onto his head, causing his fringe to point out wildly. For the number of expressions John has seen cross Sherlock’s expressive face, this one is most seldom seen: confusion.
“Boyfriend, then?” It’s going out on a limb, it’s fishing and he knows it, but there’s no taking it back now. He’s fishing because he’s interested–who wouldn’t be interested in someone who looks and sounds like
He joined John, shouting at the top of his lungs once again, voice breaking with the force of it as he felt hope slip away. Moran bent over, grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders and was about to bring a fist down against the side of his face when there was a rattling at the door. Everyone froze for a split second and then simultaneously John and Sherlock began screaming and thrashing.
Moran grinned and pulled his hands from his own pockets, cracking the knuckles audibly. It was a paltry intimidation tactic and Sherlock relayed as much, his eyes going glassy and bored. “I’m so sorry that attempting to prove attempted murder is so
“Hmm?” he hums a moment later, pulled from his thoughts by Sherlock calling his name, firmly.
Sherlock finally put his experiment down, plucking his safety goggles primly away from his eyes and settling them on his head. “So, they’ll miss you for a few days. Surely you’re coaching has stuck enough to carry them through for at least a week. And they’ll have the rest of the staff. Come with me.”
When he peeled his eyes back open, it was to the sight of the commission members staring down at him--at
She moved along, producing his cap, and then goggles that were strapped around his head, perched on his brow.
Sherlock barked out a laugh, nodded in agreement and tugged John down onto the bed, causing him to sprawl out awkwardly onto his stomach. Twisting, Sherlock lay out on the bed, head resting on his hand. “Today, I am sorry… that you had to deal with that. I want you to know, truly.”
“Okay,” John said on a breath, settling his hands palms-down on his knees. “I’ve something to tell you, as well. You’re uhm, you might think I’m crazy but just…”
He begins his response a few times before he settles on short, sweet and honest.
and he supposes he’s a little starved for it.
He knows Mary. He knows Mary now like he’d known Sherlock. For a while, he’d thought that knowing her would mean losing a part of Sherlock and he’d not wanted to do that. Not a bit. But over time, he’d learned to think about Sherlock less and less, put him to the back of his mind instead of the forefront. But sometimes he crops up, makes his presence so undeniably known that John almost resents Mary for her presence.
Once inside, Sherlock shakes the water from his coat–wool does tend to absorb moisture in the most disgusting of ways–and catches John eyeing him up as he does so. It shouldn’t thrill him, knowing that John likes him, but it truly does. He takes a moment to fluff his hair back up as well, noting that John’s eyes do not leave his face.
Sherlock takes his time, dragging the flat of his tongue along the underside of John’s cock, pausing to trace the head, before lapping over the wetness at the tip, the sound loud in the hush of the room. It’s a slow tease, the way Sherlock works him so eagerly before pulling away to gauge John’s reactions.
Though it’s generally Sherlock who spends too much time in the loo, whether it’s fussing with his hair or his rather thorough and intricate flossing routine, John’s entitled to a little time, too. He’ll make a very staunch case for it, if he has to.
They were in hospital for what seemed like eons. The competence of the doctors on staff was certainly much higher than what they would encounter if the world’s elite athletes had not overrun the city, but Sherlock was miffed at the quality of treatment all the same. Since he was the athlete, the doctors swarmed over him first upon their arrival at the A&E, but he was very adamant in his demands that John be treated first.
Sherlock’s reputation, his career at this point, couldn’t sustain the intense scrutiny the world would place on him if he were to be incorrect about his accusations. No, Moriarty would have to be caught in the act, caught doing… whatever it was that he was doing to his equipment. Sherlock would need airtight evidence of dishonesty.
Just as he’s about to make it to the restaurant, he’s spotted by a group of Norwegian fans. He stops to sign their various Olympics paraphernalia, even going so far as to remove his sunglasses for a group photo. He says nothing snarky or inconsiderate, and leaves them, feeling a bit lighter after being pulled from his thoughts.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says very quietly, and the soft, unguarded tone causes John to open his eyes.
Molly pulled her grin into a small, pursed smile. “Right, yeah. John’s your friend, I think that’s fantastic, for what it’s worth. And by the way? I’m your friend too, that’s why when you say all of those awful things, I don’t slap you.”
John shakes his empty hands at his sides, bringing himself back under control. “Just because I want to get you naked doesn’t mean that I want us to just... “
. “Right, okay,” John forges on, clearing his throat, “Second best case, then.”
It was a long, tense minute before he heard a slight snick and John’s relieved sigh.
matter, but he finds himself saying “yes” anyway.
With the help of Greg, Sherlock scheduled his sit-down interview with NBC and Bob Costas and one with Sue Barker and Mike Baker from the BBC. He was approached and interviewed quickly by several journalists for print pieces. ESPN cornered him about getting soundbites for a piece they were doing for a documentary series on Olympians and then he was being whisked away by a course official, towards the podium area.
He doesn’t bother with the Tube; it’s an impossibly nice day and Sherlock finds himself buoyed by John’s description of the city in Spring. And so, with hands in his pockets he begins the three mile trek across London, stopping briefly along the way to speak with his contacts here and there. It takes him two hours and seventy-five quid parsed out amongst his network, but he feels refreshed, not at all annoyed when he’s actually stopped at the reception desk and asked for identification.
“Press’ll be everywhere,” John said, squeezing Sherlock’s wrists. “You going to be okay with that?”
Sherlock turned out to have several bruised ribs, a fractured foot and was bruised liberally elsewhere, but somehow, miraculously, he was relatively unscathed considering how much pain he’d been in hours earlier. He’d be sore in the morning--and likely for a long while after--but his athleticism and health had worked in his favor.
A shadow passed over Moran’s face and Sherlock immediately seized on it, honed in on the exposed weakness. “He doesn’t love you. He doesn’t feel for you what you feel for him, Sebastian. You’re just another cog in his machine. Look at what he gives you, he leaves you to clean up after him. How could he love you, how could he
Sherlock kept a keen watch, attention divided between his mobile and his surroundings; he did nothing to hurry John along, just waited and trusted that he’d manage to pick the lock. He spared a quick glance to watch John work, his hands nimble and capable in working with the small instruments; distantly, the memory of John’s hands on him threatened to manifest in his mind and Sherlock did his best to push it away.
“I… I’d suspected, but I hadn’t dared hope. After our initial——” Sherlock huffs, frustrated with himself. “I told you I was married to my work, and…afterward, when I realized that you meant a great deal to me, I didn’t dare hope, it would have been…too difficult.”
“Sorensen has had an absolutely abysmal year and judging by the first two turns, he’s not looking to change that here in Pyeongchang,” and “That won’t get him through to qualifying, but then, he likely knew he wouldn’t be able to compete on this stage.”
Sherlock remains where he’s standing, hands at his sides, at a loss for what to do. “Is Doctor Watson around?” he finally asks, not entirely sure why he’s so eager to find the answer to that question. God, he’s being battered about by desires he’s so unaccustomed to; it’s unsettling.
John hears keys in the door and then the front door to the house swinging open and hitting the wall. Mary must be carrying something; she’s always clumsy coming through the door if she has something in her hands.
“If Moriarty wanted me gone, one would think he wouldn’t have waited until
Sherlock’s eyes narrow delightfully. “What constitutes best?”
Sherlock knows that John has been making the most of his time in South Korea, spending the past two evenings over at the biathlon course.
Sherlock smiles. “As though I’d ever.”
. John, who he was
He left his detritus on the table and made his way back towards his hotel, enjoying the warmer-than-usual evening air. Considering for a moment whether the conditions would affect the mountains, he looked up to realize he was in front of the Olympic torch, and allowed his gaze to linger on the empty cauldron.
He could be pleasantly surprised.
, Sherlock mentally rebukes himself. He needs to stop imagining such absolutely trite things. He clears his throat. “Yes, it’s quite good. Their spicy tuna roll is unparalleled.”
“You hate quaint.”
He rolled his head on his shoulders, huffed out the last of his irritation, slung his towel around his neck and made his way to the elliptical, notching the incline up and settled in, leaning over the machine and allowing the mechanical swishing noise to wash over him and drown out his thoughts. Sherlock focused forward at a television that was covering snowboarding preliminaries, and worked himself until his legs protested; glancing down at the readings, he was happy to note that he’d gone five miles without even realizing it. Sometimes, he found his workouts tedious in their repetitive nature, but being able to zone out was helpful.

, for so long.
They watched as Molly did an exaggerated shimmy and hooked two fingers into Greg’s trousers. She went up on tiptoe, whispered something in his ear and he doubled over in laughter. He lifted his head and waved at them, “Get the fuck over here!”
Looking down at his neatly-folded clothes, he realized he had nothing clean to wear. The trousers were stiff and unpleasant from having been worn for such a long duration, and his shirt was regrettably beginning to smell a bit ripe. He picked his pants out of the pile and wondered if he could get away with wearing so little while he slept next to someone who, though compelling, was still very nearly a stranger.
“Yes, I-”
It’s very nearly pouring by the time they reach New Scotland Yard, and they dash from the taxi to the revolving doors, avoiding puddles when they can.
Sherlock swallows, glances into the depths of his room before glancing back. “Bed?”
John can’t help it; he immediately imagines a woman or man with the head of a dog in their lap, petting at it as they send John these emails. It brings him an odd swell of joy that rolls from his gut to his chest, and he allows himself to lean back against the hard bench and daydream a bit.
John wet his bottom lip with the tip of his tongue before sliding it back quickly into his mouth; he took a step back, bracketed his hands on his hips and then, thinking better of it, dropped his hands down at his sides in fists. “That was…”
Molly chuckled beside him, “They’re an extension of you, they do what you make them do; hardly inanimate.”
Sherlock cursed aloud; if he’d been in his own room he would have made certain that he was up by six o’clock at the very latest. He knew he couldn’t blame John for having let him sleep in; his body had needed it, that was true enough. Honestly, Sherlock hadn’t felt this well-rested in quite some time, the extra four hours having rejuvenated him. Still, he had to get many things done if he was going to meet his goals for the day, and so he gathered the tray and brought it to the table by the bed, phoned the front desk and finally, mercifully, was able to talk to someone about getting into his room.
“What was your drug of choice than Sherlock?”
“Because I’m an addict John. I had lost my drug of choice, so I was forced to use the next best thing.”
“I know.”
“Yes” John said.
John stood looking down at his closed suitcase. Most the rage he felt about Sherlock had now gone and was being replaced with disappointment. John didn’t want to leave Sherlock. But Sherlock's drug use had become far too much for him to cope with. He couldn’t see Sherlock like that again. John looked up at Sherlock his eyes where no longer blood shot as they were the night before when John had found him draped across the floor, a weak pulse and a needle on the table across the room. John studied Sherlock's expression; eyes sunken and blank, skin pale as if he would be sick. As much anger as John had felt, seeing Sherlock like this was unbearable.
“Sherlock”
“It means I am addicted to you John. Everything about you”
“You told me you had no use for drugs anymore.”
John glared back at him for a moment, his eyes were burning with anger, before stomping off to his room coming back with an arm full of clothing and throwing it in his suitcase. What did Sherlock expect from John? Other than confusion. Art had always confused Sherlock anyway. He always looked to deeply for the meaning behind it; and eventually missing it entirely. Sherlock was still trapped in his head; Its deafening silence was too much for Sherlock to escape.
Johns heart was pounding in his chest. He knew the answer he wanted but he was unsure if he would get it, but this was his only chance to ask.
Sherlock raised his head just enough to make eye contact with John. “I am ignoring that fact as well.”
John didn’t say anything, he just stared at Sherlock letting the silence hang between them for a long while before walking over to him. John looked down at Sherlock  who was looking back up at him, more confused than John had ever seen him, before moving his own face in closer. John looked straight into Sherlock's eyes. He could almost hear Sherlock's heart beating furiously in his chest.
“You’re ignoring all of your problems.” The accusation cut through the emptiness of Sherlock's mind with its malice tone.
“John…I would ask you if you felt about me the way I feel about you”
John was amazed to have gotten the answer he so desperately wanted. Still wanted to hear Sherlock say it properly, without comparing him to drugs.
His body instinctively lifted his cup of tea to his mouth. It’s cold. Sherlock sat with that thought for a moment; a weight fell in his stomach as he realised how much time must have passed. He looked over at Johns suitcase and saw how much progress John had made in Sherlock's absence. The floor creaked as John re entered the room with a small amount of clothing. That’s the last of it Sherlock thought, hoping he might be wrong. Hoping he would have just a little more time to work out what to say to John that would make him stay. John placed the few folded sweaters into his suitcase, pushing down on them to make it easier to close.
As Sherlock sat in his wing-back chair drinking his piping hot tea with a glazed over expression, John was pulling out his suitcase and yelling to himself. Sherlock didn’t know what exactly John was saying, he could only hear the screaming emptiness of his own mind. He didn’t understand how his mind could betray him at such a crucial moment as this. It’s what he had relied on his whole life and now at the most important moment it abandons him; Leaving him sat helplessly in the corner, drinking tea while John was in the process of leaving him.
Sherlock never thought John looked nice. John was art and the purpose of art isn’t to look nice; It’s to make you feel something. John is the only person to make Sherlock feel something and he was about to lose him.
