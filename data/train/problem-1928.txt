Rosie only gave a nod and fisted his shirt. John then realized that he forgot to take her stuffed animal (a bee, Sherlock absolutely loved it) along when he brought her to kindergarten this morning; because he had been in a hurry; because he had spent too much time being upset about Sherlock’s absence. Great. Incapable of parenting, thank you very much.
Sherlock straightened (having bend down to set a very eager Rosie on the floor) and locked John in one of his intense glares. Analysing. Collecting. Almost deducing, but softening before the intensity became overwhelming. It tended to be - being the sole centre of Sherlock’s attention was a burning sensation - and John couldn’t help but feel slightly uncomfortable under it at times. Not that he wanted to hide, but Sherlock saw
Sherlock Holmes had been called an asshole countless times in his life- but for the first time since he could remember, he actually felt the consequences of his poor treatment of others.
smell and listened to the steady heartbeat right underneath the skin. He inhaled and concentrated very hard to stop time. It would be fucking fantastic to call in sick to spend the whole day with Sherlock. But… he was a doctor and a father. A man of principles, a man of morals, a shining example for the younger generation. And a man who was about to get in serious trouble with his boss / ex-girlfriend for being late
Sherlock, lost in kind gestures or not, was still more observant than the average human being. So, naturally, he didn’t miss the implication of John’s last statement. And he didn’t hesitate to voice his disapproval.
Sherlock squeezed his friend’s shoulders a little tighter. He didn’t know what else to do. John drew in a shaky breath that sounded a little too close to a sob.
There’s no camera installed at the front of the car, so John feels a little more at ease. “I guess I’m working through some stuff right now.”
The politician gave him a playful grin, which made him look much younger and much happier than John had ever seen the so-called
Small, anguish whimpers reached his ears. He clung onto the cup in an effort to keep himself from going upstairs. He wasn’t sure John would appreciate it. So, he sat. And stood. And played the violin. And tried to ignore the pained noises coming from upstairs.
Sherlock’s lips quirk into a lopsided smile. John sort of wants to slap him (or kiss him… maybe both, in that order). “Not my division.”
When he found the inseparable pair, the sight before him made him forget about mopping for some seconds. The lake was gorgeous; rich blue water, as clear as a crystal, with a small beach-like area surrounding it. There was a small breeze there, that mingled the earthy smell of pine trees with the rich aroma of natural water.
, but he had known right from the beginning that The Work was and would always be Sherlock’s top priority. It hurt him, maybe a little bit, but he promised Sherlock (on that one day where the lanky detective had kissed him for the first time) that he wouldn’t need to change for their relationship. So, he didn’t.
His heart made a little happy jump when the detective nuzzled his hair lovingly and whispered softly near his ear: “Tell you what; once we get home, we’ll order some takeaway from the Thai place you like so much, watch some of the crap telly you’re ridiculously fond of …. and later, once I tucked Rosie in –“ his voice dropped an octave- “I’ll take you to bed”
“Cute!”, Jonathan pipes from the backseat, despite the fact that he hardly has enough information to make this judgement; but that’s not the point. Jonathan has the gift of finding something cute in everything.
The next time he woke up, his brain decided to join him. He opened his eyes slowly and pressed them shut again when warm mid-day sun hit his still-blurry vision. Shielding his eyes from the invading nuisance that was daylight, he outstretched an arm to examine the other side of the bed. After a mild panic of finding it empty, his memory slowly reminded him that John had the early shift today, which means he would be home by noon… or more precisely in twenty minutes. If John would come home, that is. The detective stopped, blinked in surprise, and re-visited the thought. Where had
They passed Donovan and Anderson, and John could pinpoint the exact moment that Donovan suddenly realized that maybe, maybe the freak wasn’t so bad, after all. Maybe, just maybe him and his doctor found their happiness in the unusual and twisted lifestyle they were living. Maybe, just maybe the child was lucky to have not one, but two adults who looked after her lovingly. It was the moment when Anderson opened his mouth and was shut up quite rudely by the female officer’s sneer: “Give ‘em a rest”.
‘God damn it, Watson! You chase down London’s murderers, but break apart over a fucking tempter tantrum?!’ Yes, apparently.
Without another word, he hurried up the stairs to the nursery. Curiously and still a bit wobbly-legged, John followed some steps behind. His heart made an almost painful jump as he watched Sherlock bend over his daughter – their daughter – to give her silent smooch on the forehead. The little girl smiled in her sleep, but didn’t stir or wake. Sherlock turned to John standing in the doorframe, with a beaming smile, lighting up his whole face. John couldn’t help but return it, before he took the detective’s hand gently in his, to lead him downstairs to their shared bedroom.
During the first week of their new arrangement, Sherlock had refused to take cases. He wanted to make sure John was alright at any given moment, and it had taken a whole lot convincing on John’s part that keeping watch on him all the time really wasn’t necessary. Although Sherlock’s devotion made the special feeling in his gut tingle pleasantly, John wasn’t entirely comfortable with being over-cared like that. It was hard to admit it to himself the few times he really did need Sherlock, so naturally all the other instances made him deeply embarrassed. He was a grown man, dammit.
The Holmes brothers, as it turned out, had never been camping in their posh life and it showed. They were spectacularly useless when it came to putting up tents, so much so that even gentle-soul-John-Watson
Surely, his genius brain would understand that this situation was completely different than... and would very kindly tell his hands to stop shaking, if that's not too much to ask for? He drew a shallow breath and observed a small punch of nausea hitting him in the guts. He closed his eyes and tried to block the sounds of a screaming child out, for they somehow made him sick. He mentally rolled his eyes about his own asininity. Sherlock Holmes would not let himself be influenced by repressed feelings attached to a long-forgotten memory of the worst moments of his childhood- he would NOT!
But Sherlock was… complicated like that. It would do nothing good to punish him for his shite behavior. John was pretty sure, Sherlock would punish himself enough with a bad consciousness when he woke up from his intoxicated state. He took pride in the fact that he was the only person who could evoke a bad consciousness in Sherlock Holmes. Now, though, he wasn’t so sure if that really should be something you’re taking pride in.
He doesn’t, if the experiences of the past evening were anything to go by. While his heart constricted painfully at the memory of John not only dodging his kiss, but also flirting with this stupidly gorgeous woman, Sherlock couldn’t help to remember the end of his first ever relationship. She was a young professor- charming intellect, casual beauty- and she admired him. Until she got to know him.                                                                                                                                         “It’s difficult to like you, once one gets to know who you are” she had said. After he had seen her. With someone else. He didn’t feel possessive of her, for he didn’t grasp the desire to be associated with another human being in that way. The hurt he had felt puzzled him.
Sherlock's level of annoyance increased the longer his brain simply didn't let the topic of yesterday's weakness go. He let out another groan, louder this time, and slapped his face into the pillow to sulk for a bit. It had been a disaster. Sherlock snorted disdainfully when he pictured what a sight he most likely had been. All redundant body fluids and shaking limps and vulnerable noises. Like a child seeking comfort from his mother. (or in this case from his John).
It was the soft baritone rumble that did it; this damn velvet voice breaking him every time; no matter if it was throwing deductions all over the place or whispering profanities in the bedroom. Without a word, John locked his partner in a bone-crushing hug; circling the thin, elegantly clad waist in a strong hold and buring his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock made a small surprised sound at the sudden display of affection (after all, John was the one constantly worrying about the things people might talk about, even after they confirmed the rumours about their relationship), but gained his composure back and returned the sentiment eagerly (after all, he couldn’t care less; people always talked, they did little else).
He didn’t think for a moment, he just felt; he felt and allowed himself to be happy, and to hope, and to be daring. He’d blame it on the adrenalin, if necessary. But actually, he just wanted to, and he was gone on the post-case bliss; way too gone to deny himself such an innocent wish.
He inhaled the familiar smell of his partner, calming his racing heart. He did nothing but breathe on John for at least two minutes, while John instinctively ran a soothing hand through the black curls on the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
When Sherlock had come back from the dead, John loathed him. He loathed every little second of this nightmare Sherlock had put him through without having the decency of at least giving him a small hint that there was still hope. No, he left John to suffer through depression and a sheer endless quest to find meaning in his once again meaningless life; only to turn up one day, just as John thought he had his life back together. 'You're planning to get married? Too bad, I'm back, John, make me some tea! Life? What life? I've been away!' (Of course, he didn't propose to Mary that night. Of course, she left him not two months after Sherlock's 'miracle'. Of course, even she understood that John Watson's life revolved around Sherlock bloody Holmes. What life? That damn bastard).
That they didn’t talk complicated matters. Sherlock wasn’t sure where they stood anymore. John remained the greatest mystery he’s never going to solve. John and all his complex emotions, emotions he never shared, emotions that kept the detective guessing, and worrying, and
John sucked in a sharp breath upon hearing that familiar tone that filled him with calm instantly. He felt the warmth of Sherlock inching closer to him, felt the detective’s kneecaps -he was now kneeling in front of him, dirtying his posh trousers with grass stains- bump against his shoes. He shouldn’t need this. But right now, he didn’t
“You’re sleeping tonight” John informed him, conversely, while he started to rub small circles over the detective’s tense shoulder blades. The touch sent tingly waves all through Sherlock’s body.
"He is your brother" A pause. (Sherlock considered bluntly storming into the room to prevent this treason)
John scratches his neck. “I guess….” He trails off, remembering the last time they had guests over at 221B. It’s only been some years- the first and only Christmas party at 221B- but it feels like forever ago. He’s grown old, since then. In a sense, they both have (though it suits Sherlock better).
Lestrade had told him countless times. John had told him countless times plus ten. Sherlock apologized half-heartedly every single time and promised to be more careful next time. He never was.
Sherlock sniffed, once again overcome by a strong wave of emotion. “I promise I won’t run off carelessly again” he spluttered hurriedly. John nodded enthusiastically, without a doubt of the sincerity. Had anyone told him that his day would end up with two arms full of consulting detective, both sniffling and giggling like fucking idiots because they finally managed to confess their love for each other, he’d probably flipped them off. Yet, here they were- a mess of emotions and tears and kisses.
properly, because John entered his mind no matter how rational he tried to tackle this situation. And John was late- it was already one in the afternoon- and what John just didn’t come back this time, what if John just left- God, he couldn’t possibly go on if that was the case and- John was never late and- no, it couldn’t end, not this time, he had tried to be good, he really did, but of course he wasn’t enough for he was always “just not enough”- but John was good, the best damn thing- and
Within another second, he pulled the ceramic mug out of the detective's hand and threw it forcefully against a wall. It shattered in a dozen pieces and coated the floor with awful brown goo. Well, that was quicker than anticipated.
And here he stops himself, doesn’t allow the automatic response to roll off his tongue. Instead, he finishes with “pining” which sounds lame and unconvincing even to his own ears.
“Sherlock?” John queried, getting nervous. “Is everything okay?” he searched his partners face for any clues. “Who did you piss off today?”
Dramatically, Sherlock buried is face in the pillow which smelled like John again. Technically, it wasn’t much of a deal. He wouldn’t even have to talk, really. Still, Sherlock wouldn’t be a genius if he didn’t sense that yesterday’s events would play into the whole endeavor of this visit. John would probably want to talk about it. How tedious. How deeply mortifying.
After all, what is the harm in people assuming that he was gay? Bi? In any way sexually attracted to men?
“Go on then, it has chocolate filling. Not that I approve of your unhealthy eating habits or anything, but I figured after yesterday…. It’s a peace offering”
The loud sound of Mrs. Hudson’s grandfather’s clock startled the doctor out of his post-Sherlock-kissed-me-daze (He decided later on, that he would arrange his personal time-line with the measurement of ‘pre-Sherlock’s-kiss’ and ‘post-Sherlock’s-kiss’ in order to commemorate this life changing moment).  He then realized that he had been standing there doing nothing but staring like a fucking idiot for at least five minutes and that he was precisely two minutes away from having to hurry. Sherlock seemed to be aware of the time too, because he muttered in a low rumble: “You’re going to be late” No, he
John was patient with Sherlock’s struggles with coping with sentiment. It was fine, most of the time, really. He enjoyed watching him learn. He could ignore a harsh word or two, spoken without thinking about the emotional consequences. But not today. John felt like the air was forcefully knocked out of his lungs.
John sighed, still smoothing over his friend’s arm. “I’m not having a crisis, Sherlock. I’m pretty damn sure about this” (‘But I’m still not sure about you’ he added in his mind) “But... listen, let’s talk at home. I’m just finishing my last pint. You can wait here or go ahead”
“Perhaps” the older Holmes cleared his throat, a clear sign that he was nervous. Never thought John he’d see the day where the British Government was nervous.
Lestrade had talked to the little girl in his calm inspector voice, coaxing her into taking his hand. She didn't put much of a fight, but there was a certain dullness in her eyes. She smiled at the nice inspector, but didn't say a word. Her smile didn't make it to her dead eyes, and Sherlock felt sweat run down his back (Why was it too hot in here? The heat was making one nauseous!).
The flock moves from Rosie to Sherlock, a tumble of compliments and exclamations of excitement. Karamo tries to engage Sherlock in one of this patented “So tell me about your friend”- conversations, but Sherlock dodges it smoothly. Instead, he holds John’s gaze steadily and quirks his lips into the shadow of a smirk, which never fails to make John a teeny-tiny bit flustered (it’s just that he’s never seen Sherlock look at anyone else that way before. It’s something special and uniquely them. That shouldn’t make him flustered, though, but he can’t help himself). John pretends to be unaffected and feeds some more oatmeal to Rosie. Kitchen Guy is the only one not fussing over Sherlock and fixes him with a slightly surprised look that slowly morphs into a grin.
'He looks at you like there’s no one else in the room,' John’s flush returns with a vengeance when he remembers Antoni’s words.
Sure enough, the Holmes brother in question appeared in the doorway, billowing coat and all even if it was June, looking entirely too expensive to go on a camping trip. He also carried no bag, which was presumably just the snobbish high-class attitude that brought John in such a state of mild annoyance.
Sherlock blew a raspberry in Mycroft’s general direction, before he focused all his attention on Rosie again.
Instantly, he turned, and found the right side of the bed empty. John had left. Surgery? Unlikely, on a Saturday. Ashamed? Most certainly. Reason? Probably regret. John seemed to value his masculinity. Elaborate. Sleeping with close bodily contact to one's male companion was something considered out of the realm of manliness, at least for the vast majority of heterosexual males between 35 and 45. Not that Sherlock himself cared very much about society’s norms and labels, but he knew of John's utter fondness of them. So, a regretful emotion inducing his early departure from the bed was a very probable scenario.
The detective stopped sulking for a second when his thoughts wandered to the determining variable in yesterday’s disaster.
anything. The discomfort caused by this thought must have shown in his face, for John’s easy smile turned into a small frown.
now? The thought sent him in such an irrational frenzy, that he buried his face against the pillow and had to make some breathing exercises before he calmed down. Just transport? Sociopath? Hell, he couldn’t even fool himself with this crap these days.
Sherlock, was still draped against the wooden frame; all long limps and dressing gown and arcades of pale skin. He gave John a soft smile, with a rare twinkle of genuine happiness in his stormy eyes. John was 0.2 seconds away from blowing the whole plan, but Rosie solved his moral conflict by demanding (leaving zero room for arguments) for her ‘Lock to help her with the construction of a lego drawbridge. Sherlock sighed fondly, and flashed John one last grin, before the door to their flat closed.
John rushed to the kindergarten as soon as his early shift had ended, and cursed himself mentally for thinking they could have a quiet family day. They all longed for one, the last week had been cramped with cases and surgery shifts. Of course, John was disappointed that Sherlock wasn’t there,
“But today was unnecessary” the younger man countered. “I just… wanted to have you around.” He cleared his throat, slightly embarrassed. “Pat my ego with your praise. To gain your… approval again.”
They had never talked about this. And now they were well on their way and horribly unprepared. Sherlock swallowed a lump down in his throat. This was the moment he should show courage, he should start protecting John, start to make use of his promise. If only, it wouldn’t be so damn hard. Suddenly, John wasn’t the only vulnerable one on the bed. “John I-“
Sherlock shook his head vigorously, but kept his face pushed against the soft patch of skin peeking out from the doctor’s collar.
Rosie’s delighted giggles seeped through the house, surrounding them quietly. John sighed. “I meant sorry for showing up at a crime scene without being any help whatsoever”
“It’s been a while, though, hasn’t it?” Kitchen Guy asks with a sympathetic puppy dog expression which makes him look like a sad supermodel.
There was a silence among the listeners, because each single one of them was reminded what a strong, exceptional, kind, and simply incredible human being was telling them with an unbelievable tranquillity about not loosing your humanity under inhuman circumstances.
Mycroft paused, not even registering the enthusiastic approval of their little captain. Sherlock held his gaze shortly, before he looked away.
John never once allowed himself to dream that Sherlock wanted to adopt Rosie. That they could be her parents, thoughtfully and unconditionally. His heart leaped in his throat, and he might have started to cry a little bit. Sherlock caressed his slightly trembling shoulders soothingly.
Now, he was having a really bad day and Sherlock asked for his help. He hadn’t come along on many cases since he moved back in, mainly because of all the emotional obstacles in their way. This was the first time Sherlock openly asked him to come along, openly admitted that he needed it. It felt good, perhaps a bit too good, to be needed by Sherlock again. And the younger man always was so damn excited about a new mystery and the possibility of John noticing him being brilliant. It always made his eyes shine
“I don’t really know how else to express just how sure I am of this, Sherlock. Of how much I want this, want
John allowed himself some moments to compose himself when he was alone in the kitchen. The unlikeliness of Sherlock's behavior worried him. Never in his wildest dreams had he ever thought that Sherlock Holmes would seek bodily comfort (Sherlock didn't do touch), from him of all people. He exhaled loudly when the kettle beeped and rubbed his temples. His phone made a small sound, indicating a message from Lestrade. John unlocked the device with one hand and filled two mugs with the other (turns out he COULD make tea onehanded, after all). The message consisted of two words, probably typed in a hurry between paperwork.
The van finally cruises through the busy streets of London (Tan’s driving, for everyone’s safety and to Jonathan’s great disappointment). They all cheer excitedly for the camera, announcing the first episode of Queer Eye- London Edition. Karamo, casually chilling in the passenger seat and absolutely rocking a bomber jacket/button-down combo, then produces a tablet out of nowhere.
“I made a mistake. I hurt you, and that wasn’t an all right thing for me to do. I’m supposed to protect you, after all” He nudged Sherlock’s shoulder in a friendly way, that made the detective’s insides all fluttery.
Tan senses his uncomfortableness with the topic and decides to leave it for the moment. “Yeah? Tell me about it,” he encourages instead.
“No!” the detective huffed, louder, with the air of a bratty child. John did not hesitate to call attention to this fact.
Greg smiled fondly at the young man, as he was stumbling to his feet in a hurry to get home. Already in the doorframe, Sherlock turned once more and gave the inspector a tiny, but genuine smile. “Thank you, Greg”
John sighed, but not in his exasperated ‘Sherlock’s being an idiot’ kind of way. It sounded a bit remorseful, perhaps. He eyed Sherlock another few seconds, looking almost sad (which made a knot of anxiety curl in Sherlock’s stomach), before smiling, just a little bit (the knot loosened).   “You can kiss me as much as you like, whenever you feel like it”
. Always the savior, always the doctor, always caring, never judging (never calling names, instead compliments and encouragement), the soldier in times of need,
'Euros. Trigger. Small meltdown- JW' John typed awkwardly with one hand (How he wished Sherlock was there to witness his moment of clumsiness, he would have really enjoyed poking fun at him).
“See you, Greg” He left a slightly confused DI behind and stomped towards the bar, trying to look casually and failing.
Antoni regards him carefully for a minute. “You didn’t upset him. We get that a lot, it comes as a risk with the job, so to speak. But… we worry that you might make yourself unhappy when you cling too tightly to a concept of what your sexuality is supposed to be. And if that gets in your way of being truly happy, maybe it’s time to let go of the things holding you back.”
They’re all gathered together in the living-room for the last segment they’ll need to shoot for today (So John has been told by a production assistant); the Fab 5 gracefully arranging themselves on the couch, looking so drastically out of place between the case files and news papers and general junk Sherlock keeps laying around that John has to fight the urge to giggle hysterically.
When the expected reply never came, John actually paused cleaning and turned around, raising an eyebrow. When he saw the solemn expression on his partner’s face, he chuckled nervously. “Something up? You’re acting more funny than usual”
His heart did a funny fluttery thing when the detective, while never ceasing his conversation, grabbed his wrist and showed him gently but persistent down in his chair. The hand on John’s wrist stayed for good measure, until the doctor subtly patted it, signaling that he affirmed the silent request to stay. Who was he to refuse?
It wasn’t even an evaluation of anything regarding his character. It was just an assumption about with whom he’d like to share his bed with.
“But… what if…. What if I want to kiss you again? People will see” Why was he thinking about this now? They hadn’t even…worked out…. everything and yet all he could think about was…kissing John…now and…always. Something in his brain must have fried.
was he supposed to do? He would not stop living because Sherlock was gone. Although, it seemed like a tempting alternative.
As John made his way to the door, Sherlock sprang into action. “John, wait-“He tried to grab the other man’s arm, but the doctor pushed past him forcefully. He pushed the door open, not even paying attention to the concerned-looking Lestrade in the hallway. The detective had precautious given Anderson and Donovan the rest of the evening off, so they were alone on the floor. Better keep those noisy cats away from the domestic clearly taking place in his office. John turned his head, to cast the distressed looking consulting detective another long look.
When John drops off a final kiss against Rosie’s temple, Sherlock looks up from his book to watch his two Watsons. Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments.
in any way (although he felt like, really weak, in like, every way). Just when he thought how ridiculous it was and mustered the courage to cross the damn room to sink into Sherlock’s arms (aka the thing he wanted to for all fucking day) Watson pride be dammed; Sherlock moved, elegant as always, crossing the room in three long strides and halting right in front of John. The smile on his lips was only betrayed by the hint of worry shining in his eyes.
heard, this morning. Despite all the self-prepping about being accepting of his attraction to Sherlock, panic rises in John’s stomach.
between us is something to be ashamed of.” Although he spoke with an air of indifference about him, John didn’t miss the small twinge of hurt in his friend’s tone.
between the two. His realization must have appeared written all over his face (at least for the master of deduction), for Sherlock visibly relaxed and actually
He places Rosie in her crib and goes to sit on the armrest of the arm-chair Sherlock has quickly claimed as his favorite spot in the hotel room.
- against his back. A complicated feeling swelled within him, when he once more realized that he had lost this curious man two years ago, and had him back now- safe, sane, alive, and bickering.
He had to smile, despite the situation, for his heart clenched in the best kind of ways. He had never felt like this before. This connection. This selflessness. This utter devotion towards another human being. Gently, he cupped John’s wet and hot cheek, which caused his friend to finally look up. Despite their red, puffy, and slightly swollen state, the doctor’s eyes held a mosaic of emotions.
They took off to the direction of Mycroft’s town house, Greg and John falling into conversation easily, while Rosie asked Sherlock a thousand questions about the outdoors (which he
When his friend had taken a few hesitate sips, John had mercy and opened his arms. "Come here?" With relief written all over his features, Sherlock hurried to the couch, right into John's embrace. John gasped, surprised by the fast impact of detective against his chest. Still, it was a very Sherlock thing to do. Sherlock didn’t do half-hearted, he put everything he had into every little task at hand. Hugs, apparently, fell under the same category. Sherlock not only accepting, but downright craving physical contact was something completely new to him too; although, John had to admit, he could get quite used to it. The tall man relaxed completely once he was curled against his friend's broad chest.
He took a deep breath. Soldier up, Watson. Time to be brave. No turning back now, cards on the table.
Greg considered his next move. The chance of the doctor ending the relationship over a rude comment seemed highly unlikely. But something had been triggered and it was not entirely unlikely that this whole thing ended up with someone getting hurt. Greg didn’t really want to mingle… but Sherlock deserved to know. Sherlock, in a weird Holmes kind of way, was his friend, too. So, he deserved to know with what he was dealing here.
He had even gone so far in trying to manipulate Sherlock into pulling the trigger, to end his life- so the choice wouldn't hurt him so much. He had loved enough to make Sherlock hate him, would have given all of his life without a second thought. Just so that Sherlock could keep John in his life. Because Mycroft
He let go of John’s waist, to hand him to folded piece of paper. John raised an eyebrow in question. The detective gestured for him to open it. There was a small period of silence while John scanned the lines. His eye widened a little when he came to the main body of the document. He looked up, with an unreadable expression. Sherlock’s stomach did a forceful backflip and his heart sank wetly into his guts. There had been a really small chance that John wouldn’t agree to the idea, it was small but maybe significant enough, maybe he shouldn’t have taken the risk, maybe-
Sherlock swayed dangerously, a mixture of alcohol and the exhaustion from the past case crashing down on him like a wave. He could barely hold himself upright. John dragged him to the exit, carefully refraining from snapping at his detective rudely. He didn’t get why Sherlock had acted this way, and it had done a spectacularly good job at hurting him.
Without thinking too much about it, Mycroft started pointing out constellations, explaining how and why they were shaped the way they were. Greg hummed in affirmation from time to time; and when Mycroft looked over his shoulder, he caught sight of his little brother. Because that’s who he was in that very moment, not the genius master detective, just Sherlock. He had his knees drawn up to his chest, arms wrapped around them securely, his head thrown back to catch the grandeur of the night sky.
John wanders around the room with a sort of antsy restless energy, buzzing pleasantly through his veins.
Not understanding was a new, curious experience- one he wasn’t so sure he liked. He felt exposed, completely at John’s mercy; John who seemed to be comfortable and so very sure in this situation.
The detective was currently still frantically trying to wrap up the turmoil of emotions and thoughts that whirled through his mind.
“I am AWARE” the doctor snapped right back. “But” John closed his eyes. Inhaled. Exhaled. His hands were trembling. “I thought this” – he mentioned between them – “would be enough to punch some sense in you”
John was, to say the least, surprised about the open question directed his way. Sherlock still scarcely spoke about emotions, though he had grown more considerate for the doctor’s and his own. John didn’t, not after the night that changed everything between them, and wished he would never have to. But Sherlock sounded… unsure. And hurt; more hurt than he himself was probably aware of.
, perhaps, John realized when his stomach gave another painful lurch while he sat in the back of the cab.
He gave John a look, all sad determination. “I just don’t want you to leave. But if we start this, you will. I’m not… not good enough”
. Turns out, one does not simply invite the British Government over for tea to have a chat. Despite their conversation on the phone, Mycroft demanded instantly what it was that John and his little brother needed this time; and seemed genuinely surprised when John told him he was just here to talk a little about everything and nothing (hopefully getting Sherlock to express some gratitude). While he brewed some tea (the expensive stuff, not the cheap, embarrassing Tesco stuff he secretly loved) for himself and the confounded politician, John idly asked himself if anyone had ever bothered to spend some private time with the older Holmes brother. Does he have friends, a loved one? John, despite knowing the man for eight years, genuinely did not know.                                                                                While he placed some scones and jam on a tray (Mrs. Hudson, you’re a blessing), he realized that he seemed to know nothing about the man, who (despite his general appearance as a snobbish asshole) had saved their lives multiple times without second thoughts.
A byproduct of not caring for those around you was your trained indifference with regards to the feelings of others and the social appropriateness of one's behavior. Before John Sherlock didn't care, but now he did. He wanted John to like him, he wanted John to stay, to be praised by him. It was the only insecurity he allowed himself to openly display (without emotional breakdowns) when he openly searched for his only friend's approval.
So it was about the Fall. Everything… every little thing had to be about the bloody fall. Sherlock had apologized. But Sherlock had also saved John. He did it all for the doctor, but he didn’t seem to get it! (That wasn’t true. Of course, he got it. There was scarcely a day where John didn’t show his partner how grateful he was for his sacrifices. But Sherlock was angry… John was angry at him and he didn’t do anything wrong!) Sherlock opened his mouth, but John wasn’t done yet.
b) If all this talk about vulnerable mind-sets reminds you of age-play stories, that's not really what I had in mind for this story (It's just not my cup of tea). However, if it's your cup of tea, and you are interested in writing anything in this direction based on this story here, let me know. I'm not opposed, as long as I'm credited.

Sherlock peaked up from his safe spot against John’s pulse point to shyly gauge his partner’s reaction.
of those things. He’d later realized that he had acted incredibly stupid. That he reacted, before he thought about it. But in that moment, nothing else mattered, but getting John awake. Getting John out of there. He started out with shakingly calling his name, and when the doctor didn’t stir, he made the panicked decision to
“The bug has been on her best behaviour,” John replied, arranging the infant seat in the back of the car.
John, for he was not going to let himself be mocked like this, thank you very much, turned his head again, staring at the TV. “I didn’t tell you anything,” he mumbled, even though he was aware of how childish he sounded. He could feel those piercing eyes on the back of his head. The situation was awkward and tense, but nonetheless, his friend stayed seated behind him, and nonetheless, he held him lightly against his lean stomach; and there, right there was this special feeling tingling deep in John’s gut; a feeling he just couldn’t place. Sure, he knew what if meant but…. Not at all what it entailed.
Sherlock, meanwhile, was busy rearranging the chaos John’s words had made of his mind-palace. Because Oh.
. He wanted John to like him again, to be comfortable around him again, to trust him again. Never in his life would he have thought that he’d sit in is darkened living room at 3 am on a Thursday, watching two steaming cups of tea go cold and just
“A home is the most treasured space of memory we have. I’m not here to change this. All your precious possessions will remain right where they are, I’m just here to upgrade the living-conditions to hopefully improve the living-quality of your little household.”
“We’re almost home, Rosie. I’m not very pleased with your behaviour. Give me your hand, I’m having no more of this fuss”
The smell of cheap laundry detergent and tea cleared the fog over his senses enough to register that, indeed, John was there alive and well, and the scream indeed belonged to him. Only it wasn't a scream and more of a choked cry, muffled and raw with tears (When did he start crying? Sherlock Holmes didn't cry). Slowly, the blackness started to fade back into color, blurred edges once again became sharp corners and rooms, neatly organized mind-palace rooms. The white noise ceased more and more, until there was nothing but his own heartbeat in his ears.
His stare was enough to make Sherlock realize what he had just done. Something had shifted between them, treating the fragile bond of their relationship. But he hadn’t meant it like that, right? He himself wasn’t even sure anymore! Did he want to hurt John? Why would he ever want to hurt wonderful, strong, beautiful John Watson?!
“I could use some help here, Sherls” John’s voice was filled with warm teasing. It sort of became their routine. John would call him “Sherls” whenever he tried to coax him into doing some housework, because Sherlock once mumbled the nickname seemed more fitting for a housewife in her forties. His reply was always the same: “Don’t call me that”, then John would proceed to tease him some more, which would ultimate lead to cheerful fighting, sometimes cleaning, and playful sex. It was a weird routine, but it was
It was the first time on a long while- since the asylum – that Sherlock picked up his violin again, shortly after Mycroft had left. The doctor put down the novel he had picked up, to watch the extraordinary genius get lost in his own melody. The younger man kept his eyes closed, as he gently let the music float through him.
look, and his friend stared back, equally stubborn. His eyes flickered to Greg, who no doubt found the situation beyond
His mind felt pleasantly empty, when he pulled the detective gently down to his eye level and gave him a sweet peck on the lips. It was a small gesture, which spoke volumes.
Thinking of the flatmate, Sherlock became slightly aware of John's voice seeping through his door. He sensed no other presence, so a phone call it was. As quietly and as casual (in case he got caught in the act) as he could, the slender detective tiptoed to the door and opened it a crack, wide enough to observe the strong composure of his best friend and to eavesdrop the conversation he was having. His skilled eyes quickly made out the basic factors (called instead of being called, nervous about the interaction (highly unusual), a male counterpart; not too close but no stranger- maybe a fellow soldier from Afghanistan? A college from the surgery? Further collection of data is required). Sherlock made a small effort to hide in the shadows of the still mostly closed door (for John
“Use your words, darling. Otherwise Daddy won’t know what’s bothering you and can’t help you”. Sherlock would know, tho. One glance, one fucking glance would be all Mr. Consulting-detective needed to understand the situation and solve Rosie’s turmoil. One fucking glance. Too bad he wasn’t
He feels good about himself for the first time since in forever, he’s not going to ruin this over a sexual crisis.
Sherlock felt the body in his embrace tense up. He reacted immediately: “I’m sorry I didn’t notice sooner.” John sucked in a sharp breath, because, really Sherlock shouldn’t need to notice “it” sooner, there shouldn’t be an “it” to notice at all. Why was there always an “it” with him? Why hadn’t he felt
John made a vague noise of agreement. He felt slightly bad for being so non-verbal on Greg who had always been a good friend, but couldn’t help himself. Of course, Sherlock was brilliant. Sherlock wasn’t the problem here. Discreetly, he rubbed his aching leg.
It was John who broke the silence first, with a soft “I’m glad you’re here”; but it was Sherlock who closed the distance between them, no longer rooted to the spot, but eager and fast, clinging to John’s sitting frame, basically sitting on his lap. John let out a surprised yelp, when the detective forcefully buried his face in the junction of the doctor’s throat and collarbone.
, John had no idea. He used some gentle words, which hopefully showed the government official that he shouldn’t feel as guilty as he did, and at the same time expressed his deep fondness for Sherlock. They at least weren’t dismissed, which John interpreted as a success.
“And they’re so unfitting (here, Tan pinches the deep green jumper John’s wearing right now, that conveniently has bits of Indian take-out and baby drool all over it). You’re such an attractive man, you don’t have a reason to hide in those things.”
Sherlock’s face distorted in an expression that was almost pained, before he slammed is face back against John’s throat and let out one, tiny, heart-breaking sob. Slightly panicked by this turn of events, John tightening his grip around Sherlock, frantically analysing which part of his statement could have made the genius this upset.
“Listen, I get it. Despite what the Netflix tagline might suggest, you don’t have to listen to anything we advise you. It’s your life and it’s about what makes you happy-“ here, he smiles at John brightly and John feels the irrational desire to blurt out that it feels like
During their first year of sharing a flat, Sherlock acquired a vast knowledge about how to behave around people suffering from PTSD: No quick movements. Always stay in eyesight. Physical contact can trigger a panic attack.
The moment the doctor realized Sherlock had taken off alone once again always evoked the same emotions in his system. First came the shock. Then came the helplessness. Followed by anger. Finally: cold, terrifying, crippling panic. It was always like that.
It’s the first instance he ever addressed those feelings out loud and they lift off his chest like a burden that has been sitting on it for years. The moment he utters them he becomes strangely choked-up, like saying them adds a reality to them that hadn’t been there before.
John self-consciously bites his lower lip. “Yeah,” he admits, not sure if it’s a segway into one of Sherlock’s infamous rants, or if he actually doesn’t care about it at all. Or if he’s aware of the implication lying between the lines of this simple statement. “I’m sorry I didn’t-“
And then he stands and trots to the bathroom, giddy and slightly nauseous in the prospect of new possibilities.
“Really, Sherlock?” John let out an exasperated sigh. “You’re seriously trying to tell me about relationship conventions? You, of all people?” Sherlock, to his own horror, found himself helplessly overwhelmed with the amount of negative emotions directed his way. He hadn’t done anything wrong, after all! He caught the killer! He apologized! What did it matter if he meant it or not?! “John-“ he started cautiously, not desiring to anger the man more than he apparently had; but at the same time he was getting slowly fed up with the way the doctor was treating him.
“Whoever you’re texting with” he barked irritated. “You’re clearly emotionally invested, but your hesitation to type out a reply indicates that you haven’t made a move yet, you’re nervous and fear rejection” Greg blinked at him for some seconds. “So just ask her out and be done with it, your emotional turmoil is getting on my nerves”
It’s been a long time since Mycroft had seen his little brother so at peace with the world. It tugged at his heart and he admitted quietly to himself, that maybe this vacation wouldn’t be so bad, after all.
“I’m ordering Chinese. You’re eating” The doctor informed him good-naturedly on his way to the kitchen; ruffling through the wild mane of black curls when he passed. Sherlock’s face crumbled momentarily in an expression of pure delight, before he caught himself; overplaying his obvious reaction.
John sighed again. He really needed to focus at the task at hand. Spacing out during the statement of the suspect's mother was a bit not good. Although the distressed woman only confirmed the deductions Sherlock had made about 10 minutes after entering the "crime scene". It wasn't much of a crime scene, actually. Social services could have done just as well, but terrified parents called Scotland Yard after their children returned from the subsects home with severe wounds, too scared to say anything. They placed their bets on a child molester. What they found had been something out of a complete different direction. It was a down-right tragedy, to be frank.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry about the whole ‘I’m not gay’-thing. There’s…. I haven’ been very honest to myself about that. Or to you-“
They had chatted for roughly two hours; John explaining Sherlock’s emotional turmoil to his brother, and listening intently to Mycroft’s stories about their childhood, the issue with their sister and Sherlock’s problems with coping with any kind of emotional crisis. It became clearer by every word uttered by the politician that he not only felt extremely guilty for the psychological problems and therapeutic endeavors his little brother did undergo (although he was a child himself at that time!), but also for the detective’s multiple escapades with drugs (although it clearly had been Sherlock’s own choice).
“Thanks” he murmured, his voice husky from exertion. Sherlock offered him the tea, John drank gratefully. They sat in silence a couple of minutes, drinking tea. Eventually, the doctor broke the silence, sighing.
For some seconds, Sherlock’s heavy breathing and the ticking of the clock were the only sounds in the room. Greg subtly checked his watch. It was close to 11; almost 4 hours since John stormed off to Baker Street. Part of Greg was impressed by the doctor’s stubbornness. Another part of him wasn’t surprised. Sherlock’s fall would always remain a sore spot for his friend; and even though Greg did a great deal to help him in the first year after Sherlock’s death, they never talked about this dark period in John’s life. It sort of became the elephant in the room for everyone who had been involved. Sherlock was, as Greg guessed, oblivious to the damage his absence had done. He sighed. John stopped talking about it. Even though it might have been important to talk with Sherlock about it. Of-fucking-course he didn’t.
talking about it, while he rocks Rosie to sleep in his arms, bouncing her ever so often. Today has been a fantastic day for him. He feels even better than he had after yesterday, although the looming truth of his obvious attraction to Sherlock is still a big question mark in the back of his mind.
But right now, it feels like it wouldn’t even matter. Tan knew it was there (because John told him, although spared him the less than pretty details) and yet he still told him that he found him physically attractive. Like the blotchy scar-tissue around his shoulder doesn’t define his sex appeal as a person.
They kissed until their lips were of a rich red color and tingled to the touch; and when John buried his nose in the black curls he adored so desperately, he heard the faintest of whispers:
John swallowed down his own panic, seeing Sherlock (calm controlled cool Sherlock) like this (a mess having an anxiety attack) was highly alarming. John quietly took the pulse (too fast), all while he whispered soothing nothings into the detective's ear. When he placed an arm careful around his waist (too thin), Sherlock's knees buckled and he feel very ungracefully to the ground. He didn't seem to mind, his eyes were pressed shut but the eyeball moved violently behind the soft skin of the lid, an indicator that he was lost somewhere in his big mind palace, and his desolate cries indicated he desperately wished to escape.
Sherlock, who had his nose buried in some cold case files he presumably nicked from Greg’s office at some point during the day, looks up briefly and gives him one of his rare genuine smiles; the one that John likes best because his eyes crinkle around the edges good-naturedly when he does it.
John should probably be annoyed at their indecency and total respect for their privacy, but just couldn’t care less when Sherlock hummed happily and even casually chatted with Lestrade once the detective returned with a possibly buzzing Rosie trailing at his side. All the while, his partner’s protective arms never left him. John didn’t feel one tad embarrassed for not really participating in the conversation and just leaning against Sherlock’s warm chest. Rosie was, as anticipated, totally gone on the little bunnies and went on happily pestering John about her absolute need for a pet. John declined every time, but Rosie was far too happy to really care about it, trying to charm Lestrade in buying her a bunny instead. The detective wavered, and compromised to buying her a stuffed animal some time. John was glad Rosie seemed to like Lestrade very much; so he was a protentional babysitter for the evenings he’d like to spend with his partner alone.
These nights occurred less and less frequent as time moved on. They had shaken him up in the beginning, leaving him red-eyed and exhausted in the mornings; looking almost as dead as he felt. Sherlock gave him an expression he couldn’t quite place when he slumped at their kitchen with the night’s unpleasantries clearly written all over his face.  On very rare occasion, when night terrors accompanied the crippling self-doubt and he barely limped to his chair, Sherlock stood, looking utterly lost and helpless for a second, before he crossed the room in two long steps and hugged the fragile doctor to his chest. John sank into these moments of comfort gratefully, seeking Sherlock’s warmth and the pulse of the man’s blood against his ear. Sherlock was alive, and so was John. They were together, it would be fine. As long as Sherlock was there, everything would be fine.
Mycroft’s lip curled in a tiny amused grin. “Not many people are this eager to be considered as an acquaintance of the Holmes family”
'Is he alright?- GL' John smiled a little at the genuine concern. Although Sherlock never bothered to even learn his name, Greg had always been good to him. John considered thanking him for everything he's done for Sherlock, but decided against it eventually. It would seem pretty weird, no matter how close he and Sherlock were. The last thing he needed was people making up ridiculous rumors about their relationship status again!
Instead, he said the only things which didn’t seem hollow to him, didn’t seem fake and pretentious; the only promise he could keep: “I’m here. And I’ll stay. And I…. I’ll try, with everything I have, to not leave you alone anymore”
“C’mon.” Sherlock murmured against his best friend’s hair once they were alone. “Let’s go home” his warm breath caressed softly against John’s neck.
“Your psychosomatic limp is acting up again” It wasn’t a question, like almost nothing was a question out of Sherlock’s mouth.
A little over four hours were far enough time to let Sherlock suffer. He actually felt quite sorry for ignoring him, but he couldn’t help himself. He knew Sherlock was safe, thanks to Mycroft and Greg, so it was good to have a little time to clear his own head. Although, if he was being honest, he only spent around 50% being irritated / working himself in a mood, and 50% missing Sherlock terribly. Not really a success, huh?
„Sherlock, I’ve got him!“ His voice was raspy, because of the exertion of the tackle he just performed; his thighs hurt like hell, because of the hellish sprint; and he was soaked right to the bones, because he had been sweating like crazy. Yet, John Watson couldn’t remember a moment during the last few weeks in which he felt more
. They made him feel confused and small, like a child lost in the woods. It had made him angry, not knowing why they were there. Now he knew… and wished he didn’t. Was actually glad that he couldn’t remember everything. Still…. Mycroft had lied to him. Why did that feel like such a grand betrayal? Maybe because it sometimes felt like he had deleted too much. Like he was now missing something…. important. A connection between the images his mind reproduced and the feelings that floated around unattached in his mind palace.
an idiot!  He had gotten so lost in feelings sorry for himself, and self-doubt, and ‘Sherlock’s married to his work’ that he had failed to realize how much his friend had changed since they sort of became a family. It was written clearly all over the usually so calm expression that Sherlock felt so much more than he had before.
Greg tuned Sherlock’s protests right out, smiling to himself about their strange domesticity he came to appreciate so much.
feelings with it? His friend could be gay, after all. John doesn’t really know (and realizes he might be the worst best friend in the history of best friends) and now he can’t stop thinking about it.
Sherlock didn’t have any experience with consoling people. He usually didn’t find himself in any situation where he would use this skill. He usually didn’t care enough. So, he was clawing to the few things he knew: He knew that John liked tea and warm showers. He knew John slept best when his sheets were fresh. He knew John felt lonely sometimes, and he knew that John was a physical man; a man who enjoyed the closeness and warmth of another person’s touch.
In the moment he closed his mouth, he spotted Sherlock coming back into his field of vision (he had gone upstairs with Lestrade, John recalled, to search for the mentally ill girl, who was the culprit of all this mess). Now that he thought about it, he shouldn't have let him. Not that he, John Watson, was in any position to tell the great Sherlock Holmes what to do. But he really should have tried (and maybe this once, Sherlock would have listened).
who was excited and eager and aching because of him. The thought alone was almost enough to bring the doctor dangerously close to shooting off like a rocket. Sherlock wasn’t too far off either, judging by the quiver in his thighs.
It’s well into the fifth outfit they tried out and he looks handsome in. Every. Single. One. Of. Them.
"Better?" John asked after the spend almost an hour just savoring the presence of the other. He felt Sherlock nod slightly against neck. The silence felt strange to John, tho. Although he didn't really notice, Sherlock talked almost constantly when he was out of his mind palace. About his deductions, about cases, about the stupidity of the rest of mankind; to John, to himself, to the skull. A silent Sherlock was a Sherlock he wasn't used to anymore. A silent Sherlock was just like a Sherlock that wasn’t comfortable around him, a Sherlock that wasn’t his friend. A Sherlock from all these years ago.
John, slightly surprised by the change of position, and by Sherlock’s open confession of his emotions, gave his friend a look over his shoulder. Sherlock, meanwhile was busy rearranging them so that he could securely wrap his body around the doctor’s smaller frame from behind. Keeping him safe and warm, in a cocoon made of blankets and body heat.
“But your fashion sense is- I’m sorry to say that- absolutely ghastly. Look at this thing (here, he holds up an oatmeal-colored wool jumper John had gotten about ten years ago)- it is horrible!”
All he gets as an answer is a delicate arched eyebrow, that somehow so much reminds him of the consulting detective in question that he has to suppress the urge to snort hysterically.
to Sherlock's presence, the adrenalin, their life in 221B Backer Street. When he first joined the army, he had had dreams. Delusional, romanticized dreams to do good in his life, devote his talents to a higher good. Safe the world, so to speak.
Sherlock’s face fell, just a little. He tried to cover it up quickly, with his usual mask of indifference, but John did catch a glimpse of disappointment in his eyes.
It was the third night spend in that fashion when it happened. John had a nightmare. Sherlock realized the telltale sounds instantaneously. He thought the doctor had overcome the deep psychological problem, but apparently, they still happened from time to time. Maybe, he’d been having them the whole time since he had been back. Maybe he had just managed to hide it. Maybe Sherlock just didn’t notice it, because he tried to give John the privacy he seemed to desire. Maybe he could have helped John again. If only he chose to notice.
“Yeah”, he coughed awkwardly in a weak attempt to give Sherlock another explanation for his sudden increase of body temperature (Sherlock didn’t buy it). “I should get going” John didn’t miss the tiny flash of disappointment in Sherlock’s eyes when he turned to face the doorknob. John also didn’t miss the slight hunch in the detective’s posture when he realized John wouldn’t comment on the kiss. Or repeat it.  The detective visibly retreated into his mind-palace, probably to analyze what had went wrong.
Sherlock had set them up, with John’s back comfortably resting against Sherlock’s stomach, and the detective’s lanky legs enclosing his sturdy thighs. The points of contact, of warmth, helped him calm, until he was basically laying boneless against his friend. They settled on watching a bunch of animal documentaries on Discovery channel. John’s mind calmed with the images of a natural world that was completely detached from his insecurities and worries. Before he knew it, he felt comfortable with himself again; enough so that he allowed himself some soft giggles when Sherlock corrected the narrator’s monologue about wild bees. Sherlock paused. John turned his head a little to see what had brought this on, and immediately regretted it. The detective was looking at him
John stopped petting the dark curls (Sherlock discreetly swallowed down a whine) and gave him his best ‘no nonsense’ glare.
“Karamo had the idea to invite some of the guys to Rosie’s party. Maybe she could make some friends, can you imagine that? I bet she’d love some friends!”
John wasn’t paying attention to any of that; he was much more concerned with inwardly FREAKING OUT, because surely Sherlock must have noticed, why did Sherlock not DO anything about it? The realization that he wanted Sherlock to care for him right now- in front of all these people, in public-  was almost as devastating as the shattering proposition that maybe Sherlock did not WANT to care for him anymore.
John swallowed, suddenly feeling a little bit hot under the collar. It wasn’t like he kept a secret, because effectively they were not in a relationship yet, but still…he was nervous. Greg was one of his best friends, but he wasn’t ready to share the new side their friendship started to develop. He would, he promised himself, once they’d worked it out. For now though, he settled for a smile which he hoped came off in a natural way.
Sherlock, more than he had before, and the situation was both reliving and terrifying. He wished he could give something- anything- back. But nothing was enough. All he could do was to not bother his friend any more than he already did, with his pathetic neediness and pray that Sherlock would not stop caring for him. He
Mycroft went off to the bathroom area to dress in a more appropriate attire, meaning a suit that wasn’t as expensive and made of lighter material. John remarked he still looked quite fancy nonetheless, especially compared to Greg’s band t-shirt and cut-off-at-the-knee jeans look. Before the politician could educate them on the “highest requirement when standing in her majesty’s service, which is to always dress impeccable, thank you very much”, Greg placed his obnoxiously large sunhat on Mycroft’s, quote, “pretty little ginger head” and shushed him away, to go play with Sherlock and Rosie.
eavesdropping, especially when Sherlock was the culprit), but watched with growing interest none the less. How could John possibly be calling?
was the army doctor- in his bed, out of his bed, in his heart. The intensity of it all was intoxicating. And terrifying.
