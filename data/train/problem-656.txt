"I left as soon as I could to make sure we were all safe. I stayed gone to continue it and I also didn't want anyone to think I wanted your family fortune or to capitalize off of your name or anything. I was selfish, Sherlock."
"Because people don't get married for science, Sherlock. Now I've always dreamed of a huge political arrangement like my ancestors used to have," Sherlock couldn't help the briefest of smiles at the jest before sitting up to lean his elbows on his pyjama-clad knees, "but, in this day and age, it isn't really a thing anymore."
"I don't know why you're so angry," Sherlock was saying, pushing him up that mountain even further. "It's not like we don't have enough petrol to last until we get somewhere we can get another charging cord."
"And yours isn't?"
The deep blue button up was open most of the way, revealing sparse, honeyed chest hair. Two long necklaces made up of coloured beads worked into hemp played peek-a-boo with the flaps of his top. Fitted dark denim jeans, that looked as expensive as Sherlock's actually were, hugged hips narrowed by all the exercise John got running the streets with him. The icing on the cake was his hair. His entire head, to be more accurate. The years and stress had thoroughly floured what was once mostly blond, leaving the locks, neatly cut, but longer than he ever let it get since getting out of the military, mostly snow and silver, streaked with gold. The beard, now impeccably thinned and styled, was more of a light brown with the same gold threads running through it. It gave his face a much more youthful texture. He looked ten to twelve years under his age, but, surprisingly, not as if he were trying to do so. The effortlessness of it all was what struck Sherlock the most. Even John's nervous habit of lip manipulation, pursing, licking, biting... had become an accessory, its current incarnation more of a manifestation of assessment than anxiety. There was nothing anxious about him, unless the 'anxious' was followed by the words 'to get you to beg for it'. Even his question held no hesitation, no hint of uneasiness.
Sherlock abruptly noticed, as John kissed him through the aftershocks, that he was somehow completely nude. It shouldn't have surprised him as it did, but he remembered nothing of it happening, only the rather embarrassing noises John pulled from him by applying pressure and/or moisture to certain seemingly non-erogenous parts of his body. Some of those parts had seemed inert, as if they were underwater, impossible to use in building a fire. But John was a completely different chemical mix than anyone else. It was like they were calcium flares, able to ignite him without any lasting effect. John was lava, burning at a temperature so high that everything around him was brought up to his level, deformed and remade layer by layer into something richer.
"No you can't but this man had children; children who need to know what happened to their father as soon as possible." Sherlock looked genuinely contrite.
"I'll take that as a compliment," John replied in a near mumble.
"Logically, no."
After a rousing discussion about her silver chain, they were informed that it was now calm enough to travel. First stop, The Holmes childhood estate. Sherlock refused to release the child the entire time, Willa unexpectedly allowing herself to be carried until they reached the field before the front door of the manor. Nor would he be more than an inch away from John, mostly laying a free hand on what he could.
"It was an experiment." These conversations could go on for an hour if nothing was done about it.
"Oopsie." The only indication of any reaction was that his lean shoulders tightened minutely when John shouted. It meant a modicum of contrition, despite the fact that it probably would happen again. Also, when did John get so in tune with the smallest of gestures? He rushed over to where the offending appendage was stored and yanked open the door, thinking twice before donning a pair of Marigold washing up gloves with which to handle the specimen. "John!" Sherlock cried out, getting to his feet so quickly, he nearly upset the entire table. John, being smaller, twisted away from his long, grabbing hands and went around the other side of the table. "That has to maintain a certain temperature in order to tell me what I need to know. You're ruining it!" he explained rapidly.
"It was a kiss. Well, more or less. I thought you'd prefer something that wasn't a pretense or a means to an end and spontaneity keeps things... fresh."
"Not to mention there are options such as surrogacy and adoption available to couples like ourselves and my parents are quite looking forward to our slowing down enough with our wildly successful business in order to consider the options. John, I'm bored." Sherlock stormed off as usual, the only difference being he pulled John along with him by the hand instead of just walking a bit slower in order to allow him to catch up. The latter man overheard the child's mother scolding Mick for whatever he said to obviously offend them. They went in the direction of the head organizer to let her know they were opting for an early cab back to the hotel, as they had plans to take advantage of the place's amenities. She winked at them and Sherlock worked his taxi-hailing magic, where it was as if one was on call exclusively for him, as they slightly swung their joined hands between them.
"I won't be able to let you go and I can't lose you. Not again. Not like this." Sherlock was so quiet and still that John was afraid he had anyway, at least in part.
"Well done Mrs. Hudson!"
"Sorry," he said quickly.
Sherlock couldn't help his return smile, wasn't even aware he was doing it until about the third time it happened, which apparently made him pull a face and John subsequently burst out laughing a little at what must have been an inappropriate time in the story. John apologised profusely and promptly blamed it on Sherlock, as usual. Mrs Hudson forgave him the instant she saw the face for herself. She shook her head with a little titter, not knowing what she was going to do with "you boys" before asking no one in particular where the fresh nutmeg she required was. As if summoned, Lestrade came in with a large brown paper sack, complaining about the holiday hoards. He set it on the table's only clean spot and fished out the jar of whole nutmeg, holding out his acquisition proudly. Mrs. Hudson didn't take it, only handed him a metal grater and a paper towel. He sighed, slipped off his coat, and draped it over the back of the chair he was to sit in.  His help was apparently part of an ongoing apology for his part in Sherlock's downfall. As soon as he finished telling how he was trapped, looking for Sherlock but no one knowing where he was for sure, so he was to join John in the gallows to wait for him to get back in or make his presence known, Sherlock pounced, so to speak. "It can't be all that interesting as you're not begging," Sherlock stated dismissively. "I'm in the middle of something just now, Lestrade. I'll look at your cold case later. John, the experiment-"
Sherlock ended up turning his phone off when he glanced at the screen to see four new voice mails. Mycroft would pay for this. But later. Much later. After the swelling in his crotch went down as John kissed and washed the rest of him after the conditioner had been applied. John aided in that endeavor immensely, Sherlock registering the regret he felt at having to keep his hands away from his backside as he had made him sore. He didn't like that tiny part of him that felt proud to have basically fucked him bow-legged, but only because when, in his useless flights of fancy, he pictured their first time together, it would always be slow and gentle. Everything John deserved it to be. Sherlock contented himself with touching as many other things as he could reach. His lizard brain triumphed in the marks about his collar area even as his conscious mind shook its figurative head at the rather adolescent form of claiming.
John was formally cheered, even by the staff who knew what was happening whether or not they were involved, and toasted. However he only partook in two shots(the 'For science!' toast implemented by Sherlock catching on immediately)before he begged for his fiancé to be allowed to take him back to their rooms. Sherlock did so without having uttered a word directly to him since his rousing speech. He'd ask later, however, as at the moment he was too busy feeling the most satisfied he'd ever been in his life, except for the time he performed an appendectomy on a seven year old Afghan girl whilst her village was being bombarded by shells. There was also the play he was in with Sherlock, but he could only see the good bits as well as some of the real bits. He sank into the hot bath and dunked his head for a few seconds, enjoying the absolute peace of being underwater. He popped up when he saw a distorted face hovering above the water line.
"Oh, John," double meaning there, "That's not bravery. Bravery is doing what needs to be done in order to achieve a goal despite fear. I simply don't think to be afraid because it's a simple case of figuring out how to acquire what I desire."
"I'm not and it isn't." Sherlock stopped his hand's descent and frowned at the ceiling.
John began to slowly withdraw as Sherlock directed them toward his own bedroom, promising nothing past what was done for him. They stopped altogether as they kissed against the inside of Sherlock's closed door, John's eyes so full of worry that he couldn't bear to look into them. He busied himself once more with John's most enticing throat, his hands manipulating certain pressure points on his back in a measured manner, so that half of his words emerged with uncontrollable little moans. John was warning him that he'd never actually been with a bloke before, that he'd never
lush, exaggeratedly shaped lips were on his, warm and soft. They held for a moment just transferring energy, then they moved. Three long, soft kisses, tears mingling between them.
"No. I'm just sorry so much time was wasted." John could hardly breathe for Sherlock's eyes on him in that soft manner, his ample brow furrowed as he concentrated. He fought the urge to cross his arms, allowing Sherlock to look his fill. "Your Work is going to be pissed you cheated." John briefly arched an eyebrow and kept from smiling at his joke by the skin of his teeth.
"I can walk, thank you." John shrugged at Sherlock's rather panicked, questioning look. John could tell he was already wondering why she didn't like him anymore all of a sudden and was this normal behaviour for her. Willa was pretty independent as far as getting around went, her pushchair more of a rolling storage unit, impromptu napping quarters, and exercise equipment since she first attempted to learn walking. She comforted her Papa immediately by slipping her tiny hand into Sherlock's to be lead out of the room, pausing only to let John open the door for them first. She released Sherlock's hand in order to approach Lestrade on her own.
"Just checking on you," John called through the door. "You'll need to eat."
John straddled his lap, keeping his hips elevated to hover just above his mound of tumescence, and put the sandwich to his lips. As he chewed, John went for the tea. He'd already swallowed and so licked and then bit his lips as John blew on the liquid then lifted it to his mouth. Sherlock took several sips, keeping his eyes shut to the attractiveness before him, hoping it came off as mere enjoyment of the food. "You should try it," John said, getting the sandwich once more.
"I experimented with different meats," Sherlock was saying. "On your right there, that's bison, the center is Ayam Cemani, and the left is mutton. The heat goes up in intensity as you go across. I rather thought you'd start on the right as you normally do, despite being left-handed."
"Fine! Keep your tumor."
This must have been John "Three-Continents" Watson.
He grabbed John's hands and pushed them away. The doctor thankfully backed up a bit. "Headaches can be a serious symptom, Sherlock. Especially in light of some of the things you've been through-"
"Have you nothing else to say?"
?" They shared a bit of a chuckle over that.
"John, I-"
"Unbelievable," The detective inspector had mused, Sherlock able to picture the little head shake that always accompanied such statements.
"Hmm," Sherlock mused into his ear, causing the tiniest of pleasurable chills as his pointing finger indicated of whom he was talking. "Cancer, car crash, line of duty, obvious."
"You didn't say no," he teased, the exchange not helping him clear the vagueness. It was suddenly Sherlock's turn to kiss John senseless. He was very much caught off guard by it, but almost instantly fought back with all the ammunition in his arsenal. That which was appropriated for public, anyway. At least
"I was... working out the chemical composition of-"
knew he wasn't patient enough to wait out that healing process and so it wouldn't happen unless there was an actual emergency situation and he couldn't be freed in time.
"What do you mean?"
"Terrible!" John laughed, still hacking a bit.
"Mycroft can't keep his mouth shut because he's afraid he'll miss a wandering cake."
The gun Sherlock gave John was the one that Victorian John would have been issued in the war in which he would have been a part back then, according to ACD Canon. <3 <3
"I'm yours," he replied. Finally,
"I'm not. I didn't think I was. But when it comes to you... You're not the only one who is breaking self-imposed rules. I'll never be what you deserve. I'm selfish and possessive and it would be more for my own benefit. Also, it would benefit you and Willa legally and socially, though you care almost as little about those things as I do. They are, however, useful things to legitimately have." John purposefully controlled his breathing, his heart trying to escape its bone cage as Sherlock's mouth ran non-stop. It may have sounded like an 'or else' to those untrained in Sherlockian, but he wouldn't have taken Willa and there was absolutely nothing worse that could be done, in John's estimation. He had nothing else to lose. "If you don't wish to marry me I understand completely," he went on. "I would never try to take Willa from you but I wouldn't be able to see you ever again. You could still maintain contact with everyone else and I know you'd try to make it so I could see her regularly, but I would not be able to handle you being there and not completely mine."
But now he
An undetermined amount of time later, there were footsteps on the stairs.
"Come on then, love," he crooned, speeding his fingers up as Sherlock sped his thrusts, crying out, thighs shaking as his pulses spread sheer white from his jaw right down to its source.
"On 'three'. One, two, then reveal. May as well do it quickly, like ripping off a plaster."
They'd long gotten over John getting hard due to a snog session, but Sherlock still seemed embarrassed every time it happened to him, becoming defensive as was his go to when he was somewhat uncertain about something. John understood. It was more difficult for Sherlock than most when he wasn't in complete control of his body. Whether it was exploring his Mind Palace, or consuming substances, he had to be in charge of every aspect of every thing. John figured it was how he survived so much physical abuse, simply
"I'm going to need a better answer than that, Sherlock. I'm about to use it for its intended purpose and it would be lovely to know if I'm in danger of contracting anything."
"Fuck! Sherlock! I'm going to come," John blurted, but suddenly, he wasn't anymore. Sherlock grasped the base, pulling off with another wet noise, and just examined it, throbbing and leaking, copious amounts of the aforementioned lubricant combined with an abundance of saliva dripping in goopy waves, as he wheezed over the spectacle that was the result of his mouth's work. John had his head thrown back and was whining quietly at the ceiling, getting a little louder when Sherlock began unbuttoning his top for him, laying open-mouthed kisses on each subsequent inch of bared flesh.
He had to have his full attention, however. "John?" The name rolled off of his tongue as easily as anything. If it were possible for a word to taste good, it would be John's name.
say?"
"Of course not."
"Said you were sorry, I know." John sighed deeply and ran a hand through his hair, ruffling it a bit, as he'd been keeping it a little longer. Apparently women enjoyed it. Sherlock sure did. "You may even mean it because apparently, you have no idea what you did wrong." The words brought Sherlock back to harsh reality.
"How did you know what I'd been thinking about?" Sherlock's reply was a look from beneath his eyebrows that made John laugh. They took their seats, the other eight seats still empty. He looked over Sherlock's shoulder as he sent the photo and smiled, pressing a soft kiss to his jaw line.
"Girl," she panted, resting and accepting water from a bottle from Jessica as Marceline patted her brow with a clean flannel dipped in chilled champagne bucket water. Sherlock had warned them to keep their silence about what they could also see with a secretive finger to his lips whilst she drank.
"I just... I need to know what this is. With us I mean." Sherlock blinked at him for a long time thinking he must have missed a social cue because it seemed obvious.
The closing ceremony was a long brunch cocktail event. There was yet another beautiful suit for the pair, who spent as much time snogging as getting dressed, nearly missing the opening remarks. The more interesting bit was when Margie Skyped in from hospital, succeeding in getting the crowed riled back up about them, John especially. Sherlock made him stand and everyone raised their glasses to him, before whispering to him how adorable his blush was after he sat back down. He also assured him that the new parents were genuinely reconciled, at least for the moment, then kissed the corner of John's happy smile at the news.
"Well... can't have...
"Very funny."
"Right. Well we'll have to do this in my bedroom. There's more bare floor and we won't disturb Mrs. Hudson."
"Camera," Sherlock explained, again having to stop to say the words before continuing back to his seat.
"You... you planned this?"
They were rescued by the eating and speech portions of the evening, though they were of course heavily featured. Unfortunately, local celebrity was seen as a higher level of success than those who actually did more for the world. Not that their contribution was minor in any way, shape, or form. John was indeed very proud of what they'd achieved, even more so of the many things they'd done that weren't general knowledge. But everyone seemed so much more interested in their name rather than deeds.
"Oi! Get this down you," John directed tossing one of the bottles that surprisingly landed perfectly between the man's knees before downing half of another one in one go. He let the others fall onto the corner of the bed closest to him and began cautiously undressing as he watched Sherlock open his bottle one-handed and take rather dainty sips. He was beginning to suspect that Sherlock may not have been as drunk as he was behaving earlier, but then that wouldn't leave no explanation for the new development in their intimate contact introduced earlier. He re-sheathed his uniform in the garment bag and retrieved a couple paracetamol packets. He took his and removed Sherlock's from the other before having a piss and returning to the bedside.
"You had a headache and then began behaving a bit abnormally."
"I won't last," he warned, afraid he was holding Sherlock too tightly to breathe and attempting to slow down. The little menace just sped up, adding an intermittent muscle squeeze that had them practically screaming into each other's mouths with his release as a result of his cock being massaged between their stomachs. Sherlock's pulsing after shocks, set John off a moment later, satisfied that he hadn't broken his streak of pleasing his lover first. Sherlock lightly pushed him to his side so he could get at their smeared fluid on John's belly with that abnormally clever tongue. He worked his nipples mercilessly with both oral and manual manipulation. John was awash in sensation and somehow, Sherlock managed to stop just shy of over-sensitivity as he moved about his beloved's body, shamelessly tasting and sucking and biting and touching. John realized he was being cataloged and, once his exact spots were quickly found and managed with just the right amount of moisture and pressure, John's refractory period went from ten to non-existent in less than thirty seconds. A minute after that, Sherlock was sinking down onto him for round two.
Harry had taken them aside into a little room and told John she wanted to attempt to begin making up for all that had happened between them. She swore that this time, she was kicking the drink for good and had already been in this fancy new alternative program for months. It was proper hospital care in a home environment. At John's predictable reluctance, she laid out a specific timeline, describing her plan. John had never heard anything like that from her before yet he still of course doubted for the most part, though she outlined everything from diet and exercise to therapy and her plans to find various useful hobbies. That was until she got to the bit where she promised that when she was in full health for three or more years, and she had already made sure before she came to him that all would be in good working order, that she would proudly carry a baby of his and Sherlock's. They were full siblings therefore sharing the same lineage, so it would be a true combination of the two men, genetically speaking, if Sherlock provided his part. They'd hugged and cried and John apologised for still keeping his doubts, though he promised to support her. She seemed to understand completely.
"It's not like you to care how someone else is," John retorted, surprisingly irritated. He heard Sherlock lift his head from the microscope on the kitchen table and clearly pictured it turning mechanically to analytically peer at the back of John's head a moment before getting back to it.
"I... w-I figured you'd feel safer."
"You know what I like," John answered, lifting his chin in the direction of the drag queen server who'd just become present, and stretching his arms across the back of the seat behind Sherlock's head. John punctuated his air of complete relaxation by resting the heel of his right foot on the table. Sherlock tore his eyes from him long enough to order a pint of John's favourite lager and a refreshing cucumber beverage for himself that he could make last for hours if he wished. "I assumed we were supposed to be a couple when I first got a look at the place," John mentioned directly into his ear, as he cleverly hid their conversation from possible listening devices. It made a slight shiver run down his spine. "What does 'Johnlock' even mean, anyway?" Sherlock really hoped his expression was as at least neutral as he was attempting to make it, John was playing his part well, slightly nuzzling the ear into which he spoke.
"And here is our card," Sherlock continued. "When you're ready, ring Dr. Watson and he'll advise you on the best course of action in getting in to the Army." He then attempted to hand him a generous tip.
"Lestrade." John looked at him, eyes wide, yet still unable to stop chewing.
"John, what on earth are you-"
"John, we should-"
hadn't
"Am I?"
The pictures, when activated with the small remote he'd made sure John possessed, were repetitively moving digital renderings of the things that took place in Sherlock's brain from the left, right, back, and top, when he thought the word 'Magpie' after meditating. The colours that bloomed were all indicative of the hormones associated with actual love, not just infatuation or lust. The long paper was the printout from the heart monitor he'd had attached to himself to record yet more information. He recited the digits of Pi as his meditative focus until he heard the audio cue, provided through a recording of John saying it, played by Molly Hooper.
"I don't even have to see anything," he continued, adding his other hand, drawing his fingers down Sherlock's lengthy neck. "I can just... touch you through your clothes." He could have. It would have been plenty. "But I won't unless you agree." John put his face very close to Sherlock's, licking those lips and staring at his as if he would devour him.
"Thank you." Sherlock straightened his shirt and cleared his throat, still comically wobbling a little even sitting. John could tell he really wanted to pace as usual but wouldn't be able to concentrate on walking and talking at the same time in this rare moment of what was, for him, un-coordination. "I have one at my left Trapezius muscle. Only the left, coincidentally just where my moles are." He put his fingertips to the spot to indicate what he was talking of. "Other rather normal places, ears, nipples, well, my whole pectoral area, actually. They function much like female breasts in that capacity. Penis of course. One place that may be considered 'odd' by the Western world is the axillary area." It was John's turn to blink for a moment.
"Of course you don't." Oceanic blue eyes traveled the length of what he could see of John's body. Of course Mycroft saw how the last bit of post military recovery weight he couldn't seem to lose even after constantly running around with his baby brother, had melted away, leaving only corded muscle in its wake. Being in hiding had apparently done him some good at least. "You have my word I will not attempt to take her from you at any time." That was really it, the worry. Besides the soul crushing exploit of trying not to bother Sherlock with the task of raising a child. That was extremely difficult in and of itself, but add his needs and lifestyle and it would be virtually impossible for him. And there was the fact of the baby's safety. Mycroft then said what was probably the one thing that could convince him. "Mummy and Father already know about her." John sighed in exasperation and finally stepped aside. Two more people that were probably going to hate him for keeping this secret. "They are delighted with both you and her and want you to be reassured they only wish to have contact with you both."
"Well if I'm doing this, it would be fine for you to help yourself. It's only fair." Before his surprise at the statement could register on his face, John took himself in hand with long, extremely slow strokes, a sound of slight relief coming out of his mouth as he did so. Both of them were leaking at this point and John used his as lubrication, adding a bit of saliva for perfect friction. Once he was steadily stroking, Sherlock continued talking to him, speaking as if his only purpose was to make him orgasm. It was all so surreal. "You want to fuck me, don't you John?" Yes.
It was actually quite lovely. Sherlock was much more romantic than he liked to admit, acquiring for John strange little keepsakes or giving him weird yet thoughtful gifts, sometimes left in odd places. There had been an old book of healing from some ancient society, a WWI bayonet, and a new cleaning kit for his Browning among other things. Sherlock behaved himself more than usual when he was promised a head petting to help him think, or a new part with which to experiment. He purchased a fridge after all for his experiments and kept it in the bedroom, even going so far as to get a brand new one for the kitchen. John nearly kissed him on the mouth for that, as it was so very thoughtful of his Sherlock and when exactly had he started referring to Sherlock that way in his own mind?
"What?"
"I was in public all night and, frankly, didn't have anything to swear about."
"But... why did it have to be... that way? Why couldn't you just...?"
John had little to no interest in sex after Sherlock Fell. He tried a few times, only able to get his partner off. One doesn't acquire the moniker 'Three Continents Watson' without having learned a few tricks that kept them coming back for more. But Sherlock somehow made his insides burn with a simple kiss or a look. Of course he had a libido, but all the pain and heartache to get off became no longer worth it... except for with him.
"You were afraid I would reject you."
"Sure," he conceded, completely truthful, but not believing for a moment Sherlock would find a quick solution to
"When am I not?"
John danced in a way that had Sherlock completely forgetting that he hated the music. The ex Army doctor moved in a way that staked complete claim on his partner, warning rivals off, and further attracting everyone all at once. John held onto him solidly but non-restrictively, making sure Sherlock was free to move wherever and however he wished whilst being firmly tethered to him. It was frighteningly similar to being high, John's hands on him, bodies moving in sync with each other and the music. Sherlock often turned to press his back against him, as, not only had he not been this hard in nearly a decade, he couldn't quite handle the way John looked at him, in such a way as to continue to have complete authority over him even if they weren't touching.
"I think we should play it by ear."
"Not really, no," came the half muffled agreement, followed by a sniff that mirrored his own.
"Hm? Why wouldn't I be?" He could possibly have sounded more offended, but it would have been a difficult task. Used to it, John just smiled warmly.
"You did maintain your erection, you know."
"Hm." It was interesting if nothing else, Sherlock's rather clinical description doing nothing to stop John's overwhelming(read: drunk)curiosity. When all was said and done, though they seemed fine, they were both still quite intoxicated. It was the reason they were where they were in the first place. Besides, John was a medical man. It was perfectly normal to have an above average inquisitiveness regarding bodily functions. Those were his explanations to himself for saying the words, "That'd be interesting to see." He tried to work out whether or not he was taking advantage. No, it wasn't an average request, but then, Sherlock was full of socially atypical queries. It was nice to have one for himself, for a change. However, would Sherlock, with his vast ignorance of human behaviour, actually
"Semen."
"There you are. If the notoriously unobservant masses see something, you must be radiating discontent." Sherlock was never that distracted and it was worrying.
It was familiar and domestic and comforting, all cornerstones of the fact that this was a dream; a very vivid dream in which all five senses were fully stimulated. Even within the unconscious illusion, he could tell his eyes were shut, the orange glow of early morning sunlight on the other side of his lids serving as a gentle incitement to wakefulness. It didn't demand, but bade him open his eyes in his own time, however long it took. He was enveloped in what he could only think of as 'the fragrance of dawn'. It spoke of not only newness, but the history of time, the rebirth of light after death. Basically, how someone extremely dear to someone else would smell at first light, whether they be lover, parent, sibling, or child, clean sweat and warm with impending enthusiasm for the day ahead. There was also a rather octopus-like quality to the embrace, as if there were many arms holding him at once. His mouth tasted of security in the fact that whoever was his bed-mate wouldn't object to an affectionate kiss, no matter how heinous his breath, or how they would playfully inform him of how offended they were by it.
Sherlock's urgent, "John!" confirmed what he was afraid of, even before Margie shouted,
Please, John!
John's chest wasn't solid muscle anymore, but his shoulders were broad and the whole thing screamed (at least to Sherlock) hidden strength. It gave him more amusement than anyone could realize picturing John taking out that cabbie whilst wearing a cuddly oatmeal jumper with a fresh hair cut. Which brought him to the scar. Sherlock's mind couldn't help the standard deductions (
"There's... data missing. Things I don't know about you, despite knowing you."
"Sherlock, I thought I was under no obligation!" Panic returned in full force.
"So I
"Your conditions are completely understandable as well as acceptable. If you lost your peace of mind, I'm sure we would all suffer greatly." John bluntly nodded once. "There are six weeks left in the renovation of Baker Street to accommodate our new addition as well as bolster your confidence a bit in the security measures being taken. Until such time as they are complete, you may stay here or at a hotel in London if you can't bear to be away for any longer."
"Sian," she wheezed as John seemingly fiddled around her nethers. "I'm calling her Sian. S-i-a-n."
"Because," John replied, making sure his hair was properly laying down, "you had no idea whether or not I was going to give it to you."
"It's kind of what I do for a living." Another shared snicker surfaced at that, breaking the thin sheen of ice that had formed.
Truthfully, Sherlock had to gather his own self. Lestrade helped him write down and memorize what he was going to say, using as many scientific descriptions as possible in order to help him center himself. He was never more focused as when he was describing something scientifically. It was perfect, everything painstakingly created down to the smallest detail. John would of course say 'yes', and they would live in their own personalized happily ever after. So why was he so bloody
"Truthfully? Actually it's... whatever turns you on the most."
'Luckily' Sherlock had decided to handle that bit for him when he sailed into the sitting room, John's olive drab counterpane, which was draped around him only over one shoulder as if he were some sort of Roman consulate member, billowing behind him. The mussed curls didn't at all counter the visual as he only needed a laurel-leaf crown to complete the picture. John had to lean his elbows on his thighs and put his head down in order to somehow rub some sense into it with his hands. Sherlock tossed John's mobile in a manner that had it land perfectly to his right before seating himself next to him on the other side, much as he had in Buckingham palace that other time, only much closer, the majority of their thighs touching. John didn't look up until after Sherlock spoke once more.
"Are we genuinely...," Sherlock tried. "I mean I know I feel... and we said we..." Sherlock exhaled such a frustrated growl and grabbed two handfuls of his own hair, stomping over to sit down hard on the sofa. All at once, it dawned on John. Since they'd made it actually official, neither one of them had used the most important word that described what this was, and Sherlock was suffering with his own anxiety John could have kicked himself for not seeing more clearly. He was too busy with his own doubts when it all was right there in front of him. He gentled Sherlock's hands out of his hair with a fond sigh and gave his rather tender scalp a little rub as he sat next to him, then pulled him close so they could wrap their arms around each other.
The only person he had left.
No streetlamps and no warm lights from scattered farm houses in the vicinity probably meant little to no phone coverage. Sherlock pulled the vehicle over(an all wheel drive SUV, thank God for small miracles)as John checked his phone for the tenth time in the short span of time it took for Sherlock's phone battery, the phone with the Sat Nav they were relying on, to give out. He himself hadn't had any bars since, roughly, the first hour outside of the London area. He really needed an upgrade, especially now that they had a more than comfortable income.
bled for me and the fact that you did it sometimes just to help satisfy a curiosity at a random time around the flat isn't any less important than doing it as a result of injuries sustained in helping me. Molly repeatedly risked life as she knew it and it was no less a sacrifice than being physically out in the field."
"Yes that."
"Guess he didn't really think it urgent," John stated, only half joking and handing him a steaming cup of tea.
"I think that was a new record, Babe." They shared a chuckle and a hand squeeze until, at the same moment, they stopped in their tracks. They simultaneously turned to face the predictably shocked faces. Well, some were shocked. Others had rather smug, knowing little smiles affixed.
"My sister had one of those births. You did better with some towels and a kitchen knife than the hospital doctors fully equipped did."
They kissed until their mouths ached, then still just rested them against each other as they lay side by side, breathing with with their eyes closed, well on their way to sleep. Except that Sherlock began humming a melody. It didn't exactly keep John up, but he was curious and told himself to attempt to remember to ask him about it in the morning.
"Come." Sherlock held out his hand and John put the dove in it with a cheeky smirk he wanted more than anything to snog off of his face. But he had something much more important to do than dole out punishment. He did glare at John, his heart not actually in it, then frowned at the dove, examining it and releasing it after he and the bird had blinked at each other for a full minute. John finally put his hand in his(he couldn't ever help noting perfection of fit) and Sherlock lead him inside. They washed their hands on the way to the bedroom.
What did he think? Where should he begin? How outlandish John looked? How he resembled some common chat-up artist(that did extremely well)? How the way John said his name usually made something tickle in the pit of his belly no matter the situation or tone, but this particular pronunciation revealed exactly what that something was?
"Okay. So you're not jealous, but you're suddenly coming with me to the bar now that she's in the room."
"Why are you content to touch me when we're around other people but not by ourselves?" John had to ask.
"Renders me immediately and nearly irrevocably aroused. Prolonged manipulation can actually cause me to become incoherent, even orgasm with little to no penile stimulation. Thinking back, it seems to have signaled the very first of my pubescent hormonal changes. At thirteen, forced to the shops with my mother, we ran into an old baby-sitter who had some sort of fascination with mussing my hair and tickling me when I was small. I wasn't paying attention to the idle small talk, as I was trying to figure out why I'd suddenly found her attractive. I supposed I did when I was little as well, as I didn't give her nearly as much trouble as I did the other ones." John just listened, flabbergasted. Sherlock would often talk, but not about this subject. He had to keep this going for as long as possible. There was no telling when or if he'd get another chance.
"I tried to tell you," he said innocently. "But you've seen fit not to listen and wed me anyway.
"Oh." They stared at each other for a moment. "It will be difficult."
"I'm... important to you." It was less a question and more as if he was trying it out.
His eyes popped open with only swatches of memory. Even those few hazy thoughts were enough to get him from filling to fully erect before he could figure out he needed the toilet. It was the only unfortunate thing he could think of, besides his breath and discovering he was alone in the massive bed with dried come in his pants and on his abdomen. He would have been a bit grossed out if it wasn't a reminder of whatever happened between them the night before.
He returned after Sherlock had quickly used the facilities, balancing a tray, loaded with two cups of tea, a bottle of water and his portion of painkillers, antibiotics, and what he supposed were vitamin supplements. He took them all and showed John his mouth and hands out of routine. When he was a child, when he was in rehab, he always had to prove he'd swallowed them and not stashed them for binning then, later, for currency or later use. Except for the vitamins. As some sort of amusement, John had gotten ones that were similar to Haribo gummy bears to replace the large pills he usually took. He glared at his partner in everything now as he chewed two of them, having a hard time maintaining it when John smiled at him all... happy like that. Fortunately he turned his attention back to the bath just as Sherlock's resolve broke and he smiled in return.
Now it was as if he were a young teen-ager, still growing into his own skin, unsure of every word or gesture. It was exhausting, because John behaved gingerly around him, but, when he moved the television in better view of the sofa, he served them the drink before just tucking himself up under Sherlock's left arm and employing the remote. Sherlock didn't even think about it when he lightly caressed John's fringe with his fingertips and planted random kisses in his hair. The first couple of times it happened, John stiffened almost imperceptibly, but almost immediately relaxed again. He was fed bits of fruit and crisps and was nearly distracted completely when John decided to work on a lolli. At the end of the episode, which he actually didn't figure out until halfway through instead of in the first ten minutes(granted...
What happens in the back seat, stays in the back seat.
"What do you need, Sherlock?" It annoyed him to no end that even the expecting-to-be-irritated way John pronounced his bloody name with his smooth, soft voice was so lovely to him. He realized he was staring when John raised his eyebrows at him and made up for his initial immobility by promptly barging in, complaining about and explaining how John needed to watch the DVD for an experiment. "Stir this," he commanded, shoving the bowl into Sherlock's arm, plucking the sheer plastic case containing the disc from his fingers and looking at its blank face. "What is it?"
"And I don't know that you'd be able to be patient enough for me to welcome you back into my life when I was ready if we got together for real and then parted. I don't know that I'd survive it."
"And?" The funniest bit was that he genuinely didn't see the problem, nor did he care to explain without being asked. John could only laugh, kiss him, and force a croissant spread heavily with strawberry preserves into his gullet, as well as pretend not to notice when bites of sausage, bacon, or egg he left on the fork as he did a quick email check went missing from his plate.
"I'm not having an aneurysm."
"I... um... I can if you like. I should just... erm put this whisky away." Why was he bringing it up to his room? He put a pin in the question and pushed it aside, for a spark of hope had bloomed in his chest. It was ridiculous. He fiddled with the pea green wallpaper helplessly. It would have been fine if John wasn't so abominably adorable. The drug must have still had a tentative hold on him.
"You have to tell me," he almost begged. "Or I won't be able to." John could say little else but his name as Sherlock swallowed his tumescence with an eager mouth. John could reach nothing but his arms and head, Sherlock's own throbbing erection kept out of his legs' range of motion though he could feel the whisper of Sherlock's leakage on them. "I want you to take me," he panted, kissing back up to John's mouth after bringing him to the brink several times in a short span.
"You have," he agreed. John looked off to the left as he did when he was thinking hard about what to say next. Those glorious eyes came back to rest on Sherlock's. "I'm sorry," he said.
"How do
, encouraged
"More closely," she repeated, and John knew she'd remember from now on. Mycroft lifted her fluidly, taking in her every feature and no doubt comparing them to Sherlock's and his own. The hair was similar but a bit lighter with John's blond input. She had Sherlock's alabaster skin and she was lean and rather tall for a girl of three and a half. The almost cartoonishly sharp cheekbones of her other sire were hidden under the baby fat, but John took comfort in his contribution of her eyes, which were rather round and a cobalt blue. They were all John. They'd at first rolled their eyes and had a great laugh at Mary being teased in the lesser read gossip columns about just being a surrogate for Sherlock's and his laboratory-created gay baby. Strange how it turned out that was the most accurate assessment of the situation. Though John still didn't identify himself as gay. It was just Sherlock. He seemed to bust through every single wall, permeate every aspect of his being. And he made John not only like it, but
"You left so quickly this morning that you neither had breakfast nor packed a lunch. That deli you like isn't open on Saturdays for religious purposes and I hadn't time to have something delivered to you as, just after you left, everything with Mycroft's thing went completely mad and I had to leave immediately whilst focusing on that and wasn't allowed to use my phone or the phone I was given to use to contact anyone not involved. I knew you'd be home early anyways and that you'd opt to just wait until you got in to have something. So I did a curry."
you. The work will always come first. We always get into these life or death situations and that's brilliant on almost every level, but I also never wanted to get... involved for those same reasons." John finally looked up at him. "But, I couldn't help it and now I'm stuck. It doesn't mean I have to make it worse by wanting... It's fine like this. We're fine. We're," he sighed, "all fine."
"Resorting to ego strokes now, are we?"
"You've been eating the tinned pineapples meant for Mrs. Hudson's cake," Sherlock blurted with a sigh and a low groan. John didn't stop, but he did prop the side of his head on his right palm in order to look down at Sherlock with a lazily puzzled expression. Sherlock knew he wanted more information but he'd be damned if he was going to just give it up so easily. He was still Sherlock Holmes. Instead, he reached into the beside table closest to him and extracted a bottle of lubricant filled to approximately the half-way mark. He applied it to the proper area and settled back to enjoy John touching him where, less than twenty-four hours before, he was only imagining it as he did it himself. That thought caused him to promptly open his eyes to confirm he wasn't still fantasizing it, and was satisfied enough to shut them again after seeing John was still there.
"Sentiment? Well, if a toddler can understand how you feel-"
"You'll do," came the trite response, though the eyes shone.
"That's not what you wanted to ask me."
"Of course I did! I've tried everything and apparently it just has to... run its course or whatever."
"Yes."
"Who wouldn't, in that tight little hole?" John swiped at some fluid on Sherlock's bared chest that he'd missed, and, adding it to his own saliva, applied it to the point of entry. "Need to keep you nice and wet down there. Wouldn't want you to chafe. You'll be sore enough as it is."
"It'll sort itself," John said truthfully. "It apparently always does."
"Really? I usually see those now." Sherlock re-positioned John so that they'd switched places before they casually began unzipping and unclasping their trousers.
"Alright?"
"Did you want a divorce?"
"Fine."
He sighed deeply, "Alright a little, but I haven't many friends and I demand all of their attention."
"I am kind of disappointed that our first mutual orgasm was when we were asleep."
"Not any more ridiculous than saying you hurt me for no reason."
"I have," John confirmed, as if trying to be patient with a child in trouble and began undoing Sherlock's shirt buttons from the bottom until his tautly muscled torso was bared, the surprisingly auburn hairs curling thinly in a vague 't'-shape. He ran deft doctor's fingers over them, avoiding Sherlock's nipples, which were already hardened with the aforementioned eagerness. With a chaste kiss to his high, pale forehead, John began the punishment in earnest.
limp and sense of impending doom. All after maybe ten minutes altogether in two days in the man's rather dramatic presence. John had let him use his phone and the rest, as they say, was history.
"Really? What branch?" John queried, trying his best not to see what Sherlock was doing behind him after plucking his gun from his hands and putting it back in its spot in secret.
"It's only the Rolls Royce of tea kettles. There are temperature controls, a keep warm setting, a
Sherlock Holmes had engaged in sex on numerous occasions before his temple's re-dedication to The Work. He knew the mechanics of it, the chemistry involved. He knew what love was on a scientific, familial, and platonic level. He understood many more pop references than he let on simply because it was fun to watch people think they were teaching him something. There was a theory about when love set into a relationship, though technically it was more of a habit, an addiction of sorts where one's brain reacted positively with every dose, despite whether or not it was healthy. Wanting to have sex with his attractive, kind, slightly dangerous flatmate despite the platonic status of their relationship and John's oft-declared heterosexuality, was healthy. The nearly overwhelming urge to spend the rest of his existence physically, mentally, and legally attached to only him was not, as far as Sherlock was concerned. He hadn't any idea what prompted any of it, but perhaps admitting it in a ridiculous manner would take the wind out of his sails, so to speak.
," he began after clearing his throat. "Known more commonly as 'white Foxglove'. It was used, originally, as a natural defibrillator of sorts as well as in the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure. I thought I was overdosed. That would have explained the head aches and mysterious loss of appetite, the... disruptions in rhythm." One hand went to his heart of its own free will, before he retook control of it and moved it back to the box. "But all of that went away, the confusion, the depression, everything, when I was finally able to admit to myself, that I loved you. Used improperly, a bit like love, it can stop the heart or cause suffocation. There are very few people who are able to properly handle it. The lethal dose and the therapeutic one are so close, that it's too dangerous for natural general use. And, somehow, you are the only one who knows the exact amount conducive to my body chemistry." He ran his eyes over the looping physical evidence of his love for this man for an unexpected extra jolt of confidence before bringing them resolutely back to John's, where he found the rest. "I still experience the edema and tachycardia, briefly, whenever I know you're close, whether or not I can see you, but not the head aches. Nor do I feel the low appetite. In fact, my hunger for you knows no bounds. I want to devour you until I'm ill and then have some more. I apologise for not having any evidence of that last bit, but I digress." He flipped open the top of the case, revealing the sturdy platinum band, matte-finished so as not to gleam and give away their position when undercover. A center channel housed a row of black diamonds, just above a concealed line where the bottom half could be separated to be reattached during the nuptial exchange. "I'm tempted to ask if it's enough. But then, I would always be disappointed with the answer. Because it isn't enough, nor will it ever be enough for you. So I'll simply beg of you. Will you please be my husband?"
"Nothing really has," Sherlock said, flippantly tossing out hard truths as if merely mentioning the sky was blue.
"Like what?"
"Good morning, Daddy."
Sherlock was a terror at the disco, though fortunately, a private one. He had to be bribed with a human body part to take the requisite photo and refused to dance or let John dance with anyone else. He still accepted John's tender touches and kisses, but didn't really return them. He only let John out of his sight to bring them more drinks and nibbles, or the one time he needed the loo. John drew the line at going in with him, at which Sherlock scoffed and poked his lip out further before going in alone. As he waited, John perused the memorabilia mural, which was a collage of dozens of photos, including copies of original prom photos, patches, and on the tables in front of it various trophies and knick-knacks from their era.
"You won't," he promised, eyeing the pillow on his lap. Oh shit.
"Yes, well, the outer edges of my pectorals going up into the, erm, arm pit, yes."
Sherlock had been too embarrassed for hospital and had John convince the EMTs that he would look after him properly at home, even though he refused even him access once they'd arrived. He somehow convinced John to go fill out the paperwork at the police station after making sure everything checked out as alright as it was going to get for the time being according to the instructions John patiently called through the door of his bedroom. What Sherlock had completely forgotten about, so wrapped up was he in his own problems, was the fact that, not only would he lose hours from the real world in his mind palace and experiments, but the sincere compassion of his doctor was retained at almost all times. Hence the soft knock and voice that sent his whole body throbbing in its wake.
"And when it's not?"
"You still don't understand, you daft... Look," he heaved himself up onto the side of the tub that was flush with the corner of the wall, thinking again before draping a flannel across his overwhelming erection in order to lower what seemed like a grand distraction. The way Sherlock was looking at it and licking his lips..., "If we... if we consciously did this, if we went this far without the excuse of exhaustion or alcohol, I don't think I would ever be able to stop. When this is all over, I mean."
"Yes, sir."
"I'll be the same amount of comfortable either way," he said truthfully. It didn't exactly fill Sherlock with confidence but he went with it, unable to walk properly with what was going on in his trousers at the prospect. His greatest comfort at the moment was John's matching state.
"It's just... I can't help but feel that I've taken advantage of you somehow."
"John," she begged loudly between contractions, "Tell me!"
who this is. We all do. Everyone follows your blog. It's almost like we know you, Sherlock Holmes. Where did you attend secondary?"
is try," Sherlock said finally, leaning his forehead against John's, then, still holding his face in his hands, looking as deeply into his eyes as possible so he would be properly heard. "I've wanted this... wanted you for longer than I was even aware. The injection was just the catalyst. I've said it before. It's always been you, John." Sherlock leaned in for another lovely kiss.
"Only because he fears he has... hurt you."
"It would be fun, though."
is Greg!" Suddenly a tiny authoritative voice sounded above the din.
"You don't have to know everything all the time." A keen look had John rolling his eyes. "Okay maybe
He bolted awake, alone in his bed and annoyed somewhere in the back of his mind at the slight relief of having nightmares about something other than his time in the war for a change. Mostly he was on high alert. Someone was banging on the door of his extremely secluded cabin, sat on an island off the coast of Scotland, on which he and his little daughter were the only human residents.
He awoke feeling a bit crusty, but all in all well-rested, though too comfortable to move. His nose was buried in John's hair and the man himself was fast asleep. He pressed his lips to his forehead several times and actually
then retrace the three steps he took.
"I'd like a copy of that as soon as possible."
him. Which surprised him. He assumed there'd be stronger feelings(ugh)but for some reason never included the fact that just kissing John would be enough sometimes. He couldn't understand how he left that out of his calculations as John's absent touches were normally soothing when Sherlock wasn't in the midst of a hormonal crisis. However, he justified it quickly. Since he'd already planned to do this, he figured he could move up the date if the opportunity arose. John had mentioned earlier that he had a pub thing that night and would be gone for quite a while after changing clothes and a shower, hoping to at least catch the attention of a few of the women there even if he wasn't actually ready to be with one again after the whole Mary debacle. But, after helping Mrs. Hudson, he didn't much feel like going anywhere but up to his own flat and, eventually, his own bed.
"John, how is it a punishment to give me the public sex you've been aware I've so desperately been wanting?" he asked in that endearingly little shit way he had.
"I'll ruin
"John," he corrected him, his words muffled by his hands. John then looked up into his face and it was lined with concern in such a way as he had never seen. "We're practically family now." Mycroft gave a curt nod of agreement.
"They think we're a couple anyway," Sherlock replied, focused on his screen, hopefully going through the suggested refrigerated units. He probably wasn't, though.
"Sometimes the information is compromised," he admitted, frowning. John propped himself up on his elbows then reached a hand up to smooth his thumb over the creases in between Sherlock's eyes. The action earned him first a puzzled, then an insanely affectionate look.
"You mean what you're blessed with."
"Yes?" he answered his hand, then glanced up at him long enough for his eyes to be captured. His... smoldering eyes, nearly all grey in the current light.
"Promise," John urged.
"What? Uh, no. Not that I recall."
"Screamed like a banshee for a full ten seconds then punched me right in the face."
He heard John's footsteps on the stairs and his entrance through the kitchen door, forcing himself to stay perfectly still with his eyes closed. He even heard his sigh of what must have been relief at not seeing him yet. Lestrade came out of the bathroom and the two mates exchanged words about the samples he'd brought up at Mrs. Hudson's request as well as the circumstances of their escape from beneath her velvet whip. John's voice sounded terribly sad beneath the forced positivity and it made Sherlock angrier that it affected him so much. Lestrade said nothing about his presence yet until John bloody
The longer John thought about it, the more he began doubting everything. He knew he was pretty much a gentleman no matter the level of sobriety he encountered. He also had been complicit in role play in which he wasn't to behave so gentlemanly. It was basically about respect and care. However, there was such an animalistic quality to the few memories he had of the night before. While Sherlock seemed a willing, even eager participant, he couldn't help but think of his own fumbling advances. He couldn't have been very gentle, as his desires finally getting the best of him was overwhelming. However, he remembered seeing no scratches, love bites, or other bruising when Sherlock was mostly nude that morning, and felt guilty that even just that picture of him standing in sunlight in snug black boxer briefs stirred him a bit.
It was natural to wonder what it would be like to have sex with another person. Not that Sherlock had no experience. No, a fumbling encounter at sixteen, subsequent more successful encounters when he followed Mycroft's stupid advice about making them want him after his heart was broken that first time, a few years later, a drug-induced lifestyle, and an overall scientific curiosity took care of that particular physical state in almost all of its forms. Sex also factored heavily in many crimes, especially murders, and thinking about it didn't mean you actually wanted to do it.
John pressed the round red 'end call' button on his mobile screen and lay it down on the little tea table next to his chair as he stared across at his husband of five years as of that past May, who was nervously playing with his lush bottom lip. He stood to look at their collection of romantic memorabilia. There was the prom photo and, on the other side of his antique pistol, a copy of their wedding invite, '
"John. That was rather poetic. Going by your past musings, I didn't think you had it in you."
"I do now," John admitted, voice thick with unspent tears. "But I was afraid. I couldn't risk the baby," A small sob that sounded almost like a laugh escaped him. "Or Mrs. Hudson, or Mycroft. So you see how none of it was you. You're not to blame for any of it because I'd just been given the only reason I had left to live. Until now." He was at last silent for an entire minute.
"But what exactly
"Darling," Sherlock said, voice perking up suspiciously, "who's your... friend?"
"People are tempted to believe romantic love more when it's associated with physical evidence."
"Whatever happens, don't you dare stop," Sherlock commanded in a moan. His tone had John wishing with all his might that he had unlimited stamina, because the only thing he could think of was-
"A list of private tutors with thorough background checks and all of their relevant information for me to choose from." It wasn't a verbal protest, just a minuscule nudge of John's left thigh. "Sorry. Used to making all of the decisions. Of course they'll go through Sherlock and I
"I was wearing them the day you came back," he blurted, immediately sorry at Sherlock's out of place expression of abject humility. Sherlock had repeatedly apologised, citing he would do it as often as it took for John to forgive him. But John already had forgiven him, again having the urge to hug him just then, but couldn't, because of the moment at hand. He had to break the tension a bit. "Besides, bulls are actually colour blind."
"Oh leave me be." Sherlock turned onto his right side away from the teasing kisses and words.
"I was always extremely selective," he conceded. Always used condoms, my own needles, if they were required. Always had a home made miniature test kit with me. Drugs addicts aren't exactly the most reliable people." John couldn't control his shock, barely reigning in his horror at what he was being told. He was concerned his friend wouldn't confide in him again if he had any extreme reaction. Sherlock was still talking, however, seemingly oblivious to John's inner turmoil. He must have been fine with the way the conversation was going, but then again, John was hard pressed to dismiss the possibility that Sherlock knew exactly what he was thinking, and was just content with the response. Why did everything have to be so complicated? With all of these words, Sherlock hadn't even answered the question yet. This was the most personal information John had ever gotten out of his flat mate and it made his sentimental heart throb.
." His tone was dour but the look Sherlock gave him was heartbreaking. "It just shouldn't have been like that," he repeated. "I should have taken you with me."
"Mister nothing but a sheet to visit
"Yes! Fine! Tea would be lovely!" Anything to get him gone for five minutes. John's footsteps were light, as if he was just happy to be of service. Which he usually was. The service Sherlock required, however, John wouldn't be willing to provide as it was inherently homosexual and John repeatedly shouted his hetero status, sometimes literally. Sherlock had just gotten his mind to at least stop thinking about him by reciting the digits of Pi, but John knocked and entered, shattering everything else. It was worse than he thought.
"Yes. All the danger has been... neutralized."
"Think anyone's watching that monitor, Sherlock? Think they would have the balls to come in here and interrupt if they were?" The only answer was Sherlock's moans, increasing in volume and frequency. "All the noise you're making," John panted, "the way you look when all you can do is take it and enjoy yourself," John was sweating profusely himself now. "The guard probably wouldn't be able to help wanking himself into oblivion, no matter his preference." Sherlock was well and truly shouting by now, John having to talk over him. There was no indication whatsoever that he wanted to stop, or was even the least bit uncomfortable, even though he was being repeatedly crushed against metal at an awkward angle. "Only you, Sherlock," John began chanting in time with his movements as they sped up. "Only you could make me do this. No one else. It's always been only you."
"If Mary's past caught up with her, then you had no reason to be able to trust that Mycroft could protect you and our child," he murmured, staying perfectly still, hands stuffed into his pockets then stepping much closer. John confirmed his words with a nod. "He would have, you know?"
He stretched as he smiled, waking up enough to notice the wet wipes, water, and breath drops on his bedside table. Yet another demonstration of Sherlock's sweetness, however feigned, served him well in getting him motivated enough to try for the bathroom. But for a bit of a heavy feeling in his limbs, there was no hangover for him to speak of, despite over-doing it. He returned to the gorgeous scene of Sherlock in just his underwear, uncovering things on a massive trolley that reminded him of the energy spent in pleasuring each other the night before.
"Sherlock," he warned. Sherlock was quiet a moment longer, searching John's face, then sighed and pulled him aside. "What is it really?" He tried again. "You've been off ever since you told me we didn't really..." Sherlock opened and closed his mouth as he did whenever he attempted to discuss anything sentiment-related. John took pity, as usual. He took a lanky, yet muscular arm and leaned in to make sure he was heard. "Do you think I didn't want you?" Sherlock confirmed by closing his mouth once more and keeping it that way as he looked off to the side, hands somehow shoved in the pockets of his rather closely fitting trousers. If John could see clearly under the whirling coloured lights, he would have known for sure that Sherlock was blushing instead of just speculating. For now, he just pictured it, as it was a rare and sweet image. "Sherlock, to be honest I have never been so turned on. Especially by a bloke."
"I want to see you," he whispered.
It had taken two rounds with himself to get over that.
Sherlock looked annoyed but John caught the last minute blush. His own face, however, was on fire.
"For what?"
It was as if a powerful magnet was activated by his touch. John remained unsuspicious until the the last moment, even straining his face up a bit and looking away so Sherlock could wipe the smudge off properly. As if this was something just done with them, like Sherlock following him into the bathroom.  Sherlock's rubbing at the spot with his thumb was basically just for show as the applied kiss, with a hint of tongue actually cleaned it. John's eyes went wide as he continued to look toward the wall, but he didn't pull away or push him back or otherwise reject him yet. Only whispered half of his name in surprise as he moved a kiss to the left corner of his mouth, then John's eyes slipped closed. That was his cue.
"No. I'm hoping. I'm hoping that you'll keep your word, because I can't imagine I'll be in a fit psychological state to stand trial for what I may do if they're threatened." John's eyes narrowed of their own accord.
"Did you really want to be a pirate when you were a kid? Because you've got the Captain Jack Sparrow thing down, just now."
started to move steadily, in a slow circle after attempting several different angles to find which one made Sherlock the least verbally understandable, Sherlock couldn't keep his eyes open, no matter how much he'd wanted to watch. John had, through just a steady stream of rather innocuous words, whipped him up into a frenzy. He felt as if he were literally on fire, desperate to be quenched and the act happening so slowly he just knew he'd be consumed before it had any real effect other than building the flame. He wasn't particularly loud during sex, but nothing was ever the way it was before when John Watson got a hold of not only your mind, but your body. Sherlock could hardly breathe for the loud, gutteral sounds John was yanking out of him. He was methodical, touching and tweaking and squeezing when the mood took him, but making sure that whatever he did, it was done thoroughly. His marvelous, gorgeous, reliable, steadfast doctor!
"She's advanced," Sherlock argued, drawing John in front of him then between his knees by the wrist, then seeming not to know what to do with him, so he settled for fingering John's dressing gown sleeve. The fact that Sherlock's knees were bare when he opened his legs to admit him was not lost on this new John, the one allowed to ogle openly. John reflexively began to card through inky curls, still slightly damp.
"People have been known to do the silliest things in the name of sentiment. We deal with it all the time."
"What did you expect us to do? Sherlock I... Of course I still..." Oh God not the tears. John cleared his throat and tried again. "You almost took me with you. I almost died with you. I almost.... to be with you I nearly..." Sherlock pushed himself between John's thighs and slid his arms around his waist, resting his head just above his right pectoral. John held on tightly, willing the tears back down as they ached in his throat. "If I didn't still care, I wouldn't have been so angry. You just needed to be patient with me, which, truth be told, isn't your strong suit."
"Then call it a plan. A well thought out plan. With charts. And-and stimuli." Then John laughed and it was miraculous and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to grab him tightly and kiss him until suddenly the kitchen became the bedroom. But John still hadn't actually said 'Yes'. He had to agree out loud. John blinked up at him until he was certain he'd have to either kiss him anyway or flee the flat. Mercifully, John looked away, though the thoughtful expression didn't much help with the wanting to kiss him bit.
"Return?" Did he not actually know? How could he
"I... Something else happened. Something that you're not telling me."
Yes, I did do the research required to know that the particular kettle I chose is actually shit, but I was going for price, looks and fancy doodads more than anything else. The brand name was a happy coincidence.
As much as he seemed eager to get him alone, Sherlock only stood stiffly, watching him a moment before traversing to the window around the side of the massive four poster bed that had to have been in the family for centuries.
"I'm glad no one could tell it was you underneath all of that, because
"Snippy," he warned, cocking his head like the little raptor he was.
"Do you understand what's happening?" John had always explained everything as simply as he could to her, no matter how uncomfortable the topic. In turn he had a virtually fearless yet somehow extremely empathetic child.
John slowly kissed his way back up his body, taking as much time as possible to cover as much of his skin as possible. Between the things he did orally to him and the preparation going on almost without his knowledge, it made it so Sherlock thought he'd never be without an erection in John's presence again. They locked eyes, John cradling the back of his head with his non-dominant right hand, holding his own thick cock  with the other so he could sink slowly into his consulting detective, a combination of suddenly appearing and natural lubrication easing the way nicely. John's expression... he'd never seen anything so beautiful as John Watson enjoying his body. He was still a moment when he was fully seated and seeming to... revel... in the sensation. Sherlock begged his hands release so he could touch back.
"You have ten seconds to get those clothes off or there will be consequences." John was already half stripped.
"What about me?"
"Sorry," John confirmed, before turning to catch up with a little jog.
John retrieved the sample (again without revealing to Mrs. Hudson what it was) and quietly opened the front door, finding the hall predictably empty. He snuck back up to the flat, quickly locking both doors and putting the foot in its original place before going to his chair and laptop. He was able to email three links of what he thought were well-priced refrigerated units before he heard Sherlock's key scraping in the lock of the kitchen door. He remained still as Sherlock did a wild check that the specimen was still viable, sighing in relief that it was. John would never have really compromised something so important as to warrant such a prominent human body part, but he was still going to insist on the separate fridge.
"Well, I knew
"Nope."
that? Unless he was doing as he always did, consciously or no, which was to not acknowledge potentially embarrassing details, such as getting a hard on whilst grappling with your flatmate. He must have attributed it to the activity. Men got erections all the time in high-adrenaline situations.
"We're just going to leave the cord attached until the placenta's delivered or the ambulance arrives, whichever comes first, alright?"
"Like what?" The conversation distracted him enough for Sherlock to be able to look his fill as John stepped carefully into the water and settled in his lap and back against him with a flinch that he nearly physically felt himself.
It seemed a test, seeing how long they could keep their hands off of each other. Their present record was four minutes. It took eight to order the takeaway because, halfway in, Sherlock began experimenting on John's hands, taking his meticulously cleaned and trimmed digits between lips he was often told were reminiscent of Cupid's bow, tonging the callous on his trigger finger and moaning helplessly in his softest tone at the raw power possessed therein.
The next kiss put him on his back, pulling Sherlock as close as possible. The grinding returned, frustratingly non-rhythmic, but loads better than nothing. Sherlock was praising him and he cursed the fact that he was too drunk to make out completely what was being said. Something about his being brilliant to come up with a proposal speech to feed their cloyingly romantic engagement story. Which is of course what he was doing.
"You should have a closer look," Sherlock mentioned softly, having gotten even closer and a bit behind John to his right as John sat up straight. Sherlock placed his left hand gently on John's left shoulder, smoothing over the ridges of his strangely as yet un-commented upon bullet wound scar under the cloth with reverent fingers. The ex Army captain lifted the main item deferentially from among the accompanying cleaning and configuring apparatus and turned it over in his hands once before aiming it toward the fireplace and then the window closest to the sofa.
"You can always get
"No more than anyone would be hurt in the situation without having any information." John approached him very slowly, cautiously.
"Probably about a week. We'll need to wrap up this case and-"
"Probably. Though you can't discount that sometimes the useless facts end up being extremely important to a case."
weaknesses-"
"You lads will be the death of me," she complained, accepting John's hurried cheek peck before making her way into position.
"Sorry. I'm sorry," John pressed him back to his former position, trying to stifle his pleased laughter. "It's just so..." Sherlock gave him a sharp look. "Sorry." He pushed back the tousled curls and kissed Sherlock's forehead. "Forgive me?" He then kissed each of Sherlock's eyes.
"Usually, yeah. But I wasn't expecting this so forgive me for not having one for you." John swore he saw the gears in his head turning through those cat-like eyes.
"I... sorry, Sherlock. Maybe I shouldn't have started-"
"Sorry... I suppose. Carry on."
"Thank you. I do need a rest. I'm starting to ache already and I know you're probably sore, too. Though, from other things" John playfully shoved him off and sat up, looking around the room for his lost buttons as Sherlock pouted harder than he actually felt at his defeat. John plucked two buttons from the bed then got out of it to find another.
"Nothing," John fibbed, standing up and looking around for his dressing gown with his hands on his hips. It wasn't where it had been tossed the night before. He then thought of the fact that he didn't really know where that was as he was otherwise occupied at the time.
"Good afternoon, Uncle Mycroft. My name is Willa Watson-Holmes, but Daddy calls me Honeybee. I'm glad to meet you." Mycroft's widened eyes were the icing on the cake. He raised his eyebrows to hide it and John witnessed the mask of decorum slip back into place before he took the child's little hand in his for a firm shake.
Margie could only repeat, "Oh John! My baby! My beautiful baby! Thank you! Thank you so much!" She was turned over once again and Sherlock, just staring at the entire scenario, automatically slid down onto the floor behind her as she clutched the calming infant. There was applause in the makeshift cubicle which spread and went from being interspersed with relieved gasps at the healthy squall to thunderous when Jessica went out to announce all was well.
"But-"
"Fine." John walked the few steps over to his side and leaned down to kiss his temple.
"Really? Don't think that just because I'm not as skilled as you are, that I don't notice things, especially when it comes to you."
Supper was a lively affair during which everything else was discussed. There were apparently many family events planned now that they were finally there and properly together. Even Sherlock and Mycroft's snide remarks were fewer in the presence of the new addition. Sherlock kept at least a finger, or the side of his shoe in contact with John at all times. Nothing so blatant as putting his arm around or kissing him in front of everyone as when they first reunited, but it was noticed all the same, by everyone, who tactfully remained silent about it.
"Why do you insist on asking stupid questions?"
"Not exactly."
"I... can I ask you something without you getting all snippy?"
"I'm not used to it, John! Being real I mean. I mean I just..."
"Well it was nice, anyway," he commented, squeezing Sherlock's upper thigh where his hand had been resting before offering to fetch them each a glass of wine, since the servers were otherwise occupied preparing to bring out the meal.
"Well... yeah. I mean the spontaneity was good and it was really sweet, but in a ... school yard game sort of way. It was innocent. There was no... promise... of something deeper."
"No," Sherlock said finally, a bit annoyed that John didn't realize that he'd never put him in actual danger in their own home. It was a sanctuary of sorts, despite the many crimes which took place there. Some of them, Sherlock wasn't even responsible for.
"Uh... no. I haven't used it."
"Don't you dare," he whispered into Sherlock's mouth, as they were once again kissing passionately. "Don't you dare die on me again."
"I know," Sherlock whispered into his mouth. "Me, too." He suddenly stepped back, cleared his throat and straightened his suit jacket. John took his cue and reigned everything in as much as he could. It was difficult, to say the least. It helped that Mycroft and Greg were looking around almost uncomfortably with strange, tiny smiles on their faces. John then grabbed the detective inspector in a bear hug, apologising profusely, Greg saying that of course he understood, he just wished people would talk to him before disappearing. John swore that it would never again happen if he could help it and they squeezed then released each other.
Speaking of those strange things inherent to Sherlock, he was examining Willa closely as the child chattered happily. She allowed her father to look at her hands and facial features without interrupting her speech. John would exchange little smiles with Greg and the entire scene was almost domestic. Almost because of the underlying tension of unanswered questions such as, how long they were staying, what would happen when they got back to Baker Street, where Willa and John would sleep for sure once they did. He wasn't going to assume he would be with Sherlock and Willa would have his old room for her own. True, she'd graduated to her own little toddler bed but she'd still climb into his most mornings if there was time for extra sleep to be had. John's nightmares only came if he was alone in bed now.
"Like, 'yes of course I'll marry you'?" John's hands, which had been on his hips as he'd done as much as he could without the hot water, dropped to his sides with an exasperated sigh.
"She wishes that baby was yours," Sherlock said from nowhere, now scrolling through his own emails.
exceeded even his expectations constantly.
"Got them off you as you were trying to get back here," John explained in that low, unpredictable voice he knew never failed to get Sherlock's attention. "I really do like your eagerness, I do. But there's such a thing as overdoing it and I've warned you against that in the past, haven't I?" John thought it safe to restart the car so that they wouldn't freeze.
It had been rather Spartan compared to the rest of the flat, but now that all of his scientific equipment was in there as well as a fridge and an extra desk, it was full to the brim with Sherlock's very essence, and, he noticed, some of him too. The bed remained freshly made, and a quick search of the desk revealed the items he knew he'd need. He then made sure the doors to the loo remained open as he started the shower and, as predicted, Sherlock called to him from inside the room as he stood under the warm spray. He only poked his hand out from the curtain in response and smiled as it was grasped after a moment of what sounded like fumbling.
John could of course more than hold his own, but Sherlock had the benefit of studying martial arts and self-defence techniques they didn't teach in the Army. If it was a basic street brawl, the consulting detective knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that John would win. The compact captain could be brutal if given half a chance, hence Sherlock knowing that John had actually been holding back every time he'd punched him in the beginning. Sherlock took this opportunity to incorporate some of John's moves into his own repertoire and impart knowledge on how John could improve some of his moves. 'So that the young bucks wouldn't be able to throw him around quite as much'. This unintentional slight actually motivated John to take him down hard using his own move against him. This was going to bruise nicely, but Sherlock couldn't bring himself to care as John sat up on top of him to cheer himself, arms in the air, chest out, sliver of belly showing as well as miles of creamy leg.
"I'm not frightened," he said, holding his gaze. Sherlock raised his eyebrows knowingly. "Okay a bit," he corrected himself. "It's just that... where did this all come from?" A realization seemed to dawn on him then and John shoved him back just hard enough to put space between them.
to look after as, their association with him now actually did put them in danger. Dead or alive, it seemed. He was better off when his only real friend was the drugs. They were always there and they didn't pretend and their impending destruction, while it would be disappointing, it wouldn't cause him to fake his own death in order to save them. The whole thing caused him to make a disgusted sound.
"Take care of what?" Sherlock reached between them and squeezed gently, ratcheting John's erection from somewhat intense to extreme.
"Good morning! I didn't know what to get so I got a bit of everything I know you like. In you go, John, so that you can get started. With a few more drops of breath freshener, John had circumnavigated the bed in order to kiss Sherlock soundly. He'd been sampling something smoked and glazed and he was delicious. John slipped into the bed from that side and moved over to make room. Sherlock spooned and forked things onto a rather large plate and placed it on a tray along with flatware and a linen napkin retrieved from a shelf underneath. "This is better fare than what the others are getting," Sherlock explained, handing John the tray and carefully joining him again. His thigh, cooled by the air as it slid against John's tickled slightly. "There's a caterer amongst your old classmates who insisted on contributing their efforts toward the meals, but the hotel's food is much better. Especially ours."
"I've seen you take lives, save lives, especially mine, and now bring one into the world for the first time without hesitation. Only a truly beautiful person is able to do all of that, and still put themselves at risk in the same breath. I mean to see you live for at least a century or more, John Watson, or die trying." He was so damn tired of crying, despite the extreme pleasure that caused the current tears.
"I..." Sherlock closed his mouth and breathed out through his nose, a bit frustrated at his poor emotional navigation.
"True. Many of the worst assaults and murders have to do with sex so it was something important to study. Of course they benignly label it 'crime of passion'. My experimentation was mostly on my own." John's heart fell a bit for the lonely kid Sherlock must have been. His seemingly childish rivalry with his brother had something to do with it, he was certain. "There was viscosity, flavour, volume, etc."
"Sherlock-"
'. Sherlock then spoke as if he was convinced John didn't actually love him, and John knew it was untrue, but Sherlock's entire body began to go limp and that was what was needed.
"John's so much more subtle, but you're behaving as if you've never been... You haven't, have you? You've never been in love?"
"Oh! Sherlock, this is Marceline... is it still McDonald?"
"We only dated briefly. I never even had sex with her."
"No! I just... I expected you to ask about how I faked-"
"Sherlock..."
His keen hearing picked up a murmured, "Right." following him before John's footsteps did.
"In what world is he 'my boyfriend', Lestrade?"
By then, Summer was in full swing, complete with the season's first proper heat wave. Sherlock found him on the roof again. John would often go up there as some sort of conditioning exercise. Sherlock always felt the worst when this happened, because it meant there had been a nightmare or panic attack that he hadn't been present for. Fortunately, John was smiling in delight as a dove with soft little patches of toffee colour among the snow white of her feathers, perched from his hand and ate. She was allowing him to pet her and grasp her in his hands when he looked up at the door, the most radiant of triumphant grins affixed to his countenance.
However, when that was taken from him, despite the knowledge always in the back of his mind that it could happen with the situations in which he immersed himself, he was... well... lost. He drifted through life like a ghost, with daily contemplation on whether or not it was time to make himself into a real one. The only thing that kept him alive at that point was disappointing his Mum, though she'd been gone several years by then, the cancer he thought at first was so aggressive that she didn't even have time for options, actually having lived within her the whole time he was in. She just never told him or his sister, citing they had enough to worry about. All he had left by the time she went was a drunken Skype call from Harry, berating him for not being there, for insisting on having to be away from her and Mum. He could have helped her, she'd screamed at him. Logic dictated that of course he couldn't have done. Mum hadn't even said anything until it was too late. That didn't stop his heart from complete agreement with his sister.
"Call this lawyer. Tell him Sherlock Holmes sent you and to look into the nurse with him in the operating theatre. If it's a Nurse Peters he'll know what to do. You all will be well compensated, no matter what. She'll have enough to fill a lovely house with children and send them all to the best schools. Kingsbury does well, but there's also Harrow..." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and john barely kept a straight face at the last comment.
"You were having a nightmare."
"Ask away." Sherlock seemed to feel a bit better, rolling onto his back as he laughed, then sighed and belched, a thing that had him rushing for more water.
His left hand continued down, cream against marble, dancing over and around Sherlock's leaking member, playing in the fluid, bringing it to his mouth for a taste of the man's very essence. Having the entirety of that intense focus was a heady thing, and John basked in it. John went over his path with his tongue, Sherlock writhing with beads of sweat beginning to emerge on his bared skin despite the relative cool of the back seat. The heat was at a level of balance maintenance as opposed to bringing the temperature up steadily.
"It was the brother in the front room of their biological father's house."
"I can't... be without you." John's heart ached for his openly confused expression. "Did you know that?"
"Not to be a good person. You just are that. You have to try not to express it because you feel it will ruin your image. But I'll tell you one thing, it's just going to make others want you more."
"You mean you-"
. Sherlock couldn't speak then, could hardly breathe, could only blink over at the spectacle that was John Watson in pristine Y fronts from where he sat in his arm chair, mouth open in the attempt to do both of those things. As if that wasn't bad enough, John stepped up right beside his left arm. Sherlock's mind was definitely going as he had the craziest thought regarding John's not unsubstantial crotch and hearing the ocean before John put his hands proudly on his hips and asked if his body offended.
"Too late."
him! He was definitely kissing back and tasted like baking ingredients and cherry lip balm and- He immediately stopped cataloging and, on top of everything, his fingers came away wet. No! No he refused to cry. He hadn't genuinely cried since the roof at St. Bart's. He, of course, was attempting to lie to himself, as there were many times when he was away from Baker Street, where the only way he could
"Only if you do. Properly, since you're so averse to pants now."
"And I you, if I'm honest. You saying you're not proud of it implies it just sort of happened. The begging bit, I mean. It was rather... yeah."
annoying, John! It gets in the way of logic and clear thinking. Most people haven't any to spare in that department, yet they seek love against all reason. It's absurd!"
John couldn't help his nerves as they approached the table outside the doors to the dining room, but it helped tremendously that Sherlock seemed a bit nervous himself. It triggered John's caregiver mode and it was automatic, his releasing Sherlock's arm to place a comfortingly escorting hand at the small of the man's back, his encouraging smile which Sherlock immediately returned.
"John we have to take every opportunity to be seen together."
But in the time it took for him to think this, Sherlock already had him fully erect, foreskin retracted, a combination of saliva and beads of fluid from his slit serving as lubricant. The infuriating man continued looking for all the world like he was boredly browsing telly channels instead of furiously wanking John past the point of coherency. He knew exactly what to do, where to rub, how much pressure to use.  He even had the
Sherlock rolled over onto his right side, a spindly, suit-clad arm lolling before settling for resting his knuckles on the floor. He very much resembled a large cat, perched precariously on a tree branch, singular, almond shaped eyes of many colours slitted. John hilariously pictured scratching him behind the ear, somewhere in that black mop of glossy curls, that somehow maintained their tentative style through many vigorous activities. Of course his mind automatically went to what a shagged out Sherlock would look like. Not that he wanted to shag him or anything. He wasn't into blokes. But there was always a time when one wondered what someone around them would look like before, during, and after sex, whether they wanted to admit it or not. Sherlock was even more of an enigma as he'd chosen celibacy. John assumed he was lucky to escape his junkie days without having caught anything.
"Well for God's sake don't apologise and stop moping. I swear you're the only idiot in the world who thinks they've taken advantage of someone else by being the more incapacitated of the two. We were both at the exact same level of faculty use when anything did happen."
Lestrade failed horridly at behaving as if he were surprised at this new aspect of their relationship. "I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. I'm going to be out a lot of money, but I have a chance to win it back." At Sherlock's puzzled frown he moved on. "But all of that aside, not only do I know when two people fancy each other," he stated, "but you yourself taught me how to tell more easily when people are actually having some sort of affair." At least he was paying attention. "And you, you're practically shouting it!"
"They're my lucky pants, alright?" He nearly turned the same colour, unsure why he was blushing over that as opposed to the fact that Sherlock was about to show him how he got hard from playing with his arm pits.
"Like what? Like I was basically a sentient meat suit just waiting for my turn to die? Because that's what I was after you... left."
"Alright?" Sherlock asked quietly. John drew in a deep breath and released it with his answer.
"That was... incredibly insightful."
"Promise me, Sherlock. I'll be very disappointed if you see our babies for the first time without me. It's bad enough Clara got to see them before us." Sherlock's demeanor changed slightly, meaning John had finally properly gotten through to him.
"The Indonesian black chicken. That isn't a cooking method, the feathers, skin, even the meat and organs are all actually the same colour as or darker than my coat. I had a bit of bother getting it. My Javanese is a rather rusty. At first they thought I wanted fish then they thought I wanted noodles. I finally had to show them a picture."
be with?" He allowed Sherlock his scan, determined to expose the full force of the truth to him. Sherlock snatched his eyes away and went back to his microscope to hide the physical evidence of whatever he was emoting. John followed, curious to see what would happen next.
"Of course not." He thought John might run, or reject him outright, but, and he really should have started expecting it, the ex-Army Captain kept him on his toes, once again going in an entirely different direction.
"It wasn't... like that. I mean, I thought it was for a while but then..."
"You apparently don't have to." John was reasonably sure Sherlock wasn't talking about them. "Your very name seems to inspire pregnancies. Besides she's recently separated from her children's father and still carries a torch for you. Probably has all these years, and though she'd probably never act on it, and has given him nearly three healthy children with whom they've built a life, the husband finally got tired of playing second fiddle to a high school memory.
Without missing a beat, John responded, "Which sounds practical on paper until you consider that these same people tend to think love is sexual arousal." He really was Sherlock's perfect match.
"At this time. That could change in an instant, though."
John snatched the keys out of the ignition, ignoring Sherlock's indignant noise and, extremely quietly said, "I'll show you old fashioned. Get in back." Sherlock blinked at him again, only this time it was wide-eyed surprise and assessment.
"Not really. I mean it wasn't real yet." Sherlock lifted his head, causing John to turn his and they locked eyes.
John was nearly crawling out of his skin with the desire to
"You should. Even my little brother has only ever managed six months. You've been off the grid for over eighteen." John bit back a chuckle. Sherlock was never found unless he allowed it, probably needing Mycroft's resources. The mere mention of him, however, weighed heavily in John's chest. It had actually been some time since he'd heard the name mentioned aloud by anyone in the same room but him, avoiding the news as much as he was able. Flashes of luxuriously curled black hair and pale ever-changing eyes ran rapidly through his mind before they were captured and stuffed back into their room of John's own rendition of a Mind Palace, locked securely away once more. It was actually more of a military facility with spartan barracks and many high clearance areas.
"Yes, seriously."
"What?"
"You agreed."
"What have I said this time?" Sherlock sighed, of course knowing his heart. That
"You're thinking too loudly," it complained. "This is simply an attempt to become more comfortable with being in closer than usual proximity." The next bit was slightly distorted by a yawn. "If we're going to be a convincing couple, that is."
"Excuse me?" John only laughed, forcing Sherlock to drop his affected offense and continue his seemingly random thoughts. John had to admit that the idea Sherlock could even be jealous in this way made him feel all warm inside. He had only to keep him from carrying out some things because of this newfound facet of jealousy. "You know Mrs. Hudson will be thrilled about all of this."
Without warning, Sherlock wet his fingertips in the extra saliva he was purposely producing and began working John's nipples once again. The effect was almost instant.
"Lestrade," he said, John's inwardly visceral reaction to his live voice nearly winded him with surprise. "If you could please see if-"
written in beautiful calligraphy on the cover. Where the mirror used to be over the fire place now hung their wedding portrait. It was this on which his eyes lingered.
As they crouched over the corpse of an unfortunate young runaway, Sherlock brilliantly recognised it in under four minutes as an unconventional murder, not an overdose. He rattled off his findings in his usual way, stripping off his protective gloves before turning with a flourish. Only this time he said, "Come along, Darling." John followed with a nod, as he didn't even realise what had just occurred, compounding it with his own,
"No pretending, Sherlock," he begged. "No exaggerating. No unrealistic public persona. Not for this. It's just... not for this, okay?"
"Wh-what if it didn't fit?" John was overwhelmed with sentiment. He hadn't cried this much since after Sherlock, and now it seemed anything could set him off, no matter how cute or romantic it actually was.
"I don't know. I'm a bit... confused." That made two of them. "Is this just the drugs getting out of your system, or a new level of... relationship? Are we just finishing out the night or...?" He sighed in frustration and, as usual, decided on the direct approach. "Are we trying something here?"
"In one place in the world or another. Pay attention, John." Good 'ol Sherlock, confusing and degrading him for being confused by his cryptic and often unnecessarily complicated talk. "One of my experiments was to have people from all around the world. Like what you have a reputation for with your old Army mates."
Wait that's going to make me come way too quickly!" John had no idea what sort of lust-driven craze had overwhelmed any common sense he may have had. It often was that way with Sherlock. Many times, their logic existed outside of the norm, and this was no exception. John had an astounding desire to not only see Sherlock come, but be the instrument used in achieving his orgasm. He took his hands away from Sherlock's most active erogenous zones, much to the protest of the man currently not concerned enough to stop bouncing on his cock, and extracted the handcuffs he'd pilfered off the officer that had incarcerated them. He was just wondering if he could do it, as they hadn't cuffed them in the first place. He was not only extremely successful, but stopped trying to figure out why he did it. Taking Sherlock's right nipple into his mouth for a hard, slow, suck that ended with licking a trail just to the crease of where his arm met his torso, and Sherlock's arms held fast behind his back.
"Cracked the case of the Tin Detective, have I? Is that what I'll write in the announcement?"
to before now, and he wasn't sure Sherlock would be able to get him there this first time. He didn't want Sherlock to feel inadequate. Even now, in his uncertainty, he was concerned for Sherlock's feelings. What an idiot. What a beautiful, clever, idiot.
"I only said that I... didn't agree with the lines of the suits in her Spring collection," Sherlock responded quietly. "I can't believe you used to date her."
enough sleep. Or water. But the taps were all the way over there. And this wall was nice and cool, if a bit damp now.
"As do I," he retorted. He couldn't believe he was once again starting to thicken at this talk and John's proximity, his kisses drawing him further out. He decided to start practicing control again if not full celibacy. He'd actually experienced those orgasms, according to the evidence in his pants when he woke. There was no reason to stretch out this emotional torture any longer. Sentiment was exhausting. "For now, however, shall we watch another episode?" John smiled at him as if he'd just cured cancer in a puppy and kissed him long and deeply again before hauling himself to his feet and walking back to the sofa, lovely arse slightly and enticingly jiggling.
"Good man," John praised, then kissed him, ending up in his lap.
"Grandmummy! Grandfather!" she bellowed at least three times until she reached them, both reaching out to receive her. She ran into Sherlock's mother's arms and was lifted into the tightly layered embrace of both grandparents.
.  Those are not feats easily accomplished." John could hardly contain the massive yet pleasant ache in his chest at these words. " He remembered, standing in that lab at Bart's, so alone and lost, meeting Sherlock's eyes for the very first time and the single thing that sparked something within him. It had been so tiny, so oppressed by all the negativity, that he thought it a fluke, right up until they went out on that first case. He wasn't proud to admit he still sometimes doubted it to this day, but he was always proven wrong to do so. "Despite our actual relationship status at the time, I meant every word of what I said at the birth. I meant it when I said you've always been beautiful and that Marceline was not enough for you."
"Harrow," Sherlock answered, forcing a smile. John looked at him wide-eyed for a moment, but covered it up with a light pat on Sherlock's back and another genuine smile.
heart out there, afraid of rejection, which understandably happened at first for short moments. Sherlock had begun to find redemption through allowing John to help nurse him back to health, rage against him when he needed to, hours alone just... talking. Even then, there wasn't the complete safety he felt now, in his arms, the total comfort he found in his body and, if there was such a thing, soul. He couldn't remember the last time he wept like that, even as a child. All that went through his mind in five seconds instead of the pre-fall three. It was loads better than the ten it took him when he first arrived back in London, then home to Baker Street.
"That would be best, because I don't know how not to look at you that way." What was
"And no running off to go see her anyway when I'm in the loo or something." Sherlock's eyes cut up to him. "Sherlock..."
"Am I? What was it again?"
Sherlock cleared his throat as he did when becoming uncomfortable in any way. "W-well done, John. Your skills are improving-"
John launched himself at him, toppling them both to the floor, crying and kissing him without actually having said yes. The kisses were quickly becoming too distracting, but he could let it go no further until the results were locked in, however trivial it seemed in reality. With great difficulty, he sat up and pushed the box between them,  re-opening it, as the tackle had flipped it shut again. John repeated 'Yes' over and over again in a thick, watery voice, punctuated by several adjectives such as 'marvelous' and 'brilliant' and 'gorgeous'.
"What are your demands?" Mycroft asked finally.
being the most prominent. He knew when his partner was close and, for whatever reason, more complex thoughts broke through the haze, causing him to slow then stop altogether. Sherlock made the most frustrated sound, a low, brief growl with which John wholeheartedly agreed, though this had to be discussed.
"What's the matter?! I knew something was wrong when you made me move."
Things grew increasingly heated and hard and Sherlock decided that he hadn't yet encountered anything better in his life than a romantically and sexually aroused John Watson. This was the John Watson all those women saw, all at once the clever predator and elusive pray. While he understood it before, it was only on a technical level. He clinically compartmentalized their behaviour, retaining information useful to The Work as well as figuring out ways to make sure they didn't hurt John's feelings/went away as soon as they became inconvenient. John probably would have called it jealousy, and it probably was, in its own way. To be fair, those women didn't exactly stand a chance against the duplexity that was John Hamish Watson. As detached as Sherlock was from all things sentimental, even he wasn't immune to John's subtly devious charms.
"We only... When I came back from fetching the whisky you were asleep." Sherlock's bodily functions froze at that. "I just... I went to let you out of-of the... restraints and you..."
"I've been doing some reading on psychology. Only a bit, mind you, as I think it's mostly bullshit. But I did just enough to be able to back up my theory that your therapist is bollocks and you'll need a new one. One that I've personally vetted-"
He'd set it all up, finally confiding in Lestrade. He had to bounce ideas off of
"All the more reason to take me," Sherlock stated nonchalantly. John must have had some sort of strange expression on his face, because with a glance, Sherlock sighed. "They're not interested in me, per se. They're interested in me in the context of you. Further demonstration of the dangers of letting others define you. They have no idea who I really am, only the idealized version of me you show them. Together, they not only see that you have locked down the mysterious Sherlock Holmes, but that I've managed to nab one of London's most eligible bachelors. We would be the strongest couple there. It would show up some of your less positively inclined acquaintances."
"Which is perfect timing because you'll just sweat again. Besides, you promised to entertain me. Show me," he said again, softer than he meant to. John gave him a long, rather wary look.
"'Strongly' is a more apt description." That was the absolute truth.
"What? What is it?" Sherlock was only mildly irritated but, as John had blurted once, he was a drama queen. His brand new lover took it as such per the usual.
"We should marry," he said, from his reclined thinking position on the sofa. John sat in his chair reading some inane novel about dragons and desert horse people and Winter coming. That know-nothing bastard was clearly the son of that dead oaf king and the sister of the man who raised him. He may have skimmed it earlier. John, however, didn't even look up when he replied.
"I don't care what anyone says about you, Sherlock Watson-Holmes, you're a very clever man." That earned him a slap on the backside which subsequently got Sherlock's neck bitten.
"I don't...," John took several deep breaths and looked away. "I... I don't know how you knew... or..." He then took a long cleansing breath. "I was always... giving... rather than receiving. In situations like these. Back then."
, his mind helpfully supplied once more.
"Daddy or Papa today?" Jeans and a jumper, or a uniform-like skirt and jacket complete with button down top.
As part of his character(Sherlock hoped), John warned him to calm down in public or he would be in real trouble. Sherlock of course pushed it, purposely rubbing what he'd been informed by the same 'They' that drove his costume choice, was a rather plush backside deliberately against John's crotch. He was absolutely chastised when John began moving his hips in a slow circle, though still to the beat, clutching at Sherlock's hips so as to keep him anchored in place. Once establishing that Sherlock wasn't to move, he dragged his clever doctor's hands up Sherlock's thighs, barely missing the crotch, up the front of his torso, deliberately not missing his nipples and up the underside of his arms, pulling them up and around the back of his neck. John then set about the sensuous touching and groping of innocent places like his stomach and hips and waist. Sherlock had never been so glad in his life, as he was of the volume and repetitiveness of the music that thoroughly drowned his helpless moans.
"You always have that particular little frown when you're irritated with me. I'm glad I'm now allowed to find it adorable, but nonetheless, I dislike seeing it. So, what social faux-pas have I committed? If you won't tell me, you must rid yourself of that expression immediately." John had walked very slowly around to the foot of the bed, casting his eyes about the room.
"Don't start getting awkward," he warned. "We both wanted this. I knew what I was getting into before we even started."
"Yes."
John opened his mouth to start to say something, but closed it again. It wasn't something you just asked someone, best mate or no. He'd tried to delicately ask Mrs. Hudson that time way in the beginning. She had no idea either.
"Sherlock..." he whispered, but was unable to do anything else other than hold him more tightly and press their foreheads together.
of John... going away.
What a choice of words. Especially with that bit of pie filling on his cheek that only smeared and became covered with flour when its presence was indicated and he swiped at it, looking around for a reflective surface that wasn't currently covered in ingredients. He followed John into the loo without thinking about it, putting on a show of sucking his teeth and rolling his eyes. But somewhere, between his in-character farce of a reaction and contact with the skin of John's face, he realized that this was why it sometimes really bothered him when his flat mate would be puttering about, especially in the kitchen when Sherlock was doing an experiment. He was distracted by how much he wanted to just bloody
"See?"
"They've... never even met me. They weren't even at Sherlock's funeral. Of course we know why now, but still." He absently took Mycroft's coat and ever-present umbrella to hang on hooks by the door.
"It's not!" He grabbed two fist fulls of black curls and sat hard on the side of the bed. John sighed and sucked his teeth, feeling a little guilty for joking around when the man was obviously so upset. "I... left you. I left you alone."
John kept looking briefly up at his other, trying to asses whether or not Sherlock was being upset as it was the last thing John wanted to do. Sherlock's face was frustratingly blank as murmured comforts slipped mechanically from those shapely lips. He'd remained on the couch, only slid forward to sit on it properly and having her use his legs to lean on now that she'd turned around. Sherlock had previously approved the story, as far as John remembered, but had in the past always complained about how much John romanticized him. It was considerably more stressful to believe that some things were alright in certain situations but still be unsure. He hadn't time to work out his own heart at the moment as he had two others on which to focus. Sherlock facilitated the whole thing by giving him a genuine, reassuring grin, despite the potential tragedy unfolding before him. He could tell Sherlock knew something was wrong.
"I mean, yeah we were both pretty drunk but I don't think you were as drunk as I was. The things we... It couldn't have been very comfortable when I had so little control over myself."
At the wedding, Harry somehow had a major change of heart. John wasn't sure it wasn't something Sherlock instigated, but would never know, as he still had his secrets. John knew all the ones that were important at least. Like precisely where and how hard to bite to make him screech like a woman. It was endlessly amusing, though he could only employ the knowledge sparingly as Sherlock came dangerously close to snapping his neck on more than one occasion when doing so.
"What was this? Some elaborate, long-term seduction?" John laughed a bit at the idea.
The funniest thing was that Sherlock was laughing along with John after the line was uttered. The majority of the film's elements were abhorrent, but John...
"Never," Sherlock pouted, simultaneously offering his lips for another kiss.
"Really?"
"That has yet to be determined. But that sounds like an interesting study..." Sherlock went into his jacket pocket for his notebook, holding the dressing gown hostage with the same hand that held the little pad. His appearance of scientific interest poorly masking the utter cheek in his near-smile.
"It's only Papa," she said, squirming to get away so she could climb over her Daddy in order to go to him. John reluctantly let her, heart still racing, even though he knew it was perfectly safe. He took slow breaths, calmed a lot more quickly by the sight of Willa crawling into Sherlock's lap without reservation and Sherlock, without reservation or taking his eyes off of John, accepting her as if he'd been doing it the whole time, planting a kiss among the curls he'd given the child.
"Come back in here," Sherlock said, not meaning for it to sound like so much of a command. He was toting his jumper, his sleeves still rolled up, jeans covered in ingredients. He looked like that suburban dad who, at first glance, made those who didn't know what to look for wonder how he had seven kids with his supermodel wife. It was unreasonably attractive.
"What do you think they're going to ask you that you don't talk about in your silly blog?" Sherlock again looked through the eye pieces. "They don't have to know every little thing about, say, government clearance, or the foot in the crisper."
"What gave it away? The the logo on my bag or the work out clothes?" John asked smugly after a sigh someone may have interpreted as 'fond'. Sherlock did sit up then, and the reality of what John looked like was infinitely more disgraceful than anything he could have imagined. That he was constantly surprised by this was irritating. The silvering honey of John's hair spoke of constant fingers being pushed through it due to perceived discomfort associated with a missed hair cut. He sported an olive drab tank top and Arsenal red football shorts, the team's crest a patch on the right leg near the hem. The fact that Sherlock recognized just the symbol made him inwardly flinch, though he was soothed by the rest of his senses exercise in non-visual deducing through sound and smell.
"Do you think all five of her children are called some version of John?"
"So are you. An extremely advanced toddler." He received the expected eye roll as he planted a light kiss on Sherlock's forehead.
"You and Papa argue
"What? No not like that. I-"
"You look gorgeous, Babe," he praised, Sherlock only responding with preening when John turned back to the mirror so as not to destroy his brooding image. John then went to stand in front of him for one last assessment, holding his hands out in presentation.
"Is it?" John wasn't getting any less irritated. "It's absurd to want some human contact that means something?"
"So... what the fuck do you want?"
"Were you dissatisfied with the kiss?"
"You are an absolute menace, Sherlock Holmes," John murmured, staring at his face and running his hand tenderly along the side of it.
"These were made by my great great grandfather on my mother's side, from materials found whilst traveling in Africa. It's said to have a spell on it, that controls who may wear it. Ridiculous really but, it is said that rings made from it are only to be worn by people in a true partnership. The jewelry made from it is never to be re-sized, nor has it ever been. I checked the history of it when I was told the story. The enchantment dictates it must fit whomever it is given to at the time of the betrothal without having to be re-sized. That person is with whom you are supposed to be for the rest of your days." He slid it onto John's finger, holding his hand up to the light.
"Well, it's better than
"Are you stalling by attempting to refill my head with useless facts?"
"If you'll excuse us, I love this song. Let's dance, Darling." John snapped out of facilitating blending mode back into active engagement mode at his menaingful pet name.
"You're sure?" A much less chaste kiss ensued.
"Right."
"How am I supposed to do that when I'm often chastised for not saying things properly?"
"Yes, it is." It was his military photo along with a poppy and a forget-me-not. "Hey, bonus points if you can tell me what kind of cancer killed Tom Smith," John entreated, face aching form trying not to smile so widely at this fascinating demonstration. Performing monkey he wasn't, but what Sherlock
"You do know that Mycroft is... mostly joking when he calls me your enabler, right? I do have clear boundaries, you know." Sherlock hesitated to think a moment longer and John started actually reading once more.
with his mouth? It was rebelling horribly, saying things without his mind's approval. He was never this outwardly sentimental, yet here he was, bending and twisting his neck for a volley of kisses, his mind churning with a chant of how it'd never be enough. He'd never get enough of John. This was going to be difficult. Especially with a soundtrack of romantic inane music he'd set playing on his phone as it sat next to Sherlock's on a little table by the tub, in their matching black shock and water resistant cases. John's of course bore the same RAMC crest his favourite mug did and Sherlock's had a rather clever drawing of a violin made from his skull and various lab equipment drawn by, of all people, his new biggest fan, Anderson. This was insanity. Especially when he'd quickly texted his brother whilst John was busy in the kitchen. He hadn't the time to spend on the phone with his mother as she gushed over his asking for the ring she'd inherited from his Grandfather. His parents were the original, what was puerilely called on the internet 'Johnlock shippers', insisting they would be together. Mycroft had texted back a smug 'Good Luck' that he just knew he'd regret.
"Mummy and Father and I'll hear nothing else unless you're introducing us to someone," she commanded. Definitely passed that to her boys as well. "Same goes for you, Greg Lestrade," she called over John's right shoulder. "You are family and we Holmes' look after our own. Now come and embrace me you lovely, brilliant man." He looked over at Sherlock, speechless with the grand acceptance. A tiny nod and even smaller smile encouraged him to do as she said, even if he hadn't been planning on following her every word to the letter. He heartily shook Father's hand and, with a kiss for Mummy and a handshake for her husband from Lestrade, they were ushered inside.
"And we'll give Lestrade the bison and Sally Donovan the spiciest one and not tell her." John nearly choked laughing, having to drink significantly more wine than he'd originally thought he'd need to get the tickle out of his throat.
"The flat?"
He felt the way he did about their first kiss, however. He wanted to try, yet he wasn't sure if he should have done until it was happening. Also, sex was much more of a big deal. Kissing could sometimes be more intimate, yes, however John was changing a lifetime of being the way he was and that would take some time. They hadn't even discussed it past Sherlock declaring he would be the bottom for the sake of the charade but that he preferred switch-hitting in real life. John wanted so much to ask him, but didn't feel he was entitled to even that extra information, especially past the point of their both having a clean bill of health. Besides, what if he was shit at it?
!" John shot back, dodging and moving around the table to successfully avoid his chasing flatmate. "The next time you did this without my agreeing to it you're to get a separate refrigerator, remember?" John sped out the kitchen door and came back in the sitting room one, hearing Sherlock double back sneakily and taking the opportunity to turn and bolt down the stairs to the music of Sherlock's frustrated growl.
"That, and queuing," Sherlock sighed, breath warm and humid against the back of John's neck. It took the blogger the full space of five minutes and a trip down to the loo after a promise to return was extracted from him, to realise what was happening. The weight of it feeling routine without actually ever being so caused him to need a bit of space to think it through a bit with a mind that was now fully awake. He made his way to the sofa, vaguely regretting not wearing his dressing gown in the chill of early morning, but couldn't yet face the situation in his room again.
"If I was... that way... is there anyone else I
"Yes yes, I know. How very altruistic of you. Open the bloody drawer there. Hurry up!"
"The... the p-passion bit?"
"Seeing as how my parents are dead, Mick, I don't see them much having an opinion on the subject." Sherlock plucked the child from John's grasp, and handed her back, but not without a discreet nose to her hair he probably thought John didn't see.
"I don't know. You seem a bit..." Sherlock was beginning to properly shut down and John couldn't have that. "You really liked that baby," he somewhat teased. It had somewhat the desired effect.
"Well if it's connected to a case or something interesting like that..." John stopped his 'fantasizing' and leaned over for the sole purpose of giving Sherlock a hard look. "Oh don't look so scandalised. Do you honestly think I wouldn't be all for that bit?" The laughter this time was full on and cathartic. With a final pat, John went to make tea and Sherlock suddenly retrieved his laptop and holed himself up in his room. It wasn't unusual, so John took no special note of it. As he re-scrubbed his favourite mug with bleach to counteract the potential danger of any lingering experiment components, he paused.
"It's the only solution that will satisfy everything."
"Don't," he gasped, a little surprised at just how eager he was at the moment. Sherlock pulled his dressing gown wide open and set on the flesh available there.
"And Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade, and especially Molly Hooper," he listed with a magnanimous smile.
"It was fine. I was fine." John felt a tentative finger brush his hip. "We were all fine and we all missed you terribly and tried to make things right."
"Yes, well..." He sat again with a frustrated sigh. "I'm rubbish at this."
"John would never press charges."
"I thought this would be more appropriate."
"You and I know this, but he'll hear nothing but your forgiveness face to face." The tears came without his permission. Crying in front of Mycroft was the last thing John wanted to do. It felt much too weak. But Mycroft did something completely astounding then. He moved to John's side and rested a warm hand on John's back as he sat with his face buried in his hands to hide his grief. "Doctor Watson-"
"Okay... Did you... want me to bring the DVDs down?"
Until the begging.
"Not if my past is anything to go by." John looked a bit embarrassed by this.
"I...," John finally said after a long moment, "What was that?"
He did most of the talking, Sherlock taking his cues to murmur into his ear when he had something to ask and playing the perfect support companion. He didn't even miss a beat when Sherlock was referred to as 'Billy', remembering his legal first name was William. John was quite the wonder to observe, putting everything he'd learned combined with everything he already knew into full effect. Even Sherlock was almost convinced that, when they left, it would be in a rush to get him home, into bed, and thoroughly ravished.
"No! No no." He did kiss John then. "No. There are no standards. You can do everything or nothing and I'll still want you." Was there some sort of truth serum element added to the mixture? Because he couldn't stop the words. He wanted to try lying, just to test the theory, but John's face, the expression that was a combination of relief and delight and anticipation warranted only truth.
"Engagement present."
"Alright. Whatever." John couldn't believe how quickly his arousal returned at the mere agreement, the potential for shenanigans increased tenfold. He took his time, carefully replacing and securing the gun. It was time. No more waiting for the next step to happen to him while he was still trying to decide what it would be. He kissed Sherlock lightly before standing and walking back to the fireplace. He set the box next to the already framed prom photo they'd taken, his desire becoming further increased when he noticed that, in the photo, Sherlock had taken the dog tags out of his shirt so that they could be displayed prominently. He trailed fingertips over it before going to lock the sitting room door and check the kitchen one on his way to Sherlock's bedroom.
"Besides," John tried to find something, anything that would lighten the mood, as this was dangerously close to pain, "you know of the two of us, people would be much more interested in you."
"Fifth and last," she swore. "Any minute now. But I couldn't miss out on this. Johnny, my eldest, is actually attending our old Alma Mater next year."
Unseen hands continued to mutilate, un-anchored voices chided and found great amusement in his suffering. The laughter was minimal when they were hurting him, but it became positively maniacal when they saw how he struggled against his restraints in an attempt to get to John, who began calling his name. He was not at all screaming, as the situation would warrant, not even raising his voice. But the sheer pain was obvious. It was an ache Sherlock felt himself, even through everything being done to him. It wasn't his name in that broken, wretched tone that was the worst thing. It was the words of comfort. Even as they marred John's beautiful, very slightly slightly golden skin further, his best friend soothed
"Come here," He stood up, then maneuvered John into the seat. He then folded his lanky frame onto its knees and rested his chin on John's right knee, staring up at him in the most distractingly innocent fashion. The head-petting seemed to help him gather his thoughts. He closed his eyes and pushed on as if he was a child valiantly taking foul-tasting medicine. "I spoke with Lestrade about it briefly, and he helped me reach the conclusion that the only way I'll be able to let you out of my sight now is if you agree to marry me."
"Yeah. God yeah," came the reply before he could properly think. They were already going further than ever and they were more than under the influence. The basement of influence. The
"Of course," she retorted, clearly accepting his odd brand of apology. "I actually designed it with him in mind. I always preferred his body structure. Compact yet sturdy. Deceptively strong."
"Oh yeah. We should do that."
"Indeed." Mycroft stood patiently, seeming indifferent to the chill wind coming off the water a few yards away on the other side of the fence he'd built around the little house, fitted with well-hidden security cameras. "Also lack of manners." That infuriated John.
"Because I hadn't hurt you, not because I didn't want to do anything with you. Babe...,  how could you be so clever and so dumb at the same time?" Sherlock's eyes snapped solidly to his at that question. He opened his mouth to return offense but lost the ability to do so when John usurped it with a resolving kiss that had him in the same position as that first one after their last romantic hiatus. John swore he heard a very Mrs. Hudson-like
"I... are you coming back?" He thought he couldn't feel any more
"I... how..." But his words were garbled for the lack of a tongue.
"What?"
"John..."
"That's my job, isn't it?"
wash my hands of the situation. It can't be stopped. You're mine now." They kissed again.
"I meant exactly what I said, John. If it will make you feel any better, I'll confess that we didn't actually do anything significantly more than usual last night." John perked right up, his face fraught with confusion, hope, and a tiny bit of disappointment that came out of nowhere.
It was as cozy and homespun as it looked on the outside, the decor and overwhelming air of simplicity making it seem much smaller than it was, but in a warm, familial way. By the time they reached one of several sitting rooms (the library, judging by the thousands of volumes lining the walls three storeys high)Willa was perched on her grandfather's knee, nibbling primly on a biscuit and, between swallowing bites, so she wouldn't talk with her mouth full, was relaying the story of her necklace yet again, but in full this time. She told her rapt listeners about how no matter what happened, where they went or who with they could or could not engage, she was loved by everyone represented. She'd memorized that, in case of emergency, she was to contact Sherlock Holmes and say 'Vatican Cameos', as "Papa may not pay attention to a child trying to contact him." That earned Sherlock an icy stare from everyone in the room except John, who could only smile proudly. There was no time to be angry over Sherlock's idiosyncrasies when trying to keep their daughter safe and John said so after a moment. Sherlock seemed surprised that he did, sat closer to his father than he probably had since he was a boy himself with John firmly at his right so that their thighs pressed up against each other. John couldn't blame him. He himself had to be able to touch them both at any time at the moment, too.
He'd been blessed with a happy child, one who would smile most of the time, even in her sleep. Today she awoke grinning with tiny white teeth and patting him on the cheek.
Sherlock stroppily threw himself into his chair facing John, pouting and attempting to get his flatmate's attention through the judicious application of the most hateful glare he could come up with. After a full minute of attempting to ignore it under the guise of researching more units, John couldn't help the tiniest of smirks, which quickly went downhill when, coincidentally, a muted video ad for the opening sequence of Monty Python's Flying Circus popped up in the sidebar. When the foot came down on the entire affair, John burst out laughing, clicking on it to produce sound and a full-screen view of the replay before turning it to face Sherlock, who subsequently began a low, rumbling chuckle. Before long, they were both in hysterics, John having to put down the laptop before he dropped it. Sherlock picked up his own laptop and typed something in extremely quickly as they finally calmed.
"When you were sexually active. What was your... you know... thing?" Sherlock looked almost as shorted out as he did when John asked him to be his best man. "Sorry. I just... you said anything.. and I'd been wondering for a long... sorry."
"Right. So there's that. Cards on the table," he murmured.
Over the years after that, there were regular visits back and forth between her brand new flat and theirs. John, who admitted to seeing something of an extraordinary change right away at their wedding, saw even more during that time, even though they now saw each other often. They didn't discuss surrogacy again until she came to them with the reminder of her promise. Sherlock convinced him all would be well. He'd taken some measures himself as far as diet and exercise was concerned in order to give the most healthy sample possible, a practice which John also took up in order to be his support in it, and now here they were, healthier and happier than ever. Even Clara was tentatively back in the picture, agreeing to be her coach, and perhaps her wife again.
In the quiet comfort of each other's company(read: Sherlock pouting about pigs), they made sure they had everything before checking out of the hotel.
"Not even tea? I got some of that Jasmine you like and that special honey from the Tesco across town because I thought it would help you feel better." How the fuck did John maintain his lovely behaviour toward him, even if he was being a dick. Speaking of dicks, he could feel his heartbeat in his at the unwitting thought of how John would always randomly touch him and working out what those fastidious doctor's fingers would feel like wrapped around it. "Sherlock?" Gasping his name before encircling it with charming lips he never seemed to stop licking. Sherlock had seen him casually eating an ice lolly once, as if he had no idea he was being watched. Sherlock always watched him when the opportunity arose. That, coupled with 'accidentally' overhearing him telling one of his old Army mates with whom he'd reconnected through the blog about how well he did with oral sex nearly pushed Sherlock over the edge, and he had to grab one of his pillows and push it down over himself. It was rather the wrong move as his hips began moving a little bit of their own accord, seeking relief.
"I... Sherlock," John propped himself up on his left elbow to look down at him, his hair even more hopelessly, adorably disheveled, "I just don't want you to feel obligated to-"
"My waters!"
"A couple wouldn't necessarily wear pants in bed together all the time," Sherlock replied lightly, causing John's back to go rigid as he stared straight ahead before slowly turning his gaze to Sherlock nonchalantly continuing on his mobile. "Perhaps under pyjamas or something, but I would imagine only when staying over at someone else's house or the weather's cooler. Even then, body heat would be more than sufficient in...Oh for God's sake, john of course I wore pants. Happy?" If he was honest, John wasn't quite sure what he was.
"I what?" Sherlock sat up straight and wove his hands together, letting them hang between his knees to affect an air of casualness, but if John was even looking, he would be able to see that his knuckles were white. No. This wasn't happening.
"Huh." John then sighed, relieved though the dash of disappointment remained for whatever reason. "I should have known you weren't actually drunk or didn't beg," he grinned up at him.
"Babe you can't-"
"No, John. Don't. Don't over think this. Please. We don't have to do anything ever again, if it will make you feel better. Just... just please, Darling..." Sherlock begging was again getting to be a bit more than he could stand except for the bit where he said the thing about never doing it again.
"Mind palace agreement doesn't count, you know that!" He nearly bowled over Mrs. Hudson coming out to see what all the commotion was about. John swiftly tugged her into her flat and locked the door behind them. He tucked the foot in the freezer before their landlady saw what it was and silently hushed her with a finger to his lips. There were scratching noises at the front door but John knew his best mate, waiting until he heard the direction of quiet footsteps, though the scratching continued. He looked at his watch before very quietly instructing Mrs. Hudson to wait exactly two minutes after he'd closed the front door, then yank the back door open.
Finally he'd let slip that John needed to put something more on and all hell broke loose. He gave Sherlock that unreadable side look, the one that fooled the amateur into thinking he was contemplating something. Sherlock knew he'd already thought of something by the time it came across his face. It also meant Sherlock was in trouble.
He filed away the information that John's laughter somehow tasted like honey.
"Frankly I'm surprised you let me bathe alone," John teased because of Sherlock's recent (welcome) propensity to keep in constant physical contact. He just stared. "Thank you for the dressing gown and... well everything."
"John and I are practicing pretending to be a couple in order to attend his school reunion," Sherlock explained, looking only at Lestrade. Sally stood to the Detective Inspector's right and opened her mouth to say something, only to have it completely covered by the meaty hand of her superior. "Apologies," Sherlock continued. "That display was rather unprofessional. Won't happen again. John?" He returned quickly to his original trajectory.
"Stop it," Sherlock's voice was low in his left ear. "You were doing what you knew of as being right."
"That's ridiculous."
"Yes? You'll marry me now?"
"I'm not moping, I'm dancing."
"Don't worry, John. She and I raided the fridge when she awoke in the wee hours." John still wasn't sure whether or not to stay worried that he hadn't gotten up to give his child breakfast for the first time in what was practically her entire life. "We had porridge with local honey and wheat toast." John breathed out in relief, trying to keep the reaction more neutral as he didn't want to put Sherlock off of parenting. There was time enough for that if Willa ever got a cold in front of him or, God forbid, injured herself.
"I don't..."
In fact, everything about him at first seemed to be under his complete control and John knew Sherlock did that on purpose. He knew a uniform when he saw one, despite its non-traditional aspect. Everything that Sherlock had that was opposite to him turned out to be a compliment. The yin to his yang, their similarities and differences fit together seamlessly to make a whole, the base aspect of one central to the other.
"I knew I had to keep you in my life at all costs," came Sherlock's words out of the darkness. "You didn't just tolerate me, or coddle me. You challenged me. In a way I never thought possible. Especially from you." Though his eyes were not yet adjusted to the dark, John looked over and down at his beloved and was able to just make out that he had his head tilted up, and was looking back. There was the a flash of pale skin here and a glittering of his eye there in the light of the street lamps. "I knew you were different from the time we first met. I didn't know what it was about you. I still don't really. But you help me in ways I never thought possible and love me in spite of all my.... shortcomings. The few times you manage to out-think me, I was actually amused! You impress and surprise me often, John Watson, and make me
"That's your story and you're sticking to it?"
"What?" Sherlock demanded, that stupid panic returning.
in. It was pathetic and annoying and absolutely necessary. He dozed a few more minutes, unreasonably upset with his full bladder. When it became unavoidable, he sighed again and, extremely gingerly, removed himself from their warm embrace in order to use the facilities, change into clean pants and pyjama bottoms, and wipe himself down. To his chagrin(and unfortunate expectations), he returned to an empty bed, catching him halfway up the stairs to his room. He stopped when Sherlock quietly said his name but didn't turn at first.
"What is it?" Something was making Sherlock nervous and no matter how horny he was, it was more important he find out what ailed his love's heart. John approached him as non-threateningly as possible and halted in time to keep a few inches between them.
"What?" John returned innocently. It really was innocent, despite the subject matter.
"Sherlock..."
"Look, Sherlock! She's all grown up!" The newborn had been found abandoned during one of his experiments Sherlock had started up there as a way of providing a comforting presence without being intrusive on John's therapy. John had of course wanted to rescue her, researched how, and built her a shelter, providing for her and allowing Sherlock to tag her. He called her Tesla, as they'd just solved a case regarding the use of one of the prominent pigeon-loving scientist's machines as the murder weapon.
"Like... like you want me."
"And smelled her head."
"Oh," John gasped halfway between a relieved response and a reaction to his senses flooded with the essence of sex in the air.
The second part would have to wait a while, however. But he found the remembered spot, this vest a bit short so that a sliver of smooth skin taunted him from below the hem, and lay a rather sloppy open-mouthed kiss there, imagining he tasted lemon and sugar mixed with the glorious taste of John. John's giggled question turned into a soft moan when Sherlock pushed it up more and ran the flat of his tongue across the width of his abdomen. He had to pull back again, lest he move too quickly. He recalled slightly the tinge of regret after some hurried encounter. The drugs usually took care of that, however, he no longer had that option. He was pretty sure all bets would be off if he used again and he wasn't about to let that happen. Besides, it wasn't part of the experiment. Of course it would be interesting to see how the experience could be altered by-
"Okay," was all John could manage in his astonishment.
"What for?" He was pacing again, agitated.
"And you call yourself selfish." John's voice shook.
"Which would be a comfort if we KNEW WHERE THE BLOODY HELL WE WERE GOING!" His shouting rang in his ears and he was about to make good on his fantasy of throttling Sherlock when he saw the apathetic look on the consulting detective's face. One more blink. Just one more of those opalescent eyes and he'd do it.
"God, John," the argent-crowned DI nearly gasped. Lifting her to nuzzle her face in a manner that looked much more rough than it actually was. Greg was an old hat with kids, with three of his own. "She's gorgeous!" Her delighted giggle warmed the room more than the fire.
"Making my not being obligated to go any further than I wish a given, show me that."
it was a normally inappropriate response? The man himself spoke up as John struggled with the conundrum sobriety normally offered a ready solution to, the solution usually to keep his mouth shut in the first place.
"Oh I
"Champagne and chocolate glazed strawberries, Dr. Watson, courtesy of the new parents," he announced with a flourish, removing the metal dome in the same manner. As Sherlock examined the fare as well as the cart for reasons that were his own, the champagne was opened and poured. "May I say you do great things, sir. The two of you do."
"Correct, but going by past interactions as well as today's most likely outcomes, it is extremely unlikely to." John pushed it back into its concealing holster. He could probably take a poncy bureaucrat like him out with his bare hands anyway. "Secondly, I wish to meet my niece." John froze at that. Of course Mycroft knew of the child's existence, contributed the entire nursery at her birth, in fact. But did he actually know of her scientific origin? "For Sherlock to meet his daughter," he continued. Apparently he did know. "You didn't really think you could keep your location a secret much longer, once I discovered who Mary really was, that, out of the three of you, she was the only one that had literally no genetic contribution to the child she carried."
not the most attractive in the world by a long shot but I know how to play up my strengths and diminish my
"Damn right, voila. Sherlock... This is a-a museum piece," he stammered.
"Oh, God John! Please! Fuck me!" The words gave him the extra strength to spin them so they didn't slide across the floor any more than they had, and he began ramming into Sherlock, hard, their bodies not only making slapping sounds but solid, pounding noises, punctuated by Sherlock's grunts as each thrust hit home. In the distance, he heard Sherlock's jacket fall off the camera, but he was in some sort of a sexual berserker mode. Everything existed only to serve the encounter.
"Where's your... your suit?" Sherlock finally managed to push out.
"Sherlock," the way John said his name caused his cock to jump again, "I don't know what's wrong, but are you really alright, or are you just saying you are so I'll go away?" Sherlock sighed and, with all his might, attempted to control his voice at least, to mimic some semblance of calm.
He lay his forehead on Sherlock's chest for a moment, just trying to catch his breath before exchanging with him a coveted kiss that was sheer perfection despite it being so undoubtedly out of order. Despite all they'd just done, it was the kiss that actually sealed his fate. It was the point of no return. Any modicum of a delusion of possible reconciliation, let alone being with anyone else ever that may have been left over, was obliterated entirely by that kiss. His caregiver mode kicked in, having him locate the spare handcuff key Sherlock always had on him in some place people usually passed over when searching and releasing him. He briefly massaged the man's arms and hands, pointedly avoiding the pit area. Even when he got close, Sherlock's spent penis, soldier that it was, made a tiny jerk. He buttoned Sherlock's shirt and, with much effort, moved to be able to pull his trousers and pants back up. Only when Sherlock was completely set to rights, only moving minimally to help until John replaced the cushion and had him lay back down on the bench, did he work on himself. Then he was back to his own original position. The coolness of the wall even more welcome. What had even happened? Was this some sort of surreal dream? All he knew was that, if it was a dream, he hadn't gotten
"Mm?"
"You can't even understand what I'm saying." It was satisfying that he'd only to give Sherlock a warning look and the raven-haired man complied nearly immediately. Only this time he had to kick Sherlock under the table after the second attempt. John had gone to a voice to text translator on his mobile. It didn't quite understand, but the general idea was that Sherlock apologised for her designs being unworthy. "Al
"Is that right?" John raised his head to look down at him. Sherlock examined the bed sheets, fingering the material as if personally counting the threads.
things together.
"I can't hear you," John said.
"Explain," he demanded. Because how dare John successfully make him question his own fashion choices!
"For everything you've been through. You should not have been alone."
"I'll feel how I damn well please if you insist that I must feel at all. Must I say that I love you every five minutes?"
"You don't... you have no idea what's best in this case," John protested.
He fought the urge to thrust with the heaving instructions coming from somewhere close above him telling him not to move. He distracted himself with the bit of milky skin and sparse chest hairs before him, mouthing at them, and re-positioning his hands so that his thumbs could brush the nipples as well as lightly tease the main areas. "
"No! No, please! Let me come."
"I suppose I'll just have to choose something since you're still asleep," John lamented dramatically before exiting the room and as he walked extra slowly down the short hall that lead to the kitchen, he put the phone to his ear and loudly said, "Hello? Sultan's Palace? This is John Watson and I'd like our usual curry order as well as-"
Then John said something he never expected.
"This... whole thing." John gestured widely. Sherlock scanned the area then settled his eyes back on John in that unsettling way he had.
coming from somewhere nearby.
"Logical sentiment? I tell you, John, I don't usually go for psychology that hasn't much to do with psychopaths-"
"TEN!..."
"What this mystery... I dunno, condition is." He could. He could tell John everything and he would be extremely sympathetic and perhaps let him-
"True." John had reached into the front fold of his Y-fronts, whilst Sherlock had his hands on the band of what looked like simple grey cotton boxer briefs. "Red, John?" Sherlock almost snickered. "Going bullfighting later?"
"Lestrade!"
"What?"
"It does at that," Sherlock agreed, peppering his jaw with little presses of the lips. "But, no. Just..." He pulled them upright again, panting a bit. "There's no time to do anything properly right now. We have to go slowly."
"Yes because every day with you in the past has been a walk in the park. I'm sure we'll manage." John couldn't stop smiling about how mad this all was, how so very
to look into those silvered navy depths when he was trying so hard to be angry with him) combined with the term of endearment (which made a surprisingly warm spot in his chest, a bit to the left of his sternum) chipped away at his resolve. This was ludicrous, bringing to mind a glowing green rock that weakened that alien in the silly blue and red uniform with the cape. That helped him recover at least a bit of his ire. John contaminating the pristine waters of his intellect with popular drivel such as that. "Honestly almost nobody is a firmly a zero or a six on the Kinsey scale."
"Ready?" Sherlock asked. John could only nod, unable to take his eyes off of it anyway. "It may take a little longer than usual because of the amount of alcohol I've consumed."
"You're really being dumb now, Sherlock. I never expected it of you." He whipped around to face him but remained where he was. "I swear you didn't hurt me. Not really."
"Not now, now that I know your motive was."
"Oh God yes."
. I apologise for insulting your work. I... The double breasted one wasn't terrible. For John, not me of course," he said clearly in English.
"What? Why? Is it steroids or something? I swear to God, Sherlock if this is one of those things much worse than you're letting on..."
There were several large barbecue pits just outside the canteen, but the meal was being served indoors, complete with dinner ladies making a bit of extra scratch on a Saturday near the end of term. It was a sight, Sherlock engaging in his version of cooing at the toddler in John's arms as they stood around the play structure at the park adjacent to campus, the same in which he'd taken care of the bully those years ago. Sherlock's baby talk involved various explanations of things in the Queen's English, though in a higher register, that would be inappropriate if the child could understand anything he said. Not that the ability to understand prevented him from doing so with an older one, but John would have at least said something in that case.
"Wait, what was on that DVD?"
"It's fine, I'll be fine in a few hours. Get out!"
"Statistically speaking, arranged marriages tend to be the strongest and last the longest," he countered. "Also, many are arranged on the basis of the perceived ideal genetic content of the offspring. For instance, a child of our making would probably have your nose and hair of a similar colour to mine, probably lighter. Perhaps maybe even ginger, with that recessive gene in both of our family lines. Science."
