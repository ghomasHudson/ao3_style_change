Two weeks, that's how long Steve and Tony had been in their honeymoon phase; two weeks since they flow to one of the Stark/Carbonell family villas and homes in Italy to enjoy themselves before returning to their life back in the USA. Two weeks the mated couple spent their time together, getting to know the other intimately in bed, gasping and moaning and sharing pleasure and happiness at the thought of finally being together and alone to enjoy their time while being uninterrupted.
"We are here…" Tony said which made the Omega hum at that and look at the hospital in front of him, sighing as he unclasps his seatbelt and gets out of the car, opening the backseat for his pup and smiling when the pup's sparkling eyes fell on him, the three of them walked toward the receptionist where the woman looked at them, smiling happily when Tony asked about Anna's whereabouts, dragging Peter and Steve with him when they were done.
But Steve never came back, he never returned and Anthony hated the desperation he felt every day that passed, when he was interviewed one day, he hoped against all hope that Steve will come back when he saw the changing man he becomes, when the woman interviewed him and called him Anthony, something in him snapped, he didn't want to be called by that name, because it made his Omega run away from him, so what use it was? Maybe choosing another name will bring Steve back. So he told the woman to call him "Tony" Anthony became Tony Stark that day, Tony Stark was a billionaire, playboy, genius. Tony Stark was superior, he was the king, he was everything that Anthony was not, and the most important, he wasn't weak…
Tony then went to the messages icon and pause a little, what was he going to write? He doesn't know his location, though he suspects it was under Stane's house, but that was just a suspicion, the man could have changed his house or he was in a fucking cabin in the woods for all he knows! After a little pause, his eyes light up, of course! How did he forget! The only sentence that was Tony and Aunt Peggy's secret! When she read it she will know who he was and she will make Shield track the message!
“Where are Steve and Peter, aren’t they coming?” Pepper asked after she stood up and hugged Tony tightly before letting go and pulling Megan from Tony’s leg, getting a grateful look from the Omega, who could finally walk freely without fear of hurting the children. “I don’t see them.” Pepper pouted causing Tony to let out a soft chuckle, everyone knows about Pepper’s puppy crush on Steve, something that everyone including Happy always teases her about.
"Oh look, Megan, there is Pepper," Tony said with a smile, letting Megan go after she screamed in joy and run toward her mother. "Hey Pep." Tony greets his friend hugging her when he reached the woman, making her hold into him tightly.
Maria wondered if she can have the courage to get out of the car, she wondered if she could go toward the house and knock on the door and introduce herself to her grandchild and Tony's Omega, but every time she put her hand on the car handle to open the door she freezes in her place not knowing what to do… secretly she was thanking to Happy, for the Beta didn't rush her or do anything of that sort, he was just waiting for her to decide on her own… the house's door was opened, and an Omega got out which made the pup look at the Omega and stand up when the Omega told him something, rushing toward the house, while the Omega was still outside, it made Maria's breath hitch a little especially when the Omega looked at her from his place, she didn't know what to do, frozen in her place with the Omega's icy stare, but then the Omega turns away from her and returned to the house which made Maria sigh in disappointment.
"And what? Let Tony destroy his life by shackling himself to Rogers? Bucky is alive Steven and as soon as Rogers knows that he will not only break Tony's heart he will destroy him! Who was the fucker who gave Tony the idea of courting that… that…. Ah!" Peggy let out a frustrated scream, which made Steven sigh at that and tilts his head at the woman, with a frown.
The hand running through his hair though made him scrunch his nose because something was weird; for one, Tony was sure that no one was in the same room as him, it was just Tony and Steve, everyone else left them alone, the Avengers on a mission to catch Hydra, and his mother and the Jarvis family to watch over his son. For another, Howard informed them all that Steve may be in a coma, and it's unknown when he will wake up.
At his father's words, Tony laughed which made Howard frown deeply. "Well, unfortunately, father, this is me, sorry to disappoint." Tony spate as he opens the seatbelt and got out of the car ignoring his father's calls as he continued his way to his home on foot…
"Who… who are you?" Steve ended up whispering, not knowing how to act around the woman that clearly seemed to know him, while Steve on the other hand can't even place where he saw her or if he even knew her. At his words, the woman's face fell, and a sob left her, the distress she was emitting was causing the baby in her arms to let out discomfort noises which made Steve's attention zone to the baby immediately.
"I forced myself to fall out of love." Sara ends up saying after a while which made him give a mocking smile knowing that this was nearly impossible. "It hurt, yes, it may seem impossible, but it is possible, you just need time, time to heal, and that could only happen if you stop gazing at Midgard, set your sight on something higher that won't perish, you won't gain the same heartbreak." Sara said gently as she turns his face to Asgard, kissing his forehead before she floats away. It made him laugh, at how easily she said those words, it made him angry and sad and so many other things, but the thing is he couldn't, wouldn't!
"You cannot change everything though, for sooner or later you will have to face the consequences of your choice." Loki said as he picked up his book from where he left it on the table. "Was it worth it though? Being forced to be frozen in time, unchangeable, while everyone else ages and dies off, was it worth it seeing your husband die, in a few short decades when you could have had centuries here with him?" Loki asked curiously as he opened his book once more, looking at Steven.
Steve had been hard at work since eight in the morning it was reaching the stroke of twelve and Steve was happy with his progress he had mopped the floors and cleaned the kitchen along with dusting and changing all the sheets and curtains. Steve doesn't want to brag but he could see his reflection on the floors after he was done with them, and now all that was left was vacuuming the upstairs carpet and the restrooms.
"About what?" Tony asked, deciding to fuck it and take one of the tubs in front of him, his hand going automatically to the blueberry ice cream tub; so what if Tony got poisoned and died? So what if he didn't get to witness his thirty-sixth birthday? It's not like it matter, at least Tony will be able to run away from the unwanted marriage he was trapped in. Tony opened the ice-cream tub, thanking Serpentine when she gave him a spoon and he started digging in earnest in his ice cream hoping to get poisoned and fast at that.
"Something wrong?" Bucky asked with worry shining in his eyes, which caused Steve to shake his head and turn the table on their conversation, getting back to it while ignoring his phone that was buzzing like crazy, serve his Alpha right for ignoring him and their baby on the most important day in their life, after all, how many times was someone going to be a parent for the first time?
Tony sat on the floor for what could have been hours; he sat on the floor and take in the perfectly clean room with empty eyes, wondering where were the blood and the broken furniture that was here not a few hours ago. Part of Tony was wondering if he finally lost his mind, if what he saw last night was nothing but his imagination, throwing him into a nightmare with no way out. Another part, the one that was going through his interaction with Bucky and Peggy pointed out that Tony was clearly the insane one in all of this, even more, insane than the town and their monster in the lake. Since getting to the living room after catching up to him, not once did Bucky and Peggy showed an expression that informed Tony about them seeing the destroyed living room. The two of them moved as they would normally do in his house, no fear of blood, no sidestepping furniture, no wide eyes at the insanity that was in his house… nothing.
Reaching Peter's room, Tony let out a hum when he finally managed to put Harley in bed ruffling the boy's hair before he went to Peter's closet looking through it before he finally took out soft pajamas with cars all over it, returning to Harley's side shortly after. Changing Harley's clothes while the boy slept was difficult, especially when the boy kept grumbling and moving around; in the end, Tony managed to do it and change Harley's dirty clothes with the clean ones, having practiced on Peter for two years to gain this skill. Tony though couldn't stop smiling when Harley let out a happy purr before he turned around and snuggle into the pillow. The sight made Tony's heart give a pang, to think that the small boy who made a place for himself in the Rogers family would run away; just the thought alone broke Tony's heart; especially when the boy didn't even think of contacting them.
"Why thank you for having so little faith in me, Tony." Steve answered in a sarcastic tone, giving Tony a mocking glare, causing the man to laugh nervously. "You know, I have been alive for nearly three thousand years, I saw things that your stomachs can't handle, even being the heroes that you are, and you think that a horror movie will put me off?" All of the Avengers' eyes were wide as they gazed at Steve who was pouting, looking toward Thor, the quilty look on his face informed everyone that Thor informed Steve of the first time he watched a movie.
Howard could only gaze at his son; his son that looks the happiest that Howard saw, his son that Howard was sure the last time he smiled like that was when he was pregnant. Howard's eyes could only take Tony in; gazing at how happy and at ease he was, listening to him humming whatever song that was on the radio this morning with a skip in his steps. The smell of the delicious breakfast filled the kitchen, causing Howard to blink his eyes when he was thrown back into an old memory; an old memory just like this, with Howard sitting on the dining table with his newspaper and coffee, Maria standing over the stove just like Tony was, humming happily as she twirled around while preparing whatever Italian dish that she fancy that day, Jarvis as always, was shaking his head at the mess, but the smile refused to leave his face as he cleaned the dishes that Maria caused with her spontaneous cooking, and Tony, small, not older than five years being a ball of energy, does nothing but rush toward Maria and hold her tightly as he called her Mama with the biggest smile a five years old can have.

The man stopped knocking, and Steve had to hold his shiver at the cold look he was at the end of, Steve slowly inched his hand toward the bat behind the door, hoping that it won't come to it. "Are you Steven Rogers?" The older man asked making Steve press his lip into a thin line nodding his head after a while. "I am Anthony's father; I came to take to you about an urgent matter." The older man said making Steve nearly stop in his chest for a second as different scenarios start going off inside of Steve's mind.
"His name is Anthony Carbonell." The small pup said which brought Maria's attention to the pup, heart dropping at the last name Anthony choose because she wondered if the pup will ever consider Tony as his father when the pup looked at the picture in her hands with happiness and pride. "Mommy said he is the best inventor in the world, Mommy said he is even smarter than Tony Stark himself!" The pup said making Maria take a deep breath at that, it seems that her fear was true in the end, the pup will never recognize his father 'Tony Stark' as anything but a celebrity on the news. "Mommy also said that Wakanda, a place in South Africa asked for his help, so he is there right now he will return home after he is done working there." The small child chattered happily, making Maria clench the frame a little tight in her hands, but she smiled at the pup who was talking animatedly with all of his body just like Tony when he was excited, something she hasn't seen for over a decade now… she cursed Howard to hell and back even as she held her tears and sobs by sheer will so to not scare the pup who was talking happily about his father and the stories the pup's mother told him… she wondered if Tony can really undo the damage that Howard has done…
His body that was full of scars and bruises and pain, his body that sometimes hurt him when it moves, his body's that had scars mapping his life, was new as a porcelain doll. Gone the huge scare that covered his whole chest, thanks to a car accident when he was ten, that day he got kidnaped by someone, and the car crashed, he remembered how he thought he was going to die, he remembered the fear he felt. Gone his bad knee that hurt every time it became cold outside; the bad knee was thanks to his father getting angry at him when he was thirteen, he doesn't remember what he did that day, but Tony remembered how his father took the closest metal pipe to him and hit him on his leg as a lesson, he remembered crying all night that day, his father didn't even take him to the hospital. Gone most of his childhood scars that was either caused by his father throwing something at him when he was angry or drunk, or the scares that were because of Tony hurting himself when he tried to invent something that will make his father's proud… everything was gone… Everything was gone, but not the memories of it, never the memories of it.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, feelings, a little bit of fluff, crying! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
So here Tony was, checking himself in the mirror, trying to see if he forgot something (Well, he was mainly trying to see if the suit he was showing his butt in a better light, making it perky and irresistible) the suit, unsurprisingly was all black; looking closely, anyone can confirm that the suit Tony was wearing was more suited for a funeral than a wedding. Who was Tony kidding though? The Addams family had always had a strange sense of fashion and love for the color black; the only color Tony has on his person was the red tie, which resembles the color of blood closely. If Tony had to say, he would swear that Serpentine dipped this tie in blood before forcing Tony to wear it; not that Tony was complaining, especially when his butt was looking great.
In the end, Steve was able to get all the information he wanted from Natalia, with the promise of her gaining his protection from the Red Room and Hydra… he was sure he gain the teen's respect that day… if he thought that the teen was a fierce redhead Alpha? No one needs to know… with Natalia's help who wanted to be named Natasha… a name she heard Steve loved…?! They were able to know every Hydra sleeping agent that hid in Shield and the American government… they were able to take them out slowly, without drawing someone's attention to what they were doing…
The creature blinked his eyes and got closer to the boy, as close as he has the first time he went to see the person who dared to live in his house after years. The creature let out a loud chirp this time, puffs of breath leaving him, causing a cloud of white to leave his lips; the creature was planning on waking the boy up, which the creature knows will end up with screaming and pleading and crying. To the creature surprise though, the boy did not wake up, he just shivers and curled on himself rocking the boat with him, but not waking up.
, Clint was sitting in front of her snapping his fingers, trying to snap her out of the trance she was in or stop her whimpering… which was a feat considering that she was a scary assassin and was reduced to a whimpering mess by Steve, no less… he now knows how Rogers put the fear of God in that woman.
It didn't help Steve from being concern about his fiancé, knowing Anthony he will ace whatever presentation it was, even if it was a big one as Anthony said to him, Steve sighed as he stood in the apartment complex's front door waving goodbye at Anthony who was waving happily before the car speed away leaving the Omega looking at the car until it was out of his view.
Whatever Howard was planning to say, it was cut by the high shrill sound that made everyone raise their heads in a panic to gaze at the sky. The hair on Steve’s body raises on its ends, for the sound was almost familiar… like the sound of missiles… and panic sized his heart when he saw something falling in his front yard with a crash, throwing dirt and dust everywhere and causing a large hole to form in his front yard. When the cloud of dust finally settled, Steve lowered his arms that were covering his face to see what caused the destruction in his garden, only for his breath to hitch when he saw Tony, his poor Alpha looked like death warmed him over even with the suit covering him, half of the metal on his arms and chest were melted to some degree.
"I know…" Tony's voice cracked as he said that looking at the roses in his hands, nearly squeezing the roses tightly in his hands from how nervous he was, but he was able to calm himself a little in the last minute fearing that any wrong move will push Steve farther away from him. "But I… I…" Tony's voice got stuck in his throat, and Tony nearly start sobbing hysterically at that, finally, after having Steve listen to him without screaming his head off, after getting a chance he knows that he will never get another one no matter how much he will try, finally after all that time… and Tony's voice decided to vanish now of all times?
"Did you forget that you are half an Irish?" Steve teased the boy a little causing the boy stopped in his place; eyes widen at that and his little mouth to fall in shock. "Yup, baby, I am Irish." Steve said causing the boy's eyes to widen more than they already were, causing Steve to smile happily at the change of topic. "So the right count is that you are half an Irish, quarter Italian, and quarter American." Steve said which made Peter blink at that a little like he couldn't believe it.
Anton let out a tired sigh, gazing at the sky counting how much time he had before he forces himself back into civilization and back into being a king once more; seeing that he had a few more hours before the sun left the sky. Anton decided to go deep into the woods near the mountainside. Unknowing to many who won't usually brave the forest as much as Anton; there was a lake not an hour from his home. It was a beautiful place to be in, a relaxing one when Anton want it to be; if he went now, he was sure that he can take a dip in the lake and enjoy himself, maybe the cold water would wake him up from this nightmare. Wistful thinking on Anton's part, he knew. (1)
Blinking, Steven's lips curl into a snarl when his ears caught a noise that wasn't normally associated with the forest; controlling himself, Steven huffed as he turned around and started to walk deeper into the forest, frowning darkly when the faint sound continued to follow him. Whoever was the person following Steven, the person was no doubt trying to hide his presence; any other person wouldn't have noticed the shadow, but not Steven, for the Omega spent years mastering how to catch the enemies and the shadows the Hydra king send after him.
Nicolaus paused at the question, causing Steven to clench his fists tightly as he looked at the tree…
Jarvis… he was an interested person. A man who saw everything, losing everything, that every time Steve's eyes fell on him, he could only see a soldier who was at his last wit. Jarvis always limps, Steve sees it, even when no one wants to comments on it, he sees how Jarvis tries to hold himself off of his left leg as much as he can, how when he passed a certain hall in the house, he would step on his left leg hard… as if he was punishing himself for something. Jarvis was always kind to him, always looking after him like he had to do it to keep his sanity… sometimes Steve felt Jarvis eyes on him, questioning him, pleading with him… blaming him… and always asking… "
“Hello to you too, honey bear, now come and help me before I decided that the floor is a good place for your birthday presents.” Tony called out, sending a mock glare toward the Alpha, trying to hide the laughter that wanted to get out, when Rhodey let out a yelp and rush toward his presents, afraid that Tony will go through his threat.
"You know, Tones, it makes it… less hard to go back to New York. Knowing that you probably won't be dead in a ditch before the week's out." That was Rhodey who continued, causing Pepper to send him a knowing smile, and for Tony to pout, shoving food inside of his mouth, swallowing it before giving his answer.
The silence between them continued until Steve crossed the few feet between them to stand before Tony. "Tony, are you sure?" Tony's mouth was on his prevented him from repeating his question. Stunned, Steve could only stand there, before he pulled Tony gently to his chest, letting out a shuddered breath as the scent of pre-heat intensifies, making Steve hold into his growls lest he scared the Omega. Tony pulled away from the kids and mumbled something, before once again rigorously staring at his feet; face flush bright red both from arousal and from embarrassment. The action causing Steve's lips to twitched up as he cupped Tony's face in one hand to tilt it up. "This is unlike you, Tones." He spoke calmly.
It was silly, it was insane, it was impossible, but so was the monster living in the lake near his house. Just the thought of it being real made Tony snort and nearly laugh himself silly at that; but after days and days of witnessing so many unexplained incidents, Tony decided to give it a little bit of faith.
"Just leave me alone!" Steve snarled, rushing his wheelchair toward the elevator, wanting to get some fresh air or he would really lose it this time. "I won't see him, and I never want to see him again; he can go and fuck himself!" Steve huffed as he reached the elevator, getting inside and closing the door, behind him, going to the ground floor, hoping that the garden outside would calm his frazzled nerves enough that he doesn't wish to kill and maim whoever comes to talk with him.
"You don't understand, Bucky," Steve stated before letting go of his clothes, turning to the angry Alpha, and trying to ignore the hurt he can see in the man's eyes. "Tony… we both know what he did was wrong, we both know that it was unforgivable and couldn't be forgiven easily… but he is my child's father, and I… I can take him away from Morgan; it's not fair to her." Steve tried to explain, trying to ignore that he felt like he was trying to convince himself more than Bucky.
She walked to the seat and sat down pushing her dress under her legs then crossed her legs in front. “Thank you, Is there any questions I can answer before or would you like me to start with the story?”
“You are in the compound. Professor X’s school is here now along with a hospital for the mutants. We brought you here so she wouldn’t find you and freak out. Luna… she’s getting married in a week. I wanted you to be ready to see her again. I’m ready to help you nonstop.”
Bruce helped her to her feet. “We can order pizza and watch a movie. Nat, Clint, and Bucky are joining us. We can cook tomorrow for Happy. I promise.”
“We have to figure something out!” Steve screamed back and blocked another of Tony’s punches. “They deserve to be in a stable home!”
Steve felt his heart clench and looked at Tony then quickly to Luna pulling her closer to his chest. “No! We are not ashamed of you. We just didn’t want to put your identity out in the open for people to see you yet. Maybe that’s what we will do at the grand opening. Be open about us married and our daughter.”
“Okay. Let’s get you home.” Steve rubbed his cheek and walked him to the car. Not commenting on our future comment. “I have you. It’s okay to cry or anything you want to do.”
One the phone read her the text message she teared up. She sat on the bench leaning forward gripping her knees. “Great. Look how stupid I am!”
Violet wrapped her arms around Peter tight with no signs of letting him go. She started to relax which made everyone else in the room relax a bit more. “I will always make my way back to you. Can I take a bath…?”
The drive was quiet. Everyone to her was familiar. Like she knew how this was going to go… oh yeah. She did. She was upset and felt alone, but it was helping her move on. The last time she spoke she blamed her family for not going to help him at the school. Since then she hasn’t spoken.
Luna skipped to the table and sat down smiling at her plate. After everyone ate they walked to the dorm room which was hidden next to the library doors. Everyone had there own little ‘room’ within the bigger room. Luna has one in the back with all of the first years, Smiling she closed the door to her room and laid on the bed. She sat down her book bag and pulled out her phone hitting play on her playlist.
Peter jumped down and ran back to Tony’s side dragging Violet behind him.  Peter wrapped his arms around Tony’s leg and cried hard. “Don’t go! Don’t leave me again!” Tony just rubbed his back and cooed at the boy.
Luna leaned into him and cried. “I-I don’t know what to say… thank you! I’m so excited! Dad, Papa this is the greatest news I’ve gotten all day! Who are we gonna dress as?”
When she reached the beach Steve was standing there watching the sunrise fully. Steve was leaning into Bucky while holding his hand. “I have you,” he kept whispering into Steve’s ear.
“This is the best birthday ever!” Peter yelled and ran over to her. “She doesn’t look changed at all. My birthday wishes finally came true. I can’t wait for her to wake up!”
Tony leaned into Steve as they walked into the living room. There sat the other three of their friends.
Tony handed her the wand again and she held it in her hand. “I can it. It’s almost like it’s glowing. I can’t see, sir, how can I see this?”
Walking back to her bedroom Violet grabbed her real violin and a dress in a cover bag. She changed into the school uniform and walked out of the house. Without saying goodbye or anything she ran to the bus stop.
“I miss you all. I wanna be home again. I want to be in the penthouse with you and Violet,” Peter cried into Tony’s shoulder.
“Tony, are you doing alright?” Clint asked and sat next to him on the couch. “You're looking a bit paler than usual.”
“Tony let the kids do this. We got men on the ground that need their asses kicked anyway. Spiderman clearly can handle himself.” Dr. Strange told them and started making a circle with his magic. “Both of you go through my portal. It will bring you the closet humanly possible without flight.”
Steve stood when the doctor came out of the room. “Doctor Cho, how is he? Is everything okay from our trip?”
Luna nodded and laid her head on his shoulder curling into him closer. The blood in her hair went on his shirt.
“I am staying here with you. My two kids are more than happy. Let’s find coffee together.” Clint got up and shook Nat, “Hey, we are getting coffee. Did you need something?”
“In America. New York to be exact. You have a very concern husband waiting for you.” Sam held Tony up by the arm as they walked out of the plane.
Tony watched the boy and got into the limo after his friends and husband. “Can we just go to the store and buy beer to go home with? I just want to hang out with you guys. At home so then Jarvis can drink as well.”
“Why don’t you go play with Pepper as well? She can help you find a better hiding spot after you find your sister.” Tony looked up at Pepper. “Please, take him out of here.”
“Yes. Decides a few things that we will worry about in the future, but for right now they want you.” Bruce smiled at the couple as they each picked up one of the babies.
"Get the fuck away…" Growled Stane as he pushed Tony hard, no one notices the sound of ripped clothes, as for Stane he starts his daily beating making Tony curl into a small ball trying to protect his head as much as he can. After what seems like eternity Stane huffed as he straightened himself, he then left the cell closing the door with him.
All of Steve’s hope of Tony calming down was thrown away in the wind when he let out a snarl after spotting Howard. “You!” Tony tried to move toward Howard, probably planning to kill him, after all, the Alpha was growling and hissing and planning to kill someone, and Steve wasn’t petty enough to stay still and allow his mate to kill his father, even when the said father was an asshole.
." She sneered, causing Johann to shiver in his place as she walked back into formation, looking at the huge blond and his black hair companion, newcomers, Steven noticed.
"I saved someone's life, and gained them in the process." The Omega said shortly, which made the Alpha scowl at the answer but he ended up crossing his arms and looking at the Omega for a long time before he tilted his head to the side as if thinking hard about something, the Omega's heart pounded in his chest, waiting for the Alpha's final words, praying for Frigga and Loki that they will listen to him and help him save the innocent lives of his friends.
"Hey, let's take you to your room, you can sleep if you want, it will make the pain go away." Steve said gently, making sure to keep his voice down, the Alpha only blinked at that and turned to Steve like only now he realized that Steve was in the same room with him, something that the Omega didn't blame the Alpha for knowing that he had a tough time already, Steve was able to lead the man to his room and put him to bed, he was finally able to breathe, the whole journey Steve had to support the Alpha's weight, and the man was not small at all, and not to forget how the man kept staring at his face nonstop, which did make the Omega a little uncomfortable. After making sure the Alpha was situated on his bed, in a dark room, he left the Alpha to sleep, taking his phone out and sending a text to Tony, informing the man to go to the drug store and bring medicine for migraine, hoping that James will wake up without pain…
"I… I brought you something…" Steve said, his happiness shifted into nervousness, which made the Omega's heart pound in his chest, part intrigue and another part scared, wondering what was the reason that turned his Alpha into this nervous mess. Steve though only pulled him to the sofa, and pulled Tony in his arms making the Omega shift until he was sitting sideways in the Alpha's embrace gazing at the man with big eyes waiting to see what was going to take place. "Here…" Steve murmured as he gave a covered book to the Omega, something that caused the Omega to raise his eyebrow at that.
"Mr. Stark… am hungry." The pup said after the two of them finished their work in the lab, Peter's words made Tony blink and look up from his cleaning.
"Tony, where are you? Tell me what the hell happened outside, were you attacked by the enemy?" Rhodey asked as he power walked to where Dum-E was wheeling around the place. Crutching down Rhodey raised his brow at the sight Tony was making, covered by the fuzzy pink blanket with the equal fuzzy baby blue pajamas, the ice-cream containers not that far from his leg. "Tones what happened?" Rhodey asked, concern coloring his voice as he took Tony in, probably wondering why Tony looked like this, the only time Rhodey ever saw Tony like this was the day that his parents turned into zombies.
"I… I have a child…" Steve choked out, tears running down his face as Bucky tightened his hold, even more, not allowing Steve to move his body away, not even an inch; as much as Steve ordered his body to move, his legs were frozen in place, terror coursing through his body.
The Alpha shook his head and sighed as he hanged up the phone looking at Peter then Tony. "I'm fine… I'm just stressed up." The Alpha ran his hand through his beard with a thoughtful look on his face as his eyes went to Peter who was playing not paying the adults any attention. "I came to drop Peter off, but it seems like my mother was called to work, Bucky and his family aren't home, and I can't take Peter with me because today I have to finish the latest chapter of my comic… oh God, this is a nightmare." Steve said as he runs his hand through his hair, looking like his mind was going a mile a second, which made Tony wince at that.
He should get rid of the child, it will be so easy, getting rid of a child that will bring nothing but pain and hurt and possibly hurt his friends and James. What need did Steven have for a child that didn't take its first break? A child that was the Hydra King's… but that will be a little biased, after all, he did have a child from that monster, a child with a big heart and even big dreams and hopes… a child that was the reason Steven was sane until this moment…
"You don't need to love someone to fuck them, Mr. Rogers." Mr. Stark replied which made the Omega bit his cheek to stop him from screaming at the man. "Well, that was Anthony's case, it was funny how you really believed that he could ever love you… a child. You have three days to leave before you will be evacuated by force or worse." The Alpha said as he turned around to leave but he paused a little and turned toward Steve who was shaking so badly he thought he was going to fall. "A word of advice Mr. Rogers, A child can't know what love is." That was Mr. Start's last words before leaving Steve in the living room.
It took a few seconds before everyone finally saw him, and when they did everyone become quiet as they took him in various degrees of surprise and not so surprisingly pleasant expression (Natasha and Bucky) "Tony… what happened?" Bruce asked, adjusting his glass and blinked hard as if the image in front of him will be banished if he did that and the real Tony will show up.
Tony wasn't sleek and silent like Rogers was, he didn't move through the land and then later lake with agile grace. With every step Tony took inside the lake after he reached it, the water froths and churns around him, stirring up mud and debris. His action did nothing but cause Rogers to tilt his head, humming when Tony came to stand in front of him, treading through the water to keep afloat.
Bruce presses his lips into a thin line trying to think of something. "Steve, I can't tell you what to do and what not to do, that's your thing, but tell me honestly, do you see yourself with the Omega and his pup in the distant future?" The Beta asked gently making Steve pause at that. "If you can answer that question than you know the answer to your question, as for you not being able to take care of the Omega… have you seen yourself when you volunteer in the clinic or in the hospital, people adore you, especially children, you are a good man Steve, don't let your doubts ruin that for you." Bruce's words made a smile take over Steve's face and he looked at the Beta.
As the worst thing anyone can do is forbid Steve from doing something, his spine straightened at that comment. “Thank you for your expert advice into my love life, Mr. Stark, but I believe I can manage myself.”
“And yet, time marches on,” Tony said with a sigh. “Explain to me how anything gets fixed by telling Triangle Steve that I’m dying.”
Tony hoped it was too dark to see the blush that he knew had crept onto his face at the mention of Triangle Steve, the Sexy Cellist. “My pleasure. He’s one of our default performers for SI events, and Pep said he’s a dream to work with.”
Harold and Coraline looked at each other for a second, and Steve’s heart skipped a beat that maybe he and Tony would still be like that in fifty years. “You can put us down for five hundred thousand over the next five years,” Harold said decisively.
Steve gestured to the open rocks next to him. He’d situated himself on the wide rocks that formed a jetty in the part of the island in order to catch the sunrise over the ocean. In the three weeks he’d been working with Tony, he’d only caught sunrises so far when Tony worked up to them. Tony had completed one of the stages of the prototype the day before and had released Steve on a four-day weekend.
It had started about a year and a half ago, when he found out that Steve donated his fee from the Maria Stark Gala to the foundation with a note that said, “It’s my policy to not take money from cancer research. Thank you for the honor of providing your entertainment.” Pepper and Tony had immediately booked him for the next eight Stark Industries events, and began to talk him up to everyone they knew that ran galas and the like.
Bucky clasped Steve on the shoulder. “Just because you can’t fuck Tony, doesn’t mean you need to be fucking Random McGee. Dildos exist.”
Tony heard from everyone that Steve was polite, professional, and absolutely never went home with anyone, no matter how hard the person flirted. He lived in an apartment in Red Hook with four other people, had put himself through Berklee Conservatory of Music in Boston by working at a UPS sorting facility - which was colosassly idiotic for someone whose hands were going to be his living - and then had immediately moved back to the block he was born on.
It took another few moments for the man to fully be able to take a deep breath without a shudder, but as soon as he did, he began to shiver. “Oh, pal, take my coat.” Steve peeled off his worn leather jacket and placed it around the man’s (smaller but no less muscular, and
“No, me and Ma, Buck and Erskine, they’re the only ones,” Steve said, with a tone of sadness. “So now, it’s just me.”
“No one bullies Tricia into anything,” Tony replied as he took a slow sip of his drink. “She was looking for a cello player. I know a good one.”
Without opening his eyes, Tony said. “Great, there’s a cake shop about three blocks down. Pull in there.”
They were quiet for a few minutes, simply holding hands and sitting in the silence. Finally, Tony spoke.
Tony decided to let it go- this time. “Yes, I did. I figured it would be something fun for me and Petey-pie to do once I get some more practice. Jarvis cooked with me, back in the day. Ana, too. I hope you enjoy it!” With that, Tony presented Steve his actual plate, and Peter the plastic plate with Dora the Explorer on it.
Steve had met Peter when he and Tony had been official for about six months. Peter knew his dad had a boyfriend - he was ten and not stupid, as he casually informed Tony - and was most excited that Mr. Steve knew how to draw. Born with underdeveloped lungs, Peter was always looking for new indoor activities to do while his breathing treatments ran their course.
“It’s warm,” Tony countered, pushing up the sleeves again. Steve was at least three sizes bigger than Tony in the shoulders, based on the way the leather jacket hung off Tony’s frame.
"Daddy! You won't believe what Uncle Bucky d… Daddy, why is Mr. Steve in bed with you?" Peter's innocent question made Tony and Steve speechless, the embarrassment and horror muting their voice as they turned to Peter who was gazing at them with a confused look hugging his bear in his arms as he looked from Tony to Steve and back again.
The king swallowed, his eyes darted from side to side before stilling on Steven who shuffled in his bed until he was sitting up, pushing the furs away from him and relaxing when he saw that his clothes were still on. "What… what kind of information?" The king finally gathered the courage to ask, and part of Steven wanted to scream and curse at how the king was playing the innocent game, why would he lie about the information that Steven gave to the king? Information that made him win most of his wars against Johann.
"Are you sure about this?" Steve asked after breaking the kiss, pulling Tony toward him, getting nothing but a cheeky smile from the Omega who then crawled in his lap and start kissing him once again, causing Steve to let out a happy sigh, nuzzling Tony's cheek after they broke the kiss.
"How dare you say I will do of such a sinister act?" Thor snarled, only to decide to calm himself when Steven throws him an alarming glance, requesting of him to quit this right now. "To answer your questions…" Thor sends a deadly glare at Clint who frets at being exposed to such an expression from a friend. "Stars are the grandest and the most powerful being in the universe, no one can match or dream of acquiring magic like theirs, they are also the realms keepers who recorded the history since the dawn of time, every act performed since the dawn of the universe are recorded in their archives. Because of their divine magic, evil forces tried everything in their capacity to gain their powers, but it is futile to best the stars when they are in their true form or their astral forms. Because of that, a number of spells, curses, and enchantments were created to bound the stars in frail bodies, like Midgardian, to be able to best them. Out of all the spells only one worked, and it bounded the star in a body that suppressed their magic and capabilities, that way, the caster of the spell can overpower the stars, with that, it's simply the matter of ripping the heart and consuming it. My father made certain to wipe out every spell or enchantment that work in an identical way, not only stars' magic should remain as theirs, but those who dare to obtain it in such a loathsome way shall be burdened with madness for the rest of their long life, the last star that fell was six thousand years ago, and ever since then Asgard took it as our duty to protect the Ancient one from such a destiny, I dread how the Witch of Scarlet got her hand on an enchantment that bound the Ancient One in this body, I am certain that my mother and father were already warned by Heimdall, it's merely the matter of time before they discover a means to Midgard." Thor gives an encouraging smile to Steven, overlooking how wide everyone's eyes were at the knowledge they obtained, Mrs. Carter though had a decided expression on her face, as if she was bracing to go in a battle for him which made Steven feel a little sad for her.
Finally reaching the town, Tony's lips were pulled into a snarl when he saw everyone stand still and gaze at him with wide eyes like they couldn't believe he was there. Part of Tony wanted to snarl and turn back, ignoring the people around him and ignoring how they start whispering to each other while pointing at him; the other part, the dominating part, hissed and spat as Tony continued his way, promising hell to everyone coming near him. right now, Tony was on a hunt, a hunt that will determent if he was going to stay here or to flee, this time, this time he was going to fly out of the country, maybe to France or Italy, hell even Ireland sounded good.
"Got moving you, runt!" One of the men shouted as he pushed the pup hard, making him fall to the ground only to stand up and bite the man's hand, which made the man backhanded the pup, something that Steven never saw anyone do, considering that most people fear hurting their kings' children least their punishment was death.
"Is that so?" Stane whispered in Tony's ear and he flinched at the closeness of the bigger man, and he took an unconscious step toward the lake. Suddenly a strong wind came and nearly knocked Tony down, trees rustled and leaves start falling down the trees who were shaking like they were going to fall; when Tony strained his ear his body froze when he heard the familiar rustling he usually hears under his house, Stane seemed to pick up on it too, because when he turned around and gaze at the place with a strange look on his face. "Who is there?" Stane snarled as he turns around waving his gun.
"Stop here, please," Tony told the taxi driver, paying the man his fee when they stopped in front of his house. Getting out of the car, Tony relaxed when he saw Steve and Peter already waiting for him outside. "Steve…" Tony whispered tiredly, walking toward his husband who rushed toward them. It was a few seconds later before Steve stood in front of Tony and Harley, checking them both for injuries before pulling them to his embrace.
"Yes, just yours and mine, no one else." Steve smiled as he said those words, which caused Peter's eyes to widen in delight, and for a small 'Oh' to leave him. "Why don't we go inside? I'm sure, that Tony will love to have your answer." Steve offer, getting a shy nod from Peter who took his hand when the two of them stood up, Steve doesn't even know what Tony will think of how bashful his son starts acting as, it was as if it was the first time he met Tony again.
OK, so it wasn't Tony's fault, to begin with, it was Howard? Right? After all who in their right mind would let their twenty years old kid live on while believing that his parents are dead? It is too cruel! It was true that Tony was not all that warm and chummy with his parents, but he loved them, he always seeks their approval one way or another; Tony even when he was angry with his parents for abandoning him most of his childhood and teenage years, he was proud to be their son. So for his parents to give him away like a used doll and abandoning Tony without even a word of goodbye is unforgivable! No matter what anyone was going to say, this was something that Tony couldn't (Wouldn't) forgive.
…" The king hummed behind him, his right hand ran on Steven's left arm, taking a hold of the sleeve's top and pulls it harshly ripping it gazing at the sleeve as it flutters until it falls on the ground, showing Steven's bicep, the harsh and shocked exclaims coming from the Vikings made the servants shiver and look at the queen whose face became dark. "I see, so you are nothing but a stolen relic." The king said as he circled Steven once more and gazing at his arms frowning at the bruises he saw and the traces of shackles on the Omega's wrist, but his eyes didn't stay long, his eyes found what they searched for, the rune that was engraved in the Omega's bicep.
A hushed voice murmured, causing the hair on the back of Steve's neck to stand on its ends; Steve shifted in his place, gazing at his side and shook Tony causing the Alpha to open his eyes and frown at Steve, only to wake up when Steve's terrified eyes gaze back at him. "Who are you?" Steve hissed, trying not to stutter as he opened the speaker on Tony's cue.
Steve could only stare at his hands in shock, his mind refusing to make a sense of what he was told a few hours ago; part of Steve was still thinking that he was crazy, that this was all just a dream, and that he would wake up once more in the bathroom, fearing for his life as his stalker knocked on the door to scare him. Johann Schmitt, that's the name of the man who stalked him, a known serial killer and rapist, who targets male Omegas, was shot and killed when the police managed to come just in time... A stalker who managed to stay hidden for over eight years ago was caught and killed yesterday.
"Can we talk Tony?" Bucky asked, the tired look on his face made Tony shift and shuffle uncomfortably in his stand. "Please… we gave you as much time as you wanted to clear your mind, now allow us to tell our side of the story." Bucky pleads, causing Tony to frown and look at his legs.
Tony doesn't know how long he stayed sitting in his chair after Peggy throws him and Bucky on them, glaring at them until they stopped with their plan of breaking into the operation room; all that Tony knows is he is one step closer to a mental breakdown. He can't do it, he can't, Tony can't live without Steve; if anything happened to Steve, Tony can't go on, he can't, he doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know how to take care of Peter. Oh God, Peter! What would the little boy do when he realizes that his mother was dead, that the only family he knew is gone forever, his son will hate him for the rest of his life, he will blame Tony for what happened, and he was not wrong in his blame either, because it was Tony's fault, it was Tony's fault, if only he paid more attention, this wouldn't have happened. Tony was sure he was crying; he was sure that he shed tears as he tried to stop his shaking, he knew that he was one minute away from doing something stupid… if Steve didn't survive, then he will… he will…
She wasn't aware of the eyes that were watching her, and when the lightning lit the room once more, the shape of a person sitting on the ceiling could be seen, and it was looking at the woman with wide red eyes, taking her in. Natasha turned around fast when she felt eyes on her, but she didn't see anyone in the kitchen no matter where she looked, the lights start flickering on and off, making the woman's breath speed up and she gulped… what was going on?
Though Steve could do without his son taking Tony Stark as his rule model in the engineering world, his pup took a strange fascination to the man, always telling Steve about the invents that the Alpha made, it made Steve concern that Peter recognize his father, but the pup only had an old picture of his father, and Anthony looked so different from Tony Stark that someone might consider them two different people. Steve let it go to the fact that Tony Stark was considered the most genius inventor in all of America after his father, that when he wasn't chasing skirts half of the times, May thought that it was cute how the pup got someone to look up to, so after May persuading him, he finally let it go.
"Help me!" A banshee shrieked which made Thor whine and take a step back, shaking like a leaf, wishing desperately that he had Mjolnir with him but unfortunately for him, he saw the hammer fall into the lava, which meant that it either melted if the lava before him was that of Hel, or that it will burn his hands to even touch the hammer if this was one of Loki's illusions.
The king's eyes narrowed when he saw that Loki and Nattalegg were waiting for him near the cellar's door, an amused smile taking over Loki's face, while Nattalegg's eyes were wide with disbelieve. "Asgardian protects their people, no matter who they are, you shouldn't have made the Omega into a slave my king… I hope you enjoy burned food for the rest of his stay." Loki said with laughter in his voice, which made the king snarl at the Alpha and push him out of his way, continuing his plan of going to the deck and calming himself before returning to the Omega and kill him for his foolish decision.
Even his friends who were shocked about Howard finally showed up, couldn't help but laugh when he and Sarah start trying to one-up each other to be Peter's favorite; the little brat seemed to be enjoying it, which was good. Peter had pout for a whole hour when he realized that Harley couldn't come with them to their outing, he nearly starts crying about how unfair it was, only calming down when Steve promised him that they all could take Harley to the movies next week, all of them even Tony, so he could finally meet the boy who seemed to be Peter's best friend.
"Sorry brat, you do not have anything I am interested to tread you the Shield for, thank you for the story though, it was fun." Anton grinned, herding the kids outside of his workshop and ignoring the complaints about him being mean and a trickster…
"Well, tell your fucking boss to go and fuck himself, because I ain't coming with you." Steve hissed and was about to slam the door shut but was stopped by the Alpha who put his hand on the door to keep it open, which caused Steve to growl at that and hiss at the man. "What the fuck do you want?" Steve snapped hoping that his voice wasn't loud enough to attract the attention of his family and son.
"Why are you asking? It's not like you Addams aren't planning on killing me after I marry Steve; isn't that why you told me about your husband, a subtle threat?" Tony asked, raising his head, glaring at Serpentine daring the woman to say no to his words, after all, Tony never heard of a Normal marrying an Addams in the twenty-one century, and even if they did, their relationship would probably be doomed just like Serpentine and her husband; the crazy ghost giggled (Giggled!) when she talked about killing him! So what would make his marriage with Steve any different?
"You are awake my queen." He turned his head when he heard the familiar voice talk, a small smile taking over his face as he saw who the speaker was, the young adult who called him was bowing for him, but he can see the small relieved smile on her face, and the happiness of seeing him shining in her eyes.
It took time before the four of them finally got comfortable in their own home without the shadows of Peggy Carter dominating their minds. Tony making sure not only to redecorate the house from top to bottom, replacing the broken picture frames, the china, and even the furniture; but also updating their security and J.A.R.V.I.S. giving the A.I. and the house another power source to function on, a power source that no can temper with, no matter how smart they think they are… the Arc-Reactor.
With a stuttering breath, Tony wrenched the closet door open the rest of the way, his heart pounding madly in his chest at the thought of him catching the person who entered his own home without permission. Instead of finding someone inside, Tony was confused at the empty closet in front of him; it wasn't strange that the closet was empty, not when Tony still hasn't unpacked his baby's clothes yet. At least Tony thought that there will be someone there, not the closet being empty and all.
is not home at this moment, and you shouldn't be here either, especially with you having a restraining order against you," Tony stated as he crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at the woman whose eyes widen and a dark look taking over her face in the following seconds.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, blood and violence, and a lot of crying! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
After a long time of silence, Zemo hummed a nasty smile taking over his face which made Tony tense unconsciously. "As you wish, Mr. Stark… to cut this short, you are going to help me get all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s data and information, oh, and let's not forget about the nuclear codes that I know you can hack for me." These words made Tony pause before he started laughing hard, his actions causing the man to frown.
"He didn't mean it, you know?" Tony said which made Steve look at him with a frown, which caused the Omega flush and look at his hands that were twisted together, a nervous habit he notice the Omega use more often than not. "He is just stress, everyone knows that he doesn't sleep, and prefer to walk in the halls at night." Tony said in his way to defend Steven, which made the Alpha suppress the urge to roll his eyes and look away from the Omega.
"What did you just say?" Tony hissed, leaving his cup on the counter and came to face Rogers who was looking at him with boredom in his eyes, something that scared Tony as much as it made him angry. "Am I done? Are you even listening to yourself? What's wrong with you? You are my boyfriend, it's within my right to ask about your wellbeing and question why you have been holing yourself into your room with a fucking Omega who by the way isn't me!" Tony wasn't shouting, but he might as well have been with how loud his voice was.
Tony looks out over the lake, the water still and dark... he should get out, he knows that he should go back into town with the brunette, apologize for taking up her time and gets the fuck out of Shield… but where would he go? Tony looked down at his hands, at the bruises on his knuckles, and sets his jaw. "Can someone give me a hand moving the stuff outside? Hopefully tomorrow…" Tony asked the woman seeing her eyes widen at his words as she looked at him like he lost his mind, but her face returns neutral a second later.
"You talk like you have the right to decide your fate." The king said as his eyes gazed at the Omega with an amused look in them which made the Omega growl and hiss at the Alpha, causing the Alpha to smirks darkly. "You amuse me Omega, especially with the way you think, what will you even do when you are behind the bars?" The king asked as he took a step toward the Omega, a laugh leaving him when the Omega snarled and thrust his hand through the bars hoping to catch the Alpha and choke him to death but the man was fast to avoid the raging Omega.
The only thing Tony could feel though was pain and hurt; how could he? How could Rogers say that to him after six months? After he told him he loved him! It was the anger that won in the end, the anger at Rogers for what he did, and the anger at himself for falling for that Alpha, he should have listened to Peggy and Steven when they warned him. "You are a bastard Rogers!" Tony screamed and took the closet thing next to him and throws it at the Alpha, which was his cup that was full of hot coffee.

Bucky looked at the Alpha before him shuffling his feet, he doesn't know how to act around Stark anymore, it was surprising to know that the Alpha that finally gains his respect was Steve's ex-Alpha, and he wondered if a day of truths will make decades of hate go away, but seeing the Alpha suffering before his eyes, crying out for his mate and child, it made Bucky swallow, because as much as Tony and him didn't deserve Steve, the Omega needed them, him and his small pup need them. "The hospital that Peter goes to was destroyed in the attack; I gathered that Steve was largely indebted to them, and he is looking for another hospital for Peter, look Stark if you don't want to pay child support I get it, but think about-" Bucky was cut from his rant by a snarling Tony who looked at Bucky like he was ready to kill him.
So he did what he did in the past, he learned about the boy, the All-Tongue helped him to understand the boy's language, he learned that Anton goes by the name Tonton, he was the son of the tribe's chieftain, the place now Anton lives in… he should call him Tonton, it's not fair hanging on someone who was long dead, even if he was reincarnated… will be called north Germany years later.
After Steve took the file from Fury he spent a whole week, investigating what was called the evil league. He got to know a lot of things about its six members, their habits, schedules, and other things he should know about before he launches into his mission. It was easy getting in, that should have been his first clue, but he was too deep into grieve and want to end this mission that he simply didn't care. It ends up with them attacking him all at once, and Steve ends up fighting them all for hours, he was still surprised that he was the last one standing. But unfortunately one of the idiots activated the portal before breaking the control panel, and now the portal was open with no way to close it, and if Steve didn't want the portal to go 'Boom' and do some unsavory damage, he had to do something and fast…
A Viking said pulling the king and Steven's gaze toward the people who were huddling together away from everyone, looking at the queen in confusion and fear, making the king hum at that and turn his eyes to Steven and his child.
"Thanks, Buck, but I think I am done." Grumbled Steve as he stood up, frowning a little when Peggy and Bucky's living room became a little darker, did a lamp broke and he didn't hear? Looking around Steve grumbled as he shuffled on his legs planning on going to his room and hide for the rest of the day; no, Steve will hide in his room until the ball is over and done, he will not show his face even after everything is said and done!
Getting out of the room, Steve saw Tony waiting for the two of them, he didn't mention the Alpha' puffy eyes, which made him think that the Alpha was grateful for that as he stood up and gave them a strained smile when they reached him. "Baby, I am going to go and talk with the doctor, why don't you stay with Mr. Stark for a little bit?" Steve asked which got him a hesitant nod, which made Steve smile and kisses his son on the forehead while giving the Alpha a pointed look, before going to talk with the doctor.
"Damn, I need to get me one of those." Peggy muttered to herself which made everyone blink and look at her, her face was blank but you can see the fascination and amusement in her eyes. "I never saw an Omega shake an Alpha's voice like that; I guess I now knew who wore the pants in that relationship." She said sending Tony a knowing look which the Alpha flush a little but a smile took over his face.
"Drive!" Snapped Steve as he saw everyone look at him with shock, Steve's scream made everyone squeak and drive through the gates to the mansion. When Steve reached the mansion, he had to stop himself from breaking the door.
"I couldn't do it, not without you." Tony stated, making Steve feeling a little flush with embarrassment and pleasure, Tony was always so considerate when he decided to drop the mask he protects himself with; the Alpha was so sweet, and Steve wanted to kiss him like his life depended on it.
… kept chanting inside his head over and over again, causing Steven's breath to pick up. "He…" Whatever harsh reality Nicolaus was going to inform Steven of was cut by the sound of Petrus and James coming near the clearing, calling Steven's name as they squealed and laughed while searching for Steven, no doubt the two of them were roughhousing as they tried to find him.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, anxiety, asthma attack, near mental breakdown, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"…I felt like shit, especially when the Omega came into my office with a gift bag, hoping to see his pup, a gift bag! That contains a toy, and when I ran to return it, the Omega took it and ran away!" Sam sniffed taking another swing, Bucky nods his head not caring that much, after all, he heard a lot more sad stories when he was overseas, and this one was just like any other he heard… or maybe that was his drank mind as the Alpha had gone for the strong stuff first, trying to lessen the horror he felt when his Ma told him about how he should date Steve, and that he and the Alpha will make a great couple, especially raising Peter who adored Bucky… he needs another drink… Steve, on the other hand, runs his hand through his beard thinking, he hasn't drunk anything other than that one beer Loki gave, so he was left to listen to Sam and hopefully give a piece of advice that wouldn't make him feel like shit. "And then… and then I found this paper lying on the floor, and felt even more like a shit!" Sam said as he took the paper from his pocket and slammed in on the bar, the loud noise made everyone look at the trio, and Steve had to sigh and throw Loki an apologetic look which made the Alpha roll his eyes and mutter something under his breath.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, anxiety, fluff, Peter is a precious bean, Tony nearly crying his eyes out the whole chapter, and Steve is a BAMF, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"But Nat, I'm pregnant not an invalid person!" Tony whined, complaining about how everyone in the town practically babysat him and doesn't allow him to do anything just because he was pregnant, which made the woman growl at him, making the teen pout, even more, when Clint snorted and drank his coffee.
That caused Tony to ponder, and he ended up feeling even more like shit when he realized that ever since he met Rogers he did nothing but scream in his face, insult him, and threat him, and yesterday it turned out to physical harm, something that Tony never ever did! Sure Rogers destroyed his mansion, but his teammates done worse to the house than Rogers ever did, sure he turned his beautiful gardens into a Pet Cemetery, at least it was better than Loki trying to rise all those demons possessed cats against them and sure, Rogers had everyone Tony knew under a spell that caused them to fall in love with him, but he never acted physically with them or use them even when they were more than willing.
Zola chuckled at his words, making Steven grind his teeth until they hurt even with the serum running inside his body. "You see Commander, for years now, we have sought to recreate the same serum running inside of your counterpart body; the closest we got to create it was the Winter Soldier…" Steven saw how Zola pulled the rope in his hand roughly, making Bucky stumble before correcting himself as quickly as he can, loathe and fury built up inside Steven. "All of our experiments after that failed, and with your counterpart crushing the Valkyrie in the arctic, all of our hope of recreating stronger soldiers dashed with it. Imagine our surprise though when the dear Captain's body was retrieved from the arctic a year and a half ago, alive even! By that point we realized we can't recreate the serum without Dr. Erskine, who regrettably died years and years ago; but I didn't give up faith, I know that with the strong super-soldier Omega we have and Captain America, we could create the perfect soldiers! Imagine my thrill when you showed up, you! The purest form the serum ever conceived! With no instincts, no werewolves gens, no secondary gender to oppose you, you are the ideal candidate to help Hydra rise from the ashes!" Zola crow in triumphant, causing Steven's eyebrow to twitch in irritation, his glare increases ten volts daring Zola to try something.
Steve looked at him with soft eyes. "Oh, Tony…" Steve whispered his voice raw, and then Steve kissed him, kissed more love into his cheeks and lips and hair. Tony trembled as Steve held him through it too. The overwhelming sensation of it all threatens to lull Tony into a sweet sleep, but the Omega fought it, wanting to soak in every second of the moment. Steve though must have felt his fatigue, because he smoothed Tony's hair back and kisses him one last time as he held him.
Thor on the other hand instead of smiling and patting Peter's head and accepting the story as a childish dream like how Tony's family and friends did, he did the opposite; Thor was frowning, there was a thoughtful look on his face, which caused everyone who was sitting in the living room (All the Avengers minus Bucky and Steven who were training in hand to hand this time) to tilt their heads in confusion. "It seems that the youngling is truthful in his words, you have a great fortune of good luck brother Stark… it seems that you are blessed!" Thor called out with a smile on his face, which made Tony give a dumb 'Huh?' and gaze at Thor with a raised eyebrow, silently ordering him to continue.
Steve heard someone call out, making him groan and try to open his eyes, which made whoever was in the room, with his talk in a frantic voice putting their hands on his shoulders trying to ease him into the soft mattress he was lying on. That made Steve opens his eyes then closes them, hearing voices talking above him. Steve tried to open his eyes one more time, and when he did his breath hitch in his lungs. "T…Tony…" Steve whispered brokenly raising his trembling hand toward the figure that was looking at him with a strange look…
Margaret squeaked at Steven, which made Steve get rid of the top of the dress and look at Margaret only wearing his pants and pendant which made everyone squeak in embarrassment as they turn around to give him privacy, only Margaret who spent that time looking at him, having looked at Steven while he was naked numerous of times.
"You are an evil man, I hate you." Clint whined as he turned toward Tony, sending him the most pitiful look there was, causing Tony to snort and sit on the loveseat that Steve occupied before, it was only a few minutes later that Steve and Peter returned, taking their seat near Tony. "Now we are going to have a Disney marathon! I really wanted to watch an action movie that we finally had a downtime." Clint pout, sitting on the sofa with Natasha, Bruce, and Thor sitting on the floor, while Bucky and Peggy were occupying the other loveseat, too bad Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy didn't make it tonight.
"I… I failed… 'im… ya know?" Howard slurred then shook his head and blink once again like only now he was seeing Steve… "He like ya… alw… always runnin' after Peg to hear you-r storiesss…" Howard sniffed and hiccupped. "Used to tell 'er new story about ya, so she can tell 'im… I wonder… would he be 'ere iff I follow Peg's plan? Would he, cap?" Howard asked pointing at the room, making Steve look at the door then sigh…
"I'm so tired, Steve, so, so tired…" Tony whispered tiredly, hiding his face in the Alpha's neck, shivering when the Alpha kissed his forehead, causing him to let out a shaky sigh as he let the Alpha's comforting scent surround him, his muscle relaxing in the Alpha's embrace.
Violet walked up to the stand looking at the ground and got help from Peter to sit in the chair. No one could even see her from behind the stand since the table was too high up,
“We can’t believe we are here. We have our own land, well world. Fun rides and everything. All of us have ridden every single ride at least four times,” Rhodey smiled.
Bruce knocked on the door then went in smiling. “I take it that this is her,” He slowly walked over and stood in front of the two women. “Hello, I’m Bruce and I see you already met Nat..”
“Where did she go?” Steve asked them with his red puffy eyes. He leaned into Bucky slightly trying to keep his balance. Steve knew he needed to be strong in front of his daughter, so he would save the tears for later.
He nodded and closed his eyes biting the rag. Since the serum was at play Steve couldn’t have any pain medications or anything.  “Alright, thank you, ma’am,”
Steve pulled Tony close by the wrist and kissed his head. “I know. It’s okay. I have you. It’s okay to cry.”
“When I brought her here she was told what to say. While I went and shoot the man that kills you two. When I go away… she will remember a loving home here with you two. I copied everything from Peter’s memories and added her in them and vise-versa. You all will remember her and this conversation.” Violet took a deep breath and sighed. “I never wanted to hurt you, dad, pops. Truly.”
“You want to adopt a baby? Where did this come from?” Steve asked him while he ate Steve’s homemade lemon chicken and potatoes.
The man with the long beard came off the elevator and stood in a long blue cloak. “Good afternoon. I am Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, Hogwarts is a school of wizarding.”
Luna skipped up to the stage and smiled. “Present!” she yelled before Professor McGonagall got her last name out.
“FUCK YOU! Your such a fucking asshole! NO one will ever love you! You will never get a family, a job or anything! You’ll be the ugliest homeless person alive.”
“There’s the love of my life. Get your ass in here!” Tony told him in a drunk manner. Steve clearly didn’t win the ‘when we can drink again age’.
Everyone in the school was around watching the two embrace one another while whispering. Reporters were already showing up at the school wanting to get information. Pepper was already handling the reporters telling them to leave. The crowd getting even more excited when the rest of the Avengers (but Spider-Man) came into the school.
“She’s trained herself to protect, Peter,” Bucky told him. “It’s crazy that she's done that. Trust me. It’s hard to do.”
“My obgyn told me I was pregnant last month when I went to see her. I didn’t believe her until last week. I bought out the pregnancy tests from the drug store. I used all 400 I bought when you guys were on your mission. I can’t tell him. I can’t tell him he’s gonna be a father when we’re not even married!” Luna sobbed out and held her shirt in her fingers while shaking. “Uncle Bruce, I need him. I need him like we need air. I can’t lose someone again. Please, don’t tell him.”
“Absolutely. Stay with Peter for me, babe.”  Tony kissed Steve and took the blonde hair, blue eye girl down to the lab.
“Pepper, she didn’t want to go to Comic-Con, even though she was jumping out of her skin happy. She said that being blind it would be more like babysitting her. Then she asked us if we were ashamed of her for being our daughter. I don’t know what to do. She was so excited talking about it two months ago that I just figured she would want to go.”
“T-Tony…” Luna yelled from the couch walking slowly around to the living room going as fast as she could to the table holding the Ferby. “Purple!”
“Peter Joseph Rogers-Stark and Violet Maria Rogers-Stark.” Steve smiled and stood above the twins. “Are they healthy?”
Bruce started taking her pulse. “Thank you for being honest. Neither of your dads were ever honest with me. They are even worst patience’s than Aunt Nat, and that’s saying something.”
Getting chemo wasn’t Tony’s favorite thing in the world. Everything hurt from his hair down to his toenails. He didn’t even want to get out of bed most days but forced himself to get up. Tony wanted to live his life with his family while he still had them.
Luna began trembling while running into his arms wrapping her arms around him. Newt rubbed the back of her leg licking the skin on her leg that was visible. “Happy…”
“Queens is in big poverty right now so many homes are being targeted for crime,” Peter told him and looked around. “The little guy deserves to be helped as well as the whole world.”
“Pops!” Luna yelled and grabbed the metal part on Newt’s collar and walked out of the classroom with everything in her hands. The crowds in the hallway were already thick enough that she tripped and went on to her knees letting go of Newt’s metal guide collar.
“Bucky!” I wrapped my arms around him tightly. “We gotta get my things then we need to go. We can fly.”
Tony sighed and nodded. “Alright. Let’s see who we can bribe to let me go home. I can fix myself up from here.”
“Sir, they are outside waiting for you,” Jarvis told him and put his hand on his shoulder. After a minute he turned the boy around into his arms hugging him tightly. “It’s alright, Tony. No one left you here. I have you, my boy.”
Bruce looked at the couple not wanting to get in the middle of there fight, but he knew that they wanted her to be happy. If that meant that she was dulling herself down, then that’s what it was. They just needed to argue about it.
“Just like your, Papa,” Tony told her and got up from the computer going into the kitchen grabbing plates out.
“She will be…” Natasha told him closing the door behind her. “I didn’t believe them when they said you were alive. Man! Now I owe, Bucky, fifty bucks.”
Steve stopped in his tracks and looked down at the girl sleeping in his arms. “Jarvis, just call her Violet. Don’t tell anyone about her being our daughter yet.”
“Peter. That won’t bring her home. I’ve already tried.” Tony told him and walked over to his son slowly. “Come here.”
When the van parked at S.H.I.E.L.D. everyone got out looking at one another. Steve’s plan was crazy, but it had to work.
The rest of the drive was quiet while AC/DC played in the background. Everyone sang along laughing. They weren’t laughing when the front end of the car got shot at. Blood splattered the divider. The limo flipped on to its’ side causing Steve and Tony to land on top of Bucky, Sam, and Rhodey.
Two weeks later the couple were parents in the real world. They landed in New York two hours before their friends came over to meet the newest addition to there family.
“Hey, how is everyone?” Steve walked in straight to the kids not speaking to anyone else. “Are you both okay?”
Tony looked hurt but held back his emotions when he spoke. “Why wouldn’t she invite us? We never get to see her play.”
“Give us an hour with the girl, then we will talk about who gets her,” Steve told him and looked over at the girl who hasn’t moved since they sat down.
She nodded and helped him sit on the bench then climbed up herself. Peter yawned and curled into Violet sucking his thumb.
After an hour and a half of shushing and rocking both of the twins were back to sleep leaving Tony and Steve in their room. “I can not believe that the kids have powers. I love it! They are the next generation of the Avengers!”
“Not sure… I’m not so sure. She’s not gonna be the same! It’s my fault. ” Tony told him and leaned back in the chair. It was obvious that he hasn’t slept in the past two days.
The whole room was decorated in fake flowers. Each flower had a different character from movies and tv shows they watched together. The tables were decorated as different Disney princesses. Everything was glittery. Just looking anyone could tell it was there wedding. Piano and violin players were playing theme songs to their favorite movies and shows as well.
Bucky wrapped his arms around her tight and kissed her head. His metal arm holding her bottom. She hated being carried, but she liked feeling safe in his arms. “I’ve got you. I have you, Luna.”
Luna bit her lip and stared at the bed. “Bruce, I need to be honest with you then. Though I need you to promise me you won’t tell Peter anything.”
“Jarvis!” Tony screamed and crawled over Steve to break the divider. “JARVIS!” Tony screamed louder and crawled through the hole he made. “I didn’t give you permission to die!”
“Daddy wait!” Peter wiggled out of Tony’s arms and ran up to one of the female reporters. “Ma’am you took Violet's jacket and that’s called stealing. Can we please have it back? She has her dolly in the pocket that Papa gave her.”
Luna leaned into his touch and pulled his face down and kissed him. “I have the biggest crush on you… I need you to distract me, Peter.”
Tony bit his bottom lip and lied through his teeth. “Steve has emotions he needs to figure out so if we separate for a while it’ll be okay…”
The men started fighting in the back not sparing anything in the booths to throw at one another. Once they ran out of things they started getting physical. It all ended with one blow. Steve punched Tony in the arc breaking the top of it. Shocking Steve back to reality.
Violet made visual on her fathers with Rhodey and Sam, and Aunt Nat,  Aunt Wadna with Uncle Vision then looked seeing who else was fighting. The god Thor, Hawkeye, Dr. Strange and Ant-Man with his sidekick the Wasp.
“Violet, you know that your our daughter and Peter is your brother, don’t you?” Tony asked hoping that she did.
“Yes. It’s just good to know we have family everywhere. Magical and real world. It’ll help for the future. What everything has to offer us. We can do anything we wish for now on.”
Luna stood with the others away from the scene letting the two have their moment. Once he was gone she snapped. She sat in the sand looking at the water. Natasha walked over and placed a hand on her shoulder. “He’s gone.”
“Peter, baby doll, how did a spider do this to you?” Steve picked the baby up being careful of Violet’s head. When he roved the web from Peter’s finger it just grew back on his finger while the baby just giggled. “M-m D-d” Peter mumbled.
Soon enough Luna went downstairs holding the rail. She could hear Steve and Tony talking in the kitchen louder. She hid behind the wall listening in on her parent's conversation with Aunt Pepper on the phone.
“I’ll go get the helicopter setup…” Luna told him and went out into the hall. She was happy that no one seemed to notice how badly she was hurt. She didn’t want to talk about it or even about how she was involved with something that stupid.
“Take it easy. Peter take her down to the medics. Make sure she eats. We are in big trouble with S.H.I.E.L.D. If we aren’t home by eight tomorrow go to the compound.” Tony kissed both of there heads and laid Violet in Peter’s arms. “Be safe.” He flew off the others.
“This has to be my favorite holiday!” Luna squealed and took a sip of her water. “Ever since I got my eyesight it’s been even more amazing.”
“I think we're alone now. It doesn’t seem like no one else is around!” Peter sang back and did the robot.
Tony sighed. “I said I can’t wait to see everything with you. Do think you think that's what made her upset?”
Taking a deep breath she sat up and got back on the broomstick. “For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness,” she took a deep breath and flew off back to the beach.
The prisoner looked up from his legs and at her with his green eyes. “Thank goodness I was so worried about you,” he whispered.
They walked in silence until they reached the front of the falcon staircase. She gripped her arms tighter looking up at the man. “I can make it back to my room from here. Thank you so much, Hagrid.”
“Come on! We need to dance, Luna.” Peter told her while taking her hand into his. When she turned around Peter tapped his watch while walking off with her.
The landed the plane into the water. Was he dead? How am I alive? Luna did she know where he was? Where is she?! “Hello?”
I walked out of the home I built with my bare hands and got in the car. The five-minute drive to Peter’s house was quiet. I parked the car outside of the building and went into the elevator. “Karen, please bring me to Peter.”
Tony just kept walking gripping Steve’s hand. “We’ll be okay. Just keep walking Pete. We can play a game of I spy until we get to the car.”
“I know it is. But I have a company to run as well. Peter, what if I screw up? I hate this!” Luna yelled and laid her head into her hands. “I’m sorry I yelled.”
Tony watched his twins walk around the expo smiling and walking around. Peter held MJ’s hand in one hand and his first born sons in the other. Violet walked behind him alone holding her prosthetic arms that’s she’s had since she was six looking at the floor like she was thinking hard about something.
“Can you even find your way back to the school?” Hagrid asked and put his hand on his hips. When she never responded he helped her on to her feet.
“Dad! Papa! Look it’s the glass plates of your faces! The stand should be here somewhere,” She giggled and set them both on the island. “So how do you know my parents, Peter?” Luna asked him and smiled pushing her hair back behind her ear. Peter couldn’t stop looking at her. He loved how innocent she was to the world. She clearly understood more than others but pretended not to.
“Any time my love. “But just know, I call dibs on being called dad!” Tony kissed his head and went into the living where he found Bruce. “Well, Bruce. I guess the next generation will have Avengers that come from Cap and me.” He sighed and sat down. “Promise me he will be alright.”
Luna skipped out in a purple dress with three layers of sparkles while holding her glasses in her hand. Tony had made the glasses that spoke to her when no one was around to tell her where everything was. The glasses are pink with butterfly wings going towards her hair. The left lens was cloudy blue and the other cloudy red.
Going into Babies ‘R’ Us made Tony feel like he was in heaven. He was picking things out left and right for the twins. Steve smiled watching him going back and forth taking Peter after Tony started holding a ton of things in his arms. He had at least six outfits for each of the twins.
Steve sighed and pulled his family in closer. “We want to go with you, but we can’t. We have to help here and take care of your dad. You know that right?”
It took her twenty minutes to get one arm then another five to get the other arm on. She got dressed in the black dress but left her hair the mess it was. She wasn’t even going to try getting her new fingers stuck in her hair.
“Hi, all of you. Come on in. Sorry if things are a mess we just came back from England.” Tony told them and walked into the house with everyone behind them. “This is my husband, Steve and are friends. Sam, Rhodey, and Bucky. Since we are just talking shop you probably won’t meet screaming beauty.”
After cooking for over an hour and burning two spatulas breakfast was finally ready to serve. “Kids, breakfast! Come on!” Tony yelled and could hear the pitter patter of feet running to the kitchen.
With knowing everything Tony did he began to transfer a copy his mind into the computer system. Between treatments, he would go down into the lab and recorded videos of him talking about anything he could think about. Mainly to Luna on her wedding day, and graduating college and high school. Things he was never going to be able to attend. He was never going to see his baby girl in her wedding dress. Never walk her down the aisle. He hated that more than anything else. He wasn’t going to be there for his family.
Violet looked at her hands. “My powers. I have made a serum that was to trigger her memory and send me back when she figured out who you all were. She is using her powers without even knowing she is using them. Though she will be worn out tomorrow. These are my normal arms. When I was born I had no bones in my arms. So, Dr. Banner, you cut my arms off and gave me these prosthetics. I have always had these and learned that it’s okay to have them. Though teasing at the music school did get a bit rough.” She laughed nervously.
Walking to the elevator, I went down to the car and drove to the graveyard and parked in front of our father's statues. Slamming the car door I sat on the grass laying back having my body being across both of the graves.
They had taken him to the park once, but Peter stood there and cried watching the other kids not knowing how to react to them. The husbands also realized that they couldn’t take him to school because he didn’t know how to control his powers. They didn’t know how to help their son grow up without using his powers in public.
“Bye, kids! Have a good birthday at school! Did we forget something?” Steve asked looking at his husband.
I helped Bruce get us out of my father then down to the lab. After Bruce went upstairs to tell Steve, Pops, that everything was done I went over and took DNA samples of each of the eggs. Once I found out which one was me I made the vitals resemble death and took myself out of the lab and into a lab out of the country before Bruce or dad found out I stole myself.
“I-I can’t choose that.” Peter rubbed his eyes trying to keep the tears away. “I love them both. It’s not fair. Mrs. Judge… promise me that Violet will be with me this time?”
Newt jumped off the couch and ran over to the girl and licked her hand. “It’s a puppy!” Luna squealed and sat down petting the dog.
Steve took a deep breath and sighed. “I wanted to say that I was sorry. For everything. I mean it. Before we go into court today just know that I will let the twins live up here no matter what. They deserve you as a parent.”
“Thank you,” Tony held the scorched Ferby looking at it carefully. He walked back to the room and found Steve playing with her and the other doll in the room. He walked close enough for her to see and spoke. “Look what I have.”
They didn’t hear Bucky’s warning. When they walked out the paparazzi were swarming them. Cameras kept going off and people were yelling their questions.
Tony went downstairs and looked around. When he didn’t see Steve or any of the others he started to have a panic attack. “Steve?!” Tony ran into every room on the first floor yelling out each of their names.
“What should I do?” I asked myself and looked over to see the illusion of my parents. After they died I imagined that every time I came to the graveyard that I would be able to see them. I enjoy it, though sometimes they don’t talk like themselves. But, it’s what I thought of and I can’t take it back.
“Hey one step at a time, kiddo,” Bruce told her and set a hand on her shoulder. “It’s okay. You need to get looked at yourself. Let’s just get back to the helicopter and get you looked at. It’ll just be a minute, I promise.”
Violet and Peter looked up at Steve and got out of there seats. Running to the front where the waiters were. They took immediate action on getting everyone safe.
Everything was how it was when he left so many years ago including the furniture. Everything was old fashion and floral from his mothers taste. The living room had the biggest TV he has ever seen since he woke up from the ice. “Damn, I remember when we bought this. It took my father, Bucky and me to carry the TV in. It was right before we left I bought it for them before I left for the war.”
Steve looked at his shoulder. “Your bleeding. Luna what the hell happened?! Luna, you said you wouldn’t do anything stupid!”
Tony sat down in the chair and looked at the paper in front of him. Pepper put her hand on his shoulder. In his opinion, Pepper was his best lawyer and didn’t want anyone else to represent him. He slowly picked up the pen and signed his name on the X.
The Avengers went off the stage waving while everyone was still asking questions. Tony held Steve’s hand close. “Lu, what do you wanna do first?”
“Tony, she’s gonna be frozen at this age if she can’t remember anything,” Bruce told him and poured her more juice in the cup.
All of Luna’s clothes were covered with the flour. She kept her eyes closed and kept still while Crab and Goyle kept her still. ‘Just stay quiet, it’ll be over soon’ was all she kept thinking.
“We can’t do that, tell her that Friday. That’s soon. We can go and watch other performances so then it doesn't look like we are there for her.” Tony smiled. “We can make out in the back if we get bored.”
Happy drove them in the limo with May who was dressed as Elsa from Frozen. Happy was dressed in a limo driver, so she just assumed that was his costume. Newt jumped into the car and laid on his bed. He was dressed up as the cat Happy. The most adorable costume of the year if you asked Peter.
Tony fell to his knees and began to tear up. “S-Steve…?” He began to wheeze and grip his tie. “Steve? Is it really you? Please tell me I’m not dreaming again. It isn’t fair. Steve?!”
“Violet, you can’t do this,” Peter yelled at me and stood up. “We are fifty-seven years old! We are both married and soon to be married! And we both have kids! Why do you want to give that up?!”
“Go ahead and have some!” Peter smiled and pushed the chocolate chip cookie closer to her. “If you not hungry we can play instead.”
“Can we see her? If we decide she does go? I don’t want her to feel abandoned.” Steve asked and grabbed Tony’s hand tightly.
“Then I will go talk to him and Bruce.” Steve sighed and sat on the bed rubbing her cheek. “We love you, Violet.”
They went into the empty shop and saw rows and rows of black boxes behind the desk. “Hello?” Tony yelled into the shop.
“Peter is starting to wake up. He is in a bit of pain, but his body keeps healing to fast for us to give him anything. We think he will be able to be going home by tomorrow. He regrew his finger while in sugary.” Dr. Dessie told them and looked at the chairs. “How about we sit down to continue?”
“Steve, remember the last mission you were on?” Bucky asked him and sat on the bed with Steve pulling him close to him. Steve automatically laid his head on top of his shoulder curling into him taking up the protection.
“I didn’t do this,” Tony whispered and Steve shrugged his shoulders going with it. Steve and Tony sat down on the couch. “What did you get kiddo?”
Violet followed staying quit griping Peter’s hand tight. Tony and Steve followed them down the elevator. Peter kept sobbing.
“Don’t you dare.” Steve started but it was too late. The twins went through the portal to the rooftop.
It took Tony twenty minutes after the interrogation to get Jarvis backup online. He had called Bruce to come up from the lab to get the body out of the gym and to look over Violet. All he could do was sit and watch her lay in the bed just like they did after the battle of New York. She laid so still very frail. They had changed her into one of the old pairs of PJs she had up in her room.
“She’s not in her head. Please. Steve. Let’s do this the right way.” Tony begged. “What if she tries to hurt Peter?”
Steve couldn’t tell if Peter was just hurt or truly didn’t believe. “No. We are just different. And different is okay. Santa has nothing to do with everything happening.”
“I don’t hate you. I’m mad that you put your life on the line.” Steve told her and sighed. “Just get some sleep. I’m gonna go check on Tony. Thor is gonna stay with you. I love you both. Please behave. I mean it.”
“Sir, Violet is starting to become unconscious and Peter’s suit is becoming too overheat and will need to land ASAP,” Friday spoke into the headset.
“Leaving where baby girl?” Tony asked and put a hand to her forehead getting Jarvis to scan her brain waves.
“I see two humans. I bet the Avengers would come here faster knowing that I had you.” Loki told them and held up his staff.
The pair disappeared into her bedroom. Her room was painted yellow with butterflies hanging around the room. Trees were painted on the walls with clouds and the sun shining above her crib. Fairies were flying around and unicorns standing in the background. Perfect for this little girls imagination.
She nodded and kissed both of them on the cheek and walked through the portal to the platform. She kept her glittery Hello Kitty bookbag close along with her cane.
“She really loves Halloween,” MJ commented leaning on her husband Ned. They got married six weeks ago and just came back from there honeymoon. They start working for S.R.I. next week. “I thought she was excited on a daily base, but this is crazy.”
“SHE’s not going anywhere without us,” Steve told him and took Luna’s hand handing her to Rhodey. “Take her to the house.”
Tony took Steve’s hand and smiled. “We wanted to announce to everyone that we have been married for the past eight years. A lot of our fans are happy to hear this. I know. I’ve read some of the things you genius things have written. We also have a ten-year-old daughter.”
“We’re gonna go to Britain. They're gonna teach you, magic sweetheart. It’ll be great. You can see us anytime. We’ll leave in the morning to get your stuff,” Tony told her and rubbed her cheek. “After a week of you sleeping, I’m glad to see your beautiful grey eyes.”
“There are still single husbands that need to change there kid! Why don’t you bring up your fucking manager.” Steve yelled grabbing the attention of everyone in the store.
“I am six, but if I am going, to be honest, I am six and…” Peter stuck his tongue out while he was doing the math in his head. “Two hundred and seventy-four days old. So is Violet! We are twins. She’s my best friend too! Well except when she gets mad at me.”
“OH YES! Dads pleeassssee?! It will be so much fun!” Peter asked jumping up and down on top of the table.
“Shut up…” Tony stood in shock trying to comprehend everything. “What do we do?” He finally asked after five minutes of silence.
Luna got up and leaned into Tony’s chest. Taking both of her father’s hands. “Anything you guys want. We can go talk to the press if you need to.”
I looked over at the teenager. His brown eyes staring into mine. His hair was sloppy just like dads use to be. Just looking at him I knew…
After an hour child protective services showed up and walked the twins up the penthouse. With agents standing outside of the door making sure Tony and Steve didn’t harass them.
“Hey! Come on, knock it off,” Peter told him and pushed Flash off of him lightly not wanting to expose himself.
When we both started running Stark Industries we made sure everyone that lost their job with S.H.I.E.L.D. got: a home and was 100% taken care of for two years until they found another profession. After the president that made us go into hiding term ended Dr. Strange went for office and won (surprisingly, he wasn’t very liked by many). So we were allowed out in the open again, but Miss. Imagine never returned to the light of day. Spider-Man did for a year and then hid when Mary Jane came into the picture.
Violet got off the seat and placed the plate in the skin. She pulled the chair over and cleaned her dish along with the dishes in the sink.
“Because then they will know I am a freak of nature and want to get to know me just because I have powers. We have killed people, with our actions that were flawed.” She grabbed the bottom of her chair. “We can not pretend anymore, Peter.”
“I understand that, but me? We lost her once in that future and when she was first born though I don’t think it ever happened. But, we knew we weren’t going to lose her again! Then she ran!” Steve screamed running into Tony’s back.
After ten minutes of dancing to fast up pace songs, a slower version of Beautiful by Bazzi and Camilla Cabello came on. Peter spun the girl smiling and pulled her close and whispered each of the words to her.
Steve stood up. “Your honor it is clear Peter is having separation anxiety can one of our friends go with the caretakers to help calm their nerves.”
“Okay we will, we can get everyone ready to go. We can go in the rain.” Steve told him and kissed his head.
Peter carried her down the stairs out on to the streets and ran to the nearest medic. “Someone, please help her!”
Steve always walked with Luna hand in hand so then she didn’t have to use her cane. Luna decided that if she was going to be using a cane that it had to be stylish. So, she took colored paints, washi-tape and glitter and stickers to design her cane.
“Stop don’t attack! She’s dreaming…” Tony grabbed his shoulder and walked over to the bed pushing the men out of the way for Steve.
The rest of the team sat down wanting to hear about their niece and nephews conditions. Once everyone was nicely seated and comfortable everyone went quiet, Bruce began.
“Remember everyone, smile. We are here for kids who have cancer.” Steve told them and opened the door to the chaos.
Tony flew as fast as the suit would let him, but it wasn’t enough. The suit planed on the roof breaking through three floors until it came to a complete stop. “Kid! No! No! NO!”
I put on my shoes when we landed leaving my glasses behind on the chair next to mine. We were at the tower. Not a hospital so that was making my nerves a lot better. I ran off the Quinjet before the ramp could fully go down. Happy was waving at me.
“Did you adopt? What’s her name?! Do her parents get paid for not telling about who adopted her?! Why does she have a cane?”
Steve put his hand on Peter’s shoulders and walked with everyone behind them. Cameras flashed every step they took. Once they got in the van and out of sight they handcuffed every single one of them.
“Vi, it’s dinner. Come on.” Steve told her from the doorway. He held his hand out for the girl who took his hand and skipped off with.
The press was taking pictures. Yelling a million questions there way. The flashes never ended making everyone start to blind them.
“Papa!” Violet wiggled out of Bucky’s arms and sprinted down the hall into Steve’s arms crying. “We thought you no wanted us anymore!” She punched his shoulder the hardest she could (which was only a tap compared to what he’s gotten in the past). “We thought you want us to die alone!”
“I could have told you that there was no changing table in any of the men's rooms! It’s been like that since probably before you, Steve. Not many men take their kids out anymore. I think now that they should since there are many gay couples like us with small children needing to change them is a thing. We can talk calmly about it to someone. But, let’s first focus on getting them both changed. I will go back in there and pay for the clothes I picked out. Calm down… okay?”
With Violet noticing that Peter was gone she began to wake up and wine. The moment her eyes opened all of the butterflies disappeared. “Da…”
“Couldn’t think of anything else…” Clint told them and smiled cheekily at them. “I promise I tried.”
“What the hell just happened?! H-How could she do that?!” Peter asked them with his hands up in the air. He was in more shock than any of them.
They kept kissing while walking up the stairs. While undressing one another until they reached the bedroom only in boxers each.
“We tried to work things out. We even tried a polyamorous relationship. It didn’t work.” Steve told them and sighed rubbing his face watching the twins react.
“Packing? Where are we going” Luna asked and sat her seeing-eye cane down next to the elevator door.
She spun around and laid on the ground. “Only for a minute! I want to change my mind cause this just don’t feel right to me!”
Luna sat on the broomstick and watched the sunrise. Tears running down her red puffy face. She stopped when she made it to the rooftop of the tower. Sitting on her knees she screamed until her face was blue. She had to be happy and okay for her Papa. She had to be.
“I don’t want to cry! I want to fight! I want to fight for my family. My husband and my daughter. For the adults who act like our kids! I will fight it. I swear I will.”
Tony nodded and leaned back into the seat. “I missed you guys so much. I think all the excitement is just...” Tony didn’t really know what was going on. He felt happier than he has in years. His chest was being filled by love making the sadness go away.
Peter sat in the middle of the living room with everyone around him, except for the love of his life, Luna. He bounced his foot up and down trying to keep himself composed. “T-thank you for everyone coming to sit with me… I know I need to hurry up, but I need your permission for something. Something huge.”
“I can sober up before then. Let’s go get changed.” Tony paused the concert and walked back to Violet’s room before he went to his. “Hey, kid...” Tony waved his arm getting her attention.
One thing you taste: “My blueberry pancakes this morning. Which tasted great. Everyone loved them with everything.”
“Tony we did our best. She just stepped in. And we have to punish her! She left the hospital!” Steve yelled. “What if she brought Peter into it? What if she passed out on stage?”
Pepper handed the paper to Steve and watched him sign. “So, both of you need to decide what you're splitting.”
Steve was up there before Tony. They took one another’s hand and looked at Dr. Dessie. “How are they?”
Bucky opened the door slowly and looked up him and down slowly. “Captain Steven Grant Stark-Rogers. How are you feeling?”
Everyone separated and went into there own floors following where Friday was telling them to go. Tony had Steve follow him down the stairs. “I have a confession to make Steve.”
“Then you will go back to S.H.I.E.L.D. and I will stay here with the kids. Just promise you won’t die.”
She grinned into his neck leaning into him more. “You make a hot Natsu. Now let’s get going. Happy will have my neck if I’m late to something again. Newt let’s go, buddy!”
The rest of the Avengers watched with wide eyes as Steve took Hammer by the back of his neck with his metal arm, pointing the knife at his jugular and pointing his head to the camera that seemed to be shaking along with Hammer. "I… I w-would l-like to… to a-apologize to Mr. Stark." Hammer whimpered pitifully, squeaking when the knife pressed at his neck more harshly as if trying to order him to do a better job. "I lied OK! It was me! I was the one playing with SI's taxes and falsify their reports, please don't kill meeee! I didn't mean it; I only wanted to see Stark's downfall yahhhhhh!" Hammer let out a girlish scream when Steve stabbed the knife on the wooden table near Hammer's hand that was on the said table.
Steve rushed toward his baby, taking a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe the blood off his boy’s face, but Peter pushed him away, taking a few shaky steps back, before throwing up on Steve’s shirt and the floor, causing a shocked silence to fall on the place, only to be broken by Peter’s sobs as he starts crying loudly at the mess he made on his mother shirt more than the blood that was still flowing down his nose. “Shush, baby, it’s OK, it’s OK, nothing bad happened baby, it’s OK, Mommy going to handle it, just breath baby…” Steve rushed toward his sobbing baby, trying to calm him down but only succeeded in getting louder wails from his boy, as Peter starts pushing him away.
The sound stopped halfway through the room, and for a long time, Tony heard nothing, which made him relax.
"James, relax…" Steve whispered to the brunt gently as he gently moved the man's head and put it in his lap, removing the Alpha's hands that were squeezing tightly, exchanging them for his as he starts massaging the Alpha's temples gently, moving from the temples to James's forehead and then back, letting out his scent hoping to calm the man down.
"How our children grow up fast…" Tony mumbled, gaining a soft chuckle from Steve as the Alpha kissed his forehead, causing a purr to leave Tony's throat as he snuggle into his husband's chest, his muscles relaxed at the scent of his mate being close by.
"J.A.R.V.I.S. you have one minute to find them or else…" Tony hissed, his fingers twitching madly to have something in it, either to swing it and break something (Preferably someone's skull) or to throw it at Steve for being an asshole and hiding something like this from him. "Tell me, Rogers, did the deal you made with them include hiding the truth from me?" Tony asked/hissed wanting to know the answer because surely, there must be something in the deal that prevents his parents from coming in contact with him, especially after Afghanistan, the Iron Man fiasco, and New York.
"OK, fellas, take care of yourselves and be good, and I mean you, Peter, no more fight today and don't encourage him, Steve." Tony said as he kissed Peter and Steve on the cheek before waving to them as he got into his car and drove away, smiling happily at the thought of returning home later and seeing his boyfriend and the small pup, already planning what the three of them could do today, and tomorrow, considering that tomorrow was his day off…
"So? It doesn't matter! Tonight is about bonding between the two of us, understood?" The sweet smile left Serpentine's face, causing the woman to look at him with a dark threatening look; the killing intent coming from the ghost in waves caused Tony to snap his mouth shut and nod his head mechanically, hoping that he won't die today of all day, not now… Tony should have never agreed with Fury to housing Steve, he should have let him rot in the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s holding cells. "Excellent!" Serpentine chirped, the smile returning back to her face as she looked around the room, scrunching her nose at the decor. "Let's go to the kitchen and get some ice cream then." Serpentine send Tony a sharp look ordering him to move his ass fast, which Tony did, not wanting to be killed by a ghost, not now, not when he didn't even reach thirty-six, not when his birthday was nearly two weeks from now.
"It can't be…" Tony breathed out as he ripped the envelope, his breath hitching when the ultrasound pictures greeted him, making Tony pale as realization painted itself over his face, when he raised his eyes toward James; the Alpha was looking at him with his emotionless face, causing something inside Tony to snap at that. "You! Ever since you came here, ever since you showed your goddamn face here… all of this is your fault!" Tony snarled as he rushed toward James, punching him with all of his strength causing the Alpha to stumble and fall down.
If only he knew that he was one of those Omegas that can carry pups out of heat, then he wouldn't even allow Rogers to stay within ten feet radar of his whereabouts. Tony let out a sniff, looking at his belly in deep thoughts, wondering what is he going to do now, for he knows he can't raise the baby all on his own, in fact, Tony was sure he will break any second now, he can't even take care of himself probably, but a crying, sniffling, too much work baby? Tony will kill himself now just to get rid of the mounting pressure that seemed to increase.
"Y-yes, I… I do. I'm actually Italian." Maria said as she finally get a grip of herself and looked at the pup that was now standing in front of her and she only then noticed how small he was for his age, wasn't the pup supposed to be nine or ten years old? The pup looks younger though like he was seven or eight, too small…
Steve could only shake in his place, his breath getting faster and faster as a panic attack nearly sink its claws in him; there were a few other gunshots that were heard, causing Steve to whimper as he hid his face in Bucky's neck. Bucky, who was shushing him softly and rushing toward Steve's car, planning on driving them as far away from the supermarket as they can.
Waddling fast, Steve ignored Bucky as he slammed his fists on the door, ordering Steve to get back and open the door for him. Finally, Steve managed to reach his car, getting in there fast as he started the car, hoping that he will manage to escape before Bucky catch up to him. Steve's tears couldn't stop falling down his face, blurred his vision, and causing Steve to blink faster and faster to stop the blurriness; his mind was still in shock, refusing to believe what happened not a few minutes ago. Desperately, Steve turned his eyes toward his phone, deciding to call Tony in hope of his Alpha coming to save him from this madness. "Come on, Tony pick up!" Steve snarled to no one in particular when his phone rang for the third time with no one picking it up, his heart pounding in his chest in fear, the thought of Bucky managing to catch up to him was making his heart skip beats in his chest.
"You will be the first to say that, I don't think Steve had the same courage to say what you just said." Peggy said as she looked down at Asgard once more, her mind kept drifting to what Steven said to her, the smile refused to leave her face. "How was Tony in his last years? You said he lived until he was ninety-five, right?" Her question made Steven smile at that, eyes going distant a little as he remembered his late husband with a small smile on his face; he then opened his mouth…
"So what are your ideas for the heat?" Peggy finally asked when everyone proceeded to the family room, Tony pursed his lips in thoughts, gazing at Peter who was drawing with no care in the world, deep in thought struggling to determine what he was going to do, Natasha though offered him a smug grin and asked in an innocent tone that was anything but.
“And then, I wasn’t able to breathe right and I started walking, figuring it was a cramp or something, so I kept walking until I ended up in the butterfly garden.”
“Can it, Rhodey. I’m not kidding. I’m not fucking the help when I could literally die while inside of him.”
He settled into a steady routine over the following days. He’d video chat with Bucky as soon as Bucky woke up, then go for a run. When he was back from the run, he’d settle onto the sofa next to Tony’s bed and spend the rest of the day using that as his homebase. All the nurses knew him well, and knew no one was moving him from that spot without his consent. He read out loud to Tony, told him stories, chattered to Pepper whenever she came in, provided updates to Jim Rhodes, and generally made himself as useful as possible.
The final Tuesday that Steve was under contract dawned, therefore, like most of the previous days had been. Steve went to the kitchen to be told by JARVIS that, “Sir was abed and not planning on leaving in the near term.”
“And me,” Tony said softly. He wound an arm under Steve so that Steve could see the inside of his wrist.
Steve put the car into gear and started to navigate the directions he was given. Tony leaned over and turned up the radio, and the sounds of AC/DC rolled through the speakers. That was one of Tony’s signals for ‘no talking’ and usually it happened because they’d bickered, or because he was making a point.
JARVIS stayed silent, and Tony shifted his body a few times to try to find some position that might possibly be comfortable. After attempting that for a few moments - and realizing the futility in it - he heaved himself to an upright position.
“You are the best strategist on the team,” Bucky replied. “You have always known exactly how much your body can take, exactly how to position all of us in a scrum to make sure that we get the maximum velocity with the minimum injury. And then you go and basically do a kamikaze mission on a tackle that Thor had handled.”
“I’m heading out for a walk,” he called towards the kitchen, where he could hear the giggling that would lead to groaning any minute. He winced slightly, knowing he was being an ass. While Steve had been working on sustainable irrigation projects in most of East Africa, Bucky had been a POW in Afghanistan for eight months. Sarah Wilson had been an absolute godsend and Steve felt slightly gross for being so negative about them, but…
Steve laughed, and was gratified to hear that the man had stopped reciting. His fingers were still flying and his breathing needed work, so Steve forged on. “I couldn’t’ve found Tanzania on a map, but I said sure and started applying. I’ve always been obsessed with water - how powerful it is, how much we need to have power over it to live, so the idea of putting off college for a little while and learning about water in places that didn’t have water treatment plants sounded pretty cool.
Tony wondered why he hadn’t done this before. He hadn’t tried cooking since he was a kid, with Jarvis and Ana, but being here, in the kitchen, was bringing back all the memories of the happy times, before Howard had said it wasn’t ‘suitable’ for him to be in the kitchen. Given that he wanted to be nothing like Howard as a father, he was going to cook, and when Petey-pie was old enough, he’d cook with his son. Jarvis was a much better paternal model than Howard, anyway.
“I’m sure it will,” Tony said with a sigh. “But it could damage his liver in the process, and that’s a big organ to have fucked with.”
Steve nearly collapsed against the wall he was leaning on. He put his phone back in his pocket so both of his hands were free to grasp his head. It was spinning and heavy all at once. So much of his summer made sense now.
“Let me get this straight,” Steve started. “I agree to work for you for a few months, and you’ll let Sam and Bucky have their weirdo dream wedding?”
Steve curled his hands into fists, and then uncurled them in an attempt to calm himself down. “Listen, pal, we didn’t know, but his fiancé and the officiant are on their way, so can we -”
For all of Tony’s bluster that nothing was wrong, Steve knew something was. When he first started working for Tony, the man had driven himself everywhere. Now, Steve was chauffeur. Tony made some excuse about wanting to work on his phone while they ran errands… but Tony hadn’t picked up his phone.
“A high grade epoxy that can withstand water, pressure, fire, and 500 pounds, but be dissolved with vinegar is a pretty big deal, kiddo,” Tony said warmly. “You just rewrote Elmers being a household name.”
“Well, congratulations,” Tony said, “you managed to turn a hypothetical into an unnecessary reality.”
“Sorry, that sounds like a terrible pick-up line,” the man laughed. “It’s just that this is so off the beaten path only a handful of us come here.”
“You think he deserves to be in jail for being an assassin for hire,” Steve stated as he took a step closer to Tony.
“No, none of that unless you’re enlisted,” Jim said. “I get enough ‘sir’s and shit up at Dix. Jim is fine.”
All of Tony’s focus went to problem solving, because that’s what he did best. “JARVIS, how quickly can the chopper get here?”
Steve finally made full eye contact with Tony, and all of Tony’s nerves felt alive and dulled simultaneously. To be the center of Steve Rogers’ full focus was nothing to sneeze at, and every time he had over the past few months, Tony’s world slowed to taffy pulling speed.
Dr. Cho, Pepper, and some other doctors began to talk back and forth, using a lot of words and phrases Steve didn’t understand, so he just made sure to keep his eyes on Tony. A few moments later, Tony called for him.
“The orgy disguised as a Tupperware party that you should not have gone to but did anyway because your sense of self-preservation never fully developed? Yes, I recall,” Rhodey replied.
Tony was waiting patiently for Steve to return from his run, so when the door opened, he was ready to prop himself up on a few pillows and start a conversation. JARIVS hadn't mentioned that he'd gotten a hold of Steve, but he obviously had. “Hey Steve -”
It was on statues, in history books, a huge part of the Smithsonian exhibit. The stories about how he got bullied when he was small because alphas weren’t supposed to be small. He got called a violation of nature, told he’d never keep an omega, Sarah was told she should have left him on the rocks on the Hudson. But then - so the history books told - Dr. Erskine recognized his inner Alpha and gave him the serum.
“Keep it,” Steve replied. “I run hot anyway. Living near the Equator was brutal, I’m fucking delighted to be cold again.”
They exchanged details, and then Steve followed orders and led Tony to the dance floor. He kissed him gently, and then pressed their foreheads together as the music swirled around them.
About a month previous, a video of Steve playing cello in the park had gone slightly viral. SI’s PR team had jumped on it, and replied that Steve would be playing at that year’s Maria Stark Gala if anyone wanted to hear a full performance, there were still a few tickets available.
In the few hours he’d been in Philadelphia and glued to Steve’s side, the only emotion it had brought Steve was annoyance. Brock was too loud, too much, too… everything. He also had this tendency to talk to the doctors like he and Steve were married and so he had some sort of say about everything happening with Bucky.
Humming to himself, Tony started to pull out the ingredients. Steve was busy with SHIELD today, and Peter was having fun with Uncle Rhodey and Uncle Bucky. Sometimes he felt he only saw his kid for dinner and bedtime because every single one of the Avengers, plus a few of the associated people, had become aunt or uncle. Peter loved it, though, so Tony just made sure they all knew the rules, and sometimes he learned more about his fellow Avengers than he ever thought he would. (Apparently Sam was the best Avenger at reading with all the voices and Clint was the best with singalongs. He would not have thought that).
After Steve called Tony out in the yoga studio that day, he’d gone back to Bucky and Steve’s and learned all the things he thought he already knew. Bucky was a vigilante assassin, but for hire for Universal Balance Causes only - which all had to be run through Steve’s membership in the Warlock Council. While Bucky had been freed from the brainwashing that came courtesy of Vlad’s torture, he wasn’t fully free of the trauma - since no one ever was. Finding a way to redeem the skill set he now had and had never wanted was part of his recovery.
“I’m positive,” the man said. “I’m Tony, by the way. Since I know your name, figured you might want mine.”
Bucky ticked his fingers. “One, you’re at the shop on a Tuesday, which is usually family night. Two, you’re moping, which means you’re feeling sad and guilty. Three, I’ve met you.”
“Still in Philly, then,” Pepper said and Steve could hear some clicking. “A car will collect you from the south entrance of City Hall in 20 minutes. Can you get there by then?”
“You guys have been married for eight years,” Bucky said, “and sniffing around each other for, what, five years before that? And that whole time, you’ve both been in professional and personal pressure cookers. Youse had a plan, and you fucked with the plan, and neither of you react well when the other one does that.”
Tony bit into the piece of day-old pizza that was serving as his dinner and swiped at the alert on his phone.
“Now I need a full knee replacement, and Pepper’s due in four-ish months. Tony will have a screaming newborn, a husband who can’t help much, and only three weeks of paternity leave,” Steve recounted.
“I think Sam might protest that sacrifice,” Steve quipped. Bucky opened his mouth to respond when Sam’s voice called out across the dunes.
The mind fuck of the past month was a lot, and so Steve was willing to let himself be pushed against a bathroom wall by a man who was probably a poor decision, but who didn’t kiss like one.
“And gave him my jacket,” Steve muttered. “It’s cheap leather I found at a souk in Morocco, and I gave it to someone who probably could buy his own jacket factory.”
“You can put this smoothie nonsense in your pie hole, Tony,” Steve snapped. “You’ve had smoothies for the past six meals, and unless you tell me a medical reason why you can’t chew solid food, you’re eating this instead.”
Brock kept trying to contact him, and Steve simply said that he’d had fun, but he wasn’t interested in anything else. Security for the building told Steve that a man fitting Brock’s description had been seen skulking around, but Steve didn’t have the emotional energy to deal with it all. JARVIS assured him that “Mister Rumlow will be handled in a manner befitting his person” and that was good enough for Steve.
Tony struggled but got himself fully upright. “Steven, you are in no condition to drive, and we both know I can’t drive you. Alec is on call for times like this. Get in the chopper, let him fly you to….?”
They made small talk for a little while - Steve asked a few questions about sunfish and the other species around the island, Brock asked about how Steve knew what medium to use when. Steve was debating working up the courage to ask for Brock’s number when Brock beat him to it.
“Mr. Rogers replied that you haven’t had substantive protein all day, and recommends he grill some fish.”
Peter Quill shrugged. “Gammy hates when I sit around the house for too long, and it’s always fun to play with you all.”
If he’d stolen some magic from his mother’s people to make it work, no one needed to be any the wiser.
Bucky had offered to mate with him in the tents, to settle the narrative once and for all. Bucky had always wanted a family, far more than he wanted to be a sniper, so it would have worked. Bucky was his best friend, they could have built a good life together based on companionship and secret-keeping, but before Steve could have settled into that mental future, a train interrupted those dreams.
“What does that mean? Of course you know who I am,” Tony said. “I’m Colin Maxsted, aspiring author and yoga enthusiast.”
Tony stared out the window and ignored the pain radiating in his chest. The palladium was slowly eating him alive, and everything he’d tried to use to stop it had failed. He knew it was only a matter of time, now. He’d talked to Pepper that morning, made sure all his affairs were in order. By his and Dr. Cho’s calculations, he had about two months left. Perfect to finish the last prototype of the reactor to send to NASA and then die in peace.
“You’re past that,” Tony said. “Thor had that tackle, you monumental martyr. Rumlow wasn’t getting across the touch line, why did you have to pile on?”
Steve let out a deep sigh and put both of his hands on the kitchen counter. “He looks worse every day, Buck.”
It wasn’t just that he was gorgeous - gorgeous men are a dime a dozen in Manhattan and Tony should know, as he’d slept with most of them. It wasn’t just that he was an incredible musician - they weren’t exactly hard to come by. No, there was something more about Steve Rogers. He was a puzzle that Tony craved to solve.
Tony wasn’t sure - he’d been racking his brain for two weeks wondering why he couldn’t get Peace Corps Steve off of his mind. “He was kind.”
Rhodey snorted. “The walking triangle with the cello. He’s been at the last eight of these things you’ve dragged me to, and Pep said you bullied Tricia into hiring him for her thing last week.”
“Baby,” Sarah said from her place on the opposite couch, where she was going through a pile of cookbooks to decide what to make for the boys’ homecoming dinner the following weekend. “Steve has helped a few hundred thousand people have access to sustainable water, can we cut him some slack that he doesn’t know about Iron Man and his magic reactor?”
As soon as Steve pulled away, Tony let out a gasp. It shocked Steve so much that he fell backwards, his eyes frantically searching the room and landing on Dr. Cho. “Did I…?”
Bucky didn’t say anything in return, and Steve felt the flood of tears breach the emotional damn he’d been relying on for the past several hours.
The ‘Master Rogers’ was new since the fight. JARVIS had always called him ‘sir’ or ‘Mr. Rogers’ or something along the lines of ‘hey you.’ This insane formality only added to the frostiness of the house - as though winter was setting in.
One of the perks of working an event Pepper Potts was in charge of was that she always sent a car to collect him. He slid his instrument into the back seat of the Town Car ahead of him, and climbed in behind it.
“I’ve wasted enough of your time,” the man said, as he retrieved a phone from his pajama pocket and punched the screen a few times. Steve knew a non-answer when he heard one, and responded in kind.
Steve answered him by sealing his mouth over Tony’s, and hauling the smaller man on top of his body.
Harley snuggled into his arms, his mind drifted toward what happened a week ago; part of Harley was still in disbelieve, wondering how and why Mr. Tony didn't punish him for breaking the glass even when it was an accident, another part of Harley was wondering if Mr. Tony was afraid of Mr. Steve leaving if he raised a hand on Harley so that's why he didn't touch him. The idea of not being punished for an accident was unheard and unthinkable to Harley, it was like a joke that his mind refuse to make sense of.
"Mr. Wilson." Tony acknowledge the man with a nod, it took Sam Wilson only a few seconds to snap out of his shock and return the greeting before turning to scold the children that cower behind Tony when Sam Wilson gave them the 'I'm so disappointed in you' look; which to be honest wasn't as bad as the look Steve has because his Alpha (God bless him) has perfected that look to another level.
So forward he marched, already planning on how to bring the meteor with him, wondering what he will find in it, or maybe it would just be a useless rock that he will bring with him just to spit on the universe and give it as a gift to his baby who was going on and on about that space show he was watching for like forever, wondering if bringing a meteor home for his son will give him the father of the year award.
Feeling guilty for being the reason Harley's only parent was killed, Tony adopted the boy and start raising him with the help of Steven; Steven who stayed with Tony and helped him raise his Peter and now Harley from the start. The night after everyone returned to the tower, was the night that Tony finally confesses to Steven, him not being able to hold it in anymore.
As much as Tony pouted a storm today and tried to convince his friends to stay with him for the unforeseeable future, the two of them needed to go back to New York, not only to keep an eye on Howard and Obadiah, but they also have their jobs to return too, Tony was so thankful that the two of them came to see him as soon as they can even when Howard was watching them trying to find where they hide Tony, not knowing that Tony was able to run away thanks to his mother, who according to his friends, was seeing a therapist, trying to get better, which made Tony sigh in relieve at the thought of his mother finally defeating her depression, maybe one day, Tony will take his daughter so she will meet her grandmamma.
“I do. He’s in custody now.” Rhodey told them. “He’s in handcuffs. Tony, what do you want me to do? It is your tower.”
“Yes. Papa had relations with ex-uncle Bucky and he broke the family. I wanna go home. No offense May! But I like my room better it has my legos.”
Tony ran in fast enough to see Peter’s first steps in action. “My baby boy! Look how big and strong you are!” He threw Peter into the air then caught him.
Tony picked her up and kissed her head. “Hi, Lu. Meet your family. Papa and I love you. All of our family love you. You’ll meet everyone else later. I promise. I’ll take her and you guys can keep talking about whatever it is you need to do.”
Violet walked in slowly and climbed into the chair. “Good morning sir. When will Natasha and Bruce be back from the mission, sir?”
Bruce smiled at the couple sitting next to one another at the head of the table. It’s been ten months since they had sat at the end of the table together. “It’s nice to see you both together. We have all missed you, Tony.”
Luna just nodded and sat on the couch. She closed her eyes sniffling. “Pops just started acting normal. Why did he leave? He needs more time. More time to heal mentally. I need him… I need my Pops.”
Steve pulled Luna off Tony and held her close not wanting her being wet make him colder than he already was. “We’re gonna go to the beach. We’ll be together for the last time. I’m sorry sugar pie.”
“If Peter signs I will sign. But, I do have a question. Are going to be able to change our real names for protection? I had no choice in my identity coming out into the real world. No one knew about us, but Peter’s friend, Ned. We went to different schools so it never mattered to me. But now that they have identified me as a Rogers-Stark, instead of Evergarden. I fear that someone might notice.” She whispered and looked up at him. “If you cannot protect my identity I will walk away.”
Steve and Tony got Luna an IQ test once the school she was going to said that she was bored in class. A week later they found out that she had the IQ score of 175 which was off the charts for genius. The husbands decided that they wouldn’t tell her until she was ten so she could decide what she wanted to do with her life. He was happy he going to spend a bit more time with his family than just dying.
Walking out into the kitchen he found Steve sitting on the bar stool on the island. Tony rolled his eyes and walked straight to the fridge and grabbed the fudge pop tarts. Ripping open the silver paper he looked up at Steve and spoke for the first time that month: “The fuck you want, Steve?”
With that, they walked into the building. “Hello I’m Tony Stark-Rogers and this is my husband Steve. We are here to see Luna.”
Tony just smiled. “This is my computer A.I. now. Jarvis is going to be the eye in the sky. Magic man in the mirror. He’s gonna help me with the company.”
Steve nodded and sank down to his knees holding his head in hands. He left his twins. That’s all he could think about. Was that he LEFT his twins on the train.
“You were all stupid fools today. Could have gotten people killed! You ruined homes and blew up monsters with unidentified bombs. How did you even get that kind of bombs they haven’t been made since the 1940’s?” Fury looked at all of them.
“Sounds great. Feed me.” Tony laid his head back on the seat closing his eyes. Steve went to let go of his hand, but Tony gripped his hand tighter. “Don’t! Don’t let go of my hand. Please, Steve I fucking beg you.”
“At least give them a week to get used to being around everyone then we will go ahead. I would wait to move everything until they recover.”
“The Stark Industry robots are already out fixing everything. I called them out when we were on the way back here.” Tony told him and stood up.
Steve walked over to Tony and slid his boxers off him slowly. Kissing all over his chest and down his waistline. “Do you trust me?”
“Not your fault. Bastards wanted me to build a bomb. Let’s go home. Please. We have things to talk about. Our future especially.”
Peter slumped back in his seat and sucked his thumb. Curling into Violet’s lap. Violet put her hands on top of his head playing with his curls and yawned. “Daddy and Papa will come back.”
The battle of New York caught everyone by surprise. Tony and Steve didn’t expect that Loki would take over the tower where the twins where. The twins at the time being only six years old. They also didn’t expect Loki to hurt the twins and threaten their lives against them. It was a bloodbath, but they won with many things lost. To the husbands, everything was a blur.
Hawkeye looked up and rubbed his chin. “The last time we used handcuffs we had an indent inside the circle part.”
“Try and sleep. We are right next door if something starts to happen. Though it would be funny to see Fury see your dreams.” Tony chuckled and kissed his head. “Night.”
“Sir, we have an odd problem in the nursery. I do not know how to describe it. Maybe my camera is going bad.” Jarvis told them.
“But, Violet once you found out she wasn’t your mom why did you stay with her?” Steve asked this time picking her up so she would face them.
Flash kept taunting him. “What you don’t want your orphaned and blind girlfriend know how much of a pussy you are Parker?”
It was a good thing she didn’t move from the stair. If she could see them she would have known that there was a booby trap in front of her with blades when you stepped on the second step. She was going the wrong way.
There time slowly coming to end they had to decide which one was going to go back to playing superhero while the other lived twenty miles away from the compound. To Steve, it was scary to think that one would be on the field and the other would be at home.
Denice stood up first. “Captain Steven Grant Rogers has been a veteran since, well before any of us where born. He has strived in this world to become a great husband and father as time went. Though when he disappeared on his family he went to search for his first love. James “Bucky” Barnes who he thought was dead but saw him alive during one of his classified missions. He left his family to bring home a family member not knowing if he would make it out alive. Steven stated that if he got the twins in his custody he would quit being an Avenger to care for them. Thank you, your honor.”
Tony laid there with the bed sitting up and him looking over at the door. He has only two monitors and was trying to get out of bed. “Hey, baby boys.”
“Don’t fight one another! It’s okay. I have to study for my exams anyway. Peter, I’ll walk you out before there is a world war four here.”
Peter slammed his fist down on the piano which just made an angry noise. “They said you could be dead, but I can’t believe that! I need you here! You need to come home! UNDERSTAND ME!”
After wallowing for an hour on the floor Tony finally stood up and went into the dining room where the bar was set up. Grabbing out a bottle of vodka he began to drink out of the bottle. “Jarvis, get the court to make a date for the twins. ASAP. I don’t want them gone too long.”
“You guys look so young… I’m sorry I put you through hell.” She told them and walked over a bit more. “I am V.M.R-S. better known as Violet Maria Rogers-Stark, CEO and runner of Stark Industries from the year 2022 to 2061 when I ended the company.” She held out her hand, but no one took it.
“Daddy!” Peter squealed and ran into the room laughing. “Did you see, daddy? I was on TV again with Thor!”
Steve blushed and walked over to him. “Not in front of the kids.” Steve pecked his lips and smiled. “Later you can have the rest. Not in front of the four-year-olds.”
"We only want what's good for you Tony; for you and Morgan, we just want to protect you." Pepper whispered, stretching her free hand toward Tony, which Tony took and gave a comforting squeeze. "The thought of you and Morgan getting hurt because of this… of this stupid ghost and the stupid town is too much, especially when we are miles away, with no way of reaching you as fast as we want." Tony gave Pepper a sad smile, holding her hand tightly giving it a last squeeze before letting go.
Over and over again while kissing his head, rocking him back and forth until Peter finally calmed down and wiped his face in the Alpha's shirt, something that will get him an ear tug from his mother, but the Alpha in front of him only pulled Peter tightly in his arms and kissed his forehead.
Stane ends up being prohibited from coming to their mansion again, and Tony was thankful for his father for that. Stane, on the other hand, took it differently, the idiot tried to lock his father out of his own company, which really it ends up with Stane getting his ass handed to him and getting fired for his offers, Tony was happy he wouldn't have to deal with that creep again.
A chill went down Tony's spine, and this time it wasn't from the cold or from the fear he felt from Stane, no this was different… someone, no, some
It was two years since Tony inherited SI after Howard's went 'Missing' as people claimed, Tony being grateful to take reign of the company that was his by birthright, being grateful to be able to stop the weapon manufacturing, getting rid of the dark stain that painted Tony's life since he was a child, a stain he won't allow to touch his child's life. It was the most freeing experience in Tony's life, when he appointed Pepper as the CEO, not wanting to get involved with something that touched Howard with a fifty-meter poll, thought, Pepper was too happy to keep his seat occupied until Morgan was out of college and ready to take the world by a storm, a thought that did nothing but made Tony smile happily.
"Stane…" Steve called out making the man turn to him and glare even more with a dark look in his eyes. "You know why you are here, don't make this hard for you and tell me what I want to know," Steve said making Stane snort at that.
"S-Steve what are you doing here?" Tony asked as he opened the door which caused Steve to snap out of his daze and look at the Omega with a small smile, he entered the room without being invited because if he gathered one thing, Tony will take a mile if you gave him one millimeter, he knows that it was wrong of him to barge on the Omega and his pup's domain, but he was tired of hearing Tony's heartbreaking cries and seeing his pup silent tears.
Even… even if Tony starts obeying Stane, letting the man use him for more food, so he can produce more milk for his starving baby, for little clothes to hide his baby with, letting the man use him just so he would stop hurting Tony, whose body was going weak and weak day after day, even if Tony feared that Stane will finally give him the blow that will kill him… he had to live for his baby, he had to…
"About that… the father doesn't know about Peter…." Steve said which made Bucky let go of him and for his mouth to open in shock. "I didn't tell him." Steve shrugged as he let go of Bucky returning to drying the dishes.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness (The last part of the chapter is pretty dark so…), horror elements, creepiness, torture (Mentioned); fluff, Steve is so in love! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated...
Steven was about to stop Peggy, after all, no matter what Tony did he was sure he didn't deserve to be treated like that, but before Steve could react Tony thrust his fist toward Steve and open it to show a small silver chain with two rings… two rings that Steve immediately memorized, Steve's hand went to his chest immediately only to discover that they weren't there, Steve had been so consumed by protecting Edith and making sure that no one took her that he forget about the most important thing to him. "Oh…" Steven breathed out as he extends his hand shakily to take the rings from Tony.
"Oh, God, you are finally awake…" Peggy's voice cracked as she ran her hand over his face and hair, trying to reassure herself no doubt that Steve was awake; the action was so familiar that it brought tears into his eyes, causing Steve to sob, taking shuddered breathes as he tried to calm himself.
Steve hummed as he saw the Bifrost open and pull Thor to Asgard, leaving Steve behind in the presence of the Avengers. "What a strange goodbye…" Natasha asked with a sly smile, her smile not reaching her eyes that were watching him like a hawk watching its prey.
The sound of a piercing scream made Steve jump from his bed and run outside of the room, Steve rushed toward the source of the sound which turned out to be Tony's room, that made Steve's heart nearly stop and he fastens his footsteps to reach the door faster, he nearly broke the door, but suddenly it was opened, and Steve's heart jump when he saw Peter standing on a stack of books clutching his bear in one hand and the other on the door handle, Steve gasped softly at the teary eyes that Peter was sporting, and he picked the small pup when he whimpered and pointed at his Mama who was thrashing in his bed choking on his screams.
For Tony the only mistake he made was not adopting Harley sooner, maybe if he did this wouldn't have happened and the boy wouldn't have spent those awful days sleeping in the streets. "Betty, you are my friend, I respect you and Bruce like hell, that's why I am telling you about my plan of adopting Harley instead of just doing it… I don't want to enforce my status on the clinic you know it will get messy if I did." Tony whispered causing Betty to bite her bottom lip, his words no doubt hitting her hard; being the main benefactor of the clinic did have its advantage, especially when Tony donate millions every month for the clinic.
with what looked like a map on the back of the paper housing the sketch of Wakanda and her Black Panther, but something deep down told Steve that he shouldn't trust anyone with this information even if he didn't fully know the meaning behind it, he doesn't know why, he can tell Captain Carter he was sure of that, she was Captain America after all, but something stopped him, and the Omega gave an apologetic smile to the woman. "I am really sorry Ma'am, but other than the house, I haven't heard from the doctor or his lawyer in years." Steve said with sadness itching in his feature at not being able to tell anyone of the little secret that he and the kind doctor had shared years and years ago, and the woman seemed to have bought it, as she let out a tired sigh…
Steve raised his eyebrow at Thor's description and snorted a little. "This is where dead people go to Thor, you know heaven or Valhalla, I don't know what you call it exactly, but I think that's right." Steve waved his hand offhandedly and looked at his right hand that was still shackled to the bed, it only made him sigh and tug the restraining with a little bit of strength which made the shackles break.
As fast as he can, Tony tried to slam the door shut in the person's face, hoping that his sudden action would gain him a few more seconds to escape. The man on the other side though only held the door open and pushed the door with his shoulder, causing Tony to curse as he stumbled back and nearly fell on the floor if he didn't move in the last second. "How rude, is this how you treat your father after years of absence?" Howard sneer as he took a step inside the house, ignoring how Tony shivered and tried to cover his baby from Howard's sight. "So this was the place that Obadiah talked about… at least you knew where you belong," Howard stated in disgust, his eyes not straying too far from Tony who was frozen in his place, not knowing what to do or how to react.
The sound of something firing before falling made Steve jump and look in front of him only for his jaw to fall, he couldn't believe his eyes… because there stood Iron Man standing up from his kneeling position turning his helmet cover head to Steve. Steve could do nothing but look in a daze at the armored man as he took a step after step toward him until he was standing in front of him towering him completely, which made Steve stand up looking at the armor with dazed look.
, why you must take my breath every time I see you?" Steve sighed happily, which only succeeded in causing Tony's left eye to twitch.
"Wha…" Steve murmured, his voice was so faint and hoarse that Steve winced when he heard it; his voice sounded like he spent hours and hours screaming until his voice vanishes into thin air, it was a miracle that Steve was even able to give out that faint sound.
As soon as they reached the pup's bed, Tony tried to raise himself and lie beside his pup, feeling the Alpha's hands trying to get him back to his seat made Tony lose it. "Let me go!" He snapped hissing at the Alpha making the Alpha let go like he was burned. That made Tony turn to his son, using his shaky hands to raise himself and by a miracle he was able to get his body on the bed, gasping for air after that tiring move. Once he was on the bed, he gazed at his sleeping baby, tears start gathering in his eyes making his vision blurry, his baby was so small in this big bed, he was as pale as the sheets and walls around him, that made Tony whine and hold into the child that was lying on the bed. "It's your entire fault…" He whispered to himself but that made the Alpha behind him pause. "I'm so sorry, baby, Mama didn't mean to, I didn't forget you, Mama is so sorry, baby." Tony choked as he held his baby tightly saying sorry over and over again, caressing his baby's cheek and kissing his forehead gently.
"I am happy to learn that Tony was loved here…" Steven said as his voice cracked making Peggy look at Steven with wide eyes, not believing what she heard. "I wish to tell you that Howard treated Tony like how yours did, but I have to regrettably say that he was the farthest of an ideal father, my husband always told me that neglect and verbal abuse were Howard's favorite, that he wanted to please his father so much when he was young, that he drank his first alcoholic drink when he was nine after his father served him… Maria, Tony didn't talk about her much, and when he does, it was always in passing, mainly her depression, and how Tony never saw much of her when he turned ten, Jarvis and Anna were the ones who raised him…" Steven said which made Peggy hide her face behind her hands shaking, which made Steven take a deep breath.
"Anton! Are you hurt?" Jamti called out as he came running toward Anton, helping the Alpha to stand as they both gazed at the dead bear, before Jamti starts checking over Anton's injuries, the hunters rushed toward Anton surrounding him and the bear, gazing at Anton with concern. "I saw the bear try to claw your chest… what is this?" Jamti concerned voice trailed off when he saw something hanging by a cord over the Alpha's chest. "Is that… Goddess Eir amulet…" Jamti's awed voice caused Anton to lower his head to see the amulet, only for his eyes to widen when he noticed how the amulet had claw marks over it, informing Anton that the amulet had barely survived the bear's attack, but the surprise being that Anton's chest was bare of any scar or damage.
"You won't torture anyone in front of me?" Steve nods his head at Tony's question, his eyes serious as he gazed at him. "You won't kill, burn, bewitch, mental torture, curse, stab, hit, and terrify innocent people in front of me?" Tony pressed, causing Steve to press his lips tightly before he nodded his head in acceptance. "You won't hurt my family, friends, and the Avengers or curse them, even when they act out?" Tony raised his eyebrow when Steve looked like he swallowed a bitter lemon at this request; a few moments later Steve ended up sighing and nodding his head. "You will do all the major creepiness you Addams do and I can't handle behind my back, or where I can never see or witness by a chance?" Steve nodded his head happily before pausing looking at Tony with a look like with a frown like he was played. "Look, you can stab, kill, sacrifice, and do whatever an Addams do, but not in front of me. Creepy dolls? I can handle, ghost around the mansion? Fine. But never ever do something in front of me or it's over." Tony tried to ignore the star-struck look Steve send his way, walking faster trying to ignore the man behind him.
The Omega took a shaky breath before saying fuck it when he saw a tear slip down the Alpha cheek which made the Omega rush toward the man while trying to be quiet lest he scared him. "James, do you hear me?" Steve asked which made the Alpha flinch at that and curl around himself tightly while trying to cover his ears. "James?" Steve lowered his voice as he places his hand on the man's shoulder gently, knowing that if Sam was here he would have snapped at Steve for being an idiot and touching a vet that was in one of his panic attack which would have given Steve a broken nose if James was violent.
"From today, this will be your room." The king stated, leading him to a bedroom on the first floor; the action made Steven blink his eyes trying not to look confused, he knows that the rooms on the first floor were that of the king of his son, so it gave the king no reason to give him such a room.
"Crazy? This isn't even me being crazy! We have just started!" Tony snarled as he threw the second ax at Howard, letting out an insane giggle he couldn't hold back, at the sight of Howard turning as pale as a corpse when he barely dodged the flying ax heading for his neck. Tony ran after his father, letting out mad laughs that mixed will with the thunder outside as the sky decided that this time was the best to start up a storm that shook the trees. "Run, bitch, run! Because when I catch you, it is game over for you!" Tony laughed as he pulled the ax from the wall it lodges in, jumping after Howard and ignoring his mother's scream as he steps on her cat's tail.
