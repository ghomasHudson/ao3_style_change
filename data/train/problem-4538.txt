"You are the best soldier I have ever fought alongside with in heaven. Before you...faked your death...I thought very highly of you." Balthazar another step and Castiel glanced behind them, but there was still no sign of the Winchesters. "I recognize that you know plenty of weapons, especially holy ones. I hoped you could assist me with identifying one."
"It may be quite simple, but, now that it's done.. i hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down the words." Dean pulled out a mixtape from his pocket with the hand he had been holding Cas' cheek with. Leaning away to smile at the angel.
"He is actually...very well endowed." Castiel blushed and Sam howled with laughter, Dean looked appalled.
They did not stop, so Castiel did the only logical thing he could think of. He grabbed the both by the ear and dragged them to the kitchen table. They both hissed and whimpered in pain but Castiel did not stop until they were both seated.
The ex-angel walked towards the seats, his fingers traced the smooth lines of the wood. He considered sitting, praying, but remembered that Heaven was not on his side and if he were to pray he would be leading God's wrath straight to him. He didn't belong here, in God's home, he did not belong in the bunker -- he did not belong anywhere.
Dean wasn't quite sure what Sergei meant, but couldn't ask once the trio came walking towards them. "What are the next steps?" Sam asked Sergei, supporting Cas' weight as the Angel leaned against him.
"You don't have a bargain? A deal? Nothing? Lord, I'm glad you're an angel; you'd make an awful demon." Balthazar placed his hand onto Castiel's shoulder. He close enough for Castiel to hear his breathing.
"I made a grave mistake." Castiel groaned. He expected some snarky comment from Dean, but instead when he looked up at the gunter he saw worry across his face.
"Dean and Sam are only being good friends." Cas said sternly. Balthazar sighed heavily and turned to take a seat on his recliner. He signaled for the three visitors to sit down opposite to him on the couch, they did.
The dinner had been eye-opening. Balthazar said his escape of heaven had not been an escape from Castiel. He said he had loved Castiel dearly, but he was tired of being a mindless soldier with no personality other than being in love with another angel -- which many angels thought was stupid. Leaving had hurt Balthazar too, not just Castiel. But he apologized for not telling Castiel his plan, it was unfair for him just to up and leave, as well as leave Castiel with the pain of the death of someone he cared about.
The angel nodded in agreement, the bigger picture is more comforting but he still felt awful. "Yes, you're right. I just...feel bad."
"That too; but the other things as well. Balthazar used to send me letters with poems when we were younger. He would surprise me with compliments when I was lacking them. Likewise, I enjoyed taking care of him when he was hurt and crafting him weapons. I miss that. Perhaps not him, entirely, but that feeling he gave me." He noticed Dean's expression fall, so to lighten the mood he added: "the sex is good too, though. I miss that."
"Dean." Sam said sternly. "Dude, I know you. If you won't talk to me, talk to him. You know how Cas is, he doesn't get things yet."
Castiel turned back to the computer screen. He managed to get to chrome but was unsure what to type. He went for: 'homeless shelters near me'. A few came up on a map so he clicked on the closest one. It was about two and half miles away and it was named Beacon, definitely a light in the dark. He memorized the directions like he used to memorize the names of important angels or missions or maneuvers. He turned off the computer and walked out of the library and towards the Beacon.
"My name was spoken, I am allowed to listen, it is my business." Balthazar glared. "So, Castiel..." he turned to Cas again, "do you think we could talk over dinner?"
"Not a lot." Dean growled. "I don't care about your sad little problems. I don't need the two of you making life more difficult. We have a priority so you two need to keep a low profile and make sure you don't cause any more trouble."
Breakfast was quiet, Castiel had busied himself in the library and the kid— (Jack? Other Dean can't remember..) was nowhere to be found. He's probably in his room—though Other Dean. Other Sam ate quietly, he looked bored and tired. Sam and Dean took no time to finish their breakfast and head to the library to help Castiel with whatever he was researching.
Finding a public bathroom proved a bit difficult in the first few stores he walked into, like the bar, most of them asked for him to buy something before using it or some required a quarter to open the door. Finally, he walked into a McDonald's restaurant and was able to walk straight into the bathroom without anyone asking him for anything. He hurried into one of the stalls and did his business. Walking back out and seeing himself in the mirror reminded him how dirty he was and felt. The feeling of his own sweaty skin rubbing against itself made him shudder.
Dean chuckled and tugged Castiel's shirt off. He kissed his neck while he unbuckled the angel's pants. Castiel leaned his head against the door and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. "So needy," Dean whispered into Cas' ear. "You like being hit, Angel?" He asked Cas with another slap to his now naked ass.
He pressed the space bar and the screen lit up. A small rectangle prompted him to enter his library card information. Defeated, he sat and stared in a confused haze. It seemed the teen noticed Cas' confusion and took pity because he turned off his computer and sat next to him.
The bartender seemed like he was about to laugh, but he was to angry to. "No. You can't be here if you aren't going to buy a drink. You gotta go."
Dean looked upset but Sam continued. "I was embarrased for...being so ready to just..get down and dirty." Sam chuckled. "So I avoided him. After I met Jess, he came up to me one day and asked why I had avoided him. He hated himself for a long time thinking he had hurt me. It was silly, really. We ended up being really good friends. I always felt like we could've been something more. We had a lot in common. But by that time he and I had both moved on, and I feel now that I lost something."
Dean's legs carried him mindlessly to Cas' door. Without knocking, politeness the last thing on his mind, he swung the door opened. Shock and arousal coursed down Dean's spine. Castiel was stradling the dildo Dean had bought him, and he was wearing a cowboy hat.
He paused before continuing. "Y'know...the last thing I said to him was 'I love you, Feathers.' and you know what he told me? He said to me, 'Don't call me Feathers.'." Other Dean let out a sob covered only by his own laughter. "That was the last thing he said to me. He kept the portal open for us. You know why? Because he insisted that if the Universe was ending, Sammy and I would be the ones to save it, and we believed him."
"So do we call Other Dean? Let him know?" Sam suggested, turning to look at Dean briefly but setting his eyes back on Cas -- it was his decision.
It seemed that waiting for a patron who was leaving the bar to ask where some sort of shelter might be was the best option. Castiel knew that usually churches or small organizations would hold food drives and it's most likely in this small town that most people would know about it. So he waited, and he didn't have to wait very long for a young man (maybe in his 30s) to stumble past the doors. His hair had been messed with, it stuck out in random places, and his shirt and jeans were wrinkled.
Sam spent quite a lot of time with Castiel after that. Trying to learn more about Angels and pregnancy. According to Castiel --the very little he knew himself-- Angel's only tend to turn to pregnancy when their numbers are extremely low and there is no other option for repopulating. It seems like Angel's, when occupying a vessel, who get pregnant don't necessarily get the vessel pregnant moreso their own spiritual being. Jack spent a lot of time eavesdropping on these conversations and staring longingly at Cas' stomach, perhaps trying to see if he could see the baby. And Dean was spending a lot of time alone in his room.
As if on command, Castiel surged forward and took all of Dean into his mouth. He almost gagged, but he took a deep breath and flattened his tongue. He felt Dean hit the back of his throat. He sucked in his cheeks and began bobbing his head on Dean's dick. He heard Dean moan and felt those same, thick, fingers course through his black hair. Castiel moaned in delight.
"Then see to it he gets better." Sergei said with a smile. "Need I remind Castiel is an impressive Russian, so even without you he will persevere. He does not need you, Winchester, so prove to him that he wants you."
With a sigh and a glance to the invisible path left behind by Dean, Castiel decided. He could not figure this out on his own, although he had known Dean for a long time -- Sam has known him for longer. "It seems Dean has been avoiding me."
"I can imagine. If my world had been destroyed.." Castiel trailed off and looked at the ceiling. "I wouldn't be able to sleep either."
"Tell us what we can do." Other Dean joked with a scoff. His eyes wandered to the corner of the room.
He took a long swig, he let out a breath, and he set the beer down. "Yeah, it would be nice to have a little bugger running around in here."
Dean stopped singing and stared into Cas' eyes. "Cas...I know I've been kind of playing the waiting game but I'm done sitting on the side lines. I want you to be mine and for me to be yours. If you really want to, I'll buy us a house like Sam and Eileen and I'll buy you all the books you want and hell, I'll try to write you poetry. But please, Cas, I need you. I need you in my life and not just as my best friend."
"Yup, I'll be back in an hour. Good to see you up, Cas." Sam patted his shoulder and Cas nodded gently. He continued cooking, and he was sure that Dean only awoke because of the smell of bacon.
"We should probably hide this in the bunker," Sam suggested (referring to the stone), "if it's been undetected in heaven for so long; it'll be even safer in the bunker."
Cas came to a halt, his thighs tensed and his chest heaved. "Dean." He aaid quietly, his cheeks flushed.
Later that day, Other Sam and Dean were preparing their goodbyes. Dean made sure to be quick, Sam hugged the two and wished them luck, Jack was a bit more talkative; telling them to take pictures and send them with a post card. Castiel gave Other Sam a hug and he gave Other Dean a peck on the cheek which Dean returned a passionate kiss to.
"You aren't. That's what I'm saying, Cas. He used you as one and you're over here weeping over him. He's not good for you." Dean set the plate down on the table and sat down before grabbing a piece of bacon and taking a bite.
The ground level was occupied by the kitchen and a living room, no bedrooms or bathrooms; those were upstairs but there were beds on the ground floor too lining the walls like that of an asylum. There was people quite literally everywhere. They weren't doing much, some were eating or talking or huddled around the computer at the far corner of the room. Cas decided to go upstairs. Several rooms lined the hall, Cas counted 6 total. A man wearing a tattered suit walked out of the room farthest right, he made eye contact with Cas. "Hi. You new?" Castiel only nodded, nervous. "Cool. I'm Ben, I, uh, have to go but you could settle in this room. I think I won't be needing it anymore." He was smiling and Cas couldn't help but smile back. Ben walked past Castiel, patting him gently on the shoulder, and hurried downstairs.
"It's a big deal to Cas, Dean. He likes those things and this guy went out of his way to pay attention to them. What does it matter to you anyway? Are you jealous?" Sam chuckled, knowing Dean was going to say no
"I love you, Castiel Winchester." Dean said to Cas, but at the same time Castiel knew it wasn't for him... he said it to his husband.
"I know it's not much but, it's the best I can do. My gift if my song and, this one's for you." Dean let the microphone fall onto the couch before grabbing Cas' face gently. He put their foreheads together.
The priest had given him some fruits. He would have to eat those first since they would rot faster than the packaged goods.
"Come on! It's clear he just wants to get in your pants." Dean scoffed. "Sam, you have to be seeing this too right? What happened is: he saw you, got a boner, and wants to get down and dirty."
"Apparently, Lucifer wanted me to throw it at Michael." Castiel laughed. "He used to say I was good at throwing."
He chuckled to himself. It was bittersweet, the memory. He realized then he would never experience that again -- watching the beauty of humanity from the comforts of heaven.
"I'd buy a big house where, we both could live." He pulled Castiel closer and danced with him slowly. His free hand on Cas' hip and the other holding the microphone.
Castiel stood up and took his empty plate to the sink abd washed it clean. "Yeah." Castiel said to an empty room, not noticing Dean had left.
Dean sat down in his recliner, a bowl of chips on his lap. Every now and then he would lift the bowl with one hand and offer some to Cas, who would grab a handful and eat from there until Dean offered again. They were watching the Bee Movie, Dean didn't see why Cas liked it so much but it wasn't too painful to watch. He thought Seinfeld was funny in the show he was in with the Kramer dude. The movie was far cringier than the show, sure, but it was decent and it made Castiel happy. Halfway through the movie, Dean became bored and glanced over at Cas.
Other Dean continued. "His name is Castiel Winchester." He said with a smile. "Every morning, when I wake up, we have a quickie because who the fuck knows if we're coming home after work."
The drive back was filled with jokes and laughter. Ever since they defeated Chuck and Jack took on the role of God, everything was just...better. Jack is an amazing God, he works hard to make sure every Earth is working and that miracles exist. Castiel helped him occasionally but can usallt be found in the room he has taken up in the bunker with Sam, Dean, and Eileen.
"Bed." Castiel agreed. Dean shoved Castiel onto the mattress and crawled in between his legs. "Do you have lube?" Cas asked.
"Other Dean was kind to me. He respected my wishes, he complimented me and treated me like a person with feelings. He showed me compassion and love. All you do is remind me how useless and weak I am. How unimportant I am to you if I can't serve as a weapon or tool for your apocalypses which you cause by your own accord." Castiel shook his head. "I would rather be with him than with you. I no longer wish to keep our amends. You do not deserve my forgiveness and I do not wish to have your friendship."
Cas went to sit down. He ignored his grumbling stomach, and even though it was light out he laid down to sleep.
Castiel sighed. "Well, I'm certainly not on his side anymore. I think...ever since I met the Winchesters.. I haven't been on his side. I tried to be but..Dean and Sam taught me free will and that meant switching sides."
It was cold again and darker now. His sweater was zipped up to the very top but even so he shivered. When his teeth started to involuntarily chatter, Castiel briefly thought that maybe his teeth were getting a mind of their own. We need food! -- They must have been screaming. -- Let us chew!
They sat in silence for a while before Jack stood up and sat next to Dean. "I'd miss him too." Jack admitted quietly, leaning his head on Dean's shoulder. "But...I just want Cas to be happy."
Castiel giggled again and Other Dean felt like he could melt. Then, Other Dean came to a realization.
Castiel picked up the dildo three days later. Dean would be lying if he said he didn't lurk around Cas' room when Cas was in there alone, he was trying to hear something. Sam would catch him sometimes, but Sam was unaware of Cas' new personal item. Nor did he know Dean was the one who bought it for Cas. On the second day that Cas had the dildo, Dean threw in the towel. He couldn't take not knowing.
"I --" Dean waved his free hand, "I'm sorry. I know you guys are talking about the rock-- stone-thingy, but can we go back to Cas and Balthazar? I mean -- WOW."
He remembered when he first raised Dean from perdition, how he rebuilt him and how their souls wound together. Castiel had given Dean everything because Dean was everything Castiel saw right with God's creation. Righteous, brave, kind, determined, and an absolute moron.
"That's Dean's favorite movie too. I quite enjoy it more than the other movies he makes me watch, but I will always like that movie about the bee who falls in love with a human woman."
"Nice to meet you." Cas said, trying to be curdious. The conversation ended there, though, because the man returned to his blade. Cas sighed and stood back up, he left his bag on his bed and went in search of a shower.
"No," Cas shook his head, "it's fine. I'm... fine." he sighed. "My grace is dwindling, I'm probably just experiencing human emotions stronger than usual." Cas forced a smile. Dean nodded carefully, they both stood there in a strange silence until Dean moved to make his way back to his room.
She swayed a bit, tipsy but not drunk, and her eyes fell on Castiel. She giggled again. "Hey." She said.
He stopped momentarily and stared at it, the stars blurring behind it, before continuing forth and toward the church.
"I'm sorry." Cas finally said before taking a seat. Sam and Jack followed, but Dean remained standing, his expression unreadable.
"You're right. I'm sure we can ensure it's safety and discretion there. I'm confused as to why this even exists, but Balthazar is the best with heaven's weapons."
The streets here were nothing like that of the town he was in before. As the night pursued, people continued to occupy the streets -- not bustling like in the movies Dean would coerce Castiel into watching in the earlier stages of their friendship -- the people still had things to do at night but not as much as they did during the day. Mostly the citizens were making their ways to nightclubs, at least that's what Castiel figured by the way most people were dressed and by their tipsy mannerisms. A few were out on runs, and the smaller percentage of people seemed like they were getting home from a long day.
Castiel kicked a pebble forward to quiet his thoughts. He watched the small rock roll off the sidewalk and onto the road. It fell left. Castiel looked up and to the left. "Left it is."
"Luke was never competition, Dean. I lied about going on a date with him. He and I are good friends." Castiel laughed at Dean's perplexed face.
"Right." Dean laughed and grabbed the lube from his drawer. He slathered some of the gel onto his thick fingers and eased one into Cas' exposed entrance. Castiel hissed and grabbed Dean's shoulders. He left scratch marks on Dean's perfectly tanned skin.
Dean went red. "Not that we would have sex! I was just wondering that...um..if we WERE to have sex, would you be okay with my size?" He laughed nervously, regretting having said anything.
"No, Angel, of course not." Other Dean caressed his cheek and this time Castiel allowed himself to lean into the touch. "It made everything better. I feel...okay. I did with you everything I wanted to savor with you and now I need to move on before I get hooked all over again."
"Dean..." Castiel whispered quietly when he wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. He felt mesmerized by Dean.
After more research, Dean and Sam headed out to a couple cities over where Claire and Kaia were hunting. They hadn't found much with their reasearch and they wanted to make sure the girls were safe. Jack insisted on going, he wanted to see the couple in action, but everyone agreed it would be better off if he stayed.
The streets were practically empty except for the few mingling from bars and restaurants. Castiel walked on, his focus on his footing. It was strange how things one should be able to do naturally can become so awkward once you focus on it. He remembered finding the way Dean walked unique, of course Dean walked the way he does because of his bow-legs. But there's something else too; the confidence he carries makes it Dean's Walk. There are occasions when Castiel believed Dean would not come through on the confidence bit, like in moments when he was afraid, but it seems like whenever Dean is afraid he is only more confident.
"I mean, how big was Balthazar?" Dean interrupted. "Like, if you were good with him, then anything bigger than him is good. Right? Or is there, like,  a TOO big size?" At this point, Dean was just digging a deeper hole. He kept trying to save himself by talking but what he needed to do was stop.
Castiel stood up, his knees buckled a bit but he composed himself and walked over to Dean unashamed. "Dean." He said in a low and gravelly voice. Dean couldn't help but let his eyes flicker down to Cas' lips, his erect cock, and back up to his blue eyes and the cowboy hat. "I just don't want you to avoid me anymore."
Her eyes darted to the door then back to Cas. "They're a bunch of party poopers." She explained, giggling and reaching into her black handbag. "Here," she had a cigarette between her fingers and was offering it to Cas, "smoke with me?"
confused. Castiel had walked in late, he had been awoken by pots and pans being tossed into the sink. The clattering awoke him to an empty bed.
It didn't taste like molecules, he quite liked the taste. Last night before sleeping he had eaten a banana. He hummed, he remembered hearing a young girl in heaven singing a tune about bananas once with her mother. How had it gone?
"His name is Luke." Castiel pulled out his phone and pressed on the grinder app. He opened the profile picture of the guy he had been chatting with.
Sam maneuvered himself towards the kitchen in search of his brother. Feeling a bit like a mediator, he thought briefly about how he couldn't help but need for Dean and Cas to be okay. Despite what Dean communicates, Sam knows Castiel means a lot to him. Much more than a best-friend, Sam believes, and far much more than a brother.
Dean's interest perked. "What 'suspicions', I thought you were waiting on a dick pic response from Other Dean." He said, laughing, as he took a seat. Cas glared at him, but his shoulders relaxed which made Dean smile in pride. He helped Cas momentarily forget what was bothering him, and that was what he intended to help do. Suddenly, Castiel's phone began to ring. "Put in on speaker." Dean instructed, Cas looked at them all hesitantly - he didn't want to - but he did as told.
There were a few patrons; those who looked like they had nothing better to do than drink. The bartender who looked just about done was serving a young man a glass of whiskey. In the far back, Castiel saw a slim grey cat jumping up onto an unoccupied table. Excited, Cas made his way to the cat. He slowly approached the small animal and let it sniff his hand before sitting down. The cat purred and relaxed, laying down on the table and allowing Castiel to scratch gently at the back of its ears. The ex-angel was enjoying himself until a gruff voice -- much like the one he heard yelling at the pretty woman last night -- address him.
The bunker door slammed behind him. He was left with nothing but what he had on him. A green shirt, a red sweater, and his jeans. Dean has been in such a hurry to get him out of his hands.
"Can we have sex?" Other Dean asked. Castiel felt fully awake now. Dean was grinding his clothed erection against Castiel's crotch and that was making Cas perk up.
"Dean?" Castiel whispered quietly. Dean spun around, a microphone in his hand. Suddenly, a gentle piano tune began to play.
He stood up in a hurry -- too fast -- and stretched his back out, he heard his spine pop at the movement. He looked around, the light of the bar had not turned off. Curious, Castiel made his way to the street and to the front door of the bar. He pushed the door open. The bar wasn't full like it had been during the night.
"Oh, I assure you, it was perfectly fine. It would have been better, had you not been here. Isn't that right," Balthazar took hold of Castiel's chin gently, "Cassie?"
Other Dean looked up at Dean and Sam angrily. "But they were wrong. It's you two. YOU two are the main bros and because we thought WE were I LOST A HUSBAND!" Other Dean sobbed. "I lost his kisses. I lost the long night talks. I lost the quickies. I lost the blow jobs. Oh god I lost him. I lost him but then I saw you," he turned to see Castiel "and I realized I still had his smile."
"Good. Oh, so fucking good for me, Feathers. You look so good. So beautiful. You're such a cock slut for me, huh?" Castiel nodded while bobbing his head. "So good." Dean moaned and thrusted forward into the warmth of Cas' mouth. Dean felt he was going to cum soon, so he pulled Cas away and ordered him to lay back down. Dean laid next to him. "I want you to ride me."
"Sh, sh." Dean gently kissed the underside of Castiel's jaw. "It's alright, baby. It'll feel better. Don't worry about me, I like the marks."
"I'm sorry, by the way." Dean said abruptly. Cas looked up from the television to see Dean staring at him. Castiel leaned his head to the side, silently asking what Dean was referring to. "About the whole thing I said to you before you left. It was messed up...I guess I just didn't understand why you needed anyone else, you know?"
"I was just ensuring that you knew what to do with the stone." Balthazar shrugged as if nothing drastic had happened.
Cas flinched and almost tipped over on his chair when the bartender's hand made a swift movement to grab Castiel, the cat hissed and jumped from the table. "I'm leaving!" Castiel yelled in shock and anxiety. He hurried out of his chair and towards the exit, he noticed a few of the patrons looking at him while others were to drunk to bother, the bartender followed him out and made sure Cas didn't turn around.
"That movie again? I guess I wouldn't mind." Sam added as he took a sip of his water, hiding a knowing smile when Dean turned to glare at him.
"Hey, other me, get up!" Dean said instantly before seeing the scene before him. "Oh." was all he could say.
He was about to apologize, to explain, but Balthazar shook his head too quickly. "No, it's...it's okay. I understand. It's my own fault," he laughed bitterly, "all of heaven and hell knows the bond you share with Dean Winchester."
However patient, waiting for a bus absolutely SUCKED. The sun was way too hot, couldn't his father have dialed it back a bit? No, it was the fucking industrial revolution and people needing factories and cars and whatever else destroyed the planets atmosphere and let too many fucking sunrays in and --
"Enough!" Cas couldn't decide on what to look at, his eyes darting which and what way. "Balthazar, we did not come here to exploit my sexual history. Thank you for your help with the weapon, but we must go now." Castiel stalked off to the door and left without looking back at Dean, Sam or Balthazar.
Other Dean shook Castiel's hand. Holding for a bit longer than he maybe should have. "You have a beautiful name."
Jack suddenly spoke, unable to contain his joy. "This is going to be awesome! I'll have a baby brother!" They all turned to look at him in surprise, Sam was even chuckling a bit. "Or um...sister." Jack added bashfully.
Castiel forgave him, he had already forgiven him before he was just...annoyed for never having officially talked about it. They talked about old times, when they would hide away to kiss or whisper sweet compliments to each other. They discussed new interests, and laughed about their long-gone youth.
He was back at square one. It felt so draining, not knowing what to do but knowing things had to get done. His frustrations produced a steady flow of tears and inconsistent sniffles as Cas walked back to the alley. Square one. He saw the cigarette bud he had tossed the night before and wished he had asked the woman who gave it to him for help -- opportunity missed. He thought of Dean and how all of this was because of him; because Dean -- Castiel's friend -- didn't need him anymore so why have him around? Why waste a room in the bunker, that had hundreds of rooms, on a useless baby-in-a-trench coat? Why would anyone else be so generous, if Dean hadn't?
"A solid, you mean?" Balthazar toyed with Castiel's collar, making the blue-eyed angel's breath hitch.
At that, Dean reached forward and snatched the stone away before handing it back to Castiel who tucked it back into his trench coat. Balthazar put on his best bitch-face. "Why would Lucifer give me this?" Castiel asked calmly.
Dean didn't last ten minutes into the movie. He just really need to know. "Have you used it?" He asked quietly. He noticed through his peripherals that Castiel stopped chewing on his gummy bears.
"But he does that with Her. And he fixes his mistake with Her. And then, all is well." Castiel turned to rub Jack's hair.
Sergei's arrival felt like a relief and a damnation to Castiel. He reminded himself that he should have listened to Gabriel's encouragements to attend Angel Biology in the Garrison, but he never expected himself to even interact with humans or feel the need to bear a child with another angel. They greeted each other and Castiel led Sergei to the medical room, where Sam, Dean and Jack were already waiting. Sergei instructed Castiel to lay down as he laid out his equipment on the table.
Green eyes wavered from Sam to the floor in realization. "Yeah." He nodded. "I know, it's just...embarrassing." He snorted humorlessly.
"Oh, and, Sam." Castiel turned to see Sam. "Dean and I borrowed your lube, if you were looking for it." Sam turned a dark shade of red.
A bit short, but I wanted to update :) I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter, let me know your thoughts in the comments. I'm trying to make this as realistic as possible so if you have any tips please let me know
He knocked twice to be polite, it was late. There was a moment of silence and he briefly considered knocking again but the door opened before he could. A man, maybe in his 40s, stood there with a look of surprise.
"Right." Sergei laughed. "Well, Dean, Castiel was asking me to research the impregnation of angels. He believes he and this Other Dean created a nephilim." Dean and Sam both looked at Cas as if he were crazy, Cas flushed in embarrassment. "And, based on his symptoms, he may very well be."
Dean went red. "Y-y'know!" He cleared his throat. "Sex toys. Dildos, vibrators, plugs. That kind of stuff."
Castiel hummed and nodded in understanding. "I do. It's not like the real deal, but it serves it's purpose."
"This young man I met on grinder." Cas smiled. He wasn't lying about meeting a guy on grinder. Charlie had set the profile up for him when Cas told her he was indifferent to gender and actually quite preferred men. He was just lying about going on a date.
Sam's face was contorted into one of confusion, and...interest? "I just...can't imagine Cas having sex."
Dean's face looked as if he had sucked on a very sour lemon. Castiel concluded that he had heard what he and Jack had said. "Claire! Kaia!" Jack said enthusiastically. He stood and ran over to them. Claire and Kaia hugged Jack and started talking to him, catching up.
His spirits crashed back down when he walked into the room. A bigger man was on the floor sharpening a blade, he looked up at Cas, his expression unreadable. "Don't touch my shit." Cas nodded, the man looked back down at his blade. Carefully, Cas moved towards a bed. He was about to sit -- "That's my shit." Cas moved back and went to the other bed, when the man didn't say anything, Cas sat down and settled his bag of food next to him.
Castiel entered the church, from the door he came in from he was near the altar. He looked at the rows and rows of benches where the devout people of the town would come and kneel for their faith. He remembered listening to prayers occasionally when he was a young soldier. People would come to church with their troubles and seek peace and they would leave a bit less anxious but their problems still unresolved. But at least they were now hopeful, they believed that they had let God know their troubles and hoped he would lend a hand. Later, they would thank him if it was solved or forget they ever asked if it wasn't.
"I'm sort of on Dean's side on this one." Sam told Castiel. "Don't you think him seeing you will only make it worse?"
Dean interrupted by holding his index finger up to hush him. "Coffee. Wait here." Dean walked out the room and left Castiel alone for a good five minutes before coming back with a cup of coffee. His eyes were open wider now and he no longer seemed so pale. "Okay, go.'
"Woah, man -Cas, hold on a second." Dean held his hands up in defense. "Cas, I didn't mean to be rude, I was just making a joke. I'm sorry."
"Mhmm!" Castiel moaned and his eyes rolled back. The pleasure was overwhelming. He felt his abdomen tighten and heat up. "Fuck, I think I'm—"
"With his name while we were about to have sex?" Balthazar snapped, losing his calm briefly. He took a deep breath. "It's fine. I should have never let you go, I was foolish for ever doing so and now this is the consequence."
Everyone was quite during breakfast. It was Thursday, the day Other Dean and Sam were aupposed to be leaving but Dean looked angry, the Sams looked awkward, and Jack looked happily
"Hey." Other Dean greeted. He was met by dazzling blue eyes, sex hair, and a nicely toned man in a trenchcoat. He felt his heart swell. Keep calm— Other Dean reminded himself. "I, um.. I didn't mean you." He used his free hand to rub the back of his neck.
Dean took hold of Castiel's hand. Cas felt hypnotized by Dean's voice. Had it always been this.. beautiful?
Despite Castiel's claims, Dean felt like a boy again when he stepped on the stage. A smell of beer on the microphone in his hand, and a hazy screen behind him showing the lyrics to "Cherry Pie".
The man tilted his head to look at Castiel. "Excuse you." The man giggled, then proceeded to walk away. Cas wasn't sure what to do so he just stood there, like an idiot. Embarrassed, Cas decided he would just walk further into town and see if he could find something for himself.
"Yeah, that and how you go cowboy. Let's explore that. Also, why Balthazar?" Dean's face was scrunched in wonder.
He watched her finish her cigarette and flick it at the gravel. She stepped on it with her heel. She turned to face Castiel and flashed him a small smile before heading back to the street. Cas didn't look away from the street she went down until he felt his cigarette burning his fingertips.
"No...well, a bit. Yes." Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose like he had seen actors do when in conflicted discussions. "Dean is embarrased."
"Yes. It's a beautiful movie. The Bee has doubts about his way of living. He doesn't want to follow the ways of his family because he realizes that he wants to have liberty; in doing so, he falls in love with a human, which is not ideal for his species, and She helps him while he helps Her."
"Because I heard you moaning and saying some very suggestive things last night but Other Dean won't tell us. So, did you?"
"Are you calling me an old man?" A gruff voice asked in amusement. Other Dean reacted by swirling around on his heel, glass in hand. He recognized that voice.
"Websites are good." Castiel agreed as he sat next to Dean on the bed. Dean thanked him for the laptop, slid it over to his lap, and opened it. He looked up 'sex toys' and was quick to find a well reviewed store. He felt a bit overwhelmed with all of the options.
"He owns his own business in computer softwares and he writes in his spare time. He's been sending me some poetry he's written for me." Castiel smiled, remembering how giddy he felt inside when Luke sent him a poem he had written just for Castiel.
"Good." Castiel nodded. "Also, Dean," he turned to Other Dean. "How do we start with your healing process?"
The next morning, Dean took a long look at his morning wood in the mirror. He felt like an idiot when he grabbed Sam's measuring tape and measured his dick. He was a little bit under six and half inches. Was that big enough? Too big? He bit his nails, what did it matter? It wasn't like Cas would want him.
Luke is dark skinned, he has black hair and striking green eyes to contrast. Dean stared at the picture. He felt a little self-conscious. Dean tightened his robe around his waist.
Other Sam and Other Dean said they understood and thanked Dean who was already walking out the door.
"I think so." Castiel smiled, emphasising the 'I'. "I think that, despite all of the hardships, I'm where I'm supposed to be. And not by God's means, but by my own."
Castiel was about to say something about being unsure but then Dean gave Castiel a nice slap on the rear and that made Cas moan and change his mind. "Y-yes! Yes, I'd like to have sex with you." Castiel squirmed at the feeling of his growing erection.
"You sure do know how to make a guy blush," Balthazar chuckled and ran a finger across Castiel's jaw, "what's in it for me?"
Castiel pursed his lips, he stood in front of Dean, trying to find the right words. "Dean I thought you and I had fixed our problems."
"Are you dating Dean?" Other Dean asked suddenly, he hadn't been paying attention to what Castiel had been saying.
Dean had decided to stay locked up in his room until the day Sam and Eileen packed up a car in the garage anf were ready to leave. It was on that day that Dean came out of his room wearing his favorite flannel and jeans. He walked up to Sam and gave him the tightest hug Castiel had ever seen him hive the giant. Dean then moved on to Eileen, who he was careful enough to hug gently before placing a kiss on her forehead. She smiled and held Dean's hand.
"Because of Balthazar?" Sam asked, trying to put the pieces together and make it easier for Castiel to communicate.
Dean nodded too vigorously. They sat quietly for a moment before Cas turned back to face the screen, Dean stayed staring at Cas. Building up the courage to say: "i measured my dick."
"I know," the man approached him. "I didn't get the chance to introduce myself. I'm Castiel. I'm an angel of the lord. Well, actually, scratch that— I um.. It's just... I'm Castiel." He chuckled.
He was at a loss. He returned to his other ideas, he could sleep beneath a bridge or in an alley. There weren't any bridges nearby, so he went with the latter. How does one approach choosing an alley to sleep in? Cleanliness, probably, and maybe how dark it was. Castiel remembered too many scenes in stories where someone would be cornered and assaulted in a dark alleyway. Light seems to be a source of protection, which sounds stupid considering what Castiel knows.
Sam continued. "There was this guy. He was on the soccer team. He had the same class that I did even though he was a sophmore. He was cool, you know? We would say hi and whatever, but never really talked much. But one day, the shower in my dorm wasn't working so I went to use the showers in the locker room. He was there too, he was like super into practicing." He snorted and watched Dean's expression. "Long story short, I lost my virginity there. It was weird, because I hardly talked to the guy. And it was shower sex, not the best starter."
Balthazar let go, his eyes wandered to Cas' lips then back up. "You were always the pretty-boy angel, you are smart too but..." he grinned, "not that good at strategy. That was always my strong-suit."
He stared at the stick for a bit, he had never seen Dean or Sam smoke and he knew the damage it would do to his lungs but he couldn't bring himself to care. This is the first person who willingly paid attention to Castiel, not just because they had to but because they wanted to. He stood up and took the cigarette. "Thank you."
Other Dean smiled. He knew what Castiel meant. He knew what the angel was trying to say behind vague words. The angel meant he would be grieving too; that he, too, would toss and turn thinking about the losses.
"It matters greatly, to him." Said a british voice, the sudden newcomer made Dean swerve and he quickly had to rebalance the car. He and Sam were panting once the car was back on track, and Castiel was glaring at Balthazar who was grinning.
They were washing the dishes when Balthazar snaked his arms around Cas' waist. Castiel leaned into the touch, and allowed Balthazar to gently place kisses behind his ear. Hands roamed down to Castiel's belt, and it was removed. Castiel turned around and pressed his lips against Balthazar's. They both were smiling giddily. Shirts were thrown about, and pants tugged away, before Balthazar lifted Cas onto the counter. Their foreheads pressed together when their hips were flush against each other.
Castiel nodded. Dean scrolled through the options until Castiel pointed at one. "That one looks like a good start." Dean nodded and clicked on it. He hurried to type in the card info to order it. Once it was ordered, Dean screen-shotted the order info, closed the site, and deleted his history. "Thank you, Dean." Cas said with his husky voice. Dean felt his "little Dean" spur awake.
"I was messing with you." Balthazar snickered. "Do you really think, that a weapon to destroy universes would be in the shape of a rock?"
"Don't worry Cas, I'm pretty sure you're better off without him. He seems like the small type-- if tou know what I mean." He winked at Cas through the mirror. Castiel chuckled and shook his head.
He should feel free, shouldn't he? Liberated. He isn't bound by society. He has no number, he has no identity, no last name, no expectations. But he also has no food, no home, no family. He's lost, almost in between worlds. He was also beginning to get a headache. A sharp pain surrounded his skull and his stomach grumbled again so he reached into his bag for an apple.
Except he didn't know how to do that either. A hotel? No, he has no money. A shelter? He knows of none. Break into someone's home? No, that was silly. He looked around again, he knew some people slept in the alleyways or under bridges. He could do that. He supposed he had already slept on a bench, maybe he could just do that again.
Dean sat down across from Sergei. "Is there a way to get rid of it?" He asked quietly so Cas, Sam, and Jack wouldn't hear. Sergei looked up at Dean, surprised and intrigued.
It felt nice compared to the cold. His sweater wasn't the best at keeping him warm, he would rather have his trenchcoat -- he would rather be home. Wherever that is. He sat down again, his cigarette finished, and grabbed a granola bar from his bag of food. Tomorrow he would look for a clean toilet and maybe a shower. He would also have to start earning money soon and find someplace to stay. All of it seemed impossible now, but so did stopping the apocalypse --
He returned to his and Tom's room only to find his bag gone. He felt his stomach churn. "My bag." He rasped. Tom looked up.
Balthazar was teasing at one of Castiel's stiff nipples, his other hand pumping up and down the blue-eyed angel's cock. Castiel was gasping, his head thrown back; he was lost in the pleasure when he moaned breathlessly: "Dean~!"
This time, when Sam said he was heading out for a evening jog, Dean didn't come along. He waited anxiously until Sam left and the echo of the bunker door rung in his ears. He waited idly next to the map table, unsure now for what he waited. Cas was probably in his own room, watching netflix or something. His eyes darted to the hall, he could go see him? Or he could just watch a movie alone in his man-cave.
"Did you and Other Dean...have the sex?" Jack asked almost seriously. Castiel couldn't help but laugh at his innocence. He felt everyone's eyes on him so he quickly stopped.
I wanted to leave this off to interpretation, mostly leaned on the idea that Dean never takes his chances with Cas but I've decided to make an alternate ending.
Putting on the same dirty clothes felt like showering was a waste of time. That's another thing he's need to do then: buy clothes. Or wash.
Castiel nodded. "I don't require sleep. I used to watch over Dean as he slept too. Just to make sure you don't have a nightmare."
Most of the stores were family-owned. Towns like this are better maintained, they have a sense of community, the sidewalks might even shine. Castiel, in his ragged clothes, stuck out like a sore thumb. An outlier. A rebel. He cringed and hurried past a group of people making their way to their car. He needed rest but he had no home. He looked around for a bench and spotted one in front of a bar.
Castiel and Sam shared a look as Dean hurried off to the kitchen. Unsure whether to confide in Sam, Castiel leaned his head to the side and kept eye contact with Sam who was only growing more uncomfortable. "What was that about?" Sam finally mumbled, not wanting Dean to hear them.
Sam sat down, his eyes on Dean. "You can tell me. I won't judge." Their eyes met and Dean seemed unsure.
Dean sighed again. "We did. We are..fixed." Dean didn't meet Castiel's eyes. "But what you said hurt Cas. And, I don't know... you're acting like this new Dean is some prodigy. Like he's better than me in every way."
The priest smiled warmly and nodded. "Stay here." He left the door open, Cas watched him walk towards the small kitchen and look through some cupboards. He was putting things in a bag when he spoke again. "I'm sorry I can't offer you any shelter. Our church is small since our town is small." He was coming back, he was still smiling. "There aren't many for us to help." He handed Castiel the bag, Cas took it slowly. "What's your name, son?"
"Well, we cannot be sure if you are in such a state unless I go and run some tests. I will even do it free of charge since I am interested in the study." Sergei said smoothly. "However, I did find that it is possible - even in your male vessel."
Castiel stood up from his bench post. "Excuse me," he said to get the man's attention -- he didn't, "excuse me."
"He only taught me how to fight." Castiel said, mostly to sooth the confusion on the Winchesters' faces.
"Yeah! Cas met him on grinder— because he has that apparently!— and now they're gonna date? I mean, what the fuck! All he did was write Cas a measly poem and buy him some books, big friggin' deal!" Dean growled, looking around the electronics store.
"I'm not homophobic!" Dean growled. "I'm just not gay and I don't appreciate any other version of me being gay."
"Oh. Nothing, just a vibe I got. And well..." Other Dean shrugged and held the glass in both hands. Deciding not to continue on the subject. How could Dean not be with Cas in every universe? "Nevermind. What were you saying?"
"'Calm down'?! You're telling me to calm down?!" Dean nearly yelled. "I can't believe you had sex with—with—!"
He supposed Dean was afraid of being ostrasized. Maybe he thought Sam was homophobic, or at least that he didn't like the idea of Dean being anything but straight. Which was offensive to Sam.
So he hurried out the double doors he saw when he first came here. He had a bag of food now, but no shelter. He had seen people sleep on benches before, he could always return to the bench in front of the bar.
It was about a week since they were acting strange that Balthazar showed up in the bunker. Dean and Sam were walking in from Sam's run, and they walked in on Balthazar pinching Castiel's cheek. Castiel swatted his arm away but smiled nonetheless. Dean felt his heart sink, were they going to try and make it work?
Luckily, living in such a large space gave Dean plenty of room to actively avoid Castiel. He would still greet him, sure, but he would ensure not to stick around long enough for Cas to initiate any sort of conversation.
Castiel had made sure Other Dean fell asleep peacefully and when he saw four hours had passed after Dean had fallen asleep, he made his way to his room. Castiel knocked gently on Dean's door, he heard him stir and he heard the soft footsteps.
"I understand, Dean." He sighed and lifted his legs up to sit criss-cross on the recliner. Dean was reminded briefly of hippie-Cas. "I suppose I jumped into that whole thing too. I just haven't been in a relationship in a while and...I miss it. I feel lonely, sometimes. You and Sam are great, and I appreciate our time together. What I mean is that I miss being with someone in a romantic manner."
Sitting down was a relief. His muscles relaxed and his body sagged, he let himself lean back against the back of the bench and his head rolled back enough to make his spine pop comfortably. He sighed. At some point soon he will get hungry and thirsty, he'll need to pee and poop and shower -- among other pesky things humans do. How would he do them?
Sam pursed his lips, his eyes tore away for a moment in consideration before he fixed his posture and locked eyes with his brother. "When I was in college, before I met Jess, I had to take this physical education class. You know, since I missed a lot of days in highschool or something like that."
Another look around. It all looked the same, but he knew that this decision could impact everything. Maybe, to the left, there were directions and kind people to give them and the right was death and destruction. Or, maybe, it was the other way around? How could he know and how could he ever decide? He wondered if he could just turn around and knock on the bunker door and ask Dean -- but he couldn't. That was the whole point.
Dean looked his double up and down before walking away. "Hurry up, breakfast is ready." Other Dean heard Dean tell him as he walked away.
Other Dean smiled. "Walk The Line. The Johnny Cash movie." Castiel smiled back and turned to Jack to tell him to put it on.
Castiel couldn't describe this other than awkward. He and Dean were sitting and eating breakfast. Quietly and almost motionless. It had been this way the entire time since Sam and Eileen left and Castiel was getting fed up.
"See ya." Dean scoffed in return. When Castiel left with a slam of the door, Dean noticed Sam staring at him. "What?" He snapped and Sam shrugged while shaking his head.
"Then fix it. Bond. Do something!" Cas sighed. "I'm tired of being a babysitter. I'll see you both later and by the time 'later' comes, I want you two to be the best of friends!" Castiel said with a rolled of his eyes. "Got it?"
Waking up to the glare of the sun and shouts directed towards you isn't the best. Castiel's eyes opened slowly, he felt for his bag of goods -- still clutched between his arms. "Sir!" Someone said, he slowly sat up, his back aching. "Sir! You can't sleep here."
Okay! Fuck, that is NOT what he meant to say. Anything but that. How the hell does someone start a conversation that way?
He sighed. "Sure, I suppose so. I will be leaving to Europe tomorrow, so you won't see me for a while. On that note," Balthazar patted Dean's cheek to which Dean swatted him away angrily, "I'm six inches."
Sabotaged by Balthazar, as always -- with his winning grin. "Ah, yes. Except, every time he brawled with you he also taught you his ideologies. He never wanted you to be a mindless soldier. He even hated me for trying to lean you towards being a follower."
Cas knows of monsters, God, gods, Lucifer, demons -- and he believes a light is protection? It's warm and it's soothing (sometimes) but it would do nothing when facing a vampire -- no matter what those strange movies and books always claim. Here, an ex-angel ex-soldier ex-everything stood in front of a narrow alley lighten up only by the red hue of a backdoor bar sign and believed it would protect him. A dumpster next to the backdoor erased any hopes of cleanliness and the graffiti on the walls gave the alley character. Castiel supposed this was the best he would get.
"Regular symptoms. Nausea, hunger, strong emotional outbursts..." Castiel sighed, moving his face into his hands. "I didn't know this could happen. I didn't take the precautions."
"Don't worry, Cas, that happens to me all the time." Dean waved it off. "But, uh, are you good? Like, man, if this whole thing with you and the other Dean is serious -"
The doors were closed but he could see a light through a window of the small building behind the church. Determined, Castiel climbed the fence to get to it. He felt weak when his muscles trembled from his own body weight, he had to hurl himself over and he nearly tripped when he landed. Had he been an Angel, he would have completed the task gracefully. He took a deep breath to ease his heart rate before approaching the building.
"Nice to see you, Cassie." The british accent was laced with confidence, one that used to make Cas shiver. Castiel slowly approached Balthazar, he had told Dean and Sam to stay behind but he was sure they'd barge in at any sign of a struggle.
Sam and Castiel laughed with Dean until they all calmed down. The silence was broken by Sam, who carried a new tone of voice.
"I have a question." Other Dean said, clearing his throat. "You," he pointed at Dean "are clearly homophobic. But you're so loving towards those girls who are clearly in a relationship? Is it just a hate on guy on guy or..?"
It was cold. Again. He hated weather too, it changed too much. Consistency would be nice. It wasn't too dark though, the lights of stores lit up the sidewalks but he couldn't see the stars as well as he could in the town. He wondered what he would discover here.
Dean and Sam struggled to compose themselves but did so quickly, Dean was the first to speak. "Just making sure everything is A-okay."
He didn't know what hurt most; Dean kicking him out of the bunker or the freezing wind that whipped past his single sweater. At last he realized why the Winchesters wore so many layers. Being human is so...cold; even if his eyes were burning. His chest felt tight, he tried to focus on his breathing -- worried he might forget to. This was all too new. He had felt it before at a smaller scale when he was low on power after being cut off from heaven before the first apocalypse. But this...this was too much.
"Dean is kind of right," Sam added, "you would have hurt him more; had you started a relationship with him again but wanted someone else. It's good that he knows you're not one-hundred-percent into him early on, rather than later when you both could have developed something stronger."
"It's not like a human pregnancy, that much is clear." Sergei said. "I cannot conduct a blood or urine test. However," he walked over to Castiel, "I can test his soul."
"If you'll have us." Other Dean said with a cocky grin. "I mean, you sort of are the reason our world is old news, right?"
The Sams got back to the bunker before Cas did, so they played The Game of Life with Jack while the Deans sorted out their business. When Castiel did get back, he got back with a good amount of groceries that Jack helped him carry in and put away.
"So you're curious if I would like your...size?" Castiel looked even more confused at the insinuation.
"That's alright. You know you uh...you really felt something for him and that's.. that's alright." Dean seemed to be tip toeing around his words, picking them carefully.
Castiel supposed he too should be confident. So he straightened his posture, tilted his head back like Dean did whenever he was making that stupid grin that said: 'I'm right, and everyone knows it.'. He looked up and forward and he saw a cross. A cross in the sky, pedestaled by a church. A sign of faith for many.
"Yes, well, we cannot be sure until I run the tests." Segei's voice drawled from the phone. "I can be there tomorrow morning. Until then, try not to kill each other." The call ended. Cas looked tense again, he turned off the phone and set it down.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows; he hadn't thought about really giving anything to Balthazar in return for his services. He had assumed their past was enough to give him a freebie, as Dean might say. "Is there something you want?"
Castiel isn't lying when he tells Sam how tired he is. Other Dean made sure to have plenty "last"s. Last beach walk, last park stroll, last ice cream, last trampoline jump. Last everything. Cas tossed himself onto the couch where Sam was opening pistachios. Other Dean had gone to shower.
He was all snuggled up in his designated recliner. He and Dean had created this space far before Sam had become aware of it. Here was where Dean showed Cas that one film about the two cowboys.
Fed and relieved. At least those boxes were checked -- for today. He decided the next thing he should do is find a place to shower.
He felt like he had walked for hours. His calves muscles were throbbing, he might need to sit down soon. At least he wasn't as cold as before and he could see the beginnings of a town. The bunker was situated in Lebanon and Castiel knew he could not have walked to another city, so this must be one of Lebanon's smaller towns.
"Are you still angry about that?" Balthazar stood up and placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder again, he caught Dean glaring so he decided to let the cat out of the bag. "I have apologized, yes? I know you were looking forward to our marriage --"
The woman moved to stand next to him, the click of her heels louder but soothing. "Can't believe these motherfuckers." She finally said, her fit of giggles having come to an end. "A girl's just trying to work." Castiel tilted his head a bit to better look at her, the red light illuminating the sharp angles of her face and hallowness of her cheeks. He didn't say anything, only listened. "I come here every weekend to do this shit, y'know? I got people counting on me at home and fuck if the people at my actual job will ever give me an easy time -- now I gotta deal with that shit here too? I fucking swear, man, can't they just let people be?"
Castiel smiled. "Took you long enough." He giggled. Dean rolled his eyes but smiled. "I don't need any of those things, Dean. I just need you." Castiel leaned forward and they shared a kiss.
"I love his laugh." A tear fell down his cheek. "It's the fucking sun that lights up the room. I don't give a fuck that he's a guy. Hell, I'm probably the gayest guy ever for Feathers." Other Dean laughed. "He always hated it when I called him Feathers."
"No." Castiel shook his head. "He needs to accept that his husband is gone now. To do that, he only wants to enjoy the last moments that he didn't get to enjoy with him. If that doesn't work, then we'll go with your plan. But please, let me try this."
"Hey, yourself." Castiel huffed. "You two need to chill out. I'm leaving to get some groceries. Dean, I expected you to be nicer today."
"Ooh~" Dean licked up Castiel's neck and nibbled gently on the skin. Castiel squirmed. "Yeah I got some. I found it in Sam's room."
"Yes. Thank you, Dean." Dean was on his way back out the room when Castiel stopped him. "Hey...um, Dean?"
"I spoke to Gabriel. He told me he was in on it." Balthazar shrugged. "Castiel was always so serious. They thought they would get a kick out of watching him try and figure out what the note meant."
The bathrooms were outside the gas-station and luckily he didn't need a quarter or key to get in. He could see why, though, because it was absolutely filthy. Grafitti and piss covered the walls and floors and toilet lid. The sink and mirror had been carved into with what Castiel assumed was a knife. There was no toilet paper. He groaned, he would just pee then.
When Cas walked in, he saw everyone was eating. Castiel served himself some pancakes and sat next to Jack. Jack turned slightly and placed his hands on his lap. "Good morning."
"Get my laptop." Dean ordered, Cas nodded and grabbed Dean's laptop from the desk. Dean jumped onto the bed and digged in his wallet for a card. "We can probably find a business website that can just send it to our PO box."
They both drank their water in a comfortable silence. Other Dean made sure to stand closely to the angel. To Castiel. What an amazing name—he thought. When the angel wasn't looking, he would whisper the name, feeling the movement of his lips as he said 'Castiel' over and over.
"Yeah, I guess it's getting late." Other Dean looked at the clock. It was 3 am. "I just need one more thing from you. Come, follow me."
"What's he doing here?" Dean said with more anger than he should have. Sam glanced back at Dean but said nothing.
"Sure. Probably still not nice enough for you though, right?" Dean said sourly before throwing his duffle bag on the floor and walking away.
Cas emerged from his room when he heard Dean setting something up in his Man Cave. Castiel peeked his head into the door. Dean's wearing a new red shirt and a black leather jacket. His blue jeans are new too and his shoes are sparkling clean. His hair combed back with gel and his face clear and clean. He smelled of cherries and axe deodorant.
"I love you too, Dean Winchester." Castiel heard Other Dean sniffle and he felt his shoulders shake. Dean pulled away and held Castiel's face in his large hands. He looked into Castiel's eyes, enjoying this last moment. Castiel wiped away the tears from Other Dean's face.
"Shut up, Sam. Anyway, I called to tell you I'm winning Cas back tonight. So don't call me unless it's an emergency, got it?"
Castiel almost glared, he did give him the bitch face which made Other Dean laugh. "Dean, I am tired. Please. Can't we continue this in the morning? The very, very, late morning?"
"Fine." He sighed. "I also did overhear you three talking about me. And Castiel," he turned to meet eyes with Cas, "I would like to discuss some things with you."
The move was quick. Sam had saved some cash and was able to get a down payment for a roomy apartment without having to show his credit score(which is non-existant). Eileen and Castiel helped him find a job as an assistant at a firm meanwhile he decides on whether or not he wants to go back to college. "Maybe once the baby is older." Sam reasoned with a smile at the thought of his unborn baby.
Castiel giggled. His laugh is gorgeous—thought Other Dean. His white teeth flashed brightly alongside his ocean blue eyes. "That's the first time anyone has ever told me that."
Dean was about to sing another song when Cherry Pie ended, but the crowd begged him to stop. Most of them dying of laughter and in need to breathe. Dean walked back to the table with a look of pride and a little swagger in his step.
Other Dean stepped closer to him, feeling confident. "Well, maybe you just needed the right person to notice. I'm Dean." Castiel snickered. Other Dean looked at him oddly.
"Sergei." Castiel set the phone down. "I had a question to ask him, but I'm sure my suspicions are wrong."
Cas almost felt like laughing, he was far older than this priest but his vessel did not portray that. Instead he said: "No. I'm hungry and I have no place to go. I was wondering if..." Cas wringed his hands. "Do you have any food to spare? Just for tonight."
"Well I am!" Castiel matched Dean's tone and turned to face him. "Dean needs this. He needs me. He didn't get to say goodbye like he wanted to and enjoy those last moments. I know this is the right thing, trust me."
"Thought so!" Dean squeaked. "You know what? Just forget it!" He laughed again, his eyes in a panic. "Night Cas!"
Dean kept glancing at Cas through the rearview mirror, what Balthazar had said couldn't be erased from his most prominent thoughts -- "like a cowboy"; fuck. Dean wasn't one to imagine his best friends having sex, but this was really something for the spank bank. He cringed inwardly at himself, he knew he actively tried to deny his feelings for Cas...but sometimes a guy can't help it.
"Likewise." Castiel stood still now, they were a good distance away from each other. "I come asking for a favor."
Castiel followed Other Dean to his temporary room. "What is it—?" Cas was cut off by Other Dean who pushed Cas against the now closed door.
"They wouldn't care. Not anymore. I think that the hunt for a nephilim has ended." At that, Cas looked a little relieved.
It was a few days after Cas' outburst, and he was currently pacing hurriedly in the Map room. Dean, Sam, and Jack had begun watching the angel out of curiosity. Cas was clutching his phone, Dean almost felt bad for the device. Castiel seemed nervous, so nervous that he hadn't noticed the audience he had gathered. "Holding the phone hostage, eh, Cas?" Dean finally said when he began to grow bothered by the pacing. Castiel's attention drew to the three before him, he looked surprised.
She sighed, her eyes met Castiel's briefly but she was back to staring at the wall or maybe the door? Or maybe nothing. Maybe she was just looking but not seeing -- the door wasn't really there, or the wall or the art, it was just her and her thoughts and maybe the words of the angry man who insulted her.
"This one's for all the pretty ladies in here tonight!" Dean bellowed with a grin. He heard some people whoop and cheer and others groan. Dean pointed at Sam and Castiel who watched from a table not far from the stage and sent them a wink.
"Any size is fine." Castiel said quietly to which Dean lifted his gaze to give Cas the 'really?' look. Cas sighed. "I do prefer longer sizes...maybe five or six inches?"
The smell of the food, especially the beefy smell, made his stomach grumble. He wished he could buy something here but he stuck with the food that remained in his bag.
The water was cold and the pressure was too light to actually feel like Castiel was getting clean. Even so, he was grateful. He washed himself with the little soap there was available and allowed himself the time to recharge beneath the water.
Castiel nodded. "Thank you." She smiled at him and the doors opened, he smiled back and waved before departing.
Dean stood up and walked towards the door. He stopped for a moment, holding the door, and turned. "You comin', Feathers?" He said with a smile.
In a look around the room, Jack noticed the fact Dean was away and decided to leave Cas and Sam to go see the hunter. He hurried to the kitchen first and grabbed two beers. He knocked gently, "Dean?" he called quietly. The door swung open. Headphones were cradling Dean's neck and it seemed like a group of empty beer bottles were already gathered next to Dean's bed. "I brought you beer."
Other Dean looked around and saw Castiel, he looked...sad. Other Dean stared at those beautiful baby blues.
"He has to get over it, right?" Dean complained to Sam one day on drive to the grocery store. "I mean, he knew him for a few days. They had sex once. What could Cas possibly be missing?"
"What happened to you?" Dean asked quietly. Cas sighed, he thought about just leaving to his room, but he needed his friends. He took a seat and Sam slid him a beer.
Sergei stood up, packing his things. "I will return in a month. If anything changes, call me. Otherwise, go about this normally. Eat when you are hungry. Sleep when you are sleepy. Rest when you are tired. There should be no risk to this."
He had walked pretty far while making these observations. It's not like he had anywhere to go, so he could be anywhere. Castiel did recognize that at some point he'd need money, food, shelter...a shower if he didn't want to smell like sweat forever -- among other things. He knew this, except he didn't know where to start. Would he look for a church again? Should he? He looked up like he had before but he saw no cross, no stars (light pollution), he saw nothing but towering buildings. He once said he was bigger than the Chrysler building. Oh, how far he had fallen.
Castiel sighed and answered: "i prefer to not think about it. Besides, I am here to discuss this weapon. All the note says is to 'use it wisely', but I don't know what 'it' is."
"Dean. You need to understand something." This made Dean look up and they made eye contact. "I'm NOT doing this 'favoring' Other Dean over you—as you may put it, because I think he's better than you."
Castiel had made it clear to the man he was not looking for a partner. He just wanted to learn about gay sex and share poetry with someone who would appreciate. Luke had been more than happy to do so.
But mostly, he couldn't stop thinking of his husband. Dean felt his eyes tear up. He shook his head and went back to thinking of John.
"Other Dean is out of the picture!" Dean yelled, making Jack stop spinning. The hunter was glaring, his chest heaved a bit before he realized his own outburst. "Sorry." He said more gently.
Castiel was already walking away when the priest spoke again. "And you can go through the church on your way out! The door is unlocked." Castiel turned and smiled, the priest smiled back before closing his door.
Claire and Kaia said their goodbyes. Castiel insisted on them staying longer but Claire rejected his offer. "I've got better things to do," the blonde said with a wink aimed at Kaia, who blushed. They all laughed and watched the girls go.
Karaoke was probably one of Dean's favorite past times. Singing was one of his talents— as long as he wasn't drunk. That day, the three of them had fought and killed a ghoul. For some reason, it had been a tough hunt, even though it was just been the one ghoul and three of them. Cas reasoned they were all just getting old.
Instinctively his hands went to opposite shoulders, rubbing away the cold. He looked around, he had no sense of direction. Where would he go? When he was an angel, he would simply think about being somewhere and he would be there. Now, it seems, he'd have to walk. Except he doesn't know how to get anywhere. He has no map of any sort. The bunker was already isolated, hidden; so there were no shops or public places to stop and ask. It seemed he had a decision to make.
"Alright." Other Sam interjected. "alright, we'll be careful." Dean looked over to Other Dean, who hadn't met his gaze, waiting for his agreement.
"Well let's just hope it's just your grace." Dean finally mumbled. Cas looked up in surprise, he expected Dean to be angry, but he just looks...resentful.
"I'm doing it because I feel sorry for him, Dean. Put yourself in his shoes. Or better yet, say you and I were married." Castiel saw Dean flinch. "Say we were. Say you loved me and I loved you and we had amazing sex every night and every morning and we were happy. Even without that scenario, if I died you would do —and by experience you do— anything to bring me back, right?"
As Dean sang, he watched Sam and Cas hold in their laughter only to hide their faces in shame because they could no refrain from snorting. Dean made sure to make a show of his facial features and stomping around the stage as he sang, just so he could see the crease of Castiel's eyes as the Angel laughed. He liked to see Cas happy, Dean had noticed.
Castiel was tired of his cigarette, so he held it between his index and middle finger like he had seen people do in movies and allowed the warmth of the burning stick soothe his muscles. She was quiet, and so was he. He wasn't sure what exactly was the context of her situation, or what job she meant or why she was not allowed to be, but he knew she wasn't really talking to him. Castiel was just a stranger to her as she was to him. She was really just speaking aloud to herself, Castiel was just company.
Castiel smiled. "Well, then, I accept your apology." They stood there, parallel to each other and locked in eye contact for a long while. Up until Dean snapped out of his enchantment and realized, once again, that Castiel was completely naked.
Except he hadn't because the bus driver didn't ask him to pay. And everyone else who got on the bus didn't pay. He watched as people came and went, no one really spoke to him. Sometimes, he would smile at someone and they would smile back. Other times, he would smile and they would look uncomfortable so he would look away.
"I guess that's a way of seeing it." Other Dean held Castiel's free hand. Cas turned in surprise and blushed.
"I do." Castiel moaned and arched his back. "Take your clothes off." He ordered Dean, who obliged eagerly.
"Good." Dean said with a huff. "I need my four hours. If you guys get hungry there's food in the fridge, but hands off my pie! If you need anything go to Sam, he'll be too shy to not help you."
Dean chuckled. "There it is." He whispered and shoved a third finger in, thrusting his thick fingers against the bundle of nerves.
Sam shot Dean a knowing look. "Cas told me you said something that embarrassed you. He wouldn't tell me what," he said when Dean looked betrayed, "he just told me he's feeling like you're avoiding him because you're embarrassed about something. Obviously he doesn't want you to avoid him, and since you won't talk to him well..." Sam lifted his arms as if to present himself. "Here's Sam."
Castiel squirmed when Dean inserted the next finger. "Dean this feels—" Castiel was going to say bad but then Dean curled his fingers inward and hit a bundle of nerves that made Castiel howl in pleasure. "good! Oh, God! F-feels so good, Dean!"
She huffed. "There are kids in this neighborhood. Find someplace else to stink up." She didn't leave until Cas stood up from the bench and started back down the street into town. He took the same route he took to get to the church but he wasn't heading there. He didn't really know where he was headed. He didn't know what to do -- he wished someone would just tell him where to go. He wished he had an objective or a destination but he had none. He was just...wandering.
He awoke to the sounds of rumbling engines and street noise and the smell of shit. The dumpster in front of him was not prettier in the daylight and he was sure someone had either puked or shat on it during the night because it smelled worse than it had before. Or maybe his senses were heightened because he had a pounding headache and tense shoulders and neck from sleeping on the hard floor. To top it off, he was freezing and desperately needed to use the bathroom. There was so much pressure in his abdomen, he felt like he would explode.
I'm super excited for this story. Let me know what I can improve on! I know I got like Lebanon all wrong but I live in Cali soooooooooooo idk other places lol
"He wrote me a poem and he sent me some new books. He bought them for me when I told him I had run out of reading material." Castiel grabbed his phone and stared at Luke's picture.
"And you want to stay here?" Sam clarified. He was resting his weight on the map table and had his arms crossed. He shared the same look Dean did but...more sympathetic? In a way? Like a kicked puppy, almost.
Cas was going to remove the hat when Dean raised a hand and shook his head. "It...it looks really good...on you." Dean was able to say through tight lips. He watched and memorized Cas' fluid movements as he lifted up and off the toy. "I um...wanted to talk about -- well, Sam, he told me you--"
"Oh," the priest shook his head and chuckled, "it's my job. Don't worry about it. Your name, it's of the angel of Thursday?"
Dean was standing up to leave, Castiel was beyond confused. "Aren't we going to finish the movie--?" He pointed towards the television.
He momentarily hoped someone would stop and ask him if he was okay, offer a hand or even just talk to him. He even kind of hoped an officer would come to tell him to move off the bench. None of these things happened. What did happen was that night was beginning to fall and Castiel's stomach was prickling with hunger.
"The flight was what?" Dean, the main Dean, hissed. His face was crunched in what looked like some sort of emotional pain. Or maybe he's constipated?—thought Other Dean.
Other Dean reached forward and caressed Castiel's cheek. Castiel resisted the urge to lean into the touch. "I just need to keep that smile for a few more days. Please." He begged.
The two Deans agreed to be polite to one another. They wouldn't intentionally make the other angry or insulted. They weren't friends, but Castiel doesn't take long to get groceries so they wanted to at least make some progress.
Dean was chugging a beer, his hand on the counter supporting his weight as he leaned back to drink. Sam smiled and shook his head. At the sound of Sam's footsteps, Dean turned around. "Hey."
Castiel had been feeling extremely confused. Dean had been distant after their talk, and though he could understand why Dean was embarrassed for asking such intimate questions, Castiel really didn't think that his reaction was necessary. Castiel wasn't judging Dean, he was just wondering why Dean was interested in knowing that information.
"I just don't get how you can actually be going out with this guy!" Dean said for the upteenth time. Cas was straightening his tie and Sam was helping adjust his hair (I'm a pro at hair, Sam had said when he offered).
"Do you want to watch Netflix later? I found this new show, and I think you'd like it." It was strange to see Cas fluster now, after being naked for the entirety of their conversation and not being embarrassed.
Other Dean stood up. "Guys! Please stop!" Everyone quieted down. "Sammy already confirmed the flight. He and I are leaving today."
"And this is where the Sams go out for a run." Sam pulled Other Sam out the bunker. "If anyone asks; we're twins, go it?"
"I'm not too sure. The last time we really spoke was when we had that 'bros night' without you. He left in a hurry and quite flustered, and since he has avoided me. I'm not sure what he's so embarrased about." Castiel shrugged, looking off to the distance.
Dean pursed his lips and squinted. He had his arms crossed like his brother but he was standing and leaning his weight onto one leg. "Fine." Dean finally was able to say through clenched teeth. Other Sam and Other Dean fist bumped and did a silent cheer. Dean assigned them their VERY temporary rooms and laid down the ground rules. "No touching anything relatively supernatural in here. No touching Baby. No touching our things. No wearing our clothes. No eating my slice of pie. No loud noises. No breaking shit. And—"
"Dean," Cas sighed, "he just wants to talk. I have been wanting to clear things up with him for a long time, but never found the occasion to."
A laugh stifled past is lips and he realized that he was alone. Dean wasn't here sharing a tasteless drink and burger with Castiel. Sam wasn't here to pander Castiel with questions. Castiel couldn't even seek his fellow angels -- his, once, family. He couldn't even pray. He considered his future and what he wanted of it like most humans did in their youth and even in their later stages of life. A home would be nice, so he would need money so he would need a job. That should be his broad goal, get a job and get a home. The rest will be smaller things in the plan to check-off along the way. Like finding a bathroom.
Dean couldn't help the shiver at the thought of Cas bouncing up and down a long dildo, sweating and flexing and -- "O-okay." He stuttered. "Thick?"
Dean looked over, his hair falling over his forehead. "Dude, get over it. It's been a week. You were just his replacement." Dean stood up and grabbed the plate from the cooking station. Castiel glared at Dean.
Castiel pursed his lips and shook his head. "No. The poor man," he laughed bitterly, "he wouldn't know how to feel. Joyous because he's going to be a father? Or bitter because he can't parent with the actual Castiel he loves?"
"Yes. I needed to get a book for a case. I stumbled upon this," he pulled a stone from his pocket along with a piece of paper, "Lucifer left this to me before he was banished." To that, Dean and Sam were looking surprised. Balthazar too.
"I have a husband." Other Dean said suddenly, sitting up. He noticed he had already grabbed everyone's attention. Sam's book closed shut, Castiel's dropped to the floor, and Dean's coffee fell from his hand making him curse.
