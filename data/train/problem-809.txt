“Where’s Sherlock? Where is he Mikey? He- he was stabbed, he needs help-”
"And bring your friend! Your father wants to meet him." Sherlock groaned and fell backwards, covering his face with the blanket.
“John, we are running out of time. If there is even the slightest chance that Sherlock could be-”
"Maybe I don't want to be friends with you." The hurt and understanding in the taller boy's face nearly broke John's heart. "Maybe I want to date you." Sherlock blinked down at John, nearly frozen in shock.
“You should have told me. I could have-”
"Yeah, I had no idea. Do you have a favourite?" Sherlock didn't bother to fight the smile that crossed his face.
“No one deserves this Sherlock. You didn’t do anything wrong. He tortured you, forced you to do those things. You had no choice, and forcing yourself to suffer won’t make the regret go away.” Sherlock’s eyes filled with confusion and he furrowed his brow.
“Woah, hey. It’s just me” Lestrade said, leading Sherlock to the nearest chair. “You’re gonna collapse.” He noted, looking at the detective with a grave kind of worry.
“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
Hours must have passed for Sherlock’s fingers went numb after a while, when his breathing was nothing but ragged gasps and he needed to lean back to stave off the dizziness that washed over him. At that point he noticed his brother sitting beside him, talking to Lestrade in a low tone. He met Mycroft’s gaze and the man said nothing, merely resting a hand on Sherlock’s lower back and rubbing a tiny circle there.
Kudos and comments are encouraged!
He longed to retreat into his mind palace and hide there for an eternity, but that place was like a land mine. John was everywhere, in every room. His sunlight had filtered into each corner of each room. He couldn’t go there now, not if John didn’t make it.
I am so sorry for literally taking years to finish this! I lost muse for so long and it suddenly rushed back to me so I had to finish it. I hope you liked the conclusion to this wild ride and try not to hate me too violently for taking so long.

“Mikey, don’t do this again. Moriarty killed Sherlock. Nothing you could have done would have saved him.” He pulled his friend into his arms and held him close, fighting back tears at the memory of Sherlock. “I’ve got to go. I’ll call you-”
A loud gasp escaped Sherlock as he felt John's mouth gently take the tip of his erection in his mouth, sucking softly and sending shocks of pleasure along his spine.
Something flared in the back of Sherlock's mind, a memory long buried and nearly forgotten.
“No, don’t. Just, text me later alright? I’ve got to get going.”
“Let them come. By the end of the night, you all will be gone and I will have nothing left to live for.”
“I do. I never do anything that I am not certain of.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was horse from tears and disuse.
"Fuck, it took you long enough." John mumbled against Sherlock's lips, causing the detective to pull away.
Sherlock stepped closer to the boy, reaching up and brushing the hair out of his eyes.
"No it's not, Sherlock. He could have killed you." Sherlock sighed, pulling back slightly and cupping John's face gently, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to his forehead.
"Hey, don't think about that right now Love, let's just have fun, and we can talk about it later, good?" Sherlock nodded timidly, offering John a smile that was just a little too sad for Christmas day. "I love you."
He ran to the stables, grabbing Redbeard’s halter and dragging the horse out of his stable. He used the fence of one of the stable doors to propel himself onto Redbeard’s back, far too lost in his panic to care about a saddle.
It was stunning. John looked around himself, breathless and unable to contain his awe-struck grin. He laughed, pushing to his feet and spinning, taking in the new galaxy Sherlock had created for him.
When they reached the compound, Sherlock caught sight of Mike, hovering by the gates. He looked nervous. Something was wrong.
“G-87.” A new voice came from the sofa in the corner, causing John to jump slightly. He glanced over, watching as the fabric of the sofa moved. There was someone stretched out on the furniture.
“Some friend you are.” Greg jumped as he heard Sherlock’s voice coming from behind him. “Threatening to leave an unconscious man on the sidewalk just because you are too lazy to haul him upstairs yourself.” Sherlock looked pissed, but Greg brushed it off.
"I looked for you, once I was old enough to leave the Court. No one had seen you in years at that point. Then one day, I was prepping to set sail when one of my ships was attacked. Only one survivor, and all he would say was 'three days. Brig. John Watson.'" John felt a flare of guilt. He remembered that boy, the one his former Captain had locked in the Brig and allowed his crew to rape him brutally.
“Boys, not now please.” Greg snapped, adding the last ingredient to the bowl before turning to Sherlock. “This is it. Now, lie down within your body. If everything works, the spell will bind your spirit to your physical form. Since there is no medical reason for your body to still be in a coma, I’m hoping the reunion of spirit and flesh will wake you up.”
“I’ll be there in five minutes.”
"What are you going to do? Arrest me?" John shifted in the bed, his head cocked to the side and an empty smile on his lips. "You have nothing to charge me with, and even if you did, you could never make them stick."
“Please? I can’t sleep without you.” John’s eyes were wide and glassy, and Sherlock felt his resolve crumble. He nodded, feeling his heart go weightless at the happy grin John shot him. “Kiss first.” John demanded, and Sherlock obeyed, unable to stop his own grin at the pleased sound John made when their lips met.
He waited for what felt like hours, fidgeting with his clothes and pulling at his hair. He was on the verge of leaving, bailing on the whole meeting, when he heard the heavy doors swing open.
“I had an idea about that actually. You need electricity to manifest, right? What about a laptop plugged into a socket?”
“G-God- yes, please Jo- Captain. Please let me come.”
“I could have killed you.”
“I hate you.”
"Get your grubby shoes off my dance floor." John laughed, pulling Sherlock close and leaning up to press a deep kiss to his lips. "S-Seriously, you're going to ruin the wax." John laughed again and kissed Sherlock once more before stepping off the floor, grabbing his bag and motioning for Sherlock to come closer.
"Damn, cute and funny, how'd I get so lucky?" Sherlock blushed, glaring at the floor between his feet and chewing anxiously on his bottom lip. "You like hot coco? Can't watch White Christmas without coco."
“Why must you always chase after him? There are plenty of other men in town that would die to be with you.”
“Is my brother really coming?” Sherlock asked, sounding uncertain.
This was, by far, not the first time John had pressed Sherlock against a hard surface and snogged him until he couldn't see clearly, but this time felt different.
“I’ve got you John.” Sherlock’s voice wavered with the Song that played with his Life Force, and John dropped his head against the Siren’s pale shoulder, whimpering as the shocks of pleasure coursed through him.
"It was, satisfactory." John laughed harder, returning the gentle slap and shaking his head.
He made it home and set his new book down on the counter, a safe distance from his experiments, and started bustling about the kitchen. He was about to start an experiment when there was a knock at the door.
Cover for me at dinner next week – M
"Someone thinks pretty highly of themselves."
“Isn’t that what I said?” John waved his hands in the air, trying to silence everyone. He turned to Molly, remembering that she had been pretty scared when the strange man arrived.
"Oh? I wonder what that must feel like?"
“He was here earlier, he said he had to talk to Mycroft about something. Why?”
John’s smile was intoxicating and his voice was calming. He was attractive by human standards, and he carried himself with a confidence that made him look taller than he was.
Wanna come over? – JW
After a few minutes of this, John's hand reached around to grasp Sherlock's now-hard member tightly.
More growls filled the air as Redbeard ran, signaling the arrival of more wolves. Sherlock felt his body flood with terror. He wasn’t getting out of this alive.
He stayed there, unmoving, until John came back, his hair no longer dripping and his chest covered by a ratty old t-shirt. He grinned up at Sherlock, who blushed and returned the smile timidly.
Sherlock's moans and whimpers got louder as he neared his climax, practically screaming John's name as he came, covering his chest, stomach and John's hand. John gripped Sherlock's hips hard and sped up his thrusts, pushing roughly into the pliant body beneath him until he came deep within Sherlock's body.
“T-The Spider, he had manipulated sonic tech to create a mimic of a Siren Song to supress his mind.” John shuddered at the memory of seeing Moriarty kissing Sherlock and making him drape himself over his shoulders. “Where is he Mikey? I-Is he-”
“We can’t giggle, we’re in a hospital.” John breathed softly, a smile still on his lips.
Sherlock moved forward kissed him all over the face, his lips seeking and desperate. John giggled a bit and clutched at his chest. Sherlock was laughing too, that low laugh that John adored so.
For the second time that day, Sherlock’s knees nearly hit the ground. But this time in relief. John wasn’t dead… he wasn’t leaving Sherlock.
Thanks for all of your support! Next chapter I'm hoping will come out soon!
Moran palled, a scowl crossing his lips, “What are you–“
Slowly, John focused his senses, and like wading through molasses, he struggled to understand what was going on. Then his memory began to flood back to him. Kidnapped, rescued, triumph, terror, pain, shouting, yelling… Sherlock
Sherlock wanted to laugh. How could this idiot think he wanted to breathe when he had watched John struggle to do so not 10 minutes prior? How could Sherlock ever want to breathe again if John didn’t. It seemed like far too great a challenge for the detective.
Thank you for reading and as always I appreciate your feedback!
Do not go gentle into that good night."
“I do not hire guns to do my work for me.” Mycroft replied. He pulled the papers out and slid them into Moran’s view.
“Are you even listening to me?” John asked, placing a hand on Sherlock’s knee.
He stared ahead, eyes glued to the television screen.
“M’fine.” Sherlock replied, reaching past John to the remote and flicking on the television.
“These are the terms and conditions of your execution. Should you accept them, we will be done here.”
The door opened with a loud creak and the wing-tipped shoes and point of the umbrella announced the arrival of Mycroft Holmes. The elder Holmes brother loomed over Moran, his shadow daunting in the single light of the room. Neither of them spoke as Mycroft took the chair opposite him. The cold silence was a bitter tension they could taste on their lips.
Moran looked up at him, confusion crossing his face, “What do you want from me in return?”
“Don’t you lie to me, Sherlock Holmes. You look awful.”
Hello everyone! I know I'm the worst and that it has been forever and a half since I last posted. And I know this chapter is a lot shorter than the others, but that's because I will be posting the last few chapters a lot closer together, so I wanted to give you a taste and ease you back in.
His brain fired synapses quickly, deductions and theories threading their way through his mind like a thick stream. He closed his eyes to filter the thoughts, the drugs pushing them faster through his mind. He scribbled notes and pictured the scene at The Connaught, locating Moran’s position and narrowing down targets.
The daily news flickered across the screen, BBC’s logo flashing before them.
I'm terribly sorry it's been so long, but hopefully I can turn out a few more chapters in the next few weeks! Thanks for you continued support and commitment to this story!
Lestrade was there to catch him again and Sherlock brushed him off to say in a choked off voice, “May I see him?”
-Marie Curie
Sherlock’s eyes darkened, “No. He died on his way to the hospital. The bullet I put in him made sure of that.” He growled.
“Your health is always relevant to me.” John replied with a kind smile and John watched Sherlock’s face crumple spectacularly. “You can’t just say things like that John…” He choked out, squeezing his hand. “Not when I nearly lost you.”
He wanted John to be there, and knowing that he wasn't was making it hard to enjoy himself.
The comforter was suddenly ripped off him, pulling a shocked yelp from him as he scrambled into a sitting position. Mrs. Hudson was standing beside the bed, her arms crossed and an understanding smile on her face.
"Next time we will plan a bit better." John stepped closer and pulled Sherlock down for a kiss.
"What makes you think that?"
“You just called all three of us ‘numbskulls’ a minute ago,”
John stumbled backwards on the boat, tripping over one of the crates and falling to the floor.
“Get off!” John managed to worm his way out of Sherlock’s grip, shoving the younger man away before stalking off. He was hurt, angry, and just needed to be alone.
He had a ball to prepare.
"Hey Love." Sherlock turned to face the other man, trying to determine how long he had been crying. "Brittany's gone." Sherlock nodded, the nausea returning.
His skull was not on the mantle.
John flushed when he realized he had said that out loud. He plugged in the collection of cords, waving off the comment. The equipment roared to life and John grinned, dusting off his hands and turning towards the fridge.
Pale eyes met Greg’s as his heart hit the floor. He stumbled back, fighting for breath.
"See you tomorrow, Gorgeous."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, certain that John was simply trying to get him to admit that he enjoyed seeing him playing.
“Why are you sorry?”
“You’re back, that’s all that matters. And I am never letting you out of my sight again.” Sherlock laughed and leaned up, catching John’s lips in another kiss.
“You haven’t even said hello to the man you are going to be fucking in a few hours!” Sherlock growled, spinning to face John and snapping a hello at him. John felt a flash of irritation, not used to people treating him this way. He was about to say something when he saw Sherlock visibly freeze, his shoulders tightening and his head springing up.
“Mycroft Holmes.” John inadvertently straightened in his seat, fighting back a blush. Something about the older Holmes sibling made him incredible uncomfortable.
A few hours later, Rosie was down with Mrs. Hudson, the kitchen was cleared and tea was made. Sherlock sat in his armchair across from John, squirming uncomfortably under the gaze of his lover.
John broke the kiss after a few moments, keeping Sherlock pinned to the wall with a hand on his chest.
"I'm not asking what is best Babe, I'm asking how you want me."
“I know Love, I know. It’s okay. Take care of yourself Gorgeous.” John could feel the blade shaking against his throat and he laughed, but it caught in his throat and sounded more like a sob than a laugh. “I never said before, but you know I love you too, right?” Sherlock’s eyes widened and the blade stilled against his throat.
“Hey Sherlock, I was thinking maybe we could order pizza tonight? I know a great little place a few blocks from here-”
“John?” He heard Mycroft’s voice coming from the doorway.
Sherlock drew his own sword, stepping closer to John and holding the blade to his throat.
He still hadn’t regained full use of his hands after what happened on Moriarty’s ship. When Sherlock had been stabbed, John panicked and ripped his hands from their bonds, dislocating several bones and ripping flesh and muscles from the bone.
“No, no Sherlock. Please! Sherlock!” John felt a huge weight crushing his heart. Sherlock was gone. “No. Sherlock, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.” He wrapped the limp form in his arms, pulling him tight to his chest and tucking his face against Sherlock’s neck. “I love you.” He whispered, his heart breaking at the lack of response.
“This isn’t going to work Mouse, there is no such thing as magic, or Father Time.” Greg laughed and reached for the items, opening a small, leather-bound book and reading off the measurements. As he prepared the spell, John glanced around the rundown house they had decided to use for their little ritual. It was falling apart and there was no power, but it seemed like the perfect setting. “Alright ladies, the spell is ready.” Greg picked up the dagger and held the blade against the skin, taking a deep breath before slicing his skin. He winced and held his bleeding hand over the bowl, letting the blood drip over the blend of herbs. The med student in John flinched, wanting to staunch the bleeding and check over the wound. He settled for handing his friend a clean cloth and deciding to check over all wounds afterwards. Molly went next, whimpering in pain as the blade cut her skin.
"Mr. Watson suffered from severe bruising, as well as several fractures and a significant level of internal injuries. We have managed to stabilize him for now, but there is no guarantee that he is going to survive the night. You should be prepared to say your goodbyes." The doctor left, leaving Sherlock standing in the empty hall.
“God yes John. I want to touch you, for real.” John gasped as Sherlock shoved him back against the counter, pressing close and biting on his bottom lip gently. John’s entire frame was wracked with shocks of static electricity. He could feel his lungs tightening and his pulse racing. “I want to feel you John. To feel you inside me.” John shut his eyes tight, clinging to Sherlock’s frame.
When they were a few hours away from the planet, John pulled out his tablet and attached the Data Stick to it. An image of Mikey appeared on the screen, he looked terrified.
“The flow of electricity gives me the strength to manifest physically. Now, shut your jaw, you’ll let the flies in.” Sherlock winked and sauntered around the table to stand in front of John, a smug expression on his lips as he leaned down, a brush of frigid air freezing John’s ear and making him gasp. “And for the record, I was more of a bottom.” John blushed and stuttered as Sherlock walked away, running long fingers over the equipment.
“Please, Sherlock don’t. Y-You love me, remember?” Sherlock’s eyes hardened and he stepped closer to John, gripping his hair and placing the tip of the blade under his chin.
“I-I can’t-”
"Uh, Sherlock?" John asked, startling the boy. Sherlock shot upright, scrambling to his feet. As soon as he put pressure on his feet, the boy yelped and crumbled to the floor. "Jesus, what the-" John hurried to Sherlock's side, kneeling beside him and helping him to a sitting position. "Are you okay?" Sherlock nodded, wincing as he rubbed his feet.
“Feel his energies, Sherlock. Surely you’ve felt it.” Sherlock shook his head, blinking away tears and gently cupping John’s cheek.
Sherlock stood in the entrance, hair sticking out in various directions and a dark, angry-looking bruise on the side of his neck. The sheet from the bed was wrapped around his thin frame, making him look dishevelled and gorgeous and well-fucked. John grinned at the younger boy, opening his mouth to comment on Sherlock's appearance.
He was with the senior dancers in his troupe, on their way to a competition in Glasgow.
“What? Go after him!”
"Hey Tiny Dancer." Sherlock felt his pulse stutter as the last boy, the one he wanted to see the most, stopped before him, a wide grin on his face.
“You are whining about a ghost shooting your walls and you are skeptical about preforming a séance?”
"Nothing happened John. I'm just tired, and I missed you, and I just want to go home." John kissed him sweetly, cupping his cheek tenderly and smiling up at him.
"Why do you call me that?" John smirked, shrugging and pulling out his cell phone, pulling up his music and selecting the song he had been thinking about since he met Sherlock.
As they ate, John once again glanced around at his family, his eyes landing on his boyfriend. Harry had seated herself across from Sherlock and was bugging him, as usual, by sneaking little chunks of cranberry sauce into his mashed potatoes when he wasn't looking.
“An Enchantress. I rejected her and she didn’t take it very well.”
You stole my card again?! – M
“But John-”
He whimpered when John licked into his mouth, his mind going offline as their tongues met.
“Tell me, Captain Watson, have I behaved to your satisfaction tonight?” John bit his lip against the whimper that threatened to fall from his lips. He nodded gently, already starting to squirm. “Excellent. I think it is about time we took our leave.” The younger man sucked lightly on John’s ear, sending a spark of arousal along his spine. “Well, as pleasurable as this has been, my doctor is insisting I get plenty of rest. We shall be taking our leave now.” Sherlock pushed John off his chest, standing and dragging the shorter man to his feet.
“Thank you, John.”
“I’m Death Dr. Watson, even your fancy little toy can’t kill me.” John heard a scuffling and turned to face Sherlock, watching as he stood, straightening his shirt and dusting himself off.
“Fuck mate. Is he okay?”
“Wh-What- what are you saying?” Sherlock could feel his body start to shake as his brother’s words sank in.
The kid cleaned up nice, his hair now dry and styled into a deliberately messy halo of curls. He was still too pale and thin, but in the soft lighting of the diner, he looked healthier and less sickly.
“What?” John asked, watching his detective speak with a soft kind of love in his gaze.
•••••••
The doctor bit her lip. “You… can. But please make it quick.”
“Love meant jumping off a cliff and trusting that a certain person would be there to catch you at the bottom.”

More to come! Thank you for reading!
“Am I alright? John you nearly died. My health is irrelevant-“
― Calla Quinn, All the Time
“I would read the fine print before dismissing it completely.” Mycroft folded his hands together and eyed Moran’s expression as his eyes scanned the first page.
But now… John couldn’t fix this. He didn’t want John fixing this because this was his and Moriarty’s fight. No matter what pawns the consulting criminal sent his way, there were all linked back to him. Moran was a beast on his own but Moriarty pulled the strings, and he knew that either way, one of them would end up dead. That’s the only way this could end well. And there was no way Sherlock would let John get caught in the crossfire.
“He forgot to factor in you.” Sherlock whispered, kissing his doctor passionately. “Now rest. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
Sebastian Moran sat on a cold metal chair, staring idly at the wall. His gag had been removed yet his was still handcuffed, the cool metal biting at his raw flesh.
-Dylan Thomas
And as he suspected, John’s snores wafted from his room, out of his open door. Sherlock wanted to go up the stairs to him, collapse into bed beside him and hold him close. But the pull for the fix kept him rooted at the bottom of the stairs, looking upward toward the dark entrance to John’s bedroom. The stairs to his room gaped like a dark void that he could not enter.
John would squint at him and shake his head; perhaps this was his way of coping with a great defeat such as this. God knows John had his way of coping, most of which involved a bottle of Gin and crap telly.
"Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
He could not inflict himself on John like this. He needed to solve this case before anyone else got hurt, and the best way to do that was to get his brain active enough to do so.
Sherlock collapsed into the chair beside him, and watched John for a long moment, before he began talking, rambling about previous cases, about how he would like to take John on a real date when he felt up to walking to get Chinese food. He took his hand tenderly and talked and talked, refusing to leave John’s side again.
I love you all and I thank you for sticking with this story! We're almost done, so please stay tuned for the last couple chapters here in the next few weeks! <3
“Maybe I enjoy your company.” Drawled Moran, his red beard tugging at the ends of his mouth as he drew a cruel smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
He seemed more energised in the mornings, jumping from one task to the other, pouring over information from the victims and pacing around the flat, his attitude nearly manic. In the afternoons, at around half-past eleven each day Sherlock would collapse onto the couch, completely listless. His eyes bloodshot.
I hope you liked it! Thanks for reading and please tell me what you think!
“The official number of people killed in the explosion at The Connaught is up to as many as forty, with nearly fifty injured, and more reports coming in. There is still no report of what caused the explosion and Scotland Yard has refused comment. Was this a an act of terrorism and where will it stop? More news after this.”
"Alright Baby?" Sherlock felt a swell of emotion at the question. John, sweet, perfect John, always could tell when he was getting overwhelmed. He smiled softly and nodded, kissing John again.
"Hmm, you smell good." Sherlock mumbled, nuzzling into the crook of his boyfriend's neck and sighing contentedly. John always smelled good, even after a long practice when he really shouldn't. He felt John chuckle against him and wrap his arms around his waist.
"Hello to you too Sherlock. Which case? There are about two hundred open trafficking cases in London-"
“Who’s asking?”
"What? Why not? Having another sad wank by yourself?" Sherlock blushed, wrapping one of his arms around his chest and avoiding John's gaze.
But other than that – JW
“I will restore him, but if he hurts you in any way, I will not hesitate to take him. Do you understand Sherlock?”
"Yep, very good."
"Sherlock-"
Sherlock ran to John’s side, catching his head before it could hit the floor.
"I know babe, I missed you too. But hey, how about I pick you up tomorrow when you get back and we'll go get milkshakes or something? Sound good?" Sherlock smiled sadly and nodded, kissing his boyfriend again. "Oh, I almost forgot!" John reached for something in his back pocket, revealing a bouquet of something that resembled balls of aluminium foil. "Chocolate roses. I know you aren't really a fan of actual flowers, and I know how much you love chocolate." Sherlock blushed and took the sweets, grinning at the shorter boy.
“Yep. He’ll be here any minute.”
"Did Victor tell you that?" Sherlock froze, wanting to deny it, wanting to say that no, every one of his previous partners had the same opinion.
“You’ve been doing this for five years?” John blanched slightly at the thought of being in the industry for that long.
"I refuse to wear someone else's foot bindings. That is disgusting!" John laughed, reaching for his own bag and digging out the first aid kit he kept in there. "Besides, Harriet's feet are several sizes smaller than mine, hers wouldn't fit me." John glanced at the foot that was still resting in his lap and nodded, Sherlock wasn't wrong.
"Get your kit Dancing Queen."
“Hey Love. What’s wrong?” He pushed himself up on his elbows and rubbed at his eyes, a yawn pulling itself from his chest.
“Hmm, attractive and sassy, you are a catch.” Moriarty ran his eyes over Sherlock’s thin frame, his eyes darkening. “I am interested in you because you are smart. You are the smartest man in this town, and you deserve to be with someone that can handle that brilliant brain of yours.” The man stood, straightening his suit jacket and nodding at Moran. “You need someone that can satisfy your needs.” Sherlock jumped as Moran slammed the door, ripping it painfully from his hand before shoving his back against it.
"Right, sorry Love. I think I owe you something for behaving tonight, don't I?"
“I feel sorry for the future of Scotland Yard if people like you are what they have coming in.” Sherlock muttered, glaring at the watch in his hand. John was about to ask what he meant when the taller man waved his hand over the watch.
“No, Mrs. Hudson! Come back- you can’t-” Sherlock pulled his blanket up to his face, biting on the soft cloth to try to hide the giggle that threatened to escape. He heard the beast sigh heavily, a soft growl rumbling through the room. “Damn it.”
"Hey, are you free Saturday?" Sherlock furrowed his brow, but nodded anyways. "Perfect, you're coming over to mine and we are going to watch White Christmas." Sherlock glanced up at that, cocking an eyebrow at the grinning young man across from him.
“No. Don’t- don’t do this Sherlock. Please don’t do this.”
“I-I don’t know.” John sat up, pulling the lanky man onto his lap and pressing soft kisses to his chest and neck. “I-I’ve never- I don’t-”
I was about to text you - GL
John prepared Sherlock's body to accept him with ease, the process easier than it had ever been, and within minutes, he was rising to his feet, Sherlock's legs hooked over his elbows as he lined himself up and pressed in.
Watching Sherlock change from Siren to Human was breathtaking. His song was stunning and watching the energies dance and change around him sent a thrill along John’s spine.
“I don’t know.” His hands were shaking as he tried to take John’s pulse. There was none to take. Panic set in, blurring his vison and causing his chest to tighten. He had to calm down, John needed him to be calm.
A/N I made Irene Adler the wardrobe because she is gay (in the show) and if she is the wardrobe that means she is essentially stuck in the closet....;) hahaha
“What happened?”
"Sod off John!"
“I-I know.” Sherlock glared at the floor, chewing at his bottom lip and bouncing on his toes. He looked so young, and it made John want to take him in his arms and comfort him. “C-Can I- can I try something?”
“He’s dangerous, John. He killed thirty people because he was bored, then he ran off to join the Spider’s forces to spite his older brother. His brother, the army, and the Spider all want him dead.” John’s eyes met Sherlock’s and the Siren could see the pain and confusion there. “I know you care about him John, that’s why I told you to get the hell out.” John turned his eyes back to the tablet, his brow furrowing. “Oh, don’t give me that look Watson. I can see how you look at that man, or whatever he is. You care about him. I can only hope he is dangerous enough for you.” The video flickered off and the screen filled with data, but Sherlock could see that John wasn’t watching.
"Not my first time." Sherlock blinked in shock and John laughed. "What? I was a bit of a cock-whore in Uni. Then there was the army, and sexuality doesn't matter when you're alone for eight months at a time, and most straight guys don't want to bottom." He lay back and traced patterns over his own stomach and chest, gasping as he teased his own nipples. "So, I ask again, how do you want me?" Sherlock felt some of his confidence return and he leaned down, covering John's smaller body with his own.
“Well, now he will have no choice but to be with me. Time to die John.” Moriarty raised the blade above his head, preparing to bring it down on John’s hand.
“I’m sorry, I must have dropped it while I was being assaulted in the fucking alley!”
"Stop fucking calling me that!" The boy snapped, blinking rapidly and clenching his jaw. "M-My name is Jacob Brownstein, I'm 21 years old, I'm saving money to go to medical school." Lestrade sighed, tucking his notebook away and rubbing a hand through his hair.
"Right, Gavin's house party or something, right?" John laughed, a more full sound that sent a flare of warmth through Sherlock's chest. He quickly tamped down on the feeling, not willing to let his heart get involved this time.
Mike pulled him into his arms and John let himself be held, his tears staining the shirt of his friend. He didn’t hear Mikey’s phone ring, and he didn’t feel the other man push the button to lull him back into darkness.
"Come on Genius, you said that if I said it again you would take it as a request. I said it, follow through." John stepped closer and held Sherlock's eyes firmly, pinning him in place. "Fuck me." Sherlock felt his arousal coursing through him and closed the distance between them, grabbing John's hips and kissing him roughly.
“John, I know you’re pissed, but you can’t just-”
Try again? - JW
"No! John- stop that!" Sherlock giggled and tried to squirm away. John laughed because he knew the boy wasn't really fighting him, Sherlock could easily knock him off if he really wanted to. "W-Wait- John wait-" Sherlock shoved at his shoulders, and John let off the patch of skin on the boy's neck that he had been worrying into a nice mark.
John was pacing anxiously in the halls.
John had to catch him before he hit the floor.
"Oh, unclench for once! Gavin might have and easier time-"
“N-No.” Sherlock shook his head, flickering intensely as he stared at the lifeless body in the bed. “N-No, I-I died. I-I’ve been dead for years.”
Sherlock’s lifeless body lay before him. Pale, too thin, and peaceful.
"Relax Sherly, Mum knows nothing would happen between us. I came out to them last year." The blush didn't fade from Sherlock's face, and glanced almost anxiously at John. "You want to come?"
"John!"
But there was another part of him, a part he was unfamiliar with, that told him he could trust this strange creature. That John wouldn’t hurt him.
“Shit!” John suddenly leapt to his feet, pushing Sherlock aside and grabbing the rope. He swung around pulled the sail tight, jumping to the end of the boat and propelling the ship forward. “Sherlock, pull that tarp off the side and hit the green button.” Sherlock scrambled to obey, tugging at the tarp, revealing a panel covered with buttons.
The boy Sherlock was looking for was still underage, so the ring kept him reserved for the highest bidders, making it impossible to find him.
"I don't go by Eurus anymore. My preferred name is Sherlock." John blinked up at her for a moment before his body burned with realization.
“An offer?”
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“Goodnight My Love.” John closed his eyes and felt his mind start to drift.
“What is the point of the knife then?”
“Thank you.” John smiled fondly at the young man, unable to contain the spark of affection that lit in his chest.
“About fucking time.” They hesitated before breaking down into a fit of giggles. This was going to be interesting.
"Hmm, nope, I don't think so." John laughed against his neck, now using his hands to tickle Sherlock's sides as well.
John's hands wound around his shoulders, pulling himself up on his toes to deepen the kiss further. Sherlock's hands landed on John's hips and he tugged the boy closer, whimpering as John bit down on his bottom lip and sucked gently.
“No.”
"Yes Dear?"
“Fascinating. And you’re certain that they had no tests or procedures done when they were there before?”
When he had first caught sight of John, he was convinced that his heart had stopped. Blue was a great color on The Beast.
What exactly do you need this stuff for? – MH
“You were upset. It was an accident.”
“You don’t have to-”
Sherlock was bored.
“So, explain something to me.” John groaned and rolled his eyes, slamming his head against the table. He had made the mistake of telling Greg about his relationship with Sherlock. Unsurprisingly, the man hadn’t taken it very well, and was now demanding details. “You are dating a ghost?”
“Why would we summon Death?”
“Alright Sherlock, your Time, and we summoned you?”
“Please stop him.” Mikey’s voice sounded broken and John felt a flare of anger. No deity his friend could pray to could change his mind.
“Who cursed you?”
They were quiet for a long while, both watching the fire burn in the hearth.
"Greg, this is my boyfriend, Sherlock." John wrapped an arm around Sherlock's waist and pulled him close, wanting to comfort the boy.
The Beast stepped over to the bed, adjusting the covers and grabbing a large case that was resting by the chair. When he moved away from the door, Sherlock tried to run, forcing himself to his feet and propelling off the wall. He was almost to the door when he felt a huge paw wrap around his middle, lifting him off his feet and throwing him against the mattress.
John's chest tightened in panic at the thought that he was boring the beautiful boy, and glanced around the restaurant, not seeing the owner. He reached across the table and grabbed Sherlock's hand, smirking mischievously at the confused boy.
“Sherlock’s in the hospital.”
“W-What?”
"John's here!" Mycroft followed suit and stood, straightening his suit before turning.
"Ah. You have a tell."
"Yes, ten out of ten would not recommend." John snorted, dropping his head against the table and laughing, sending a strange shock through Sherlock's body.
"I didn't do that. I saved him, staged a whole mutiny to get him out." Sherlock nodded, still barely moving. "I had the entire crew overhauled, killed anyone that agreed with his ways. That's when I became Captain. I had the boy returned to the Courts, made sure he well enough to survive the trip." John released Sherlock's elbow, stepping back and giving the other man some space. "Did he live? The boy?"
Mrs. Hudson tried to keep him entertained, talking to him and introducing him to some of the other staff members. It worked for about an hour the first day, then he got bored and started itching for something to do.
This wasn’t good.
"Ask again in a few hours, and I may oblige."
"That's enough! We have company!"
“I’m sorry Mycroft. I can’t leave the borders.”
“What?”
“I feel bad. He knows why I left and I think he blames himself. He tried so hard to help me, and knowing that he can’t hurts him. I don’t want to hurt Mikey, I wanted to be the right one for him, I tried. But I’m too broken and I didn’t want him to be the one that found me when it happened.” John wiped his eyes and Sherlock caught sight of the tear that caught on his finger. “I couldn’t hurt him like that.” They stood in silence for a while, Sherlock thinking over what John had said.
Sherlock's cheeks were dark and he was avoiding John's gaze, obsessively ripping a piece of paper into tiny, precise pieces.
"Fuck Love, you are the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen." He mumbled, climbing onto the bed and slowly making his way along Sherlock's body, leaving a trail of bruises and marks everywhere his lips touched the skin.
"I was tainted Sherlock, they wouldn't have let me stay even if the Queen herself begged. He fucked the priest, then came home and took out his guilt on his family." John stood, seething at the memories of having to leave his home, his friend.
Sherlock felt as though he was floating on air.
A strangled gasp was pulled from his throat as Sherlock slid his arms under his back and lifted him off the floor, holding him against his chest and sucking light marks onto his neck as he gently thrust up into John’s body.
“That’s a little weird.”
There was fluid in Sherlock’s lungs.
“Sherlock-”
"Made a bet with Greg."
“Not like that. Mikey and I, we went through a lot together. He was there when I was shot, followed me home when I was discharged. He’s my best friend, and the only one that didn’t treat me different after I got back.”
“S-Sherlock-”
When it came time for Harry's performance, John's mother swatted the back of his head, making sure he was focusing. It was Harry's first performance without the whole group, and despite his complaining, John knew it was a big deal. She had been paired with one of the senior dancers in the troupe, and was apparently terrified about dancing with the older student.
“He left.”
It was years before Sherlock saw John again. He had been helping his brother break a bond that Moriarty had managed to form when he was suddenly pulled, almost violently, away. He found himself in an abandoned flat, the burning pain in his chest giving away what was happening. It was another Binding Spell.
John. He needed John.
Sherlock made his way through town, ignoring the whispers of the townspeople as he walked. They always talked about him, whispering their harsh words, not trying overly hard to hide their thoughts.
"Fuck me." John mumbled, both men falling silent for a few seconds before snorting in laughter.
"With what money? Your rent? I'm sure you'd rather spend that on alcohol. What is your poison? Whiskey?" The woman's jaw clenched and she blinked rapidly, standing and collecting her jacket. "Go home, Ms. Watson, give up chasing ghosts."
“Moriarty, what can I help you with?” He didn’t bother keeping the irritation out of his voice. Moriarty chuckled and stepped slightly closer to Sherlock.
"Oh you two, so sweet." Sherlock blushed darker and John grinned up at him, leaning up and pressing a wet kiss to his cheek, earning a groan of embarrassment and disgust from his boyfriend. "You know though, that kind of behaviour won't be tolerated in the Army Dearie." John's whole world compressed down to the way Sherlock tensed against him.
“I see, I thought you ran the timelines?”
He backed against the railing and hid his face as the ghost walked closer to him. He sobbed uncontrollably, trying to remind himself that it wasn’t real, that Sherlock was dead.
"They've met me John, last year when they beat me in the locker room." John felt his heart break at the terrified expression on his boyfriend's face and reached for his hand, pulling him close and cupping his cheek.
“What’s wrong?”
“If I give you one week, I’ll fall more in love with you than I already am. I wouldn’t survive losing you.” John sniffled and Sherlock tasted their tears mixing together on their lips.
“What kind of deal?”
He didn't know how many more of these Christmases he would have with Sherlock, but he silently vowed to make every single one of them as amazing as this one.
“Still in my chest.”
“I found an old spell book that gave me a spell that can kill anything.”
“I hurt you.” John giggled, resting his head against Sherlock’s chest. “Why are you laughing? It’s not funny John. I could have killed you.”
"I have a few ideas." He replied simply, turning back to his work and trying desperately to ignore the man beside him.
Sherlock's fingers threaded into John's hair and he tried to thrust his hips, but found himself still pinned to the wall. He moaned loudly when he felt John's slick fingers pressing into him, spreading his legs just enough to give John more access as he pumped his fingers quickly within him. The combination of John's mouth sucking him off and his fingers within him sent him spiraling over the edge, spilling down John's throat.
“Sherlock!” He could hear John yelling for him, sending another flare to panic through his mind. He kicked his horse into a gallop, tearing from the stables. “Sherlock! Stop! You’ll get hurt!”
They sat in silence for a long while, Sherlock watching in awe as the beast expertly stitched together his wounds.
John couldn’t breathe. It was true.
"Hey, wait a second, you heard Greg, everyone wants to meet you."
And you've agreed? What has he promised you? – M
“Hi!”
“N-no-”
"Have you-" Sherlock tried to ask, but John leaned forward just as he started speaking and gently sucked on one of his nipples, sending his thoughts flying away with a shocked sound. "J-John-" He felt the older boy chuckle against him.
“Sorry. It’s just a stupid trick. I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“Then don’t.” Sherlock’s voice was firm and it made John’s heart ache. “You have a choice John, you don’t have to-”
“Please John, I can’t lose you again.” John chewed his bottom lip and stepped away from his friend, fighting tears at the pain in Mikey’s eyes.
“Sherlock.” He filled his tone with warning and the young man stopped instantly.
“You need a hospital Sherlock.”
John watched Sherlock throughout the day, his heart swelling every time the boy smiled. He loved seeing his boyfriend happy, and the joy that coursed through his veins as he watched Harry try to decorate Sherlock with leftover tinsel from the tree.
“Maybe he will come back.” John could hear in the clock’s voice that he didn’t believe his own words.
"Witchcraft! He's a demon!" The distressed cries of his crew filled the air. John held the young man's eyes, his lips twitching into a grin. He held up his hand, instantly silencing his men.
“Sher- I-I need- I-It’s my f-fault-”
“Moriarty has incredibly skilled physicians within his web.”
"Come on Watson, we're just having a laugh-"
“I woke up and you weren’t there. I-I had to find you.” John’s heart began racing at those words, his head spinning and hope causing his chest to swell.
"Oi! It's Christmas, I'm allowed to be ridiculous." Sherlock laughed, letting out a soft sound as John kissed him firmly. "I'm glad you came, Christmas would have sucked without you."
"It's fine Love, you need the sleep, and I had homework I had to finish." Sherlock huffed, wriggling as John nipped the skin on his collarbone gently. "You can always stay over if you want. Mum is working tonight-"
“I’m bored John!”
"I was his chemistry partner last year. I haven't seen him around this semester, where is he?"
“Oh, isn’t that sweet?” The camera turned to reveal the grinning face of James Moriarty, John’s blood splattered on his face and shirt. “You and I both know what a man with no Life Force can do to the hearts of those who love him though, so I know you’re coming. In fact, you’re probably already here. Three hours to find us Sherlock Holmes, or the John Watson you’ve fallen for dies, and I get to play with the shell that remains.”
"I'm sorry." Sherlock mumbled, his voice muffled and shy. John crawled onto the bed and lay down beside his boyfriend, nuzzling into the crook of his neck and pressing soft kisses there. "This is not how I envisioned our afternoon going."
"I'm assuming everything is in here?" Sherlock nodded, reaching for the duffel and digging out the little black bag. He set his duffel on the floor and handed John the bag, his nerves starting to return as it finally registered that this was happening. "Do you- I-I mean- top or bottom?" John's cheeks darkened and he chuckled nervously.
The song playing through his headphones reminded him of that. Victor never understood the song, claiming it to be boring and beneath him. Sherlock loved the song, the lyrics never failing to send chills down his spine when he listened to it.
"Fuck me!" John cursed, sending a flash of arousal and anger through Sherlock's body. He was too tired and frustrated with the case to bother with this today.
“Molly!” Sherlock growled at the girl, causing her to laugh. John flushed, trying to hide his face, but getting his hands swatted by Molly.
John remembered that look; the look of twisted glee at the thought of pulling another living being apart. He knew he should be panicking, trying to fight and bargain his way free, but he felt nothing but cold emptiness.
“You’ve aged well.” Sherlock whispered, stepping closer to John and brushing his fingers along the shorter man’s cheekbones.
Neither man lasted long once Sherlock started stroking John's leaking erection. John came first, crying out Sherlock's name as he spilled between them. Sherlock followed close behind, filling the condom and groaning.
“What do you mean you can’t? John-”
“Sherlock? What the-”
“Save him John!” He threw open the door to the Far Wing, the dust swirling heavily as he lowered Sherlock’s unconscious form onto the bed.
We can binge Doctor Who or something – JW
It had been just over a week since they had agreed to take things slow, and the prospect of being alone with John for a whole weekend made Sherlock slightly overwhelmed.
They tugged at each other's clothes, tearing buttons and fighting with laces.
"Hey! Come on in, don't mind the smell, someone died in one of the flats and they been cleaning out her place." Curiosity piqued in the back of Sherlock's mind. "Older lady, lived alone with no family so it took a few days for anyone to notice something was wrong. I eventually had to yell at the Land Lord because the smell got so bad." John lead Sherlock up a small flight of stairs, chattering on about the building and his neighbours.
"Yeah, I uh- I guess that is my name, isn't it?" The boy blushed, smirking up at Sherlock timidly. He looked so young, the smirk on his lips giving him a child-like appearance. "What should I call you?"
“Oh God.” Greg whispered, pushing Mycroft off and stepping closer to the body on the bed.
“I’m so sorry John.” He couldn’t stop himself then, spinning around to face the ghost. The world spun with him and he stumbled, catching himself on the counter before he could fall. Sherlock was standing in the doorway, his arms wrapped around his waist and his head bowed. He looked miserable.
"Fuck me!" Sherlock flinched at the curse. It wasn't the words that bothered him, he was quite fond of cursing himself. It was that specific combination of words coming from that particular mouth, that always gave him pause. Because it never failed, his mind always answered,
"Goodnight John. Thank you for an amazing night."
"What brought this on? And don't say you were bored." John laughed, pressing a soft kiss to the hand that was draped over his shoulders.
“I cast a spell to bind flesh and spirit. He’s upstairs in the private wing.” John felt the crushing panic start to grow when Greg’s face didn’t light up. “John, he-”
"He can't speak to you like that." John pulled him away, leading him down the hall and into the bathroom. "John-"
“God I love you.” He whispered, grinning as Sherlock whimpered and kissed him, sucking on his bottom lip gently.
“Yeah, a contract that takes away my choice in this.”
As much as he loved having any part of John inside him, the angle was wrong in this position and it was just shy of too uncomfortable. He clenched his eyes tightly and tried to relax, knowing it would get better soon. He dropped his head against John's shoulder and bit down on the older man's jumper, not wanting to alarm him.
He was greeted with the excited faces of John's Rugby team.
“What does that mean?” John asked, picking up a bag of herbs and sniffing it, only a little disappointed that it wasn’t weed.
“A-Afghanistan. Wait, how did you-”
The Spider had a fast ship, but John’s little vessel was smaller and quickly outran the massive boat.
“Can you help him?” Mycroft sounded worried, not that John could blame him. Things were not looking good for Sherlock.
“John, there is only one reason my little brother would have fled the town like that. Something happened. And I have a feeling that that something’s name is James Moriarty.”
"God, the things I want to do to you." John mumbled, rubbing his hands over the newly exposed skin, avoiding Sherlock's erection diligently. "And don't think I didn't notice you weren't wearing pants." Sherlock blushed, planning on making a snarky remark about how much John loved it, but his breath caught in his throat and he let himself drop back against his chair as John spat in his palm and gripped his erection. "Pass me the slick." Sherlock whimpered and reached back, digging around in the cushions until he found the bottle they had left there a few nights ago.
Sherlock was wearing a dark purple dress shirt and tight black slacks, the fabric clinging to his thin frame perfectly. He wasn't wearing a tie, but looked no less posh for it. His face was tinted with a dark blush and he was glaring at the woman, who tutted with amusement before scurrying off, leaving the teens alone in the foyer.
"Come on Sherly! You always have to study."
"I love you too John, but seriously, Mrs. Hudson is gone tonight-" John laughed, kissing Sherlock deeply, pulling a soft whimper from the taller boy.
“I’m not allowed in the far wing.”
"Mum, can Sherlock come for ice cream with us?"
“W-Why- I-I don’t-” The Siren sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, flicking his dark tail in irritation.
A/N Hope you guys are liking this!!! Comments are welcome and encouraged!!! Enjoy<3
“Get off me! Let me go! Help! Help!”
“Yep.”
“I-I don’t understand.”
“Sherlock?” John’s voice came from the other side of the door. “Sherlock, what’s going on? Let me in!” He whimpered and reached his hand for the door handle. His hand trembled violently, his wrists burning and pulsing as he fought with the lock.
His computer dinged, notifying him that someone was trying to message him. He swung out of bed and grabbed the laptop, opening his messenger app before he could stop himself.
As the time wore on, Sherlock started to relax, the conversation flowing easily and effortlessly between them.
“Please, let him go.” Sherlock was begging, he wanted John back. He wanted her to leave him alone.
Sherlock was kissing him.
"Don't say it like that, I'm not a dog!"
“No. I’m taking you to bed, then you are going to get lots of rest. Then, once you’ve healed, I will let you do whatever you want to me. Deal?” Sherlock’s eyes darkened, and he leaned forward, trying to kiss John again. The doctor pushed him back, pulling an irritated whine from the young man. “Deal? If you don’t behave I will take sex off the table, understand?” Sherlock froze before nodding, his face darkening. “Understand?”
“Alright.” The Beast carried him out of the room almost effortlessly, the closeness making Sherlock blush lightly.
Not until late Thursday – SH
A sudden commotion further down the hall drew his attention.
“You think I am out of his league?”
“There is no need to be rude Mr. Watson, I am offering you a deal.”
“No.” Sherlock’s vision turned red as the palace crumbled around them. He swung, catching his double in the chin, sending him flying.
“That’s not my name-”
“You wear registration army fatigues in your soldier kink videos, and you carry yourself like a soldier, even when you aren’t filming. Your haircut is only slightly longer than regulation, you prefer it longer but don’t like change, so you keep it at this length. That injury was made by a large gun, sniper rifle probably. You aren’t old enough to have been a cop, so that leaves army.” John blinked at the young man behind him, holding his gaze in the mirror. Sherlock blushed and looked away, glancing around the room as though avoiding John’s eyes.
“Actually, I do.” Sherlock felt a swell of excitement at the thought of new books to read. He grinned at the Librarian, bouncing on his toes as he rifled though some boxes. “I remembered you mentioning that you enjoyed the Fantasy genre, so I hunted down a copy of this.” Mike handed Sherlock a leather-bound book. He ran his fingers over the gold lettering on the front, unable to contain his awe at the book.
“Let him go.” He growled, feeling the tears finally breaking free from his eyes.
"Sorry, hang on a second." John excused himself and stepped away, mumbling into the phone in what was clearly a fake conversation. Greg felt his chest tighten in panic as it became very clear that John and Sherlock would be ditching them. John made his way back, his face set in a grim line.
"I love you too, Tiny Dancer." John whispered, pushing off the wall and spinning so that Sherlock was the one pinned. Sherlock gasped as John sucked a harsh bruise just above his collarbone. "God, the things I want to do to you, right up against that mirror over there." Fire coursed through Sherlock's body and he clung to John, his body trembling.
“I don’t have-”
His knees hit the deck as a harsh note pierced his skull, pulling a scream from his throat and filling his body with pain.
“Sherlock! I didn’t think you would be home.” Moriarty purred as he forced his way into the flat. Moran followed close behind, shoving Sherlock out of his way.
"What the- Harry!" John shouted, his cheeks dark.
Halfway through the movie, Sherlock's phone rang, and the name lighting up his screen made his chest tighten painfully.
"I-I mean, I'm not- I'm not saying I-I'm against it-"
Sherlock parted his lips and sighed as he felt John's tongue slip into his mouth. He gasped and shuddered when John threaded his fingers in his hair, not tugging, simply cradling his head as he sucked on Sherlock's bottom lip, pulling another helpless whimper from the boy.
“What?”
Later that night, John walked Sherlock home, making sure to stay closer than strictly necessary the whole way, his hand brushing against the other boy's as they walked.
Greg stood over the lifeless form in front of him, trying desperately to figure out what happened.
“Yes, you did! You said you were okay, that you wanted to live-” John laughed, a cold, empty sound that sent an unpleasant chill along Sherlock’s spine.
"Most likely. I don't have access to the studio after school, so I may come and watch your practice." John grinned, spinning Sherlock to face him and leaning up, pressing a kiss to his lips, making the taller boy blush.
Sherlock felt terror rise in his chest as the object turned to face him, moving as though it were alive. The base changed to the legs and feet of a human and it walked towards him.
“Yes. If that is agreeable I will have the details sent to your apartment.”
"But you said you were unhappy-"
“I’m you. Well, the part of you that lived.”
“I-I don’t know your name.”
“Fuck you.”
“Sherlock, let me go!”
“Under the bed. There is a small leather case. If I am bound to anything, it would be that.” John nodded and scurried off to try to find the little case. When he found it, he unzipped it, gasping at the contents.
“S-Sherlock.” He fought to keep his voice steady, failing miserably. He saw the clock hesitate, and if his eyes weren’t deceiving him, he could have sworn he saw it look sad.
“John!”
“This is Sherlock. I was hit by that storm, Sherlock saved me.”
"Alright," Lestrade sighed again, looking nearly as uncomfortable as Sherlock felt. "So, what does John think about this?"
"And what was your plan?"
"John-" Sherlock bit back a cry as John wormed his hand under his shirt and pinched one of his nipples just shy of too hard.
"I'm so proud of you Tiny Dancer." John whispered, smiling proudly at his boyfriend. "And I love you so much. We're going to be fine Babe, promise. I'm not going to let you go that easily." Sherlock nodded, his eyes uncertain but hopeful. "Happy birthday Love."
"You." He whispered against John's lips before biting gently on his bottom one. John chuckled, tightening his grip on Sherlock's hips.
“Good!” She scurried behind him, pushing him forward until he almost ran into one of the makeup chairs. “Sorry again, I just need to get you prepped. The producers have a stick up their ass today because His Royal Pain pissed them off again. Take a seat and I’ll go get my stuff.” John took a seat as asked and placed his bookbag on the ground, glancing around the room.
Sherlock was incredibly pale and swaying slightly on his feet.
“Was it worth the wait?”
“What did I say? Kill him now!” Moriarty shouted stepping closer to Sherlock.
“He saved my arse from a storm a while back. How do you know Sherlock?”
Sherlock heard his name being called faintly and glanced up from the textbook he was studying, a sharp dismissal planned for anyone but Mrs. Hudson.
“Wait, you aren’t mad?” Sherlock followed along behind him, limping as the pain in his thighs grew.
“I’m sure you know my name by now, Miss Adler.” The wardrobe walked around him, clucking her tongue as her eyes raked over his form.
“You are a med student as well?” He asked, studying her closely for the first time. She nodded, her skilled hands checking his pulse and vitals.
“I’ll be back, nature calls.” John said with a wink before sliding out of the booth. Sherlock watched him walk away, loathing him for leaving him alone with the touchy Mike.
"No, I don't. I told him that he was going to leave Mum like that, then he could lose my number too. Tell him to get fucked." John yelped as Sherlock swatted him, sending his boyfriend a mischievous grin. "That all Bug?"
“Jesus fuck-”
“J-John I-”
"Victor, and no. He and I are no longer together. You are welcome to join me though." John blushed and pulled out the seat, sitting across from Sherlock and offering him a sympathetic smile.
He slammed against Sherlock's prostate brutally, making the taller man's knees buckle.
“How does that work? I mean, you can’t touch or anything, right?” John tried to fight the blush that rose on his cheeks, realizing how miserably he failed when Greg’s eyes widened. “You can touch? How?”
