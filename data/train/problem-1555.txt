He glances up at Sherlock and something shifts, solidifies. It’s startling, unnerving in a lovely way, and John knows as surely as he’s known anything, that he can do this.
Sherlock thought for a moment, touched by John’s slight insecurity, feeling warm to the tips of his ears with it. “Oh, I suppose as John Watson.”
God, he feels pathetic, absolutely ridiculous. It shouldn’t matter! It
John laughs and glances down at the mess of his clothing, thinking nothing of Sherlock’s comment.
John’s smile flickered and then turned into a grin. “Yeah, alright, well… you look, you need a shower.”
Sherlock threw his hands out at his side. “What good would arguing do. And… it’s logical. It makes sense.” He lifted his head and their gazes met. “I appreciate it.”
Sherlock says nothing in regard to the fact that they’ll be sharing a room, just shifts his duffle higher on his shoulder and says, “Room twelve,” and starts off, leaving John to follow behind—and he does just that.
,” he muttered, trying to pry the complex knots apart. “Fuck.”
Sherlock managed a long workout, settling into his routine easily, allowing his mind to run over and over the turns in the course as he churned out leg press after leg press. It felt wonderful to sweat out his frustrations of the previous day, getting five miles in on the treadmill before he realized how far he’d run. He opted to run two more as he wasn’t fatigued and his legs felt strong; he’d gotten so much sleep the night before that he knew he’d have some extra energy to burn after an entire evening sitting at the opening ceremonies - the extra distance would do him good.
and Sherlock let it continue for a moment longer before making his presence known. “John.”
“John,” Sherlock said, throat thick with the sudden onslaught of emotion, his head resting in his upturned palm.
Immediately his eyes went up to the leaderboard: 2:13:57.
It was all a bit too close to being properly domestic for he and Sherlock, though. Or, in John’s opinion, they were shifting closer and closer to a domestic partnership, a living situation much like they had prior to Sherlock’s disappearance, but now with added scars, ghosts, baggage, and, well… children.
A few more strands of hair slip through the vees of John’s fingers. “BBC wouldn’t have been able to stop the wind, either.”
, taking the first turn with very little effort at all; he’d have to remember the ease with which they responded. If he threw too much weight into a turn he’d skid out. Sherlock committed the note to memory in a split second and focused on the next bit of the course. He focused precisely on the stetch of snow in front of him, shifting his knees and his hips, faltering slightly as he hit a carved section of the snow. Righting himself with an adjustment to his pole, he flew over a small but significant jump.
: I’d be interested to know as well.
“No one there?”
They finished their meal quickly and in a comfortable silence; there was no real discussion of what the plan was. Sherlock was quite sure that he and John were on the same page and John gave the impression that he could not only hold his own, but was quite capable under pressure.
He sounds shocked, utterly unmoored when he gasps, “John! God!”
and-”
“Over,” John says into Sherlock’s mouth, slapping at his hip bone.
Sherlock makes it through an entire qualifier before he even begins digging into the competitors.
. He wonders why this man wants to talk with him, wonders how desperate and sad and
It’s frustrating, this stagnation, but he doesn’t know how to proceed, doesn’t know how to spur them forward. The words form in his mind, but he never seems able to speak them. The onus shouldn’t be on Sherlock alone, but John finds it very nearly incapacitating, the fear of speaking his love to the one person he cannot bear to lose. He’s never understood this, how he can be so free and open about dating, about sex, but how love absolutely terrifies him, even being aware of how Sherlock feels. Perhaps, John grants, it’s the idea of everything changing, the life they’ve so carefully built and rebuilt, destroyed and repaired, changing once again.
Lestrade’s eyes go a bit wide at that, “Molly! ...Hooper!” The disbelief in Lestrade’s voice is expected. Sherlock has been dodging her advances for years, and while he isn’t interested in her romantically, he does rather think her a friend. It’s really
Sherlock fiddles with his phone, notices a new text message from Lestrade:
It occurs to him that his brain is caught up in a bit of a whirlwind, his heart hammering so fast he feels as though he might waver a bit. This is something he’s been waiting for—they’ve both been waiting for, so elusive—for eons that he doesn’t want to rush through. They have all night, really, alone. Together. They deserve it, to allow themselves the time to experience one another without hurry.
“You know we did,” John grumbles in return. “If we’re going to be working alongside one another I’d rather we try and be civil, so…” John sucks in a breath, his chest puffing out. “Thank you for the coffee the other day. And today actually. I’ll get you back.”
Sherlock hadn’t had much Russian food before, but that unfortunately seemed to be the only option available to them outside of the Village cafeterias; he’d make do with whatever John chose, he was sure, as food wasn’t particularly important to him. “Why don’t we just walk until we find something that catches our fancy?” John had suggested, and lacking any recommendation of his own, Sherlock agreed.
Sherlock swallows, squeezes John’s shoulders one last time before separating their bodies entirely. “Care to see my bedroom?”
John deletes the smiley face he’d typed on instinct and sends off his reply.
“Fine,” comes Sherlock’s voice from the hallway. “One more hour.”
John dots one last kiss on Sherlock’s shoulder before he’s being tugged insistently towards sleep, thrilled with the prospect of waking up beside him tomorrow, telling him all of the things he’s wanted to tell him for years and years.
Sherlock scoffs again. “The ladies know I like men.”
John cracks his knuckles, takes a quick little sip from his water bottle, and opens the email.
Sherlock hummed happily into John’s skin as John got his breath back, languid movement coming back to his limbs as he shifted to his side and curled around Sherlock. John trailed a hand through the mess on his stomach and licked at Sherlock’s cheek. “C’mere, you.”
It is, without a doubt, one of John’s favorite expressions, and never fails to make him feel perfectly warm. It’s a feeling that lends such credence and such clarity to their situation, that John sighs, licks his lips in an attempt to bring moisture to his parched mouth. “Sherlock—”
“John,” he returned without taking his eyes off of Sherlock; the tension hung thick in the air.
Sherlock searched John’s eyes, his face, before he brought a hand up to skim the backs of his fingertips over a cheek. “I am, yes. I very much am.” When his hand fell to his lap John tipped forward, their lips brushing intimately, slowly.
“Yes. Well. The shoulder, then,” John reasons, suddenly finding himself warm at their lighthearted exchange. “And, you know, chasing after you for a good four hours, it takes a toll on the body.”
And then she’s gone, in through the door of Speedy’s and Sherlock’s heart begins beating so fast he’s rather sure he’s about to have a heart attack. He begins counting the seconds as they tick away, fifteen, fifty, three-hundred and twenty-one. Sherlock remains stock-still on the pavement, even as he wants to tear at his hair, dash inside, phone Molly and tell her to
“Yes, we’re really having sex,” Sherlock deadpans.  He’s full to the brim with something he can’t place, something like love but so much larger, that he can’t acknowledge it head-on. John’s going to marry him, and John’s as much in wonder as he is, and it’s all a bit too much.
“Very
He flew over the Russian Trampoline, gaining speed, diving into the Accala Valley with determination, poles a weight between his arms and torso. Gritting his teeth, he skied a few meters outside of the course, angling himself back onto the proper side of the blue line just in time to contend with the hard, icy conditions into which the lower part of the course had frozen.
“Would you like me to go in, grab a coffee, maybe see if I can figure out what he looks like?”
John knows, or had suspected, that Sherlock had been through rehab before, though he never speaks of it. “Ah,” is all he says in response, his blood rushing uncomfortably in his ears, his heartbeat picking up.
“Your eyes linger on my chest in this shirt an average of two seconds longer than in anything else,” Sherlock mumbles, doing his best to rid himself of his socks while remaining upright and standing in front of John.
Love.
“Mmmkay,” John says, bringing their mouths back together. He loses some of his finesse, his kisses turning sloppy as Sherlock curves his finger inside, massages. “Oh, fuck… yes,” John’s forehead falls to Sherlock’s sternum as he rocks back into the pressure. “Should be… doing that to you,” he manages, smearing a kiss across Sherlock’s right pectoral.
John nods, and waits a beat. “What’s all this then?”
There was a long, pregnant silence and Sherlock glanced down at his phone to make sure the call was still connected. “I have a point,” Mycroft said flatly.
“Are you saying your approach is better than others’?” the reporter asked, shoving the microphone right into Sherlock’s face, nearly hitting him in the mouth. It was a question he’d been asked before numerous times and at Lestrade’s behest had demurred and changed the subject or had ended the line of inquiry with a cutting remark; even now, as elated as he was at his finishing time, his ire began to rise at the insipid questioning.
Sherlock bonks his head three times against the sofa and presses a thumb and a forefinger to the inner corners of his eyes. “What I said! Imbecile, positively uncalled for. He’ll never… John will never…” Swallowing thickly, he reminds himself that John doesn’t yet know that he is indeed Guest. John knows nothing of Guest, has no idea why Guest stood him up.
“Yep.” And they kiss, John slotting his knee between Sherlock’s legs. Seconds, minutes, of hot breath and lips catching, small, vulnerable sounds that float up and out and around. It’s unlike anything 221B has ever heard. John’s hands stray to the jut of a hip, an interested cock, the dip of a navel. There’s too much skin for both of them to handle and their hands become shaky and greedy, sweaty as they reach and grasp.
“Oh.”
Sherlock wanted so badly to touch him, to make his way across the room and take John in his arms. He wanted to be a balm to his wounds, apologize for the mess he’d gotten them into, swear that he would spend his life making it up to John. Instead, he said, “Shut up, just conserve your energy, we’ll, we’ll-”
It’s very nearly unbearable, the ping-ponging of emotions that he’s experiencing, the juxtaposed thoughts. He consciously makes an effort and banishes them, sitting down hard in front of his laptop. Perhaps it will be easier to suss out exactly what he wants to do about this–if anything at all–if he actually talks to Guest.
Sherlock leans in and runs his nose up the left side of John’s neck, curling his palms around John’s hips and ending with a dot of a kiss to the curve of his jaw. “Lots of time to figure that out, John.”
“I think so,” John said. “I really, really do.”
“Ah, yeah, CPU instead of a heart? Encyclopedia instead of a brain?” And then John smiles. The words land hard and oily between them.
John’s face changed, excitement warring with the need to be reserved. “I wouldn’t want to get you into any more trouble than I already have.”
They would be alive
John rolls his eyes again; of course overt displays of emotion would knock Sherlock into some sort of robotic, nonsensical diatribe. “What the hell are you saying, Sherlock?” There’s no heat in the question, just honest inquiry.
He has a bit of an out-of-body experience as Sherlock slides his Black Card across the fashionably-distressed check-in desk, the clerk’s eyes flicking between the card and Sherlock’s face. The man behind the desk throws a knowing smile John’s way, and he finds himself doing nothing more than giving a small, resigned sigh.
“Two thousand pounds, Sherlock, and you don’t know if you were ever paid it? Christ, must be nice not to have to worry about money.”
Though Holmes placed first, it was with a meager lead of just .07 seconds. James Moriarty, the leading men’s downhill racer out of Bern is a force to contend with. Also in his fourth Olympics, but with the distinct edge of being younger in years, Moriarty has fired shots at Holmes this past season, commenting on the skier’s age and agility. “I tend not to waste my time thinking about him; he’s nothing to me,” Holmes said following his first place win at Beaver Creek.
care. About your career, and about…” Licking his lips, John glancing quickly to his left and to his right. “People who identify as gay being far more out… and proud.”
“Fine,” he grumbles, gaze sliding to the floor. “I’m… meeting with someone this evening.”
John squints at the text, rereads it and types his response.
Sherlock Holmes is a terrible man, to do this to someone he cares about, and for his own personal gain. He’s a selfish, deceitful, egomaniacal waste of a man, certainly not of the moral calibre that someone like John Watson deserves.
“But I always forget something!” Sherlock whine-laughed, turning to pick up the mail John had discarded.
“I won’t,” John promises, and watches as Sherlock steps out of the shower and wraps himself in a bath sheet.
, army veteran…” Sherlock leads, ticking off the traits one by one.
He’d won the gold medal. His first gold medal. After a lifetime of near misses, it was his. Finally.
The black cloud that had threatened to storm over his mind palace recedes as he steps onto the elevator. “Lunch. Yes.”
: That’s a very specific question, may I ask how the person would have come to sustain such an injury?
John’s laughter jostles Sherlock’s body; their skin peels away from one another, a little sting. “‘Right, didn’t have to, but-”
Sherlock Holmes wanted John forever, wanted him properly, domestically and romantically. Sherlock swallowed against the shock of the realization and briefly considered whether it was too soon to voice such a desire, especially given the circumstances.
The images bring fond memories to the forefront of John’s mind; a simpler time, a happier time, a time when they were both unencumbered by so much pain. John binds the whole lot of them together with a rubber band and tosses them into a box he’s specifically marked to keep.  Perhaps years down the line he’ll sort them all into an album, maybe use some as examples in the book he keeps daydreaming about writing.
Sherlock settles beneath the blankets, and allows his eyes to fall closed and John watches Sherlock relax, watches as his body sinks into its preferred sleeping arrangement. A fuzzy sort of pride overtakes John as he gazes upon the man he loves, resting. Trusting him to be near while he’s at rest.
John blinks; there’s room for so many telling words here, but Sherlock finishes, “...making love to you.”
Sherlock rubbed his hands over his face and watched as Greg sank down into a chair. “John has convinced me that we need to take this to the IOC, go through the proper channels. If this blows up in our face, we’ll have our bases covered.”
Once John has his soy sauce set, he delves back into conversation. “So you’re a detective?”
Sherlock hit the hard-packed snow with such a force he felt it in his teeth, and at the sensation he growled, smiled and ground down.
“Work… at a morgue.” John states and thinks about it for a time. Sure, he can’t perform surgery on living being anymore, he’d never be certified. His cheeks jumps in frustration as he admits that to himself and he grinds his teeth, waiting a beat for the feeling to dissipate.
When they’re through with the third training run of the Giant Slalom and Sherlock has ensured he has the next fourteen hours to himself, he texts John–finally–to meet at a restaurant on the edge of the Olympic Village.
There’s a grunt and a snuff and Sherlock is wriggling down, falling asleep, still wearing his freshly-pressed suited.
“Yes.”
For a moment in the air, everything went blissfully quiet and still; his breath halted in his chest and his mind blinked offline for the briefest of flashes.
John peeks up, lips pursed, and finds Sherlock wearing a completely blank expression. It’s only a beat before they’re giggling, John drawing Sherlock into his body and holding him fiercely close, face in Sherlock’s stomach as their giggles peter out.
Sherlock frowned and pressed on, “And considering that the rumors would be even more damning in the current political climate, I don’t think it’s-”
, his username showing up as active and online in Sherlock’s contacts. For a brief, insane moment, Sherlock considers messaging him and calling the whole bit off. Instead, he closes his laptop, carefully gets up and shuts all of the lights.
Sherlock tugged at his shorts and stood, a false smile on his mouth as he looked down at his opponent. “Brilliant seeing you, ta!” He made a move to step around Moriarty but was halted when an arm shot out, blocking Sherlock’s path out to the main gym.
“I’m guessing you don’t drink.” John sauntered up, mouth curled in a welcoming grin; he looked happy and carefree and for an inexplicable beat, Sherlock resented him.
“I’m not as young as I used to be.”
“Together?”
, yes?” Sherlock scoffed aloud and rolled his eyes, batting away John’s concern with a flip of his hand. “You’re in this too. If something goes awry you’ll be scrutinized as well. Can you handle that? Are you willing to risk your reputation for something that may prove fruitless?”
Sherlock huffs a little laugh, picks at a piece of broccoli, and then just moves it about the plate. He feels uncharacteristically nervous, as though there is something fluttering inside of him, desperate to emerge. He glances briefly at John, and John gazes back..
He makes his way up a slight incline and onto the large, main walkway. He turns left and halts as his pupils dilate against the burst of color with which he is assailed. Lilac bedded next to blood orange bedded next to vibrant cobalt. He takes a moment to process it all, the strictly laid out flower beds and the sweet floral scent emanating from them. The cherry blossoms hang full and lush from drooping branches and tulips and daisies sway happily beside one another in the gentle wind.
“S’not the point.”
“I ah,” John groaned a little; Sherlock pictured him stretching in his bed on the other side of Olympic Village. “Can’t do much in the way of providing medical attention with the state I’m in and they cleared me to fly in about a week, so.”
With bated breath,Sherlock opens the email, only to read,
“Right,” John laughed and crossed to stand in between the two rooms. “Not creepy at all.”
“Leather on my bare arse? Ah, no,” and John steps back, gives Sherlock a little shove and Sherlock goes willingly down on the bed, backside bouncing as he lands.
By the time he’d finished up with the fans, a wave of exhaustion overtook him and he longed desperately for the sanctuary of his room. Sherlock quickened his steps, weaving through the groups of people en route to his hotel. The soreness in his thighs began to make itself known and he had to stop, lean over and stretch it out; he would indeed have to excel in his two remaining training runs on Rosa Khutor if he expected his body to respond in a manner with which he was comfortable.
He paces himself and tries to take it all in, and by the time he makes it at last to his desired exit gate, it’s been nearly two hours and his leg is beginning to protest. John ponders stopping for a coffee on his way to the Tube and hasn’t made up his mind when he hears someone calling out behind him.
“Hm?” John’s eyes take a moment, sliding across the floor until his gaze meets Sherlock’s feet and begins to trail up his  body.
It’s…
Sherlock pulls back a fraction, smooths his hands over John’s shoulders. “I want to. More than you could possibly know. I’m reasonably sure I’ve conjured every distinct possibility and nuance of…”
He’s worrying his bottom lip when a dialog box pops open in his email client.
Once John’s eyes adjust, he’s completely out of words. The walls are entirely glassy, most of them showing the wear of glass that has spent some time by the sea. “Is this-”
Standing before him, Sherlock shrugged and said quietly, “Yes you do.”
owe his fantastic performance to John Watson and Sherlock couldn’t wait to suss out just
“Okay?” John breathes, eyes never leaving Sherlock’s gaze.
“Please don’t insult my-”
, and the thought caused his stomach to lurch.
“I believe that I took you home,” Sherlock rumbles after a moment, jostling his leg against John’s. John giggles, tilting his head in agreement.
Sherlock types.
“Thankfully,” Sherlock intones.
The adrenaline was coursing through Sherlock’s veins and he could see from John’s profile that he was rather amped up as well. They’d just broken into the flat of one of the most famous skiers in the
Sherlock put the phone down and sat back in shock. His fingers moved stiffly over the keys of his laptop as he pulled up information about Hanzu. He didn’t know much about the skier, other than that he was new on the scene and he’d been training for the games in Switzerland with a cutthroat American coach. No one had expected the twenty-something to medal, but they certainly hadn’t expected him to
It’s another moment or two before the silence is broken, John’s voice cutting cleanly through Sherlock’s reverie. The words hold a lightness, something like amusement, but there’s no mistaking them for anything other than John calling him out for his behavior. “Is there something on my face?”
The bathroom is beautiful. White tile and brass furnishings with a high ceiling and a large, inset stone shower; but the focal point of the room is the oversized clawfoot tub that’s set in a corner, set in such a way as to overlook a portion of the cliff they’re on. It’s incredibly breathtaking as John watches the early winter sea smash against the slate.
“Oh, yes, right, sorry. I just saved you from being killed but right, definitely be a dick to me.” John’s arms came loose and Greg set about working on freeing John’s legs.
“Mmm, yes,
Sherlock felt like he was being picked apart slowly from the inside and being sewn straight back together, moment by moment, waiting for John’s next move, next words.
John presses his lips firmly together and huffs out his irritation through his nose. If Sherlock can be smarmy and patronizing, so can he. “Your
“You’re not sleeping well, knowing that and knowing that you’ve kept that phone, took a job in the morgue when you’re clearly more qualified…you must not enjoy the place you’re living. I could go on, but.” Sherlock sigh and looks down into his wine glass, finds that he’s nervous for John’s reaction.
“I,” he rolls his eyes, his optic nerves feeling the strain of this gesture more acutely as he’s employed it heavily over the last hour. “He’s not… awful.”
“So much has changed, Shannon. So much. It’s been nearly two decades since I started doing this professionally and as it’s all coming to an end, yes, so much has changed. Thanks,” and with that, Sherlock ducked away to take another interview, another, and then another, evading questions and being courteous and gracious until the last of the television interviews had been dealt with.
Carefully, Sherlock rearranged his hand to clutch tightly at John, intertwining their fingers; he leaned over and brushed his lips against John’s knuckles before resting their hands back on the side of John’s cot. His anger slipped away as he felt John squeeze weakly at his hand.
“Haven’t had sushi in a bit, so…” John trails off, flicking his menu down, with a lick of his lips.
Sherlock pursed his lips as his arms twitched and he glanced into the distance, over John’s right shoulder. “I abhor speaking on the phone; I prefer to text.”
Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, his eyes falling closed, and ran his hands up and down John’s sides, pausing to cup his hips. “Mmm, yes, that I can see.”
For a moment, there’s a feeling of personal offense at Sherlock believing that John is capable of anything like that. John sorts through the reasoning in his mind, and discovers that he’s devastated, more than anything else, that Sherlock could feel like that.
Sherlock glances down from the cup to John, and smiles. “I do.” He ducks his head, takes a hearty swig of his coffee and nods at John as he maneuvers around him, towards the door.  “Good day,” he says, and he grins as he
When the tub is properly full, he gets in; the water’s a bit too hot, but he sinks down into it anyway, relaxing against the porcelain. It’s never quite felt right, here. The loo is nice enough, clean and bright and really, everything anyone could want in a bathroom. The tub and shower combination is even a bit bigger than Baker Street had been, but it’s just not the same.
The blue slope markers blurred as he he cut left, getting a good jump on the gate, thwacking it with his pole as he immediately cut right and hit the next gate as well, coming off the tight curve with power and speed. There was a moment when he wobbled, tipping just outside of the blue markings in the snow, but he got it back, just as he propelled himself into another deadly sharp right turn.
“Properly?” Sherlock parrots, a coy little smile touching his mouth.
“Dull.”
“So…”
“Horrifying, yes, positively abysmal.”
A bright coil, something real and tangible, snaps and John says nothing, manages the tiniest, choked noise, and he comes, wringing himself out. There are three stuttered thrusts before John stops entirely, head drooping into the hollow between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, briefly. When he pulls back, it’s with an exhausted, “Oh, fuck,” and then he’s grasping Sherlock’s prick in his right hand and tugging.
“My….” Sherlock sighed, “Mine, just… just mine.”
that maybe he’s one who does.
Sherlock snuck from John’s room with a quick peek in either direction; it wouldn’t do to fuel the rumor mill.
After rinsing himself in the shower, Sherlock toweled off and meandered naked back into the bedroom. He crawled into bed, settled his wet head against the pillow and stared up at the ceiling. He’d raced unbelievably today and he could be proud of the time he’d put up. If only his nemesis hadn’t been so close on his heels, he would surely have felt much better.
The sun was bright and high in the sky by the time Sherlock had made his way up the mountain with his people in tow. It was unseasonably warm again, and the bright light made the melting snow shine brilliantly, stinging his eyes even behind the veil of his sunglasses.
“Good.”
“About
This, John realizes, could very well be it, the impetus to move them past the amorphous roadblock they’ve been lingering behind. A thrill runs through him at the thought, at all of the possibilities that the upcoming evening could hold.
It’s a statement.
“Right, well, don’t die on the slopes and we can see about making that happen when we get back.” John sealed the deal by drumming the fingers of his hand on the table and shooting Sherlock a wink he could only describe as promising.
Instead he finds his eyes focusing on an email from Guest titled “Suspicious death.”
He tosses back the blankets and tugs on a pair of jeans, Redbeard yawning when he appears at his side. “Come on, it’s terrible out, don’t dawdle.” And with that they take to Regent’s Park for a short walk, during which Sherlock manages to wake up.
: I don’t want to wait that long, I don’t know if I can.
Mycroft cleared his throat. “Mother and father are… they’re coming to the city and we’re to watch the coverage together.”
, these online chats and emails, forever. Or, or… he could meet the person on the other end of the computer, he could meet the person that he’s been sharing aspects of his life with for these past weeks.
something?
assumed drug deal gone wrong. But these here,” Sherlock stabs the photograph of the crime scene. “If these are staples you’re looking at a surgical mishap. Location of the supposed staples indicates some sort of incision to the abdomen, likely meaning that the victim was certainly out of the hospital against medical advice as they’d keep a patient with such an incision bedridden until healing was further along. Check the local hospitals for anyone with abdominal surgery who left against medical advice.”
He hits the ‘a’ button and holds it down, watching, hypnotized as the letter repeats and repeats, producing three lines of text before he removes it all with purposeful taps of the 'delete' key.
John thought for a moment, pouring some bath liquid beneath the tap before crossing to the sink. Their eyes met in the mirror. “Dancing and tequila, I suppose.”
“Vodka soda.”
“Oh, listen to me,” Moriarty cut in once more. “Wrapping it all up like I’m a villain in a bad movie. Do excuse me, I can admit it, I’m a
John’s grasps at Sherlock’s nape and presses him down into the mattress as he slips his fingers in and drags them out, hips rocking along with the movement. There’s a humming behind him and it takes searching through the fog in his brain to vaguely come to realize it’s John making the sound.
“Well,” John repeats, shoving his hands into his pockets. “It was…”
“Yes, love,” John amends and steps up to him, dips his head until Sherlock glances up and catches his gaze. “I know that.”
Hips move, unhurriedly; they have all the time in the world. John tipping over Sherlock’s torso, his lips smearing against Sherlock’s chin. “God, you, you…”
Sherlock doesn’t sleep that evening, instead remaining awake to check on various bacterias and their growth. He needs to check them hourly, so in the meantime he composes. In the morning, after a brief and fruitless shouting session with Lestrade, he realizes that he hasn’t been to Barts in some time, and suits up for the jaunt across town.
“Psychosomatic, don’t bother!” Sherlock cuts him off, and a grin breaks across John’s face. He’s quite happy that the limp is technically just in his head, but he’s sure he wouldn’t have discovered that had it not been for Sherlock.
Together, they made their way to the starting hut, in which were gathered the first six skiers of his qualifying round. None of them spoke to each other, instead conferring with their trainers and coaches in hushed tones; Sherlock and his company were silent.
They fall into companionable silence for awhile, both lost in their thoughts until Mike picks the thread of the conversation back up. “What about you? Any prospects on the horizon?”
“But you let me,” Sherlock said curiously, more for his own benefit than for John’s, and the two of them stood there on the pavement in silence as Sherlock retreated into his mind to puzzle out that bit of information.
Sherlock interrupted abruptly, with a warm, comforting hand to John’s shoulder. “But we weren’t, John. Now, what did he
“John,” he called nearly desperate, just before the man had disappeared down the corridor towards his room. He turned and looked back at Sherlock with a hopeful expression. “I did,” Sherlock swallowed thickly, suddenly quite nervous. “Have fun, that is.”
“It does make sense. And it…doesn’t. Sometimes, and forgive my own foray into hyperbole, but, often times it seems as though I was simply existing, waiting for you to arrive in my life. Which is a stupidly, tragically romantic and an intrinsically fictionalized way to say… you’re the only possible thing I’ve felt as though I’d been fated for.”
So it’s up to him to convince John–without bloody
When he’s not taking the Tube out to Edgeware Road for appointments, John is learning how to navigate the complex landscape of the modern internet. He’s got email down, but he learns through some information that veteran's affairs sends--that he begrudgingly admits is helpful--that setting up profiles on LinkedIn and Facebook may not just help him in staying connected, but also help him to find work.
But he wants to, desperately.
“Will do,” the tech reassured, and with the assistance of the rest of his team got Sherlock securely into his equipment. He exchanged a glance with Molly only once; her mouth was set in a severe thin line and she had dark circles under her eyes. Lestrade must have spoken to her before they’d gone to bed.
The email has a finality to it, though John feels the urge to reply back with something. The pads of his fingers slide over the grooves in the keys, but he can’t think of anything to say that isn’t entirely too familiar. John wants to ask, “Why me? Why are you asking me these questions? Why are you so curt? What do you do? Why do you bother? What is your name?” but he doesn’t, just shuts the window of his email and feels a little bit sadder for it.
“I guess you have to wheel yourself in,” Greg said, bemused.
Crossing the finish line, he caught sight of his time and tossed his arms and poles up in the air, grinning towards the sky. It was a run he’d been hoping for, technically flawless; Sherlock was over the moon. He was so exhilarated that when he tore off his helmet he let out a boisterous whoop and turned towards the crowd before bowing his body backward and letting out another loud exclamation of, “Yes!”
Sherlock just blinks at him, looking lost, and John is transported back, four years ago, to Sherlock helping him into the tub. “You make me feel… very lucky.”
“Bruised ribs, fractured foot, otherwise fine, though I’m sure we’ll both be feeling this for more than a few days. It’s a miracle there was no internal bleeding. Quite lucky that Moran hadn’t thought to put on his steel-toed boots this morning.”
“Sorry, wait, do we know one another? I-”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Oh, god.” He slid into the booth across from Molly. “We’re not telling anyone yet Molly so it would be-”
Sherlock’s gaze suddenly went stormy again. “We’re talking about people being
, tuckered out in Sherlock’s bed. His insides twisted at the thought of the right side of his spacious bed unoccupied, John gone from it. Sherlock was shocked to discover in that instant that he wanted John in his bed not just for the evening, but
After his first Olympics in Salt Lake City, Sherlock had realized that the dorm-living situation was not to his liking. The other athletes treated their time away as an excuse to party and have sex, neither of which particularly interested Sherlock. The athletes were some of the most fit and beautiful people it the world; it made sense that things tended towards the carnal and physical. Sherlock had no time to indulge in such mindless pleasures, so he left the lesser minds to the more base pleasures, putting in more time in the gym and on the slopes, improving.
Sherlock isn’t at all surprised he finds himself a bit melancholy that things are wrapping up. Even as a non-competitor, he’s been inspired these past few weeks, filled with anticipation and elation at being back on skiing’s largest stage. It’s sad that it’s ending, that it will be four years before he’s asked to participate in something this large and all-encompassing again—if he’s even invited back at all.
Sherlock tilts his head to the left, to the right, getting anxious over what he’s missing.
John peeked an eye open and then the other, glancing at Sherlock with an expression that bordered on impressed, though Sherlock couldn’t be sure; John seemed to be just as hesitant to engage Sherlock as Sherlock had been to engage him. He pursed his lips and sighed, folding his hands in his lap and making a very obvious display of giving Sherlock a onceover of his own. “Perhaps I didn’t want to.”
John’s grin has an edge to it, and Sherlock glares at him until he spits it out. “You’re such a poncy git. They’d
His nose flares at the image, but Lestrade accepts Sherlock’s magnifier and checks out the photo. “Christ, the medical examiner couldn’t even get a look at that before they got him in a body bag. Wrong place, wrong time?”
“We need to interview the McCann widow tomorrow,” Sherlock says, voice completely level and serious.
“Three years ago I successfully proved at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking.” John smiles at him, first with his eyes, then at his whole face.
“You’ll get it next time,” John said pleasantly, and returned to lounging against the booth. Sherlock, for his part, was caught up by John’s response.
The 35-year-old, now in the twilight of his career, is going to Sochi to compete in his fourth and final Olympic games, where he assures me he intends to take gold. “I’ve just completed one of the best seasons of my career,” he tells me as he adds a heaping scoop of sugar to his tea. “My body is capable, my mind is focused; I’m ready.”
Lestrade sidled up to him as he was peeling off his Lycra in the hut. “Bit of advice?”
“Hmmm, acceptable,” Sherlock says, and at the look that crosses John’s face, he continues, “Bit preoccupied with what happens after the date.” He clips the ‘t’ hard, as he might when having a bit of a go at someone, but John is aware that the tic extends to the few times his nerves get the best of him.
John feels his cheeks flame, both from the idea that Sherlock has sex at alland from the images his mind unwittingly conjures for him. There’s a hard pit in his stomach, something uncomfortable, that always seems to form whenever John thinks about Sherlock being intimate in any way at all with a person other than himself.
Sherlock swallows thickly, feels dizzy, as though he may topple right over.
“The last time I was here I was with my brother,” he mentions off-hand, then is pulled up short by the fact that he’s mentioned his brother so willingly. “It was…unbearable.”
Lestrade licked his lips and took a shaky breath. “Alright, what, lay it on me. What’s wrong with this situation, what could possibly be wrong. Tell me everything now before I go in headfirst and cock it all up.”
“Are you quite through?” Sherlock growled and stood, motioning for the rest of his prep crew to make their way over.
“Not- it wasn’t a direct threat, but he made it seem as though he was aware someone had been in their villa. Which would mean that he went back there before they went to -  Christ Sherlock, we could have been caught! You would have been-“
Sherlock’s mouth opens to speak, but he stops as a woman steps up, letting them know that their table is ready. Sherlock steps in front, leading as always, and John steps behind him, thrilled to place his fingers just barely at the small of Sherlock’s back. It’s such a casually intimate gesture it makes John’s breath stutter for a moment as he glances down at the pads of his fingers where they brush the expensive silk of Sherlock’s suit jacket.
“Don’t flatter yourself John,” Sherlock responds, but then, apparently thinks better of it. “But yes, let’s hope not.”
All he can hope for is that John can accept what has happened. And how odd, he finds, that he wants to be the very best version of himself for John Watson. How keenly perplexing.
‘Fuck you,’ he types into the chat box and hits enter, although he knows no one will read it.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock toys with his fork, turning it this way and that, the both of them focusing their attention on the movement of the utensil. Another long beat of quiet stretches between them, welcome and unhurried. “There are plenty of things that need saying. Though, I should remind you that I’m not well-versed in how these matters… proceed.” Sherlock’s gaze lifts to John’s once more, the flickering light of the candle making his irises glitter, very-nearly twinkle.
“Yeah,” John agreed with a gasp and a lick of his lips. “Yes.”
Luckily, a waiter arrives with a bevy of dishes and begins setting them down. Sherlock keeps his gaze on the plates being set down and John keeps his gaze set on him.
The structure looked as though it had been completed just yesterday and the layout looked both confusing and ill-reasoned.  It was a good bet that there wasn’t any security on the premises; even if Moriarty had contracted someone to install a system, it would likely be bulky and ostentatious - Sherlock couldn’t imagine Sochi offered much in the way of surveillance equipment. Besides, Moriarty was paranoid but he was certainly more concerned with his ego; with the way he was presenting like a peacock, Sherlock doubted he’d felt the

is Molly,” Sherlock growls, prattling on. “She’s far too leisurely this morning, a side effect of your first day? Unclear, but this won’t do!”
Sherlock stills entirely, blinking silently at John. When it’s apparent that Sherlock isn’t following the thread of John’s own thought, he explains, “Want to, you know, savor this.”
at any of this? Sherlock is deficient and defunct, so outside of the realm of normal that not pointing this out to John feels like lying.
There was silence in the tram for a time before one of the male techs broke the silence, “And it’s been a fucking amazing time working with you, Sherlock.”
“This place is… strange. They don’t seem to operate under the same ideas of hospitality here.” John shrugged and took a seat next to him on the bed. “Well, I can run downstairs and see if I can find someone but you’re uh, you’re welcome to stay here if we can’t get you into your room. You’re not missing out on any medications are you? Anything you needed that you can’t make do without until tomorrow?”
But realizing that finality of that last thought makes Sherlock go a bit cold with dread. This has to go well. It will go well. It will be… fine. He will meet John5NF and it will be… fine.
(See the end of the chapter for
He opens up a blank word processing document and makes it all the way to listing his current address before he gives up on the resume and goes back to his email. The message from Guest waits, the title bold and white, unopened.
Sherlock thinks on that for some time.
“Yes, John,” he rocks his hips back and forth.
Sherlock could work with “friends.” He could ease his way into John’s life, become indispensable, and then, perhaps, after some time…
“Pardon?”
sat with my in a Peet's Coffee in downtown Denver and pretty much handed me my plot, because she's awesome and great and all other adjectives that mean fabulous.
“That’s a good way to put it,” Gus agrees, as Adam steps up to them and holds a phone in Gus’s face.
He was mildly frustrated that the scapegoat was the course, which Sherlock conceded was rather difficult but was also a thing of beauty. A spike of anger cut through him, then, at the thought that Moriarty would so seamlessly be able to pass off his crime under the veil of a dangerous course.
But it makes Sherlock smile. And in that moment, he realizes that he’s standing on the pavement like a lovestruck teenager,
And thus, he’d put up some modicum of a fight.
Sherlock took a deep breath and then another, feeling the slight, centering brush of John at his side. They were rapidly running out of viable avenues of escape and Sherlock’s mind spun in a desperate attempt to discern any weakness in their situation for which Moran had no accounted.
flashed before the screen in Sherlock’s mind and he filed it away as another important fact about John. John’s hands balled into fists at his sides as he stared forward at the doors of the elevator. Sherlock gazed openly at him, puzzling him out until the bell rang for their floor and wordlessly, they exited.
Sherlock snorts.
“Phillip,” Sherlock turned to John, his expression completely void of any emotion. “He said Holsinger was just provided with the same demo skis that I was.”
He takes a long pull of his tepid tea, checks his weakened resolve and revises his search criteria, ‘Doctor, chat rooms.’
His skis hit the ice with a jump and he was off; the start was quite steep and his speed picked up dramatically as he leaned into the first turn and whipped right. The snow beneath him was rough and bumpy and would give him no breaks even as he skied over a flat expanse of ground.
John broke the silence. “You had a good run this morning?”
, before he opens the response from John5NF.
“Good,” Sherlock said, dragging it closer. “But first…”
Still, Greg’s presence would be good for him. He knew that often times he got bored and restless when at a venue for too long and just knowing that his ex-coach would be watching him would be enough to have him consider his behavior before acting in his usual, brash manner.
“It makes all of the difference Sherlock, all of the difference. If you get implicated in this somehow, if you cock this up, your career is over. Even if you’re to retire, every single event you’ve ever medalled in will be scrutinized. And you
“Yes,” John said in a rush, voice equally as tinged with desperation.
He spun around quickly, levelling the intruder with a glare that was meant to put him off. “Of course, but not whilst I’m being subjected to two hours of absolutely enthralling Russian history. I was just
Sherlock sank his hands down into the hot water, sighing at the contact on his dry skin.
The murmurs from the other teams cut through the tension, and after a moment everyone was going back to what they were doing, the scene having played out. Sherlock sniffed again and set his gaze back out the window, onto the snow. “I can take care of myself,” Sherlock growled quietly.
“Since when do you care what time it is? And seriously, if you open that mouth again-”
. A warm weight had settled in his stomach and he reached across the table to where John’s hand was resting palm down and tapped it twice. “Precisely.”
Sherlock smiled at John’s unravelling, his chest expanding with the knowledge that John
The look that Molly gives him proves she’s not buying it. “Sherlock Holmes, how long have I known you?” She doesn’t pause to give him time to respond. “I know when you’re not… you. When you’re… hiding something.”
John laughs, taken aback by surprise. “That was all over the papers, even internationally. And you caught him. That’s brilliant!”
There are few details that are being released to the press; as it stands, security has been increased dramatically in the wake of these events, both at Olympic Village and at Rosa Khutor.
“Lunch. After that. And the case, thought that you might be… that we might be friendly but-”
They pack their clothes in silence, Sherlock not even needing to be prodded to do so.
There was a solid thump and then another and Moran was pulling away, moving toward the door on lumbering legs. With one more thump Greg stumbled through the doorway sideways, clutching his shoulder and hurriedly taking in the scene.
“John,” Sherlock says, squeezing his eyes shut tight. “I… love you.”
Sherlock wants to say, he does, but he
Their eyes met, John’s lips moving in a whispered, “Sherlock, oh.” When he straightened and stood, it was with a harsh grimace.
Sherlock did, with a few interjections by John here and there. Finally, Sherlock pulled out his wallet and separated the cards to allow Lestrade a glimpse of the waxy substance. “I don’t hold out much hope that there’s lab facilities anywhere near the Village that I could get to.”
And seconds later–Guest must be sitting at his own computer, in his own home, right here in London at this very moment–John received an email in return.
is John making him happy. Why is the simple act of chatting to another person bringing him such immense… contentment? Why is John confiding in him? Is John as deficient as he is? What is it about John that makes him so accessible? What is it about John that makes Sherlock
“There’s nothing here, for you. There is nothing in me, about me, my life… for you.” There’s a waver in Sherlock’s voice, evidence of the fact that Sherlock is struggling with his words, how to accurately place how he feels.
Sherlock takes his time there as well, producing his pocket magnifier to get a better idea of the head wound. He gets a slap to the arm when he tries to insert his index finger into the wound (even though he knows better) and spends a bit examining the hips and pelvis. He surreptitiously sneaks a few photos before he pockets his mobile and takes a small step back.
“Anyone I’d like?” Lestrade makes an attempt at lecherous, but the joking tone bleeds straight through.
Upon returning to his room, Sherlock tossed himself onto his bed, not bothering to turn on the light in the quickly darkening space; they’d lingered at the restaurant until the sun had begun to slip away. He felt positively alight, good deep down to his marrow, and he wanted to savor the sensation for as long as possible.
Molly continued smiling down at him as he tugged them on his hands and pulled then back off. She smiled and smiled until he looked up and made direct eye contact with her. The words, when they came, were distinct and left no room for interpretation; she even folded her arms over her chest for effect. “You like him.”
room to change into clothes suitable,” John bent and brought his lips to Sherlock’s ear, “to grinding against handsome men in dark corners.”
Sherlock generally drew his competitive edge from a personal obligation to win; the notion of skiing for his country wasn’t something that he often thought about. Other than wearing the accoutrements of team Great Britain, he didn’t feel particularly tethered to his nation. He didn’t ski to represent Great Britain; there was no swell of nationalistic pride that he felt when he performed an exceptional run at an event.
Sherlock glances over, shaking his head, aloof. “Hirscher is slated to win, and I believe he will. But, he certainly hasn’t been training as hard this season and missed a qualifier in November, but he is the favorite to win this giant slalom, though I’m not sure
A moment later and Sherlock is at his laptop, rushing to open his email client.
It was a long few hours taking insufferable calls from his parents and Mycroft, another round of photographs for his sponsors, and an official portrait for the British ski team. Eventually, he was allowed to make his way back to his room, exhausted and wrung out.
John chuckles and grabs a pen, jots down his email address and hands it back. “I look forward to going over all of the materials. And thank you for speaking with me about this it’s…yeah, I could do with… yeah.”
?” The dog, of course, says nothing back and so Sherlock slumps, lolls his head over the back of the sofa and releases a hearty sigh, feels as though he can’t expel all of the the air pressing against his lungs. “And then what I said…”
“Oh jesus,” comes Sherlock’s tortured expletive and John smiles; he’s so completely, full-to-the-brim with happiness, knowing that he’s making Sherlock feel good. Knowing that he’s making Sherlock feel as overcome with pleasure as Sherlock had managed with him.
“Says the man who somehow found the time to hang around at most of my training sessions with him. Tell me, was that you looking out for me or was it something else entirely?” Sherlock baited, grinning even as he did, imaging Mycroft simmering wherever he was.
Sherlock followed, a few paces behind. “Any time.”
“But you want him to be
“Right then, what’s the crisis?” Lestrade was still smiling, oblivious to the dire nature of the situation.
When he rights himself, Sherlock smiles at John who feels as though his face might well split in two from the force of his grin. “So,” John says, drawing out the ‘o’ in rather dramatic fashion. A comfortable buffer of silence settles around them, the din of the other diners low enough that their position feels intimate. “That’s it, then? Years of sitting on all of this and…”
The Olympics might be over for another four years, but what they’d found together in Sochi sustains them through, and will for many Games to come; Sherlock hates the sentimentality of it all, but John is right. It’s nice to have something to assist them in celebrating their love, ever four years.
Both John and Greg nodded.
“Right,” John says, and wriggles down, his jeans catching on the duvet. “Right,” he murmurs directly into the cleft of Sherlock’s arse. He takes his time, thumbs dipping in, pressing against, working Sherlock patiently until he bends in and applies his mouth. His tongue.
So when Sherlock had announced the case—absolutely no room for argument, they were going—John had grabbed his laptop, booking them coach tickets and a rental car. Sherlock had insisted he’d find lodging for them, as he was by far the pickier of the two, and didn’t “trust” John’s taste level to make an adequate selection.
“That’s good to hear; we don’t need the media interfering with your recovery.”
“It wouldn’t be boring if you weren’t so appallingly
There, he sends that, not feeling good about it, save for the fact that at least it’s the truth.
“Your taste in flora leaves
There’s a beat of pregnant silence before Sherlock speaks. “Brilliant,” he says suddenly and with no small amount of surprised wonder, his entire body language shifting from bashful and hopeful to instantly energized. He lights up the way he does when presented with a ten of a case.  “Brilliant, it’s going to be.”
about my training, hm? Mother and father were content to stand back and let me achieve at my own pace while you… you were always the one
If he’d only told John about Guest sooner. Hindsight after all is quite clear, and harping on decisions on the past will do him no good, but he can’t help but think…
He taps a fingernail against the side of his mobile, willing a reply to come. He doesn’t want the reply so that he’ll have an answer for Lestrade. No; he wants the answer for an entirely different reason, he realizes. He just wants to chat with John5NF, to interact, to
“Just be
: Your only condition.
It’s an oddly specific question and oddly formal. John’s eyebrow perks as he reads it, but still, he does the math in his head, and aside from extenuating circumstances, comes up with a ballpark answer. He doesn’t give it, however, feeling something vaguely off about the question.
Lestrade huffed a laugh as he took a small bit of the wax between his fingers. “Even if they did, they’re not going to let you faff about in there. Probably need a Russian passport to get into any facility like that in this country way things are at present.”
: You’re so intuitive that you must know me.
Sherlock giggled, giddy; he was glad that no one was around to hear the sound he’d made.
“That’s good. Me too,” John says quietly. He reaches across and holds Sherlock’s hand in his until it becomes impossible to finish their meal without separating.
Sherlock tore himself dramatically away and went into the bedroom to get dressed, checking his phone as he pulled on a pair of spandex pants. Greg had texted several times.
“It was John Watson,” he mutters, angling his gaze down at his pet. The dog ruffs and then manages to get himself up onto the sofa, plopping his head into Sherlock’s lap. “I know. I should have known. How did I miss it?
John goggles at William, feeling he’s in the middle of some scripted episode that he’s not had time to memorize, and then glances down at his watch. There are indeed fifteen minutes for him to make it to Bart’s. He’d lost track of time, being picked apart by a stranger on a park bench. “Right, well, yeah, thanks.”
John blinks at the scream, breaks into a grin and then shakes his head as he rereads the message.
“I,” he says, a bit breathless. “I don’t know when it happened but, I’ve had that, too, for a while. Thinking of you,” John clarifies. “Not a while, ehm, since before, you know.”
“Come now, Molly,” Sherlock says, remembering for a flash of a second who he is supposed to meet later on, a fresh set of nervous shivers rocking his stomach. “There’s you.”
“John!” The voice is familiar, but he can’t really place it. For a moment he contemplates pretending he didn’t hear who called him and continuing on. John’s a common enough name, but something makes him pause, his eyes narrowing.
It takes a moment--the
“Can try,” John says on an inhale and walks his fingers across the duvet flicks at the nipple he can reach. Sherlock’s hand stutters and then resumes.
“Lestrade-“
But that too seems wrong. He doesn’t want to hurt John, and what a novel sensation
At that moment, John rounds the corner out of the office, head bent towards a file in hand. When he looks up, his face is unreadable. There was something like surprise in his gaze right before he masked it with stoicism. He twists his lips into a frown and manages a bland, “Oh.”
“Oh god, tell me that you didn’t have relations with someone in the IOC!” Sherlock shouted, rising and stalking towards Greg. “Why is it such an impossible notion that you keep it in your pants?!”
“Speedy’s has a bathroom, or, as I said, you can come in and close the curtain and use our toilet. S’not anything I haven’t seen.” Between the military and his doctoring, he’s seen enough penises for a lifetime—vaginas, too, come to think of it. Besides, he’s not a prude, and he figured that this would come up eventually, what with there being two people and just one bathroom.
John was quiet when he responded. “Of course. Yes. Enough for a lifetime.” He blinked, his eyes trailing over Sherlock’s form and across the room; for a moment he was lost in thought. “Far too much.”
“Because now would be good,” and Sherlock’s back to poking fun, jostling them about until they’re side by side on the bed, shirtless, shoeless, nervous and giggly and eager.
Jutting his chin out, John nodded once crisply and stood with military rigidity., “Those terms okay by you?”
And there’s an email waiting for him. John feels almost as though he’s divined it through sheer will, though he knows he hasn’t. Still, the giddy little thrill that races through him feels no less justified than it had the first time he’d felt this way.
John feels like he’s been punched straight in the gut; he’s so stunned that he can’t even morph his face to feel as outraged as he is. Instead he stands there stock still and watches as Sherlock leaves, punching his way through the swinging doors.
“What makes you think I want to be rid of you?” Sherlock placed a wet, open mouthed kiss in the hollow of his throat.
They settled down in the hot water, John behind Sherlock, who relaxed in the vee of his thighs. “Is this alright?”
“Adequate.”
John drags the tip of his nose back and forth against Sherlock’s spine. “We’ll be alright,” he whispers.
A moment later he stumbled back and up, took a staggered breath and kicked Moran in the groin. Lestrade stood, chest heaving, gathering his wits about himself. Hair a mess, flush high in his cheeks, he glanced quickly all over the room.
Moriarty considered, levering his head back and forth. “Oh not mad, no. No, just opportunistic, but then aren’t we all. It was a happy accident when my people stumbled on this new compound! Couldn’t get it sanctioned but then… I’m am ever resourceful, don’t you think?”
“I’m right,” John said triumphantly. “Aren’t I?”
Sherlock sniffed primly, glancing over to Greg and then back to John. “Of course.”
“Get one of everything again?” John asks, dropping a kiss onto Sherlock’s cheek and sliding into the chair across from him. His cheeks are pink and he smells of winter.
The realization sends a sharp pain racing across his chest. It’s not the first he’s thought that when going to bathe, but it still hurts, still stings, just like the first time.
Sherlock finally looks up, exasperated. “For you, John.”
There are a dozen subheadings and John assesses the website overall. It seems well-laid-out and as though it gets a decent amount of traffic. Convinced, he clicks on a link that states he can create a profile and begin “adding to the discussion.” He spends some time working on that, deciding what information to give; he may have been abroad getting shot at for the past few years, but he does know that there’s been an uptick in identity theft.
“Are your,” John doesn’t know why he feels the need to speak. He’s never felt the need to fill space with words before, “sheets clean?”
Sherlock chuckles silently and writes another line of text. “Who you were with? You didn’t realize who you were with?”
Sherlock’s gaze lifts to his, watery and unsure. “I... “ he sighs, draws his hands down over his face. “I am feeling… everything. I didn’t want to wake you, but it feels as though,” he sighs again, “My chest is going to burst open.”
They ended up at the same bar they had gone to the first day they were in Sochi. Upon Sherlock’s arrival, the entire place turned almost as one and cheered him. He had to make a shooing gesture while giving an annoyed glare at the crowd to get them to settle down. Inside however, his ego thrilled at the welcome.
Their feet crunch over the fine gravel and they wander side-by-side into the heart of town, a silence borne of a decade of friendship settling comfortably between them. John steals a glance, noting the way the tendrils of sunset that have found their way between low clouds cause Sherlock’s hair to light almost neon purple; it’s a poetic thought, and John rebukes himself for it momentarily, before giving in and glancing over again.
“How, John? We have no tangible proof! I can’t bring an accusation of this magnitude forward
Though it was cool outside, it was humid and sticky in the bar, the main room populated with a mob of people donning the Union Jack. It took him a moment for his eyes to adjust in the low lighting and he began making out the faces of the people around him. There were an awful lot of people with their arms around one another, tilting their faces into others’ too closely; Sherlock frowned at the spectacle and the stale tang of beer that hung in the air.
Sherlock didn’t turn back towards his group, but he did allow his face to relax and his eyes to slip closed as the weight of the praise seeped in. Eventually he tipped so that his left temple rested against the cool glass of the cabin and he didn’t open his eyes until the tram reached the terminal destination.
John mimics his body language and crosses his arms back over his chest, the elbows of his white coat chafing his skin; he realizes--too late--how standoffish he looks. “Try me.”
today? This new technician bloke?”
John turns and is confronted with a portly, grinning, ever-chipper Mike Stamford. John hasn’t seen Mike in going on eight years, now. He’s not changed much from the man with whom John had come up through medical school; he’s still heavyset and seems to still be brazenly optimistic, if the light in his eyes and the dimples that dot his cheeks are any indication.
John asks, and sends it off. He finds himself wondering about Guest, what the person looks like, if it’s a male or a female, where they’re located in London. He comes up with a few dozen amalgamations about what this person
The media tent is an absolute circus when they arrive, and Sherlock rolls his eyes, annoyed that this is part of his commentator gig. John had reminded him what these events were like in person, and not to get snappish, but he couldn't help but get snappish when he was almost immediately approached by a microphone-wielding reporter.
be like while he’s waiting for a response.
John’s head tips back, throat bared and he groans, closed-lipped. “Sher-”
The race official came over and told him that they were prepared for him to enter the area beside the gate; Sherlock hadn’t even noticed when the area had begun to empty out, hadn’t even registered the countdown beeps. He was fifth from the starting line and he took a seat on one of the long, heated benches, staring down at his skis.
“Yeah, alright,” he returned, equally as soft, slipping his hands back out from his pockets to place them gently over Sherlock’s pectorals. “I’ll be there.”
John was alive.
And through it all, through the proposal and marriage, through the Rosie’s birth, through all of the life-altering events both good and bad, he’d loved Sherlock Holmes. And it’s all mirrored back at him in Sherlock’s eyes, the way he holds himself, the way he speaks.
John rolls his eyes, but so does with a smile; it is true, after all. “Nice to meet you.” John would extend a hand but Molly’s are occupied. “I hear that since the Hillingdon incident you’ve been pretty busy here.”
If this had happened years ago, back before they’d become so completely entwined, John might have been fine with the idea that they race towards mutual orgasm, just to know. But there’s a need he has to allow Sherlock to understand and experience how deeply John cares for him.
“Right,” John murmured, already headed in the direction of his room, fingers still curled tightly into his palm. “Well, I suppose… I, ehm, g’night.”
John shakes his head, side to side, eyes scrunching closed before he peeks one open. “Whu—what? Shu—”
Perhaps it’s better that John5NF doesn’t know the exact extent of his work; it might scare him off.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to that. He turns it over in his head for quite some time, deliberately avoiding how John5NF’s offer makes him feel. That someone cares, that someones wants to hear what he has to say is, well, extraordinary.
Sherlock smiled sweetly down at Lestrade. “Just… sugar coat it. We can’t be having her in hysterics because we’ve asked her to compromise her obviously iron-clad morality.”
Suddenly self-conscious, John blushes, “What?”
On rubbery limbs they managed to unruck the last of the bedclothes and slip beneath them, both avoiding the rather sizeable wet spot. They each pressed themselves into a pillow, facing one another, just staring, revelling, basking in the ensuing rush of endorphins.
John’s gaze flicks from Sherlock’s pocket—dangerously close to looking at his arse there, Watson!—to his face. “What things?”
be the sort of bloke that just carries around one-hundred quid notes with him.
Sherlock always craved it, needed it, the rush, the danger, the adrenaline. To think that he hadn’t exuded
“John!” she calls, brightly from their bedroom. “Those damn throw pillows you ordered came. Throw pillows, seriously, can’t believe you’re decorating the living room, when—John!” she interrupts herself; he can hear her marching to the door. “Are you bathing in there?”
And so Sherlock does, with John by his side. He notes John’s height and the length of his stride, how he swings his arms alongside him as he walks. John is confident and deft, stepping around passersby with ease. John is compact and strong, and Sherlock surreptitiously appreciates the expediency of John’s gait.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he squeezed John’s arms lightly. “With a bathtub, if it will make you say yes.”
The thought halts his entire body; it’s as though the blood stops pumping, cells remain inert, no breath, no enzymatic reaction.
Sherlock’s eyes flit up, fix on John’s face, his mouth and eyes, as he primes his mind and
“Oh yeah?” John pulled back to his full height and looked him up. “And how do you know that?”
John purses his lips in surprise and clicks yes without a second thought, a gentle thrill raising his body to full awareness.
“Yeah, when are you taking off? That is, after your race I assume you’ll have to stick around for a little while.”
He produced a bundle: tweezers, a few nail files, a small paring knife and various wires and random small rods, truly an eclectic collection. Sherlock was dubious, and the twist of his lips said so.
“I don’t mean to downplay the importance of our uncovering evidence on him, but we’ve all night for that,” Sherlock breathed, bringing a hand up, his thumb stroking against the hair at John’s nape.
“I know it’s going to be fine,” he says, devoid of emotion, and she smiles.
Sherlock takes the moment while John is typing his response to save John’s number in his phone. He takes great relish in pressing the ‘Save’ button when he’s through inputting John Watson’s name.
This was much more than he’d ever expected it to be. Internally, Sherlock chastised himself yet again for allowing his sentiment to overrule his brain--he didn’t deserve any of the inevitable fallout that would come of this situation. Now, however, was not the time to be mulling over such things. “Greg,” Sherlock implored without taking his eyes off of John’s face, “call for an ambulance, would you? Do let them know that there’s an attempted murderer lying on our floor about to resurface from being knocked out and that some sort of police presence would be advisable.”
And Sherlock gets an idea.
Moran just grinned predatorily down at John. “Well, we haven’t been caught yet. Jim is very good, very… thorough. And I’m good at, well--you already know what I’m good at.”
would see in him. John is
run through him. John Watson isn’t altogether unattractive; he’s a bit plain, if Sherlock had to put a word to it, but he has very intense, expressive eyes, and carries himself very well, carries himself confidently and assuredly. His hair is a rather nice shade, and if it wasn’t for the frankly hideous jumpers that he seems to be so fond of wearing, Sherlock might even have the benefit of being able to appraise what seems to be his very fit body.
After another moment weighing his options, he dialed Greg’s number. He didn’t bother with pleasantries, just answered Lestrade’s greeting with, “I need you to keep an eye on Moriarty.”
Sherlock swallowed and looked at John--his face so close--from beneath his lashes. “You feel…”
“Right, then,” John says and opens the drain. “Right.”
“Shacking up,” Moriarty ridiculed, twirling in the center of the room. “Being so obvious about it all, really, Sherlock. In a place where this sort of thing,” he whistled and darted his finger between the two of them, “is really,
It feels so strange, to share this between them now. A thread of something they haven’t named, but something so obvious to the both of them, that’s it’s becoming too much to leave unspoken and unexplored.
His stomach plummeted immediately as he caught sight of John, tied at the feet and hands but also around the middle in a stationary chair. His chin rested against his chest, a small line of blood running from his temple to his jaw had already begun to dry and crust. That meant that he’d been out for awhile at least, and that knowledge nearly undid Sherlock’s fragile composure.
, laughs out loud at the buoyancy he’s feeling and then send the email to Guest.
As he sought out an official to find out what the commotion was about, John rounded the corner, bounding over to him. He was pink in the face and very obviously out of breath. “Fuck,” he began and sucked in a breath. “Fuck, Sherlock, Holsinger lost control on the Russian Trampoline. He’s out; broke his arm and tore his right ACL.”
was able to communicate his pride and happiness; Sherlock felt something delicate burst open inside of him and as a result, he gripped Lestrade harder to his chest.
John smirks at having effectively angered Sherlock. “No?” he asks, innocently. “What is it, then?”
“Oh, yes, that’ll… yeah, alright.” His hand goes to the back of his neck. “Suppose I am, erm, a bit tired.”
Sherlock looks ridiculous, and charming, and John looks away only after Sherlock catches him watching.
Sherlock manages to pull himself off of the door (he hears Mrs. Hudson coming and doesn’t want to explain why he’s tearing himself to pieces in the entryway) and dashes up the steps to the flat. Redbeard greets him expectantly, tail wagging, as though to ask how it all went, and he gives the dog a withering look and collapses onto the sofa.
It’s a short walk during which they remain silent, John just a half a pace behind Sherlock. While they walk, Sherlock deduces, stupid, innocuous things. John’s preference for sturdy, well-made clothing in boring colors, the gambling problem he had in his late–no! early!–twenties, the fact that he sleeps on his back most nights and that he-
John takes his time, pressing against Sherlock’s rim, stretching him before slipping the tip of his thumb inside. Sherlock feels as though every nerve ending is alive, rooted to the intentions of John’s hands, his mind pinpoint-focused on the sensations being drawn from his body. John’s tongue touches the very center of him, wetly pressing, John’s fingers firmly holding Sherlock open.
Warming.
Sherlock sends before he even has time to think about what he’s written. There’s an instant pang of regret because, well, it’s generally difficult to convey tone via text and Sherlock’s statement certainly reads as accusatory.
: Twenty days.
A crack of a laugh escapes John as he grabs the liquid soap and pours it in. “That was terrible.”
Erin my dear, thanks a bunch, a ton, a whole heck of a lot for, you know, this entire chapter, basically.
Sherlock hadn’t needed coaching in some years but the man continued to attend his races; it was as much for genuine moral support as it was an opportunity to drum up new business for himself. Sherlock’s parents had found Greg when they had been away on holiday in Norway. The coach too had been on holiday and it had been a well-timed comment regarding the condition of the powder by Greg to Sherlock’s father that outed him as a skiing coach. What was more was that he too resided in London, a fact that made his training the Holmeses’ son all the more appealing. It was a mutually beneficial match; Sherlock could practice on the slopes of the Alps when the opportunity presented and he’d be coached by Gregory Lestrade at home, at an indoor complex.
And Sherlock is slanting his mouth over John’s, moving gently and deliberately, two fingers just pressing into John’s law, guiding him. It’s something so slow that John feels as though they might be moving backwards through time, such a deliberate and decadent meeting of mouths. The shadowy silence of the hallway only serves to heightness the sweet rawness of it all.
means? It means
“Ladies and gentleman, the silver medallist, Daniel Abrecht of Switzerland!” Again, the crowd cheered as Abrecht reacted much the same as Miller had, holding his medal in front of his face and jokingly pretending to take a bite out of it.
. They pause together at the corner of Baker Street, a child in a pram reaching out to try and pet Redbeard’s head and Redbeard dutifully stepping closer.
Sherlock sipped a quick inhale and then another. “It was with Greg and Molly and… what if I were? Socializing?” Even to himself his voice sounded unsure, nearly bashful.
Sherlock turns over onto his left side and shoves a fist beneath his pillow. Anticipation once more wars with trepidation as he forces his eyes closed, a million different scenarios flitting through the empty halls of his mind palace before he wills himself to just stop thinking.
That’s just how it was. John’s mind couldn’t parse the distance.
“Oi mate, before you crack a rib!” he laughed and pulled back out of the hug to slap gently at Sherlock’s face in his glee.
He hadn’t seen James Moriarty in over two years. The last time the two had crossed paths, Moriarty had managed to medal in the World Cup finals in Austria. Though it had only been bronze, the media had taken to comparing Moriarty’s third place podium finish with Sherlock’s two-tenths of a second fourth place. It was the first wave of articles that suggested that Sherlock was washed up, that Moriarty - only two years his junior - was just reaching his peak in the sport.
John breaks the stasis, his eyes flicking away, as he takes a quick sip of air. He motions towards the back of the restaurant, towards where Angelo had retreated, with a jerk of his chin. “So. How did you solve that one?”
“And I assume that you know my limits,” John continues. It’s been a year; they’ve been through a lot, and many, many lines have been drawn. But John isn’t sure that this particular point has been driven home. “I would say that, well, not many flatmates would be willing to put up with body parts in the fridge, yeah? So clean up after yourself.”
“Alright,” John said, annoyed. “You gave me twenty minutes, it was the best I could do. Couldn’t just run down to that corner shop and pick up a set, you berk.”
“Well,” she finally sighs, a little dreamily. “Now that that’s squared away, shall we?”
his mind supplies and he gives a harsh chuckle.
Some of his hesitance at being out in the world flakes away and he finds by the time he’s finished his meal and drained his glass, he feels more even-keeled than he has in a very long while. He feels almost human again.
“Maybe,” John says, his voice going a little gravely and odd, something sifting in there, and he has to clear his throat. “Might be, probably, yeah, actually. Probably I am, yeah, but that doesn’t matter right now.”
Shorter, stocky, balding and not very dapper, but with a sharp wit and an easy smile. Sherlock’s mouth twists; this amalgamation of John isn’t attractive. If his John5NF, the
Sherlock felt heavy and full with arousal, buoyed on by John’s little gasps and moans. His fingers made their way across John’s chest, trailing through the sparse hair and lingering to run his teeth over the ridges of John’s collarbones. Only then did Sherlock move, dropping his mouth to the right nipple and suckling gently. His teeth scraped against the pebbled flesh and from the sound John made, Sherlock could imagine John flinging a forearm over his eyes, an attempt to hold the pleasure at bay.
There, he’d be able to see Moriarty’s every move on the course.
real critiques for you at the moment.” Lestrade chuckled and they climbed into the tram that would take them to the Village. “I don’t know - you almost look like you’re having
When he turns, John is behind him. “Wait, wait, I… I’m.” John frowns, rolls his eyes and blows out a breath. “I’m sorry. I think we… no, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.”
“Yes, I was out early.” He didn’t bother informing her that he had in fact spent the night in another man’s room, in another man’s bed. He didn’t mention that the man wouldn’t stop niggling at his mind, picking at his resolve.
It took a bit of fumbling and maneuvering but John managed to capture Sherlock’s lips and in that instant, began to move. His body slid perfectly over Sherlock’s, slowly at first, his knees pressing into Sherlock’s thighs with each movement, body halting on the upstroke until just the glans was inside.
It comes--once again--very quickly on the heels of his own.
Greg’s lips twisted into a thoughtful purse. “Well, I erm, I mean, I can try it’s just that she and I--”
now, but it was all still too abstract and unformed for Sherlock’s liking.
He roused feeling warm and heavy, and curled onto his side to allow consciousness to gently come into focus. After a yawn he curled onto his other side, stretched out his achy limbs and tosses his arms out to the side.
His lips curl, and he feels himself smiling at the consideration that gives Sherlock’s trepidation away. “I’ll be fine.”
“Oh, John, oh
John pets blindly at the back of Sherlock’s head, twice, before stepping away. “Shower?”
“Brilliant, really.”
He pauses, fanning through the sheaf. After a sigh, he holds them up for Sherlock. “This is just financials from 2008, before we went with the Excel spreadsheets.”
“And,” Sherlock begins, slowly, taking a step in John’s direction. “I can continue to use the tub for…purposes other than bathing?”
Buoyed by that thought, he didn’t put up much of a fight when Molly threaded her arm through Sherlock’s and tugged on him until he followed along beside her.
His head tottered back and forth. “That course is both a dream and a nightmare.”
John is out of bed in a second, naked and rounding the bed to meet him. For a moment, they simply stand in front of one another, before John wraps his hand around Sherlock’s neck and brings him in for a kiss. “That was… good, yeah?”
: Why time sensitive?
It all slots into place for Sherlock; immediately upon entering the flat he falls against the door and groans, dragging his hands down over his face. “Fascinating, handsome, interesting,
John finds that he’s actually excited about the shift in atmosphere now, with Sherlock beside him. They take a right onto Heathborne and before John knows it, they’re pulling up in front of his rather derelict building.
Sherlock runs his teeth over first his bottom lip and then his top, rocks up onto the balls of his feet and with a newfound, rather fake-sounding enthusiasm says, “How about a bath?”
He feels raw and strung out, overstimulated and somehow empty. It’s the come-down after the end of a case, and frankly, he’s shit at handling it. In days of old he would have injected some of his seven percent solution, but he now instead indulges in sickeningly sweet bakery treats. He buys an eclair, a frighteningly large piece of lemon cheesecake, and two dozen assorted cookies, intending to gorge on the lot.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shut the door with a bit more effort than necessary. “Spectacular to see the security here is a high priority; John is on his way.”
John wets his lips, “Would you like that?”
Sherlock stays up very late, talking with John5NF about nothing, really. He asks him medical questions just to test his knowledge, finds out that he likes Bond films and hates chickpeas and Sherlock tells him the history of Redbeard.
Sherlock chews at the nail of his right thumb and sends the email off.
Sherlock wants to shake the rest out of her, wants to positively throttle it out.
“Good,” Sherlock sniffs and sits back, satisfied.
To his increasing dismay, he finds that he hasn’t.
“And I thought all of your, your, what, deductions? I thought they were so brilliant. Really, truly brilliant and then ‘Oh, I’m William,’ and of
John grunted but otherwise said nothing.
John imagines it, chuckling as he does, imagines seven or eight of the amalgamations of Guest chasing down a medical examiner. It’s vaguely amusing each time, but John also finds it rather exciting. It all sounds like something out of an E4 drama. He doesn’t know whether Guest is bragging or is simply giving him a rundown of the events, but either way, John’s entertained.
Sherlock shrugs, rifling through the box before him and then kicking it with one foot, sliding it across the floor to where John is seated. It skitters to a stop just before John’s ankles and he rolls his eyes.
It’s not as though John isn’t nearly one hundred percent certain that his feelings are reciprocated, but it’s been eight years and everything that comes with that. It’s six and a half–give or take a few months–years of John quietly coming to terms with the amount of space Sherlock takes up in his heart. It’s very nearly a decade of stiff-upper-lip British composure, keeping himself so tightly bottled up that he’s at a loss for how to let any little trellis of what he feels peek out into the light of day. Because what would that even look like?
John pushed off the wall and set his hands in his pockets, gazing down at the floor. “Sherlock-”
John sucks in a loud breath, sniffles involuntarily. “I didn’t think I’d ever have you either.”
There are dozens and dozens of other questions that John could ask, but he sends those off first and waits.
“I’m sorry, I’m booking us a luxury suite and there are conditions?” Sherlock jested, hands flying up in mock-exasperation.
,” John smeared into his skin before ripping himself away and smacking a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips. “Seriously, though,” he took a breath, “am I allowed to say I’m proud of you? Have we known one another long enough? Is that… is that weird?”
“Ah, you’re going to go insane,” Sherlock could hear John’s smile in his voice.
He made a stop in the cafeteria and did a very thorough job of carbo-loading, so much so that he took a photograph of his food and sent it to Greg. He knew it would needle at him that Sherlock was finally preparing for a race properly and didn’t have to be forced into it by a well-meaning but particularly annoying coach.
All of my thanks to Erin and Allison for being all "Oh hey, you writing that? You writing it? Oh hey, how's Uphill coming?" and then still reading it over for me, you know, months later.
wanted to be faster but, well, I had to be compensated somehow. I’d
“In my hand, in my mouth,” John panted and inched his knees just a bit further apart; he tipped forward, their brows coming gently together once more. “Okay, god… Sherlock.”
“Yes,” he returned, inching up to the gate. “I am
time. The perforation of the organs suggests a shoddy job by the surgeon, mind. If you felt like
Sherlock pressed his teeth together so hard that his vision went nearly white with the force of it. He knew it, knew it from the outset, that getting involved with John was dangerous. Now their dalliance had put John in direct line of that danger, something that gnashed in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach; if John was harmed due to Sherlock’s weakness, he’d never forgive himself.
Sherlock begins and then groans, dips his head in momentary surrender. He deletes it all.
Sherlock glances over, silently assessing him from top to bottom. His eyes flit momentarily back to the Pyrex dish he’s pouring a beaker of something into, and then they’re back on John. “If you’re the one wanting to use it, doesn’t it stand to reason that you’re the one to clean it?”
“Angelo never disappoints,” Sherlock affirms and takes a sip from his rapidly emptying glass. He feels the buzz of the wine, the heat of it filling his limbs, and he finds himself wondering what qualifies a “dinner out” as a “date.” Because Sherlock thinks that this may be veering very close to date territory.
Sherlock looks at the cover, and does his best not to laugh, sucking his lips in until his mouth is a tight line. “Vanity.” He shrugs, and whenhe meets John’s gaze he breaks, dissolving into deep rumbles of laughter.
John smiled and then tilted his gaze in Sherlock’s direction. “Hmmm, coming off two broken ribs in November and a weak right knee? Fairly certain I could take you.” John winked and closed his eyes, set his seat back into a reclining position and didn’t say anything more. Sherlock was surprised at John’s ability to volley a challenge and then sit back while it took its effect.
Padding out into the kitchen, he’s glad that Sherlock is engaged at his laptop; he’s not sure that Sherlock would allow him to live this down. Foregoing his evening cup of tea, he makes to mount the steps and avoid the possibility of Sherlock noticing.
This is the human, the only one, that he trusts implicitly. This is the best, truest, most remarkable man he’s ever met. This is the person who he knew from the very start would be remarkable. This is the person that he marked as a best friend. This is his person, John realises hazily.
, Sherlock thinks.
There was an a long moment that felt like an eon as John sized him up; everything went startlingly quiet, his inner monologue seeming calamitous in juxtaposition.
“Because he’s Sherlock Holmes,” Greg interjected, too happy.
Sherlock didn’t want to push John away, give him a reason to pull away. He did his best to quickly rectify the damage he’d surely done and reroute the conversation. “Not too worried that you’re headed down that path, clearly and you shouldn’t be, John, but you remind yourself at every turn... now lock picking, that’s a skill that could come in handy and oh, don’t look at me like that I just-”
“You could answer your bloody phone,” Greg said when he’d entered, hands on hips. “The press? They’re going nuts. This insanity--all the injuries, the death!--it doesn’t happen, and the way you took off after the race? It doesn’t look good.”
“Yes, good,” Sherlock says, paying incredibly close attention to his mobile because he’s not entirely sure what to say, now. It’s an odd sensation, a pit-of-the-stomach hollowness that permeates his body with want, the notion of John leaving.
“A man has
Sherlock smiled back, unseen by John. “Yes,” he said and pressed his mouth to John’s brow. “Now, I believe I said
Moran--hulking, stupid Sebastian Moran--was pushing him back into his room and pulling up behind that meaty form behind him was Jim Moriarty. He gave Sherlock the obvious once over as they forced their way into his room and then tsk-tsked. “Oh, honey. You should really dress appropriately when you’re having guests over.”
“Good,” John growls, and he rolls his hips forward, the crown of his cock moving inside. “Good,” he slurs, seating himself in Sherlock’s body.
He’d seen dreams like those of the people before him deflate, and he lost himself for a few minutes in attempting to predict how poorly each of the athletes were likely to do.
“You’re a doctor. In fact, you’re an army doctor.”
When Sherlock wakes--having slept an astonishing five hours--he reaches immediately for his mobile. He makes a show (for no one but himself) of sifting through his email, of checking the comments on his website, just to prove that he
. John has deliberately chosen a meal in which they’ll have to negotiate the plates, agree on what they’re going to order. Isn’t that…interesting.
? What isn’t he seeing about John Watson?
Sherlock’s eyes narrow as he slots all of the information into place in his head, conjuring up five, seven, twenty versions of the man she’s just described. But it’s the last bit that trips him up, that gives him pause. “How could you possibly know he’s gainfully-employed and ex-military?” he asks scathingly.
“Though you’re tan, back from abroad and looking at the city as though you haven’t seen it in some time, interesting.” The man gives John a fake smile and turns his attention back to the screen of his mobile.
“Ah, Bart’s… before heading over. Practiced for three years before going over.” Pressing his napkin to his mouth, John learned forward, arms resting against the table. “You?”
from the body,” John growls and takes a step towards Sherlock.
“Do you know what this coffee reminds me of? The first day I met you,” Sherlock says, and it’s a shade close to wistful.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirms as he sips primly from his own cup of soju, fluttering his eyelashes coquettishly.
Sherlock heard the gasps from the crowd and felt a tremor run through him; there had to be something going on, there simply
Lestrade stared and stared; he blinked and then he stared some more.
“After Borgen, two racers down; you’re going to wait here?”
Sherlock worked him patiently, not giving in to John’s insistent demands for more, instead slowly wringing the pleasure out of him, until his back was slick and gleaming with perspiration and he was keening out in need. Only after he’d managed to reduce the resistance when he’d added a third finger did he crook his hand and allow himself to brush purposefully over John’s prostate.
In the present, Sherlock finds himself arrested by Kenworthy’s open and affable manner, his wide grin causing Sherlock to relax a bit. “The new face of Team USA skiing,” he acknowledged. “Pleasure to meet you.”
“You are quite aware how much of your shit I actually put up with, right?” John asks, though there’s no real anger laced in his voice, just a patient sort of annoyance. Sherlock isn’t nearly as demonic a roommate as some people implied he might be. John doesn’t mind the violin or the odd experiments; he supposes he should be more bothered by the fact that it’s virtually impossible to bring a date home, but he isn’t. John doesn’t spend too much time thinking about that. “It’s a lot.”
“Which is the hobby?” John asked on a laugh. “The skiing or the science?”
They continued on, glancing at the menus posted outside, trying to decipher what the shoddy english translations of the food actually meant. They were bent over and gazing at a menu outside of a rustic looking establishment when Sherlock spoke. “And you, you’re quite good at what you do.”
Sherlock will read John5NF’s response in the morning, perhaps before he makes his way down to Bart’s to try and clear the air with the morgue technician. After all, if John Watson is sticking around--unlike the several technicians before him--it would do Sherlock well to stay on his good side.
He thinks for a time, a new mail window open and worries over what to say. Sentiment, never his strong suit.
“I feel,” John said with a sigh, “as though I was tied to the back of a vehicle and dragged.
“Bloody hell, yes, it was,” John exclaims, laughing.
feeling so.
“Spain?”
Oh, it’s easier, and that’s precisely the problem. This is all becoming more and more personal, more and more like actual interaction. This isn’t something he
Or he could be reading too much into this.
“You’re not coming with me to Barcelona,” Sherlock said even as he spun around in front of John, dancing to the absurd song.
Sherlock’s stomach flipped and he found that suddenly, his hands were quivering just a bit; he was outside of his body, looking back at himself. He shifted his shoulders and schooled his face into a mask of tranquility, or as close to it as he could manage. He was about to have an Olympic gold medal hanging around his neck, a moment his entire life had led up to. Swallowing thickly, he heard, in a calm, leveled female voice, “Ladies and gentleman, the gold medallist, Sherlock Holmes of Great Britain!”
It’s then that a wave of guilt so acute that steals his breath. He’s misled this man, this man that he… that he what?
They’re deciding on paint colors for the main room in C, choosing childproofing devices, furniture without sharp edges, arguing about whether Rosie prefers stewed carrots or blueberry puree.
He picks up a takeaway sandwich from the coffee shop on the corner and has a shower and a shave before he even thinks about opening his email. The task doesn’t seem as pressing as it once did to him, and he weighs that, too. Is Guest beginning to lose his allure? Is he thinking too much on Sherlock? Should he be thinking
asked back, you mean,” John says gently. “And you will be. Judging by the feedback from the network.”
Sherlock had no issue with the final few turns on the course, skiing them clean and picking up even more speed as it came to the fine jump. He flew through the air, nothing but blissful, clean white below him and the crowd in the stands beyond. He barely saw any of it though, as his skis once again made contact with the earth in a jolt.
“Shut up,” Sherlock says a moment later, but he can feel the slick little smile tipping his lips and turns to John to find him wearing a similar expression.
: Then why end this? Wait three weeks, we can meet, and then, if it’s all awful and we find that we’re not the people we thought the other was,
John’s teeth grind; he imagines he’ll be doing much of that in the future if he’s around Sherlock Holmes. “She’s a kind woman, and it’s obvious you’re stringing her along. It’s cruel.”
“Good on you. I could have gotten that done in about five seconds and yet-”
John adjusts his stance, rolls his shoulders. “Do you have special, taxi-divination powers?” he asks, even as he climbs in behind Sherlock. In front of him, Sherlock smirks, unseen.
Another sigh. “Do I want to know?”
As they ate, the conversation flowed easily. Sherlock spoke of his lengthy association with Greg and John explained how he’d come to accept the job as a medic on the ski team. It was over dessert - tiramisu that wasn’t fantastic but wasn’t terrible - that Sherlock leaned back against the arm of the sofa. “Tell me about biathlon.”
And there too, resting on a bench far from the excitement, was John Watson, face mostly obstructed by the hood of a large, army green parka. He was clapping gently, but their eyes met across the distance and John winked at him, then shooting him two thumbs up. Sherlock sighed and then grinned, unsure whether to be upset that John had put himself through what was surely agony to get down here, or to be thrilled.
or Bill or Will because you’re
The water begins to run cool and he hops out, dries off, opens his wardrobe and begins carefully selecting his outfit for the evening. Everything is properly pressed already, hanging in neat rows organized by color,  so it’s quite easy for Sherlock to pluck out a pair of deep navy slacks and a just-barely powder pink shirt. It’s not as aggressive as he generally dresses, but the jacket does add an extra bit of stylish flair.
“Sherlock,” John says as he rummages through Sherlock’s disastrous bedside table drawer. “The mess…”
“Oh the wax and--”
Rather than nose around in Sherlock’s business—very much unlike Sherlock would be concerned with regard to John’s business—he retreats to the kitchen, but even as he busies himself making an evening cuppa, he can’t help wonder what’s in the bag that smells so distinctly flowery. He can’t even fathom what it would contain. Juxtaposing Sherlock with flowers seems insane—but then, Sherlock has been known to bring home strange things.
John turns on his heel and takes in Sherlock, hopping up and back onto the bed, bouncing with the force of his efforts. “Not bad,” he says, patting the mattress next to his hip. “Good lumbar support.”
Sherlock glares from the office to John and back once again and narrows his gaze at John, as though seeing him for the first time and finding something troubling. “You’re not frightened of me.”
John chuckles and folds his hands atop the table. “I’m likely going to order a bit more than lunch would really call for, just as a warning.”
Sherlock purses his lips and holds up the proffered cup and she takes it. “Did you bring cream, too?” He reaches into his pocket with a sly smile and drops two little containers into her upturned palm. “That’s… thanks. The other one, is that for-”
When they leave John’s flat, ten minutes later, Sherlock is busy scheming. He hates that it feels like lying, but there’s nothing for it. Sherlock has to keep John enthralled, and what exactly would be the best way to do that?
“Oh, John. Call me John, just… just John.” He asked for a ginger ale off of the passing beverage cart while Sherlock requested water. “But really, how’d you know?”
Sherlock’s lips twist in indecision and he turns to begin flipping through the charting that John has prepared for tomorrow’s work. “He’s… methodical.”
A feeling prickles the hair on the back of his neck, something that rankles him. Sherlock feels as though he’s missing something, but he can’t quite determine what that something is. A deduction struggles to form completely in the halls of his mind, but it’s not quite fully developed yet.
went to town on this for me and for that I am super duper grateful. And
He blows a harsh breath out through his nose, nods once in confirmation.
Sherlock rerouted his train of thought, forcing himself to review what he knew of the course, how the sun might affect his run, what the weather was like. The noise around him became a distant murmur as he settled into his prerace calm. Moriarty would ski with the second wave of athletes and as such, Sherlock didn’t have to be on high alert. He could focus on this run single-mindedly.
Something to keep John interested, something to ensure John stays by his side. If he can manage to keep John hooked throughout the case, maybe Sherlock has a chance. Maybe Guest, too, has a chance. A chance for a future, a chance to see what John’s eyes are like first thing in the morning-
Sherlock’s mouth loses its rigidity and turns up, just a tick. With a deft hand, he reaches around John and snatches his mobile back. “Fine. For you.”
than he’d ever been before a race. He was allowing himself to forego some of the work for a bit of social indulgence. Was that the key to his success? Had he been thinking about it too much all along?
It was long minutes before they made it to their designated seating area and filtered into their spots. Sherlock pulled out his phone and brought up another article he’d been meaning to read, devling in headfirst as the rest of the audience watched the spectacle that was the Opening Ceremonies. Every now and again he would glance up and catch some of the theatrics; he had to admit they were visually spectacular, but it was not enough to hold his attention.
And for what must be the thousandth time since Sherlock began talking with John5NF, he releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. Overlooking the obvious cliche, Sherlock enters his response.
John feels nervous, but only a bit. He knows that the majority of his day will be spent in the mandatory human resources training (how many times in his life will he be coached on what constitutes sexual harassment, he wonders?) but during the tail end of it, Molly will introduce him to the lab.
Fuck.
This is love.
‘John told me that last bit by the way. When are you getting up here?’
The hospital is like Mike: a reliable old friend.

“I wish things had been different, I wish I’d said something ages ago—”
“So… how did you meet this…” Molly starts in with no prompting or warning.
Lestrade saunters back in with two cups in his hands and plunks one down on the desk before Sherlock; he’d waved Lestrade off earlier but now as the scent wafts up to him, he finds he quite does want coffee. “Thank you.”
“Yoki,” Sherlock says, clasping his hands behind his back. He knows it well, it was one of the recommendations he’d given to John5NF. He wonders if John5NF has tried it yet, wonders if he has tried it if he’s been there recently. Will he and John Watson be seated in the same place that John5NF sat?
I guess, well, nearly ten years. Of romance. Bringing you mince pies and… and doing the laundry. Letting you lullaby Rosie to sleep.”
“You won’t remove me yourself, then… Captain?”
He could just imagine Moriarty right now, boasting about his accomplishments at whatever the trendiest establishment in Sochi was, gloating to anyone who would listen. The thought of it caused him to set his teeth, angrily grinding them together. It was only a matter of time before a reporter cornered him and asked him about Moriarty; it was only a matter of time before he let his tongue slip and told the world what he actually thought of the man.
It’s that moment that the bell chimes and John tears his gaze away from Sherlock’s shocked expression and looks towards the door, but it’s a couple come in to order coffee. And he can’t help it, truly cannot, when his expression falls. It’s nine-fifteen now, and no Guest. God, he feels like an utter fool.
“And I’ve heard from the technician there that they’re looking for someone to come in on board on an interim basis. If you’d be interested, that is.”
Back inside the dog ambles to his water dish and has his fill as Sherlock strips off his clothes, all the while imagining every possible amalgamation of John5NF.
Sherlock coughs out an embarrassed laugh, but maintains eye contact with John after a brief glance away. “Not with—no, not with Janine.”
He fit his goggles over his eyes and checked his poles one last time before aligning his skies over the line. There was a chime, and then two, and on the third, Sherlock shoved off.
“Oh Sherlock,” and she actually claps her hands together in excitement. “When?”
“I think,” Sherlock finally settles on, folding his hands primly in his lap, for fear that his limbs are going to fly clean off his body. “That you and I should… get married.” The last two words come out in a rush, and he swallows deeply afterward, snapping his mouth closed, terrified.
Perhaps it was the drink, or the pressure of being around someone he liked so very much. Maybe he still needed time to adjust to the altitude. The higher part of his brain shouted that theory effectively down, leaving only the weaker notion - that he was entranced, in every sense of the word, by John Watson - lingering in the forefront of his mind and he didn’t want to lose him just yet.
“Greg,” John tried, patiently. “We’re working with limited time here. Are you going to help us or do we need to mobilize on an entirely new plan?”
Their rivalry was decades old, but Sherlock had always treated it as a distant thing, something that was acknowledged in the press and existed, but never really affected him. He would admit to himself--though he wasn’t proud of it--that trading barbs with Moriarty via interviews in print and on television was childish but somehow also thrilling; he didn’t think, however, that their pettiness in the media and on the slopes would translate to
A moment later, John was next to him on the sofa, asking him to budge up and pulling Sherlock’s legs across his own thighs. His brow furrowed though he said nothing and after pausing briefly to crack his knuckles, John brought his hands to Sherlock’s calves, pushed up his track trousers and began to apply pressure.
Sherlock took a short little breath and then another, and sat up; the bathwater was turning cold and his limbs were beginning to ache anew. He needed ibuprofen and more water, and perhaps a nap before he was fit to do anything else. Though he deplored sleeping, he was aware of its very obvious restorative properties and recognized that after a nap he might be better suited to tackle the problem at hand.
“Yeah?” John asked, pressing himself up and over, leaving open-mouthed kisses to cool as he meandered down Sherlock’s torso. “You what?”
“I am sorry,” Sherlock replied, voice just above a whisper, and he bent until his lips rested on John’s brow.
“Ah, I know this brilliant little place on Northumberland Street, Angelo’s-”
Sherlock raises a brow at John and John just shrugs. “Yeah, that sounds...yeah.”
Lestrade made his appearance then, a cup of coffee in hand, head swallowed by the enormous hood of his parka. “Good of you to show up,” Sherlock lashed out, checking the bindings on his skis.
“Electrician in the morning, right, yes.” John reluctantly allows his hands to fall away, allows Sherlock to shift back and then stand up. For a moment, John feels bereft and awkward, wonders if they’re missing something, if there’s something more they should do, another way to acknowledge the heavy, miasma of emotions between the two of them.

Whatever keeps John by his side.
But the thing that brought them together is ending, yet again, and it’s such a raw reality. Sherlock knows that it changes nothing, but it smarts.
The Hospital will go over. All 4 floors of that good old building will fall, slow as a tree falling in the forest. Timber. You can topple anything. It's weird to think the place we're standing on will be a point in the sky, so very soon.
I couldn't find a clinic to hire me.I felt like my time was limited.
I feel the blood running out of my face, and a strict wave of coldness is washing my body. My heart starts to beat so fast that I find myself panting. She is crazy. This woman is absolutely mad and I need to get out of here.
Our ordinary army of people will blow the center of London today, and that view we both see right now will go into the history books.
I smiled, almost laughed, really.
We just totally forgot about Sherlock's whole murder–suicide thing while we watch a first born explosion starting his performance. We see it from the distance; Smoke is climbing up, concrete collapsing down.
Oh, what is freedom, the glorious miracle of death. Don't you know, the greatest masters are the biggest slaves.
Something inside me shrinks when I think of the meaning behind her words, and I take a look behind me.
I have had enough of this. I’m actually a good guy, I have my values. Quickly, I take the woman by the hand, not forgetting to pick up my cane from the wall it was leaning on, and lead her out of the morgue hall. She is protesting, saying, “What do you think you’re doing?” but it doesn’t sound very convincing.
Up on the top of St.Barts with Sherlock behind me, forcing me to jump to my death without even touching me, London is being covered by explosions, those deadly popping bubbles.
The conversation seems too odd and I wonder if somehow he is talking on the phone, maybe he has a speaker in his ear? no, he doesn’t.
You feel so ordinary, under the shadow of your madman. You see the brilliant man do his magic and all you can do is moan and announce: Amazing, fantastic.
I feel like I’ve been slapped on my face, and it takes me a few moments to fully believe that I’m not even looking for a flat.
I’m angry, I’m furious, I’m so unbelievably empty. Well, Ella, guess what, I have something to blog about today. I have a hobby to share. I remember that there’s a computer lab somewhere around, and I find it easily. The large room is full of computers and empty of people. I step in, breath out, but when I look up again, I'm surprised to see a slender man raising from one of the chairs. He is scratching one long pale arm, his blackberry mobile is up in the air.
I turn again, looking at those pale pale pale blue eyes and say, Sherlock, I'll make you a supernova. I've been here from the very beginning. I was so alone, Sherlock, and I owe you so much. Don't worry, I can tell your story. And I remember everything.
To be honest, the only reason this woman - this stranger - likes me is because she thinks I just lost someone too. She was called to identify her sister’s corpse, and now she is shocked and alarmed. I haven't lost anyone today. I cry because of the glorious realisation. One day, your life will come down to nothing, and not even nothing: Oblivion. It is easy to cry when you comprehend that everyone you love will either reject you or die. On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone will drop to zero.
"Well, insomnia alone hasn't really killed anyone yet." Mike smirked.
I sighed heavily and whispered, I'm a zombie, a walking dead.
“How do you feel about the violin?” he asks.
Sherlock is forcing me to jump, but the truth is, the building we’re standing on won’t be here in ten minutes. You take a 98 percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add it to three times that amount of sulphuric acid. Do this in an ice bath. Your flatmate's bath, because why the hell not. Then add glycerine, drop-by-drop, with an eye dropper. You have nitro-glycerine.
