Also, PLEASE stay safe out there! This is a scary, uncertain time. Take care of yourselves and each other. I love you all❤❤❤❤
Steve was on him in a second.  Outside, the rain had begun to taper off, but in here, the storm was still raging.  Steve climbed on top of him, his hair falling over his brow, his eyes dark.  His breath came in short pulls, almost panting, chest rising and falling fast.
And then she was sobbing into the phone. Steve held it to his ear, head in his hand, listening to her grief and fear, thinking if he had been doing his job and paying attention--leading his men instead of day-dreaming away in the distance like some fucking punk kid--he wouldn’t be making this call. No one would have to make this call. And if they had, it would have been
Steve furrowed his brow. “Are you okay?” He touched the little cut in the corner of Tony’s mouth gingerly. “You’re not really hurt, are you?”
“And I don’t know your name,” Tony went on, as if Steve hadn’t spoken. Or grunted, anyway, because he wasn’t sure what he’d just done qualified as
An acrid scent reached Tony’s nose, and in the darkness, a glowing ember rose, flared briefly, then lowered again.
“No,” he said, shaking his head. He ripped his eyes away from the picture--from the family he could never have. “No, Mom. It’s okay.”
Steve still hadn’t spoken to the others.  He’d sent them each a text saying he was okay, but that he still needed time to get his head straight before he saw anyone.  He said he’d talk to them when he could.  He didn’t say where he was.
imagined going down on him--but never the intricacies of it. Never the slight chemical taste of chlorine from the pool water. Never the luxurious feel of the sheets beneath his own body. Never the delicate way Steve ran his hand through Tony's hair. For all his formidable imagination, he still found himself lacking, and he was honestly thrilled by that prospect. Thrilled to find there was even more to being with Steve than he could have ever imagined in a million years.
“I know,” Steve said, and wrapped Tony up in his arms, holding him. “I know how long it’s been. But.”
Steve nodded as nerves began to flutter in his stomach.  This was important, so important, and he didn’t want to mess it up.  “Right,” he said.  “Look, I’ll understand if you say no.  It’ll be okay.  I won’t make it weird for Pepper or the team, I promise.  It’s just--” he stopped, breathing deeply once, then went on.  “I tried not being around you, Tony, and I don’t want to do that anymore.  I hated it.  I
“I do understand that, Stephen.  Sometimes I don’t think you realize I do, but I do.  It’s just hard.  We went through a lot to be together, me and Steve, and not knowing what’s going on with him, it’s...it’s just hard.”
As close as Tony and Steve were now, it was easy to forget that for two years, they had not seen or spoken to each other.  For two years, whatever feelings he’d had toward Steve had been not only hard, but hateful.  Tony had gone to sleep at night wishing he was there, not so he could hold him, but so he could punch him in his perfect teeth.  Some mornings, he’d woken up, that goddamn flip-phone already in his hand, so ready to call him just to tell him how much he hated him, how much Steve had hurt him, how often he wished Steve would make the world a better place, and just fucking
He called him. “Tony? Are you okay? It’s almost noon, and I'm starting to get worried. Or nervous or something. Call me, okay? Please? Sorry if I’m being stupid. I just want to make sure you’re alright.”
A complicated jumble of feelings passed over Tony seeing him sitting there like that.  Guilt for being late, pride for how hard Steve had worked--was working--in his classes, a little leftover humor from the evening out with his friends, and of course an intense, bone-deep,
Steve tried to put his hand up too, but Tony climbed into his lap and wrestled his arm back against his side. Steve let himself be wrestled, his eyes filled with a dark good humor rested on Tony’s the entire time.
Steve shook his head. Ridiculous. Insane. Obadiah Stane was his mission here. Watching the apartment when Stane wasn’t home. When it was empty. Noting the comings and goings--if there were any. Position three. Not position one like he was used to. Not even position two. Position three. Because this was his down time. His time to recover. His time to regroup. Still working, yeah, because even though it was the most boring job he’d ever had, he was still technically
Steve threaded his fingers through Tony’s, moving them restlessly against his palm. “I wish I’d been there when you called me,” he whispered.
“Where’d this come from all of a sudden, huh?” Tony whispered, his lips against Steve’s cheek.  “We were getting along so well.”
“Not angry, exactly,” he said, thinking about Pepper’s elegant face, her eyes darkening, her brows contracting a bit.  “More like...pity.”
Tony squeezed Sarah’s hand again, then picked Morgan up and kissed her. “Thanks, peanut. I’ll be up soon, ‘kay?”
Steve leaned back on the couch, rolling his head against the back of it to eye the bare walls. “Nah. They didn’t have much to begin with. I think the only really valuable thing they have is Bucky's collection of vintage
It didn’t take long to get home, and it took even less time for him to get into the elevator and push the button for the top floor. He thought about stopping in his room and changing, but then thought again. It was his pool. If he wanted to go for a little midnight swim in naught but his skin, that was his business.
Tony pulled up while they stood outside talking.  He’d seen this sort of thing before, Steve in front of a loose group of guys with pamphlets and smiles, and he sauntered over to listen.  He and Steve didn’t know each other very well yet, were still navigating the waters between acquaintances and friends, but he always enjoyed hearing a good, old-fashioned Steve Rogers smack-down.  Especially when it wasn’t aimed at him.
Finally, the music level came down.  The door slid open and Steve stepped inside.  As many times as he’d been in here, he still felt overwhelmed by the sheer complication of machinery and equipment that took up every available surface.  But almost worse was the reek of ideas, the stink of knowledge he would never, could never, understand.  The fact that Tony knew everything in here, the fact that it was he, himself, who gave off that nearly physical aroma was the most overwhelming thing of all.  Away from the lab, that was lessened, and Steve could even trick himself into believing it wasn’t there at all.  But here, in Tony’s place, the place where his true nature was allowed to not only thrive, but run wild, Steve was almost afraid of his mind, afraid of him.
Blindly, Steve dropped more change into the slot and dialed. The phone rang almost eight hundred miles away, and was picked up on the second ring. “Hello?” Groggy. Tired. Ninety-percent asleep.
Tony turned his head on the pillow but could not see his face.  It was lost in shadow.  “What’s with the cloak and dagger?  Is it really that serious?”
. Unless he meant Rhodey and Carol. Or maybe Nat and Bucky? “Well, I mean, it’s kind of a learning-curve for me too,” he said. “The parenting-thing is a little harder when you’re doing it alone.”
“No,” Steve said for the third time. “I can’t just tell them no. I already told them yes.” He stripped the shirt off, and then pulled the white t-shirt he wore underneath it off too. His uniform shirt was lying next to his jacket. He picked it up and yanked it over his head.
“Well, of course he’d say that, honey,” Nat said.  “Especially if he fucked something up and needed to cover it up.”
Tony pulled him closer, buried his face in Steve’s neck. “Then tell me you love me. Tell me we’re going to be together.”
Steve raised one finger and began pushing buttons.  “You?  Speechless?  I’m just calling a press conference.  Don’t mind me.”
Her hand was small, but hard and fast.  It connected with his cheek with a flat clap.  His head rocked to the side.
“Here here,” Bruce said, and Steve and Tony both subsided into moody silence, listening, but not contributing, while the rest of them calmly hashed it out between them.
He wanted to reach out to him, wanted to touch him and reassure him, but that wasn’t his place anymore. Steve didn’t owe him anything. He belonged to someone else now.
Steve sighed, and for the first time in his life, he felt a sliver of sharp, clean hate slip into his heart. He never would have believed it. Never would have believed it possible. But there it was. Hatred. Hatred for one Howard Stark.
. The way he’d looked at Steve himself. He felt his spine stiffen. “Fine, sir,” he said. “What can I do for you?”
Thor squeezed his shoulder and stood up.  Steve joined him.  As he did, his fingers brushed the wooden handle of Stormbreaker.  A rush of electricity seemed to shiver up his arm.  It felt like raw power.  And oh, so dangerously right.
But Tony kept quiet.  Steve didn’t look at him, but he could feel his eyes on him, feel him listening, and his proximity made it easier to talk.
Tony ran his hands over Steve’s back and up through his hair. “Did somebody take something from you, baby?” he asked gently. “Something you didn’t want to give?”
So, he ran some laps then took a long shower, letting the water run until it turned cold.  He stood under the spray for a few minutes after that.  He stood there until he began to tremble, not just from the cold, but from the fear, the panic locking his lungs.  It was penance.  It was retribution.  It was necessary.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony’s while he brought Tony’s hand to his mouth and kissed each knuckle gently over the bandage. He turned it over and kissed the palm for good measure.
Steve’s pride was so important to him, both as a hero and as a man, and Tony had no desire to tread on it if he could help it.  But watching him navigate the unfamiliar terrain of this new challenge had him walking on eggshells again.
“Um.  It wasn’t just him.  It was--oh god, Tony, that feels--Doctor Baxter.  He was in on it--don’t stop--He was in on it, too.”
Howard sighed and moved his feet in the water, the shape of them like pale starfish. “I came to see how you are,” he said quietly. “I heard you and Pepper were splitting up. I’m sorry.”
Tony couldn’t sit anymore.  He leapt to his feet and turned his back.  Every word they said was like a branding iron in his mind.  He knew those words, oh god, yes, he knew them.  He had heard them in his own nightmares for months.  Heard them and felt the crush of Steve’s hands around his throat, choking him, choking the life out of him, felt the razor slice through the thin skin of his cheek, seen the glint of light on the blade as Steve raised it to his own throat.
Steve pulled out of his hands, opened the car door. “I love you, Tony,” he said, then slipped out of the car and went inside without looking back.
Tony shrugged again, and even though he was giving off an air of detachment, Steve could feel the tension in his muscles, could see the taut line of his shoulders. “You know. If you wanted.”
this time, right there in front of him with only shadows and the rippling illusion of pool water to disguise it made this time the worst time to be imagining it again. Or maybe it was the best time to imagine it. He didn’t know. His brain was still currently off-line.
Natasha gave him a final squeeze then snuggled down in his arms again.  One rogue finger traced along the smooth line of his jaw.  “I really do miss your beard,” she said drowsily.

jokes. Just his. Not some stupid fucking soldier-type with a jawline as strong as Steve’s, and blue eyes that Tony thought looked just a little less soulful than Steve’s, but maybe more prone to sarcastic humor of the type Tony himself specialized in, and just what the fuck, Steven Grant Rogers? Huh? Trading up? Is that what he thought he was doing?
“Hi--” he looked at Tony, distressed.  “I can’t say it, Tony.  In fact, maybe that’s part of the reason he hates me.  Because I let you name him such a dumb name.”
He tapped his fork against the edge of his plate.  “What’d we say?  When we were eighty?  If neither of us were married?”
Steve shrugged.  “Sam’s probably.  For a day or two, anyway.  Nick said he’d set something more permanent up if I wanted.”
It wasn’t until the sun peeked over the horizon that Tony realized how tired he was.  How drained.  How hungry.  The sadness he knew about.  No surprise there.
Steve jerked his head up to stare into his eyes. They were wild, those eyes. Wild with need and reddest want, now tempered with indecision.
Tony stared hard at him, then when he couldn’t stand it anymore, he pounced on him, covering his face and mouth in fierce kisses. Attacking him with kisses. “Don’t you
Sam shook his head, squeezing his shoulder.  “It’s alright, Steve.  You go on to bed.”  He lifted his eyes to Tony and looked at him steadily, conveying with his eyes alone what the expectations were:
Steve nodded.  He’d like to see Christmas in New York again.  It would be a warm memory to take with him.  “Agreed.”
Tony leaned into Steve’s chest, knocking his head a couple of times against the hard muscle.  “And here I thought I was the dad.”
“It’s not right, Jeff,” Steve said.  His hand was filled with bills.  Five hundreds.  He held them out.  “Please? This is beautiful,” he said, gesturing to the flower-bedecked cake.  “It had to’ve taken you hours, plus the cost of supplies…”
“Really?” Rhodey said.  “Because it looks to me like he made the right call.  You’ve lost weight, and you don’t look like you’ve been sleeping.”  He gave Tony a stern, motherly look.  “You look like shit, man, and if you can’t talk to him, then talk to me.”
“I can’t,” Steve said, and slipped his hands down to Tony’s hips, curling around them and tugging him closer. “I’ve got a...thing.”
The loose community around the lake was sponsoring a firework display tonight before the big celebration in town tomorrow.  Tony had donated a couple hundred dollars after the area Girl Scouts came around asking with their big eyes and shy smiles.  Steve winked at them as they left, and Tony watched them dissolve into breathy giggles, clutching each other as they left.  “He’s
He took a look at the medical setup. His IV line was connected to two sources: a bag of saline and a analgesia machine with morphine locked inside. The bag of saline was nearly empty, and there was a fresh bag next to it for the oncoming nurse to easily hook up. How fortuitous for Tony. He removed a pre-filled syringe from the bag he carried and injected some of its contents into the running bag of saline and the rest of it into the fresh bag. He disposed of it in the sharps container.
Around dawn, Steve walked into the lab in sleep pants and bed head. “Hey, guys. FRIDAY says you've been down here for hours. Couldn't sleep?” Steve leaned over Tony for a kiss.
He added another pump of the lube to his fingers and leaned down, reaching his hand under Steve. He had just started massaging the oil over Steve's tight hole when he caught Steve watching him. It was arousing but odd. Patchy as some of his memories were, they all showed Steve lying back, eyes closed, feeling what Bucky did to him instead of watching him do it.
,” the President cut him off. “As long as I'm President of the United States of America, my administration will consider Sergeant Barnes and the Winter Soldier to be two separate entities. Sergeant Barnes is not to be held accountable for the actions of the Winter Soldier, a title forced on him after he was captured serving his country honorably in one of our side's most elite military units.
Tony was done with Steve's restraint. “So do your goddamn job. Pop in there and let them know there's a problem. At least evacuate the UN members.”
King T'Chaka of Wakanda was giving quite the inspirational speech when the unthinkable happened. “When a stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we, in Wakanda, were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria were part of a good will mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for working with the international community in this initiative. Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.”
Steve got his kiss then. It was odd but thrilling having Tony's lips on his and Bucky's lips on the side of his neck. Threesomes had never held his interest, but then, he associated them with casual sex. He loved both Tony and Bucky deep down into his bones. For the first time, he was really looking forward to the threesomes their future relationship promised.
“How did-” Bucky shook his head, not wanting to know how Tony was able to run those tests. He picked up a hot pink vial. “Strawberry flavored,” he read aloud. He looked over the many tubes again. “Why are there so many lubes in the twenty-first century? I'm trying to have my way with you, but now I gotta sit here and read a hundred tiny bottles.”
Steve returned to staring into nothing. “I'm not mad at you. I know you didn't do it on purpose. But I don't feel like talking, so if you could just....” He let his sentence trail off, not actually having to tell Tony to leave him alone for his request to be understood.
,” Tony corrected. “Polygamy is having multiple spouses, which... not technically legal in this country; polyamory is just loving more than one person. Technically,
Rhodey, Clint, Natasha, and Sam were sitting around the dining table finishing breakfast. The UN members were filing into the building to begin discussing Tony's Accords. The Avengers were not invited to the assembly.
Steve looked sympathetic. “We don't know yet, but Wanda'll get it out of him. Just give her a minute.”
They moved together for a long while. Steve maintained a slow tempo the entire time, but slowed further or even paused several times when he felt like one of them was getting too close. He would switch between kissing Bucky, running a hand through his long hair, and just enjoying the feeling of Bucky moving in and out of him and his hands on his body.
Tony was one step ahead of him. He commanded the attention of the room, something he was very good at. “Sergeant Barnes is
There was a noise from the back of the Quinjet. Everyone turned to look for the source and saw King T'Challa standing there wearing black body armor and holding a catlike helmet and a large suitcase. He eyed all three of them with suspicion. “I'm interrupting something.”
Tony sputtered. “Not the same,” he argued. “That was for science. More to the point, if this guy is brazen enough to do what he did to Captain America in a room full of Avengers, what might he do to literally anyone else?”
They lingered near the bedroom door in silence for a few minutes before Tony said, “I have some things I need to get done. Stay with Barnes. Show him around, help him get settled in... order him some food. He's probably exhausted; I figure he'll eat and then sleep. The Accords can wait until tomorrow.”
Bucky understood that the parade was, unfortunately, part of the quid pro quo. The president didn't need to get so personally involved, he didn't have to pull any strings or call in any favors, nor did he have to publicly support him. In return for his help, the president hoped to create a celebrity status for Bucky, then use that status to boost the number of votes he would get during this year's November election.
Tony smiled that big, fake smile he created for business dealings. “We would be honored for you to join us, Your Highness.”
Steve and Tony were curled up together on one of the sofas watching a popular TV series that had been on Steve's list for a while. Steve had been watching it most of the night while Vision patrolled the facility, monitoring for the tac team's return. Tony had joined Steve a couple hours before dawn.
A few hours later, the remaining members of the team were gathered in the living area with snacks to watch the Accords on the international news. It was going well. The UN agreed to delay the vote in order to review Tony's counter-proposal, like Natasha expected them to.
he mouthed and pantomimed. “You two owe Steve a huge apology when we get back!” He whispered, “Iron Man colors,” gave them a thumbs-up, and followed Steve and Natasha into the Quinjet.
, alright? Good job keeping your cool in there, though; I know what was a tense situation. And Tasha, I'm sorry about... I didn't mean to grab your arm. I was just worried you were gonna beat the entire tac team to death with that thing.”
“You don't know that. We're in the UN headquarters. They could be watching or listening to us right now.”
“He doesn't need a play-by-play,” Steve interrupted, embarrassed by the details and not wanting anyone else to know.
Steve shook his head. He understood what Clint was hinting at just fine. Normally he'd scold him, pointing out that what he and Tony did in private was nobody's business. But time was catching up with Steve; it wasn't the forties anymore. People were open about these things nowadays. There were radio stations dedicated to discussions about sex. People divulged private sexual details on daytime television programs and on social media. Even celebrities sometimes talked about very private things on the late night shows.
The issue taken care of, the Avengers settled in for the evening. Steve knew Tony had been up all last night, so after a quick bite to eat, Steve took Tony by the hand into the suite's master bedroom. After they were both washed up and Tony was sound asleep, Steve threw on a tank top and sleep pants and joined the rest of the team relaxing in the living area. The team looked up at him and smiled in unison when he emerged from the master bedroom. It was a little creepy. He assumed they were trying to be extra nice because of the shit day they knew he'd had.
They were all fully dressed and geared within ninety seconds and heading out of the suite. They hurried to the UN's assembly room. “No response from King T'Challa or Agent Ross,” FRIDAY informed them on the way.
“The tactical team appears uninjured,” Vision answered Tony. He went on to explain to Steve, “The Winter Soldiers are not restrained, though they appear docile. I overheard the tactical team. They've used the code words to subdue them and are planning on presenting them to the UN as a possible addition to their team.”
They entered at the back center of the room. There were three curved rows of five tables, and at each table sat two chairs. The rows had a mild stadium seating effect in that each row was two steps higher than the one in front if it. The front of the room had large screens that were off at the moment. The sides of the room were lined with computer stations.
Their contact finished showing them around, accepted a hefty tip from Tony, and left them alone. As soon as the door closed behind him, just about everybody rounded on Steve and demanded to know if he was okay.
“Where were we?” Tony looked around the room. “Ah, yes. Everyone was going to read my version of the Accords; we'll fine-tune it after dinner. Dismissed.” As everybody got up to leave – for real this time – Tony kept Steve and Bucky back.
, and it looks like there isn't space on the docket until Wednesday.” In front of five Winter Soldiers and the UN's entire chamber, he actually grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and started to write. He turned to the UN member cowering behind the table he was standing on. “Hey man, how do you spell Habeus Corpus?”
Steve uprooted more grass as he lurched to a halt a couple feet from Bucky, Vision silent at his flank. Steve and Bucky stared at each other for a moment. “Do you know me?”
“Not wrong, no. Something's just... a thing.” Tony told them that he and President Ellis have a plan to ensure that Bucky would be able to move forward with his life without legal issues related to the Winter Soldier hanging over his head.
He followed Bucky's collarbones to the other side of his body, making his way down the left much like how he made his way up the right. He spent more time on his left shoulder and arm than he did the right. The shoulder was massively scarred along the edge of his metal arm, and then there was the matter of the arm itself. Steve hadn't exactly gotten to inspect it two years prior, and he tried not to pry when Bucky first showed up. He gave this arm and hand the same treatment as the other, though there were no scars to focus on. No matter who designed the arm or why, it was a part of Bucky now, which means Steve loved it.
During the apprehension of Zemo, the team had found in his possession a red book with a black star on it. The entire thing was in Russian, so Natasha volunteered to read it and was still doing so when the jet landed.
Bucky put the flavored abomination back in the pile. He knelt between Steve's thighs and pumped some of the clear lubricant over the first two fingers on his right hand. He swirled the slippery substance with his thumb to get familiar with it, watching it glisten in the fluorescent lighting. He tried it out on the head of his penis. It felt silky; he found he preferred it over the KY they used in the late thirties and early forties. It was cool, but it warmed as he spread it most of the way down the shaft.
Steve was too emotional to form words. He turned and walked silently out of the room, presumably headed back to the Quinjet to be alone with his humiliation.
Steve had other plans. He wedged himself between Bucky's ankles and ran his hand up Bucky's right lower leg. He looked Bucky in the eye and planted a tiny kiss on his knee.
“Oh good, you know who I am. That means you know why I'm here.” At Tony's bidding, another piece of custom tech slithered into and over the man's mouth and nose. It wasn't suffocating him, just silencing him. Tony didn't care what the man might have to say. He leaned over the helpless man and reveled in the fear on his face. “Revenge just isn't as satisfying when your victim doesn't understand what's going on, wouldn't you agree, Commander?”
Steve looked sheepish. “Sorry.” He kissed Bucky some more, gently this time, like he had learned to be with Tony. He planted little kisses on his lips, down the side of his face, and back up the other side. He got back around to Bucky's lips, then got distracted by his increasingly uncomfortable untouched erection and feeling Bucky's up against him. “You know, Buck, I thought we were gonna do more than kiss.”
The first was just this sense of rightness in being next to Bucky again, of having his eternally loyal companion's naked body spooned against his.
Since the Winter Soldiers were unarmed and outnumbered – and lacked the element of surprise – the Avengers made quick work of them. The were all in custody and no longer resisting within sixty seconds. One of the UN's other tactical teams showed up with heavy duty restraints and containment vehicles to transfer them to some maximum security prison in the middle of the ocean.
Ross's mood wasn't softened. He scoffed and sputtered at the President's comment. “Mr. President... the Winter Soldier-”
Later that day, Tony held a press conference to introduce the new members of the Avengers. The UN had selected their two appointees quickly, and Tony thought that would be a good a time as any to add three other people he'd had his eye on.
Before T'Challa could answer, the apparent tac team leader responded in a thick Russian accent. “Oh that's not just any metal, that's
Steve smiled at Tony being classic Tony. “Tony will take any vaguely sexual threat as flirting. And just for the record, he's insatiable, adventurous, and completely shameless, so he'd probably actually like that.”
Steve's jaw dropped, and he gasped. “Wh- That's not-” He looked at Tony. He could read his fiancé well. Tony was trying to hide embarrassment and hurt behind a sardonic half-grin. “Tony, you satisfy me,” Steve swore.
Tony's eyebrows shot up nearly to his hairline. “Two and a half. Really.” He grinned at Steve. “Good for you,” he said sincerely.
of his friends would kick his ass. But today, Steve was determined to take the high road, which meant placing the book in that bigoted prick's hand. He took the two steps necessary and handed him the book.
“I could have every last one of you hanged for treason for not alerting your country to the presence of the goddamn Winter Soldier!”
Steve wanted to return the favor with Bucky's shirt, but his didn't have a closure to open, and Steve couldn't bear to stop kissing Bucky for even a moment. He easily ripped it down the middle, causing Bucky to flinch and chuckle lightly. He let the destroyed t-shirt flutter to the floor.
“I gotta be honest, that attitude is a bit nineteen-forties for me. In this century, we understand that touching someone's ass without consent is sexual assault.”
Also like everyone else, they managed to agree that Tony had covered the concerns they'd expressed and that this document should be sent to the UN for review.
They were nearly to the compound, anyway, so they landed to refuel and interrogate Bucky about Zemo. Sam and Clint went to raid the kitchen for the trip back to Vienna; everyone else stayed on the Quinjet.
Sam sighed dramatically. “Alright, but we better not go to jail for this!” He put down the pen and paper and rejoined his team.
“Did someone say threesome?” Bucky asked, walking out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe. He headed to the closet to pick out some clothes and change behind the open closet door.
Bucky was content to let Steve lead, as he was wont to do in most areas of their lives. That's not to say that Bucky had nothing to do. He spent much of their time together feeling Steve's muscles work under his hands as Steve writhed on top of him. A few times, he hooked his arms around Steve's shoulders, pulled himself up to meet Steve's body, and let Steve bear his weight as they kissed.
Steve fake-smiled at Rhodey. “Tony's had real bad insomnia since New York. You of all people should understand that. I do what I can to help.”
“Yes, and-” Tony paused to squint at Rhodey. “And I do tend to rub people the wrong way. There's nothing suspicious about me looking like I've been hit in the face. It comes with the territ-” He stopped mid-word at a familiar image and chuckled proudly to himself. He held up the image. “Well this was just sexcapades gone wrong. Remember that, hon?” He showed it to Steve.
After about one minute, Wanda came back out of the jet. “He wants to know where you and the other Winter Soldiers were kept in Siberia,” she said. She glanced at Tony.
The team exchanged harsh looks and hushed words briefly before coming to the consensus that they didn't want
“Your fiancé got us lube?” Bucky asked with a laugh. Bucky escaped Steve's hold and leaned over to open the drawer. He pulled a handful of small, brightly colored plastic tubes from the drawer and set them on the bed next to Steve. He pulled out a second handful and a third. He marveled at the oversized collection threatening to spill onto the floor. “Your fiancé got us
The Avengers reveled in Ross's embarrassment at being dressed-down in front of them by President Ellis. Ross scowled and sighed. He did as he was ordered, though. He looked Bucky in the eye and extended his hand. “Thank you, Sergeant Barnes, for your service and your sacrifices for our country and our planet.” He would have looked more comfortable having a prostate exam in front of a live audience.
The Avengers had just been informed that the United Nations was drawing up a document that was being called the Sokovia Accords. These Accords would make any non-U.N.-sanctioned action by any Avenger illegal. They could get on board or risk prison.
The first time, the twelve-second time, they'd both just missed each other so much. The second time? Well, they were making up for lost time, weren't they? Bucky felt satiated and loved. This felt entirely different. Steve's desperation felt different. He was acting like an involuntarily sober alcoholic digging through rubble in search of an unbroken bottle of rum.
Natasha cocked her head. “Oh, I was,” she admitted with a shameless shrug. Then she looked behind him. “Tony, what are you doing?”
Bucky laughed smugly. He pulled his fingers out of Steve, enjoying how Steve involuntarily bucked his hips at the loss. Seems Steve didn't learn any patience in the last seventy years. He crawled up Steve's body to ensure they were aligned. Bucky folded Steve's right leg out of the way, giving his own left knee space under Steve's thigh to find a little leverage. Steve seemed determined to maintain eye contact, and Bucky was happy to oblige.
“It's not a coincidence,” Tony argued. “A week and a half ago, Steve – Captain America and I announced that we're getting married. Barnes and Cap were together for a long time in the thirties and forties. Barnes saw us all over the news and tabloids, and it sparked memories that had been buried when Hydra brainwashed him. That's why he showed up when he did.”
“The code words?” Bucky repeated. “They volunteered for this shit, Steve. They never used the code words.”
at him. Really looking. Since he'd arrived a couple days prior, he'd had this perpetually shell-shocked, pseudo-unfocused stare. Even when he looked at Steve and told him he loved him, it seemed like he was remembering more than feeling. Like: yes, this is my childhood friend, brother-in-arms, and first love, Steve.
Clint looked around, feigning confusion. He'd noticed what they'd done, too, and he wasn't gonna have it. He pointed at himself. “Me? You think
a lot better.” He pulled out of the hug, then looked around them as if he were unsure of something. “Come with me.” He lead Steve into the compound away from potentially prying eyes and didn't stop until they were in his room. Once the door was shut, he pulled Steve close and kissed him.
Steve reached over, picked out the medium-sized clear bottle he recognized, and put it in Bucky's hand. “This one,” he said.
Steve was about to point out that he and Tony kept plenty in their room, but before he could say so, FRIDAY announced to them:
There were twelve tac team members, fully suited and ready for a mission. Their team took up the left three tables in the front two rows, but two members were standing in the front of the room in conversation. The Avengers weren't provided with the tac team's personnel information as it was considered top secret, but they assumed that the grizzly, older man at the front was their leader.
Steve, Bucky, and Tony followed the drone to a room Steve had previously believed to be empty. The room's décor didn't have a lot of personality, but it did have several large digital picture frames, all of which apparently rotated different pictures of Steve. There was one poster-sized group picture of the Howling Commandos above the headboard.
shutting-down noise. Steve and Tony looked toward the back of the room where the projector was installed. The cable leading to the projector was sliced clean through. A couple feet away, embedded in the wall, was a solitary arrow. Steve and Tony looked at Clint, who had his bow in his hands.
The jokes about them flirting or “arguing like an old married couple” went out the window once people found out that they were, in fact, a couple. Steve would have killed for one of those jokes right now to temper the mood in the room. He stared down his shiny new fiancé while he fiddled with his shiny new engagement ring. Situations like this were why it took them so long to share their relationship: as much as they both wanted it to work, neither one of them had a lot of hope that it would last very long.
Tony's whole body flinched, a deliberate exaggeration of shock, no doubt. He looked around the room dramatically as if he were expecting an audience to share in his surprise. “You
Steve narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. “I think your technology doesn't always work the way you want it to. Weren't you having a problem interfacing with the UN's software just this morning?”
Tony fiddled with the Quinjet controls. “Yeah, I'm sure you find sex with me all manner of satisfactory.”
Natasha was connecting the dots. She asked Tony, “Did you try to give yourself a super-soldier serum just to improve your sex life?”
Steve shook his head. They both knew that Tony was the freak and that left everything on the table. Tony left for Vienna half an hour later with Natasha, Rhodey, and Vision.
There was a knock on the door. Tony called out to him from the hallway. Steve was about to respond that he'd be there in just a minute, then get up and get dressed. Bucky beat him to the punch. He invited Tony in without letting go of Steve.
Tony wanted to apologize, but he also didn't really wanna fuck with Steve when he was in that mood. Then again, maybe apologizing would help his mood. “Honey?” he tried tentatively.
“I’ll try, Nat,” he said.  “But if I can’t...if it looks like I’m not going to be able to…” He looked into her eyes.  No, there was no green.  Just clear, crystal blue.  “Don’t let them move me, okay?  If I’m going to die, I want it to be here.”
, Tony told himself--but that rigid, worried line of his shoulders softened. His mouth softened too, and Tony wanted it on him. On his mouth. His chest. His wherever else Steve wanted to put it. He wasn't a picky man.
We just knew you weren't where you were supposed to be."  He squeezed the back of Steve's neck again. "We just knew you weren't with us."
Steve’s eyes went darker, and he slipped silently off the bed to kneel on the floor at Tony’s feet. He was wearing boots. Leather. Expensive. Tony propped himself up on his elbows to watch as Steve grasped one of them and pulled it slowly off Tony’s foot. He sat it aside, and moved to the next. He gazed up at Tony, meeting his eye, and lifted Tony’s foot a little, then bent deliberately forward and touched his lips to the leather.
“For you,” Steve said, letting the words roll off his tongue. His heart might be doing wild somersaults, but his brain was still peaceful. Still cucumber-cool. He lifted his glass and drank again. “I just wanted to see how long it would take before you came over here and talked to me.”
“Sure I did,” she said, then kissed the top of his head again. “But I had you. And I had my work, and my friends, and Adelle Perkins, and the church.” Steve snorted a little, and she squeezed him against her side. “Don’t laugh. It was a real comfort to me.”
Tony leaned into him again. “Please. You don’t even know how to be mean,” he chided softly, and Steve smiled. Tony’s heart picked itself up, dusted itself off, and climbed back up into place.
The pizza place didn’t want to deliver.  Too far away, the guy said.  It would cost more in gas than it was worth, the guy said.  Oh, and the pie would get cold.  He said that as an afterthought, but it came out sounding like an apology.
They christened the pool with a party full of margaritas and nachos and dancing and, of course, swimming. Tony indulged himself in everything but the margaritas. Just because Steve wasn’t looking out for his refreshment needs anymore didn’t mean he’d gone back to his old ways. He was still a grown-up, after all. He could get his own drinks. It wasn’t rocket science to keep a cooler full of water and soda. Sure, it might take a little more planning than he was used to, but he could do it. He ran a multi-billion dollar company, he could remember to have J put in an order for a couple cases of water, and it wasn’t like it was difficult to get somebody to help haul it up the stairs. In fact, that might have been the easiest part. Bruce was always willing to grab the other handle of a cooler and help him wrangle it, and Thor was even easier. All Tony had to do was say, “Hey, I’ll bet you can’t lift that one-handed,” and it practically flew up the stairs. Tony was positive Thor would do it if he just asked him nicely, but this way was more fun. It got Tony what he wanted and gave Thor some bragging rights. It was a win-win.
Steve laughed under his breath. He looked like he was enjoying this just as much as Tony was. He hadn’t even reached for his drink for a while. Not since they had really started talking. Tony felt an intense and immediate satisfaction in that. “It was one time,” Steve said softly, still smiling that little, enigmatic smile. “I think he felt sorry for me.” He shrugged again. “Or, you know, he was just being polite.”
Tony laid tiny kisses between Steve’s shoulder blades, down his spine to the small of his back, as he lubed up his own cock. “Ready, baby?” he said.
Tony squeezed his knees together against Steve’s, trapping him.  “I remember,” he said dismissively.  “Anyway, you apologized.  Do you believe that?
“Go away,” he muttered, and even with his head on his knees, Tony could still hear how wounded he sounded.  “Go away.  You’re not here.  Just go away.”
Steve pushed Tony’s shirt up and pressed a gentle, friendly kiss to the skin he’d uncovered, then let the fabric fall back and curled tighter into Tony’s side, dragging the blanket with him, wrapping it around himself.
was the one going somewhere. He was floating. Floating away into the ether. Into the never-never land on the other side of that sunrise that was Tony’s voice.
He turned his back and started for the door, but a white-hot lance of pain struck the middle of his back.  It was brief but intense.  He fell forward, barely catching himself on his palms, then rolled over onto his back.
He looked up, staring frankly into Tony’s eyes.  Tony shook his head.  “I don’t have a fucking clue, man.”
The pain was intense, excruciating, like a raging fire had been kindled just inside his belly.  He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move.  He felt paralyzed, and all he could see was Ross.  Thaddeus Ross’ smug face hovering over him.
“Language, Rogers,” Sam said, and they both laughed, leaning into each other, their heads together, Sam’s arm around Steve’s neck. When the laughter died down, Sam tightened his hold, hugging Steve to him. “I’ll tell her to back off a little, okay? I know you’re not in that headspace right now.”
, I just can’t--” his mouth began to work, tears of fear, of frustration filled his eyes, broke free, and ran down his cheeks.
Steve sat up straight and looked at her with a raised eyebrow. “Mom,” he said in an amused tone. Dodger thumped his tail on the floor at the sound of it. “Did you just give me your blessing to be in a three-way relationship?”
“When I come back in the fall to go to school, you’ll pay for it, like we agreed. You’ll pay my room and board, and my other expenses. You said you would, and you will.”
A sudden wave of possessive protectiveness swept over him.  He needed to keep Steve safe.  He needed to guard him against anything and everything that could harm him.  He was like a rough jewel and he needed to be watched and protected.
“It’s no big deal,” Steve said slowly.  “I used to smoke sometimes before the ice.  Everybody did.  It’s fine.”
space was upsetting him a lot. In fact, he hated it. Hated himself for allowing it. And Steve must have caught some of that because he was frowning again. Concerned.
Steve let his tongue touch his lip, and now Tony was absolutely convinced it was on purpose. “I think you’re special too, Tony,” he whispered. “I like you.”
“No.” He laughed a little and traced one finger along Steve’s jaw. “I was a little pissed earlier.” Steve opened his mouth to apologize again, but Tony put his finger across his lips. “Not at
to bed in the first place, and made his slow, careful, old-man way into the living room where the bar was.  There was a bottle of Wild Turkey in there, just a-calling his name.
“She’s in recovery now,” he was saying, his voice pleasant and mild. “I’m keeping her overnight, but you can take her home in the morning.”
He stewed instead. Reread Steve’s text a thousand times. Reread his own a thousand more. Tried to decipher some kind of meaning that he had not understood before, but it stayed stubbornly vague, no matter how much of his considerable brain power he put toward it.
Steve laughed.  “Sit down, okay?  It’s nothing.  I’m healing fine. The nurses say I’ll be better in a few days.”
. And now here it was again. Finally. He breathed deeply as Tony stopped in front of him, smiled up at him, and it was all he could do to not just wrap him up in his arms right then and there.
Steve smiled secretly. He squeezed Tony tighter against him. “I’ve been thinking about it since we were seventeen, Tony,” he said. “
Tony hated the toneless sound of his voice.  There was nothing behind it, no anger, no hurt, just emptiness.  For a split second, Tony wished Thanos was here again, just so he could kick him in the nuts.  He bit his lip as a desperate, liquid laughter rose up in his throat.  He fought it back before it could escape.  Letting it out would be beyond cruel.  Steve would never understand, and Tony would light himself on fire before doing that to him.
Steve was silent for a long time, but Tony knew he was awake.  He could almost hear the cogs turning in his head.
Steve sat on the bed, leaning against the wall.  His knees were drawn up to his chest.  He looked puzzled instead of surprised.  “Hey guys,” he said.  “Um, what are you doing here?”
.  In every mood, every light, every way.  Smiling, angry, asleep in the bed they’d shared, lounging on the deck with his feet up on the railing.  He saw himself in the lab in the Tower, glasses on, face set while his hands flew over images, correcting, assessing, rearranging.  He saw himself driving the Bentley.  He saw himself as Iron Man, a streak of red and gold, gorgeous and glinting in the sun.  He saw himself on his knees, gazing up, his hair rumpled from Steve’s restless, roaming hands while he took Steve into his mouth.
“Oh, he doesn’t expect it to stick,” Clint said lightly.  “He just needs enough to get you put in a holding cell for an hour.  Enough for the press to get your names and photos and put them on-line.  How long will it take, Tony?”
“I can’t.  I’ve still got some stuff to go over.  I need to study the schematics for the ship that Nebula gave us.”
Tony had wanted to kill Ross.  Plain and simple.  Tony, Wanda, Clint, and surprisingly, Nick Fury had all been on the side of just getting rid of him.   But, they had been outvoted.  Stephen Strange, Natasha, Bruce, and Sam all had cooler heads and voted on the side of mercy.  Thor had been the deciding vote.  After Loki, Tony had known what he would say, but he was as much Steve’s family as any of them, and deserved a vote. There had been a lot of back and forth after that.  A lot of debate.  Wanda had been especially keen on the idea of an eye-for-an-eye.  She had been in Steve’s head, after all.  She had experienced everything he had, from the confusion and pain of the drugs, to the multiple suicide attempts--
“Okay, okay, simmer down, fanboy,” Tony said.  “Don’t get yourself in a twist.  The Chagall’s great.”  Although, to Tony’s eye,
Steve glanced down at himself. He had grown up too since they’d last seen each other. Of course, he had. Six years was a long time. He’d put on height and some muscle, but for some reason, he didn’t
“Guess we better,” he said, and straightened.  Tony ran a distracted hand through his own hair and brushed his thumb across Steve’s knuckles.  “Yeah,” he continued, “we probably should get something checked.  I called you ‘my friend’.”  He huffed a rueful little laugh, his eyes flitting around the room, lighting on Steve’s for only a second before darting away again.  “That was an asshole thing to do.  I’m sorry.”
But Steve was already turning to him, already slipping his arms around Tony’s middle. “Me neither,” he said, and dipped his head onto Tony’s shoulder, holding him tight.
So, he went back to Malibu.  And started drinking in earnest.  And nobody came to ask how he was.  Nobody came to stop him.
Thanks for indulging me, LOL! Back to our regularly-scheduled plot next chapter. And I seriously think there's only two left now!
I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the night.  Kind of a nice feeling after the shit couple of months I've had! :)
Tony almost let him go, and instead, pulled him closer, wrapping his arm around him, tugging him against his side.  “I don’t think I can give him up without a fight.”
Tony gave him a critical eye.  Jeans, sneakers, dark blue button-down.  The cuffs were unbuttoned and rolled to the elbow, exposing sinewy forearms, the collar open just enough for a white t-shirt to peek out.  His face was smooth, his hair, dark blond and thick, touched the collar of his shirt.
Tony cupped his cheek with the hand not on his back.  Steve closed his eyes, leaning into Tony’s touch.  “Tell me what’s wrong.”
Steve nodded up at him gratefully.  Tony watched out of the corner of his eye and shook his head in disgust.  Stephen Strange to the rescue, once again.
-eleven. He took them outside when he was done writing. He lit a cigarette with his lighter, then touched the flame to the edge of the paper, watching it consume his words, his desire, his love with its cleansing fire, erasing them until the next time.
Tony nodded. Kissed him. “I mean, I might not have wanted to admit it,” he said, and Steve laughed, low and fond. “But I felt it. I always felt it.”
“Maybe,” Tony said evenly.  “Maybe that was some of it, but we would have given up some of the stuff to have him around more.  My mother, especially.”
--but he kept silent.  Ross wanted him to fly off the handle.  He had no doubt Ross believed every word he was saying, but if Tony responded that way, Ross would win.  Tony couldn’t let him win.  He’d won enough.
“Uh-huh.” And he was. He was good. But for some reason, the tears still wanted to fall. They still seemed to be caught in his throat. He blinked rapidly, trying hard to get rid of them, but they were stubborn. Resistant. Steve could think of only one way to get rid of them, and so he did it. Or said it, anyway. “I miss you, Tony.”
“I shouldn’t do this,” Tony whispered, even as he put his arm around Steve’s neck and pulled him closer.
Steve woke from a troubled sleep to the sound of his phone ringing. He rolled over, feeling slow and stupid with sleep and the evening heat.  He picked it up, saw Tony’s name, but before he could answer, it stopped ringing.
He sat down.  “What happened?” he said.  He tried very hard to say it calmly.  A couple people had glanced their way when Steve first came in, but now they went back to their own visits.  That was good.  He didn’t want to disrupt anyone else.  If they were anything like him, they had been looking forward to it for the last two weeks.  He took a deep breath and Steve watched him, his eyes a heavy weight, watching to make sure Tony was going to stay calm.  “Are you okay?” he asked, and Steve smiled approvingly.
“Yeah. You are. You’re-” he shook his head, waving his hand vaguely, “-more...I don’t know. Just different.”
“He called me,” Rhodey said mildly, and took a long pull from his beer.  “He said you needed somebody to talk to.”
slow. Slower than-” he ran a distracted hand through his hair, but his eyes never left Tony’s. They stayed put. Drinking him in, filling to the brim with him. “Slower than anything. Than everything.”
Steve took a stumbling step backward. “No,” he muttered. “No. Sorry. No. I’m okay.” He fumbled with the doorknob and opened the door. “I’m sorry, Ton-Jack.
“And don’t think about it too much longer,” he said. “‘Cause I’m ready. I’m ready right now.” He was speaking into Steve’s chest, but Steve could hear--almost feel--the sincerity and happiness in his voice. “I mean, no pressure, but I’m ready right the fuck now.”
Steve let out a breath. He was right. Steve knew he was right. It didn’t matter how much he tried, he could never allow Pietro full access to his inner heart. It was too full already. Too full of memories. Too full of pain. Too full of the love he didn’t want to feel and couldn’t forget. And too full of the knowledge of just how pitiful that was. How pitiful
“Yes, it is,” Ross agreed.  “Comfortable, that is.  Unfortunately, it’s not so lucky for me if that means you’re staying.”
Steve’s shoulders eased, the hum of electricity eased with it, but the warmth remained.  The warmth that was Steve.  Just Steve.
was the Steve he had known. This dry humor. This tiny, pleased smile. He didn’t know who that other guy at the reception had been, but this was someone he could talk to. Someone he
Tony plucked it out of his lap and looked.  It was a sketch of the lake and their little scrap of beach, a suggestion of the trees and meadow.  The Bentley was off to the side, just beginning to take shape under Steve’s talented fingers.
Steve moved on to the nail of Tony’s ring finger. Painted it with easy, precise strokes. “Then, I’m there.”
Steve swiped at the blood and sat up.  Nat watched him warily, clearly waiting for another attack.  He held his hand up.
a next time. If Tony and Morgan didn’t just decide to leave him at the proverbial altar. He wouldn’t blame them if they did. He sucked.
“That’s why I do it,” Tony said, and now he sounded almost smug. He leaned closer to Steve, lying against his broad chest and nuzzling his neck. “I like to get my own way. But the good thing is, my way is usually pretty good for you too.”
“I know the two of you have had a rocky go of it, but do not sit there and act like you don’t think it was worth it.  Even now, after all your shit.  He owes you.
Okay. This is short, and I'm not going to say it's NOT cheesy, but I don't care. Here we go with the start of something!
He put his arm around her, used the other hand to scuff Dodger’s fur, trying to ease him as much as his mother. “It’s okay, Mom,” he said, unable to keep the hint of laughter out of his voice. “Really.”
He took his jacket off and threw it over the back of the couch. He should paint for a while. He was almost done, and he should just power through and finish. But right now, he just couldn’t do it. Right now, all he wanted was to see Tony. Right now, that seemed like the most vital thing in the entire world.
She wiped her lipstick off his cheek with her thumb, then turned to Howard. “Have a nice day, Mr. Stark,” she said.
Some nights, they didn’t have sex at all.  Some nights, they’d just shower and brush their teeth and get into bed.  Tony would prop his pillows up, put on his glasses, and work on his tablet.  Steve would do some homework--
Finally, Rhodey stood up and whistled piercingly loud.  Steve and Tony stopped in mid-rant, the words “goddamn drama queen” wilting on Steve’s lips.
“I must have walked for a long time,” he said. “I kept thinking--except it wasn’t like thinking. It was like I was back there, you know? Back in the desert. It was warm today, but I remember I felt
“Come here,” Steve said, and folded him into his arms. Tony's first thought was that he should resist. That he should immediately go down to the lab and start redesigning Steve’s space here to better reflect the warmth of the man himself, but he didn’t. He relaxed into him instead. Put his head against his chest so he could hear that steady, reassuring heart beating in his ear, and when Steve bent his head to whisper in his ear, he sighed contentedly. “Do you want to hold off on dinner for a little while?” Steve asked. “I could run
Sam--and Tony--really did love dinosaurs, so after they were done with the Mayan exhibit, they went down to the dinosaur rooms and wandered around, talking about how cool the raptors and Tyrannosaurus Rex were. When they finally got tired of that, they got a burger, then, since neither had anything better to do, went to a movie.
The look Howard gave him was the most disappointed look he had ever received. He hated it. Feared it, and hated it. “Then you’re only proving just how selfish you really are,” Howard said. His lips twisted into a sad smile. “That’s the same decision I made, Steven. And I can tell you right now, if I had made a different one, Maria would probably be alive right now. She’d be with someone else. But she’d be alive.”
He poured a little olive oil in the bottom of the saute pan and fried the chicken lightly.  It smelled good.  Warm and inviting.  Frying wasn’t the healthiest choice, but sometimes, you just had to go with what tasted good.  And he knew this would taste good.  It was one of his go-to meals.  Tony always raved about it, no matter how often he made it.
“Hey,” Steve said, completely ignoring the question.  “Hey, Tony.  God, you’re a sight for sore eyes.”
fault Thad Ross was a complete and utter dick. And it wasn’t his fault that he had been at the bar tonight. Or that he had decided to come over to his and Sam’s table and start running his fucking mouth. No, that wasn’t Tony’s fault. Not at all. What came after might have been his fault...but not really. He couldn’t help it if his fist suddenly connected with Ross’s nose with a satisfying crunch, or that Tony had liked that sound so much he decided to just hit him again. No, that wasn’t his fault.
“Hi,” Steve said. His hands were on Tony’s ass now, openly groping him and not giving one single fuck. He trailed hot kisses down his neck, then back up to his mouth, finding Tony’s tongue with his own, and letting them move together in that familiar, hungry way they had done for years.
Steve pulled him over the threshold, and leaned past him to close the door. He did it softly, but the sound of the latch seemed very loud in Tony’s ears.
She put her hand on his cheek, her eyes serious. “He’s in the bathroom,” she began, then overrode Tony when he opened his mouth to speak. “No, don’t worry. There’s nothing in there that can hurt him. He’s not in that mind-set, alright? But even if he was, Sam took his razors and all his medications out of the medicine cabinet. Dodger’s with him, and the door isn’t locked. He just wanted to be alone, and he likes that enclosed space sometimes. It seems to make his mind easier.”
“So good,” Tony agreed, and with that, Steve’s world was completely full. Completely happy. Tony was happy, so
Tony called Jerry and told him to meet Gina at the airport.  Fly her home, back to Long Island where there would be no memory of Steve Rogers to mess with the next guy who came along.
. Here with Tony in the clearing behind the school, and there was nowhere in the world or beyond it that he would rather be.
And he was wielding it now, even though he didn’t know it. Even though he had no idea of what he was doing to Tony. How his every word was tearing him open from the inside out. Tearing him open, and making him bleed not only from want and desire, but also from compassion.
The heat was on inside the jet, and after the frigid air outside, it was as warm and soft as a cozy blanket by the fire.  Steve stopped in the doorway, letting the warmth envelope him.  Tony heard him sigh.  Saw the tension ease out of his back.  He let his bag fall from his shoulder.  It thumped to the ground, heedlessly.
He pushed the button and stepped inside when the door opened.  A voice came through the speaker, authoritative, decidedly masculine.  “Access code.”
“Steve?” Tony said, knowing it was too late, knowing Steve would never answer, knowing he’d lost the best thing he didn’t know he had.
Tony smiled, resigned, hurt, and terribly sad.  “Sure it is, Cap.  Wherever you want.”  He started to walk away, then stopped cold when Steve spoke.
Dumb gratitude coursed through him.  He forgot Peggy, he forgot Tony, he forgot even that shivery, electric feeling that resided in the axe’s haft.  He nodded.  “Okay,” he said, “yeah, of course, I’ll be there.”
anything. He was just being Howard. Asserting dominance just for the sake of dominating. Just for the sake of appearances, even if it was only to himself.
“You’re welcome,” he said, then squeezed him tight. “And you know you’re never gonna be alone, right?” he said into Tony’s ear. “I’m gonna make sure of it.
Steve let out a breath, let more of the stress of the day out on that exhale. “I’ve been missing him too.”
And now, for the first time, nerves started to flutter through his stomach. But these weren’t bad nerves. They felt good. Familiar. Like the way he had always felt before showing a new piece to Ms. Carter in school. Or the way he felt when he’d called Tony to ask him and Morgan out for the first time. “I don’t know, Mr. Stark,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I haven’t done any...
Tony lay against him again, resumed the light scratches over his body. “This is all kind of new. For me too. It’s going to take us a minute to figure out how to handle all these situations.”
signals. I thought you might be flirting with me, but-” He laughed again. “And I’m supposed to be a genius. I might need to get retested. I’ll book an appointment with somebody in the morning.”
There was a pause and Tony didn’t think he’d answer, then he said, “I asked what you talked about.  When you go see your doctor.”  Pause.  “I know it’s private, but…” He trailed off and Tony glanced at him.  He was still lying on his back, his straight, perfect nose pointed up, his lips parted slightly.  His eyes were closed.
“Yeah,” Tony said, turning around.  “I’ve been ‘just friends’ with a lot of people, too.”  He quirked his fingers into little air-quotes, spilling coffee out of his cup and onto the floor.
Steve shifted. He didn’t take his hand from Tony’s grasp, but he didn’t hold onto him either. He sighed. “Did they tell you what happened this morning?”
Sam hugged him one more time, then left, closing the door softly behind him. Tony ran his hands through his hair and sighed. He glanced around at the room. The layout was similar to the Rogers apartment upstairs, and it felt just as comfortable as those rooms always had.
quipped, which was often and well. They both missed Steve’s presence though, and spent the early part of the day pondering what he was doing, or what he would have thought about the exhibit. Neither of them said a word that was less-than-complementary--even as a joke--about the guy they both loved, and that just made the day better. Knowing that the other was just as much a fan of Steve as they were, was more than enough to seal their own friendship, and by noon, they were able to just relax and pay more attention to the Mayans themselves than whether or not the other was truly good enough for Steve Rogers.
,” he whispered as Steve’s tongue swept across his skin, his breath cooling the slight dampness left in its wake before fire took its place. It was a strange thing, feeling that combination of sensations, so soft and hot and then the scrape of his teeth running gently over the spot. Tony felt his knees weaken a bit, and he was glad Steve’s arms were around him, glad he was holding him up, or he definitely would have fallen.
Tony let it spin out, then spoke again.  “Are you okay in there?  Can I get you anything?  A glass of water?”
Steve looked down at his feet. He couldn’t bear to look at Tony anymore. To look at that face and know he was leaving, going back to that house with that man. He nodded silently.
“I’m sorry,” Tony snapped a little more sharply than even he wanted to, “how is this any of your business?”
Clint slipped through her hands with eerie speed and was cocking an arrow before she even  knew he was gone.
“Okay,” Steve said. He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand while he locked the door and turned off the lights. He held onto him, and Tony let him hold on. He let him lead him through the apartment to the bedroom, and Steve was glad he let him. Tony knew the way by now, of course, but Steve didn’t want to let go of him just yet.
Tony let out a short laugh.  “Sure I am,” he said coolly.  “That’s just some pretty heavy stuff you’re saying.  ‘Till death do us part’ kind of stuff.”
“You’re right,” Steve said, and stepped out of his grip, ignoring Tony’s “Hey!” of protest.  “No, you’re right.  I have something to say and if I keep touching you, it really will be mutual hand-jobs and I’ll forget what I wanted to tell you, and then you’ll be gone.”
Steve closed his eyes briefly, and when he opened them again, they were filled with wonder, awe, pain. Love. “‘Cause look at you,” he said softly. “I’ve been halfway around the world, Tony. I’ve seen things that,” he shook his head, “things that took my breath away. Both good and bad. But I’ve never seen anything--
him, Steve didn’t think any of them even remembered he was still in the room.  He sat silently, his hands bound by vibranium cuffs, as per Ross’ request, looking down at his lap.  A passerby might have assumed he had passed into a fugue state by the glassy-eyed, lax look on his face, but in fact, he was listening intently.  His mind, as brilliant in its own way as Tony’s, was gathering every word said and quickly and efficiently sorting them, weighing them, interpreting them.  He sat by and let it happen.  It was actually more akin to instinct than higher thought, what was going on in his brain, and soon, very soon, he would know when to speak.
Tony stood up.  He didn’t have an umbrella, and the rain was starting to fall harder.  Five minutes.  He’d give Ross five minutes, and then he’d give up and go home.  Steve would be home by now.  Waiting for him.  Whatever else he was doing, working out, reading, laundry, whatever, what he was really doing, was waiting for Tony.  He knew that was true because that’s what
.  Had still looked the same, talked the same, acted the same as the man he had known for so long.  The only difference was the smile when he saw Tony, the shy, intimate way he reached for his hand, the eyes that suddenly seemed deeper than they had before.  But those things, however different, had still felt
The days were still long. Autumn was still a long way off, calendar-wise, but that never did stop it from getting a little chilly when the sun went down. Even in the midst of Dog Days.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, and shrugged his broad shoulders. “Didn’t feel like it at the time. It just felt like-” he paused, his forced smile faltering, “-anyway, I spent a lot of time studying. And training. And it was okay. It felt like what I should be doing, so when Nick came to me and told me I had to take some downtime, I didn’t want to. I wanted to keep working. Keep busy. You know?”
“Good,” Tony said. He brushed Steve’s shoulder one more time. “Have fun with the ladies,” he said, then he picked up his coffee and left.
Tony grinned and climbed on top of Steve to grab his tablet from Steve’s side of the bed.  He stayed there, perched on Steve’s lap, a knee on either side of his hips, tapping on the screen.  “They’re going to love us, baby, just wait and see.”
And Steve just stood there. Just stood there, staring after him, and thought of the two of them sitting across from each other in a restaurant, or wandering through the park with cups of coffee, talking, shoulders touching, hands touching every once in a while,
that I want more than to be alone with you.  If it were up to me, we would be alone every minute of every day for the rest of our lives.”
FRIDAY's voice cut through unexpectedly. “Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes has just arrived by foot on the compound. He appears to be heading for the front door.” She put video of his approach on the nearest screen.
The lights dimmed and the screen lit up. The picture was low quality, but if Steve didn't know better, he'd swear that was Bucky loading that bomb into that van. The investigator who did not, in fact, 'know better' announced that the person in the image had been identified as Bucky, i.e. the Winter Soldier.
Bucky looked Ross dead in the eyes for several long seconds while everyone watched nervously. Finally, he collected himself enough to slowly say, “Do. Not. Call. Me. The. Winter. Soldier.” He took a deep breath and huffed one last time, then turned to leave.
Finding the necessary key on the ring, Steve turned it into the lock and released Tony from the restraints. “Never a dull moment with you, Stark.”
“Duh.” Tony scoots closer and climbs right into Steve’s lap. He curls up against his chest and fits perfectly as he always does, like a key in a lock. “Anything for my favorite patient.”
Tony jumps a little at the sound of Steve’s voice, his hands immediately sliding over to cover whatever he’d been writing. “Hi, Steve! Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you and Clint were going to do some combat practice in the gym?”
At least he was off to a pretty good start. He managed to refrain from opening any bottles — despite being sorely tempted to do so — and he dug out a nice suit from the deep crevices of his cellar. True to his recollection, he was pretty sure this was the exact suit he wore on that dinner date with Miss Potts, but it still looked nice. Slightly dusty and baggy, but nice nonetheless. Maybe Steve was right, maybe he did need to eat more.
“How was I supposed to know he’d be here?” Piledriver complained as Steve effortlessly took his gun out of his hand and picked up Wrecker’s, too. “And that he’d be crazy enough to take all four of us on by himself!”
Steve snorted and shook his head. “Trust me, if I start yammerin’ with these ol’ pipes, people’ll think they slaughter the animals here, too.”
A part of Tony desperately wanted to say ‘no’ and run off, save himself from any inevitable embarrassment, but he nodded and reluctantly stepped inside.
Tony sighed; he wanted to lie, but even the idea of doing so just felt wrong. Not with how Steve was wearing his heart on his sleeve. Not with how Steve wanted him just like this -- open, ‘fancy’, and most of all, honest. He hadn’t been any of the three in so long, and here he was trying to do it all at once. It was a tall order, but for Steve, he was willing to try. For the first time since god knows when, he
Tony mirrored Steve’s bewildered expression. He looked down at his own suit and then at Steve, who was clad in his usual vest and old pants combination. “I dressed for dinner, isn’t that what we’re doing here?”
“Ah, of course, the classic 'Kiss and Make Up' treatment. A perfect prescription indeed, doctor.” Steve says, his smile growing wider as he meets Tony's gaze. “I love you, Tony.”
“Trust me, he sounds the same, and he’s hardly great. Mediocre, at best,” Tony said, also leaning in and further closing the gap between them. Probably not the smartest thing to do in a small town like Timely where nothing was secret, but he couldn’t help himself. It was so relaxed in the cozy, quiet restaurant. Even quieter now that the only other patrons -- Carol and the feminists -- were walking out the door.
“Not mad at me anymore, right?” Steve eventually asks after a comfortable, serene silence. It’s probably a stupid question, but he wants to be sure. Tony being mad at him, even when it's over trivial things, is a serious manner!
“It’s alright, you don’t have to play dumb. You have every right to be upset with me.” Steve clenches his jaw and looks up, forcing himself to meet Tony’s brilliant blues. “Today is our special day, and I have no idea what it is.”
“No, no, I mean it. No more cuddles until you tell me what’s wrong,” Steve says with a touch more finality in his voice. He makes a move as if he’s going to get off the bed, but Tony grabs him by the waist before he can.
“Already did. But it’s Clint, meaning I had him pinned in a whopping five minutes,” Steve says, chuckling.
It’s a terrible sentence, something that Steve never wants to hear from anyone, but especially not his husband. His heart halts for a split-second, he gulps, and his mind frantically tries to recall anything that he could have done or said to trigger this.
“Really?” Steve asked, sitting more upright. “You do it just for my attention? I…didn’t think I was worth such a fuss.”
is where all the money is?” He turned to his cohort in the red mask. “I thought you scoped the place out!”
The darkest eight and a half minutes of his life (or at least his week) are over, the world is spinning once again, and all is as it should be. Because Tony isn't upset anymore.
“Well, that’s easy to do, seeing as he’s quite the charmer,” Steve said, leaning in a bit closer. “And I bet he’s a great singer, too.”
Now desserts are far from uncommon to find in the fridge at Avengers Mansion. Jarvis did serve the most wonderful treats after dinner each night, yes, but for whatever reason, cake remains something for celebrations exclusively. Birthdays, parties, anniversaries, the usual thing. The cake is not just here on a whim — there’s some bigger purpose for it. But what could it be?
Upon realizing he’d been unarmed, the robber panicked and threw his hands up. “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot!”
“We certainly are,” Steve said. “I reckon we just have different definitions of ‘dressing for dinner’.”
Steve chuckles before he leans in and kisses him, soft and sweet. He feels light and blissful, and really, how could he not be?
Tony took a big gulp of his sarsaparilla once the waiter brought it over, trying to drown out the dry lump that had formed in the back of his throat.
Tony smiles, big and bright. He laces their fingers together, the two wedding bands brushing up against one another. “I’m holding you to that.”
“I was feeling benevolent this morning, what can I say?” Steve moves closer and tries to catch a glance at what Tony’s hiding. “What are you working on?”
“Well, it'd been well over a day since I saw you and, uh, that’s just far too long if you ask me,” Tony rambled quickly, hoping that maybe Steve won’t be able to hear him and his shame if he talked fast. “You always come when I get myself in trouble, so I went ahead and found some. And well, you did.”
Tony placed his hand over his heart. “On my honor.” He leaned back, folding his arms and grinning from ear to ear. For some time now, he was convinced that fun could only be found in the bottom of the bottle, but here he was smiling, laughing, and having the time of his life.
“Like we even can move!” Thunderball complained as he clutched his bloody hand, Bulldozer still lying unconscious beside him.
Tony shrugged his shoulders as much as the barracks would allow. “Lost my footing and fell into it.”
Tony stood upright, rubbing at his now slightly reddened wrists. “I like to keep your days interestin’ in such a small uneventful town, Sheriff. Someone’s gotta!” He chirped, grinning up at Steve. “I suppose I owe you a proper thanks for always coming to my rescue like this. What say we get a drink to celebrate your noble heroism?”
Yes, yes, just like that! Strong, but with that subtle gentleness to it. Absolute perfection, much like the man himself.
Tony is sitting at his desk, nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that he doesn’t look stressed. He’s not talking on his phone, nor is it ringing incessantly. He’s writing something slowly and delicately, a stark contrast from the rapid, scribbly way he usually writes for work-related papers.
“Nothing important. Just Stark Industries stuff,” Tony says, and even though Steve might be an awful liar, Tony is an even worse one. Well, in this moment, at least.
“Uh, no, just thirsty.” Steve reaches for the carton of milk that he’d been after in the first place. He pours a glass and returns the carton once he’s done, eying that mysterious cake again. “Jarvis, can I ask you kind of a strange question?”
Sighing, Tony looked over to the table across the way where their server was still hiding and shaking.
He wasn’t sure how much exactly Steve knew about his past history with producing and designing weapons -- and the unfortunate aftermath of said weapons being used in practice. But the look Steve was giving suggested understanding and compassion, his face warm and illuminated by the low, warm light of the candle between them.
Now Steve wasn’t exactly a masterful showman; his singing was quite pitchy, and he really couldn’t hold a tune at all. But he was looking up at Tony with that big, genuine smile of his, that hopeful little spark in his eyes. It was more than enough to get Tony’s heart and legs racing as he ran down the stairs to join him.
“Let’s keep it that way,” Steve said, clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder as he walked past him. “And let’s hope that you actually remember what you agreed to come sundown I'll see you then.”
The bigger of the two lackeys snickered. “Are you as dumb as you look, boy? We’re the ones with the guns here!”
Steve sighs, sliding Tony’s hand off his side. “It’s just a tiny little cut, honey. I get them all the time on missions! And you know they heal fast thanks to the serum. It was way bigger yesterday.”
Inside the was practically empty, save for a server who was talking with the chef, and one table occupied by Carol Danvers and her feminists, seemingly celebrating whatever latest triumph they had over the chauvinistic males of the town. Carol didn’t seem to notice -- or didn’t care to notice -- Tony and Steve as they entered.
“...oh Danny boy, I love you so,” Steve sang softly in Tony’s ear, concluding his little song. He rested his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling back to look at him. “Told you I’m nowhere near as good as you.”
Tony rolls his eyes affectionately and shakes his head. “No, no, once again your sweet-talking prevailed. I’m still putting a bandage on that thing. A big one.”
“For cryin’ out loud, Thunderball, get up!” Wrecker ordered. “And Bulldozer, you coward, get your damn gun back from this amateur slinger!”
"Thank you..." Steve chokes out a small sob and clings to him. “I can’t believe I forgot about it, left it unnoticed for all of these years," He laments, his voice sounding guilty. "But you, you’ve been celebrating it, celebrating me on this day for years, and I didn’t even notice…”
Tony breathed out a laugh. “Hey now, this time you came on your own accord.” He tightened his hold around Steve’s frame, nestling his face against his shoulder. “Any chance I can convince you to sing another song for me?”
“I saw the cake in the fridge.” Steve wipes away the few years in his eyes, his lips curling up into a fond smile. “And I asked Jarvis, and he told me that he makes one for you every year.”
“Those are all for you,” Tony chimed in before the server could explain. He pointed at the largest fork. “This one right here is your dinner fork. It’s for your meats and whatnot. That smaller one is your dessert fork. The larger knife is for steak, and the one on the small plate is for butter. And regarding spoons, this one is for soups--” Tony leaned over and pointed at it. “--and the other one is for tea.”
Finishing up his milk, he thanks Jarvis and slips out of the kitchen, swiftly making his way down to Tony’s office. True to Jarvis’ word, the door is open, but Steve doesn’t immediately enter. He lingers in the hallway, concealed by the dark shadows which allow him to watch his boyfriend for a moment.
For most people, this would be an easy feat, but Tony couldn’t recall the last time he’d been sober in public, nor could he remember the last time he’d been out for a proper meal with someone. God, it must’ve have been with Miss Potts during the war. Well over a decade ago. And now here he was about to do the two of them together -- with Steve! Has he ever been sober around Steve? He didn’t think so. What if he went and said something stupid or foolish? He couldn’t blame it on too much whiskey! And saying one wrong thing could cost him everything he had with Steve.
“Outed by the butler, classic.” Tony’s cheeks flush red and he looks down at his well-polished loafers. “I’m sorry, you probably think it’s strange that I celebrate this without you. And for seven years, too. I wanted to invite you, but there was the whole secret identity thing for awhile, and then I was worried you’d think it was super weird since we weren’t dating, so I was planning on telling you this yea-“
Throwing the covers aside, Tony clamored to his feet and scurried across the room. He pulled back the curtains and his breath hitched, looking down to see his desired fantasy, now a beautiful reality.
“Of course it is.” Steve takes Tony’s hand — the one with his wedding ring on it — and traces over the bright gold band delicately. “That’s a promise that I’ll always keep.”
“Well I’ll be damned, you remembered!” Steve looked Tony over, a confused look on his face. “At least I
“I think you must be mistaken.” Steve clenched his fist and swiftly punched Bulldozer, knocking him to the ground beside Thunderball. “Because I am
It wasn’t one that he was certain he could keep, because he was still sipping his sarsaparilla and wishing it whiskey, but as he looked into those hopeful blue eyes, he found a desire even more worthwhile.
Not wanting to alarm poor Jarvis anymore, Steve feigns a smile. “Oh, right! The date must’ve snuck up on me. Do me a favor, don’t let Tony know about my little slip-up?”
He’s still cuddling up against Steve, still clinging with that iron grip of his -- if anything, he’s holding on tighter than he was before -- and he’s still pressing sweet, loving kisses to his neck.
“‘Course you are,” Tony insisted. “I’d stay in a jail cell all day if it mean I got to be near you.”
"Mad?” He asks, trying to keep his voice as even and neutral as possible. “How could you possibly be mad at me when I wasn't even here? There were no boots left in the middle of the bedroom for you to trip over!”
“What about it?” Steve asks, blinking down at the tiny, barely even visible wound. He forgot it was even there until this moment, and he wonders how Tony even knows about it in the first place. Then again, Tony always knows everything and anything, so really, he shouldn't be surprised.
“You got hurt, Steve, that’s a very big deal!” Tony’s voice cracks a little as he speaks, a sharpness in his tone that’s undeniable. It's not coming from a place of bitterness, but one of genuine hurt. This is not just a case of his husband overreacting -- Tony truly is upset about this.
“Come on, Tony, even if you’re not as ‘fancy’ as you used to be, I know you’re not as dumb as you let on. I reckon you’re the smartest feller this side of the Mississippi. Even if you do hit the bottle too hard for my likin',” Steve said earnestly, and Tony’s cheeks flushed red. “So tell me the truth -- why’d you
“Hi, Steve.” Her eyes shifted to the bartender. Under the force of her look, the kid relaxed, the tense set of his shoulders eased. She leaned on the bar and beckoned him forward. The kid was helpless not to come near. “Do you know who this is?” Natasha asked, voice low.
Next chapter on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I'm almost finished writing.  I'll probably have it done by Friday. Hopefully fully edited and posted by Saturday. We'll see.
--but went slowly in deference to his still-queasy stomach.  “I don’t know.  It’s been awhile.  I don’t think I’m quite ready to suit up again.”
“I mean, I could strip down to ass-crack cut-off jeans and a wet t-shirt if you wanted to do a car wash or something like they do in the movies,” Tony offered, and both Ray and Jeff cackled.  “
Natasha moved closer until she was pressed against his side, her head on his chest.  He put his arms around her and kissed the top of her head, the sweet fragrance of her shampoo filling his nose.
“Which one is it?” Bucky went on. “No, don’t tell me. The one currently getting groomed like a cat, right?”
to keep him. For as long as Tony wanted him--until Tony saw fit to dismiss him--he would be here, and cherish every single second Tony allowed him to have. And when Tony
Steve put the thought of that right out of his head.  He was feeling bad enough without a raging hard-on complicating things even more.
“I am so glad you asked,” he said.  And he looked it.  In fact, he looked like Christmas had come early and Santa had been very generous.  He leaned forward in his seat, folding his hands on the table-top.  “It was Helmut Zemo,” he said.  “Your old friend.”
Steve got to his feet and looked at the guard.  He had put some more weight back on.  He wasn’t back to the 200 pounds he had been, but he was almost there.  180 now.  All good, hard muscle, and when he stood, the guard stood a little taller, as well.  Steve didn’t know if it was consideration or compensation.  He supposed, in the end, it didn’t really matter.  But he didn’t like this.  It was wrong.  Not once since he’d been brought here, had someone called him “Captain”.  Not once, had someone called him “Sir”.
Steve laughed deep in his throat, and Tony’s heart beat just a bit harder at the sensation of Steve’s lips brushing against the sensitive skin of his palm. And his eyes--that impossible blue of the ocean--and who the
When he came back to the table, Steve had it mostly cleaned up and looked more in control.  Tony helped him finish up.
Nat and Steve went to pick up the cake.  As it turned out, not only was he a bad-ass bowler, but Tony’s friend Jeff was an even more bad-ass baker.  He’d done cakes for half the town and was thrilled to do this one too.
Tony laughed softly.  “If the shoe fits, baby.”  He ran a finger over Steve’s jaw.  “Now, I want you to do something else.”
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing.  I just don’t see you with kids much.  It’s nice.  You’re good with them.”
Silk wrapped around his hand. Tight but not too tight. Just right. Just enough to let him know it was still there. “Thank you."
Tony smoothed his hands over his thighs, kneaded the muscles there, then maneuvered his way down the bed so he could touch Steve’s calves, reassuring himself they were there and whole. When he got to his feet, he glanced back up into his eyes. “You’re still wearing boots,” he said.
Steve indulged him a little longer, then pulled away.  He sat up, straddling Tony’s hips, and pulled his own shirt off.  Tony reached up and ran his fingers over the hard abdominals.  “God, you’re perfect,” he whispered.  And he was.  The lamplight burnished his skin in gold.
Tony surged forward and kissed him.  The table was in the way, and then it wasn’t.  Steve broke away long enough to send the table flying with a shove--
Steve shrugged, but he was smiling. “It’s nothing. Just stew. My mom used to make it when it started to get colder. Sometimes when I’d come home from school she’d be in the kitchen, and have me come in and help her cut vegetables and stuff. We’d sit at the counter while it cooked and she’d read and I’d do my homework, and then when Dad got home, he’d get bowls out of the cupboard and we’d sit there at the kitchen counter and eat together.” He shrugged again, and the look on his face made Tony feel like crying. He had never seen Steve look even marginally happy when he spoke about his parents. Now, his eyes were far away and soft, and thanks to some strange alchemy, Tony’s nerves and fear about their future--
Steve turned his face away from the offending light, but untangled his hand from Tony’s shirt and patted his leg with it.  It felt like an awkward, silly thing to do, but if Tony had a problem with awkward and silly, he would have left him by now.
Tony pulled him closer, relishing the smooth skin of Steve’s bare shoulder. He stretched up and put his mouth next to his ear. “I’m strongly considering kissing you,” he said. “What are your thoughts on that?”
“Stark,” Strange said, and Tony pulled out of Steve’s arms.  He kissed him one more time, not lingering, but putting every ounce of his love into it.  And Steve did the same.  Tony felt it.  He took it and put it in his pocket like a physical thing.  Another one of those things he could take out and look at when the world was cold.  He touched Steve’s face one more time, mouthed
Tony sighed and rubbed his eyes. Who was he kidding? He missed him. It had been eleven days. Eleven days since they’d said more than two words to each other. Eleven days, and he
It was slow and gentle but extremely thorough, his mouth warm, his tongue soft.  This was what Steve had been born for, what he’d went into the ice for, and why he’d come back out again, for this shared breath, this warm, wonderful person in his arms.  It was everything he had dreamed of, but this was better because it was real this time.
Tony thought of that now, lying next to him, slowly kissing him, how big he’d seemed in the face of a pissant Nazi-wannabe, yet so small when he’d sat, chastened, next to Bruce in the booth.  How menacing, how sweet, how proper, how passionate.  He was a study in duality, this man of his.  And he was his.  The thought made Tony burst with a happiness that was so encompassing it was almost scary.
He poured another cup of coffee and drank it down. By the time it was gone, he could hear movement in the bedroom. Tony had taken his suit coat off and hung it on the back of the chair. He took his tie off now too, and put it on top of the coat, then went back down the hallway.
with one--but he wanted to get it. He felt like he’d earned the right to it, and he wanted to get it, but when it came right down to it, he was actually pretty content with his situation the way it was. He
Steve thought back to his first time shipping out. How he’d felt saying goodbye to Sarah and Sam at the bus station. He nodded. “Yeah. I do know.”
Steve looked back at Morgan, reached back to brush his finger over her smooth cheek again, then went to Tony’s side. He put his hand on his hip. Touched his bottom lip. “There’s that pouty lip again,” he murmured.
Tony breathed out a laugh of his own, then twisted in Steve’s arms so he could face him. Steve let his head rest on the pillow and smiled at him. Just a little. Just a tiny one, but it was filled with a warmth that Tony hadn’t thought possible in a moment like this. A moment where they were essentially breaking up--again. Tony touched his mouth with one finger, traced his lips, then ran up through his hair. Steve just stayed silent, watching him, that little smile on his face.
Tony seemed to realize how pissed off he was, and moved closer.  "Come on, baby," he said. "Don't be like that." He kissed his neck, thumbed his nipple just the way Steve liked.  "I think it's sexy."
Nat looked at him sympathetically.  “Oh, Steve,” she said.  “Honey, she’s probably just looking at your clothes.”
Steve stopped talking, and dropped his head into his hands again.  He was holding on, but just barely.  Tony could see that, and it was only the knowledge that he’d never be able to come back that stopped him from simply gathering Steve up in his arms.  Instead, he clenched his hands together in a tight fist.  His knuckles turned white immediately with the force of it.
Steve bit his lip and stood up straight. He’d been leaning casually against the railing, but those words put him on alert. The thought of Tony’s bright eyes and flirtatious little laugh went through his head like a soft breeze. “Whose is he then?”
Tony pet Sir Purr, his eyes on Steve’s back.  “Hey,” he said lightly, “you should call Bucky.  Invite him up again for the weekend.”
Steve went back to the base and spoke to his commanding officer. He requested and was approved for emergency leave, and for the first time in nearly a decade, he was back home for longer than four days at a stretch.
Tony lowered his head, clutching at his own fleeting sanity even as he felt it slipping through his fingers.  Had he thought Steve was stubborn?  This was so much more than that.  This was willful denial.
She stepped forward, letting go of Tony’s hand and looking shyly up at Steve. “Can-” she began, then paused, and started again. “
Steve laughed a little and kissed his shoulder. “Better be careful, saying stuff like that,” he said. “I might get used to it, and then where would we be?”
“What has gotten into you?” Tony asked.  He didn’t know whether he felt more exasperated or turned on.  It was sixes, really.  He’d be leaving here frustrated no matter what.
Tony didn’t say anything.  He just came down the steps and fell into warm, friendly arms.  Rhodey caught him.  He was good like that.
Across the room, just like in an old movie, their eyes met. Tony’s dark whiskey brown, Steve’s cool ocean blue. And then there was no sound in his ears. No breath in his lungs. Suddenly there was no one else in the world except Steve and Tony. Tony and Steve. Everything else fell away, especially when the corner of Tony’s bow-shaped lips lifted in a tiny half-smile. When that happened, Steve didn’t feel like just some guy. When that happened, he felt…
“No,” Steve answered, troubled.  “No, but knowing it and...you know...having it happen for real are two different things.”
“Whatever you say,” Tony said.  He settled his hand on Steve’s cheek, feeling the beard and wishing selfishly that he was feeling Steve’s smooth skin under his palm instead.  “I’ve grown very accustomed to having you around, Steve Rogers.  I don’t think I can do it without you now.”  Tony slid his fingers into Steve’s hair and tugged it affectionately.  “And I know I don’t want to.”
But he was here. He might suck, but he was here. Waiting. Watching for Tony, watching for Morgan, wishing to god he had brought Dodger, because even if Tony
It rang once--just once--and then a voice said, “Hello?” and his heart stopped. Because it wasn’t Tony. Not even close. It was a woman. “Hello?” she repeated.
. He felt it overwhelming him every second of every day, and double that amount whenever he was in Tony’s arms, and if Tony felt even a fraction of that, then Steve would count himself the luckiest man in the entire universe.
“Good,” Tony said, then sighed. “Why’d you have to get me thinking about Colonel Sanders? Now I want chicken. FRIDAY, order in some KFC, okay?” He started away, back toward the party, back toward Pepper, then turned back. “Oh, and seriously, Cap? Cuddling lessons. Think about it.”
He hadn’t known what those last words had meant.  Not until now.  Not until Steve said them again now, here, in plain old English, his lips, his tongue, things that had given Tony so much love, so much pleasure, now spilling forth words that were as sharp and deadly as the razor he had once wielded.  Tony put his hands over his ears and rocked himself.  It was too little too late.  The damage was already done.
“Paprikash,” Wanda said, coming into the room. Her red hair was held back in a loose ponytail, and she came toward them, untying the dishcloth she was using as a make-shift apron from around her waist. “You must be
She nodded.  “Fine.  I’ll take the blame.  Put that on our bill, will you?” she called to the waitress.
Slowly, reverently, Tony ran his hand over Steve’s chest.  The smooth skin, the hard muscle beneath.  There were no scars, no cuts or scrapes, no marks at all, just pure alabaster perfection, like marble warmed in the Italian sun.
Tony eased himself back down onto Steve’s chest. He turned his head and kissed him over his heart, ran his hands over his body with lazy, languid motions. “You’re going to think about it too, right?” he asked, toying with the smooth cup of Steve’s ear.
Steve smiled, not feeling a bit strange about talking to her, even after Ultron.  Feeling, in fact, gratified by the hint of approval in her voice.
Steve was silent.  He just curled tighter.  Tony laid a hand on his shoulder and he flinched, muscles jumping.
Steve raised his hands.  The shackles around them jangled.  “Right now, I want these off.  Then we can talk about the rest.”
A feeling of utter shock ran through him, and then she was giggling, more like a child than ever.  He shoved her lightly with his shoulder.  “Nope, no way are you staying here now,” he said in mock-anger.  “Go back to your own room, traitor.”
Why would he? It wasn’t exactly like they moved in the same circles. Steve was a soldier. A military-man through and through. He lived on the base ninety-percent of the time, and when he wasn’t there, yelling at recruits for untucked shirts and wrinkled sheets, he was either at his mother’s house or Pietro’s.
Nat reached into the top of her dress, smiling a little when Steve looked pointedly away. She pulled a twenty from her cleavage, finished off her drink at a swallow, and left the money underneath the glass.
