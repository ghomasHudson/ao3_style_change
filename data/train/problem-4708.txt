“Tony…” Steve exhales, head swaying back and forth a few times. Tony plasters on a plastic smile, gestures to the glass doors.
Steve doesn’t have anyone to talk about this with, really. He can’t talk to Bruce about it, or Pepper, or JARVIS. He certainly can’t talk to Natasha; she and Tony have history, and it would be the epitome of foolishness to betray his trust that way.
“I’m all dressed and I haven’t eaten,” Tony said, but he was already backing up, back towards the elevator.
“What,” Tony says, trying for levity, “the genocide or the loneliness?” Loki’s expression shifts through surprise, outrage, and amusement before finally settling on wry and chiding. Tony points past him, and Loki raises an eyebrow and tilts so that Tony can pass. Their noses are almost touching as Tony edges by him, and he fights the impulse to lean in, to let Loki push him back against the wall and take.
Tony’s eyes shock open. His back arches, his whole body shaking as he comes all over his own stomach, his chest, pooling in his collarbone-
Steve can feel his heart cracking in his chest. It’s a familiar pain by now. He closes his eyes, takes a breath. He lets it all out. “I’m still learning how to be a good friend to Tony,” he tells Hulk, smiling sheepishly up at him. “Bruce is, too. Isn’t that why they fought?”
Ugh this was a longer chapter than I expected. I had to get through so much, and Loki didn’t even get to really come back yet! Tbh there’s like three more scenes left in this one Friday alone, but we’re already at 13k for this one chapter and I couldn’t just leave it all together.
“Alright,” Tony said, and tossing the towel on the bench. He picked up his mouthguard with two nimble fingers. “Hit me, Cap.”
CW: for major discussions of sexual assault. r word is used. then there's some explicit make-up sex. stay safe y'all.
“I’m sure.” He turns back to Steve, who is glancing between them with an expression of abject horror and embarrassment on his face. Tony spares Loki a speaking look. “Uh. I think Rhodey can handle the return trip. Why don’t you get some rest?”
Tony throws his hands up in the air, eyes rolling, and Steve lets out a silent breath of relief. He’s broken the cold, deadly mask he’d been wearing, exchanging it for exasperated fury. This Tony, Steve knows, is much more manageable. This Tony just wants everyone to understand how mad he is. This Tony doesn’t need to make it hurt.
I spent way too long trying to format the epigraph for this chapter and it's still not right I give up just go read the actual poem guys it's good I promise.
“Did you know,” Tony asks, because he can’t quite stop himself, “that about 60% of the 500 million or so neurons an octopus has are in their tentacles?”
Instead, Tony huffs a rough laugh. It’s wet, clicking terribly in his throat, and Steve closes his eyes and tries to pretend it’s just the shower steam.
“Not so,” JARVIS disputed. “His instincts branded her as a child of his pack, just as she claimed. She was someone to be protected.”
He takes a sip of coffee as he assesses the shifty expressions on his teammates’ faces. “Am I fired?”
“I’m sorry, sweetheart,” Tony cooed, pressing a soft kiss behind his ear. Steve arched against him slightly, and Tony let out a low hissing breath. “Fuck. I really have to go.”
“Yeah, probably,” Steve sighs, pulling off his pants, but he’s pretty sure he already gets the joke.
“Does this mean that you are only bound to your interpretation of a promise?” Tony demands. “If you don’t deem something as harm, it doesn’t matter? What’s harm? Is death harm? What if you hobble me so that I can’t walk? Is it not harm because I have access to prosthetics that can circumvent paralysis?”
“You’ll be awake soon, Steve,” Hank reassures him. He opens up the cryochamber, reaches down to gently touch the skin at the side of Steve’s neck with one large blue hand. “We’ll be monitoring your vitals.”
He walks all the way down Fifth, the familiar feet of the Empire State Building a welcome sight, and then the Flatiron rising up to meet him. He walks through the arch at Washington Square park, moving through the clouds of smoke and carousing co-eds, drugs and laughter around the fountain, walks all the way to Canal Street and through the neon lights of Chinatown as the restaurants close up shop. He walks right up to the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, then stops, those wooden planks stacked in a line as far as he can see, the familiar cables stretching up into the starless sky. It’s midnight. A couple walks towards him, hands linked, shoulders touching. A Korean tourist heads off towards the centre of the bridge with a telephoto.
After it was done, Steve roused sometime in the mid-morning to find Tony staring down at him as though he were a stranger. His face was slack, eyes roving wildly over Steve’s face as he sat up beside him in bed, one leg folded underneath him, the other foot planted on the floor. His hair was wet from a shower, and he’d put on a pair of cotton sleep pants. He looked like a Roman statue, golden muscles and shadows cut sharp by the full force of the sun, and Steve smiled up at him with contentment and joy before he registered Tony’s unnatural stillness. Tony wasn’t touching him, either, which was strange, just watching with that same indecipherable look on his face. He didn’t even react to Steve’s questioning hum, a small sound in his sore throat as he stretched out a hand towards Tony’s face.
“I don’t care about the greater good, Captain.” Steve stops talking, mostly because he has no idea how to respond to that statement. “I care about Tony, and this company, and myself, and my career. I care about being the top CEO in the country and one of ten––counting generously––female CEOs at my level in the world. I care about being the absolute best at what I do, and taking care of the small handful of people I count as my family. I like nice things, and efficiency, and accolades. Tony would be just as happy living grease-stained in a workshop with his armour for the rest of his life. He would be fine if he never had to put on a bespoke Tom Ford ever again. He wants to save the world, and help people, and make amazing things, and I’m not opposed to that. But I also think that Tony Stark’s brain is far too valuable to waste flying around in a steel trap getting shot at when a few hours of sleep-deprived manic engineering can produce medical technology that revolutionises the field the world over. I wish that the cover story that SHIELD had produced was true. I wish that he paid someone to go out there and fly around and fight bad guys in some delusion of heroism. I think being Iron Man is a colossal waste of both his time and potential.”
Bruce sighed and patted Steve awkwardly on the shoulder. It was the first time anyone had touched him in days, and the contact was startling. The warm imprint left by his hand resonated through Steve’s body: an echoic wave of simple camaraderie that let him breathe for what felt like the first time since he’d stepped into the tower.
Tony breathes slow. He closes his eyes. “You…you might wanna get out of here. If you’re here. Go…wherever it is you go.” He laughs, softly. “Or maybe not.”
Tony licks his lips and steps into the shower, pulling the glass closed behind him as a clear barrier between them. The water is hot enough to redden his skin, dried blood swirling around the drain as he tips his head under the rush of the waterfall spout. He closes his eyes and lets the water run over them.
“I never thought I’d say this, but Loki’s sneaking around is kind of nice if this is what sleeping with Steve is like,” Tony says petulantly. He rolls to the edge of the bed and sits up with a jaw-cracking yawn. “I don’t know when the last time I saw dawn from this side was, but I don’t like it.”
“Do you have a better name?” Tony asks, pouring himself a few fingers of Suntory Hibiki and dropping an ice ball into his glass. “Come on, honeybunch. Where’s Hasegawa.”
Steve rocked his hips back, panting. He wanted. He wanted so badly, so much he could feel it in the marrow of him. He wanted Tony’s hands on him, his mouth, his fingers, his cock. He wanted him. He wanted to be claimed.
Cap doesn’t say anything, and Tony sets his jaw. “Alright. So why are you coming with me, when this is some sort of a trap she’s setting up for us?”
Steve stares at the door for another minute, hands tightening. He turns on his heel and heads for the elevator, then punches in the number for the garage. His reflection stares back at him in the polished metal walls, face distorted, repeated back and back out into infinity. When the doors slide open, the sight of the Softtail sits in his chest like a lead weight. He remembers Tony helping him fix it up after an unexpected firefight left some cosmetic damage, oil staining his hands, a bright grin on his face. He’d been introducing Steve to The Dirty Mac, explaining the concept of a supergroup. It was a good memory.
Pepper is sitting in the sunken living room, bare feet tucked up beneath her on the couch. Her stilettoes sit next to her on the floor. Tony pads out to meet her, glancing behind him to see if Loki’s following. He doesn’t make noise if he doesn’t want to, a trait that Tony is familiar with and dislikes in equal measure. He’s fully dressed now, wearing dark trousers of an indeterminate colour and a soft looking green shirt, and Tony idly wonders if he’s actually naked underneath glamour or if he can truly magic himself in and out of any garment as easy as breathing.
“I did mention it,” he said, and Steve swallowed at the considering timbre of his voice. He felt called out, somehow. A shadow passed over Tony’s face, then, and he took a deep breath. He set his glass down on the kitchen island, moving to put distance between them.
“Awesome,” Tony says, taking a deep breath. He taps his fingers on the reactor, trying to keep it together. “Do you have footage?”
“I told you,” Tony says, and the figure raises a long object with one arm, cylindrical. Steve sees the flash. “You’ll see-”
“If you need help, JARVIS is almost as good as I am,” Tony says, winking at the nearest security cam. “You know your way around. I’ll be back in a few.”
“Oh, no,” Tony says, laughing. He shakes his head. “I am not falling for that. I’m wearing dress shoes.”
Steve has never been very good at being afraid, or being patient, or knowing when to quit. So he sits in the Stark mansion, and he catalogues and annotates every damn item in the conference room, each with its tiny white sticker barcode or tag. And then, he sends Pepper Potts a note about charity auction procedure in the brand new world.
Loki pulls back, something complicated flitting over his face, and Tony rolls to kiss him. Loki hesitates before kissing back, deep and drugging.
Rogers pulled back from him, glancing towards the curtained windows, and Tony smiled reassuringly at him.
“Lucky I’m rich, then,” Tony said, and he was grinning now. “Not that you’re so destitute yourself there, Captain.”
“Tony, stop,” he grates out, but of course, Tony can’t hear him. Instead, Steve stumbles to his feet, trailing along behind Tony like a lurching zombie while the world spins dizzily around him. He is absurdly glad that he doesn’t really have a stomach to empty.
“Agreed,” Cap says, and Tony frowns at that. “This guy’s a one trick pony. JARVIS and I can handle him. Just get safe.”
“She called,” Sam says, fingers laced across his chest. “She says to tell you you’re being an idiot, and to go home and put out your damn fire before it’s too late and the choice is taken from you.” He squints at Steve. “You wanna tell me what’s going on? Should I be worried about this?”
“Of course, Captain.” JARVIS’ voice was unbearably kind, and Steve smoothed a hand over his face, through his hair. He took a deep breath, exhaled.
“Tony,” Steve sighs. They’re barely touching, now: just their hands, fingers lightly resting together in a cage of flesh and bone on the sheets between them. He strokes a careful thumb over Tony’s fingers.
“You know,” Tony says conversationally, heading for the door, “I have no idea if you’re shitting me or not with any of these answers.”
Before, he would have been delighted to know that his soulmate was a mad inventor. He’s always loved science-fiction and fantasy. Now, it’s just one more way that he’s not good enough.
“Well,” Clint says finally, slamming back his glass, “that’s some fucked up shit. And we haven’t even gotten to the mindfucking yet.”
Tony snorts. “So following that logic, we have a few days of shitty complicated feelings and sex and then I die tragically. Is that better?” Steve sits up, horror seeping into his mind as he remembers: Tony, bleeding out, Tony falling, Tony’s corpse lying dehydrated and lifeless in the sand. Tony ploughs on, oblivious. “Come on, you even saying that is proof that you’re not thinking straight.”
Steve nodded. “I’ll be fine. I think I was just feeling a little needy.” He smiled, licking his lips. “But I’m satisfied for now.”
“Deal,” Steve said, grinning. They made their way through the glimmering crowd, Steve’s eyes skimming over sequined mermaid-tail dresses and suits in bold, bright geometric prints. Bruce had gone for plain black, but Tony’s tailor had insisted that it was a crime to put Steve in anything but a beautiful, deep blue tux that made Steve think of storms and ocean water. He felt good in it, and he smoothed his fingers over one black silk lapel with a little smile. Tony would be proud, that Steve was finally getting used to being spoiled.
He drags Tony onto the empty court. The street is dark. It’s half gone midnight on Wednesday. The foot traffic is as minimal as it can get in Lower Manhattan, and Steve is deeply grateful for it, because he doesn’t want to share this moment with anyone. He watches Tony strip out of his suit jacket and hang it over a bench. He removes his cufflinks, tucks them into the inside pocket of his suit. He rolls his sleeves up to his elbows.
, Steve realises, Tony’s last hope. He’s sure both of them know it to be so. He wonders, maybe, if Tony was waiting for this. If that knowledge is what stayed his hand, stopped him from calling in the one person he always turns to when his indomitable brain finally hits a wall it cannot break.
Tony sucks in a breath. He swipes the back of one hand over his forehead, turns to see Steve's brows furrowed in worry. He remembers his promise, which he's already broken.
The thing was, Tony wanted to tell his traitorous mind, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses. Rogers was a stubborn man, hellaciously so if he’d got his teeth in something that he felt wasn’t right. They’d fought countless times: about the war, about Tony’s refusal to ever touch a gun again despite his sharp shooting, about how best to take care of the town. They’d fought about Tony’s drinking every single damn day since they’d met. Rogers could be a real clodhopper sometimes when it came to his civic duty, and Tony had told him again and again not to go rustling Roxxon’s men, fine good it had done him to run his trap. Rogers was crooked as a Virginia fence, which was why he’d rode off to Red River Pass all on his lonesome to go after a pack of bandits. He hadn’t even had the good sense to wait for Wilson to get back from settling a minor ranching dispute. He’d thought he could handle it, and truth to be told, so had the rest of Timely.
Steve stayed at the railing, sipping his coffee. Below him, on the landing pad, he could see evidence that Clint had been outside for his usual meditations; a few footprints in the thin layer of snow there, a spot on the edge where he’d crouched for long enough that the snow had melted in a small oval beneath him. The light in the communal kitchen spilled out onto the snow, and Steve wondered if Bruce was downstairs cooking something.
Reminder that the next work in this series will have a happy ending, even if this one doesn't! I promise it will all work out.
“No,” Tony says, shuddering. “The last time you and Clint ganged up on Thor, we had to open every window in the tower and a hazmat unit was deployed to his suite.”
"Captain Rogers is not getting a birthday present," she says, twisting her lips into something angry. "The nerve of him."
“Oh.” Steve takes a breath, a shaky smile making its way onto his face. “You’re not running away at all.”
“What the hell would you have done?” Tony demands, pulling back out of Steve’s grasp, and Steve snaps his mouth shut. He reaches out, slipping his arms back around Tony’s waist.
“I don’t deserve you,” Tony mutters. He can’t stop himself from saying it. The look Steve spares him as he climbs out of the tub, dripping wet, miles of pale skin like a Grecian statue-
Chewie in this relationship. I’m Han.” Tony’s back is tingling, a slow spread of gentle pins and needles. All the tension in him is melting away. “Also, what the fuck? Did you give me muscle relaxants?”
“Tony,” Steve hisses, caging Tony in with his body, and that’s really very nice. “Please tell me this isn’t just sex.”
Steve frowns. “Well, you were upset because I messed things up with Tony. And I appreciate that, really; he needs somebody to keep an eye on him, to look out for him. But Tony and I are…” He pauses. Surely, Tony had mentioned how things really were between them to Pepper. They’re close. He tells her almost everything. “Well, we still have some things to discuss between us. But I apologised. I’m…seeing a professional. To get back on track.”
"On the cheek." He pulls onto Grand Central, revving the engine a little for kicks as he merges smoothly into traffic. "Tell me flirting with a literal vengeful god who threw me out of the window of my own tower is a bad fucking plan."
“A less violent power struggle than I expected,” Tony admits, panting as Loki bends him in half and begins to fuck him in earnest. His teeth are sharp on Tony’s neck, leaving blooming bruises along his collarbones, the long tendons framing his throat. When he licks behind Tony’s ear, Tony melts completely into him with the rush of pleasure, and Loki’s chuckles and grazes the spot with his teeth.
Peter rolls his eyes. Then he unfolds himself with all the ease expected of Spiderman, and holds out a hand to Tony.
“I said no killing people we don’t like,” Tony says. His voice is strangely dead. It’s entirely devoid of emotion, in fact, which Steve knows from painful experience is never, ever a good thing. He stumbles quickly over to them, taking position naturally a half step behind, at Tony’s right.
He settles for pulling Tony down into his chest and pressing his mouth to the dark hair above his ear. He hugs him as tightly as he can without hurting him.
“If I tie you up, you’re not in charge,” Tony murmurs, and Steve nods. “I don’t have anything that could hold you, really.”
He was surprised that Steve hadn’t asked after Barnes, though, now that he thought about it. Maybe he was so focussed on Tony and his own health that it hadn’t occurred to him to worry? But no; Steve had been on a monomanic quest to recover Barnes for the past two years.
“He should go back. His references are good. He could get hired for any house or hotel, easy,” Tony said, an old argument, but Rogers just shook him.
It had taken him a long time to understand the modern approach to psychotherapy. When he was a kid, he’d been thought to be “nervous”. A side effect of the times, he knows now; he’d been sick, and so it must have been partially the fault of a weak mind. It had taken a thorough reading of the SHIELD manual and a lot of questions for the SHIELD-appointed doctor to really understand the new world’s view of “mental illness”. He’d learned a lot of things, actually, like the fact that asthma cigarettes are an oxymoron. In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, and objectively, he knows that it can only be good to treat people if they can get better.
“Do not die,” Loki says, simple, and Tony laughs. The jet lowers, slowly, passing through Loki’s portal without incident. War Machine follows it down.
Tony wheels back over to the helmet. “This is trashed, J. It’s not just the shell; the wiring is fried to shit. The display’s riddled with dead pixels.” He taps his fingers against his chin, thinking. “Can we retrofit fit the helmet from the Mark 49?”
“All right Evel Knievel, stop showing off and get your ass up here,” Clint says into the comms, and Tony powers up the thrusters accordingly, flying back up to the landing pad. He and Loki are standing shoulder to shoulder, arms crossed, and Tony takes a moment to appreciate how weird that is as he slows to a walking landing.
Xavier shrugs. “You make decisions such as these every single day. And they weigh on you, Captain. Each one is a stone around your neck.” He points at the building. “It is easy for us as so-called superheroes to say that no one life is worth more than another for the papers. But that’s not very true in real life. Most people would choose their loved ones over a stranger. That’s human nature.”
Tony hums. “Book it and then cancel within 24 hours. Not like I haven’t had to do that for work before.”
He gets as far as the emergency stairwell before he begins to feel…strained, maybe. His hands begin to glimmer before his eyes, like he’s losing the ability to hold his shape. He takes another step, testing, and his whole body shifts, nauseatingly, a ripple wave of terribleness that starts at his feet and rolls all the way up to his head.
He sets the wrench down, puts on a tired smile, turns around. Natasha is standing with her hands folded behind her back, expression flat neutral in the way that Tony has learned to be weary of. She’s dressed in comfortable blacks, her hair pulled up behind her head. She must have changed and come straight here from her flight.
“Pot n’ kettle, Spidey. Or was it another web-slinging hero who started at the ripe young age of 15?”
Steve takes a second to get his bearings. He’s completely disoriented, his mind still in a state of deep lassitude after taking the time to thoroughly explore Tony’s body until he’d begged. God, the man was unreal.
“Turns out the serum gives Cap resistance to some mind-altering effects,” Bruce had told him. “Wanda’s powers aren’t actually really telekinetic or telepathic in nature. She can- or. Uh. She
Romanov inclined her head. “I’m not pack leader material,” she deadpanned, and Stark turned to stare at her.
Spiderman stares at him for a long moment. Almost too long. It’s strange, to see him so still, and Steve resists the urge to fidget as the silence stretches out to awkward lengths. Tony, to his credit, simply meets his gaze calmly and waits.
It’s an invitation for a private after-hours viewing at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens for tomorrow night. Steve sits down on the couch next to the shield, holding the smooth paper between his hands and remembering the awkward small talk as they descended in the elevator, his throwaway comment about DC. But of course Tony was paying attention to that kind of thing; of course he was. Where Tony’s words were always designed to dazzle and amuse and confuse, Tony’s actions spoke for him. It was these small touches – the tech upgrades and the quiet hours spent playing videogames and the Tovaritch! left in front of a door after a rough week – that conveyed the truth of Tony’s psychology, his affection for the team. What Tony cannot say with words, he says with his hands.
His orgasm blindsided him, surging up and over his body, arching his spine, whiting out his vision until Steve couldn’t breathe. His fingers scrabbled at the pillows above him, one hand leaving what were sure to be a set of nasty nail marks and bruises over Tony’s shoulders. Tony was murmuring in his ear, invectives and sweet nothings and filthy praise that made him hot, and it felt like forever until the roaring in his ears died enough to parse them.
“No,” he says, quietly. “But make the usual inquiries, see if anyone really needs the money. Ask Denham first. His partner needed top surgery last time I saw him, and he’ll give you a straight answer about how everyone’s doing.”
, Tony. Good luck!” she sings, drawing out the words. Tony sighs, lifting a hand over his shoulder as he stands and walks back towards the door. “Tony.”
Tony pulls his shirt on and tugs the hem over his stomach, silent as he waits for the rest of it. He puts on his watch, turns back for a pair of socks. Loki is looking at his hands, clearly somewhere far away from here, and Tony wishes desperately that he had Steve’s ability to look invested and sympathetic at the overemotional drop of a hat.
“Brunch?” Tony asks, and Steve’s chest collapses, all the air rushing out of him at once. “Or not. Breathe, Rogers, Jesus.”
He and Tony had been playing basketball on the court across the street from the IFC. Steve had wanted to see Audiard’s
The door clicked shut behind him, and Steve stretched luxuriously before pulling the sheets over himself and snuggling into bed. He’d gone for an hour run and come four times. He’d earned a nap.
Bruce laughs, a nasty, bitter thing. It takes Tony aback a little; he forgets, sometimes, that Bruce is not nice. He is careful, because he is a loaded gun. He is polite and measured where Tony is rude and explosive, but that does not make him kind. It’s an easy mistake, and one he knows better than to make, but Bruce is so good at making himself disappear. He shrinks, until suddenly he can’t hide himself: supernova.
And that’s…unfortunately, the answer he should have been predicting. He shakes his head. “Yeah, it is,” he says. He swings a leg over his bike, adjusting the kick stand. “You know where to find us. And I’m here every Friday, for now.”
Steve glances back over his shoulder. Tony is still fast asleep, the wires still trailing from every square inch of his skull. He looks peaceful. Beautiful.
“My mom says that to me all the time,” Franklin says curiously. He steps further into the room, his little brows furrowed together in a line. “Are you alright? Are you going to faint?”
“It’s gone,” Peter says, after a few tense moments. Tony lets out a heavy breath. “You think it’s Steve.”
Tony isn't really sure. He'd meant for it to be a break-up, but he turned out to be pitifully weak to Steve's tears. He doesn't think Steve is going to give up so easily. They're on a break, but that's not a break-up.
“Yes,” Steve says simply, and Tony bites back a grin, a surge of warmth spilling into his chest and stomach. “I-
is unspoken, but sits on his face just as clear as if the words had been spoken. “JARVIS. JARVIS knows. JARVIS, was Bucky in the footage we watched together?”
“I don’t have a choice, do I?” he asks, colouring his voice with dry amusement because that’s what he needs to do right now; he needs to make a laughing spectacle of himself. He needs to be amused and amusing and steady.
“Which is so unusual and strange that it terrified me,” Pepper deadpans. She fetches up against her desk, folding her arms and eyeing Tony with suspicion. “This is about the last fight. Because you lost people.”
Jim laughs at that. He tips his head back, teeth gleaming in the light. It’s a true belly laugh, deep and good, and Steve basks in it. He’s always liked Jim, even if they aren’t close by any measure.
“Tony, stop,” Pepper pleads, smoothing her hands over his spine. “Stop it. Don’t do this to yourself.”
Steve closes his eyes and lets the rush take him back to his body. He doesn’t fancy letting Tony drag him back to the tower through the air.
It takes less than twenty four hours for Pepper to corner him, right after a meeting with the Amateur Astronomers’ Association of New York. Probably because he’s desperate enough to agree to a meeting with the Amateur Astronomers’ Association of New York. In his defence, they were surprisingly pretty awesome, but then they were nerds with telescopes dedicated to public education. That was kind of hard to hate, no matter how cynical of an asshole he was.
The smoke coils around the room, slowly, filling it up. When it hits Tony he expects something to happen, but nothing does. Tentatively, he pushes his hands into it, but it moves right through him. It’s like he’s not even there.
“We could put an SI float in the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade,” Pepper says, and Tony lets out a rough laugh. “I could put you in charge of something fun and creative and crazy. You like that.”
“Don’t,” Tony says, turning, then regrets it at the flash of something wary in Loki’s face. He rallies, feeling uncharacteristically awkward. “No, I mean, thank you for offering, really, but I kind of want to milk it.” He winks at Loki, who looks surprised. A bark of laughter breaks his face wide open, some of the tension leaving him, and Tony snickers with him, pleased to have avoided…whatever that was.
“Sure, but why trust books when I’ve got a primary source right here?” Tony says, and Steve quirks a tired smile. “How much do you know about the AIDS epidemic?”
He rests his head on his bent wrists, staring down at the floor between his knees. In the bathroom, he can hear Tony cleaning up his goatee, brushing his teeth, gargling. Finally, he steps out of the bathroom, and Steve keeps his eyes on the carpet. He knows well enough by now that it’s very likely that Tony isn’t wearing any clothes.
Tony turns over on his side, pillowing his head on his folded arm. He gives Steve his full attention. “Okay, Gloria Steinem, what am I getting here? A book report? A discussion group?” He wiggles his eyebrows. “You want a physical demonstration?”
Xavier smiles. “I want you to consider, Captain; every other member of your team grew up in a broken home. Most of them have been involved in the military or some sort of violence since childhood.”
Tony stared at him for a long while, then reached out slowly, as if to avoid spooking him. He took the very edge of the rolled-up towel with those graceful fingers of his, then stepped back again.
“I wish I’d been more understanding,” Tony confesses. Steve isn’t sure he even remembers he’s talking to Steve now. It’s almost like he’s just talking to get it out: excise this wound that lives inside of him, clearly still bleeding even after all these years. “I’m sure it took a lot for him to share that with me. Looking back, I can see that he was doing the best he could. He loved me in his own way.”
“You’re wrong,” Peter tells him. His voice is low and fierce, coiled tension in his body. “You’ll see. We’ll prove it.”
“I looked up ‘Hokusai tentacles’ while I was in the kitchen,” Steve confesses, and Tony pauses in his ministrations. “What I found was pretty illuminating. This is another one of those sex things I didn’t know about before we started dating, right?”
“You’re an asshole, Captain Avoidance!” Tony calls, but the video cuts out. He sighs and flops back down to the sofa.
“Like I got run over by a tank,” Steve says wryly, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. “Not mad at me anymore, huh?”
at. After messing up with Tony again and again, it was refreshing to just…follow his instincts, and get everything right. It’s a small triumph, but he feels like he knows who and where he is again.
“Yeah,” Steve says, voice hoarse. It’s more growl than word, but Tony lets it slide, just this once. “Can I…?”
“You will not!” Thor snarls, only to be stopped by the mysterious appearance of an uncomfortably familiar gag. He doesn’t even bother to fight with it, just glares murderously at an indifferent Loki.
So, as some of you have noticed, I’ve decided to cut the twins out of the picture for now. Why have I done this thing? Well, firstly, I found the relationship between Steve and Tony had frankly soured too much after Ultron for me to conceivably work with it, because Bruce is right when he chastises Cap in Age of Ultron; Steve trusts an unknown “enhanced” human who has demonstrated mind control powers and then – and this is the important bit for me – enacts violence upon Tony’s person, and Bruce, ***with her help***, after she made Bruce kill a shiteload of people. What? Was that not a red flag for anyone else? Secondly, it was just easier for plot manoeuvring, and you will find out why soon enough. Thirdly – and this is less about plot and more about my personal feelings now – I’m really just 100% not on board with the decision to make two characters that are canonically half-Jewish/half-Romani join the Nazis. As someone who is mixed myself, and grew up in a heavily Jewish city with a large proportion of Jewish friends, I’m just not. I was pissed that they did so when the news first came out, and I’m still kind of pissed about it now. So whatever characterisation of the twins that might be appearing or not appearing, it won’t be with the “we joined Hydra” backstory. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Sorry to any folks that liked angst and eyeliner Wanda. (Personally I like Ultimates’ mathematician Wanda better, but now I’m just being petty.) Feel free to disagree with my politics at great length and at your leisure, of course. All criticism welcomed.
Steve snaps his eyes back up to Tony, schooling his expression, but Tony isn’t looking at him. He’s straining, his biceps standing out in long, lean lines as he attacks the place where the armour’s thigh attaches to its groin with a small tool that doesn’t look like any sort of screwdriver Steve recognises. There are different words for each piece of armour, but Steve doesn’t know them.
Tony makes a face, thankful for the elevator ding. He waves a hand as he steps out and heads for the workshop stairs. “In my defence,” he says, “Pepper told me to. And anyway, ‘enemy’ is kind of harsh, don’t you think?”
Tony finishes dressing in silence. It hurts, but Steve doesn’t know what else to do. Tony’s never been able to hear him, even when they were touching. He’s pretty sure Tony hadn’t really been able to see him, either, or he wouldn’t have asked. Maybe a shadow, or an outline. A distortion in the air. Not enough for Tony to look at him and know who he was without asking.
“Thor’s my people!” Tony shouts, when it seems like Loki might tear his brother’s throat out, and Loki jerks as though yanked on a leash. His body twists strangely to the side, and then there’s no longer a man standing there. In its place is an enormous brown canid, something between a jackal and a wolf, lithe and dangerous.
Loki looks sad, and Tony brushes his teeth, waiting. He’s tired himself, but he has to take advantage while he can. Loki shuffles over to the tub, taking a seat on the edge and spreading the sheets around him regally, like a cloak or a fine gown.
They’ve never really done this before. Eaten together, knees almost touching. Haltingly, Steve tells him a little about his morning trip to a church he’d been to with his mom as a kid. His expression lights up as he speaks, in an endearing sort of way. Tony’s not religious, but Steve’s happiness is like sunlight. It leaves him feeling warm and strangely indolent.
Steve nodded, watching as Bruce pulled up the CCTV footage. He watched Williams charge the guy, pausing and zooming in on a blurry frame.
He thinks of Peggy, the riddle of her: strong alpha confidence stuffed into an omega’s soft, curved body. He remembers the horrific things the men used to say about her, the way it would make his fists clench so hard his nails cut into his palms. He thinks about Gilmore Hodge muttering: “Of course Rogers is panting after her—he’s basically an O, ‘course he wants a proper Bitch. He’s probably hoping Carter’s hiding a knot under her skirt.” He thinks of launching himself forward and punching the bastard so hard he fell back. The other men had crawled over each other to pull them apart, his knuckles split open and a black ring around his eye, Hodge’s nose crooked and gushing blood into his mouth. He thinks of how angry Peggy had been after: “I don’t need anyone to fight my battles for me, Rogers.” She hadn’t spoken to him for a whole week.
Anyway I am sorry. I hope you enjoyed. I will try to update in a not-terrible fashion now that I am a graduated individual (and presently unemployed while job hunting lmao). Also I have no beta so lmk if there's any issues! And as always, I really do appreciate any kind of feedback. <3
“Thank you,” Steve grates out. He opens his eyes, bright with moisture. A small, fragile smile curves his mouth into something Tony might actually like to kiss someday. “That was…” He swallows. “That was nice.”
. Tony almost wants to smile, despite himself. Here Steve is, calling his bluff. It's just for a little while, so he's not going to move out.
“I forced you!” Steve shouts, then covers his mouth with a hand. Tony tastes acid, throat tightening. “I, you weren’t in the suit, and I pushed you. Again. I just-…there’s something wrong with me, Amora-”
His first orgasm took him like a freight train, fast and loud and shaking with the force of it. He’d just been so wound up, and Tony was everything he needed, everything he’d been wanting for days. He buried his scream in the mattress because he couldn’t bite Tony in this position and he needed to bite down on something. Tony milked him aggressively through it, fingers thrusting brutally while his mouth made the most obscene noises licking up all the slick that spilled from between Steve’s thighs. When it became too much and Steve began to squirm away from overstimulation, Tony pulled them out, hooked his thumbs in, and spread him wide enough to press his tongue straight in. The shock of it made Steve scream, and then Tony was sucking and fucking into him and he was coming again, so fast on the heels of the last one that his muscles just gave out on him. He collapsed to the bed in a shivering wreck, but Tony just flipped him over like a hotcake and licked greedily at his cock, cleaning him up while Steve cried out and squirmed, overwhelmed. It was too much, but Tony wasn’t stopping, just lapping him up and growling low under his breath, like he was half out of his mind from wanting.
“I’m in charge, here! You’re not mission ready, this is literally a rescue mission and you’re the damsel-”
“Yeah. He gets overwhelmed by too much stimuli, so touching is a no. He might want to get out of his clothes, if it’s really bad.” Rhodey comes around Bruce’s other side, and now that Tony’s looking, he can see that Rhodey’s leg braces are much more advanced and organic than he’d expected. “You okay, man?”
“Tony, you are not at all squeamish about killing people that you feel are an unconscionable threat to your family, this country, or the world. Hasegawa was a threat to you, and you are our family.”
The laugh that emanates from the other side of the bed is rough, rumbling. “The only kind of military I feel like right now is a POW parched for water,” Steve deadpans, which, huh. Is actually pretty damn flattering. Steve lets out a heaving sigh. “Alright. Jeez, Tony.”
. The word spits in his mind like an angry, bitter thing. It hurts, to know that all he’d had to do, all this time, was let himself fall.
Below, he can see the wreckage left from their battle; a few crushed cars, police, a gathering crowd. He can track where the battle between Moonstone and Hulk must have spilled into the street, or perhaps it was Executioner. Thor hadn’t sounded regretful enough to blame himself, so it must have been Moonstone. He desperately hopes Bruce is faring alright alone in the jet.
“In that moment, some part of her came to me. I could see what she saw; eternity, stretching out before me and in every direction. I understood, finally.” He laughs, a melancholy sort of thing, then glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. He smiles at whatever he sees there, and Tony stays frozen as Loki looks away again, out over the city. “I had resented her, for some time, for not warning me of my fate. For allowing it to happen, or perhaps even encouraging it; it was she who granted me the throne, in Thor’s exile. But in that moment, I understood. It was like…” He pauses, eyes narrowing as he considers Tony, halfway to the armoire and held in place, lest he might break the spell of whatever this is. “It is like asking someone why they did not warn you of a crescendo in one of your metal songs.”
“Come up here,” he tells him, but Loki ignores him, sucking a biting kiss to Tony’s thigh then bending Tony’s legs backwards. Tony lets him, waving a hand at the drawer.
“Tony,” Cap says again, caught between bewildered and joyous, and Tony grins at him, still approaching like he’s dealing with a feral animal.
Steve shakes his head. In any other case, sure, he’d be overwhelmed. But today this is exactly what he wants. All of the people he loves looking at him,
“Well,” Tony said, gesturing upstairs to where Widow Barnes was watching over the floor with a shrewd eye, “the lovely ladies of our town are still working. The drinks are still pouring. The show must march on.”
There was something slimy and wet in Steve’s stomach, just waking up. He could feel it slithering inside of him, making its slow and steady way up into his throat. “No,” he choked, and it was like watching a tornado take a town. It was horrifying, but he couldn’t look away if he tried.
Steve turns, glancing over his shoulder at the shield propped up on the couch, shining and new as Tony always makes it look every time he takes it down to the workshop for “some love, come here you poor thing, what did the bad man do to you, tell me,” cooing and petting it like a mistreated child. He knows – as he knows most things these days, by repetition of scientist after expert telling him so – that the shield is relatively unbreakable. There is nothing that he could do to harm it, beyond ruining the fine coat of specially crafted, Stark-engineered paint.
“That’s good,” the professor says, smiling. “If that changes, please let me know. It was good that Stark had already provided you with so many of his coping mechanisms throughout your time working and living together. Good housekeeping and routine is a big part of recovery for someone like you.”
Steve sets a slow and steady pace, not soft, just deliberate. He’s pressing into Tony’s sweet spot every time, and nestled in together like this he can get pretty deep. Tony’s content to melt back into his arms and let him run the show. Steve’s callouses are just shy of too much on his cock, and Tony moans quietly under his ministrations, then louder, his noises increasing in volume with his pleasure. No one would ever call Tony quiet, in or out of bed.
Steve shut his eyes, shaking his head, and Tony sighed and wrapped his arms around his waist. His fingers slid under the back of Steve’s shirt, pressing into the dimples there. Tony had always loved those. He liked to press his nose into them, his thumbs when he was fucking Steve from behind.
“I’ll do it,” Steve heard himself call out, as if from very far away. A few people near him turned around, laughing. There were a few delighted claps, even as some employees looked genuinely put out. “I’m an Avenger.”
“It was after you died.” Tony pauses, and this time Steve mouths it along with him: “The time before. Obviously.”
“I hate feelings,” Tony says into the pillow, succinct and infuriated. “I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. What am I doing, JARVIS?”
“Touch me,” he gasped, pulling his mouth away with a filthy sound that went straight to Steve’s cock. Tony smiled, slipping his hands up Steve’s flank to thumb at his nipples. “
“Okay,” she says, “walk me through it. Something invisible. Something…undetectable, so that even Steve’s super-senses and your incredible brain didn’t catch it. Something intangible? Something with claws? Or a person, an assassin, with a sickle blade, that could cut Steve’s throat?”
“Friday is named after the goddess Frige, just as Thursday is Thor’s day,” JARVIS replies drolly. Tony processes this, then rests his head on the cool wooden shelving of his closet, staring down at a line of lovely bespoke shoes. He stares at them as though they hold the secret of the universe.
Thor turns to look down at his brother, then, face set in stern lines. “You are not an unspoiled maid on Thrimilci. Do not start a quarrel because you cannot be true to yourself. We are far too old for such games.”
“Morning Cap,” Clint called, not even turning around on the couch. On the television, four anthropomorphic turtles talked to a giant rat.
Peter wriggles, and Steve lets him go. He grins unrepentantly as Peter crosses his arms, awkward, then uncrosses them and scratches at the back of his head.
There’s a short pause, and yet somehow interminable considering it’s JARVIS. “I think you should attempt to mend fences with Ms. Potts, and then ask for her interpretation. As Sir’s last serious partner and arguably his closest friend, I think her opinion might better suit you.”
Steve had never been up to the Xavier Institute before, and was mostly familiar with it due to Avengers business. It was good for those in the superhero community to keep appraised of one another, after all, and he and Tony had been doing some good work forging a real international community before everything had blown up recently, both metaphorically and literally. The campus is as beautiful and green as it looks in the SHIELD files, complete with a few children tossing a Frisbee back and forth on the grass. The mansion is just as impressive in person as he’d expected it to be, and he walks up to the huge open doors with trepidation.
“Access granted,” JARVIS tells them. “Steven Grant Rogers, Codename Captain America. Anthony Edward Stark, Codename Iron-Man.”
Steve had left the tower, though, just as he’d promised. He’d gone down to D.C. to run an op with the STRIKE team. Apparently they’re down a man, Barton having taken off time to recover from the trauma of his brain being scrambled like an egg by Loki. Tony kind of envies him. The rational part of mind knows that sitting on a beach somewhere and not doing anything is the best way to send himself into a major depressive episode, but right now, all Tony wants to do is lie down and never get up again. Every part of him hurts, and not in a good way. He feels like he’s been run over by a truck.
“No hair colour change and facial mapping nets for you, huh?” Tony asks, and Natasha offers him a wry smile.
. We can direct the team. Anyway, I thought you guys were superheroes. You killed kind of a lot of people.”
is the scientifically accurate terminology for what we are. Scott constantly produces overwhelming concussive force from his eyes, and needs an assistive device to keep his power contained and continue his life as normal; to eat, or shower without living as a blind man. The only colours he’s seen since his sophomore year of high school are shades of red.”
, meaning foot. So the more accurate term is octopodes, from the Greek, not octopi, from the Latin.”
“You don’t agree?” Steve asks. JARVIS stares to demur, but Steve cuts him off with a wave. He tilts his head up to the kitchen camera, pointing a spoon at it. “You’re always real careful about how you phrase things, you know that?”
Steve doesn’t know whether to be embarrassed or resigned. “I’m not so good at talking,” he manages. Surely Tony’s noticed that by now.
Tony let out a whistling breath. “Think I’d have complained about your army ration palate all this time if I could have just done better myself?”
, he wants to know. They have, perhaps, become a little co-dependent through this experience. Steve thinks of himself as a relatively self-aware man. He knows that they’ll have work to do when he’s corporeal again.
“And yet I can’t go through a warzone without it,” he sighs. He steps back into the armour, hissing as the sharp edges of the broken plating score into his skin, notching the edge of his scapula. “Ow, fuck. Cap, you’re gonna come with me, yeah? Watch my back?”
“Found Rogers,” Tony grunted. The snow had begun to melt into his clothes after a few minutes of warmth, cold water slithering down his spine and tensing his muscles. “Injured on the pass road. He wasn’t even shivering. Didn’t have a damn coat.”
“Since Tony usually flies or drives himself,” Steve says, and Evan nods. “Well. I’ll admit, I’m just as happy taking the subway. But I’ll keep that in mind.” He studies Evan carefully. “You’ve been bored, huh?”
Loki flashes a feral grin as a dagger carves out a piece of fabric and flesh around Nat’s floating ribs, and Tony swallows thickly. “Um.”
(And no, I have not abandoned my Superhusbands/FrostIron fic for anyone wondering. That monster is still chugging away. It's just slow going right now.)
“No,” Clint says, flipping his dough over. It’s perfectly cream coloured, and perfectly flat. He brushes his hands together to displace some of the flour, then turns over his shoulder to fix him with a squinted eye. “You wanna talk about what’s happening with you and Cap?”
Steve doesn’t say anything, and Tony swallows. “Rhodey and I found out SHIELD used my and Eric Selvig’s tech in a brainwashing program, trying to contain enhanced supervillains in a fucked up Stepford-esque suburban town. That’s why we’ve seen this ridiculous uptick in small-time supervillainy. Fatal Attraction and Co. broke them out.”
The laugh that Clint looses is bitter. He pours himself another glass of Yamazaki, rubbing a hand over the back of his skull. “You don’t blame Loki for Amora?”
“Loki swore to me that he would not harm my people. The Avengers were included in that, and Thor is an Avenger.” Tony’s eyes are wide, almost crazy. “Everything, everything between us, all our plans, hinge on the fact that Thor told us that Asgardian mages have to keep their promises, and Loki just broke his word.”
Oh, Tony understands alright, but he doesn’t have to like it. This day is just getting worse and worse. “How hard do you want me to hit you?” Tony murmurs, dreading the next few minutes intensely, and is rewarded with Loki’s warm laughter.
“Does Tony need any other kind of medical attention?” Steve asked, stubborn. There was a telling pause.
“In truth, I do not know. There are others in the bloodline, but none that have been raised to be king as Loki and I were. They are valiant warriors, but they have not been trained in diplomacy or history, and the leaders of the other realms would not know them, would not have seen their mettle. It would be the same as my father appointing me to the throne all those years ago; I know now that younger, spirited, bloodthirsty version of me would make a poor king indeed.” He lets out a laughing breath, eyes glistening with something complicated and wet and hopeful all at once. “My brother may get his throne yet.”
Thor smiles and looks down at his hands. “You know that I thought Loki dead after he saved Jane on Svartálfaheimr, only for him to return and cause trouble again. Yet there seemed no plot in it, which was unlike him; only mischief, like that of when we were children.”
“I’ve got a weakness for rare and beautiful, what can I say,” Tony says, eyes dancing. “Why do you think I invited you assholes to live with me?”
“Oh, god,” Tony gasps, and his wrists are still caught. He’s pinned, helpless and desperate as Steve’s hands slide over his stomach, his back, the swell of his ass. “Gonna strip me right here, where anyone can walk in-”
It helped that Steve hadn’t had much time to explore as a child; being sick all the time and working whenever he was able didn’t leave much for exploration. He remembers the moment he went to the Met for the first time, alone and brimming with expectation. He’d already been in love with fine arts, but his first brush with the classics had left him a goner for anything else he might have dared to pursue. He can still feel the way his breath caught in his throat at the sight of smooth marble, of bone white fingers pressing into skin that dipped under pressure, supple as real flesh to the eye. He can remember his first encounter with Van Gogh, the bright colours and the tangled, whimsical lines crafted by a man wrecked by a world that did not want him, the beauty pulled from anguish like a magician’s unending colourful scarf. He’d walked until his feet ached, until a museum guard came and told him that it was time to leave, still standing open mouthed in front of Degas’ ephemeral ballerinas like he was seeing God for the very first time.
Tony waves a hand at him. He waits for Steve to leave, for the tell-tale hiss of the workshop door closing behind him.
“You bet I am,” Tony says. He worms one tentacle up and flicks at one of Steve’s abused nipples with it. They’re puffy, pink and used. Tony wants to put his mouth on them. “Look at you.”
“Of course,” Xavier says. “He expects an arguably unreasonable level of competence from those around him. It is what inspires trust: if he knows that he can count on someone in word and deed. But there is little Stark cannot do, and he forgets that this is not the case for everyone. His intelligence sometimes surprises even himself.”
For the first time since his death, here in Franklin Richards’ tiny arms, he feels like he can breathe again. It is maybe the best feeling he’s ever felt in the world.
“Of course he has,” Steve said, laughing. Giddiness was building up inside of him now, a strange joy that he couldn’t begin to cover up if he tried. “Alright. Well. Um. I guess I better get changed and go, huh?”
“It appears my methods of transportation did not agree with your comrade,” he explains, and Tony nods seriously.
Pepper blinks at him. "So what's this, then? You know I can't do this, Tony. We agreed this was the last time-"
“Doombots,” Natasha says with a grimace, poking at the StarkPad with her smallest finger. “Can we call Richards and Storm in on this?”
“We require normal men and women to register their guns, which are their constitutional right,” Ross bites out. “Asking for registration from these mutants, who can- can run faster than planes can fly, or who can blow things up with their minds can’t possibly be asking for too much.”
“You can be late. You’re always late,” Steve groaned, shifting his hips a little when Tony began to thrust. “Alpha, please, it’s been days since you claimed me-”
He hadn’t seen hide nor tail of Rogers in the week that had passed since. This was impressive, as before that, Rogers had made a point to try to curtail Tony’s drinking at any possible moment. It had become a personal crusade of his, maybe a bit of a joke between them even. He’d kept turning around at the sound of Casino’s doors, expecting to hear Rogers’ chastising voice, only to hear nothing but drink orders and coy flirtations with the lady Romanov’s girls. The only sight of the sheriff he’d seen had been out the forge window, because like it or not Rogers wasn’t able to avoid his position as town sheriff, and the jailhouse was right across the road.
“You wanna talk about lying? I lied to you for years. I wanted to tell you, but I was terrified that you’d hate me for it. You came out because you hated the lie that the American government had manufactured for you; Steve Rogers, America’s greatest alpha. I figured, why would you want me if you found out I was a phony? But then when you mentioned marriage, I thought, maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe you’d love me anyway. I wanted to tell you then, but-”
“Try that again and you will find yourself in even greater comparison with Tyr,” Loki snarls, thin black lips curling up from his teeth in threat.
“He shot an asset through you,” Tony says, repeating something Steve told him once after a particularly gripping nightmare.
Steve blinked his eyes open, breath stuttering in his throat. That had been happening, too; minutes where he lost himself, trapped in a fugue.
“Shh,” Tony hushes him, pulling away. His mouth is red and wet. Steve wants to devour him. “Save it for when you’re back in your body.”
“Questionable mystery tech is my arena,” Tony says. He glances into the cup, then shrugs, shotgunning it. The liquid is a little too close to scalding, but he’s mostly killed those nerves anyway. Nothing he hasn’t done before.
“No, no, don’t.” Tony gasps out. He presses a shaky hand to the arc reactor, squeezes his eyes shut. “
Steve fairly melts into Tony’s lap. He buries his face into his neck, wraps around him like an octopus. He never wants to let go.
“Bucky wasn’t in the surveillance footage we watched,” Steve says, but he’s beginning to look scared, too, now. “I would have remembered that.” The
A familiar tug breaks Steve out of his self-deprecating reverie, and he fights it a little, because that’s how he’s had the most success. He doesn’t know what else to do. He holds his ground, fingers reaching out ineffectually to try to grasp the bathroom counter and going right through.
“Sounds easy, when you put it like that,” he mutters, stuffing his hands in his pockets. He’s only a little bit bitter.
“We can’t,” Tony says, and Steve huffs sharply, rolling away in one quick move to sit on the edge of the bed.
“Why are you here, Captain?” He leans back in his chair, folds his hands in front of him. “What do you hope to get out of these sessions?”
“Jane is disgustingly assured for a mortal scientist involved with an actual mythological warrior god.”
“I-” Tony croaked, and the absolutely delicious way his stomach clenched as he leaned up to let Steve pull his shirt off had Steve’s head spinning with want. He leaned down, lining Tony’s abs with his tongue, pressing between the swells of muscle and licking all the salt from his skin. “
Then she got up and wiped her face down with a towel, draping it around her neck. Steve lay there on the mat as she drank from her water bottle, her head tossed back as she drained the whole thing.
The scene that greets him in the sunken living room isn’t exactly the one he’d been expecting. Loki is sitting across from Pepper with half of a peeled grapefruit in front of him, eyes alight as he converses swiftly with her in French.
The snap is the most painful he’s ever experienced. He feels like his body’s been wrenched apart into individual molecules and pulled back together again. He’s in so much pain he doesn’t know which way is up, but he reaches out a blind, desperate hand and feels around, praying for something solid. Skin. Warm skin.
Tony hazards a smile at him, and for a moment they just look at each other. Steve’s eyes tracing his face are almost as tangible as hands. Everywhere he looks, Tony feels it.
“No,” Steve is saying, backing away, and Tony scrambles to get his feet under him. “No, this isn’t real, either.”
“You’re right,” he murmured into Tony’s ear, pressing his face into hair damp with sweat. Tony smelled incredible, musk and metal and heat, and Steve took a deep breath, his exhale shaky. “I’m just a desperate omega for you, alpha. Just a hot, wet, willing place for your knot. Always. Any time you want me. Every time you want me-“
“That’s it, sweetheart, come on,” Tony rumbled, shifting his attention to the other side of Steve’s chest, and he didn’t know what to do with his hands, his body. He felt like he was floating, like he was on the edge of a cliff, waiting for a coaster to crest a hill. “I want you to come again. I know you can do it, omega. You want to be good for your alpha, don’t you? Tell me.”
Steve doesn’t like that answer very much, but he can see the sense in it. If he was on the outside, he’d be outraged that Tony was being so trusting. He’d be worried for his safety. If anything he should be delighted that Tony’s showing a rare strain of self-preservation.
Steve knew he was being unreasonable, but he didn’t quite want to share Tony yet, so instead Tony had spoken to Pepper on the phone. He knew that it was awful of him to keep Tony from his best friends, especially when Rhodes was so often gone and he was presently in the building while he filled in for Tony on the team, but every time he thought about Tony leaving the penthouse, panic clawed its way up his throat.
Steve flushes even redder if possible. He swallows. “That feels like a…dangerous question to answer,” he says baldly, and Tony laughs. It startles him, the earnestness of it, but Steve’s so awkward. It’s hard to begrudge him for his minor trespasses when he’s so clearly struggling.
Steve hummed in agreement, rocking his hips in a rhythm now. He could feel the pleasure building low in his gut, and he wanted it. He wanted to come on Tony’s knot. It always made the alpha absolutely crazy, made him rough, and Steve wanted to feel him while he was gone.
Steve laughed. He closed his eyes, and felt happiness and home settle over his shoulders like a thick woollen blanket.
“Loki’s like your mother?” Tony asks, as much curiosity as he is attempting to avoid Thor’s questions. Thor smiles at him, a wry thing that says that Tony is absolutely transparent, but he folds his arms across the back of the couch with jovial ease.
Steve walks into the communal living room with some trepidation. He’d expected more chaos, a few things broken, but instead it mostly just seems like the couches have been shoved around. In the centre of the carpet, huge and toxic green, sits the Hulk. He’s sitting with his chin in his hands, his expression grumpy as he watches Sesame Street.
Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again, because there’s no way. There is absolutely no way that she’d worked that out.
“He’s smart, crazier than a bag of cats with a generous helping of daddy issues, and a mass murderer with a significant personal body count but, more importantly, an
Some days, he wakes up still shaking in the remnants of those dark places Amora took him to. On those mornings JARVIS speaks softly to him, talks him back into his skull. Regardless of the shaking rebellion of his skin and bones, or perhaps more in spite of it, every morning he still gets up and goes for a run. For now, he keeps to streets where JARVIS can see him. He keeps a knife strapped to his bicep under his StarkPhone holder, against his thigh beneath his shorts. He recognises the signs of residual trauma, but still, he does what he needs to do. That's what the shrink is for, after all. The urges will fade.
Rogers stared at him, something like shame flickering over his face. He hung his head, staring at his hands. “I haven’t been a very good friend of late,” he said, but Tony just laughed.
“You had an eyelash,” he mutters, glancing back out the window. A figure stands ahead, off to the side, and Steve squints at the silhouette. It’s small, but growing larger as they speed towards it. The highway is empty, now, except for a few cars on the other side of the barrier. There’s nothing but oncoming traffic, and a man on the side of the road.
He does; it was easier to throw his weight around when SI was controlling the majority of the U.S. weapon industry as well as support, i.e. tactical gear, vehicles, tech. Now they’re splitting those profits with competitors, and Tony knows better than anyone that the U.S. government is more interested in things that go “boom” than they are in Chitauri-derived body armour.
a Japanese innovator who had been held unjustly, against international statutes, without due process, on American soil?”
The cold was biting, even as Tony spurred his horse faster through the building storm. He imagined the wind as a baying pack of black-eyed wolves, sharp teeth biting at his ankles as he thundered through sheaves of blinding white, streaks of snow clouding his vision and making it hard to make out anything of the road ahead.
Steve leans over and turns off the tap, then begins the slow process of stirring the salt into the water.
Steve nods, shifting awkwardly on his feet as she scampers away, half-running, half-walking. Her pointed ears twitch slightly as she moves, and Steve watches her go with a strange feeling in his chest. He can’t imagine what she must have gone through before coming here, but she looks happy enough.
“I need a vacation,” Tony mutters, skimming the page. “I trust Pepper. Can’t I just rubber stamp this?”
“He’s a reality warper, like-” Tony cuts himself off, thankfully before Sue can say anything to stop him. Her expression is sharp. Steve thinks that perhaps there is a reason that it took so long for Reed to notice that one of his closest friends had become a gaunt hermit, and it was because his much more gregarious wife was still angry at Tony for the War. Sue was fierce as ever as she stood with her hands on her hips in her pyjamas, surveying her family with an unimpressed glare.
“Morning,” he says, stepping into the kitchen. He pours himself a cup of coffee, ignores the sensation of eyes on the back of his neck. Bruce made lunch, it looks like—some kind of curry.
Fifteen minutes finds him standing over the glass, looking down into the small square window at his own frozen face.
“Or, maybe I’m crazy, and I hadn’t slept in fifty seven hours, and I’m talking to-” Tony cuts himself off, his voice breaking. Steve sucks in an unsteady breath. “Fuck.”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Steve is chanting, halfway between supplication and thanks. He’s struggling to keep his eyes open, eyelashes fluttering. “I need- please, I need-”
“Well, I talked to her,” he says, knowing JARVIS will know exactly what he’s talking about. “My rooms, please.”
Steve walks up to him, ignoring the hard lines of Tony's face. He takes Tony's dripping fingers in his. "You're a good man, Tony Stark."
It’s dark when he steps outside again, or at least as dark as Manhattan can ever be. The sweetness of Central Park in heat washes over him, approaching rain and fresh greenery, flowers and mown grass and clean dirt. The scent stays with him as he makes his slow way down Fifth Avenue, the susurrus of leaves and warm breezes slipping over his skin until he feels grounded again, held close in the presence of New York’s glittering night spires, the cool grey stone wall of the park trailing under his right hand, the uneven stones at his feet. Between the branches of her cultivated forest he can see snatches of moon, silvery light peeking in and out from behind waxy leaves and crooked black branches. The city feels ethereal, and fey, and in the distance midtown is lit like the fantastical spires of Oz, Stark tower a bright beacon among many jealous compatriots. Inexplicably, he feels a sudden stab of regret for calling it ugly all those years ago; it’s grown on him, familiar and dear.
“Mhmm,” Steve moans. He flexes his hips as much as he’s able, pushing back onto Tony’s hectocotylus. He opens his eyes, half-lidded and amatory, his gaze pinning Tony like an insect to corkboard. “You’re so good.”
“So you know I don’t want to see you, and you’re ignoring my wishes,” Tony says, mostly because he knows it’ll hurt Steve. And he kind of wants to hurt him. This whole situation has been a bad hand all around, and he hates it, and he wants to spread his misery. He’s never claimed to be anything but petty. “Also, fuck you so much for using the predictability of my AA meetings against me. That’s a low fucking blow for anyone, let alone Captain America.”
Steve clicked in the search bar, and with slow, steady fingers, typed in ‘testosterone cypionate-α injections.’
“Your mission was to get Tony Stark to back The Avengers Initiative. Now I’m your patsy and your sugar daddy and your R&D and your landlord,” Tony finishes, and Natasha inclines her head. “Is this the part where you tell me our friendship wasn’t a lie?”
“Nothing to apologise for,” Bruce said quietly, and Steve nodded. “Steve, I hate to say this, but I think you need to stay out of the quinjet. Even with the masks and the biohazard unit, you and Tony seeing each other is likely to trigger a strong biological reaction. You could hurt yourselves, trying to reconnect.”
“It is times like this that Loki most reminds me of our mother,” Thor says, so close his breath brushes the back of Tony’s ear. Tony whips around, because he’d been so caught up in the television that he hadn’t heard Thor come back. “Might I hear your thoughts, my friend? I know I do not understand Midgardian politics as well as I ought, but it seems as though you have been shouldering a burden that my brother has now relieved you of. What is it that we have been saved from?”
“I can’t… There aren’t words for it,” Steve rasps, and Tony preens a little. “They’re all too small.”
Steve drops the shield and raises his hands, eyes darting to Tony. They’re so blue, damp and frightened, and Tony spares him a grin because he knows that’s not for the guns pointed at his rippling pectorals. He can taste blood, and he watches with vicious satisfaction as all the colour drains from Steve’s face. He must make quite the sight.
Tony sighs. He closes out of the various windows on the monitor. “You’re a cruel woman,” he tells her.
Tony turns, wincing when he sees Steve and Stephen in a heated discussion. Steve’s hands are flailing in the air, impassioned, whereas Stephen is looking at Steve like he’s something that the cloak dragged though and needs to be washed out, post haste.
“Well, that’s not true,” Tony says, rolling his eyes. He takes a sip of his drink. “So, Loki and I have been fucking.”
“That sounds appealingly difficult,” Tony says, grinning, because he can totally see it. “Ooh, and it’ll light up!”
“Oh,” Tony says. He lets out a shaky breath, and Steve wraps his hand around Tony’s ankle. They’re incongruously delicate, Tony’s ankles. Slender and fine boned. He rubs a careful thumb over the jutting bone where he’d left his message.
“It’s not a disparagement, Tony. I just mean that when you and Steve are good, you’re a better scientist. A better man. And so is he. Steve needs someone to help make his ideals real. Otherwise they’re just dreams. Civil War wasn’t the first time you’d had a major disagreement, but it was the first time he wasn’t willing to listen to you. You were speaking to air.”
Tony laughs. He glances up to approximately where he must think Steve’s head should be. It’s closer to his neck from where he’s crouched on the floor, but the considering expression on his face is relaxed. Amused, almost.
“Yeah, that I wanted to avoid!” Tony exclaims, gesticulating mid-stride. Stephen studies him, chewing at his lip. He nods, once.
“I could cook us something,” Steve tried, feeling like an asshole, and Tony pressed a gentle kiss to his brow.
“Do you even know what you’re apologising for?” Tony asks, sounding genuinely curious. He spins around, face tight in the controlled mask that Steve hates more than any awful thing that’s ever come out of Tony’s mouth. His smile is about as real as Spam is meat. “Because, if I were apologising, which I’m not just yet, I know what I’d be sorry for and it definitely isn’t the bit where I pointed out the really rather obvious fact that physically speaking you’re Hitler’s wettest, blondest, bluest dream. Bad call, Cap.”
He stares at Steve’s body for a long time, motionless, expressionless. Then he moves over to the little bank of computers on the side, and begins fiddling with the controls there. He messes around with the computer for about half an hour, during which Steve grumbles at him for wasting time, sings him an old trench song, and tries to touch Tony again. He isn’t expecting it to do anything. It doesn’t seem like it does.
“Something about the heat now being regulated?” The sheriff sighed, scratching bashfully at the back of his skull. “To be honest, I don’t see half of what you and Peter are ever bobbering on about. Can you just go and make sure the boy’s not about to burn the poor widow’s house down?”
He was so dizzy with anticipation that it was hard to see straight. Instead, he focussed on putting one foot in front of the other on the plush carpet, until he managed to reach the sunken dais in the centre of the room. It was less of a bed than a pillow nest, an enormous circle set into the floor and filled with the finest washable fabrics money could buy, and a base mattress with just enough bounce to make certain activities a little easier. The little kid in Steve had wanted nothing more than to use it as a trampoline when he first saw it, but there was nothing of that impulse now as he stepped down into it, adjusting the pillows and blankets a bit before kneeling in the centre of the whole thing.
“You think you’re a regular curly wolf, but look at you; fat’s in the fire, and the town drunkard’s gotta fish you out of the brush by your ankles,” Tony griped, urging Flower on a little faster. “Stay with me, Rogers. Look alive.”
, getting a result for “calamari” instead, and, well… it’s become a Tony wants a drink kind of day, which is never a good place for him to be.
Loki measures him, eyes narrowing. “Anywhere from immediate to a few days to never, depending on the complexity and the materials,” he allows. “I cannot make you impervious, Stark.”
It’s an empty parking garage, it looks like. The overhead lights are off, a few lamps bathing the desks and worktops gathered near the elevator in yellow. Orange power cables snake through the darkness like vines, crossing over each other and black cords, all leading towards a greenish light in the distance, a prone form spread out on some sort of cot. Large, hulking machines huddle behind him like stone guardians. The only sound in the place is the whir of the suit and a quick, erratic beeping.
“Did she?” Steve asks. He watches the numbers change as JARVIS takes him back up to his quarters. The Avengers’ levels aren’t on the general elevator controls; Tony hadn’t seen the sense of it, partially for safety reasons. JARVIS’ authentication was required for anyone seeking to visit the upper floors.
Days pass, and Strange doesn’t call. Tony leaves two more messages at the Sanctum, increasing in their urgency, but there’s nothing else he can think to do but wait. Briefly, he considers going to someone else, but the fewer people that know about this the better. Also, the only powerful, active magic user he can find in NYC right now seems to be Nico Minoru of all people, which is just…not happening. Ever.
Something in Bruce softens, then. His expression shifts. “You don’t know how to ask for what you want, because you expect to be denied the things you want the most.” He reaches out and brushes Tony’s hair back from his face. “You’re quite fragile, under all your bluster.”
The rush of the world around him feels longer this time. He has just long enough to be terrified that something went wrong, that he’s stuck, before he is spat back out somewhere he’s never been before.
“I’m gonna be 200 by the time you’re done, feels like,” Steve gripes, and Tony laughs. “Tony, come on. I don’t mind if I’m feeling it, later. Might be nice, even.”
Tony pressed a hand flat against the glass, and Steve walked to him and met the gesture. The pain that blazed through his chest at the action was expected, the desire to have his alpha’s skin pressed against his less than sexual: just sheer, animal desperation for his mate. It was enough to white his vision out, his ears filled with a surging roar, the ground tilting beneath his weakening knees.
A hand tangled in his hair, and Steve opened his eyes and raised his head to see Tony standing above him, his expression wrought with a possessive fervour that coiled heat in Steve’s belly like a living thing. He opened his mouth, leaning up to lip mindlessly at the too-sharp point of Tony’s hipbone.
“Who knows?” he says. “SHIELD was never really on the up and up, let’s be real here.” It would be easier, if they could blame every shady thing the American government had ever done on Hydra, but Tony knows it isn’t that easy. It’s why Steve and Nat had elected to publish everything online, Snowden-style. As ham-handed as Tony thought that choice had been, he understood it. There was no way to sort out what was Hydra and what was just good old American imperialism; better to reveal all of it, and let the world see every misdeed for what it was.
"I'll drop you off outside, okay? Someone can meet us at the door to grab your luggage. I'll be fine."
Tony examines his options, then heads for the bar, intentionally turning his back on the god standing in his living room. He loosens his tie, and drapes his suit jacket over a bar stool. He can feel Loki tracking him as he rolls up his sleeves.
Tony stares at him, the barely contained temper in his body, and has no idea how to approach this situation. “Barnes escaped. With Amora. But I-”
Steve smiles a little. He reaches out and takes Tony’s free hand where it’s fisted on his knee, unwrapping his fingers gently. He laces their hands together.
The scent was overwhelming. Tony was everywhere in this room, even worse than in the penthouse. More than anywhere else in the tower, the workshop was his space. It was where he sweated, and slept, and breathed. Every single object in the room carried him on it, and Steve nearly went to his knees as soon as he stepped inside. His entire body felt like it shifted out of place, like someone had taken hold of his soul and just moved his body two inches to the left. He felt like he was being torn open, vision swimming so badly he swayed.
“We have sacrificed liberty for convenience!” Ghost screams. Spittle flies from his mouth. “Heads of corporations run our most sacred branches of government! Tony Stark is a cancer-”
“I can, too,” Tony counters, indignant. “Just because you’ll heal doesn’t mean I can’t hurt you. Relax, Steve.”
“We aren’t a Pack,” Tony says slightly hysterical, because there’s a terrible suspicion creeping up on him. “Bruce, I’m not an alpha.”
Tony nods, weaving his fingers together, pulling them apart and repeating the process in different configurations. “I think he’s just interested in my tech, honestly.”
He knows why Tony always keeps his eyes closed when they are intimate together, but it still hurts. He wants nothing more than to see Tony’s stormy blue eyes trained on him as his lover comes apart under his hands.
“I’ve been Iron Man for eight years, now, and the Avengers have been operating for two, four if you wanna go back to the Battle of New York. We haven’t failed you yet, have we?” Tony asks, spreading his hands. “Give us fair sanctions, and we can work something out. This country is built on checks and balances. We’re all patriots. But none of you can be blind to how ugly something like registration could get. Rogers was
Tony squeezes his arse, pulling the globes apart in what he knows from experience is a maddening tease. Steve just about swallows his tongue as Tony slips his fingers closer, skirting the edges of his hole.
Steve had a weak heart as a kid, along with all of his other problems. He remembers this weakness; the breath curdling in his chest like a liquid, fighting thing, pulse pounding loudly in his ears. He focusses on Tony’s pulse, counting, holding the air in his lungs as his body fights him. It only lasts a few seconds, but it’s enough to make bile rise in the back of his throat. He’d been done with this, he thought. He thought he was done with this.
“No, you- you’re Jane, in this comparison, okay?” Tony said, squirming in his vehemence, and Steve just wanted to press him up against the wall of the gym and kiss him breathless. He settled for tumbling them to the mats instead, pinning Tony with his weight and pressing kisses all up his neck, his jaw, his brow. “Stop trying to distract me with sex.”
“Nope,” Peter says, with the kind of glee that only shit-stirrers can manifest. “He’s in the common room drinking a beer and arguing about Dog Cops with Clint.”
Steve ignores him. He goes to his knees in front of Tony on the broken tile, paying no mind to the sharp edges, and reaches out with trembling hands for Tony’s wrist. His eyes dart up, meeting Tony’s for a brief, breathless second, before he looks back down at Tony’s skin. Bluegreen veins stand out against his olive skin. They will only get more visible with age, Tony knows.
“I would not do this for an enemy,” Loki says softly. He tilts Tony’s head to see his split lip, and Tony watches with his heart in his throat as Loki’s pupils dilate, one thumb brushing his lower lip ever so slightly as he pushes the pain away, then a little rougher, dragging Tony’s mouth open. Tony can feel goose bumps break over his arms, his breath shallow. “And I would have you well.”
Steve shrugs, a bitter smile coming to his lips. “I wouldn’t know,” he says. “No one wanted me then, either.”
There was a long pause. “I may have implied that you were not entirely acting of your own free will since your fight with Morgan Le Fay.”
“Sparring, brunch, and movie nights,” Steve answers honestly. He rubs at his mouth, nerves fluttering. “Tony skipped out on movie night. I was pretty sore about it.”
like this,” Steve accuses. “You like being able to touch me everywhere. Ten arms, all over me. Completely yours. I
“You say stuff like that,” Steve says, and Tony’s eyes snap guiltily up to his face, “and then you look at me like I’m a particularly juicy piece of meat at the butcher.”
“It’s alright,” he said, and Rogers looked back at him with his pupils blown, mouth red and used. In the low light of the setting sun, his hair looked warm and golden. “Jesus.”
Really what he wants to do is talk to Tony about some of the books he bought. Before he went to Saint Joseph’s, he thought that Tony would get upset if he asked him about any of this stuff. But after their talk in the workshop—at least, until Steve got something wrong, like he always does—he thinks maybe Tony would be happy to know that he’s reading
“No,” Tony says again, because he’s doing this all wrong. He tries to get a hold of his breath. “Oh, fuck, I’m sorry. I just-” He’s tearing up now, and he doesn’t know if it’s from the laughter or something else. “We
The only things of personal import on his desk are the old arc reactor Pepper had engraved for him and a photo of him and Rhodey from their graduation at MIT. The rest of it is just blueprints and crap.
“God, don’t tell me I’m getting old and predictable,” he says, rubbing a hand over his forehead. And then, “
. I’d rather the investigations be thorough than let a single man involved in the Potomac Crash go free to threaten the lives of American citizens again, don’t you? So Gyrich managed to get through the first round of investigations. Okay. I’d rather someone checked to make absolutely sure he was clean than risk letting a Hydra sleeper agent design international statutes for the very people that took them down the last time. That seems like letting the fox run the henhouse, don’t you think?”
Tony's a futurist. He sees things, marks chess pieces, and so it's not that surprising when somehow he's saved from impact when an EMP shockwave from Doom shorts his suit just as he's hurtling towards a skyscraper. It takes ten seconds for a reboot, he won't have enough time, and in the silence of his dead suit he can imagine Clint screaming on the coms, Cap's face draining of blood at the crash and the crunch. He hopes he doesn't hit steel rebar.
“Bless you,” Steve says under his breath, before he can stop himself. Peter laughs. “Thanks, Spidey.”
Steve frowns, twisting his hands together in his lap. He leans back in the armchair, crossing his leg over so his ankle is braced on his knee. “I don’t know,” he admits. “War’s changed a lot. Things are so much less black and white than they used to be.”
“Tell me again, when the spell is removed,” he says, and Tony rolls his eyes. Then he stills, and takes an unsteady breath. A terrible suspicion is building, founded on the defeated, hunched posture Steve had been exhibiting when they left him.
“I’ve met your Ms. Munroe,” Steve counters, “and she’s about the calmest woman I’ve ever had the pleasure of speaking with in my life.”
Natasha narrows her eyes, mouth curving into a wicked smile. “Why would they look for alternative options when an easier path was in front of them?”
,” he sobbed, and Tony raised his head, wet mouth red and obscene and open as he panted. His eyes were almost entirely black pupil.
He shoots Steve between the eyes, and darkness begins to bleed into the edges of his vision. It comes to him like an old friend, warm and welcome, and then it swallows him whole.
“I misjudged you, at the front,” Steve said, and Stark turned to stare at him. His eyes were wild in his face, terrified, but that was alright. Steve understood how the yolk of responsibility could be heavier than expected. “I’ll lead the team, and you’ll be my second. That was the plan from the start. Having you as pack alpha only makes sense.”
“You weren’t making these calls,” Tony says, flippant as ever, and Steve lets out a frustrated hiss of breath. “We were handling it.”
Steve blushed a little at the endearment, and Tony laughed outright. “Wow, you’re fine with comeplay but I call you stud and suddenly you’re the All-American boy scout again.”
Tony takes a deep breath, holds it. He can feel himself tapping on the arc reactor, that old nervous habit of his. He can feel his chest expanding under his fingers, the change in timbre in the clink of the crystal, the way his breath shakes in his chest.
, J. I’m so damn tired. I don’t- I don’t know what I’m doing. I feel like every move I make is just the lesser evil. I want a better answer, but I don’t know what that is. I’m the futurist. I’m supposed to be the one to envision the better answer. What the hell is the point if I can’t-”
“I have something,” Tony says, slowly. The very thought of it chills him, makes him want to retch up all of the rice noodles and shrimp and vegetables he’s just consumed, but he maintains a steady hand as he pulls out his phone. “I had all the prototypes destroyed except for one, but I can get to it. Pepper can get to it.” He grimaces. “We can use it on Barnes, too.”
“Agent Romanov has expressed some confusion that you obeyed Captain Rogers’ orders during the battle with The Wrecking Crew, but I doubt she suspects the truth.”
“I know who you are,” Evan says, but he tucks the sign with Steve’s name printed on it under his left arm and lets Steve shake his hand anyway. “I was supposed to replace Mr. Hogan as Mr. Stark’s driver and bodyguard, but he hardly ever needs me. Mr. Hogan said I should make myself available to you as well.”
“He’s in and out,” Riri said breezily, but there was something underneath her tone that made Steve pause. Tony might not be in an alpha rage, he realised. His hormones were probably a fucking mess. “I’ve got it handled. Tony and I worked everything out before you guys showed up.”
“No,” Steve says, shaking his head. “Even when I was a little guy, I was a brawler, Tony. You know that. I know you know that.”
Steve laughs, then tucks Tony more firmly into his body and heads over towards the elevator. “Why not?”
“This is your first Christmas without Barnes,” Tony said, and then was horrified at himself. He wouldn’t have said it if he was a little steadier, and Rogers’ hands tightened on his hip and wrist painfully. “I- I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-”
Steve was a fascinating, complicated combination of guilty and avaricious about the bruises he’d left on Tony the first time they’d had sex. He kept ghosting his fingers over them, gentle and adoring, but he’d apologised, too.
“Power up,” Tony tells him, pulling up with his repulsors at the last minute until he’s hovering a few feet above them. He sends the visual to the quinjet. “Amora, baby, I thought we had something.”
“He does. I have texted the address to your phone. I’m afraid that the man is somewhat old-fashioned, and it is best to speak to him in person. Josef Moretti has been working out of a shop on Canal Street since 1956.”
“Do you see how much come I’m covered in?” Tony demanded. “I am not about to sit here and debate your virility right now. You are literally engineered to be the peak of human perfection. Now get that smoking hot ass of yours up, and help me get clean.”
Steve covers Tony’s mouth, his arm still locked around Tony’s neck, mostly because he feels like it. He’s laughing, chest filled to bursting because he’d missed this. He’d missed the ease of being with Tony when things were good between them, fighting over the remote, the feel of Tony squirming under him be it sparring or silly wrestling like this.
Eventually, Tony seems to exhaust his options. He closes whatever programs he’d opened up. He takes ten seconds to press his palm to the cold glass above Steve’s face. Then he suits up and leaves the room with as little preamble as he arrived.
Steve glances at the upcoming street sign. "Wanna meet me at Pershing Square Café at seven? Double back whenever you feel ready. We can grab breakfast for the team."
“About what?” Tony said, and he looked so exhausted. Like he already knew. A warning growl built in Steve’s throat, without him being able to help it, and Natasha held her hands up, fork and all.
“Why Captain, are you propositioning me?” Tony drawls, and Steve huffs a laugh. Warm air skates over the nape of Tony’s neck, sending a delicious shiver down his spine.
Steve kind of loses himself in the kissing. Below them, the sounds of the city echo up to them strangely: a siren, a voice on a megaphone, the flapping of many wings. He considers, briefly, the worry of being spotted, but discards it just as quickly. He honestly could not care less right now.
There was something Steve knew that none of the rest of the team did, not even Bruce. It was something he and Tony had decided not to tell anyone, because it would complicate the narrative of their lives in a way neither of them felt was necessary. They wanted to be together. They loved each other. They were in it for the long haul, no matter what. And maybe, there was a part of them that knew that they’d been irresponsible. Nobody liked getting scolded by Pepper or Bruce, the ribbing comments sure to come from Clint, the judgmental eyebrow from Natasha. They wanted the team to be happy for them in that uncomplicated way that only a pack could be with a mated pair leading them. They wanted to give that to them, and so they had.
Tony laughs into his mouth, pleasure and delight wrapping around him as the muscle contractions make Loki curse, biting at Tony’s neck.
“Sir, I have him. I am sending reinforcements.” JARVIS’ voice is gentle, and Tony snarls with frustration, heading back up the elevator shaft.
They’re all back from Florida now. He knows this because Peter marched in and told him so, a determined glint in his eye that was readable even through the mask. It was his posture, maybe, or the way he held himself. It spoke of an argument, and what Steve wouldn’t give to have heard whatever it is they argued about that involved Steve.
Steve is used to most of his teammates solving much of their problems with copious amounts of alcohol. On a bad day, he envies it of them, remembers a room that was more rubble than building, a hollowed-out shell of a place reflecting the aching, empty places inside of him where a brother used to be. Still, he can’t begrudge them for it. He knows that, in many ways, he’s had a charmed life compared to some of this new, strange family he’s made. He had a mother that loved him. He wasn’t introduced to the more horrific parts of humanity until later in his life, the cruelty of fellow children aside. He had a childhood, for the most part. It was enough.
“I don’t know,” Natasha says, “I feel like the last scene changes things for me. Doesn’t the last line-”
Steve closes his eyes. A single tear leaks out, trailing down his face. Tony has the strangest desire to take a photo. He’s going to remember this moment for the rest of his short life. He wonders if it’s going to hurt this much every time.
“Hey, easy tiger. I left you in there so you wouldn’t bolt. Or sock me. Again.” Cap freezes, turning to stare at him with wide eyes, a fathomless blue with pinprick pupils. One of the machines behind Tony lets out a sparking shower of flames, and he ducks and glances back at it. Cap doesn’t even flinch. “We’re getting you out of here, okay buddy?”
Okay, so there's a lot going on in this chapter, but I want to warn for the following in particular:
Eventually, he’s able to scrape together enough strength to swing his legs over the side of the lounge chair. He scrubs his hands over his face, wipes away whatever wetness lingers at the corners of his puffy eyes. He takes a deep, trembling breath.
better.) But he hasn’t made any sexy tentacle toys, which he totally would have, if it was a kink. He’s not that guy.
“Well, why else would only I be able to interact with you?” Tony asks. He turns around to gesture in the general direction of Steve. “Not Strange, or Xavier, or any of the other telepaths or magic users. My tenure as a technopath is the only thing that sets me apart, and is the only real way to explain why I would be the sole person able to receive input from your mostly-dormant brain. Which begs the question: how is Extremis gathering the data that I’m translating into touch? And where is the output coming from? There has to be some kind of data stream we’re able to track, and that puts this problem squarely back in my wheelhouse, not Reed’s. This kind of sleuthing is old hat for us, isn’t it Fri?”
“Thanks, babe,” Tony says. He glances over his shoulder at Nat. “Don’t go soft on me now, Romanov. If your story checks out, I’ll need you up and running bright and early.”
Clint wasn’t going to let this go. He was going to ask Tony, Steve knew, as soon as they were together again. Steve had no idea what Tony was going to say to him. Tony was the pack alpha, and Clint the only unbonded omega on the team. With Natasha and Bruce’s unique biological conditions, and Thor’s alien physiology, the one who had the most to lose after Steve was Clint. Pack bonds were integral to the continued emotional and physical health of an omega, especially an unbonded one. It was part of why the Howling Commandos had been so close-knit; a pack functioned more cohesively in the field than unattached agents. More than that, though, Steve knew that most of the Avengers had never had anything approaching a real pack, not like what they had now. The Red Room trained its operatives to need no one. Both Bruce and Clint had grown up in broken homes. Thor didn’t have a nature at all. Tony had been brutally betrayed by his own pack alpha, and his pack had consisted of no one but Stane, Pepper, and Rhodes for years. Out of all of them, only Steve had ever known what a healthy pack was like before this, and even that had been a military operation. This was the closest thing to family that any of the team had ever had. Having a strong alpha-omega pair leading them was a rarity in the modern age, and one that made everyone in the pack feel safer, more secure, happier. Steve couldn’t imagine how Clint felt, knowing that something was threatening their alpha, their whole pack, and it was being kept from him.
It was a gross oversimplification of the situation, too romantic. The stress of breaking a bond overwhelmed the body’s endocrine system. Sometimes, it was too much of a shock, and rarely, people died from it. Sometimes the void left after the biological imperative of years of co-dependency drove people to madness after a mate’s death, but the studies were unclear. Many of the subjects involved in the study had lost their mates traumatically. Others had been bonded for many years, and were already reaching old age. Its validity had been called into question. Steve knew, because he’d wanted to be ready when he had to argue his case to Tony. He’d done his homework. He liked to think he was a logical kind of man.
Tony loves, so deeply it hurts. It seems like the done thing, these days. It’s his fault, really, for keeping such astounding specimens around all the time. He’s just encouraging them to break his tinman heart.
Tony shook his head, blinking rapidly, and Steve grinned at him. “Okay, Shellhead,” he said, and now that he was smiling he couldn’t stop. The smile that Tony offered him in return was wobbly, but filled with a hesitant wonder that made Steve feel like he was going to split open, sunlight spilling out of his chest. “You’re my partner. I don’t trust anyone else to have my back, on and off the field. The idea of the world not knowing that for one second longer, of anyone looking at us and not knowing that we belong to each other, well.” Steve licked his lips, then laughed at himself. “I lied to you, Tony. It was bothering me something terrible thinking about you going on a date with somebody else. I kept picturing some computer genius, who could understand when you went on about the issues you’d been having with the inner wiring of your elbow joint, who could ask all the right questions. I didn’t think I was jealous, but I was wrong. I don’t want to share you anymore.”
“Hmm, yes,” Tony murmured, and then he was pressing his cock inside, and Steve could barely breathe with how full his mouth was, the way that Tony’s fingers were pressing down on his tongue. “Beautiful.”
“Yeah,” he says. And then he squirms, because now that he’s not hard and desperate, this position is a little…exposed, for his tastes. “Uh, can I…come down, now?”
“Harder,” Steve tells him, and so Tony does it again, harder. He tightens his hold on Steve’s thighs and calves.
“You will,” she counters, and Tony lets out a wrecked sob, thrashing in her grip. “We will get through this. All of us will get through this.”
I also realised after I wrote this that everyone in it was on the Protect Tony Stark train, probably to make up for the brush with potential squick/rape in it. But also I hate the trope where everyone tells Tony he's no good for Steve and fulfills his own personal insecurities, so. There's a story for you where everyone wants to protect and love Tony instead. Even Stephen! In his own grumpy way.
“Okay, okay. Okay. I think maybe I skimped a little on the aftercare this morning. I thought you’d be fine since we spent the night together, but clearly I fucked up, and that’s bad form on my part.” He glances up to see Loki looking quizzical, and Tony takes the moment to step into Loki’s space while his defences are down. He dips his head a little to peer into Loki’s eyes. The words he says next feel foreign in his mouth, but he has the feeling they’re entirely necessary.
“I’m your people,” Pepper says confidently, and Tony turns around with a container of blueberry yoghurt in time to catch a conspiratorial glance between the two. He picks up a spoon, then makes his way back towards the couch. His knuckles graze Loki’s cheekbone as he passes, more instinct than choice. Loki leans into it, offers him a wry smile.
Steve laughs, low and overwhelmed. He rubs a hand over his eyes. "There's not much to tell," he admits. "Died when I was real young. Drank too much. He had PTSD from the first World War, although we didn't have the words for that then. All I knew was that he was a mean drunk. But my ma cried when he died, even if I didn't. She knew a version of him I never got to see, I'd guess."
“Come on, then,” he says, and Steve nods, pressing Tony back into the sheets. “My head’s killing me.”
“We’re not talking about this,” he says, and JARVIS subsides. As he must, because in the end, he is Tony’s AI. “Keep an ear to the ground for Strange. I’m not fucking telling the team. I refuse to be taken off the field when it’s Cap’s orders that stopped me from saving lives.”
Steve pulls back, winding his arms back around Tony’s neck. His eyes are black as obsidian—just as fathomless, just as sharp. “I’ll tell you as many times as you need to hear it, Shellhead. Are you listening?” His voice is slow and sure, deep with desire. Tony couldn’t ignore him if he tried. “I love
“I doubt you would trust anyone else to the task, sir,” JARVIS drawls, and Tony squints a glare at Pepper, then the closest security camera, shoving the spoon in his mouth just to be contrary. “The Mark 50 is prepared for deployment whenever you are, sir.”
He’s shaking now, eyes bright and fevered, and Tony approaches him with open hands. “Okay, Brucie-Bear, come on. Breathe with me, okay?”
Tony nods, even though that’s two things. Even though he knows he won’t. He can’t trust himself to speak. He feels numb with grief. Nothing’s hurt this bad since Jarvis—the old, human Jarvis—died. He’s two seconds away from bawling like a child.
Tony let out a grumble, but he sat down at the kitchen bar, picking up a fork and cutting off a piece of omelette with the edge. He shoved it in his mouth and washed it down with coffee.
“I Intend to have you,” Loki hisses, arching into his hands. Tony grins and leans up to bite at that long neck, hard enough to leave marks on a human. Loki wraps his hand around the nape of Tony’s neck, holding him there, and Tony sucks a bruise right against his pulse point. “See if your reputation is well deserved.”
Tony grins at Franklin even as Sue’s face practically turns to stone. “Night little man. Tell your sister I said hey.”
The shirt has the shield on it. For a long time, Beth just stares at it, the fabric stretched between her clenched fists. Inevitably, Tony steps closer, close enough to see what’s stymied her. Then Tony takes a shuddering breath, and for the length of that breath, Steve feels as though he and Tony are one being. One body, experiencing one, terrible moment of horror. The silence in the bathroom is thick as molasses.
“-some magical expertise of his own would that could be useful to you?” JARVIS finishes smoothly, ignoring his interruption.
“But not him,” he says. He’s crying like a child, now, saying it over and over: “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.”
“I do,” Steve says, and it’s true. “It…there’s so much more to learn about him, I know that. But I do.” He laughs a little, brokenly. “Thank you, father.”
Rogers was frowning over his arm, wrapping bandages around it. Tony hadn’t gotten back in time to see what the damage was, and he resisted the urge to demand Rogers pull the wrappings up and let him have a look. Instead he cleared his throat pointedly, folding his hands across his chest.
“I look forward to working with you,” Steve said, and Stark furrowed his brow at him, a bemused smile taking over his face.
Steve wet his lips, glancing up at the ceiling as he tried to calm himself. He’d expected an interrogation, not…whatever this was. He was never sure how to handle Natasha being kind.
“He’s the squishy human of the group. Supposedly he got caught in the crossfire,” Rhodey adds, and Tony hums, considering the words.
“Last night, I was able to touch him back for the first time,” Tony says. His throat is clogged with unshed tears, and God, but Steve wants everyone to be done crying. He’s cried enough. Everyone has cried enough. “I felt his face. It was Steve’s face. I know it’s Steve. I know-…I know.”
“Thor, I want you on Executioner. Hawkeye, it’s gonna be your job to take out as many doombots as possible while also keeping Amora too busy to hit. Stay out of range.”
“Look at you two,” Nat says, shifting into a more comfortable position. The heavy chain that attaches her wrists to the table clinks gently. “So
“I’m the Ghost in the Machine,” he says. “You were the only compatible system. It took a perfect storm of the serum, Ghost’s mutable biologic nanites, and the last dregs of Extremis to keep me alive all this time. Without you, Ghost would have won. He would have killed me, and no one would have ever known why or how. You saved my life, because we’re compatible. You and me. Connected, like we’ve always been.” He laughs a little, mostly at himself. “I don’t know. I think it’s kind of romantic, actually.”
Steve just shakes his head. “I’m going out,” he says. “I have a meeting. I just wanted to catch you before I go.” He winces. “And you’re right; I’m sorry for exploiting the predictability of your AA meetings. That was unfair.”
“Not if he’s running scans,” Tony observes, watching for Loki’s flashing grin. He frowns when it doesn’t come.
interested,” Tony muses, and Steve squeezes his eyes shut. “I’ve been swimming on my private beach. What’s your excuse, hmm? Wet hair…my, my, Captain, were you
“I know you’ve gotten spoiled, what with the other Avengers picking up the slack—you know me, anything to get out of doing my real job and go blow something up instead,” more laughter, “but Miss Potts insisted, so here I am. I know I’m no Thor, but just remember, he’s married, and I’m unattached.” Tony lifted left hand, wiggling his fingers, and Steve swallowed heavily. It was almost like Tony
“I think I’d have to examine her power in person to know, but it seems likely that lowered inhibitions could be a side-effect. But I think we both know that your relationship with Stark is already fraught, and often needs the barest spark for combustion.”
