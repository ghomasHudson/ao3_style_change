“Julia, darling, be a love and turn the radio on, hm?”
But both men started laughing again.
Then all the fight died out of him, as well as the light in his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, tears welling in his eyes. “Sherlock, I am so… so very sorry.”
As the woman walked past Violet to place the pug in Edward’s lap, Violet nearly gagged as she caught a strong whiff of the woman’s perfume.
She felt something tearing in her shoulder and she didn’t hold back the cry of pain. Despite this new agony, she struggled to sit up, spitting out water and gagging. As the tide receded, she scooted back on her behind and managed to shimmy up into a sitting position. Her shoulders screamed bloody murder. Her arms burned with the effort of keeping them over her head and her hands began to tingle and throb. However it felt a hell of lot better than when she had been standing with her arms all twisted up.
He fixed his eyes on what lay inside the illustrated copy of
work. “And sorry, I need to back up a bit. April. It’s bloody
’s doorstep shortly after Sherlock had departed for England. She brought with her three large Louis Vuitton suitcases, a matching carry-on bag and four enormous cardboard boxes filled with American toiletries and luxuries for Doña Nalda. The plump landlady nearly burst into joyful tears when she opened one box to find nothing but Charmin Extra Soft toilet paper. Proper bog roll was becoming an issue with the American tourists already starting to trickle in and going into shock finding none in public toilets.
“What kind of job?”
He exhaled quietly, thinking. He could pick the lock, of course. Easy. But time-consuming without the proper tools. And neither woman wore kirby pins in her  hair tonight. Soon his absence would be noticed.
Sherlock shook his head. Wiggins had dropped off the digitized version of the microfiche last Tuesday.  Apologetically, he had told Sherlock, “It’s all gibberish and gobbledygook, Shezza, unless it’s some kind of secret code.” Then a light had flicked on for him. “It
There was a knock on the door frame. “Pardon me for intruding,” a small bespectacled man stood with a black bag, reminding John of an old-fashioned doctor’s kit. “But a Mr. Holmes contacted me about tuning a piano?”
“The doctor may not have a diagnosis after one visit,” John reminded him.
Anthea’s eyes widened in horror as the magnitude of her error sank in,
“I won’t take advantage of him,” John said firmly, choosing not to remember how he had almost asked Sherlock for a loan after having a row with a chip-and-pin machine at Tesco.
“Oh.”
… John glared at the body, his ears still ringing from the shot. Then he grimaced at the spatter of blood and brain on the framed picture of their wedding portrait hanging on the wall, just the two of them in their bridal finery. Frozen for all time, the image of him in that ridiculous grey morning suit, with tails no less, and she draped in that exquisite vintage lace gown.
“Except the bit about Magnussen having a ‘mind palace’ instead of possessing actual physical copies of the incriminating information,” John said hotly, his angry voice echoing throughout the room. He inhaled deeply, told himself he could not punch Mycroft at The Diogenes Club. His temper somewhat back under control, he said: “That bit you didn’t know, no one knew about Magnussen’s goddamned mind palace. You…” John folded his lips together. “You bastard,” now his voice was ice. “You bloody used him again for your own political schemes. And it fucking backfired again, didn’t it?”
Sherlock, however, had not gotten the memo. “Ah, excellent, now that you’re finished drinking the coffee meant for me, can we proceed?”
…” she barely garbled out.
John grinned “I honestly don’t know if that would please Sherlock or irritate him.”
, you’re a goddamn
“Kidneys,” Molly offered but quickly added “But he didn’t get them from me. I cut him off.”
Violet pushed an old filing cabinet she had barricaded the door with aside then slipped through the crack. She hurried down the stairs, cringing at the spider-webs hitting her face. She bit back her screams of disgust and fear all while keeping her finger on the trigger.
“Right, sorry,” John muttered.
Ruthlessly, he stopped that train of thought before it could progress any further then re-routed himself back on track he needed to be on…
Notre Dame
Marie was no fool. “Not to mention the fact that you’re supposed to be dead, but one word from Holmes can make you very un-dead?”
In the fire captain’s old office there was also a white board covered with obscure mathematical equations, elaborate computer codes and complex chemical compounds. Long plastic tables, ones normally used for picnics and birthday parties, lined the walls in a horseshoe. Laptops littered the tables with the exception of one desktop computer. There were two wireless printers at the end of the tables, one of the printers still churning out pages.
grin. “But if she stayed nice and quiet, there’d be a chance she’d walk away from this all yet. Oh yes, Sherlock, there’s a way you can save all your pretty flowers. The Rose, The Violet,” he traced a gloved finger down Violet’s cheek. She shuddered but there was emotion in her eyes again. Pure, unadulterated hatred.
He washed his face and hands with the little soaps Doña Nalda provided (he didn’t ask where she got them from) then dried his hands and face. He tugged off the ridiculous necktie, took off his suit jacket, his socks and shoes, breathing a sigh of relief that this day was over.
As flies to honey, as piranhas to blood, Ernesto started to flirt shamelessly  with “Irene Nesser.” He and Paul were not identical twins. Ernesto was short, stocky and barrel-chested. But he had beautiful golden-brown eyes and a seductive smile whereas his brother had boring brown eyes and a sly, almost simpering smirk. Ernesto also had dimples in both cheeks when he smiled, which even Lisbeth had to admit, was positively adorable.
A door above them squeaked open and the sounds of laughter and footsteps filled the stairwell.
do you know about
Violet’s heart sank.
After the young man explained himself, Violet put her fingers to her forehead, started rubbing. “Right, yes. Of course. We’ll be there shortly. I am so
“I told you not to snoop around Ford’s murder.”
“No,” Sherlock said crisply. “I need two of your best Montmartre Militia, preferably male, but if there’s a female that can pose as male or a transgender person making the transition to male, that will do as well. It’s for appearance’s sake. And, I need Noelie.”
“The Onion Field is conducting illegal drug trials on human test subjects,” Sherlock explained as Violet pressed herself against him, staring at Mitton in horror.
Therefore, the logical choice was: !!! UPDATE !!! REPOSTING: MOVING TO VEGAS 1/19/16, NEED SHARE FOR GAS, MOVING VAN, DRIVE, GAY MALE OR STRAIGHT FEMALE PREFERRED. !!! UPDATE !!!
! That’s been illegal since 1966!”
“Oh fuck,” Gregson groaned. “
“I know it’s a sin to curse the dead and I know he was your brother… but goddamn him.”
“Go on out of that,” Janine retorted scornfully.
“We’re getting too close to it all,” Sherlock explained, slamming shut one drawer and opening another, slamming it again upon discovering it was empty. “They are trying to unbalance me.”
“Young man, your father is going to hear about thi-OW!” Violet snatched her hand away after Edward bit her and ran away, darting into a wardrobe and shutting the door.
“Text,” John said. “Save your voice.”
24 April 2016
Faint alarm bells went off in Violet’s head. “What did she look like? Anya?”
“His brother does work for the government, yes?”
“So, if you’re not Sally Donovan, who are you?” Violet asked her prepaid mobile before opening the email message:
“Why would your father keep pictures of you and brothers locked up in a metal box?”
existed… lurked just below the surface…
He could feel his stomach tighten and his heart start to race.
, he thought with a self-satisfied smile as he continued to sip tea.
“No, he’s…” Violet grasped her drink with both hands, as if to steady them.
Violet slid into the passenger seat just as the bomb detonated.
Now he was clad in a fresh nappy and dry, fuzzy, footed pyjamas, and all was well in Henry’s world. Of course, he had no desire to sleep. He was wide awake. Time to play.
“Susie,” John used Mary’s pet name for her. “Your mother needs to be in hospital. She will probably need to stay in hospital permanently. Her kidneys, well, they’re kaput.”
“God bless the nannies,” Lady Moira nodded, the gratitude in her voice sincere. “I don’t know what I would have done without dear old Colleen and I only have the one boy.”
“Ohhh…”  Mary breathed, looked at the girl, who couldn’t be more than nineteen. Twenty at most…. Maybe even only seventeen or eighteen once all the cosmetics were washed off.
“I need an excuse,” Sherlock said almost inaudibly.
“If you would have listened to me in the first place, if we would have gone
“No shit, Sherlock,” Violet’s smile turned into a frown. She stroked his cheek. “You better hurry.”
“Um, yeah,” John’s cheeks turned slightly pink. He cleared his throat, “I told him that was a dickish thing to do, to betray your confidence just because he’s angry with you,” John felt Sherlock’s kaleidoscopic eyes on him now, scanning him, deducing him. He was so used to this by now it didn’t even really faze him anymore.
“What’s the deal with his shoulder?”
“I’m awake, been awake for a while now,” Violet told him as she walked around the other side of the bed and started helping him. “Go change your jammies. I’ll take care of this.”
of a pug puppy in there. In the pools, along with two other dead dogs…” John swallowed, tasting bile again. He had indeed seen worse. But there was just something pitiful about the puppy that sickened him. “You said that kid’s dog, Edward Rucastle? Didn’t you say it was a pug?”
Rucastle threw his chest out like a bantam cock and announced that he had designed the hostesses’ dresses and the service staff’s uniforms in a loud voice that was meant to be overheard by all the diners. Violet was the one who made the appropriate sycophantic remarks about how lovely the outfits were. Sherlock was too busy
Violet let the laptops drop without a second thought. As the plastic cases cracked upon impact with the cement floor, Violet drew the Glock she had tucked into the back of jeans. Green had loaned it to her with an amused arched eyebrow, “I want this back.”
**Sherlock's asshat comment comes from "The Sign of Four":
“OK. But even then, I’m still not leaving.”
“It was,” Violet said, sitting down on one of the stone benches. Smoothing her dress down, she asked “Have you composed anything else?”
intimidate me, John.”
. She grabbed Tristan by the upper arm gently but firmly. “Show me,” she demanded in a whisper.
3 April 2016
But, as Mary herself had pointed out, women like them didn’t have friends. They had allies.
that died, that she
John looked at the floor.
His gut twisted a bit. He did not get along with his daughter. Not one bit, but she was still his baby, his little Harry. For all her faults, she was clever, she was funny and she was brave, in a pig-headed Watson sort of way.
“Let’s go home,” Mary rubbed his back as they slowed walked towards Mary’s car.
“No, you don’t,” Violet said serenely. As Sherlock pouted, Violet asked, “Did you tell one of your contacts to save her?”
“Well, that’s all very fine and good,” John’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “So how do we adapt to
the bikers could be, even though he was not a fan of being on the receiving end of that affection.
“Leave? Why?” Rucastle looked crestfallen. “We haven’t even had pudding yet. And it’s your birthday supper.”
But the other reason why he wasn’t sleeping was the Mary Conundrum.
Cardiff, England
He snorted. Here he was, a grown man of forty, actually contemplating tattle-telling on his big brother to Mummy…
It was a mathematical certainty another young aspiring actress would disappear. If it hadn’t  happened already, that was .
this conversation.”
Because that’s what silver-haired, bespectacled old men did, watch birds and drink coffee.
As Sherlock helped him stand up, John could see Sherlock’s pale face had assumed its usual cool, aloof façade. His eyes took everything in but revealed nothing.
And now John knew why he felt like being torn apart. He wasn’t jealous, just very, very sad.
One of the files in Woodhouse’s emails had a subject line labeled “Operation Onion Field” with a secure attachment, but she hadn’t been able to decrypt it, not even with the help from her “Evil Google.” She also didn’t dare reach out to any other hacker to help her decode it… those bastards didn’t work for cheap or for free.
He thought about his sister trussed up like a Christmas goose, Peters holding a gun to her head and laughing at her as she pleaded with him not to hurt her little brother…
“And what’s that?” Molly asked gently.
“Wait for it…” Sherlock hummed to his brother.
The young man was strong and managed to drag John away a few steps. John tried to shake him off, but then felt his feet get tangled and he tumbled to the ground. A sharp pain radiated from his hip as well as his hand when he tried to catch himself. He covered his head for a moment, afraid he’d get stepped on, as people scurried around him. High heels clacked, rubber soles of trainers squeaked and loafers slapped on the ugly, grimy floor.
“Ah, son, we talked about this too. I’m going to be busy working the next few weeks and then we’re off to the Copper Beaches. Won’t that be nice? Miss Smith will be minding you while I’m working. She is also going to help you learn French so you can come with me the next time I go to Paris. Would you like that, to go to Paris with me?”
“Sherlock, the last time I asked you to leave a case alone was Magnussen and look what happened,” Mycroft actually looked a bit panicky. “I’m asking, no. I’m begging you, please. Sherlock, don’t. Open. That. Door.”
“Sherlock,” Violet hissed.
“There’s still some chicken soup and custard Mary brought over yesterday left in the fridge. There’s a carton of ice cream in the freezer too. Drink water and ginger ale if your throat starts hurting again. Take your medication,
Sherlock blinked, taken aback. He was used to people telling him off for boasting about his intellect, not for the lack of it. “Stupid…?” he said lamely, utterly bewildered now. “
?” Sherlock sneered. “Legality be damned, exile his little brother, hang his best friend. One can die if thousands can live. It’s all for the
So Sherlock, hands behind his back, followed the gangster with the mobile back inside the house. When they reached the hallway that lead to the cellar, Sherlock had gladly knocked the idiot out and turned the light on so John and Wiggins could see what they were doing while Wiggins picked the door lock.
Wednesday evening
Too late, he remembered how he had given  Magnussen a tasty tidbit about the Holmes Brothers. About why ickle William had clung to his Irish Setter.
People continued being rude arseholes, bumping into him, hitting him with their hold-alls and laptop bags. One woman actually ran over his foot with her oversized suitcase, not even looking at him as she continued to drag the case behind her, its wheels wobbling.
“Great security system,” John pointed the gun at the dog’s head.
She studied her hands. Then she waved them around as she shook her head again. She pressed her palms to her aching head and emphatically said, “NO.
Violet also noted there were still moving boxes here and there. They had moved in the beginning of October. They got the nursery set up and the essentials put away, but had not made  much progress after that when it came to unpacking. But that was understandable as they had moved in a great rush. After Lestrade’s flat had been broken into twice after he and Molly had gotten married, finding a new place had been the number one priority. Especially since the first time the flat had been broken into, Molly’s cat had been gruesomely murdered. The second time, of course, was when the attempt on Molly and the then unborn-Henry’s lives had been made.
Meanwhile, the war raging inside Sherlock would never die.
“John.”
again.
“The news couldn’t be better. As you already know
“Sherlock,” John strove for a balance between stern and sympathetic. The man, obviously, was horribly ill. Seeing Sherlock sapped of his usual frenetic energy, not to mention robbed of his rich, resonant voice, reminded John too much of those dark months after the First Shooting.
“Obviously,” Sherlock strode over to the light-switch. As he flicked the lights on, he asked, “How is John? Your mobile is warm and there are recent smudges on the screen from your ear and cheek. John would be the only one you would call at this late hour.”
“What… I don’t smell anything.”
Saturday afternoon
Then he stood up, clutching the third bouquet in his hands.
She had a feeling where this story was going. She desperately hoped she was wrong.
“That wasn’t dancing they were doing out there,” he said, grumpily. “That was just...” he waved his arms in the air. “Shaking arms about while jumping up and down.”
“Then piss off. Find the mole yourself,” Sherlock tugged on Gladstone’s leash. Together they started walking back to the block of flats. “After all, you’re the clever one. I’m just a junkie and an idiot, isn’t that right?”
anyway – SH
As John slid the ice-pack between his back and pillow, Sherlock muttered, “Apologies for troubling you, John. It won’t happen again.”
Been hiding there as husband and wife,
“I don’t think we’re expected to decide tonight,” Sherlock drawled.
Again, thanks to my beta'ers cadogan who fixes my rotten grammar and Lucanael who fixes my rotten French.
Soon, Sally found herself on a stretcher, with an oxygen mask over her nose and mouth and a saline drip in her arm. The wheels of the stretcher crushed the Song of Praise roses that had decorated the coffin.
To her horror, she lost her balance. Her legs got hopelessly tangled in the layers and layers of gauze that made up her skirt. She landed hard on her hip and elbow, cursing as sharp, needling pain radiated through her. Sensing rather than seeing Toller coming for her, she thrust her leg out again, her heel connecting with his gut. But her kick didn’t have its usual power behind it and he grabbed her ankle and dragged her closer. Violet yelped while she was dragged across the gravel driveway before Toller rolled her over to her belly, then jerked her to her feet by her bound wrists. He grabbed her around her waist while Violet kicked out wildly while trying to slam her head against Toller’s.
“What’s in Paris?” Violet interrupted briskly just as John opened his mouth to retort.
Molly’s face scrunched up, “Oh that’s a small space with the pram and everything. How about we meet you two near the Coffee & Muffins?”
Horley, Gatwick
Sherlock grimaced, but stood up to comply, deciding it was not in his best interest to press his luck any further this afternoon.
But Lucas took Sherlock’s poor manners in stride. John guessed the extremely handsome man in the sharp three-piece suit and expensive trench coat had dealt with Sherlock in the past. “I will, however, bring your belongings to the hotel and get you checked in.”
. Not sitting at your wife’s side. Resting in the bed across from hers.”
But she had resumed her simpering Miss Smith 2.0 demeanor when Mrs. Toller did tattle on her during tea. “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, Mr. Rucastle. But it’s been in my experience that it’s better to allow young children to express their creativity rather than have them read about it in books. Six-year-olds just don’t have the memory capacity to retain information such as Art History. Besides, I thought it might brighten Mrs. Rucastle’s day, if Eddie made pictures for his Mummy,” Violet had smiled deferentially, sipping her god-awful bitter tea.
She responded, also in German, “You would act the same if you met one of your heroes, like Charles Darwin.” She paused then added in the King’s English, “Or Steve Jobs.”
A black cab finally pulled up. “Where to, ma’am?” the cabbie asked.
Alex certainly didn’t question it. She did lift an eyebrow when the female officer who drove Violet opened the backdoor and Gladstone sat up then jumped out. Violet quickly snatched up the leash and tugged, signaling to Gladstone to stay close to her.
Finally, the Professor smiled, “You’re wondering why the good lady continues to weep. Well, her youngest daughter has been arrested. Cubans don’t enjoy the freedom of speech that Americans do, and supposedly she was overheard saying something quite unsavory regarding the current regime.”
“Good,” Dupin nodded then his face collapsed into an expression of extreme sadness. “Oh and please extend my deepest condolences to Dr. Watson about the loss of his child as well as the injuries his wife suffered,” Dupin took out a pack of his Gauloise cigarettes out of his coat pocket as well as a silver Zippo. “I like Dr. Watson very much. He is a good man.”
But more than likely, John’s injuries kept Sherlock from looking for her...
You like to wash your hair prior to straightening. Easier to blow-dry it first after a proper shampooing then apply the straight-iron.
"It’s time for you to face a bitter truth too, John. Just as bitter as the one Sherlock had to face when he realized Victor never cared for him, was ashamed of him. You can’t deny it any longer, John. Mary does not love you. What you two have is not love.”
“Why?”
“We’ll work on pronunciation more when you get back from your holiday,” Violet gave up. “Now,” she added firmly as she walked over and handed Archie the orange fizzy drink. “Just because you’re going on holiday doesn’t mean you’re not going to have homework.”
“The view,” Sherlock deadpanned.
“Oh,” he merely said as she tried to reach for one of the bottles of water, as graceful as a drunken elephant. He elegantly snatched up a bottle and twisted the lid off, handing it to her before she even noticed. “Are you going to share those thoughts?”
Mycroft thinned his lips and proceeded cautiously.
She thought she was going to die.
“We’re rich,” the little boy said haughtily. “We’ll always have maids and servants. Like you. You’re just a servant too, you know.”
How could he have felt pity for this reptile, this… monster.
Anna took the pink mug with a yellow smiley face on it from her daughter then looked at the white, chipped mug still in Harry’s hands. “Bit young for spirits, aren’t you lassie?”
His mobile vibrated again.
She felt her skin crawl… her spidey sense tingled…
The chairman started speaking. John snapped to attention.
10:04 AM London Time
John made a mental note to see if any of his medical colleagues could recommend a French psychiatrist who specialized in hoarding disorders. He had a feeling saving all those deformed strays had something to do with it as well.
All the dogs in the garage began howling and whining at the sounds of the gunshots.
She still hadn’t heard from Mary since her initial request for help. She didn’t like that. Not one little bit. But she only yelled to Sherlock “Why in the hell are we staying in this sweatbox if the A/C’s broken?” as she opened the freezer door and sighed in relief as the frosty air hit her skin.
“Honestly, you are all as bad as Greg,” Molly grizzled, although she seemed relieved Mary took the heavy tray from her. “I’m pregnant, not crippled.”
“Well, yes, I know, but this is such a luxurious gift, I couldn’t possibly accept.”
“Yeah, I need to stop that,” John rasped.
He had responded,
A muscle in Victor’s cheek twitched. His normally friendly blue eyes were decidedly unfriendly. Sherlock could tell, by the way Victor held his body, by the way he clenched his fists, if he could have gotten away with punching him in a police station, he bloody well would have.
“Indeed not,” Sherlock’s voice was deliberately and dangerously calm. “I did not risk my liberty and my safety to travel across the world to retrieve you only to have you endanger your life in the most moronic ways possible because you think there’s no hope left.”
“Experiment,” Sherlock grunted, delicately removing the globule of medicine with tweezers.
“We need to get out from underneath Mycroft’s thumb,” Violet opened her eyes, making a decision. A decision she wasn’t thrilled with, but she did not see any other viable options.
Dupin shrugged then put both hands on the wheel again, much to John’s relief. “Sherlock said he handled that possibility and I trust him that he did so. If something unexpected should occur, then I trust we’ll all adapt to the change.”
he demands or else he’s not going to be able to solve it… but,” she held up a finger then pointed it at him. “He’s not going to lift a finger until Maisie Watson is located and given back
It was another familiar voice, a soft tenor voice with a barely noticeable East End accent but with the consonants clipped like someone who had led a military life. Someone who  expected to be obeyed and yet at the same time, someone who was used to making apologies during social engagements suddenly made awkward…
Jim stopped his pacing and examined the ATM slip again.
“Perfect. Stay safe. I’ll text when I’m back at 221B,” Violet rang off. Then leaned against the wall of the hallway, looked up at the ceiling. Then she pressed the mobile against her forehead and bowed forward a little bit as she screwed her eyes tightly shut.
,” when she saw the body.
But then John had slipped away from him. As pearly morning light attempted to brighten the room through the cracks between the drapes, Sherlock could see John’s silhouette but not much else. He toyed with the idea of asking him to turn the lights on, at least the little lamp on the nightstand. But John had undressed with his usual militaristic efficiency. Sherlock stretched out on the side of the bed he had already decided was now “his” as John re-joined him. He sucked in a surprised breath when he felt John’s hands, completely steady and sound, on his bony hips, thumbs hooked into the waistband of his boxers. But he didn’t fight him; he lifted his hips up and let John peel them off with agonizing, deliberate slowness.
The Black Lotus gangster nodded eagerly. He wished to be gone as well. He finished untying the boat from the dock. Soon they were puttering away from The Copper Beaches.
“No.”
He knew it was a pathetic cover, but it was the best he could do under the circumstances. Tomorrow, he’d borrow a rookie from Surveillance and have him scour the flat, making sure there really weren’t any bugs or hidden cameras in their flat.
“Is there
“I know you’re tired mate, but drink this. It helps.”
John lifted his brows at Sherlock. “Fish?”
12:39 AM
, his treacherous body cried out. He forced his intellect to over-ride the body and its mundane wants. “No. Not only would his presence jeopardize Violet’s safety, he would also only serve as a distraction to my work. I must be completely focused with this case, John. I can’t risk any more mistakes like I have in the past, like with Magnussen and Moriarty. With the Earl involved, I can’t afford a single misstep. I trust Violet has brought you up to speed regarding how the Earl factors into all of this?”
TLD however, I will always love, even with it's flaws... come on... Mrs. Hudson speeding down the highway in her sports car with Sherlock handcuffed in the trunk? That's just amazing and I'll re-watch the shit out of that ep. :^)
John also acknowledged that he only would have teased Sherlock to hide his own jealousy.  He quickly looked away from the empty space in front of the sofa and fixed his eyes on the back of Violet’s chestnut head, dutifully following her. As he entered the kitchen, he saw the Granny Victoria’s sponge on the countertop, candles already in place. Gladstone had been snoozing on the rug in front of the sink but his big furry head lifted up when Violet and John entered. His tail thumped amiably on the floor.
“Jesus Christ,” John gagged when they entered the main room of the building.
“Our son,” Molly added quietly.
“Lounge,” Sherlock said succinctly. Violet let her rucksack drop to the floor and left the kitchen.
“Oh yes. And can we get ice cream too?”
“And your hair…. I must confess. I have a…
Dimmock picked up on her cue and immediately snapped his fingers at a forensics analyst dusting for prints on the bookshelf by the fireplace. “Get that bottle at once.”
“What? But I…” Suddenly Sherlock looked mulish, almost angry. Two spots of red actually flared up on his bone-white cheeks. “What if I’m not in love with her? What if
John had been re-reading the same sentence twice on his iPad as his foot jiggled. Meanwhile, Hope had fluttered around the kitchen, her girlhood kitchen where her mother had prepared massive meals for her enormous, boisterous family. Coffee brewed, a Bundt cake baked the oven and Hope whipped together powdered sugar, artificial almond flavoring and butter for the icing. In the Crockpot, beef tips, carrots, potatoes, peas and corn simmered in beef gravy for the evening’s meal.
“How did you know that I got you… oh never mind. Yes, of course I did.” John sighed. “I even sprang for a new tin of rosin for your bow as well.”
John laughed but then noticed that there was a very bare space in the flat. “When did he get rid of his desk and computer?”
Normally, if I base an O/C off of an ACD canon character, I like to give credit where credit is due... but if I do that for this chapter, it's a great big fat spoiler. So proper credit will have to wait 0:^)
“Nobody
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dupin turned the door knob and pushed but the door only opened a crack. “I only have what I need.”
so hellbent on getting their hands on her now?”
), he arched his back and with a shout, felt that golden haze transform into white-hot lightning, surging through his entire body, burning through all the cold spots in his heart, maybe even his soul, if such a thing as souls exist, of course.
After she pulled the mobile out of her pocket, she fumbled it. It fell to the floor with a clatter. “Fuck,” Violet mumbled, reaching under the coffee table to retrieve it. Sitting back up, mobile in hand
“Bless you Molly, but your honeymoon and baby talk distracts me. Mary, good to meet you.”
they want to hurt, to kill. I’m overlooked. I’m… I’m,” he pressed his hands to his chest now.
but can you give me the lecture later?

He jumped a little. Turned and saw Violet staring at him. Her brows crinkled in concern, her sharp eyes flicking to his mobile, then back to him.
John’s brow furrowed. Sherlock never
Victor however took Sherlock’s contempt in stride. Apparently he not only knew Sherlock, but knew him well. “It was always meant to be temporary, living in America…”
Sherlock paced back and forth in John’s room.
statue. I was staying with my brother. His parents were very nice people but they were also Italian-Catholics. Good people, but kind of old-school when it came to dating and sleepovers, if you catch my drift. It was easier to just stay with Michael than with Jordan.” Her eyes clouded over. “That’s the first time I’ve said his name since I’ve been in England.”
The agents assigned to tail John Watson confirmed that the diminutive doctor did indeed arrive in Paris, with an appointment to meet
Sherlock ignored the charge nurse following them down the hallway.
“Great, that’s great, thanks tons,” John pinched the bridge of his nose in despair.
“Oh God, don’t call me that,” Rat Boy groaned. Then to Lisbeth, he handed her a slip of paper, “This is Happy’s cell phone number. Seriously, you two should hook up if you’re ever in California.”
“Oh,” Victor fidgeted with his keys, running his thumb over the key fob.
There was an IV catheter stuck into his hand. A clear fluid flowed from the drip above.  A heart monitor was also attached to him.
“Next time, knock before you just go barging in on an assassination attempt then,” John grunted as Sherlock helped him hobble up the stairs.
Violet’s flesh-and-blood brother, Michael, the light of her life, the anchor in her tumultuous childhood, was dead. Killed by the very same people who sought Sherlock’s destruction.
“For him,” Sherlock muttered.
In the middle of the room stood Rucastle, wearing a pea-green silk kimono that had intricate floral designs stitched into the cloth with bright fuchsia and golden threads. He had his hands on his massive hips and he huffed and puffed. His bloodshot eyes brimmed with angry tears. His orange hair stuck up in tufts, as if he had been pulling it. Two pink blossoms bloomed in his cheeks. He whirled around when Toller cleared his throat, discreetly letting him know there were guests in the house.
“No,” Sally agreed before taking another drink. “That you’re not.” After another swallow, making her belly pleasantly glow from the large bolt of whisky, she added, “You were showing off a bit too, I think.”
“Gregson,” the tall, burly man with an impressive ginger moustache indeed did not waste time with pleasantries. “Your fiancée is either has brain damage or bigger bollocks than most of the men in Special Forces.”
Unable to help herself, she touched where the third bullet had caught her, a small spot about an inch above her left ear.
due to the humidity, already oppressive before the sun had even risen. Both men wore their jeans and biker boots, but they only wore the vests that the Americans derogatively called “wife-beaters.”
She was too thin, no ass, no tits. She looked like a skeleton wearing boots and jeans.
He felt that strange tightness in his chest again as he snapped, “I’m sorry?” to Dupin, screwing his face up into a scowl.
“Mary, we’re on the motorway, there’s no place
Toller swallowed hard, not sure what to do. He had been told the old biddy was important to Sherlock. “You’d… really just stand there and watch her drown?”
Baker Street, 11 o’clock tomorrow.
“What?”
enough to find the priest hole. Come on,” Violet whispered, sliding her hands along the wall to guide herself. “Let’s not wait for them to find us.”
“Anthea did ask a valid question,” Mycroft couldn’t resist poking the bear. “Why exactly are we protecting the Watson girl?”
“A what? What is that?” John tore his eyes away from Violet to stare at his wife.
“Not to
“Semantics, Sherlock. Go on. Deduce me. Am I lying when I say everything is alright?”
That and he had a horrible feeling that if they all lived at Baker Street, John and Violet would gang up on him and force him to eat healthily, monitor his caffeine intake and sleep at least five to six hours. Being force-fed a disgusting vomit green smoothie all because he hadn’t eaten in a few days still irked him.
“He’s got books and he’s got Netflix and he’s got his music,” John said shortly. “He’ll be fine.”
whenSherlock ended up dropping out after his second year because he was too strung out to attend any of his classes. Strung out because of the drugs he was getting from
John thought, loosening his tie as Violet said good-bye just as Mary came back juggling three drinks.
“At the moment, the only thing Mitton could see was the kitchen ceiling since Sherlock put the mobile on the counter. He asked, “Everyone still whole?” “Did you hear an explosion?” Sherlock called over his shoulder to his iPhone on the counter.

Jim started to chuckle. “Oh, the good doctor had a slight break with reality, I’m afraid.”
. Most of his military service had been spent in Afghanistan, after all.
Tuesday morning
The cold, remorseless  man did not view Sherlock as his sibling at all. Both John and Violet believed that Mycroft regarded his little brother as his personal property, nothing more than useful chattel, a valuable asset.
“Elegant,” Mycroft made a moue of disdain.
Today was not the day he wondered about that, however.
“Miss Smith, I presume?”
John couldn’t help but laugh a little. “You were never ordinary, even when you were ‘just’ a housewife and nurse.” Then he grimaced, pressed his hand against his abdomen.
A month later, Victor found himself in Prague with Sherlock, who looked like he had just received a reprieve from a life sentence.
“Oh yes,” Violet nodded enthusiastically, hoping the Mystery Woman wouldn’t notice she really wasn’t drinking the tea. “That’s how Mary and I met, through Mr. Holmes. If you’re concerned about us telling tales, well, my case was of the most sensitive nature.” She paused, acting like she was deliberating whether or not to disclose personal information. Then she pressed down on the Not-So-Mysterious-Mystery Woman’s pressure point. “If not for Mr. Holmes, my fiancé could have been sacked… or worse.”
“You are bluffing,” Toller meanwhile scoffed.
Flight delayed
(See the end of the chapter for
“That would be a welcome change of pace.”
“What people?”
Violet slowly circled the room again, trying to suss out what game Jim was playing.
“Oh my dear Violet, I always survive a fall, you know that.”
Once the train started moving, she threw herself at him, wrapping her arms tightly around his shoulders and throat. Startled, Sherlock sat stock-still, unused to being randomly touched after living alone again for so many months. Then he quickly deduced that his naturally extroverted former flatmate and fiancée was starved for a friendly gesture. Gingerly he put his arms around her the best he could, the dress severely restricting his movements. But he did press his cheek against hers as he whispered, “Did you honestly think you could trick
“I despise it when you act like a doctor, John.”

“Pull your head out of your ass, sir?”
with.”
She leaned forward and kissed his cheek, a cold, formal peck. Her lips barely grazed his skin. “My deepest sympathies for your loss,” she intoned in her coldest, loftiest ‘Miss Smith’ voice. Then she locked her eyes on his again, mouth firmly screwed down.
“You’re no better than Moriarty, playing with people’s lives, playing with your brother’s life.”
Violet wasn’t sure at first if Mary hadn’t noticed John’s coolness or was choosing to ignore it. She took a long drink as she watched Mary fuss over John’s injuries. She decided Mary was ignoring John’s reticence as she sat next to him, kissing his cheek, running her hand over his silvery-sandy hair as she whispered endearments and apologies.
Chapter Thirty-Six:
“Exactly so.”
“Except, it’s not about me, is it?” John ran his finger around the rim of his tumbler. “You willingly gave up two years of your life, enduring… I don’t even know what, for me, so I could live. You saved my life. A lifetime with Mary is not enough to pay you back for that sacrifice.”
“What I should have done
“Tell your brother to stop fucking around,” Adrienne spat out, harsher than usual. “Get that information from Hunter then send her happy ass back to the US.”
Still, he didn’t like it. Didn’t like being separated from his best friend, didn’t like John being on his own in a strange country, chased by two of the most dangerous men in Europe…
London, England
Her knees hit the plush carpet before Sherlock could catch her. The sob mutated into sometime grittier than a wail, more primal than a scream.
“Violet?” he called again, not sure if he was going to get “Miss Smith” or “Agent Hunter.”
His shorter legs tangled in Sherlock’s, he ran his ankle up and down Sherlock’s calf as he explored Sherlock’s back with his fingertips. Ignoring the whip marks, he focused rather on his spine, tracing his fingers up and down it one knobby vertebra at a time, making Sherlock shiver and moan as John teasingly stopped just above his waistband of his trousers then slowly slid up again as he nibbled on Sherlock’s ear while skimming Sherlock’s backside with his free hand.
"Ten days after Harry Watson’s funeral, there still had not been any movement from Julia Stoner, the Red-Headed League or Magnussen’s old blackmailing syndicate..."
He walked over to Violet as she quickly pointed the gun at him instead of her own head.
While Sherlock may have felt confident about Violet’s situation, she most certainly did not share his opinion. The gossamer skirts of her gown had gotten caught when Toller slammed the boot shut. She couldn’t do her neat trick of slipping her legs through her arms, putting her cuffed hands in front of her instead of behind her back. She tried twisting around to see if she could kick out a taillight, but it was too dark, too cramped. She couldn’t see and she could barely move. The adrenaline had completely left her body now and panic threatened to give way to hysteria. Her chest hitched as her lungs constricted, threatening to give way to hyperventilating. She couldn’t string together a coherent thought to save her life…
“Mrs. Hudson, what on earth are you doing? Let me help,” Violet took the grocery bags from Mrs. Hudson before ushering her inside.
Jim shook his head. “Denial ain’t just a river in Egypt, Sherlock.”
For an agonizing second, there was no response, no movement. Then, at last, a groan as her arm moved slowly while she removed the oxygen mask over her face. Then, in a voice just as posh and arch as one could please, Miss Smith informed her fiancé, “This is the fourth explosion I’ve had to endure since meeting you, do you realize that?”
“Ah, I see we’re no longer continuing the ‘Miss Smith’ routine in front of Mary,” Sherlock said, moving aside so Mary could enter. He felt an odd twitch in his stomach, seeing John’s wife wearing her assassin get-up again. But when she pulled off her black stocking cap, Sherlock saw Mary again instead of AGRA. “Good, the act was getting dull.”
“Yeah?”
Violet studied the card, then closed her eyes and shook her head after reading the name on the card: Mycroft A. Holmes. “Oh God,” she laughed. “Mycroft’s going to have him arrested for credit card fraud yet.” But a devilish impulse seized her. “How would you like to go visit your grandchildren properly?”
world,” she smiled tenderly as her voice became as soft as cotton wool. “Maybe this is the universe where Sherlock and John end up together and not just as best friends sharing a scruffy little flat.”
, he fumed to himself.
“Better me in prison than Sherlock being Mycroft’s puppet, don’t you think?” John crushed his empty cup then stared at the crumpled remains. “Sorry, I’m sorry, it’s just that… fuck.”
The Copper Beaches
“John, I’m fine,” a deep, annoyed voice sounded from the living room.
John finally understood, “Oh my God.”
… but mostly, he wanted to be away from Mary. She still wanted to
Sherlock stared at John as if he suddenly started speaking Portuguese.  “Why would I be angry?” he asked mildly as he took his second-favorite dressing gown off its hook.
“Oh hell yeah there is,” Honoré called as he squeezed through the heart-shaped entrance. “We’ll have to go further down the City of Bones first, but there’s another way. I recognized the hall once we got out of that tunnel. Didn’t know that route existed. Kinda cool, actually. Can’t wait to blog about it.”
Sitting in her bed-sit, surrounded by reams of papers, black-and-white photographs, newspapers and stacks of files, Donovan pulled out the biro she had absently stuck in her top-knot. She chewed on the pen as she re-read the file regarding Robert Carruthers’ death.
“What has happened?” Mary asked.
at John.
Mycroft took a deep, shuddering breath. “I have to tell you something about Ford.”
Chess Variant
Violet looked at the sole, then down at the floor. Her gorge rose again.
Sherlock nodded, “The one (and last time) I was there, there was this American socialite there, deleted her name, but she was blonde, wealthy, idiotic and too much time on her hands, a deadly combination. They let her bring her miserable little Chihuahuas. She carried them around in a massive purse. When I saw that, I worried that I was still be high. I thought she had brought rats into the facility.” When Bill laughed, Sherlock added with a roll of his eyes, “Mrs. Hudson will be fine. She’ll bore us all with tittle-tattle about the film stars she met while in Recovery.”
John half-carried, half-dragged Sherlock back to the town car parked all alone in the middle of the winding driveway. Lestrade had left ages ago, and had probably fallen asleep the minute the driver put the mini-van in gear.
“No.”
,” Archie grinned.
“Of course.”
“Once he realizes what I have to offer isn’t boring, then yes,” Dupin put his sunglasses back on and said in French, “The Louvre. I need to think.”
The women had all let him in and he had killed them before they even knew they were dead.
John looked around the large flat. The Art Deco motif was absent. The décor was simple and modern. Everything was various shades of cream, black and chocolate. There was nothing dividing the lounge from the kitchen; everything was in one giant room. And the area designated as a kitchen really couldn’t be considered a proper kitchen anyway. Just a toaster, an electric kettle, a microwave, a wine chiller and a tiny refrigerator lined up on a granite countertop. But the appliances were all very nice, stainless steel, polished to a silvery finish. Next to a small sink, there was a large ebony-colored bowl filed with fresh fruit. Next to the bowl there were two matching mugs and a small wicker basket holding several varieties of tea and sugar packets.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Violet had said as Mrs. Toller whipped around to glower at her. “Was that for Mrs. Rucastle?”
Sherlock succinctly explained the original plan, how Sherlock told Violet to blackmail Mycroft into giving her safe passage back to the United States and how Sherlock had only learned a few months ago that Violet went off-script by adding some conditions of her own.
“When is that?”
Jack crossed over to the cheap, plywood shelf stuffed with books. He switched off the radio sitting on the top shelf. He sat at the foot of Johnny’s twin bed. “Bad day, yeah?” he started, clasping his calloused hands between his knees.
“Can’t you just break his legs and call it a day? Hell, I’d even help,” Harry offered.
“Of course,” Mycroft smiled and nodded politely. “How did you get ensnared with Charles Augustus Magnussen?”
Violet had sat up then, her hair a frizzy mess. Sherlock’s news hadn’t surprised her in the least. She had strongly suspected Holy Peters had been the one snooping around her place, but now found she felt strangely lethargic, as if she didn’t have enough energy to be afraid. She felt oddly above it all, hovering above the melee, a forced participant, like someone who had to sit way up in the nose-bleed seats at a really shitty rock concert.
Sherlock felt his stomach drop to his knees.
“I know what you did.”
,” John hauled himself back up on his feet, ignoring the tearing pain in his upper arm as he popped a few more sutures. He was going to be a bloody mess when this was over, literally. “Bill,
“I’m going to go down and put the kettle on,” Susan slid off her bed. “I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep now, knowing that Mumsie had hooked up with a
She, on the other hand, was not, for once. She felt cold, wet and queasy. She sincerely hoped Moriarty would leave Holy Peters behind. She had a feeling that her hopes would be dashed.
woman outside shouting.”
“Who even has a microfiche reader anymore?” Violet suddenly remembered cussing out the cumbersome enormous metal contraptions as she tried to find old news stories she needed for her term papers. She then immediately felt very old and very tired.
The tomb next to Morrison’s was black marble, with an effigy of a cross carved into it. On top of that tomb sat a young man with short black hair but an impressive black beard. He wore a grey knitted headband over his ears, like the ones serious runners wore when jogging during bitterly cold days. He smoked cigarettes while listening to music on his iPhone, nodding his head in time with whatever tune his device was playing. He wore a thick, woolen black coat and a bright red muffler around his neck, but he still clapped his hands then rubbed them together, trying to stay warm. Something caught his attention on the other side of Jim Morrison’s grave. The young man pulled an ear bud out of his ear and said, “
“Don’t,” Victor said immediately.
Mycroft Holmes frowned at his mobile when he realized he was listening to John Watson’s voice mail message and not to the man himself.
He looked at his opponent. An overweight, hedonistic, sexist twat… yes, he might be a most devious kidnapper and murderer but still…
“It was,” John said firmly. “You were talking in your sleep.”
John noticed he looked green about the gills. “Sherlock?” John called out but Sherlock garbled out, “Washroom?”
He clenched and unclenched his left hand. His own goddamn tremor had come back too.
“Drinking to sabotage your career will notl absolve you of the guilt you feel for defending criminals,” Sherlock intoned, naturally unable to keep his deductions to himself.
“November…
8:15 PM
Her belly flopped over. Mary gripped the barrel of the gun tightly and continued creeping down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, she turned to her left, knowing the vision she would be presenting to her husband. She knew she must look terrifying.
Mycroft ignored John. “Violet, they want the information Moriarty gave you.”
“Following you now?”
John felt a distinct twinge of discomfort. The last time they broke in somewhere, looking for incriminating documents, Sherlock had gotten shot…
Chicago, Illinois
Sherlock strode into the north entrance, John tailing him as usual. He took a hard right and stalked into the Gents. John halted, rolled his eyes heavenward and followed. As usual.
, she touched her bleeding face. Her lip felt puffy and her nose hurt. She wondered if she had splinters in her face. She ran her tongue over her teeth, relieved not to find any of them loose.
John watched as Sherlock’s eyes widened and his lips disappeared in a thin line. His already alabaster skin turned to the color of a sun-bleached bone.
“Thanks,” Violet said “So is yours.”
Unlike Sherlock and John, she knew exactly who was setting her up, or at least, which federal agency. Felt it in her bones, in her heart, in her soul, in the very core of her being. Sherlock would have scolded her for using emotion instead of logic to solve that mystery.
“I will hit you.”
“Blackmail?”
, she realized grimly.
For some ridiculous moment, he had honestly thought he was going to Baker Street.
“You’re mad,” Mary breathed. “You’ve murdered more than just those three girls. You’re all serial killers. The lot of you.”
“Thank you,” was all she said. In the distance, she could hear the wailing of sirens, the unique sound only European police and ambulances made. “Better hurry,” she added conversationally, “Before a different car comes to fetch you.”
Violet let it go. “I take it you have your supplies in that rucksack?” When Mary nodded, Violet added, “And that you’re not wearing… that.”
The Earl’s eyes immediately watered with pain and he recoiled from Sherlock, reaching up with his clawed, pink-and-white hand as if to rip the hypersensitive flesh from his face.
“We both know that’s not true.” He tucked the photo into the bodice of her ruined frock.
memory come from?
He wished he could have gone with Sherlock, Mary and Violet instead.
“Understandable,” Mycroft sat up.
But instead of up the stairs to 221B, Sherlock guided John towards Mrs. Hudson’s flat.
Sherlock whirled around, his Belstaff flapped behind him. He saw Dupin and Honoré running towards John. He was several paces behind them all, his torch-light still shining on the graffiti-covered CROIX-ROUGE sign.
“Of course, he wants the Moriarty Code. Since I refuse to hand it over to him, he’ll go after her. Also,” here Sherlock sniggered, in that odd yet endearing manner of his whenever he found something truly amusing, “He wants the fifty million pounds.”
“Mm, yeah,” John grunted as he disappeared down the hallway towards the master bath.
“What? Are you pulling my chain, lady?” Rude Analyst gawped. “You’re not even a cop and you’re sure as hell not Sherlock Bloody Holmes.”
Saturday night
Extremely Dangerous Fact: Mary continues to search for Marissa even though she has reason to believe my brother had the infant abducted.
Clad in the plush white dressing gown and slippers the hotel provided for their penthouse guests, he sipped his tea as the events of the last few weeks rolled around in his head.
“Did they catch the killer?” Professor Moriarty started strolling around the expansive lounge.
“This can’t be good,” John groaned as Sherlock continued to chivvy everything towards the pool. “What did you find?” A horrid thought flashed through his head. He felt the weight of a Semtex-loaded vest across his shoulders and chest again. “You found explosives.”
depends on what you find.
, he had replied, his voice barely a breath,
Lugging a heavy rucksack full of surveillance equipment, Sally Donovan humped the burden up the flight of stairs that led to the backdoor. She punched in the after-hours security code and shoved the door open with her shoulder.
Rucastle laughed a loud, hearty, fake laugh.
“Jesus Christ!” the High and Mighty shop clerk yelped.
Sherlock inhaled. “Possibly.”
It was the look of pure panic on his best friend’s face.
“Been broken for a few days now, actually.”
She picked at her food during dinner. The protein bars and dried fruit she had devoured in Sherlock’s room paled in comparison to the rich, seafood feast Toller and his assistant (the same one from last night, who had the Black Lotus tattoo on his wrist) brought out. She nibbled on what she could, watching Sherlock for clues. Whatever he helped himself to, she did as well. But she firmly stuck to water.
“Yeah, and you’re blocking my shot,” she puffed as she pushed past him. She hurried down the steps, pulling her hood over her curly brown hair again. Blood coursed down her scraped face.
I detest repeating myself.
joking, Violet. Rage at me all you like as you have every right to do so. Do not take your umbrage out on John. We’re the only family he has left.” Sherlock played his trump card. “And he loves you, dearly. His levels of guilt will skyrocket once he realizes how deeply his actions have hurt you.”
“Then pick up your toys,” Violet kept her voice calm and firm. “And apologize to me for being rude and for biting me.”
“You spoil him,” John sighed as he made himself comfortable. “Come here,” he asked again. He refrained from patting the seat next to him, but he did add a very soft, “Sherlock, please.”
“Oh, she’s
28 November 2015
, she thought, clutching the half-full cup. “Mary, to put it bluntly, found out her baby was up for sale and lost her shit.”
“Uh… older lady. Tall… err, tall-ish. Blonde. Looked dead scary but was really sweet.”
“I tried to un-do it,” Mary swayed on her feet.
He also miserably realized that he could not let Mary go to prison. Not now.
“I want every single agent monitoring my brother replaced. We need new eyes,” he ordered her. “He’s obviously up to something and John Watson is clearly his pawn, as usual. I want you to report to Lausanne at once. Make arrangements for me to follow. I actually have some work to do first that takes priority over my idiot brother.”
His breathing changed to rasps as Victor started fumbling with his shirt buttons. He shivered as he felt Victor’s lips and tongue and teeth on his throat. Sherlock’s hands suddenly had little minds of their own: sliding down Victor’s back, then slipping underneath the t-shirt, relishing the feel of the smooth skin against his roughened hands. He felt Victor respond, heard him sigh, felt him press himself against Sherlock, his hands running up and down the sides of Sherlock’s bare torso now that Sherlock’s shirt flapped wide open. Victor ran fingertips down the outside of Sherlock’s legs then back up his bare abdomen again... teasing him, torturing him…
which at first glance appeared to be a biography of Cicely Neville, the mother of the much-maligned King Richard III. However the book caught Sherlock’s interest because it supposedly debunked the popular theories about the infamous deaths of the Two Princes in the Tower during the War of the Roses. Sherlock was no history buff, but he did love a good mystery.
“There she is,” Rucastle boomed when he saw Violet. “That gown is from my 2012 collection.”
“Hello Ford,” she murmured, plucking an old school photograph from out the box.
No baby ever came.
As Sherlock slunk away, Lestrade had called after him, reminding him that he needed to question Sherlock, to document how he had made his deductive leap from the Earl’s offhand comment about boxing John’s ears to determining that Jimsie Browner had been the Cardboard Box Murderer (as the tabs had gleefully just named him.)
A hiccup who wasn’t biologically his...
Sherlock narrowed his eyes but he kept his voice deceptively calm. “You demand that I tell you everything about my past. You want to know all about what happened to me during my Great Hiatus and my,” his long face twisted in revulsion, “gruesome childhood. Yet, you have never told me one solitary thing about your childhood or Afghanistan.”
Paris, France
“We’re not getting a monkey.”
She gave him a timid smile. “You smell kind of bad.”
Then there was a picture of Jim Moriarty laughing, the same picture that had terrorized London on New Year’s Day 2015. The graphic that had saved Sherlock’s life, saved him from exile in Serbia, saved him from…
Violet’s profiler’s eyes saw and recorded everything.
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Holmes stripped off the rubber gloves and tossed them into the now shining sink. “It’s not as if I cleaned the cooker or the refrigerator. Or defrosted the freezer.”
Helped him not dwell on how Victor hadn’t called since he stormed out well over a week ago.
“One moment, sir,” and then he was listening to Muzak again.
“Anger and love are powerful motivators, John,” Sherlock murmured. “Emotion is dictating Greg’s actions right now. You’re wasting your time discussing the matter with him,” he reached for his shoes. Tying the laces, he added in a subdued voice, “And there’s nothing
So... I think I'm procrasti-posting because we're getting so close to the end, only five chapters left! :^0
She quickly gave the address to the cabbie. “Hurry,” she added all the while thinking
And thank God he did. The minute Mycroft laid eyes on Victor Trevor; he knew the good-looking golden boy was not Sherlock’s friend…
“Of course, of course,” Anthea muttered as her face pinkened. As she uncuffed Noelie, her gut churned as she imagined explaining this fiasco to Mycroft.
You want to throw my transgressions with Victor at me then am I allowed to remind you of your dismal track record regarding relationships? Shall I point out how you have been unable to maintain a long-term relationship after Jordan’s death? The exception being the verbally abusive boyfriend you  endured an on-again, off-again relationship with when you  lived in New Mexico? He was the one you drew your weapon on because he tried to upgrade the abuse from verbal to physical, yes?” His eyes flashed, “Your exact description of him was: ‘an asshole who broke my heart but I kept running back to him, time and time again,’ was it not?” As he watched her face flush in anger he added, “And you also said that you only stopped running back to him because he thinks you are dead. Perhaps Jordan was not the example I should have used,” he finished nastily.
Quickly, she helped Sherlock unload the car and together they darted inside.
“They’re in a glass case!”
The few attempts he had made talking to other students had also been incredibly discouraging. As soon as he deduced what they were really thinking about him, he’d abruptly terminate the conversation and stalk off.
Sherlock laughed, a rare sound, like a bell suddenly ringing in an abandoned church. He tucked his long, elegant hands into the pockets of his dressing gown as he rocked back and forth on his bare feet. “Heaven forbid we don’t mind our manners in the throes of passion.”
“It was never supposed to work, at least, the bit about demoralizing Holmes into such a torpor that he gives up detective work and goes to live in the county with his gay lover. That was too convoluted and quite frankly, too ridiculous to have worked. However, the bit about dropping dead weight, Rucastle and the Tollers,
Wednesday evening
“Give John a big wet smooch for me.”
“Sherlock,” John waved the mobile at him when the Great Detective turned around.
“Can’t imagine why,” John glanced at the bulging black rubbish bags in the corner near the fireplace and tried very hard not to imagine what could be inside them.
“Violet, I…” but he could only shake his head, bereft for words.
Then the eyes hardened, became their usual impenetrable wall.
“Oh God,” Janine pressed her cheek against Alby’s furry head.
Unfazed, Donovan crossed her arms. “Did you ever meet Miss Violet Smith?”
name and not only will you give my Marie justice,” he pressed his ringed hand to his chest, over his heart. “But you will finally slip Mycroft’s chains once and for all.” He then started twisting his hat in his hands. “I had hoped for more time, I wanted to teach you a new way to think. Mycroft seems to always be one step ahead of you because he molded you. As a child, you imprinted on your big brother like a gosling does a mother goose. You imitated him, you learned by his example. He anticipates your every move because it’s the same move he would have made in the same situation.”
He grinned. “I always liked you, Sally. No bullshit about you.” He slapped the table for emphasis and went to place their orders. Soon he returned, carrying another gin and tonic as well as a pint of pale ale. “Put in an order for the Fisherman’s Platter too. Figured we could share,” he glanced down at his protruding belly. “Need to lose a few pounds before the next physical.”
She knew he had terrorized and ritualistically brutalized Sherlock when he had been a little boy. She knew the Earl, while not the only reason, was one of the big reasons  Sherlock shied away from intimate relationships, physical and emotional.
“I know, and you’re doing aces, but well, it’s just quicker for me,” Mary knelt next to his armchair and held up his mobile. “For me to fetch the phone rather than you. Besides,” she gave him a bashful smile. “You took such good care of me while I was in hospital and afterwards, I just figured it was my turn.”
“Yeah, they do,” John contradicted him serenely.
“Lovely weather for it,” Mycroft said quite sarcastically. Violet tugged on Gladstone’s leash. In tandem, the agent and the police dog took a step back as Mycroft opened his car door. Violet watched him slowly getting out of the car, wincing as he did so. She fantasized about shooting him in the back as he reached back in to retrieve his umbrella.
The physical pain maybe was diminishing. The emotional pain, John feared, was just beginning for  both of them. Still he smiled at her compliment, not sure if she was humoring him or if she really meant it. Either way, he felt flattered. He squeezed her hand back.
“A bit, yeah. Not that it was terribly exciting, but it was nice. You?”
“OK,” Lestrade put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “OK,” he gave the shoulder a squeeze.
She knew better.
He searched for was any evidence of the two boys Maggie claimed to have. The children could possibly be part of the cover story. However, children were initiated into the

“Well… no. But what happened?” Green ran his hand over his bald head while Trager and Rat Boy snuffed out their cigarettes and ran to follow Chibs’ orders.
printed across it. A rolled-up newspaper was under her armpit, “Hey-hey.”
“Melodrama is so unattractive, Victor,” Sherlock sighed. “I have my own family drama to sort out, Victor. I have no desire to get ensnarled into yours because you chose to be dishonest. You choose to let your father continue manipulating you.” He licked his finger and dramatically turned the page. “You’re not going to be able to keep me a secret forever.”
“I know Mary wants to work things out. But if you and Mary do split up…”
“Oh so you do plan on growing up then? How nice.”
Sunday morning
He waited, letting John sip at his drink, cataloging everything he observed about his best friend. He was aware he was treating John like a potential client now. He didn’t mean to, it was simply force of habit.

Magnussen, was one of the few people Sherlock had actively hated. Mary should have just gotten rid of Magnussen that night instead of shooting Sherlock. Would have saved the good tax-payers of England some money as well as rid the world of a megalomaniac monster. Plus Sherlock would have kept her secret. But oh no, he did the job for her instead. Almost threw his life away for her and her husband… all because Sherlock

Despite all the coffee she had consumed, she had nodded off in Lestrade’s chair.
“Ja, denk you,” she bowed her head, the mousy hair dyed an oily-black.
Harry had been buried next to her mother, in their father’s plot. The grave site next to Anna Watson had been vacant but paid for future occupancy. John wasn’t sure which Holmes brother pulled what strings, but the previous owner gave up that spot for John and Mary.
, she fumed, annoyed to be interrupted from her search again. She didn’t know whether  to be impressed or irritated how well Violet Fucking Hunter hid all that stolen money. According to Sherlock, she was no master hacker.
“Aw,” Rucastle smiled indulgently. “You have a kind heart. But forgive my rudeness, this must be the Watsons. I say, what happened to your leg Dr. Watson?”
