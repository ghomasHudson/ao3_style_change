“What the heck!” Lisa says, pointing suddenly, and Dean looks up and sees Jo and Ellen pointing back and laughing at them from a table inside of the Applebee’s.
Dean blinks. “Pensacola?”
“You could let me do everything,” is Castiel’s growled counteroffer, and his mouth is back, biting hot and insistent along the line of Dean’s neck. “Let me, Dean. Please?”
He’s ignored on all counts, and scoffs while he thinks they can still hear him. Stomps to the back hall closet to make sure they can still hear him, depositing cats on chairs and pulling the coat all the way off as he goes.
“Holy shit, no,” Dean says from end of the hallway. “No.
he yells up the chimney as he yanks on the damper, and gets a faceful of flaking creosote for his troubles. The inspector had cleared all the fireplaces in the house as aged but unlikely to suffocate them or catch fire, which Dean should have realized didn’t guarantee the
Though he doesn’t mean to— has a to-do list a mile long that gets longer every time he notices a new crack in the plaster or a dead lightbulb stranded at the top of some ornate chandelier or another— Dean spends the majority of Sunday in the drafty east hall, trying get a fire going in the six-foot grate.
“And you need to help me move auntie’s tree downstairs,” Dean says, because that thing is making him depressed just looking at it. “Let’s go.”
Dean is dutifully civil and circumspect through the rest of the parking process, even to the dickbag PT Cruiser that steals his primo space next to the elevators. Dean’s always hated those cars, the ugly, slanty little bastards. He throws the Impala into park and is out of the car in the next half second, then has to wait what feels like an ice age for Castiel to unbuckle his seatbelt, open the door, slide his legs out and stand.
“So, not essential,” Dean says. “Come on, take it off. I like to see who I’m dancing with.”
“You could hold my elbow,” Castiel says worriedly. “Or we could go sit down inside—”
Changing the bedding becomes a necessity after that, and while Dean’s at it he grabs his own laptop and the cord to bring into bed with them. “I’m not watching any claymation reindeer,” Dean says, taking control of the touchpad immediately while they resettle together, under pale winter sun and the smell of dryer sheets. “John McClane or bust.”
He catches Castiel around the waist, plucks the knife out of his hand and sets it down. Castiel lets him with a general air of bafflement, and squints suspiciously as Dean tangles their fingers and pulls him into his body. “Dean—”
“Fuck you,” Dean says, heartfelt, and both of them laugh meanly.
“Christmas lights. Something for the trees, too— any hardware stores in that pile?”
Dean drops the knife and reaches for Castiel, and grips back just as hard when Castiel’s strong fingers close around his. He feels the contact like a shock up his arm; the pulse in his ears beats cupped in their palms, too— steady, even, getting louder.
3. Don't use Norfolk pines for your Christmas tree. It's just not what nature intended.
He goes upstairs with two mugs steaming in his hands, anticipating a surly welcome from either the upstairs office or from under several layers of bedding in the master suite. The office is empty, though, and the bedroom vacant except for Nabokov and Rosie’s calico sprawl across the sheets. The cats blink sleepily at him as he settles the mugs on the already-crowded bedside table, and Rosie accepts the stroke he gives her with a yawn and flexing paws. She’s the last kitten standing, the rest of them safely rehoused with friends before Halloween, and she’s a bit of a spoiled brat.
Under the blast of a holiday toy commercial, Dean says softly, “It’s been a long day. You’re sure?”
A day later, Castiel brings home a Norfolk pine in a pot covered in red foil and positions it carefully next to the growing card collection on the kitchen counter. It comes with a few tiny plastic ornaments strung here and there, and a perfunctory gold star tied to the top. It looks so much like Charlie Brown’s miserable twig of a tree Dean could cry.
taste,” Castiel mutters. There’s a few more seconds of rustling, then silence.
Sam raises an eyebrow. “... rock-paper-scissors you for it.”
“Take off the headgear,” he says, impulsively.
“I’ll just be—” Castiel shouts over the noise, pointing at the Barnes and Noble and adjoining café, like it isn’t also bursting at the seams with families and strollers and, yikes, live music.
Turns out waffles and bacon works just as well, and Sam and Cas talk like normal, slightly nervous people who haven’t really met but really want to like each other, and Dean steals the crossword out from under Castiel’s elbow when he isn’t looking. He doesn’t have a scrapbook, but there’s a secret filing cabinet in the upstairs office with a flattened cupcake box and a crumpled newsletter where he thinks it might keep just fine.
He’s propping up a card from Benny’s mom when he sees something else lying alongside the small collection. It’s one of those photo slips with text across the bottom, a portrait of a family Dean doesn’t recognize, though all four of them have dark hair and blue eyes. His suspicions are confirmed when he leans over and reads,
“Hey, I’m working on that heater.” The house might be cold, but Castiel’s skin is warm from the water and Dean takes a moment to luxuriate in that, leaning on him while he waits for sleep to clear a little more. Castiel accepts the extra weight and the second kiss Dean brushes over his shoulder with a content hum, and lifts his chin for the next pass.
“That a threat, buddy?” Dean says, staring hard into those empty sockets.
she says, and spins on one deadly heel. Within a few steps she’s finished the whiskey, picked up another, and has joined a group of people who immediately make room for her, charming smile as perfectly in place as her makeup.
“It’s winter,” Castiel protests, hand going to his back where Dean’s lips had been. “The house gets cold.”
Dean hates her a
“You gonna show me?” Dean asks under his breath, smiling sideways at him, and Castiel shakes his head violently.
“Don’t come,” Castiel pleads, three fingers sinking in slowly, luxuriously where Dean’s so slick and open he can feel himself dripping. It’s mortifying and it’s making his entire body throb, blood-warm and oversensitive like a new bruise. “Just a little longer, I promise.”
“Dean?” Castiel asks from somewhere behind him. “Are you awake?”
“Oh,” Castiel says, caught in the act of rubbing his hands together. “Uh.”
“Where the hell do they even come from?” he asks, trying to shield his face from the stinging drops while he cranks the Impala’s window shut as fast as he can. “I swear I didn’t bring all this with me, and somehow I have a hard time picturing you shopping at— is that Toys-R-Us?”
Sam lifts his head to give Dean an incredulous look. “Yeah? The one five miles back with no roof, or the one five miles after that with one wall standing?”
“Should we get closer?” Sam asks in a low voice, right at Dean’s shoulder. Like Dean, he’s keeping deliberately short of the clear space around the fire, eyeing the scene with his boots crusted over in snow and hands shoved deep in his pockets.
“You are the cutest fucking thing,” Dean tells him. He has his face buried shamelessly in Castiel’s neck, soaking in his warmth, the way he doesn’t mind Dean’s cold hands splayed over his skin. “And you worry too much. Cas, Jesus. Even if they hated you— which they
It seems to be a postcard, the front of it a shiny photograph of a flamingo with a forked branch tied to its head and a clown nose on its beak. The back reads,
“You keep shrinking, we’ve got to get you to that doctor,” Sam says, dimpled and tan and gangly as fuck, Jesus, Dean’s missed him. He knows he’s grinning like a crazy person but Sam’s here and Dean
Castiel opens his mouth, then seems to reconsider. “In the figurative sense, I would never be so crude. In the literal sense, I believe there was an implicit promise in asking me to wear these horrible things. Was there not?”

“Good,” Sam says, not looking up.
“Fucking
He blows into the accounting department with a wink for Ambriel’s owlish stare and Hester’s grumbled, “This
“Wow,” Dean says to the still night, breath rising in a plume of fog.
He misses it a little, and he doesn’t. He’s been asking Benny and Victor to take more of the client-hosted stuff this year, but he’s been Talbot Boston’s creative rep for too long to give it up in one go. Like the soiree he’d attended last night— pretty standard fare: a hotel lobby and an open bar that had graciously refilled Dean’s seltzer for the two hours he’d spent there, wondering why what used to be simple was now a such a chore.
Dean could have told Cas not to worry; Sam will never rag on anyone else if Dean’s available, and the ammo Dean’s given him is far too good to pass up the opportunity. “That’s not what I said, shut up.”
True to his word, Dean looks out;  spotting Jack sprinting around the flowerbeds, bouquet in hand. Claire and Kaia are trailing after him, curious, as Jack holds the bouquet to the flowers in the flowerbed, probably pointing out the different colours. Whatever it is, Claire finds it hilarious.
“Huh,” Dean inspects the barrel of his gun. “S’pose gutting the devil would count.”

They stare at each other.
Dean presses the phone to his ear.
Dean's phone vibrates. He's buried under a pile of arts and crafts activities, and
Dean is thrown, landing on his back with a loud grunt. The class erupt in giggles.
Cas just looks at him, somewhat darkly. He downs the rest of the drink. Charlie and Dean just stand there, as though waiting for Castiel to just drop there and then on his face. Castiel looks between them some bemusement.
She adds ‘upbringing’. The whole room falls to deathly silence, distinctly lacking in the ambient yawn and shuffle of stationary from drowsy students. Naomi only realises as she turns back around.
It's not often that Dean finds himself fast asleep in a place that is not his own—once he'd gotten used to the apartment that Sam and he had moved in together Dean had immediately done what Sam had dubbed as
Dean clenches his fists, nails digging in his palm.  Azazel shifts slightly, and Dean nearly startles before realising that Azazel had pulled out a...guitar?
Anna looks at him, handing Jack a tall glass cup. Jack frowns in concentration. "I'm grown up enough now! I've drank from them before!"
"Give me my son back, you son of a bitch." Castiel growls.
He straightens up as two people he doesn't recognise enter the room. A small boy with brown hair, swooping over one side of his face and cut neatly. He grips onto what he's only assuming is his dad's hand—a tall, dark haired man, lips pressed together as he sweeps the room, even more cautious than his son. They both certainly
Pulling the hood up on his robes, he pushes the door open with a small creak, the bells on the door tingling as Cas leaves.
Dean tries to think if he remembers that. He just remembers fire, and how wet his feet were after running outside.
"You okay there, Dean?" She asks, hurriedly. Dean nods weakly, before he pushes himself to his feet. He turns, staggering.
Sam nods, then pauses with a frown. "What do you mean, 'to light?’"
Cas gives Jack a forehead kiss. He picks him up, placing him back on the floor, and gives him a nudge. “I think they’ll be excited to see you back.” He motions. Jack wobbles as little as he turns, but is running out of the door again as soon as he steps away.
“What?”
Desperately trying to grasp his wand well enough to aim at the sky, panic consumes him as he realises just how many of the things there are. Hundreds, maybe. He vaguely recalls learning the counter charm, while still in school, and remembers producing one—
claim was at the  request of his students; a lie that fell apart after knowing him longer than five minutes.
“Hey,” Jody reaffirms. “You’re going to be
He’s still trying to look at Jack, but upon having no other choice, glances at Dean. He forces a smile. “Of course.”
Softly, Castiel reaches out a hand, brushing his fingers along the dashboard. “She is also stunning.”
Dean frowns at him through the mirror. "Whaddya mean?"
Dean slides on the bench next to Cas, and leans against him. He slides an arm along the back of the bench, and ignores the ache in his thighs.
"Yeah?"
Dean runs a hand down his back, and Cas pulls away. Fingers brush at Dean's jawline, and he feels himself smile as Cas kisses him one last time. "Night, Dean."
Before Dean can open his mouth, Cas reaches his hand out, palm placing on Dean's cheek. Dean's lips split open in a small 'o' at the gentle warmth cupping his face. He sighs, relieved.
Anna pulls down her sunglasses as the car rumbles off, leaning beside the building.
“Hey there, Jack. You ready to go home?”
“Michael, I’m not the enemy—”
His phone rings. He shouldn't, but he glances at it as he's still driving, and his breath catches in his throat as he doesn't recognise the number. Quickly pulling up, he answers it.
Castiel merely nods. “As you were, brother.”
Castiel slows down, looks up at Dean. “I never said that she had passed,” he murmurs with a frown.
“And you did that by giving him chocolate, yeah?”
How much of himself does Castiel choose?
, not goin' toe to toe against Lucifer. There's nothin wrong with taking it easy--"
"What makes you think that?"
Cas doesn't hang around to listen, however. He pushes himself out of Sam and Dean's way, leaving the courthouse without so much as a goodbye. Both brothers stand there, watching him go.
Castiel looks up as he takes the paper from Dean, glancing for a moment down at the paper. He looks back at Dean, with a soft frown. “I’m really sorry---”
Sam's suddenly looking at him as though he knows something Castiel doesn't, so Castiel quickly glances down at the array of papers on the desk. He’s not used to having that gaze turned back on him.
Castiel nods quietly, unable to take his eyes off Dean, and steps out of his house.
The Professor’s sentence has the rest of the class bubble in hurried murmurs, and Naomi tangles with dragging the class into silence.
“Seriously, how the hell are we going to get up there?” Dean mumbles against his lips, lifting a hand to his face. Castiel turns to kiss his palm, then back to his mouth with more intent. Dean is all about that, and is sliding his hand behind Castiel’s head and to urge him further down when the ready lips against his pull abruptly away.
Dean watches snowflakes skitter across the windshield, shoulders hunched up to keep his neck warm. Outside, the light is already sliding from pearl grey to slate. It’ll be dusk soon. “We could get out and walk back to the houses we saw on the way.”
Their destination is the commons, where foodtrucks line up along the sidewalks even in the worst blizzards. There’s a good selection of them out today despite the snow: the obligatory lobster and barbeque, but also pho, arepas, ramen, bahn mi, crepes, and one particularly ballsy ice cream van.
“And what is the plan, then?” Castiel says, eyes dropping to the giant, lopsided bow Dean’s tied around the apron. He slides a few fingers under the lacy fabric and tugs lightly.
Castiel examines the spill of glossy paper across the seat and his legs, some of it falling into the footwell as they pull up in the dark stall. “Probably.”
Missouri
to be a quiet place,” as he passes her. The cubicles down here never get any nicer but all the way in the back is Castiel’s cluttered and at this point cupboard of an office, the man himself turning towards the door as Dean comes up to lean on the jam.
“The base is too narrow. That thing is supposed to slot into a pole or something,” Dean says. He swabs one more time, and then grabs the bandaid box from the sink. “We could stick it in the ground, but short of that, I can’t think of anything would make it stable enough. And do you really want to have to haul it all the way downstairs, and then all the way back up again?”
You can thank me any time for sacrificing my lunch break and any chance I had to try the new mac and cheese truck to go
He sounds amazingly unenthused by the idea. Dean loves him so, so much. “I promise— it’ll be your best New Year’s in a long time,” he says, coming up behind Castiel to kiss the one inked branch that pokes out above his collar. “Maybe ever. Trust me?”
“Yeah, well, if the TV goes full portal I’m letting it take you, asshole,” Dean says, throwing his wipe rag at him. “Sic ‘em, girl!”
None of them, not even Jo— who can and does give New York cabbies a run for their money— wants to drive into Manhattan on a December weekend. The whole crowd drops their stuff at Bobby’s and walks down to the Flushing station to take the 7 line instead, popping out on Fifth Avenue and immediately hitting a human wall around the best of the department store windows.
Dean puts his eyes back on the road but lays an arm across the seat, hand conveniently at just the right height to ruffle Castiel’s hair. “Yeah?”
Dean’s been staring blearily over Sam’s shoulder into almost-total darkness for what feels like forever when he sees it. He slowly straightens, leaning forward across the seat.
As they walk back past the famous public library, Ben running on ahead and Bobby trudging behind, Castiel’s cold fingers finds his sleeve; then his wrist; then his hand, and thread themselves between his own fingers.
The circle swings wide, and someone else bumps into his free side. Dean looks over, then up, and Sam gasps, “Next stop we fill up the gas can,“ half-smothered by the pipes that have risen above the drumbeats.
” Dean yells after them, Nabokov’s diesel purr rumbling against his chest. “It’s Christmas in five days! No one should be working! Or writing papers!”

Castiel gives him a dark look, but it softens slightly under Dean’s smile. “I might,” he allows. “Provided the cookie is chocolate chip.”
,” Sam counters. “Do you really want to try your luck in this?”
“Oh, we’re going dancing,” Dean tells Charlie over coffee. “Dusk til dawn.”
Castiel nods. “It’s… peaceful.”
Sam narrows his eyes, adjusting the gloves on his broom. Dean can see that they're shaking, even now. "You're in a good mood. Feeling confident?"
“Uh— yeah.” Dean acknowledges, rather glumly. He makes note somewhere in the back of his mind about Michael's behaviour. “Not exactly about me, though. I was, going to ask a favour — I know you’ve saved my life and everything, but I know you’ll do a good job—”
ungracefully; Sam has the element of surprise though, so it doesn't take long for Sam to have him pinned, triumphantly sitting on his stomach. Dean wheezes.
And to barebones, who basically created most of this world with me. Thank you. <3
Dean steps towards the bed and places the book down for a moment on the bedside table. He slowly settles into the chair. He watches the other male, for a few moments.
He'd been dumped ceremoniously on a concrete floor, hands and feet bound with what were industrial cable ties, if the uncomfortable digging in his skin was anything to go by. The metallic tang of iron draws up his nose.
Jack looks up suddenly, blinking very hard in surprise at seeing his kindergarten teacher there. "Mr... Mr Winchester?" He tries, after a few moments. Dean gives him a large grin.
“Just — Just get
Fun fact: A decent portion of this chapter was written at a cafe called The Elephant House, which is where JK Rowling wrote a substantial amount of the Harry Potter books. Yes, I felt like such a nerd doing it. Yes, I was absolutely geeking out.
With a frown, Dean pushes open his brother’s door.
“Yes.”
“Knocking is usually customary for my students.”
tall man. Sam looms over him, a little apologetically, while they stand awkwardly outside Gabriel's bar.
Warning: Stranger Danger.
,” Cas hisses. “Are you alright?”
Castiel is silent for a long, long moment. “Lucifer is a selfish, egotistical little bitch.” He mutters, and Dean raises an eyebrow.  “He’ll only want Jack just to further himself, and considering what I’ve seen him do to other relationships of varying kinds, I--” Cas squeezes his eyes shut for a moment, and takes a deep breath. “I… I can’t let that happen to Jack, even
Technically, Cas shouldn't have his phone on his person while he's behind the counter at the gas station. But it's the middle of the night. And He trusts Dean, he does. It's just…
"Was Lucifer. Yeah, I know."
He glances at the book. He reaches for it.
Cas walks to his car, silent.
Sam is still watching Michael when he finally meets his gaze.
“I suppose we’ll find out. Is there a quill I can borrow?”
“Michael seems worried that Cas is being distracted by you.”
Michael eyes Sam for a moment, before looking back to Cas. “I was hoping you would be an ally.”
I’m officially announcing a school---wide tournament, as a symbol of partnership between Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, and to allow us to come together and celebrate in times that may otherwise call us to run and hide. This tournament shall be run like this; there will be a representative from the school — one selected from the student selection, and one from the staff, and there will be one from our small entourage of Ministry staff members. There will be a few select challenges that will take place over the first week of November, and the winner shall earn a small monetary prize alongside the honour of their respective groups.
Chalk scratches on the blackboard, the only sound echoing throughout the tired classroom. A post-lunch class never boded well for any student; many sit with half closed eyes, doodling idly on their notes. The Professor, Naomi, drops their chalk with some fanfare. Some of the students startle.
Castiel glances up just as he’s about to reach for the snitch, and Dean feels panic rise as he realises that Cas isn’t moving out of the way.
Dean steps into the room alone. As the door is closed behind him, the stifled ambience of the rest of the ward dissipates as quickly as he enters. He grips at the book and helplessly looks around the room. Bare. White. A hospital room. In the centre is a bed with a chair beside it.
“Yeah, but, you just don’t talk about someone’s family like that when they don’t know anythin’. ‘S not as though it’s hard on you as is, with all the other students sayin’ things about you too.”
Castiel stares at Jack. His mind phases into Kelly, and how she'd smile at him so
"Hey kid, you're gonna strangle the pencil. Why don't you give it some room to breathe?"
“Da--Dadd--y-” Jack sobs. Dean ducks out of the fridge, straightening up to see what drama is unfolding behind him. Castiel has already turned towards the child. It didn’t take someone with intelligence to decipher what the issue was.
Dean shrugs, despite Cas being unable to see. "Hey man, it's no problem. Guy seemed like a creep. Hope you don't have too much trouble with him."
Cas smiles at him, and Dean feels warmth bloom in his chest. He places his hand over Dean’s, for just a moment. “Thank you, Dean. I… appreciate it. Truly.”
"He'll be alright. Seems like a good kid."
As the room grows in rumour and conspiracy, Dean kicks a stool over, and strides out of the room.
“Dude! Coulda knocked me off!”
excited," she states, before turning to look back at Chuck. Chuck looks at Bobby. He holds up a whistle.
," Cas urges, appearing between them. "Leave it."
He leans forward on his broom, increasing his speed a little to lengthen the distance, and spins around on his broom.
He clenches his fist, and pours the mix into a vial on the desk. While doing so he pretends to slip and most of the equipment on his desk go rolling onto the floor, and he kneels down to gather them up. Voices rise with a few of the students beginning to murmur, and he can hear the heavy soles of Crowley’s shoes click on the wood as he walks over.
“You’re teaching students about that?” Dean whispers.
Castiel nods, and his hand gently squeezes Dean's arm. With one last glance, Cas turns and enters the house in silence. The door closes behind him with a soft click, and Dean watches, alone.
A pause. Cas smirks with eyes only. "You know I'm not affected by outside temperatures. And if I let this vessel fall below a certain temperature, it wouldn't function."
The audience in the stands fall into a hushed silence; waiting.
Cas grunts, holding the shield, and Dean feels his chest twist. He staggers shakily to his feet. He looks behind him.
Dean realises he’s been looking but not watching. He squeezes his eyes shut, and with a long inhale he pushes away from his bed, straightening up. “M’ goin’ for some air.”
When Lucifer is safely out of sight, Cas pulls Jack towards him in a tight hug, letting out a deep sigh. He looks up at Dean.
alike, that’s for sure.
The news was not what he was expecting. He’s staring at the cursive, written in the slightly shaky curl of Professor Singer.
Dean leans his head back against the pillow, and sighs. He closes his eyes.
Sam nods, and a slight blush tinges as his cheeks. “Yeah. It was after you left, so not long.”
To Dean's surprise, Cas just stands there. He'd have expected Castiel to raise his hackles or something, growl back at Lucifer—anything like the proud, stubborn father that Dean had seen previously. But he doesn't. His expression is hard, but his shoulders are hunched, as though he's forgotten how to stand.  Lucifer leers over him.
"What are you
Sam smiles at her as they part. “Thanks, Ellen.”
He crawls under the sheets with a sigh of relief. They'd been recently changed. He feels himself lulled to sleep, too tired to wonder where Eileen is.
“Pretty good, if I say so myself,” Dean says.
Dean frowns and for the first time, struggles to swallow. He’s not sure he’s ever heard Cas say those words.
“When was that?”
“You sayin’ that they don’t think I’m capable of defending them?”
A moment later, and police
Cas blinks at him.
He feels Cas turn to look at him, but Cas had glanced away by the time he raises his head to meet him.
a detention I’m giving you. With the sort of attitude you’d been demonstrating, I think you’re simply making my teaching much more clear.”
He cringes at the silence that follows, but is surprised when he forces himself to look up at Cas. Castiel is staring at him, mouth parted. He blinks at him.
"It's possible he's been inflicted by the cruciatus curse. They're not sure."
This chapter gave me diabetes while writing it. It's probably why it took so long to update woops
he knew.
"Your burgers, gentlemen."
“Yeah, that’s what I say about all the girls.” His attempt at a grin falls flat, and the Qudditch Master shrugs in resignation. He starts to stand, slowly.
"Man, and I thought my family was messed up." Dean breathes. And then he laughs. Cas looks at him in surprise.
“Claire,” Jody hushes, grasping for Claire’s wand before she accidentally jabs somebodys eye out. “Age doesn’t mean anything. They’re just as human as you. Which means they can be just as idiotic as anyone else.”
, no?”
being present would have been than enough precaution for him to do
“Professor,” he finds himself slurring, still weakened from his very near death experience, “Earnin’ your pay, I see.”
Castiel rejoins them as everyone jumps on their own brooms to get into position, stopping beside Dean with alarming speed. The movement has ruffled his hair up already, and Dean tries to not look at it too long.
“Uncle Lucy!”
“No, apologies. I don’t understand why you believe you have authority in this matter. The only one who should raise concerns with me about this is Professor Singer.”
Castiel sinks down to the floor, head buried in his hands.
“Us,” Castiel murmurs, voice full. “This is us.”
Dean glares. "Yeah, well. He's got a kid, hasn't he? And I'm not—ladies, sure, but bringing
“What, you want us to read the time together?”
, she was introduced as) nods. "Very well. While there has been little evidence so far that Castiel has failed in providing the basic amenities and caregiving that a child of Jack's age should provide, we can rule into investigating such a thing."
“Uh, yeah. Decaf, if you have any. Even I have a limit.”
. We make a deal. You do what you can to make sure Lucifer gets himself put back in, and I'll," he stares at Sam and Dean, "give you the address to the individual who calls themselves
Jack’s lip wobbles a little as he looks at them both, before he gently takes Anna’s hand. “Okay, Aunty.” He nods. “If you really need my help.”
Dean’s too stunned to make a retort, exclamations bubbling against his mind; only siphoned through with the cool voice of Jody’s, edged with the same incredulity that Dean wanted to punch a wall with.
“I’ve never seen you act like that, Castiel,” she mutters. “Would’ve hoped better behaviour from a Novak.”
Jody runs to Dean’s side, jerkily unbinding his hands.
he can hear Sam snort behind him, and Sam better be friggin’ glad Dean can’t move.
Three brooms launch into the air, and the stadium erupts in cheers.
“If the result of the spell is to make detention last longer, I’m sure it’s highly successful.”
“Not at all.” Dean feels himself smile, soft. “I was four, Sammy was only six months. Can remember like it was yesterday.” Cas gazes at him long enough to prompt him to carry on. “She died in a house fire. Lost our home and our Mom. I still remember Dad putting Sammy in my arms and tellin’ me to run outside.” He rubs a hand against his cheek.
“Minister Shurley?” Sam affirms. Michael nods. “I imagine it’s in regard to the letter in your hand.”
, I swear if you keep hovering around me like some sort of fretful mother, I’ll put you into a state of paralysis.” Crowley growls at Dean, who folds his own arms tightly.
“Are you okay?”
,” she starts, “Can anyone tell me what makes a Dark Wizard?”
"Heh, me and Jo, we go way back. Like a sister to me."
His phone vibrates from a phone call, persistent, and he has no choice but to duck into the back room, eyeing the security camera as he pulls his phone out, just in case.
Fear hijacks his throat; his next words come out strained.
“I think you’ll find you were
"Yeah, well." Dean stares ahead. "Still not kinda...still don't feel real. Not yet."
"Daddy, your shoes--"
The kiss is short, but not impatient, and he blinks up at the taller man. Dean’s fingers spread across the edge of his waist.
“Hey, uh. Can I have a word?”
it’ll help with the upcoming tournament stuff.”
"Cool, well, I'm in the middle of driving, so--"

New Year's Party, Dean tipsily revealing
“Sammy?” He mutters, attempting to stagger out of bed. “You’re alright,” He says, unsure if he’s asking a question or making a statement. Sam gives him a small smile, and Dean holds onto his bedpost, sighing.
A soft clink of cans opened, soft creaking on metal hood.
“Alrigh’ then.” Dean remarks, going back to hunting in the fridge, trying to ignore the prolonged silence that was getting more and more awkward by the second.  He can feel Cas somewhere beside him take a breath, as though about to say something--
“No. You need to return to your quarters to rest. You will still be feeling the effects in the morning, and I’d advise that you don’t attend to any of your normal duties tomorrow, unless you have a particularly light schedule. Being nearly Kissed by a Dementor is no light matter.”
He’s a few paces away, when someone emerges from the pub. Cas stumbles to a halt, hairs on his neck prickling. Alastair watches him, coolly.
There’s silence on the line for a few moments, where Castiel can hear background murmurings, perhaps a TV on in the background.
The guy stood in front of him—who in all fairness, would have given
“Yes, and I asked for two.”
Castiel twists around from his stance, teetering on the top of some small steps to reach the top of the blackboard at the sudden entrance of Dean. Dean instinctively grabs his shoulder to steady the Professor, and Castiel throws him a half hearted glare.
“Don’t try to seduce past me.” Dean concludes, heading into the cabin. “You’ll give him a mid-life crisis.”
, huh? You wanted to get rid of your own
"Night, Cas."
, for Merlin’s sake—”
Meg grins up at him, strands of hair falling on her face. “Hey, sweetcheeks.”
!” He yells, as the male falls onto one knee from the effort. The hurricane lasts for only a few moments before it drops, a counter spell freezing it almost mid-gale. The hurricane shatters, splintering the shield with hundreds of shards of ice. Dean manages to throw up a repulsion spell in front of him, watching as the ice melts, soaking the ground and his clothes in the process.
A strained silence settles in between them, long enough for her to believe that she’s made her point, before she picks the chalk back up.
The office is cramped, dark, and yet surprisingly clean. Even Castiel could tell from just walking in that he had
“You love me.”
Silence falls again, Dean rolling the quill in between his fingers as he thinks, lost in thought.
As soon as he disappears, Dean groans, turning towards Cas.
Rubbing what is probably blood away from his eyes, Dean looks dazedly as he sees Claire fly above the Lake, with the Dementors pursuing her. Dean doesn't know where his broom is, but his wand is gripped tight in his hand.
Cas stares at the ash, staining the stairs. “Sucks for him, then.”
“You don’t just leave the profession of Auror, Castiel. Your recklessness is going to put everyone in danger, —”

Too cold to care for where his little brother his, Dean stumbles into the room, pulling a face at the clothes strewn on the floor. He kicks through them with a recoil, trying to tip-toe between dirty laundry. “C’mon, you gotta have blankets somewhere.”
“I still do.”
“Thank you.”
Dean rolls his eyes, holds his hands up in defeat. “Sheesh, yeah.” A frown. “Are you okay?”
“I’m sorry, Dean, but I need to keep you safe. Keep Sam safe.”
Castiel stops, and stares at Dean, surprised. Dean feels himself flush, and tries not to trip over himself in what he suspects might be a one-chance only before he blows it all over again.
And it’s here, Cas backing Dean up against the wall in the darkened corridor, hands pressing to shoulders, blue eyes staring up deep against his own, breaths mingling and fingers tugging at collars—
They stop and stare at him. The bigger guy turns and nods his head to one of the others, who then scarpers off down the corridor—towards Jack's bedroom.
“You’re not an
Jody smiles at him, and leads him into the house. Somewhere in the distance is the sound of children yelling delightedly. The door shuts behind him with a soft click.
Dean sits up, disorientated. He growls. “
Dean begins to laugh. He hasn't laughed that hard in months.
"You're going to believe some pieces of paper with my name on it?" Lucifer hisses. His previously sweet demeanor has twisted into a scowl. "This is bullshit, you can't prove
"Cas, don't listen to him--"
Dean sighs, dramatically. He even raises a hand to his head. “Alas, no one shall ever take the Grindylows like the majestic creatures they deserve to be recognised as.” He declares, dramatically. “Will no one do them justice?”
Bright, superficial light beams from some torch placed on the ground, pointing at him. Dean winces, head blooming in a steady throb.
“Poor boy didn’t know when to
Dean growls, and raises the curtain pole.
, do you like him because mom isn't around anymore?"
.  “You sure? You could still go out."
Charlie Bradbury nudges Dean as soon as he sits down at the staff table, eyeing Castiel with a raised eyebrow as he goes to sit at the other end, seemingly unaware to the observation he is now receiving.
Cas lays there, unconscious.
Dean grins. “Jury’s still out though. Unless you could aid my love for the Grindylows like Professor Naomi could, then you still got some work to do.”
He is going to have

“Talking about your own brother?”
Dean's car was still in the driveway. At--at least they hadn't just left him for dead in the house.
“Yeah, we hung out as students for a while. That was a long time ago.”
“Apologies for the behaviour of my brother. Unfortunately he is usually…. So curt. You don’t get far as an Auror without being particularly headstrong.”

“Thank you.”
“Oh –Um. Right.”
“Dean—”

Sam quietly places the now rather crumpled envelope on the desk, with all the receipts inside. Crowley stares at them.
Castiel barely rolls his eyes at himself, pressing his foot on the pedal, hard.
Dean scrambles with his phone, opening it up to see who Sam had been texting. He feels his cheeks heat up when his eyes settle on the name.
A chair screeches so loudly against the floor, the whole class turn to look at the noise.
A circle of blood
“So, found yourself a DILF?”
The door opens before Dean can knock. It’s Castiel — looking far more tired than at school. Dean tilts his head.
The nurse produces a book and hands it to Dean.
https://youtu.be/4l5ACTUo37g - Magic Works, by the Weird Sisters
To start off the week, there will be a ball to celebrate the start of the challenge, with the selected champions as the honoured guests for the occasion. We will also be taking opportunity to visit your lessons and other activities.” Minister Shurley smiles, before fumbling with the pieces of paper he had placed on the lecturn. He tucks them away in his robes. “Uh, thank you for your time. I hope you have a great rest of your week.”
“Seems we’ve got a hot one, ladies and gents.”
with the incident.” Castiel rebuts, then tilts his head. “What is this really about, Michael?”
Sam laughs in delight, hopping off of Dean and bounding to the kitchen, shoving the coat hanger that he'd draped with his coat into Dean's face. While Dean attempts to wrestle with the various limbs of the hanger, Sam is tapping urgently away at his phone. Dean's stomach swells in fear—flustering him and lowering his defences against the coat hanger.
“Right,” Dean says bleakly. “And we have to wear them into the office because—?”
“I let you lead us in a very informative discussion about commercial tax law, which will have direct benefits for the two small business owners who were at the table,” Dean corrects him, and Castiel makes another sound of profound suffering.
He watches carefully as all the students take off, do their circuit around the pitch, and then return to the line. Some are better than others. A few miss their mark completely, flying past their partner, and one falls off the broom before it stops moving, and he lands face first in the grass. It flies off into the wall, breaking in half. Dean sighs.
, Professor. You’d better walk me home just in case those Grindylows decide to swoop in on Dementor horseback to have me for breakfast too.”
“Can I interest you in our Valentine’s--” He starts his mantra as he straightens, only to stop when recognition hits him upon seeing this man’s face. He blinks.
“Alright.”
Dean’s expression goes from one of cockiness to losing any emotion immediately. He turns to Castiel, who simply gives him a nod, and with a hand to his back, a light push to the centre of the arena. Dean pretends not to stumble. And draws out his wand.
“Y’all are going
"Do you regret it?" Dean blurts out, and he glances down at himself as though to say

The small bell jingles enthusiastically as Dean enters. The diner is pretty quiet, in the weird gap between the end of school mothers and fathers shepherding children for an early dinner, and the evening crowd getting out of work. The perks of a kindergarten teacher when Dean could actually escape somewhat on time; managing to avoid rush hour some of the time was a sweet perk of the job.
"Sam, the fuck--"
Michael stops, suddenly, looking up and behind him. Castiel frowns, and follows his eye line.
“Then it shouldn’t be surprising that staff members are also part of the gossip.”
“That’s alright.” Chuck mumbles, and the chair huffs back a few inches as he stands. “Well, thanks for your time, Bobby. I’ll leave you to it. I’ll see you at dinner?”
Castiel stops his sentence as he watches Dean’s eyes follow to the blackboard, and his mouth drops open. He sighs.
“He’s trying to reach Jack again.” Dean concludes, “and Jack will start remembering him at this age, too.”
“Just never heard you laugh, that’s all. Was unsure if you had it in you.”
“Yeah, well, maybe I’m doin’ some elaborate spell that you just can’t see.”
Sam looks at the date. "Few days, hopefully. Just need to check with the firm."
Dean lets out an involuntary snort, crossing his arms. “I ain’t distractin’ Cas of anything. Also, it ain’t Michael’s business what Cas gets up to anyway.”
Dean glances at Cas. “Couldn’t agree more.”
“See you soon, Samandriel.”
Dean lightly kicks at the end of Sam's broom. Sam yanks it away from his reach, pulling a face at his brother.
of losing someone else."
, Sam. We’re friends.”
The staff room bubbles with concern. He feels Charlie and Jody's eyes on him. If his head didn't suddenly feel so numb, Dean would start feeling rather self conscious.
They both fall silent. Staring.
“Thanks for saving me, back there.”
And no one wants to kill a child.
He turns his head, looking out of his window that looks over the Quidditch pitch.
Michael doesn’t reply for a moment or two, as he’s too busy scanning his office; Sam had gained enough respect in the Ministry to have his own, private space - but as far as ministry offices go, it was still pretty… lacking. There are notices, post it notes, stuck all over the walls. He feels Michael linger at them with some puzzlement. Hey, magic didn’t need to do everything, after all.
“The final challenge, the one that will conclude whether or not who is the ultimate Champion of our small tournament here, will be going head to head in a series of duels. The rules are this – a winners are declared once one contestant has been made incapable of defending themselves, or they are removed from the marked arena. Only disarming and defence spells allowed. Any that do so will be disqualified. The one to come out victorious shall be our Champion. So, to begin:” Bobby shuffles around some papers, and then looks out at the others. “As he is in last place currently, Dean Winchester shall be duelling first.”
"No, you're my colleague."
Dean opens his mouth, to yell at him or to
“Hello, everyone. I’d — I’d like to thank your headmaster, and the school, for offering some amazing hospitality. It’s such an honour to be stood here, wow, as a past student of Hogwarts myself.
He's an older man, which Dean expected. There are deep crow's feet etched around his eyes, and a profile that once would've been seen to be quite dashing. And then Azazel looks at him.
He feels the tension in Castiel’s shoulder soften, and he looks up at Dean. With a small trickle of elation, he watches a smile bloom across Cas’ lips.
Anna and Castiel give another brief glance at each other; then Anna reaches out to Jack. “C’mon, Jack. Aunty Anna needs your help with something very special that only you can help with.”
Instead, Castiel tilts his head. He glances down at Jack, who grins up at him. "Yeah! Mr. Winchester helped me not strangle the pencil!"
Castiel nods, then hesitates. "The payment, I--"
Castiel rolls his eyes, leaning back a little. “You don’t know what I’m about to ask you.”
Cas stares at the ground, and Dean glares at Lucifer, looking between them in shock at the utter
“I’m sorry you had to overhear that.”
He curses when he realises his own gun is in his car—he didn't wanna be hanging around with it around Jack. John would be rolling in his grave.
They all wait. A bang, at one end of the building. Even Dean tries to peer over at
Sam looks down. “There’s a prophecy, Dean. About us. About Lucifer. I… found out while I was in the Ministry. I was forbidden from sharing.”
“Do you often see the lake at night?”
Sam shakes his head, waves a hand. "From what Dean told me, I wouldn't worry. There are subsidies available, or payment options. You
Castiel shakes his head. “I daresay this is why The Headmaster gave me the job, Dean.”
“Man, you
Castiel pulls out his keys and unlocks his car. He slides into the seat, turns on the ignition and looks behind to reverse out. He starts to swing out of the parking lot, only to hear something skid across his car hood and rattle on the ground. His energy drink.
“Thanks, Nurse Cas,” Dean murmurs, softly. “Where’d you learn to do that?”
Castiel just shakes his head.
Dean is led down the ward, to a private room. The male stops him just outside and looks at him.
"Could ask the same thing." Sam replies grumpily, frowning down at him. Dean relents his attempts to push free of the moose of a man, and so he drops his arms with a sigh. He can't look at him.
“Bye! Bye, Mister, Mister Winchesteeer,” Jack sings, voice drifting down the corridor as Castiel, with one last nod in goodbye, turns and carries him out.
Castiel sighs, puts down his book, places his hands on the table. “I’m sure you heard the rest of the statement Professor Singer said. There were to be no questions on this.”
Dean pauses, but there’s no predictable hardening of his shoulders, aggression growing in his muscles so that he tears the flesh in his palm with the gun.
,” Dean cuts off. “Leave it. We got dinner to get to.”
Cas grins up at Dean as their chests bump together. Fingers tangle, and he leans forward, breaths close enough that the stubble on both their cheeks brush. Dean feels the corner of his lips tingle from the odd feeling.
They walk, huddled under an umbrella where they barely fit, shoulders pressed, together. Dean’s ears burn when he hears Sam behind them.
"Don't make promises you can't keep, Winchester," is all Cas says.
would have been deemed a safe environment in basic training.
Cas nods. “Someone trying to escape conviction of using harmful magic on a prominent muggle.”
Dean Winchester would never call himself a man of routine. He would also never, ever proclaim that he was afraid of the dark. When they were kids, it had been his job to tell his brother that there was nothing under the bed.
"Cas. The date. Ellen didn't seem too optimistic."
He wanders down the corridor, holding his arms around himself. He stops outside Sam’s door, and hammer the door with his first for a second.
Sam rolls his eyes. “Dean, you’re a little more creative than that, come on.”

"This is a matter to resolve inside the courtroom," Sam says, testily. "So I think this conversation can continue there, when properly due."
Dean waves at Jody as she wrangles Claire under her arm and out of the classroom door.
Jack looks at his writing again, as though Dean was tricking him, and gives a satisfied nod at his handiwork. "The a is hard though."
“Well, we’re fair and square now. You don’t owe me anythin’.” Dean mutters. He glances back, eyebrows raised. “… See ya around?”
“Sure!” Charlie grins. Dean frowns.
The container is covered in dust. Dean presses the flashlight on his phone and swings it around. There are clear foot tracks on the ground that have displaced settled dust; he'd been here very recently, though not to linger, apparently.
"You can play with it once we're done cleaning, okay?"
Department of Law. Invoice to: Department of Rep.
Dean has been in two minds the whole day. He wanted to be there at the hearing, especially after hearing the news. (That they all knew, but still.) But, after the last time Dean properly saw him...
Soft humming, lips still.
She storms forward, hand curling into a fist, and Castiel almost falls backwards as he staggers to his feet, backing up.
They walk the remainder of the corridor back in silence. Dean is unsure whether the silence is comfortable or not, and he fidgets with the foil on the chocolate bar the rest of the walk. He pauses at the door to the great hall, gently putting an arm out to stop Cas.
Castiel’s eyes widen. “I was only trying to tell the tr—”
Jack's father stares after Jack as he disappears. He expels a long sigh, closing his eyes for a moment, before turning back to Dean. He looks at him, and hot
"Hey, buddy, you alright there?"
Lucifer’s lip crease in a smile. Cas immediately throws his wand up, a thrust of a spell that skids his feet backwards several metres, just as the ground beneath him rips itself open. Lucifer starts to move, expressionless, and Dean shuffles backwards, back pressing against the shield. He holds his wand with both hands and tries to ignore the shaking.
Castiel looks at her, steadily. The chalk snaps in her fingers.
"Your Honor, I object—there's nothing--"
Shakily, Cas pulls out his phone.
Sam looks down. He frowns.
“I’m sorry—my job overran, and the rain—”
Cas finally looks at him. Dean motions back to the classroom.
Silence.
Cas stares. “What?”
Dean wanders over to the door, pulling it open. He finds himself staring straight into tired, blue eyes.
Everyone turns to stare at Sam, uncomfortable, but side eyes the Minister expectantly; they’d all been wondering the same thing. Chuck blinks, frozen. He wrings his hands.
“Other me will be driving with you.”
“Uh, Professor?” He asks, just as Castiel has turned to head to the Headmasters office. He turns back to Dean, an eyebrow raised.
“This—That was…” Dean breathes, holding onto Cas as though letting go fabricated the whole moment.
?" Jody gasps, as silver bursts towards the Dementors.
He walks off, and Dean and Charlie watch him go in silence.
He feels the edges of his vision darkening as they grow closer, feels the fight and the warmth drain from him too quickly to grasp and he can barely shout out in defense, never mind utter the words for the spell, and-his wand drops and it dawns on him this is merely how his life ends, and nightmares begin to drown out his death—
“It’s Castiel,” the man says, gaze flickering to something behind Dean and back in a way that sends a chill down Dean’s spine. “Give me your hand, Dean—
“Thank you,” Castiel says mildly, and keeps Dean’s phone in his hands.
They don’t even get on the bed properly, Castiel walking Dean backwards into the mattress so that he falls sideways across it, then straddling his waist. He tries to pull Dean’s shirt over his head while Dean is trying to unbutton his pants, and Dean has to laugh at the frustrated sound he makes when stymied.
“It would have to have something to do with... ice,” Castiel muses. “Yes? There’s ‘sluice’ right under ‘tequila sunrise’ and ‘spice’ under ‘House of Bourbon’.”
Suddenly, Castiel says, “It’s obsequious.”

Sam’s starting to look a little less apologetic and a little more pissed off. “Look, I just need an outlet and the wifi password. And a little peace and quiet, if that’s not too much to ask.”
“Just because the romance is gone from your lives doesn’t mean the rest of us are dead inside,” Dean grouses, but he pulls out his billfold and puts a five in. He’ll probably do at least that much damage before Christmas.
At dinner, the radio tortures them for a few sets with hippopotamuses and Christmas shoes before four ascending notes on a piano announce the arrival of something better. Dean grins at Castiel on the other side of the kitchen, and Castiel pauses his massacre of the zucchini.
Castiel’s face doesn’t fall, exactly. He just looks suddenly and strangely agreeable, like he didn’t really expect to get what he wanted. Like he’s used to it. “Ah. That makes sense.”
The Impala coasts to a stop at the side of a narrow road, down in the bottom of what would have been a holler if they were anywhere near Kentucky or the Virginias.  These woods are colder, snow mounded up under their trunks and blowing in dry, sparkling drifts across the unmarked lane, and they haven’t seen so much as a rusted-out mailbox in ten miles. The asphalt ribbon spooling up the mountain is the only sign of civilization.
Castiel points his knife at Dean. “We’re supposed to be cooking.”
“Yes,” Castiel says darkly, ignoring Dean’s squawk of betrayal. “Did he always sing to himself so much, too?”
It doesn’t turn out to be as simple as that, of course. The top half of the tree, which they still haven’t moved from the upstairs hallway, is actually the top third— because, surprise, the tree comes in five pieces.
“You’re the one that made the list, sweetheart,” he says dryly. “Four kinds of cookies? Cupcakes? Croquembouche? Ringing any bells?”
Dean groans and goes to spit.
Dean’s day starts with Missouri and the O’Jays,
Dean stares at them, but neither looks up from what they’re doing. There seems to be an air of palpable tension in the kitchen in the way they’re so deliberately
“I’m tired,” Castiel mumbles, drifting towards the door to the house while trying to unbutton the trench with clumsy fingers. He never got his gloves out. “I think I’d rather sleep.”
“Don’t you want to see the lights?” he asks, trying a smile.
Sam’s first reaction to the house is
“Fugoff,” Sam groans, shifting away.
“Mmhm,” Dean says, eyes closed as he runs the flat of his tongue up Castiel’s dick before swallowing him down again.
that?”
“Yes,” the man says gravely. “The sun is gone, and the longest night of the year is here. We are in danger unless we join the dance.”
“Maybe you two should head back to Bobby’s for the night,” Ellen says. “
Victor says when Dean has to stop and pant into the headset for a while, straightening up with a groan for sore muscles.
“Yes,” Castiel says, using them to steer Dean closer to him. He raises his chin a fraction, drops his eyes to Dean’s mouth—
“We may need to leave temporarily,” Castiel continues, tilting his head to look back at him. “Just until he forgets where we live. Are you still paying for your apartment?”
“I see.” A thumb rubs gently behind his ear, and Castiel’s heel presses into the back of his knee. When he speaks, it’s breathed against Dean’s forehead. “How fortunate I love you too.”
Dean nudges him harder. “We have to stay awake in case anyone comes by.”
[Scanned_20161206].pdf
The first one arrives right on Thursday, when the winter rain is pelting the car at damn near a thirty-degree angle and Dean feels like he might lose an arm in the short time it takes him to roll down the window, grab for the mailbox latch, and hastily shovel the jumble of junk mail into the car with them.
Dean scowls. “What? Why? Car’s fine.”
But Castiel just gives him a confused look over his shoulder. “The winter garden? Half of it is dead.”
Dean’s phone beeps on the seat between them, and before Dean can do more than look down Castiel slaps a hand over it and snaps, “
“What do I do?” he asks.
Dean winces. “That’s a little over-dramatic, don’t you—” He catches sight of the look on Castiel’s face. “Okay, yes. Point taken, slowing down now.”
“Am I going to get outvoted if I ask to turn it down a little?” he asks as he swings in.
“Someone has to,” Castiel says simply.
“Careful!” Castiel calls up to him.
Re: Talbot Boston Holiday Party - Call for Support
Sam makes a face and nudges the full oil pan between them with one sock-covered toe. “Castiel might have pointed out to me that I was only going to be here a couple weeks, and it wasn’t really cool to come with stuff still hanging over my head.”
“Great,” Castiel echoes bleakly. “Should I— should I plan to wear anything… specific?”
everyone else is merrily shooting around on, arms out wide and eyes fixed on the shiny blades strapped to his feet. It’s only December, and there are bubbles and sticks poking up through the ice this close to the shore, and oh God. He does not want to do this.
His answering, “Yeah, right, who’d steal this ugly piece of shit,” gets squeezed out of him as he turns around and Sam hits him like a ton of bricks, giant orangutan arms crushing him into his chest. “Jesus, did you grow
“I am here with my
And Castiel steps in, spins them in a neat circle, and Fred Astaires his Ginger Rogers.
“Are you.”
“Hmph,” Dean says, and keeps patting over the jumbled mess of bedding. He’ll find the edge of the comforter soon. Any second now.
MA-Creative-ArtDesign-DL@talbotpartners.com; MA-Creative-Directors-DL@talbotpartners.com
“Oh, lots,” Sam answers. “Most of it about burning bodies.”
It’s a dim light, orange like an old streetlamp. The wind rises for a moment and it disappears, reappears as trees bend and sway.
“Anything handy in the lore about bonfires?” he asks, still scanning the area.
BONUS TERRIBLE SONGS:
don’t be strangers, it can’t be me buying all the gas.”
Dean tries to back-peddle. “Are you sure? We can try to clear out some space in the den, rearrange the furniture. Or wait until the floor’s finished in the library? That’s only a few more weeks.”
Dean grabs the printed page with his name on it and crumples it into a little ball, looking over his shoulder to make sure Castiel made it all the way from the elevators with half his body weight in pastry hooked on his wrists. “Looks like we offload here,” he says, and dumps his own bags on the festive red tablecloth. Someone’s put cottony fake snow in artful clumps at the far corners, and Dean pushes it off to make way for the first of many platters.
He’s not wrong— they come to a final ring of hundred-year oaks and the blaze towers above them, spitting sparks high into the cloudy sky. The heat is sudden and intense, strong enough that the snow thins and disappears in front of them to reveal faded yellow grass in a rough circle around a slightly sunken pit. The logs are piled in a rough pyramid, the ones at the bottom easily three feet across and twice as long. The amount of char and ash at the base says it’s been burning for hours; Dean thinks he would have seen something this big burning long before the sun went down, but that’s the least odd thing about it.
, you freak?” he demands through a faceful of shaggy hair, thumping him on the back a few times in return. “You’re gonna make people think Bigfoot gave up the west coast for some lobstah.”
” Dean asks, gesturing at— at all of it. Teddy bears. Gingerbread men. Snowflakes. Candy canes galore. Red and green puffballs sprout from every knitted inch, like mushrooms fruiting in fertile soil. Santa Claus grins maniacally at Dean from the left pocket, Mrs. Claus from the right.
Castiel’s lips curve, and he tugs Dean closer, Dean’s mouth near his ear.
Lisa and Ben pick them up in the very small hours of the morning, when misting sleet blows like a fog over the house and Castiel can barely get his eyes open enough to be maneuvered into his coat.
“This is silly,” Castiel grumbles.
“It was great,” Dean says, and has to laugh a little at the suspicious look Castiel turns on him. “Cas, c’mon. You think they’d just go along with whoever I brought home and be fine with it?”
“Come upstairs with me,” he says, low and demanding, and well, when he puts it that way.
Broadly interpreting this to mean first
“Lights?”
charlene.bradbury@talbotpartners.com
And there’s Dean’s surly welcome. He spends long enough just standing there grinning at Cas that the man looks up again, and straightens with a scowl.
Dean wants to ask what he’s thanking him for, but he thinks he knows the answer; it only makes him flush harder. He lets Castiel kiss him instead, uncoordinated and messy as they start to move in earnest, and when he finally comes in a searing, overwhelming rush, he uses Castiel’s mouth to muffle anything incriminating.

“Completely. A victim of my husband’s puerile imagination and bad taste.”
Did I hallucinate the chocolate chip cookies last week, Mr. Undefeated Bake-Off Champion???
Dean says, much less reasonably, and when she runs and tries to hide in the ladies room Charlie is the one who goes in and grabs her. Becky makes strident pleas in the name of the free press and anti-censorship while Dean goes through the camera and deletes every single candid with them in it (there are a distressing number of them), until he comes to one where Balthazar has just taken an unattractively large bite of smoked salmon.
Across the island, Sam smacks his forehead. “Of course it is! And then 48 across is
Castiel, red-faced with the effort of supporting the tree— no, the tree
He nods at the windshield, where the snow is starting to come down harder, sticking in the hollows of the wipers and building up fast. The flakes caught in the folds of Dean’s jacket are melting onto his jeans in icy streaks. “Fine,” he says, hunching deeper into his collar. “We’ll stay.”
It’s simple white lights— nothing red or green, hung in straight lines with no complicated patterns, but the warm gleam is soft and welcoming, casting the house in a dreamlike glow. A few rooms are lit but from here the windows are mostly dark, Dean’s dollar-store candles flickering merrily on the sills. Dean and Castiel stand in silence in the middle of the courtyard, gazing up at their house with something like wonder.
Victor adds.
“And?”
“Holy
you are,” he says, waving him over. “Come here, I found Aunt Amara’s Christmas things.” He immediately refocuses on the chest.
“I’m going to dry Rum off down here,” Dean says once he pulls up the garage door, icy trickles sliding down the back of his neck and making him shudder. “You want to watch anything? Doesn’t have to be the game.”
Next to him, Castiel mumbles, “My feet are cold.”
Anna comes to the middle of her graceful figure eight and turns smoothly in place, a pirouette worthy of any ballerina. “Come on, Dean! It’s much more fun once you’ve got a bit of space.”
“Eh, it’s fine,” Dean says, finding he can be magnanimous with an olive branch already extended. “God only knows how you do half of the stuff on your plate. Take all the time you need, just— let’s go on a walk or two, first? Let me show you around?”
I'm skipping to 12 before 11, because that one's not! cooperating! and at this rate we might have 13 before 11 too
“No, look,” Dean says, pointing.
“Catch!” Dean says brightly and Castiel tries to dodge instead, knocking Balthazar sideways. Alfie takes half the hit, though the poor kid’s dressed in such a poofy coat he probably doesn’t feel a thing.
Balthazar additionally suggested in our staff meeting this afternoon that I use my position and privileges as your husband to influence your choice of baked goods for the party. I would normally refuse, but he and the rest of the team mentioned several desserts I had not heard of previously, and many of them sound intriguing. Please find attached our list with the specific varieties I am interested in highlighted.
“You know, they have skate aids at the front entrance,” Anna says, skating a literal circle around them. “They look like penguins and polar bears. If you’re having this much trouble, we could go get one?”
“No.” Castiel sighs, and slips the glasses off. “No, that would be foolish. Hold this,” he says, and proceeds to dump half the contents of his desk into a fat tote while Dean holds the handles up. He makes Dean carry it, too, and Dean’s not exaggerating the way the weight makes him stagger on the way to the elevators.
Sam gives Dean an impish grin, which under normal circumstances Dean would reciprocate. But Castiel is glancing between the two of them with his eyebrows starting to draw in, like he thinks he’s been the butt of some joke.
Dean climbs down and moves the ladder two more times before he’s at the corner of the house, wedged between two overgrown juniper bushes and stretching to the limits of his balance.
“Don’t let the door hit you on the way out,” Benny says, and under his breath adds, “
“I apologize for my abruptness,” the figure says, voice deep and smooth. “Unfortunately, you have arrived late in the proceedings.”

Talbot is open and they’re both working New Year’s Eve. The weather is sleety and depressing, and only gets worse as the day goes on; Castiel gives him increasingly doubtful looks over the bathroom sink, breakfast, the long, shitty drive into the office, and standing at the end of the year all-hands meeting. Doubt starts to turn to apprehension, then alarm as Victor pulls them aside to recommend a slightly less terrible wine from the Harbor, and Ellen sends both of them
What little accumulation they had from November’s flurries has succumbed to the numbing rain, along with most of the courtyard’s still-wild landscaping. Despite the paint and siding work Dean has done since summer, the house looms with the grey, foreboding air of something out of a gothic novel as they turn into the courtyard. Bare branches sway in gusts from the ocean, and skeletal ivies cling to the wood and creep over windowsills.
“Pretty sure they make an app for that,” Dean says, and smiles widely in the face of Castiel’s obvious disgust.
Eventually, like wreckage following the currents, they all wash up in the sitting space between the Cinnabon and an Applebee’s. Surprisingly, Bobby is sitting in one of the massage chairs just outside, two bags and a big gift-wrapped box next to him. “I have no idea where those two are,” he says about Ellen and Jo. “Lost me three steps into this hell. Merry fudging Christmas.”

“Celebrities?” Castiel asks with a kind of dull horror.
and Dean yelps a little as his back hits it, but Castiel turns the water hot enough to scald his toes and stays with him until it reaches his shoulders, monitoring the temperature with narrow-eyed diligence. The cuffs and front of his shirt go translucent where the water soaks in.
“Perhaps later. I’ll take your hand to start with,” the man says, a thread of amusement in his low voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
His other hand wraps loosely around Dean’s cock, thumb rubbing leisurely up and down the underside and stroking precome back over his skin, almost soothing if it weren’t so fucking torturous. He kisses the protest out of Dean at the same unhurried pace, until the shuddery knot in Dean’s gut is painfully tight and he can’t stand it anymore. “I want,” Dean rasps against his cheek, thigh hitched urgently around Castiel’s hip, “Cas, please, I need—”
“Thank God,” Lisa says when he produces a third thermos from a pocket, grabbing for it. “Dean, you’re driving.”
“You’re absolutely certain that’s steady?”
Well, only a little bit. And only because Hester and company are watching, and that audience always makes Castiel shoot him that flustered look of amusement and embarrassment.
The holiday gala is just around the corner, and we have assembled an enthusiastic party planning team eager to transform Conference Room 1950 into a festive space next Friday afternoon.  You should have received an Outlook invitation (see attached), which we encourage you to share with your clients and close contacts outside the agency.
From above their heads comes a long, mournful yowl. Dean’s head moves back in tandem with Castiel’s to see Rosie’s black and cream face peering down at them from just where the lights stop.
“Oh, we’ll be dancing alright,” Dean says with a wink, and Kevin takes a face journey so long and complicated that Charlie puts RuPaul on her big monitor for the rest of the afternoon, no matter how loudly Kevin begs her to take it off or turn it down.
Dean marshals his mental forces and begins to feel blindly for the comforter. A repetitive sound, one he hadn’t pieced out from the rest of the room’s background noises until just then, stops abruptly.

Moving into Castiel’s hands is second nature now, but Dean has to remind himself that flour and all that black would be a bad mix. “Well, the oven’s pre-heating and I haven’t turned on the TV yet,” he says, leaning in to bring their lips close. “So the party’s on pause for now. But later, we’ll have pizza and salad fixings, maybe some poppers if the jalapenos are still good. I’ve got cheesecake and Brut in the fridge for later. Okay?”

“Save ‘em for me, then. How do you feel about inflatable snowmen?”
Dean risks another peek above the sheets. The man is sitting up against the headboard, looking out the low window by the bed, barechested and tousle-haired. Dark blue paint is still smeared over his throat and collarbones, lines as thick as a fingertip drawn over his Adam's apple to his bottom lip. There’s a steaming mug of coffee on the wide windowsill, along with a discarded crown of evergreen and bright berries. Outside, the tops of trees touched with hoarfrost stretch out as far as the eye can see under a perfect, cloudless sky.
,” Dean says loftily, opening the cabinets. “Apparently I feed people so much it gets annoying, which you’d
Lisa’s puffy coat and fur-trimmed hood are zipped and buttoned to the utmost, leaving just the tired squint of her eyes visible. Ben is excited to the point of perpetual frenetic motion, launching himself at Dean with a running tally of everything he’s going to do and see in New York and then yanking off his boots so he can go tell Castiel the same thing.
The hit is perfect— right between Castiel’s shoulder blades and hard enough to make an audible
“Twelve gas cans,” Dean pants. There’s a petite woman dancing at Sam’s side, narrow, graceful horns arcing up from skull over her face. Castiel draws them into a long spiraling loop around the bonfire, the dancers knitting together and spinning apart at dizzying speed. It’s leaping again with flames as tall as the trees, as tall as the sky; the stars blaze like embers burning holes in the night, eating it away. Dean lets go of Sam at the same time Sam lets go of him, and they spin away, the dancers falling back into pairs to step in that pattern Dean doesn’t know but can follow all the same. The dance begins to collapse towards the center, towards the huge, all-consuming fire, and Dean doesn’t hesitate for a second before he jumps again. Castiel’s hand stays solid and real when everything else dissolves in light, holding him fast.
Back upstairs in the master bedroom, Dean sets Nabokov back in the sheets and, after a second, crouches to check under the bed.
“Cute ones,” Dean assures him, and at Castiel’s expression hastily revises that to, “Really handsome, cool, dignified ones.” Photos like the set he’d taken when Castiel had fallen asleep on the ugly couch with kittens in the crook of every limb, Dean’s personal favorites to date. “Very dignified.
“Feel what?”
She settles back with a slim glass of champagne held artfully between three fingers, her head tilted to the side and her eyes gleaming. Castiel has gone stiff and silent beside Dean, which means someone probably

“Absolutely not,” Castiel tells her, pointing towards the door.
Castiel says reverentially.
Dean and Sam are simple men with simple needs, and are maybe too excited by the brand new, top of the line Belgian waffle iron Castiel pulls from the butcher’s pantry like a rabbit out of a hat. Castiel quietly glows under the praise, and continues looking so pleased with himself Dean has to steal a kiss while he’s cooking, despite Sam’s loud, “Aw, man, right in front of my waffle?”
It takes 24 hours with Sam on the ground for them to have their first fight, and two minutes after that for Sam and Castiel to start ganging up on him.
“I would, but I was going to use it again,” Dean says, and despite Castiel protesting that it’s
“He’s out, honey,” Ellen says. “He’s been out.”
“Hate this drive,” Dean mutters, fifteen minutes into the claustrophobic crawl. He taps the steering wheel and checks his mirror, looking for an opening— any opening— in the left lane. “Hate coming here, period. Worst airport in America, swear to God.”
It’s an old and simple dance, something from a time long before dance halls and ballrooms and village squares. They step in circles with the fire hot between them— not nearly as painful as it should be— alternating the lead foot, until Dean follows Castiel’s cue to switch hands and circle back. It’s easier than it should be, like his body remembers something his brain doesn’t. They press apart, and pull together. There’s a skip they make at the same time, and another, and then Castiel faces him, holding out his other hand, and Dean jumps over the fire without thinking.
Castiel looks down at himself, like he’s just noticing Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe has come and crapped on his clothes. “It’s… a holiday sweater.”

He stalks out past the break room television he’d pointed at, the screen barely visible from Dean’s desk. WCVB Channel 5 has been broadcasting video of what’s left of New York state after Winter Storm Argos passed through. Most of the footage is whiteout blizzard conditions, some of it car wrecks and highways slowed to a crawl.
“I told you so,” Sam says, into the resigned silence that fills the car.
Lisa puts her face in her arms and the whole table bursts out laughing, and then the doorbell rings and they’re off.
“Well, then,” Dean drawls, holding the card and its glittery woodland creatures at arm’s length. “I guess it’s finally the season.”
“Give me the camera, Becky,” Dean says, holding out a hand.
“It's— it's so surreal to meet you,” Sam says on a laugh. “I mean, to meet you in person, finally. After everything Dean put us through, and all the stories.”
At lunch, Dean drops by Art and Charlie is blasting Trans-Siberian Orchestra from the portable speaker hooked over her monitor; the speaker is bright green, and shaped like a dinosaur. She’s so deep in the zone she barely notices him, and bats at his hand when he waves it slowly in front of her eyes. “Come back in ten!” she yells above the music.

“Dean?” Castiel calls after him, sounding worried.
“Not too long, once we get across the water,” Dean says, and turns into traffic going north.
