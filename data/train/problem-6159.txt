“Why did I do that?” Tony paces around the room, thankful he has it to himself for the moment. Hopefully, Bruce is taking a nice, long moonlit walk with Betty that will keep him from the room for a few hours.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky pretends to clean out his ears. “Are you saying you’ve felt the pull since you saw him? When he was fighting with his guardian about becoming betrothed. That moment?”
“There’s really not much to tell,” he says with a shrug, dropping his cufflinks in a little dish in the wardrobe.
“I’m here, Steve.” He steps into the forge, the heat immediately making his face flush. “Sorry, I was putting something away.” There’s a basket on Steve’s arm and Tony tips his head to the side. “What’s that?”
He’s still a little self-conscious about the scars on his chest. Steve has spent hours kissing them and telling Tony how beautiful he finds them, but they still bother Tony sometimes. He takes a deep breath, he can do this.
“Funnily enough, she just asked me when I wanted the tower gone.” They reach the top and Steve steps into the room first. “I was ready to give her a date, but then the words just disappeared and, instead, I asked to keep it up. Just a month to start.”
Pierce and Rumlow do not make Steve wait long to reveal their plans. He seats Steven next to him at the feast and sends Rumlow to sit with the other knights. Steven plays the part of a concerned fiance, but when Pierce begins pouring on the charm, Steven knows he needs to pretend to fall for the act, hoping Pierce will reveal his plans sooner rather than later. Steven has no desire to remain in this kingdom longer than necessary.
After a few minutes, he's still nervous but feels more settled. Tony finishes dressing and leaves the baths. He goes straight to his room and, after a quick search, finds his chess set and sets it on the bed while he calls for Jarvis.
“Good.” Tony gives a happy little shimmy and turns so he can lean back against the edge of the pool.
There’s a slight tremor in Tony’s hand when he takes Steve’s arm, and he hopes it’s not too obvious. The walk to the harem's wing feels far too short and Tony finds himself wishing they were going to another room altogether. He tries to make small talk, but the words feel thick on his tongue. Steve is understanding as always, filling in the silence by telling Tony his own plans for the next day.
It’s Steve who reaches out first. He presses his hand to Tony’s chest, laughing quietly as the strings flow around his palm. He can feel the way Tony’s heart is racing and his own is beating just as fast.
Jarvis lets Tony know when it’s time and when he gets upstairs, Steve is waiting for him dressed in jeans and a t-shirt that is still tight, but looser than what he usually wears.
“I’ve been here since you got in. You just didn’t notice me.” She studies his face, taking in all the little tells that Tony gives away. “Now, tell me what happened.”
Looking down at his puckered fingertips, Tony laughs. “That is probably a good idea. Steve also threatened to send Rhodey if I was late.”
“Because I didn’t want you to hate me. I would have been essentially kidnapping you. And regardless of invisible strings and prophecies, I did not want that as the only reason we were together.” He starts rubbing Tony’s back and closes his eyes. “Can I tell you something, Tony?”
Steve rolls his shoulders back and gets a handful of Tony’s ass. “Naked first.” He lets Tony strip and begins touching Tony all over. “Good, baby. So gorgeous. All hard and eager for me.”
Tony continues talking, going on about the different shapes and styles of arrowheads he wants to try. He mostly wants to know how they’ll affect Clint’s aim and the way the arrow flies, and since they have more than enough of their usual arrows, he thinks it’s worth it.  Before he’s even aware, a gentle hand is pushing him into his chair and Steve is taking the seat next to him.
“Of course, sir.” There’s a twinkle in Jarvis’s eyes and he cups Tony’s face in his hands. He presses a gentle kiss to his forehead and takes one last look. “I believe you are ready.”
It hits Tony how long it’s been since he’s been this close to Steve. Even though there have been gifts and notes sent back and forth, Tony realizes they haven’t had the chance to share even a quick sideways hug over the past few weeks. He shifts so he can wrap his arms around Steve and burrows in close. Steve smells good. Tony's never sure what the scent is, but it reminds him of sunshine and warmth and comfort.
Tony tries to ignore the way he is blushing from Steve’s kiss, but he knows it’s useless. He’ll be blushing all through his bath and will probably keep his blush until they meet up again. Damn Steve for being so sweet to him.
In the nursery, Margaret moved straight to the crib. She lifted her newest charge into her arms and held him close to her chest to keep him warm. He was small, but those bright blue eyes the color of the sky on a sunny day watched her with avid interest and Margaret could already feel the stirrings of a vision.
The workshop is littered with scraps of whatever paper Tony could get his hands on. They’re filled with sketches of shields of all different shapes, sizes, and varying designs. He’d been frustrated and annoyed that he couldn’t solve such a simple problem when the solution hit him. Simplicity. Steve has never been a royal who demanded his armor and weapons be extravagant and ostentatious. Tony had asked one night why Steve didn’t just ask for plain armor and when Steve explained that he wanted some adornment to draw the enemy to him and away from his people, he’d just found himself loving Steve all the more.
A sound comes over the baby monitor and they both freeze. Tony’s fingers dig into Steve’s back and it feels like ages before they’re both assured that Peter is still asleep. Peter has had a lot of trouble sleeping this past month and Steve and Tony’s nights have been filled with walking him, singing to him, and trying every trick in the book to try to get him to sleep.
Once he's changed, he enacts his next plan. It took some time, and many meetings, for Tony to come up with a plan that would enable him to sneak the shield into the great hall, and tonight it is being put to the test. Bucky, Clint, and Sam are the key to making sure it all goes off without a hitch. They each take turns distracting Steve and keeping his attention on them. Their goal is to keep him away from Tony just long enough so he can hide the shield with the queen. Just as Tony hoped, the only thing Steve manages to see is his mother kissing Tony on the cheek after she tucks the shield behind her chair.
As Steve begins fucking him in earnest, Tony gets a hand on his cock and uses every trick he knows to get off. He uses his heels to urge Steve on. He’s close to the edge, and he just needs a little more to tip over.
Steve’s eyes look deep into Tony’s as he switches the pawns in his hands around and around until he’s not sure which one is where. He holds them out and chuckles as Steve taps his left hand. Steve always goes left when he has to pick anything. Tony’s not sure Steve even realizes he does it, but Tony loves that little quirk.
“Mercy! Mercy! I’ll give you a hint!” Steve lets up and Tony has to catch his breath. “It’s a good thing you’re so pretty, sleeping beauty.” He steals another kiss and pokes Steve in the side. “Okay, your hint. It’s round.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I can never say no to those puppy eyes he gives me.” He watches Bruce float over, and when he holds out his hand, Tony passes the soap over. “The guilt was also very effective.”
“What do you think?” Tony can’t help but be a little nervous. He’s worked so hard and so long on this.
Tony giggles. “We are.” His arms go around Steve’s neck and he holds onto him. “Though, I should be mad at you.”
Obie had also been stunned and quickly fell over himself trying to greet the prince and offer his hospitality. Steve had smiled and graciously accepted the offer. After that, the only words he’d spoken to Obie were to ask for some refreshments. As soon as Obie had gone to fetch someone, Steve had whisked Tony away to talk. Tony can still remember the look on Obie’s face when he realized Steve was leading him from the room. When the door closed behind them and they were away from Obie’s prying eyes, Tony hoped he would be asked to join the harem.
“Thank you, mama.” He follows her to where she keeps the jewelry most precious to her and watches as she pulls out a few boxes. “I am glad you love Tony too.”
Margaret watched mother and child for a moment and moved to the center of the room. She’d been feeling the vision wanting to burst forth, but she had tried to hold it back, wanting to see the prince for herself first. As soon as she stopped walking, the vision refused to be held back any longer. Her head fell forward, shoulders slumping as she called her power. When her head did lift, her eyes had turned white and a slight glow emanated from her body.
Steve moves the shield around, amazed at how light it is. He looks into Tony’s eyes and holds out his hand. Tony takes it and gasps when he finds himself pulled into Steve’s chest. Steve lifts the shield and is delighted to find that it's big enough to cover them both and give them a semblance of privacy. Before he says a word, Steve kisses Tony. He pours everything he feels into the kiss and he knows Tony understands when he kisses back just as fiercely.
He moves away from the table but doesn’t get far. Steve is still holding his hand and he pouts. “Where?”
“He’s fine, punk.” Bucky squeezes Steve’s wrist. “Take a breath.” Steve does as he’s told and Bucky grins. “Good. You’re just going to spend some time here with me and Bruce until we get the signal.”
It's all come down to this. Steve's surprise and our Happily Ever After (as if it could end any other way)
“And you’ve done that, Stevie. I still remember how cagey Clint was when you first brought him here. He was constantly jumping at shadows and he told me it took weeks before he stopped worrying someone would come and toss him in a cell. We all remember how Bruce flinched at loud noises, and even Tony tried to figure out what would make him useful enough so he wouldn’t be asked to leave. Remember how Carol thought she had to sneak into guard training?”
Burying his face in Tony’s neck, Steve comes, hips jerking, legs shaking. “Tony, Tony, Tony. Fuck, I love you.” He manages to find Tony’s mouth and he smiles into the kiss. “Your turn, sweetheart. You know I love to see you.”
The cravat drops to the floor and Natasha tips Tony’s face down with her fingers. “We both know you'd never send Jarvis away. Just as we both know there is so much for you to tell me. Now talk.”
When Tony finally calms enough to stand, he takes a deep breath. Since Steve isn’t banging on the door or trying to come in, it can’t be all that bad. Right?
“Good, baby.” Steve gets a hand on Tony’s cock and strokes him loosely in time with his thrusts. “Clench around me.” Tony does as he’s told and Steve tightens his grip a little.
Tony pretends to think about it before shaking his head. “Nope! You’ll just have to wait now. Maybe for your birthday. It’s only a few weeks away.”
In Steve’s arms, he burrows close and breathes in that scent that is so uniquely him. Tony doesn’t even know how to begin to describe it, but he settles when he’s close enough to smell it. “I’m nervous.“
Everything else is waiting in the living room and Steve takes a moment to take a deep breath in and let it out. “It’s going to be a good night. We’re ready for this.”
Stroking Tony faster, Steve can feel he’s near the edge. “Turn your head, baby.” Tony does and Steve kisses him hard, not caring the angle is awkward. “Gonna come, Tony. Come with me.”
“I was.” Tony brushes his lips over Steve’s. “The project I’ve been working on. It was going to be my way of proposing.”
“This is where they came from. This one,” He points to the flower that resembles a pink daisy, but with a lot more petals. “Is a pink aster. Since it kind of looks like a daisy, I thought you might like it. And this one,” his fingers brush over the lush petals of the other flower, “is a peony. It’s one of my favorites. I’ve always liked how they kind of look like roses, but softer.”
Escaping Bucky’s gaze is impossible and Steve adds even more whiskey to his glass before speaking. “IfeelapullwithTony.”
One of Rhodey’s hands comes up and ruffles Tony’s hair. “As if I’ve ever been able to stay mad at you.”
When they’d first married, the king and queen had thought it would be a simple matter to have children. They were in love and eager to start their family. Not only would a child ensure the kingdom and their people were taken care of, but they both wanted to have a little one to love and teach about the world. Sadly, years passed and they were still without a child. The few times Sarah thought she’d conceived had ended with bloody bedsheets and Joseph holding her as she cried.
Tony’s laughter joins Steve’s and he leans up for one last kiss. “At least we both got to come this time.”
Could it be something as simple as dinner? Or maybe, it’s some grand declaration? Steve doesn't know that he's ready for that, but, no matter what it is, Steve knows Tony will have put a lot of thought and care into it. Steve stops midstep as another possibility makes itself known. What if Tony wants to tell him he doesn't feel the same and he wants Steve to stop courting him? Shaking his head, he rolls his shoulders back and takes a deep breath. He can’t let himself imagine it’s bad. Tony wouldn’t have given Roth this boutonniere if he was going to be telling Steve something bad.
As soon as they were feeling calmer, Joseph summoned every doctor, healer, and wizard he could find to make sure his wife and child stayed healthy. Of everyone he summoned, only one, a wizard named Zola, was sent away after he made the queen uncomfortable. Even with all of that, it had all still culminated in a difficult birth. But, when her precious Steven had been laid on her chest, Sarah had wept tears of joy, amazed at the tiny being in her arms. She didn’t care that he was small and sickly. All that concerned her was that he was here and she would make sure to give him everything he needed.
“It’s okay, Tony.” He takes Tony’s face in his hands and kisses the tip of his nose. “I was going to tell you about the prophecy while we ate. I had a whole speech planned out,” Steve laughs nervously. “But the seer Margaret, she told me that one day I’d find the person who was meant to stand by my side. They would be the truest of partners. The person with who I was meant to spend my life and lead the kingdom with. She said I would know them because I would feel a pull as though we were connected by invisible strings.”
The way Tony turns the word into a question makes Steve laugh. He plucks the flowers from his hands and begins wrapping the stems around each other to bind them together. He plucks a bloom from nearby and adds it to the crown. He lifts his head to look up at Tony and is entranced by how focused he is. He’s watching Steve with rapt attention, eyes following his hands as they wrap each stem around another to secure the crown.
When Tony still doesn’t answer, Steve stands and walks toward the easel. He finds Tony sitting with a book in his lap next to the shelf containing his paints and brushes and feels the blood drain from his face.
Pierce is not without his tricks, though. He backs further into the fireplace and doesn’t hesitate to toss some ash into Steven’s eyes. Keeping his eyes locked on Steven, he stands and doesn’t notice Sam and Bucky have finished with Rumlow and are now coming up behind him. They keep silent and disarm Pierce, pushing him to his knees. Once Steven can see again, he smiles and accepts the sword Bucky hands him. Pierce tries to plead for his life, but Steven knows that if he were to leave him alive, it would only be a matter of time before he tried something again. It is not an easy choice, but one that has to be made. Not only for his own safety but for the safety of his kingdom and the people in it.
“Gonna let me see my prize?” Steve’s eyes sparkle when he asks and bends down so he’s eye to eye with Tony. “Or are there more conditions?”
“I’m glad.” Steve moves in and takes Tony’s mouth. He licks at the seam of Tony’s mouth and when Tony opens, he sweeps inside and lets Tony experience the kiss with all his other senses.
As Tony moves the razor in precise strokes, his thoughts shift back to Steve. It’s not a new occurrence. His thoughts shift to Steve pretty often, but lately, those thoughts seem to be constant. He wants this to work out. Everyone keeps saying Steve has feelings for him and Tony hopes they’re right. He wants them to be right. He doesn't know what he would do if his feelings turned out to be one-sided. Steve would let him down kindly, but Tony's not sure he would be able to handle the heartbreak.
“You’re lucky I love you, Spangles.” Tony turns his head so he can catch Steve’s lips with his own. Steve kisses him back, taking his time to taste and tease his husband. Steve moves his hips in a way that he knows drives Tony wild, and Tony’s eyes roll back. “Touch me, Steve. Please. It’s been so long.”
Thinking on it, Tony realizes that could work. “It has been a while since we played chess. Maybe I could bring the board up and wait for him.” He looks over his shoulder at Bruce. “What do you think? Clean enough?”
Steve enters his room and wonders where his valet is before remembering he’d told him to take the rest of the night for himself. He begins undressing, fingers moving mechanically as his thoughts circle back to what had transpired earlier.
Muttering to himself about putting a bell on Steve, Tony drapes a cloth over his project and shoos him away from the table. “No.”
“Look at my boys.” Steve gets closer and smiles as Tony makes grabby hands toward him. “Come on, let me see our little insomniac.”
Steven knew what was coming. During the night, Sam’s falcon, Redwing, had come to his window with a message letting him know they were being taken to the dungeons. Steven was a little happy things were finally progressing, and he knew it wouldn’t take long for Sam and Bucky to free themselves. The whole time they’d been here, they’d been making friends with everyone who worked in the castle. They were all happy to do whatever they could to help. Pierce was a cruel and unjust king who let his knights do whatever they wanted without consequences.
“Hmm?” She pauses at a fresh bouquet and leans in to smell the fresh blooms. “I’m sure I have no idea what you are talking about. Perhaps, I let slip what your schedule was like for this week. And maybe I mentioned a few food pairings you enjoy, but the rest was all Anthony.”
“It’s just,” Steve releases Tony’s hand and his fingers brush over a spot just under his ear. “Just here.”
Steve takes Tony’s mouth, hand reaching between them to wrap around his cock. “And then I’m going to fuck you. Let you think of nothing but my cock holding you open, deep inside.” He strokes Tony’s cock slowly. “Moving in and out of you until we’re both unable to take it anymore.”
Tugging on Steve’s hair until he looks up, Bucky knows he needs to consider his words carefully. “While I cannot speak for Tony, if there’s one thing I do know,” He chuckles, “Tony has feelings for you, Stevie. When he’s not working on some project you are the first person he seeks out. He always wants your opinion on things and takes what you say seriously.”
Steve pauses and kisses his neck. “Breathe with me. In for five. And then out.” Tony’s breathing settles and Steve ties the blindfold. “Good, baby. So good for me. I won’t be far from you. You’ll always be able to reach out and touch.”
Tony removes his waistcoat himself and flops back on his bed. “The truth is that I was an idiot. Steve walked me back to my room after dinner and I took his hand and kissed it. I don’t know what came over me, Nat! I can usually keep my feelings in check! But lately,” he sits up and rubs at his chest.
“I finally picked a shape!” Tony ducks under the water and rinses out the soap. “I made some good progress once I had that figured out.”
When Tony gets out of the shower, he dries himself quickly and walks into the bedroom. He swallows hard when he sees what Steve has left out for him.
When the offer did come, Tony didn’t hesitate to accept. He took the prince’s hand and brought it to his lips. He's not sure why he did it, but it felt like the right thing at the time. He tried to remember everything he'd been taught about speaking with royalty, but as he tripped over his words, he did manage to get out that it would be the greatest honor to join the harem. If he also felt a slight pull from his chest whenever the prince was near, he decided not to mention it, believing it was just the excitement of what was happening.
After breakfast, and even more questions, they go out to train and Steve is not out there long before a footman comes looking for him. He passes along a message from the queen and Steve groans.
A healthy belch comes from Peter and Steve feels something wet and warm on his back. Tony tilts his head and tries not to laugh. “You still sure?”
“You are very welcome,” Jarvis swallows, tears suddenly filling his eyes. Tony has always been the child he and Ana wanted but never had. “Go, dear one. Enjoy your picnic.”
With everything in its place, Tony peeks outside and does a happy dance. He’s managed to finish early, and if he hurries, he will have plenty of time to really scrub at his skin and try and make himself look nice. Leaving the forge, he notices Rhodey up ahead and jogs to catch up with him. "Rhodey!"
Always happy to talk arrows, Clint begins describing how each of Tony’s newest creations had worked and what kinds of adjustments he feels need to be made. Tony listens, eager to hear what Clint has to say. While some of his descriptors are a little odd, Tony has known Clint long enough to be able to translate and make notes in his head on what Clint is telling him. He also asks his own questions here and there, making further notes about what he wants to try and accomplish the next day.
“Oh, kotenok. Have you not seen how our prince looks at you? Whenever you are holed up in your forge, he gets so sad. And the longer he doesn’t see you, the more snappish he gets. Even when you argue, he comes back looking flushed and eager. He seeks you out so often, Anthony. Maybe he feels the same pull you do.”
As soon as they’d arrived back in Brooklyn, it had been Steve himself who saw to getting Tony settled. After showing Tony his room, he asked a simple question, “what do you love doing?”
“Alright, alright.” Tony kisses him as he gets off the bed and goes into the bathroom for a damp rag. When he comes back, he wipes the spit-up off Steve’s back and tosses the washcloth toward the hamper. “The bassinet is still in here, do you want to put him down in there?”
“Good boy.” Steve’s hand slides from Tony’s shoulder to his hand. “We’re going to the couch. You’re going to kneel for me and I’ve got some tasty treats for you.”
Hands skimming over Tony’s ribs, Steve digs his fingers in a little until he feels Tony flinch and start to giggle. “Please, sweetheart?” Tony says no again and Steve kisses him, still tickling him. “How about a hint? Just a little one?”
Leaning back on the couch, Steve strokes himself through his pants. “You have been awfully well behaved.”
“Good boy.” Steve pulls the blindfold from his pocket. “We’re going to try a blindfold tonight. And I picked this special just for you. Can you guess why?”
“What?” Tony’s compliments are still ringing in his ears so he doesn’t notice where he’s looking at first. He turns his head and sees Tony looking at his easel. “Oh, that. Yes. I enjoy painting.”
Tony passes Peter over to Steve who arranges him over his shoulder and begins patting his back. The first time he’d had to burp Peter, he’d been terrified he’d hurt their baby. It had been Tony who reassured him and stayed close, both laughing at the burp that came from the tiny person in Steve’s arms.
“Just a little longer?” He rests his head on Steve’s chest and lets himself float. “Want you to fuck me against the wall next time.”
Laughing again, Bucky lets Steve go and gives him a little shove. “We are all aware, but he still considers what you have to say. Have you really not noticed the way he lights up when you praise his newest projects?”
Sarah looked over at the crib where her son was sleeping peacefully. Margaret was right. They would do everything in their power to ensure Steven would be prepared for whatever danger comes his way. She would talk to Joseph, tell him about the vision and decide how to help their son become the warrior he was destined to become.
Margaret had been counting the days since the festivities had ended knowing the queen would call for her soon. She walked through the castle without being seen, her steps taking her straight to the nursery. It was no surprise to find Steven’s nursery was the room next to the one Sarah shared with Joseph. She’d waited so long for a child and would want him close. She could still remember the visit she’d received from a desperate Sarah a year prior asking why she was not able to have a child. Margaret had taken her hands and made her promise to not give up hope. She had hated being unable to give her queen a definite answer, but Margaret had known destiny had plans for Sarah and Joseph.
While Tony looks through the paintings, Steve begins setting up their picnic. He spreads out the blanket he brought in a sunny spot and frowns. Something is missing. His eyes land on the small sofa he’d brought into the room and he jogs over to it with a grin. He grabs the cushions and brings them over, creating a cozy, intimate space for them.
“I know, baby. You’re gorgeous. I wanna draw you like this one day. Let you float while I get every last line of you on paper.”
Tony cleans up the remnants of their lunch and moves the basket out of the way. Steve watches him, curious what he is going to do next. When Tony begins arranging the pillows, Steve finally understands and waits for Tony to finish.
Intercepting Steve’s pacing, Bucky gets his arm around him. Steve is stiff for a moment but once he realizes Bucky isn’t letting go, he relaxes. Bucky rubs his back and waits for Steve’s breathing to even out before loosening his hold.
He doesn’t need to be told twice. He rushes out of the room and jogs to his own. Most just get out of the way, but the one or two who try and have a word get quick rushed apologies and promises to talk later as Steve runs by. He can’t stop now, He has to keep going. Has to get to Tony.
The word, ‘no’, is on the tip of Steve’s tongue, but before he can say it, he pauses. In the beginning, he did not feel that way about Tony. He liked him, wanted to be his friend, wanted him to be part of the harem, but he hadn’t wanted anything romantic or sexual. As their friendship grew and deepened, that had begun to change. Now, Steve can be lying in bed, trying to sleep and he’d imagine what it would be like to have Tony sleeping beside him. His thoughts have also begun to stray more and more to what Tony’s lips would feel like pressed against his.
When the flower crown settles on Steve’s head, he can’t stop smiling. He’d enjoyed helping Tony make it, his fingers moving with Tony’s as they twined the flower stems together. The first time Tony did it on his own, he gleefully showed Steve and did a delighted little shimmy. Their words flowed easily as they worked, and Steve told Tony how his favorite flowers were sunflowers because when he was young his father had brought a bouquet for his mother, but also had a smaller one for him too.
Time must be allowed to extricate Pepper’s feelings so thoroughly from Mr. Hammer. She would have to allow a small mark of empathy towards Pepper for her attachment to Mr. Hammer, no small feat considering how horrifically his true colors had marked her attitude toward him. However, such a progress may be made, that in Mr. Hammer’s return they both may be allowed to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance. Both without Pepper’s sentiments being raised again, and without Antonia (for all her fiery storm) betraying her own and calling him out in a public setting.
Miss Hill gasped slightly, “But it is not safe. And now Miss Ross has become Mrs Banner you must find a walking companion. What if you had walked into the
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again at the Cage’s dinner, and for a longer time than ever before.
The car is silent to begin with, Tony staring out into the dark, Sam mumbling in his sleep in the backseat, Steve focusing on driving entirely too much for a guy who once drove a truck one handed into a glacier.
“Lieutenant Rogers is in stable condition and we hope to move him to Val-de-Grace in France tomorrow. I must warn you he will not look how you are used to seeing him -“
“Never, madam.” He cried, “Never. Miss Potts is a very good sort of girl; and I am sure to see her happily and respectably settled, someone will look over her circumstance. I wish her well, but I am not, I think, quite so much to
Bruce and Betty's daughter is named Harriet as a nod to the original, far more vacuous, Harriet of the novel.
“Do you want to come inside?” Steve asks, helpless. Tony shakes his head empathically and repeatedly.
“Okay, okay, okay.” He repeats, for himself as much for Tony, takes a moment to rein in the impatient part of him that wants to take take take. “To be clear - you want-“
Tony is aware of pain, far off like it’s coming to him from underwater. He’s sunk to his knees on the cold floor with a clatter, can feel fear round his heart like a vice. He pushes worry down the bond, panic escalating in his throat when he gets nothing back. He gets a scream of confusion and agony in feedback before silence so oppressive it’s like smothering out a candle. It’s only made worse for the fact
Tony isn’t sure what he’s being blamed for here but not wanting to be seen in public with the embodiment of perfection is
worse.” Antonia intoned, stressing every word in hopes the mention of his beloved would awaken him from the excitement he was infused with.
And if the laugh Steve barks out sounds a bit wet, broken and glorious, it’s between him and Tony’s lab group.
Miss Hill soon came, “Very happy and obliged. I’m so very sorry to keep you waiting.” but Antonia’s inner thoughts told her there was not the same cheerful ease and manner as before.
“I went only to the post office,” she spoke, “and reached home before the rain was too much. It is my daily errand. I always felt letters when I am here. A walk before breakfast does me good.”
Steve’s saved from answering when Sam chooses this very moment to startle awake with a gasp, “Guys, don’t panic. But I think Shield’s turned into a car.” He mumbles, and Steve huffs a laugh.
At Tony’s words Steve’s brain goes silent as lust kicks into overdrive, roars forward with a sudden and all encompassing need. He fumbles for his bedside drawer, rolls his eyes fondly as Tony giggles at his clumsy pawing of the shelf until he finds what he’s looking for.
“T, I don’t want to take advantage.” Steve protests, weakly, even as his limbs are already moving like they desperately want to doze in a position that isn’t half upright. Tony fixes him with an incredulous look, one he’s been reliably informed by Jarvis has every ounce of ‘snark he’d expect to see from one so opinionated’.
So instead of finding herself in all sorts of mischief with her new companion, she found herself at home instead, perched on the chaise by her content mother, staring at the back of Steven’s head.
It’s with that thought that he travels down Tony’s body and licks a swipe across the head of Tony’s cock with no preamble.
Antonia sat at the seat proffered by Mrs May and accepted the cup of tea she poured with a nod, “Why yes.”
“Mr Stark hasn’t left his workshop since arriving back this morning and my monitors tell me he isn’t performing at optimum - protocol set out by Miss Potts dictates I should call in someone to quote, “get his ass out of that bloody place”, endquote.”
Every single time Steve goes up against danger and comes up short, you can find Tony beside his hospital bed, knuckles white. The serum works overtime in these periods to stitch Steve back together, and Tony is forever terrified that this will be the time Erskine’s formula calls it quits.
“It’s my duty to know what my client might want on an evening and be prepared for it. I’m paid well enough to do so.”
Tony classifies this time as Time Steve Spends with His Eyes Not Fixed on Tony (aka periods of time when Tony is Really Fucking Stressed and You Should Stay Away). He busies himself with keeping his lover tidy. He’ll shave his face, cut his hair and wash his chest with an intimacy that leaves anyone else feel like they are intruding. When Steve wakes, it is always to Tony, and the smile he graces him with makes the protests Tony has phrased in his head die on his lips.
He turns sixteen in front of his bathroom mirror with a chill across his skin, goosebumps on his arms, and a burn across his sternum. A wet laugh bubbles up from his mouth, too close to tears, as he watches avidly as ink pours across his skin. It’s bold and black and can’t be missed as it carves across his left collarbone and then shimmers and settles up against the hollow of his throat. Three conjoined spirals stare back at him in beautiful defiance, warm his skin and makes him feel alight. He skims his fingers over them, and idly wonders if his other half is somewhere out there doing the same. His are jet black and solid, which according to Cayce means the half to his whole is already out there, has already experienced the change. He thumbs the top spiral, presses into it, and gasps when he feels his stomach twist and a mirror feeling that he can’t shake that his soulmark is doing the same.
hit metal, he chokes out a sob of relief and works feverishly to remove the rest of the brick that covers Tony. Without a second thought he rips the face plate away like Thor did in the last battle Tony lay down on the wire and he’s only partly conscious of the fact tears roll down his face.
Steve’s eyes won’t track properly, swinging across the room. “Yes. Please.” He chokes out past the smoke on his tongue.
Eventually coming to the door of Miss Hill’s abode, she knocked and heard a bustle behind the door. She heard Miss Hill’s voice, and as she was ushered in by the maid the aunt and niece both seemed to be escaping into the adjoining room. Natasha she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and before the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Hill saying “Well, my dear, I shall
So Clint Barton is a capital dancer, I understand. We shall see if our styles suit. A fine young man certainly is Clint Barton, I like him very well.”
Steve stood in front of Shield, ignoring the panic that choked his throat. What if Tony didn’t show? Yesterday’s ensuing explanation seemed to just be a show of how far Steve’s foot could end up down his throat.
“Forgive me, Miss. Stark, Mrs. Stark.” He bowed so low Antonia could see the patch of thinned hair at the tip of his crown, making sure to hide her smirk before addressing the room, “But I was delayed in the village on the errand of one whose business I hold only
Clint Barton placed a word before Miss Romanov. She gave a slight glance around the table and applied herself to it. Clint was next to Antonia, Jane opposite them – and Captain Rogers so placed as to see the all; and it was his aim to see as much as he could, with idle and casual observation. She gazed at the jumble of letters, apparently coming onto the origin, before fixing Mr. Barton with a stare fiercer than one he’d owe to Natasha Romanov, pushing the row of letters back at him. Clint Barton smiled, with an unkindness to it, and pushed it back at her. They passed it between them like bickering children for a minute more before Pepper cried out, eager for work.
So that’s how it happened. And now we are back in again with the clusterfuck that is Steve G. Rogers life.
Mr. Hammer was still talking, and Antonia was disappointed when she found he was only giving his fair companion an account of yesterday’s party at his friend Cole’s. Not only seemingly innocent, but also a fairly tedious subject.
Nat surfaces first, “Nah, we’ll get a cab.” She locks eyes with Steve, who has an arm round a sleepy Tony, “Take care boys.”
“So, what next?” Tony answers instead, not taking the conversation to where he’s sure it could end up. Steve has brief visions of Tony crawling over the gearstick and landing in his lap like he belongs there. Of steamed windows and wandering hands. He directs a quick bout of annoyance at Sam murmuring away in the back.
Mrs. Marvel. To come amongst us with affection and faith engaged, but with manners so very disengaged. And how could she
Or at least until he had found out that the Captain had a seriously filthy mouth that could probably make a sailor blush. During their first battle, one that wasn’t very demanding due to the fact the things they were facing were simply giant puppies whose biggest safety hazard was the strands of drool pooling from their mouths, Steve used the private comm to explain to Tony
"Tony," he says softly, in the tone of someone who has had this conversation a million times before, "I know. You'd make a good prostitute."
. It still felt bizarre to say it. He thumbed the wedding band encircling his finger, spinning it round the digit in a patten already familiar to him. It didn't take long for Steve to notice him doing it, for him to reach forward and clasp his hand. "Some post honeymoon gift from Von Doom." Tony scoffed quietly to him, "remind me not to send him a thank you card."
“Disappointing.” He says, words monotone and voice flat, before handing his progeny back to his still sweating wife. He wipes his hands on his suit trousers, and spots the nurse who stands in the corner of the room track the movement. He treats her to a grin, one that is not kind or pleasant, and she shrinks into herself even more.
Coulsons.” Antonia mused later as Pepper and her trudged through the countryside, “I believe her to be even more reserved than I remember. So secretive and unforthcoming. And why would she come stay in Miss. Hill’s
of your bedroom a particular fashion statement? Maybe I should bring my own to match.” Steven delivered with a smirk and a glint of humour in his eye, and Antonia felt an unbecoming flush rising to her face, hurrying to put herself together. This side effect of Steven’s attention was becoming increasingly hard to bear, making itself apparent this past season.
What follows is nothing too much of note, Antonia thinks, just simple gentle guiding of Pepper through dinner etiquette with a series of frowns, nods, and smiles where appropriate.
Now, he makes love like every time is going to be their last and Tony doesn’t know what else to do but press his fingers into Steve’s skin and groan, trying to provide him with a lodestar in the midst of Steve’s panic.
Tony’s breath trembles, a frightened thing, and through slow going he finally comes to Steve as naked as he is.
” Steve speaks now, voice firm and loud cutting across the general madness of the room, “because I am getting laid. On the regular. By my boyfriend. He’s the one doing the … laying. I’m dating Tony Stark.”
“We will discuss no more, you are always so keen to find me disagreeable.” Antonia remarks in a cool tone.
“Nothing.” He lets the words rush out at once, “nothing. Tony you did nothing. Tony you were, you were everything. When I woke up, I never felt like I left the ice. Everything was so cold, and I just thought that it was fine, I could cope limping through this life so long as I had a job to do, so long as I didn’t look too closely at the world I was protecting because I wasn’t sure I’d like what I would find.” And maybe it’s the dregs of the nightmare, maybe it’s the sight of so much of Tony’s skin, the look in Tony’s eyes, that has him confessing like sins to an altar. “But you. You made me feel again, you gave me a home. You gave me a purpose, gave me a reason I wanted to suit up and fight and do whatever it took. Because even if we were losing, we’d do that together. And I found that I didn’t mind that. I didn’t even mind the thought of losing, if you were by my side.”
Mr. Clint Barton did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Marvel’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, and his letter spoke at length of his “great mortification and regret”.
“Oh, yes, we do to be sure.” His father, cried “Mrs. Hill –  we passed them on the journey here. She stood at the window. I remember you knew her at a younger age also, and a fine girl she is. Please do call upon her.”
She is not allowed to dwell on mischief too long, the conversation turns to brightness, and the evening is mostly pleasant aside Mrs. Hammers remarks here and there that dug like little burrs into Antonia’s sides. It wasn’t too long before her dinner even featured some very exciting news, courtesy of Mr. Marvel.
Advanced healing has its perks, one being that even if he practices throwing his punches against a sandbag to the point his knuckle wrappings become red with blood there is no scarring, and by the time breakfast rolls around with the other Avengers no one is any the wiser.
Under a bright midday sun, at nearly the height of Midsummer, Mrs. Stark was conveyed in her carriage, one window down to enjoy the breeze, to partake in this al-fresco party. Captain Rogers had prepared one of her favourite rooms, the library that looked out onto the gardens, especially for her with the fire warming at the hearth all morning to make sure she did not catch a chill. Whilst made of iron, she was a woman whose bones enjoyed welcoming the cold far too easily, and he did not want Antonia to ever have to spend time that should be about enjoyment worrying about her mother’s care. She was most thankful, and waved Antonia away to enjoy the afternoon, firmly seated with a throw and a good book.
with promise and potential that he could practically burst. He’s watching Widow jump on one of the animals from behind, Tony use his repulsors to turn one to ash, Banner take down two in one swoop of his wrist and Thor demolish four with a throw of Mjolnir and he feels so proud of this little dysfunctional family he almost takes his eye off the animals trying to kill them all.
“We will discuss no more, you are always so keen to find me disagreeable.” Antonia remarks in a cool tone.
And in that lapse of concentration a Jorgenheim batters into him from behind and forces the breath from his lungs. Spluttering, he looks for his shield and can’t find it – probably buried between another animal’s ribs, and for the first time as he watches the eagle-like thing rear up onto its hind legs he offers up a plea hoping the man upstairs isn’t calling his time.
“Why isn’t this in a well ventilated protective frame?” Tony blinks, and Steve tries to school his tone, “sorry, why is this not in a well ventilated frame?”
Some change of countenance was necessary for both of them as they walked into Mrs. Marvel’s drawing room – Antonia must calm her racing heart and flushed face, Steven Rogers must disperse his odd gazes and serious tone. Antonia must smile less, and Captain. Rogers more, to fit them for the place. Antonia could not help the smile as nature prompted, show herself just as happy as she was for it was a true enjoyment to be with the Marvels. Mr. Marvel was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserved, as to his wife.
Steven always lifts a room upon entering, but this time he does so with such a commanding air it stops the room dead. His broad shoulders fill the doorway, and his gaze lands on Antonia, soft and as warm as the crackling fire of Highbury. “Now I don’t wish to alarm anyone, but the snow has begun to fall, fairly fast, but there is no danger of anyone being marooned here by it.” He speaks only to Antonia now, “I’ve just been down the Highbury road, the snow currently is not above half an inch anywhere. I believe Maria should head home to Highbury, with you and Elizabeth for sure. I can round up the rest and make sure everyone gets home safely.”
“Tony will survive Steve, I am sure of it.” Thor, as ever, is honest and direct, not beating around the bush or hesitant to offer anything but a 50/50 verdict like the doctors Steve is beginning to loathe. He clasps a hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezes, “He’s got too much left to give this world.”
It’s Bucky, “Hey man. I’m not here to bug you. Just wanted to run some plans Nat and I have sketched out around Stark’s systems. I think we’ve made some good progress.”
“Have you never heard that good things come to those who wait?” Steve replies, near panting through the desire that clogs his throat.
Steven had laughed, such a long laugh that allowed his mouth to tremble upright at the corners in that way Antonia was so fond of, “To be sure, I do not doubt you would. But leave out your meddling and let him choose his own wife. Believe me, a man of six-and-twenty can take care of himself.”
He stares at his love for as long as he can before blinking, filling up on the sight of him, feeling his equilibrium return.
Steven’s face was red in apoplexy, “A man does not imagine any such thing Antonia, don’t turn this into one of your lectures! Miss Potts refuse Mr Rhodes? It is madness. You must be mistaken.”
It doesn’t stop his heart soaring when he sees a small envelope, slightly crushed, in his personal mailbox. He tells himself it might not be Steven. But no one writes to Tony. His name and address sprawls across the front in chicken script, slanted like the writer spelled it out in a hurry. He holds the letter close to his heart, rushes to his room, and closes the door with excitement wrapping around his lungs like a vice.
"I can't believe - I'm so sorry - it's just one night stays booked last minute with late night check-ins are a red flag and well - well." Liam splutters, gesturing at Steve's attire, which only serves to make the
Randall’s was home to one Mr. and Mrs. Marvel. A couple of exceptionable character, easy fortune, and incredible estate. Maria got on well with the pair, and as such an open invite always wormed its way to them every Christmastime. It was a busy party, though invites were still highly sought after. As such, the inclusion of Virginia on the list was one Antonia worked hard to achieve, but was glad to see it come to fruition. Perhaps, in an evening of merriment and slightly sped up through inebriety, there would be a love confession from a certain vicar? Antonia could only hope fervently for such.
Steve feels the weight of his joy screaming through his skin. His hands skate over Tony’s figure, land on his ass, and make a home there. He absentmindedly kneads the flesh, delighting in the groan against his lips he’s rewarded with. They don’t break for what feels like an eternity, a battle to see who can crawl first into the other’s bones and stay there. Tony scrabbles for purchase against his shirt, needy fingers clawing at anything he can reach. Steve thinks he hears the rip of fabric, and idly thinks about how this is one of his favourite shirts, before he can think of little else than Tony’s incredibly
“She seems to have a sixth sense whenever he gives his attention elsewhere and call his conscience home, that much is true.” Elizabeth adds in agreement, she lowers her tone as the gentleman follow behind, “She keeps him like a dog on a lead.”
“Never.” Tony whispers back, and Steve leans in, pressing his forehead to Tony’s, rubbing his thumb across his lower lip and Tony can’t help but grant him entrance. Steve presses a thumb in, seeking heat and when Tony laves the digit with his tongue he watches Steve’s eyes dilate before the man reluctantly pulls his thumb out and lifts it to his own mouth, sucking it dry. This moment should be a little bit filthy and dirty, but Tony feels laid bare.
“You are going to put me to my knees, going to guide your cock down my throat, so hurried you can’t even get the rest of your clothes off.” As Steve speaks he settles in between Tony’s sprawled legs, only pausing to mouth at the crotch of Tony’s jeans, wrestling a tortured groan from his mouth. He pulls Tony’s cock out without much preamble, looks down at it with unadulterated lust. “Will you let me, Mr Stark? Will you let me suck you?”
Steve is suddenly all too aware of how much skin he has bared in contrast to Tony still almost fully clothed. He’s gorgeously rumpled nonetheless, and Steve reaches forward for the bottom of his T-shirt with grabby hands.
(For whilst she promises herself she isn’t a matchmaker, she can’t help a gentle nudge here or there, lest she never see her grandchildren.)
“Steve, he almost died. Do not think that’s the best example you could have given.” Bucky smirks, “Want to talk about it?”
And to make things better, the lame horse recovered so fast in the meanwhile that the party to Potomac Hill was again under happy consideration. Donwell settled on for one day, and Potomac Hill the next – the weather appearing exactly right.
Steve doesn’t talk once, just watches the others, and is thankful for the contemplative quiet. It is there, sat round the table with the only people he’s met since waking up after the ice who don’t expect him to be anything other than what he can be, that the super soldier finally begins to try to heal.
“Steve!” he coughs out a shout, and Steve gives a moment to thank Bucky for being anywhere but here. Tony’s noises are for him and him alone, and he growls at the thought of anyone else hearing him.
He’s just starting to think his stomach is about to rebel and expel itself from his system in protest, when the lab door thunders open, startlingly loud into the quiet of tinkering and metal on metal. His supervisor, Hank, looks up ready to shout at the offender, rendered mute by what greets him.
The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice subdued but still audible to everybody.
Whilst she was gone, Antonia busied herself by irritating Jarvis with constant quick-witted questions, and sitting with her mother for as long as she could (which, naturally, amounted to less than a half hour. Antonia was never one for sitting still).
ass. He is currently holding the ass of a man who features as an answer on Wheel of Fortune. This cannot possibly be his life.
Rhodey and Pepper sleep on the couch that night, far enough that Tony doesn’t feel trapped but close enough that he knows they are there. His eyes hurt from where he has tried to blot out the visions of Steve and
And it’s just like Tony to dress up his words, to hide a confession so earth-shattering behind quick wit and smart language. Here, it says, take what I tell you, but only if you can decipher what I mean behind cock-sure arrogance meant to protect it.
She looked at Steven and mouthed a word of thanks, as the conversation progressed as to the kindness and generosity of one Captain. Rogers. Antonia joined in, before making a concentrated effort to change the subject to one of planning, knowing how much Steven hated the spotlight on himself.
“I am not going to pretend.” He agreed, “Though it was a shame the ball was cancelled, for you. You don’t get many opportunities to dance, or to get out at all.” He remarked with a joke, watching as her eyes flashed once more.
Steve flushes with anger now, swarming up from his desk, “How can you say that?! You’d have only kicked me out come sunrise, I thought I better do us both a favour and spare the awkward morning after!”
The little window lets in a small modicum of light, enough so that Antonia is aware of the way Miss Hill looks round the room instead of at her in hopes that Antonia doesn’t see the tears trembling in her eyes, but it remains dark enough that Antonia can pretend she doesn’t see them.
The weather continued much the same all the following morning, and the same loneliness and melancholy plagued Hartfield – but in the afternoon it cleared. The wind changed into a softer quarter, the clouds carried off, the sun appeared, and summer reigned again. Antonia resolved to be out doors for as much as possible. Never had the tranquility and peacefulness of her gardens attracted her more. She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce, and she joined her mother for a few turns about the garden, commenting on what needed pruning or shaping for the height of heat ahead.
“To be sure – our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.” Antonia said, sarcasm ever slightly colouring her tone.
Antonia was rather proud having given Pepper’s fancy a better direction than before. She was far more sensible upon agreeing that Mr. Hammer was agreeable in features as much as he was in manners. Antonia was subtle, at least she felt she was, in creating a liking on Pepper’s side. Her mother and Steven might disagree.
The air turns syrup thick as they both have a moment to realise what’s to come. Tony, proudly and gorgeously naked spread out underneath Steve, chest to chest, skin to skin. Tony pulls at his trousers with grabby hands and Steve huffs an indulgent laugh before pushing his pants down and off until they are both finally and gloriously naked together.
It didn’t take long for the entire team to move into Stark Tower. Steve was one of the first to arrive, looking for a place to stay in New York when his sad little 70 year back pay ran out. Despite the fact the bank account had many more zeroes than Steve had ever seen before, money doesn’t stretch nearly as far as it did, even for one as frugal as him.
“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and woman, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.”
Busy as he was, seemingly engaged in attention to Miss Romanov, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Antonia again.
“If they are anything like what I was as a little girl then the salary is probably not generous enough.” Antonia says self-deprecatingly.
“I have to confess,” Captain Rogers speaks now, voice quiet, confused, but with a thread of something that sounds almost like hope to Antonia’s ears, “I was not sure how far you were entangled. But however small your regard, he did not deserve it. Such disgraceful behavior I have not seen.”
“I met James.” Steve starts, and Tony’s stomach just bottoms out. He can’t speak past the drought in his throat, and he can feel bile rising to his mouth.
Happy life or not, Antonia would admit to hosting a certain… jealousy towards Miss Romanov. Despite the nasty tongue rumours could have, the words on Miss Romanov were nothing but achingly pleasant and praise-filled. Oh how
When she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but in general he looked grave upon her. She wished he could love a ballroom better, could like Clint Barton better. He seemed to observe her, but she knew better than to flatter herself into thinking that he thought well of her dancing. But there was nothing untoward in her behavior, nothing even remotely like a flirtation between her and her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. She didn’t examine why that particular thought didn’t upset her.
Rhodey finds him later, phone disintegrated into pieces against the counter top, tears stumbling down his face.
“No.” Antonia replies, catches her mother’s glance and quickly makes sure to follow, “but Highbury has all I want. I never need to travel.”
“Very natural that you should be so grateful!” Antonia bit back her excitement, let what sense clung to her guide her still, “But, be careful. Do not let yourself get carried away with your feelings. Check your feelings while you can; do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking for you. Be observant of him. Let his behavior be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I will never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Let no name pass or lips. He is your superior, no doubt, but there have been many happy and unequal marriages! But, know that I know the man in question and I approve,
“They couldn’t handle the truth I was laying down” Steve says, the rest of the group shouting every word in tandem with the well-worn knowledge that only years of friendship can bring. Despite himself, he feels a grin tremble around the edge of his mouth.
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his marriage. It also helped that whatever Steven had said to him, whilst he remained utterly tight lipped on the words spoken, had obviously left an imprint. Upon meeting again, she was glad of Captain. Rogers company, taking a vicious joy in how his pallid (
“My being charming, is not quite enough to entice me to marry; I must find other people – or rather one person charming. I assure you, I have no intention of marrying at all. Someone very superior would have to come along. And even then I would rather not be tempted.” She squirms as she speaks, ears aflame as though she’s been caught out on a lie. She brushes away the thoughts of golden hair and deft fingers.
“I have been on the bike all night.” Steve says, and despite the fact his skin looks waxy, hair limpid and eyes sullen, Tony still loves how he looks in bike leathers.
Natasha grabs his arm and looks down at his knuckles, still red raw from the sandbag earlier than morning before the fight. He doesn’t like her look of pity.
“I’ve had worse.” Tony, as ever, tries to crack a joke, though it falls flat in the otherwise silent room as they remember the experiences that have led Tony to experience ‘worse’.
“I do hope you are talking of Miss Potts cold. We are all aware of the danger.” Mr. Hammer interjects, placing himself in the middle of Mrs. Marvel and Antonia on the chaise. It causes him to brush up close beside her, and his hand brushes her leg in a way that, if she wasn’t still clinging on to the hope he would be good for Virginia, would have caused Antonia to cause a scene something ferocious. She saw, out of the corner of her eye, Steven grow antsy, and feign a need for fresh air. Oh how she wished she could join him than stay here under Mr. Hammer’s mounting inappropriate affections!
“Now, Miss. Stark. The beginning of the painting I see before me indicates previous practice, honing of your enormous talent.” Mr. Hammer came close to Antonia’s painting, index finger curving across the picture without quite touching it.
Mrs May was the mistress of a real and honest old-fashioned boarding school where girls were sent, often to be out of the way, and work their way into an education, but never enough to be boastful. The school was held in high repute – Mrs May keeping the children in a house of ample house and garden that in the summer opened its impressive bay doors to the sun to allow the children to bask in the warmth, and in the winter cultivated a fire so hearty it kept the house warm enough to wander without winter clothes.
So! I am just as shocked as you are - that this is it. This is the ending to something I started over 5 years ago with high expectations that had me dead in the water. I read this back, and I'm not even sure I like it half the time. But I like being able to see how I've evolved as a writer.
He chomps in happy silence, taking shelter in the knowledge that kids his age usually don’t understand unspoken words, nervous tension. He can play for oblivious, and she doesn’t know enough about him to see through it. She sighs, a long and weary thing, reaching to push her greying hair back past her ear, when he sees it. A bouquet of flowers sprawl across her left wrist, and he has to smother a gasp.
Bruce’s eyes are kind, “Come on, you’ll be no good to us if you don’t eat. I’m surprised your stomach hasn’t put up much more of fight, any longer and they’d probably have to put you into a medically induced coma.” He says these words with no judgement, no anger, only in a tone you’d chide a child with. Steve feels guilt hit him like a two tonne truck
“No. Not bad at all.” Tony comes round the bar, having fixed them both a drink of iced water, directing him to sit on one of the couches. Steve sinks into it, and rather than sitting elsewhere Tony sits right beside him.
"They thought I was a prostitute, Tony." Steve's voice as a rumble, crackling and cutting through the confusion.
The whole party had just reassembled in the drawing room after dinner when Mr. Marvel made his appearance among them. He had been unable to be a fixture for the dinner, but he made up for it by walking to Hartfield as soon as it was over. Mr. Banner was in astonishment, - that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed company until bed time, of finishing off his day in efforts of being civil and noise. Could he have been clicked his fingers and been back to his dear wife and other children he would have done so. For introverted as he was – long evenings forced to be social were not his speed.
Tony removes himself from Steve’s lap slowly, like he can’t bear to do it, trailing his arm across Steve’s shoulder in a way that sends shivers up Steve’s spine. There’s surprise in Tony’s eyes, but also a wicked glint that’s making Steve realize that yes, this could distinctly get worse.
“The awkward flirting is what got you? Man you must be smitten, I find watching it worse than pulling teeth.” Sam interjects, and Steve whirls on him with betrayal in his eyes.
Her obvious and distasteful shock at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, at there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties. She wanted unbroken card packs with separate candles, more waiters engaged for evenings, more proper order and civility than she apparently viewed from Highbury. It drove Antonia wild.
“So, how did Steve trick you into a relationship? We have bets to fulfill.” Clint makes an awfully obvious subject change in the silence, but everyone’s thankful for it.
"All that talk of attractive people, and I still didn't catch your name?" Tony asks, and at this point Steve feels emboldened, drunk on the number he now has in his contacts, on the smile Tony keeps gracing him with, like he's the most fascinating thing Tony has ever seen.
“That’s true,” she cried – “so true. Little Harriet, grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.” Her voice drops an octave, “I cannot claim to be sorry that Virginia took my advice. I only want to know that Mr. Rhodes is not so very, very bitterly disappointed.”
Bucky quietly puts Steve in touch with Sam Wilson, a counsellor working for the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Steve's a hard worker, and he gets noticed and promoted fast. He doesn't stay 'just' a former soldier with an honourable discharge for long.
“Christmas weather.” Observed Mr. Hammer, not to be swayed by Banner’s impolite reply, “Quite seasonable, and at least we are fortunate enough that it did not begin yesterday and impede today’s party. I was once snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week and nothing could have been more pleasant.”
Steve comes back in the room at this precise moment, groans like he saw what was coming. Tony can’t mask his delight, nods like a puppet on string. The evening slowly declines into itself, and trust it to take Steve to take a day, one normally reserved for dark thoughts and bruises, and lovingly restore it into what it’s meant to be. For new found family, forged in the fire, for celebrating a bond so exciting it steals Tony’s breath out his throat.
“Jarvis once told me that the only man that would do for me would be one that could challenge me without controlling me. Who could love me without commanding me. I used to think him mad, for such a man could not exist, and yet you burst into my life; immovable and determined to prove me wrong. I admit I have been slower than you to realise that I loved you, but it seems that now my mind is made up it is determined to catch up. My mind cannot focus on nothing but you.”
Steve takes in his prime view of Tony’s cock. It’s a very pretty cock, smaller than Steve’s own but thick, flushed and heavy when Steve takes it in his palm. Precum drips copiously from the slit, and when Steve takes it and rubs it along Tony’s length he feels Tony’s groan rumble through his body.
“Yes! Yes of course! Come, we – that is to say you – must write this letter at once! To delay would be discourteous and unfeeling.” Gently steering Virginia to the study, Antonia congratulates herself soundly on navigating this sticky situation with such prowess.
Although, it was made better by being able to form an opinion, however uncharitable, that the woman was no more than ‘pleasing’ to the eye. Yes, Pepper was far her superior in grace and beauty. She did not really like her, though she admitted she hurried to find a fault out of retribution. Her person was rather good; her face not
Antonia’s wonder lessened somewhat, with something akin to horror, upon seeing Mr. Hammer sauntering about. He would not ask Pepper to dance if it were possible to be avoided; she was sure he would not – and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.
"Anyway," he coughs out eventually, before sliding two sleek black key cards across the marble desk, "please accept our best penthouse suit, with our most humble apologies. If you need anything at all, or wish to take this further I," he gulps, "I completely understand Mr Stark."
(If only they’d been Namor tech, that man had been hounding him so recklessly it would have been believable)
“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it. A young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious and selfish, is likely to be proud, luxurious and selfish by default. If Clint Barton wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his age – what is he? – three or four and twenty – cannot be without the means of doing just that. Of leaving under his own power. It is impossible.”
“I want everything you’ve just said. I do. Shit - Steve - I want to tattoo it on my skin, I want to take out a two page ad in the Chronicle. I just - I just need to deal with college, I want Howard to be able to do nothing about it. Which means I need to be 21. Can you wait for me?”
They begin at the same time before stopping. Tony grins and the moment is gone. “You go first.” Steve offers.
, she has a moment to think bizarrely before he pulls her out onto the dance floor, and bundles her into his arms.
“Steve. Trust me, I’m in your bed because I want to be here. I’m just embarrassed I fell asleep on you.”
She thankfully brushed past him as he stood in the centre of the room as she spoke, to light candles in the corners of the drawing room. It meant Steven could wrestle the thoughts that must be as clear as day across his face back into the shadows.
They are stopped now in the eaves of the gardens, and both are so wrapped in the other that they do not notice Maria and Jarvis stood with their noses pressed against the glass of the bay doors of Hartfield, breath fogging the windows like young children at a sweet shop.
And, well, Steve’s never been one to shirk orders. Especially when they come wrapped up in a package so stunning.
Steve grins, rocks back on his heels, and slowly unbuttons the shirt that’s driven Tony crazy all evening.
And it isn’t a curse word and angry shout flip out. The emotions that have been bottled up inside come loose and explode through his body. It’s a punch through the wall and screaming until his voice cracks flip out. An earth-shaking, tear the place apart flip out. Steve didn’t realise he had so much anger inside of him until he’s standing holding the debris of his rage in his hands observing the wreck he’s made of the place. So many people assume him to be calm, quiet and rational. They forget he used to be the skinny kid from Brooklyn always looking for a fight, and ready to punch his way out of each one.
“I am sorry my dear, but it is the truth.” Miss Hill continues, not aware of the odd atmosphere the room is adopting.
To the majority of them, he’s still “Cap” and he sure as hell hasn’t earned the right to be called “Steve”.
Steve is dangerously stunning, body made for battle, cock thick and hanging heavy between his legs. Steve is his and Tony doesn’t think he’ll ever get over it, ever understand what he’s done to deserve this man to come home to, this man who is wicked and decadent in a way only he gets to see. It’s a quick move to the bed, Tony sinking down onto the sheets with Steve quick to follow above him. Steve’s large frame looming across him should make Tony feel trapped, but all he feels is freedom.
At this moment Clint began talking so vigorously that Antonia could not but imagine he heard his own praises, and did not want to hear more.
That seems to be the only word he wants to say, and Steve bents forward from his chair so their foreheads are resting together, and listens patiently as Tony says his name over and over with apparent delight.
“The Bartons are probably at fault,” said Captain Rogers, coolly; “But I dare say he probably would not come even if the door was open to him.”
The party was rather large; and already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and while politics and Mr. Hammer were talked on, Antonia could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbor. The first remote sound she felt obliged to attend, was the name of Natasha Romanov. Mrs. Cage was telling that she had been calling on Miss Hill, and as soon as she entered the room had she been struck by the sight of a pianoforte – not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte. The end of all the dialogue which ensued was of surprise, and explanations from Miss Hill. The piano had arrived from Ireland, to the great astonishment of both Miss Hill and Miss Romanov. Utterly expected – and of course – by now – they were satisfied that it could only be from one quarter. A Mr. Murdock.
“What have you done?” He breathes, voice dropping when he sees the bandage encompassing Steve’s upper arm, “
He’s jolted back to the present when a far off sound makes him rip his mouth away, both of them heavy breathing and smiling against each other. He’s suddenly overwhelmingly aware that they are stood in the eaves of a house with enough eyes and spies for Howard it would make the White House jealous. “Not.” Tony says, “Not here. Do you have some place we can go? I won’t be missed”
She looked back to Miss Potts, oh gorgeous Pepper. A stunning figure she struck, alone in her cream lace dress, the white bow Antonia had helped tie affixed in her hair. Her eyes were not as bright now, and tears trembled in the orbs as she stared down to her feet. If Antonia was not engaged already in dancing it would be all she could do but rush towards her and comfort her. A dance was a social occasion, and the fact Miss Potts had not been asked for a dance once, even by a married man, would be the talk of the ton on the morrow. Oh the horror of Mr. Hammer’s rebuke!
It feels like the first time Steve got tinnitus. They’d been ambushed, off a chokepoint in the providence of Kandahar. Steve had always had good hearing, and it had probably saved his life, the fraction of time he’d heard the high pitched screech of mortar shells giving him a head start to scream “Down!” and pull him and Bucky to the desert floor. They’d been blown back with the force of it, an odd ringing piercing Steve’s ears, looking up and terrified that he couldn’t make out what Bucky was screaming.
” Sam leers, eyebrows wriggling across his face in a gesture Steve assumes is supposed to be lewd but ends up looking like two caterpillars trying to fight across his forehead.
Yet when so many were devoting him to Antonia, Captain. Rogers began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Natasha Romanov. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of common intelligence between them, symptoms of admiration on his side, that he could not believe were entirely void of meaning. Antonia was not present when his suspicions were peaked. Dining at the Hammers with the Randalls family, and Natasha, when he spotted a look, no, dozens of looks, at Miss Romanov. From the admirer of Miss Stark, it seemed out of place. And once spotted it was all he could do to notice them like moths to a flame at every common connection.
“I don’t know what I did to deserve you.” Steve says, low and brutal. It’s the first time they’ve been alone for a while, Bucky over at Sam’s, having told them he’d be “
. He feels Tony’s hands card through his hair, feels the rise of his chest, and leans forward to lick, ripping a groan from Tony’s chest.
“I do not find you disagreeable Antonia, I just find you naïve.” Says Steven, with a degree of vexation, that makes Antonia bound toward any other subject immediately, unable to comprehend why her words made him so angry.
This time, the story is different. Tony wakes, smiling, to Steve bent low over the hospital bed, murmuring words that sound like prayer. Steve watches Tony’s eyes open and grasps his hand even harder.
It’s cold and crisp, the fresh air burns Tony’s lungs and makes his eyes water. He’s not sure how long he walks until he comes to the front gate of his fathers property. He stares up at the wrought-iron gates that mock him with their height and immovability, and he ferociously wishes he could fly, could soar above until Howard was nothing but a speck on his vision.
nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”
So Steve agreed, because how could he not agree when the terms were that much in his favour? He could take on Stark Tower as a solo project and the team were unlikely to blink an eye - assuming it’s an excuse to spend more time with Tony. Which, at this point, is probably true.
The penthouse suite is opulent, but for a man used to decadence at every turn it didn’t do much to soothe his frazzled nerves. The fight hadn’t been difficult, Von Doom more focused on monologuing than the upper hand, but the collateral damage had been personal. He’s glad the debris had been isolated to the top two floors, but his family and his home being threatened had him still flooded with adrenaline. And the altercation downstairs hadn’t done much to fix it.
Steve walks them both back to his room, and Tony giggles against his mouth as Steve lifts him into one hand and gropes for the door handle with the other.
“She is an elegant young woman.” Said Antonia in agreement, unsure of why the air around them felt suddenly charged.
“Natasha is so very accomplished, there is nothing she cannot do. Do you know only last week she played the pianoforte to a room of the Colonel’s most esteemed guests, and they were all so very impressed. Have I told you her skill at the pianoforte Mrs Stark?”
“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him? It’s just that lately, I have imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment – secret looks and expressions, which I did not believe meant to be public.”
Steve allows it, too rushed and lust-fuelled to think anything of it. He doesn’t need the light to embed himself in Tony so deep they are both shaking well before they reach their release.
“Why must you think I am the one to blame,” – said she, “I am your daughter and surely your confidence should side with me!”
“Antonia likes to feel the cleverest in the room, Maria, you know this. She is without a doubt one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, with a mind razor sharp and tone to match. However she will never submit to anything requiring industry and patience. And whilst Virginia is clever, she is Antonia’s inferior and as such will rely on everything Antonia ever says, thinks or does. A flatterer – that is what Virginia poses as a friend, and as such is dangerous to Antonia’s already inflated notion of herself.”
Tony’s raised a fist before he can stop, feels Steve behind him at his shoulder. He pauses, lets his hand hang there. “You think I need you?” He laughs, the sound acidic, “I don’t need you. I will be bigger than you ever were, better than you ever could be. You haven’t created anything of any worth since I was eight years old, and it kills you that your success is off my back.”
Antonia had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Pepper’s going with her, that the worst of the business may be gone through as soon as possible.
It’s all sped up to a blur, and he hurries through checking Tony is still open and fluttering ready for him, lust crawling along his spine as he watches Tony’s hole wink at him. He sheaths himself in a condom, before running a slick fist down his cock once, twice, watching Tony’s eyes eat him up, before it’s nearly too much and he staves off any further feeling with a groan and leans forward on one hand.
. Antonia stresses the name hoping it will lead to Pepper using forenames as well, “How was your stay in the country? I do hope it was pleasant.”
"Excuse me," a rich baritone rumbles from above Steve's head, where he's still sat staring at the iPhone in a complete daze. Steve looks up and Tony Stark is stood with an amused smile infusing his face, "But I can't help but notice that that is my face on your screen. You'd only have to ask and I can take a photo with you, I'm not shy."
“Okay, okay, okay, okay” Tony babbles, “I need that thing in me yesterday.” He twists underneath Steve and reaches up toward the cabinet by the yawning expanse of his bed. When Steve realises what he’s searching for, he stretches beyond the other man and blindly grabs at the drawer handle. It takes Tony reaching up to suck at Steve’s left nipple to spark a delicious spark of desire course through him and distantly he heard the cacophony of wood scraping. He’s pulled the drawer out completely, the contents spilling to the floor. Tony giggles against his chest, the vibration twisting Steve’s gut something fierce.
“Well for once we are in agreement that those within the circle she resided in before meeting me were not good enough for her!” Antonia retorts weakly. To be on the receiving end of Steven’s disappointment was a heavy burden indeed, and one she was not accustomed to.
“Because dear heart,” Maria says softly, “Steven normally stares at you like you hung up the stars, and today he can only look anywhere
Mrs. Stark was made of more intelligence than her daughter gave her credit for, but she knew not to push, knew her daughter willful but delicate.
Antonia couldn’t understand what feeling was fluttering in her breast, it was not quite excitement, almost nerves, for the heated gazes of Mr. and Mrs. Marvel on her, expectant and overwhelming. She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. She was a little occupied in weighing up her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation.
The Miss Stark was puzzled, unable to understand whether his compliments were to be considered marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. In any certainty she could not deny her vanity was flattered disproportionately, almost flushing as she saw her mother’s eyebrows raise across the channel of the room.
“I do not say it is so; but you do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behavior accordingly. I think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Antonia. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.
It’s short work to drop his name enough to count, to get Steve the best medical attention. He wraps Dakar Hospital in the oppressive fog that is Stark Industries, has Steve whisked onto a plane kitted out better than Air Force One, headed straight to the US the moment they are clear to do so, flies tens of specialists out to meet them on the landing strip. He knows the bill he’s wracking up will be counted in nails hammered into his back as he’s strung up like a sacrifice by his own father.
“If Mrs. May wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great pleasure. Though my dancing days are beginning to come to an end as an old married man, it would do me great pleasure to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. May.”
“Oh my god – oh my god.” Tony whispers, barely loud enough for Steve to hear. So Steve grins down at him, aware of the sweat pooling in the crook of his brow, and picks the pace to one practically unbearable in its sensation. The room fills with the lewd and filthy sound of bare skin slapping in an unmistakable cacophony, Tony punctuating it with little punched out moans that bring a flush to Steve’s cheeks.
Antonia was clever, and she thought nothing of his attachment, merely insulted by his hopes. He merely wanted to marry well, and had the arrogance to raise his eyes to her and pretend to be in love. She knew there was nothing in his disappointment – no real affection either in his language or manners. She was not to trouble herself to pity him – he only wanted to enrich himself; and if Miss Stark of Hartfield, an heiress of thousands and the sprawling land of Highbury, was not as easily obtained as he hoped, he would try for another.
Sam scoffs, “Not nothing, Steve. The fact the guy you are seeing doesn’t want to be seen with you in public is not
But it’s not the fact he was just completely floored by an extra-terrestrial beast that has him pausing whilst the battle continues around him, but the fact that in that last moment Steve didn’t want to die and that is such an alien thought to the man who had nothing left to lose because all his friends are dead and gone he’s not sure whether to laugh or cry. He instead grabs Tony’s metal arm and pulls him close and grins right up into his face.
, was an actual goose and accidentally shot one dead. That had chicks. Which he then raised.” Steve’s voice is monotone, but a smile trembles on his lips, “he just needed a little guidance, at first. He left the field as one of the best Special Recovery agents I’ve ever seen.”
“Oh blegh stop that’s enough.” Clint protests, “I’m Clint by the way. Head of Technical Identity Security. But also this here Abercrombie model’s best friend.” Clint says, moving over toward Steve and throwing an arm round him.
“What would Clint do without her?” Antonia speculated, wondering how Clint might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment the possible good. Now, an attachment to Pepper Potts would have nothing to encounter. No hazard or road block to the contrary. All that remained to be wished was, that Mr Barton should form an attachment, but Antonia could feel no certainty of its being formed.
“My worries about the match were for him, I thought he could do no worse. But he was so in love with her – he IS so in love with her, he would not be reasoned with! For Christ’s – I even thought of you! I even though ‘Antonia will think this a good match’”
of misery! Is that what we were? Fool me, here was I thinking we welcomed him back to Highbury with openness and friendship!”
She can feel Steve’s gaze on her the entire evening, noting how it makes the back of her neck feel alight.
“Pray Antonia,” said he, instead, “may I ask what the great amusement, the sting of the last word given to you and Miss Romanov, and am curious to know how it could be so entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other.”
“No.” Tony is quick to reply, coughs and recalibrates before continuing, “sorry, no. No it’s not an issue. I - I can’t believe you’re real.” The last words are barely above a whisper, and
refuse –“ Antonia stopped, rudderless, “Oh! So, you weren’t just asking for help regarding the phrasing. You actually want to accept a proposal from
“Captain. Rogers?” Antonia spluttered, heart seized, “Do something like that in secret? It is not like him to move in the shadows. And surely he would have told me.”
Steve pauses and Antonia can almost see the cogs turning, “And how do you surmise that? Success implies endeavor, Antonia. Just because you say 'I think it would be a fine thing if Miss Ross and Mr Banner were to marry' and then repeating it to yourself every so often, it's not the same as bringing it about." Steve chides gently, “If…
Tony stops his hands, quick and fast, and Steve freezes, hoping to god he hasn’t read this all wrong.
thought of you as a suitor for my friend. I am sorry you are mistaken, but I never gave you any sort of encouragement. I have no thoughts of matrimony at the present.”
“Now… who next.” She mutters, mostly to herself, far too delighted with herself to note a worried look from her companion.
“How was my old friend?” Mrs Stark asks, “Antonia was up and about very early this morning to visit Miss. Hill.” She explains to Steven.
“Pray take care, Miss Stark, there is a step at the turning. Pray take care, it is a rather dark staircase – rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Stark, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot.”
It was such a fate she found himself in one Friday afternoon before she noticed a broad figure cutting a swathe across the garden toward Hartfield.
“My complexion only remains this way due to our nature’s wonderful fresh air, and I would be silly not to entreat it on such a gorgeous day as this. I hope you don’t mind me leaving you with just Antonia for company, Steven.”
the only thing holding bone in place, until the ambulance arrives. He instead just presses his forehead to Tony’s own, and clutches Tony’s head in his hands with a grip so hard it’s like he’s willing the serum to pass through by osmosis and he knows in that moment he’d sacrifice everything, go back to being that nothing special skinny kid from Brooklyn, if it meant he could see Tony’s dark brown eyes looking back at him.
). Disappointed in a very social climb of hope; and not only losing the lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a wrong one. It was only Antonia’s deep seated need to not embarrass her mother and Steven both that his sins had not been made public. It made for him returning engaged to another so utterly bizarre and rankling – not least that he returned self-satisfied caring nothing for Miss Stark, and defying Miss Potts.
“I see how it is.” Said she, “I see what a life I am to lead among you. Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem to quite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing formidable! Thank goodness I have all my resources at my disposal.”
"If anyone looks like a prostitute in this relationship, I would like to think it would be me." Tony is petulant now and Steve gently pats his shoulder.
“Miss Hill.” She starts, sincerity pouring out from the source. “You have friends in Highbury. Myself, my father, Captain Rogers. We are all at your disposal. We are all anxious that you do not worry about Miss Romanov’s future.”
Steve wakes, for the first time in a while, with a dying scream on his lips and sweat beading across his forehead. He chokes out a, “Bucky –
He’s not sure what sorcery has been at work in the past twenty four hours, but it’s like his guardian angel has suddenly remembered he exists, sending him endless good things to make up for the utter shittiness that was his childhood and adolescence. When he wakes, he’s alone, curled up in the imprint of Steve’s body in the bed, still warm from his skin. He can hear faint sounds of life, of opened drawers and stacking plates, and there’s a wafting smell of bacon grease that has Tony salivating. He hadn’t ended up eating anything at Thanksgiving after all.
This only serves for Liam to double down on his idiocy and say quietly, "It's a New York January." Referring to the bitter chill outside. And really, Tony wasn't a complete idiot. He was aware it was bitterly brisk outside, that's why he'd ushered Steve in so quickly to the foyer in the first place, trying to shake the distraction of Steve's nipples pebbled against the silk of his shirt.
The chatter in the room continues, enough for Mr. Marvel to lower his voice beside her, “We hope there will not be another put-off. Between us, I hope he will have no reason to stay away, His grandmother is – she is an odd woman! – But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on Clint’s account, as I believe her very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of anybody, except herself; but she has always been kind to him, if not to me. And it is compliment to himself that he should excite such affection in her, as she has no more heart than a stone to people in general.” His eyes grow dark, “And a devil of a temper.”
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Antonia, from a note from Mrs Marvel, instantly, telling her he was likely at Hartfield very soon. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone within a few hours, though without any alarm, for his grandmother, to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but for her own convenience.
“Jarvis, don’t you agree?” Antonia was full steam into a fully fleshed argument, colour flush on her cheeks. “That of course Steven is not the secret admirer of Miss Romanov, and certainly did not gift her a pianoforte without anyone’s knowledge!”
“A man can always, if he chooses, do his duty; not by maneuvering or finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Clint Barton’s duty to pay this attention to his father. He knows as much by his promises and his messages; but if he wished to do it it might be done. A man who felt rightly would sat at once, simply but firmly, to Mrs. Barton – ‘every sacrifice you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately as a mark of respect to not fail him on this occasion’ – if he were to say to her with kindness but certainty, there would be no entreaty.”
“Tony,” Steve says, “Tony, Tony.” And Tony’s name, that has so often felt like a curse, sounds like music from Steve’s lips, only stopping to capture Tony’s mouth in his. Steve kisses like he’s drowning, like he’ll die from it but he can’t stop to care. Tony kisses like he’s making a vow, like he promises this is all he’ll need forever is Steve’s lips on his and his lover underneath him. They meet in the middle in a cacophony of desperation and want and their soulmarks cry
“You alright there Steve?” Nat calls from across the fog, searing through the haze that’s cluttered Steve’s vision.
“I have been too busy to think about appearances Steven.” She waved him off, “I have far too much to do to concern myself with how I look.”
Just a man and as flawed as the rest of them. Steve’s heart tightens and he doesn’t want to examine too closely why, not yet.
“My dearest Pepper,” Antonia’s voice is slow, trying to understand the situation that has begun, “what do you mean – mistake you? Am I to suppose then - ?”
He falls forward and they lay there a moment in utter silence, both unable to process the ecstasy of what they’ve just shared. Steve slides out of Tony, who whimpers in his absence, and Steve summons the energy to get up and dispose of the condom before flopping back to the bed, energy spent.
Intimate evening party dinners were what she preferred, steering the conversation in a manner perfectly suited to her role as hostess. And she could also completely destroy her dinner mates in a game of cards so gracefully you could not complain.
“I love you.” He whispers, breath hot in Tony’s ear, and Tony wants to scream at the unfairness of it all.
that greets him every time he does. It could be his wishful imagination, but he likes to think different. He wraps a scarf round once, twice, and finishes the look with a MIT beanie. It’s a particular brand of “hobo chic”, as Bruce likes to say, that suits Tony like a second skin. He’ll have to take it all off when he reaches the labs, because even he isn’t stupid enough to risk the wrath of his supervisors if he causes another fire this month on the premises. But he’ll hang Steve’s jumper up as close to him as he dares, make enough excuses to walk near and let the scent of Steve ground him in its wake.
He looks round at his room, his eyes scanning a quick check. He doesn’t know why he bothers, it’s still as much of a mess as it was yesterday. The shock of blue carpet flooring can only be sighted in and amongst clothes and papers that litter the floor. His bed has taken on the form of a nest, covers undisturbed from where he snatched a few hours of sleep last night, blankets curled round him like a cloak. He doesn’t need to check his room, but it gives him the chance and routine to stroke his fingers across the photo of him and Steve that sits on the windowsill, the only item that’s regularly dusted. It’s of them, a quick photo that Peter had snapped at Boston Common, and the resolution of his phone camera doesn’t particularly stand up to being blown up to a print. The quality is a little fuzzy, but sharp enough to show off Steve’s cheekbones, and that’s enough for Tony. Tony’s in Steve’s space, standing in the eaves of Steve’s large shoulders with an obscenely wide smile, mouth open like he’s in the middle of a joke. Steve’s curled into Tony’s gravity field, eyes on Tony and nothing else. It’s not a particularly special memory or special moment, but it’s one Tony adores, one Tony had begged Peter to send him.
Antonia’s answer was not. Unable to resist, “Ah, ma’am. There may be a difficulty, you will be limited as to number – only three at once.”
“Natasha’s writing is always so very handsome. I do say she writes the most handsome letters I have ever read. Wouldn’t you say it is handsome? She’s so kind, taking the time out of her busy life to write to me.”
“So, Anthony.” Howard begins, always slurring, always harsh. Maria is sat close enough to Tony he can see how hard she is holding onto her cutlery, knuckles white. He feels foreboding seep into his skin, thinks about how he left Steve, sleepy and smiling, finally well and rested chatting up a storm to his mother in the kitchens, for this. He looks at Obie, now, from across the table. He’s sweating, but his smile is smug. He feels dread creep into his stomach, feels Steve stirring at the sadness Tony must be feeding back to him. “I hear you’ve been hiding something from me. Or better -
“My idea of him is that he has the power of being universally agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming or ligature; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to everybody, having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to put everyone around him at ease.”
Clint Barton returned to his station beside Antonia; and as soon as Miss Hill was quiet after her usual language spill upon the company of Captain Rogers, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Hammer and Miss Romanov, who were standing a little way behind her. Clint was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Natasha on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Hammer was evidently wanting to be complimented herself. It was ‘How do you like my gown?’ – How do you like my trimming? – How is my hair? – with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness that Antonia commended Miss Romanov on. Antonia thought she might of screamed by now. “Compliment to Captain. Rogers, certainly hosting this ball chiefly to do me honour – I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.
“What do you think of this space, for a ball, Miss Hill!” Clint Barton exclaimed as they set themselves in the room.
The AI sounded amused, if that was even possible? He’d have to ask Tony. “Don’t you worry Jarvis, I’ll get him out of there.”
“Didn’t appreciate the intrusion, but I’ll let you keep thinking that’s the first time. Your chair at the office is the swivel one, right?” Tony replies, slick and fast, and Bucky cries outrage as the insult strikes true. Steve’s not sure how he knew what Bucky’s chair looked like, but he’s going to put it down to guesswork of a genius.
when the man comes downstairs looking like every military fantasy Tony has ever had rolled into one. He can’t possibly be real. He can’t possibly be the man that Tony gets to come home to every night.
is given as answer to Tony’s questioning eyes. Tony’s eyes flicker like crazy, and Steve tracks the swallow and bob of his adam’s apple with a mild panic.
“Ah the uncertainty of when I may be able to return! It will be the object of all my thoughts and desires.” His eyes were sad, voice low and dark.
It’s safe to say that consequently Steve doesn’t probably make the best impression in the meeting that follows. Hell, he’ll be impressed if he made any impression at all other than “wow this man is extremely sweaty”. He gathers himself enough after several excruciating minutes to piece together some observations he and his team have made in the first day or so of working over the security and the suggestions he makes are ones he’s fairly proud of. Nat swung it out of the park for them, and it shows by how Stark quietly sits there brooding, clearly unhappy that they are actually quite competent.
Steve wants to cry. Even now, Tony is wonderful, apologizing for Steve’s rude behavior. He stands slow, like he’s wading through treacle, and Tony stands with him. They sway slightly into each other’s space, hands brushing, and it feels like gravity giving Steve the extra nudge, the push into Tony’s magnetic field.
However, it cannot be overstated that his friends are anything but normal. Between them they sport a few attractive lifetime achievements not limited to; being banned from ever stepping a foot into any iHOP across the US, having their picture taken and subsequently pinned up under the “not allowed skates under any circumstances” rule at the roller rink round the corner from their Brooklyn office, and Clint had the supremely prestigious honour of being barred from Twitter for six months after getting into a war of 160 characters or less with Donald Trump.
It was well to have a comfort in store on Virginia’s behalf. As Clint Barton’s arrival had succeeded Mr. Hammer’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, now Clint Barton had disappeared, no sooner did Mr. Hammer reappear in everyone’s minds and mouths, much to Antonia’s dismay. With it brought the wedding day named, and Clint Barton was forgotten. She yet again idly wondered whether the ease in which he left her mind suggested her fanciful notion of being in love was wrong, but she left that in her head for another time to examine. Antonia grew sick of the sound of Mr Hammer’s happy day, particularly because it seemed to drive a knife into Pepper’s heart with every utterance.
Tony startled when a thumb brushed over his nipple, shivers starting a delicate tremble in his muscles as Steve hummed quietly in question. “I’m alright,” Tony said on a sigh, “just thinking.”
Tony had every intention of sitting and enjoying all the emotions flying around, but his eyes loved to wander. He listened vaguely to Clint’s personal vows to Bucky as eyes landed on an incredibly familiar blond, standing right next to Bucky. He looked absolutely edible in a suit, with the navy blue jacket making his already broad shoulders look massive. However, he had a decidedly unsexy deer-in-the-headlights expression on his face. Tony wasn’t so sure that his face looked any different.
”). By Tony’s best estimation that meant that attempting the same with his dick might not be the most excellent plan.
“Honey,” Steve began, looking askance up at Tony. The kicked puppy look was kind of ruined when he was laid out ass-naked on Tony’s bed, but he appreciated the visual all the same.
Tony shuffled his way to the steps, stepping into the lukewarm water with a sigh. He had been skeptical about this destination wedding business - not that he couldn’t afford it - but even he could leave some of that behind in the face of a sunny day spent lounging on the poolside with a drink in his hand.
Steve paused, looking puzzled, then morose. “Ah,” He began, and Tony knew he needed to stop him right there before this got more out of hand.
“Come here often?” Steve asked hopefully, shaking the glass as if Tony had somehow missed it. Tony snorted a little, what a dork. He was lucky he was cute.
He did a double take about halfway through, feeling his interest pique when he saw a massive blonde with a tiny, colorful drink in front of him. He indulged himself in looking his fill for a while, pausing only to tip the bartender when he returned with his drinks.
Clint shot him the dirtiest look as he slid into his seat, panting slightly but not entirely late. Tony did his best to relay his remorse and an “I’ll tell you about it later” all in one glance. It must have worked to some degree because Clint just raised an eyebrow, turning to Bucky and the minister with a doofy grin pasted on his face.
It wasn’t loud. In fact, Tony was fairly sure he was the only one who heard it, but when he heard those three words he swore his heart skipped a beat. A shiver passed through his body, starting at the top of his head and going through his toes. By the wondrous look on Steve’s handsome face he felt it too.
Now, Tony really didn’t care all that much about the man’s friends, or the other marriage that was apparently happening at the resort that week. What Tony really cared about, at that point, was what the fine gentleman’s name was, and if he was willing to follow Tony into the cramped pool bathroom to play a little beat the clock with him.
Tony turned onto his side, giving his best attempt at a coy glance over his shoulder. Steve’s eyes followed the move, darkening appreciatively. His hand followed not far behind, a warm, dry counterpoint to the sudden slick pressure between his thighs. There was a dicey second where the phantom pressure of Steve’s hand brushed the underside of his cock when it strayed a bit too close, but it passed quickly in lieu of Steve’s hand being replaced with his dick.
“And I-” he took a breath, wanting this to come out right, for once, “I don’t want to set a precedent for myself, for, you know,” Steve quirked an eyebrow, looking patiently confused. Ok, so he didn’t know. “I don’t want to start having sex with strangers, at all.”
Despite the drawn out tease of their earlier experiments, Steve was by no means rushing himself. Tony could feel the slick glide of his cock between his clenched thighs, and any attempt at fucking himself backwards into Steve was met with Steve’s hands tightening warningly on his hips. His hands were made of silken steel, and though he was deceptively gentle memories of his hips creaking under those broad palms filled Tony’s mind as he snuck a hand down to palm at his cock. He heard Steve let out a rumbly sigh of pleasure, hooking his chin over Tony’s shoulder to watch while the steady thrust of his hips continued.
Tony forwent a goodbye, leaving Steve with only a stern “Stop looking like you just got laid,” before moseying his way down the hallways towards his room. The deep baritone laugh that followed him kept him warm until he crawled into bed, feeling satisfied in the most bone-deep way.
Tony looked up at Steve from under his lashes, coyly grinning when Steve gave a helpless little moan in reply. He licked his lips again, just for show, then opened his mouth over Steve’s cockhead, giving the tip a filthy kiss.
“So, are you enjoying your vacation?” Oh fuck. Yeah, Tony could listen to this guy talk all day long for the rest of his life and probably never get tired of the sound. His voice was deep, deep enough where Tony could almost feel it in his own chest, but butter smooth. Tony took a sip of his drink to compose himself, focusing on looking at least a little cool.
They separated in fits and starts, with several attempts at straightening out their hair ruined when Tony pulled Steve into another kiss, or Steve took a fistful of hair to leave open-mouthed kisses on Tony’s neck. Eventually they got themselves together, but were definitely fooling no-one with the loose grins plastered on their faces.
Tony gasped out a moan and ripped his head away, panting for breath as he ground down helplessly. Steve let out a low groan, pressing lips and teeth to Tony’s neck in a move that made his knees weaken just slightly. Steve must have felt it because he hefted Tony up just a little, bracing his feet and suspending him in an effortless move that turned Tony’s knees to jelly.
“Steve?” Tony asked, bringing a hand up to investigate what could be wrong. Everything seemed fine - he could run his hand up and down the thick corded muscles of his neck, and up to cup his jaw. Steve gritted his teeth, then sat back, squinting down at Tony like kissing him was a mildly challenging sort of puzzle.
Steve flung his arm over his eyes, groaning in frustration. Tony wiped his lube-slick fingers on his thigh with a grimace, feeling his cock twitch at the wanton image Steve made.
“Close-” He choked out, jerking a little when all Steve did was pick up the pace. Before Tony knew it he was cumming into Steve’s hand, gasping out his name and a tangled string of explicatives.
after a playful argument, but the whole phrase - was the day they got married, right after Tony stepped up to share a disappointingly chaste kiss with his new husband.
Tony figured that’d be the end of it - he had enjoyed some harmless flirting but wasn’t expecting much else. He was shocked silent when after a few moments he felt a presence at his shoulder, and craned his neck up (and up, and up) to see the blond beefcake standing there, his fine hair wreathed in a halo of bright summer sunlight. He had that same dorky grin on his face, and Tony would have said it wasn’t suited for his face if it hadn’t been so damn charming.
“D-Don’t leave any marks,” Tony gasped out, gasping a hoarse moan when Steve gave an inquisitive noise against his neck. “I’ve gotta wear a suit tomorrow, or I’d absolutely let you go wild.”
“What I was going to suggest,” He said, nosing into the hair behind Tony’s ear, “Is that I slick you up right here-” A hot hand trailed down between his thighs, caressing with far more intent than he had at the reception. “And I don’t stop until we’re both satisfied.”
Now there was an idea, he mused, taking a sip of his drink with a satisfied hum. He hadn’t been in a relationship for years, and hadn’t really fooled around for even longer. Sure, sometimes he was tempted when a pretty face crossed his eye, but he’d learned pretty early on that pleasure and business didn’t mix well, and the payoff was never worth the fallout.
He felt heat rising to his cheeks as he thought about Steve’s huge hands in his hair, muttering praise that Tony couldn’t even fucking remember but fuck had it been hot.
At this Clint grinned, taking a sip of his drink before replying, “How could I be? I’m marrying the best guy in the world, I’m chilling at a pool in Mexico, and I’ve had a couple shots of tequila. There’s literally nothing that could faze me right now.” He lifted his empty shot glass as if to prove his point, grinning when a staff member grabbed it on their way by.
Ok, maybe he was a bit twitchy for some other reasons as well. In his defence, they had been at this for a while and it was beginning to look like mutual masturbation was going to be the wedding night shenanigans of choice. Kissing was a no-go, meaning that despite their most enthusiastic efforts they could rule out oral (“
He picked his head up enough to check the time on his phone, feeling his stomach sink when he saw the time. He had 20 minutes to make it to the ceremony, 25 if they got it started a little late.
Tony heard Steve groan again and looked up, feeling everything in him melt at the heated look Steve was giving him. He let out a little moan of his own, delighting in the slick slide of Steve’s cock when he gave a tiny thrust from the vibrations.
Tony felt a shiver run down his spine, his head rolling back on the pillows with a hoarse moan. He nodded furiously, spreading his legs just a little more and earning himself another rich, vibrating laugh and a hot puff of air at his neck. There was a waft of cold air as Steve reached for the lube on the bedside table, the faint smell of artificial cherries filling the air. His dick twitched with what was practically a pavlovian response to the scent.
It’s not like anyone noticed, with Steve ugly-crying right there in Tony’s arms. Tony didn’t mind one bit, even if it did make his handsome husband look like a tomato.
Steve visibly dissected that statement for a moment, looking disheartened, then maybe a bit hopeful. Tony was feeling hopeful too - if Steve could understand his shitty attempt at a discussion of relationships and emotions this relationship was already light years ahead of the last couple long-term partners he had.
“Kiss me.” He said, apparently deciding that they were going to play that sort of game that evening. Tony gave an internal shrug, using the hand on Steve’s jaw to lever himself up for a kiss. He had expected something a little more vanilla on their wedding night, at least from Steve, but he was no stranger to a little power play.
Tony woke up gradually, only really being awake when he fully opened his eyes. He had a vague, warm awareness of his limbs, but everything seemed so very unimportant when put against the fact that he was probably the most comfortable he had been in a while.
But that was the past. This was the present, and he was on vacation. He didn’t have to close a business deal with him the next afternoon. The most he had to do tomorrow was get dressed and clap politely.
. Tony ground his head into the pillows with a hoarse moan, hearing Steve’s breathy laugh as his hands landed on his hips.
The man chuckled at his admittedly dry attempt at a reply, looking down at Tony with a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. “It’s the same for me, actually. My best friend is getting married, but all I was told to do is show up.” He rubbed the back of his neck, looking nothing if not painfully endearing. “I feel like I should be doing more, but they’ve seem to got it all covered.”
Tony felt his mouth water as he started squirming a bit, both silently asking to be let down and desperately trying to feel more of his hot length against him. Steve grunted, but got the hint and set him down. He let out a murmur of dazed surprise when Tony slid straight to his knees, sliding the waistband of his trunks down as gently as he could. His cock sprung free, fully erect and curved slightly to the left. Tony followed the line of it with his eyes, licking his lips in bare anticipation.
“Look at it! Isn’t it beautiful?” Steve shouts, grin so wide it nearly splits his face and he whoops with the sheer
“Oh yes, ever since Natasha left the vicarage to live with Captain Coulson. Like her parents, Miss Coulson is kindness itself, she is elegant and gracious. Even if she is not as … handsome as Natasha.”
“Why should that bother you,” Steven replies, broad back still facing away from her, “You would never dream of accepting an invitation from the Cages.”
“Did you miss my tongue in your mouth?” Steve says, as way of answer, learning quick that Tony speaks fast and uses humour to dress up words and deflect. Black humor makes a good bedfellow, Steve should know.
