At the mention of Moriarty, John froze. He slowly lowered his hand from the air and he fell backwards into his chair.
Sherlock’s arm fell to his side. Another sob escaped his lips. He climbed over the armrest into Johns chair and curled up on his side, his arms clasped around his knees and his head lolled into the chair back.
John shrugged the hand off. He hated when Sherlock did things like that. There was no part of Sherlock that would ever naturally try to comfort someone. It just wasn’t who Sherlock was. What he was doing instead was imitating, giving John something he thought he needed, that he thought would make him respond in the way that would be least inconvenient to himself. He was doing something he thought normal people did.
“Well, you asked,” Molly grumbled meekly.
The only times he was willing to let John out of his sight was when John had to go to work at the surgery or to go out for drink with Mike or Lestrade.
No, it had to be Moriarty. If someone wanted a victim not to be identified, you could hide the body. If you wanted to disfigure it you could use acid or burn it. But this, this was mocking Sherlock.
“And I assume you’d already tracked him using CCTV?” Sherlock looked at Mycroft.
"What do you mean, now that Moriarty is gone? I just saw him."
"Oh for fucks sake, you're the "mysterious figure," aren't you?"
than Christmas. He could have never imagined how wonderful it could be to be having regular sex with someone. Or hell, even just to be cuddled next to someone on the sofa while bickering about the idiocrasy of reality television or to be dragged into an alley way for a snog after a day running about in London. It didn’t get in the way. It made his mind sharper. It made him more eager. It made his body pulse with a new found energy.
“You have the most to risk,” Mary replied calmly. She paused for a moment, seeming conflicted over how to explain herself. “If things fall apart, if we get caught in the field, arrested for murder or assault or anything else for that matter, and our man can’t get us off without compromising our work, which is likely, it hardly matters for either of us. But if that happened to you, Moriarty would know you’re alive. Sherlock would know you’re alive. What you had been doing would be unearthed and all the work that we’ve done will likely become meaningless with a few simple recalculations on Moriarty’s part. This only works if Moriarty doesn’t realize his web has been disassembled until he makes his big move and realizes at the last minute that there is no one left to help him. If he finds out before that moment though, then I imagine he’ll be able to make all our work meaningless with a few phone calls.”
John cringed. That was the part he’d refused to think about, wanting to block it out. He was a doctor, had been a doctor, but either way he was supposed to save people whenever he could. He could not hold a knife to another person’s body again without vomiting, but still that saving people instinct was there. But sometimes, things had happened. It was only ever in self-defense, when things had gone horribly wrong. He was hardly an assassin or executioner, but still it had been--
And in that moment the grief overcame him. It was all too much. John was gone. Forever.
"Your brother, you over-analyzing fool," Victor said.
He put on his shoes and grabbed his coat and made his way down the stairs. He opened the door and slammed it shut behind him, not even caring if he woke Ms. Hudson.
"I think it's time you go home Sherlock. Get some rest. Heaven's knows the last time you slept. I'll let you know when we've made progress. John is going to need some time to recover."
He wanted to so, so badly. For so long he had wanted this. But not now, dammit. It was too late now. But being so close to Sherlock felt so wonderful, and he didn’t want it to end. They’d already gone so much farther than John should have allowed anyway, what would it matter if they took it a bit further? Just this once. Just to know what it was like, so he wouldn’t wonder forever. It was all going to fall apart so spectacularly soon, maybe he could just have this one good thing. Everything else had gone so bad, he just needed this one good thing.
“You’re just so fun to play with though, aren’t you Johnny? And quite likeable. I’d be a fool to claim I didn’t understand what everyone else sees in you. You’re adorable, aren't you? Sherlock’s adorable little pet blogger, was it? But you’re my pet now, aren’t you? I do love my pets. I like to take care of them, make them feel special, don’t I? Though I certainly don’t go as far as… bestiality,” Moriarty chuckled, again seeming to contradict his statement by grinding himself against John again. “Don’t I Sebby?” John heard a grunt from across the room, confirming Moran’s presence. “Moran's a bit different than you though. I've never played with him like this, wouldn't be any fun," he smirked at John before quickly lightening his tone. "Sebby, could you pull that table over there to us? I’ve just gotten comfortable and I’d hate to move.”
But Sherlock, rather annoyingly for the self-proclaimed master deductionist, didn’t seem to understand John’s queue to change the tone, or was ignoring it. But the implications of that latter possibility were even more horrifying.
“Sebby's going to want a slightly larger canvas though to work with. I might as well help him along.” Moriarty cocked his head to the side and stuck out the tip of his tongue in concentration as he pulled Johns jumper away from his chest and ran the blade down the middle, splitting it open. He then reached up above John, cutting the sleeves, before giving a fierce tug that caused the jumper to fall on the floor.
“Yes, alright. Well, it’s at least some place to start. Even if they weren’t a part of it, they might know of someone who requested information or otherwise expressed interest,” Lestrade responded, now dialing his mobile, clearly beginning to take action.
At Mycroft’s words, Sherlock snapped out of it.
He closed his eyes.
They sat in silence on the way back up the river. It wasn’t until Sherlock could see the clock tower rising in the distance that Mycroft spoke.
“We’ve been unable to identify the victims, and the case is rather horrific, so we haven’t had much information to report, and no desire to cause an unnecessary panic, so we’ve avoid calling a press conference or releasing any of the more interesting bits in the press releases. And we do like to imagine that we aren’t completely incompetent down at The Yard, despite what you believe, Sherlock. But the way the bodies are mutilated, we don't know what to make of it without someone who has more, er, background in this kind of thing," Lestrade said.
“Thank fucking God, go have fun,” John muttered, barely looking up from his medical journal, but with a small smile, pleased at Sherlock’s change of mood.
It took everything John had left in him to get himself to move. He turned down and alley nearby and pressed his back against the wall, hoping that Sherlock and Victor would walk past. Soon enough he could hear their conversation again.
“How’d you get that set up? Is Myc doing well?”
“This isn’t about Moriarty, is it? This is about me.”
“Well, I don’t know, I just, I thought that there was something familiar about the way he stood,”
gotten together. He was a bit shy about it, said you weren’t going public yet. Is something wrong, is John alright?”
“Hold that thought,” Sherlock said and John was momentarily confused until Sherlock pushed against John, rolling them across the mattress so they lay parallel to the length of the bed, also leaving it so Sherlock was now on top.
“Could be in Thailand for all we honestly know. We can’t go boarding ships without any reason to just because you’ve come up with a theory.”
“Who was that?” Sherlock finally brought himself to whisper.
Up the stairs they went. At first in silence, but then John began to speak.
“What, like you don’t know. Or did he not tell you he told me? Or are you testing him and I shouldn't have told you he told me? He did seem really hesitant to. He’d seemed really off, you know, kind of skittish, his leg had been bothering him again. But when he told me, oh, I don’t even care that we didn’t work out when he looked so happy.”
John fell back onto the floor, his back arched off the ground and he groaned as the flames of agony flared over his back. The acid. Fuck.
So, Sherlock insisted that John be with him every time he went out, for every single case. He never suggested that they split up, unless he was leaving him with Lestrade, and even then he was hesitant. He had even started going with John to do the shopping, which seemed to deeply alarm John.
Victor rose to match him.
John was so much more than that. And Moriarty knew that.
“We’ve both been recast, haven’t we? Left to hide out backstage while the principle actors take the stage. To think we'd thought of him as nothing more than an understudy.”
“Oh, that. Of course you’re curious. I mean, that whole thing was a bit of a lie, I guess, though don’t tell your friends at the Yard that, yeah? A friend of mine, old co-worker, was calling in a favor. I’ve always been good at picking locks, something I learned from you actually. I was just supposed to look around, grab a file. Not something I usually get involved in. I’m glad it’s all been sorted out. I just didn’t want to have to compromise my friend. Could have been dangerous for him, you know. Really good guy, just a bit unlucky I guess.”
can fix it? I’ve been running around London threatening and assaulting mostly petty criminals into either turning themselves in or going into hiding. Half of them weren't even Moriarty's, and certainly not his caliber, just trying to make a point. None of them had the resources to check and see if I was anything but talk, which is all I am by the way. But arms dealers, foreign mafias, civilian militias, they’ll know that I’m an illusion. All bark and no bite.”
“Well, I imagine we should track down that medical journal of yours and interview all the doctors and researchers who took part, as they would be the experts in such a procedure.”
He was probably still in the old warehouse he had followed Victor and the woman to.
“What?” Lestrade asked, looking alarmed at the physical manifestation of Sherlock’s epiphany.
Finally, the blows stopped. One final kick and John was rolled over onto his back. John blinked up to see Moriarty standing over him, a foot on either side of his hips, holding was looked to be his mobile.
“What did the message say?” Lestrade asked softly.
"You think John might try to kill himself, now that he's done with his mission."
“Shit, Vic. You can’t pull someone half dead out of the river and expect them to be fine after being tortured. He needs an actual hospital.”
"He won't even agree to see me."
He’d realized he’d begun to lose some of Moriarty’s revelations in his panic and excitement? relief? he wasn’t sure. But he needed to keep listening to Moriarty, he needed to know what happened to John.
But somehow some unassuming hacker with a slightly rough background had managed to discharge his illegal firearm into said assassins head. Because that was definitely something that could happen coincidentally.
To say that Sherlock was frustrated would be underselling it. Not only did it turn out that Sherlock had gone through all the trouble of actually bothering to get a warrant for once only to discover that he was humiliatingly wrong, but also because Victor Trevor was lying but he couldn’t deduce the truth off him. In fact, he could hardly read the man at all.
“Don’t worry John, I know now that killing you won’t work and that I can’t leave it to someone else to take care of you. It would only make sense, since it was those hands that tore
“Oh, Victor, long time no see, isn’t it?” Moriarty said calmly. He was no longer looking down at John, but rather behind him, staring off into the distance at the people that John could not see for himself. There was silence in response.
"Oh, Sherlock, what are you, er, doing out so late?" he said awkwardly.
“No, he wasn’t killed here. But the operation could have easily occurred here. The building is in the middle of a remodel, so it’s still secure. But they’ve had trouble with payment, correct? So work has been temporarily halted, leaving the building vacant. It’s a perfectly reasonable place to operate on a dead man, and I’m sure there have been small traces of blood and skin tissue, in smaller amounts than a murder of course, around the bodies.”
"The situation is delicate. I assume you have trusted us on that, because if you didn't I have no doubt in my mind you would have already tracked down John on your own," he smiled fondly, which was inexplicable to Sherlock. "But he's doing well. He's already up and walking, albeit very stiffly and slowly. Give it a couple more days Sherlock."
Sherlock had returned to Baker Street and spent all afternoon and evening after leaving the crime scene yesterday trying to just get a moment of clarity to understand, but there seemed to be some sort of barrier he couldn’t get past. There was something he was missing, some connection that he hadn’t made. It didn’t help that it appeared that the Yard hadn’t even been able to come up with a single suspect.
The worst thing was, Sherlock already knew that he was coerced. He knew that he hadn’t killed anyone. But Sherlock was stubborn. He had seen Sherlock’s hatred for John take its hold over Sherlock before he walked away this afternoon. Sherlock already thought he had the answer. He wouldn’t look for opposing data. He almost wished that he had been the assassin instead of the doctor.
And then it hit Sherlock, the extent of John’s deceit.
“Victor,” John started, but the other man cut him off.
He gasped.
He had ripped the hair from the corpses, taking hours to make sure every last follicle was removed. That was the first day all on its own. John would tell Sherlock he had to work and then was going to the pub, but really he’d been removing a dead criminal’s pubic hair in an empty warehouse in Camden Town or Stratford or Barbican. But that was nothing compared to the second day, when he’d have to come back and finish the job. He’d use acid to burn off the finger prints, watching the chemicals burned through the skin, even begin to eat away at the hard finger nails. Then he would pull out their teeth and eyes, and would saw off the cartilage of their nose and ears.  And then finally he'd pour acid over the head, leaving it to dissolve until you started to see bone.
And then, suddenly after the moment of delay as the information washed over him the connections clicked in his mind.
Moran held up a blow torch which flicked on with a hiss. John held his breath. Moran began to dance the flame across his chest. He never held the flame too close or on any one spot too long, but he’d still have second degree burns, not that he’d live long enough for it to matter. It wasn’t even so bad, at first, as far as he imagined torture went. He involuntarily strained his body as he tried to get himself away from the searing pain of the flame, but he didn’t scream. And Moran didn’t touch his back. John was beginning to wonder it Moran would grow bored, and what he was going to do next. But apparently even a man like Moran who was trained in inflicting suffering couldn’t come up with a full 48 hours’ worth of torture, because after about 20 minutes of playing with the flame across John’s skin, Moran switched off the flame and punched John in the face. Darkness quickly descended.
And so he pushed himself under the water and inhaled.
, or that Anderson has done something particularly moronic, or simply that it's Monday. But no, this is not smoking out of stress, it’s out of spite. You usually smoke low tar cigarettes, or even roll your own, but you specifically bought menthols. Which can only mean that the medical examiner had to be called to the scene immediately to consult with you directly.”
“What’s that, Peacemaker? Or is it Mr. Peacemaker? Sir Peacemaker, maybe? Do you expect to be knighted for your efforts in making peace? Or do you like the ‘the’, a la The Terminator? Or would you like your other titles?”
“The skin grafting though is astonishing. I have friends who’ve had grafts from burns and their skin doesn’t look quite right afterwards, and even still it takes time to heal,” Lestrade said.
When Moriarty did turn around, he was holding a phone.
Sherlock quickly grew upset that John was not sharing in his excitement. He ripped the journal from John’s hands and held it in the air over his head, out of John’s reach.
“We could never be
John choked, coughing water out of his lungs as he regained consciousness.
Sherlock collapsed into his arm chair, his legs failing him.
"Sorry I'm a little eager. I've just waited so long for this," Sherlock whispered and it took all of John's self control not to come right then.
“Nothing at all? He didn’t even come by to pick up some things?”
“Eleven people, Johnny. Now, over the course of a career that hardly compares to someone like Seb, but how many people have you killed in the past year, Sebby?”
“He still doesn’t have a clue about either of us yet, thanks very much. He basically thinks I’m fucking Jim,” John rolled his eyes.
“So go find John, bring him in for questioning to see if he can give us any information on Moriarty, and then process him accordingly. Bring me a file when you’ve finished that. I’m sure there is no need for you to be here anymore,” Sherlock said dismissively before he huffed again and released his knees, leaning over the coffee table to pick up a small dish of fingernails that he’d been observing for an experiment.
“John, can I use your phone?” Sherlock looked over at John suddenly, who had gone back to observing his shoes.
John said nothing in response to Moriarty, still determined that not engaging would be the best approach for the moment. His mind was too busy churning in panic. If Moriarty did send that video to Sherlock, maybe it was purposefully to lure him in. John drew a slow breath, trying to push that train of thought out of his mind. He couldn’t bare it if Moriarty got to Sherlock now.
On the seventh day he began to get antsy.
“Just because Moriarty’s gone AWOL right now doesn’t mean that everyone who works for him and everyone who is loyal to him has suddenly disappeared. They’re all still operating, many of them are still in London. The cab driver, the Chinese smugglers, there are so many more people like them that are still in operation, waiting for Moriarty’s orders. Waiting to repay the debts they've acquired through his assistance. And the fact that Moriarty is likely abroad or in hiding right now makes it a perfect opportunity to find them and take them out without it catching his notice,” Victor explained.
“No,” Sherlock snapped aggressively. There was nothing that he could do now. Morality had left him a clue, he’d figured it out, but now the only thing he could do is wait. Wait and imagine all the horrible things Moriarty could be having done to John. Wait and wonder if right at that moment they’d run out of time and John was taking his last breath.
So he’d asked Lestrade to get a search warrant to enter the property. Mrs. Huxley’s and his homeless networks testimony were not actually a lot to go on, apparently. But Lestrade had found a JP who had a particularly strong vendetta against gang violence and played up Michael Huxley’s dedicated involvement in the government, another thing that this magistrate was obviously pretty fond of as dictated by his career choice.
Mycroft left after that, but returned the next day with a round-a-bout insult to John juxtaposed with a complaint about Sherlock dying of dehydration that had gotten Sherlock sitting upright in John’s chair having tea with his brother and Mrs. Hudson. The two of them talked. Sherlock said nothing.
This couldn’t be happening. In all the possible realities that Sherlock had ever considered, John drowning in the Thames in a ship wreck caused by Moriarty was not one of them. In fact, despite how he fought to try and protect John from Moriarty these past few weeks, he hadn’t ever considered it a possibility that John could actually die. John was his shining good thing. He had already survived so much, he was supposed to be invincible.
"Gunshot wound?" Sherlock couldn't help but squawk.
The silence was broken by the buzzing of John’s mobile. John looked at the message and his face paled. Sherlock watched in confusion.
“Um, no, John, he won’t be,” she murmured, hastily stuffing one more file into a rucksack.
Despite having confirmation of the existence of a vigilante that had been disassembling all of London’s criminal networks, and a name to match, Sherlock found it impossible to get any closer to assembling a full picture of what was going on. An entire team had been assembled down at the Yard as well on the mysterious man, but they had even less luck than Sherlock.
The fact of the matter was that he could no longer picture his life without John, and Sherlock realized that if he didn’t open up to John about how he really felt, he was going to lose him. And so not having John had suddenly come to mean Sherlock couldn’t do his work, which was completely unacceptable.
He sighed, hesitant to move, but slowly sat up, causing Sherlock to fall away from him with a whimper. He shushed Sherlock comfortingly as he lifted his hips and tugged his trousers and pants the rest of the way off, using his pants to clean up himself and Sherlock before tossing them across the room. He thought about taking off his jumper, feeling unbalanced fully dressed from the waist up but completely starkers from the waist down, but apparently he’d already taken enough time, because Sherlock growled and pulled him back down onto the mattress, quickly reclaiming John’s shoulder as his pillow.
“They found a narrowboat in the yachts boat hold,” Mycroft announced. Sherlock felt Lestrade tense besides him. “There is no sign to a body. The narrowboat was crushed though as the yacht went down. They’re going to have to excavate the wreck, resurface it piece by piece because of it’s positioning in the river anyway. Leaving the wreck would be too dangerous considering how trafficked the area is, none the less considering the concerns of it being a crime scene. They’re preparing to work through the night. Right now though the Marine Policing unit of the Met is in charge. If a body or any other indications of any sort of foul play is found, I’m sure the Gregory’s division will be notified.”
“All of London?”
Sherlock looked at Lestrade and raised his eyebrows.
“John, while that in theory sounds like a feasible plan, if this were, you know, a high budget Hollywood espionage film, how the hell do you plan to be more terrifying than Moriarty?”
John cringed at the word ‘brave,’ but felt the panic dissipate. Sherlock didn’t know, not really. He had only deduced that his mind wasn’t in the desert while he was dreaming.
Mycroft remained quiet. He reached out a hand and placed it on Sherlock's forearm. Something overcame his face that Sherlock had never seen before. If Sherlock had to call it something, he would have called it earnestness.
“He’s not a tool,” the woman, Mary perhaps, spat.
He pulled frantically against the chains that kept him tethered to the ceiling of the boat. He yanked and yanked and then yanked once more and whooshed forwards, the chains, while still bound to his wrists no longer holding him back having come detached from the ceiling.
And so he continued to sit. And Mycroft sat with him. At some point Lestrade showed up, Sherlock vaguely realized as the DI stood in front of Mycroft and himself. Mycroft and Lestrade exchanged a few words, but Sherlock didn’t seem to be able to hear them, or at least process what they were saying. Sherlock did recognize that someone sat down on the other side of him, a shoulder brushing up lightly against his own.
John furrowed his brow, not sure what that meant, but thankfully Mary quickly elaborated.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock sighed. "You’re safe. I won’t let him hurt us, do you understand? He'll be nothing by the time I'm through with him.” Sherlock babbled reassurances, but John couldn’t bring himself to listen to them. He smiled weakly at Sherlock, but he felt nauseated.
“Tax fraud?” John sputtered. He’d gotten out of hospital a week ago and had been taken to Victor and Mary’s base, which was actually a two bedroom flat in South London. Victor had given up his shoebox of a bedroom to John and was now sleeping on the couch.
“I really am sorry about all this damage I’ve done to you. I’d like to clean you up now though,” Moriarty began to speak again and the voice was grating on John’s ears. He wanted to shove the man away from him and curl into a ball with his eyes tightly shut and his hands over his ears.
John then, with all the pride he used to have, mustered the energy to thrust his body forwards. At first the chains that held him up rattled deliciously, sounding his rebellion. But then John was swinging backwards with his toes dragging across the floor, his body swaying slightly as he tried to balance himself on his toes.
“We’re going to find him, Sherlock.”
John owed Sherlock this. He’d surely hurt him so much, betrayed him so deeply, that the least he could do was this. It’s not like he had anything else anyway.
“Vic, quiet. I know where he is, I was able to track them on CCTV feeds after I received the video,” a woman’s voice Sherlock didn’t recognize explained.
Sherlock fought in vain still, bringing a foot up to push against the railing, causing both him and the person holding him back to fall backwards on to the ground. He rolled off of the assailant and tried to fling himself towards the railing, but was tackled to the ground. His arms were pinned on either side of his head as the other man knelt above him.
“You said we wouldn’t have to go abroad,” John groaned. “In fact, that was one of the first things you told me. ‘All of the people Moriarty has abroad are big fish who the second they realize Moriarty’s home network has been disassembled they’ll drop him,’” John rambled, vaguely trying to impersonate a woman’s voice but failing miserably as he very roughly paraphrased their first meeting.
In fact, if Lestrade had his way, which was never when it came to Sherlock, Sherlock probably wouldn’t even know as much as he did about the London’s ascension into the light, as the Met had taken to calling it like London had been Gotham all this time . Sherlock though stubbornly hung out around the yard whenever he could, and got himself access to files in any way, legal or not, he could manage.
His question was met with silence.
“You wouldn’t,” he growled.
He was sitting in a Taylor-Walker pub, its given name having something to do with Arms, not like that narrowed it down, in Bloomsbury. Across the table from him, Victor Trevor was sitting and eating a Steak and Ale pie and drinking a beer. Or was it technically an ale? Stout? Sherlock didn’t know and didn’t care. Victor had come back from the bar after placing his order with two of whatever it was and placed one in front of Sherlock, but Sherlock hadn’t touched his.
“We’ll get the doctor in here soon and he can run through everything with you, then we can talk, alright? I’ll go see if I can track down Victor,” the woman laid her hand over his and smiled gently at him, holding eye contact with him until John turned away, unable to handle the sympathetic look.
John was working with Moriarty.
“So I can break bones while naming them,” John said casually, although inwardly he was well pleased.
“And we still try to remain as removed from our man as much as possible. We’re completely underground, there is no record of us as far as any organization is concerned, particularly the government. All intelligence is exchanged via paper files drops to areas without CCTV and are burned when we’re done with them. This right now, actually, is the most involved he’s ever been with us,” Victor explained.
Victor! Sherlock remembered. He had known Victor had had something to do with the Peacemaker and Moriarty. He had known it all along.
It had been done for no reason other than to taunt him.
Sherlock felt a chill run through him.
“And this is exactly why we’re going over this. I was told that you wanted to be penetrated. Is that not the case?”
Fine.
“Just happened to be on hand,” John finished.
“As I said, we’ve done that before.”
“I wouldn’t worry about the specifics of that one, John.” Sherlock hedged.
“Now that’s something I wish you’d remember in the morning.”
“No! It’s not that, it’s…”
"Just...oh...a little...that's nice...warning would be good the next time," Sherlock said halfheartedly, ending on a sigh.
“Fine. I’m fine. I’m not drunk.” Sherlock said belligerently.
“You’re very talkative for someone I’ve glamoured. Usually the person doesn’t care about things like facts or their work and they’re never so animated during a consultation. I wish that I could let you remember all of this but I can’t take the risk of being locked up in a small prison cell. I’d go insane.”
“Yes. Yes. I’m your toy. Just…fuck me, John. I need it!” Sherlock pleaded.
Sebastian had finished up by drawing blood directly from the Port using a large needle and pronounced the procedure a ‘success.’ He flushed the Port with a saline solution followed by heparin to keep the blood from clotting in the catheter, then calmly walked to the sink and began clean up.
“What are you doing?”
“What could I do? The employees refused to complain. They’d say that the client just liked it a little rough. Obviously, I didn’t believe that but there’s not much I can do if they won’t talk to me about it. My hands were tied.”
“What was that, Anderson?”
“You ok? Am I hurting you?”
“I don’t know…wait! I have it. Walk into the hallway, naked, and yell ‘I’m Sherlock Holmes and I love sex!’ How’s your willpower now? Hmm?” John asked.
“That freak is going to kill someone someday and it’ll be a lot worse that just knocking some poor bloke over. No offense,” she nodded to John.
He couldn’t resist sliding his cock along Sherlock’s well lubed cleft before he picked up the bottle of lube again and added more to his fingers.
“You’re a half-breed, John. You’ve the best of both worlds. Religious objects don’t bother you. You could spend all day in a church if you chose to. And to answer your earlier question: yes, you can continue eating garlic,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John reluctantly handed the mobile to Sherlock watching as his face light up.
“I hope that you win but I’m not optimistic. I’ve never been beaten before.”
Pulling out of John, Sherlock went and dampened two flannels; one for himself and the other for John and set about cleaning them up.
John had paused all activity while he’d been thinking and realized that Sherlock was tense. That was good. He could use that.
“You did this just for me?”
“I can deal with it for one script. It’s not like there’s a lot to this one. It’s barely 25 pages long. It’s more of a ‘get right to the point’ kind of thing. Sometimes those are better.”
“Just. Just give me a moment to adjust.”
“You’re supposed to rough me up, fist me and fuck me? Well, I guess I should be thankful for the order. No wonder no lube is specified for intercourse. Sounds like there will be plenty inside of me before we even get to your cock.”
Tuesday, 1am
“You will.”
Sherlock stood outside contemplating his latest visit to Irene Adler’s upscale brothel. Black cards only, dear.
“What are you gonna do?” Anderson asked nervously.
Sherlock was speaking slowly and condescendingly into the mobile.
"Was this what you were expecting?" I asked.
“Cerinthe Major. Blue Honeywort. Bees are especially drawn to Honeywort. Did you know that John?” Sherlock asked without turning around.
“I’m already mad.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about and stop interrupting me or this is going to take forever.” Sherlock said, irritated.
“You needed that rest anyhow. Next time I’ll bring food. You’re too thin! How you don’t pass out with all that running you do I’ll never know.”
“I see that you’ve already begun the autopsy. Shouldn’t the body have been checked for evidence, blood samples, etc, before you began cutting it up? I don’t see the Forensic Pathologist around to take care of all of the work necessary to prepare the body to be examined.” Sherlock said with the attitude of someone who thinks they’ve caught someone in a mistake.
“You said it was a third!”
“What was that, love?”
“If I pass out in here it will be all your fault!”
“You’ve lucked out this time, Mister, but I’ll be back as soon as I’ve had a chat with Mrs Turner,” she said hurriedly heading for the door.
Afghan Desert
“‘Holy’? In what way is this holy?” Anderson burst out.
“Is he always like that?” John asked.
“I don’t eat.”
As they reached a lovely staircase where a manmade waterfall had been set up to at the top to dazzle the guests, Sherlock turned to John and hissed;
Week Three
Sherlock
Putting the iPad down on the nightstand, John reached over and cupped one creamy cheek and sighed.
Sherlock has a raging hard on; John wants to help him work it out.
“What a romantic.”
“Depends.”
“Because you said that you were almost done and I figured that I could make it the rest of the way.”
“I expect all of my employees to adhere to a high standard of service here. If they’re unable to live up to that standard, they’re told to seek employment elsewhere and sent on their way. Doctor Watson, though, is a godsend.”
John’s cock had begun leaking sometime around Sherlock’s “anything you want” moan and he knew without a doubt that he needed to have his cock embraced by Sherlock’s tight heat. John removed his fingers and;
Sherlock cooperated, reluctantly lifting his arse off of the mattress to give John better access.
“How do you know that? These transactions are business only, you don’t need to worry about anything else. Did Irene tell you that?”
“First of all, Dhamphir,” Sherlock said, pointing to himself. “So it’s impossible for me to be your father. Not to mention the fact that two men also preclude that from happening in both the human and supernatural worlds.”
‘I know he’s hidden my cigs around here somewhere. He’d never throw them out. I just need to think like John. That’ll take five minutes at most.’
“I still think he’s a pompous arse,” John said, again looking Mycroft up and down, much to the man’s annoyance.
“You know how he likes to save the day. Particularly when his man’s in danger.”
Month Two
“John?” Sherlock asked tentatively.
“Yes. Well, so many traumas all at one time. I’m sure he’s just confused and upset.”
Sherlock fucked John while rubbing his cock against his abdomen until they both felt the beginnings of their orgasms, stopped what the were doing and pressed even closer together riding out wave after waver of pent up desire.
“So. What are these two words then?”
“Oh, I’d imagine they got a heads up and have already abandoned the lab.”
“I thought so. I’m sure that there’s still a paramedic on site. I’ll send him over to check out your shoulder, yeah? That was a nasty fall you took. You should be more careful,” John said, using the hand on Anderson’s injured shoulder to lever himself up.
“Oh god,” Sherlock moaned as he tried to force himself onto John’s cock.
Not that Sherlock couldn’t figure out if someone entered the flat without a sound. John swore that he could sense a shift in air as soon as it had been displaced. Normally, that was very impressive and had saved their arses on more than one occasion. When he was this tired, though? Not so much.
“John?”
“That last one, not so much.”
“I can’t have you back there pounding into me while my back’s on fire!” Sherlock exclaimed.
“Well, when you’re not expecting anything, getting coffee, even vending machine coffee, is a well appreciated distraction from work.”
“What…what is that…?
Becca sat down in a nearby chair with a sigh.
Ignoring John’s questions completely, Sherlock said;
"And you keep winning?" Lestrade asked.
“When I put my mouth on your cock again…”
“Dammit!” Sherlock yelled at his mobile. He really hadn’t expected Moriarty to tell him anything but he’d allowed himself to have a sliver of hope anyhow.
“That’s a good question. Habit, I guess.”
“Yeah. Pretty sure I do,” John replied calmly.
“I know what you’re trying to do.”
“I only have one question for you and then we can go back to being dead to each other.”
“Indeed. None of this is in the least bit normal. I’m well aware of that. I think that we’d make a great team though, John. And you’d have your own room with the option to share my bed at any time. Permanently, if you desired. It’s not like you’d be a prisoner. You can move out of the flat at any time you’d like.” Sherlock looked into John’s eyes anxiously.
He realized that he’d only told Sherlock not to wait for him to walk John home. Not to let John SEE him. But he’d never actually warned him off of just being in the area when John left work. He was keeping his promise, literally.
Sherlock was shocked into silence by that statement.
“Maybe some pretzels at least?” Will tried again.
“John?”
I stepped back and Sherlock moaned a little at the loss of contact.
“So anxious,” Sherlock whispered raising his hips up to meet John’s cock again.
“Oh Bob, look at him! He looks just like you!” She held the baby up moving the blanket away from his face so that Bob could see him better.
“But don’t you see, John? I don’t care about that…”
“I already have a home and we haven’t even known each other that long,” John said, sitting up beginning to look for his clothes which were scattered about the floor.
"They don't know about it - yet. We'd like to remain invisible to the public eye. Humans wouldn't take kindly to finding out that Vampires and Dhamphirs are real. It's in the best interest of all parties involved that news such as 'woman completely drained of blood found in field' remain unsubstantiated.
Sherlock had fallen asleep waiting for John. His dark lashes fanned against alabaster cheeks and he breathed deeply through slightly parted lips.
“You mean that you won’t.” Sherlock said, stepping back.
“I wouldn’t want you too anyhow. I do wish that we’d quit getting caught by the cops with our pants down all the time though.”
“Be myself? Yes. I think I can manage that.
“That’s more like it. See how easy that was? Well, go on. Get moving. Jackie boy doesn’t have all day, you know,” Jim said, laughing at his own comment.
“That our being together was meant to be and I don’t even believe in that sort of thing. Predestined, I think it’s called. And not everyone even finds their Soul Mate. I’ve always gone my own way. Made my own decisions. Why would I think that I needed someone, anyone? My life was perfect and then there you were, leaning over a dead body and my world view suddenly tilted on its axis and I…changed. That’s very difficult for me, changing. I know that’s hard to believe but…”
“Fuck you! I’ll have you up on charges for assaulting an officer!”
“Nope. Don’t need to. I just need access to your arse and your cock which are conveniently located in the same neighborhood,” John said, pulling the belt through the loops with a surprising snap and tossing it behind his back.
“Ah. Is it this then?” John sucked the skin of Sherlock’s thigh hard enough to leave a bruise and then looked up at Sherlock expectantly. He was running out of ideas.
“Great. Since leaving the military…,” John began.
“OW! Goddamn it!” Sherlock exclaimed, slamming the door behind him.
“So smart. That’s right. Now, stand up. I believe that I have a spanking to administer,” John said.
“That’s so nice! Let’s have that, shall we? Well, water first. Wouldn’t want you to get dehydrated.” John said, using the ties holding Sherlock’s wrists together to pull him up.
“What’s this?” Sherlock asked.
Alpha/Omega Courtship Manual 2021 Edition
John tightened his arm around Sherlock and kissed his forehead.
“I don’t care! Anderson, go through the house and see if you can discover any other evidence related to this murder,” Lestrade said.
“Really.”
“What am I supposed to do with this?” Sherlock asked, looking down at the book with a frown.
“Oh. For the love of…fine. Lazy Man sex?” Sherlock asked, exasperated. He was getting into John’s arse tonight if it was the last thing he did and he suspected it would be.
“Oh, yes. I have. Shall we?” John gestured Sherlock up the grand staircase ahead of him admiring his arse the entire way.
“There. See?! Comfy, right?” Sherlock said with a smile.
“Ok. Where are we going?” John asked resignedly.
“Ah! A challenge!”
Sliding another finger in, he pumped Sherlock’s hole several times until Sherlock set his own rhythm, fucking John’s mouth and on the withdrawal, fucking John’s fingers.
“Their eyes don’t generally linger on a man’s flies unless they’re thinking something unsavory.” Sherlock smirked. All confidence and superiority.
Sebastian looked at the clock on the wall and said; “It’s 12pm. Isn’t that when your shift normally ends?”
“No. No. I’d like to think that we’ve become friends these past few weeks. You ever need to talk, just let me know. Otherwise, there’s always football,” Sebastian said with a smile.
They turned and began the walk home in an uncomfortable silence, John with an angry frown on his face.
We’ve talked about those ghastly emoticons, John.
John nodded and started to turn but hesitated, hooking his thumb over his shoulder. “But don’t you think we should help?”
“Yes. He was a very bad mad man though. Wretched work ethic.”
“Solved it already, have you, genius?”
Sherlock slid onto his knees, next to where John was sitting and playing with Rosie. Her pudgy hands were busy pulling each toy out of her toy bin, dropping them on the floor one at a time from her tottering stance, and shouting ‘uh oh!’. The game had been a favourite lately. Thankfully, ‘clean up everything and put it back in the bin’ was still an equally favourite game. He snuck a kiss to the top of her head while she was distracted.
“My inside contact only mentioned one guard but said she thought she could distract him enough so we could get inside.”
"Unless what, Lestrade? I cannot abide unfinished sentences. I may be impressive but I cannot actually read minds."
John had just swallowed down his third synthetic whisky, scarcely even noticing the difference, when he felt a clap on his bad shoulder. He flinched, snapping his head round, fist already clenching in anticipation for a fight with some drunken idiot.
“John, I…” Again, his words failed him and now John was looking properly worried, his eyebrows drawn together. It was late and Sherlock knew John had been thinking about turning in for the night. Moonlight streamed in through the open curtains at Sherlock’s back, the night cold but clear. They’d spent the day in the park with Rosie, and then Rosie had played with Mrs Hudson while they’d sorted out some dreary paperwork from their latest case. They’d had spaghetti bolognese for dinner and Sherlock had given Rosie a bath while John balanced their finances. They’d all three curled up on the sofa to read a bedtime story, and Rosie had been tucked into bed and sleeping peacefully for hours. It had been a perfectly normal, uneventful Saturday, a domestic respite from their busy lives and it was exactly that unremarkableness that prompted Sherlock to do what he was about to do, if only he could find the words.
“Every single day, my love.”
have known..." But the man wasn't done. He inhaled deeply, a small smile teasing the corners of his bastardly mouth. "Lucky guess. Good one, though."
“Yeah! That’s what I’m saying. Great, innit? Like a professional! Had no idea, no idea. You've both been holdin' out on us!”
“Yes, I’ve bloody well heard of Magnussen but what does that have to do with —”
Sherlock smiled as he climbed gracefully to his feet, the soft smile he reserved especially for Rosie. “Oh yeah. ‘Toor-tah!’” He mimicked her word for turtles perfectly. It was one of the words he’d taught her, from a favourite book of theirs that he read to her frequently. He dusted his hands and tipped his head toward the tiger cage. “I believe I’ve got what I need. Shall we?” His cordiality was so at odds with their surroundings that John let out a chuckle as he fell into step beside his long-legged partner, who automatically slowed his own steps to match John’s.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully but instead of doing any of Greg's suggestions, he took another big bite and propped his feet up on the desk.
“Go on then.” One woman with bright orange-coloured hair said from nearby. She was dressed in forensics coveralls, bright blue sunglasses and Vans shoes. Sherlock nodded at her before drawing in a deep breath and launching into his deduction. John smirked as he watched her eyes go wide.
… I’d love nothing
Sherlock watched, bemused, as John nodded and walked to their bedroom to retrieve his phone.
“Find someone who has intimate knowledge of the zoo. Employee, possibly former. May have retained a key to the enclosure. Probably someone with a record of violence. Rapes, domestic abuse, etc. Probably not any other homicides. This was done in a panic, not well planned. This is not someone who has a long history of literally getting away with murder.” Sherlock moved around as he spoke, gesturing. John mirrored his steps unconsciously, stepping to the side, but never lowering his arms from where they were crossed, watching as Sherlock became more and more animated, his eyes positively sparkling. “Oooh. Yes. Does he bring them here? Maybe promises a rare sighting of the animals? No. There’s something else! Something I’m missing…” He pressed his fingertips together in front of his mouth, but pulled them away quickly with a look of disgust. John raised an eyebrow as Sherlock sniffed at his fingers, looked at them, sniffed again. He snapped, flashing a brilliant smile at John and waving his hand around. “That’s it! The sardine oi! We’re looking for an employee, current or former though my guess is on the latter, with a history of violence, potentially against domestic partners, sex workers, that sort of thing.”
“Ow, John. No need to shout. I’m right here. I came back up to get my phone. Are you nearly ready? We should’ve been on the road ten minutes ago!”
Greg nodded sympathetically. “Aye, the good ol’ days.”
Gary spluttered, his eyes wide as they bounced from John’s arm to both of their faces, now only inches apart. Sherlock held his hand out and blinked at him, waiting. God, but people were slow.
“Probably not worth it, no, but we’ve got nothing else on lately.”
“I wonder,” he began in a low purr, “if my favourite associate criminal would like to move this upstairs?”
The song ended and another person took the “stage”. This time, it was one of the Yarders, someone from a different division that John didn’t know well, but recognised. She began a very giggly rendition of
“Nah, got out of there not long after you. DI with the Yard now. And what about you? Where are you working these days?”
He thought of John Watson, looking like he'd aged twenty years, though it had only been six or seven years since he'd last seen him. If what Sherlock had said about him was true, and it usually was, these last few years had been especially unkind to his former colleague and friend. It had been good to see him anyway and Greg hadn't failed to notice the appreciative way John had looked him up and down. Maybe once upon a time, a younger Greg may have...
. You’re marvelous. You made me a mystery for our anniversary!” Sherlock’s throat felt suspiciously tight at this revelation. He clapped gleefully to distract from the sensation.
He propped his head on his fist against the window and was just barely conscious enough to notice Sherlock’s hand reach over and flick on the car’s radio. The soft classical music and the hypnotic whirr of tyres on pavement lulled him the rest of the way to sleep in no time at all.
Sherlock nodded and got to his feet, striding to the edge of the enclosure and out the door. John glanced around before following. Lestrade was outside on the footpath, speaking to a few other officers.
John didn’t see Sherlock’s raised inquisitive brow, as he’d already turned away, rifling through the discarded newspaper and empty plates scattered across the table.
things about people sometimes. Read them, you know? Especially when they’re… but you, you said you’re not and I respect that. I respect people’s boundaries and labels. If that’s not what you’re comfortable with, than I respect that. I should be able to switchsies a few other people around and…” He tapped at his ancient reservation book with his pen, humming thoughtfully.
He played for what felt like hours, telling their story the way he best knew how. The melancholy of longing, of heartbreak, of distance before the swelling exhilaration of confession, of sentiment returned, of shared love and laughter and memories, of a life built on friendship and passion and the mutual thrill of danger. He didn’t dare look at John while he played because he knew he’d falter, lose his confidence, crumble under the hefty weight of his shared feelings.
“Billy! Billy come quick!”
“True. Here’s your milk, Rosie. Now finish up and put your plate in the sink. Oh, this weekend? It’s our anniversary, Sherlock. I was thinking we could do… I dunno. Something to celebrate. Six years married, I mean, it isn’t ten, but I still thought — yes, you can go watch telly for a bit. Just one show and then you need a shower. Don’t forget your dishes!”
Sherlock did not answer, turning his back on the softly smiling sun at the center of his universe and walking to the window, glaring down at all the happy people.
"John Watson. Former ah... colleague of Greg."

If Sherlock’s voice cracked a bit on the
And I missed you too.
She complied, fluttering her eyelashes at him. He scoffed. No time for flirting; a man’s life was at stake.
“Well, actually—”
“Doctor Watson!” The inn owners shouted gleefully in unison, as though greeting a long-lost friend, rather than someone who once tried to implicate them in a crime. John gave them a nod and a wave before stomping off, presumably in search of the loo. At least, that’s where Sherlock hoped he had gone, and not tearing back off in the Land Rover like a demon hound.
John sat back on his heels to wait, staring at the thick wall of glass before him showing off a dazzling view of the city. He listened hard for any sign of Sherlock or the paramedics, but the building was eerily silent around him. He picked up the bloke’s wrist to take his pulse as he moaned again, his head twisting back and forth on the ground.
With a shrug, John stuck out his hand.
of physical exertion and lack of proper rest, scarcely recuperating from one fight or flight for his life before the next challenge presented itself, often in the unexpected flash of a concealed blade or slip of the tongue that gave him milliseconds of decision-making time before he needed to run again, his disguise tenuous and slipping more each day, growing nearly careless in his need for respite.
“‘ere’s the main part, where we rent out rooms for people. Nathan and me, we live in the back wing, so’s we’re not disrupting the guests. I’ll take you there.”
“Well, yes, probably, but I’m just sort of surprised that
John nodded again and followed Sherlock down the stairs, slipping out of the building by way of an emergency exit staircase. Sherlock was right. This wasn’t their problem. Though it niggled him a bit, he couldn’t be bothered with more than that, his body flooded with overwhelming relief over Sherlock’s safety. He reached down as they jogged away from the building to find a cab and found Sherlock’s hand, giving it a quick squeeze. Sherlock returned the gesture.
Heavy artillery thundered around him, punctuated by the sharper sound of gunfire and the panicked voice of the young private. He could feel the heat of the earth, smell the copper tang of blood, see the bright red as it poured over and between his fingers. But his hands were steady, staunching the flow as he held the soldier’s life force literally in them.
“Buy a round on me, yeah?” He pulled out his wallet and handed her his card.
John chuckled, feeling a bit sheepish that he’d got caught drowning his sorrows in a bottle like a common drunk. “Er, yeah. Caught me. Bit of a shit day. You know…” He trailed off, feeling distinctly uncomfortable with the knowing gaze of Greg pinning him to the spot. But Greg just smiled.
“That’s the thing. No injuries in line with being attacked and she was found bound.”
No sooner had they switched places, the lovely nurse dropping to her knees to pull him out of his low-slung trousers, her hand warm and soft and —oh god, that beautiful
“You know which sorts of cases I’m referring to.” Greg replied coolly, moving past Sherlock and scooping his jacket from the back of his chair. He slid his arms into the sleeves and motioned with his head.
“John. We will not be visiting any secret military bases or leading a hound hunt through any mires. We will have a… relaxing…” He said the word as though it was foreign to him. John thought it probably was the first time he’d ever said it unironically in his life. “...four days and then return to London in one piece on Monday. I do hope you’re not disappointed.” He flashed a cheeky grin, but John could see that his eyes were a bit worried. John sighed.
John flushed and cleared his throat. It didn’t matter how many years it had been or how long they’d been partners in every sense of the word, Sherlock’s praise would always be important. But then Sherlock’s expression changed, his eyebrows raised. “Is this an admission that you have a lot of experience and/or interest in various bindings? Purely for academic reasons, surely?” His eyes had a mischievous glint to them.
Sherlock was drumming his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel and was already pulling out into the sparse mid-afternoon traffic before John even had his belt on.
in this very moment than to marry you, John Watson. Will you— would you like that too?” The words were still difficult, made more difficult yet again by the emotion tightening his throat. John nodded, pressing his lips together in a losing effort to contain his own evident emotions.
"I can't abide him anymore."
I think the engraving is wearing off a bit, too.
He marched past this colourful show of depravity and turned the corner onto a much quieter street. As he walked, his surroundings morphed, losing their sheen. The sounds of people giving in to their vices gave way to the sights and sounds he had become more accustomed to as of late. Buildings crumbled, gunfire ricocheted and the bodies of collateral damage stayed where they fell. At the end of the street, he pushed his way into a makeshift tent, its canvas singed at the edges from more than one close call. He entered and took in the sight on the table in front of him: a soldier with a bloody stump where his arm had once been was writhing and screaming. John cleared his throat and the medics crowding the table snapped their heads round, their hands automatically moving to salute. John swallowed down a smile and gave a perfunctory nod.
“I’m certainly no expert on women’s lingerie, but I don’t think…”
They kept their composure through the main lobby and all the way home in the cab, besides exchanging quick glances and smothered smiles. But by the time they made it through the front door of Baker Street, they couldn’t contain it any longer. They leaned against the wall, breathing hard through their giggles in a way reminiscent of their first night together, so many years ago.
John looked up, eyes wide. “Oh my god… you didn’t tell me you’re feeling ill! C’mere, let me feel your forehead.”
“No reason not to. Floor had recently been mopped— the cleaning woman confirmed that. She mopped around half-eight, then took the lift down. Receptionist used the loo shortly after, heard a crash and found him sprawled on the floor like that. Sounds to me like an accident, no reason to think otherwise.”
“Aye, but isn’t that lovely!? A real romantic murder mystery! And I bet all the intrigue and death-defying keeps it exciting. Good on ya! Dyfal donc a dyr y garreg. A pint to celebrate and then you can go to your room. I’m sure you have a lot of catching up to do. All that time lost!”
a couple, though the way that man goes on about you on that blog of his… well, you just can
Ok, good. Sherlock lengthened his steps as he hurried to the front entryway and up the elaborate grand staircase, warring with the idea of shouting for Robert. In the end, he decided not to, hoping to have the element of surprise on his side if Nathan really was waiting in the room for him.
“Hmm? You hate when I do what? Ruin your game of hide-and-go-seek with your mobile? Or revive it from its untimely death at your hands?”
“What’s this then? Something the matter with our room?” John’s voice was crisp, confident, in control. Sherlock thought he’d never loved him more.
Sherlock raised an imperious eyebrow at Lestrade's sudden chuckle.
John glanced down at himself, at his chinos that had been twice repaired and hemmed, at his shoes that were scuffed and probably had a collection of bodily fluids splashed onto them, at the missing button on the bottom of his shirt.
“You need a bath tonight, little missy.” Sherlock got to his feet, brushing off the knees of his trousers and checking to ensure that his shirt — sapphire blue, a recent birthday gift from John— was still tucked in before sliding his arms into the jacket he’d tossed onto the arm of the sofa. John stood too, moving in close and straightening Sherlock’s lapels. He gave him a sweet, chaste kiss.
Gary gave him a very serious nod. “Of course, of course. But Sherlock— sorry, should I call you William? — I’m so sorry, there was a mistake, a misunderstanding with your reservation. Billy must have done. I only have you booked for one room. I’m not making that mistake again, I know you made it very clear last time that you and John were
of their night once they arrived home, as well.
Tearing himself away from the door and the sight of a sleeping John was difficult, but Sherlock was nudged on by a sudden idea. He took the stairs two at a time and grabbed his violin and bow from where they were resting in his open violin case. Tapping his finger against his bottom lip, he thought for a moment before sliding his violin into position under his chin and letting the first few notes of the piece fill the flat with an uplifting sweetness that he hoped would be just right to lull John back into a peaceful sleep.
The words were a comforting sight to his weary eyes. When he’d left his session earlier in the evening, Mary had been waiting for him outside the door, armed with a hammer and a litany of scathing words. When she’d exhausted them all, she slammed out of the house, making the thin walls rattle. He hadn’t bothered to reply, simply limped into their sorry excuse for a kitchen, slammed a dinged aluminium pot onto the hob and dumped in a can of beans, yelling to their eldest to keep an eye on it and to feed the rest of the ruffians. The two-year-old had watched him with serious eyes, her face dirty and sticky. He’d scowled at her and ripped a hard bit off the skint end of the bread, tossing the rest onto the scratched surface of the table. It wobbled from the impact.
Greg made sure to enunciate the last few words, though bemused look on Sherlock's face told him the insufferable man wasn't listening to a word he said.
Greg motioned with his hand to a table in the corner, where a group of men and women, some in police uniforms and others in plainclothes, were stripping off coats and scarves and settling in. John couldn’t hear anything over the din of chatter in the pub, but their body language was such that he could tell there was an air of joviality to their congregation.
must look. He wondered if John, his John, his brave and loyal and wonderful John, could tell that his palms were sweating where he gripped his violin neck and bow’s frog, that his arms felt quivery with nervous energy, that his heart felt swollen in a way that made him wonder briefly if it was possible to actually
“So let’s go,” He heard himself say, and couldn’t be certain which of them was more surprised. John looked up at him quizzically, as though sure he’d misunderstood, or was about to become the latest victim of one of those prank television series.
It was not eloquent by any stretch of the imagination but at least he had John’s attention. He could express the rest of his feelings, he hoped, through his music. John had always been receptive to that, despite his lack of formal musical training. He understood the emotions of the music Sherlock played, because he understood
“Hello, John.
“Nurse, press here, hard!”
“John?! But… Rosie? I thought… the sleepover… and you had to work late. What are you doing here?? Did you— are you?” His head swivelled from his husband, who was now looking ridiculously smug, to Robert, who was trying unsuccessfully to hide a grin. Robert stood and bowed his way quickly out of the room with a wink.
“Sherlock. You can’t just…” Lestrade rubbed his palm down his face. “You can’t just barge in here, first off. This is a secured scene. Officials only. I told you we had this one under control. And secondly— wait what was that about the brother-in-law? She doesn't even have a brother-in-law. I thought she was an only child...”
Sherlock :-) Good morning, luv.
“Mmm… indeed I do. Love you too.”
It didn’t take long for him to find room number four, and the key fitted easily in the lock. Sherlock held his breath and pushed open the door.
"Better off finding a robot."
With a groan, Lestrade waved Sherlock on, though everyone was already giving him a plenty wide berth as he continued his purposeful walk through the foyer towards the back of the house.
diva and drama queen and John wouldn’t trade him for the world.
“‘Ello? ‘ope it’s al'ight I let meself in. Only there was such a racket, didn’t think ya could ‘ear me. One of you is Sherlock ‘olmes?
Sent 16:53
Too much for ya, love? ;-)
Sherlock shrugged and moved to put his violin away.
“Is that Sherlock?!” He asked stupidly to no one in particular. Lestrade laughed, his face flushed and sweaty.
He glanced up to orient himself once the drinks were in his hand and caught Sherlock’s eye. Sherlock grinned at him, young and boyish looking. He was having a good time. He’d sat next to Sam Gregson, the newest detective on the force, whom they’d encountered on a few cases already. John thought he was a bit awkward, but Sherlock was shockingly impressed with him.
"With the... war? The collapse of the nation?" Greg sighed, bending to pull his tablet from his bag. "Anderson is a terrible assistant because he's not an assistant at all, Sherlock!  He’s a forensics specialist and you’d do well to remember that.”
“Where’s the house? You said it was a family house. Where is it?”
Well, nearly complete. There was one tiny thing in particular, a scrap of an idea that had taken hold, gaining momentum with each day that passed until he could no longer ignore it. He wanted to marry John. In itself, as an institution, marriage had never meant much to him. It seemed archaic, unnecessary; a piece of paper that was redundant at the best of times, and complicated at the worst. He loved John and John loved him. They loved their daughter. Their life was complete. And yet, he found himself longing for the last piece of the puzzle, the step to make everything official. His final declaration of intention.
” He rolled his eyes self-deprecatingly. “Made that mistake already!”
"Can that be arranged?"
“That’s plenty enough butter, young lady. Did you finish your homework earlier? A road trip? Where?”
“You forgot.”
, the
John gave Greg an appreciative glance. He’d always been a good-looking fella; had had boyish charm and a babyface that certainly got enough attention when they’d been in their twenties as a young doctor and security guard. But where John could see the toll that age and the inevitable pull of gravity had taken on his own features, it seemed to have had the opposite effect on Greg. His face had slimmed, features sharpened, messy dishevelled mop of hair tamed into a silver coif that made him look distinguished and more than a little handsome. John glanced away, aware that he’d probably let his gaze linger just a touch too long.
“Believe I have, yes.”
Or rather, since “Afghanistan or Iraq”.
“Yes, I made a reservation.” He dropped his voice to a whisper. “Under William Scott, just in case. Didn’t want any unwanted attention.” He tipped his head in the direction of the young women who were now not even attempting to hide their very obvious eavesdropping. Sherlock sighed theatrically. “You know how it goes.”
, I think that might well backfire, since I’m a bit swayed in my bias toward endearment. Comes with the territory, I think.” John pretended to think. “Does he still have those weird connections at the Yard? Maybe he could show them… not that you’d care… never one for modesty, were you?”
“No… it would be…” He turned, shielding his eyes and squinting, then retracing his steps. “The oak… hmmm. But if the sun was… if it was June, then… aha!”
an assistant. I’m the brains of this operation. Surely you can’t expect me to do all the legwork too." Sherlock sat up, brushing crumbs off of his bespoke suit. "Tea?”
one of John’s favourite songs of all time.
With a sigh, Lestrade put the car into reverse and backed out of the car park. When he arrived to the crime scene twenty minutes later, he was relieved not to see a lanky “consulting detective” striding about, barking orders at people. On the drive over, he'd wondered if that was why Sherlock had been so uncharacteristically obedient. Wasn't like him at all and Greg had learned from experience that when Sherlock was acting less bizarre than his usual level, something was amiss. But the scene was peaceful, officers going about their business, albeit slowly and much more methodically than Sherlock would have. Sighing again, Lestrade parked the car and got to work.
“John!”
The pretty nurse scrambled to her feet, her eyes wide as she took in the spectre thundering down the alley, the delicate lace folds of her dress at odds with the fury broadcasting from every pore.
To his surprise, Sherlock followed him to the lift, looking aloof but resigned. At the ground floor, he slipped out of the lift without so much as a backwards glance for Greg.
“Birmingham.”
“Oi. Don’t I know, don’t I know. You too, mate? It’s just all shit lately, innit?” Greg heaved a sigh and motioned to the barstool next to John. He shifted his weight, damn leg acting up and nodded gratefully. “Yeah, unoccupied.” He held up two fingers to the greasy barkeep leering at them from across the worn wooden top.
“Well don’t let me keep you…” John motioned to the group.
John nodded and Sherlock was on his feet, prowling around the enclosure, but not before John caught the hint of reddening on his ears. Two years, they’d been sleeping together, co-parents and partners in every sense, and Sherlock was still so easy to rile up. John grinned to himself as he pulled out his notebook, jotting down notes as he examined the body.
“Birmingham.”
“Of course, kid. You’ve got your whole life ahead of you. Would be a damn shame to lose it all because of a silly war injury. You were brave, Private. Good day.”
“John, Freddie Mercury could hardly be classified as merely ‘pop culture’, since so much of his music is still easily and immediately recognisable, even decades later.” Sherlock waved his hand in the air. “He was an icon.”
John nudged Sherlock with his shoulder, lifting his own glass. Sherlock followed suit and the quartet all clinked glasses.
“I’ll think about it. See if we can get someone to watch Rosie for the weekend.”
“Excellent!” He scowled at his hands. “I need to wash the oil off my hands and we have a little girl to put to bed. Coming, John?”
“I had some help, but yeah. Happy anniversary. You solved that impressively quickly. Always knew you were a genius. Others tried to tell me otherwise, but I always said, oh no, you must be talking about a different Sherlock, because mine is a damn ge—mmm! Well. Hello. I think I deserved that for all the hard work I put into this! Hello husband.”
John sobered finally, turning to look Sherlock square in the face.
“Sherlock, you can stop now. He’s gone.”
“Sherlock??
“I had no idea he could sing! Should’ve done this ages ago!”
“Really? After all this time, I still impress you?”
Silent as a church mouse, Sherlock pressed his palm against the smooth wood and pushed the door open slowly, so as not to draw attention. Every muscle of his body was taut, coiled and ready to fight the intruder. He squeezed his eyes shut briefly, afraid of the lack of noise, terrified that when he opened them it would be to an empty room, or an injured (or worse) John.
John chuckled, the spell of the moment not broken but dispersed, scattered into a thousand pinpricks of light that filled the room with its magic as he pulled away and went to the kitchen to make their tea, the warmth of his love lingering, filling Sherlock with so much he felt ready to burst.
“No, I’m not agreeing with him. This guy is a creep, obviously. And a sexist arsehole, pardon my language. Sounds like a real winner. This young woman had people who were looking out for her— she was reported missing less than six hours after she was last seen.”
, we are going to be
“I love you, too.” He yawned on the last word, his jaw cracking so loudly Sherlock could hear it from where he stood, bouncing nervously on the balls of his feet in front of the window. “I’m knackered. Think I’ll turn in. You coming?” He made to stand up and Sherlock held up his arm, the bow in his hand bouncing wildly.
“My face is?”
Sherlock pulled a sympathetic face, his eyes growing wide and puppylike.
Worked with his hands then. Mechanic of some sort. His hair was shaggy and even from halfway across the sitting room, Sherlock could smell the cigarette smoke that permeated his clothing.
“Is it something worth driving all the way to Birmingham — oh for God’s sake. Grab the paper, Ro. Yes, I know it was an accident. But you should’ve asked for help if you couldn’t reach. It’s alright. Go finish your spaghetti. No more bread.”
With quick efficiency, he hooked a finger in the gaping hole and fished the bullet out of the young man's femoral artery. The man – kid, really, couldn’t have been more than nineteen or twenty — screamed in pain and the nurse shushed placating words at him, murmuring too quietly to even be heard over his screams. John reached into his kit and pulled out a rag, leaning over and shoving it into his mouth.
“Pfft. Easy. Child’s play. Saw it all along.”
You squirm a bit, and then you let out that deep throaty moan…
Greg settled into the seat next to him and John realised he wasn’t in the usual uniform of a security guard, but a nice shirt and trousers.
“Pretty girl. Shame. Any identification on her?”
Greg’s mouth opened but Sherlock was quicker.
“Mmm, what’s that you’re playing?”
Sherlock nearly scoffed aloud, caught himself just in time.
Sherlock smiled as he stepped back. “Yes, well. Maybe if you’re well-behaved, later you might—”
“No, I’m fine! I’m having fun!”
I’ll meet you at the altar.
When he finished, the sitting room was silent, the ghost of the last lingering note dissipating into the air. He busied himself with loosening the hairs of his bow and putting it and his violin carefully away in its case, dawdling over the fasteners. At last, he looked up, and it was into beloved blue eyes, swimming with unshed tears. He went to John, knelt down in front of his chair, held his hands in his own. John squeezed his fingers.
“Oh, fuck. Yes, yes, fuck me. Just like that, oh yes, DOCTOR! YESSS! HEAL ME!”
Greg rolled his eyes, but turned and motioned Anderson out of the room. “Anderson, did you scan all the clickers for prints? Go do as he says. Might as well.”
The night progressed in much the same way: songs were sung, drinks were had, everyone got a bit looser and friendlier, comrades of the evening. Sherlock’s enjoyment of the music progressed from foot tapping and humming to absentmindedly singing a few lyrics in between sips of his drink and animated discussions across the tiny table. When Lestrade took the stage to belt out a rollicking, if very off-key, version of
Of course I am. Never take it off.
always meaning Baker Street… and John. The fingers of his left hand pressed into his thumb, the long-loved melancholy melody taking shape in his mind as he played his invisible violin. He missed his violin, hopefully still tucked safely away in its case in the sitting room, in the space between the sofa and the wall. He played himself to sleep, his face damp with tears as he slipped into unconsciousness, far far away from home.
"Why would anyone actually work here? Seems like a terrible job. Not even a tea cart. But... you need me. So even though you pretend to be fed up with me, you're not keen to get rid of me any time soon. Not when I make you look so damn good all the time."
Sherlock didn’t answer, so John left him there spluttering and slipped into the loo, the smile never leaving his face.

“Came with the crew from the Yard. Tough case solved. Been plaguing us for months, no pun intended. Having a bit of a celebration.”
"But she's not sticking around for long, is she? Divorce is inevitable, maybe because of your drinking habits, maybe because of your addiction to internet porn. Ah... no. It's the H.A.V.E.N, isn't it? Temporary hit of excitement to overshadow your otherwise completely mediocre life."
That spot behind my ear, though…
The train slowed to a stop shortly after, rousing Sherlock from his grumpy reverie. He collected his case, glaring at it. Maybe if he solved the case quickly enough, he could catch a late train back home.
Sherlock groaned.
"Nice to see you, Greg. Evening, mates."
Sherlock shrugged, moving to the door. “These magnate types have a high suicide rate and understandably so. No mystery here whatsoever. John? Good evening, Lestrade, we’ll be on our way. Have something more interesting for me next time you call, would you?”
John suddenly remembered his phone and pulled it out quickly to capture a few photos and perhaps a secret video or two, that would certainly be cherished forever, and

interrupt me.” With the resource-suckers dealt with, he’d eased himself into the bedroom and shut and locked the door. It was the only door in the house that locked and he’d claimed it as his own shortly after he and Mary had moved in, filling it with all of the equipment needed to create his virtual reality heaven. The prototype of the tech had been introduced just months before the war erupted, an immediate reaction to a country divided, stretched thin from one global disaster after another.
“Sh’lock! You left your mo—”
I have it on good authority that you do, in fact, blush.
if we don’t leave in the next four minutes. I’ll leave your hair just like this, so help me… Sherlock?
Overhead, the distant rumbling thunder suddenly broke loose in a hell-storm of angry lightning and roaring wind. Rain splattered against them in furious waves, but John pushed on, slamming into her body again and again as they both rode the wave of climax.
“Oh shit… later! It’s Saturday, isn’t it? Oh fuck, I completely forgot.”
“Not big readers, then.” He said, to no one in particular and missing John with a sudden ache. He flicked on the lamp, settled into one of the chairs, and pulled out his phone, flicking through the pictures. His lips moved as he read the riddle to himself and then, moving to the desk, pulled out a sheet of paper, flipping to the map picture as he sketched out a rough layout of the estate.
Always has been.
“Li’l star, Daddy! A-gain! A-gain! Mo-wah!”
Sherlock pulled up the back of her shirt — the straps of her bra were twisted, the hooks clasped wonkily, only one of the three hooks attached correctly to its loop.
? Gary! Gary, c’mere, it’s Sherlock Holmes!” Billy came around the bar top and embraced Sherlock tightly in a one-armed hug. Sherlock could feel the eyes of several patrons on him, but they were all politely British enough to fix their attention back to their food quickly.
It’s yours. It’s all yours. My heart, my life, my very soul.
Sherlock was muttering to himself, crouching and running his finger along the edge of a tech-y looking cabinet. Multi-coloured lights were flashing rhythmically. He suddenly flung up a hand, whipping his head around to stare daggers at Philip Anderson, the forensics specialist assigned to the case.
Sherlock glanced sidelong at him. “John, surely you recognise where we are? Or have you deleted it? They do say that repressing memories are one indicator of post-traumatic stress disorder…” Once again, Sherlock trailed off, his eyes still on the road but developing the glazed look that meant his mind was far away. Thankfully, they appeared to be the only car for kilometers.
Sherlock returned the grin and then abruptly leaned forward, sliding his mouth against John’s. John huffed in surprise but caught on after only a second, deepening the kiss and wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s slim waist. As it started to get even more heated, Sherlock pulled back slightly, and John thought that maybe he’d gone too hard, too fast. This was all so very new for them. But Sherlock smiled, resting his soft lips against John’s forehead.
Sherlock plucked it from John’s hand with one hand, making a show of rubbing his ear with the other.
“Tell me about this house.”
Never too much. Just needed to…
“G’bye, Nana! Bye Daddy!”
. Oh,
At the top of the stairs, he skidded to a stop at the sound of a female’s voice. He forced himself to take a deep breath, reaching around to retrieve his gun from his waistband. It wouldn’t do to get himself killed before he even found Sherlock. He flattened himself against the wall, risking a quick glance around the doorjamb. What he saw set his pulsing racing again. A woman stood with a gun in her hand, pointed at the ground, a pair of black trousers and men’s black leather shoes all John could see of the victim. The woman was clad in all black and had a balaclava pulled up to her forehead.
“What terrible Saturday thing have you forgot? And have you forgot it
“No, I did not forget our anniversary, John. I just do not know what day it is
“You look good, Greg — criminal class must be treatin’ you well then.”
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, a move so well practised he'd practically worn a rut into the bone.
I have needs, John. I need you.
to give us the keys to our room so we can
“Still working at the hospital, then?” John asked, picking up the glasses from the bartender and handing Greg one of them.
“What have you done, Irene?” Mycroft asked as he angrily shoved his arms into his jacket.
“Unlikely. The force with which that bag of powder was shoved down the victim’s throat tells me that the perpetrator was most likely a male.”
“Christ, how many of these are there?” He asked with a forced laugh. He wanted to be, well, if not cheerful, but certainly not morbid, around John. This was something that he should be doing alone.
Wrapping his forearms beneath John’s knees, he push up until he was able to slam into John while stimulating his cock between them. No hands needed. They were both so horny that the slightest touch was going to set them off.
“I’ll just check your ring finger next,” John said, pulling the finger forward.
“I’ve reviewed all of the surveillance video and sent it to you right away. Haven’t you looked at it yet?” Mycroft asked, studiously ignoring Sherlock’s ‘corpse’ comment.
Just then, Sherlock’s mobile gave a text alert. Reaching down, he fished his mobile out of his suit coat and read the text in silence.
“Well,” Becca said sitting on the bed next to Sherlock. “You’re going to be really mad about this and I wanted you to start feeling calm before I told you.” She straightened up the line, peeled her gloves off and threw them in the nearby bin.
“I am NOT being emotional and this so called ‘mating instinct’ is in no way affecting my behavior. I control my emotions. They do not control me! And you know very well that passcodes and ‘exit only’ doors will do nothing to deter Moriarty from taking John WHEN he finally decides to do so.” Sherlock finished angrily.
Sherlock opened his eyes obediently and stared into those twin pools of darkness that were John Watson’s eyes.
“Closed for repairs,” John said when Sherlock attempted to snuggle him. Unable to unlock John’s arms, he rolled over to his side of the bed an promptly fell asleep.
Sherlock
“There’s a first time for everything,” John replied.
He found a small bedsit that he could barely afford on his pension and stared at his gun all day which had conveniently been sent back with him. Probably a friend had stashed it for him for which he was grateful.
“Just. Here.” Sebastian said, shoving it into her arms.
“I expect no quarter.”
“Look, Mike. Whatever it is, I don’t care. I’m broke and living on tins of whatever’s on sale. How bad can it be?”
“You’re…you’re not even going to take my clothes off?!” Sherlock asked.
“OI! Are you ok in there?” Still no answer. There wasn’t a lock on the bathroom door so John pushed it open. Or tried to. He’d barely opened it a crack before it was met with resistance. He pushed again.
“Obviously. I do have one very important heads up for you; Mycroft.”
Week One
“I wish you’d let me have my way with you, Sherlock. I know that I could satisfy you. Let me know if you change your mind,” she added before he could reject her again.
“They’ve all been different, John.”
“My pronunciation isn’t the best, and I’m probably saying these wrong but to the best of my recollection…” John began.
Sherlock backed off of the chair with shaky legs, taking a moment to catch his breath.
“No. No. That happened just recently. Doctor Watson approached me about the injuries. He was concerned that the violence was escalating and he asked to intervene before something happened that couldn’t be cured by ice and iodine. He’s a very caring individual.
“Self-flattery is for the insecure. What I’ve just told you is a fact. Nothing more, nothing less. It requires no self-flattery. Besides which, you’re already attracted to me. I could sense it as soon as we met,” Sherlock stated with what John thought was presumptuous arrogance.
John ran his hand down Sherlock’s back and, upon reaching his tense arse, pinched it between his thumb and forefinger firmly.
John received another text from unknown number.
"Close enough."
John’s mobile rang. He looked at the number, ‘unlisted’. He was about to ignore it when stopped ringing just as quickly as it had started. His mobile then pinged notifying that he’d just received a text; also from an unlisted number.
Debbie
“So you dragged me down to a disgusting pub where all the plebeians gather, to have me apologize to a person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was in fact, already injured. And another person who doesn’t even exist? Have I got that right?”
“Gee. You think?” John set the glass back on the nightstand and tried to stand up.
“Could you touch silver before you knew that you were a Dhamphir?”
“The mind boggles.”
“Who are you and by the way, the name is Doctor Watson, not…Dhamphir. Whoever or whatever that is,” John said.
“You’re the only one who knew about this. Who gave me advice. You told me that if I wanted John, I needed to change my personality. Well, I did that and he thought it was weird. Even I thought it was weird. I couldn’t have maintained all of that sexual aggression and despite his obviously stiff member, he was not interested.”
“It took a bit longer than I’d thought it would but eventually, I stumbled upon using certain words to trigger my erection, which worked well but I was still unable to achieve an orgasm untouched.”
“Yes. Must we go through this again? You fell in love with a paper man…”
‘He’s smiling. Why is he smiling? Has he met someone? Is that why he was so late tonight?’ All of these thoughts passed through Sherlock’s mind as John began the walk home, Sherlock shadowing him all the way to his front door.
“Arse.”
“Looks like you took the first job you could get, eh? Shame that the medical field seems to be picky about whom they’ll let work on their live patients,” Sherlock smiled smugly.
“Spare me your romantic notions. Just tell me; do I need to call someone else or can I count on you to help?”
“There are werewolves too?!” John said, amazed and not a little nervous.
Looking around John at Sherlock, Anderson said, “Shut it, freak. I’ll deal with you next!”
“What else do you see, Doctor Watson?” Sherlock asked, now truly curious. Maybe this Dhamphir knew what he was talking about although it was obvious from his reactions that he seemed to be unaware of the fact that he was, albeit a young one, clearly a Dhamphir. Curious.
Sherlock sat up and quickly spotted it beneath the bed. He picked it up and handed it to John.
There was no sound for five minutes other than Sherlock’s heavy breathing.
“Indeed. A couple of those were new to me.”
“Why didn’t you just call Scotland Yard and have him picked up when you were supposed to meet?” John demanded.
“Now, what were you saying, Anderson?” John asked in a low voice.
“Oh, for Pete’s sake, Sherlock, let that go. I know damn good and well that you always carry your own gloves everywhere hoping for something like this to happen.”
“I have a special request.”
“Well, it might be if I wasn’t getting so wet. Oh. I like it when you do that.” Sherlock sighed.
Week Three
“If you need anything, just call the front desk and they’ll bring it right up.” Irene said before closing the door behind her.
I was wonder if you might be available for a late lunch tomorrow. I’m afraid that it will have to be sandwiches at the coffee shop but as you’ve already proved, their food is delicious Tea last month was lovely but rushed. I would like nothing better than to sit down and spend more time with you. Will 2pm work for you?
Once John was standing he turned to walk into the morgue and the world spun on its axis; he began to fall and decided to drop back down into his chair instead.
John lay there, watching the digital clock roll over 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes.
“Let…” More kisses.
“I can’t hear you!”
“I don’t believe you,” Sherlock said, releasing Moran.
Sherlock felt a soft touch on his hip and saw that John had placed his hand there. He was in Sherlock’s personal space now and how had THAT happened? Why hadn’t he caught that?
Wednesday 8pm
“Very good. So, what have we learned?”
“Now for the most difficult part; getting you into one of the morgue drawers.”
“One told me that I was lucky that I was so amazing at sucking cock, otherwise I’d be sporting the same bruises as the others. Then they started telling me about the homeless men they’d begun beating for “fun.” After all, “who cared what happened to the homeless?”
“I wonder that myself. However, I can smell Sherlock’s scent mingled with yours so you’ve clearly exchanged blood.”
“Now, now, now. No need to be childish.”
“Let’s go over the rules before we start.”
“Did you know that the rectum is warm enough to hard boil an egg?”
Looking around, John said, “We’re in an alley. There’s no one else here but us.”
“Head down, ass in the air! Faster, dammit!” John said as Sherlock fell to his knees, folded his arms in front of him and lay his head on them.
“Third, half, whatever. Either way it’s going to hurt when I begin cutting and I’d prefer it if you weren’t wiggling about while I’m working.”
“Yes, John. And neither one of us like to leave a job unfinished,” Sherlock said, pointing his index fingers to his own now hard cock.
“Not particularly,” John answered guilelessly
“What was that?” John asked.
“No. I want you to personally lick it up as a favor to me. You wouldn’t want to disappoint me, would you?”
“Here. Let’s get closer.” John said, grabbing Sherlock’s hand and practically dragging him behind the falls.
It wasn’t that he was adverse to it, exactly, but he’d definitely want a little warning first. John put that topic completely out of his mind and began licking and sucking Sherlock’s cock again.
Many members of this group weren’t actually gay - or so they told themselves - and mainly went to be seen and get a blowjob under the ‘all cats are grey in the dark’ system as well as maintaining their ‘cover.’ Sherlock despised posers so the victims had already started out with one strike against them.
“Sorry. Do carry on.”
“And he’s walking around with an umbrella on a perfectly clear night. You ask me, there’s something wrong with him.”
He’d known the other two scents instantly - certainly morphine was a no brainer - but he had no idea what the lidocaine had used been for. Sherlock dropped everything back into the bin and picked up a piece of blood soaked gauze and sniffed. Definitely John’s blood. A lot of John’s blood. Had he been injured trying to escape?
With affection,
“No. That’s ok. I’m in a lot of pain and I really don’t feel like any visitors. I’ll see you when it’s time to get home. You need to be there to take care of dad and Harriet anyway.”
“Must you be so…energetic?” Mycroft sighed again.
“Use your words, Sherlock,” John said licking a finger and sliding it between those taught cheeks.
“It’s true. I saw the pee stick myself. He’s pregnant and here’s what else I found out: he doesn’t even know who the father is!” Harry waited for the explosion and wasn’t disappointed.
First Month of Courtship
Sherlock snorted, which Mycroft ignored.
P. S. Don’t tell Sherlock. I don’t think he’d believe you and he’s too delicate at the moment for me to show myself to him. Love you both.
“Please, John. Fuck me with your fist. I want it. I need it. OOH! FUCK!!” Sherlock suddenly exclaimed as John unceremoniously thrust his fist into Sherlock’s rectum.
“That’s good! It’s not that I don’t appreciate all the trouble that you went through to pick these up…” John began.
Putting his hand up John said, “Don’t say a word. Just get over here and help me up, you lanky git.
Wednesday
“Sherlock? Aren’t you feeling well?” John asked.
Moriarty’s…’Safe House’
“How do you know she didn’t suffer?! You weren’t here! I wasn’t here! I should have been here. I knew that she was old. She wasn’t going to last forever. I should have known.” Sherlock said, placing his head in his hands and beginning to sob quietly. John’s heart was breaking for him and he didn’t know what to do about it. It was different when Sherlock had “died.” He’d committed “suicide” in front of John but he’d come back, eventually. Mrs Hudson wasn’t coming back. Sherlock had been in despair. Obviously the suicide was faked but the despair was real. John heard it in his voice that day. Sherlock hadn’t even been 34 when he’d jumped. John still had nightmares about it.
“That’ll do for a start.” John smiled.
“What? He’ll be fed here. He won’t go hungry, will he, doc?”
“Hello, Mycroft? I know where Doctor Watson is although I’d recommend an ambulance to pick him up. I seriously doubt he’s capable of walking on his own. And before you ask; no I wasn’t “in on it.” Might want to check on Sherlock too while you’re at it.”
“What if I figure it out? Could I try it then?” John asked with excitement.
“No. And they don’t need to know. They won’t even miss me for the first five days. They’ll just think that I’m out whoring around again now that I can’t get pregnant. Either way, it’ll be a relief to us all when I disappear. No fuss, no muss. No pretend caring scenes with the associated crocodile tears. I couldn’t stand that so that’s why I brought my kit to this appointment. I don’t have much in the way of belongings so it was easy to pack. Everything I need is right here in this duffel bag.”
They were both startled by the sound of a door slamming following by rapidly retreating footsteps down the stairs and another slam of 221B's front door.
John pushed Sherlock’s hands behind his head entwining their fingers while he rubbed against Sherlock’s cock, peppering him with kisses. He licked Sherlock’s nipple on each upthrust until Sherlock was panting for it.
“In the box with the rest of the stuff. Why, Sherlock?” John asked, eyes narrowed.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied following that up with some whispered words that John couldn’t quite make out.
I leaned my head against his back and waited for my heart to slow down. This was the most energy spent on the least amount of activity that I'd ever done and I was exhausted.
John paused in the act of pulling on his jumper. Poking his head through, he asked;
“But your fingers are ok?”
“Yes, Jim,” Seb said dutifully before checking the street for bystanders. It was after 1am and the pubs were still open so the streets were empty.
“I’d like to go home.”
“Of course. Hard to get respect from the troops when everyone is on a first name basis with their commanding officer, John,” Sebastian said with a laugh that lasted a little longer than John thought the comment warranted but that was one of the things that John really liked about Sebastian. He was always in such a good mood. Never had a bad word to say about anyone. Their evening chats always picked him up and he was glad that they’d met and become friends.
"Sure we will," John said, slowly fucking Sherlock.
Since the pub was only a few blocks away from St Bart’s, John had walked there with Mike Stamford rather than hire a taxi.
Placing his hands on Sherlock’s hips, he pulled Sherlock back onto his cock after every withdrawal. So warm, so tight. John knew that he probably wouldn’t last long considering how hard he’d been through Sherlock’s ‘experiment’ but that was ok. He’s have him again later at a more leisurely, and lengthy, pace. Right now though? He just wanted to come as soon as possible. He’d save the finesse for later.
“My dear Doctor Watson, it means everything. My brother desires someone for the first time in his life and I’m going to make sure he gets what he wants and what he wants is you.” Mycroft finished.
“He might be empty by the time you get back and you know how unhappy I’ll be then, don’t you, Seb.” This wasn’t a question and Moran didn’t treat it as such, merely nodded his head as he walked to the counter to prepare the injection. This might just push Watson over the edge but there was nothing for it. When Jim was like this, he wouldn’t be denied.
The man called out of the car to him;
“I don’t…this is all that’s left. Possessions that now mean nothing. Who’s going to want all of this stuff? It’s all just going to get thrown away. Everything she collected through the years. Everything she loved. All wasted.” Sherlock’s breath caught and held, it came out in a whoosh only to be sucked quickly back in. He was on the verge of hyperventilating. John needed to stop this before it got out of control.
“Sherlock IS my business and don’t call him a freak.”
John leaned down and placed a kiss at the head of Sherlock’s cock and then straightened up and began removing his jacket.
“Did you have your iPad hidden in there?! Get your arse out of there right now!”
“Sounds like a domestic. We should go,” Mycroft said.
“He threatened to kill you, John. If I don’t give you up to be with him, he’ll kill you. He means it, John. I’ve just found you and I’m not giving you up for anyone or anything.”
Just then there was another knock at the door.
“What did he do now?” Answered a sleepy yet somehow still sexy voice with no preamble.
“Yeah but there’s always something else to do. I’m just done in tonight. It’ll still be here in the morning and I don’t have anything critical going on at the moment so, yeah, I’m going to leave on time for once,” John said with a laugh.
“JOHN!”
“You’re being deliberately obtuse. You know perfectly well what I meant,” Sherlock snapped. He was standing there, a bed in plain sight, with a hard cock asking questions. He had to get back on track.
“Sherlock, murder?” Lestrade prompted.
Checking her watch, Irene said, “It’s half nine, let me take you up to meet Doctor Watson.”
“The only difference is that I had sugar put into yours but we both got an extra shot of espresso. Let me just get you some sugar from the break room. There are always loads of packets in there. That way we won’t have to switch. Sound good?” Sebastian asked.
John just sat, staring at Sherlock impassively.
“Can I leap off of tall buildings in a single bound?” John asked eagerly.
“That’s nothing compared to what I’m going to do to him! I’m going to beat that bastard right out of him!”
“Hello Sherlock. What brings you here at this time of night?” He hadn’t even turned around to see who was coming in. He’d just ‘known.’ Weird.
“And pulling your hair.”
Life was good. Life was very, very good.
10 Months Later
“Oh, Sherlock. Why do you torture yourself this way?” John said under his breath followed by a hiccuping sigh. He didn’t want to follow Sherlock. Mrs Hudson had only been gone for a few days. He wasn’t ready to accept that she was gone. He wasn’t ready to let it sink in. He knew it was silly but he felt as if he didn’t enter her flat, she might still be there, fussing about, making a casserole for “the boys” because she just “happened to have extra ingredients” that would “only go to waste if they didn’t eat them.” They all knew that she was just trying to get Sherlock to eat and so they took the casseroles, biscuits, cakes, whatever she’d made “too much of” and brought it to the flat to nibble on. Eventually it would be gone without them realizing it.
“You've finally said something interesting. Tell me more about this James Moriarty and how he's even heard of me."
“You’ve hurt yourself.”
“My poor baby. You’ll be mad when you wake up but you’ll be glad too. Interesting choice Mycroft picked for keeping you out of the way. The good news is that it will be as if no time has passed at all. The bad news is that you’ll have lost at least two days. Don’t worry, pumpkin. I’ll see that everything’s right for you and Doctor Watson.” Becca leaned over Sherlock and brushing his curls back, gave him a chaste kiss on the forehead.
“You don’t look so good, mate. What happened to you?” Sally asked.
“It gets better, I promise you that. It does get better.” John said, beginning to rock Sherlock as you would to calm down an hysterical child.
Sherlock gave John an annoyed looked but continued with what John considered a load of bollocks by a clearly disturbed man.
“John…this is highly inappropriate. Let’s get back to the murders.”
“Yes! Fuck me with your finger, John!!”
Sherlock puffed up a bit at that, “Yes. Yes I am and I could really use your help dealing with the imbeciles I’m surrounded by during a case.”
“How much work could he possibly have that he couldn’t leave before 2am?!’ He’d have a word with Mycroft about the hospital overworking his mate!
Sherlock looked up through his curls and said, “Are you sure, John? I hate to beat a dead horse but I had stroke of genius and finally discovered what I was missing. I’ve had the experiment in hand ever since,” Sherlock said, a slight quirk to his lips.
“To get my medical kit, where do you think?”
“That, I seriously doubt can be arranged without a copious amount of drugs and alcohol. Time to call Mycroft. I’ll be ready and waiting when you get here.” Irene said and Becca could hear the smile in her voice.
Mycroft used a number that he had on speed dial.
When he reached the landing in front of 221B, he held one hand on the doorknob and leaned his head against the door in exhaustion.
Four men had been found murdered in as many weeks; throats torn out and almost completely drained of blood. While draining a body of blood was a bit…unusual, it had occurred before so it wasn’t unheard of. However, the difference here was the fact that the victims appeared to have been killed in situ - it wasn’t a body dump. That and each victim had died with a distinctly happy, almost post-coital smile on their face.
“You know what else?”
There was silence for about 15 seconds then screams and curses belonging to Anderson, exploded from the alleyway.
She went digging around in the chair she’d been sitting in and Valley of the Dolls was right where she’d left it.
“Sherlock?”
“I’ll be there in 20. That’s the best I can do so I suggest you keep him warm and alive while you’re waiting for me. Oh. I’m assuming that you have blood and a blood warmer.”
“Forever,” Sherlock replied.
“This stupid cunt’s gone and gotten himself knocked up!” Harry screamed, foot still on John’s stomach.
“Wrong answer. Try again, unless you want to go for eighty.” John squeezed the other cheek harshly causing Sherlock to cry out.
“Said not interested.”
Silence, then;
He slipped off his shoes and quietly hung his coat on the rack making no sudden movements. Sherlock seemed perfectly engrossed in whatever he was looking at so John thought that his chances were slightly higher than usual that he’d be able to make it to their bedroom without attracting his attention. With any luck, Sherlock was visiting his Mind Palace and wouldn’t notice anything.
“Alright,” Sherlock replied softly. “Mycroft, they left his coat hanging on the wall, his mobile and house keys still in the pockets. John would never have willingly left without any of those things.”
“Um…I don’t know what you had planned but I can assure you that I’m not interested. Not that you’re not an attractive man but I’m not gay,” John said.
Sherlock gave John a look that said he was interested in John’s reaction to all of this information but in a clinical, impersonal way which made it seem worse to John. As if he was a project.
“Ah! Much better. How are you feeling, Sherlock?” Becca asked.
“Alive. I promise.”
“So, back to Dhamphirs. A Dhamphir is created when a male vampire has sex with a human female - victim’s willingness not necessary - this almost always results in a pregnancy that normally causes the death of the mother during the birth of the baby which is a human/vampire hybrid.”
Pumping a generous amount into my hand, ran first one then two fingers down his crack, sliding them easily into his rectum.
“Not.” John said and then caved when Sherlock gave him the most adorable puppy eyes ever.
“Yes. I feel lucky.”
“Well, lovely meeting you and try not to mind Sherlock. He doesn’t mean to be rude. It’s just a sign of his brilliance. He doesn’t suffer fools gladly. You’d better get going or he’ll leave without you.”
“Yes. He’s the main lead in the recent spate of murders. All four men had been customers…”
After that, they continued on in silence; Mycroft annoyed, and John worried.
“But it’s not like I can’t stay in the medical field. I wouldn’t know what else to do anyhow. It’s just…well…my days as a surgeon are over, you know?” John finished lamely.
Sherlock shoved the mobile back into his jacket and carried on his way, never losing sight of John.
“On what?” John laughed. He’d never met anyone this resistant to his charms.
“Do really think so?” Moriarty asked, frowning down at a very pale John.
“So…’pila’, you say?” He glanced over at Sherlock. Yep. That’s the trigger. He’d now wrapped his coat around himself and had his shoulders hunched up around his neck looking decidedly uncomfortable.
"Whatttt..." I gulped. "What are you doing, Sherlock?"
“John…” *kiss*
“Your stalking skills don’t seem to be up to snuff, brother mine.
“Moriarty, stop this right now. It not only makes you look juvenile but it’s drawing unnecessary attention to us,” Sherlock said, annoyed.
“Yeah. Sherlock said that. When they met for coffee the other night, Moriarty could smell me on him. We hadn’t even exchanged blood at that point.”
“Better?” Sebastian asked.
“I won’t have your nonsense interfering with my work,” John said, tightening his grip on Sherlock’s arm and wrenching it higher behind his back. This didn’t seem to impress the man one bit because the next thing John knew, they’d switched places with John’s arm twisted behind his back in a position similar to the one he’d just had Sherlock in.
Sergeant Mark Mulvey looked over at the men working on Niall and Captain Watson. He had a good feeling about Niall. He’d be back. Captain Watson, though. That was a career ending injury if ever he saw one, and the military was his life. He hoped that the Captain had family that would take care of him while he was healing. John had never spoken of them before. Mark thought that his parents were both dead but he might have a sister…god, he hoped so. He was going to need the support.
“I’ll be fine. Neither one of us anticipated this kind of reaction. I just wish I had a place to lay down for a few minutes so that I could elevate my feet above my head,” John said, pressing a fist into his breastbone, no longer even attempting to hide the pain.
“Blue balls,” John said under his breath.
“You’re right. Maybe I could use some help. Doctors make the worst patients,” John grimaced.
I really wanted this to be a lot shorter but it wouldn't end. I have an entire spare chapter of nonsense that I'm not posting. I know that the ending drags well past where it should have ended but I finally gave up cutting things out and posted what was left.
As soon as they were out of view of Lestrade and Sherlock, Anderson swung around with a cheap shot, punching John in his injured shoulder full force expecting him to drop to the ground, instead, he just stood there, looking eerily calm and still smiling.
He was getting so bored waiting around like this. At first he was so exhausted, so relieved and anxious all at once, it had numbed him.
“The work that you’ve done is going to be quite prolific, I do hope you know. I have granted you a very exciting death Johnny. You have to admit that’s what you wanted. Why you were hesitant to end things before. Being shot, self-inflicted or otherwise is soo bor-ing,” Moriarty sang. “But this, Johnny-boy is an awfully exciting way to die, don’t you think? To be tortured and sunk to the bottom of the Thames after having fled from your guilt over having taken part in some of the most disturbing serial murders London has ever seen. That’s beyond interesting.”
“I’ve got to go,” John murmured, snatching the phone from Sherlock, clicking the phones screen off abruptly, and shoving it in his pocket.
“What?” John grumbled, rubbing his eyes and sitting up.
“I’m supposed to kill you,” John tried to keep his voice steady, to varying degrees of success.
John still said nothing. Sherlock was stronger than that. He didn’t need John and there would be other criminal masterminds. He wasn’t worried about what would happen to Sherlock after he was gone. Mycroft and Lestrade would look out for him, so would Molly and Ms. Hudson. Sherlock had other people that he cared about and who cared about him, even if he was hesitant to admit it. Sherlock would be just fine. He had to be.
“I don’t know, times are changing. I think the demand for a whatever-you-are-sexual who becomes some sort of mastermind vigilante in order to protect his sexy same sex lover is through the roof right now.”
Lestrade and Mycroft shared a relieved glance, although they still had far too much pity in their eyes for Sherlock’s liking.
He was met with more silence as both Sherlock and Lestrade stared at him in shock from his outburst.
“Well, I’m not, Johnny-boy. I still have some praises left to sing you, don’t I? I’m sorry about…that, by the way,” Moriarty gestured to John’s entire body, which probably looked a wreck. “I was just a bit, hm, overcome. That’s done now, though. What do you say, Johnny? Can we start again?”
“John? Are you feeling better?” A woman handed him a cup of ice chips.
Sherlock had his phone out and was typing away furiously.
The headline, as far as UK tabloid headlines go, was not even bad enough to be good.
Things would be fine one moment, they would be talking or laughing or kissing or shagging and then suddenly John would seem to go somewhere else, and Sherlock couldn’t figure out exactly where that place was.
John quickly moved to point his weapon at Mary, fighting every distress signal his body was sending to steadily aim the gun at Mary’s head, Mary pointed her weapon right back at him. Moran could easily take her out, he could have any time, but Moriarty had told John to kill them. Moran was only still there as insurance, in case John betrayed him.
“Either you’re far better than even I ever gave you credit for, Johnny, or I was trusting entirely the wrong people,” Moriarty mused as he swung himself around John so that he now stood in front of him. He stood farther away now, but his fingers still reached out to trace along John’s scars.
He slid quietly into the building that the woman had gone into when suddenly someone grabbed him from behind. Sherlock immediately struggled, but stopped when a familiar voice spoke to him.
John felt his heart stop when the proposition was finally made so plainly. Even in his drugged up brain, a part of him knew that this was what they meant when they asked for his help. But suddenly hearing it was too much.
“I’ll never let him hurt us,” he heard Sherlock repeat.
Ms. Hudson heard the vacuum running she came running up the stairs like Sherlock was using it to strangle himself.
“That’s what I worry about, Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “I fear that John may have run out of use, and that he may dispose of John, just as he had John and his partner disposed of the body that you saw.”
John had made his way to the boat. It was a narrowboat that had at one point been converted into a houseboat, but the charming wooden boat seemed to have been beaten down by the metallic industry of Canary Wharf. Chipped paint and splintering wood, stuffed into a small corner of dock space in the shadow or a luxury apartment complex, the boat looked ready to capsize at any moment. It's windows had been blacked out with paper, making the boat all the more ominous.
“I let him down,” he choked.
John said coldly. He didn’t want to sound afraid. He was a soldier,he was trained for situations like this. But his mind was racing as he tried to piece together what was going on.
“You, Sherlock. He told me that you’d
John stared at the other man with a look of horror and confusion. He didn’t have any idea where the other man was going with this, but wherever it was, it couldn’t be good.
Once he had his hand wrapped around Sherlock, he realized he did not know how to make his touch have as much finesse as Sherlock’s seemed to. But as he felt his orgasm begin to build, he realized that he had no time to be delicate if he wanted to have any chance of getting Sherlock off. He began to tug frantically on Sherlock’s cock. He worried that he wasn’t going to be able to make Sherlock feel as good as he was making him feel and that he should have left him to the rutting, since jerking Sherlock off with this level of ferocity and deftlessness was probably just as juvenile as dry humping, but then Sherlock began making the most wonderful noises.
Moriarty laughed.
but instead he said nothing. He couldn’t make anything come out of his mouth. Everything had gone so horribly wrong.
you are,” Moriarty whispered, now dragging his finger through the blood that oozed from the wound on John’s face. He suddenly disappeared behind John and John tensed, know that whatever was going to come next couldn’t be good.
Sherlock watched Moriarty in horror, trying to deduce the man, make sense of what he was saying. The more he looked at the criminal mastermind, though, the more he realized that something was entirely off about him. Far much more so than the last time they had met.
He was just so tired.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice rang out through the flat, just to be sure.
Irene Adler was certainly an interesting character, John had discovered while he’d learned more and more about the self-proclaimed dominatrix. And while John tried not to let his mind think of himself and Sherlock as a
“Ah, there it is,” Moriarty murmured once the left side of John’s jaw was uncovered revealing the long scar, now surely glaring red and inflamed. Moriarty continued, making quick work of the other half of John’s face, removing what had taken months to grow in under a half an hour.
And then, as if an apparition, Mycroft appeared at the end of the hallway.
to understand Michael Huxley and everything that was going on. He flung open the door to a bedroom at the back of the flat at the end of the short hallway.
“Wait Sherlock, I haven’t finished. None of them are surgeons.” Sherlock ignored Lestrade and crouched quietly for a few minutes. Then his eyes widened with a sudden realization and he flung himself up from the chair again continued to wear down the rug.
He could tell how pathetic he looked when he finally dared to look up to see Moriarty grinning at him.
“I think you’ve been pretending that you’re some super spy who doesn’t have a libido that she can’t take care of herself for far too long now and you need to get laid before I find that instead of strategy plans and mission reports on your laptop like there should be there’s a manuscript of an erotic novel starring James Wilson and Sherman Hoyle.”
But Mary now knew at this point not to bother arguing with John anymore about concerns for his safety. All those months ago there was a sense that she needed to protect John, from himself and the world. But now John was more or less the most feared man in the world among certain circles, and was virtually unrecognizable. Skin tanned and hair bleached lighter than it had even been in the UK from the sun of warmer climates, beard still intact with rather shaggy hair that while he couldn’t bear the feeling of growing much past his ears he hadn’t had time to otherwise keep up, and a muscular build to match months upon months of what had seemed to be near constant hand to hand combat, wall scaling, and parkour level chases that made him appear much bigger than he used to, even without any added height. John was now, mentally and physically, a very different man.
“And what, risk Sherlock tailing him to the airport to see him meet up with his dead ex-boyfriend? No, it’s a good distraction for Sherlock. In fact, as far as Sherlock’s awareness of any of the Peacemaking business, since as you know the Yard is definitely aware of, Sherlock is determined that Vic is involved. So it’s therefore pertinent that he isn’t.”
John laughed.
That was the question that Sherlock’s mind had kept coming back to all night. But an answer never presented itself to him and he really didn’t want to think about it. It didn’t matter who it was. It could have been anyone. John was likable, he could have met someone at any time, at the shop, or maybe a patient at work. Maybe he'd just accidentally bumped into someone on the street and said something charming and let it slip that he was both a doctor
Before Sherlock stood none other than John Watson.
Did that mean that Moriarty didn’t even view Sherlock as an enemy anymore? Perhaps he didn’t send the video to Sherlock to lure him in, but rather just to break John? But that couldn’t be right, Sherlock was still a genius. He was still at the end of the day Moriarty’s biggest threat. John had only ever just been a primer. It was always Sherlock’s job to destroy Moriarty. John wasn’t suited for the job he'd become the muscle, more than he ever should have been able to, but Sherlock was the brains.
“Okay, I know a little café a couple blocks west down past the aquarium.”
John couldn’t have stopped the wail of absolute agony and surprise that spilled out of his mouth even if he’d wanted to.
“I’m really sorry about this mate,” Victor’s voice whispered into his ear, before pressure of Victor’s arms around neck and to the back of his head sharply increased and the world went black.
Sherlock had liked to refer to what they did as a game, but this wasn’t a game at all.
“Personally, I’m the kind of man who likes to pull out teeth or finger nails, or maybe even skip right to cutting off entire fingers. But boss said I couldn’t dismember you in any way, fuck if I know why. so I’ve brought something else to play with."
John ground his teeth, the way Sherlock kept saying his name, almost like it was a curse word, was setting him on edge.
involved.
The door to the flat was opened, and in walked Victor Trevor.
“Well, I assume that since you’ve likely already done autopsies on the two other bodies, you tell me. Are his teeth still in his skull under the skin, or were they removed as well? They’re removed aren’t they?” Sherlock was getting a bit giddy again. “Of course they’re removed, dental records are a reasonable way of identifying remains and show traces of a persons lifestyle and priorities,” Sherlock turned to glare at Anderson. “Are his eyes still in there, as well? And how was original the skin of his face removed?” Sherlock was flying around the body, trying to find answers on the blank canvas. “And of course, how did he die? Was it poison? I love poisonings. No one ever commits a good poisoning anymore, and I don’t know why not. Although the statistics don’t report it, I believe poison is likely the best way to get away with murder, assuming you don’t have any attachments to your victim. But the only people who ever seem to poison people anymore are parents or carers of children, the disabled, or the elderly, usually to collect life insurance. But I bet he was poisoned with something nearly undetectable, right?” Sherlock spoke excitedly.
“Johnny? I didn’t think John was the kind of man to stand for such a demeaning nickname,” Lestrade said, once again being unhelpful.
He turned right and immediately smacked into something or someone.
He had known of course that he was closer to Sherlock than he’d been in a long time, but he thought he was talking in terms of at least a few miles. Not a few meters.
“If they made us into a movie, which they won’t, since you know, we’re so secret that there isn’t even anything to classify, they’d write us as tortured lovers. The guy playing me would fuck the girl playing you probably obscenely in some place where people ought not to fuck.”
“Good boy, Johnny,” Moriarty praised. A fire quickly rose back up within John and he growled.
“No, I refuse to accept that. We don't have time to wait around. I'm not going to sit here and do nothing. What do we need to take them down anyway? What was the plan? You don’t take an entire gang down on tax evasion charges. No one in their right mind would go through that inquiry if they wanted to live. What were you planning, trying to pick them off one at a time by making sure they were arrested for petty crimes?”
He would be nearly deformed, by the time he healed, the skin of his back would be rough and constantly inflamed looking. The cut on his jaw might fade in a couple years if he was lucky, but his age wasn’t exactly on his side when it came to that sort of healing anymore. He’d have a dimple of scar tissue in his side, but it would be irrelevant to his marred face and back. His chest might heal scar free, assuming the wounds didn’t become massively infected, but he'd probably be left with faint marks. He guessed he should be thankful that Moriarty hadn't given Moran free reign to start amputating limbs. He should be thankful that all things considering it wasn't that bad. He knew that similar injuries could keep people hospitalized for at least a month, and if things continued on as they were currently he'd be out by the beginning of the next week. But he felt like a monster. He deserved it after all he'd done.
John could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, calculating. Trying to find an answer. After a silence that felt like an eternity, Sherlock spoke.
He was alone.
, Sherlock’s mind supplied, making the connection. “I don’t have time to argue about this anymore. I don’t doubt that this time Moriarty’s not going to have the same rules he did last time about permanent damage. Are you coming or not?”
, John thought he heard Sherlock’s voice whisper in his ear as the water rose. Soon it was up to his chest, then his neck. John gulped in a breath of air right before it covered his mouth.
He took a second to look around him more carefully. He was in a private hospital room. An IV was attached to his arm. He followed the tubes to their source. Blood. Saline. Morphine.
, could have possibly been enough for you?”
He wished that he could still have that life. That life where he and Sherlock thought that they were all but invincible. They may not have had any time together as more than friend’s pre-Moriarty, but even before that moment so long ago now when Sherlock had kissed him in the park, there was always that unspoken fondness, dare he even think maybe a kind of love, between them.
Sherlock was surprised however to find that the place he met Victor at was relatively quiet. The after work rush that left every pub in London overflowing onto the sidewalks had died down. The pub, tucked away down by Embankment, had the kind of atmosphere that made Sherlock’s bespoke suit look not out of place, but was also laid back enough for Trevor with his dark jeans, rumpled cotton button down, and trainers. The pub had a decent view of the river and skyline on the south side of the river, and tables by the windows were all occupied, but Sherlock and Trevor had occupied a small booth in the back corner of the pub and more or less had their privacy. Trevor had ordered a bottle of wine for them to split. It was relatively cheap, part of some offer the pub was running, but palatable, and Sherlock deigned to sip at his glass.
John boarded the boat and headed inside, quickly making his way down the short stairway that lead down into the body of the boat.
“My friend has a background in military, that doesn’t mean he’s taking down some of the city’s best criminal’s right under your nose. And come on, ‘The Peacemaker’ hasn’t stolen any cases from you in months.”
John collapsed onto the sofa, groaning. “All I said was that I was here to make peace. It’s a perfectly reasonable thing to say,” he muttered.
“So, Holmes, you’ve been solving crimes with the police? Good for you mate,” Victor grinned at him before stuffing another forkful of pie into his mouth. “Funny we keep running into each other after not seeing each other in what, a dozen years? What are the chances?”
“You’re going to do it for me.”
"Why can't I tell him myself."
“Watson, I know you’re awake. Ready for round two, soldier?” at Moran’s voice John took the opportunity to let out a groan that he’d been holding in and he snapped open his eyes.
After a few more slow minutes, he finally slowly stood up. His whole body ached in protest. He carefully fingered the gun in his lap, shifting it carefully into the waistband of his trousers. Then he slowly made to turn around, but the twisting movement required of his torso was too much, and something inside him stabbed something else. He gasped and fought against collapsing, but struggled to maintain his footing. He began to fall forwards when arms wrapped around him and pulled him back to his feet.
“Excuse me?” John sputtered.
“John, I think we may have both been very dishonest with each other recently and it has put up a barrier in our relationship that I think is crucial we tear down in order to be able to move on with the Moriarty case.”
“What, you don’t know, you’ve been rather amiable drinking buddies recently!” Sherlock growled, wondering who else had been lying to him.
“It was nothing. Just threatened me a bit. It didn’t seem relevant. I had hoped if I ignored it, I would be fine,” John admitted hesitantly.
“Vic,” John muttered, trying to look around him. His head flopped to the side and saw Mary leaning over a body, fingers checking for a pulse. Whose body was it again? John couldn’t remember. What was going on? Everything seemed too heavy, his vision seemed to be fading. He looked back up to the man kneeling over him.
And for a second a far too large part of him expected to see John sitting there, like it was the only possible reality just because he'd been able to imagine it.
Moriarty was laughing again.
“It’s okay John. Sherlock is fine. And you’re going to be fine. And we’re going to fix everything. Do you want to fix things John?”
Silence fell between them as they stared at each other.
He’d given up finding it at night, heading out to those parts of town where he knew he could get what he wanted at any hour, but Mrs. Hudson would snag him before he could make his way out of 221, demanding tea. Or he’d get a text from Lestrade claiming he was needed down at the Yard, but upon Sherlock’s eager arrival, was only handed him a stack of paperwork that needed Sherlock’s signature. He nearly got halfway across town to his destination once before a black car showed up, Mycroft tucked inside with a knowing look on his face, but thankfully he did not voice any suspicions he may have had.
“You’re going to kill them, Johnny. If you don’t, Seb will kill all of you. But I hope that you choose to save yourself and join me.”
It nearly killed him, every single time he had remembered this the past two weeks that he had been with Sherlock.
And if Sherlock had the faintest clues what that thing was, he’d have been bouncing off the walls with glee. But he
Sherlock pulled his mobile out of his pocket and dialed the number of the surgery. He hated talking on the phone, but he was not going to give this little errand the importance of going down the surgery in person, and the matter was far too pressing to wait for an email to be answered.
Mary had agreed to let him out for a walk.
A twisted smile contorted Moriarty’s face and somewhere in the distance, a gunshot rang out.
“Moriarty may be a criminal mastermind, but mostly he’s an actor. Always loved the theatrics. All he needs is to be outperformed,” John said cryptically. “Do you trust me?”
“Don’t worry, our guy has arranged for us to receive a whole bunch of fun tech and shit once we’ve crossed the channel. You’ll have bigger guns and more tear gas and smoke bombs then you’ll know what to do with,” John suppressed a groan. With the amount of times he’d managed an escape through a cloud of smoke as a distraction it was amazing that they weren’t calling him The Magician. Which would have been infinitely worse than the already ridiculous Peacemaker, so he was bloody pleased they weren't. “Plus I am an excellent long range shooter and can hack CCTV feeds better than that little tech nerd of Moriarty’s could ever dream to, so I’ve got your back just fine.”
Moriarty was scrambling to regain control after very possibly for the first time experiencing a loss of it. In times like these, Sherlock turned to crack, but Moriarty simply had cracked.
On the sixth day Sherlock slept.
“That’s really only a last resort John. We are trying not to become criminals ourselves any more than necessary,” Mary explained.
On the ninth day, he paced. Paced back and forth through the apartment all day.
He eventually found Mornington Crescent and got himself on a train on the Northern line going south. He needed to be in Canary Wharf, probably an hour ago. The messages he'd received had actually been sent right after he'd turned off his phone. The train seemed to take ages, and John grew increasingly antsy. He wasn’t supposed to be needed until tomorrow night. Nothing good could possibly come out of the fact that he was being summoned spontaneously.
Sherlock’s mind began to spin. How had he been so foolish? How had he let his judgement become so clouded? Where had John gone yesterday? How long has he been missing? Sherlock tried to remember, tried to remember everything about John that would possibly help him understand. He remembered John knowing that the victims had been shot. He remembered the disgust in John’s voice as he described the procedure. He remembered John’s hesitance to go to the crime scene, in fact, his absolute refusal.
“But what if that’s the point?”
He was alive. But something wasn’t right. Instead of the London skyline it was dark. Not even night dark, just pitch black. The water had a faint shimmer to it, reflecting light from somewhere, but otherwise John might as well have been blind. He reached up and his hands hit something hard and smooth just a foot above his head. He frantically pushed himself forward and found himself bouncing off a wall. It was like he was in a box.
“Let your
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, trying to shake himself out of it. “It’s fine.”
“Anywhere on the torso is probably your best bet,” John told him matter-of-factly.
Sherlock’s mind wrapped around that detail and began to ground itself. It felt less like his mind palace had been caught up in a tornado, and Sherlock began to take inventory. Moriarty? Or the man who was making London's most wanted list turn themselves in?
Sherlock remained quiet, as it seemed like the best thing to do, while Moriarty began to tell his tale, like he was telling a story to a child.
Mary shrugged but tilted her head in acknowledgment of the truth to John’s point.
“Oh, brother mine, do you really believe that?” Mycroft asked.
“I’m observing.”
He felt like he was going through withdrawal. He spent the day lying on the sofa, groaning in agony or frustration, he didn't know. But he needed something.
“I’m not a big fan of getting my hands dirty, which is why Sebby’s still here. But I do want, in case they manage to fish your body out of the river, and I hope they do, for Sherlock to know that I’ve left my mark on you.” Moriarty approached John with a switch blade in his hand.
“You cut off their faces, John.” Moriarty’s voice was rough, coming from deep within his throat. The blade stopped dancing along John’s jaw then, and cut deep into the skin at the corner of his ear. John screwed his eyes shut and held his breath while Moriarty cut along John’s jaw, stopping at the corner of his chin.
And with that he slid out the door.
And now, particularly after what had happened, he and Sherlock very definitively could never and would never, ever, be anything more, because of the thing he couldn’t think about.
“I’m beginning to worry you’re becoming your sister, John. You’ve gone out more nights in the past week than you haven’t,” Sherlock grumbled, not entirely sure if John could understand him since he was speaking mostly into a cushion. It wasn’t even exactly true, of course, but Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to be fair anymore. John was only going out two nights a week, but he usually coupled them with days he was working at the surgery, meaning he’d go straight from work to the pub, and Sherlock wouldn’t see him all day.
But he of course didn’t feel like he owned the world. He felt tired. But he couldn’t bear to lie around the flat, so instead he was wandering the streets of London rather aimlessly.
“There was a new study recently in which donor skin was taken from donors who have passed, as you would for most other organ donations. The process allows them to take more than what had been taken in full-thickness grafts previously, taking the full dermis, but also the layers of tissue in the reticular region and part of the hypodermis. The process was tested specifically as an effort to create more aesthetically pleasing grafts. The process received a lot of criticism, because as far as limiting the chance of complication and ease of recovery, research into skin gun technology is probably a better use of research.
“I’d never let you get bored again, darling. I’m like Sherlock, but better. None of that silly human stuff to mess everything up, right? You don’t think you can ever go back to the way things were with him, even if you walked out of here and I fired a bullet into Seb’s and then my own brain and ended it all. Because you
Sherlock noted how different John looked, while still all the same.
Moran pulled back before jabbing the knife into John, and left it there. Well at least he wouldn't get the joy of quickly bleeding out, although the wound was still beginning to bleed furiously around he knife.
?” John stood up and began to pace as Sherlock was. “You do realize that, don’t you? You don’t have friends,
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked over at John. John stood across the body from him and was staring very intensely at his shoes and looked frustrated and uncomfortable.
Sherlock wasn’t sure if the last sentence was supposed to be reassuring, but it was hissed with so much determination that for a second Sherlock believed him. But then Sherlock remembered that their entire relationship was a lie. They were just fucking, weren’t they? John had been using him. How had Sherlock gotten it so wrong? How had he gotten everything so wrong?
And so he’d told John, and things had escalated quickly.
“Brilliant,” Victor grinned. “Well then, let’s get to work.”
“We’ll deal with him when we need to, right now we need to go.”
So Sherlock did the only thing he could think to do, which was to make sure that John was never alone, never without protection. John could hold his own in a fight, Sherlock knew that of course, but clearly Moriarty’s men were good. They worked hard to make sure their presence wasn’t known and would be willing to sneak up from behind. They didn’t feel the need to show off their strength, to dominate their victim. They just did their job, and they did it well. And John didn’t stand a chance, no matter how vigilant he was.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked.
And on top of everything else, Michael Huxley, despite Roger’s surrender, was still missing. And Roger’s claimed to have nothing to do with the kid, although he had spat out the young former hackers name with disdain.
“But—,” Sherlock tried but Lestrade cut him off.
John said nothing. After a few moments he sighed.
,” John moaned, tipping his head back to give Sherlock better access to his neck. Unfortunately though, Sherlock’s lips left his neck as he moved to stand up, grabbing John’s hand and pulling him up after him.
Sherlock approached the body, feeling John and Lestrade hesitantly follow a step behind him. When he finally saw the body, he couldn’t help but gape. This was definitely the work of Moriarty, or at least someone who specifically was out for Sherlock. All identifying features of the body, anything that could have possibly told Sherlock anything about the victim was completely removed. He could tell the victim was a Caucasian male, likely in his 30’s or 40’s, and that he was relatively fit at the time of his death. But anything else that could have possibly narrowed him down from the thousands of people that could describe, and the hundreds of them who were reported missing, was gone. There was nothing left for Sherlock to observe and make deductions from.The mans fingertips, it appeared, had been dipped in acid, removing the print and leaving the fingertips red and bloody from the chemical burns. All the hair from his body had been removed, from his head to his toes. It looked like it had been waxed off, which for a full grown man with a lifetime of body hair must have taken ages.
“I just don’t understand,” John murmured. “I can’t, I don’t kill people.”
“Could I stop you if I didn’t?” Mary rolled her eyes.
“Don’t hurt yourself John, we’ll catch you up,” Mary said, her voice sounding playful. John looked up at her to find her grinning at him, and he felt the corner of his mouth twitch a bit for the first time in ages, although it was more muscle memory than a genuine reaction.
Sherlock's mind worked madly to make sense of everything. A whirlwind of information flying around in his mind, and Sherlock was working madly to file it all away into the appropriate rooms. But it was coming together somehow. amidst the chaos.
There were footprints in the muddy river bank around the body but they were virtually useless. Even to Sherlock. The water lapping at the shore had made them resemble nothing so much as morse code. Sherlock was brilliant but translating dots and dashes into a shoe size was beyond even him.
“No. Thank you. That won’t be necessary.” Sherlock said, subtly shifting his leg trying to get his stiffening cock into a more comfortable position.
The kitchen was quiet for a moment, the only sounds were newspaper pages being turned and tea being sipped.
“Wanna tell me that one again?” No answer. Inserting a third finger, Sherlock moaned again.
Omegaverse that is not a popular thing to do. You can either have your own babies or your useless to an Alpha. The Omega can still go into heat because of the ovaries still existing and they can still bond but without a womb, they feel worthless. Omegaverse society's making that rule. At least in this fic. Oh, and good luck getting your baby back from an Omega who's carried it for nine months.
“Whoah. Their coffee is expensive and you bought me a  large? You have to let me repay you this time. I feel like I’m taking advantage of you. What do I owe?” John asked, feeling a bit awkward at being bought something but never contributing back. An inexpensive cup of vending machine coffee was one thing but this kind of expense was ridiculous and it made John very uncomfortable accepting it.
“Amazing the stuff that’s disposable these days, eh? A plastic speculum,” John said, turning the tool back and forth, admiring its now lavishly greased construction.
“It’s your 40th birthday. I wanted it to be special and you know I’m not particularly good in the gift giving department. Besides, Molly assured me that you’d love it!” Sherlock said, a twinkle in his eye.
“Well, I haven’t a had such a good time in decades,” Sherlock said.
“It’s gone awfully quiet back there,” Lestrade said worriedly.
“What is it?” Sherlock said, kissing the corner of his mouth.
John read the text aloud:
“No. You can’t do this. I thought we were friends!”
“John! I’ve solved it!” The door bounced against the wall several times before settling into a few taps and then stilling. Absolutely no reaction from John. Unacceptable.
“So?”
“Make love to me, John.” Sherlock asked softly.
Yours,
Sliding closely behind John, Sherlock spread his legs open entwining first one leg then the other around John’s waist.
John took another step forward.
“A rude cock? Yes. Yes he is. But, he’s a brilliant cock, lord help us, and we need him.”
Sherlock entered Moran’s address into his mobile and hung up on Mycroft.
"Point taken."
“Where.” Shake. “Is.” Shake. “John?!”
Two guys walk into a brothel...use your imagination. ;)
Seeing Will pick pressing numbers into the old style phone, John said;
After a slight struggle between John trying to stop sucking and Sherlock refusing to let him go, John was able to pull his mouth off of Sherlock with a pop.
“Mrs Watson, I would have asked you if I’d had the time but John was bleeding out and wouldn’t have survived my leaving him on the table long enough to ask permission.”
“Pigeons?”
“Pillow talk. Nothing loosens the tongue like great sex. Especially oral sex, it seems,” John laughed.
“Absolutely,” John said with a smile.
Having said all that: I still hope you like it. :D
“Ok.”
Grabbing him by the shirt collar, Sherlock shoved him against the wall demanding;
“I’m sure it’s awful. I just want to check one more thing,” John said and began checking each finger individually, pulling one gently and pushing it back before moving on and repeating the action with the next finger.
“John, I’m flattered but I’m a bit over sensitized at the moment. We can pick up the experiment tomorrow.”
John disappeared around a corner, laughing maniacally.
“That’s why I’m so early tonight. I figured that you might be in need of an end of the week pick me up. I’ve noticed that you always work late on Fridays. This will put some pep in your step. Be right back.” Sebastian said, leaving to get the sugar before John could reply.
“John, we text every night. Every night. What part of this story are you unaware of. I told you that the butler did it before I’d even told Mycroft. If you’re trying to trick me into killing this bee, it’s not going to work and you should be ashamed of yourself!”
“John,” Sherlock sighed, “anyone can be killed by being stabbed in the heart, with anything, wooden or otherwise. That includes Dhamphirs. And before you ask; no, we don’t rise from the dead.”
“I heard that!”
“Best not to,” Sherlock said with a smile, pulling back the top sheet and getting into bed next to John.
“That’s the funny thing. I really should be but when I went in this morning, they told me that I was on leave for the next week which was news to me. I told them that I’d rather work but was told that the orders came from “higher up” and to “go home”,” whoever the hell that “higher up” is. Although I suspect that some tall, dark, curly haired man has something to do with it.” John said, shaking the last drops from a bottle that was now empty
“You’re no fun!” Sherlock pouted.
“And that’s my problem how?” John asked with a sneer.
“You shouldn’t be. Don’t contact me again.” Sherlock said, standing once again and turning to leave.
“Don’t call me that,” Sebastian said angrily.
Anderson wiggled his fingers obediently.
“Can’t I wait for him? I adore playing with his mind. He’s such a pompous know it all.”
John took his mouth off of Sherlock’s neck and slowly licked off the trickle of blood with a broad stroke of his tongue. He tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hair and whispered;
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s the way you’re looking at him. Maybe it’s the fact that you said his name with such longing. ‘Jooohhhhhn…’” Becca smirked.
“Yes. Yes. However, we both know that I’m smarter than you so the odds of you picking out not one, but two words that would repeat the results of the original experiment? Highly unlikely. I’d go so far as to say that it’s impossible. Don’t feel badly about it. I doubt that even Mycroft could figure it out. “What a thought! Strike that!” And here, Sherlock shuddered.
Flicking another spent cigarette into the commode, Sherlock went to pull another from the pack only to find it empty.
“No. I don’t think this is right. I need to find...Johhhn.” That was the last thing that Sherlock said then he was out like a light.
“But you’re supposed to tell me everything, remember?” John leaned back in his chair and smiled.
“Hey! I’m the only one who’s going to be allowed to have his fingers anywhere near your pies!”
“I’ve had a lot of time to think about the potential of our relationship…” John began.
John lay over Sherlock’s back panting, Sherlock’s forehead still resting against the back of his chair, breathing heavily, his robe now clinging tightly against his heated back.
“Who’s my bitch? Who. Is. It!” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear, punctuating each word with a brutal thrust.
I know that my death will be very hard on Sherlock. He really was the son I never had and I love him dearly. Now it’s your job to look out for him on your own because you know that he can’t be trusted to do it himself. I’ll be downstairs for a little while, making sure things are settling down here and then I’ll be moving on.
If Moriarty had been watching Sherlock’s habits, he’d have known that his thug had at best, until 2am to get John out of there before Sherlock went in after him. Which meant that, logically, they had to have implemented their plan well before 2am to ensure that there wasn’t a chance of Sherlock realizing that John had already been long gone by then.
“Stop it,” John said trying to hide a laugh.
“You don’t mean that. Shhh…,” John said when Sherlock began to respond. “You’re sad. You’re hurt. And you’re not exactly in your right mind at the moment. We just came back from the funeral. Now is not the time to make long lasting decisions. You’re saying things that you don’t mean and when you come back to yourself, you’ll regret them. Trust me, I know from experience,” John smiled ruefully.
Yours,
“And I’ll bet that you couldn’t…oh…”
“Sherlock,” Irene Adler said, entering the room gracefully. She held her hand out.
The door was immediately, but not hurriedly, opened by a woman in a sharp navy pin-striped dress modeled after the style of men’s suits, right down to the tie.
John thought this was said a bit smugly and sounded like a lie to him but what the hell. You only live once.
“Yes, well, in any event. Can we have penetrative sex now? I’ve been patiently waiting for you to come to your senses for awhile now, you must admit…Close your mouth, John. You look foolish.”
“Rude! Get over here and help me set it up before we hang another bag. ‘Hot water?’ Honestly.” Becca said beneath her breath.
Sherlock turned away from the bottle and spat.
“Well, that’s a tough question. He works in a section of the government with mob-like tendencies but, no, not officially the mob.”
"It IS a business, you know. Wouldn't want to keep clients from requesting our assistance. DAMMIT, JOHN!" Sherlock exclaimed.
“I’m just nervous.”
Short chapter. Mistakes, I've made a few. Just take it with grain of salt. Sherlock next chapter. Promise!
“Oh. Well, this is interesting…” Sherlock said.
“Oh. I’m sorry. That’s way too close for you to read comfortably, isn’t it,” John said and pulled Sherlock’s head up by his hair just far enough that he could read the open script.
“How’s that arm?” John asked, crouching down in front of a panicky Anderson.
“Time to make a call,” Sebastian said, pulling his mobile from his back pocket. He pressed a number that he hated to use but used it often enough to have it on speed dial and let it ring.
Many people think that if you’re a sex worker, you don’t matter. That you can tell us anything and we’ll just listen and admire how amazing, rich, and cruel you are.
“Believe what you’d like, Doctor Watson, it still won’t change the fact that you and my brother are now one. That’s more binding in our world than marriage, which we once did for public display but since it’s now common for people to live together, that’s no longer ‘required’ to maintain a facade anymore. No, I’m afraid that you’ll be together until death do you part.”
“Looks like I’m going to have to start timing the thermometer all over again,” John said in mock annoyance.
“It’s true?” John asked, too stunned to be angry.
“Mother fucker!” John yelled from the ground, watching the figure in a black coat that was swinging back and forth as he rapidly ran out of eyesight. Unable to hold himself up on his good elbow anymore, he finally lay supine on the ground trying to catch his breath. That bastard had just clipped his bad shoulder as he went racing by and John had fallen to the ground in agony. The man hadn’t even had the decency to stop and see if he was alright. Actually, he didn’t seem to realize that he’d run into someone or anything at all. The bloody bastard.
“Well, get him ready to go. I’m calling Mycroft before they kill him,” Irene said.
But finally! A case! Not just any case either. A case worthy of Sherlock’s time and intellect. The corner of his mouth pulled up, a smile almost, but not quite, lighting his eyes. The average person would never recognize it as such. It was better described as a smirk that a shark would give you. Right before they ate you. If sharks could smirk, that is.
“You don’t look like Sherlock,” John said suspiciously.
“Jim, I’m sorry but I ran out of time to grab Chinese. Bart’s was wall to wall cops so I had to go across town and hit up the local blood bank,” Moran said as he grabbed all five bags of O+ in one large hand, opened the icebox door with the other and placed them all neatly inside.
“You took the hit well…,” Sherlock changed the subject.
He instantly reads the book closely.
John is getting into being 'Dark John' a little too much.
“Is that a ‘yes’?” John asked, nuzzling Sherlock’s neck with a smile on his lips.
“See? That wasn’t so bad now, was it?” John said rhetorically with a firm pat to Sherlock’s buttocks.
“Well, what does it mean? That we reallym, really like each other? Pal around together? Are we just great friends?”
“No,” Sherlock said quickly. “He doesn’t need a hospital. Nothing’s broken. I can take much better care of him than some overworked, undereducated A & E physician and he’ll have the benefit of my undivided attention.”
Sherlock grabbed Watson’s wrist just as he was running a finger between his pants and his stomach.
“Don’t care,” John replied, watching as Sherlock downed the pills followed by a sip of water.
Mycroft twirled his umbrella and sighed turning to leave but hesitated.
“You’re being silly. Do you want to hear my idea or not?”
“Go back to sleep,” John said firmly.
“I play the violin at all hours of the day and night, don’t speak for days, and perform experiments in the flat.”
“You were going to do that anyhow. Try again.”
“Someone’s keeping birds on the roof? Are they looking for bees? Is that why there was a bee? I wasn’t asked permission to install a bird coop on the roof!” Mrs Hudson huffed, beginning to stand up.
“The yellow powder represents knowledge and learning and the victim’s head is covered in it,” John continued.
John spent the next half hour reviewing the script at the kitchen table. There wasn’t much to it but it fit a lot into a small amount of words. Trying to figure out whether he was nervous or excited, he walked over to the couch where Sherlock lay reclining looking for all the world like an emperor expecting to be fed peeled grapes - and waited.
After all, John’s “patients” were already dead while Sherlock was trying to save lives. Well actually, he only solved crimes for fun and to alleviate boredom, he didn’t really care if people died. In fact, he preferred that they do.  If no one died then Sherlock wouldn’t have any work and if Sherlock didn’t have any work, neither would John so he should be grateful to have Sherlock’s. In fact, he was actually doing John a favor; without Sherlock’s help, John would wander aimlessly about the lab trying to wrack his brain for something to do.
“Yes.”
“He’s very popular with the youngish clients. They want a father figure to dominate them and he fills the bill completely. It’s actually difficult to get on his schedule but he’d heard that you’d be coming in this week and volunteers were sorely lacking. He loves a challenge.”
Wednesday 10pm
Soon, they were both sweaty and breathing heavily, grinding back and forth.
“Ok. See. Here’s the thing. You know how people add salt to their food to bring out the flavor?”
“When? When does it get better, John? Truly, this is awful. I want her back so much and she’s gone. She’s gone and I wasn’t even here when you found her.” Sherlock sobbed.
“He’s here, dear!!” Mrs Hudson said excitedly.
Sherlock could hear the sound of running water as John washed his hands. This seemed…odd. Not that John never washed his hands but it wasn’t normally how they started any of these scripts.
“Have a seat Sherlock. I wouldn’t leave just yet were I you,” Moriarty said with an artificial calmness that was belied by the blackness of his eyes.
“Now, suck it!”
“That’s convenient. Tell me where he is and I’ll beat the answers out of him myself.” Sherlock said angrily.
— MH”
“Maybe he thinks that you’re beneath him. A waste of time.”
“Did we…” John whispered. “Did we have sex last night?”
“You’re the worst doctor ever!”
“And this is why you’re still single at 33,” Mycroft said, looking heavenward.
“Doctor Watson. I might ask the same of you. Why are you here already beginning the autopsy?”
John ran his hand down the back of Sherlock’s coat until he’d reached the split at the bottom. Sliding inside, he moved his hand over Sherlock’s firm arse to his sharp hipbone searching for…ah! There it was!
Counting the moments until I see you again,
“Ugh. Don’t be such a creeper. Give me that!” John reached for the mobile.
“Because Moriarty is going to come after you, especially now that he knows that you’re Sherlock’s Mate. We need to stop him from capturing you at all costs. Sherlock is a valuable asset to the government with a brain full of secrets and now he’s vulnerable - because of you. He’d move heaven and earth to find you and if that meant giving up state secrets, he wouldn’t hesitate to do so. Now, we have a long drive back to the city and I’m sure you’d like to get some rest before you have to be at work in the morning.”
“But I’m all out of nicotine patches and this case is an eight. An EIGHT, John! And you know how rare those are!”
Will dutifully turned around to pull another bottle of whiskey from the top shelf of the bar, uncorked it and set it in front of John.
“Care to refresh my memory?” John asked, squeezing Sherlock’s arse so tightly that he yelped.
“Good lord! You don’t think that they’d…? In a public place?! What do you think they were doing up there?” Lestrade asked, cheeks reddening.
“Given the tone of the previous 24 pages,  That seems sort of…generous, doesn’t it?” John had planned to get Sherlock off anyhow but hadn’t expected an ending where Sherlock any kind of relief after the proceedings. He looked quizzically at Sherlock.
Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. His arse already stung and he was beginning to feel the first hint of worry.
I knew that. I was trying to be humorous and failing miserably. Can’t wait to see you Friday night. XOXO
Monday
Sherlock was trying to hide his impatience and felt that he was being successful. Unfortunately, Sherlock and patience had never met. Or, if they had it had been only by benefit of Sherlock being unconscious at the time which could hardly be considered patience.
“Barkeep, just how much has our good Doctor Watson had so far this afternoon?” Sherlock asked Will with a heavy emphasis on “afternoon.”
“What for? You afraid someone will see me give you a good thrashing?” Anderson asked smugly.
“This isn’t your business, Watson. This is between me and the freak here.”
“Yo hoo! Mrs Hudson! You won’t believe what’s happened!”
“OW! Rude!” Yelled John, rubbing his cheek.
Sebastian threw himself down in the chair in disgust.
“I’ll be at the pub.” Harry said as she stomped out of the room and slamming the front door behind her.
“I’ll have you begging for mercy in no time.”
“Why?”
Anderson winced.
“We’re moving too fast. We should take this slow. Maybe…”
“Yeah, well, welcome to the club.”
“We’ll let you out right here and they’ll never know the difference, will they? They both seem unnaturally obsessed with the roof today.” Sherlock said as he pulled the playing card out and watched the bee fly immediately upwards. Just then a breeze blew the scent of flowers to his nose and so he followed it and the bee…to the roof.
“It’ll be ok, John. I won’t hurt you.”
Sebastian covered John with a blanket, gently tucking it in around him. (“I not supposed to do this but we are friends after all.”) As John was being slid further and further into his tomb, he suddenly began feeling sleepy. He looked over at Sebastian to see that he had opened the clip to allow the solution to drip at a faster rate, and started holding the IV bag up without John even noticing. John felt a sense of calm beginning to steal over him, his panic still there but the sense of urgency was greatly reduced.
“I’m your only daughter, da. Alpha or otherwise. Don’t forget about your Omega son at home,” she said slyly.
“Follow me.” The doctor lead Mrs Watson through the double doors and into the recovery room. He opened the curtains to where John lay, asleep but frowning as if he was worrying even then.
John just stared at the stranger for a few moments, trying to place where he knew this man from.
“Well, it really was a blessing in disguise.”
“Have you ever had anal sex before?”
“If you cause me anymore problems, you’ll pay for it. Is that understood?”
“He’ll be down in a minute dear. I’ll come down and make us all a nice cup of tea…”
“Never!” Sherlock burst up, using his forearms to force John to let him go. He then flipped him over and John now found himself pinned to the floor. He was grinning.
Sherlock waved that away.
John continued holding Sherlock’s hands tightly against the bed and rubbed their cocks together until they were both close.
“Sherlock?”
“John, no!” Sherlock reached out to grab John’s arm but he’d only touched air. He just put his head down and reluctantly followed him.
“In this situation? No.”
“I know but you love me in spite of myself,” Sherlock beamed at him.
“You’re so good to me, Sebastian.”
“She never had children of her own. She sort of unofficially adopted me,” Sherlock said, running his hand across another doily, this one on the end table. He looked around the room to see everything covered in doilies.
“Very well. Certainly I could exert my power as a Board member or even as a minor official in the government…”
As they lay there panting, John said;
“Yes. I know and I’m sorry but I’m out of my depth here and could really use your help. God forbid that Sherlock Holmes’ mate should die at Jim’s hand. There wouldn’t be any hole deep enough to hide from him.”
“I didn’t do that either. You arse.” He glanced around himself once again for anyone who could be listening. No one.
“This can’t possibly be in that script!” Sherlock exclaimed.
“She would like that, I think.” Sherlock said and sniffed.
“Don’t worry, John. He’d have known that the bees were for me and what this entire gift would mean to me. It IS a gift, isn’t it?”
His mobile buzzed again and he immediately pulled it out to see if it was John again.
“I know something else that you don’t know,” Sherlock said, throwing out what he hoped was the perfect bait.
“No. He did not. I don’t think he even realized that he’d run into someone.”
“Sometimes for all of us, love. Actually, most times for me.” Mycroft turned to address Sherlock, resplendent in a black tux, his hair still an unruly mass of curls.
I’m not busy tomorrow around 1pm, would you care to meet me for tea across the road from the hospital?
They're too tangled together, had ceased to be two separate people long ago. Two equally shattered people that collapsed into each other to create something that was so much more than the sum of their parts. The boundaries between them had been blurred from the very beginning, and had completely disappeared in a way that John had never experienced with any of his previous partners and Sherlock had never experienced at all. They weren't Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, but Sherlock-and-John and Holmes-and-Watson.
(He also doesn't ask any questions when her writings disappear entirely about a month *after*.)
“Let’s process this crime scene first, then we’ll go and get back the evidence from the ponce,” he looked around the room. There were several filing cabinets as well as three laptop computers that he could see. Even with the backup that was on the way, it would take hours before he was done.
, he thinks, but doesn't say.  He doesn't mention the brawls they would get into- the ones that John would instigate when he saw that Sherlock was getting too antsy without a case, the ones that Sherlock would goad John into after a particularly bad day- that would leave the flat a mess and leave both of them messes of bruises. He tries not to remember the nights that they'd cling to each other after one of them had a nightmare. He remembers the nights that he couldn't sleep because Sherlock would murder his violin at 3 AM in the morning, because he wanted so badly to smoke just
John thought
After an indeterminable amount of time- it could have been minutes, it could have been hours, all Lestrade really knew was that he was more embarrassed than he had ever been in his whole life- they both came out, John holding the chip on his palm.
Donovan didn’t succeed in following them.
He didn't tell Lestrade or Mrs. Hudson because they care about 'their boys' too much, and besides, they probably already knew. Both of them were too worried about him and too involved with everything anyways.
“We would like to get back to what we were doing,” Sherlock drawled.
Snatches of John and Sherlock’s conversation floated into the room.
They make their way up the stairs and Lestrade opens the door, his usual line of ‘it’s a drugs bust’ dying in his mouth as they take in the room before them.
Ella didn't understand - could never understand.
It had only been a few minutes before they came rushing back downstairs when Donovan screamed. Lestrade and Anderson came running back downstairs, heading for the source of the scream- Sherlock’s room.
“Well, judging from the sheer amount of blood I can see,” John paused to sniff, “and smell, this didn’t all come from one person.” He started walking around the room, measuring out distances. “Also, one of the people was significantly taller than the other two.”
He didn't tell Mycroft (or not-Anthea), although they had known that the British Government and his nameless assistant knew about them when they received a CCTV still of them holding hands and a note that said "Congratulations." Sherlock had torn the picture up into shreds and then lit them on fire and refused the next three cases from his brother. John kept the note.
“The hat-guy took it,” one of them answers.
He can feel the rumbles in his chest as Sherlock chuckles lowly. Later, he'll start worrying about the new scars that he can feel, will yell at Sherlock for pretending he was dead for two years even as he feeds him until his ribs aren't visible anymore. Right now, all he feels is relief.
He never thought that he'd be sad that there weren't science experiments in the dining room or when he woken up by his alarm clock instead of gunshots.
He doesn't bother telling Ella this either; she'd just take it as another sign of his extreme dependence on a man who'd tried to convince him he was lying and made him listen as he stepped off of a ledge. Her sessions are helping him work through his grief, but he had to keep some things private.
“So, where’s this chip?” Donovan asked, looking around the room. She sees a bloody scalpel on top of the table along with a few other tools, but not anything that remotely resembles a computer chip.
