One of which, Dean pulls over from its spot on the floor and rifles through the contents. Castiel backs away from the cellar door and sits at Dean’s side, his mind still attempting to process Dean’s actions. But the pieces fall into line, and the longer Castiel watches him fidget, the more he understands.
Anyika putters around the room, gathering up a collection of bones and powders. She sets them atop the table and sits in the opposite chair. For a while, she tinkers and sets what she needs in the bowl, then motions for Dean’s hand. “I suspect you’re not looking to contact a human.”
Wingbeats flutter into Castiel’s consciousness before his body can fully wake, leaving him trapped with his limbs locked until everything catches up. Dean’s touch comes into focus first, then his own limbs, then the looming presence at his back. Sitting up, Castiel pulls free from Dean’s limp grip, only to find Naomi and another angel standing a few feet from the bed.
“You think you’re…” Sam stops, rubbing his face with one hand. “Dean, you’re not going to Hell for that. I feel like after everything we’ve done, all the people we’ve pissed off, that Crowley would just throw us back out. And after the deal with Amara and Chuck, I’m pretty sure we’ve got an in.”
Traitorously, Castiel’s stomach growls. At least if he has to sit in the heat, then he can eat to take his mind off of it.
Steadily, the first hints of the sun’s rays peek over the horizon, illuminating a shadow looming by the bannister. Castiel’s heart swells, his mouth gone dry. Steeling his nerves, he pushes up off the couch and ambles outside, into the early morning air. A pleasant chill greets him, strange compared to yesterday’s heat. Yet, he embraces it, and the gentle press of a shoulder against his own, gravitating into his orbit.
His body moves of its own accord while the rest of him sits still, watching from below. Heart heavy, he climbs the ladder and starts unhooking Castiel, starting with his wings. Castiel is cold, with an underlying hint of warmth in his feathers, warm enough to make Dean believe, even for a split second. The worst part, besides wrenching the hooks out of Castiel’s bones, is knowing that once he finishes, then Castiel will collapse, and his wings will shatter on impact.
Anger twists across Dean’s face, the look in his eyes frustratedly sad. “Please don’t tell anyone,” he says—begs—and surges forward, lips mashed against his own. Castiel freezes for a long few seconds. Reaching up, he palms Dean’s cheek and tilts his head, until they merge, no longer a rough press. The tension in Dean’s body melts, eased by Castiel’s hand as he trails it down Dean’s chest, tracing over the tattoo decorating his pec, his peaked nipples, the mandala inked into his sternum. Dean shivers and groans, his grip a vise around Castiel’s wrist.
“Yeah, but not in Him.” He wraps his hand around Castiel’s wrist, kissing Castiel’s scarred palm. “God ain’t here for me, not like you are.”
She disappears in a rush of feathers, scattering the dirt at their feet. In the dead of night, Dean knocks Castiel’s cheeks with the backs of his knuckles, tears wetting his skin. Castiel burns hot with shame. “Hey,” he says, soft. “Hey, Cas.”
Silence.
“I can’t go back,” Dean says through the tears. He struggles to comfort himself, incessantly rubbing his hands together until his palms burn. “I can’t race again, I can’t—I can’t even think about it.”
Dean laughs and reaches to pull Castiel in for a hug. Difficult given the bedrail between them, but he makes it work. “I love you,” Dean says, again and again. And each time, Castiel say it in return, until all Dean knows is those three words, and nothing more.
Castiel doesn’t push him to, and doesn’t even try. “I’m not going to pretend that I understand what you’re going through,” he says, quiet. “I won’t pretend I know your family history or what your childhood was like, but Dean.” He pulls back, cupping Dean’s cheek. “You are a better man than your father.”
“Yeah.” Lifting his arm, Dean embraces him, releasing a shivering breath. “Yeah, just… don’t tell me if it’s bad, okay?”
Closeted, then. He knows the type intimately. “Maybe,” Castiel hums.
For some ungodly reason, elementary schools across the state feel the need to open before eight in the morning, leaving Dean remembering just what it was like decades ago, waking up in the dark and making it across town just in time for the sun to think about rising. Except now, he stands at the front of the class rather than sits behind a desk, but still with the same anxiety in his chest. Someday, it’ll fade.
something other than gnawing hunger and chills. Gradually, his body warms, and his senses flood back in. Sure, the last few times he went without food, he survived relatively unscathed, but never before has he had to drag a body half a mile purely on adrenaline alone. In the past, the reward was always something out of the first vending machine he found, or something swiped under his jacket from a curb store.
Across the room, Castiel opens one eye, his iris wide in the dark. “Are you speaking hypothetically or metaphorically?”
What he comes up with amazes even him—a nest, where he can spread out at his leisure, blocked off from the rest of the world. Heat pours in from the vent on the ceiling, bathing the room in a pleasant warmth. Again, he sneaks back downstairs and grabs several candelabras, setting them up on the bare patches of floor around the walls. The room slowly comes to life as he lights each candle, flickering and dancing as the wicks burn.
Castiel shakes his head. “I fell asleep as soon as I stopped last night,” he says. “Whatever happened took place before then.”
Angels are creatures of love. In a nanosecond, Castiel fell in love with him, and Dean watched it happen. With his every touch, every word, every lingering look, Castiel grew to love him, and the worst part—the most terrifying part—is that Dean loves him back. If Castiel stays by his side, if Castiel continues to watch over him—if Castiel touches him like he means something, then maybe this love can keep growing between them, with the same fierceness that Castiel pours into everything.
“Surprisingly well, but I still feared becoming a bystander.” Castiel drapes his arms over the hard plastic of the armrests, fingers limp. “It was an ideal circumstance. His mother is bisexual, and he’s coming into his own. But I can’t help but think if it were anyone else, if he lived anywhere else in the state, that the situation might’ve been different.”
“Alright,” Dean whispers, gathering Castiel into his arms. He gets his arms up under Castiel’s knees and around his back, mindful of the place where his wings once grew. Lighter now, but still heavy, his body mostly muscle. Dean’s knees ache just holding him. “Rowena,” he announces. Calling her would probably be better, but getting his phone out of his pocket would require another hand. “I know we’re not exactly buddies, but I’m kinda in a bind?”
“Of course.” Pulling back, Castiel presses a feather-light kiss to Dean’s temple. Dean whines a noise of embarrassment. “I’d rather be here than anywhere else.”
A grin spreads across Dean’s face, wrinkling the corners of his eyes. Even in the dark, Castiel can see the bruise darkening his right brow, still tender to the touch. He could heal it, but Dean won’t let him. Some things, according to Dean, are just part of the human experience. Still, Castiel hates to see him in pain.
Flopping onto the mattress, Dean stares at the off-white ceiling. The red-checkered bedding rustles as he waves an arm in the air. His stomach aches for something other than whiskey and gas station snacks.
A fan guides him awake, cool air brushing across his skin as it oscillates from side to side. Not only on his face, but across his body, from his neck to his waistband, then his feet, nearly all of him stripped bare. Swallowing, Castiel attempts to open his mouth, but the brush of a lukewarm cloth interrupts him, swiping across his forehead, then his side. For the first time in a long while, he hurts, ingrained into his Grace and spreading, festering.
The shop comes back into view, the candles backlighting Anyika’s face. She stares at him with wide eyes, her jaw slack—and Dean bursts into tears, pressing his bloodied palm to his mouth.
“I want a life outside of racing. I wanna be able to walk away without regrets, and I wanna be able to look at myself in the mirror and say, I did my best. But I can’t if I’m scared every time I get in the car.” He blinks, tears spilling into the corner of his nose. Castiel wipes them away with a shaking thumb. “Tell me it’s alright, man. Tell me we’re gonna get through this.”
“Cas,” Sam says, a bit winded. Castiel sits up in time for Sam to throw himself into his arms, and Dean wonders if Castiel’s wince is from a broken rib and not sadness. “I didn’t think Dean’d find you—”
“No.” Dean shakes his head. “No, no, just… It’s me, man. It’s just…” He lets out a breath, closing his eyes. “It feels like another dream. Like I’m gonna wake up, and I’m gonna be alone again. You know how many times I imagined it, if you just walked in the front door like nothing happened?”
His heart clenches. “I know,” Dean manages. He turns away, shamefaced and pulse quick. “Always feels like it is, though. But that’s just me, these people you’re gonna talk to, some of ‘em still got families. I didn’t get to keep mine.” A breath. “Don't beat yourself up about it. Just… try and keep them safe.”
“Angels aren’t in the business of killing one another.”
“I know, I know,” Dean shushes. He never figured Castiel would get suckered by an animal, but apparently even angels can have their hearts twisted. “Look, when we go into town today, we’ll go by the pet store. Don’t want her scratching up the furniture.”
Dean grabs his arm before he can turn—John awards him with a fist to the nose for his trouble, the resulting crack sending blood spilling down his face. In all the ways it could’ve happened, Dean never expected it to be over protecting his mother, of all people. Maybe if John caught him with Castiel, or another boy, but not this. And no amount of wrestling training or self-defense courses can save him from the way John throws his fists with absolute violence, his class ring cracking Dean’s cheek, his temple, several ribs. He manages to duck out of the way of a few blows, but John returns the favor with an even harder jab, until Dean ends up on his back, tears in his eyes and a shout caught in his chest.
Bright blue eyes watch him from above, glowing just the faintest hint of blue as he kisses his way down Dean’s chest, all wet lips and an even hotter tongue. The second Castiel finds his belt, Dean bucks up into him involuntarily, chasing the friction that Castiel refuses to give him. “You’ll have to walk me through this,” Castiel says, unclasping his belt and working his zipper down. Dean lifts his hips, allowing Castiel to pull his jeans off, leaving him in his briefs and nothing else.
, he tells himself.
“I know why you did it,” Castiel mumbles, his eyes straight ahead. “And they’ll grow back. They always have, each time I’ve died. But you had no right—”
“I’ve only ever taken out six at a time,” Dean manages. “And Sam was with me.”
The psychic stares at him, her shock slowly dying. “I do whatever you need,” she says, still skeptical. “But I need an explanation first. Are you possessed?”
“That’s definitely racing,” Bela says. “Dean Winchester, back on the track in Vegas.”
Sam leans his elbows on the table, fingertips pressed to the bridge of his nose. “Look, I’m not gonna say I don’t want to, ‘cause I do,” he sighs. “But you could’ve told me about this yesterday. I could’ve been packing.”
The fall doesn’t happen gradually, but rather instantaneous, snapping Castiel awake and sending him from the abysmal quiet of his resting place to the navy-blue darkness of night. Stars pinprick the sky, twinkling and glittering like diamonds amid the water in his eyes. Blinking, Castiel wipes his face, his hand just as wet. The world smells of stagnant decay. He floats, no oxygen in the water to help him sink.
Swallowing, Dean ducks his head. “Kinda hard to forget.” He thought about washing the blood out of his coat, or bleaching the spot. Two years later, and it still hangs in the back of his closet, left there after Dean traced the design and took it to the first tattoo parlor he could find. No questions asked, no answers needed. He drove back to Kansas with a memory on his arm and a hole in his heart.
Sex in itself isn’t a strange concept—the merging of bodies in the exchange of mutual pleasure, the connection, both emotional and physical, and the height of ecstasy—but for Castiel, it isn’t a necessity. And as much as Dean has enjoyed it in the past, he doesn’t push, and doesn’t move beyond kissing and the occasional wandering hand.
“Just—I don’t wanna think about it either, but it’s not like Cas has ever stuck around—”
Briefly, Castiel looks down at his chest, finding the meticulous outline of the koi already healed, no trace of inflammation in sight. He traces the lines with his fingertips, noting the slight ridges. “I can stop, if it’d make you feel more comfortable.”
Heat rising up his neck, Castiel ducks his head. “Only if you want to.”
keeping him from fully enjoying the moment.
But nothing happens. The longer he lies there, the more he thinks about leaving to sleep on the couch instead. At least there, he can rest without feeling like he’s being watched.
“None taken.” Castiel shakes his head with a shy smile. “Has anyone ever confronted you about it?”
“No.” Castiel leans up on his elbows, his blue eyes hard, insistent. “Angels don’t mate with each other. We don’t have the drive or the want.”
“I get it.” And in a way, Sam probably does. Every once in a while, he and Eileen meet up, but according to him, the fire burned too quickly, and supposedly, friendship suits them more than romance ever did. Whether or not Sam actually believes that, Dean refuses to pry. Sam looks back to the shore where Castiel makes his way to his feet, walking across the sand. “Look, just… If you need to talk about it, I’m not going anywhere.” He stops. “I was thinking about leaving Kansas.”
“Woke up one morning, and I had blood on my pillow. Just spots, but it wasn’t my head I was worried about.” He turns his attention to his feet and pulls off his socks, one by one—revealing two identical wounds that Castiel has never seen on him before, not that he spends much time looking at Dean’s bare feet. Heart in his throat, he touches one of the wounds, smoothed and silvered with age. They both sit unevenly, mirroring the active sores on his own feet.
“I know.”
Rolling onto his stomach, Dean makes his way to his knees. “Hey,” he says, wringing his hands. His gut sours. “You didn’t change your mind, did you?”
Humming, Castiel tilts his head, allowing Dean to kiss him as his leisure. “Nine,” he sighs. “You slept in.”
Between them, Castiel draws his length into his hand, precome slick between his fingers. “You’re not,” he gasps. His spine arches, his toes curling into the sheets. “You’re not using me, Dean—”
What Dean needs is help, and no psychologist will touch him, though many have tried. Grief counselors, psychiatric facilities, even the psychic down in Jekyll who claimed she could cure all ailments, but screamed the second Dean walked in the door—none of it worked, and still, Dean suffers from a loss Sam has lived with for decades, and has only just now begun to mend.
Dean’s heart stops. “Mom—”
“I was like, four,” Dean groans, head thrown back. “I had imaginary friends, ‘cause I didn’t have any real ones. All I did was talk about them for like, a year, and then they went away.” He closes his eyes, clenching a fist. “It was around the time Sam was born. Figured it was my brain’s way of coping, ‘cause mom almost died in the hospital, but she… Shit, she actually believed me. Everyone else thought I was just a kid.”
Castiel hums. Their elbows brush, cool fabric against sun-warmed skin. “I can stay in bed until you wake up,” he offers. Genuine and probably platonic, but Dean’s face burns, and not from the sun. “I wanted to give you space. You kicked me in your sleep.”
“C’mon, man—”
“Dean.” Missouri takes him by the wrist. Not the rough touch he was expecting, but gentle, coaxing him to look up. He can’t, his stomach in his throat and his heart taking a vacation to the Keys. “Dean, I want you to look at me.”
Castiel stands and offers Dean a hand. Taking it, he helps pull Dean to his feet, the two of them smudging the circle in the process. His clothes still lay on the ground. Somehow, that’s more interesting than looking Castiel in the eye, even when he palms Dean’s cheek. Blood stains his fingers.
“Cas,” Dean croaks. “Cas, I don’t—”
“I deserve worse,” Castiel says.
Castiel sets his sword down atop one of the couches, the one probably still stained with his blood in places. “I have no opinion,” he says and joins them, crossing his feet under his legs. “Unless it’s a bomb, then I have several.”
And wakes to a truck downshifting on the highway. Blinking at the motel ceiling, Dean sluggishly reaches up and feels his throat, finding only sweat-warmed skin. No bite marks, no blood—just unblemished flesh and the scar from where a blade nicked him over ten years ago. A fire burns under his skin, and his cock throbs in his briefs, more than interested. He can’t, not here. Sam is in the other bed, and they don’t have time. As soon as the sun rises, they need to finish the tracking spell and get on the road, before anyone else gets hurts.
Minutes pass in silence, then hours. At some point, Dean wakes from a doze to find Castiel wandering, aimless, before he finds a new place to roost. Said place being the end of Dean’s couch, in the gap between the arm and Dean’s knees. The closest they’ve been in hours. Dean’s heart swells, just from proximity.
“God.” Dean shakes his head. At least he never has to drag Castiel down that road again, with John set to serve ten to twenty-five at the penitentiary in Atlanta for a laundry list of crimes that Dean never even knew existed. Most, he doesn’t want to remember. Knowing what happened to him is all he needs to know, and forget. “Oh, I got my paper finished.” Reaching over the bench, Dean grabs a manila folder from his backpack and hands to Castiel. “Don’t gotta read it now, but—figured since it’s the last day and all, I’d turn it in.”
For most of the night, Castiel waits on the porch, long after Benny and Garth head inside, and long after Ash shuts off his music. The night remains quiet, not unlike every other night, with the low, haunting sound of the train breaking the silence. The cicadas sleep, the squirrels slumber in their nests, and a doe and her fawn gnaw on a hydrangea along the side of the driveway.
The kiss flashes through his mind again, hazy from the alcohol, but still real.
“Dean.” Sam squeezes his shoulder; Dean struggles not to jerk away, solely out of habit. “We’re good, okay? You gotta trust me. And of course Cas is gonna forgive you, he always will.”
Castiel shushes him, sating him with a kiss. It doesn’t make sense, though, why he isn’t screaming, or begging for the pain to stop. In fact, Dean’s soul welcomes him, treats him as a friend, unlike Sam or Bobby or any of the other people Castiel has touched over the years. Given his way, Castiel would bury himself in Dean, would bask in the softness of his soul. Against his will, he begins to pull free, but Dean chases him, a whine escaping his lips. “Dean, I need to…”
A smirk crosses Castiel’s lips. “I got a better idea, gimme a sec—”
“Cas,” Dean mutters. Castiel palms his cheek, feeling Dean relax, limp in his hold. “Cas, are you…”
“Dean,” Castiel mumbles, attempting to sit up—
After that, Dean passes out.
Nothing. Dean’s head lolls to the side, and Castiel’s heart sinks.
In the quiet, Dean eats a single-serving box of stale Cheerios and fires off a text to Sam—that Castiel is alive, that as of right now, he doesn't need any backup. He leaves out that Rowena paid him a visit, and that Castiel probably hates him more than he ever has. But he can deal with that. So long as Castiel is alive, then he’s fine.
“I heard you rolling around,” Dean mentions. He lifts a hand, intending to pat Castiel’s thigh, but drops it instead, the sudden adrenaline rush going to his head. “Something on your mind?”
Deftly, Castiel twirls the blade, careful to not catch his fingers on the sharpened edges. His own sits tucked into his wings, alongside a longer sword that he’s never had the opportunity to use, and hopefully never will. “This can kill angels,” he says, watching Dean’s eyes widen. “It’s forged from a piece of our Grace and given to us at the time of our creation. It’s one of the only methods that can kill us.”
He finds Dean in the seventh circle, his arms soaked red and his eyes horrifically black. Horns sprout from behind his ears, curling into a spiral with a single flame burning from the tips. The soul on his rack is long gone, nothing left but a hollowed-out corpse. But Castiel doesn’t pay attention to that. All he sees is the man that Heaven tasked him to retrieve, and the same man who turns to him with fear and resignation in his eyes. Tears spill down his cheeks, taking with them the blood of too many people, and some of it his own. Such a beautiful face, one that several times, a demon has torn apart, and he bears the scars.
He offers a hand, and the man takes it, calluses sliding against his skin. Feverishly hot; Castiel aches to touch him, to palm across his chest, and part of him suspects that if they were alone, the man would let him. “Dean,” Dean says, his voice gone quiet. He slides an inch closer, spurred on by alcohol. “Anyone ever tell you you got a pretty face?”
Visibly, Dean relaxes, but only just. He uses Castiel as leverage to sit up, still holding the sheets over himself, like somehow, letting an angel see him shirtless is a mortal sin. Out of sight of Naomi, Castiel brings his arm around Dean’s back, letting him lean into him. “What kinda proposition?”
Dean nods, wringing his hands in his lap. He doesn’t have many friends in the first place, and he barely knows Castiel, but knowing that someone in town understands him gives him enough comfort that he might make it out after all. “Think we’re done with parties for the semester,” he mumbles. “You free Tuesday night?”
, Castiel thinks. Another time when the temperatures in the afternoon aren’t enough to roast him alive. At some point, Dean sits up, slipping out of Castiel’s arms, and Castiel barely manages to hold back his whine before it’s out. A hand comes to rest in his hair, a reminder that Dean is still there, just—observing.
Castiel sighs through his nose. He yanks his coat sleeve up, then his jacket, all to bare his forearm. He twists off the cufflink—a small gold stud, maybe worth a few bucks if he decided to hock it at a pawn shop—and tosses it onto the dashboard. From there, Dean watches him flex his wrist, his tanned skin unexpectedly warm when he motions for Dean to touch the soft underside.
“There we go,” Dean chuckles. “Sam, you gotta name the bikes.”
“No, I know. Just—say hi.”
“A bounty?” Castiel says. His wings ache to expand, to beat away the creatures creeping closer at his back, but fighting will only end in disaster. Dean’s life hangs in the balance.
Hiding has never gotten him anywhere, though. As much as he wants to stay seated, Castiel drags himself to his feet and retreats to his bedroom to grab a coat from his wardrobe. Briefly, his hand lingers over his trench coat, fingertips tracing over the worn material almost longingly. Yesterday morning, it was just a coat—now, it might as well be a reminder of what he isn’t, what he always was.
“It’s fuckin’ stupid,” Shiloh continues. He motions toward the pews, a scowl on his lips. “People come here to what, fuckin’ listen to a preacher that’s throwing darts at the Bible for this week’s sermon? No one in here’s even read the damn book, and they believe everything he says. Last time I went, I used to go to that church up the road, with the big white steeple. Preacher got up there and said if we didn’t devote ourselves to God, if we didn’t fuckin’
A weight leaves Dean’s shoulders. He stops, bending over with his hands on his knees. Castiel offers a hand to support him; Dean shakes his head, more interested in breathing than help. They’re dead—Good. Great, even, if Alastair is one of the deceased. But until he has physical proof and not just Castiel’s word, then it’s just a fantasy. “Shit,” Dean breathes. His eyes sting. Castiel’s hand on his shoulder only makes it worse. Upright, he scrubs his face and wipes away the stray tears.
Jack shrugs and looks between them, his smile neutralizing. “I originally planned to let you live without any interference, but I feel… lonely, by myself. The angels are nice, but they’re not my family.”
Dean retches again, mostly water, but it still turns Sam’s stomach just hearing him. Tilting his head up, Sam closes his eyes, willing the lump in his throat to subside.
That same red flush reaches Dean’s eyes, where a tear spills over, dipping into the crease of his nose. Quickly, he wipes it away. “Course you’re my friend,” he says. A smile breaks free, looking all the bit pained. “Never said you weren’t.”
“We beat God,” Dean whispers, catching Castiel’s attention. “Jack took his power. He’s trying to fix Heaven, and Sam… Sam’s with Eileen, now.”
Tilting his head up by his chin, Castiel leaves a kiss to the corner of his lips. “Give me time,” he says. Between them, Sonia thrashes and sinks her claws into the front of Dean’s shirt, dangerously close to a nipple. “This isn’t me turning you down, Dean.”
“Yeah, nothing.” Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Dean leans against the sink, out of Castiel’s immediate orbit. Looking at the backs of his eyelids is easier than having to see the sadness on Castiel’s face, or the anger, or whatever. Dean can’t look at him for more than two seconds without feeling guilty. “Look, you got anywhere else to be? ‘Cause the pizza guy’s five minutes late and all I’ve eaten is straight sugar.”
Castiel shoves his blade into Dean’s hand, and Dean presses the sharpened edge into Castiel’s neck, slicing a two-inch gouge into his throat. Grace floods the wound, and Dean latches onto it, the rush going straight to his head, threatening to spill from his eyes, his ears. Castiel’s wandering hand comes to rest atop the small of Dean’s back, stabilizing him—holding him while he bends his knees and thrusts up and
“Did you kill them?” Sam asks. Dean affirms with a grunt, not trusting himself to speak. “Look, Dean, it’s been… I know you care about him. I do too, but you’ve gotta think about this rationally. It’s been four months. Maybe he just—went back to Heaven.”
Dean pulls back, still pressed close, Castiel’s hands settled over his hips. Gentle, he thumbs away the wetness dotting Castiel’s eyelashes. “You still pissed?”
Through the connection, Dean’s soul offers up slivers of a dream, a vision of a sunflower field in the summer, their heads pointed toward the sun. Dean walks among them, overshadowed by their height and hidden in the shade. A fleeting glimpse before it disappears. Dean’s soul pulls back, leaving Castiel bereft with the loss.
Castiel holds him while he sleeps, his Grace soothing the fresh growth in Dean’s soul as he rests. And in turn, Castiel joins him, wandering his way into Dean’s dreams, where they reside as one, connected once again.
“Look, I know him, man,” he starts again. Swinging his legs over the side of the couch, Dean stands, unsteady on his feet. He needs sugar, and the snack cakes in the Impala barely count as food. “And Cas wouldn't run off if it wasn't for a reason.”
The mattress shifts; Castiel straddles Dean’s thigh, his cock bobbing between his legs, still as hard as ever. They could go again, depending on how this conversation goes. Castiel cradles his face, and Dean meets him for a kiss, so unlike all of the others, the lust replaced with something Dean doesn’t want to name yet. “I’m tired of waiting,” Castiel says, peppering kisses up Dean’s throat. “I’m tired of so many things, and I feel like I’m wasting time if I don't, as you’d say, get off my ass and do something about it.”
“That ain’t like him,” he mumbles. “His folks are out on Yatesville Road, they got about ten acres. Maybe his mama needed help with somethin’.”
“Yeah, once.” Dean blows into his feathers again, an utterly strange feeling that Castiel can’t decide if he likes or not. “I only fell off twice. C’mon, you, me, we can even see the dolphins you keep checking out.”
Castiel follows Dean out of the Impala, trudging through the dirt and maneuvering around a massive puddle between the front of the car and the porch. Dean sidesteps it like second nature, while Castiel barely manages to keep his shoes dry. The minute he steps onto the porch, Dean stops, gripping the banister. Doubt flashes through his soul for the briefest of seconds, before he takes another step toward the door.
. “Sounds like fun.” Leaning the chair back on two legs, he wobbles, then sets it down. No use breaking his back this morning. “So’s my car actually in a junkyard? Or are you just pulling my leg?”
“Well, you slept all night, and we spent all day at Walmart,” Sam says. “Have you seen anything here that I haven’t?”
Looking to the ceiling, Castiel lets out a breath through his nose. “It’s complicated,” he explains. “As soon as God finished creating humanity, we were told to watch but not interfere. What the human race did to each other was of their own doing. He gifted them with free will, something that angels weren’t allowed for so long. But Dean’s case is… concerning, to say the least.”
He shouldn't—really, he shouldn't even try, but he mirrors Castiel and touches his cheek, afterward running his fingers through his hair. Softly, Castiel sighs and closes his eyes. “When you crashed,” Dean says, low, “I didn’t know what to do. I just stood there in the pit box, and I couldn't—I couldn’t move. I saw them pull you out, and you were screaming, and I just—I thought, this was it, I’m about to watch my best friend die. And you fought so hard, you did everything you could”—his voice cracks, tears filling his eyes—“and they took everything from you, and I don’t want that to be me, Cas.
“Soulmates aren’t inherently romantic,” Castiel amends. A red flush heats the tips of his ears anyway, visible in the midafternoon sunlight pouring through the kitchen window. “But you touched my core, Dean.” For emphasis, he touches his sternum. “Unless you somehow possess Grace, it shouldn't be possible.”
“Good.” Bobby leaves the room, brushing their shoulders on the way out. “I’d hate to have to kill you.”
“I was set up,” Dean says. He takes another swallow and pushes his drink to the side. “Someone tipped us off on a fake case and had me killed. Just can’t figure out who.”
“Nah.” Dean pats the Impala’s dashboard, smoothing his fingertips over the worn plastic. “Haven’t gotten to drive her this far before, figure I’d break her in. How about that?”
Castiel squeezes him tighter. “You’re not going to Hell.”
He must be dead. This must be heaven, because Castiel might be the best lay he’s ever had, with a cock that can reach just where he wants and hands that never leave his skin. Dean whines with every thrust, his attention torn between swallowing Grace and jerking his cock. He should be focusing on Castiel, should be getting him off instead, but Castiel refuses to let him so much as move and takes over, using him, owning him in a way Dean has never been before.
“I’m too old to join in on your fun,” Bobby says from inside. He shoves the screen door open and steps outside, not even phased by Castiel’s precarious position or Dean’s reddened cheeks. “Was thinking about driving over to Rapid City anyway to meet up with Rufus. Rodeo’s in town.”
Dean keeps his hands to himself, mostly—Castiel, on the other hand, can barely control himself, mostly around jewelry and anything that sparkles. Sometimes, Dean wonders if he started dating a crow. “Come on, man,” he says for the fifth time, his hand to Castiel’s bicep as he leads him away from a stall filled with questionably authentic watches. “We’re not made of money.”
And now, he can’t breathe. Or, not like he wants. Every attempt comes out as a panicked wheeze, and his throat threatens to close.
Sam arrives somewhere around three, only to find Dean stuck in the bathtub. Stuck, in his opinion, not Dean’s. “Best forty-five minutes of my life,” Dean complains when Sam helps him stand and offers him a towel, “and you gotta come in and ruin it.”
At this point, he could care less. Because between them, he holds Castiel’s hand, out of sight of the occasional pit reporter and photographer. Said pit reporter approaches the booth and signals to Castiel for an interview. Only, today, she doesn’t want Castiel.
Castiel looks at the folder fondly and cracks it open, checking to make sure all the pages are there. They should be. Dean counted them five times after printing them out to make sure. “Thank you,” he says. Knees in the seat, Castiel tucks the folder into his suitcase, alongside the rest of the assignments he needs to grade. They have time, though, especially if they make it to Shreveport by dark. “We could’ve taken my car, instead of sending her ahead.”
Blood cleaned from his skin and clothes piled up on the floor, Dean dries his hair in the mirror. None of his clothes are clean except for his briefs. Not that Castiel hasn’t seen him in worse states, but it still frightens him to be that vulnerable in an angel’s presence. But Castiel won’t chastise him, won’t do anything if Dean doesn’t want it, unlike the Castiel in his dream.
They pull into Lebanon around six in the evening a day after, Dean road-worn and back aching, Castiel looking halfway to falling asleep in the passenger seat. Almost thirty-eight years old, and the more miles he puts behind him, the more he wonders if it’s worth it, in the end. If the people they save outweighs the bodies left behind, if the sweat and scars are worth the time it takes to heal. His best years are behind him—the rest of his life, he has no clue what to do with.
Unfortunately, Castiel is right. Dean woke up terrified and afraid and in desperate need of consolation. All Alastair would’ve needed to do is press a little deeper to make Dean do the unthinkable.
They separate—unwillingly on Dean’s part—and Dean turns to his bag. “Pack,” he says to Sam, looking over his shoulder. Sam sits on his bed, halfway into lacing his boots. “Minute we’re done, we’re leaving town.”
“What if I wanted to?” Dean sucks in a breath, holding it until his lungs ache. “I couldn’t—I saw what you looked like. Someone tortured you and left you to die, and I couldn't—I wasn't gonna leave you there. After everything, that’s not how you deserve to go.”
“My name is Anyika,” she explains, motioning toward a chair. Dean takes it, fear spiking his heart rate. Sam didn't bring him to a psychic—Sam brought him to a high priestess. “I don’t normally speak to hunters.”
, he thinks, head in his hands.
“You think I don’t know that?” Dean huffs, shoving the pedal harder. The engine revs, louder than the blood pounding in his ears, his breaths coming in quick bursts. “Get him off my ass, he’s been bumping me for the last ten laps.”
Lunch comes in the for of all-you-can-eat pancakes at the only IHOP in a sixty-mile radius, smothered in strawberries and whip cream and more syrup than Dean can handle. Castiel fiddles with Dean’s phone the entire time, barely interested in the plate of eggs and sausage Dean ordered him. Dean picks off it to drown out the sweetness.
Dean has no clue about that. For the first time in his life, he doesn’t know what to do with his time, or where to go. “I guess I got time to figure that out,” he says, matching Castiel’s grin with his own. “You coming with?”
Dean lowers his fork, blinking between Naomi and Castiel. Castiel wishes he could return to stasis, preferably with Dean at his side. “Is this the same demon that claimed that he was following Lucifer’s orders?”
Castiel’s favorite is a wooden windmill stitched in bright blue, with tulips surrounding it in a multitude of colors. Each piece is stitched with the creator’s name—that one, he knows by heart. Margaret passed shortly after she gifted him the patch, and the three of them attended her funeral on the outside of town. Along with the piece, she gave Castiel all of her patterns, which he keeps in a small box at the top of his closet, just in case. There’s history here, of Lebanon as a whole, and hopefully the three of them will be able to treasure it for years to come.
Sitting up, he cranks down his window to let some of the heat out, the worst of it already drawing a sweat to his brow. “I talked to a man Friday morning in Cuthbert. He comes from a long line of military family members, and he refused to enlist. Which, sent up a red flag for his father, but he doesn’t think it’s related to his being gay.”
“C’mon.” Dean slides off of the hood and out of the reach of Castiel’s wings. He takes Castiel’s hand, though, and drags him the few feet it takes to make it to their room. “Keep ‘em out. Wanna look at ‘em for a while.”
Slowly, Dean nods. “Just need you. Always gonna need you. I wanna—I don’t want this life anymore, Cas.” Opening his eyes, he searches for Castiel’s, lost in ethereal blue. “I’m done. With hunting, with… all of it. I’m too young to hurt like this. I mean, I’m a hundred-twenty-eight going on twenty-nine.”
Sitting atop the hood, Dean kicks at the grass until a clump comes away, revealing dirt and clay and a worm. For a while, he listens to the noise of the cars passing on the two-lane and the roosters crowing as they finish their morning walk. No one joins him, no one except for the birds skittering through the trees and the squirrel that walks back and forth on the line connecting the power pole and the front awning of the church.
“Dean?” he calls, soft at first, then louder, his voice echoing off the automobiles. Nothing answers. Pulling the Colt from his waistband, Castiel shoots into the air and waits for an answering shot.
“It’s not just you,” Dean chuckles. “’Cept, it’s yours, so I don’t gotta pull my shoulder trying to fuck myself.”
. “I’m sure you can come up with something,” he leers, draping his arms over Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel grips his waist, burying his face in Dean’s neck. Gentle lips kiss a trail up his throat, then settle below his ear, where he sucks a mark. A shudder rips up Dean’s spine, a moan pouring from his lips. “Cas…”
“Give them a few weeks and something will change,” Castiel soothes. “Hopefully the next time will be when you’re up on the podium.”
He bore stigmata—Dean wore the wounds of Christ, and never spoke a word.
Castiel doesn’t respond. For a long minute, he just stares at Dean, his lips a thin line. Then, he pulls his phone from his pocket, thumbing through his apps until he finds what he’s looking for. “This is the only way you’ll understand,” he says, “because I can’t explain it to you. I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, but it still doesn’t make any sense.”
“Is that what you’re calling it?” Castiel asks.
Touching Dean is easy, when Dean allows it. Gingerly, Castiel rakes the tips of his nails around Dean’s ear, then again from his forehead to his nape. A whine escapes Dean’s throat, one he’ll probably be ashamed of tomorrow. That doesn’t stop him from grabbing Castiel’s hip, though, his hand trembling. “You’re allowed,” Castiel says, hoping Dean understands. Comfort works both ways. Castiel doesn’t need it, but part of him has always wanted to be admired, especially by someone so beautiful, so holy.
It’s quaint, really. Everyone nods and greets him as he passes, and some strum up conversations that in California would never have happened. About the weather, about the festival coming up next weekend, about the most mundane things, yet Castiel thrives on the sound of other people’s voices, the snippets into their lives. Small talk is easy when neither party will remember the other, but in this town, everyone knows their neighbors, and word travels fast. Anything he says is up for Sunday dinner conversation, if he doesn’t choose his words carefully.
Swallowing, Dean nods. He might need more paper for this.
Dean mirrors him, letting out a breath.
Once inside, Sam directs Dean to the downstairs half-bath, toeing the door open. He sets Dean in front of the toilet, and barely has time to grab a rag from the under-sink counter before Dean lurches and empties his stomach with one of the most horrific noises Sam has ever heard. He overshadows the noise by turning on the faucet, wetting the washcloth. After Dean finishes, he shuts off the tap. Dean flushes—somehow—and Sam drapes the rag over the back of his neck.
. “You tried,” Dean says in consolation, despite the wobble in his voice. “You—you really tried, man. Not gonna say you didn't.”
At one point, he kicks what feels like a deflated basketball. His foot comes away smelling strongly of rotten fruit; pointing his flashlight down, he spots the brown-orange color of a misshapen pumpkin, his boot stuck in the middle of a bruise with seeds spilling everywhere. “Oh, gross,” he grunts and shakes his foot off.
. “Even if he never told me, I can see it here.” He touches a spot above Dean’s heart, then runs his finger down to his hip. Dean swallows, the corners of his eyes wet. “It’s curable, but I need your full cooperation. I’d also like you to be conscious.”
Castiel kisses him as feet begin to ascend the stairs. “I’m not,” he says, holding Dean close. “I’m yours, Dean.”
“She’s perfectly adequate,” Castiel huffs. “But we have more than one car now.”
“He knows nothing of this,” Rowena snaps, then corrects herself. “Fergus was never an angel. Neither was I, but I can read the tomes. I understand things ordinary witches could never even dream, and these runes, they’re meant to rot his body. They’ve contained his Grace so that by the time he freed himself, he wouldn't have a body to go back to.” She lowers her hand, petting through Dean’s hair. “The most I can do is break the runes. It might help if you let him touch you, just so he knows you’re there.”
“I’ll keep it,” Castiel says in haste. Sam hands it over with a pout, and Castiel holds it at his side, a newfound determination on his face.
Nodding, Mary covers his hand with her own. “He sounds great.”
He shouldn’t—he
“Just relax,” the nurse carrying the ice tells him. She presses a cold hand to his forehead, urging him to lie back. Dean goes all too willingly, his eyes rolling back as he hits the pillows. Whatever her name is, he can’t find it in himself to find out. “You had some internal injuries, but you’re better than when you first came in, Mr. Winchester. Can you tell me how you got here?”
In the dead of night, Castiel wakes to Naomi standing in the corner, utter indifference on her face. Leaning up on an elbow, Castiel squints and watches her walk across the floor, soundless. Dean doesn’t wake, too busy drooling into his pillow to do anything else.
A smile spread across Dean’s lips, his teeth showing. “That’s what I wanna hear. Now, sit back, you’re gonna be here for a while.”
Dean stares. “Jack said you have a soul.” Castiel’s eyes widen. “He said the Empty won’t keep anything that’s human. Are you…”
, he thinks. But if he comes now, then he can work up to a second, if Castiel is generous.
“You marked me,” Castiel says, astonished. How Dean managed to do that, he’ll never know, but it’s there, a tattoo to match his own. “You gave me part of your soul.”
“Yeah,” Dean says through a moan.
“You could display it,” Castiel hums. Eyes half-lidded, he sidles closer, incredibly warm where they touch. “The bedroom facing the front porch would be perfect.”
Intermittently, Dean sits and either reads from a yellow-paged cookbook or looks at him. Castiel never got the chance to marvel at the green of Dean’s eyes in Hell, and the flecks of gold dancing through his irises. Freckles dot his cheeks in strange patterns, bright from a lifetime spent fighting off sunburns to no avail. Strangely, Castiel wants to touch them, wants to count them while Dean dreams.
Sam wants to empathize with him, but Dean won’t let him.
The last ingredient is blood. Live blood, from a willing source. Gently, Castiel takes Dean’s hand and bears his palm. He presses the blade into one of the creases, and Dean tries to relax as Castiel slices, opening a wound. Together, they squeeze his fist over the bowl, letting blood spill onto the hex bag while Sam chants, setting it alight with a match. Before them, the map begins to sear, curling up at the edges as it burns to cinders, gradually revealing the location—a house in Fort Valley, about fifteen minutes from Flagstaff.
“I’ll tend to it as soon as we’re finished,” Castiel affirms. Delicately, he cuts an incision into his right palm without a trace of pain on his face. Dean, meanwhile, wants to scream. “I need you to touch your hand to mine to mingle our blood, then take my shoulder.”
At least here, he can eat whatever he wants and control the air conditioner.
Dean hadn’t. The most he ever saw of Bobby’s home was the bottom floor and the scrapyard, never the bedrooms.
Castiel shakes his head. “Not for who he might bring with him. I’m afraid we might need to take drastic measures.”
These days, the tears flow like wine, especially as the nights drag on. Across the marsh, Sam is probably wondering where he is. Or gone—honestly, Dean wouldn't put it past him to leave, after everything he’s put him through over the last few months. The drinking, the women, the one out-of-towner that pulled a gun on him afterward—all of it sits sour in his gut, weaker than the whiskey but still there, festering.
. Dean has had a thing for skaters for the better part of a decade, ever since he fell down the YouTube rabbit hole years ago and ended up binging multiple documentaries over a weekend. “He’s kinda uppity,” Dean concedes. “He wears cardigans, and he has this streaker coat in the closet, like the kind you sell knives out of on street corners. I kinda—” He stops, then blurts out the most horrifying jumble of syllables ever conceived, all of them jumbled together. “
, something Castiel can’t give to him. Angels don’t love like that. Angels don’t
. “Forgive me if I’m too forward.”
A shrug, nonchalant, like Castiel isn’t scheming. “It’d be a shame if we never went back to Kansas,” he says. Dean’s heart swells in his chest. “Maybe once or twice, to pack our things.”
Which, Dean knows, but Castiel wants him to learn, and Dean can’t help but be a dutiful student. “Go slow,” Castiel says. He strokes through Dean’s hair, then cups the back of his head.
“Normally my students procrastinate until the day before, but I admire you for your haste,” Castiel says, mirthful. The sheets rustle from the other side of the room; then, the mattress dips, and Dean’s stomach swoops when Castiel leans down to kiss his temple.
“Shut up,” Sam groans. “It’s not that big of a deal.”
“You should’ve,” Dean sighs. Gingerly, he rolls over to face Castiel, wincing until the strain in his ribs stops. Looking at him in the dim light, Dean aches to touch him, to comfort one of the only people in his life that’s looked at him and cared. He has gray around his temples, from a life lived too fast and ridden too hard. Nearly fifteen years apart, and Dean feels just as old some days. “I’m fine. Gonna be fine, just gotta rest and I’ll be back.”
Hanging his head, Castiel stifles a laugh. “What I did today hasn’t been done in several thousand years, Dean. It takes a toll on even the strongest of angels. If I were to expose myself like that…” He blinks. “I don't think I’d survive.”
“Don't.”
Only, Castiel’s limbs make it incredibly difficult for him to move. Somehow, he manages to extricate himself from Castiel’s tentacle-arms and crawl out of bed without making a sound. Cas, still asleep, drags Dean’s pillow into a crushing embrace that Dean practically feels in his spine. Who knew angels slept, nevermind tried to strangle people in their sleep.
“No,” Dean says, only to hear Castiel chuckle. “You know… You know why.”
“Have you looked for any cases today?” Sam asks, sounding hesitant.
Swallowing, Dean touches his cheek. “What do you want?”
“Ever?” Dean croaks.
Slow, Castiel lets out a breath through his nose. “All of your life, you’ve played the role of protector, of caretaker, and you’ve never had the opportunity to let someone look after you, to lay their life down for you in the way that you do for others.”
It takes him a minute, but Dean lifts his head, his knuckles white around his ribs.
, Castiel thinks, inexplicably saddened by the concept. What should bring him joy only terrifies him, even knowing that Dean loves him in return—because some day, they’ll hurt each other, and they’ll struggle to mend the pieces. But the pain is worth the joy in the aftermath, and Castiel will bear the weight if it means that Dean will stay by his side, always and forever.
Slow, Castiel lets out a breath. “I feel strange,” he says. Forehead to Dean’s shoulder, he brings his arms around Dean’s waist. “My heart hurts.”
But Dean is gone. Voices carry from down the stairs, two distinct men talking to each other, and a woman. Said woman, Castiel has known for eons. Stumbling out of bed, he pulls his dress shirt on and tucks it into his slacks, leaving his coat and hat atop the dresser. He tugs on his suit jacket, then leaves the room, making his way down the hall in bare feet. It’s the first time in ages since he stepped foot on earth without shoes, and it’s strange and a bit cold, but not unpleasant.
him. “Your little mutt have all her shots?”
“Marriage is a solemn vow.” Castiel steps closer, drawing Dean into a kiss. “It’s a commitment, to devote yourself to the one you love, to be with them through the triumphs and hardships. I feel after all we’ve been through, we might as well be.”
Blessedly, Castiel doesn’t disturb him for at least half an hour; meanwhile, Dean crawls under the covers and closes his eyes, listening to the soft clicks of Castiel’s keyboard. Across the hall, Ash’s stereo starts up, blasting today’s selection: Brooks & Dunn. What he wouldn't give to not know every word of every country song ever made. “You ever had country-fried steak?” Dean asks, refusing to uncover his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s not a ton of signals in town, so when it goes through neighborhoods, the driver just,” she stops to mimic slamming her hand on a horn. “Anyway. My mom’s a saint. She’s all about living your life how you want, and that’d be great if I wasn’t here.”
Pinning him to the mattress is easy, especially this early. Tossing the pillow aside, Castiel straddles Dean’s thigh just as Dean grapples with his shirt, rucking the fabric up to expose Castiel’s pecs. Heated, Castiel kisses down the line of Dean’s throat, palming his chest as he descends. Dean responds beautifully, his voice little more than a moan, his body arching into Castiel’s hands, aching for his touch. And Castiel feeds him, sucking kisses down his stomach as he sneaks beneath the sheets, until the darkness consumes him and all he knows is Dean’s warmth and skin—
Darkness. Silence. Then, screams.
That he cares, most of all.
Consciousness wanes as the night winds on. At some point, he ends up on the banks of a white-walled estate, with white columns and a massive porch on the second story, spanning the entire width of the home. Glass sliding doors on the bottom floor sit open, just like he left them. The wooden veranda looks on, draped in honeysuckle and smelling sweetly, so sweetly.
“Nah.” Dean snaps off his gloves and goes for a new pair. It’s a good look on him, latex or otherwise. “Had a guy the other day bleed all over me, decided to take a bunch of painkillers beforehand.” He sniffles and rolls over, machine in hand. “Kinda tired of all the blood.”
, Dean hears, and his heart swells. As a child, his mother always said that angels were watching over him. Now, Castiel is here, and Dean never wants to let him go.
He makes the few steps it takes to slide into the dormer. Castiel steps inside, and together, they sit facing one another, limbs tangled, knees and ankles and feet jammed into places they shouldn't be. Just because he can, he closes the curtains behind them, shrouding them in darkness, only accompanied by the rain outside and the chill in the air. Castiel shivers. Dean takes his hands, holding them between his knees.
Quietly, Castiel breathes. “I wish I could tell you the answer,” he says. “I wish I could tell you, to all things there is a season, but I’d be lying. All I can say is that the world is cruel and unjust, and the hand you’ve been dealt is similar to scores of others. But it’s still your life.” A pause. “I can’t imagine your pain, Dean.”
From their walk in and around the property, the house has three bedrooms upstairs, one with an en-suite bathroom and the other two splitting a jack-and-jill bath on the other side. Downstairs is the library, with its extensive collection of half-empty bookcases and wood-paneled walls, and a den on the far end, filled with dusty dining chairs and a table that hasn't been polished in a decade. The kitchen is fairly modern compared to the Bunker, with its updated appliances and stainless-steel sink, and granite countertops on every surface, even the island.
Dean sniffles. “He’s perfect. He’s…” Slow, Dean inhales until his lungs ache, then lets it out, the tension bleeding away. “Dad’d hate him.”
Castiel doesn’t answer—instead, he presses two dry fingers against Dean’s rim and
Dean shrugs and pulls out a plastic razor and several pairs of black gloves. His composure gives Castiel pause; the last time he saw Dean so focused was years ago, with the world crashing down around them. Now, he funnels that into what he can do with his hands, the blood washed clean for a long, long while. “I used to sketch,” he says, looking down at his lap. “Still do, but just—abstract stuff, to take my mind off things. Couple pictures of you, actually.” He rubs the back of his neck, his neck flushed. “Don’t think it’s a good coping mechanism, drawing your dead best friend.”
Speaking of. “Do you think they know I’m gone?” Dean asks. “I mean, every day for a hundred years, you’d think someone’s gonna miss me.”
Nothing works. Not until Sam walks in and nearly bites his tongue off, and Dean snaps awake and disentangles himself, accidently kicking Castiel onto the floor. “Shit, shit,” Dean mumbles, half-coherent, reaching for him over the edge of the couch. “Sorry—”
“Your suffering is over.” Castiel pulls him closer, just as a steady heat begins to build beneath his plating. Dean wants to burrow into him. “Do you trust me, Dean Winchester?”
It hurts, Castiel knows. Dredging up memories is always painful, and asking that of Dean is even worse. For a man who spent a century being violated in Hell, recalling how he ended up there is probably the worst sin imaginable. But Dean sighs, and talks, ignoring the tears in his eyes. “We were in a barn,” he says, head hung low. “Me and Sam, we’d spent a week in town trying to get the locals to talk, but it’s like it was some big secret. No one knew anything, and if they did, they slammed the door in our face.
And best—or worst—of all, Castiel sits back and lets him.
“Some days, it feels like hundreds,” Castiel mumbles. “Three brothers and two sisters. Amara’s very persistent when it comes to her clients. She has a series of commercials running in—”
. Castiel’s hips stutter, his rhythm gaining momentum until a final burst of Grace flashes, bright in the dark of the room. The cord snaps, and sparks dance across Dean’s vision, the candles extinguishing.
“I’m gonna drop out of school,” Dean whines. He at least has the forethought to put his hand down before he drops his head, muffling the thud. “I can’t do this, I can’t—How am I supposed to stay in the same room as him? I’ve never kissed a guy before. I’ve never even told anyone I liked guys. I took him out for breakfast, does that count as a date—”
Not Lyle, then. The IV in his hand proves that.
Dean takes one of the cleaner rags on the table and balls it up, holding it between his fists.
Bare feet smack against the wet floor. Dean’s presence comes into range long before his arms drape through the window, green eyes no doubt looking at him. But he receives no greeting, like he expects—no, Dean touches his head, then his shoulder, pushing him back into the seat. Fingers touch his forehead, wiping sweat away. Castiel can’t open his eyes. “Cas,” Dean says, urgent. “Cas, look at me, okay?” The door pops open; Dean reaches in, turning Castiel’s face.
The despair, the anguish, all from watching Castiel die. Whatever Castiel said to him, Sam can’t begin to fathom, and Dean won’t tell him specifics, but whatever it was destroyed him, left him without closure.
“And that stops it?” Dean asks. “The whole thing, Lucifer springing from the cage, you’re absolutely sure?”
Showering has become one of Castiel’s favorite activities. After weeks spent on the road and in the front seat of his truck, stepping under the warm spray has always made his efforts worth the pain.
In his fantasies, he wants Castiel to use him—to choke him on his cock, to fuck him over the kitchen counter until he screams. In his fantasies, he wants Castiel to come on his face, and Castiel fulfills that desire by pulling Dean back and stroking himself with a quick wrist. Dean matches his pace, water sloshing as he tugs his cock, the heat building to an abrupt crest. Castiel, thankfully, joins him, letting out a low, shuddering hiss as he spills across Dean’s lips, dripping down his chin. Caught in the moment, Dean sucks Castiel’s cock into his mouth, moaning around him as he twitches into his own hand, come slipping between his fingers and into the water.
Low in his throat, Castiel growls. The air in the room shifts, the faint scent of something and nothing hitting his senses, along with the sound of fabric against metal. Gentle, the tip of Castiel’s blade presses against his lip; Castiel nicks the skin as he pulls away, allowing blood to well and spill over. It stings, yet, Dean gasps, a shiver running straight through to his groin. “We share a common goal, you and I,” Castiel hums. “You don’t want the world to end, and I refuse to watch my greatest work die at the hands of Lucifer himself. We’re a team.”
“Kinda?” Dean busies himself with pulling his shirt over his head. Sitting up, Castiel feels up his chest like a magnet, lips latching onto his collarbone. Between them, Dean continues to stroke Castiel’s cock, shivering when precome begins to soak his palm. Too much to be male, or human, and briefly, he wonders if Castiel could fuck him raw like this, without prep or anything else. Past experience says otherwise. “Look, there’s—videos, on the internet, people buy toys to do this.”
What Dean feels isn’t love. It goes beyond that, deeper, richer. Castiel is tattooed on his body and soul, and now he’s dying, and Dean can’t live without him.
“Only that Bobby said he was in college again,” Castiel says, wary.
Dean scoots closer in his sleep, tightening his grip around Castiel’s waist. Heart full, Castiel kisses his forehead and brings Dean up against him, inhaling his scent, reveling in his soul as it reaches out to mingle with his Grace.
Whoever this man is, Castiel wants to know him. Wants to tell him that probably for the first time in his life, someone understands. Maybe he has his signals wrong, maybe he can’t quite pinpoint people anymore, but most of the time, his gut feeling proves right.
“Least you get to leave,” Dean mutters.
Later, maybe, if he can get Castiel into the shower. For now, Dean slicks him up and crawls over his lap. They should talk about condoms, or even safe words, but he foregoes it in favor of lining Castiel up and sinking down, so far down that Dean forgets where and when he is. His world narrows down to the white-hot pressure splitting him open and the hands cradling his hips, easing him down. “
Blood wells. She refuses to let go, not until Castiel pries her loose and presses his finger to the middle of her paw, exposing her claws. Dean, meanwhile, wipes his hand on his pants, pinching denim between his fingertips. “I don’t think we’re dating,” Castiel says, his eyes distant as he chooses his words. “We’ve been through much together, and we’re dedicated to one another. I rescued you from Hell, you rescued me from death. Time and time again,” he slips his hand beneath Dean’s shirt sleeve, fitting his hand over the silvered brand, “we’ve always been here.”
The nose of the canoe pressed to the grassy bank, Dean stumbles out, one foot submerged in the marsh, the other on dry land. Drunk as he is, he manages to pull his body from the water, only to fall to his knees, a few dozen feet away from home. Not even his home—abandoned for no reason at all, with all of the furniture still inside, with no name on the deed and no one to claim the land except him.
“Okay, okay.” Benny blessedly cuts him off, rising to his feet. Seated, Benny is a behemoth to look at, all broad shoulders and thick biceps. If he wanted, he could smash the wine bottle over Crowley’s head, and Castiel would let him. “I think we’ve had enough, lightweight. Ain’t exactly dinner conversation.”
Castiel doesn't say anything. Instead, he forcibly drags Dean off the ground and into his arms, a stilted hug if Dean has ever felt one. But Dean clings to him anyway, his arms around Castiel’s neck and his wet face tucked into the curve of his throat. The tension in Castiel’s arms lessens, and the weight around his waist grows softer, warmer in the sunlight. “Live,” he says, close to Dean’s ear. “You live, Dean.”
Castiel smiles. Resting an elbow atop the bar, he looks around, waiting for the opportune moment to touch Dean’s shoulder, or his face, but no such time comes. “It’s just an idea.”
“Take it,” Castiel says. “It’s yours.”
Castiel’s face falls, eyes half-lidded, lips parted into a sad smile. “I’m smarter than you let yourself believe,” he whispers. “I know you, Dean. I know your tactics, I know how your mind works. How when you want someone bad enough, you push them away just so you can’t be hurt later. But that’s the inevitable truth. We’ll hurt each other in so many ways, and you’re scared that one day, you’ll do something so… heinous, that I’ll leave. I don’t have any plans to leave your side, Dean.”
, he thinks, pinching his eyes shut.
“Nap later.” His nips turn to kisses, peppered across his shoulder and his wings. Castiel offers him space each time, expanding each wing to its full span while Dean nuzzles his face into them, content. “Just wanna spend time with you before Eileen gets here. I just… I just got you back.”
And out of the crowd and the blur of faces, Castiel sees a face. A stranger, but he’s young, with proud cheekbones and bright, vibrant green eyes. He dances with a woman, a beer in his hand and his shirt conspicuously missing, revealing an expanse of tattoos on his back and ribs, resembling wings. In the firelight, he makes out the freckles dotting his skin, spanning across his nose and arms, a few dusting his lips. Nice lips, full and soft, the kind that might lead to suggestive comments back home.
All for naught.
Still, that fear festers in the back of his head even as he touches himself. Gently at first, acclimating to the sudden pressure around his cock. A pressure that doesn't threaten to mutilate him, or worse. Eyes closed, Dean braces himself against the tile wall and lets the water drip from his face and down his back, then spiral down the drain. Shivers skitter up his spine, and his cock leaps in his grasp, desperate for friction.
For a long minute, Bobby doesn’t reply. Dean listens to the air conditioner in the corner instead, trying to calm down enough to open mouth without screaming. His ribs hurt. Bobby still has his pills. “You were there,” Bobby says, eventually. “Whole team knew you were there. It ain’t just a physical thing, son, it’s mental. Sam raced for you, and you helped him, whether you knew it or not. He spent damn near every day here when he wasn't at the track, him and Castiel.”
Dean lifts a brow. Not that they need a tractor for anything, but maybe it could help knock down the barn if he ever got the chance. “What’re the chances the cellar’s haunted?”
“I will.” Castiel’s hand slips to palm Dean’s nape, urging him in. “There’s nowhere that I’d rather be than here.”
“It’s fine,” Dean hisses.
A noise rips its way up from Castiel’s chest, sounding feral and strained. He comes almost on command, his feathers rippling, body drawn taut—then it snaps, and Castiel smothers his pleasure into Dean’s throat. Dean clenches around him as he joins in, his moans breathy and rich. Somehow, Castiel manages to rein in his Grace purely to the space around them, enveloping Dean in it as they wind down. The water slowly begins to chill around his feet, and Dean sags in his grip, his breaths evening out.
“Can I tattoo you?” Dean blurts before he can fully think about what his words mean. All at once, Castiel stops, and the bed shifts, the sheets falling from around their shoulders. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean spots Castiel looking down at him, lips parted with a question he can’t quite form. “Just—for practice, y’know. I’m still getting the hang of it.”
“I’m not opposed to it,” Castiel sighs. Leaning up onto an elbow, he touches his fingers to his throat, closing the wound. “What you want isn’t purely my essence, is it?”
The same Dean half-sprawled out on the floor, his pistol pointed toward the corner as he breathes, very much alive. Stepping inside, Sam looks in the direction of the gun, only to find Jack standing there, a hole in his white shirt but no blood visible. “Jack,” Sam mutters, winded, the blood rushing to his head all at once. Eileen holds him up, just barely. “You're—”
His throat bobs. “Cas,” he croaks, “I can’t… I can’t take your Grace.”
Red flashes across Dean’s cheeks as he rubs the back of his neck. “I still don’t know all the chords,” he mumbles. He downs half of his drink and shakes his arms out. “You think Tammy’s gonna take it off tonight?”
“Got enough on my plate as it is,” Dean mumbles. From his wallet, he fishes out a twenty and lays it on the table. “I’m not hungry.”
Under the table, Castiel palms his thigh, just out of sight. All the contact Dean needs to keep him sane, to keep him moving. “Sure this is something you wanna do?”
. Tentative, Dean reaches out to touch it, his mouth watering at the sight. Thick in a way that he’s only ever seen in porn, maybe not as long as his own, but certainly enough to get the job done. Idle, he strokes it, peeling the foreskin back to reveal the plummy head, dripping with precome and in desperate need of a good lick. He can’t help but push Castiel onto the mattress, slipping between his muscled thighs.
“No, no,” Dean begs. Boots squeak in an attempt to get away—something stomps, and Dean screams, an unending sound that bores into Castiel’s core. “Cas, Cas—”
“She told me about it,” Castiel says, sheepish. Dean squints, several questions on his tongue. “I met her when I was looking for flip flops. She may have jumped into the front seat of my car.”
“I’m here.” Castiel wipes the blood from Dean’s face, horrified at his swollen, bloodshot eye and the bite to his throat. All of it, he heals with a touch, watching Grace surge through Dean’s wounds until he glows. Afterward, Dean trembles and crawls into Castiel’s embrace; Castiel lets his wings free, wrapping the tattered mess of them around Dean. He smells like blood, like torment, but it’s over now. Dean is safe, and breathing, and Castiel refuses to let him go. “I’m here, Dean.”
Again, Castiel nudges his foot. Softer now, no longer trying to shut him up. “You don’t have to tell me,” he says. “I’m only here for a semester, and I have several people from other counties that I’m supposed to interview. I won’t ask you to be a participant.”
One of the nurses give him a cup of ice while another checks his vitals, scribbling notes furiously onto a clipboard. All the while, a man watches him from the chair in the corner, a hand over his mouth and tears in his eyes. A look Dean has always hated to see on his face.
One day, he’ll get back in the car, just to take Baby out for a drive, or to pile everyone in and find the next hunt. Probably next week, considering how antsy he feels just sitting around, but he has another few days to relax, to bask in the sheer concept of having nothing to do, and a place to do it in. The sun travels idly in the sky, the clouds drift by with the breeze, and everything just… makes sense.
“Was wondering when you’d show up,” Dean laughs the minute Castiel catches up to him. He brushes their shoulders together, and Castiel sways back into him, delighting in the smile Dean offers. “C’mon, tell me. How’s the weather?”
“I’m… better than I expected,” Castiel says, eventually. His eyes betray him, though. “The more I speak to people, the harder it is for me to believe that things will ever change. The more I look at you and I see your hurt, I wonder if it’ll ever get any easier. It’s a wonder you can live with the pain, and I… admire you, for your bravery, for facing a world that doesn’t appreciate you.”
, he corrects himself, once again jostling Dean to the side.
Rowena shushes him with a soft breath. Kneeling, she pulls him against her, his head pressing into the front of her dress. She’s warm, so unlike Castiel, so unlike his heart, now shattered like the wings he left behind. “You did what you had to,” she says, petting through his hair. “I’d do the same, if it were someone I loved.”
. Dean reaches down and shoves his hand into his briefs, his moan reverberating through Castiel’s cock. Castiel sucks in a gasp and shoves both hands in Dean’s hair. Another day, they can take it slow, and Dean can really guide Castiel into it; just the thought of another day, one with more
A breath. Then, “This.”
“It’s beautiful,” Castiel says, to Dean’s nod. “How long have you lived here?”
The corner of Castiel’s lips turn upward, just barely. “I’d be worried if you weren’t. Are you alright?”
Castiel tilts his head. “Why?”
“And that’s the shitty thing about it.”
“Really?” Dean scans the room and finds it hanging next to a machete, its blade broken in half and probably riddled with tetanus.
Sam nods, smiling ever so slightly. “Yeah. Sounds good.”
“Am I pregnant?” he asks, only half-joking.
“You’re suggesting we draw them here,” Castiel says, and Dean nods. “Dean, what you’re asking for is—”
“Yeah.” Dean pats his shoulder. “Well, the guest room’s free ‘til you find a place. Or if you don’t, it’s still there.”
“You never know.” Penny smiles again and pats his cheek. “You be good, now.” As she begins to walk, she stops and offers Castiel a heartfelt hello and continues her walk, making her way around the stalls until she leaves the room.
Said fangs gleam as Alastair leers at him, his white eyes ecstatic. “Angel,” he purrs, making his way to his feet. From the floor, Dean tips his head back, panic on his face. “And here I thought you’d sit there and be a good boy while I defile your plaything.”
. Dean can’t help but touch his hair, the soft strands more tangible than anything else in the room. Because Castiel is here—Castiel found him. “Cas,” he whispers. “Cas…”
He waits for the traffic light to turn red before he jogs across the intersection, barely a car in sight. Purely because he can, he runs his fingers across the rear fender of the Chevrolet, steel warm from the sun. A spark of something rises to greet him. Impossible—cars aren’t sentient—but this one, he feels, knows him, understands him. “Hello,” he whispers and slides his hand up the gradual rise of the roof. She’s well-taken care of, as she should be.
, so foreign yet so natural, now festering, blooming, making a home in his chest.
Dean sniffles and palms his eye. “I never got baptized,” he mutters. “Dad used it as a weapon, said it’d wash the sin out of me. Said he’d send me somewhere, and I never… You’re the first guy I’ve kissed. But he thinks I’m on my knees for every guy I’ve ever met, and it doesn’t—It don’t work like that, man. Sure, like, the high school quarterback was smokin’ hot, but it’s not like I was blowing him in the locker room. Jesus Christ.”
A tighter squeeze, a harder glare. “I’d understand,” Sam says. “Look, Dean. Sometimes, we have to do things we don’t want to, things we might even regret later, but in the end, it’s worth it if we come out the other end. You said it, you were trying to save Cas, and I know I’d do the same for you. But that doesn't mean it’s not messed up that it happened.
Castiel considers that as Dean leaves. He dresses in his clothes from earlier and a pair of black socks, now that he can. His Grace has finally stemmed the flow of blood, but the wounds still remain.
“Don’t know what to tell you,” he sighs. Pulling his shirt on, he stands and scrubs his face. No blood, and no smudge on his forehead, like Castiel thought he was Simba about to inherit the kingdom. Thankfully, after all these years, the shower still has excellent water pressure. “You said it yourself, I’m… special, or whatever. But soulmates, man, that’s… That never happens.”
“It doesn’t concern you,” Castiel says, a flat out lie if Dean has ever heard one. “You severed my connection to my home, Dean. You took the one thing from me that made me an angel—”
“It wasn't just a wreck.” Sitting up, Dean wheezes through his teeth.
It took longer this time, to wake up. But normally, he can’t feel in his dreams. Most of the time, he sees shadows and hears voices, but they never try to touch him, never fully speak his name.
“Not exactly how you’d want to start your semester,” Castiel says. “How was teaching yesterday?”
“Yeah.” Blowing out a breath, Charlie glances at the radio. “See, I never really had that kinda tension with my folks, after the whole…” She waves her hand, a sad expression falling over her face. “My dad died in a car crash when I was twelve, right down the street on the railroad tracks. You ever wonder why you hear the horn blaring at two in the morning?”
“We’d like to promote you from angel to Dominion,” Naomi says. Blasé, almost bored. Meanwhile, Castiel can’t breathe. “Depending on how you handle your new position, you may be allowed to keep it. But for now, it should be enough to subdue Alastair’s army, and possibly him.”
Switching off the burner, Dean turns his back to grab three plates from the cabinet. The toaster pops just in time, and he grabs all four slices of toast before heading back to the stove. Sam watches him load up the plates with bacon and sausage and scrambled eggs, all things they shouldn't be eating at their age, but until he can make it to the grocery store today, it’s all he has. Sam may claim to eat healthy, but that all flies out the window as soon as Dean gets his hands on a spatula, always has.
All the while, Castiel strokes him, taking note of Dean’s breath and the flex of his fingers. “It might have been counterproductive to our objectives,” Castiel hums. Slicking his fingers, he presses his thumb to the head of Dean’s cock, rubbing the slit until he moans. “I saw the look in your eyes, and I felt how much you wanted me, but I couldn't give you what you wanted. You wanted to be owned by me, you wanted to be on your knees for me—”
“I have patience,” Castiel mumbles. He turns his wrist, and Dean’s lips part, eyes hooded. “You’re just a master of temptation.”
Stepping back, Naomi gives the three of them a nod before disappearing in a flutter of wingbeats. A few feathers float to the floor, and Bobby takes the time to pick them up, gathering them into a bundle. Skeptical, Dean grabs the hot sauce and douses his eggs with it. Anger furrows his brow. “You on babysitting duty, Cas?”
Nothing works. Desperately, Castiel attempts to shove him in the direction of the cellar, but Alastair is a step ahead, instead spinning Castiel every chance he gets. “You’re gonna lose,” Alastair hisses, seizing Castiel’s throat. “You’re gonna sit here and watch while I rip him apart piece by piece, and I’ll make sure that he forgets you. I’ll be the one he loves, I’ll be—”
“Castiel,” she announces and opens her arms, baring her palms. Two slits open, revealing eyes. “My name is Iofiel. I come bearing news in Naomi’s place.”
. Dean’s knees wait approximately three seconds before they give out, right in front of Castiel. Forehead to the mattress, he kneels, heart clenching when Castiel touches his hair. Tentative, soft—forgiving. “I’m sorry,” he mutters. “But you started accusing me, and I—I was trying to save your life. I thought, if you lived, then it’d be okay, but…”
Sam’s brow softens. “You shouldn't feel guilty. You were doing what you could to save him.”
“Yeah, well, someone pulled a few strings for me,” he laughs. Standard interview procedure, but he means it. Someone pulled off a miracle, and part of him thinks it’s got something to do with the man sitting next to him. “No, but really, I wanna thank all the fans out there with their messages, and I wanna thank my crew and everyone who stayed by my side in the hospital. Definitely wouldn't be here without all of them.”
Stephanie cradles her shoulder. “Dean is in good hands, Mrs. Winchester. He’s in recovery now, and you’ll be able to see him soon.”
Castiel takes it and sits back in the chair, propping it up in his lap. The longer he looks through it, the more Castiel wonders how Dean got into this profession, if he devalues himself so greatly. What Dean thinks is horrible, Castiel considers a masterpiece, from stylized phoenixes to tigers, from watercolor sunsets to pets. In the back, he keeps several pages of his completed work, all of them painstakingly done over minutes or hours. “You never told me you could draw,” Castiel says.
As Castiel grips the handle of his sword, the pommel bursts, exploding into light. A blue fire erupts from the blade as Castiel swings, slicing through each of the demons with ease. It’s too easy—at least, until the next wave comes, leaving Dean to sprint through the labyrinth of the junkyard and Castiel to field off more substantial numbers of demons. These, he can handle—but in the distance, all Castiel hears is shouts and bursts of gunshots.
.” Castiel taps his lip with the tip of his nail. “This is a holy act. It wouldn't kill you to treat it as such.”
A small smile crosses Castiel’s lips. “I’m glad they’re happy,” he says, then squeezes Dean tighter. “I couldn't feel you, if you prayed. Where I was, the Shadow kept me quiet, complacent. I’m not sure what brought me back.”
Low, Dean laughs, sounding all too brittle. So unlike the man he left behind. The man in front of him now might as well be a fleeting memory of someone he once held dear, only to be left broken and hollowed out. Proof of love, ripped from his hands.
Dean wants to laugh. Wants to say it couldn’t have happened to a better person, but instead, he weeps, silent and soundless. Gentle thumbs brush away his tears, and lips press to his temple, too tender to be real. “I want my mom,” he sobs. Castiel shushes him, cradling his cheek. “Cas, I want my—”
Dean joins him on the mattress shortly after, hair toweled dry and his heart anxious. Castiel faces him, his legs crossed, coat pooled around his waist. He looks softer here, more approachable when Dean can barely see his face. Inexplicably, he wants to touch Castiel, to see if he feels any different when no one’s looking. Part of him wonders if Castiel would let him—the other half knows he would.
Not because of the sheer amount of layers he wears, but because of how much he fights it. Every time, he deflects Dean’s attempts to get into his pants and makes it a priority to get Dean naked, solely for the purpose of a hand job, or to suck Dean off like his life depends on it. Why Castiel won’t
Castiel follows him without a word. Silent, they climb the stairs and head off into the night, the air dry and heated. Dean left on bare feet, and Castiel didn’t think to grab his shoes. Together, they head down the road on the east side of Lebanon, unpaved and pitted with rocks. Dean winces on occasion, brushing the pebbles from his instep.
“I might put some lights up,” Dean says, bringing Castiel’s fingertips to his lips. “Y’know, those little string lights, just something so I can see you when I look at you.”
“Awful, yeah,” Dean laughs. Hopefully as soon as they connect to some halfway decent Wi-Fi, he can check to see if anyone’s called him. “Anyone up for lunch? Somewhere better than IHOP, where we have to dress up just to get in.”
Maybe the Grace makes him reckless, or bold. Maybe it’s that Castiel doesn’t stop him. Whatever the reason, Dean kisses him again and again, until Castiel learns to kiss back just as fervently, his hands anywhere and everywhere all at once. The sword comes into play at some point, the cold steel pressing into Dean’s hand.
At the time, Dean didn't question it. Didn’t think much of it until he woke up with Castiel’s arms around him and a cat purring into his ear, like Castiel forgot his need for space and gave up waiting. For once, Dean doesn’t complain and savors the memory, wanting desperately to crawl back into bed with him. But he can’t sleep—can’t sit still, and Castiel needs to rest.
The sheets rustle on the other bed. Sam sits in front of him, a knee pulled up onto the mattress. “You think I don’t get it?” he asks. Dean shakes his head, the words dying in his throat. “I know you told me and Bobby, and I think Cas knows too, about you. But Dean, he’s a wreck. I haven’t seen someone panic like that since I crashed out last year and didn't pull my net down fast enough. Even if he does have feelings for you, isn’t that—isn’t that a good thing? I mean—”
Lebanon comes into view shortly before eleven, its streets dusty and empty, save for the one or two cars traveling to and from the market in the middle of town. Castiel bypasses them all and heads in the direction of the bunker; he pulls into the garage, the door slung open and the concrete floor soaked, water running down the drain. A man slings a soapy sponge over the Impala’s trunk, suds flying.
Castiel nods, the words dying on his tongue. Dean steps into the master bathroom and closes the door, leaving Castiel to wander the room. He sits at the edge of the bed and toes his loafers into the carpet, unsure whether to take them off or leave them on. In case Dean asks him to leave. But Dean drove him all the way here, nearly an hour from the city—telling him to leave now would be cruel.
“You don’t know what you’re doing,” she shouts, her white eyes dyed red as blood streams down her face. “You’re gonna ruin everything. This isn’t part of the plan!”
Said feeling grows stronger when the man looks over at him, the brightness in his eyes hardening, jaw set square. He leaves the throng of bodies and disappears into the makeshift parking lot, sidling over to stand mere inches from Castiel’s shoes. He reeks of alcohol and smells like burning pines, and probably runs just as hot. Any other state, and this would be a proposition, but he’s angry, like he could pick a fight at any second.
, he berates himself. No matter how hard he tries, his eyes continue to sting, and the agony of living finally catches up with him.
“It’s the simple things that bother people the most,” Castiel says. “I feel if Alastair would’ve presented you to him, Lucifer might’ve freed you. But at what cost? At that point, you would’ve been broken, and I fear that if you were brought back to your earthly body, you might’ve killed yourself the minute you woke.”
Vegas. The last thing Dean wants right now is to show up in a wheelchair, and Sam wants him to hop on the bus and go to
But why, is the question Castiel wants answered. And he has a sneaking suspicion that Dean won’t ever answer.
He isn’t back there in that barn. He isn’t in Hell, not anymore.
As soon as she vanishes, Dean slumps. Castiel catches him before he can fall to the floor, holding him up by his bicep. Dean gravitates toward him, his hands shaking at his sides, and Castiel wishes he could take Dean from here. But the store is vast, and getting out without Dean crying will be a feat. “Dean…”
. “Think you’d look cool with one,” he says instead. Hiding his face doesn’t work, not with Castiel looking down at him, seeking all of Dean’s attention. Very rarely has he ever felt small in Castiel’s presence, but now, he might as well be an ant under a microscope. “How can you still… Is it really worth it? You could… You could start over, do whatever you wanted to do. You said you were happy just loving me.”
“No, it’s—Of course I wanna teach.” Sitting up, Dean leans his elbows atop her desk. “It’s not that, it’s…” He stops, inhales. His eyes sting. “No, it’s just… I got a new roommate.”
Dean and Castiel sit at a corner table, away from the few people in the diner but close enough to the door that if they had to run, they could make a break for it. Compared to a few hours ago, the morning is calm, without the threat of violence hanging over his head or looming shadows in the corners. Their waitress greets them with a caffeinated smile and takes their orders, and brings back two large coffees and a stack of pancakes as big as Dean’s head. Definitely a splurge, but sometimes, Dean can’t shake his desire for pancakes that don’t taste like last night’s grease left on the griddle.
“Don’t need help,” Dean mumbles, bleary and half-asleep. Somehow, he walks, despite dragging his feet and cursing under his breath. “Can walk just fine.”
He should call 911, or a neighbor—but it only then dawns on him that he left his phone at the dorm, where Castiel is wondering and waiting. He doesn’t need it, not now. Maybe later, but not now.
Soft, Castiel smiles. “I’d like that.”
Castiel takes a step forward—but the vampire lifts a finger, bloodshot eyes locked on Dean. “I want him alive,” the thing says in a voice reminiscent of nails in a grinder. “I have a bounty that I’d like to have paid.”
Dean makes a noise that sounds somewhere between choking and laughter. “You’re James Milton?”
Shiloh leads him into the church, the interior empty and the pews pushed up against the walls. It smells like mold and mildew, like someone has been sleeping inside at night and urinating in the corners. “My grandpa used to come here,” Shiloh explains, his hands in his pockets as he walks toward the pulpit. The floorboards squeak. Castiel sits beneath the altar, stretching his legs out. “Was one of the only few churches that let black folk in back in the day.”
Sunday passes in a blur of movement and voices and the glow of fluorescent bulbs. Around him, the sound of families chatting slowly comes into focus, and the lights brighten, no longer dull and distant. Occasionally, someone—a nurse, maybe—comes to check on him, to tell him how the surgery is going, but Castiel can barely hear her, can barely see anything other than the blood on his hands and his shirt.
Eleven in the evening. He should’ve gone with Sam, but the part of him that doesn’t listen to reason controls his actions tonight, along with the part of him that needs someone physical in his bed. Said someone climbs out of the passenger seat of the Impala, coat smattered in blood. Dean unlocks the room at the far end of the motel and steps inside, into a white-walled cinderblock room that could double as a modern-day bedroom, sans cheap bedspreads.
“I don’t think I’d advise it,” Castiel says with the slightest bit of humor. “Most collections are only worth what someone will pay. This, though,” he holds out the book to Dean, a finger resting over a coin marked
Mary blinks. “Real bulls?”
Dean can’t help but laugh until his lungs ache. “Welcome to rural Georgia. Everything’s straight.”
Rural Kansas smells different than Los Angeles.
Tucked in a corner booth, Dean picks at his thumb while Castiel looks over the menu, the laminate fraying at the edges. The vinyl tabletop isn’t any better, checkered in black-and-white and sticky no matter how many times it’s cleaned. Dean knows from experience, his nights in his late teens spent bussing tables and mopping floors after closing. Half a decade since, and they still haven’t spent the money to replace anything.
Because John Winchester hit the barriers separating pit lane from the track at full speed in qualifying six years ago. Dean watched it happen from the grandstands—Sam refuses to this day to watch the video, and Dean doesn’t blame him one bit. John loved racing, but he lived with the fear that all drivers do, that the next race might be their last. Dean ignored it, pushed it down so deep he sometimes forgot it existed. But it was there, ever since the moment he took John’s ashes home and placed them in the family plot.
Castiel looks up, fork between his teeth. “Are you asking me out to dinner?”
Castiel shushes him, fitting his palm to Dean’s cheek. That same blue-white flame flickers into his vision, and all at once, Dean is there again, floating in the vacuum of a void, surrounded by those familiar eyes and the incomprehensible wheels. The fire glows over his stomach, and Dean has half a mind to smother himself in it. “You’re with me,” Castiel says—booms, coming at him from all angles but deadened. “Hell couldn’t show you an angel’s true visage, because the only ones who’ve seen an angel have perished.”
“Hey.” Dean points his knife. “They had fangs and moved like werewolves. Might as well call ‘em as I see ‘em.”
“Why haven’t you shown us?” Sam asks, barely coming up for air.
Oh, right, his tape recorder. “That’s up to you,” Castiel mentions. “We could either continue talking, or you can opt out. You’ll still receive compensation.”
At the height, Dean slows to a glacial stop, licking the Grace from Castiel’s lips. Want burns in Castiel’s gut, and no matter what he does, Dean refuses to move. “’M gonna come if I don’t stop,” Dean mumbles into a kiss, spurring a laugh from Castiel’s chest. “How do you stand it?”
. “We killed it, but it took too long, and he’s… He’s fine. Really, he’s okay, but I don’t think he’s processing it. Whatever he saw when was gone, it really got in his head.”
“You kidding?” Turning, Dean draws a foot up onto the bumper. “They’re wings, man. And they’re attached to you. What’s not great about that?”
. Still, it haunts him, and he finishes earlier than he intended, nearly leaving off the weekend’s reading assignment in his haste. He waits until the last student leaves, and proceeds to jog across the campus toward the faculty parking lot without catching anyone’s notice.
“Don’t pity me,” Castiel says. His voice shakes, just the slightest bit agitated. “Don’t lie to me.”
What he finds is an angel, strung up to the rafters by crane hooks through the bones of its pitch-black wings, wrists tied and hoisted up above its head. Dean’s stomach leaps into his throat, and by the power of sheer determination, he manages to keep bile from coming up. Not just any angel—an angel he’s known for nearly a decade, pale and barely breathing, if at all, stripped down to nothing with runes carved into his feet and hands. A burn decorates his right hip, scorching where once, he bore a tattoo.
. “Okay,” he says. Low and soft, so utterly sweet. Dean will never tire of hearing his voice for as long as he lives. “Okay, Dean.”
Nights in South Dakota are cold, even in May. Even with the window closed, the chill still seeps in, permeating everything it touches. Downstairs, Bobby has a space heater, a large contraption that could set the house on fire if left unattended. They can’t bring it upstairs, likely because of the size of the thing, but Castiel finds he doesn’t care about it, not while Dean clings to him in the middle of the night, limbs tangled and bodies pressed close.
“You don’t know me.” Dean sniffles. His hands hang limp at his sides. “All you know’s my name.”
Unfortunately, Dean knows. And as much as he wants to believe it, the part of him that thrives on anger controls his decision making, destroys his reasoning. With all of his being, he wants to believe Castiel, but Sam is in the wind and Dean still can’t see clearly out of his right eye. The bruise has set in nicely; no matter how many times Castiel offers to heal it, Dean refuses.
In hindsight, maybe he’ll remember what actually happened—how Adam brake-checked him and how Dean slammed straight into him, the front end of his car crumpling. He’ll remember someone got up under his rear bumper and sent him airborne, how the grandstands had never looked closer than they were when he slammed front-first into the wire fencing. In the moment, though, all he hears is the crunch of metal and sees the light of the Daytona sun bearing down on him, brighter than ever.
“It’s already weird,” Castiel counters. Dean laughs and tries to hide his face.
Castiel smiles, ducking his head. “I can’t tell if you mean my personality or my wings.”
Dean snorts, and Castiel’s pulse quickens when Dean’s hands come to rest on his waist. “Looking forward to it then,” he says, mirthful. “Just… so many things.”
“Good deal,” Sam says. “Cable guy’s gonna come tomorrow.”
No one is left to care, anymore.
And with a nod, both Hannah and Naomi vanish in a flurry of wings, leaving behind a few feathers in their wake. Only after they disappear does Dean breathe, collapsing into the sheets. “Boundaries, dude,” he wheezes. “At least wake me up if we’re gonna have visitors.”
Dean shakes his head. “Vamps are human. Those were… I don’t know what they were. Hybrids or some shit, like some horror movie’s wet dream.” He stops, blinking away the tears clinging to his lashes. “Alastair put a hit out on me.”
“For me,” Castiel says, strained. He speeds up, both hands to Dean’s hips as he thrusts, deeper,
“Vamps,” Dean finishes. “They get ‘em young and feed for a while, then when the kids are on death’s door, that’s when they’ll turn them.”
“Like you got room to talk,” Dean grunts in return. “I’ve had better nights with my right hand—”
Dean falls for him in that one kiss, shaking with how much he wants this, wants more of it, never wants it to stop—
“We will.” Castiel’s arm snakes around his waist, mindful of his ribs. Dean scoots closer, hiding his face under Castiel’s chin. “I want you here, Dean. I want you to do whatever you can to win, but if you don't think you can do it anymore, then we’ll work it out, and I’ll be with you every step of the way.”
Damn—
Shoveling down his excuse for food, Dean throws back half of a water bottle and slams the door shut. From what he can see, no other buildings sit in the general area, aside from a toolshed to the right of the house. Branches litter the yard and the tree line from last night’s storm, and an entire pine sits sideways, blocking a walking path on the other side of the clearing. It’s a lead—an excuse to get moving. But his legs feel like lead, and his heart pounds, beating out a litany of ‘what ifs’ against his ribcage.
It’s quiet. And with frustration roiling in his gut, Castiel crawls out of bed and folds the quilt over his arm. Gingerly, he steps across the hardwood floors and makes his way to Dean’s room, turning the knob without a sound. Inside, Dean sleeps on his side, turned toward the moonlight shining through the slit in the curtains. Like so many motels across the country, so many rooms where he watched over Dean while he rested.
It doesn’t help, and even after it’s over, after the screams stop and Castiel unlocks the door, Dean still can’t look him in the eye. “You hit me,” Dean says after what feels like hours, seated in Bobby’s chair. Sam lies across the couch, a wet washcloth over his eyes and his hands folded across his stomach. “You punched me and ran.”
“Is he outside again?” Eileen asks, wandering over to Sam’s side. Looking out into the grass, her brow softens in something close to pity.
It only amps up Dean’s fear more, until he can barely breathe with it. “Yeah,” he says, head down. He shuts off the nightstand lamp and strips out of his sweats before kneeing his way onto the mattress. His skin crawls, heart in his throat; he should ignore the urge, should ignore the sudden wave of
They should get up and leave—should do anything other than sit there laughing, but Dean can’t find it in himself to ruin the moment, to look anywhere other than the lake and his family at his side. Their home isn’t going anywhere, and the rest of the world can wait.
With the motorcycles on the hauler behind the van, they leave—Sam leading the way with Dean trailing and Castiel in his rearview.
“They’re not relationships,” Dean corrects. “Well, I mean, they are, but they’re not… It’s never really worked out. Not for long, anyway.”
Castiel slides into the passenger seat a few minutes later, a plastic container of oversized cupcakes in hand. The second he closes the door, Dean leans over to kiss him, tasting the coffee on his tongue. A snowflake falls; he hopes they can make it out of town before the bottom falls out, or, the sun shines, whichever comes first. “She really likes you, huh?”
Dean knows, though. Somewhere in the back of his head, he knows the hounds dragged him to Hell.
Beneath the waves, Castiel squeezes his hands.
He shouldn't want Castiel as bad as he does, but he
The road between WaKeeney and Lebanon is barren, nothing but fields and sand and the blue sky stretching endlessly past the horizon. Castiel drives with the windows down, an arm hanging over the edge and a hand on the wheel. His palms begin to sting the further he drives. The minutes tick on, and sweat beads from his temple. His palms slip on the leather. Nothing unusual.
“We don’t have to right now.” Leaning on his elbows, Castiel drops a kiss to Dean’s temple, then his lips, delighting when Dean gives in so easily. “I’m more than willing to wait.”
He blanks. The last time he had a hobby was when he was a teenager, obsessed with collecting rocks and tumbled glass from the beaches along the coast. He still has some of them in a small box in his suitcase, ranging in a variety of colors. Other than that, the rest of his life has been spent in the classroom or behind the screen of a computer, pursuing a career none of his family approves of.
When all is said and done—when the Bunker is packed and the key left in Jody’s hand—they leave town, their belongings stuffed into the back of a Ryder van and their wheels pointed south.
Rather than reply, Dean nods. “Don’t stop,” he says—begs, really, if Dean would let himself call it that.
“Yeah.” Again, Dean cleans his forehead, then his eyes. “You ever heard of an angel getting stigmata?”
, only because the Men of Letters didn’t know what they had in their possession. In fact, they owned one of the few angel-killing blades not created by God, but by a witch with a temper. With a polished ivory handle, it fits in his hand with ease, the blade itself about six inches long and slightly wider before the tip where it rapidly tapers to a point. He hands it to Dean, who admires it, twirling it between his fingers.
Castiel isn’t in their room when Dean returns later in the evening, despite his laptop and a wide array of textbooks strewn across his bed. Setting his bag down, Dean pulls the curtains closed against the afternoon light. Cool air envelops the room, cooling the sweat sticking to his skin as he sprawls out. His back twinges, exhaustion prickling the corner of his eyes.
“It’s like I’m… I’m stuck. My whole family’s here, my friends are here. Everything I’ve ever known. How am I supposed to give that up?” A sigh. “But these people, if they knew… I know what they think. I’ve sat through the sermons. I know I’m going to Hell for—”
, he thinks,
Castiel fits a hand over Dean’s shoulder, pushing him onto his back. A knee pushes between his legs as Castiel straddles a thigh, both elbows bracketing Dean’s head. It’s intimate—it’s
How he made it this far, he doesn’t know. But he fights, slaughtering everything that attempts to attack him, despite the gashes in his wings and the gouges in his armor. Blood paints his vision, the world tinted red amid the fire and sulfur.
He should go. In his pocket, his phone sits silent. Sam gave up on him too long ago to care where he is anymore. If he’s lucky, Sam will be gone, and Dean can take the pistol he keeps in the nightstand and drown his sorrows one last time. No one will know.
“I know,” she says. “He’s always been strong, but he shouldn't have to be. He tries so hard to be who John thinks he needs to be, but he’s… I just want him to come home. And I want that man out of my house.”
Dean shrugs, looking down.
What he decides on is yanking Castiel’s shirt out of his pants. Castiel watches him, frantic, as Dean shifts down the bed and comes face to face with Castiel’s crotch. Experimentally, Dean runs his palm up the length of Castiel’s dick, still soft but beginning to fill out. “Tell me you want this,” Dean rasps.
sits on his tongue.
couldn't. And now there’s a price on my head, and I’ve got demons clawing after me, and… What am I supposed to do? I’ve only ever fought one demon, and I’m… I’m not strong enough. I don’t know what you see in me, but I’m not the man you think I am. I barely survived Hell, and now they wanna drag me back. I didn't… I didn’t do anything.” A sniffle. “I just wanna be normal. Fuck hunting, I just… I wanna live, man. And I can’t do that if I’m gonna be living in fear for the rest of my life.”
? The longer he thinks on it, the more the dark spot in his mind grows. Vaguely, he remembers arriving to the track, but after that, nothing. No driver’s introductions, no formation lap—just blank space. “Did I wreck?” he asks, horrified to know the answer.
Right. Another thing to feel guilty over, and it wasn’t his fault. He swears some days, the entire team of John Winchester Racing is cursed.
He drops the lit matchbook, and the sigil roars into flame. At first, Castiel hears nothing—then, the earth quakes, and Dean pulls out a pistol, backing away. Inside of the seal, the ground gives way, dropping into a pit where multiple creatures pour free, heading straight for them. Humanoid, but with clawed hands and beady black eyes. Lower level demons, the kind of creatures Castiel encountered in the halls of Alastair’s torture complex. Dean takes out two with one shot, their bodies combusting into dust the second it touches their skin.
“I know,” Castiel says. “Go back to bed.”
“No,” Dean snaps, then backtracks. “Look, I’m—If there’s even a chance that he’s out here, then I’m gonna find him. Like hell am I gonna leave him out here to die.”
. This, Dean can give him, without question.
“No.” Stepping away, Mary faces him, her arms wrapped around her stomach. “We haven’t been happy for years, honey. He’s trying to make it work, but all I can think about is what he’s done to this family. He drove your brother off the minute he graduated high school, and he kicked you out, and now—” She stops and lowers her hands, cupping him around the slight swell to her stomach that Dean initially missed. “I didn’t want another child after Sam.”
“It was for a moment,” Castiel chuckles.
Dean nods, shoving a section of pancakes and eggs in his mouth. The last thing Dean needs is to be left alone, especially based on the last two days. Whether or not he would’ve survived this long is a question doesn’t want answered. Watching over Dean is one thing, but keeping him sane is an entirely different conversation.
Sam knows the feeling, and sincerely wishes he didn't. “You live for them,” he says, and feels Dean nod. “You just… You gotta keep moving. Because the more you think about it, the more you dwell on everything you missed out on, when you should remember the time you had together.”
Knees folded to his chest, Castiel buries his head under his arms, breathing, existing. It won’t be long. The human body can only survive three days without water, and he suspects that if he tried to drink anything here, he might die on the spot.
, he thinks,
“Dean,” Castiel pouts, his eyes sad. “You didn’t tell me you planned to murder it.”
Someone knocks. Dean pulls the sheets tight, like the man-shaped lump underneath isn’t enough of a giveaway. “Dean?” a familiar voice calls out. Not Sam, but younger, and Castiel’s heart jumps, his blood freezing in his veins. “Dean, have you seen Castiel?”
Dean nods, scratching his chest. Castiel sits next to him, nearly dropping the plate when Dean kisses his cheek, then his lips. His soul flashes, reaching out, and Castiel allows it to curl into his Grace, comforting it the only way he knows how. “Sam’s never mastered breakfast,” Dean mumbles, taking the plate. He pokes around the eggs with a fork, the hunger visible in his eyes, but the want no longer there. “He’ll make a mean brunch, but he can’t scramble eggs worth a damn.”
Turn three comes faster than Dean anticipates, and he pumps the brake, his foot thudding into the footwell. Nothing happens. Again and again, he slams the pedal down, and his car continues speeding, nearly colliding with Adam and sending him into the wall. “We got a situation down here,” Dean announces, pulling off the accelerator enough to coast as he enters turn four. Adam catches up again, barely an inch between them. “I got no brakes.”
, the sky no longer composed of atoms and particles of stardust.
And he runs before he can even bother to finish his sentence. Sitting up, Dean wraps an arm around Castiel’s hip, pressing his nose into the meat of his shoulder. Castiel places a kiss in his hair, pulling Dean into a real hug, chest to chest, skin to skin. The warmest Dean has been in weeks, and the most at ease, like with Castiel here, a part of him can finally begin to heal.
“You would’ve needed to make a deal with a crossroads demon,” Castiel continues, and Naomi nods. “Those deals leave a mark behind, but you’re clean.”
“I mean, I kinda wanna know.” On quick feet, Shiloh comes over to sit a few inches from Castiel’s shoes. “I kissed a boy last week.”
Ashamed, Castiel bows his head. “I’m not my parents, Dean. I don’t condone anything they’ve done in the past or they do now.” He sucks in a breath and lets it out, letting the anger dissipate. “What they’ve done isn’t a secret, but this is exactly why I came here.”
Maybe it’s not the Grace he craves after all—maybe it’s Castiel himself, and his lips whenever he kisses Dean’s temple, his hand whenever he soothes the mark with his palm. It feels like affection—it feels less like lust and more like something Dean can’t quite begin to name. Foreign, but familiar. A four-letter word that’s rarely ever left his lips. Too soon—but not soon enough.
“Hold on,” Castiel huffs. He says something to Sonia that barely sounds like English and yanks open the door, the cat firmly wrapped in his sweatshirt-clad arms. “What’s—”
“You’re not who I was expecting,” Lilith growls. Her fingers curl into fists, her head held high. “Where’s your brother, Winchester?”
“Meaning, whoever killed you didn’t finish their research.” Approaching the table, Naomi takes Dean’s chin in hand, tilting his face from side to side. “Castiel, I want you to continue watching him. We’ll continue our investigation, but don’t lose sight of him. Do you understand?”
“Excuse me?” Castiel echoes.
“See?” Dean nudges his shoulder. “I got some bright ideas.” Okay, maybe they’re not so bright. But they
To that, Castiel honestly doesn't know. His search is fruitless at best, and no matter how many miles he travels and how many barren roads he crosses, he can’t find any trace of any remaining angels in the country. Heaven is doomed to crumble, and he can’t do a single thing about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel possesses the body of Jimmy Novak on a Thursday, and resurfaces in a field outside of Pontiac, Illinois two days later, covered in soot and smelling of brimstone. The air is warm, the sun beats down, and Castiel opens his newly human eyes to the empty earth, destroyed from his emergence. All of his organs appear functional, his senses in working order—
“Yeah,” Dean says, nonchalant. “But I also wanted five minutes with you without Sammy barging in.” Leaning down, he presses a kiss to the corner of Castiel’s lips. Sweet, like Dean cherishes him.
Castiel shakes his head. “You don’t need to worry about my wellbeing. I would worry more about your eyesight.” With that, he draws his necktie around Dean’s eyes, knotting it at the back. Dean blinks, the light from the nightstand lamp barely visible through opaque fabric. “I need to bare myself to you.”
To that, Castiel doesn’t know the answer. He can still feel his wings, but all of his angelic senses are muted, allowing him to touch the man before him and feel his warmth, feel just how hard his heart races beneath the skin. “Would it be so bad if I was?”
“You’re tactile, then,” Castiel suggests. “Why didn’t you attend a technical college?”
“You still got that radio?” Dean asks over the noise of the wind.
He shouldn't. Sam is probably enjoying the only bit of alone time he’s ever had, and dragging him back into the thick of it seems like a cruel joke. But if he ends up finding Castiel, then he needs help—if he doesn’t, then they can always drive back to Lebanon. Rural Georgia is a two-day drive at the least, a trip he doesn’t want to make Sam have to make if he doesn’t have to. “I’m gonna look around,” Dean decides. “If I don’t find anything by tonight, I’ll call you.”
Whoever’s knocking apparently does have a key. Part of him should be worried, or at least wondering why someone knows where his room is, but the pain meds tell him to lie back down and forget about it.
, Dean stands still. “Dean,” he says, low. Dean’s heart pounds under his fingertips. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
Cautious, Castiel draws an arm around Dean’s waist. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
The bickering continues, but Dean tunes it out, more interested in the breeze than anything they might have to say. Somehow, the conversation works back around to him, almost escaping his notice, if it weren’t for Castiel squeezing his hand. “Did you hear what Sam said?”
“I know.” Dean rubs his eyes. As much as he wants to, he can’t, not until his mother is safe and John is dead and buried, whichever comes first. “I know, and I wanna, but it’s—I’ve never left Georgia. I’m broke and living off grants, and I’m… There’s this song, man. Just—”
“Yeah,” Dean croaks. A low thrum of arousal begins to build, but Dean shoves it down, willing his heart calm. “Yeah, you’re… You sure this ain’t against the rules?”
, Cas, you gotta—”
Dean nods, his focus more on food than anything. He looks better in the waning sunlight, the glow to his skin restored with water and actual conversation. Castiel can’t help but stare, noting each and every freckle dotting Dean’s nose, the tufts of hair curling around his nape, the way his green eyes gleam when the light hits them just right. He really is striking, a marvel to look at.
.’ “Honey, would you be a dear and go grab my things?”
Castiel doesn’t answer him with words. Leaning in, he kisses Dean’s collar, then up his throat as he begins to circle his hips. Just the barest of inches at first, keeping himself hard and getting Dean interested—then, he pulls out to the tip and thrusts in, a long, hard drive that nearly sends Dean up the mattress. Dean clings to the bedding at first, until Castiel rips his hands away and pins them above his head, their fingers laced, their bodies close.
Castiel nods and follows him, hiding a yawn behind his hand. Cool air meets him as he steps inside, and the scent of garlic bread beckons to him. His stomach gnaws at itself; the last time they ate was when they left Wichita, and that was over six hours ago, based on the clock on the living room mantle. He stands there for a moment, admiring the photographs propped up on the brick, ones of Dean and his brother as children, of them standing with Mary at various landmarks, of a man who he can only assume is Dean’s father with Dean as a toddler and Sam as a newborn. He appears nowhere else. Dean never speaks of his father much, or what happened to him, but Castiel can only speculate.
“Did Bobby tell you about the race?” he asks.
He follows Sam, watching him count his steps as they walk in a vertical line across the yard. Once Sam counts to twenty, they stop, finding only grass and dirt. “Maybe it’s buried,” Castiel says, which would make sense. So far as Dean can remember, the last person to actually live here was Bobby twenty years ago. The yard certainly looks like it, with grass nearly thigh high and flowering.
. “He won last week. Dedicated the whole thing to you.”
“I can’t,” Dean croaks. Tears well, barely held back. “I never even told dad I was gay, and just—What if everyone finds out? This ain’t a damn movie, Sam, I’m not gonna be anyone’s favorite if they find out I’m a fucking fairy. And Cas too, the man’s a fucking saint for putting up with me, and I…” A breath. “I know he is too. Trust me, there’s a vibe, but I’m—I can’t hurt him like that. I can’t take us both down just because I wanna spend more time with him than just on the track.”
In his downtime, Dean normally sleeps. Every chance he gets, every waking second he isn’t studying, he prefers to nap atop the covers, more relaxed that Castiel has ever seen of a person in his life. All of his hard lines disappear in an instant, and sometimes, Castiel can spend minutes at a time just watching him snore.
“At one point, this could kill monsters,” Castiel says, which—interesting. “But it could only function with the bullets it was made with. I might be able to restore it.” He wrenches open the cylinder, narrowing his eyes. “You wouldn't happen to have another blade, would you?”
, he pleads. His eyes sting.
Sam sighs, deep in his chest. “That’s it? Just like that?”
Castiel’s jaw tightens, his stomach sinking. “You can’t mean that.”
Right, his clothes. Acutely, Dean remembers that beneath the towel, he’s technically naked, and Castiel is standing within kissing distance. And Dean wants to kiss him, if Castiel would let him. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”
She nods, her smile soft. “And are you happy?”
The Enochian stitching is rough under his fingertips; Dean touches it as well, tracing the shape of a feather trapped within. “That why you let me groom you, huh?” Dean joshes, his smile reaching the corners of his eyes.
Even in sleep, he can’t escape.
But maybe, just maybe, he can replace that memory with a new one, one where someone loves him, and where Castiel is loved in return.
And for the first time, Castiel nods. “Another day.” He presses his thumb to Dean’s lower lip, and Dean falls into him with a shudder. “When I can have you to myself.”
Tomorrow, the papers will talk about how Dean Winchester woke up after the worst crash of the year, and how the doctors are optimistic that he can get back out on the track in the next few weeks. But his chances of winning the championship this year are done. The closest he’s ever been to making his family proud, and it’s gone, yanked out from under him.
Sam grimaces, as much as he can given the hour. “Think I’ll take the bills instead.” Pushing his chair back, Sam closes his book and stands. “Talk about it in the morning?”
It’s his blood. It’s where he died.
Castiel’s face brightens. Sonia launches out of his arms, clawing her way up to Dean’s shoulder. First on their list of places to go today—the pet store, for a tree.
Castiel’s eyes widen, darting up to meet Dean’s gaze. Maybe he’ll have to give Castiel the tour, after all.
he tells himself, even when Castiel strokes behind his ear, then through his hair, soothing his hesitation. “Drink,” Castiel says.
“Cas?” Dean calls, breaking into a sprint.
“Dean,” Castiel exhales. He fits his palm over Dean’s cheek, and Dean falls into him. “It’s not your fault.”
Dean huffs, shaking his head. Castiel is the best thing that ever happened to him, but admitting it aloud is a step too far. Because admitting it means that he has to confront the weight in his heart that tells him he wants something
There’s that, at least. “Why didn't we try tonight?” Castiel asks. He eyes the crypt in front of him, the dates reading 1867 to 1949. “The soil would’ve been softer then.”
“I was…” Dean starts, then shakes his head. He was in the wrong—they both were, but Dean can’t take it back. “I fucked up, Bobby. He said I couldn’t quit, ‘cause my career was on the line, and I… He said it was just a wreck.” Nothing is ever just a wreck. Wrecks involve G-forces and whiplash and concussions, and no matter how much padding and how many roll cages they put into the cars, nothing is ever truly safe. “I told him I’d fire him if I could.”
“Wake me when it’s over,” Dean says through a yawn. “Hate ghosts. Really hate ‘em.”
Dean doesn’t answer. Doesn’t know if he can, actually. Rowena walks ahead, mud decorating the soles of her heels, and holds the door open, allowing Dean through. He could put Castiel on the dining table, but the couch is closer, and probably more comfortable. The minute Dean sets Castiel down—the minute he loses contact—he collapses to his knees, held upright only by Rowena’s steady hands.
Gently, fingertips rake through Dean’s hair, curling around the shell of his ear. “Pot, kettle, then,” Dean says. “Look, it’ll be… Ain’t saying it’s right, but it’ll get better. Least, that’s what I tell myself.” Closing his eyes, Dean falls into Castiel’s touch, a shiver working its way down his spine. “Your heart’s in the right place.”
“Dean,” Castiel echoes. His grip tightens as he quickens his pace, his hips beginning to stutter. Dean can feel him thicken, strangely, his cock driving in deep, deeper than anyone has ever been. Slick, wet noises fill the room, along with their moans, with a litany of curses pouring from Castiel’s lips. His teeth come into play as he climbs higher, sucking and biting marks to the curve of Dean’s throat until purple bruises burst into bloom.
