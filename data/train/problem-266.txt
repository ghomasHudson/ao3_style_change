“Before I give the game away. Tell me what this is, Mr. Holmes.” Ripper said while he gestured as far as his bound hands could.
“Good.” grinned John flirtatiously. His hand ran through his wet hair, carding his fingers backwards. “You had me worried for a second there.”
“Sherlock?” he questioned evenly, his eyes peering around the corner, looking for the target that seemed no longer keen on staying alive by John’s judgment. He was expecting to see Sherlock, lying in a pool of blood again, grey and barely breathing. Expecting his name to be called out as Sherlock bled out, as the detective did when he was in trouble. As he always did. Through his mind flashed memories of pale hands grabbing for him as Sherlock went into cardiac arrest. The desperation in Sherlock’s voice. The sense of panic growing, wondering if Sherlock was…
“No, it was her sentiment towards me that gave her a weakness in the game. Much like Moriarty and his own sentiment that made him swallow his gun.”
“Drugs, John,” answered Sherlock. Joseph paused, staring at Sherlock with a look that John was far too familiar with. An expression of surprise at his brilliance. He partly wondered if his face -more often than not- looked as ridiculous.
There were no other words in those seconds. Teasingly, he ran his finger over the parting, marveling at the gooseflesh underneath his fingertips, and the light bruises slowly forming on the firm, muscular globes. John’s own handprint appeared on Sherlock’s skin from when he helped Sherlock ride him hours earlier.
Soft footsteps echoed up the stairwell, and the door leading to the kitchen creaked open. Mrs. Hudson smiled brightly at them. Her purple dress swayed as she carried in a tray and landed it on the empty side of the kitchen table. John’s side of the table was always cleaned with rules in order to prevent another chemical stain in the wood.
John snorted, peaking into the living room where Sherlock stood in front of the window, rubbing the back of his head with the violin bow. “ Yes, and she also found you attractive along with a waitress at Angelo’s.”
John didn’t let up. He watched as Moran panicked, thrashing as his face turning into a vivid scarlet. “He’ll kill me if I fail!”
Moments later, Sherlock appeared out of his bedroom, wearing a white shirt replacing the black one. The dark curls were smothered to perfection. The only sign that Sherlock had been completely rumpled by John was Sherlock’s mouth, still puffy from their kissing. John fumbled through the rest of the order. His eyes flickered between the menu in his hand and Sherlock. John was torn between the two until the detective sat down at the kitchen table before his beloved microscope.
John tucked his mobile underneath his chin as he pulled his coat on. “That’s it? Just seeing things and choices?”
“Start at the beginning of what?” John murmured just as the screen in the video jarred around, followed by scuffled noises for several minutes before a heavy slam echoed out of the phone. Then the screen turned black for a several seconds before flickering back on. The empty close up of Mr. Hageman’s eyes stared up at the camera, zooming back to show him hanging in the holding cell.
He stalked into the kitchen and found it empty. Stomping into the living room, John found Sherlock, eyes closed, lying on the couch, fingers to his temple.
John hummed. “I guess you could tell them that I broke your arms. Doubt they would believe you though, everyone thinks that I’m some harmless sod. If you’re wanting to avoid anything broken, I guess I could tie you up here in the flat until you detox completely.”
Flashing red and blue lights and police were beacons to the scene in the setting sunlight. Crowds of people and reporters hugged the police tape. John paid the cabbie as they stopped at the end of the street. His jaw hit the ground when he climbed out, in awe of the building structures usually reserved for the upper class Londoners. Small elephant topiaries were planted either side of the white buildings. Trees were manicured in uniform. Decorative wrought iron streetlights flickered. The orange lights bathed the pavement making the marble sparkle. Even the air carried a sense of wealth and privilege never bestowed upon for people on a small pension like him.
“I’m not saying that you’re helpless. I’ve seen you box. It’s just… you should take better care of your hands. You’ll go mad if you couldn’t torture your violin every night, or hold a flask properly for one of your experiments.”
He would play verbal sparring if it got Mycroft off of Sherlock’s back about them. Everyone in this room knew that Mycroft was a ‘concerned’ older brother. He didn’t need to prove it every time John shared single space with Sherlock. It was just getting embarrassing at this point.
There was satisfaction and guilt when her mouth clamped shut and a look of surprise on her face. John offered no apologies even if part of his outburst stemmed from the devastation that he felt downstairs watching the victim’s boyfriend grieve. The dismay had soaked into his skin and the feelings rushed over him when he entered into the flat through the kitchen.
John pointed to a flier next to a darkened door. “Well, they’re looking for modeling volunteers tonight. Could sit there and deduce everyone in the classroom at once,” he mentioned lightly as a joke. Sherlock’s chin rested on John’s shoulder. A grin bloomed across the detective face.
John’s hands reached back and held the side of Sherlock’s hips, pulling the detective closer in the water. “I could always go clean shaven.”
“Hold on just a second, Sherlock. I need more information about Sebastian Moran. What makes you think he escaped?”
There was a sniff from next to him; John glanced over at Molly, who also caught Sherlock’s unnerving glare. “Oh stop that! It’s just another postmortem to add to your quiet company. It shouldn’t be any different when you meet my brother and Lestrade tonight. In fact, you might prefer the corpses instead.”
The man nodded; seemingly relaxed by John’s coaxing and either ignoring Sherlock’s remark or missing it entirely. “My name is Joseph Mollet. I think my sister is missing, I haven’t heard from her in three days. It’s unlike her.”
Something carnal within John started to stir- the feeling that this gorgeous man in front of him was his, marked inside and out.
He typed out a quick message, asking where Sherlock was. The mobile buzzed in his hand again. John looked up to Peter. “I can’t stay actually…I’m being called to work.”
There was a familiar face at the door; Lestrade waved them on whilst calmly shouting at the reporters to back off. How he managed to do both, John would never know. He relaxed when they crossed those doors, enveloped in the small chaos of the Met instead of the media chaos outside. Deft fingers slipped from his grip in the fraction of a second he let his guard down.
Lestrade nodded, he flipped through his notebook and read. “The female is Rachel Sulley and the man near her is Patrick Dubar. The other victim is Finnigan Mathews. According to Sulley’s coworkers, Mathews is her half-brother.”
John’s pride wouldn’t take that. If anything, Sherlock’s tune was about to change if John had a say in it. It started with putting a hand back on Sherlock’s cock stroking the hard flushed length slowly. John popped the opening of the lube with the other hand, slicked his two fingers, and rubbed them against his thumb to warm up the thick liquid.
“There will be no need to cancel your date with Lestrade, Molly. This won’t take long if I’m provided with the correct cold chamber immediately; it’s still early and this case has been growing interesting. Although, I do recommend changing your shoes before tonight, it seems you have a spot of blood on them, most likely from your…second postmortem this morning judging by color. -” The detective peaked at the body on the large metal table. “-It’s been there for about two hours considering this is your third body today,” Sherlock stated. “I know Lestrade sees plenty of blood but -perhaps not third date appropriate, wouldn’t you say?”
“Crime scene then,” he declared, earning a surprised look from the other two men. John nodded at the boyfriend, “It seems like he needs some time, so where?”
John caught himself on the edge. He had to lie back down and close his eyes. If he sees Sherlock fucking himself on his cock now, he would come instantly.
Just thinking about leaving Baker Street John’s heart began to pound. “I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “If he won’t let me help, then I just can’t sit by and watch him kill himself.”
John nodded. “You could probably just ask Mycroft later, I heard that you have a date with Molly and him.”
Sherlock hummed at him, eyes still calculative, lips perched around his wine glass. John couldn’t help but to feel transfixed by Sherlock’s mouth, his throat, and the way he held the glass in his hands. John snatched the wine bottle quickly. He poured his glass half full.
There was something about the low tone of Sherlock’s voice that made John turn his head. He jolted with surprise to find Sherlock closer to him than before. Green eyes blazed down at him. John cleared his throat, turning away from the gaze. He licked his lips. “I always see you. Kind of difficult to miss.”
A/N: I hope you guys enjoy this chapter. It was fun to write. Thank you for all the comments and everything else. I don't know anything about guns, so all the names and everything was picking off of a gun site. I'm sorry if anything is wrong and please let me know about it. Thank you beta Whitehart for looking over this chapter.
The other man shouted in surprise and he lost his lit cigarette into his lap. John didn’t count on that, but it was a toxic blessing. Moran continued to curse wildly. Either from John’s sudden attack or from the heat, John wasn’t too sure or concerned. All that mattered was Moran had abandoned the wheel for utter concern of his lap and prick, leaving John with all the control of the wheel.
John scoffed lightly. A half-grin bloomed over his features, entertained by the fact that Mycroft dared to utter that phrase at him. Even after all these years, the elder Holmes didn’t realize what John could understand of him. Both Holmes could read a person like reading a book, but ‘knowing’ a person was completely different from reading a person’s clothing. Mycroft had different levels of ‘worry’. Level one: he was the atypical nosey older brother, who had a problem with kidnapping…. and bribery. Level four John saw on the tarmac, the he was genuinely worried that he may lose his brother forever.
“You’re sniffing the bodies again, Sherlock,” he remarked lowly. John glanced over at Lestrade, who was ignoring the two them at the moment, and talking into his mobile phone.
Jack Ripper scoffed, the insufferable grin plastered back on his face once more. “Does it matters? She’s dead anyway.”
“Oh, that is interesting. Given how often he would have to do so in order to prevent his fingerprints returning.” The detective strolled into the kitchen, donning a black suit that highlighted a pale line of skin and made John’s heart flip flop in his chest. He managed to hand over a mug to Sherlock without spilling. Sherlock joined him in leaning against the counter and continued after taking a sip. “I assume that facial recognition is out of the question considering the state of the body. What about the ‘boyfriend?’”
All John could do was nod desperately and try his best not to orgasm before they had a chance to move together. He was breathing harder every time Sherlock slid up and down. His insides were so slick, John’s earlier worries had gone out the window. But he started to wonder what Sherlock did to himself. His mind started imagining Sherlock fingering himself open… in the bath, or over the sink, or in bed?
A muffled chime sounded from nearby. John blinked, remembering that Sherlock’s mobile was sandwiched between them. He jumped to a stand. His hands fixed over his towel as Sherlock sat up from the couch with his phone in hands. Pale fingers flew over the buttons while he spoke.
John glanced up from staring at the floor. “Could be a fake name,” John offered. “Jack the Ripper, you know? Instead of killing prostitutes, he murdered a stripper. Seems close enough.”
“Maybe literally, if and when it comes to that. We haven’t had a decent chase in London’s Underground for a while.”
“From the grieving mother,” Sherlock stated softly. John stiffened before he focused on making breakfast the way that he knew that Sherlock would eat it. It had completely slipped his mind last night that he wasn’t the only one affected. That he may have blurred the lines between his nightmares and reality, but losing that infant was someone else’s complete reality.
He mouthed at the camera slowly; hoping that someone on the other side could decipher the message, ‘Keep them safe’. John was tempted to add more, a longer goodbye to Sherlock. But didn’t. His mind supplied him with the vision of Sherlock’s distressed and worried features, along with the tone. It could’ve been like Sherlock was here with him, easily calling him an idiot for what he was about to do.
“He said wanted to study the abnormalities on the back of the victims neck. I told him that they weren’t bruises but a residue. I got samples for him, did the analyzing myself. But when he looked over the bodies, and into the microscope, he began,” she motioned to Sherlock, pacing, his hands flying in multiple directions, “He seems a bit off.”
John grimaced, remembering that morning from years ago, when they first began as flatmates. He had a nightmare, and must have caught Sherlock’s attention because the next thing John knew, he had aimed his gun at the doorway, at Sherlock. He remembered his heart pounding, his hand solid and true, and cold sweat rolling down his spine. He had been close to shooting Sherlock. After that morning, John had angled the mirror at the door- in case he woke up with his gun in hand, the mirror would be the first victim. John blinked, going back to the man pacing in the small room.
“No, John. If I choose to inform Sherlock of leads to find Mrs. Watson, what do you think will happen?”
His remark earned a light chuckle from Sherlock. He grabbed John’s hand, leading them dripping wet back into the bedroom. The air smelled of sex and a mixture of their cologne. Both men stood before the bed.
Licking his lips, John stated in a hardened tone, “I know that you wanted to say something in the bedroom, but didn’t. I want to let you know that you can tell me...anything at all…all right? It’s all fine, of course.”
Sherlock’s voice and a quick-click of a computer mouse made John narrow his focus from pale skin to the screen before him. Three figures stood outside the row of flats, seemingly immersed in conversation. The panicked door attendant from last night was missing. Familiarity tingled at the back of John’s neck as he stared at the footage. Another click started the footage from the stopping point. Ten minutes went by on the tape, and the three men, John determined by body structure, separated. One man entered into the row of flats, which was interesting because he wasn’t on tape inside the lobby. John frowned and let out a low hum from the back of his throat. Sherlock inhaled lowly, glancing at John with one eyebrow raised, telling John that he noticed it as well. The other two men grabbed a cab, and drove off out of view.
Sherlock’s death. John had returned to Ella. His therapist encouraged him to voice out words he never had said. He couldn’t say them to Ella. Storming out of her office in a wave of grief, he had stopped into a shop for something. He couldn’t remember what it was, and it wasn’t important at the time. He froze with a hand hovering over the magazines. Models on the cover each held something that had reminded John of Sherlock that day. He had purchased them. Under the cover of night and a glass of whiskey, he cried those unspoken words into the magazines, all while doting on Sherlock. That moment was never mentioned to anyone. Now, the man who inspired the purchase has the magazines, tucked away in the same man’s nightstand drawer. It seemed ironically fitting. But what the hell was Sherlock thinking?
Sherlock had his fake smile plastered on. John caught on that he was already in ‘actor mood’, and John was designated the role of the bad cop.
“Always the doctor,” Sherlock remarked with an accompanied eye roll. His elegant hand released their cocks and held John under his armpits, pulling themselves on their feet. Sherlock then turned around, laid his palms flat against the wall, bent over, and presented his arse like it was on a silver platter.
He swallowed a few more sips of coffee before starting down the hallway. Molly called after him, “And the case? What about Sherlock?”
He shook his head, ignoring the need for his gun, and crossed the room. He fixed the mirror with the barest of fingertips on the wood. It swung open easily. His other hand hung by his side in a fist. The small rectangle mirror reflected the view of the closed bedroom door. John’s shoulders sagged. In the back of his mind, he thought, maybe, there might have been something. He brushed it off.
John thought there was a possibility this man was behind all those unsolved murders. It wouldn’t come as a surprise, seeing they’ve had weirder breakthroughs. And criminals weren’t known to be original.
John nodded his head over his shoulder, at the black plug on the bedside table. “Do you always run around with that in you?”
Ten minutes in, pecking on the keyboard and it was beginning to look like John was utterly and completely wrong. Finding this bloke could be more difficult than he originally thought.
“Yes, make Mrs. Hudson grope your mobile out of your trousers. That would be something! You could’ve gotten it!”
John pressed forward, he climbing into the cab, and closed the door behind him. Between the doors locked and and the click of his seatbelt made him feel like a prisoner, waiting on death row. Or a delivery en route. John couldn’t quite decide on which metaphor to use. John even wondered if it was the right time to even think about shit like this, but he knew… if Sherlock were here… the detective would have a good metaphor for situations like these…
“That is the idea,” John remarked in the same tone as if they were talking about the weather. “Only if you’re up for it.”
‘Upsetting’ wasn’t the word that John would use to describe this moment. He was glad that Sherlock couldn’t see every deduction on his face or else he would’ve said more. It would have been easier if he had seen it. The want. The jealously. The pining. Sherlock would let him down as he did before. He could go back to The Work without feeling like something was building. That everything that they’ve been through together should remain at a standstill because Sherlock doesn’t do emotions, feelings, and sentiment. He tore his eyes away from Sherlock. A humorless laugh escaped through his lips. “You always miss something.”
“I really didn’t like the moustache. It was like you were… someone else. Not my John.” It came out as nothing more than a tender whisper.
“The suspect is most likely unarmed given that he fled up the stairwell instead of confronting us. The question is why he fled at all.”
In the small space in front cab and still restricted with his seatbelt. John could only turn, throwing a bit of his knee to keep Moran from completely overwhelming him. He drew back, threw a fist into Moran’s ribs, and kept doing so until the man above him wheezed.
Marry immediately cut him off. “AJ and Rosie are my family. I would do anything for them. Moriarty is after me, after Rosie because of what I did. We’ll never be safe unless there’s a trade.”
Chapter 5. I should explain that I'm from the States, so some settings will be 'made-up' for the purpose of this story. I would appreciate if this fic somehow made it on the Tumblr rotation- I don't have a tumblr myself. Thanks to all who has kudos/commented/bookmarked. This chapter was beta-ed by my wonderful beta 'englandwouldfalljohn'. Disclaimer: I don't own Sherlock.
John rolled his eyes. “Fine, your ‘not-panic’ attack worries me. I’ve seen you worked up before but…”
Another two honks followed, covering whatever retorts the homeless network person might have said. This time, the noise came from right next to him, from the cab that had paused in the busy street. John turned, glaring at the cab as the window rolled down and he snapped. “What? You need the time too?”
The mobile beeped in his ear. John pulled it away from his ear, and looked at the new incoming message. It had video file attached to it. He put the mobile back up to his ear.
John hung up. He stared at the mobile in his hand, remembering the other mobile that he had given Sherlock. Her mobile. John didn’t know what Sherlock did with it. John turned, folded his legs in order to study over Sherlock’s expression. There was a pleased, crooked grin fixed on his face, John followed the detective’s eyes to his mobile. John realised that Sherlock was entertained with him telling Mycroft to piss off.
John walked down the corridor that Lestrade had cleared earlier. He noted the shadows, in a darker grey of squares on the walls. Empty spaces where photos were hung, obvious even without the torch. His footsteps echoed in the hallway, loud against the stillness. Even downstairs carried the same bleakness as the floor above. Life and happiness never existed in this house. He walked into the kitchen, finding blood splatter on the black countertops, and the broken glass door before spotting the victim on the floor. It was easy to see what had killed her.
The door clicked shut. John relaxed, relieved at the peace of just him and Sherlock alone. He switched from professional doctor to assessing all the damage as Sherlock’s ‘all-in’. A deep frown formed on his face as he took in the injuries.
“How was your last game of cards? Didn’t win back the engagement ring, did you? Judging by the biscuits I would say-“
“Sorry,” he sighed. John rubbed his hands on his thighs, his pinky finger grazed against Sherlock’s thigh. He ignored the memory of that muscle underneath his hand at the pub where it had been dark, adrenaline-fueled, and heart pounding lust. “I’m just trying to sort out on how to begin.”
“Hello,” she greeted shyly, her fingers played with her long hair. “I’m sorry if I made your friend uncomfortable. I’m not typically that forward, but would you like to go back inside for dinner, well you’ve had dinner, but a drink then?”
Reporters huddled around the outside, creating a circle of vultures between them and the entrance. When John pushed open the door and climbed out, Sherlock following behind him, the vultures descended.
“That was fucking stupid,” John countered darkly, words slipping from his mouth. “You endangered our daughter!”
“He’s….”John trailed off, glancing out of the corner of his eye at Sherlock. He was still staring at nothing, but his breathing leveled. It was a relief for John, knowing Sherlock would not pass out from shortness of breath. He knew Sherlock experienced another ‘not-panic attack’ earlier. Now, he didn’t seem too different. John cleared his throat. “He’s thinking. Hasn’t said anything aloud yet.”
John frowned at Mycroft. His fist balled on the leather seats. He felt each stab. The words were as sharp as blades. Each sentence killed a bit of him. It made guilt ache in his bones. It was one thing to think that he had put Sherlock through hell with the wedding; it was another feeling altogether to have it confirmed. There was an ache in him that related nothing to the guilt, but to the fear, and the panic that he had almost completely lost Sherlock. He never knew that it was a mission to die. That handshake on the tarmac, for a last farewell, was so dismal. It could have been the last for the both of them if that plane hadn’t turned around. His throat tightened from the inner turmoil, but his voice was steady as he spoke.
He toweled off quickly as chilly air bit at his skin. There were too many questions again. And he was unwilling to find out because of fear, rejection, and lastly inexperience which made John huff with slight entertainment. He had experience with women. How different could Sherlock and his experience be? With that thought in mind, he grabbed his discarded clothes from the floor and opened the door.
John watched in silence as the anger melted from Sherlock’s face to blank perfection, he could only guess what Mycroft had said in order for Sherlock to change so quickly. He didn’t like it one bit. John pulled the phone from Sherlock’s hand, and placed it to his ear, only catching the tail end of the conversation. He held the detective away with his other free hand, avoiding the long arms that reached for his mobile.
“I think she’s full of shite. It seems the legend is always greater than the person. That’s all you have? ‘A friendly chat?’ Disappointing, really.”
He walked carefully around the kitchen, avoiding fallen bar stools and broken pieces of glass scattered on the floor. Even a probationary officer could see what had happened and came up with a decent conclusion of the scene. John turned around, thought he should go tell Lestrade what he thought the time of death was, and to get some damn gloves to confirm it when something yellow registered through the corner of his eye.
John cleared his throat, stepped towards Peter and put on his most charming smile- well, one that he hoped was charming, it seemed to work for some women in the pub sometimes, as he lied. “Actually, I think I’m lost…it’s my first time on campus, but there’s something wrong with my schedule. I don’t know how to get that fixed.” The lie had come surprisingly quickly.
“Of course. But it seems that my meddling brother had the paperwork already in motion due to “-’foreseen circumstances,’” Sherlock retorted with a sneer.
“Mind palace,” John answered, “It’s his way of storing information so he doesn’t forget it, unless he deletes it.”
The arm John deflected earlier grabbed the side of John’s face, trying to push him into the plastic remains from the airbag. John sent another fist, and aimed. A howl of pain followed the audible crack in Moran’s elbow as John broke it.
John knew what the other man was implying. It couldn’t be true. Not again. Sherlock was confident on the tarmac. Said that he was dead. John shook his head. “Sherlock said that Moriarty blew his brains out. I know that people could recover from injuries like that but-”
Ah. John’s mind lit up and he pointedly ignored the idiotic jab. So Sherlock knew that he was attracted to him, that he wanted to act on it, and he was so tempted to do so but he wasn’t. Wanker. He returned the egg pan to a cooler burner to grab two plates. He held them in his hands; unaware of that he was trying to shield himself as he replied. “That…would make things complicated.”
“We made a promise to each other, John,” stated Sherlock gently. A large hand palmed over the side of John’s face. “We’re all in together. I love you, as you’ve probably deduced by now.”
John groaned lightly when Sherlock’s hand wrapped around his cock. He hummed at the languid pace that Sherlock had set. It was part torture and pleasurable at the same time. His thumb circling the head, smearing precum around the tip, while the other four fingers and palm rubs slowly on his shaft. An obscene moan escaped his lips when Sherlock reached the other hand down from behind and massaged his balls.
“Evening. I see from gun in your hand that you are nearing to the last of your ammunition. There’s no need for that, we can have a perfectly reasonable conversation between gentlemen.”
Now the conversation moved into a silent exchange between the two brothers, John’s head turned back and forth, hoping to pick up on the wordless discussion. Moments later, Sherlock turned his head away, his violin wedged underneath his chin. Mycroft moved to the open door that John neglected to close behind him. John watched as the older Holmes brother twirled his usual accessory in his hand in habitual motion, even if the umbrella was unneeded for today.
No rushing, as he had told Sherlock over and over again. John would have to follow through with his own words. His hands traveled downward on the flushed heated skin. Sherlock’s muscles danced underneath his fingertips. John quickly undid Sherlock black trousers while holding Sherlock’s gaze. Then pushed the material down, along with his small black pants. John made a mental note to inspect those pants more closely next time. But for now, John took in the sight.
“Mycroft likes his dramatics,” countered Sherlock with a huff and a small hand wave, disregarding the whole notion. John jumped when his mobile buzzed once in his pocket. A tiny chirp followed seconds later from across the sitting room. John shared a look with Sherlock. Couldn’t be a coincidence.
He looked over his shoulder, into the kitchen. On the wooden table was a miniature wooden chest about the size of the pencil box. John turned back to Sherlock. “What is it?”
Joseph nodded. “Our parents died when we were young. Car crash. We lived with our aunt and cousins until she went to college, and I could move out. She calls everyday. I’ve tried calling. Her phone is never off. I keep getting her voicemail.”
Their talking may have waned him a bit but it was all for naught. Now, he rolled his hips against Sherlock’s. Driven by nature and the sounds that he was consuming from Sherlock’s mouth. He was so close; he had been so close before. But this, he could feel it. The tide of pleasure burned under his skin, bordering between too much and wanting more. John ripped his mouth away, panting. His mouth fixed on Sherlock’s elongated neck as the detective threw his head back and moaned. John harshly sucked into that pale column, earning more sounds out of Sherlock. Hands pushed and pulled at John’s sweater. In the same rhythm of, close, but not close enough.
Traffic picked up again as John answered, feeling a bit odd by the friendly conversation he was having with the same person who was previously a Lord of parliament, who attempted to blow up said parliament with a bomb, who then turned out killer who was working for Moriarty.
“No, not off…well he could be” John shrugged, before adding, “Have you never seen him do his mind palace bit before?”
As son as Sherlock, Mr. Sleeping-in-all-day-after-a-case, got out of bed, it was time to start their day. He read the clock on the bedside table, 1:20am in bright red numbers. He groaned, tempted to crawl back into bed and ignore Greg, to roll over and pull Sherlock back in for a bit of lie down. Begrudgingly, he knew otherwise. Once he was up, he was up. He yawned, stretched arms over his head and his back begrudgingly popped.  He realised sometime in the night, he had lost a shoe and a sock, when a low whistle echoed through the room.
A/N: And here we go... warns of torture- if you don't want to read those parts, find the words 'Merry Mollet' and read from there, you'll get the gist of what happened in the chapter. Please leave feedback if you wish. Happy Reading. Thank you to all those who left feedback- you're awesome. Thank you to my beta Whitehart for making this chapter shiny.
“Fine, I won’t thank you or remind you that my life is my own-“ that remark earned John a disgruntled huff from the detective, but he continued,  “But I have something to ask you.”
“I’m not an idiot, I am aware of what that phrase means,” stated Sherlock, waving his hand in the air, dismissing completely the idea that he wouldn’t know. The room, the space between them, bristled, flaring when their eyes met. John licked his lips and the detective added, “Would you like me to?”
John sighed, slouching in discontentment. The tip of his toes brushed the floor as he shifted on the stool. He glanced over at Sherlock, who still had his eyes squinting intently into a computer screen whilst holding a fingerprint dusting brush, with gloves on.
Jesus Christ! That wasn’t something John wanted to hear. They could’ve wasted a lifetime of almost, and or never. It was John’s reality when he thought Sherlock was dead.
Pale hands dropped from his face. In seconds, Sherlock’s face closed off, locking John away from the person underneath. Sherlock stepped away, his back towards John. His voice was sharp when he spoke. “Give me a moment.”
John’s mind whirled and his body reacted quickly in thought of his plan. In the following seconds, he leapt off the bed, snatched the plug from the bedside table, and strutted into the bathroom. John admired Sherlock’s arse as the detective dove into the stream of water. Grey eyes connected to John’s through saturated curls.
‘Married to his work’ and countless other reminders that Sherlock found human attachment idiotic - John knew that feeling like this was pointless. Sherlock’s body was nothing to him but means of transport for his rather large intellect. Everything else didn’t matter. Eating. Drinking. Feelings, knowing the way Sherlock cursed that word venomously. John exhaled slowly, recalling the brush of light fingertips, almost gentle, over the plethora of scars on his ruined shoulder this morning, and the sound of Sherlock’s voice when…they had almost…it had to mean something. Maybe.
“Hello, John. I was beginning to wonder when you were going to join me. Are you going to help me get undressed?”
“There are lots of reasons why people would drink at midday. Frankly, those types of people could have the most interesting stories.”
Literally, and he saw the largest grin Sherlock has ever had on his face, the loving gleam in his eyes made John’s heart skip a beat.
Sherlock’s words did something to him, warmed his chest. This moment was the same as when they were alone in the flat. John watched as thoughts flurried over Sherlock’s surprisingly open face. Indecision. Hesitance. Resolution. They were so close; it made John’s heart wild. He licked his lips. Sherlock’s hands were on him, warm, inviting. Fingertips caressed his pulse. He held the cheap robe within his fingertips at Sherlock’s elbows. All he had to do was rise and capture.
He gagged on disgust. And pity. He saw her sail over the edge with him, the infant that Mary disappeared off with. His child. He could see flashes of Sherlock and his daughter tumbling over the edge. John spat on the rooftop to get the vile taste from his mouth but words kept tumbling out.
The conversation in the cab stopped as Sherlock poked at his phone. John exhaled and pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering if his nightmares were going to return tonight. He didn’t feel honorable. Shooting the suspect would have brought justice for the families. For the victim’s loved ones. To their significant others after so many years of building a future that they could never have again. John snuck a glance at Sherlock, wondering…he shook his head and repeated what he’d told himself earlier that evening. Attraction was fine. Flatmates, best friends were fine. Something else…a bit not good at all.
“Yup. We only have a bit of time to spare before starting our search for Issac Spoo and ask why our mysterious texter wants their life.”
John mumbled curses under his breath before grinning as he chased after his best friend down the crowded pavement. He stayed quiet as Sherlock lead them to the next pub. Looking straight ahead, John easily saw people tripping over themselves once their eyes landed on his taller companion. John wondered if Sherlock could see the effect that he had on both women and men. Then again, the man sees everything, he probably knew when someone was flirting with him or checking him out. John glanced over, catching Sherlock’s side profile hidden away by his coat collar. His face was passive as usual, all business as they walked through the streets.
“We were across town,” answered John, ignoring Sherlock’s glare as he continued to talk to Lestrade, “at Roland Kerr College, following a lead. What’s with the cameras?”
“Brilliant,” murmured John. Sherlock’s mouth turned up at the corners, seemingly fighting back a smile. John smiled at him anyways, telling Sherlock that he understood.
“I can see that you are going through withdrawals already. You’re not using drugs again, you hear me? I want whatever supplies you have left. This stops now,” John ordered.
“You can’t help the dead,” the nameless man retorted flatly. There was something in the voice and set of the shoulders that triggered John into knowing. He knew what was going to happen next. Instead of being on the pavement, he was on the roof, watching it unfold. John broke off into a sprint, knowing that Sherlock was doing the same, trying to catch the man disappearing in a swan dive over the edge. All John could see was Sherlock…falling….
He also knew he needed a decent plan, in order for him not be snuffed out. Starting with how many bullets are in his gun, and where exactly Moriarty was, so John could blow his brains out. Then take his pulse.
Mary scoffed at him. Her mouth morphed into a sneer. “Fuck off, John. When we met, you said you never wanted children, so don’t-”
A silence hung between them. John didn’t want it to come to this. Hell, it would’ve been easier if Mary hadn’t appeared back into their lives at all. But here they were, a divorced, bloody train wreck. He swallowed the lump in his throat. “I wish it hadn’t come to this, Mary.”
“It’s not about the linens, John! That is utterly pointless. No, he’s probably been in here, poking around in our belongings while we’ve been chasing dead ended leads in this case!” Sherlock ripped away from his bed and paused before John. Grey eyes flared in frustration. “It’s about Moriarty’s web, and Sebastian Moran, the trap, the message-”
-And whapped his head on the wooden doorway again. The mouth on his cock disappeared with a lewd pop. John hissed from the loss of pleasure, and from the nippy air brushing past his wet cock. “Sherlock-”
He didn’t need clarification of Sherlock’s remark. That was his answer. John smiled down at Sherlock. The confident man who had snogged him in the kitchen this morning was completely different under his hands. Two pale rose blemishes stained Sherlock’s cheeks. A reddish flush painted over his graceful neck. Grey-blue eyes flickered at him, going between looking at John’s eyes and mouth. Nervousness, eagerness, perhaps a bit of trepidation. John had some reservations when Sherlock had flippantly said that the attraction and fondness was mutual. Now, under his hands, John understood. Because he knew how it felt. Utterly. Completely.
Sherlock punched the button for the lift, and answered. “To study the phone and notes that you found at the crime scene.”
“I wanted a normal life, a boring life. You couldn’t have given me that once Sherlock was back in your life.”
They paused in the corridor. Abstract paintings with different shades of yellow decorated on one side of the wall, brightening the grey. “Well, that confirms your theory,” John muttered. “The yellow paint stained their hands.”
Silence hung in the air between them as they left the hospital, climbed into a cab, and finally, thankfully, arrived back home to Baker Street.
There was an affronted scoff followed by silence. John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s attitude. With that silence, Lestrade turned back to Donovan. “What’s his name?”
“It’s interesting that the criminal would only want to speak with me when it’s obvious that the crime doesn’t merit the visit. Obviously, it was a spurned lover, but why insist?”
John’s eyes flickered between Molly and Sherlock. He blew out a lungful of air. “Is that it, Sherlock? Two of them? Are we going to see more victims, then?”
“Whomever was the sender didn’t have the intention to blow you up, but assigned you to kill Issac Spoo in 48 hours.” Sherlock turned, facing John with a frown set on his face. “Are you sure you have that name right?”
“I think I am going to turn in for the night,” John replied. He wasn’t unusually tired physically. It was the emotional exhaustion that was weighting him down. The case of loved ones being torn away, the crime scene involving two men that were happy and building a life together, the victim who was taken away too soon, and the baby that wasn’t his, but stirred up his own desire to have his child back, and a million other things that he would rather think about alone. John turned to Sherlock as the taller man pulled off his coat. John honed in on the red tint taking over Sherlock’s forearm and his silver shirt.
“Please John. I need more. Please…” The look that Sherlock threw him, along with the words, John knew he couldn’t resist.
“I’m all finished,” he answered and squatted down at AJ, plucking the gun from his hip holster. John checked the safety and the clip, which was on and full. He stood back up again, and glanced down at Mrs. Hudson, who had her nose in a disapproving wrinkle.
“I thought I would challenge you,” smiled John, grabbing the newspaper from the small table next to his chair.
“You mean making it seems like you know how to do your jobs?” Sherlock quipped from standing on the sofa. John glanced at the detective’s back, trying to get something from Sherlock’s body language. John caught movement out of the corner of his eyes as the inspector detective shrugged.
Being articulate wasn’t his strongest suit even on his best days, worse when Sherlock had a hand pumping at his cock. John couldn’t set his words straight. He would just have to do it, the plan in his head. His hips jerked followed the stroking, stepping closer, lining Sherlock’s cock up against his own. He wrapped his hand around them both. Their mouths pressed together soon after.
The bedroom fell silent. John closed his eyes and hummed deeply, listening to the Sherlock’s breathing with his. He felt the beginning waves of tiredness washed over him. Sherlock’s voice floated through the fog. “Tired, John?”
Moran held the wheel with one knee as he patted down his jacket, and pulled out a lighter. He puffed as he lit up, and tossed the lighter to join everything else. It was silent for a moment, and then Moran exhaled; smoke trailing into the air as he spoke.
A/N: Thank for all the comments/kudos/ and bookmarks. They've been lovely and I love hearing feedback for this fic. I want to also thank my beta: Whitehart for looking over the chapters.
Well, it wasn’t a comfort now. John closed his eyes. Red beams flickering over Sherlock in the bright floodlight. His palms up in the air. Mycroft’s voice shouting. His own surprise. His eyes couldn’t leave Sherlock’s as he was tackled to the ground after killing Magnussen. Their eyes were still connected as Sherlock was taken away. The longest week, waiting to hear good news that only ended in a goodbye. John clenched his jaw. He couldn’t lose him a fourth time.
“Is it the same killer then?” John asked, looking between Sherlock and Lestrade. “Could it just be another murderer, a different one?”
John felt the muscles clench tight around his cock. He dropped his face onto Sherlock’s shoulder, not caring if his face would be covered in Sherlock’s semen, instantly folding his lover into half and fucked the tight heat viciously.
Sherlock stepped into his personal space again, using his height as means to intimidate him. John met his eyes, unthreatened, knowing the last time they had a tussle like this, it was Sherlock pinned to the pavement by his shorter frame and bleeding from the small cut on the cheek made by his fist.
Lestrade snorted. “Might not be a good idea after Sally informed me about an interesting conversation at the crime scene last night.”
“No, I didn’t do it! Don’t like getting my hand dirty in that mess. They had a choice and they killed themselves. I just watched. Now, speaking of Sherlock…”
John smiled at Sherlock, and placed his left hand on Sherlock’s knee. He curled his right arm on the sofa. His fingers glided in soft slow tantalising circles, relishing the heat, and the solid feel of Sherlock under his hand. There was a spike of pride when Sherlock shivered underneath his touch.
“I suppose you could have one of my jumpers in trade,” John continued lightly, hushed voice against the pounding of his heart. If he looked carefully enough, he could see the pounding of Sherlock’s heart, framed with nets of blue trailing underneath the porcelain skin, saying in their own words, ‘I’m alive’, ‘I’m here’, and ‘I love you’. No doubt John echoed the same, now they both knew.
True to Sherlock’s word, they entered into the cafeteria. They fell into cue with other students grabbing their own food as well. Sherlock hovered over John’s shoulder and answered. “The serial killer, John.”
“Douglas Hageman?” Sherlock asked, he waved his hand therefore defeating John’s purpose of wrapping up the second hand. John grabbed the wrist gently to hold it still as Sherlock went on.  “No, Magnussen did in the hospital after I was shot. Before a malfunctioned trigger ended his life. You and I witnessed it.”
“The killer is escalating, rather quickly, rushing to perfect the technique,” answered Sherlock. The DI sighed, “What for?”
“Observe them,” Sherlock corrected with a whisper. His dark curls drifted from his forehead as he leaned down, his face growing closer to John’s, his voice huskily. “You are fascinating, John Watson.”
John couldn’t leave Sherlock. Not after everything he was told. He couldn’t allow Sherlock to step away from him. He would hold Sherlock to his promise, of never leaving him behind.
Using the doorknocker, John closed the door behind them as Sherlock flagged down a cab. The journey to Bart’s was quiet. John glanced between looking out the window and at Sherlock, waiting for something. Anything. He opened his mouth, wanting to say…then he snapped it closed, uncertain how to begin.
Sherlock fixed him with a scowl before turning around. His low voice carried over his shoulder. “I’m not asking you to disrobe down to your pants, John. Unbutton your collar while you’re at it.”
John followed Sherlock as he stalked towards the scene in his recognizable coat; as they approached, reporters quickly swarmed, burying them in warm bodies and biting jabs. John clenched his jaw, stepping in front of Sherlock as questions flew at them, attacking them with the months-old rumors about Janine and her new engagement. He felt Sherlock at his back when they finally navigated out of the vultures. The taller man held up the tape while Lestrade waved them through, pausing during his questioning of a witness. John ducked underneath, glad to get onto crime scene.
“That’s him,” Moran supplied, then he added. “It’s time. We have about thirty minutes to get there.”
‘Be careful, tread lightly, and someone will die tonight.’ John only hoped that it wouldn’t be one of them. As Sherlock sat down with a fake welcoming smile plastered to his face, Ripper leaned forward on the table as far as he could and smiled with one corner of his mouth. It twitched and four words John hoped not to hear were uttered aloud.
There was a light laugh from Sherlock before the room fell silent. John unbuttoned Sherlock’s cufflink, pushed up the light blue sleeves and checked the gun wound. It was healing nicely. It wouldn’t need another bandage, but he still cleaned the pale skin around the injury. Once he was finished, John buttoned the cufflink, and returned the sleeve back to where it was. It turned out that Sherlock was a sensitive with his suits as he was with his sock index. As John went for the last of the supplies on the bed, Sherlock’s voice broke through the silence.
“Perhaps, should I also inform Sherlock of her whereabouts while I give the news about Moriarty and Sherrinford?”
John paused when the two other men glanced at him. Pride danced across Sherlock’s features. His opal eyes from this morning in bed were now a light blue. Sherlock’s inky hair was styled immaculately. Lestrade looked entertained, glancing between him and Sherlock. “If you get tired of Sherlock, you could always work with me at the Yard.”
Each step had to be stealthy and measured in the narrow white staircase. The wood underneath his feet barely made a sound. John felt adrenaline coursing through him, a sense of purpose and power. The gun in his hand held steady. The light was still as well. In fact, both his gun and the torch were the steadiest and surest thing now compared to the situation. The wife could be dead. Someone could be in the house. John didn’t know how Lestrade was faring downstairs without backup. He knew to clear of any threats on the second floor, before returning back downstairs.
“No, you did fine. Sherlock does what he wants. He always does what he wants, and despite being someone who thinks for a living, sometimes he just doesn’t. Sometimes he’s an idiot,” he snapped. He opened the door and walked down the hallway. He nodded at Sarah and mouthed ‘bye’ before continuing his angry rant into his phone, “That’s the problem. He can’t keep himself out of trouble. He bloody well seeks it out.”
Forlornly, John looked between the black door and down along the pavement- his means of escape. He wondered just how long Mycroft would stalk him in the black car down the busy roads as he walked to get their take-out and milk. Was it worth the headache? Or the hassle? Ignoring either Holmes was a dangerous chance. Sherlock could annoy him to death, threaten his things, and potentially poison him. Mycroft, on the other hand, had other resources. There could be an off-chance that Mycroft would stop traffic to only stalk him. With one last glance at the pavement, John shook his head in defeat. He clambered into the black car, pulling the door shut behind him.
His eyes flickered between the mirror, the road, and the houses, waiting for someone to say stop. When John turned the corner, he felt like he had gotten away with it. He felt adrenaline rushing through his veins, and relief began to wash over him. Is this what criminals feel every time they get away with something? No wonder they’d get addicted to this.
His hands were shaking as he picked up the useless piece of charcoal. He hopelessly glanced around the room, finding other students going fast to work on their sketches, seemingly unaffected of the gorgeous man. Even his neighbor with the awful baseball cap was going to quick work, humming a catchy tune under his breath. John couldn’t focus on anything but the intensive eyes staring among the classroom. If he had…done it… his friendship with Sherlock would become complicated. His attraction would affect his feelings of friendship, which was something that John had worked hard to rebuild again after everything. This was his best friend. His best man. The man who fixed him, who broke him, then fixed him again.
John ignored the detective and cast a look over his shoulder at the DI, who looked somewhat bemused at their exchange.
By the time, John walked on pavement leading to the flat; he was calm, collected, albeit still slightly conflicted. He decided that he would come clean, telling Sherlock everything once the case was solved and they had some down time-usually happened after cases because Sherlock would neglect his body’s needs. They should tackle one problem at a time. John’s mental list so far: One; Solve a murder, Two; catch Sebastian Moran, and lastly three; tell Sherlock about Mycroft’s blackmail, about Moriarty, and the third Holmes.
Well, a second of peace then. John opened his eyes, glaring at the closed loo door, expecting Sherlock to burst through, as he has done before. He covered himself with a small flannel, waiting. Seconds ticked by, and still nothing. John sighed.
John shrugged. Now, he was out of his depth. He couldn’t see what Mycroft could see. He couldn’t see what Mycroft was implying. It was starting to piss him off. He glowered at Mycroft.
A scream echoed through the lab from the mobile. Pain twitched through his leg, John shifted his weight, being careful not to jostle Sherlock or the mobile. The camera pulled away, putting Hageman in full frame. John saw the complete state of injuries now. Both legs were broken too. Someone had dragged Mr. Hageman from his holding cell into the room. The angle zoomed in again.
John snorted. Sherlock had point there. “Alright, well starting from when I was in the car. Mycroft gave me the ‘big brother’ speech.”
“DON’T WHAT? GIVE A DAMN?” bellowed John. His words slashed through the air, and added to the tension growing between them. He sniffed, and shifted his feet, glaring. “It took two of us to get here…I should get some say in EVERYTHING ABOUT HER!”
“Earlier today you viciously protested having to remove your jumper. I don’t want to fathom what would happen if you were required to take off all your clothing. I have reason to believe that you could start foaming at the mouth,” Sherlock grinned. “You did say that it was my turn to ‘strip’ for a case.”
He paused in the doorway, watching confusingly as Sherlock stood up from the floor and stripped his linens from his bed. Then the detective viciously whipped them across the room. The picture of the periodic table shifted precariously on the wall. John crossed Sherlock’s bedroom, righting the picture before it could fall. He turned to face the detective, who perched on his bed on all four limbs, hovering an inch away from the bare mattress.
“Soap is not lube, and the shower is not the best place for penetrative sex. I don’t know about you, but I would rather not slip and fall then make a trip out to A & E for a busted testicle.” John scolded playfully, imagining both of them wet and wrapped in nothing but towels being lifted into an ambulance on a stretcher…
John opened his mouth to correct Sherlock about just whose stomach was hungry in this case when Mrs. Hudson turned over her shoulder.
Leave it to Sherlock to change the topic, and to the hardest one to have. John swallowed heavily. “Sherlock…”
The distorted garble turned John’s attention from the bodies, to the smiling person who asked the question. The Beretta aimed for the man sitting in a wheelchair, dressed in a sharp black suit, legs covered in a pale yellow blanket, next to the water.
A sense of accusations lingered in the air around Greg that he was on Mycroft’s side that Greg knew Mycroft was trying to blackmail him, even knowing about the third Holmes, and Moriarty. There was even the suspicion that Greg was sent there in order to persuade John to keep his mouth shut. His anger wanted him to leap out of red chair, cross the distance, grab Greg’s shoulders and shake him out of Sherlock’s chair for answers. In fact, the only words that John traded with Greg were about take out, and whether or not the detective inspector wanted any. He did not. He might’ve been pissed at him, but John didn’t want to be rude. Well, he hadn’t made tea for anyone, so, he was still rude. Did he feel bad? Not quite. His anger overruled his need to be accommodating. Spite in the small doses, apparently.
At first, John blinked in surprise. Then his heart started pounding. His scar. Sherlock had asked to see and to touch it. He had only let himself alone see the silvery jagged scar tissue in the mirror reflection in the morning. Only himself got to see it if he turned his head. There was not another pair of eyes that had set on his scar, not Mary or any others that had spent time in his bed after he returned to London. It was his reminder to himself that being an army doctor wasn’t enough. It was a trophy of his discharge because he was deemed useless as a soldier. He always wore a vest underneath his shirts to prevent the roughened skin from dragging over fabric so he wouldn’t have to feel it. The scar was an ugly reminder of his demons inside.
He met his reflection again. His shoulders felt lighter somehow. Removing the ring was a step forward. It was time to start anew. To find the happiness that everyone should have, and deserved. Optimism seemed to make his face years younger. He was going to be happy, as he had been yesterday, on a case with Sherlock again.
His hand gestured to ‘Office 129’ and the open doorway. John bit his lip, wishing that he would’ve known the plan. He hadn’t heard or seen Sherlock go in yet but knowing him, he was already in there, looking for the information they needed as soon as Peter had left the office. And as Sherlock put it, he was the diversion.
“The pool.” Mary said with a sigh. John was about to ask what she meant when she continued. “Not that you knew it at the time but I was one of those red lights on you before. That’s his meeting point, tonight, after the pool is closed.”
John shrugged and leaned against the grey-colored wallpaper. “It counts with Mycroft. It’s either blackmail, power demonstrations, or verbal sparring.”
John smiled and started on breakfast preparation quickly, grateful that he didn’t have to sanitize every surface in the kitchen again. That task alone could take hours.
John licked his lips. He stuffed his phone away. “Being called into the clinic, apparently it’s swamped today.”
“It would be a bit difficult to explain to the Yard why I have two broken arms at a crime scene,” countered Sherlock, the upturn of his lips now bloomed into a grin.
“That is interesting…especially when your mirror is slightly off from where you like to keep it. Was it moved?”
“You truly are a romantic, John,” Sherlock huffed out with an accompanied eye roll, making John pull away and hover above Sherlock. Any and all traces of seduction disappeared. John grinned down at Sherlock’s annoyance, happy to welcome back the Sherlock who wasn’t trying to melt his clothing off with his gaze.
“Well, obviously not, and that hardly stops you from bleeding on the floor,” Mrs. Hudson stated flatly before adding. “That’s going to stain.”
John smiled, hovering next to the doorway. “I met his parents.  His mother was lovely, not a bit rude at all. It’s just Sherlock…and Mycroft.”
John glanced over to Sherlock as the taller man flipped his coat collar up. “Nothing but wait until the killer strikes again. Text me with more details.”
“Yes. If we check inside the bedside table, it would confirm that lambskin would be his choice for protection.” John’s eyebrows met his hairline, wondering what Sherlock knew about different types of protection. There was a temptation to ask about it, but upon seeing Sherlock’s focus, John decided against it.
“I thought we did that already. You refused to talk and went to make a call instead. Leaving AJ to babysit us. For your information, he’s still alive, if you cared any. I don’t go around ‘nicely shooting’ everyone, especially making a point not to shoot old teammates or one’s best man.” John gave her a pointed look afterwards.
Stepping closer, John used his fingertips to tilt Sherlock’s face upwards. John ignored Sherlock’s hiss when he flashed the torch in those bright blue eyes. He was relieved that they dilated properly and the redness could be cleared up with a night’s sleep if Sherlock allowed it. He clicked off the professional doctor part of him and placed the torch on the table. Something jumped underneath his fingers. John froze, realizing that his hand had curved up Sherlock’s jaw, his fingertips covering Sherlock’s throbbing pulse. He met grey-green eyes.
“What happens if I do? Will people die?” asked John, thinking back to what Moran had said in the cab. That Moriarty had planned for something to happen, and John could expect it to be a large, grander scale.
He tossed the plug into the sink, hard silicon clattered against porcelain. The sound loud and clear in the bathroom, along with his heavy breathing. John wasn’t going to need that. He decided in that moment that he wasn’t going to go through with his first plan of working the plug back into Sherlock’s body. Not until he got a chance to touch Sherlock first. Few shaky steps later, he paused before the tub, feeling the spray of water land on his feet. Sherlock pulled out of the water, and held out a hand to John.
John’s face contoured with frustration, and a growl spilled from his throat as he remembered Issac Spoo and Douglas Hageman. Both men deserved to answer for their crimes legally, but this man had made it impossible. Moran probably wouldn’t hesitate to shoot John. Just as John wouldn’t hesitate to shoot Moran. A list of possible scenarios went through John’s head. The soldier side of him that he had hid away from London came back to life. All of it came to naught. There was not enough time. John knew, and from the way Moran looked at him, he knew that too.
“Not Mycroft,” came Greg’s voice from the other side with a sigh. “I just want to let you know that I called him. He’s looking into it now. How’s Sherlock? I’ve never seen him like that.”
John peeled out of bed, pushing the tangled white duvet away from him. He tried to lift himself completely out of bed, but with his lower half of his body pinned down, intertwined in Sherlock’s long legs, he motioned Sherlock to let him go. The doctor in him, needed to help Greg. Sherlock leaned over him, and shook his head.
John froze in his seat. The collar of his jacket scratched at the back of his neck. His voice came out steady as he asked, “You have a lead on Mary?”
John noticed right away that he didn’t deny it like any normal person would with those accusations and wasn’t met with either tears or yelling like a rave lunatic. Or threats of bodily harm to Sherlock. Instead, the suspect with the fake name just sat there, waited again for Sherlock to answer his question. And Sherlock did.
The mixture of their colognes and sex combined in the air, along with their voices. Each moan, gasp, sigh, and creak of the bedframe echoed throughout the bedroom.
“Good luck with that, mate,” John chirped back. “I can’t even get him to tidy up the flat. I doubt I’ll be able to stop him from interrogating the criminal or causing chaos in your division.”
“You know you were right about them, you probably just asked to get me to say it,” admitted Lestrade as John rolled his eyes at Sherlock, who appeared to be drinking his coffee innocently, though he could tell that the detective was inwardly preening from making the accurate deduction. “Oliver and Kyle Izard were secretly married. Turns out that Oliver Martin’s parents weren’t keen on their only child’s sexual orientation,” answered the DI with a sigh. “He left the United States when he was eighteen. They’re flying in; I’m glad that I don’t have to deal with that.”
The drawer opened with a wood against wood screech. Inside, was nothing but an outdated black flip phone. Paired with another post it note. Only four words were on that note.
“He was going to tell you, convince you that my feelings for you aren’t…strong, to make you step aside when Mary comes back and leave me.”
The flat door opened before John could say anything. There was silence. John knew what this looked like. He was scantily clad in a towel, dripping wet, perched over Sherlock. His hand angled into the couch for Sherlock’s pocket. From the door, it probably looked bad. Judging from Mrs. Hudson’s widened eyes, a smile blooming across her face, he was right.
John ignored him. The flick of Sherlock’s eyes and the heated blush that followed it told him otherwise. He finished unbuttoning the stupidly tight shirt, and he pushed it from Sherlock’s shoulders. It fell to the floor.
Mrs. Hudson cut him off, as she glanced over her shoulder. Her hands pushed at his shoulder, “John, dear. I’m fine. You should-”
Whatever AJ was going to counter with was lost in a surprised garble when an arm fixed over his windpipe.
“No, that’s ridiculous. Saving her life hardly permits a visitation. I see her often enough in my mind palace as a distraction. Always interrupting when I’m busy,” answered Sherlock with an annoyed grimace. “Why do you ask?”
John rolled his eyes, and cursed his annoying git for not listening. Because of course when had Sherlock Holmes had ever followed instructions, especially John’s? It was infuriating. Sherlock always had to be the one in charge…not this time. John was going to keep his infuriating love safe… even if it’s the only time.
It was nothing new when Sherlock ignored him in favour of other things. Usually ignored him when it came to important things as well, but Sherlock had refused to be bothered. The latest example was Sherlock forgetting to pay his share of the power bill. He, or rather both of them, were distracted to find leads on Mary’s disappearance. This small detail, now more than ever, would make it all but sweeter.
“On maternity leave until the end of the month,” answered Sherlock. Grey eyes trailed up and down his John’s body. “Take off your jumper.”
John asked as he stood and lifted Sherlock along, before he backed towards Sherlock’s bed, facing Sherlock. As the back of his knees touched the edge, he laid down, head on Sherlock’s pillows and displayed all he had, cock standing proud and hard.
The detective inspector stepped inside, and then froze. His eyes now flickered between John, and Sherlock behind him.
He pushed open the car door with both hands. Then paused at the opening, pondering on his current stalemated impromptu plan. The cab going into the post hadn’t been a part of it. Now, John had various backup plans to quickly weight through. There was a risk leaving Moran in the cab, alone, with a gun somewhere among the crushed metal. It was also a risk, having Moran out in the open, either to run, or attack again. Neither was ideal.
Lestrade protested, tailing after them as Sherlock stalked out of the small office, and through New Scotland Yard.
“You’re doing wonderfully, Sherlock,” John praised between biting his cheek, using the pain as a method to keep from coming. “Just a bit more if you’re up for it.”
“There’s a certain spot to stand in the morgue that allows me to hear all conversations in the hallway.”
John chuckled and shook his head. “No, I’m stopping you there. I’m bisexual, discovering that later in life doesn’t change who I am. I want you, so badly, Sherlock, I can’t even think straight.”
“When did you grab that?” he whispered in astonishment, grabbing the firearm and automatically checking the safety. Thankfully, it was still on and Sherlock hadn’t been roaming around with gun that could have potentially misfired.
“Oh, get over it. It was only two months! Sherlock left you for two years. I had thought you would easily forgive me for the abandonment. I was wrong. I couldn’t have you hanging off my gun arm,” she answered. “You would only slow me down.”
John nearly crashed into Sherlock when the consulting detective suddenly stopped. He glanced over the brick building. A faded blue awning hung crookedly over the dark wooden door, the word PUB barely seen even in the sunlight. The windows were dark. Quiet. John read over the business hours tacked on the door.
John straightened when Sherlock’s eyes turned to him, glaring as the taller detective rattled off his deduction. “The jumper, obviously male, mid 30’s. History of substance abuse according to the track marks between his toes but not in his arms, which means he was hiding his habit. Junkie turned unconfirmed killer, perhaps for money or trading his services for product. Hair dyed blond, happened recently. Nothing to…oh!”
He mentally counted the number of rings before the mobile clicked over to Sherlock’s voicemail. He tried again. Voicemail again. “Sherlock, you know it’s me, quit being a wanker and answer the call.”
Sherlock’s mobile rang, the sound echoed in the sitting room. John’s mobile buzzed again. He snatched it out his pocket, read the caller I.D, and accepted the call. He spoke into the mouthpiece before the person on the side could say anything.
“If you must,” Sherlock replied, making a beeline to the microscope with the post its notes and mobile in hand.
He padded through the flat, and entered into a steamed loo. Fog from Sherlock’s shower clung in the air, creating rivets that trailed down the mirror. John quickly stripped down, turned on the still warm tap, and climbed into the tub. He scrubbed down, rinsed, and dried. When John was dressed, he opened the door. He didn’t flinch when he found Sherlock leaning against the wall across the loo, donning the usual belstaff and scarf combination. The light blue shirt on Sherlock took John’s breath away. He started breathing again when the detective held out his folded coat.
