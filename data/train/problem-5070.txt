"Oh, for the love of- Wade!" Tony sat up, hand pressed to his side a little to ease the small ache still in his ribs. "How do you even know about that, you're- Never mind." He shook his head, rubbing at his face with one hand, careful to avoid his nose. He and Steve had been back in the Tower for two days since their run in with the assassin. Winter break was over, it was the weekend, but Wade's Mom was going back to the hospital for another round of treatment, and Tony said he'd make sure that Wade got to school starting on Monday.
But, Tony thought he didn't really have to worry about that at the moment. Jarvis was still running the equations for different elements to replace palladium, but so far there was nothing even close. It didn't mean that Tony was giving up, not by a long shot; he planned on being around for Peter, and Mary, but Tony was a futurist. And if he didn't find something soon, Tony wasn't going to have a future. Why drag someone else down with him in some kind of relationship, only to possibly break their heart? Not worth it.
"I've got scans running now, but it seems to me that this thing is growing." Tony was looking over some of the calculations that Jarvis was able to start pulling up. "It's not fast, but it's steadily increasing."
"So the internet says." William snickered a bit, Rachel backhanding his shoulder a little. "Are you going to try and intercept Peter before he gets back to Steve?"
Peter was concentrated, determined, to make it over to his Daddy. He put one unsteady foot out in front him, followed by the other, letting go completely of the table. He did it again, then again, quick steps propelling him over to Tony before he almost fall into Tony's arms. Tony grinned at him and picked him up.
Stark snarled, nostrils flaring. "No one will keep me from my son. No one will stop me from keeping him safe! Not even you!" Steve's eyes widened a little in surprise, at both his words and the intense anger that coated them. Stark lifted his arms, bring them back and slamming the end of the scepter against Steve's shield, jerking him a little. Steve put his free hand behind the shield and lifted up with all his strength, causing Stark to stumble back a couple of steps.
"Yeah, walk with me. I'm going to give you the meeting of you life." Pepper headed them for the door to the parking garage. "Your office."
"Judging from that video you sent me two days ago, he's a happy kid." Rhodey knew that he was comparing himself to Howard, he always would compare himself to that man.
Steve leaned in to kiss his cheek. “I do know that you can do this.” He put his hand on Tony’s leg, giving it a quick squeeze. “I’ll be right there in the lobby, waiting for you. Come on.” Steve slipped his hand into Tony’s, tangling their fingers.
"The world hasn't changed a bit," Steve bit out as Thor and Natasha walked through the door. Another SHIELD agent that was lying to him.
There was a picture in multiple posts, of Steve and Tony walking into the office building, holding hands as Steve reached for the door handle. There were a few different shots, but they were all caught after they had gotten out of the car, and with the names of those who worked in the building in most shots.
"I believe that he is, and I listened when you said that he sometimes impulsively does stuff," she murmured, heading for her bedroom. "I guess it's just different to witness it firsthand." She glanced at Steve. "He's an absolute menace."
“Tell me,” Steve said as he moved his head down, kissing across Tony’s collar bone. “Tell me everything you feel and see. Please?” One of his hands slid down Tony’s chest, down to his waist, tracing muscles, and bones down to his hip.
"We have an idea, but we're not sure yet," Steve admitted. "We're looking into it now, but I highly doubt that it's going to be information that we want released."
"Howard Stark is the other half of Project Rebirth," Steve started to say. "He's the one who created my shield."
"That scepter was working us," Tony interrupted him. Captain America doesn't apologize to Tony Stark. "You probably felt weird at some point, all fuzzy in the head. Wasn't your fault, it's why we all kind of exploded."
"Sure, I guess." Steve hadn't even finished the words and Tony was heading back into the bedroom. He swallowed a little and answered the phone, putting the phone to his ear. "Hel-"
"Uh, thanks," Tony said, and Steve blinked. "For keeping an eye out for Peter, you know, when I can't." Tony shrugged a little, put his hands in his pockets, and walked off down the sidewalk, already crossing the street by the time Steve had gotten to his feet. He could see the man was having a hard time dealing with unable to be with his son, and Steve felt for the man. He didn't know how he would be able to deal with it if he was in the same position. If Steve had had a kid when he was still Captain America, and in the spotlight. He wouldn't want them to know about his son or daughter, to keep them safe, but he was also making some frightening enemies at the time too, and he wouldn't put his family in danger.
"No one can keep Tony under constant surveillance," Mary commented. Pepper noted her casual use of Tony's first name, and it seemed that she was starting to put things together. "Today has no connection to what happened almost three years ago." Mary just wanted all of this to be over. There was a tangled knot in her stomach that she just couldn't shake, and she didn't like it.
"Yeah, but avoiding him isn't going to help with tha- Ow!" Bucky shoved his leg, knocking his knee against the table, and slid out of the booth. "She lives at the Tower you know," Tony said to him before he could get too far. "If you're going to continue being around her, for whatever reason, you're going to run into him." Bucky grunted and he was out the door.
"Captain Rogers," Jarvis spoke through the ceiling, catching Steve a little by surprise. "If Young Master can make his way to the private elevator, Sir has a secure safe room that I can take him too, if that is agreeable with you."
"Please don't get angry." Tony pushed himself up, leaning back on his elbows, looking at Steve. He never would have thought that Steve Rogers would take advantage of the situation, but he had been surprised before. "Have you been avoiding talking about what happened in the gym last week?"
Tony tracked Thor easily enough, following the energy signature that his hammer left behind. He was still with Loki, a hand on his neck. Tony boosted and slammed into Thor's side, throwing him to the ground, making him slide against the ground.
"While you were gone, I was able to set up a particle accelerator down by one of the engines," Bruce told him right away. He had heard whisperings about Mary, and knew that he needed to get Tony that new element immediately.
“Then I’ll go and ask her to teach us.” Wade turned on his foot, every intention to go to the kitchen, and probably get turned down, but he’d do it.
Tony's ear didn't even pop as he went through the portal, but a chill washed over him. The suit started to fail, the HUD going dark, Peter's voice was cut off. He let go of the missile, saw that he had at least guided it to the Chitauri mothership, or whatever it was, was going to be. The life support systems failed, his oxygen leaking out from the damage the suit sustained. He gasped for breath, tears in his eyes. But Peter was safe.
When he couldn't sleep at night, he found himself down in his workshop, working on the the new prototype for the armor. He had the boots figured out, and he was working on a flight stabilizer now.
"I don't have PTSD," Tony bit out. "Just nightmares sometimes, it's fine." Tony pushed himself up from the couch.
In the morning, Steve tore himself away from Tony’s side, Jarvis promising to send updates to his phone while he was away. He went down to Mary’s floor to greet the kids for breakfast, attempting to keep up appearances. He hadn’t heard anything from Strange, or heavens above, Loki, and he wasn’t sure if no news was good news, or if they were too busy with something happening to inform him of it.
"Try and show him that things will stay about as normal as they can," Tony nodded. "Also, I missed him, like, a lot. So, you'll know where to find me, but please try not too until later in the afternoon." He gave a salute to the two men in the room as he left, heading up to grab his son.
“Agent got Mary into a wheel-chair, Bruce’s orders, so they’re both in there with Peter.” Tony finished his coffee and stared forlornly at the mug. “And now I have to wait until they’re done to get more coffee, because I’m not allowed back into the kitchen.”
Tony looked between Mary, then Coulson, then Steve, then back to Coulson, and back to Mary. "Phil proposed last night," Mary eventually told him.
Tony rolled his neck before heading up the stairs to the living room where Obie was. That last crash in his workshop set off some forgotten aches from not sleeping, and playing with Peter. It had been nearly three weeks now since the press conference, and Mary was able to sneak into Tony's drive with Peter now, and Tony was able to sneak out to go see Peter at night.
"I know that this isn't the greatest situation," words starting to tumble out of his mouth. "I had hoped to be back by now, and I'm not, and it just, it sucks. I know I left and you were still mad at me, and I'm really sorry. This doesn't make up for that, or for whatever I've been putting you through by being gone, and I don't blame you for avoiding private calls with me most of the time. Tony, I miss you so much, and the best part of my day, are the days that I get to see you and Peter on my computer screen." Steve reached out, cupping Tony's cheeks with both hands. "I have been thinking for weeks on how to try and make this up to you, and every idea I've had has fallen flat, but I knew that I didn't want to miss today. I didn't want you to be alone one more year on Valentine's Day."
"Why are you looking at me? I'm no one's Handler," she hissed at Steve. "I just had the bad taste in men."
"Well, you were talking to my new boss, so I came here with government clearance." Tony raised an eyebrow at her answer. "I didn't tell you, I got a new job."
Also, if it wasn't clear before, I'm a huge Supernatural nerd/fan. I have no regrets to the references that keep sneaking into this story. I also talked a bit about the cherry allergy in my Tumblr, just how I discovered it and my own reactions. If you're interested, here's
"Says the man who helped with an alien invasion," the woman bit back. "Alright, short version, I'm in Baltimore bringing the twins to see their paternal grandparents- Long story, I'll explain later. And I knew that Steve was still in DC, and he told me a couple days ago that I should stop by, and we'd have lunch, and he could see how big their getting, not the point. Point is, I called to let him know I was in town, that the twins were secure for a few hours. He picked up, but didn't say anything, and the line went dead. He calls my back phone three times, not letting it ring enough for me to pick it up though."
"That's what I do." Tony said with a light air, but a heavy heart. That's what he did, and that's what had gotten him with an arc reactor in his chest. Before he knew it the computer was running, Tony was locked in the suit, and Yinsen had this look in his eye.
Steve frowned and they vaguely heard the nurse leaving, closing the door again. "What do you mean? They're not with the Avengers." Bucky straightened and left the bathroom, whispering a question to the woman in the bed. Steve stepped out as Bucky was already moving, Meg looking a little pale.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve. “Ruby, go back to your sisters,” he tried to keep his voice even, his Flareon didn’t deserve any anger that he was feeling towards Rogers at the moment. She let a soft rumble, not wanting to move. “Ruby.” A short trill, and then he heard Ruby trotting away.
"He was in all black, even a black mask. He was wearing it like the color was about to disappear from existence," Tony started rambling out. "He also did a lot of staring, like talking was overrated. And then he, you know, shot me."
"No, something must have come up," Tony mumbled, leaning against a counter. "He still had uneasy feelings about some of the missions that SHIELD was sending them on, and he was still pretty upset about the new Helicarriers being housed at the Triskelion." Tony had helped Fury with the designs to upgrade the camouflage tech, and the engines. He switched them over to his repulsor technology so that there was less of a chance of a repeat performance from nearly a year ago. "Something isn't sitting right, Bruce."
"But," Natasha picked up, "it would be best if you stayed inside." Tony looked at her, his expression going back and forth between "you've-got-to-be-kidding-me" and "are-you-actually-suggesting-this?"
“So you would just lean against the car, watching school get out?” Steve asked as they got out of the car, walking towards the school. “Like a creeper, who was plotting which child they would take when no one was looking?”
"Why do you think that?" Steve asked, walking over to them, glancing at all the broken glass on the floor.
"I'm fine," he said, turning away from the windows and walking over to the bar to set the glass down. She raised an eyebrow at the amber liquid. "Relaxes me to just pour a glass and hold it. Wasting a lot of good scotch, but," he shrugged one arm, "creature comforts. Listen, really, I'm fine. Captain Guard Dog has already been checking up on me, and I'm already upgrading Jarvis. There's no sign of the-"
"Huh?" Steve glanced at his phone. "Oh! No, not yet, but he's not happy. I think that might actually be an understatement." Tony snorted and Steve smirked a little. "No, Natasha sent me a message."
"I'll say that I'm glad that Wade's moving in at the same time." Steve raised a questioning eyebrow. "He's almost eight now, but acts like a twelve-year-old, and now introducing a new baby in the mix? I don't know." He shrugged. "I can't predict this one. I was an only child, and I didn't have parents that paid the right attention to me." Tony felt Steve's foot nudging his and he smiled a little. "He's had shared attention from Mary and I, and he took it really well when Mary got married, and when we got together."
"We're co-parents," Mary shrugged a little, like everything she did was no great trial. Dealing with Tony Stark was always a trial. "We have to present a united front to raise our little boy. Not only do we look out for Peter, but we look out for each other."
"Well, I grabbed what I made, but they didn't leave me in that lab all the time." Tony took a drink of his pop. "I didn't have time to mess with their computer systems, but I tried not to record the entire formula for them. Aren't you supposed to be watching Meg?"
"Put on the suit," Steve said lowly, deadly. "Let's go a few rounds." Tony pressed his teeth together. He was ready to go-
"I've got movement across the street," Clint called out. "They really don't want us touching this machine."
"I'm using that to my advantage, you know this, right?" Tony grinned as he slid forward to grab the door for them.
"I'm okay," Peter said, setting his backpack down by the empty dining room chair next to the one that Steve had been sitting in. Steve closed the door and went back over to the table. He grabbed the booster seat that Mary had gotten for Peter just for his place, and placed it on the chair as Peter pulled out his school book, sketchbook, and pencil case. "Mom said that if I got my weekend homework done before she got back from work, then she would get me some new colored pencils tomorrow." Peter grinned as he climbed up into the seat, Steve taking his own seat again.
Steve glanced to the side when he caught movement and saw Tony walking towards him. He put a finger to his lips and nodded towards Peter and Jamie. Tony saw them and tried to move silently. They saw Jamie wiggling around, moving her legs, never looking away from Peter. Tony tiled his head curiously and Steve just shrugged.
"That's why I've got clip-ons!" Tony said with a grin, tickling Peter. "Come on, kiddo, if you finish getting dressed we can go see Mama before everyone else gets here."
Tony huffed out a breath and yanked the door open to the Penthouse floor. Peter was crouched behind the couch, away from the windows, where they could see a small plume of black smoke floating past. He rushed over and wrapped his arms around Peter. "You okay?"
"From what I remember, that's pretty fast." There was a sound, like the phone being fumbled, and Tony glanced up from his work. There was the beep of a few buttons being pressed, then the familiar burble from Peter.
"Yeah. There's a reservoir of emotions inside of me, somewhere." Tony waved a hand around his body. "And it's been tapped too many times over the past week. Really, it's a slow filling thing, and I don't think it's very big, honestly."
"He's not wrong about Loki, though." Bruce set the computer back to the search, and walked over to the arc reactor with Tony. "Moment of truth." Bruce tapped the side of Tony's neck and he nodded, grasping the new arc reactor.
"Those would take some time," she countered, eyes narrowing a little at him. He was up to something.
“Yay!” Jamie lifted her arms in success and Tony winked at her as he stood up with her in his arms. She giggled and grinned.
“I know,” Steve took his hand, giving it a squeeze as they went to bed. “I just needed to make sure, you know that.”
“I might have let you know in a couple of days,” Tony told her. “Was thinking about going up to the Malibu house for a day. How do you know where I am? Talk to Mary?”
In Tony's mind, one of two things was going to happen. In the hour that it had taken for Tony to reach the podium, George could have easily dropped the pictures to his contacts, and they would ask about Peter right away, or the first question would be about the Avengers. Or he'd have to tell them all that that's what they were calling themselves. Tony was hoping for the secret third option of his sexuality.
"I know, and I wouldn't ask if it wasn't necessary," Coulson said quietly, urgently. "We're trying to track Loki as we speak, but we'd like you and Banner with us on the Hellicarrier as soon as possible."
“They’re breaking down your defenses, aren’t they?” Bucky narrowed his eyes a little, then felt Meg slip something into his pocket. “Those make for great bribes for the boys.”
Bucky dropped his hand on Wade’s head briefly. “She’s not coming back. Come on, let’s get back home. The Fitzgerald’s are making dinner tonight.” Wade nodded and hopped into the car. Bucky did one last look around the area, and got in the driver’s seat. He’d tell Meg, and Jarvis when they got back. Maybe the rest of the Avengers would take it seriously if it came from the AI. They could come up with a plan before Tony and Steve got back, because those two did need the little break.
“I’m not sure, but, Tony,” Steve let out a sigh. “I don’t know what happened, but, when I found him- Tony, I think he shot his Dad.” Tony’s eyes widened almost comically. “I heard the shots, and when I got into the room, the man was dead, and Wade was holding the gun. From what I saw it was self-defense, I’m not worried about that.”
Peter sat on the floor, staring at Jamie, also sitting on the floor. She had her hands resting on the coffee table, but she was staring back at him. Mr Steve was in the kitchen, getting together a couple of bottles, because thankfully, Jamie wasn’t coming with them to get haircuts. This was special, just for him, Daddy, and Mr Steve. He hoped that Daddy and Mr Steve got married soon so he could call Mr Steve something else.
"Fine, put him through," Tony said as he followed Peter back out to the living room, where his weekend homework was waiting.
The next day Tony had been unable to help with decorating for Peter’s birthday. As soon as the little boy had seen that Tony was awake, he had plastered himself to his Daddy’s side. He and Wade made sure that Tony felt better, and that he wouldn’t get sick again. It took Tony having to trap them on the couch in the morning with a blanket and a movie, while Steve cooked them birthday pancakes. Mary, Coulson, Bruce, and Bucky were on decorating duty, and Steve would join them. Rachel and William were making the cake and the rest of the food, along with the kitchen staff downstairs.
"What if I want to hold the Peter?" Steve said, trying to walk away with Peter still in the hug hold.
Mary gave him a little smile, one that Tony knew meant she was containing the grin she wanted to give him, but knew that Tony Stark did not do emotions. "I think that Peter will be overjoyed to know that he's not going to be so far away from his Daddy. And, my parents should be bringing him back home anytime."
"Yeah, I get it," Steve nodded, watching Peter play with another little boy. He was taller, with sandy blonde hair, and he was pushing Peter on the swings.
Tony blinked when he saw that Steve's playlist was active, and new songs were starting to show up. "Jarvis? Steve's still in Michigan, right?"
Now, as for the story! This is the second to last chapter, and I know I'm going over 200k words with this chapter. Next update, which won't be nearly as long as this one took to come, will be the last chapter, but then I'll also post a preview for what's going to happen in the story after that. It's been requested in the comments, and I can confirm that we will be seeing a teenaged Peter! We will be seeing Spiderman! With the way the story will progress, we'll probably get more Spiderman as more info about Spiderman Homecoming, comes. I'm always adamant about not putting any spoilers for recent movies in the stories, so what I'll be pulling is how they portray Spiderman, and what kind of powers/gadgets that he has. Because I really like Tom Holland as Peter. :)
“He willingly admitted that Jamie was going?” Tony asked, not moving from his prone position on the bed.
Black clad shoes hit the ground just in front of Tony’s face and they were off again, jumping at the agents at the SUV’s door, a soft female grunt reaching his ears. “Need a little help?” The cuffs fell off of Tony’s wrists as one of his briefcase suits landed on the ground.
“You’re the fun Uncle,” Steve said as he looked at Jamie, dropping a kiss on the top of her head. “Of course she’s not going to go to sleep when you want her too, if she’s not tired enough.” Her little face scrunched up adorably, and she let out a big yawn. Jamie looked betrayed at the yawn. “Oh baby girl, you are so tired. If you go to sleep, you get to eat with Daddy and me. Keep a close eye, Buck.” Steve turned on his foot, still bouncing her, but started to sway gently, slowly walking around the room. A hand was on her back, rubbing circles, cradling her against his shoulder. “There are certain steps, if you take them just right, she’ll slip right off into sleep. I’m taking advantage of it now, before the pattern changes.”
"Mr Steve!" Peter's worried shout came through the coms and he blinked. Thor glanced over at him. "Mr Steve! I was talking to Daddy and then he was gone! Jarvis lost the signal, and he can't get him back!" The Hulk jumped from a building, wrapping his arm around Tony, catching him. "Mr Steve, where's Daddy?"
"Ah," Mary said, a little wrinkle between her eyes. "I don't think there's any hiding it anymore, not that he was trying to in the first place." Mary grabbed her towel and wiped her forehead, and faced Steve. "Tony is jealous."
Steve heard a movie running from the main living room when he got back up to the Penthouse, and he saw Rachel and William on the couch with Peter in between them. William had glanced over and Steve gave him a little wave as William motioned towards the stairs. Steve jogged up the stairs and took a detour down the hall to the bedrooms, peeking in to see that Jamie was down for her nap, but didn’t see Tony there. He walked down the hall, then paused when he thought he heard the soft sound of a piano. It wasn’t coming from the movie that they were watching downstairs, and it wasn’t coming from the speakers. Steve only knew of one spot that had a piano.
"I need you to go pick up Peter." Tony grinned. "Pepper is gone for a couple days, I was told to lay low by Obie, and all the work that I could be doing down in the workshop can't happen until Jarvis is done running models and specs."
Steve reached over the back of the couch, tapping Tony's head with his finger, drawing him back from his thoughts. Tony shot Steve a little smile, a movie lighting up the TV screen in the living room. It didn't take long until the boys had finished their hot cocoa, and it had the desired effects that Tony had expected. Barely half way through the movie and they had fallen asleep, Peter leaning into Tony, and Wade leaning into Steve.
Tony sat up, gasping for air, chest heaving, eyes wide. He pulled his legs from the tangled sheets and sat over the edge of the bed. Hands gripped the edge of the bed, trying to get rid of the shaking in his limbs. "J?" Tony said quietly, not trusting his voice.
Peter very carefully, and slowly, pushed himself from his bed, feet softly touching the ground. He liked the glow on the floor. It was a warm blue, which Peter knew almost couldn't happen. Mr Steve had been teaching him about colors, and blue was a cool color, not warm, like red. But Jarvis would put a ring of yellow around the blue, but not enough to turn the light green. Peter really liked learning about colors, almost as much as he liked working with his Daddy in the workshop with Dum-E.
“I’m lucky to have kept Peter out of the spotlight as long as I did, so we just need to reaffirm that cameras are not to approach him, but it’s not secret. And I’ve never hidden the fact that I’m bi,” Tony pointed out. “I need to talk to Steve about this tonight, though.”
"Get down!" He barely heard Rhodey shouting back, but he could see his arm movements. "Get down!" Tony could do that, he could get down, get to safety. Ducking down, he ran, trying to present as little of a target as possible. There! He could take cover behind those rocks, boulder, whatever!
"Well, there was the destroyed Penthouse," Tony said, adding a dramatic sniffle for effect. "I was gonna live on that floor, and below that I had a guest floor for Mary and her parents." Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "Just because Rachel doesn't like me, doesn't mean I can't be nice." And there was that warm Captain America smile. "The first thirty floors were going to be offices for SI, with another ten floors for R&D-"
“Good to see you up. Do you think you could grab something to restrain her?” Mary asked, and Tony blinked. “Tony, afraid we don’t have time for your brain to catch up. Take my words for true, help me out, and I’ll explain later. Somebody’s trying to hack into Jarvis.”
Steve felt his hackles raising. "I'm sorry, isn't everything?" Steve turned to face Tony full on. The two looked at each other, the others still fighting in the background.
But this worked to Tony's advantage when they went to go pick up Peter. That meant that as he sat it he backseat, the press wouldn't see him through the tinted windows, and they weren't followed. He of course had dark sunglasses, and a baseball hat, the most cliche of disguises, but it seemed to work.
"I'll give you the signal before the song start," Coulson said as he finished getting the corsage of lavender straight. He walked over to Steve, tugging a bit at the end of his jacket, and nodded. "Probably time to get the boys." Steve put a hand on Coulson's shoulder and smiled at him.
Tony took a breath, and pushed himself away from the desk. He grabbed his jacket, and the keys to the town car. He really did not want to get another look from Mary's mother if he was late again.
"I don't have time for that." Tony brought up a screen with a flick of his good wrist, showing the number of phone calls, texts, and voicemails he already had just from that morning. "There was an alien attack yesterday and-"
"That's good," Steve smiled and nodded. "I bet when she gets home the Doctors will tell her to get more rest." He noticed Tony from the corner of his eye leaning down next to Jamie, looking over the jumping device. Jamie was looking down at Tony's feet, seeing his socks, and he knew that they wouldn't last if she had her way. "She'll be back to normal in no time." Peter nodded happily, peering up at the food on the counter. "Why don't you get cleaned up for dinner, we got some guests coming over."
"Oh, oh no," Tony shook his head. "Mary, you need to take this man away. This burden is too big for the amount of cheese he just sliced."
Putting the last of the more difficult dishes in the dishwasher, Tony turned to see Steve squeezing out the different frosting into their own bowls, before adding a few other ingredients. The cupcakes were already in the oven, and it seemed that Steve was even taking over the frosting duty. Joke was on him though, Peter had already told Tony exactly how he wanted the cupcakes.
"Because, I saw Steve leave your room this morning." Tony pulled the blanket back enough to raise an eyebrow at Steve. "Did you two have sex in here? I don't wanna sit on dirty sheets."
"Okay," he whispered as Steve put him down. He shuffled into the elevator, and Steve gave him a salute. He saw Peter salute back as the elevator doors closed. Taking a breath, Steve stood back up, and pulled his cowl back up and over his head, and adjusted the shield on his arm. He turned back around, and froze in place.
"Jarvis, lights," Tony murmured, pushing himself up. He was in sweat pants, but pulled off his t-shirt that was drenched in sweat now. As he pulled on a new shirt, he slipped on his shoes, heading down to the workshop, snapping the bracelets the entire way down. Maybe he could get the punching bags up before Steve woke up, surprise him at his next workout.
Tony couldn’t resist running his hand through Peter’s hair as he started to eat, before turning to his own plate. “Is everyone gonna be at my party, like last year?” Peter asked in between bites of his breakfast. Tony glanced at Steve. The last he had known there was a standoff between Clint and Natasha, and Bucky, (and by extension Meg.) The two Avengers weren’t going to show up if Bucky and Meg were going to be there. Steve had growled a little, thinking that it was unfair to make them not show up. If Captain America trusted them, then that should have been enough, but Barton and Romanoff didn’t agree. Peter spent more time with Uncle Bucky and Miss Meg more than he did the other two, but they also weren’t to make the boy choose.
"I'm afraid so, Sir." Tony didn't like it when Jarvis spoke like he was sorry. "The palladium levels in your blood appear to be increasing, with the increased use of the arc reactor and the Iron Man suit." Tony rubbed his face with one hand as he listened to Jarvis. "Unfortunately, the device that is keeping you alive, is also killing you."
“See, there you go, taking your bad influence award back,” Steve told him, reluctantly letting him go. Tony stuck his tongue out at him before moving into the bathroom.
"Looks like something that SHIELD field teams could take out on their own, honestly." Tony was just skimming, it looked like experiments on animals gone wrong, plain and simple. So far no reports of civilian casualties, minimal injuries. Most of the animals were dumpster rodents; skunks, possums, a few cats and dogs as well. They had grown in size, and no doubt were more vicious. "Containment looks like the best idea until I can get a sample of whatever was used on them. From what I can read it looks like a bunch of strays were used, animals that would have been done a kindness of a quiet death on the streets than the tests they were subjected too."
Secondly, I've posted a one-shot featuring Mary and Steve. It's in the series, and it's set between Chapter 6 & 7 of this fic. It's totally fun, all comedy and fluff. Steve is dancing, Mary is dancing, there's Justin Timberlake, and My Best Friend's Wedding references. (All you really need to know about that movie, is the last scene between Jules and George.) There'll be a few more one-shots coming, as well, and then a few multi-chapter fics that are much shorter than this one, and the next.
Bucky walked over to Tony and Steve quietly, then looked over at Peter and Jamie. He raised an eyebrow. “I thought he didn’t like her?” He asked quietly as they watched Peter try to get her to move her legs.
"Yes, immediately. Oh, be sure to let him know that his new nickname is going to be Chewy-Bear. No, Wookie-Bear!” Tony started to laugh again.
"That means you're a smart man, Rogers." Tony twirled the tablet in his hands a little. "Listen, since you've trapped me here and asked me to spill why things make me uncomfortable, you gotta do me a favor now." Steve raised an amused eyebrow. "Peter is no doubt going to want to go swimming with Wade at some point. It may not be today, may not be tomorrow, but it's going to happen." Steve nodded. The boys had wanted to go to the beach or the pool a lot last summer. "So, you get to take them swimming."
-"truth is." Mary looked back over, hearing Tony's voice, hearing his hesitation. She didn't like where this was going. "I am Iron Man." The press room exploded with shouting and pictures, and Mary just wanted to facepalm. This was going to make it difficult, again, for them to be a family without the press.
"Why does it matter?" Mary asked him, eyes narrowing a little. Tony took the paper out of his pocket, handing it to her.
"-case you needed to kill me, but you can't!" Bruce's shout caught Tony's attention. "I know, I tried!" What? "I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out!" Tony felt his stomach drop at the confession. "So I moved on. I focused on helping other people," he glanced over at Tony. "I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk!" Bruce directed these lines to Fury and Natasha. "You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?"
His eyes cracked open a little and he pressed his body back down into the bed when he saw a pair of young brown eyes less than two inches away from his face. They weren't Peter's eyes, these had a tinge of green to them. "Hell, Wade," Tony breathed out, relaxing his body a little. "Why are you that close to me?"
“I’m not doing anything,” Tony said with a grin. “Well, except for providing the court for it to happen, but that’s because I don’t want to pay for damages to any public spot.” Tony wiggled his fingers, urging Steve closer. He let go of Bucky and walked over, putting on the coy smile that made Tony tingle in his chest, and wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck. Tony kissed him slowly, arm around his waist, giving a one finger salute when Bucky started to make gagging noises.
“What were you humming?” Steve asked after a few minutes. “I liked it. It sounded familiar.” Tony wiggled his nose a little, and bit his bottom lip.
"I'll be there a bit later," Bruce said. He was in borrowed SHIELD clothing now. "I'm gonna help the staff here."
"You're going to be dangerous when you get older kid," Tony said ruffling his hair a bit. There would be no saving either boys hair for the wedding. "Alright, get to work you two." Tony dropped into the chair that Steve had been sitting in earlier.
"Well, the arc reactor is running off of palladium, and it's implanted in my chest, and it's keeping me alive." Tony rushed everything out at once. "And I need your help trying to find a suitable replacement element."
"Well, there's a note in there from the Director, Fury. Says that Howard thought I was the only one with the means and know-how to finish what he started." Tony wrinkled his nose a little, thinking about the note.
"He's a menace," Bucky grumbled as he and Steve went into the kitchen. Steve nodded with a short hum, "But you live with him?"
Tony turned her so she was facing Steve now, but was still sitting on his leg. “Oh, it’s going to be very unhappy for her growing up if she doesn’t break out of the sweeping movements phase,” Tony commented. “Seriously baby girl, that’s most of my life. I’m an active talker.”
Jarvis brought up the outside camera, showing Romanoff and Barton coming to the house. The door was unlocked and they walked in, each with one duffle bag over their shoulders. Steve was waiting in the foyer for them, and he put a hand on Barton's shoulder. As Tony watched them it was now obvious that Steve had worked with them before.
Tony rested his head on Steve's neck, using his own natural heat to press against the temperature sensitive skin there. And it would work out, right? He and Mary were best of friends, right on the same level as he and Rhodey, and they had a child together. Tony was positive that Steve was genuine with Peter, and that Peter liked Steve with honest child-like trust and innocence, not because he was Captain America.
“I di’ it! I di’ it!” She exclaimed, (not quite sounding out the ‘T’), and bounced on her feet, excited. Steve couldn’t help it as his grin got wider and bigger.
"Either that or we coulda just kept living together," Steve said tentatively, not sure how much Bucky was remembering. The light blue eyes that met his said that Bucky didn't remember much, and it was a surprise to even remember that.
Mary shot up from the bed, rage radiating from her body, and Steve even took a step back. “What is he even doing alive?? I was pretty damn okay with it when Thor told us he died.” Steve put a hand on her arm to keep her in one place. No doubt that she would be on her way down to Greenwich in no time if Steve didn’t stop her. “Why isn’t he here right now stopping this! Why isn’t he doing something!” Mary looked at Steve, starting to frown deeply. “What are we going to tell Peter?”
Tony hadn't been expecting everyone to leave as soon as Thor and Loki did though. Clint and Natasha had to get back to SHIELD, already spending way too long away. Bruce said he would stay, but Tony had been expecting that. What had really caught Tony by surprise was when Clint and Natasha had shown up with Steve's old motorcycle, he knew that Steve wasn't going to stay. The old bike offered him a chance to get out and experience more, that wasn't part of a mission.
"What the hell was that," Bruce looked at Tony as he walked back over. Tony heard Steve start the motorcycle, heard the engine roar, before it took off down the road.
"Yeah," Tony nodded. "It's all cleared with the nurses, and I'm sure you'll behave here just like you do at my place." Wade snuggled into Julie's side, and she kissed the top of his head.
“I really doubt that it’s more important than knowing that Loki is actually, in fact, alive,” Clint said tightly.
"Eww!" Peter said as he laughed, kicking his feet in the air. "But they can't eat each other, everyone needs a face!" Peter looked at Mary and Phil. "Mama! Phil! Don't each faces, there are blueberry pancakes instead." No one could resist a giggle at Peter's words.
“Get over here, I’ve got the boots for you,” Tony said, tugging on one of Steve’s sleeves. He used Steve’s momentum and pulled him into a kiss, letting out a hum of appreciation. “Jedi’s are good kissers.” Jamie let out a little coo and they both turned to look at her as she tried to pull the Ewok hood down over her face. “No, not allowed!”
Steve bit his lip, regretting his last line. He didn’t mean that, but he just couldn’t understand why Tony had Evelyn, and why he didn’t say anything before. He’d have to apologize to Tony, but it was clear that he was going to have to wait now. Steve thought that he should continue with his initial plan for the day, to take Vee to go visit Peggy. It would give him and Tony some time to cool down.
" Tony's eyes widened when he heard Peter's voice. He whipped his head around to look, but nothing had changed around him. Wanda backed away then, fingers over her mouth.
"Natasha, stop!" Steve shouted, trying to get back in between them, but the spy moved them and pushed Steve back. There was a cry, and Steve and Meg's head snapped to the side, the baby monitor from the living room lighting up from the sound. The next sound of electricity sparking caught Steve's ear, but it was Meg's hand catching Natasha's arm that made his eyes widen. Suddenly Natasha was on the defensive and being pushed back, now the sounds of two upset babies in the background.
"You got it," Tony said with a nod as he moved through the lab. "Default date night initiative is go. I'm rooting for Dean." Bruce looked between them, not sure what to make of the easy back and forth they had they, how natural it worked for them.
Tony put his hand on Steve's chest, smiling as he teared up. "I won't give up on us," Tony sang back to him in a whisper. "Even if the skies get rough. I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up." Steve leaned in and Tony eagerly met his lips for a kiss. It was warm, and tender, but strong, and everything that Tony needed, and wanted. "You're such a fucking sap." Steve smiled at him, his whole face seeming to light up. Tony wrapped his arms around his neck and they kissed again, Steve's arms winding around his waist, holding them close. "But, you're my sap, cause I'm in love with you, too."
Tony walked over, sitting on the other side of Peter, and saw that Peter was explaining how to use icons on the desktop, and moving them to the task bar for shortcuts. The neighbor didn't know how to use a computer? As soon as Tony sat down though, Peter's hopeful brown eyes turned to him.
Steve had expected that Tony would have made a floor for everyone. "So, when Mary said that she would be staying here...?"
“Yeah, on the last day. It’s been a while since we’ve been there, and Steve hasn’t seen it. I figure Peter can give him the tour, and we can get a beach day in without being surrounded by several thousand people.”
“Prince Philip it is!” Peter said, thrusting his arm in the air triumphantly. Tony chuckled and opened the door to their suite. “What Prince do you think Daddy is?” He asked Steve, and now Steve was grinning at Tony.
Tony felt his back straighten, and he held himself differently. The twins noticed this immediately. "What right do you have to force me to experiment on her??" He hissed out, pulling his wrist away from Pietro. "You know, you may have volunteered for whatever Strucker did to you, but she did not. She didn't even have a right to her creation."
"Tony Stark, asking me for a favor?" He had Bruce invested in the favor at least. "Alright, my curiosity is peeked, against better common sense."
"You mean, ask me if I would be a joint godfather with you?" Steve smiled and nodded, and Tony couldn't help but chuckle at his excitement. "You're like a little puppy, you know that? You're going to spoil them as Uncle Steve."
"Me-thinks that you have been planning this out for a while." She tapped the date in September, tapping out a phrase. 'Wedding - Will Attend On Pain Of Death By Bride'. As she hit save, another alert popped up on the screen, and Coulson reached over to tap it.
"Like, he doesn't want to be around me, but he doesn't say anything because Peter likes me." Steve frowned. "I don't think he's ever actually said my name. He usually calls me, Neighbor"
"Why is that the first question you ask?" Steve looked at him then turned back to the food. In non-combat and mission situations, his face projected his emotions for everyone to see. "I feel like that's something I should be asking you."
Steve tried to wrangle Jamie into some socks, and when Tony came out she had already pulled one sock off, again. “Are we trying the socks thing again?” Tony asked, a towel wrapped around his neck. “Because I’m not looking forward to having to invest in a company that sells socks for kids.”
"She's all out of food." Tony giggled and shot up from his chair running for the bedroom when Steve went to reach out for him.
"Tony," Steve breathed out, wrapping his arms around Tony. Before he could hug him too tightly, Tony angled his chest away. When Steve started to frown, the genius motioned downwards with his head. Steve's eyes widened when he realized what he was looking at.
"Steve gave me express permission to talk to you like you just some normal middle class working man." Tony gave an offended gasp and she grinned. "See, it works so well."
“No, those are just babblings,” Tony said as he dropped next to Steve on the bench, setting down two trays with several paper plates on them. “They’re on their way to becoming words, but we aren’t counting those yet. I’m personally hoping that she’ll follow in her brother’s steps, and her first word will be Stark.”
"I think that perhaps, young Master Peter would prefer sleeping with you tonight, Sir," Jarvis said, sensing his creator's hesitation.
How was he supposed to do this? How was he supposed to raise Peter on his own? Oh sure, Coulson would be there, and I'm sure Mary's parents would insist on being there as well, but, it wasn't the same. He could have all the help in the world, but they weren't Daddy, they weren't Mama. Tony would have to be in charge of everything. Mary was so much better at knowing what needed to be done, on how to take care of Peter, and herself, and work, and just, everything. Tony could barely take care of himself sometimes; e.g. palladium poisoning.
Steve laughed and let the boy lead him across the floor, over to the elevator. "Peter, what's going on? Where are we going?"
Tony pointed at her. “You didn’t something else, something that I’m not really going to like, am I?”
"I'm starting to think they do this on purpose," Steve said, slinging his shield on his back as the jet took off for their destination.
Steve kissed his cheek. “Anything for you.” He watched Tony stand up, walk over to the classy wood door and follow the woman who had opened the door and walked inside.
"That's the guy my dad never shut up about?" Tony actually admired that man as a child? If that was the man that Howard had wanted him to be, then he's glad he had a shitty childhood. "Maybe they should have kept him on ice.
Tony chugged down the rest of his glass, the green liquid making his taste buds revolt, as Dum-E rolled over with a fresh glass. He was helping Jarvis try to come up with elemental combinations now that they were done with the single elements, for the arc reactor. He was also getting ready to start working on his new pet project, Stark Tower. The plans were done, and the supplies were being delivered to the site, and the next day, Iron Man would show up to start construction. Tony was going to be involved in the Tower, since he couldn't get over to see Peter yet. Maybe this would get the press off of his back, again.
“Again.” Tony nodded a little. “I’m sure he knows that, but I’m sure it might make a little bit of a difference now that he knows we’re both messed up in the head.” Steve wriggled his nose in a little frown. “I can Feel you frowning. You know I don’t actually mean it, right?” Tony turned around so that he was facing Steve, making sure Steve’s arm was still draped over him. Leaning forward, Tony kissed Steve’s nose. “You are my boyscout, and I love you.” That always made Steve smile, which in turn made Tony smiled. He flicked Steve’s nose this time. “You sap.”
"Every Saturday Mama makes pancakes," Peter smiled, reaching for the syrup bottle with both hands. "But on reallllllly special days, she makes blueberry! I like blueberries."
"I'm happy that you two are dating," Peter said as he started to kick his feet back and forth. The other two couples in the room moved to take their own seats, watching with interest how Tony and Steve were going to handle the curious boy.
“What about when Mom dies?” Steve’s brain stuttered to a halt for a second. “I’ve known she was sick a lot longer than anyone else, and I know that cancer is bad.” Despite his no-nonsense voice, Wade was tucking himself against Steve’s side, under his arm. “I know she’s really sick, and that she can’t work anymore because of it.” Wade pursed his a lips a little, taking a few breaths. “I know she doesn’t have a lot of time left.” He stumbled a little over his words and Steve turned to pull him into a hug. “What’s gonna happen to me?” Wade asked in a whisper.
"The action wouldn't go unnoticed, or unappreciated, Sir," Jarvis spoke up and Tony rolled his eyes fondly.
“I see nothing wrong with the way I’m living my life right now, so I don’t care what anyone else has to say about it,” Steve said, conviction strong in his voice. “Only thing I care about is keeping my family safe. I lost a lot when I woke up from the ice, but I found more than I thought would be possible. I’m not losing anything else, not if I can put a stop to it.”
Tony narrowed his eyes a little at the man. Did Mary put him up to this? "I'm working," he said shortly, but Steve didn't stop smiling.
“Something of immense power. Stark is under the power of the Mind stone, as Loki was at one point as well.” Strange looked back towards Tony, then gently waved a hand over his face before waving Steve over. The blonde moved right away, and then Tony was being gently lowered down into his arms. “There’s nothing that I can do today, and it would be better to take him back where he’ll be comfortable.”
"That's Vega," Peter told her. Mary point to another one. "That's Altair. Polaris is over there," he said as he moved his arm. The night sky had been projected in Peter's room.
"You should tell your Dad about Star Wars," Steve said to Peter when the boy took a breath to actually eat.
He went to turn on his side and a sharp pain in his shoulder had him crying out. Hands were suddenly there to shift him back onto his bed, and Tony opened his eyes. Steve and Bruce were there, Steve looking worried, both looking, sad? Tony sucked in a breath as everything that happened outside suddenly rushed back to his memories.
"Yeah, I get it." Steve leaned in towards Tony a little as well, leaning his cheek on top of Tony's. "I'm tired, Tony."
Tony let the man go, taking several steps back, looking at him. If he was anyone else, he'd say that he was looking at Captain America, in the flesh. But this was Tony Stark, and he knew that Captain America had been lost in the War. But that was the vibranium shield that his father had made, there was no question about that, Jarvis' sensors had already analyzed it. The cowl on the man hid any identifying features and Tony was getting mad. Who would dare try to imitate the hero or World War II?
"Because I promised," Tony repeated, whispering in Peter's hair. Jarvis responded for in the affirmative. Coulson would be there in ten minutes to take Peter to the Hellicarrier, while Iron Man would make a straight shot for Germany.
"I'm proud that you're learning about my aversion to actual medical professionals," Tony teased. "Help me up, Cap. Then I wanna hear how your mission went."
"You've been asleep, Captain," Mary started. "You've been asleep for nearly sixty-five years." Steve kept her gaze before looking up, out the windows of the lobby, now really taking in the differences of what he saw. She put out her hand, palm up, a gentle gesture, and he took her hand, letting her lead him to the doors. They stepped out and Steve blinked a bit at the sunlight, but at all the technology around him. "You gonna be okay?" Mary asked after a few minutes.
Tony phone dinged and he grabbed it, seeing a response from Rhodey. 'Don't forget what you said on the plane.' Tony let his lips turn up just a little in a smile.
“Can we stop saying that word now?” She zipped up the suitcase and Tony pushed over Peter’s backpack to her. “You’re statement for the press was very nice by the way.” Tony wiggled his nose a little.
"I'm going to have to talk to Steve about this, about you," he said quietly. "And I'm not going to like it, so that means he's not going to like it. I hate having serious conversations, specially ones that involved feelings." Her blues eyes looked back to his brown ones. "You didn't know that yet, so, I won't hold it against you. Not like you asked to be, well, here," he finished lamely. "But listen up," he levered himself up a bit with his elbows, making sure that she didn't slide or roll off of him. "That guy in there, he's taken on this big mantle, one even bigger than Captain America. He's become Dad, or you know, whatever you end up calling him as you learn to talk. I still think he's just a baby himself, but I'm old."
But, Steve Rogers had been frozen in the ice long before Tony had been born. He had no clue what Howard would turn in to, how obsessed, and reckless, he would get. And so far, this man had done nothing more than try to support him once he found out. This wasn't the Captain America, the Steve Rogers that Howard had told him about. This was a far better man, one that Tony was starting to believe really cared about him.
Tony's arm tightened around Peter a little more, and he dropped a kiss on his forehead. "Yeah, I'm still here, Petey." Pete snuggled against Tony's chest, hand tapping the arc reactor a couple times.
"There are more important things in life than stubbornly staying put," Rachel said to him. "And it doesn't hurt that you're footing the bill." Tony let out a little laugh, smiling.
"You can go see her first." Steve frowned at Tony's words. "I have to,..." Tony paused, taking a breath. "I have to call her parents." He wasn't looking forward to the phone call. Steve's eyes softened a little. "I need to get a jet to them, and get them here as soon as possible. If they're even able to get in the air right now. Driving will be too long, but I don't know if all flights are grounded or not-"
"Andes mints, kicking babies, and video games." She nodded. "Did Steve mention that I have a nephew? Because I have a nephew, and my brother-in-law tells me how to tame the wild four-year-old. So I have a little bit of an advantage here."
"Oh, yeah, well," Steve shrugged a little, biting his lip as if she could see the smile on his face. "I had to ask her advice! And she seemed like a great source of knowledge, first hand and all, and she knows who you are."
“Well, yes, but I wasn’t able to hear a lot of live music in my day. It’s certainly something special.” Tony hummed happily and nodded as they walked into Jamie’s room. They could see her already awake, standing in the crib, holding onto the rail. “Look who’s awake and waiting.” Jamie cooed at the attention, reaching her arms up, and Steve obediently reached down to pull her into his arms.
This chapter is full of feels, mostly Tony feels. I'm still trying to apologize to the Tony that's in my head. But, I tried to make up for it at the end? Fun with music though!
“Yeah, dating Linda.” Bucky shook his head a little. “Just cause I dated a girl for more than a week, didn’t mean I was gonna marry her. Not the point,” he said waving his arm, heading for the door. “Point is, you tried to curse me with moody children. I’m just returning the favor. And it’s going to work out because I’m the fun Uncle.” He cackled as he left, walking down the hall towards the elevator.
"Who gets fed cherries." Tony nodded and she smiled. "Now, I've checked with my Doctor, if I don't eat like, three hundred of them in a week, it's not unhealthy to the babes. So, maybe you should do a round while pregnant, and a round not-pregnant."
Steve looked around the mansion as he brought the bags in. It was different than the Tower, and he had briefly seen it earlier in the year, but now he’d have a little more time to enjoy it. Or maybe not, with his plans.
"Stane!!" Mary and Stane looked over, something shooting through the sky towards him. That was Tony's voice! Tony slammed into Stane, driving them through the ground, and out of sight. She took a trembling breath and went over to Pepper, freeing one hand to check on her pulse, while never once letting go of Peter.
“Wait,” Meg called out while looking at the text on Tony’s phone. The Soldier stopped, and Meg frowned at Tony as well. “If you want this, you’ll probably have to use my proper first name,” she muttered. “Report any known information on Margrit Rosenfeld.” Tony and Steve both raised their eyebrows. “It’s German.”
“Considering that it’s the middle of the afternoon, and it’s a holiday, I’m not actually expecting a lot of places to be open,” Steve told him.
"That's your first thought? That I'm carrying patriotic babies?" Meg said, watching them. Tony looked back at her. "I'm having twins, hence the plural. I was his wingman while he was still pining after you."
Tony just sighed a little and ran his hand through his hair. "Just tired, is all. It really was a perfect day, for them. They deserve it, specially after this summer." He glanced over at the dance floor, someone starting to sweep the floor. "Everyone had fun." Pepper leaned over, rubbing the back of his neck a little with her fingers. When Tony closed his eyes, he saw a laughing blonde trying to dance, sparkling blue eyes. Everyone had fun. Tony opened his eyes again. "Now it's time to plan Peter's birthday party. Never a dull moment in my life."
Gunshots and explosions were above him, so he knew that he was underground, but now he ran into the problem of getting out without some of the soldiers doing a double-take. "Why does this place have to be made out of concrete in all the wrong places?" He muttered. There was a tug on his shirt and he looked down to see blue eyes staring up at him. "These are not the type of people we want seeing your good looks, sweetheart. Help me find a way out, yeah?" He ducked down underneath a desk when he heard boots running towards them. Six soldiers ran by, carrying several large containers that Tony didn't have enough time to look through.
"If you are true in your convictions, then we must call down one of the Arbiters." Tony raised both eyebrows again, directed at Thor as he spoke. Looking back over at Loki he was looking very pleased with himself and Tony bristled.
They did battle a little longer as they ate the malt, and Steve practically fought him to pay the bill. It wasn’t until Steve reminded him that he had his own bank account, and that he was pretty sure that Peter and Jamie weren’t going to use all that money for college.
“We’ll figure this out when Dr Strange comes back over sometime.” Steve leaned his head on top of Tony’s, hand rubbing his arm up and down. “He said that he put up a shield, something that’s clocking you from being found, so we should have a little time.”
"Ah, no, I don't have too, I mean," Tony started to ramble, taking a step back. "You probably knew him better, I mean, he had your cards. I'm just the one that brings the doctors and makes sure that everyone gets better, saving the world and all that-"
"Daddy?" Peter said in a quiet voice. "Not feel goob." He coughed again, but kept coughing for several seconds after.
"Daddy!" Peter pulled on Tony's arm, gasping, pointing up. "Daddy! It's Captain America!" Tony smiled, picking up Peter and putting him up on his shoulders. "Captain America is there!" Tony laughed and nodded, Peter leaning forward on his head now, just trying to get closer to the banners.
"I've got to get dressed, enter the circus again." Standing up from the bed, Tony looked at her, his face open, honest and vulnerable for just a second. Then he raised his mask, the practiced easy smile on his lips. "Wish me luck, Mare." He left the room, nodding to William who was leaning against the opposite wall.
"You are so far from good I could almost laugh," Tony said, still looking down at his phone, thumb scrolling. "I would laugh, but I'm too busy cringing. Seriously, this work, it deserves a proper space."
“We’re going to Disneyland!” He cheered when Mary took his hands and pulled him away from Tony, lifting him off the ground for a few seconds. “Mr Steve said that we could go to Disneyland, and Daddy said that it would be okay to go for his birthday!” Peter was grinning like he won the lottery.
Steve let out a breath and leaned his forehead on top of Tony's head. "I think Coulson stealing your bullet is the least of your worries right now."
"You were gone so long," Peter cried quietly, voice a little muffled into his neck. "You didn't come back."
"You're technically still healing," Tony finished for her. "Let me get him to Agent then, and I'll come back to help you get comfortable."
Steve started his motorcycle and pulled into the street, passing the family, a little smile on his face.
"He was a three date mistake." Tony frowned as they watched the interview. He should warn Pepper, this was going to cause even more problems. Anyone that cared about Tony in anyway knew that he was bisexual, and Tony didn't care, but as far as the press knew, he was as straight as the American Hero standing next to him. There had always been rumors, but why wouldn't there be when the press loved reporting on his drinking and partying, and general debauchery. "Dammit."
"But, I hope that in the end, I'll have given you a way to seek the comfort you need to get through it." Tony frowned a little. "I want you to talk to me about the Battle, Tony." Tony froze in her arms, body tensing up, breathing stuttering. "I know you haven't talked to anyone about it, like I told you too."
"Unless something happened in the past hour-" Steve started, and when Jarvis interrupted him Tony threw Steve an honest glare this time.
Steve heard Rhodey’s sigh, like this was probably the tenth time they’ve talked about this. “Sorry, Cap, but my superior’s won’t let me leave early. I’ll be there for training, though.”
“I think I suddenly understand why you had me watch the Star Wars movies,” Steve told him, looking at the tan outfit on the bed.
"Hmmmm, did I?" Mary crossed one arm over her chest, tapping her chin with her other hand. "You know what, on second thought, I don't think I need it anymore."
"Yeah! I made those ones, Uncle Bruce helped with the stove though." Peter let Tony sit, sitting in his lap.
"Thanks, I think I'm good for tonight, though." Steve took a drink form the mug and made a soft moan that Tony thought was not family friendly, after-hours only. "This is better than I remember it."
Tony thought he was going to go insane. He actually might. Three days of being trapped inside of his mind, thanks to Strucker's Enhanced. He was aware of everything, saw and heard everything, and sometimes he could break through enough to say what he wanted, instead of just nodding, or shaking his head.
"I'll come with you," Coulson said, standing up from his seat to come up on the other side of Peter. Tony was able to take the hint that it was his turn to go and see Mary and Rachel, without little ears listening. "Room Four." Tony nodded and left the room, heading the opposite direction as the other three men.
There was a silence, after a couple of moments, and Thor was speaking softly with the Arbiter. When Tony was sure she was gone, he pushed himself up, confident his legs would hold him up, and walked over to Loki's little prison.
Pocketing the keys to the car he locked the doors as he got out and walked over to the apartment building that Mary lived in. She said that the door was broken so it didn’t lock properly, and if you just turned it to the left a little it would pop right open. She wasn’t wrong. Tony was already thinking about how he could fix that problem.
Tony turned the corner and saw three men lift their rifles at him. He froze, both hands around the bundle in his arms. They walked towards him, obviously high enough up in the ranks to recognize that he shouldn't be killed on sight. Something flew between them, bounced off the stone wall, slammed into the helmet of one man, and back from the direction it came. Tony had never been so happy to see the blur of Captain America's shield. He was not thrilled when he saw a man in black jump down from the roof, land on top of one of the other soldiers, then turn and catch the last in the gut, throwing him from the building, with a metal arm.
Tony mildly enjoyed the little bit of attention he got when he pulled up to his own event, mainly because he liked proving people wrong about him. He gave a brief greeting to Obie, and moved on, mostly so he wouldn't have to actually talk to any reporters. He could play up the bad boy role for a little longer. The people he cared about knew what he was really like now.
"Let's wait and see. Feels like I'm not really in any position to actually step in on this one." Steve didn't feel the need to voice the other part of that thought. 'Since it's my fault this happened.'
Tony barely had time to turn, the repulsors already working to correct his position, but not enough to stop himself from getting slammed into. He was crushed briefly against the glass before his HUD went dark, parts of the suit falling off, and he was falling down. Tony gasped, feeling like electricity was shooting through his body, lighting up all his nerves, red hazing his vision slightly. He was sure he saw a shadow above him, something extending, but then there was a ripple in the air and something else shuddered through his body.
When Tony was opening his eyes, it was too the feeling feel of Steve's fingers carding through his hair, gently rubbing his scalp, soft, hot lips trailing lazy kisses along his shoulder and neck, and both of them trying to catch their breath. He turned his head little to look at Steve, saw the absolutely luminous smile on his face, and sparkling eyes. Tony reached out his hand, gently caressing Steve's face, watching those eyes closed as he pressed against Tony's hand.
The beeping from the computer pulled everyone from the moment. "Got it," Tony breathed out. That was the tesseract.
"Hey, Cap," Tony called out quietly, even though Peter wasn't falling asleep again anytime soon. "Why don't you find another blanket, settle in for a movie or two."
"I carry around mace, too." Tony stared at her for a second before letting out a snort of laughter, a little bit on the side of manic.
“And so you decided to take her as your own?” Steve accused, temper flaring. Tony knew that he was upset because SHIELD had been stupid enough to not tell him. Tony was going to putting a new virus into Fury’s computer after this.
"I think we can wrangle up the Avengers, maybe in costume," Steve said with a smile. Tony looked at him, then back to Mary, tilting his head a little.
"Caught two Hydra Agents," Clint said, arrow dangerously aimed at Bucky's head. There was already an arrow in the wall a couple feet away from Bucky and Meg. "Didn't even look like they were trying to hide." Steve's jaw dropped a little.
"Because you'll know what to look for right away, and we'll be working together?" Tony put on a little smile. "It'll be a Science Bros reunion, you and me."
Except there was suddenly a grip around his wrist. Tony looked up to the other Maximoff twin, Pietro, standing there. "I don't think you're allowed to go anywhere."
Tony eased the knot of his tie up, paused to take a look in the mirror before pulling it off. “Are you going to go out shopping for me?” The engineer turned his head slightly to see Peter kicking his legs, sitting on the edge of the bed.
“I’m here now, mission’s done so I’m staying put.” Steve kissed the shell of his ear, his other arm moving so his fingers could rest in Tony’s hair. “I didn’t know that kids were the new fashion accessory though.” Tony snorted softly and Steve smiled.
"Your Daddy flew us in last night," William told him as Rachel rubbed Peter's back. "We got here just after you woke up this morning."
Tony put his hands up, the reporters going quiet a little, then he gestured to another woman towards the middle. "Mrs Tate, right?" She nodded. "Indulge me, do you have kids?"
Tony snorted and shook his head. “Two reason why that didn’t happen. That would have been a bigger story than me playing with a light saber. And, I’m getting used to this whole commitment thing as is, like, just being someone’s boyfriend, and raising kids at the same time. That’s huge, so, marriage feels like a whole ‘nother big step that doesn’t fall in step with Tony Stark. Not yet, anyway.” Tony opened his eyes when something hit his nose, and he saw Jamie smiling, holding onto one of her shoes. “You are a foot ninja! She’s obsessed with feet,” he added looking over at Pepper. “She’s going to be walking any day now, I swear, just because she’ll want to know everything her feet can do.”
"Very much so, and I blame his dad for that," Mary said with a chuckle. "He'll never let you have a moment to himself, and then he won't be able to stop from telling everyone. I think right now, no one needs to know that your back, because you need time for yourself. And then you can make the choice later on."
The thrilling conclusion to the Avengers movie! But not to the story. I'm trying to add more needed fluff moments, but I promise that there will be some in the next chapter, as I've already written some of it. I hope that some of your questions get cleared up in the chapter about what happened last time, if not, go ahead and ask, I'll answer if I can! I have vague plans for what's going to happen in future chapters, and that's all I need before the others start guiding me.
"I don't think I should have too, unless you're gone for work," she said, splitting her orange in half, and starting to eat one half without pulling the slices. "I know for a fact that I'm not the only one on house arrest now." Tony wrinkled his nose a little. "I also know that you sir, are holding a grudge against my friend."
“Sorry. Can’t protect you anymore.” Tony frowned a little at the words, how they sounded softer, and maybe a little further away. The space around him rippled, then cracked. He frowned, watching the golden light waver slightly, not knowing what was happening. With an unnatural tearing sound, the purples and blues, the stars, all disappeared. The pitch black of space momentarily shocked Tony, not expecting it that quickly, then his entire body tensed up. Pain like he had never felt before streaked through all of his nerves, paralyzing his body. He wanted to scream out but couldn’t, wanted to pass out, but something was keeping him awake.
"It's really grinding on your nerves that you can't run outside, yet, isn't it?" Steve moaned and dropped his head back onto a pillow, causing Tony to chuckle.
What had he been thinking? How was it that Mary was able to break him apart like that? He hadn't wanted her to know any of that, he hadn't wanted to say any of that to anyone. The warm sting of tears were prickling at the corners of his eyes, his traitorous emotions only getting worse instead of going away. He was Tony Stark! Stark men were made of
"How many times did they ask you those questions?" Steve asked her. He had been going to ask a couple of those questions.
“Yeah, the training that I had to talk him out of starting until after his birthday,” Tony grumped out. “The last days of a man’s year should not be spent getting sweaty in the gym. There’s only one acceptable way of getting sweaty-“
Steve put the rake against the closest tree and went over to help Mary, taking a load of bags from her hands. Mary gave him a smile then wrapped his arms around Peter's middle and pulled him out of the trunk, a box of fruit snacks in his hands. "Looking good, Pete," Steve said when he saw the little boy with the smug look, his treasure in his hands. He had a new haircut, the shaggy curls gone, and now sporting a shorter, spikier look.
