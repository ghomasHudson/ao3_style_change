Dean glared at him, but he didn’t say anything.
At some point in the struggle the angels had managed to bring Cas down, though there were quite a lot of dead mooks in the dust, feathers charred into the warehouse’s cinder blocks and concrete. Two of them were pinning his arms, another one was holding him by the chest, keeping him on his knees, a fourth had his blade at Cas’s throat. Cas didn’t seem to notice, his eyes were on Dean and Michael.
“Hannah, I said I needed some time to help my friends, we-”
“I disposed of it. It contained an unacceptable amount of methanol. From the dust on it, you and Sam didn’t use it, but I didn’t want to take any chances.”
“I’m sorry I keep saying those things to you!” Ben wailed into Castiel’s surcoat. “I don’t know why I do it! I always do it and I don’t know why!”
With one massive wingbeat, Dean hurtled at the first angel in line and skewered him quick before the holy brigade could adjust to the level of demon they were facing. The celestial jerked like a fish on a line before a holy white light ripped him apart. Dean tore out the blade, leapt at the angels converging on him - and then vaulted over their heads, heading towards the second group between him and Michael.
“This is going to work whatever you and I do, it’s all in the paperwork, not-... What I’m saying, Cas - do you mind if I call you Cas? Less of a mouthful.”
“He’ll get over it eventually,” he finally said.
The man draws himself up and starts talking in a rehearsed way that suggests he’s said these words many times before. “I’m sorry to say, sir, that due to a failure in our camera system, a great many cars on this level were broken into or stolen in an incident a week ago. If you don’t mind, sir, I will go with you to see if your vehicle is still there, and in what state. Please note that Air Park Ltd is not responsible for items left inside the vehicle, however due to the nature of the incident, if your car has been stolen or damaged-”
“Tomorrow, Cole, tomorrow. Bring some bandaids,” Dean suggests. “Benny, my man, I’m gonna be giving you even more work.”
was the one getting dumped into unconsciousness, so he’d know, right?!
“Do these jokers have my gun?” was all he said in lieu of greeting.
“Wait, wait, what?”
What exactly might had been in the cards, Castiel isn’t entirely sure; the whole “You had me at Hello”-kissing-intimacy bundle, probably. That had been a potential outcome, though Castiel hadn’t thought of it until Dean mentioned it. It's good to know what is or isn't possible. Now he's going back to the library to look for ways to get rid of the Mark and keep the man he loves from disappearing forever, beyond hope of recovery.
“They did not go in deep. I’m hoping you can tell the difference between a bullet and my vessel’s vital organs,” said Cas stroppily without ever changing his tone all that much. People who said he was expressionless just weren’t paying attention.
Dean had almost leapt on him and had him by the shoulders. “Don’t say that! I can’t- I can’t lose him, Sam. I can’t. I just can’t.”
The bottle’s not here. It’s empty and in the garbage.
“Wow, what a mess!” Chuck finally concluded with one last look around before facing them. The Garden was pristine once again, Castiel knew that Chuck was looking a lot further than the Dome.
Castiel is unable to look away as something shifts and settles in his chest, a profound bond newly forged, a sense of belonging stronger than he’s ever known since it’s not a function of his creation or a duty he’s been born and bound to; it’s offered, it’s promised, it’s earned. It will be his own.
“He said he would destroy me,” Castiel corrected absently. Then he cocked his head in a sudden thought. “That somehow sounds more impressive, why is that?”
“What do you mean?”
“Oh? You sure? Hey, by chance you wouldn’t be one of them magic users? Because we can always use more of-’
Hannah glares down at her feet. “I stood up for you, I tried to explain- the problem is the Winchesters.”
“Hey, hon, what’s- oof!”
Castiel considered that the same way he usually did, as if Dean was speaking a foreign language he had to translate in his head before he responded. Then he slipped off his coat and laid it flat on the ground.
Castiel looks around the kitchen. Flour, knocked over and blanketing the floor, hosts a multitude of pawprints. The spills of organic gluten-free tomato juice add an exciting counterpoint to the white canvas, so do the calabrese olives dotting the tableaux. If Gabriel were here, he’d be chiselling up Castiel’s kitchen linoleum for an exhibit in his gallery. The olives’ dish is in shards, a danger to foot and paw, the oven is still open and pumping hot air into the warmth of the kitchen, the oven mitts, used as missiles in the first attack, are on the couch and in the water jug on the sideboard respectively, the flourless cake Castiel baked is upside down on the floor like an upturned UFO, and the garbage can is knocked over, its contents strewn across the kitchen.
“Cas… Cas wouldn’t-... “
“You said your father made it on a whim.”
The truth comes at him like a meteor. Like the sun going nova. Like a personal apocalypse.
“Panic! Pudding! Pull yourselves together! Got angel cuffs?!”
“Yeah, I got a pretty good idea why.”
It’s all just supposition at this juncture, but if it’s true… that is so dangerous. The demons will not stop searching. It’s already amazing that those demonic idiots have apparently lost their brand new antichrist
But not to Cas... “All these wonders,” he whispers, looking around them with eyes that see something other than Dean’s, even as he lifts the lid off the first box by touch alone. “All this knowledge, this… this grace. Broken by the malignance of a handful of fanatics for their own purposes.”
“...you really don’t feel anything?”
“Good,” said Cas with perhaps a faint hint of irony as he brushed soot off his trenchcoat. “Now let us see if we can leave.”
Cas’s tone has dropped all enthusiasm, all joy. He’s staring at his brother like a stranger.
“There’s ways to deal with that,” Jo said in a dead serious tone that had Dean open his mouth for a quick put-down.
Cas unfreezes and looks back quickly at the sled where Vic is strapped. “I- I-... I’m sorry, Dean, yes, we need to go.”
“Dada.” Robbie is installed in his arms on the couch. The game semi-finals are playing in the background, but neither are paying attention.
“I nearly missed it. I wasn’t paying enough
“Dean, call me Dean.”
“Right!” Cas’s look is brighter than the sun. “I have no idea why you’re constantly downplaying your intelligence, Dean, your understanding is excellent. I’d say you’re actually doing better than all but one of my brothers,” he adds a bit ironically.
A log cracks with a report like a gunshot, making Dean jump and shake himself. This is why a guy shouldn't indulge in introspection; tangle himself into knots till he’s overall useless.
Castiel only has the time to spin around and grab Dean by the shoulders, protect the king with his very body if he must - he catches a sight of green eyes widening in sudden surprise, barely visible in the shadows as something flies overhead, blocking out the sun.
He should have known something like this would happen one day. How hadn’t he known?! Especially when Heaven issued all those fucking kill orders and Cas started raking up haloes like it was going out of style. If they were that hacked off about angels and nephilim on Earth, a cambion can’t expect mercy, or even stay hidden forever. He should have seen this coming.
Panic yelped like a chihuahua as Dean picked him up by the front of his dirty camo jacket and bore him through the dusty warehouse to slam him against the nearest wall, First Blade pressed up against the stinky sweatpants below the beltline. Explanations were boring. Dean was going to maim his would-be purloiners now, explanations would crop up in due course.
Cas is sitting back there with this air about him, same look he’s always got these days: serious, mindful, deeply contented. Like a dog, Dean told him - because he can still be a jerk at times, when emotions run too high. But that’s what that look makes him think of: one of those huge faithful fluffy pooches who's accepted that this new squirming squalling thing the masters brought home from the hospital is part of the family, and can’t be more delighted as he patrols around the crib. Cas - who’d been in Dean’s bed at the time, where he rightfully belongs - looked inordinately pleased at the comparison, the goof, instead of royally pissed off.
Sam does some research. His conclusions make him scowl and call his brother.
“Huh? Looked like revolvers. But- but that shouldn’t hurt you, angels are bulletproof. What- shit!” Red stains were spreading down the back of Cas’s coat. “You’re injured! Can’t you heal yourself?!”
A voice Dean did not recognize echoed out from the box. It was a deep gravelly voice, with a nice timbre but less emotion than a cuckoo clock. There was no picture to go with it, Dean saw as he craned his neck to see out the window.
“Oh, that’s right.” Dean makes a show of knocking his head with his knuckles. It’s worth looking like a doofus to see Castiel relax all the way now.
Humanity was still, a few months down the line, in a bit of a mess, scrambling to adjust to its newfound freedom like a baby bird falling out of its nest and into a hurricane. Sam was one of the big heads of the new human order, in charge of most of their continent, and was helming his new responsibilities like a champ, like Dean always knew he could. Dean felt a little guilty at times leaving his brother holding that particular bag of wildcats, but the rest of the brand new human council had made it quite clear months ago. They’d carefully thanked Dean and Castiel for single handedly averting a new and more thorough apocalypse, and then almost in the same breath, added that news of their involvement in removing angels from earth had spread, and so it might be best if they found themselves, say, out in the Wild hunting monsters for the next decade or so, only coming back to see their friends and family very discreetly - maybe in the dead of night, yeah, that'd be okay. Sam had shot to his feet and started shouting and swearing and threatening to resign - but Dean was out the door and off into the Wilds before his brother even truly got started. He and Cas would have buckled down to help fix the mess they’d contributed to if it’d been required of them, but since their presence might do more harm than good, agitating the pro-angel factions remaining amongst the Sheep, Dean had leapt at the chance to get well out of the way. Give him hell-beasts and monsters any day of the week, and Sunday to boot..
“You seriously don’t know?”
Cas was up ahead a bit, glowering out into the darkness as if he expected an assault at any moment.
“Can you please stop shouting?” Chrissy, who’s got a mouth, says off to one side. “Nobody’s actually listening, dude.”
“It will be,” says Cas crisply.
“I know, dear, you have pointed out that fact very loudly at least a dozen times in the past few minutes.” Rowena’s strained manner suggests she’s getting tired of hearing it. “And I tell you that this is irrelevant to the current situation. Magic is very potent. So are demons. And a Knight of Hell… well, they are very powerful indeed and have considerable magic at their disposal. I’d believed them all extinct, to the utmost relief of anyone remotely human, however...” she lets that dangle.
“No idea. But there’s going to be a track to follow. We just have to hurry, because otherwise it’ll be gone. The resistance won’t leave it for the angels to find.”
Castiel’s car is in an area guarded by a flimsy fortress of red cones. There’s only four cars left, three of them with broken windows.
“What is it?” Dean asked.
“The basics of her argument were there, yes, but man, translations are often very dodgy. I just wanted to be sure our version wasn’t missing anything. The bit about the Paradise boundaries, for instance, that’s new, we didn’t have that.”
“Uh, Dean, you’re going to change. I mean physically.” Sam gives Dean’s stomach a significant look. Then he shakes himself. “Why not tell him? He’s not the same angel he was back when we met Jesse, Cas would help us this time around.” He meets Dean’s hard stare, licks his lips. “I...I think.”
“Good good. You see?” Chuck beamed. “This will be so much more interesting. So tell me-”
“For… for putting your life on hold dealing with my problems. And for babysitting and watching out for us and-... everything.”
The creature stares at the prone ruined bodies all around him, gives the fallen Charlie a teary look, and, sobbing, takes unsteady steps straight towards her. The cambion freezes at Dean's shout, and makes a chirping burble of fear. It totters and falls to its hands and knees in the sand, then stands up again. It stares at its progenitor, but Dean’s state - gasping, frantic, face a mask of blood and bruises - makes him unrecognizable and upsetting, and so the creature directs unsteady steps towards the only adult left standing, an instinctive search for protection.
“Okay,” Castiel echoes, head drooping a little. “Be careful.”
“I am saying your facts are inaccurate, those people-“
them,” Cas ground out savagely, glaring right into Dean’s face up close and personal. “After the fight you put up with me last month- Were those your resistance
The badger was no longer there when he arrived, naturally. Prince Ben was too canny for that, he’d had his friend catch and vanish the little beast as soon as their tutor ran off for help. Castiel entered the classroom to be faced with a dozen childish grins of anticipation and a distinct musky odor floating in the air, presumably from the badger.
“I feel more comfortable, let me tell you. I normally don’t wear that outside of work, I tend to relax at home in the evenings in outfits like this, but I…” The Castiel who thought he had to get dressed up to impress Michael seems like another person entirely now, one he hasn’t seen in years, a distant cousin perhaps, probably on his aunt Naomi’s side…
was going to work back then. It was... well, perhaps it wasn’t entirely flawless, but what was the alternative?
Dean sniffed. He lifted his head. “Hey, it smells like-...”
“Who are you? What do you want?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But I didn’t know about Sam.” Benny stopped in his tracks and turned around and faced them square. “I swear, Dean. I only met him a week ago, when they summoned me here. I didn’t know the resistance had designs on him.”
The turnaround from bossy taskmaster to this very omega stance makes Dean’s eyebrows twitch up. “Cas? It’s okay, come meet Charlie. Charlie, this is Castiel Novak.”
- but Crowley was gone!
But a few weeks later, that off-white strip is now part of that
“I just used regulars.”
“Funny. I bet that that’s what one of the makers of GF32 once said to some plebe or other, back in the good ol’ days before they let loose their virus.”
“Wow, Cas, nice peach fuzz.” Garth’s voice is both bemused and sunny. “When did that happen?”
Dean stares up, the being stares down, the fast-moving world around them forgotten for a moment as something odd happens, a link, subtler than the grip of a hand on Dean’s shoulder yet just as real. The angel looks… intrigued…
“Is that-”
But since he’d been ordered to do his job... Balthazar left, hoping Sam wasn’t going to get too damaged in the next couple of hours.
Dean finds himself caught by the wrist, maneuvered out of his chair and pulled away from the table. The door to the trendy bar closes with a clack behind him before he manages to catch his sagging jaw and slot it back into place.
If he…
That does it!
“I have to do something.”
There’s a faint shift in the loose circle, a few people from Benny’s team and Tyler’s look askance - not rebellious, just looking for answers, looking to Dean.
- now that he thought of it, when he’d offered to clean Dean with a quick application of Grace, first off, he’d forgotten somehow that this was never welcome, and also, the way Dean had declined had shown no repulsion at the notion.
try to bring this stuff up, what do I get? Just your best John Winchester impersonation and nothing more! What the hell, Dean? Why can’t you and I talk about this shit too? With me you always go on about how much you lack smarts, but with Castiel, you obviously-”
“You had night duty?” Dean guesses.
an album, and not two old photos bumping around a wallet for decades. They’ll also have a decent Christmas soon, and presents, and they have bumblebee suits, and meals in the fridge - even if they are all of the frozen store-bought variety, ‘cause neither redhead in their family cooks and Dean doesn’t always have the time. Oh, and they have the best internet connection in all of Nebraska, of course.
A garbled sound of fury tried to echo around the passageway and was murdered by the lined walls. Castiel spun around and ran to the far end of the room where a hole led down to a lower level and, presumably, another hidden door. Eileen didn’t try to stop him, not that he’d have let her.
Dean has to hunt around for a good half hour before he locates his brother.
Colt blinked back the world around him. His crude cabin, his hunting equipment dangling from walls and ceiling, the remains of something congealed rotting in a plate nearby, among a mess of metal filings, tools, droplets of molten lead that had scorched the wood of the table and-
Castiel moves his injured wrist away, still pleading, still trying. “Dean, please believe me, she attacked me, I told you, she’s a liar-”
“And you’re Ranchers, yes, our sections are right there on our sleeves,” says Cas a little shortly, jabbing a chin at the wheat stalk symbol neatly embroidered on Adele’s uniform. “Look, we have a busy day ahead of us and I’d like to get started as quickly as possible. There’s nothing to be worried about. We’re so close to the pack, they’ll hear us if you stub your toe. So can you please show this beta that you’re not fragile flowers, and walk a little faster?”
We could look for it tomorrow, Castiel could have suggested, but he didn’t. Nine days they’d been on their bizarre scavenger hunt through the Wilds. Like Dean, Castiel wanted to find Sam sooner rather than later. He strode around, checking the boles of trees and under any rock that looked piled artificially against another.
“No,” said Dean on principle before looking at his spouse’s profile. “Cas, did anything he say make sense? Sounded like moonshine madness to me.”
“Yes.”
Ellen wasn’t this abrupt with other nobles, a chagrined Castiel had noticed. But she’d been the housekeeper through decades of war, she’d raised Ben after Queen Lisa’s passing, she’d cared for princes Dean and Samuel as well… and he was nothing but an interloper, a queer man who’d married her precious king and ensured she’d never have any more royal babies to fuss over. Her impatience with him was justified in his mind. And at least she did what he asked. The highest tier of servants back in Eden, though polite enough to his face, had curried favor with Naomi by subtly disobeying him and showing him up. Held up to that standard, Ellen’s sharpness was tolerable. He was not going to upbraid her for it, he was not so petty. Also, she scared him quite a lot; the way she raised her eyebrows like
“Dude, I know what that is. I should damn well know. But what, that was forbidden?”
Michael’s full attention shifted to Cas. “Is that why you came here? Did you think you could assassinate me, you and this… foul creature?”
After all those months, it is heaven.
But that was tomorrow. Tonight... tonight he was alone in a room with his husband, on a bed that they would undoubtedly share if he didn’t want Cas to stand around like a scarecrow. Cas was... he was right there, his weight dipping the mattress, the soft sound of his breathing, the warmth of his body nearby... Dean cleared his throat.
“Made sure the name of his soul matches the name you just made up - sorry, the name you gave me in perfect good faith, I’m sure. That way, if anybody comes a-lookin’, they’ll just see a Henry Winchester who’s going to have a good sleep right now,” Henry yawned on cue, “and forget what he’s seen this last week.”
Castiel let all this happen until dinnertime, at which point he resumed his duties before the castle and the country could fall apart, but with a spring in his step he would not soon forget, nor would his family let him.
Halfway across the room, in a chair in which she apparently collapsed, a white-faced Rowena makes a disgusted sound.
That was the way of their new world. If humans were the sheep and God was the shepherd, then the angels were the trusty ol’ sheepdogs, obeying every order eagerly and without question. Dean could not imagine living like that, but then again, he imagined many an angel could not conceive of living like a human either, always questioning and doubting and poking.
“Ledgers fighting back? Don’t know how you spend all your time working on that shit. I’m serious, Cas, you really don’t have to wear that if you don’t-”
He stared down at the ball in his hand and then up at the human- at Dean. The diameter of the latter’s toothy smile would give a Leviathan a run for its money right now. Castiel hesitated, but if this truly made the human happy... The parameters of his mission were hardly well defined, but keeping the partner of his union content was certainly a basic minimum.
“Yes.”
Dean stopped abruptly and appraised him, his mien of grumpy embarrassment breaking a little under a crooked smile. “I don’t quite know what happened last night or what’s come over you, but I think I kind of like it. You’re always very contained, I see you swallowing your anger way too much… bit like my mom that way, always calm and cheerful, but just occasionally she’d let loose at dad and let me tell you, it kept him honest…”
Castiel’s lips twitch and his eyes dart up-then-down. They are a clear blue. “You mentioned that.”
Dean takes the book and says thank you. The cover is so stained it will take him a minute to read the title, though he can make out an illustration, a very weird-... it’s not a person, it’s a critter, possibly a badly drawn bear. He flips through it without reading it yet. It’s full of drawings, the paper in much better condition than the cover. It’s a children’s book, but he doesn’t think Cas is making a point about Dean’s reading level here, because the boy in the book is dressed in a wolf costume and strutting around in a way that makes a small smile bloom on Dean’s face. The kid, who looks like a real brat, has adventures - with monsters and stuff? Awesome. And in the last page he takes off his wolf costume and comes home…
“...Dean-”
In which it’s clear that Dean’s life is looking up at last!
Sam sighs. There’s a whole conversation about tangled family relations in that one windy exhale. Dean ignores it and glares at his horse’s ears.
It’s a miserable slog. Even Jo, Chrissy and Egan start to droop at the end of it. It’s not just the cold autumn weather, or the rain, or the mud, or the fast march on the tracks of a bunch of demons… it’s that the demons consistently fail to be there, contrary creatures. For days they are chasing ghosts. Each time Castiel’s squad gets ready to fall on a splinter of the horde, their targets seem to fade away into smoke, sometimes literally.
“Where’s he going?” Dean grumbled under his breath - still perfectly audible to celestial senses at this distance. “I swear, that bird is just plain weird. Says he’s never been in a Paradise garrison and I believe him. He’s like Zuriel concentrated, though a bit less sour. Look, he’s promised to keep you safe - real promise, not Word-shit promise-”
“That seems a paltry substitute,” Cas said softly, gazing down at his hands folded on his lap. He almost sounded sad.
“In this camp, we accept our place, but we are not slaves or animals. We are your workforce. As long as we are on target for our assigned duties, we still have agency over our time,” Cas says softly, still in that weird state, and oh dear… Dean inches closer because there’s that little tone in the omega’s voice now, like when he was telling Dean about the turbines the other day. But Dean, he was curious and he wanted to know more, he loved that tone. Lydia, in the meantime, is putting together the fact that she’s getting
“Yeah, sorry, I ain’t got no sister. Only two brothers, and neither of them are into dudes. Or birds.”
From her change of clothes and her reposed air, it was obvious Eileen had spent the night comfortably in her bed, so at least there would be no sordid rumors that he had absconded with her, thank the lord for small mercies. She must have broken her fast and then come back up the tower a short while ago, well prepared. Her candelabra stood ready with new candles, flint and iron at hand, and she unwrapped from a kerchief a trencher of bread, some cheese and a jug of watered down wine. Castiel sniffed the latter suspiciously, and got a light smack on the head for his efforts, followed by an imperious, sisterly gesture to stop being a doddypoll and get his strength back. Left with little choice, Castiel sipped gingerly at the fluid. When nothing untoward happened, he quickly drank the whole jug down, chasing away the horrible tang on his tongue. He was still working at the bread and cheese when Eileen shooed him towards the egress.
Cas rolls his eyes, uncrosses his arms and pointedly says goodnight to Dean without any particular hurry.
. You get me?”
“Paradise,” he said ruminatively. “We called it the Promised Land.”
Panic. Despair. Death. And demons.
“That’s right. And I,” adds the sorcerer, pulling up his cowl again and raking out his feathers, “am Castiel. Shall we get going?”
“Ginny… good girl…” he examines her quickly once she limps over. The cut is not too deep, the knife thrust was hampered by her thick winter coat, but it’s long across her flank and stabbed into the haunch. He stops her from licking it. She whines piteously, making Dean wince in sympathy, but he pulls himself together. Day's not over yet.
Dean reached for the note with a hard grin. “A dead drop. You guys set up a dead drop.”
Winchester pack, bristling with weapons, waits in tense silence. The Rancher guards pulled the omegas from their seats and hid them behind the sleds. Taylor waits on the one bearing Vic’s stretcher, knife in hand in case he has to cut his leader loose from the ropes lashing him in to pull him to safety.
Dean clears his throat. The library stands shocked that the hush of the past two days has been shattered.
“Oh yes, throughout pretty much all religions at the time. People were imprisoned, abused, even put to death.”
Benny inserted the cannon of the gun into a small hole in the stone door. Sections of what had looked like carved decorated stone began to move like puzzle pieces realigning themselves with nothing more than a faint rocky murmur. There was a very heavy
“Come now, Sam. You know as well as I do that a voluntary confession alleviates many a sin. I am thinking of your wellbeing, here, your future. So much better if you tell me everything you know about the resistance of your own free will, rather than have it retrieved from your mind. It’s a distressing process, as you advocates are always so keen to remind us.”
Dean stared at him, mouth open.
Answer answer answer answer-
“She’s got babies?” Castiel gives the raccoon an apologetic glance for trying to hound her out with a broom. The raccoon thanks him with a sonorous snarl, a noise halfway between a cat’s hiss and a dog’s growl.
Wow, that sounded thoroughly suicidal, and Dean was glad he was going to be in another dimension by the time that happened.
Sam makes a helpless gesture. “Over there. These people showed up during our march this morning, they’re from some northern kingdom. Raspail? Rasepal? Some place we never heard of. There’s around a hundred of them. They said they came to join our alliance. I had them back in the rearguard, but they… they suddenly showed up, and two of them picked up Bo-...” His face twists in sudden pain  “I couldn’t- I couldn't protect him. Dean… it’s bad. It’s real bad. I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault…”
“...Lucifer. Really.” Dean sits back in his chair.
“I’ll deal.”
“Nope, sorry, this is a ‘my brother just got mated!’ hug. Put up with it!”
“We don’t bury angels. Her vessel turned to ash when she fell, what is here is her. Her Grace.”
“Hermaphroditism.”
At six o’clock, they made their way a couple of streets over to the house of Ellen Harvelle, dressed in their Sunday best (that is to say, Dean and his brother were dressed in clean shirts, pressed trousers, western ties, vests and jackets, and as for the angel, one had to presume that what he was wearing was the best he could do…) Sam had given Dean shit all the way for forgetting to tell him about this dinner. Dean had pointed out very rationally that, on the one hand, they were invited to Bobby and Ellen’s every Sunday so Sam was the dumbass for not inquiring, and on the other hand, Dean had been pretty damned distracted, so excuuuuuuse me for forgetting small details.
The leash leaps out - almost! The raccoon swerves, bounces off the arm of the couch, skitters on the hardwood.
“I always tell you to be more careful and wear a helmet,” Castiel grouses.
“Okay, okay, you brat, I got you.”
“I'm saying I'm fine making out on this couch for months if you're, you know, not ready to go further yet,” Dean explains, voice gentle and warm.
“All of them.” Cas’s head is back down the hole now so Dean can’t see his expression, but something about his shoulder blades seems to smile. “I was tasked with helping them with whatever knowledge I’d gleaned, and when one of them got annoyed with the way I questioned their methods and pestered them for information they didn’t have, they’d pass me on to the next. What I know best is medicine, chemistry and electrical systems. Winchester pack already has enough nurses, though.” And medics are betas, because that’s how things are. You need a bit of fighting backbone before you can deal with a pissy injured beta - or god help you, an alpha. “But when it comes to your grid-”
“Yeah?” Bobby’s face was strained. “And who’s gonna sit on me, huh?”
Cas made a sort of non-sound of vague confusion. “I... you understand I do not actually need to lie down to-“
“No, Dean, it was the demon’s decision. Not yours.”
“Something you don’t know, Dean - but Cas does, even if he doesn’t like to think about it. The mind trap used on you is a subversion of a much more elegant technique used on angels to, shall way say, change the-“
In the week that follows, the gossip mill goes off like one of Cas’s wind turbines in a tornado. Dean Winchester got mated! With his best friend who was just an omega three seconds ago! A lot of people claim to be in the ‘saw it coming’ school. Nobody seems to suspect Dean of doing anything inappropriate to bring this about, fortunately. Dean’s known about camp, he’s respected, he’s an upright kind of guy… aaaaand a lot of people have also met Cas by now, the quirky omega who worked all over camp on the grid these past few months, giving his tart opinions on how to do stuff to folk all the way up to the alphas; nobody seems to think anyone could impose on him.
“I told you everything,” says the lady with the dramatic arm fling of one baring their chest as there is nothing hiding in their heart.
Perched on his habitual bar stool, Bobby tipped the rim of his pork pie hat as they walked by, and smirked like the complete and utter skunk he was. “Have fun, boys. Good luck, Rufus.”
He enjoyed the sweet, the kick from the coffee, and the rare chance to be alone with his thoughts and the tick and the tock of his grandfather’s clock. It felt good to be without his bloody guardian angel at times.
“Music hall actresses with their talent down their corsets have better delivery than you do. Git out of here if you’re gonna,” he added, making shooing motions. “Me and these humans, we have enough to worry about.”
Dean made his way through the warrens and warded passages of Lawrence, riding the inevitable memory of doing this a month ago, and the crazy consequences since. This time he didn’t light blood fuses and rockets, though. And Cas wasn’t chasing him; the angel was, as Dean understood the plan, at the garrison laying down his own escape plan that would hopefully give them both a day or two of head-start before the forces of Heaven and Earth came after them.
Dean carefully cleaned up the blood smears down Cas’s back. Two fresh trickles pointed to the impact spots. One of the shooters must have missed.
The large
“I didn’t go invading your privacy,” Cas said reprovingly. “I focused on the night we were attacked, not on your past indiscretions.”
“-not the Plan!” a woman had just said, voice ringing clear as a bell.
“It’s in code, Cas.” To Dean, the few words were as clear as a map. The pass-phrase at the top indicated that the first direction of the instructions had to be reversed. The mention of a trail was not random, it was referring to one of the safe routes taken by runners away from Paradise, a trail full of switchbacks through dense forests and canyons for cover. Dean had accompanied them on this very path before, when the engine driver of the ‘train’ needed extra muscle. There were little warded areas here and there, known as ‘look-out points’, where humans could duck into shelter and keep an eye out for trackers. One of those would be flagged by an inukshuk near the entrance - an indication that Dean was to keep Cas out of the others. He was going to have to keep this all under his hat and take a circuitous route anyway, because compromising this trail would put railroad operators in danger, people like Benny and Charlie who relied on its safety.
A blast of dark power singes his hair and a broken wing, but Rowena doesn’t have time to do anything else before he reaches her and touches her forehead.
“You built a gun, one of your new revolving designs, with all this heathen mumbo jumbo carved on it-“
. Not looking at him as a useful son/soldier or a responsible big brother, not staring at a hunter or a saviour, not dismissing him as a tool or a weapon. The angel sees… Dean. But there is no horror in that radiant gaze, no judgment, no recoil. He sees, he understands, he accepts, he expects all the best out of Dean even as he takes the worst along with it. He considers Dean worthy of his gaze, and even his forgiveness.
“Weapons. Down,” suggests the guy.
“You really don’t have any- any basic question about this whole setup?”
, dad.”
Castiel didn’t stay to speculate, he was home a second later, making Dean drop a jug in the kitchen in surprise.
“Oh, that’s good. Right?”
“You don’t want him to answer that,” Sam says with a toothy grin. “I suggest you run out the back, and if anyone asks you anything about any of this later, just tell them you made a prank call because you hate the DMV, and take whatever fine they slap you with. Don’t tell anyone the truth unless you want to end up in jail or committed. C’mon, Cas, I don’t think we’ll learn much more here.”
Dean takes in a discreet breath, aiming to keep his voice steady when he speaks.
Nobody said anything. Both the advocate and the angel must have figured that if a more serious commandment was to stay intact - thou shalt not kill, for instance - it’d be best for Dean to have a shot of decree-breaking stimulant before he was expected to examine this dog of a situation in any detail.
Cas’s fists tighten against the mantle, knuckles standing out in sharp relief. “I will attempt to restrain myself.”
“I’m reliably told that children do that to you.”
Robert took a sharp turn in his hurried course to stride towards Crowley. Poulterers, confectioners, milkmaids and basters leapt out of his way left and right, a sea parting before him like Moses, but the pharaoh was already on the other side, waiting for him with a provocative sneer on his face.
The light grew brighter as he sliced, as shallow as he could, towards the bullet.
The guard looks Castiel over. He seems confused. Castiel materialized wearing the long white robes he used last time he was visible to a mortal.... which was several Books of various Prophets ago, he now remembers; a blink of time in his lifespan, but for mortals it’s a chunk of centuries that merits the adjective ‘historical’. Castiel watches over humans every day from on high, he knows their current language, their habits, some of their strange customs, but as for actual interaction, he’s not done that for a very long time. From the way the guard is staring at him like a curiosity rather than answering his question, he’s not doing too well.
“Silence!” bellowed Uriel, tensing.
“Yeah, few times. Both resistance and railroad use hell as a hideaway when we have to. The place where we stow away people the Host really, really want.”
“I know, I know, it's your- it’s your right, your biology - I have no say-so! I have- but I can’t- oh god, I really am falling!”
“Oh, right, you wouldn’t know. For good reasons. Next time I dump something on Naomi, it’s going to be boiling hot tar and feathers,” said Gabe with a distant look, though why he was mentioning that queen bitch right now was beyond Dean. “Yeah. back in 1901, Akobel found his soulmate - his human soulmate. Unfortunately for them, it happened in a peaceful library in P1 where they don’t have Lanterns and everyone blindly believes what the Word says, so when they were murdered-“
The Hunters are the sharp dagger’s point of Dean’s armies as well as his pride and joy, he often leads them into battle himself and appoints their commanding officers personally. The previous commander was one Victor, son of Henrick of Maine, but he proved too good even for this honorable posting; back in the fall, Dean knighted the man and gave him a large barony on the border to manage. The reward was well earned, but it left Dean with the charge of finding a successor who could fill Victor’s formidable shoes.
The creature is crying and squirming. Charlie is holding it too tightly. The blade in her free hand catches the morning light as it trembles.
Dean and Cas stand side by side in identical poses: arms crossed, backs to the door, thoughtful look on their faces as they contemplate the cabin’s interior.
“Hm? Eighteen, I think. Yeah, I was four when she was born.”
Dean, Everett and Jo have been out scouting St Louis since they got here. They should be resting from the trip’s exertion, but Dean’s having none of it. Two days away from Winchester territory, four days ago, Dean came across some tracks; fifteen people, five horses, one mule, no cart, and nowhere near the usual paths taken by travelers between Concordat packs… If those tracks showed any inclination to wander towards St Louis, Dean would have called off the expedition. It was his prerogative, he was in charge of that part. But they were heading away, southeast. Dean wishes he could have followed them. They were two weeks gone at least, but they might have stopped somewhere, the ones on foot would have slowed them down. A fast group of trackers could have caught up with them… Dean would have loved to creep up on their camp, see if they had anyone called Alistair with them. Or Lucifer.
Sam struggled to his feet and pulled at Dean’s arm. “He knows who you are! They’re looking for you!”
Dean stops trying to drop-kick lilly pads into a patch of reflected moonlight in order to give Swan Prince a narrow-eyed look. “You know that sounds slightly creepy, right?”
Castiel waits for him to finish his sentence.
“Good. You can shut up,” Dean adds, interrupting Lucifer’s next bullshit. “Shut up and fuck back off to New England or New York or Hell or wherever you’re from. If you come anywhere past the Appalachians again, you will find out just how organized and not-so-primitive our society really is,” Dean finishes softly.
of this?” Though the boxes are not too big, they dragged up a lot of them. They can’t bring all this back.
“Thank god for insignificance,” Rufus muttered.
“Right.”
Humans gamely finished the picnic lunch celebrating their visitors, and stepped out into the town square to go through the motions as ol’ Pete sawed his fiddle. Off to one side, a Magic Lantern was running a show for the five kids currently growing up in their part of Paradise. The story was as sweet as sugar syrup by the looks of it. The angels had no creativity, so they asked humans to come up with entertainment, theater pieces that the Machine could watch, remember and run through the Lanterns. Human writers and actors would comply, come up with something tolerable, and then the angel in charge of surgically removing all fun from life went through the stage plays with a large pair of scissors and excised anything that came close to breaking a decree or implying that Paradise was not perfect. Thus the same pap over and over again: happy children obediently listening to their parents before playing in the eternal sunshine and having very, very tiny non-threatening adventures. To say that this was all lost on its intended audience was an understatement. One of the kids was flicking stones at the Lantern, the others were talking together and shoving each other. Dean was proud. They ate this stuff up with a spoon in some places, but in Paradise 342, the kids were raised right.
“There, monster, sheesh.”
kept purring along- Dean lost it and simply thrust the stones right into its guts.
… and one person missing.
“It may be more fragile than Novak - or it may not, I think it has what Novak may lack in the end: adaptability. And Luke, if you could see it in action! It’s not fighting the animal model per se, but it is subverting it gently, because the alphas have to evolve cooperation,
“No, what I mean- the behavior I’m talking - the initial impression people had for a long time that wolves had alphas, betas and lesser members, a strict hierarchy, is incorrect, it was based on observations of wolf packs that were set up on large nature reservations by humans. For a long time, people thought they were representative of how wolves in the wild behaved, but that’s inaccurate. These caged wolf packs were composed of random members unrelated by blood, heavily stratified, with constant contestation from the beta layer to the single alpha breeding pair. Which is pretty much what we have, if you count obvious differences due to the fact that we’re an intelligent species. But this is not natural, it’s artificial. Do you remember our discussion from a few months back, when you told me that the organisation of our packs - with breeding alphas, betas, omegas, do you remember you pointed out that this is the law of nature? Well that’s not the case for wolves at any rate. Wild wolves are different. There are not really alphas, betas and omegas among them. Almost all wolf packs are nothing more or less than families. The alphas - you can’t even call them bends anymore, there’s just two parents, the breeding pair, and the children. And that’s how they live.”
There is a moment of silence in which Castiel can hear Garth and Benny stir outside, but they don’t come in. Castiel and Dean could be alone in the universe right this minute...
Dean rubs his nose contemplatively. He’s got freckles, Castiel notices, visible in the late afternoon sunshine. “I gotta few spots for this sort of thing. Thirty minutes away from here, in the woods. I’ll release her there.”
“It wouldn’t have done much more than inconvenience me and given me a mild headache. But thank you for the thought,” Cas added unexpectedly.
Panic and Pudding didn’t bitch half as much as Dean would have about their enforced nap. Panic had apparently forgiven Cas for his ‘understandable suspicions, man, I mean, we are the kidnappers here, it’s no wonder we made you tense’, while Pudding was too terrified to say anything as Cas marched them back to the newly modified spell circle.
“Bugger. That probably means I have to drag him and you back to that stupid lake. Let’s just hope it’s not the new moon when we get there.”
“Do you approve of what those men tried to do? Even if you’d not been the one targeted?”
Not with the situation, which still hasn’t devolved into an ambush or a trap. The problem is with the man up ahead. Every step Dean takes, the creeping feeling that there’s something wrong grows… It’s not like when he was facing Alastair, and his inner beta wanted to bolt. It’s definitely not the surge of aggression he experiences when spotting a foreign beta, neither is it the protective/superior feeling an omega would incite… Who is this guy? Or more exactly…
In which Castiel isn’t getting as far as he’d like in locating the source of the trouble - strange, it’s almost as if someone who knows him well is working against him.
In the end, Cas finds a way to optimize their furniture arrangement, bless his clever Maker heart, in order to get them a bigger bed. In exchange, Cas now has ‘his corner’, the furthest from the door. Instead of spreading out his notes, he carefully clips them to a felted mat he hangs on the wall. He sits in a comfortable bag-chair like a miniature rag-couch that’s only a foot off the ground, knees propping up a writing desk in which he crafted an inkwell and pen-holder. Dean worries he’ll get cold there, or stiff, but Cas looks comfortable and can sink for hours at a time into his reading and writing, while Dean peacefully works with hide or deer antlers at the table, cleans his weapons, makes a new bow for Chrissy, whatever occupies his time. When the watery winter sunlight fades, they eat at their larger table, put stones from the hearth into their big bed, and find other ways of keeping warm while the blankets get toasty.
Castiel came awake with an indelicate snort and pawed off the fold of cloth that’d fallen over his face. His mouth tasted like the bottom of the moat, but he felt remarkably rested. Good, because the owl was going to crow any minute now and his duties- wait what?
“Yes alpha.”
Dean’s tension impeded his downward swing, and the ax lodged into the log. “Goddamn,” he muttered, putting a foot against it and tugging. “Don’t you know? Weren’t you ferreting around his brain pan?”
“...okay, we’re two very different kinda princes.” Dean’s spent almost every day hunting since turning twelve; the only geometry he’s ever cared about was the arched drop of an arrow's flight, and his grasp of natural philosophy centers around “What is that?” and “How do I kill it?”
“I don’t understand. You… you do trust me?”
“Did you need me for anything?”
Dean knew the enemy. He knew how angels worked with vessels. The strongest were restricted as to hosts, sometimes down to a single human bloodline.
Cas gave him an arch look. “You don’t have to look, you can sense him with your mind. I’ve told you before, you need to work on your abilities.”
“Get Jonah,” Balthazar snapped at Zuriel, momentarily forgetting that he wasn’t one who gave orders anymore. But Zuriel leaped to his feet and hared off to the second office in a flash.
So how is he going to find it before that happens?
“I can’t believe it!” Panic was hugging Pudding, looking giddy. “Did you see that?! We captured Castiel! An angel! Just like that! I knew Dean was amazing! Just goes to show what we humans can do!”
“’cause it works on Croats too,” Benny tossed back, apparently unsurprised the man had known how many shots had been fired without looking. From the weight perhaps?
. And he’s living among you now. I guess you always were his favorites... If you don’t like Israel this time of year, there’s a place on the east coast where the seed of a new Machine has sprouted, it’ll be a safe haven too in a few weeks. Other places will follow.”
The large white swan gives Dean a beady-eyed look - not that it has much choice in the matter - and ruffles its feathers. “I was trying to illustrate the gravity of my situation.”
“My darling lad and I are a bit on the out at the moment, that is true. Misunderstandings happen in the best of families, and he is under so much pressure, the poor dear. But his mother will find a way to look out for him, even if some people have tarnished my reputation behind my back. For instance, if I assist his good friend Dean Winchester-”
Castiel’s lips move against Dean’s neck. “I suppose I can. But I hope I can persuade her instead. We’ve had a couple of run-ins now, her and I, and I don’t see her as all that ambitious. It’s not the rank she wants. My read on her is that she can’t stand weakness, anything that might hold back her strength or her pack. But if I can show her that I can make you all stronger, she’ll fall into line, however ungraciously. There’s room for the hunters to grow, Dean, to improve their structure and their habits so they can all safely-”
Cas is immediately there, taking it gently out of Ellen’s hand. The look of keen interest fades a little as he opens up the old hardcover and reads the title page. “I know this one, it’s just an old novel, nothing actually useful,” he says a bit dismissively.
Cas smiles, that gummy one Dean is probably only one out of two people in heaven and earth to see. He doesn’t eat, but he sure loves to watch Dean enjoy his pie and try to talk at the same time.
Cas’s look was one of incomprehension. “She didn’t have a choice, we didn’t give her one,” he persisted, reminding Dean of that conversation the angel had had with Sam, about guilt being easier to handle than acceptance.
Dean ran a finger through his short hair, unable to look in Sam’s direction. “Yeah. I know.”
Castiel flew off. Only as far as the roof. He perched there and glared at the setting sun.
“Michael.”
They fall like a pack of wild dogs on anyone outside their group who dares to mock his behavior, oddly proud of their weird commander and his oddities, and at that point Castiel has to step in and restore order.
“I’ll be
, Castiel could feel His presence when he Communed, and he had felt the touch of His hand when he’d been united with Dean. Their Father was still here... How humans could consider this... this sacred gift to be a convenience, or even an inconvenience according to some... but they had not stood in silent vigil for billions of years with silence and faith as their only guide.
“Don’t just stand there! Attack him!” hollers Lutecia.
“That’s the same as alcohol, Dean.”
“I imagine the resistance will have conditions. If this Joker is as intelligent as you say, he will know which compromises I might be able to make and which I cannot. I’m less concerned that he wants me, and more concerned that he wants you too.”
“Hm,” was all Cas said.
Castiel’s objection derails into a confused: “-what?”
“Luke! No!”
“Dean… we’re a bit worried about you.”
A nod from John sends Jo out to join the folk patrolling around the roadhouse. It’s only to clear the room and give her something to spend her nervous energy on, since right now a gnat couldn’t sneak in even in disguise.
“I don’t think they need me specifically up in Heaven. I can do better work here,” Castiel agreed.
“Oh, you know I have a soft spot for those two big-”
...Love that comes along only once...
All the angels stared, uncertain, because their lil’ pocket bibles told them that only an archangel wielding an archangel blade could kill another archangel, and a demon with an ass-bone didn’t qualify, so what the hell was going on, why was Big Mike standing there instead of chortling in a superior way, smiting Evil and getting on with his day?
“But you met this rugged hunter who’s another bend, and suddenly you’re sporting a five o’clock shadow.”
Instead, Ben left a frog in Castiel’s water pitcher. Knowing the prankster and his acolytes would be nearby to hear him scream, Castiel walked out of his room with the frog still in its pottery prison, loudly asking the first passing servant he found if Crowley had started that evening’s stew yet, and if he might need more bones for the bouillon. It had forced the young prince to come out of hiding and stiffly apologize in order to secure the release of his frog. Castiel had been relieved to see the young boy wasn’t cruel to animals, however poorly he treated encroaching prince consorts.
“Uh… you sleeping there?”
Cas gave him an inquisitive look rather than say anything, as if coming with Dean was so natural that it was thanking him for it that was the oddity here.
However long it took, Sam would hold out. There was no way in hell they’d get to Dean through him. Sam would die first. But he didn’t want to, he didn’t want his brother to bear that on his conscience, he didn’t want Dean to have to fight on alone...
The dude didn’t even blink. “You! Colt! Where are those walking disasters?! The Millers?!”
Ferret out- why is she staring at Dean’s abs?
“Yeah, absolutely precious, and I’m glad I got these on,” says Dean drolly, holding up the heavy duty chainmail-reinforced gloves. “You should have seen how they went for my thumb. They’re fighters like their mama.”
Sorry, brother…
Castiel sits without moving.
“Gah, god, yeah, I- I- Christ, how do you put up with it?!”
Tom gave him a faint smile. “I see.”
The bottle on the table is Ellen’s best stuff, brought out from under the counter in deference to John’s presence. Came himself with the first wave of guards, along with Vic’s phalanx who are now scouring the countryside.
is he?
“...Dean?”
“The angel squad wasn’t amused that Metatron’s in the wind.” Dean’s not surprised. He’d suggested Cas ignore the recall order and stay right here in the bunker, fuck the halo brigade.  But Cas, after some hesitation, decided to go up and sort shit out with his family. Dean understands and disapproves at the same time, the usual mixed bag he feels towards most things angel-related (angels as a group as opposed to the trenchcoat-wearing one.)
“How do you label a date as official?” Dean quizzes.
“There’s a single unshot angel at the top of the stairs, so why’s there five bullets missing from this here weapon, fanger?”
“I can see that.”
“You love ordering us around!”
“You alright, son?”
“Dean! We need to run!”
“I’d say.” Balthazar gave him an odd look.
Celestial politics. Of course. That did not bode well for the next meeting he had to attend. Castiel did not head towards Zachariah’s office, though, he scrutinized Balthazar closely instead. “Is that all?”
“Are you alright?” Cas stopped to see why Dean was suddenly crouched.
“To catch and hold me, it will have to be a very good one,” Cas pointed out mildly.
“And she stood and said, Dean, finally I have met you again! And he, our king, looked at her and smiled in pure happiness-”
Castiel makes his way through packed streets full of humans overindulging in fermented beverages. He wants to go to the castle quickly and get this coin he needs, but he’s stopped by a patrol before he even makes it to the market. They examine his wooden token suspiciously. Other humans in the throng are ogling Castiel’s raiments. Once the patrol lets him go on his way, Castiel takes a minute to detour down an alleyway. When he re-emerges, his white robes have transmogrified. The boots and cotton trousers, belted at knee and waist, are the same many people wear here, his gray tunic reinforced with leather panels matches the guards’, the rough-spun baggy brown surcoat is inspired by the cabbage seller’s. He is neither a priest nor a jester, so he should not dress as such.
“Heavenly father, thank you for the food you bring to our table, praise be, amen,” Sam said stiffly, eyes screwed shut. Then he opened one of them as if not entirely sure what would happen, though the brothers must have done this ritual several times a day for all their lives,
The pages vary wildly in size and texture. Paper is rare in this day and age, a pain to make, it’s reserved for important things such as accounts and letters and the bible (painfully transcribed by Pastor Jim and his omega helper, because John can’t be bothered to scavenge and maintain a printing press.) Cas’s writing is neat but cramped to save on space, sometimes on the back of old missives or ledger sheets. There’s about a hundred pages at first count, a staggering number. Dean reads through the first three, then flips curiously through the rest, reading here and there.
‘Head south. Keep a sharp look-out along the trail until you see some rocks,’ was all it said.
Cas glanced down at his chest and then up at Dean’s face without a single remote hint of embarrassment or shyness. In fact, the latter’s familiarity with the angel’s small tells informed him Cas was both intrigued and rather pleased with the effect his initiative had gotten him.
Colt glanced down at the four year old boy at his side, staring out across the fields of corn choked with ash and blackened by disease.
He and Dean must be at the misunderstanding stage. So Castiel reaches down, covers the Mark with his palm, moves forward sharply to keep the skin to skin contact when Dean yanks away. Beneath his hand, the Mark squirms like a poisonous thing made of chitin, claws and razor blades. Castiel ignores it.
“...Who erases a query about a meteor, or whatever it was?”
Whew, quite a ride! Thank you for all the comments and kudos!
“Nobody’s talking to me,” said Castiel. It was a factual statement, yet it seemed to make Dean wince. He glanced back at the house.
“Yes,” said Cas, still giving veggies a run for their money in the crisp-’n-chill department. “I can see the quality of this entity’s grace. His deeds echo through the spheres, the orders he’s followed, the people he’s killed. He’s not worth much, I’m afraid.” Thirty feet away, hogtied Castiel’s eyes bulged. “And he wants to kill you very badly. He could hurt you and a lot of humans. You should have ended him.”
It was, to misappropriate a term, heaven. Compared to this shack at any rate. Better yet, nobody there cared he was an angel, which made their welcome nicer than the Roadhouse. He only went there when he wanted to get amusingly insulted in an underhand way, or annoy Bobby by flirting with Ellen. The only other places in 342 where people could hang out were communal craft tables and knitting circles (ugh), prayer meetings (double ugh) or else served food, which Balthazar had never gotten the hang of despite a lot of attempts, so he didn’t bother with them.
“You really have no clue?” The man asked tightly. “Or the name of someone else I could ask? They’ve warded themselves. I can’t find them.”
“Come now, it is about the hour your studies were done anyway.” The badger had been well-timed. Ben and the others might dislike their ever-changing tutors as a whole, but they enjoyed the studies, particularly the mathematics and the literature. Since noble scions had their own tutors at home, the other children present were those of the castle staff. In Eden they’d have been hard at work all day, but Dean hadn’t liked the idea of Ben growing up without any friends his own age, while Castiel believed in literacy and education for all children as much as could be afforded, yes, even girls. But now was the time when the working class children went about their chores after a morning of studies, and Ben would have been alone with the tutor for what was his own duty: the apprenticeship of monarchy. The rest of the morning would have been dedicated to etiquette, followed by courtly dancing this afternoon. No wonder the badger had come out today; yesterday Ben’s princely ‘education’ had been learning dueling techniques from his father and then horsing around with the latter in the stables, and that never got derailed, unlike Castiel’s carefully planned curriculum.
Sam sticks his ledger under his arm and pushes away from the wall he’d been propping up. “You think it’s cool if I talk to Andrea? Help her prepare for the trip?”
Dean blinked. “Really? That’s one of ours?”
this was it this was what he’d wanted, this fine body with that fresh scent unpolluted by sweat, the arms that could be so very gentle and that were also so very, very strong, and that hard length slowly spearing into him, oh
Cas was staring off in the distance. “We need to hurry.”
“Your questions and arguments are very good, Dean,” he’s told in that serious tone, that gravely timbre.
“I don’t understand,” he said bluntly. “A man tried to kill you and your brother. I feel like this should be making most of my argument for me. I don’t understand why it doesn’t feel that way at all.”
Ellen’s face fell. “Tarnation,” she said quietly. Fortunately the maids had decided to take their wailing elsewhere before Ellen remembered where she’d left her birch switch, or else Castiel would not have heard her. He was amazed he could hear her anyway, she was a good nine yards from him. He glanced up and noted little holes near the top of the spy way leading to the arched ceiling of the servant quarters. Some very clever architect must have designed this for the best sound possible. The Men of Letters had had a number of exceedingly astute souls in their ranks.
“Ah, excuse me?”
Cas pauses, glancing over the river in a westerly direction. “I couldn’t imply that it was done on purpose because the Hierarchy is seen as God’s grandiose and patriarchal plan to end all plans, even when it obviously isn’t. You see, a lot of the Novak pack customs are based on the bible - or a corrupted and rather triaged take on the bible, I should say - and in short, in New Eden, same-sex pairings are a sin.”
Cas sighed and glanced upwards.
Dean knew Crowley was a backslider. He wishes Crowley had a big mouth, and came to them and talked and told them this creep was out in the world.
Dean quickly brings his attention back to the road and pretends he was focusing on traffic all along.
Castiel stared at him, at the hard green eyes and the bright steady soul behind them-
Panic, head twisted ninety degrees away from the demon armed with a knife, was staring in open terror at a nearby symbol painted on the wall of the warehouse. It was smoking, the paint starting to peel.
Charlie merely snorts.
“Oh yes! No wonder you stopped looking for the cure! I am-”
“Are the wards in place?” Dean barks.
“I remember screwing,” says Rufus in a theatrically whimsical way that makes everyone snicker. “It was rather a nice perk.”
Four of the guys are still out of rifle range, but the seated stranger stood up and is now walking forwards. A slow confident stride. Power in the shoulders, the long steps, the posture.
Dean cocked an ear, but he couldn’t hear anything. He’d expected an explosion or some form of perceivable attack. But if Cas said Gabe had just kicked down the front gate and started his ruckus, Dean would believe him.
It’s a bloody short sleep. Can’t be more than three hours before the rooster in the nearest Rancher barn starts doing his thing, and thank god it’s winter or the blasted bird would have been at it even earlier. Three hours barely qualify as a nap, but Dean wakes up feeling better than he ever has before in his life because there’s a warm weight in the mattress next to him, there’s soft regular breath brushing his shoulder, making the skin tickle-
“No. It could attract attention.”
“A what? Oh, one of those mental wards against scans.”
Dean plunges the bowie knife deep into the junction between jaw and throat and yanks sideways as hard as he can, widens the cut by an inch.
Dean aimed and let his shot roll across the turf that ornamented this side of Kiowa junction. “See, like that. You need to get it closer to the jack, the small ball. So, how’d it go with Zach? Have they figured out how the Machine went wrong and got us mixed up?”
“Castiel,” Castiel corrected, looking back at his brand new burden and duty.
Crowley makes a vague sound and licks his lips. When he talks, his voice is breeze-quiet in the stillness. “So. Ah. Which way to that roadhouse...?”
“Go sit somewhere else,” Dean ordered tersely, his hand grasping the top of his opened shirt so that his collar bit into his neck a little.
“...What-“ Dean measured the unfriendly look in Benny’s eyes and the gun still on Cas. “It’s fine. He’s with me.”
“What?!” Castiel stared, mind flashing back to the night that ring had first slipped onto his finger. “You never said that!”
“Well, yeah-”
“We really can’t walk out of here? How are they holding you?”
Dean stared at the wall straight ahead, coffee cup in hand. On the far side of the kitchen, the clock grandpa Henry had made went tick and tock, tick and tock.
Cas shakes his head. “Luke, think about it. To begin with, I remember very well our discussions back in Eden. How humanity could never afford to be divided into subspecies, how it would inevitably lead to war and annihilation. So making your new virus non-infectious and available only to volunteers is obviously out of the question, you’d have to bypass all notions of consent and spread it to everyone equally
“I mean, real pigs, the barnyard kind with large appetites and a mud fixation, the whole nine. They started running around on all fours, chowing out of people’s plates and wallowing in the dirt of the atrium. In the chaos, some diners swear they saw curly tails, though the ICU people are keeping quiet on that, not surprisingly.”
“Who are you to tell me anything?! You’re no hunter!”
The situation had so improved that the royal couple was free to make their first visit abroad without worrying that a revolt would occur the minute they crossed the border. Michael had taken the occasion for a state visit, making this a tripartite meeting of the powers of the region, and Castiel’s cup runneth over, because having to manage the pomp and ceremony of two royal visits on top of having to deal with his brother might just push him past the point of sanity.
“Yeah, this guy’s the Joker - not that I haven’t stopped reeling about that yet. At the end of the day, though, he works for the resistance and helps the railroad, and that aligns with my beliefs. I warned you from the start, right? I promised not to put a knife in your back, but that was as far as I could go. If this was some ploy to get you to betray the Host, and Samuel and Gabriel ordered me to lie my ass off to convince you, I’d do it.”
Red flags were waving all over the place. It was the alien stare of horror, repulsion and confusion that his lover was giving him. It was the way Cas gripped his angel blade like he was seconds away from using it. It was the violence Cas had applied to the wall in the first place. And it was the view over the angel’s shoulder. Ruins and dust as far as the eye could see, only a few broken walls standing sentry along ash-blackened streets pockmarked with craters. Wait, wasn’t that…? Yeah, that heap a few blocks away, that was Union Station in Indianapolis, or what was left of the big orange monstrosity. The burned and blasted building, clocktower knocked over, was the degenerate crown jewel of a landscape of utter destruction all around it. What… the… hell…?
“I should be done by then, or if not, well, let’s hope she likes animals.”
“Cassie himself can help a bit in that regard, but...” Balthazar’s hands tightened on the arms he’d crossed. “You’re going to have to tie your wings behind your back, brother. Think about where you’re going. Are you-“
- savage pain in his thigh!
Cas was silent for a stretch, then he and Dean turned towards the two monkeys.
“Cas… Jesus, your timing sucks. Not that this would ever
“Then let’s go.”
The feeling that runs through Castiel right then… it is so deep, so resonant, so full of wonder, it is a  revelation… This… this right here… is the best thing to have ever happened to him in all his eons of existence, more just and righteous than any duty from on high. This moment is holy.
“They
(See the end of the chapter for
Even though he still seemed puzzled, the corners of Cas’s mouth twitched up, echoing Dean’s chuckles, until they were grinning at each other for no reason, or for all the reasons, perhaps, and for nothing that needed to be brought up now.
His mind dwelled on very distant memories, of cold hard words spoken downstairs when he was supposed to be in bed, hot looks swapped over his head, the way friends would suddenly excuse themselves and leave the room on some pretext as John and Mary stood looking at each other with eyes hard... There’d been love, too; Dean could only recognize now, as an adult, how much love there had also been, but it’d almost acted like two magnets of same polarity, the very strength of it making them too desperate, too intransigent, and pushing the other away. Until one was gone for good, and then that love had dragged John to his own death, leaving his children behind. However hard it had been to be in love with Mary at times, it would have been so much harder to have lost her...
. If circumstances were different- Dean realized his thoughts were heading towards ‘I bet if they got to know each other, they’d get along’, and shut that notion down. He hated to see Benny mixed up in this, just as much as Cas, because this was probably not going to end well...
...Why did Cas have the same kind of markings?
“Then stay down until
“Huh? Wait, I’m good, don’t rush off. I, uh, it’s good to hear your- to hear from you.” Dean clears  his throat and then asks briskly: “How are you doing on your end?
Alfie stiffened like a startled colt. “Oh no, he wouldn’t do that!”
“I’m not cowering indoors, boys, any more than the rest of you. But if it makes you feel better,” she added dryly (and for some reason directing this at Castiel rather than Bobby or Dean or any of her family,) “if anyone bursts in with bad intentions, we’ll all holler loud enough for you to hear. You’ll be there instantly, I’m sure, which might be just about fast enough to stop me from doin’ something to those rabid prairie rats that the Machine would not like me doin’ on a Sunday, or indeed any day. Good night.”
Gasps echoed around the room. Over Sam’s shoulder, Bobby looked grim and Ash let out a long whistle.
“How could Sam have gotten here a week ago? This place is hundreds of miles away from Paradise 342, we travelled for over twelve days and we flew part of the way to get here.”
“No, can’t see him from this angle.” Dean didn’t bother craning his neck much, he was still watching Crowley.
“So you do trust me?” he asks heavily, almost hoping Dean will say ‘no’ because then he’s got an excuse to give up before he even starts.
“S’up,” he mutters. He hasn’t opened his eyes, he can tell Castiel’s light tread apart from his brother’s.
“Why were you so surprised that I wanted to-... um… do this with you? Didn’t you see into my head the other day?”
And life carries on, as it has a habit of doing, without grand demonstrations of faith or waxing lyrical. Over his armor Dean wears an old surcoat of what used to be cotton and velvet, pretty much all changed over for linen in patches by now, but the arm always stays the same, a crudely stitched cream colored cloth tied around the sleeve. Castiel wears an old gold coin around his neck. They don’t need to talk about such things. Years later, semi-retired in an old fort from whence newly trained Hunters come forth to make the world a safer place, many, many years later, it’s no longer truly a secret between them, this knowledge that’s never been shared, even if it’s never really been acknowledged either. It just is.
“Said it?” Dean makes a concerted effort to unclench his fist and focus his brain. Damn those beta rages at times.
I’m off on a 10 day business trip, I’ll be tired, jet-lagged and stressed. Next chapter is written but needs polish, so probably won’t post until I get back, unless I have time in the evenings and a modicum of energy (comments and kudos have a wonderfully energizing effect, however ^_~ )
“I declare, what you have done with this castle? Amazing. Simply amazing. You should have seen it near the end of the war, for all of Ellen’s travails it was worse than a henhouse with a fox in it. Now it’s running like a prized hunter. But that’s nothing compared to the real renovation.”
“Oh, but you do, dearie. I am quite certain of it, though may I say, only a witch of my
Castiel leaps up and hurries off, hands covering his ears, heart thundering in his chest.
No. It will not happen. They’ve only just found each other. They cannot lose each other now, especially with all this anger and mistrust between them- no, it cannot happen…
Castiel sat on the ground, eyes on the fire. He didn’t seem worried in the slightest. Dean’s faint irritation at that was entirely born of reflex.
~~~ * ~~~
“Okay,” says Sam, trying unsuccessfully to hide a worried look thrown his way.
“I fixed the system, our Father locked Michael away, which leaves Gabriel next in line as leader of the Host. If he takes charge of the day to day operations, I will be quite safe. Infuriated on a daily basis, I’m sure, but quite safe.”
. Know your place, omega!”
“Me? No, I’m fine,” Sam said through gritted teeth.
“You said Sam was alive.” Cas’s voice was as menacing as Dean had ever heard it.
“Ah, I wouldn’t know about that.” Balthazar’s feelings in the higher spheres were bitter, a match for the ragged grimace on his face, and Castiel remembered with regret that his one-time squad-mate and liaison to Intelligence had been punished, demoted and was now out here to rot.
“Bored of what?”
“No, he’s not. Good grief, bro! You’ve lived a few weeks in Paradise now, do you really think that- that milquetoast watered down version of a boring sunday afternoon is what the Plan was?! That’s Michael’s thing! Control! Everyone in line! Do as I say! Not the Machine. Dad’s greatest achievement with humans was free will. See much of that in Paradise?”
Dean was silent. No point lying or pretending. But he wasn’t going to say anything either.
“Good, that’s wise, very good.” Castiel’s mouth pours out words without much conscious input from his brain.
put them in. That is ridiculous. I think you just wanted to know Dean was not the kind of egotist who would make that decision for everyone.”
Dean doesn’t ask the obvious question. That grin’s left him with an instinctive reluctance to talk to this fucker and dance to his tune.
“Be careful what you dig up in there,” retorts Castiel, voice as cold as the snow and face still turned away. “The last thing we need is another epidemic started by some fool who thought he knew what he was doing.”
Castiel cannot, right this very second, remember or care why he’s standing on a curb on the edge of Harrisburg. “Following leads,” he says vaguely. “What is Rowena doing exactly? How is she curing you?”
Two kings turned towards the third, Dean with a look of betrayal while Michael’s chin lifted in vindication.
“Hmm. He tell you anything we can use in Winchester?”
Michael gave Castiel one hard look in passing, a promise of retaliation. Castiel stared right back, unperturbed.
As he approached Dixie street, Dean heard someone singing from the second story of the house right at the corner. Sarah Mackie lived there, Dean’s exquisite map of Lawrence informed him. The words floated down to him in, brought by what should have been an evening breeze.
“What?!”
“Immortal?”
“Why not?”
Dean sits up in a spasm of muscles, body rigid with horror from the waist up-
It’s not so much the stowaway giving him grief these days, though. He’s having nightmares. Not every night, which is a marked improvement over some periods of his life, actually, but these aren’t the usual run of the mill ones he’s learned to live with, either. As a result, he’s having a hard time getting his necessary four-hours-a-night he’s learned to live on over the years.
“There’s camps dotted here and there, of course, but nothing fresh. Just scavengers like us, I wager.”
Shit. Shit!
Light sprung to life between his fingers. A kind, gentle Light divine; it
“Dunno about famous, but that’s Cas. Castiel Novak. He’s fixing all kinds of stuff in our grid.” Dean accelerates like he’s trying to put some distance between himself and a subject of conversation he’s suddenly feeling a little squirrely about, though he’s not sure why.
Put down the pitchforks, Cas-fans. I love our trenchcoated angel too, but he does tend to be a bit of a hard-liner at times, even in the latter seasons. He did execute Akobel in the past, he did try to kill Jesse, he did pinch the angel tablets because he didn’t even trust Dean with them, he did murder a nephilim who just wanted to be left alone, and he’s the same angel who ‘does what has to be done’ when it comes to Donatello in canon just last season. In addition, in this fic, he’s not met Jack or Kelly Kline to temper his views on the subject of nephilim. Now, would he really have done it if he’d gotten there first, or is Dean correct and he’d have flinched and tried to find an alternative? I’ll leave it open to your interpretation.
Castiel tore his arm away like he’d been burned.
“Says the man who might one day bear children if he becomes an alpha along with another male.”
A nephilim. They’d been idiots not to have foreseen the possibility, what with all the angels who’d been released on earth during their exile, unruly, abandoned and forlorn.
Ellen spits out her mulberry tea and Jo almost drops her glass, but Charlie, who’s the quickest thinker Dean knows and probably had her ears pricked beside, chirps: “Sure, Dean, swap your dong for a dress and you’re so going on my dance card.”
Well fuck.
Sam opens his mouth as if to protest. Then emotions like quicksilver follow each other over his features, too quick for an angel to read. In the end, though, he smiles, warm and a little rueful. “No. I’ve never seen you get anything easy and good in your life you didn’t have to fight for. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have it. Fuck the Mark, we’ll figure it out, right? So go for it.”
Cas strides through the door without any sign of intimidation. “I need to do something before you lock up. Dean, can you stay a minute?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean gets that Cas is a great fan of Jo since she pried that beta off of him at the roadhouse, but ick.
Dean sees the woman move in his peripheral vision - always a hunter, even here at the breaking of the day in this trendy and half deserted drinking joint, the only one at walking distance from the motel. He expects the chick to move to the bar or the bathrooms, not stop at his table. He looks up in surprise just as she leans down low, elbows on the closest chairback, incidentally giving a startled Dean a good shot of a mile of cleavage. Nice view, thinks Dean reflexively.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looked at Castiel as if this had proven some complicated point he’d been trying to make. Castiel looked back at him blankly.
In the cold air, a startling sight: a sky both above and below. Clouds drifted over stars, smoke drifted over a few lights from the castle and the town at their feet, the lamplighter’s tireless work dotting the important streets here and there… The moon floated above, round and full, the river beyond the town echoed its pearly shine. The enchanting view held Castiel for all of three heartbeats but then he was examining the solidity of the tower (not abysmal) and the height of the battlements protecting them from a deadly plunge (satisfactory.) Neither was the tower’s guette likely to drop a tile on their heads, though the wooden beams holding up the open construct’s roof looked fairly rotten. He’d have to tell Dean to get this taken down before it tumbled into the courtyard and onto someone’s head. Wait… was this place truly abandoned? The guette didn’t look used, but it protected a servant’s tick mattress covered in an old blanket, and one of the battlement crenelations sported a corked jug and two goblets.
Cole puts his arms beneath him, levers up- flinches as Dean suddenly and swiftly lifts his hand… to scratch his nose. Someone in the crowd of onlookers snickers. Cole flushes an even brighter red, but he cringed, and he knows it. He lets Dean stand up first, a sign of submission, and then he gets to his feet and slinks off, shooting his leader a dirty look but head lowered, tail to the ground.
From day one, John Winchester and the Cuevas gave me more latitude than I ever had in my life! And Dean- Dean’s been wonderful. He’s the kind of beta we can build a future on without breaking everything in the process- don’t scoff, Luke, Dean is my- Dean and I are in a committed relation and you will treat him with the respect that demands.”
“Most clever plans are. So, who’s in?”
Colt had heard rumors. He hated them. This went beyond the occasional exorcism, it sounded serious. Hell, he’d even heard that Henrietta had bought the farm at the start of the year, but that was fudge and nonsense since Perez had seen both siblings alive and well no less than two months back. One more odd and contorted rumor floating around; like a whole town getting wiped off the map, or a massacre of hundreds off in some gulch somewhere, or dangerous horsemen riding into town and people dying…Demons were getting uppity too, hunters were running into more and more of them, hence Colt’s efforts to locate a possible leak out of hell. He regretted like blazes that the siblings had gotten mixed up in all that stuff, but he wasn’t about to admit his worries to this kook.
The plot thickens! The next chapter is not related to the Winchester-centric plot, however, I'll leave it to speculation as to what it could be about... (obviously nothing rosy and happy and full of kittens.)
“Uh… not too much wine.” Thinking of the stairs, Castiel wrote the same message on the wax, but Eileen had no interest in picking up the tablet again, she had uncorked the jug and poured. The scent of mulled wine wafted out, the neck of the jug steamed. It had been cold and damp in the passageway and it was brisk up here. Castiel found himself reaching for the goblet with more enthusiasm than he normally would. Just one cup for courtesy, then they had to negotiate those stairs down, make their way back to the sideroom and go to bed. He had an early day tomorrow, same as usual.
~~~ * ~~~
“What do you mean?”
Dean claps his thighs and shoves himself to his feet on the impetus, swapping that rare moment of stillness for his usual coiled energy. “Alright then, come on, we got a situation brewing, but I’m gonna need a map. There’s one in my tent. Also the reports I just received- hello there.”
Dean turns, gaze centering somewhere left of the board as he shoves a piece forward randomly.
“Great. I’m tougher than Crowley. That’s like saying I’m nicer than Lucifer. That bar ain’t high, lady.”
“I’ll take your advice. Thank you.”
There’s a small silence on the other end of a man thrown off his business introduction. “Uh, I’m free, yeah, what-”
“Here we go,” growls Dean, looking away from the blue silk bow he’s tied and back to Lutecia. “Fine, lay it out, your ladyship. Let’s go over this once more, that famous day where you say you saved me.”
“Dean. Finally we meet again.”
“Fall out and back, watch Vic’s rear,” Dean says and signals, while behind him Vic marches towards the tributary’s edge, boots thudding through churned snow with the vicious stamp of an alpha whose territory has been invaded and who’s gonna go find out what the fuck. Those losers better have a reasonable explanation handy, or be very, very good at begging for mercy.
have been keeping a discreet eye on you two during your trek, in case you ran into more trouble than you could handle. And also to see how you behaved, since that kind of jaunt would have had Romeo and Juliet at each other's throats after a fortnight. But here you are, stuck together like a ship and a barnacle… So, in final, Dean, if you were hoping for an easy annulment of the ol’ matrimonial shackles, you’re out of luck. You and Cas just happen to be made for each other - believe it or not. Dad just made sure you two got together in time to have a wedding instead of a funeral.”
“You think we have any other choice?” Dean snaps. “I’m not stupid enough to trust her, okay? That’s why I called Charlie back. She can help you keep an eye on Rowena. Charlie, you’ve been boning up on magic and texts and stuff, looking for ways to help me. Well, now we put that to use. I’ll deal with Cas. I know this solution is fucked, but we’re out of options. It was bad enough when it was just me going hellwards, but now? We got to deal with this, and if we have to dance with the devil - or with the devil’s mom - then that’s what we gotta do. Where did I put my phone…”
Silence. Colt stared at Gabriel. Gabriel stared at Colt.
“That would not be wise.”
“...Can I do that?” Castiel asked in something like fascination.
When he looks out the window, his putative rescuer has opened the back of the van and has extracted a six foot leash pole, a large mesh cage, and is pulling on some heavy duty gloves that go up past the elbow.
use those means too. Are you sure- maybe I can take the well exit tonight and Cas can join me outside? He can leave at any time. Like that I won’t have to scratch out sigils in the tunnel.”
“I just wish-” he bursts out and then stops and waves a vague hand around, because what the hell does he wish for, huh? Sure, a lot of things, but that’s like a djinn dream, right? You wish you can extirpate the crap, and then when you turn around, yeah, the crap is gone but you also lost everything good in your life too, the stuff that arrived along with it, even because of it. And if there’s one thing Dean will never wish to change, it’s that kid back there, or the angel at his side. Come what may.
“So, Cas.”
The sorcerer, still staring at the floor, answers evenly. “Nothing. I called out to her. She told me she was getting a back massage, and that she would help me when she was done. But she never did. My mother… is easily distracted.”
“Huh? What do you mean? Oh nuts. Your little fanciers are here again.”
“That’s possible?”
“What’s all the commotion?” Sam grumbles, coming into the room.
“So romantic!”
“Hm. Yeah, it would be if we weren’t playing checkers.”
Now fantasy has become reality, and yes, sex is involved, but truth be told, the first three days of being mated are not that different from the last three days of being a sad mateless loser; there’s work, there’s dinner warmed up on the fireplace, there’s friends, there’s a game of chess, there’s sleeping in a tiny bed. The night-and-day difference is that Cas is now fitted into every nook and cranny of his life, making it ten times better. Even as he focuses on work, Dean’s still walking on sunshine knowing he’s not going back to an empty cabin afterwards; Cas brings them dinner direct from the kitchen and they eat it together while talking about their day; all their friends have been clapping them on the shoulders and looking so happy on their behalf that Dean’s chest feels like it’s gonna burst; he’s lost the chess game to Cas who gives no quarters, the bastard, and has that small but ravishingly pretty grin on his face when he wins that Dean can now drag off to bed and make him pay for, and yeah, that tiny mattress has seen some exercise, lemme tell you.
“I did ‘ferret’, but I did not invade,” Cas informed him in a measured tone that gave even Dean, who was beginning to decipher the critter a bit, no clue how much the angel did or did not regret having to violate Sam’s mind and privacy like that. “I was concentrating on the railroad. On you.”
“Ooooh, indiscretions, is it? Hah.”
Sam stared at him for twenty whole seconds, then he looked away, towards the window. “That was a big gesture on his part.”
“It’s in the same sheds, so no.”
. It breaks cleanly off at the arch and comes swinging down at him like a rolled-up newspaper aiming at a fly, roughly three hundred pounds of drywall, insulation, wooden beams and roof, most of it on fire.
One in the end, not the Ever After kind. Not so far. And in his heart, he knows, probably Never.
~~~ * ~~~
“That’s-...” Cas sinks his head against Dean’s shoulder and talks into his neck. “I need to learn to control myself.”
, don’t-”
In case you find it puzzling, the origin of Lydia's attitude will make sense in a couple of chapters.
“Penance? Dude, where you gonna fit that, huh?!”
“So you say,” Cas told him tartly. “As for the
“Dean,” Cas protests, but it’s better they know right away. Benny’s radio report echoes in Dean’s ears.
“Couldn't you go under the crawlspace?” There’s cool air and quite a lot of dust blowing up from the hole.
“It’s usefulness does not remove the stain of its origins,” Castiel answers, pleased to be able to actually interact with this remarkable human. Also, he’s telling the truth and spreading God’s word. “Demons are the creators of all the magic humans possess, its allures compromise the weak of soul. Its use is forbidden by our Father.”
The intruder blanched, spun around and rushed outside. Far, far away on the horizon, a strange sight: a pillar of light rising up like a distant water fountain.
“Hell has lost all the heavy hitters it ever had, and my power’s pretty much the only thing giving this place any juice any more, however incompatible we are,” Gabriel interjected indifferently. “As for why Crowley
“You’re around here somewhere.” The voice was steady and grave... and coming nearer quickly. Bastard had figured out that Rufus was a distraction and was heading in the direction he’d been momentarily distracted from. “You should surrender.”
“Not for sure, not unless I find some miraculously good information in our October expedition to St Louis, but I was wondering what you thought.”
“Dude, I date gals and guys alike, relax,” says Dean with an easy smile. “Now let me get this racoon out of your hair before she blows your big date.”
Well after nearby St Bibiana rang for complines, Eileen wandered off to examine the royal portraits hanging around the room. Castiel perforce accompanied her with a candelabra, leaving the two kings drinking by the fire behind them.
“But I didn’t have any details. All I knew was that he was part of a taskforce against the remains of the demon army. Old Yellow Eyes was attacking resistance outposts at the time, trying to rebuild his troops by corrupting those he could, and infecting the others with the Croatoan plague. The angels and the Hunters were licking their wounds, the trackers couldn’t get a bead on that demony bastard. The resistance had to defend themselves. They managed to terminate the threat, and a lot of resistance fighters died doing it, as well as getting rid of other high profile targets. I… I suspected Dad might have volunteered for the worst one, though. Because of mom. But I didn’t know for sure and I didn’t want to believe it for the past thirty years because it was fucking unfair.” The scar tissue gave another tug. “She was our mother too. If he was going after Azazel, he should have brought us. We should have had the choice at least. It wasn’t only his revenge.”
The summoning ritual fails. Twice. As the human and the angel scratch their heads and look at each other, wondering what to try next, there’s a “Hoi!” from the library.
“If you’re too lilly-livered, give it over to me, I’ll deal with it.”
“What?!” Dean turned abruptly, both startled and appalled. “But what about-...”
“This is my mission. Given directly to me by the God Machine,” Castiel said steadily. “Not even Michael can defy our Father.”
rules. God’s rules- stop laughing.”
Demon felled, Castiel looks around, tallying what they still face. The bottleneck of their formation has done a good job of stopping the Hunters from being overwhelmed, though this will not last long… His little group is the pivot of the defence. Dean - who used royal prerogative to appoint himself in this dangerous position despite Castiel's objections - has cleared their left flank. The steady thud-chop-thud-chop from Castiel’s right suggests Benny is doing his customary efficient job at threshing everything on that side, and there are a lot of dead demons at Castiel’s feet. ‘Fun’ might be overstating it a little, but It is satisfying.
